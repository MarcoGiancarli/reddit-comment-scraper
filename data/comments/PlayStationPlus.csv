PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,UltimaGabe,5,Wed Jul 22 00:21:14 2015 UTC,"Nothing, the games change out on the first Tuesday of the month, so that would be August 4th.  I mean you might miss out on some extra PS+ discounts, but nothing too major probably(it's only 10% extra)"
PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,CA719,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:26:18 2015 UTC,"Er, I guess that's what I meant. But do July's games go away forever when August's games come in?"
PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,ThomKane,2,Wed Jul 22 00:27:55 2015 UTC,"Unless they are added back in the the free games for another month, then yes. You won't be able to get rocket league for free after July or anything else available this month (rocket league alone is worth just doing it now)"
PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,Meta0X,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:30:59 2015 UTC,"Friend of mine bought a PS4 for Rocket League. I think that was overkill, but the game is well worth paying for, nevermind getting for free."
PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,tinselsnips,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:51:39 2015 UTC,"As long as you ""buy"" the games before the end of July, they will always be available to you, as long as you have a PS+ subscription. If that's what you're asking. They don't disappear after 30 days. If your subscription lapses, you lose access to them but get them back whenever you renew your subscription."
PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,Klutztheduck,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:59:22 2015 UTC,I would get it now because of rocket league.
PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,SirBumper,4,Wed Jul 22 02:55:22 2015 UTC,Rocket League.
PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,infinitelives,4,Wed Jul 22 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"Have I missed something? Why would Rocket League be expiring early?  Normally PS+ games don't expire until the first Tuesday of the month, which will be August 3rd.  So if OP signs up on August 1st, he should still have time to get Rocket League."
PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,fuck_shoes22,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:05:59 2015 UTC,Is that the only one?
PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,RawrCat,3,Wed Jul 22 00:29:26 2015 UTC,"It's a VERY fun game. But worth paying for if you miss it for ps+. So essentially, in my opinion, that is what you'd miss out on if you didn't join sooner. It's not like you can't play it ever though."
PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,Meta0X,-3,Wed Jul 22 01:04:18 2015 UTC,Yes it's the only one and yes it's totally worth it.

PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,Kimchi_Chan_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:52:18 2015 UTC,"As long as you activate before August 4th, you'll be able to get both months games.  So if you're doing it on the 1st like you said, you don't have anything to worry about."
PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,MyrMartyr,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:41:59 2015 UTC,You'll still get the free games from July until the next ones are released. And that doesn't happen a week or so into the month.
PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,Kimchi_Chan_,-1,Wed Jul 22 00:23:54 2015 UTC,"But at that point, July's games become gone forever. But if I activate my PS+ account, and theoretically never let it lapse, I keep those games forever.  Right?"
PlayStationPlus,3e4zst,hardangelfan,3,Wed Jul 22 00:29:18 2015 UTC,"No, they don't. July's games become unavailable the following Tuesday, the 4th."
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,Retro_Edge,2,Mon Jul 20 23:23:15 2015 UTC,sounds like we need the store to update
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,ps4hero,3,Tue Jul 21 02:00:39 2015 UTC,I preordered it but it says it won't be available until noon pacific time. I bet it will be free for you once it's officially released.  Does anyone know if it's possible to get it early by changing my region or something?
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,renegade7879,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:39:05 2015 UTC,"Nope, if the purchase is in the NA store, it stays there.   17 minutes... I've been obsessively checking so I can have it ready when I get home in an hour."
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,Barteringram,3,Tue Jul 21 18:43:17 2015 UTC,"Europe here, free for me! You have to choose the version while buying."
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,Raggedy-Man,2,Tue Jul 21 10:59:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the news! It is free for me, since I have the digital version. Just started the download, ready in 6 minutes. Screw the movie I was going to watch, THIS is tonights entertainment! Such a great game, 5/5 just buy it already if you have not played it on PS3."
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,larsvondank,2,Tue Jul 21 13:08:05 2015 UTC,Free Journey? Am i missing something?
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,Issune91,5,Tue Jul 21 01:44:33 2015 UTC,did you buy it on ps3 digitally? if so you get it on ps4
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,ps4hero,2,Tue Jul 21 02:00:49 2015 UTC,oh. Nah. I got the collectors edition.
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,Issune91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:32:27 2015 UTC,Wow how are they giving free access to other versions if you bought the game but not to those who get the collectors edition?
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,MoazNasr,4,Tue Jul 21 16:33:40 2015 UTC,"From what I gather, you have to get the digital download to get it free for ps4. My collectors edition is physical..."
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,Issune91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:23 2015 UTC,Ah alright that makes sense.
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,MoazNasr,2,Tue Jul 21 17:08:29 2015 UTC,"Collectors Edition was a physical copy that had Journey, Flower, and Flow if I remember correctly (don't have it but have seen it in stores)"
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,fieldstudies,2,Tue Jul 21 17:01:34 2015 UTC,You own the digital PS3 version?
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,CA719,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:43 2015 UTC,Of course.
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,Spottybag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:11:18 2015 UTC,"Same here. I own the digital ps3 version but it's showing on the store as £11.99 or £9.59 with a 20% plus discount. I added it to my basket to see if it would show up as free, but it didn't. Are we sure it is free for those who bought it on ps3?"
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,ColinZealSE,6,Tue Jul 21 00:54:27 2015 UTC,"Yes. This has been confirmed a few times. They did the same thing with Flower.   We'll just have to wait until the store updates properly. These kinds of things happen all the time. All PS+ games don't turn up at the same time, prices aren't correct etc. We'll just have to wait a while."
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,Barl0we,2,Tue Jul 21 01:02:46 2015 UTC,It's showing up as free to me :)
PlayStationPlus,3e08mm,Cali030,3,Tue Jul 21 06:23:53 2015 UTC,"For me as well, Europe. Well, it doensn't show up for free but when you go to the pay section it won't charge you for it."

PlayStationPlus,3dz8vv,Ratjar,3,Mon Jul 20 20:42:09 2015 UTC,Is it only day 1? I'm PS+ since Month 1 :(
PlayStationPlus,3dz8vv,bigd5783,16,Mon Jul 20 22:34:43 2015 UTC,You know. This is bull shit. I have been a sub since day 1 then last year my PS+ lapsed for 1 day because my credit card I used changed and that was the one place I forgot to update it. So I corrected the issue and it continued. I never got an email.
PlayStationPlus,3dz8vv,Heratiki,2,Mon Jul 20 20:51:45 2015 UTC,Same. Mine was because the first Christmas after I got it I wanted to continue it using a store card instead of charging my card. This was before I knew it would stack.
PlayStationPlus,3dz8vv,Sicmay,3,Mon Jul 20 22:38:12 2015 UTC,You mean the certificate to display on your wall?It was in a blog/forum post a while back and posted here

PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,MarkusGisdol,25,Tue Jul 21 08:01:41 2015 UTC,"To clarify, OP is saying what the Games with Live Gold are for next month (Ryse, Catherine, F:NV and Slash Dash).  As for PS+ offerings in August, I'm not too sure. The past two months have been pretty good in my opinion (Driveclub demo finally showed up, MGSV:GZ, Skulls of the Shogun, Rocket League etc) so hopefully they'll keep up the trend. Killzone has already been on JPN PS+ so that might finally surface for NA/EU players. Perhaps the God of War PSP collection for Vita/PS3 owners?  Would like to see Knack or Shadow Warrior for PS4 but doubt we'll get either."
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,BokuNoPickle,16,Tue Jul 21 10:51:13 2015 UTC,I do not understand wanting Knack....the game was awful. I'm almost convinced everyone wants Knack so once they have it they can just bitch about how bad it is.
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,xaq57,6,Tue Jul 21 17:23:10 2015 UTC,"People want Knack because they seem to think that it'll mark the introduction of full retail games, which can be completely dismissed by the fact that Injustice was given out almost 6 months ago."
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,SpaZticHero,6,Tue Jul 21 19:57:01 2015 UTC,"Or Metal Gear recently for that matter, I understand that's not as big, but it's still a AAA game."
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,xaq57,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:25:55 2015 UTC,I want Knack cause I want to try it and not pay for it.
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,Redarmy1917,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:27:43 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I'm aware of Knack's reputation. That being said, it's a very cheap exclusive title and I have wanted to try it for a while now. Not enough to go out and buy it, but enough to download it if it ended up on PS+"
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,BokuNoPickle,17,Tue Jul 21 22:04:49 2015 UTC,The releases on Games with Gold never seem to reflect what we receive on PS+.

PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,CrateBagSoup,23,Tue Jul 21 14:07:23 2015 UTC,I would like Knack so people can stop predicting Knack every month.
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,Ikarus3426,9,Tue Jul 21 15:13:57 2015 UTC,"it could be like The Last Guardian of PS+. Always rumored. eventually demanded. and then at E3 2020 they can come out on stage. Mark Cerny comes out. ""We've heard your cries... coming to PS+ in July 2023... Knack!"" and the crowd goes wild!"
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,docbauies,2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:59 2015 UTC,they will need a good title to demonstrate the backwards compatibility of the ps5
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,xavis,2,Tue Jul 21 20:17:47 2015 UTC,Knack isn't even that good. Why do people want it so bad?
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,hunka130,0,Tue Jul 21 22:48:02 2015 UTC,Knack wasn't a terrible game either. I would have been excited to get it for free.

PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,AlessandroManno,6,Tue Jul 21 14:11:31 2015 UTC,"The people who are asking for knack are those who probably haven't played it and are curious what the fuss about it was since it was Cerny's game.     Speaking as someone who owns it, it is a good thing it has never appeared as a PS+ game as it is genuinely a bad game. It's clear what Cerny was focusing his attention on and it clearly was not knack."
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,EvilMonkeySlayer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:24 2015 UTC,"Because at some point, they'll put more AAA... and the first AAA they'll put out is one people aren't really buying, like Knack."
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,Romiress,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:47 2015 UTC,"Injustice was the first AAA allllllll the way back in december. You're right though, nobody was buying it at the time."
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,APhanpy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:23:22 2015 UTC,"Because it's an easy guess. It'll certainly be a PS plus at some point. But it is pretty annoying since no one really wants it that much, just for bored curiosity."
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,Ikarus3426,5,Tue Jul 21 15:15:24 2015 UTC,Catherine was already given out for free on PS+.

PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,WeirdAlCapone,2,Tue Jul 21 12:26:27 2015 UTC,"So with Xbox One's new backwards compatibility, does that mean every game 360 gets for GwG the Xbone gets also?"
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,Lightfooot,3,Tue Jul 21 14:00:57 2015 UTC,"The backwards compatibility is going to be on a game-by-game basis, just like Xbox 360's backwards compatibility with Xbox, so there's no guarantee.  However, I would think Microsoft would want to do their best to select only games that are or will be backwards compatible, because that gives them an edge when people are deciding between Xbox One and PS4."

PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,CODBLOPS3,2,Tue Jul 21 13:49:16 2015 UTC,When my PS+ rans out I won't be renewing I don't have PS4 and they just gave up on giving really good games to PS3 owners

PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,necepticon,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"Some potential games, and my reasons...  Killzone: Shadow Fall  It was a launch day title that's exclusive to PS4, and it was given out as a free title for PS+ Subscribers.  Wolfenstein: The New Order  It's over a year old and fairly cheap.  The Last of Us: Remastered  The Last of Us is over two years old, and the remastered version is about one year old. Considering that the title was also given for free to people who bought a PS4 during a certain period of time, I think Sony could give out The Last of Us: Remastered without losing too much money. Also, it's a PlayStation exclusive and it was very well received, meaning it could allow people to have faith in PS+ again.  The Last of Us: Left Behind (Standalone)  The Last of Us: Left Behind could be a PS+ title for all of the reasons why The Last of Us: Remastered could be a PS+ title. It's also a smaller game that is cheaper to purchase, and would cost Sony even less money to give away.  Trials Fusion  It's over a year old and fairly cheap.  Shovel Knight  I think this is unlikely, because it did just come out a few months ago on PS4, but it's also fairly cheap, and it's been out for over a year on other platforms.  I hope we get another AAA title this month."

PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,obi5683,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:09 2015 UTC,is the PS Plus announcement today ? because i'm sure the monthly update is for next week Tuesday so 1 week left should mean we get the announcement today right ?
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,CODBLOPS3,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:01 2015 UTC,"No. The announcement will be on July 29th and games will be available on August 4th. I was just saying that The Vanishing of Ethan Carter just came out so we won't see it for PS+ for a while. Shovel Knight came out a few months back and it was not announced as a PS+ title yet. IIRC, if an indie game is not offered on PS+ on its release day, we usually don't see it on PS+ until after it has been out for a bit. Otherwise Sony would have a lot of angry customers."

Other than that I get the feeling the first AAA title will be Need for Speed Rivals. It's on sale for 14,99 right now and Need for Speed games have most of the time been on PS+. Probably Child of Light as well, that has been down to 3 bucks.  I wish the PS3 would get some good titles again, actual AAA would be nice. I'd be really pissed if I only owned a PS3 and got stuff like MouseCraft. It used to be one AAA title for the PS3 every month and I was happy with that."

PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,turtle_mummy,-4,Tue Jul 21 16:22:08 2015 UTC,PS3 will never get any free AAA games again because not only do Sony want to start phasing it out but mainly because PS3 owners didn't cause any riot while the quality dropped so Sony will think they can get away with it now.
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,CODBLOPS3,2,Tue Jul 21 13:51:30 2015 UTC,I miss when games like Bioshock infinite and Tomb Raider was free for PS+ I'm hoping something that caliber. But we will probably just be getting mostly indies which I'm okay with as long as i don't already own them and they're fun.
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,Adampro123,2,Tue Jul 21 14:16:07 2015 UTC,"I let my subscription expire on PS3 after months of games I personally didn't wish to play.

PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,BlueBlurX,3,Tue Jul 21 11:26:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think PS4 will ever be backwards compatible as long as PS Now lives... I think Sony actually said it, they said something like ""We tried backwards compatibility with PS3 and it wasn't used, so we won't do it again with PS4"" (Not the exact words, but something very similar)"
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,Ramiro21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:35 2015 UTC,how was backwards compatibility removed because no one was playing them ? Sony removed BC because PS3 software sales were awful as people were just playing PS2 games on PS3 and they wanted people playing and paying for PS3 games.  also if people didn't care about old games then why does PS Now even exist. at the very least they should give us PS1 and PS2 emulation or at least downloads from PSN. so many PS1 and PS2 classics i downloaded on PS3 i can't play anymore but i can't bring myself to buy another PS3.
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,CODBLOPS3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:23:05 2015 UTC,wasn't only the only backwards compatible PS3 an EU-exclusive 60 GB model? it's hardly like there were tons of people only playing PS2 games on PS3.
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,the_tytan,-1,Tue Jul 21 23:32:43 2015 UTC,"I would love PS Plus to have two options.   $50 a year - for up to six games a month & online, cloud storage, etc  Or   $50 a year - for one game voucher (redeemable for any game) & online, cloud storage, etc.  That way, the ones who enjoy the variety can have it. And the ones who think they are owed AAA games can have one. And shut the hell up."
PlayStationPlus,3e1rfz,icon365,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:20 2015 UTC,"The only problem is that it would cost Sony much more to have the second option, because then they'd have to make a deal with every company for their games. It just wouldn't work. They way they have it now is they make a deal with companies for certain games so that it costs them much less, therefore saving them money. It wouldn't make sense for Sony to have the second option unless the game was under $20 or something, which then they would pay the Company the actual price of the game minus Sony's cuts that they normally take."

If they continue that trend, I would assume it will be free on the PS4 for anyone who bought it on an older system.  At the same time, this could be the first time they don't do that, but I also can't pre-order it, so it looks like it will probably be free for previous owners once it comes out."

In that case, does that happen to normal heads too, it's just that we don't know it because the hair covers the scalpwrinkles? Are we all secretly as wrinkly as a Sphynx cats under our hair? Does every bald man have a secret that they literally wear in the open? Does a scalp get more wrinkly with age, like a face?    I just thought bald heads were as smooth as a baby's bottom, even when massaged, but then again I have never massaged a bald scalp. I guess I never even considered scalp wrinkles."

PlayStationPlus,3dspt9,panterra74055,17,Sun Jul 19 02:19:26 2015 UTC,Somewhere in the settings there is an option to set your PS4 as your primary PS4. Do this on your Plus account and any other PSN account on the console will be able to play online and play the + games downloaded from the IGC.

They get the codes directly from Sony, not via a third party source."

Are all the letters in the code uppercase? Because if not, sometimes the ""L"" looks like the letter ""I"" when it's lowercase. Also remove the dashes from the code if you haven't already. Other than that I really don't know what else you can do to make it work. Good luck."

PlayStationPlus,3dk18x,Gmercy,3,Thu Jul 16 23:13:08 2015 UTC,I believe it's whichever person/acct/controller opens the application.  I have it happen to me and my gf all the time where like we're trying to watch Hulu plus and it's like join now when I already have an acct but since we launched from her screen it treats her as a new user.  It should be the same with games to just closing the app and launching from the correct user screen/controller.

PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,HotBeefyMcD,3,Fri Jul 17 19:33:26 2015 UTC,Word of caution guys my gut tells me something from this will be igc soon. I'd be cautious of any deals that seem suspeciously low especially the indies they might be trying to scrounch a few remaining bucks from. Just sayin
PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,peterkozmd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:34:45 2015 UTC,Totally agree.  This list also has some previous ICG games in it.  Always a gamble and a game of chicken with these flash sales.
PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,mesenkomaha,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:39:19 2015 UTC,what was previously IGC?
PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,gpost86,2,Thu Jul 16 16:49:56 2015 UTC,"Futuridium, The Swapper, Titan Attack, Race the Sun"

PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,lveg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:14:12 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. every other telltale game has been on sale but that one and it was on sale last week on the xbox so i had hopes PSN would follow
PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,Adampro123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:38:49 2015 UTC,will probably pick up Hyperdevotion Noire.

PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,PAULSAMSON,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:52:07 2015 UTC,Agreed. I've been waiting for it to hit 20 bucks or less without the dlc. It also strikes me as a game that fits into the tier of games that end up on IGC.
PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,WorkerMurphey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:09:01 2015 UTC,Part of me hopes for another flash sale like there was last year with loads of stuff for under a dollar XD Not going to happen with this one but maybe sometime..

PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,qigger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:22:26 2015 UTC,Prices are being updated. Hyperdevotion Noire - $16 Ar nosurge - $20. Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut - $6  Can I play Deus Ex: Human Revolution without playing any other game in the series?
PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,DaxterAttano,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:19:21 2015 UTC,"You can play HR without playing the others first. It's a prequel. I do recommend you check out the first game, it really is a classic."
PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,jrrock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:05:55 2015 UTC,"Human Revolution is fantastic for $6. Get it if you don't own it.  Opinions on Bulletstorm, Resonance of Fate and Metal Gear Rising?"

PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,peterkozmd,0,Thu Jul 16 00:46:59 2015 UTC,If they ever make Alien's Colonial Marines less than a dollar I might buy it simply out of a morbid curiousity.
PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,htallen,4,Thu Jul 16 03:08:35 2015 UTC,Don't.
PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,sedkiller,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:11:02 2015 UTC,Just curious. Is this the game that had some trailers out ages and ages ago that had land sharks in them?
PlayStationPlus,3dfes7,badamo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:52:51 2015 UTC,Why is Colonial Marines even on the list? There's no discount on it whatsoever.
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,Matthew0606,2,Fri Jul 17 04:32:07 2015 UTC,"Bedlam look pretty freaking funky, wouldn't mind that!"
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,Mobydeux,-1,Fri Jul 17 07:34:45 2015 UTC,Gotta hand it to them on the art styles.
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,Ayyylien,2,Fri Jul 17 17:55:22 2015 UTC,"Zombie Vikings looks creepy AF but I'd like it as a free game. Reminds me of ""Stick It To The Man""."
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,01luca01,0,Fri Jul 17 11:16:27 2015 UTC,"Well if it gets an August 4th release, good chance it will be a free game."
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:54:18 2015 UTC,"Steam version of Bedlam was bundled a couple months ago, so I think it could be a realistic prediction for august igc."
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,JT-Lionheart,-1,Fri Jul 17 10:13:06 2015 UTC,Someone agrees with me on this.
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,ombus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:54:53 2015 UTC,"Apparently looking at games coming out soon, on August 4th, Galak-Z the Dimensional comes out only on PS4, later for Vita, and then later for PC. Something tells me this is our new indie game for Plus next month. Also it's a game that Sony has been pushing out as a indie game for the PS4. We saw this game during their E3 conference two years ago. Also the same devs behind another Plus game, Skulls of the Shogun. Most indie games Sony has advertised especially in 2013 during E3 usually are new indie games on Plus and this game totally looks like PS4 Plus indie game material."
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,kstar891,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:17:35 2015 UTC,Exactly! But that game is on sale so it's out.
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,Jamesbuc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:02:59 2015 UTC,Ah s**t I forgot it was part of that pre order sale going on. That's weird because that game is a new indie game but oh well.
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,Jamesbuc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:29:21 2015 UTC,Yep. Still keep an up eye on indies for August 4th.
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,jemunoz2,0,Sun Jul 19 00:34:36 2015 UTC,i hope neither

PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,eifersucht12a,-2,Fri Jul 17 04:40:31 2015 UTC,I think it will be. It has a very distinctive style from the trailer. It ain't trying to be the next Halo.  https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/3da9g7/ps_plus_igc_free_games_conspiracy_theories/
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,Whats-his-nuts,-4,Fri Jul 17 04:43:11 2015 UTC,May want to look at that.
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,GroundTar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:43:24 2015 UTC,Bedlam comes out mid-august on both Xbox One and Ps4 so if anything that's more likely to be released on the Xbox One Games with Gold front.  Zombie Vikings I can see being released over PS+ though given its nature.
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,GroundTar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:06:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but still Bedlam if it gets an August 4th release, it could be free, as I did notice a pattern from the conspiracy theories I found out."
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,GroundTar,2,Fri Jul 17 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"But its not getting a August 4th release, its getting a release around the middle of August for both consoles. The Parity clause stuff on Microsofts side usually forces some of these to release at least a month apart and since that isn't happening, it means that its releasing on both around the same time (like 'The Fall' released this week for both Ps4 and Xbox One the same week)"
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,GroundTar,0,Fri Jul 17 18:06:56 2015 UTC,"Well then Zombie Vikings is more likely to be guarantee then, but I notice on Playstation Lifestyle that it is to come out in August 2015, but it never told us a date, so it could be August 4th still. We don't know that, and maybe Sony may release the game on Ps Plus without telling us when it was going to be released and what not."
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,GroundTar,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:12:56 2015 UTC,Yay!! more Indies!
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:43:37 2015 UTC,"I know. I don't hate them, and I don't know about you. This isn't a exact answer but I am really feeling it will be if by any means either or both games get a August 4th release."
PlayStationPlus,3dl95d,JT-Lionheart,2,Fri Jul 17 04:44:48 2015 UTC,"Dont care about the indies so much, varies up my collection and exposes me to different stuff  Just want good ones. No artsy non-game crap like proteus. Walking simulators and hipster crap trying to pass for actual gameplay"
PlayStationPlus,3ddb9l,cscsabee,3,Wed Jul 15 11:11:58 2015 UTC,I got £25 PSN credit for my birthday and I really haven't wanted to spend it on any of these sales lately =/

PlayStationPlus,3ddb9l,conir_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:55:20 2015 UTC,I'm looking at Spelunky (PS4) because I missed it when it was part of IGC. Is it worth those €3?
PlayStationPlus,3ddb9l,01luca01,7,Wed Jul 15 14:17:32 2015 UTC,"I vote yes. Definitely. It's not really difficult it just takes time to learn but once you're there you can't stop. Basically, if you're up for the challenges then go for it.. but keep in mind you'll die a LOT. I think I finished it at +400 deaths the first time.. and that's with ""skip finished worlds"" and not from zero to end. Also it has some great secrets."
PlayStationPlus,3ddb9l,G-H-O-S-T,3,Wed Jul 15 14:46:28 2015 UTC,"I really loved The Binding of Isaac and Rogue Legacy, they're easily my favourite indies, so I think dying a lot is not a problem for me."
PlayStationPlus,3ddb9l,01luca01,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:58:25 2015 UTC,"Great, but keep in mind that unlike these two Spelunky doesn't have anything carry over."
PlayStationPlus,3ddb9l,G-H-O-S-T,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:52:49 2015 UTC,Isn't it the same with TBoI?
PlayStationPlus,3ddb9l,01luca01,2,Thu Jul 16 06:41:03 2015 UTC,"Well to some degree, yes. Though in BoI you unlock stuff and can get them in later runs.. sometimes you get the op stuff and make the run a breeze.. Spelunky however there isn't such a thing and you have the same 'advantage' as someone just starting.. the only thing that will help you is your knowledge and strategy.. and some luck :p"
PlayStationPlus,3ddb9l,G-H-O-S-T,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:55:11 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, that makes sense. In TBoI a lot of items unlocked in previous runs could make much easier the next ones."
PlayStationPlus,3ddb9l,01luca01,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:12:52 2015 UTC,Yes it is
PlayStationPlus,3ddb9l,farhadk,2,Thu Jul 16 06:56:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's an amazing game, one of my most played games on my vita. If you like roguelites then this is the game for you."
PlayStationPlus,3ddb9l,triedtostayaway,3,Wed Jul 15 23:10:29 2015 UTC,"To be honest, no. Being difficult is one thing, but being unfairly and frustratingly hard is not something I enjoy.  It's fun to learn the mechanics of everything in it, but it just got old way too fast for me and from there on it was purely a headache-inducing experience.  Most of the people seem to love it and it has decent scores in reviews, but it's definitely not for me."
PlayStationPlus,3ddb9l,ColinZealSE,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:27:43 2015 UTC,I really really wanted to love this game... tried the demo on PS3 a few times but I never really got into it. Until I understood that I was supposed to speedrun the levels. That's when it clicked. Amazing amazing game.
PlayStationPlus,3ddb9l,amnesicpachyderm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:02:00 2015 UTC,Depends on whether you're into those types of games. You liked rogue legacy? Then spelunky is definitely 100℅ worth it.

PlayStationPlus,3de7p0,T_diddles,5,Wed Jul 15 16:06:30 2015 UTC,"to answer your question, yes. if you subscribe to PS+ using a new account then you will lose access to the PS+ games associated with the account that came with the PS4 (let's call it old account).   however, as long as you have the log in information to the old account you will still be able to use the games that were paid for (such as bloodborne and far cry 4). if the subscription lapses, you will only lose access to the ps+ games.  my suggestion is that unless you are extremely interested in the PS+ games that the old account has access to, you should create a new account and buy the ps+ subscription on it (be sure to pick up rocket league before the end of the month).  then you should make the ps4 the primary console for the old account. this will allow you to play bloodborne, far cry 4 (and any other games that were paid for) on your new account.  hope that helps and welcome to the club!"
PlayStationPlus,3de7p0,name-lastname,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:36:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you, exactly the answer I was looking for. There are only 5 or 6 games from the subscription in the old account, so I guess I'll let it lapse. I've already been playing Rocket League on it today and is fantastic fun. I'll need to get my own subscription going this month to make sure I keep it!"
PlayStationPlus,3de7p0,name-lastname,2,Wed Jul 15 18:56:22 2015 UTC,glad i could help! enjoy your PS4!
PlayStationPlus,3de7p0,Dyryn83,3,Wed Jul 15 20:09:31 2015 UTC,You could consider paying for the plus on the current account and starting a new 'main' account for yourself since PS+ online play and games are shared with the other profiles on the system (for example my wife's account can play online and use my games since my PS+ account has the console set as it's main).
PlayStationPlus,3de7p0,D3adkl0wn,2,Wed Jul 15 16:34:26 2015 UTC,"Get the account info from the original seller and change it all over to your own email, passwords and recovery options.    It's pretty easy for someone to decide that they want their account back and then you don't have access to that stuff they sold you (account and games associated with that account) anymore."
PlayStationPlus,3de7p0,corruptheretic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:57:55 2015 UTC,"That was the first thing I did one I had the console set up at home. Thanks for the warning, though."
PlayStationPlus,3de7p0,corruptheretic,2,Wed Jul 15 22:06:27 2015 UTC,Currently the old owner has your console set as their primary console. At some point in the cure they may get a new system and deactivate their profile on yours.    Bottom line. You may end up losing access at some point in the future regardless
PlayStationPlus,3dglz4,naylord,2,Thu Jul 16 02:50:32 2015 UTC,I know it's a great game but a 9/10 by Gamespot is surprising!
PlayStationPlus,3dglz4,alishan01,-4,Thu Jul 16 07:47:24 2015 UTC,Must have used that server money for this. Huh?
PlayStationPlus,3dglz4,LukeNeverShaves,-9,Thu Jul 16 08:59:12 2015 UTC,"The game is fantastic, one of the best PS4 games I have played so far, but in this status it really doesn't deserve more than a 5/10. There is no excuse for the servers still not working after more than a week. Imagine paying 20 bucks for it and not being really able to play for this long. Indie company or not, get your shit together."
PlayStationPlus,3dglz4,profanitymyass,5,Thu Jul 16 13:08:21 2015 UTC,Online has been working great for me so far. I remember launch day I couldn't play though but other than that it's been fine.

PlayStationPlus,3dglz4,SlawKing,4,Fri Jul 17 02:19:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you, but I've only ever experienced server issues in this game for minutes at a time. They're usually resolved by the time I play a single exhibition match. That's certainly not enough to drop it to a 5 in my opinion."

PlayStationPlus,3dfpja,barney2013,2,Thu Jul 16 03:50:00 2015 UTC,"Just be careful buying games on the internet. Always got to make sure it's a PAL game.

Amazing visuals and such a fun sense of style. Flying the ship feels so right and the combat is so hectic in such a good way. Can't wait!

The good news is, if it sells well enough on PS4, we hope to be able to port N++ to Vita — we love the Vita and think it would be awesome to play N++ on it! The N+ code is 6 years old at this point, and the company that ported it has long gone under (and so has Atari), so it probably doesn’t even exist anymore. N++ is a MUCH better game though, so that’s what we’d be porting if given the chance. Fingers crossed!"""

PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,biil5,10,Tue Jul 14 21:07:56 2015 UTC,It's worth it if you're planning on buying a PS4 soon enough since you'd have been collecting a nice backlog of games ready to be downloaded.
PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,purplepur,11,Tue Jul 14 22:16:00 2015 UTC,No. The quality of games we get has steadily dropped over the last year and you don't need it to play online. My sub ended a few months back and I honestly haven't missed it.
PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,ShannyBoy,3,Tue Jul 14 22:39:15 2015 UTC,"Mine expired back in December. I let it go. I don't have as much time to play games as I used to, much less 3 ""free"" games a month. I also slightly was pissed they didn't have a Black Friday sale. But, I digress. It seems I have not missed it, but like I said, I don't have much time to play. I'd rather just buy what I want to play and go from there. I still think its ""worth it"" in terms of what you get though."
PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,DarthCaligula,4,Tue Jul 14 22:46:55 2015 UTC,Well the PS3 only benefit from cross play games and some old AAA games. The past couple months the PS3 has got some old decent AAA games. The PS4 has been getting new indie games every month and it seems that's where the money going towards Plus is aimed at.
PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,JT-Lionheart,3,Wed Jul 15 00:54:25 2015 UTC,"It really isn't unless u wanna play some ps+ games that were released earlier. This year has not been good, the last 4 months alone we basically had dishonored and gunslinger which is nothing special. for 1/3rd of the sub (4months out of 12...) you could have bought Dishonored, keep it (PS+ is a rent) and still have money left.  I already started playing games from ps+ that i still want to, i won't be renewing mine in september, not worth it for a ps3 only player."
PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,heisenbergfan,2,Tue Jul 14 23:11:40 2015 UTC,"For the games with the sub probably not that much. But if you spend regularly on digital games its worth it just for the sales. Heck, even if you only pick 2-3 games from the IGC through the year that justifies the subscription on its own and its bound to have something along the year for your tastes."

PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,Chef_Lebowski,3,Wed Jul 15 04:58:59 2015 UTC,At least in the Year that I have had PS+ it seems like the PS3 always gets the best games. Just last month they gave Cloudberry kingdom. Earlier this year they gave away Thief and Prototype 2. It all depends in the games you are into.
PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,Poor_Hobo,2,Tue Jul 14 21:16:33 2015 UTC,Its the only system still getting good AAAs almost monthly. I dont see they stopping the good games on PS3 yet.
PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,grbolivar,2,Tue Jul 14 21:22:12 2015 UTC,"This month was embarasing. Last month gunslinger sort of saved it. Ps3 will notmbe getting aaa games anymore, MMW."
PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,Issune91,2,Tue Jul 14 21:49:43 2015 UTC,Its the only system still getting good AAAs almost monthly   ??? The only AAA title in the last 4 months was Dishonored.
PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,heisenbergfan,5,Tue Jul 14 23:09:38 2015 UTC,"Dishonored, Thief, Yakuza 4, Gunslinger, Sherlock Holmes, Prototype 2. Avg. 0.85 AAA/mo."
PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,grbolivar,2,Tue Jul 14 23:22:21 2015 UTC,"gunslinger is certainly not an AAA game, even tho i enjoyed it.  Prototype - January Thief + Yakuza - February Sherlock holmes - March (also not an AAA game btw) Dishonored - April May - nothing June - nothing (gunslinger, if u count average games) July - Nothing  So basically it is about the decline in quality, every AAA you mentioned came until February, except Dishonored that came out in April, great game btw, but not worth the rent for 1/4th of the subscription. The decline is pretty clear to me."
PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,heisenbergfan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:12:01 2015 UTC,"Of course Gunslinger and Sherlock Holmes are AAA, they had publishers and were developed by big teams. We have always gotten an avg of 1 AAA game per month on PS3, maybe the quality has decreased a bit (not IMO), but still we get good games on PS3."
PlayStationPlus,3dauz2,grbolivar,-1,Wed Jul 15 01:29:49 2015 UTC,"gunslinger is  a PSN game that was released for $19.99 i think. Game is fun but also a bit simple. Very small production.  Sherlock Holmes is an awful game, sorry. I have the plat trophy, so i finished it ofc, but that game sucks.  Neither one is an AAA, your standards are ridiculously low.   We have always gotten an avg of 1 AAA game per month on PS3   You cant judge the current state by saying that we used to get good games in the past, makes no sense. I just showed you the months up there, nothing lately.   maybe the quality has decreased a bit (not IMO), but still we get good games on PS3.   If you compare 2014's lineup with 2015's and don't think that the quality has decreased A LOT, specially in these last few months, there is something really wrong with ur judgement, no offense."

PlayStationPlus,3d9qo3,G-Honda,2,Tue Jul 14 16:38:47 2015 UTC,Well they at first told me to check details were the same and to contact the bank- but details are right and as I explained above dont need to contact bank.  They then said I could buy top-up in a store - I don't want to do that because I want to take advantage of the paypal offer. the most recent reply I got from Sony said they didnt know why it was failing originally but I now have a 48hour potential fraud block on my account.
PlayStationPlus,3d9qo3,c-a-sefton,2,Tue Jul 14 16:42:51 2015 UTC,I had this problem a while ago. Even though I had given the bank all my new details and updated it on the system for some reason the correspondence on their system referred back to my old one. Paypal uses the correspondence address to match up. It might be worth trying an old address on your Paypal account to see if that is the case. If it is you can order using your old address or you can get in touch with your bank to make sure correspondence address online and on their system is the right one. It will then match up with your new address.   I know how you feel it took me ages to find this out as all my bank screens showed my new address it was one of their background ones that had my old address and there was nothing online stating this resolution.
PlayStationPlus,3d9qo3,thatlad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:16:02 2015 UTC,Thanks- I might check with Sony what address they have on file
PlayStationPlus,3d6e8m,coolcon2000,6,Mon Jul 13 21:51:16 2015 UTC,"I don't believe you get grandfathered in that way, but someone can feel free to correct me. If it does work, you would just need to find the game on the PSN and it should say free."
PlayStationPlus,3d6e8m,Quick_Over_There,2,Tue Jul 14 00:25:48 2015 UTC,"I actually just got 2 of the games that were mentioned below, Resogun and Oddworld, so it looks like it works."
PlayStationPlus,3d6e8m,marimba1982,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:59:05 2015 UTC,Resogun was released afterwards so that will be why its on PS3 (and vita). Maybe Oddworld N&T and Don't starve also. Doubt there are many others- they'd have had to get a ps4 release first AND be cross-buy
PlayStationPlus,3d6e8m,Sicmay,3,Tue Jul 14 16:37:08 2015 UTC,"""Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty"" is the only one I know of and possibly ""Don't Starve"" but I didn't have PS+ when that one hit the IGC.

PlayStationPlus,3d6e8m,chinese_medicine,3,Tue Jul 14 00:47:34 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure I got Resogun for PS3 for free sometime well after it was on PS+ for PS4.
PlayStationPlus,3d6e8m,CleverFunnyName,2,Tue Jul 14 02:45:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, Resogun was Free on PS4, then when it came out on PS3/Vita, if you had it from PS4, you got it for free."

PlayStationPlus,3d56am,OneOfDozens,3,Thu Jul 16 17:58:08 2015 UTC,It's worth buying. I got it for like $7.50 in a sale earlier this year. Very fun game and was very much worth the price
PlayStationPlus,3d56am,Selykg,4,Mon Jul 13 20:51:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe because the PS4 version came out about half a year ago and they want to be fair to people who bought the game while still giving others the opportunity to try it. I preordered it for PS4 and I'm happy I now got it for Vita too. If you like it and want it on the big screen you can still buy it, it's well worth the price."

PlayStationPlus,3d56am,peterkozmd,2,Mon Jul 13 17:53:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, if you don't like the word ""fairness"" then perhaps from the term ""optics"" you can more easily find reason."
PlayStationPlus,3d56am,butt_stuff_savant,2,Tue Jul 14 00:43:40 2015 UTC,"The game is not cross buy, of course plenty of IGC games get cross buy enabled even when they weren't and you just have to claim both versions.  Of course, when sony is negotiating for a game they need to fill up 6 slots, and filling up the vita slot with the vita version of geometry wars was probably cheap because the dev saw little lost revenue. That is, vita is unpopular, so every vita owner not buying the game isn't much of a loss but the ps4 on the other hand is very popular so there's all the lost revenue to account for there. Thus they'd want probably like 3 times as much money to give away the ps4 version as well."

PlayStationPlus,3d56am,huff610,3,Tue Jul 14 03:37:19 2015 UTC,"In my experience, playing games on handheld devices, like the Gameboy, DS, Vita, etc, typically starts in a very relaxed sitting position with little to no neck strain, but usually ends up with me sitting down with my neck angled at a sharp 90 degrees looking at my device whilst it is in my lap.

PlayStationPlus,3d56am,IceBreak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:16:13 2015 UTC,"Because it's not a cross buy title.  Meaning even if you paid full price for one version, you didn't get the other ones free.  It's also a great game with a reputation behind, so it's probably still selling decently on the PS4 and thus the developers didn't want to give it away free on PS4 yet."
PlayStationPlus,3d56am,gregdoom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:11:22 2015 UTC,It's not a cross-buy game.  The only game to be cross-buy for PS+ in spite of that fact is Dragon's Crown.

PlayStationPlus,3d56am,Miobix,0,Thu Jul 16 17:58:51 2015 UTC,It's good but it should have been crossbuy to begin with.
PlayStationPlus,3da9g7,Matthew0606,6,Tue Jul 14 18:42:30 2015 UTC,"The reasons why we get only indies:   PS3: free AAAs on PS3 actually bring new customers to purchase the console (like me). Even as the PS3 is not the main focus for Sony today we still see AAAs on PS+ for PS3 almost monthly, although not at the same rate as 2-3 years ago. PS4: no need to lure new customers in to purchase PS4s with free AAA games as PS+ is required for online playing. I guess giving a AAA is costly to Sony, better give some Indies and reduce costs. Vita: almost no AAAs released in the past months, I think the only releases were a few Hyperdimension Neptunia games, which I guess are too recent to give for free. Plus, Sony knows Vita is almost dead, they may have no interest now to lure players to get one, yet it doesn't want to lose potential subscribers, so they throw in a bunch of Indies with the (very) occasional AAA on Vita."
PlayStationPlus,3da9g7,grbolivar,-4,Tue Jul 14 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"Good thing. I kinda went into detail on everything but I guess yours is a shorter version on what I said. What do you think of the crossbuy,day one theories?"
PlayStationPlus,3da9g7,grbolivar,0,Tue Jul 14 19:08:24 2015 UTC,"Personal opinions:   Cross-buy: the Store seems very strict, so if they are giving any cross-buy game for a system the Store automatically enables the purchase in the other systems, and maybe they don't have a way to circumvent this for specific games. Day one: they need to keep their promise of ""2 games per system per month"" and since they are going all Indie, Sony may resort to talk with any Indie dev they can get their hands on, even those that are still in development, signing contracts to release their games for PS+ ASAP, or maybe even coerce them (maybe this is why we see a lot of broken indies lately?)."
PlayStationPlus,3da9g7,grbolivar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:33:07 2015 UTC,"(Maybe not broken but games that might not spark interest.)  Ahhh! The crossbuy does allow wider audiences to get the games and stuff though,"
PlayStationPlus,3da9g7,farhadk,2,Tue Jul 14 19:35:54 2015 UTC,"A lot of Day-one Indies were/are broken: The Binding of Isaac, Apotheon, Ether One, Super Exploding Zoo, Duke Nukem, and a few others. Some of them (Ether One) seem like they were never tested at all before being released."
PlayStationPlus,3da9g7,GroundTar,0,Tue Jul 14 19:41:01 2015 UTC,"Thankfully many if not all got patches that fixed the problems so now all is well on them.  You know, with me making and thinking this it makes me wonder about next month's games."

PlayStationPlus,3da9g7,PSMOkizzle,0,Tue Jul 14 19:48:13 2015 UTC,Super Exploding Zoo was broken?
PlayStationPlus,3da9g7,PSMOkizzle,-2,Wed Jul 15 02:19:50 2015 UTC,"Do you think they should stop with the cross-buy, or is it a great idea to get indies out? Because if they do this in conjunction with the day one release if the game was well ready, it can bring more people to it."

PlayStationPlus,3d4fpo,EggsNbeans,3,Mon Jul 13 15:44:11 2015 UTC,I suspect they might just take the balance from the users PSN wallet if it has funds?

PlayStationPlus,3d60a1,Issune91,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:10:21 2015 UTC,Why so? They tend to do more than others.
PlayStationPlus,3d60a1,FREEBA,3,Tue Jul 14 14:34:55 2015 UTC,"My theory is that they are trying to kill the ps3 to get more people to move to ps4. 2nd reason is they tried it for the past months and since it's working and people aren't causing a riot, they have no reason to stop giving crappy indie game.

This month I only downloaded the games for ps3, launched them once, and deleted them. THAT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE... So dissapointed. Edit: Also for me it's more than obvious that ps3 wont be getting any AAA games anymore. They will abuse the indies as hard as they can, MMW."
PlayStationPlus,3d60a1,mistermoomoo1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:27:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and with the Vita games starting to fade more and more into obscurity, hell, I might as well admit it right now. Playstation Vita has turned into an indie gamers machine so Ps Plus can go straight on ahead and abuse the Vita with Indies. I don't mind as long it was worthwhile.  I also posted a theory that last month's games took alot of money since they were on the Ps4, like Ground Zeroes which should have not been the game, plus then we have an non-oifficial piece of cock known as Driveclub Ps Plus Edition, so since they had to spend so much money on those games, it is no wonder why we might be stuck with indies for the next several months all together, or hell all together for good.  Also, another big conspiriacy theory on the IGC matter is since Ps4 Ps Plus is needed for online play, I bet on the IGC part they found an escape clause by now that will allow only indies or lesser known titles (like Styx which is amazing) to be put on the system forever with no more triple A. If Sony really wants to do this, they might as well call the service.  ""Indie Game Collection!""  Personally to me I don't mind just as along as the game is good and keeps my interest but there are many theories to this whole IGC matter."

If you're a trophy hunting type it's a pretty easy plat, if you're just looking to pass time on a good game, this may or may not be the game for you, depends on how much you like stealth elements. It wasn't too bad in my opinion, worth a try, but not memorable.  Rocket league is very fun, an even easier plat, takes up minimal space and doesn't get boring very fast. I'm not sure if I'd say it lives up to aaall the hype I've been seeing around but it's definitely a solid game.  On a side note, if any of you are looking for tournaments for this game, this thread is a good place to start"

PlayStationPlus,3ctw8m,01luca01,3,Sat Jul 11 22:06:51 2015 UTC,"I think the only way to improve is by playing over and over. I started with some online matches in which I barely hit the ball so I gave up and begun a pro season, with an average first one and a way better second one. Then I made a few online matches and I was easily the mvp or so. That said, the online mode is still not so unforgiving so I think you could learn there the basics and the ball physics."

I'm pretty good at the game with a 70% win rate with over two goals scored average per game according to the stats page so I'm not saying this because I'm salty and bad at the game.  Something just feels off these last two days and I don't have that urge to play the game as much."

I can do some spectacular things and some stupid things in the same game, but I'll be laughing and shouting at the TV the whole time, and will finish each game with a massive grin on my face.  Online was a bit dodgy at first, but it's been perfect for me since then.  Not sure if that's due to sticking with the Oceania and Euro regions only, but it finds matches quickly for me and there is no lag so it plays great!"

PlayStationPlus,3ctw8m,Seventy_Seven,0,Sat Jul 11 03:11:21 2015 UTC,"Rocket League had quickly become the most fun game available on the PS4. I'd go as far to say it's the best game on the console, imo. maybe because it's up against a kinda slim library"

For those who don't know, this game is a prequel that takes place in the world of Of Orcs and Men which was a action rpg released in 2012.

I've had guys walk right pass me, and then I've had guys see me from twenty feet away and through two feet of solid stone while I was standing completely still.  It's like some of these fuckers have x-ray vision or like really good sense of smell, and some of them are deaf dumb and half blind.  The AI is unreliable... which is the only thing more annoying than falling to death because Styx deemed a beam of wood too dirty for his dainty little hands to grab onto."

The first level is essentially a prolonged sewer level - I fucking hate levels like that.   I bought it just after playing through Dishonoured because I wanted another stealth game. It's nowhere near as good as Dishonoured though. Still fun.

I was excited for this game.  I liked the idea of a third person fantasy stealth game.  But, I swear the game is so fucking cheap... it needs debugging and some tighter systems for how humans detect you so it doesn't seem so fucking random."

PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,caseythebuffalo,2,Thu Jul 9 04:37:25 2015 UTC,"It was XIII and XIII-2 actually, but yeah trophies were tied into theme unlocks for the PS3, it was a really cool system."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Addfwyn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:33:01 2015 UTC,Noticed that literally 2 seconds before you commented lol
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,caseythebuffalo,130,Thu Jul 9 05:40:54 2015 UTC,They shouldn't charge for a fucking wallpaper and a few icons in 2015.
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Dickwang,46,Wed Jul 8 11:33:08 2015 UTC,They should actually let us make our own themes!  Why can't we customise our ps4 interfaces? It's not like we could break anything.
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Techloss,14,Wed Jul 8 11:37:47 2015 UTC,"Custom Backgrounds like for a desktop PC shouldn't be an issue but making proper themes/interfaces might require a dev kit+some expertise. There's a guy on neogaf who demonstrated some themes he's working on and might put it up for free if he wishes, he said somewhere that he has to keep note of memory allocations since the OS has limited resources to work with but he made some pretty good looking ones even though most of them are with mockup UI's."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,CaptainCapybara,3,Wed Jul 8 11:48:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, those look great, and put most of the current ""1 Awesome Dynamic Theme"" garbage to shame."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Techloss,3,Wed Jul 8 12:16:11 2015 UTC,Those geometric ones are absolutely awesome and much MUCH clearer than some of the godawful themes on PSN currently.
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,_meppz,2,Wed Jul 8 13:02:23 2015 UTC,"Man, that PS2 cube theme is really cool and i'd definitely buy it"
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,mesenkomaha,7,Wed Jul 8 23:15:02 2015 UTC,I recall being able to download free themes from the web on my ps3.  They locked that shit down I guess on the 4.  Pretty lame.
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,triedtostayaway,3,Wed Jul 8 16:18:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Sony has been doing a ton of shit that shouldn't fly in 2015 and yet they're selling ps4s like gangbusters."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Wanled,3,Thu Jul 9 00:01:45 2015 UTC,I love the way Xbox one has it where you can make your own using Screenshots or by getting achievements.  Hopefully Sony follows what they're doing but as long as people are willing to spend 3-4$ I won't be hopeful
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,silver_wasp,2,Wed Jul 8 22:28:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed! PS3 had customizable themes and wallpapers! It feels like Sony is just going too far with money grabbing now. You couldn't use your own music in game for the longest time either, you had to use their stupid expensive service."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,junkit33,-6,Wed Jul 8 22:09:49 2015 UTC,"Well, somebody needs to put the work in to make a theme, and assuming it's a professional high quality job, why should they do it for free?    It's not like they charge very much - $2-$4 - the price of a coffee - seems pretty reasonable to me."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Dickwang,0,Wed Jul 8 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"Sony should add the functionality to add wallpapers, a it is a shame that they haven't after two years.   They also haven't improved the stability of PSN, so my assumption would be they haven't spent all of the monthly earnings from that source of income. I'm sure they could just release them without going out of business.   Paying for it really is ridiculous, especially when they don't give you the option to do it yourself."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,ps4hero,4,Wed Jul 8 17:44:00 2015 UTC,"Them providing free themes is advertising for the games themselves, which drive sales"
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Dickwang,2,Wed Jul 8 12:02:19 2015 UTC,"I think Sony saved a few dollars by not improving PSN over the years. They could pay someone to do it, easily, but stupid people buy them and ruin it for everyone else.   Now we can't even set a screenshot as a background for free because some people just love to pay for it."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,ps4hero,5,Wed Jul 8 13:21:35 2015 UTC,stay positive? we're at nearly 2 years into the life of the console. They're slow as fuck and are clearly counting on people like yourself not giving a shit
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,r2001uk,13,Wed Jul 8 12:15:52 2015 UTC,"I know there are a lot of things on the PS4 wish list (I'd take larger cloud save storage over this anyday), but on the subject of themes, I'd just like to be able to preview them before buying, without having to go on youtube to see if someone bought it.  This annoyed me with the Xbox 360 too."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Muino,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:17:51 2015 UTC,There's a video trailer for most of the dynamic ones.
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,r2001uk,3,Wed Jul 8 13:22:06 2015 UTC,Yeah but we shouldn't have to go hunting for videos when they could offer a preview on the console.  Although I suppose people wouldn't ever buy the shitty ones then.
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Muino,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:46:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean if you go to the Overview page of the theme, there's a little trailer that you can watch there. Just like how if you were to go look at Diablo 3: RoS on the PS Store, there would be a trailer for you to watch."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,r2001uk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:42:04 2015 UTC,Are you serious? How have I never noticed this?
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Muino,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:52:37 2015 UTC,"Not all of them do it lol, but most of the dynamic ones have previews I 've seen. I was bored one day and went through like every single one and watched them all. I'm not going to spend $5 on a background though"
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,CrustyJugglerUK,8,Wed Jul 8 13:56:55 2015 UTC,I'd love to be able to use the screenshots I take during playing as backgrounds
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,clamps12345,3,Wed Jul 8 14:02:35 2015 UTC,why not a highlight reel?
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,CrustyJugglerUK,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:06:21 2015 UTC,awesome idea!

PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,CrustyJugglerUK,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:10:50 2015 UTC,Yup :)
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Erroneus,5,Thu Jul 9 08:45:30 2015 UTC,"It would be nice, but honestly I would rather they spend resources on real issues, like the god damn limited 1GB of space for save games."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,alex_dlc,7,Fri Jul 10 00:08:06 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Yes  Long answer: I think it would make PS+ a lot better if you got something like themes and/or avatars for free. It would also be awesome if getting a platinum trophy on a game, would give you a free dynamic theme and avatars of that game."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,GospelX,13,Fri Jul 10 11:12:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think playing a game should give you free themes and avatars."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Muino,6,Wed Jul 8 15:58:32 2015 UTC,On the Xbox 360 you got avatars for completing achievements and stuff. My favorite avatar was getting the Trials HD achievement for completing all expert maps. That shit was great
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,willgeld,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:04:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, like some of the pictures used for trophies would be cool"
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,ptikku,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:37:09 2015 UTC,And they already do give out themes in Japanese PS+ so no reason they could not do it in other regions as well.
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,johnymyko,3,Wed Jul 8 13:41:39 2015 UTC,"I don't use themes, I think most of them look way to tacky and poorly executed, I'm completely fine with Playstation's defaults. But PS+ used to give access to some dynamic themes on PS3."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,CherryQuench,3,Wed Jul 8 18:49:32 2015 UTC,"I think they should just direct a bit more attention to the features of paid themes, while giving some more basic ones (and the occasional premiere one) free of charge to those who subscribe to their service.   However, I don't want to say that we shouldn't expect a wallpaper and a few icons to be absolutely free. Graphic designers did create them and I want to pay for what they earned beyond my 5 dollars a month in the subscription."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Suitecake,3,Wed Jul 8 23:37:23 2015 UTC,I really don't care about themes.
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,Fackincrazy,3,Wed Jul 8 13:05:46 2015 UTC,Sure but I'd personally rather if they gave you themes for platinuming games like hey you did everything in bloodborne here's a ellane the crow theme enjoy that way it would give us a reason to platnum more games
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,JT-Lionheart,2,Wed Jul 8 15:30:17 2015 UTC,"Depends, if it's a dynamic theme with a great moving background, custom XMB icons, and nice music to play along, then those we should pay for. But if it's like a static theme or just a wallpaper with nothing special to it, then they should be free. Dynamic themes actually has alot of effort put in it where a regular static theme is just a simple wallpaper which shouldn't be hard for them to make."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,willgeld,2,Wed Jul 8 15:55:55 2015 UTC,The idea of paying to have a game advertised to me sucks. They should be free and we should be allowed to design our own
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,frozengash,6,Wed Jul 8 16:44:49 2015 UTC,No.  They should supply a stable network.
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,aroomacanvas,2,Wed Jul 8 11:58:52 2015 UTC,Seriously. I would way rather get absolutely nothing free with ps+ if PSN just fucking worked. I don't care about wallpapers or another indie sidescroller I just want to be able to play online properly...

PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,junkit33,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:46:33 2015 UTC,"It's a very reasonable idea, I'm just not sure it's much of a compelling bullet point to help sell PS+ subscriptions."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,majindan007,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:05:57 2015 UTC,"Themes, backgrounds, etc, is all marketing if there is media involved. ALL of this should be free and promoted accordingly. Never understood why people think it's OK to pay for such things."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,mt007,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:24:50 2015 UTC,"no, but they should let us create or damn dynamic themes."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,letsgometros,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:36:43 2015 UTC,Eh I don't care for themes. Just randomize the color like on ps3

PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,shizknight,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:19:49 2015 UTC,Sony should be giving free themes in general.
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,CableStoned,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:54:21 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, they should. Seems like almost all themes are either made by small no-name studios or are tied to a franchise.  The only acceptable Dynamic Theme I've found is Transistor, and sorting through themes, like everything else on the PSN, is a huge pain in the ass."
PlayStationPlus,3cjbdt,OHeyB,0,Thu Jul 9 13:39:56 2015 UTC,"Should they? That's up to them.  Could they? Possibly.  I don't really see an incentive for them to do so however since most people if they weren't gonna pay for a theme anyway have already downloaded a theme that was ""good enough"" for them since they're only gonna see it between apps/games.  I personally use the free FFXIV theme from the JP/EU store, but most I know who have an alt theme use the 20th anniversary one."

PlayStationPlus,3cmsrf,Miobix,2,Thu Jul 9 05:40:44 2015 UTC,"Nah, I liked it, but I have a lot of patience. It's a little bit challenging in coordination, and should be played on an acid trip; was it memorable? Yes, regarding the very unique gamestyle."
PlayStationPlus,3cmsrf,wielku,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:46:04 2015 UTC,I agree. I felt Mousecraft should have been a Vita only game.

Played a little of it but i dunno hasn't sucked me in. so can't really comment  styx? its an average stealth game. Worst part is the loading times for a game where you die and retry alot, this had me almost rage quitting it was that annoying to reload.  mousecraft? a lame lemmings puzzle game its basically shovel indie crap most will bypass. It hasn;t exactly been a big seller hence why its being dumped on igc  rain? wasn't it offered on igc before its a fun puzzler if i recall haven't played it in awhile though  entwined? meh its playing off its indie look too much gameplay is pretty lackluster, bought it awhile back and can't recall touching it much  gw3? good twin stick shooter too bad its only the vita version   to be honest this months selection hasn't really impressed me and seems pretty bland"

PlayStationPlus,3cmsrf,kaztrator,-1,Thu Jul 9 05:40:02 2015 UTC,Well maybe Sony found an escape clause lately in the IGC contract or what not so they can get away with indies.

PlayStationPlus,3cmsrf,Shiro2809,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:56:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I've played quite a bit of Offline Rocket League but the funniest part would be online multiplayer and I don't do online games.

PlayStationPlus,3cmsrf,chorgox,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:00:41 2015 UTC,"Rocket League is a fun game if you practice and put some time into it. Also better with friends. Mousecraft are one of those brain hurting puzzles that get very difficult and makes you think alot. Entwined is a short but very beautiful game though it's challenge mode is hard. Styx is a decent little third person stealth game. Though the lore coming off from the Of Orcs and Men game seems interesting. But the concept of playing a little goblin basically assassin's creeding humans is interesting. Rain another beautiful artsy game that tells a silent story between characters and companionship. Geometry Wars 3 is a spaceship shooter (I forget what you call that genre) which have very bright colors and jammin techno music, very fun arcade type of game to pass the time which is good to have on Vita.  So this month was good, much better than recent months"

Noticed it wasn't (after i had checked out) and went to customer service to chat, but they wouldn't give me a refund because I guess they only give each account 1 refund in their lifetime. I used it when I bought a game for PS3 instead of PS4 about 6 months ago.   What makes it worse is that they know they were wrong because they have removed the game from the Free Games section. They have to know I am valuable customer because they must see I have all their systems and spend at least $50/month on games over the last year and am PS+.   Call me dumb or lazy for not checking, but it's nothing short of unacceptable that they can't just refund me since i've haven't downloaded the game yet.   TL;DR - Made this error, CS said once you get a refund, that's the last one, no exceptions. This game better be good."

PlayStationPlus,3cjqts,specterofthepast,8,Wed Jul 8 14:19:26 2015 UTC,You will never see a trade-in option for a digital product because there is no resell value there.  A discount or rewarding loyal customers through point is more likely.
PlayStationPlus,3cjqts,obi5683,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:50:11 2015 UTC,"I think this should definitely happen also refunds on games that are just complete rubbish.  But it seems unlikely that they would give the customers any rights back when they are holding all the cards.  I hate digital media.  You don't quite own the product you paid for, you can't take it to a friends house, sell it , or even use it for target practice when that boss in Demon's Souls kills you one too many times.  I know if I could get a refund on bad games and trade it in if I get tired of it... it would make me more willing to buy games new.  As it stands, I'm just glad I can buy used games."
PlayStationPlus,3cjqts,specterofthepast,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:09:05 2015 UTC,"You can ""take it to a friend's house"". Log in with your PSN account, download the game, and as long as you are logged in, they can play it. As soon as you log out, they lose access.  You own a license. Which isn't true for a physical copy. If your disc breaks, you need to buy another disc. No free replacements. You do have the option to sell those back, if the disc isn't too scratched.  I buy newly released games on disc. If the game has been out for a few years, I'll buy the version I can get cheaper. I bought Tomb Raider digitally on sale since it has been out for a while, which means it'll probably be free soon, but that game is worth the $12 that I'll never get back. I bought LEGO Batman 3 on disc because it was cheaper at Amazon."
PlayStationPlus,3cjqts,timborobot,3,Wed Jul 8 15:50:35 2015 UTC,"And, that right there is dumb ""if the disk breaks"" yeah ""if"" that's like saying well ""if your car breaks you can't get a replacement"".  It is a lot less likely for my disks to break than for some company to shut down their servers.  Owing a physical copy with no ridiculous drm is basically like owning it."
PlayStationPlus,3cjqts,obi5683,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:25:26 2015 UTC,"This is the real concern for most of us though. A digital copy has a life span determined by whether or not you keep it installed on your system and, if not, how long the servers holding the list of your purchases remains active. A physical copy has a life span determined by whether or not it is damaged and, if not, how long it takes for it to erode. But none of us really know how long PSN will be up or howlong older systems will remain supported. Currently our best example is the fact that PSP recently lost access to the PSN in a handful of regions around the world. So any game people had in their download history that was not saved on to a memory stick they lost access to. They purchased a license to use the game but years later the only means to access it was taken away. This will eventually happen to the PS3, VITA, and PS4."
PlayStationPlus,3cjqts,Fuegofucker,-1,Wed Jul 8 22:28:00 2015 UTC,"It happens. It's not dumb.  I can get a car fixed. I cannot fix a disc. If my car is totaled in am accident, my insurance company will give me a portion of the vehicle's value. What can I get for a broken disc? I have children. Other people have dogs. The likelihood of damages are higher. If you had read my comment completely, I even said that I purchase physical copies. I want to trade in games when I'm done. I'm just giving an advantage of digital over physical. Things are not perfect in either situation."
PlayStationPlus,3cjqts,obi5683,2,Wed Jul 8 19:42:07 2015 UTC,Dude I've gamed for 15 years. I haven't broken one disc yet. Besides pretty tough to bust up a blue ray.

Your suggesting that somehow a completely different service that your paying for makes these two things different.  If you have an egg, and the egg gets dropped... do you get it replaced?  Is that because you only had the license for the egg?  Did you own it any less?  Effectively having the physical format is superior to ""owning"" the game digitally."
PlayStationPlus,3cjqts,Excalibrrrrrr,0,Wed Jul 8 20:50:13 2015 UTC,Im not even sure what you are saying anymore. I'm not asking you to change your opinion. Keep buying discs. There are advantages and disadvantages of both physical and digital. I buy a mixture. It depends on the situation. I wouldn't say one is superior to the other. You did and that is your opinion.

While in the menus the fans do seem to be running a bit harder than usual but overheating implies damage is being done. Maybe don't tempt fate by leaving it sat at the menu screen for hours but there's no need not to download the game.

PlayStationPlus,3cl3cw,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:13:34 2015 UTC,"What a load of crap, if it is really worrying you just push up on the right stick while on the menu screen and you won't have a problem.  Game is great,  and it won't kill your PS4"
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,MightyGreenPanda,50,Tue Jul 7 08:13:08 2015 UTC,It emulates the cars engines for a more immersive touch.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,Issune91,13,Tue Jul 7 15:00:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's only in the main menu, it does quiet down when playing a game. Think it's to do with no frame cap in the menus."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,Ozmandiuss,7,Tue Jul 7 10:38:34 2015 UTC,"Also to me. Just like Ether One. In game it's a little less though. For what it's worth, I reach pretty much the same noise levels with other games, like Second Son and TLoU"
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,bringyoutomyhell,3,Tue Jul 7 11:46:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after I quit the game I played a bit of Batman Arkham Knight and it got pretty noisy too, although not as much as Rocket League. I started playing RL early in the morning though, so maybe it felt a bit louder than it actually was."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,Gustavo13,3,Tue Jul 7 12:17:51 2015 UTC,Rocket League can't melt PS4 fans.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,DagSonikku,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:14:38 2015 UTC,If I had gold I would give it all to you sir
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,Courier_7,4,Wed Jul 8 21:41:15 2015 UTC,This didnt happen to me during the beta. I dont have it yet because I'm in North America but it could do this to me for all I know.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,gta-man,5,Tue Jul 7 08:42:02 2015 UTC,I had this problem but only in the menu
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,wasabipeaz,3,Tue Jul 7 09:45:34 2015 UTC,"Is yours a launch PS4? Mine was giving me the same trouble with Bloodborne, and being a PC guy with an out of warranty launch model, replaced the terrible thermal paste Sony put on.   Mine isn't a jet engine anymore, but the fans will still turn up after quite a few hours of gaming."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,NightmareP69,2,Tue Jul 7 12:07:47 2015 UTC,"My PS4 is about to lose its warranty too but i'm way too afraid to take it apart, sure i have experience with building PCs in nice big comfy tower cases, but working with such a small tight design such as the PS4's case where everything is crammed in together just makes me nervous. I watched some vids of people taking it apart but it looks nerve wrecking to me, really wish PS4's case was somewhat bigger and had more and bigger airflow holes on the intake sides so more air could get in better."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,Soul_Doubt,2,Tue Jul 7 15:05:25 2015 UTC,I sent mine back to Sony.  If it is under warranty they will fix this noisy fan issue for you.  In the EU you get 2 years warranty - the 2nd year is with the retailer you bought it from though.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,bringyoutomyhell,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:12:53 2015 UTC,Was the new one quiet? I heard of many who exchanged 3 or 4 of them and found all basically the same..
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,Soul_Doubt,2,Wed Jul 8 10:08:08 2015 UTC,Don't have it yet it was only posted today! fingers crossed I get one back that is not noisy but we shall see.  If not I'll just go with the thermal paste option I just don't see why I should have to do that with something I spent so much money on.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,bringyoutomyhell,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:17:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know either man. My second one was quieter, but under load still blows hard. I'm just thinking that PS4 are noisy, period, but there are many that say theirs are quiet... don't know if to believe them.."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,NightmareP69,2,Wed Jul 8 10:24:34 2015 UTC,"It's possible then what we consider to be noisy, is for them quiet."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,wasabipeaz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:38:04 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain, it's different when you don't have that space to work with!   I followed a step by step video and the whole thing took about an hour since I have meaty hands. You definitely want to take your time, but it's a relatively painless process."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,wasabipeaz,2,Tue Jul 7 15:38:29 2015 UTC,"It is a launch PS4. I'm afraid of replacing the thermal paste though, as I've read cases of bricking."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,Infectedbumhole,3,Tue Jul 7 12:16:11 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard about bricking much, but not everyone is comfortable taking apart their stuff either.   The noise is the only issue really, I would play Bloodborne for hours with that fan at max speed with no gameplay issues, so I'm betting it's just the same thing happening here. :)"
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,iaoth,3,Tue Jul 7 12:56:55 2015 UTC,"I guess that's the case. I've never noticed a drop in performance when the PS4 gets loud, so I guess it's just the fan going crazy."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,NMRtyn,8,Tue Jul 7 13:09:10 2015 UTC,"I heard a lot of people complain about this issue with Rocket league most likely due to an issue with the game not being ideally optimized at the moment. I haven't personally downloaded the game yet (slow internet, please I live in aus) but I likely won't play it too much (although it will be a pain to resist) until they release a patch to fix this issue which I'm sure they will in due time considering how many people are complaining."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,gagsy92,3,Tue Jul 7 08:23:02 2015 UTC,"Don't. You know you won't be able to resist the temptation.  But seriously, I've been playing for like an hour. It bothered me a lot with Ether One, but this game is so fun that you forget about that problem. I'll just try not to play too much just in case."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,NightmareP69,7,Tue Jul 7 09:44:39 2015 UTC,Because it's trying to take off and kick a ball.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,cpnHindsight,4,Tue Jul 7 09:33:28 2015 UTC,My PS4 is too excited about this fucking game.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,petrov32,2,Tue Jul 7 09:43:10 2015 UTC,"I had the same thing during the beta, hopefully they'll be able to find a solution, not that it's going to stop me playing."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,Mutilated_Pencil,2,Tue Jul 7 08:27:59 2015 UTC,The same thing happened when I played Assassin's Creed: Unity not long ago. I'm convinced my PS4 is going to take off one of these days.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,LukeNeverShaves,2,Tue Jul 7 13:43:58 2015 UTC,"Didn't play the full version but when i played the beta of Rocket League my PS4 also sounded like a jet engine too.  It seems to be normal for the PS4, on some games the fan hardly kicks in or is at a moderate speed while in games like Killzone: Shadow Fall, Rocket League and Infamous : Second Son ; It sounds like a jet engine. Thankfully i wear headphone so it's not a big deal for me, i even have a fairly loud GPU in my PC which i purposely run at a more aggresive fan speed curve to make sure my GPU is running cooler, so i don't mind the noise as long as it keeps my hardware cool enough.  Only thing i'm worried is if one day my PS4's fan might give up the ghost. Also, it doesn't help i live on an island where humidity levels can get rather high and temperatures can in some rare days hit 38-40c (about 100-104f) during late spring,summer and early autumn."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,titanhermant,2,Tue Jul 7 14:58:46 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are blaming Rocket League for not being well optimized  but in my opinion, a living room device should never achieve this noise level even at the highest load. Some have measured 51 DB which is close to drowning out a normal conversation."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,UltravioIence,3,Tue Jul 7 20:28:02 2015 UTC,"It's because of the ""Blast processing""."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,titanhermant,2,Tue Jul 7 16:34:03 2015 UTC,"oh boy another one of those games? reminds me of assassins creed menus, they would almost make my appartment shake out of the ground"
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,UltravioIence,2,Tue Jul 7 11:52:43 2015 UTC,The developers said its a problem with the main menu screen and their not sure exactly why but theyre working to fix it. Something to do with the rendering of the menu.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,titanhermant,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:59:45 2015 UTC,Tried taking a can of air to the ps4 to blow dust out? Could just be dust accumulating inside so the fans are working harder
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,OffTerror,2,Tue Jul 7 18:20:25 2015 UTC,"I heard blowing air into it is bad and to use a vacuum.   *I dont know what im talking about, ignore what i say."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,MyNameIsRobPaulson,2,Tue Jul 7 23:28:13 2015 UTC,"That's the opposite of what you should do. A vacuum creates static which can fry electronics, air is already being circulated through the console so shooting air into it won't hurt it. Just make sure you use canned air in short bursts otherwise it can get too cold and spray some moisture, and there are static free vacuums for electronics but they're pretty spendy"
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,almightyNTER,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:35:20 2015 UTC,I stand corrected.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,Devocalypse,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:37:44 2015 UTC,"No worries, just don't want someone to fry their stuff haha"
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,majindan007,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:41:53 2015 UTC,mine is a week old out of the box and it does the same thing with this game I don't think it's dust.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,FrankPapageorgio,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:44:10 2015 UTC,"Proper ventilation, everyone. My ps4 used to do the same until I cut a big hole in my entertainment center to fit the rear profile of my ps4 and it's whisper quiet now."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,majindan007,-3,Thu Jul 9 00:57:15 2015 UTC,I think the grass and the 60fps cause this.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,Latinola1,-9,Tue Jul 7 09:02:33 2015 UTC,"Both Rocket league and Ether one use Unreal Engine 4. My ps4 is ""doing the jet"" with both games too which leads me to the conclusion that the PS4 simply cannot handle that engine properly, at least for now.  Rant: Look on the bright side, both games are mediocre at best so do your PS4 a favor and don't torture it over them."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,majindan007,3,Tue Jul 7 10:25:20 2015 UTC,"PS4 simply cannot handle that engine properly   If the game is running properly, then the PS4 is just being pushed, it can handle them just fine. I picked up a USB fan and put it behind my PS4 to help pull the hot air out of the cabinet, it helps."
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,Northern_Chiliad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:48:04 2015 UTC,"I picked up a USB fan and put it behind my PS4 to help pull the hot air out of the cabinet, it helps.   Any recommendations?"
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,almightyNTER,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:29:09 2015 UTC,Thermaltake makes a few with stands and speed controls.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,Mutilated_Pencil,-1,Tue Jul 7 20:41:57 2015 UTC,How well will this work though since I heard usb fans will be just pulling more energy causing it to heat up more and faster.
PlayStationPlus,3cejuh,pr0adam,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:42:05 2015 UTC,"USB ports don't really generate much heat at all, esp in comparison to the heat dissipated by the mobo components. The thought process is that the fan is pulling more heat than generates, which I believe to be true. (I also did a before and after with my thermo laser pointed at the back of the PS4 under load)"
PlayStationPlus,3ci37r,abyssea,4,Wed Jul 8 02:06:56 2015 UTC,They usually don't show the cross buys on the PS4 store page. Search for the title names
PlayStationPlus,3ci37r,ThcLoserGuy,2,Wed Jul 8 02:23:19 2015 UTC,seems fine to me: https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/free-games/cid=STORE-MSF77008-PSPLUSFREEGAMES
PlayStationPlus,3ci37r,sony4life,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:10:48 2015 UTC,Showing fine to me as well.  Are you looking at it with PS4 games selected?
PlayStationPlus,3ci37r,Romiress,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:13:18 2015 UTC,"The roll out is not instantaneous for everyone. The network doesn't usually go down for maintenance on release day either, so this one is weird.  Searching for a game might help, or just check back every once in awhile. I've never seen an issue go on for more than a couple hours, usually not even that. My rule of thumb is, wait 24 hours after the roll out before getting upset about a missing game."
PlayStationPlus,3ci37r,TheGallifreyan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:14:40 2015 UTC,The PS4 Plus layout tab isn't that great listing the free games. Every week they only show the top 2 free Plus game in the tab. Just search for the other free games and you'll find them free. I hate that they still haven't put in a directory to a page with all the free games this month like the PS3 does.
PlayStationPlus,3ci37r,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:02:17 2015 UTC,So that's what I was wondering because I'm used to how it was on PS3.
PlayStationPlus,3cf0hu,redisforever,13,Tue Jul 7 12:01:43 2015 UTC,"Not that it helps you now, but you could have claimed all of the PS4 games on PS+ even though you didn't have a PS4.  Just use the web store.  I did this with Vita and PS4 until I bought each system."
PlayStationPlus,3cf0hu,merph_,5,Tue Jul 7 14:38:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I should have done that. The thing is I didn't think I'd be getting a PS4 until just very recently. I know that's kinda dumb, but hey."
PlayStationPlus,3cf0hu,merph_,5,Tue Jul 7 14:41:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear you.  Honestly, my comment was more for others who may happen upon this post who are thinking of purchasing a PS4 than you.  Here's hoping you can scrape up a few of the x-buy games though."
PlayStationPlus,3cf0hu,OriginalUneeK,3,Tue Jul 7 15:00:49 2015 UTC,"Hope so. I currently have The Unfinished Swan, Race the Sun, Fez, Sportsfriends, and CounterSpy (which I'm really excited to replay in 1080p this time around).

PlayStationPlus,3cf0hu,OriginalUneeK,3,Tue Jul 7 15:06:37 2015 UTC,"You can grab metal gear, drive club, there should be a few more free games to grab before they update the store, than you'll have six more games including rocket league and Styx!"

PlayStationPlus,3cf0hu,MFTWrecks,7,Tue Jul 7 21:29:38 2015 UTC,I believe Cross Buy titles will be available for you.  The best way to check would be to go into your download list on the online store and see if you can see the ps4 copy.
PlayStationPlus,3cf0hu,toomanylizards,8,Tue Jul 7 12:04:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks, checked the download list, looks like I do have some PS4 games already!"

PlayStationPlus,3cf0hu,pappapidanha,3,Tue Jul 7 13:25:05 2015 UTC,That may be the option to download the Vita game to the PS3 for transfer. That happens some times. It may not be the actual PS3 version.
PlayStationPlus,3cf0hu,tnecniVVincent,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:12:16 2015 UTC,"I thought that, but it actually says it's the PS3 version. I guess I got the Vita version and when they released the PS3 version, I got it retroactively through cross buy"

Keep trying and you would have about 20 seconds to roam the store before it gives you the notice again. I was able to get the games and now I'm enjoying Rocket League.
PlayStationPlus,3ccssf,ShadowVexx,5,Mon Jul 6 22:22:42 2015 UTC,This month's PS+ update is a lot earlier than usual. I was expecting to see the update in about 15 hours from now.
PlayStationPlus,3ccssf,PUSClFER,2,Mon Jul 6 23:23:37 2015 UTC,There was an announcement which said PS+ games will be released at the same time and we don't need to wait a lot. The games released earlier in USA so far.

It's going to slowly disappear and fade out of the PS+ lineup over the next year, just like PSP did, guaranteed.   I loved my PS3, but it's time. It's almost 10 years old. Console systems are not really meant to last that long. Think about the PS2, it was only on the market for 6 years before they replaced it. Same with the PS1, I believe that one was only around for 5 years as well."

So you can play your EU PSN games on your JP account or viceversa as long the account that purchased the game have your PS4 set as Primary System.  To buy Japanese PSN Cards go to play-asia.com.

PlayStationPlus,3ca107,Kranke,2,Mon Jul 6 08:19:14 2015 UTC,"Skullgirls is an awesome game, and it's also got the best fighting game tutorial of all time."
PlayStationPlus,3ca107,Human_Sack,-4,Mon Jul 6 23:48:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i've played it, it's not very good tbh, there are like 2 or 3 top tier characters so everyone plays them. There is no trial mode (unless they add it in the ps4 version) so learning how to do combos if you aren't really good at fighting games is borderline impossible to learn. The game is also not very controller friendly so you will probably want to play on a fight stick."
PlayStationPlus,3ca107,GarethMagis,0,Mon Jul 6 12:44:14 2015 UTC,All other versions of skullgirls have the best trial mode I've seen. They teach you fighting game fundamentals and some basic combos for all characters. Training room even has a hitstun bar and slow down so you can see what combos into what and with the game playing how it does you can combo pretty much whatever you want.
PlayStationPlus,3ca107,Benwacki,-3,Mon Jul 6 15:02:43 2015 UTC,"Nah, you're wrong. Skullgirls is fuckin' sick."
PlayStationPlus,3ca107,CallMeMoo,4,Mon Jul 6 17:40:41 2015 UTC,I'm excited for el toro. I want to try it out. Not doubt rocket league. Great line up for ps4.

PlayStationPlus,3ca107,nb00288,9,Mon Jul 6 10:12:30 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the hate for it. We have games mimicking war, games involving crime and killing innocent people, animals and gladiator games, COD had the ""No Russian"" mission but bullfighting is where people are drawing the line?"
PlayStationPlus,3ca107,Comaburr,2,Mon Jul 6 12:53:04 2015 UTC,"War, crime, killing innocent people in games have one big difference to bullfighting in games.  In real life, war, crime, and killing innocent people isn't glorified and celebrated."

PlayStationPlus,3ca107,7121958041201,0,Mon Jul 6 18:26:48 2015 UTC,"Well... bullfighting is a little more ""torture-y"" than those. To make a comparable gladiator game, one of the contestants would have to be stabbed a bunch of times just for fun/amusement before he is executed, with no real chance to escape or fight back."

PlayStationPlus,3c90f7,redninja115,11,Mon Jul 6 00:52:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't know a method of doing so, but once you do, you know that you can turn off automatic upload for games on a per game basis? If you don't the save will get reuploaded every time you play that game. (I'm looking at you Little Big Planet 3!)  Sony's user guids are as clear as mud so here's what you do:  Go to Settings>Application Saved Data Management>Saved Data in System Storage>Upload to Online Storage  You will get a list of all games saved on the PS4. Highlight the game you want to ban from online storage and hit the options button on the controller. There will be one option: ""Auto-Upload"" just hit X enable/disable uploading. Games the have auto-upload off will say so next to the game."
PlayStationPlus,3c90f7,pantherjd42,3,Mon Jul 6 02:48:48 2015 UTC,"You're my hero. The N++ Beta has a save file that's just crushing my storage (~250 MB), so this is a lifesaver.  As an aside, we should have enough storage to support the games we purchase. 1 GB is not enough and managing your own online storage is not a problem users should be faced with. This is one of the few areas where Microsoft is really kicking Sony's butt."
PlayStationPlus,3c90f7,StarfighterProx,4,Mon Jul 6 17:53:20 2015 UTC,I don't even know how to delete them individually.
PlayStationPlus,3c90f7,spacemonk42,4,Mon Jul 6 09:07:53 2015 UTC,"SONY's allocation for save games is ridiculous considering that saved game files are getting so much bigger with newer games. You should really get additional space PER GAME. Steam does this and although the amount changes per game it can be anywhere from 100MB to 1 Gig per game. Instead SONY gives you a paltry 3 Gigs for everything... PS4, PS3, Vita all share the same space.  What this does is penalize people who play, or even try, a lot of games. I had to recently flush all of my game saves because I upgraded my PS4 hard drive and thought it would be easy, but it was a purposefully frustrating experience. There is no clear way to tell how much space you have, what is being used up by what. Each game needed to be backed up individually?! In the end I just used a USB stick, because my online storage was so funky. To top it all off, you can't copy saved games back to your PS4 if the game is no longer installed. So my save file from Wolfenstein is still on my USB stick because I rented that game and no longer have it installed, but may eventually play the  other story line.  Seriously screwed up system on SONY's part. For a great system, how it manages users information and storage is worse than it was on the PS3... 5 years ago. ಠ_ಠ"
PlayStationPlus,3c90f7,FuntimeBen,3,Mon Jul 6 15:23:40 2015 UTC,"Actually The 3GB space are NOT shared between Vita, PS3, PS4. Each system get's it's own 1GB. While that does add up to 3 GB you can't use extra space from one system for you PS4 saves.   And yes, 1 GB is not enough space for PS4, While my Vita and PS3 both still have room I can't fit all my PS4 saves in the 1 GB I got online for them."
PlayStationPlus,3c90f7,pantherjd42,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:45:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, well that is news to me, but makes sense. I continue to run out of space. The PS4 also does a fairly bad job at letting you know you have run out of space.  Also I would love an option just to upload my latest game saves and not all of them. Like the Witcher 3 I have 8 game saves at different points because I am a scaredy cat. It would be great to just upload the most recent and not all saves."
PlayStationPlus,3c90f7,FuntimeBen,3,Tue Jul 7 18:52:01 2015 UTC,So if I were to backup the saves to a thumb drive and switch out the hdd for example and then put the saves back would they stick work for my account and earn trophies and such. I remember on ps3 having an issue where I backed up a save and went to copy it back to ps3 it said something like this save won't work for this account because its not the original owner
PlayStationPlus,3c90f7,FuntimeBen,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. I switched out my drive and reloaded my saves for the witcher 3 and am still unlocking trophies. Not sure if you are trying to add a game save from another PS4, but when upgrading your hard drive it appears your saves are treated like a normal save file."
PlayStationPlus,3c90f7,t33zt33z,3,Tue Jul 7 18:46:31 2015 UTC,"sorry for the noobness, but isn't it necessary to upload all? what will happen if I choose none to be uploaded to cloud?"
PlayStationPlus,3cabhk,fakeplasticmax,5,Mon Jul 6 09:54:21 2015 UTC,I think they are two steps of the same ladder. A game goes on sale in order to reach customers that are less willing to pay for it and games are included in the IGC when very few potential buyers are left. I think of that like: full price -> sales -> IGC
PlayStationPlus,3cabhk,01luca01,2,Mon Jul 6 10:03:10 2015 UTC,so do you think i should wait for child of light to be in IGC ?
PlayStationPlus,3cabhk,joaonobre,3,Mon Jul 6 14:01:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was included with games with gold so it will probably be included soon."
PlayStationPlus,3cabhk,StaticzAvenger,2,Mon Jul 6 14:06:25 2015 UTC,also was given with xbl which can sometimes also help as indicator of that
PlayStationPlus,3cabhk,peterkozmd,2,Mon Jul 6 14:15:45 2015 UTC,"aww man, should i really wait ? what if it doens't become a part of IGC ? haha"

PlayStationPlus,3cabhk,joaonobre,2,Tue Jul 7 13:34:31 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it will be part of igc sooner or later, it's the kind of game that could perfectly be included in it. But this is only my opinion ;)"
PlayStationPlus,3cabhk,01luca01,2,Mon Jul 6 17:38:37 2015 UTC,"that's what i think too, and that's why i didn't buy it yet, hope we're not wrong"
PlayStationPlus,3cabhk,joaonobre,2,Mon Jul 6 18:02:23 2015 UTC,this. its actually the reverse  first on sale as last ditch effort to get some cash THEN igc  if a game goes on sale cheap especially suspiciously cheap suspect igc shortly
PlayStationPlus,3cabhk,peterkozmd,2,Mon Jul 6 14:06:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe i've not been so clear, but i meant exactly what you're saying. Does it sound different?"
PlayStationPlus,3cabhk,01luca01,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:35:32 2015 UTC,"I've always assumed there is a link between IGC and sales. I think there is no big pattern, but it is more on a game-to-game basis. Many games are on sale before they become IGC and some games are not. There is a trend for sure and I think it is just good business sense to do so."
PlayStationPlus,3c8c7s,kripplecorn,10,Sun Jul 5 21:14:03 2015 UTC,Tons of cars unlock with the full game but there is still plenty behind the dlc paywall still that you have to buy separately.

It's all cleary extra stuff and there's plently to the base game.  Furthermore, theres a decent amount of free DLC cars and one or two free add-on events pack DLC. So make sure to snatch those free items up"
PlayStationPlus,3c8c7s,bino420,6,Sun Jul 5 22:42:22 2015 UTC,Some of it was offered to compensate for the bad launch. The 1st and 2nd packs I believe.
PlayStationPlus,3c8c7s,f0rsale,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:34:45 2015 UTC,"That's correct, and they aren't miniscule either. They are basically like the content inside each one of the main game racing levels (amature, pro etc.)."

PlayStationPlus,3c8c7s,ShadowStrikerPL,2,Sun Jul 5 22:49:15 2015 UTC,"Nope. I got tired of waiting for the PS+ version and bought the game. Great game, but so much stuff was released after the launch - it's a bit ridiculous. If you really want everything - season pass is the way to go.  To the games credit: there's plenty of stuff to do even without DLC. Tens of hours of quality arcade racing guaranteed."
PlayStationPlus,3c8c7s,Thnito_Kyrios,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:43:43 2015 UTC,"I think they should release the REAL retail version with the fixed game and add some DLC. Buying this game physical is ""useless"", since you have to download the whole game to have it working. I've downloaded the Plus version yesterday (almost 20gig) and today will try it. If I like that game don't know if I'm gonna buy the disc version, because if I want to play after the game is deleted, I have to wait to download many gigs :("

PlayStationPlus,3c7pgq,Gigglemoo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:30:14 2015 UTC,"I bought it, honestly played it a handful of times.  It's a good game that's sorely missing something.  Gameplay is great, I think the UI needs some work to truly feel connected."
PlayStationPlus,3c7pgq,CA719,4,Sun Jul 5 18:34:30 2015 UTC,Several of the alternate region PS+ pages have Driveclub listed as a timed offer. End dates of around 2015/10/06.  I don't think they've announced it's actually a time limited trial or anything though.
PlayStationPlus,3c7pgq,emjhayeii,-2,Sun Jul 5 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"Nah, they've always called it a free version of the game - they never once said it would be time-limited. I've even looked up all the interviews and information and not found a single article or anything saying it's timed. Very bizarre. Will see what happens in 70 days!  Interesting about the alternate region pages though, I hadn't seen that at all!"

PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,Soggy_Pronoun,7,Sat Jul 4 02:51:27 2015 UTC,"On one hand I totally understand people only wanting the online access side and not the games included, on the other side, the larger full service subscriptions allow Sony more options in providing games to PS+, as well as provide an additional revenue stream.  From an article several months ago, around 50-60% of PS4 owners are connected via PS+; so let's say 12 million @ an average of $50 per year = 600 million. (Naturally prices vary depending upon region and full year verses part year subscriptions).  Do you think Sony is prepared to change their PS+ options and for discussion purposes have 10M@$50 ($500M) and 6M@$10 ($60M)? Or even drop that 10M down to 7-8M and raise the online only numbers up by the corresponding change.  They can never reach 100% uptake on any form of PS+, as there are often multiple accounts running on single machines (families/ house mates), or even a single account on multiple systems PS3 (not a requirement, but many did), Vita and PS4.  If they offered an online only version for $25 a year, then it might be worth their while in terms of not losing money from existing higher subscribers, but certainly not at $10.  Would you throw away tens of millions of dollars in income to try and bring a few extra people into a lower paid version of PS+ if you were the CEO?"
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,Leather_Boots,24,Sat Jul 4 01:41:15 2015 UTC,"It's five dollars a month, just skip a cheeseburger, damn."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,uberwaffle,3,Fri Jul 3 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, in England it's £3.33 a month, you can find that on the floor"
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,willgeld,7,Mon Jul 6 05:07:04 2015 UTC,"Except, it's not. It's $10 a month, or an up front fee of $18 or $50. I get your point here, but it's only under $5 a month if you buy the most expensive up front cost.   I personally don't mind the cost, and there hasn't been many games I've been interested offered for free lately, so I'm basically paying the full amount just for online access. If they offered a cheaper, online play only option for PS+, I might consider it."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,The-Dragonborn,5,Sat Jul 4 00:59:54 2015 UTC,"I normally wait for the rare deals that pop up for 40 or less. I'm good until the end of 2017 right now.  Got one for 35, then a couple of weeks later ended up getting one for 25, couldn't pass it up."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,Soggy_Pronoun,2,Sat Jul 4 02:54:07 2015 UTC,"The only deal I ever really got to see was the $30 from before PS4 came out. I only bought 2 then, and the only deals I've seen more lately were $40. $25 sounds amazing."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,The-Dragonborn,7,Sat Jul 4 14:00:51 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, but since Sony knows that people are willing to pay $50-60 only for MP access, you can consider that what you are paying is this MP access with the added extras like cloud saving and free games, I know most games for PS4 are bad, but FREE is never bad.  The most I can recommend is purchasing your subscription during sales, it can go as low as $40 for 1-year, thats $20 less than the alternative (Xbox)"
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,grbolivar,9,Fri Jul 3 18:09:09 2015 UTC,"Ha, you mean like the majority of PS+ users?  Sony knows people that want to play online will pay the $60/year and that isn't going to change.  $10/year would be ludicrous."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,thongerrr,6,Fri Jul 3 17:19:49 2015 UTC,I pay the $60 for the games.  I only have a vita and ps3 but feel I more than get my money's worth out of it
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,hatmantc,2,Fri Jul 3 18:22:16 2015 UTC,"My ps+ ran out a few days ago and i have 0 interest in renewing seeing how the quality of games is getting absurd.   but multiplayer is really important to me, i just wish there was a cheaper alternative that caters to my wants and trims out the shit that i dont need (the games), which takes a huge portion of the cost of the subscription."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,thongerrr,5,Fri Jul 3 17:27:42 2015 UTC,Also XBOX live was the same price as that last gen and it was more or less just for multiplayer.
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,AppleChiaki,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:31:16 2015 UTC,"XBOX Live did and does have a better run service though. PSN on PS3 was really bare bones, and some aspects of it on PS4 haven't hugely improved with more subs."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,thongerrr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:01:24 2015 UTC,It doesn't change the fact that people have been paying $70/year for multiplayer for years.
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,hatmantc,9,Sun Jul 5 14:01:01 2015 UTC,"You don't care for you're discounts either?   Like others have said XBL is the same price and has been for years prior to them give away games. So it's highly doubt full they'd offer a cheaper slimmed down version for the minority that didn't appreciate their monthly ""free"" game selection. Especially at a ridiculously low price point of $10 a year. If anything maybe $25 a would be fair"
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,Duckstiff,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:20:09 2015 UTC,You don't care for you're discounts either?   To be fair most 'discounts' don't even come close to the price of a physical disc from the high street shops.  The playstation store is one of the most expensive retailers to begin with and the PS+ discounts just bring it down to a slightly less than absurd level for most the time.
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,donnowheretogo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:17:59 2015 UTC,the quality of games is getting absurd   Really?  I've been really enjoying the free stuff.  Guacamelee was pretty good and MGS: GZ is really fun to play.  Super stoked for Rocket League & Styx this month as well.  Those are two games that would probably run you ~$60 alotgether
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,evengraves,6,Mon Jul 6 13:48:49 2015 UTC,It should be free like it was on the ps3.
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,hatmantc,7,Sat Jul 4 01:08:27 2015 UTC,What about all the extra features that the ps3 doesn't have
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,bringyoutomyhell,5,Sat Jul 4 01:27:33 2015 UTC,"I think that 90% of players rarely goes beyond online multiplayer. I get your point.. but it's not because of that that we are paying plus, Sony just realized it needed money, and Plus is a good justification, with the free games and everything. But the chain of thought wasn't 1. We give them more features so we need more money, but 2. We need more money let's add some features"
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,evengraves,2,Sat Jul 4 11:43:04 2015 UTC,"I don't really care, they can take them away if that's what it takes to be feasible. All I need is online multiplayer to not be stuck behind a paywall. Paying for internet that I already pay comcast for is a scummy move."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,hatmantc,2,Sat Jul 4 01:31:39 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from.made some of those same arguments..but they've made things better over what the offer on the ps3, so it makes sense for them to make it part of the ps+ offerings"
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,JT-Lionheart,3,Sat Jul 4 02:00:55 2015 UTC,"I feel it should be separate because most people I know and I'm sure there a bunches of people like this, never are updated with the free games or never know there are free games every month. My friends are those sports/COD type of players so they just get on the PS4, play online, and that's it. They never go into looking around in the store or buying into some interesting games. But at the same time, it's a good deal. Multiplayer access with free games is a deal, I just feel bad that those who don't really care about indie games or whatever and only play COD online because it didn't use to be like that with PS3. I just pay like I did from the PS3 getting free games, people who only care for online play are paying extra now."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,CurbedEnthusiasm,4,Fri Jul 3 22:36:06 2015 UTC,Yes. Absolutely. I have no interest in the games that have been on Plus for some time now. I'd switch to the online-only sub immediately if I could.
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,Leaningthemoon,2,Sat Jul 4 02:10:01 2015 UTC,The free games are a bonus. The fee IS for the multiplayer access. (They can't just build and maintain the servers and network for free...well not a good one)  Microsoft did it that way for many years and only added free games to compete with sony (whose free online was pretty terrible for PS3)  Don't forget the unsung heroes of ps+ Share play (awesomeness) Auto updates (saves you soooo much time) Cloud back-up (saves the time you already spent)
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,AppleChiaki,2,Fri Jul 3 22:09:12 2015 UTC,"It's not a bonus at all, it's part of the package. They sell PS+ on the back of the games, as well as the online multiplayer and discounts. The term ""free"" muddies the waters, and it's always been odd to me. They are not free, and they are not a bonus, they are as much a part of the package as the online multiplayer access.   Money from the subs will be been used by Sony to pay the Devs of the games that are put up each month, as well as costs to run and maintain their servers."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,Leaningthemoon,4,Sat Jul 4 04:11:15 2015 UTC,"You're right. It's part of the package. It's a package that was made to make you go, wow, thanks for all the extra stuff that Microsoft doesn't do, and thanks for being less too!  It's kind of unique in that it didn't include multiplayer before, (was free and bad) but now they said, okay, we will include the online with ps+ so you are still paying less than Xbox and getting more services too.   I guess my response to the whole thing is, if you don't want the games, don't download them?  You're still paying less for the online than the competitor and you're still getting other features that weren't a part of their service either.  It's the best subscription service for console games (in my opinion) and paying less seems strange because I get more than my money's worth by having it."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,okaythiswillbemymain,2,Sat Jul 4 05:55:53 2015 UTC,"I think too many tiers of subscription would be detrimental to everyone..  Having said that, I pay £35 a year for PSPlus (although if you bought it at full price it would be £60  aids0109 points out its normally £40). I pay about twice as much for Netflix.  I think I get a lot more from Netflix than I do from PS Plus, and the games are definitely part of what makes PS Plus worth it. They'd definitely have to make it cheaper without them.   I think I'd like a bit more from PSPlus. But I don't want them to make a separate tier."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,aids0109,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:56:24 2015 UTC,"A few points here:  1) PS+ RRP in the UK is £40, not £60. If you paid £60, unlucky you, you got ripped off majorly.  2) You compare the service to Netflix which offers different content. Netflix is a movie streaming service, PS+ gives you access to 6 games every month, online multiplayer, cloud saving and  much more. Two totally different services.  3) The games on PS+ are what made Sony's online cheaper than Microsoft's where it used to be £40 RRP just for online multiplayer. MS only did the free games in the last couple of years and they still don't amount to the PS+ worth.  I don't think multiple subscription types would be detrimental but worth less to those who want both online multiplayer and games every month, if they did do this approach then I would reckon at around £15/£20 per year for online only.  The only thing that may be detrimental is the servers, the lower cost subscription means they have to lower the cost and spending on their servers."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,okaythiswillbemymain,2,Sat Jul 4 07:46:52 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, £40. Not sure why I wrote £60  Of course Netflix is completely different to PS Plus, but they are both entertainment services so I am comparing them. Neither of them gives you anything permanently.   The only thing that may be detrimental is the servers, the lower cost subscription means they have to lower the cost and spending on their servers.   So it would be detrimental to everyone?"
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,aids0109,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:08:43 2015 UTC,"It probably would as they may be like the PS3 servers before PS+ with a constant stream of hacks and exploits. Spending this money on their services allows them to hire more people to prevent problems in the future.  Also with the comparison, Spotify and Netflix are both entertainment services but are of different natures, when comparing it'd be best to compare on a shorter scale i.e. PS+ with XBL Gold and the old Onlive Pass. Netflix may give you more content but that is because they only do that content. PS+ gives you access to more like I stated earlier."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,AppleChiaki,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:40:24 2015 UTC,"Why would it be detrimental, I don't get it? If Sony uses some of the money to improve the service (we can hope), and more people are subbing because there's options that are better suited to what they want, how does it affect some players if others are buying into a no ""free"" games tier?   Unless you mean that maybe more people will buy the no games option, giving Sony less money to negotiate new games each month?"
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,squat251,2,Sat Jul 4 04:04:20 2015 UTC,"No, then we'd just have even more of a reason to be upset when it goes down. They need to sort out the whole DDOS situation first, and have 100% bulletproof servers."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,AppleChiaki,2,Fri Jul 3 22:35:41 2015 UTC,"Not currently possible.   They have so much they can do to improve things, but a 100% is not a target anyone can reach. Microsoft does a better job with their service, and was displayed with the recovery speed when they were DDosed too, but they were still hit as hard."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,rockynante,2,Sat Jul 4 04:13:55 2015 UTC,Yes I find that the free games are usually quite terrible. If anything I would rather have one good game as opposed to 3 shitty ones.
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,Imhullu,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:32:20 2015 UTC,"Wait for a year to be on sale for 30$ that's plenty cheap.  Honestly it's a steal at the current price, but I stocked up last time there was a deal."
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,Duckstiff,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:32:19 2015 UTC,I'm happy to pay the money if they actually have a network that isn't slow and inconsistent.   It feels like PS network is something run out of someones garage some times.

PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,xtremeradness,-1,Sat Jul 4 12:06:31 2015 UTC,Because the developer of the game does all the networking on their end and you connect directly to them. With consoles there has to be an integration between both PSN and the developer to communicate between your system and the developer's server. Also to make sure people arent hacking and lagging players like there are in PC games.
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,LukeNeverShaves,2,Sat Jul 4 01:40:23 2015 UTC,People hack on ps3 and 4 all the time. See all old Call of Duties.
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,xtremeradness,2,Sat Jul 4 02:54:39 2015 UTC,That's because those games are a peer to peer connection meaning you connect directly to a player hosting the game.
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,LukeNeverShaves,0,Sat Jul 4 02:57:12 2015 UTC,"No more or less than consoles. See: original Gears of War. One person hosted and had ""host advantage"". Xbox live is a paid service. PC also has dedicated servers supported by developers on most major releases"
PlayStationPlus,3c0fg2,marimba1982,3,Sat Jul 4 04:18:47 2015 UTC,Lost of FPS multiplayer games had P2P for online MP as they didn't usually have deals with Sony/MS. COD still does it because they have tournaments and can set up to do local MP LAN tournaments that way if PSN or XBL were to go down they wouldn't be affected.

I can say that Rocket League does play a bit ""faster."" The cars' physics seem to fit better on Rocket League. The cars go faster, the action is more frequent and overall the game is better. It's one of those things where you can tell a difference but can't really put your finger on it. It seems like they had a winner with SARPBC, but then proceeded to knock it out of the park with Rocket League."

Seeing SARPBS on the PS3 the controls look a little bit stiff as well as moving around, jumping, and flipping. Gameplay feels slightly flexible in Rocket League. But that's all I can really say just by looking at the old game compared to Rocket League."

PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,specterofthepast,99,Wed Jul 1 21:00:38 2015 UTC,Rocket League is about to change everyone's lives.
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,Some_Italian_Guy,10,Wed Jul 1 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"Excited by Rocket League. As someone who hates most sports in general, it looks like a fun competitive multiplayer game I can get behind."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,FuntimeBen,8,Wed Jul 1 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"I played the beta a lot and it's surprisingly fun. This is just my opinion but I think it could get stale after a while, sounds a bit hypocritical since I just said I had a lot of fun, but it lacked something along the lines of rockets or something to use to attack other players.   I'm sure people will disagree and/or downvote but it just felt like a clusterfuck of cars all jumping for the ball, like chicks jumping for food from their mother.   It just needed something to make it a bit more battle oriented."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,gagsy92,8,Wed Jul 1 17:53:05 2015 UTC,"That isn't the game though. It's just soccer played with rocket powered cars. It isn't meant to have rockets to destroy other players. You can already blow other players up by ramming into them at high speeds.   And who knows, they may have implemented another game type in the full game that does indeed give you rocket launchers."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,Some_Italian_Guy,5,Wed Jul 1 18:15:29 2015 UTC,"I get that that's the whole concept behind the game, but I'm just saying from my experience, it got a bit stale and repetitive, but still fun. I couldn't play it for hours, I would log on, play a handful of games then get bored again.   You either joined the herd of cars jumping for the ball as soon as it reaches ground level or you were essentially playing goal keeper. I hope there is a 'battle' mode where you can get rockets and stuff to use.   Another feature that I think would be cool is if the walls of the dome were gravitised (I know its not a word) so that the ball went up the walls as well. Obviously have the walls on the goal side as they normally are for rebounds and stuff.   Driving on the ceiling of the arena would be pretty cool too. Maybe if you had some sort of a feature on your car that allowed you to stick yourself to the ceiling and when you release that, you drop back onto the pitch.  I'm not hating on the game at all, I think it's a really fun game but I would just like it to have something that won't make it stale for me. Who knows, that was just the beta, they could have a lot more in the full game."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,gagsy92,2,Wed Jul 1 19:44:39 2015 UTC,"Your issue with the game is a result of a lack communication. Happens in all games like this.   To be fair, the start of the beta compared to the second beta, more people knew basic tactics. If you're started at the back, you start the game more defensively for example.    The issue is, defensive play other than goalkeeper doesn't get points, so more people will go for goals."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,TheJoshider10,2,Wed Jul 1 22:32:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I totally understand what you're saying. I just wish that the game would tailor a bit for people like me who will most likely play the majority of this game in random matches with random people."

PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,TheJoshider10,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:53:23 2015 UTC,I got SARPBC when it came out in 2009 and I still play it every now and again. There is still a dedicated fan base that play it and there's usually at least 10 games on the go that you can jump into. Hopefully people will communicate well like in the last game so that the cars are spread out nicely and not just all going for the ball at the same time.

PS+ works best when it highlights games that people might have otherwise ignored, or high-profile games that have been out long enough that nearly everyone who would've bought the game without it being part of PS+ have done so and enjoyed their purchase.  Sony cannot possibly please everyone, but alienating the customers who pay the most money for games on their consoles by immediately dropping them on PS+ will hurt their entire userbase in the long run, because people will lose interest in spending significant amounts of money on games, which will kill developer interest in targeting these consoles with major releases."

For the Beta, there was a single player mode for training in which you learned different playing concepts/some advanced techniques and I'm pretty sure you can skirmish against A.I. but the bulk of the game is multiplayer and the emphasis is strongly toward that end. I don't believe there's going to be a single player mode beyond skirmishes but really there's a lot of fun to be had in multiplayer and its a great time to start given there will be tons and tons of other new players."

PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,NotSafeForShop,39,Wed Jul 1 16:44:10 2015 UTC,"Rain is cool and all, but this is another awful month for PS3 users. The console has 9 years of catalogue, we could have way better games like we had on PS+ before."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,johnymyko,29,Wed Jul 1 17:47:17 2015 UTC,"I used to love PS+ but as someone who only owns a PS3 I'm starting to hate it. It seems to to me that unless you have a PS4 PS+ is a waste of money. There hasn't been a decent game for PS3 in months. Last year we had Bioshock Infinite and Tomb Raider now we get Mousecraft, what the hell! I definitely don't see myself renewing this year. Might start using PSnow, at least I can spend my money on games I actually want to play."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,_THE_WIFE,22,Wed Jul 1 16:25:31 2015 UTC,"On PS3 we had Metro: Last Light, Bioshock Infinite, Borderlands 2 and Guacamelee on the same month! It probably was the last good month we had, before that we had a bunch of good games as well."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,johnymyko,2,Wed Jul 1 16:54:11 2015 UTC,That was over a year ago.
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,MisterTruth,2,Wed Jul 1 17:03:54 2015 UTC,It was in January 2014.
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,johnymyko,3,Thu Jul 2 01:01:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I haven't been subscribed since January of this year.  There's only so much enjoyment I've gotten out of past IGC stuff, and I've only had my PS3 since fall 2013.  Sony hasn't given PS3 only users any value in PS+ at this point."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,MisterTruth,2,Thu Jul 2 01:23:41 2015 UTC,"I'm only keeping my subscription up basically so I can play old games  I haven't finished yet. It's not worth to keep paying for PS+ on PS3 anymore, not enough truly good games."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,johnymyko,2,Thu Jul 2 01:36:39 2015 UTC,"I've only had plus for 1 month ever, and it was that month."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,jvazzie,2,Thu Jul 2 01:41:20 2015 UTC,"It was my first month, i was pumped for the future"
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,jorgegil96,4,Thu Jul 2 02:21:37 2015 UTC,Do you love indie games? Cause that's what us on the ps4 have had to deal with.
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,rebelx,2,Thu Jul 2 03:18:27 2015 UTC,Guess we're in the same boat then :(
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,_THE_WIFE,7,Wed Jul 1 22:15:33 2015 UTC,"I think they could be doing it on purpose though; make the PS4 look more attractive to encourage us PS3 players to upgrade.  But yeah, it's especially annoying because there are so many great PS3 games which have been out long enough to make them PS+ candidates, and considering the number of sequels that are in the works you'd think developers would want to get people hyped by giving out the old games.   For 2013 and most of 2014 we were getting at least one fantastic AAA title every month but now it's getting hard for me to justify my subscription."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,WeWereInfinite,3,Thu Jul 2 03:13:26 2015 UTC,"I don't really see this being it, since the ps4 offerings have largely been jokes as well. Styx is a nice touch, but nothing else offered is really anything to write home about. It's all about Sony making more money, it's not like they're in a great position. They just issued stock and infuriated investors, who have already had eight years of tough times and shrinking growth since the 90s, and are clearly doing everything possible to raise funds."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,triedtostayaway,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:13:55 2015 UTC,"I don't really see this being it, since the ps4 offerings have largely been jokes as well   All the more reason to avoid big PS3 games; they make the PS4 offerings look worse. For a long time PS+ was a huge selling point because it was so good, so much so that Microsoft had to start providing a similar service, so it seems dumb to toss that away.  This is just me speculating, of course. There could be a hundred reasons for the (subjective) drop in quality of PS+ and you may well be right about cutting costs, but I imagine many PS3 owners will unsubscribe if they aren't getting the value they expect from the service which will impact Sony's profits."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,WeWereInfinite,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:17:21 2015 UTC,"So many great ps3 games. I don't care if the games are the newest, I just want them to be good. Hell, I remember being super excited when they had ICO and Ducktales! Lately all the games are like, ""Oh, that's kind of cool"", and then I'm bored with it an hour later. Or it's like, ""Well, my 4 and 6 year olds will be able to play that at least"".   I will say that Race the Sun, from a couple months ago, was surprisingly fun. It has a great old school, arcade feel to it where it's simple but really challenging."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,_THE_WIFE,3,Wed Jul 1 20:49:27 2015 UTC,"I feel for you. The lack of support for the PS3 does pretty much suck. To play devil's advocate though, I'm pretty sure that they are trying to encourage people to make the trade up to a PS4. Not saying that it makes their lack of support legitimate, but I can at least see where they are coming from."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,907gamer,3,Thu Jul 2 03:12:35 2015 UTC,"If the PS4 was backward compatible I wouldn't be hesitant to get one. My old PS3 died about 9 months ago and I thought about just upgrading to the PS4 but I have a ton of PS3 games, so I bought a  new PS3. I have kids so at this point my next console might just be a Wii U."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,_THE_WIFE,2,Wed Jul 1 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"I hear you on that one. I'll be honest, the only reason we have a PS4 instead of a Wii U is because my wife loves watching me play Uncharted. Pretty sure next generation will be Nintendo for my family."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,907gamer,7,Thu Jul 2 03:04:03 2015 UTC,"It seems to to me that unless you have a PS4 PS+ is a waste of money.   Hey man, I'm not digging these indie games we've been getting since PS4's launch.  It's about time they start releasing disc based games on PS4."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,powercorruption,5,Thu Jul 2 03:15:00 2015 UTC,I think he may have been referring to the fact that PS+ is required for online play on PS4.
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,Quick_Over_There,2,Wed Jul 1 17:07:39 2015 UTC,"Which makes it a bigger waste for PS4 users. We're now paying for service that was free for over a decade, while seeing no improvement."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,powercorruption,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:07:27 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, just pointing out that he wasn't saying the games are the reason to pay for PS+ on PS4."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,Quick_Over_There,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:15:34 2015 UTC,I meant that it seems like like they are phasing out ps3 games for ps4 games.
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,_THE_WIFE,3,Wed Jul 1 19:26:18 2015 UTC,"Then it's a bad compromise.  I'd rather have full disc PS3 games, over shitty indie PS4 titles."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,powercorruption,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:34:50 2015 UTC,Me too.
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,_THE_WIFE,2,Thu Jul 2 15:10:02 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest... the PS3 is going to go away eventually. You can't expect to get great free games for it forever, right?"
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,kinyutaka,3,Thu Jul 2 15:24:52 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind them phasing out the ps3 if the ps4 was backwards compatible but it's not.
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,_THE_WIFE,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:37:28 2015 UTC,"It's something they need to work on. But I really think they need to be better about PS4 ports of PS3 games...  After paying for FFX/X-2 3 times, I don't think I should have to shell out another $50 to get it on PS4."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,kinyutaka,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:15:23 2015 UTC,It seems to to me that unless you have a PS4 PS+ is a waste of money.   I'm sure that's why they're doing it. Subtle nudge to upgrade.
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,Tyoung916,7,Thu Jul 2 03:53:17 2015 UTC,Rain is honestly underrated. Come at with an open mind and you'll have a really great time with it.

PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,Streetfoldsfive,3,Wed Jul 1 19:04:34 2015 UTC,The games they gave out before the ps4 launched seemed to be consistently awesome on the ps3. now they are just meh.
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,lobsterwithcrabs,2,Wed Jul 1 17:10:24 2015 UTC,"Yup, the ps4 launch killed ps+ for ps3 users."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,_THE_WIFE,2,Wed Jul 1 17:56:08 2015 UTC,"I bought Rain when it came out because how captivating the release trailer was, but I was pretty heavily let down. The first hour or so is pretty great, but by the end you're just wanting it to be over and the cohesiveness of the atmosphere has really dropped off. Not horrible, but not on the level of Journey like I was hoping from the trailer."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,triedtostayaway,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:40:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got Rain in the beginning of last year. I was excited for it but ultimately let down too.   I can't count the number of times I've played through Journey. Seriously one of the best games."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,_THE_WIFE,2,Wed Jul 1 19:14:17 2015 UTC,Yeah it's feeling like the PS3 is non-stop indie games lately - like Sony doesn't really GAF about PS3 anymore. If this keeps up I probably won't renew PS+ until I get a PS4.

The console is also 9 years old and (imo) getting close to time to cut PS+ ties with it.  It won't happen any time soon because it's so cheap to pad PS+ with but they can't support PS3 PS+ forever."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,IceBreak,5,Thu Jul 2 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"I was in disbelief that we got Rocket League this month. I thought it was going to be a title we pay for, and since with it being a beta game and all, I never thought we would get this game. Styx looks interesting, and with load times, I am not to bad on them, Watch Dogs had that type of load time when you first load the game, but afterwards it ain't too bad. Entiwned, Mousecraft, and Geometry Wars 3 looks interesting.  But still, I predicted that since we got 2 AAA games last month on Ps4 and all, we would only get indies this month but can I ask someone this? Is Styx Master of Shadows a Triple A title, AAA Digital, or indie? Because I heard its from Focus Home Entertainment and it doesn't feel like an indie game."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,Matthew0606,2,Wed Jul 1 19:24:22 2015 UTC,"Some games I almost bought on a whim during sales, but wasn't sure enough on them.  I'm glad I waited.  They look fun."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,Flonnzilla,6,Wed Jul 1 20:00:16 2015 UTC,Rocket league and geometry wars for me
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,Thiagots85,5,Wed Jul 1 16:51:34 2015 UTC,Comments here are a real proof that the games don't matter - people will bi*ch no matter what would be in Plus. Rocket League and Styx are good enough to make this month for me.
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,dabro90,12,Wed Jul 1 15:46:24 2015 UTC,"They gave us Rocket League. Good news for everyone who likes the game....which seems to be the majority of people. I couldn't get into the game really.  Though Rain, Geometry Wars, and Entwined have my interest especially Geometry Wars. Not a great month, but not a bad one.  Also I have never heard of Master of Shadows, for people who have played it what did you think of it?"
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,SIRTreehugger,4,Thu Jul 2 06:59:47 2015 UTC,"If you like stealth games and don't care for graphics, you'll like it. It's a bit challenging at the beginning but does get easier if you're patient.. but that might have been my opinion only because I'm bad at stealth games. The story was enjoyable, though, so I can recommend it!   Entwined however. Eh. Pretentious game that thinks it's art and tries too hard to be 'art'. If you have played Journey or Flower then there is absolutely no reason to touch this game. Even if you haven't.  Still a pretty great month for Rocket League and Styx alone. If you enjoy one of the games in the lineup, then you definitely get your money's worth."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,moadib73rus,2,Wed Jul 1 15:44:10 2015 UTC,Styx had poorly optimized loading. For a stealth game that relies ALOT on trying again the load times should have been better.
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,SirBlobbington,3,Wed Jul 1 16:24:43 2015 UTC,"The lineup is fairly decent, not the best month, but certainly not the worst. Although it does seem kinda unfair that Japan gets 2 extra games in their lineup for the 5th anniversary but the West gets nothing."

PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,penguindude24,5,Thu Jul 2 04:54:35 2015 UTC,It's a great month to bd a Vita owner.
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,Streetfoldsfive,11,Wed Jul 1 16:53:27 2015 UTC,Why even in good months is everyone so cranky?
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,ReptarIsTheShit,3,Wed Jul 1 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"Because a lot of people got PS+ because they would see a really solid bestseller given out for free. It didn't have to be new (the people asking for Witcher 3 are nuts), but seeing titles like Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider, or Metro at least had some name recognition to them. Indie games just don't have that backing, and so when you're expected to ""give it a try"" to some indie game month after month, it gets frustrating."
PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,Thiagots85,7,Wed Jul 1 17:11:36 2015 UTC,Because internet vídeos/people showed us that being angry and cynical is the only way to be famous

PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,blacksheepwall__,2,Wed Jul 1 17:00:22 2015 UTC,I bought Styx ages ago to get my stealth fix.

PlayStationPlus,3brfu2,leshadowbanned69,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:04:46 2015 UTC,Good thing I won't have to spend money in PS+ this month either. I needed a new pair of headphones.  Thank you Sony for keeping  my wallet safe by bringing us quality bargain bin titles.

PLS! great month!! rocket League will b so guuuud
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,Johnathan-,69,Wed Jul 1 15:33:05 2015 UTC,This is probably one of the worst lineups for PS3 players imo.
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,stayquiet1225,10,Wed Jul 1 15:38:35 2015 UTC,"While underwhelming all-around, I've been curious about Rain. I'll happily try it, at least."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,JW_BM,13,Wed Jul 1 15:53:58 2015 UTC,I agree. That's saying a lot since the quality has been in the toilet for ages.
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,MisterTruth,-4,Wed Jul 1 15:49:11 2015 UTC,On PS3? I thought the PS3 has been getting some pretty good games. Maybe the last two months a bit weaker but still. I'm unaware but are Styx and rain bad games?
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,Streetfoldsfive,24,Wed Jul 1 15:50:42 2015 UTC,Take into account the fact that plus isn't required for ps3. You'd think this late in its cycle they would be able to put high quality games each month.
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,MisterTruth,10,Wed Jul 1 15:55:28 2015 UTC,"Especially since PS3 games sales are (presumably) starting to die down, you'd think Sony would want to start dishing out the good stuff in order to keep people interested."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,asportking,12,Wed Jul 1 16:22:15 2015 UTC,"I think they would also like to encourage people to upgrade to a PS4 as well, though."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,Eclipser,-2,Wed Jul 1 17:40:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah your right. Considering that they should give a little bit higher quality titles. They do give AAA's there more often, but this is still a slower month in PS3."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,Streetfoldsfive,7,Wed Jul 1 16:18:40 2015 UTC,Styx is just for ps4.
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,chimianopao,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:16:49 2015 UTC,I just realized my mistake. How is Rain though?
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,Streetfoldsfive,2,Wed Jul 1 16:17:41 2015 UTC,"I never played, it. But seens very good from what I saw in the videos.  In the game the people are invisible and can only be seen because of the rain upon then."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,chimianopao,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:21:22 2015 UTC,"It was a cool game, I didnt mind it."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,CraziBoi94,5,Thu Jul 2 00:31:38 2015 UTC,PS3 has been getting awful bad or ridiculously short games since after the awesome Dishonored many months ago. It is a joke really. No reason for ps3 users to sub anymore.
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,heisenbergfan,3,Wed Jul 1 16:27:42 2015 UTC,Wasn't dishonored like last month? They also got yakuza not too long ago which was cool. Though the line up hasn't been super strong there every month.
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,Streetfoldsfive,4,Wed Jul 1 16:53:42 2015 UTC,"Yakuza was in february, Dishonored was in April.   May, june, July, nothing... and seems to be going downhill  We could have easily BOUGHT dishonored with 1/3rd or 1/4th of the subscription price. And we would have it permanently (can't forget that plus is just a RENT)."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,heisenbergfan,2,Wed Jul 1 17:04:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm not denying that the last few months have been weak. It's just odd because the year started really strong with things like Sherlock, Duck tales, etc."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,Streetfoldsfive,-1,Wed Jul 1 17:07:40 2015 UTC,"Yea, it started decent, even December with hitman HD and the deadly premonition crazy game, i thought those were great. January, february, great months too. After dishonored, not much, sure a few okayish indies like unfinished swan and rain, but c'mon, if that's what im getting i'll just buy what i want instead of subscribing.   For me what is odd is that ps3 games are getting cheaper and cheaper everywhere in the market so It is mind boggling how Sony can't offer any old great games from such a vast library of games."

PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,stayquiet1225,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:13:41 2015 UTC,"It's a relaxing, thought provoking game.  If you need a break from frantic FPS games then Rain is the game for you.  It has a great atmosphere and wonderful score.  I found myself truly caring for the characters."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,stayquiet1225,5,Wed Jul 1 17:26:33 2015 UTC,"The quality of games offered with PS+ has dropped a lot when PS4 came out. Since you need to have a PS+ membership if you want to play online (on PS4), Sony stopped giving out better games because people are paying for the membership anyways."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,MadenX,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:15:08 2015 UTC,"I have been interested in Rain since it was announced, I just never got around to getting it. The Cross buy titles are ok, but I can see what you are saying. The quality in the PS3 titles will probably decline until they stop giving out games for it."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,obi5683,0,Wed Jul 1 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"Rain was like a buck multiple times on sale, I'm not even mad that I bought it already since it was so cheap. Tokyo Jungle is next just watch."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,THE-73est,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:37:35 2015 UTC,Hmmm I could be wrong but Tokyo Jungle was already on Plus.
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,stayquiet1225,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:00:02 2015 UTC,I've wanted to play Rain for ages. Just bought the PS4 though so It'll have to wait for for me to complete Witcher 3 and Arkham Night which will probably make it look and feel like a piece of shit.   Nothing on the PS4 front takes my fancy at all.
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,borez,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:13:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like people say this every month. It's so subjective. I'm really looking forward to rain, Styx and rocket league so this month I'm happy."

PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,Mikeoneus,-1,Sun Jul 5 17:29:22 2015 UTC,Nope. Rocket League makes this one of the best.

PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,Brodivh,-1,Wed Jul 1 21:42:31 2015 UTC,It's not like there hasn't been a huge selection of games for the PS3 though tbf. I wouldn't be surprised if they started phasing it out over the next year
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,MoisturizedGoat,6,Fri Jul 3 00:13:21 2015 UTC,It's not like there hasn't been a huge selection of games for the PS3 though tbf.   what? it has been awful for months man...
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,heisenbergfan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:31:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah for a few months, but it's been going for 5 years now. There's been some huge games come out on it, you can't expect them to keep shelling out for triple A consistently.  Especially as the PS3 will likely be a legacy console in the next few years."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,MoisturizedGoat,2,Wed Jul 1 15:50:32 2015 UTC,"you can't expect them to keep shelling out for triple A consistently   I don't know what to expect, all i know is that it is not worth subbing anymore. And there was almost nothing coming out of the two first years of plus, not sure how could they possibly be relevant to 2015.  when you get only dishonored out of 4 months, what is it worth for.. could have picked that up for $5 on ebay."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,heisenbergfan,0,Wed Jul 1 16:28:36 2015 UTC,it totally is last month also was lackluster I'm really concerned I would gladly see some like much older but triple-A games in lineup than at best mediocre easy short games but newer as long as they trophies I would rather have them
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,wielku,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:39:46 2015 UTC,Me as well X-Box just got AC: Black Flag.  I have a feeling the tides are starting to turn in the battle of the months.
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,pear1jamten,-1,Wed Jul 1 19:06:14 2015 UTC,I thought this would be a happy thread.  Man...hasn't PS3 done well enough lately?  It is nearly a legacy platform after all.

PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,cloudywinds,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:11:34 2015 UTC,"I used to be really good at games with similar play components. Even though luck played a significant factor, you had to have a certain skill level to even have the opportunity to be lucky. My skill level was higher when I had more time to play. I could play a lot and get good, but my interest in this type game will likely not lead to the amount of play time needed to get good. My preferred style of games usually involves exploring to collect stuff that will allow you to explore/fight better (e.g., Terraria, Diablo, Dead Island, etc.)."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,ZoopZeZoop,15,Wed Jul 1 19:24:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I was ready for disappointment."

PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,lumperroosevelt,7,Wed Jul 1 16:07:10 2015 UTC,Give Rocket League a try. I hate soccer games like FIFA but Rocket League is as far removed from a sports simulation as it gets.
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,tmujir955,3,Wed Jul 1 16:43:37 2015 UTC,For PS4 this list is awesome. I've never heard of Rain but it looks interesting so I might start up the PS3 for this one.
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,abyssea,11,Wed Jul 1 15:40:25 2015 UTC,"Rain is cool and all, but this is another awful month for PS3 users. The console has 9 years of catalogue, we could have way better games like we had on PS+ before."

The reviews are excellent for the ios version, and I was planning on buying it, but was nervous about touch controls.  Free for vita is perfectly fine with me!"
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,dubbfoolio,2,Wed Jul 1 20:10:29 2015 UTC,Yep I'm super excited for this month. Rocket League and Geometry Wars! Last few months have been pretty meh for me personally.   FWIW I have Geometry Wars for iOS and it's amazing. Easily one of the best dual stick shooters to come out in a long time.
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,SatansFist,0,Wed Jul 1 17:48:11 2015 UTC,Let the bitching commence!!
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,duende667,3,Wed Jul 1 19:40:56 2015 UTC,Every month - half-dozen games (if you have all 3 systems).. pages of people wanting something better than what they got. Then mass-downvoting anyone who seems even somewhat content.  Every. Single. Month.
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,ReverendVoice,5,Fri Jul 3 14:39:32 2015 UTC,"It's probably fair to say that most of the budget went into rocket league, but nothing wrong with that"
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,armedcombatexpert,2,Wed Jul 1 15:47:18 2015 UTC,"Nothing at all.  They're pushing the PS4 right now, for very smart and very obvious reasons.  The last year has been people bitching about not getting full quality games for the PS4.  This month, PS4 gets a fun multiplayer title and PS3 gets a little less.. but has gotten Dishonored and Sherlock Holmes since January.   I'm sure it isn't always the same people bitching.. but oh my god, there is never NOT bitching - and when people show contentment with the games, downvoted to hell.  It's all very silly how bad this community is. I wouldn't go so far as to say toxic, but definitely strangely entitled when every month gets at least $40 worth of games (Higher if you go by Sony's retail)."
PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,ReverendVoice,0,Wed Jul 1 18:41:18 2015 UTC,You think there's a sense of entitlement here? don't even think of reading the comments on the blog posts.

It's just the best one that fits... it's a 'never satisfied' attitude, and never reveling in the games we get, just bitching about the ones we don't."

Gonna buy an Xbox one so I can get games like that assassins game that's on both consoles ...fuck playstation there's nothing here at all...why aren't sony giving me triple A titles on my machine that's 8 -10 years old now?

PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,tjb1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:13:12 2015 UTC,"Just saying they could have made much more, but someone pretty much explained that it was more about getting the game out there which is something that's totally respected in the gaming industry.

PlayStationPlus,3brg5r,Knight_Soiaire,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:12:15 2015 UTC,"yeah, probably get some good advertising for people to play their games too. Not alot of indie games get featured and if your game is part of Plus it's ought to get attention"

PlayStationPlus,3bs23f,sergev,0,Tue Jul 7 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Tower Guns.  Finished it 100%.  If that is 1995, Futuridium is 1986."

PlayStationPlus,3bs23f,Thiagots85,12,Fri Jul 3 11:59:28 2015 UTC,"Not gonna step on any toes, but I wouldn't really agree with metacritic, at least completely. It is a flawed system that anyone with money can alter. I'm more of a ""player opinions"" kind of guy, and even in that it still is a flawed system, it has been proven several times that some questionable developers/publishers can create fake accounts in order to boost their ratings.  I'm not judging the game until I've played it, and I think everyone should do the same. I know you're not complaining, but I think you're giving it too much thought, specially since this a subjective topic of discussion."
PlayStationPlus,3bs23f,shizknight,3,Wed Jul 1 22:15:09 2015 UTC,And I already own it =\
PlayStationPlus,3bs23f,Addfwyn,3,Wed Jul 1 20:29:02 2015 UTC,I actually really liked that game.
PlayStationPlus,3bs23f,DrunkeNinja,3,Thu Jul 2 04:23:06 2015 UTC,"Entwined is an alright game, it's pretty minus some performance issues.  At the reasonable price of free, I would recommend it.  I just feel a bit burned paying money for it, I finished it in one sitting and it was a bit frustratingly difficult at points (sometimes because of the performance issues and not actual game design)."
PlayStationPlus,3bs23f,StarfighterProx,5,Thu Jul 2 07:41:15 2015 UTC,"Contrast and Aaru's awakening were 59s too, though I don't think either one was out yet on PS4 until they came to Plus.  I liked Contrast well enough, though Aaru was garbage.  Entwined doesn't look too promising either but I will give it a try.  Hopefully it doesn't lead to more sub 60 games."
PlayStationPlus,3bs23f,LeprosySucks,3,Wed Jul 1 18:24:54 2015 UTC,"I almost purchased Entwined just for the amazing music (one of the tracks is played on the PSNow dynamic theme) so I definitely don't mind this coming to PS+. If it ends up being fun, awesome. If not, ROCKET LEAGUE."
PlayStationPlus,3bs23f,Blabadon,2,Thu Jul 2 14:48:03 2015 UTC,"There have certainly been low-rated new games.  Like the Zombii vita game I can't remember the name of.  But those you can't really predict whereas older games you have the info on already.  I liked Contrast too, btw."
PlayStationPlus,3bs23f,ps4hero,2,Wed Jul 1 18:41:53 2015 UTC,The Hungry Horde. It has an average rating of 61.
PlayStationPlus,3bs23f,Blabadon,5,Wed Jul 1 18:59:25 2015 UTC,"Entwined is extremely shallow, and I definitely wouldn't have the tolerance for it if not for the Vita port. Beat it in a day but I extracted nothing out of it. It feels like a mobile game that needed analog sticks to be quite honest. I gave it a 3/10"

PlayStationPlus,3bs23f,Dodis,4,Wed Jul 1 21:26:51 2015 UTC,Yeah they used to say that games in the IGC are top rated which meant a score of 70 or above on metacritic

Because lets not forget the other gems they gave us; Metrico, Race the sun, and the absolute crown, Proteus.  Seriously, some devs are really taking the term ""game"" too loosely. IGC should just call it what it is. ""Games and artsy crap""."

PlayStationPlus,3bumel,Matthew0606,8,Thu Jul 2 07:46:40 2015 UTC,"AAA doesn't just mean 'anything that isn't indie'.          A hefty budget is required to qualify as an AAA. It's the video game equivalent of a blockbuster.  Styx fits neither indie nor AAA, it's just a game release."
PlayStationPlus,3bumel,Matt4045,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:52:27 2015 UTC,Styx is more classified as an AA game.
PlayStationPlus,3bumel,bongo1138,0,Thu Jul 2 16:31:23 2015 UTC,I agree. I could also say an AAA game that just flew under the radar and didn't got must attention at all.
PlayStationPlus,3bumel,iamhappylight,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:58:36 2015 UTC,^ This. AAA means high production value. It means millions of dollars was invested into the making of the game (though that doesn't guarantee the quality of the product). Just because a game is published by a large publisher doesn't mean it's AAA.
PlayStationPlus,3bumel,happyscrappy,0,Thu Jul 2 16:32:57 2015 UTC,"Yes. Well what would you classify Styx Master of Shadow then as? There is a person who said that the games that aren't made by big publishers, etc but not intended to be blockbusters are like B games, which are like B movies."
PlayStationPlus,3bumel,01luca01,4,Thu Jul 2 18:03:27 2015 UTC,Indie is ill defined. And not just on PSN.
PlayStationPlus,3bumel,TheGallifreyan,0,Thu Jul 2 16:05:23 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, it is truly ill defined."
PlayStationPlus,3bumel,01luca01,8,Thu Jul 2 18:05:06 2015 UTC,Also Valiant Hearts is developed and published by Ubisoft but nobody mentions it when listing AAA games that have been part of IGC
PlayStationPlus,3bumel,snaper,7,Thu Jul 2 09:18:43 2015 UTC,"I always thought AAA meant big budget. They type of game that gets TV commercials and could probably bankrupt a country if they bomb. Not just any game from a ""AAA"" company."
PlayStationPlus,3bumel,CleonClarke,3,Thu Jul 2 10:33:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you. We can't define it indie either because Ubisoft is far from being and independent development team. We should create a definition for titles like these. I think this mess is due to the AAA vs indie duality assuming there's nothing in between. I guess the term AAA is taken from ratings like the ones related to banks reliability, so it should come with inferior classes like AA, A, B, etc."
PlayStationPlus,3bumel,bongo1138,-1,Thu Jul 2 10:54:00 2015 UTC,"Good idea. Sometimes I refer to them as AAA Digital, or B games. Not intended to be a blockbuster."
PlayStationPlus,3bumel,virindimaster,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:05:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah. They don't seem to do that. Sometimes I refer to these games as AAA Digital. There has to be a middle ground here and there. They are even some digitally made games from the in-house of Sony that are considered indie by everyone else, but actually they are middle ground games."

Its story is really interesting and the difficulty the game has is challenging but fun. The game has 8  different ending, so it'll have you coming back for more. I bought it back in October and when I started it, I couldn't put it down. The decisions you make in the game effect the story and boy, does the story getting really good depending on what choices you choose. 10/10 would recommend.  And for that price, you're getting your moneys worth! According to PSprices.com, that's the 2nd lowest price Catherine has gone for without a PS+ subscription.  edit: fixed spelling"
PlayStationPlus,3bohum,Quique19_96,2,Wed Jul 1 00:27:33 2015 UTC,What kind of game is it exactly? I watched the trailer but it seemed to just be cutscenes.
PlayStationPlus,3bohum,Selykg,9,Wed Jul 1 02:21:30 2015 UTC,"It's a puzzle platformer about a guy named Vincent who has a girlfriend named Katherine and she wants to get married and Vincent doesn't want to because he feels it's not the right thing to do at the moment and then he goes out to drink with his friends as usual but one night, he drinks a little bit too much and he wakes up next to a girl named.. Catherine.   He has to choose wether or not to continue his relationship with Katherine or Catherine, the girl he woke up next to. And his nightmares(where the gameplay takes place) differ from the events that go on in the story. Depending on what choices you choose change the story and it's really interesting to go back in another playthrough and select different choices from what you originally chose to see the outcome of the story."
PlayStationPlus,3bohum,Quique19_96,3,Wed Jul 1 02:48:27 2015 UTC,Interesting. Looks like I need to get the PS3 hooked up again.   Thanks!

After playing both Betas the last couple of months, the game is shaping up to be very awesome. The online worked very well in beta and it's just really fun. Also during the Playstation livecast during E3 they showed some gameplay for the exclusive Twisted Metal Sweet Tooth ice cream truck so I like to see these guy go into making stuff like that"

Perhaps they'll react to MS's stellar offering next month with 2 AAA for their current gen console (Gears of War 3 will be backwards compatible).
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,cpnHindsight,3,Tue Jun 30 20:13:50 2015 UTC,"yeah Sony really are holding back their first party games. I assume they given up on that, the last time I can remember was before the PS4 came out. I like to think back when they did it on the PS3 it was to get people to buy Plus whereas now everybody has Plus for multiplayer and it would mean they be throwing away money b having their own games put up."

PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,cpnHindsight,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:14:56 2015 UTC,"G-Police:       G-Police is a shooter video game, developed and published by Psygnosis in 1997 for the PlayStation and PC.   The game spawned a single sequel, G-Police: Weapons of Justice, released in 1999 for the PlayStation. This sequel received similar reviews to those of the original game. In 2007, G-Police was made available for download on the PlayStation Network (Europe only).  The game has a science-fiction setting, inspired by Blade Runner. The story takes place in the year 2097, on a colonised Callisto (one of Jupiter's moons). The game charts the protagonist Slater's attempts to discover the truth behind his sister's mysterious death while working for the titular G-Police. The game begins with the G-Police combating organised criminals before fighting the private armies of powerful corporations in an unfolding conspiracy-themed plot. The gameplay involves piloting VTOL aircraft resembling helicopters, engaging in combat with enemies and protecting allies.  The game made use of cutting edge technology such as force–feedback joysticks and controllers, 3D sound and Direct3D Hardware Acceleration and was largely well received. Critics noted that the game's graphics were some of the most technically impressive of the time. Overall, however, critics had mixed response for the graphics, as the demanding graphics resulted in poor draw distance; in particular, the PlayStation version struggled in this aspect. In general, the gameplay was favourably reviewed, with critics praising the solid, enjoyable missions, though there were complaints regarding a poor control system and unfairly high levels of difficulty.

Metal Gear (while not for me) is neither 2D nor indie.  And as a software developer, every software product has bugs. You will never find everything. Big programs (like games) are complex, difficult to test, and the developer doesn't typically have final say on when a game is shipped.

PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,Doomsdays97,6,Wed Jul 1 13:45:10 2015 UTC,I wasn't trying to make the point they were 2d I was showing why he was wrong. Personality I love indies and think that they are the only source of fresh and new ideas.  Also you should try it unfinished swan it's a beautiful game :)
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,specterofthepast,-10,Tue Jun 30 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"Fresh and new ideas? Oh yes because 2d platformers are really fresh and new...  Unless I downloaded it the month it was free, I'm not gonna play it. I can't justify paying for game that was on PS+ before unless I really want it."
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,ps4hero,6,Tue Jun 30 20:07:37 2015 UTC,"So every game needs to invent a new genre now? Batman can't be good despite being third-person action? Helldivers can't be good despite being a twin-stick shooter? Diablo III can't be good despite being an isometric action RPG?  You're pissed they're not to your taste. I get that. But your arguments are ridiculous. When you're so reductive you create a position that is impossible to defend. Rogue Legacy and OlliOlli 2 are both 2D and both indie, but they are vastly different games with very different mechanics.  Passing them up because you've sorted them as ""2D indie"" games does them and you a disservice. There's fun to be had there, and there can be innovation without inventing a new genre."
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,jclast,-6,Tue Jun 30 20:25:42 2015 UTC,"I just want new innovative things.  Like this month's games. Super Exploding Zoo. I love this game so much, it's a type of game I never played before at least that I can remember. Yes it is 2D but it is fun as hell.  Skulls of the shogun(I think that was this month) I love strategy games so I like this one.  My biggest issue is, indie devs are kinda afraid to take leaps, so they churn out 2d games that usually are platformers or rouge-like, instead of thinking up something new."
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,ps4hero,3,Tue Jun 30 20:51:21 2015 UTC,"You're confusing ""doesn't do anything new"" with ""I don't like it."" To use Rogue Legacy as an example you've got persistent upgrades (not super common in rogue-likes) which unlock new classes, finding blueprints and runes to create equipment that can be used across plays, the genealogy system and associated traits (color-blind character make the world sepia-toned, near-sighted and far-sighted characters have the far and near portions of the screen blurred to simulate the -sigtedness of the character), and depending on what character you pick not every run is about ""try to beat the game"" (grabbing a spelunker means my run will be about collecting money to upgrade my manor, unlock classes, and purchase equipment and runes).  Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean a game does nothing to stand out from the pack in its genre."
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,cpnHindsight,8,Tue Jun 30 20:59:26 2015 UTC,"Rouge legacy, the binding of Isaac, don't stave, luftrausers, Olli Olli. How can you argue that these games aren't unique. Rouge legacy family system is completely unique with the only who game using it is on the vita and that was released after. No other game uses the zelda formula better than Isaac and has a amazing style to go along with it."
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,frozengash,-3,Tue Jun 30 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"BoI is a wonderful game don't get me wrong I own the original on PC, I sadly wasn't around when it was free on here.  Rouge, I'm not a fan of the die repeatedly to progress type games.  Never heard of luftrausers.  Olli Olli looks like an old flash game I used to play."
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,jclast,3,Tue Jun 30 20:21:53 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what a game looks like, a film isn't shit cause it's black and white or if it's not 1080p. You say you don't like game where you die to progress but that's what Isaac is."
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,ps4hero,-2,Tue Jun 30 20:26:50 2015 UTC,Variety is nice.  So why is it bad to have some indie now rice cereal mixed in with the AAA marshmallows?  If we ate nothing but marshmallows we'd get sick and the IGC wouldn't be economically viable.
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,jclast,10,Tue Jun 30 19:38:43 2015 UTC,"I enjoy indies just fine. Even 2d ones  But please don't pretend that we're anywhere close to getting sick of ""marshmallows""   We've gotten Injustice in the IGC. Literally 1 AAA full game. That's it. And it was a port  We got DLC for Infamous, we got a tiny prequel game (Metal Gear)  We didn't even get the Driveclub ""full AAA minus a few cars and tracks"" version that was promised for launch of the console.  They set expectations that AAA would be included, they haven't delivered, and they've given way too many 2d games   None of that can really be argued"

PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,xTeriosx,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:56:05 2015 UTC,"Reduced yes but their actual quote was ""minus a few cars and tracks"" they removed 80% so we only got a few"
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,Kwrzyx,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:21:11 2015 UTC,Ah. I didn't follow it very closely at all. I'm much more of a Burnout guy when it comes to racing. Stinks to hear that. I thought most of their problems were network stuff. I wonder why they ended up removing more content from the Plus version.
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,xTeriosx,4,Wed Jul 1 05:48:47 2015 UTC,"Uhh we've had three marshmellows.  One was a bad port, one was a stand alone DLC, the other was the length of a demo.  I'm not saying the indies are bad, but just FFS give us something than the 2d ones."
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,Qraparta,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:43:12 2015 UTC,"I expected atleast 1 marshmallow each month, i would get all the rice cereals on steam for much cheaper and since they are 2d i would have no performace issues"

PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,Fbolanos,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:25:38 2015 UTC,How much are fightsticks for PS4s? With Guilty Gear and SFV(and well MKX but that's not exclusive) I'm so happy with PS4 having such high quality fighting games.
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,ThyGrimOfDeath,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:29:28 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the Mad Catz are full price at 200 right now(what I'm buying) but I like the brand. They've served me well.  If you don't want to pay that there's the Hori RAP 4 Kai which goes for 150 that I hear is nice. Doesn't use sanwa buttons but I hear it's the way to go if you don't want to get a MCZ. I'll probably pick one up later.  Anything less than that and you're basically paying for a case and PCB. I don't suggest it unless you want to solder in new buttons and a stick.  If you're not in a rush to get one for the SFV beta wait for Evo. They usually have codes that take 10-20 percent off. Unfortunate that if you wait for that code you might not get your fightstick in time as the beta is July 23-28th.
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,broncosmang,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:37:25 2015 UTC,I don't mean I would like to see AAA games all the time but 2-4 times a year would be fine for me. Playing indie games is alot of the time super fun also but they are so short
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,ColinZealSE,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:52:12 2015 UTC,I don't think 1 AAA per month on PS4 is too much to ask for.  PS3 was sometimes getting 3 in a month.  I don't need that.  I don't want indies to go away.  I just want balance.

PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,TimeTravelingDog,10,Tue Jun 30 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"I would find that surprising. AC4 is in Games with Gold (Xbox) this month, and I don't think there's ever been a month where the same game has been in both PS+ and Games with Gold."

PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,Soul_Doubt,21,Tue Jun 30 16:32:59 2015 UTC,Dude. Black Flag is the tits. Best AC game IMO.
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,tbx5959,5,Tue Jun 30 16:45:24 2015 UTC,"Not the best AC game, but definitely the best Pirate game ever.  And that ending will tug your heart strings."
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,Dodis,5,Tue Jun 30 17:21:51 2015 UTC,"AC4 is a close second to AC2.  You can't beat Ezio's origin story - one of the most complete and epic in gaming history.  From teenaged romancing and fist fights to the head of the Assassin's order and the founding of the brotherhood... awesome.   That said, AC4 had absolutely INCREDIBLE game play.  Nothing like heading out, blowing some shit up, singing some sea shanties, and taking over some ships.  The only thing AC4 lacked was a more cohesive story.  Absolutely incredible game though, and vastly underrated.  It suffered a bit from the underwhelming AC3.  If you haven't played it, you really should find a way."
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,obi5683,3,Tue Jun 30 18:15:46 2015 UTC,but definitely the best Pirate game ever.   Imma let you finish but Sid Meyer's Pirates! is the best Pirate game ever.
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,blazecc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:29:54 2015 UTC,The 4th one is actually pretty good.  I'd be over the moon if it was one of the games.

PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,blazecc,-19,Tue Jun 30 18:59:20 2015 UTC,It'll probably be an indie game I don't give a fuck about and a AAA I just bought during the recent sale. That's how it always works for me.

PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,Dodis,7,Tue Jun 30 14:13:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If everyone found out today, the front page would be full of posts about how a past month was better, people ending their PS+ subscription because the games they want aren't being offered (which they won't actually do because they will lose access to the games they actually like), posts about all of the indie titles, etc. Complainers, the lot of you. I know the service isn't free, but for the amount we pay, I think it's worth it.  Edit: I shouldn't generalize. There are a good number of complaints, but it's not everyone."

PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,Hawk798,8,Tue Jun 30 16:05:05 2015 UTC,For me it's really about the lack of consistency Sony has shown with all the updates. It shouldn't be that hard to stick to a date after so much time doing it a certain way.
PlayStationPlus,3bmqij,360walkaway,2,Tue Jun 30 14:53:13 2015 UTC,US and EU should mirror each other from now on. We should see a more consistent update.

PlayStationPlus,3bnpez,bigbiemusic,4,Wed Jul 1 14:23:26 2015 UTC,I don't understand why everyone is saying Rocket League. They announced on twitter that it would launch at 19.99

PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,PokeLinkEB,7,Tue Jun 30 14:50:43 2015 UTC,"I think the issue here is that Sony wants you to stay subscribed or resubscribe.  You can say, well, what if I want to throw money and sony and just buy the game - unless it is a first party game Sony is only getting a percentage of the sale, anyway.  Let's say 30 percent which is what it seems to be on other digital storefronts.  So if the game is 20 bucks they get 6 bucks - you'd have to rebuy a lot of your plus games to equal the cut they get of PS+ which is going to be 100 percent digitally and who knows what share the retailer gets if it is a card."

PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,edhere,3,Tue Jul 7 05:31:01 2015 UTC,"Well I don't mind having the game only accessed through Plus. The only problem this affects are people who don't have the money to keep the subscription going and can only afford up to 3 months. As for most people who have Plus, it wouldn't be much of a problem. So you can't buy the game aside form Plus, ok so it means I'm paying 50$ for all the games I have in my Plus library every year just to play them including the new Plus games. Seems like a good deal. I could see that paying for the games in your Plus library over and over can make people mad but at the same time you are also paying alot for new Plus games coming soon too so it's not liking your wasting money. But the only thing that they need to fix is aside from Plus but digital games overall is the online license for these games as we saw when PSN was down during Christmas due to that whole controversy, digital games couldn't be accessed because of the license, PS3 never had that and it sucks that all digital games need online connection to be accessed."

I've switched to mostly just waiting for sales and buying games outright instead of using +. Still keep track of the monthly games, but I think in the long term it's better for people who want to own games not to have +.   There is one big HOWEVER to this though and that's that I've tried out and loved a slew of games I wouldn't have otherwise (this month's Call of Juarez offering for example). In that regard it's paid off in spades."
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,DreadnaughtHamster,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:17:28 2015 UTC,Yep. That's pretty much basically the same approach i am going to take with this.

I don't see why this should ever be an issue (especially given that PS+ rarely if ever gives us the AAA titles that would have a physical edition form anyway)."
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,PhillAholic,3,Tue Jun 30 21:46:27 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. Maybe you got the ps4 as a gift or had saved up a lot for it. Different circumstances for different people.

The issue is PS+ has no way of letting me purchase a full license for games i want to keep indefinitely.   Knowing PS+ has licensing issues, i will simply purchase the games i want to own, rather than renting them for $50 a year.   I'm sure i've posted this already but i'll say it again to you. Had i redeemed the 3 years and got a free game. I would not be able to unlock the full license for that game until 3 years have passed. Money is not the issue here."
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,DKnight32x,2,Wed Jul 1 07:37:13 2015 UTC,"What you said about how you should be able to afford ps+ is absolutely ridiculous. Not everybody is in the same situation.... I,  for example, am I college student with no job. I got my ps4 for Christmas but I have absolutely no income to be able to afford ps+ or whatever else even though I do in fact have a ps4. It's silly to just assume that."
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,shinHardc0re,-5,Wed Jul 1 05:04:28 2015 UTC,... You can do one odd job one day on one weekend for 30 bucks. wait for a sale and get it. How is that hard? Having a sony console without + is silly you're missing out on like 40 games a year on ps4 alone
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,broncosmang,2,Wed Jul 1 05:17:08 2015 UTC,"I do have plus, myself. But there are thousands of other people that are my age and younger that are in the same boat I described. When I was in high school I had several friends who were without xbox live all the time, and I knew next to nobody who bought it a year at a time because 50 bucks is steep as hell to people without jobs... On top of that though I have no idea where I would get a job to do for one weekend. I don't live in a city or anything. I don't have any idea where I would possibly find one day of work.   Edit: Also I think calling it ""silly"" to not have it is a bit much. It's not necessary and most of the time (especially for ps4) the ICG lineups blow chunks."

PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,Zachary_Morris,0,Thu Jul 2 02:14:12 2015 UTC,"http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/PlayStation-Plus-Support/Buying-games-that-ps-plus-gives-for-free/td-p/40139969  That is one huge oversight. Waiting for your PS+ to expire to purchase what you want to keep or try your luck with customer support and have purchased games expiring.  I'd rather pay up front even if not right away and be able to keep my games as a legacy. Anyone know if XB1 GwG suffers from the same issue? If you have gold does that mean you can't purchase a previously free XB1 game as well...  They should just add a upgrade license option. Why would they turn down more money?  For example, i currently have 3 un-redeemed codes for PS+ for a total of 36 months. If i were to redeem them now and i did not know about this licensing issue and got all the Castlevania games free on instant game collection, i would have to wait 3 years to purchase them to keep indefinitely rather than rent."
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,okaythiswillbemymain,2,Tue Jun 30 15:15:29 2015 UTC,The article fails to answer whether your PS+ version will automatically switch over to the 'purchased' version when it expires.  That would seem the most logical way to code it.
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,okaythiswillbemymain,5,Tue Jun 30 18:18:39 2015 UTC,"they don't switch, you lose access"
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,Zachary_Morris,4,Tue Jun 30 20:21:17 2015 UTC,I don't see the issue here. You're upset that you have to wait for your sub to expire to buy a game? Why would that bother you.
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,madbubers,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:42:46 2015 UTC,Because i have 3 years worth of plus and i would REALLY hate it if i had to wait 3 years to finally purchase a game.
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,okaythiswillbemymain,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:44:27 2015 UTC,Plus you cant buy games that have a PS Plus deal.
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,Zachary_Morris,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:19:25 2015 UTC,Do you mean bundles? I don't see why you wouldn't be able to take advantage of a sale on a single item. Or are you saying that you won't own a full license to a game you buy at a discounted price... because that's even worse!
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,Zachary_Morris,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:57:00 2015 UTC,"Bundles is a good example of this, if it doesnt work."
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,Zachary_Morris,0,Wed Jul 1 14:25:11 2015 UTC,"If your talking about discounts, your wrong. If you pay any amount of money for a game you own it, even if the plus deal is 99% off. You don't need to keep your ps plus sub to play those games."
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,Zachary_Morris,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:04:39 2015 UTC,"Yup straight from their FAQ - ""Any content you purchase with a plus discount is yours to keep, regardless of membership status."""
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,NoozeHound,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:48:48 2015 UTC,"Eh? The point of this is that you can't buy the game at all if you already have it on PS Plus for free.  So the problem works thusly:  2015 - You get a game on PS Plus for free.  2016 - You see that game for cheap as a PS Plus Discount, but cant buy it, because you have it free.  2017 - You let PS Plus expire. You lose access to that game you love. That game is now expensive to buy as the discount has gone."
PlayStationPlus,3bmy1v,pathfinder35,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:21:43 2015 UTC,But you already have access to the game to play whenever you want for the next three years. So why do you hate that you need to wait until that's over to pay full price for it.

PlayStationPlus,3blool,NipplesOnToast,2,Tue Jun 30 13:15:01 2015 UTC,Is there a release date?
PlayStationPlus,3blool,neoman4426,3,Tue Jun 30 13:22:55 2015 UTC,"No firm one, all we have currently is before release they said they were shooting for sometime in Summer for the eventual expansion. I believe the quote went something like release in November, time off except for bug fixes and stuff until January where they would start work on the then unnamed expansion and shoot for a release sometime in Summer. It's basically Rebirth's version of the original's Wrath of the Lamb if that's something you're aware of.   ==EDIT== a lot of people are thinking we might get the release date next week, either Afterbirth, other consoles, or both, based on the teaser line at the end usually being a hint (last week's was ""next week shit gets small"", this was about small rooms primarily, the week before that was ""till next time"" which might be a hint towards the time component of the scoring system (( a bit of a stretch)), this weeks is ""next week… we announce something? "")"
PlayStationPlus,3blool,ScottSherrod,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:18:00 2015 UTC,Tyrone said in a twitch stream that they would release it simply when it's finished but that there is a good chance we will have it before we're eating turkey.

PlayStationPlus,3bksbe,Steelavenger,6,Tue Jun 30 08:23:01 2015 UTC,"Since the Black Friday sale with the Assassin's Creeed Liberation white Vita.

I used to be very anti-digital... now I am just pro physical media and am ok with buying digital from time to time.  If there is anyone else like me out there... getting me to go into the store and download ""free"" games made me be in the store and start buying games."
PlayStationPlus,3bksbe,specterofthepast,5,Tue Jun 30 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"Same here, I got it when I got that VITA, because the games you got seemed to basically cover the year's cost. At that time you got the Uncharted game for VITA, which I found to be okay. A lot better than many made it out to be. Other than using every funky input method whether it made sense or not it was a decent game.  It was Black Friday 2012, btw."

I didn't care for the picture taking stuff or having to go turn a lamp on because the light in my room wasn't bright enough for the camera.  But, they did a fantastic job capturing the action of the original.  It's definitely the best shooter I've played on the vita... which doesn't say a lot.  Did people badmouth Golden Abyss?  I might be giving it too much credit because it was free but it's one of like half a dozen good Vita games.  They need to give that system more love."

PlayStationPlus,3bp8pg,TheGallifreyan,3,Wed Jul 1 02:34:19 2015 UTC,A demo will typically only allow you to play a limited time. This allows you to virtually play the entire game if you don't mind missing out on cars. They also don't offer free DLC in demo's either and you get a free car and track each month or so with the free version.
PlayStationPlus,3bp8pg,nightdrifter05,2,Wed Jul 1 02:09:26 2015 UTC,A separate version.  A 'demo' doesn't let you experience the whole game.

PlayStationPlus,3bjw71,Bob_Chiquita,2,Mon Jun 29 23:56:36 2015 UTC,This seems to be the best solution. It just tacks the time onto the end of what you already have.  If you can find a 12 month card online for cheaper that is an even better solution!
PlayStationPlus,3bjw71,project23,3,Tue Jun 30 05:51:16 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it renews as whatever you have.  If you want a 1 year, buy a 1 year."
PlayStationPlus,3bjw71,Romiress,2,Mon Jun 29 22:14:44 2015 UTC,"No, I also have 3 Month and it renews to 3 Month every time"
PlayStationPlus,3bjw71,uwo1s,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:49:14 2015 UTC,"It will renew as a 3 month. I keep forgetting to upgrade to yearly to save money, and it keeps renewing me at the 3 month price."
PlayStationPlus,3bjw71,TheCriton,-2,Tue Jun 30 00:13:39 2015 UTC,"From the official FAQ, it says it will renew for the smallest amount, which makes it sound like it always gives you a three month subscription no matter what."
PlayStationPlus,3bjw71,lukeschett,6,Mon Jun 29 22:23:07 2015 UTC,isnt the samllest amount 1 month ?
PlayStationPlus,3bjw71,ombus,-4,Mon Jun 29 23:42:12 2015 UTC,They don't make one month subscriptions from what I can tell. I haven't seen any legitimate one month subs anywhere. The smallest official one I've ever seen is three months.
PlayStationPlus,3bjw71,lukeschett,2,Tue Jun 30 02:33:10 2015 UTC,"well on the playstation official page are 12, 3, and 1 month so.."

PlayStationPlus,3bigfs,obi5683,17,Mon Jun 29 15:26:36 2015 UTC,No.  This is EU.  Deal with it.

PlayStationPlus,3bigfs,arthurzp,21,Tue Jun 30 02:09:09 2015 UTC,So like 10 people will get it. Yay :P  Asian region had a good 5 years anniversary gift.
PlayStationPlus,3bigfs,Zioman,4,Mon Jun 29 14:53:47 2015 UTC,I think that's why they decided to do it   It's not gonna cost them much
PlayStationPlus,3bigfs,wielku,4,Mon Jun 29 14:59:31 2015 UTC,And they fucking earned it.  PS+ was not great early on.  I subbed before the IGC when it was okay but if you didn't like Minis and PS1 games it was rough for those first few months.
PlayStationPlus,3bigfs,IceBreak,-2,Mon Jun 29 15:43:32 2015 UTC,"Was the Asian region better than a personalized poster that shows your game achievements? Because this is pretty lame, considering people payed $200+ for the subscription all these years. I'd rather get nothing to be honest."
PlayStationPlus,3bigfs,TheWhiteeKnight,2,Tue Jun 30 04:41:30 2015 UTC,"Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, etc) got extra month of PS+ with a purchase of 12-month subscription, free multiplayer weekend for PS4 and a PS+ challenge.  Japan got a 5-month subscription for 1555 yen (~$13), two extra games in PS+ (Batman for Vita and Guilty Gear for PS4), contests with 5 Vitas and 55 5-year subscriptions to win, PS+ challenge and a couple extra PSP classics added to PS+ each month between now and March 2016 (Patapon and Disaster Report in July)."

PlayStationPlus,3bhyto,wielku,-3,Mon Jun 29 11:24:57 2015 UTC,How is that amazing? Doesn't that mean we get the games one week later than supposed to?
PlayStationPlus,3bhyto,MisterRez,17,Mon Jun 29 11:32:51 2015 UTC,"One day earlier. Previously games launched on the first Wednesday of the month, excluding months that start on a Wednesday due to NA PS+ games launching on the first Tuesday of the month and Sony not wanting to give NA the games 6 days later than Europe."
PlayStationPlus,3bhyto,poklane,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:59:11 2015 UTC,"PS Plus in europe was always the first wednesday after the first tuesday. so if the month starts on a tuesday, then you get it on the 2nd. if a month starts on a wednesday then you get it on the 8th."
PlayStationPlus,3bhyto,docbauies,-1,Mon Jun 29 18:18:56 2015 UTC,Well we have been for the last 12 months anyway (it only happens once every 6 or 7 months) - but what it also means is we get them one day earlier all 12 months of the year.

PlayStationPlus,3bitgt,Matt4045,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:49:55 2015 UTC,I am sorry but they have changed the blog announcements a lot. Few months ago it would be on the last week of the previous month. Before that it was different too.
PlayStationPlus,3bitgt,heisenbergfan,2,Mon Jun 29 21:50:57 2015 UTC,"It is usually announced on the last Wednesday of the month. But with the exception of when the first day of the month is a Wednesday, it gets pushed back a week. This is because it would mean EU would get their games first, and so to avoid upsetting NA they push it back a week.  It has been like this for a long, long time."
PlayStationPlus,3bitgt,Matt4045,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:02:16 2015 UTC,They've changed the release date for EU. From now on we get it the same time as USA on a Tuesday.
PlayStationPlus,3bitgt,harker26,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:41:53 2015 UTC,"This wasn't the case for last month, so if true, this must be a very recent thing.  I doubt it though, as the EU store doesn't update till Wednesday, and sometimes games are in Plus on the first day they release.  Edit: Ah it seems to be true, I wonder how new releases will be handled. Whether they'll update the store on Tuesdays now or whether we just have to wait a day for those."
PlayStationPlus,3bitgt,Matt4045,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:15:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I only read about it yesterday. I'm not sure if they confirmed the whole EU store update would now happen on a Tuesday or just the IGC. I'm guessing we weren't that lucky and the store updates and new releases will continue on Wednesdays
PlayStationPlus,3bitgt,harker26,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:30:47 2015 UTC,Not that long.  It used to be the first Monday of the month with a new game released each Tuesday of the month on the store.  This was just last year.
PlayStationPlus,3bitgt,Juddston,5,Mon Jun 29 22:28:34 2015 UTC,This coming thursday.

PlayStationPlus,3bitgt,obi5683,2,Mon Jun 29 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"They didn't change this in addition to games being released the first Tuesday? Oh well, the US games are announced on Wednesday at 5 PM BST here and they have been the same for a while now."
PlayStationPlus,3bcgh2,abyssea,3,Sat Jun 27 22:17:12 2015 UTC,Yeah it's the same for Shadow Warrior. But I think it maybe because the discount is over? I know Shadow Warrior was on discount before the flash sale for Plus members and it still shows the discount even though it's now on a flash sale. It could be that they didn't update the games discount prices or that they didn't know there was a discount on those games and set it for the flash sale discount. Road Not taken may be the same thing. According to the website those PS Plus discounts seem to not exist and the games are supposed to be set for all users to pay the flash sale price now. So I would say the PS Plus discount is over unfortunately and I wouldn't want to wait until the weekend is is over with to find out or else the price will go back to 14.99
PlayStationPlus,3bcgh2,JT-Lionheart,3,Sun Jun 28 05:07:26 2015 UTC,"Had the same thing happen when viewing shadow Warrior, was disappointed to not be able to save the extra buck, and more so worried that there was something wrong with my account after I recently resubscribed after running out of my last subscription for a day, then resubscribing. glad there's a reasonable explanation here, thanks."
PlayStationPlus,3bcgh2,serinbo,2,Sun Jun 28 08:07:08 2015 UTC,There isn't a discount for PS+. It's 5.25 for everyone.
PlayStationPlus,3bcgh2,Romiress,2,Sat Jun 27 22:23:31 2015 UTC,$4.50
PlayStationPlus,3bcgh2,Romiress,3,Sat Jun 27 22:26:28 2015 UTC,"Thats... bizarre. It's not announced on the blog post. I'd assume it's some kind of bug, or a pulled discount."

It does all your games at once.  No more having to select each one and click download/wait/cancel.

PlayStationPlus,3b9kzv,dumbelts,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:05:45 2015 UTC,They haven't done anything yet- wait for the announcements. This is a community competition. Competitions are always region specific and there are probably more than a handful US ones on right now.
PlayStationPlus,3b9kzv,Sicmay,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:05:00 2015 UTC,Anyone know what it takes to qualify for this? I know I have been using it from pretty close to the beginning but have had times where my subscription lapsed a few times near the start when I was buying it in 1-3 month chunks due to budget and PS+ not being what it is today.
PlayStationPlus,3b9kzv,Toysoldier34,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:31:36 2015 UTC,Check the link above. It's a competition and you have until 3rd of July to enter.

PlayStationPlus,3b9kzv,TGrady902,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:44:51 2015 UTC,"Well, we know now. You should have got another mail asking for your address so they can send you a print with your accomplishments over the past 5 years on it. I have filled out my address, maybe it'll look nice, and if not there's always room in the bin."

I am actually less interested since the email said it was personalised, as that means it'll be an avatar or something useless, rather than an extra game or discount, etc."

PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,rauelius,2,Fri Jun 26 21:52:42 2015 UTC,Seriously; that website just reminded me why I have adblock installed all the time. I got two full screen ads back to back as soon as I loaded the page.

PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,baskei95,3,Fri Jun 26 20:52:03 2015 UTC,"Bought it and playing it now, it's an awesome games as far as I can tell. Full of unique weapons and perks along with a beautiful design. Kinda like heretic if you played that back in the day"
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,farhadk,2,Sat Jun 27 05:43:45 2015 UTC,"agreed. it's surprisingly fun.  and one thing i like a lot is how tight and responsive it feels when jumping/moving around. the only problem i have is when switching guns it feels like there's too much of a delay... but other than that, it's a great game!"
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,zezbrah,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:12:25 2015 UTC,"yeah the gameplay seems very fluid, game design looks amazing too.  how are the trophies? does it have a platinum?"
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,baskei95,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:56:20 2015 UTC,"yep, it has a platinum trophy!"
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,zezbrah,2,Sat Jun 27 09:14:55 2015 UTC,"yeah i remember Heretic and whew, that sounds cool af, im definitely buying this now, thanks man"
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,baskei95,2,Sat Jun 27 06:54:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendation, it really worths $6"
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Sr_Volcano,8,Sat Jun 27 16:57:01 2015 UTC,kind of a let down compared to what EU just got. I was really hoping more would be added for the vita.
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,DaxterAttano,7,Fri Jun 26 19:10:42 2015 UTC,These prices are much better- plus na got the big E3 sale last week when EU had none
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Sicmay,6,Fri Jun 26 19:48:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah. NA gets the better prices, but EU gets the better game selection. I got SAO at a nice price, so I won't complain too much."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,DaxterAttano,5,Fri Jun 26 19:59:23 2015 UTC,The E3 sale kind of sucked though.
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,triedtostayaway,3,Sat Jun 27 03:19:20 2015 UTC,So do the EU ones if you actually look at most the prices and what's been offered before (most these games have been on sale multiple times)
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Sicmay,2,Sat Jun 27 08:06:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's because E3 is a NA event and is a event made for the NA press. Kinda like how Gamescom is for EU and Tokyo Game Show is for Japan, it's a region exclusive thing and international companies like Sony for example has Sony of America in charge of the whole E3 process while Sony of Europe does Gamescom (well this year Sony is doing Paris Game week instead of Gamescom which is only a a week after Gamescom)"
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:19:19 2015 UTC,It's not really though is it? The whole worlds eyes are on E3.
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,PerryDigital,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:43:56 2015 UTC,"It has a international broadcast but E3 is mainly a event held for NA press. Special promotions for the event like Playstation does getting some theaters across the US and Canada to play their conference goes to show a example on how they promote. E3 is known for being big because it was the first big conference or something so they decided to have Gamescom and Tokyo Game Show for other regions. E3 has always been about press so they can get shareholders to invest in new games, that's the priority not really about the fans but they find some way to have us excited. That's why they are called ""press conferences"" or ""media briefing"""
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:04:07 2015 UTC,It may be what it began as. It may be what it officially is. But E3 is known the world over by gamers who eagerly anticipate the showings. It's much more than just a show for one regions press. Whether it wants to be or not.
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,PerryDigital,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:43:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it shouldn't be but the priority of the event is for the press, it's a big deal of course, just like the other events, but when there are 3 events that take place in each of the 3 big regions, you know these events are simply business. But yeah, you're right, I'm was just referring to the comment of why there isn't a E3 sale in Europe. Sony America runs E3 for Playstation, I'm sure when Paris Games Week rolls around, there will only be a sale for EU."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,JT-Lionheart,3,Sun Jun 28 01:04:50 2015 UTC,Never Alone is a great buy for $6
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,17th_knight,3,Sat Jun 27 00:23:24 2015 UTC,Does anybody recommend Bound by Flame?
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Mr_Pigeon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:58:27 2015 UTC,"I own a hard copy. I haven't played that much, but from what I've played, it's fairly fun, but a bit clunky with the combat. For as cheap as it is, I'd still pick it up though."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,gregdoom,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:38:40 2015 UTC,"Got it off Gumtree (Craigslist clone) a year ago for like $15, to me the game was a pretty decent play, I completed it 3 times to platinum it. It's fairly short and a very small world; Tbh, I think it'll be free on PS+ this year.  Edit: If you're keen on a good RPG and you have a PS3, try Tales of Graces f/Tales of Xillia, however if you're gonna pick one, I'd recommend Graces f as the combat is more enjoyable. They're JRPG's though, be ready for quirky characters and odd dialogue."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,MoeyAssi,5,Sat Jun 27 19:36:24 2015 UTC,Awesome. Gonna snag the Telltale Game of Thrones even though I'm going to wait until I finish watching all the episodes of the show before I play the game.
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Woramot,3,Fri Jun 26 23:10:06 2015 UTC,In case you get impatient I'd say do not start it until you're done with season four. Also by holding off a little bit you won't need to wait as long for the next episode. This is the first Telltale game I've played as it's being released and half the time I've forgotten what's happened by the time the next episode comes out.
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Sirusavath,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:11:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah that happens when they take too long (it's been worse with borderlands)  As much as I was emotionally involved with walking dead 1-2 story, I'll recommend you go with Wolf Among Us now if you enjoyed GoT, it's an awesome twist on the fairytales, based on a comic book so it has nice lore to have a solid foundation and i really enjoyed it!  Flash edit: re read of your post revealed it may not be the first telltale game you play, but the first playing as they release so... My bad... Possibly"
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,pappapidanha,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"I have yet to play Wolf Among Us, although I did pick it up during a recent sale. I'll probably give it a whirl after Batman."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Sirusavath,5,Sat Jun 27 19:59:30 2015 UTC,Is it just me or are a lot of the games on sale previous PS+ games?
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Imjustmean,7,Fri Jun 26 20:56:09 2015 UTC,"PS sales are always like that. Free games later go on sale, sale games later go for free"
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,nd20,4,Fri Jun 26 23:21:14 2015 UTC,Only 6 games on the whole list were free before.
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,JT-Lionheart,2,Sat Jun 27 01:15:53 2015 UTC,I hope that got season pass is less than 10 bucks or so
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,poeticpoet,3,Fri Jun 26 19:13:08 2015 UTC,Kind of doubtful. I'm thinking it will go down to $15.
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,FrobroX,13,Fri Jun 26 19:33:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm gonna guess $12.50, midway between your guesses.  Edit: Well,  I'll be damned!"
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,25sittinon25cents,3,Fri Jun 26 19:39:10 2015 UTC,"We doing the price is right rules here?  I'm thinking it will go 50% off, taking it to $15. Maybe 66%."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,FrobroX,3,Fri Jun 26 20:03:56 2015 UTC,"You called it. Also, guess I didn't know how much it cost. It's $30 on Steam."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,FrobroX,2,Sat Jun 27 00:53:03 2015 UTC,It was $15 during the steam summer sale just a week ago.  So this PS sale price ($12.50) is actually better than I would expect
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,nd20,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:57:43 2015 UTC,it's 12.50 YESSSSSSSS!!  I'm getting it!

PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,ThomasVivaldi,3,Fri Jun 26 19:54:54 2015 UTC,"It's indirectly compatible, via PS3 transfer."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Matt4045,0,Fri Jun 26 21:18:18 2015 UTC,"Not vita compatible, people say is okay- awesome"
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Thiagots85,3,Fri Jun 26 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"I've seen people mention you can transfer it to a vita using a ps3, so if you have both it's an option."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Inferis84,0,Fri Jun 26 20:56:17 2015 UTC,"does not work with all games, some worked before (like Crash bandicoot), but not all time, others don't. Vita just don't show them =/"
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Thiagots85,2,Sat Jun 27 01:44:39 2015 UTC,I'm definitely getting the game of thrones season pass but am also considering mind zero and tales of hearts r.  Anyone feel like sharing their thoughts on either game?
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,YeahIGotAFace,3,Fri Jun 26 20:24:06 2015 UTC,"I loved Tales of Hearts R. If you've ever played a Tales game, it's very similar as far as gameplay. I picked it up for $30 over the holidays and I feel like it was worth it. There's tons of content and some replayability with new game+, especially if you're a trophy hunter. I would like to know more about Mind Zero as well as I've considered getting that a few times. Does it work on PSTV?"
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Seraphinejg,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:36:00 2015 UTC,Yeah tales was the one I was most wanting to try since the premise of mind zero is kinda meh....interesting enough for $10 tho lol.
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,YeahIGotAFace,2,Fri Jun 26 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"Im going through the last parts of tales right now, and Im getting the urge to get the platinum on it (it migh took me more 40 hrs, maybe and a new game+... already clocked almost 40hours), because I just can't not have this guys in my life anymore. I love them."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Thiagots85,2,Sat Jun 27 01:48:07 2015 UTC,"Bought it yesterday, can barely put it down to let my vita charge. Reminds me of Star Ocean quite a lot, so that's great."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,YeahIGotAFace,2,Sun Jun 28 05:28:08 2015 UTC,"It's just too awesome. I haven't finished it because I have to put more things on my site reviewed and I had to finish the evil within to free space on my ps4.... but anytime I go to the bathrrom, its a little progression towards the end."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Thiagots85,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:42:41 2015 UTC,Mind Zero is a bad Persona clone.

PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,OmgMrNoob,2,Fri Jun 26 20:06:39 2015 UTC,"It is a very good game. Probably the best JRPG out for PS4 right now, although I can't name any others that aren't a remake that are currently out."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,Bruce_Wang,3,Fri Jun 26 21:19:20 2015 UTC,"Can you sell me on it? It looks like a very fan-service centric game and shit like that makes me cringe. The battle system looks old school though, and that interests me."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,fubar-eyes,2,Fri Jun 26 21:52:09 2015 UTC,"It does have fan service, if the idols take enough damage their clothes get damaged and eventually are down to their bra and panties.  Not to mention there is an affection system that you raise via in game events.  But the combat is very very fluid. Turn based at its finest which we don't see much of.  You can link attacks together to increase damage, or use a ""follow"" which also increases damage.  You can combined the attacks of the idols via chain skills.   The story is very interesting but it takes a bit of time to get into. Not to mention one of the idols wears a ""cat hat"" which is almost as good as cat ears in my book.  If there is a demo which I do not know if there is, try it, if not, I'd say just get it.  If you ever played the Hyperdimension Neptunia games it is made by the same people."
PlayStationPlus,3b80pn,baskei95,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:19:50 2015 UTC,"It does have fan service, if the idols take enough damage their clothes get damaged and eventually are down to their bra and panties.

Useful to tag   If the subject is relevant to a single region, it should be tagged with that region's abbreviation.  Simple, isn't it?   but flash sale = it's NA.   Yes I know.  Why do you keep saying it?  What on earth has it got to do with anything I said?  There are over 30,000 subscribers to this newsgroup.  They do not all share the same knowledge.

I could understand it with my second post because sarcasm kicked in.  But my first?  There's no reason other than immaturity.  I'm fine with that because it means I focus more on other forums and subreddits instead of wasting my time here.  It's sad though because 2-3 years ago, /r/playstationplus was nothing like this.  People weren't wary of expressing opinions that went against the flow, or offering pointers regarding etiquette, because at the worst it would result in disagreement.  Downvotes were generally reserved for repeatedly disruptive posters.  Ironically, the most disruptive ones now are the circlejerk brigade who insist upon downvoting and hiding opinions they don't like.  Although in this case, we have the predictably pedantic /u/Romiress playing the contrarian again, something which has essentially become a sport here."

It directs everyone to the buy Plus membership page, why, I'm not sure. Also the Driveclub Plus edition you have to find. The only way I found it was going to New>New games this week, and I saw the Driveclub PS Plus edition there but looking anywhere else in the store will show you the game and PS plus price."

PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,Adambomb2000,109,Thu Jun 25 22:43:24 2015 UTC,"The reason this sub has changed so much is because PS+ is now a mandatory thing. Before the PS4 the only people here were people who wanted to subscribe to the service and participate. But now everyone who owns a PS4 is a plusser. And some of those people will be upset with the value of something thrust upon them. I feel like they have a right to complain, they can't really just drop it as they'd lose online play.  I wish there was a way of figuring out which of the complainers weren't ps3 era subscribers, for curiousity sakes"
PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,Tercotta,15,Thu Jun 25 23:48:59 2015 UTC,Coming from paying for XBox Live for a long time I find PS+ to be a good value. I had thought about getting before I got my PS4 but never got around to it. Now I get free games on my PS4 and Void every month and can do matchmaking. It doesn't even cost that much.
PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,ekyle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:02:46 2015 UTC,"I can only echo this. Xbox Live is £14.99 a quarter, PS Plus is £11.99 a quarter, and has more free games a month (indie or AAA, don't give a shit, they're free) across a number of platforms and with the games available to every user of my PS4 rather than just me. Coming from Xbox 360 to PS4, Plus is a steal comparatively."
PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,HistoryLessonforBitc,13,Fri Jun 26 21:52:11 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it changed when the offerings became crap. This is not what I paid for during the PS3 era. This is far worse. I used to look forward to the new games, now I'm just hoping there's a decent indie title. Haven't played any of them in ages either. I know plenty of people who subscripted purely to play Destiny. They don't complain about the PS+ games because they think they're shit and don't care at all."
PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,El_Giganto,2,Fri Jun 26 08:44:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's because I had PS3 era PS+ that I'm frustrated by the PS4 offerings.  I guess anybody can go look at the lineup, but to have experienced it and gotten loads of value out of it at the time makes the current state of affairs seem even more dismal."
PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,Aram_Fingal,2,Fri Jun 26 18:31:54 2015 UTC,"This is the gist of it for me.  I love indies.  But when you saturate the IGC with them, fatigue sets in.  1 AAA 1 indie for ps4 per month doesn't seem like it's too much to ask.  We did let them charge for online after all.  And PS4 is nearing two years old."
PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,IceBreak,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:47:00 2015 UTC,"Idk I had a PSN+ era PS3 and I am still playing through all the content they gave us. I knew the PS4 would not get the same treatment for years, maybe I am just objective.  PSN+ free games on PS3 made sense because we were inundated with content and the market forced prices down fairly quickly. Now we're back to a very small library of games on current gen, they have to be careful because the first  AAA game is going to set the bar.  If Sony would offer PSN+ games we own as PSN Now options for free, the PS4 would instantly have a massive library of content.   That or we wait till games like Second Son or Killzone are old enough to give away."
PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,arcteus,14,Mon Jun 29 23:38:05 2015 UTC,"That's where we disagree, I think most indies given out for PS+ are of equal or better quality to the AAA ones.  But to each his own."
PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,Shawn_of_the_Dead,5,Fri Jun 26 01:57:27 2015 UTC,"Most games in general are shit. There's been a boom in indie titles for what I'm sure is a variety of reasons, and with that come some great titles and lots of mediocre ones, but there's no reason to single out whether a game is indie or AAA to explain its poor quality. Both have the potential to be great or shit."
PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,triedtostayaway,11,Fri Jun 26 02:18:02 2015 UTC,"Well we've gotten one, maybe two AAA games for the ps4 if you count Ground Zeroes. The rest have been mostly low-scoring indies but there were some really great ones for the first several months after launch. I think it's a bit goofy to say the indies we've got have been on par with the AAA titles when the ratio of indies to AAA is so overwhelmingly skewed. It'd be one thing if they gave out bad AAA titles, but as is we're just getting indies. Some people are okay paying fifty bucks a year for games that go into $1 tiers of bundles on pc and that's fine, but I really don't see getting defensive about criticism of a service that declined in quality between generations.   To be completely honest, I don't care too much. Occasionally they give away something good on the vita or ps4, but the ps3 games have still been pretty consistent with their quality and that's what I'm mostly playing since I came to that generation late. Nobody should have expected AAA titles in the first year or so, but if they don't start trickling out a little more now I think it'll be a hard sell to argue the disappointment some feel is unfounded."

There seems to be 20 there and there has been around 120ish (I'm just going by number of months x6) games given out since the PS4 released. That would make it about 16.67% of PS+ games. I get what you are saying with this, but 20 indie games that are 74 and above in over a year and a half isn't that great. I enjoy some indies here and there, but I would have to agree that a majority of the games given are not that great."
PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,sir_chadwell_heath,4,Mon Jun 29 12:34:30 2015 UTC,"I'm only looking at PS4 titels. There are 41 games in the PS4 Instant Game Collection (including non-indie titels). So at least half of the PS4 indietitels are rated an 8+ on Metacritic, which is pretty fucking great in my opinion.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Instant_Game_Collection_games_(PAL_region)#PlayStation_4  I don't do cross-platform because in the PS3 era there were a lot of AAA titels. So the 'we only get crappy indie titles' thing doesn't apply to those platforms. AND you're not forced to subscribe for PS3, you ARE for the PS4 and that seems to be a big part of the problem for most people here."

There are only a few games I actually played from PS+ on PS4. Looking back at the PS3 offerings, I can totally see why people have been complaining.   Where I play most of my free titles is on the Vita. A lot of the indies that have been free work very well on a handheld platform."

PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,John_YJKR,2,Fri Jun 26 15:48:47 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I don't understand why sooooo many people bitch and complain about not getting year+ old ""AAA"" games.    Odds are most have already played that big budget game, or never cared to.  If you might be one of the rare ""holding out for this specific game to go free"" type then spend the <$20 and just go play the damned thing. There are very, very, very few disc-based games that aren't worth at least $20. Even if you only get 4 hours in and don't like it. We've all done worse things with $5/hr on entertainment, like a ""meh"" movie.  And even then, Twitch, Reddit, and reviews can help make a more educated gaming purchase.  Maybe there's a small market for people who never would have tried or played that AAA title if it hadn't gone free, but those people are 99% of the time the same people who wouldn't have tried or played that indie.  There's a TON of people (myself included) who are much more afraid to plunk a $10-$15 permanent purchase on an indie game.  You can't recoup any money if it sucks.  There isn't as much marketing, exposure, reviews, or feedback on a lot of these games.  So if Sony or Microsoft want to give me (often console exclusive) access to Indies that I wouldn't have normally spent money on... I'll look at that as a plus. If 2 ""free"" games are good that whole year the service almost pays for itself. You gotta spend the money to play online anyway.  More people should appreciate the chance at trying new and different stuff, you never know what could catch your interest, especially if you don't take the chance :)"
PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,perfectbebop,5,Sat Jun 27 00:56:18 2015 UTC,"Same here. The value of a game to me is not the budget to create it or the sticker price, it's how enjoyable the game it. Obviously you can't please everyone but I'm quite happy with the PS+ offerings."

You are being conditioned to accept shit games as acceptable so they can spend less and get you to pay what you would for AAA games. Besides, the indie game movement is so hipster its sickening. Most people I talk to on here are all about indie games. Personally I think the industry is obsessed with these indie titles right now and the games will never disappear. But I do believe their popularity is a phase that will pass. Hopefully sooner rather than later. Cause I think they are holding the industry back."

PlayStationPlus,3b4lzb,John_YJKR,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:21:56 2015 UTC,"It's only going to get worse as games get more expensive to make. The same thing happens in cinema. New and original movies are getting harder and harder to make because studios don't want to take a gamble. They want predictable and reproducible profits, not risky new ventures. So the same thing is happening in video gaming as they become more and more expensive to produce. Instead of taking a risk on new franchises, you end up with the seventeenth Call of Duty and nearly half a dozen Transformers films. As long as people keep giving them millions of dollars, they'll keep making the same things. That's why it's important that people support fresh, new ideas and stop pre-ordering and waiting in lines on opening night for stale old ones."

I subbed for a year before the PS4, since they were killing it with the games lineup. Even if I already had a game, it was exciting to see new ones. Not to mention that signing up got you an instant collection of yearly titles, as well as the monthly ones.   So fast forward now, and we've had a year or so of lackluster titles. That's my opinion, and if I'm paying for a service that is no longer useful, I'd just cancel and save some coin, but now I feel I'm forced into it for playing online, which is a big reason I use my system.   As for your main point, that is a reddit issue. The up/downvote system is objectively garbage (at least for comments) since there is no limit and no rule restrictions. They're used for any reason whatsoever, and this will happen unless there is a reddit change, but this sub in particular may have more vocal opinions by being forced to pay for online."

Hell, just play through a few of them before complaining. There's been quite a few that I would have probably never played if it weren't for PS+, and they ended up being awesome games.

I only care that we get good/high quality games, not just games that everybody looks over and doesn't want.

We had Metro Last Light, Bioshock Infinite, Borderlands 2 and Guacamelee in a single month! I'm not saying it has to always be this big, but now it's just a bunch of mediocre games with a good one once in a while. PS3 has so many games on it's catalogue, I would prefer some old games that were good than some of the stuff they're giving us lately.

PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,EggsNbeans,23,Thu Jun 25 16:39:51 2015 UTC,I find PSN speeds atrocious for the most part.
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,PerryDigital,16,Thu Jun 25 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"It's regional. Generally it's fine in some areas, although with the driveclub downloads going PSN is not taking it all that well.  Sony appears to not be great with CDNs.  Your thing about DNS setting is a complete placebo. You're crossing yourself up. Resolving names does not change download speeds, only how long it takes to start.  It'll be better tomorrow, but it'll never be fast as long as you are using PS4's shitty wireless and depending on where in the world you are it may never be fast."
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,happyscrappy,2,Thu Jun 25 16:35:06 2015 UTC,You called out the correct problem (CDNs) but you're wrong about DNS being a placebo. DNS has an impact on which CDN you connect to. So changing your DNS can have a huge impact on speeds.
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,mossmaal,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:07:59 2015 UTC,Only if you make a new connection. He didn't mention he restarted the download after changing the DNS setting.
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,happyscrappy,2,Sun Jun 28 07:11:20 2015 UTC,"For example, I just started my Driveclub download and it's listed as 50 minutes left for the update file which is 10.6GB, the ""main part"" which is only 2.74GB is listed as 5 minutes. Yes, it's downloading both at once. Once the ""main part"" is done, the other will drop even lower."
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,happyscrappy,-9,Thu Jun 25 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"DNS isn't a placebo.  Changing the DNS now affects download times by as much as 30-40%+ for Driveclub now, and by a factor of 2/3x typically for many other downloads."
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,happyscrappy,14,Thu Jun 25 16:39:02 2015 UTC,You didn't mention you restarted the download after changing DNS settings. If you do so the host that the machine connects to can change because the name resolves to a different addresses. CDNs will even try to guess the best IP address to resolve a host name to based upon guessing your region from what DNS server you are going through.  So changing a DNS setting after the download starts is a complete placebo. Changing it and then restarting the download (especially if you reboot the PS4 so it flushes its DNS caching) can make a difference.
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,lolmemelol,5,Thu Jun 25 17:30:18 2015 UTC,Do you actually know what DNS is/does?
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,One_Half_Hamster,-2,Thu Jun 25 20:31:19 2015 UTC,"As I have said several times around this thread - I know it should have no effect, but oddly it does have a large effect. Google around, I am far from the only person to find the same thing.  Reddit is far too focused on people throwing theory they learnt in Comp Sci 101 to recognise that for some reason changing DNS settings for a tonne of people does seem to make a large difference. There is ironically some sort of unresolved issue lying there, and people denying it because they think they know everything about it doesn't help anyone."
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,One_Half_Hamster,5,Thu Jun 25 20:48:35 2015 UTC,You probably just connected to a different host when you switched your DNS.

PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,mossmaal,2,Thu Jun 25 22:51:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, switching your DNS and restarting a download is probably what connected you to a different host.  It probably erased your cache and connected you to another host."
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,cosmiccrunch,0,Thu Jun 25 22:54:20 2015 UTC,I can believe that. Why doing so consistently speeds up download speeds by a huge amount is still beyond me.
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,caseythebuffalo,19,Thu Jun 25 22:55:20 2015 UTC,Because people watch CSI and think that gives them N+ certification.
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,kihragod,2,Thu Jun 25 17:16:40 2015 UTC,"DNS decides which CDN you connect to. Changing DNS can connect you to a different server. The way a CDN works, it has multiple servers that all appear to have the same content. Your DNS system looks up the address and usually ends up going to the closest CDN. But sometimes it doesn't, or sometimes you don't want the closest one.  Changing the DNS is just a kinda hackey way to change download servers like Steam allows."
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,catman555555,-1,Thu Jun 25 19:01:48 2015 UTC,"Nope, I know for a fact that switching the DNS to Googles on my sony consoles significantly increases my download speeds.

PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,kingofnexus,-9,Thu Jun 25 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"Not a networking engineer so from a technical standpoint I have zero idea, and from a basic understanding of DNS I would also have guessed that it wouldn't make a difference.  It does, though. I've had other downloads crawl along, I've changed my DNS settings and suddenly the download will speed up by factors of up to 2/3 times, on one occasion even more. Changing the DNS settings on my Vita without turning it off changed the MGS HD Collection download from an 8hr download to a 90min download, which is probably the biggest example I can think of in recent memory. Again, I don't understand why this should change anything, it certainly seems that it shouldn't do, but it just kinda does. Google it, you'll see a tonne of people saying the same thing.  E: I understand that it shouldn't do anything, but purely from a perspective of results, it definitely does something, whether people want to dislike me saying that is totally irrelevant to me since I already know its true."
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,zero86sk,7,Thu Jun 25 17:27:04 2015 UTC,"If that were the case then it's your ISP (assuming you're using their dns servers) slowing down the traffic, as dns is only domain name lookup, as is it goes to find the IP address from a domain name then the console connects to that IP   Edit: if dns is the issue which would be odd, you can use tools like this grc dns benchmark tool to look for the best dns server for your area (https://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm)"

PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,larsvondank,2,Fri Jun 26 10:11:18 2015 UTC,"I think the maximum speed of the wireless chipset within the console is 50mbps and it is also dependant on if the Remote Play feature is active and emits its own WiFi signal.  The router in use could also have some effects on the connection as some routers are advertised as dual band (2.4ghz and 5ghz) but will not emit both at the same time. Most of the time they only do 2.4ghz (slower).  Lastly it also depends on your actual connection to the server, speed and ping tests by Ookla are usually to servers with the best ping and don't provide a good number to Sony's server. You could recieve 50mbps when pinging your ISP's server but only 20mbps when pinging Sony's server.  If you're bothered by these speeds, you would've hated the Day 1 WiiU patch on Day 1."
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,chimianopao,2,Thu Jun 25 20:51:00 2015 UTC,5ghz isn't faster than 2.4ghz.
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,tgrfan01,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:57:18 2015 UTC,The 5ghz band is usually for higher speeds (IEEE 802.11 N) whilst 2.4ghz is usually for IEEE 802.11 B/G. Some routers can do N over 2.4ghz and vice versa.  And in general 5ghz is faster than 2.4ghz as hz (hertz) is a measure of frequency and can also be put forward as cycles per second which is 1/T. 50hz is 50 times per second.  Source: I'm an Engineer and your name doesn't help your case.
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,cridikal,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:46:38 2015 UTC,"As you said you can do N speeds in both 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands. So what makes 5ghz faster? If I only have N capable devices on a 2.4ghz network vs a 5ghz network there will be no difference in throughput.  Additionally walls and obstructions affect 5ghz way more than 2.4ghz networks, so if you are not in the same room as the router you will likely get better signal with the 2.4ghz network.   Source: We're all Engineers and I have a fancy router. Way to judge a book by it's cover with my username, too ☺"
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,catman555555,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:10:52 2015 UTC,It's so that devices that are only capable with IEEE 802.11 N can still work with routers that emit a 2.4ghz signal. It's to maximize compatability and prevent problems. I can't remember the exact figures of what frequencies top speeds are but to get higher speeds some USBs and PCIE cards utilise both frequncies at the same time.

PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,EggsNbeans,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:31:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think its so much a problem with PSN as it is Sony using really shitty hardware in their systems. Unless you have a crazy powerful router (and sometimes not even then), or have the system next to the router, wireless speeds are shit. The moment you plug in an ethernet cable, your 4 hour download is suddenly going to take 20 minutes. I've actually brought my PS3 in to my living room, got a wired connection, and downloaded dozens of games in less than a couple hours. Had I done that through wireless, I'd probably still have unfinished downloads months later.   It really is the only thing I can think of. I have all my consoles in my room, a good 20+ feet from my router, and I can't even connect to it with my PS3, Vita TV, or Vita 80% of the time. When it does connect I have terrible download speeds, streaming video would look like ass, etc. I have to set up my computer as a wireless network and use that if I want to do online things with my Playstation systems.

No amount of fucking with the connection settings or the physical setup has fixed it.  Got a PS4 for Xmas, plugged it into the router and started downloading PS+ games, same deal.

PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,SheriffofBanshee,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:06:36 2015 UTC,"Try this trick that works for me! After I queue up all my downloads, and they START, key word here is start. They can't be loading up the download, it has to actually be downloading the file, go and restart your PS4. Not the rest mode, actually restart the console.   It has sometimes tripled or quadrupled my download speeds. I have no idea why restarting after they start downloading does this, but it works. At least for me."
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,lDamianos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:07:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion! I've tried it, and it shaved ~15hrs off my download time for Driveclub (now only 74 hours haha). I'll give it a go whenever I run into this problem in the future too."
PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,SheriffofBanshee,3,Thu Jun 25 16:37:30 2015 UTC,"If you look at the actual download rate by calculating the speed at which the numbers progress on the screen over time, you might have found it had already sped up before you rebooted.  PS4 uses a very ""smooth"" (i.e. slow to respond) averaging algorithm for predictions of completion. For example, when I started my download I said the patch one would speed up after the main one finished. And indeed it did, as you see from my post times, the rest completed in about 15 minutes even though Sony was still predicting 31.  This combined with the downloads starting VERY slowly means that the prediction for completion may be well out of whack with what actually would happen. And restarting the download (or the PS4) will force it to calculate again not counting that slow start to the download.  So you may have only changed a number on the screen with the restart, not the actual completion time.  But then again, it only takes a minute to reboot so it can't really hurt to do so."

PlayStationPlus,3b2uzi,SlimJim84,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:40:26 2015 UTC,"OK, let me elaborate a few things here;   Upgrade your internet!   Not a valid answer, as the latent link can be anywhere between you, and the destination of the PSN servers you are downloading from. It can also be due to a current outage occuring on a tier-1 provider (see here).  It's probably regional.   This is a valid answer. I am willing to bet Sony has not deployed CDN systems to the major carriers like Netflix and other services do, which would help the issue tremendously. Another thing to note here is that when you download from PSN, you are downloading the base game, and not an already patched release. This further puts strain on PSN, as you end up downloading a game, patch data, game data, etc...etc... and this is something that Sony really should work to remediate."

PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,slickestwood,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:18:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah sure, AC as a franchise has become repetitive, but end of the day it's still different in gameplay to another AAA third person title like say the Arkham franchise or Just Cause. They're still bigger games with a lot more to do, and appeal to a much bigger range of people. Ask 100 people if they'd rather AC: Unity or a 2D sidescroller and the majority will pick the AAA game.   There's not a single PS+ indie game that I keep. It's like they're on PS+ because they're not gonna sell well."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,TheJoshider10,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"I couldn't tell you why they have offered so many indie games as opposed to AAA titles, I just don't agree that the indie games we get are samey, and AC is a terrible series to contrast that with. Any Ubisoft game will have the same/similar objectives as any other. That's more similar than indies ever get. Sure some borrow mechanics used in other indies, but AAA games are far more guilty at this. For example, AC 1 had eagle vision and the ability to climb buildings. Then all of a sudden, nearly every open-world game has some variant of eagle vision and wall-climbing. AAA games are getting more homogenized every year while indies have been creating actual innovative experiences. The fact that you think they've all been so similar makes me think you haven't been playing them."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,slickestwood,0,Fri Jun 26 17:53:10 2015 UTC,"and AC is a terrible series to contrast that with.   You're the one who compared them in the first place.   I just have no interest in these types of games. I want some good, critically acclaimed games like Journey or Flower, not just 2D game after 2D game every month that have key similarities and minor differences. Even the 2.5D games like that eskimo one still feels similar. I don't have to play all of them anyway, just by looking at a video of them I can just tell they won't amuse me. There's a reason why people are complaining about the quality of PS+ games for PS4 so far. Then there's games like Race the Sun that offered me maybe 10 minutes of gameplay before I deleted it. Just give me a Killzone: Shadow Fall or a Infamous every day of the week. I'm fine with getting indie titles ALONG WITH the AAA games but right now it's just indie game after indie game, nothing for both types of people."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,MightyGreenPanda,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:00:50 2015 UTC,"AC:Black Flag is in the title and was generally the game people were talking about. It wasn't much of a leap. If your issue is they are not critically acclaimed, see the comment showing that half of them have scored 80+ on Metacritic. If the problem is the games don't seem appealing to you, understand that that is a ""you"" problem and any game, even AAA titles, will have millions of people they don't appeal to. I also never recommend watching gameplay and determining how fun it would be to play it. What I don't think people understand is that Sony doesn't just pick games to put on PS+ all willy nilly. The developers need to agree and forgo a large number of potential sales when putting their games up for free. On PS3, we would often see AAA games appear when a sequel is coming up or when sales grow stagnant and I think we are just too early in the PS4's lifecycle for either of those to happen. Even launch titles probably still see sales to new PS4 owners since they are cheaper than most games on the shelf. Of course, I am only speculating but so is everyone making up bullshit reasons why we have seen so few AAA titles. And finally, I think we need to keep in mind that we on reddit don't represent even a significant fraction of all gamers and that just because an opinion seems popular, it might not be. If it were, pre-orders wouldn't be increasing every year. Just because players on here get upset at the selection every month doesn't mean everyone is. Most PS4 owners I know aren't even aware of the IGC."

PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,MightyGreenPanda,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:15:09 2015 UTC,"I've played every main AC game besides Rogue and have enjoyed them all, but Black Flag was just AC III with better and more emphasized ship combat. The action on land is identical to every other game. If you aren't infiltrating an area to assassinate a target, you are likely following the target to a new location so you can assassinate him there. I understand that it is such a common criticism that it has devolved into a circlejerk, but if all indies are identical than AC is pure copy pasta."

I'd say 80% of those are ""Indies"". I use quotation because Indie isn't a bad word in the PC community. Fuck, it's not even used to describe games that this sub would rip apart as being ""Indie"". In the PC world a game is either good or shit. Coming to a console sub and listening to all you entitled fucks bitch about games based on their visual appeal is hilarious. I've put more time in to Prison Architect this month than I have any other game because I've had a blast with it. It's FUN. Remember when that was the most important thing to gamers?? It's not a multimillion dollar studio game and no one in the PC world could give less of a fuck. Here's hoping for more Indies next month so I can once again get my chuckles watching you children have yet another breakdown on this sub. Have a good one!"
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,arthurzp,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:45:44 2015 UTC,"Console, maybe. PC not so much.   Well yeah, this is a subreddit for a console subscription. It's the same shit every month, someone can comment how they don't like the indie games because it doesn't appeal to them (obviously if people don't care about the games they get they're gonna be annoyed. It's the same with politics, you vote for who benefits you most and here we want to pay for what benefits us) and then people get on their high horse acting like they're superior and everyone else is entitled. Nobody cares that much, we just want bigger games and there's nothing wrong with that, especially since some of the games we've been getting offer no more than 10 minutes of fun or weren't critically the best received. I've been paying for PS+ for over 3 years now. I bought it initially because of the benefits it came with game wise. Then along came PS4 and understandably we got indie games. This was fine, it was the first say 10 months of release! We should expect that no AAA game comes here yet since obviously there's money to make. Yet here we are, over a year and a half later and we still lack the AAA games that many people paid for PS+ for. I'm someone who doesn't have the most amount of money to spend on a game, so PS+ is my main source of games for both consoles, so it'd be nice if you appreciated that some people would like bigger games that they simply can't afford, especially when the service did so many years prior to the PS4 coming out.   Continue spreading the PC all knowing message though!"
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Doomsdays97,2,Mon Jun 29 09:51:23 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Infamous First Light was very generic and boring, MGS was 2 hours long. I would rather play some good indie games like The Binding of Isaac or Transistor."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,01luca01,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:18:40 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more, would rather have a 10/10 indie game instead of the worst battlefield or a game from a series that has been milked so much it's tits fell off."

PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,AiwassAeon,2,Thu Jun 25 17:05:17 2015 UTC,Since sony said nothing about anything for PS+during E3 I wouldnt expect anything big till at least the fall.
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,MarkusGisdol,2,Fri Jun 26 00:22:08 2015 UTC,Black flag was free on the 360 months ago

PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,pappapidanha,2,Sat Jun 27 20:29:55 2015 UTC,"I guess we will get 1 bigger title like  Tomb Raider, Knack, Killzone, Murdered, Thief, Sherlock Holmes, Trials Fusion, Child of Light, Sleeping Dogs  as AAA titles."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,letsgometros,2,Fri Jun 26 07:00:12 2015 UTC,Lol i see what you did there!  I wouldn't mind definitive tomb raider tho
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,pappapidanha,2,Fri Jun 26 13:03:58 2015 UTC,"Noooo I just bought it!  They already gave us TR for PS3, doubt they'll now give us PS4 version"
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,letsgometros,2,Fri Jun 26 15:33:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly, people would be outraged by that... But I can see myself enjoying it again on ps4"
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,SirBlobbington,2,Fri Jun 26 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"It's wonderful! That, tlou, drive club ps+, I am absolutely loving ps4"
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,endnuen,2,Fri Jun 26 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"I think we would've been getting a bigger title anyways, given the 29th is the 5th anniversary of PSN. And it's already confirmed that Japan is getting Guilty Gear and the Vita Batman game in addition to their usual lineup."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Matt4045,2,Fri Jun 26 20:17:00 2015 UTC,I hope they give us Dark Souls 2 : SotFS. Would be swell.
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,TheGamerTribune,4,Tue Jun 30 06:29:11 2015 UTC,Didn't they just give out Black Flag on 360 a couple months ago?
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,saywhattyall,6,Thu Jun 25 16:20:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes this a lot less interesting."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,abyssea,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:58:35 2015 UTC,And if it backwards compatible they could play it already (assuming they downloaded the 360 version before BC was revealed)

PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,farhadk,0,Thu Jun 25 18:32:42 2015 UTC,And a pool game for like 3 months too
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,SenorV,2,Thu Jun 25 22:57:22 2015 UTC,Games on ps plus are decided months in advance so chances are we're getting some mediocre games
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Freyaka,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:07:14 2015 UTC,I would assume they are for GWG as well. Definitely can't be a last minute thing.
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,lockescythe,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:29:41 2015 UTC,"You're right, there was a problem a few months ago when one of the games (Dishonored?) was supposed to be free, and then there was a delay in the announcement for a replacement."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,faux_grass,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:29:45 2015 UTC,I don't actually believe that's completely true. Remember a few months ago when the PS+ games got delayed because they were hammering out the details?
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,sonicguy14,3,Fri Jun 26 00:39:17 2015 UTC,They'll say we'll get a retail game but then spend a year and give us a demo.
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Streetfoldsfive,2,Thu Jun 25 18:17:48 2015 UTC,I see what you did there.  I was wondering about that too. Seems like a bait and switch happened somewhere.
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,trockr,2,Thu Jun 25 19:55:25 2015 UTC,People expected a AAA game when GWG gave Rayman legends. Instead we got a bunch of indies. Wouldn't expect much.
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Jaeris,2,Thu Jun 25 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe the last couple of months are exceptions, but in my opinion Plus has done better then GWG. Maybe I'm just the outlier though."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,tbx5959,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:15:38 2015 UTC,"I think so. When PS+ started getting awesome for PS3, we usually got AAA games 1 1/2 to 2 years after release, with some exceptions. While we've seen a few AAA games for PS4, it's just now about time for AAA titles to start coming out more often."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Lovegaming,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:10:04 2015 UTC,GWG is Xboxs version of the IGC. I was asking if it would push any for a bigger AAA title.
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Darkius968,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:37:33 2015 UTC,The chances are slim.
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,TheWhiteeKnight,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:40:09 2015 UTC,"Black Flag has seemed like the most likely one for a while.  With no EA  access, maybe Battlefield for ps4 will come out one of these months"
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,CurbedEnthusiasm,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:42:46 2015 UTC,I'm not sure this is going to happen very soon...
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,01luca01,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:51:41 2015 UTC,The competition from GWG will surely give Sony a nudge to up their game on releases for IGC.
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Pavelbure77,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:21:15 2015 UTC,"Sony no longer has any reason to offer good games, because not only is PS+ required now (for PS4 anyways), but because they have the lead in the market this generation. They're in the same shoes Microsoft was with the Xbox 360, they didn't need an incentive to purchase Xbox Live because if you wanted to play online, it was required anyways, and most people played on Xbox for the longest time. Now that Sony is in that position, they're gaining the same mentality. I had PS+ for about three years before I stopped renewing last year, and regardless of what you want to say, the quality has done nothing but drop for the PS+ games. They don't even give quality PS3 games anymore, and there is still a large assortment of great PS3 games that could be offered."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,JT-Lionheart,3,Thu Jun 25 21:16:45 2015 UTC,"This is the current situation, summed up nicely. Sony don't have to give away good games right now. They own us."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,wielku,2,Thu Jun 25 22:44:30 2015 UTC,They have the lead in the market NOW. This not written in stone. Microsoft is trying to reverse this situation and bw compatibility and good titles in the gwg collection are effective weapons in my opinion. And I'm saying this as a PS4 owner. History is yet to be written for this generation so both Sony and Microsoft have to fight for victory.
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,wielku,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:32:54 2015 UTC,"It will not push them in the least. Here is how almost every month goes: Pick 1 of the indie games being released that tuesday along with one or two that were released a few months prior, taa daa, sony's igc."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,meganev,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:33:22 2015 UTC,"At least some of the indie game we get are new. But yeah, I feel the list for Plus every month should be able to appeal to most and not just throwing out indies only on PS4 and putting out a triple A game for PS3. Though Ground Zeroes was a nice touch, maybe we'll began to see at least one triple A game coming soon. I love indie games but most of the time, either one or two of them don't really appeal to me. And usually we be getting 4 PS4 games each month one or two of them because it's cross buy with Vita."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,IceBreak,0,Fri Jun 26 01:07:14 2015 UTC,I guess maybe bigger indies? maybe they'll force indie devs to put like some dummy files so indie games will be bigger in size I suppose
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,meganev,-1,Fri Jun 26 00:00:03 2015 UTC,File size =/= AAA game btw.
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,diction203,0,Thu Jun 25 19:07:18 2015 UTC,iz a joke matey
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Tyler2Tall,-4,Thu Jun 25 19:41:16 2015 UTC,"Nope, Sony don't need to mimic Microsoft, even with all the Xbone's improvements the PS4 is still out selling it. I'd like to see it happen but Sony have no incentive to do so.   Edit - Sorry guys but it's true, look at all the stuff Microsoft have done: Price drops, monthly system updates, backwards compatibility and focusing on exclusives. Sony have done none of these things, and are still beating Microsoft in sales.  This is the same situation, Sony will not spend the extra money to get retail games in the IGC when there's no need for them too."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,diction203,5,Fri Jun 26 00:32:25 2015 UTC,"If Sony takes the attitude of ""we're fine, they'll buy it anyway,"" they're going to end up on the other end of their 2013 E3 sooner or later.  Not that I think that's what they're doing, but they have been pretty disappointing to me when it comes to PS+ lately.  The income that service is generating is seeing such a small amount put back into the complimentary games (imo)."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,IceBreak,6,Thu Jun 25 16:21:20 2015 UTC,"If Sony takes the attitude of ""we're fine, they'll buy it anyway,"" they're going to end up on the other end of their 2013 E3 sooner or later.   100% agree, and I think we're starting to see that happen. I think yourself /u/IceBreak predicated that Microsoft will beat Sony in the sale charts for the whole of the holiday season.   Just look at this fall, Microsoft have three major exclusives (Halo 5, Tomb Raider and Forza), Sony have none, they're starting to rest on their laurels assuming they will remain on top regardless. Another example would be when was the last major system updates? Months ago, and we still don't have highly requested features (folders and being able to change your PSN name).  Sony have got a little too comfortable at the top, and I don't think GwG giving away a retail title is the catalyst that will change that. Sony will continue to do what they're currently doing until they start to see Microsoft making serious progress in catching them."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,randdomusername,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"There's a lack of ""wow"" factor in these 3 exclusives, it's pretty much just sequels of the same shit over again. Although Tomb Raider looks pretty good."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,pyro-ro,2,Thu Jun 25 16:45:42 2015 UTC,"I think Halo and Tomb Raider will be huge for them, forza may pick up since Horizon 2 was so good.  All Sony has to compete is that uncharted collection"
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Adambomb2000,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"There's no doubt that people will buy them, but I don't think it will get non-Xbox followers to join."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,chevyzaz,0,Thu Jun 25 18:25:08 2015 UTC,"I can't see how they wouldn't.  PS4 has a lot of AAA but niche stuff coming in 2015 (four different JRPG-ish games, Uncharted Collection, Tearaway HD).  But Microsoft has commercial blockbusters, a lower price, a US 1TB model, and backwards compatibility.  I think they take October through December in the States."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Matthew0606,0,Thu Jun 25 20:26:27 2015 UTC,"I agree that sony has pretty much nothing for the holiday.  But, a new forza won't bring in new customers as they already have released 2 of them.  Halo 5 won't bring in many as the halo collection has already released and I think the hype for a halo game has died a bit.  And a new tomb raider isn't that big of a deal.  Plus PS+ has been a way better deal than gwg forever. Xboxone users have been getting 1 new game for months, we get 2+ games every month, sometimes 4+ games. We've had 2 AAA games already too"
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,madshayne,3,Thu Jun 25 16:49:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after E3 I was really wondering why I didn't get a X1.  The only exclusive I've played so far has been Bloodborne and I'm really forcing myself to play it.  And I couldn't care less about JRPGs so that doesn't help."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Matthew0606,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:03:42 2015 UTC,"True that they don't need too but BF is finally being phased out since the new one will make it 2 AC games old so Ubisoft might finally be willing to let it go for cheap, since its being slashed in price across the board"

PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Matthew0606,-1,Thu Jun 25 18:32:31 2015 UTC,"Sony should spend the extra money on IGC after the fiasco of their E3 conference with nothing that good looking coming out it.  Giving us more Indies after a terrible E3, is just adding salt to the wound."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,pappapidanha,2,Thu Jun 25 22:27:07 2015 UTC,terrible E3? that's a matter of opinion i guess... loads of stuff got me excited on the sony front!
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,khearts888,0,Thu Jun 25 22:19:10 2015 UTC,"I saw nothing that interested me at all during E3 from Sony. Maybe the FF7 remake, but other than that, the Square Enix conference had me pretty much salivating wanting more."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Gregymon,-1,Fri Jun 26 12:34:07 2015 UTC,"Guys. I just got a very scary thought (to those who will complain about indies on Ps4 and systems). Dricveclub Ps Plus Edition has been released today, and that isn't part of July's games, but since it took Sony alot of money to do so and everything, we might be promised indies for sure now next month and maybe a few other months, and maybe not only that, but maybe Sony might cut back on triple A support on Ps Plus to compensate. Not that I complain.  I know I post this somewhere else but think people, this could be bad."
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,wisaaka,2,Fri Jun 26 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"Driveclub is a first party title, Sony doesn't have to pay anyone to put it on plus, and I doubt they're making a significant enough number of sales on that game now for the loss to actually affect them"
PlayStationPlus,3b31ue,Lovegaming,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:22:15 2015 UTC,Okay. But still could have affect on next month's games.
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,rinasek,69,Thu Jun 25 07:55:06 2015 UTC,How on earth did they not just end up giving people the full version in the end. It was the only possible redeeming move for this whole affair.
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,AtomicEdge,6,Thu Jun 25 11:18:20 2015 UTC,"I reckon the game didn't sell as well as they thought it would, so they hope that people will upgrade to the full version to get an extra buck out of it. Shame!"
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,johnmichaelhowe,9,Thu Jun 25 18:12:32 2015 UTC,That's a bit of a stretch... but there should be a deep discount for the full version. The season pass has more content than the base game and it's cheaper.
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,Comaburr,2,Thu Jun 25 12:54:47 2015 UTC,There is quite a deep discount on the full game already - it's 25$ isn't it?
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,LeeorV,11,Thu Jun 25 13:45:04 2015 UTC,The game was originally supposed to come out in 2013. What game hasn't been discounted down to that price point after this long?
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,rand486,0,Thu Jun 25 15:22:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, no idea. I bought it used a year ago on Craigslist for $40; then $25 for the season pass. There's so many events in the season pass releases that I am almost seeing it as a chore to get my star count back up to the max. I'm only about 15 races away from getting the platinum trophy on there , though. So hopefully I'll have it when they're done coming out with your packs. Lol."

PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,meganev,6,Thu Jun 25 10:56:55 2015 UTC,"I pay for PS+ for the multiplayer but mostly the discounts.    I consider the games as a free bonus due to the fact that there is no way of telling what games will be on IGC.   I have had several months where I have already owned all of thr games they offer.  I am a huge supporter of digital distribution and so whenever possibe I bought everything digitally on the ps3/Vita and 100% on the PS4.    Honestly I tend to spend more time buying games than I do playing these days as there are tons I bought and haven't even launched yet lol.   Anyways my point is I buy these games normally when I see good discounts and go crazy on flash sale days/weekends.    There is absolutely no doubt I have saved well over $1000 on games due to PS+ just within the last few years.   That is what I am paying the meager $50/yr for, so the games are free imo."

PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,Divolinon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:42:21 2015 UTC,"I don't have to pay for it now, and the amount of games I get for the fee is so high, that in my mind, it's free.  Also, specifically for this game, it's is a bonus, not one of the promised 6 games of the month, so it is free."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,TheGallifreyan,8,Thu Jun 25 14:03:46 2015 UTC,"Online play was free on PS3, the only reason people didn't go mental when Sony starting charging for online is because of the IGC.   The Instant Game Collection is a huge part of the PS+ subscription price, to claim otherwise is just being disingenuous. If we're truly merely paying for online then PS+ is one of the worst deals of all time considering how poor PSN is, Sony are clearly not spending any of the PS+ subscription money on improving their online infrastructure.  These games are not in any way free, by definition, you must pay to access them. The price of PS+ is for all aspects of the service.  Here's a picture to illustrate my point"
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,meganev,-1,Thu Jun 25 11:12:44 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, when you're paying for a service that provides goods, once the initial by in cost is matched any further goods could be seen as free."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,CornflakeJustice,2,Thu Jun 25 14:29:00 2015 UTC,"Well when the ""initial buy in cost is matched"" is extremely subjective."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,meganev,-1,Thu Jun 25 14:32:29 2015 UTC,I disagree. Even assuming the lowest sale price of the games you end up getting at some point you'll hit that ~$60 mark.  Now there could be some subjectivity as to what games you'd include but that's really it and I find it hard to believe that in the course of 3-6 months you aren't hitting that mark.
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,CornflakeJustice,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:06:22 2015 UTC,"We can perceive them as free since we don't pay for them directly, but definitely, if we try to be fair, we do pay for them because if we don't pay for a subscription we won't get any of these games."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,01luca01,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:37:08 2015 UTC,"Right, but you'd also not be playing online. I know we can debate this all day everyday. And if people would stop bitching about Indie titles and remember that AAA titles will come to PS4."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,Cryptic-Panther,0,Fri Jun 26 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you, but just as I have the right to assign value to my purchase however I see fit, so do you. For some, it's part of the value equation. For others, it's a bonus."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,SemiproCharlie,2,Thu Jun 25 12:43:15 2015 UTC,"i say free because i have been a PS+ subscriber for a few years, back in the pS3 days, and since i play online PS+ is required. I only have the PS4 now so the entire value of PS+ isn't as high as others (people with PS3 & vita) but still i'll play it, I already own Project cars, and if i want the full game i can buy it at a discount. so all is good."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,Cryptic-Panther,-1,Thu Jun 25 14:22:59 2015 UTC,It was free for me lol

PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,ColinZealSE,2,Thu Jun 25 17:06:04 2015 UTC,"Probably overly asked question, is the 'Full Game Trial' time limited? I would need to buy the full game still after a certain period?"
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,blindrob23,4,Thu Jun 25 12:10:21 2015 UTC,"""Full Game Trial"" is basically a placeholder name. You can play as much as you want as long as your PS+ subscription is still active."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,MightyGreenPanda,3,Thu Jun 25 14:53:08 2015 UTC,"I see, thank you very much for the clarification."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,blindrob23,0,Thu Jun 25 16:14:01 2015 UTC,My question exactly. I was under the impression this is just a smaller version of Driveclub with less features that you can play as long as you have PS+. I'd definitely prefer that than a timed trial of the full game.
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,thatsupervillain,2,Thu Jun 25 12:22:46 2015 UTC,can someone confirm that you can earn trophies on this version?

Come back today, its on 7gb downloaded, its been over 24hrs and its going to be tomorrow before I get to play, this has got to be the slowest update file download in the friggin world, ffs."

Granted I'm a sim style racer and no tuning throws me off especially since I own project cars (not to mention having to grind car unlocks) and with nfs coming for arcade players I doubt this demo will stay on your system long. Still promise delivered I guess.

PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,FINDTHESUN,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:42:18 2015 UTC,So what is missing compared to the retail version?
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,kartana,5,Thu Jun 25 14:11:50 2015 UTC,"Basically everything. You only have a really limited set of cars and one country (which is 11 circuits, I believe). Almost every option in the menu is locked and you can't even use DLC unless you have the full version."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,MightyGreenPanda,-6,Thu Jun 25 14:54:25 2015 UTC,This is false. You're only missing most of the cars and only get 1 country india with around 13 tracks.   Every other functionality will be enabled once they give you access to online. So you can do everything this game offers and get all the trophies - just with less cars & tracks.
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,Shinoken__,6,Thu Jun 25 16:22:41 2015 UTC,"You're only missing most of the cars and only get 1 country india with around 13 tracks.   That's basically what I said. Also, although you can play every mode and get the platinum, the game is still missing a fuckton of content, mainly the ""Tour"" mode, which is basically the campaign of the game. There are a lot of tours and you can only play one of them at the PS+ Edition. I really wanted this to be good, but I simply can't defend it. It's more of a F2P version of a game or a demo rather than the full thing."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,MightyGreenPanda,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:38:48 2015 UTC,"Most of the tours are DLC though. I have the ps+ upgrade and got maybe 2/3 tours (they made some dlc free because of launch issues).   But you can race, send challenges, do face-offs, join a club, play online.. All features."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,Shinoken__,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:43:24 2015 UTC,"It's downloading like a mutha too - usually my PSN downloads are about half speed, but this is going to download the 25 or so gigs in an hour and half give or take"

It's a real question, I give it a try because it's the first time I will play a racing game on my PS4 but in the end, I don't know if I buy project cars anyway, because it's the newer game and a real simulation."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,Retro_Edge,0,Thu Jun 25 15:09:33 2015 UTC,"To me yes, since it is free game. I did not get Plus to get Driveclub so this is a bonus for me. Especially considering all those not-so-good indie games they have been giving plus subscribers last couple months."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,FINDTHESUN,0,Thu Jun 25 15:45:35 2015 UTC,"If you're after a sim, then get PCars. BUT many sim racers found Driveclub to be satisfying too. It's a simcade. Not easy, not too challenging either. SUPER and HYPER class is real fun. Just try the PS+ demo and see if you like it. Very beautiful game, plays nicely too."
PlayStationPlus,3b1u9s,Tyrath,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:45:14 2015 UTC,"You  know, normally I would skip a game like this. But after all the fuss over this, I'm gonna have to try it."

PlayStationPlus,3b035y,GoHooN,2,Thu Jun 25 19:14:05 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately no. They usually develop them entirely in Japanese and add other languages only when they release in other regions. Asia region (Hong Kong, Singapore, etc) gets games in multiple language versions (usually English, Chinese and Japanese) and gets them early compared to EU and NA but even then each language is considered a separate product, just like you have separate product pages for PS3, PS4 and Vita here. And in terms of PS+, sales and game availability Asia is closer to EU/NA than to Japan from what I've seen."

PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,MithSeka,2,Wed Jun 24 14:06:38 2015 UTC,It was part of the IGC. Granted it is the trial version but iirc it was the PS4 game for a month.  Edit: See /u/MightyGreenPanda's comment below.
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,MightyGreenPanda,6,Wed Jun 24 16:45:39 2015 UTC,"Nope, when they were supposed to give it to us (last October, when the PS+ Edition was delayed the same day it was supposed to launch), we had 2 IGC games on PS4 as well as DriveClub. They stated that we would only get full games on the IGC. Also, DriveClub is going to be always available for PS+ users IIRC, not just for a limited time like the monthly IGC games."
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,MithSeka,4,Wed Jun 24 20:22:13 2015 UTC,I stand corrected. Thanks.
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,dfrazier81,3,Wed Jun 24 20:27:44 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why they didn't release yesterday then.   Servers would be down but at least the game could preload in a sense.  Tomorrow the servers will be overloaded and probably be down most of the day as well.  As much as people say ""Too late"" and ""I dont care"", fact is it will be a free racing game that most of those people will go ahead and download anyways.  I don't really care about the racing genre but I will get it because those games are fun once in awhile.   Honestly I think their best course would have just been to scrap the ps+ version and have the full game be part of IGC one month.  Would have saved them the bad PR and I am sure tons of money in the long run."
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,Ayyylien,3,Wed Jun 24 20:32:20 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a try, but I don't get excited over demos, regardless if it came out when it was supposed to or not."

PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,stinkybumbum,2,Wed Jun 24 16:47:43 2015 UTC,SO its free then?
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,itsfoine,2,Wed Jun 24 20:22:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm confused too with this. Is it. $25 today free tomorrow ?
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,itsfoine,4,Wed Jun 24 15:34:33 2015 UTC,"Nope, that's the full game if you've got PS+. Here's the pricing:    Price Description    $39.99 Full game without PS+   $24.99 Full game with PS+   $0 PS+ version (13 of India's tracks, 15 cars, and 27 trophies, including the Platinum.)"
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,PhillAholic,5,Wed Jun 24 15:50:08 2015 UTC,so what are you missing with the full game vs the PS+ version?
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,Lovegaming,9,Wed Jun 24 16:23:34 2015 UTC,From here:   Upgrading to the full version gets you 40+ additional cars and five other locations (comprising 65 total tracks).
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,Latinola1,2,Wed Jun 24 17:04:13 2015 UTC,"You get India and a small number of cars, but all the functionality including every event type, online play, clubs, challenges e.t.c. You can also platinum the game but you'll be playing a lot of events over and over again to do so. (Still the case for the full game, but you can get all but the last few golds inside of a weekend if you're decent at racing games)."
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,tbx5959,2,Wed Jun 24 17:06:54 2015 UTC,So this game is going to be free for PS+ subscribers finally. Awesome :D

PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,OHeyB,2,Wed Jun 24 20:23:49 2015 UTC,It's too funny that 9 months later they are finally giving it and it is (at least) starting as an offline version.  Took 9 months to flip the switch.
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,PhillAholic,4,Thu Jun 25 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"Wait, its an offline version? Doesn't that mean the effects on the server aren't going to be that bad? Or non-existent?   Can we assume now that Evolution not being able to upgrade their servers for 9 months has just been one big lie?"
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,rcognition,3,Wed Jun 24 16:08:10 2015 UTC,They've finally decided they're not making anymore money from impatient people and can finally flip the switch
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,itsfoine,2,Wed Jun 24 18:37:32 2015 UTC,No they are going to bring users online gradually so to make sure their server fixes are working. I haven't experienced a single server in the week I've had the game personally.
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,Latinola1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:29:14 2015 UTC,"Something scares me about the ""possible"" platinum.  Seems like it may be very difficult given what types of cars and tracks we get with this version."

You would need to buy the whole full game for them to kick in but I only read it off comments. So you may want to do more searching but if not we'll see once people get it.
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,Matt4045,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:51:06 2015 UTC,"A question to Driveclub owners, do the rain effects happen at random or are they assigned to certain tracks?  If it's the latter, can you use the rain effects on the India tracks?"
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,specterofthepast,3,Thu Jun 25 01:06:08 2015 UTC,yes you can see rain effects on India tracks.  weather effects by default I believe are set to random but you can customize the weather and time of day before each event

PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,ohmyword,-18,Wed Jun 24 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"I know I'm going to get downvoted for saying this but it's true. I swear all you people complaining are a bunch of entitled whining idiots. ""I WAS PROMISED IT AT LAUNCH!"" It's fucking free. Get over yourself.   People complaining about why it took so long after the promised date to fix the code has probably never coded anything more than a for loop. Code to optimize server load is probably harder than an if statement. In the real world, once something has gone to ""production"" priorities shift. A game that had 30 developers working on it prior to release will probably only have 1-2 resources for bugfix after release because resources shift to other projects."
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,longarmofmylaw,16,Wed Jun 24 15:28:43 2015 UTC,"On its own, you're right. If it had just been a game that got delayed, that'd be something we could all get our head around. But it was accompanied by a load of bullshit, and was used to soften the blow of multiplayer being behind a paywall now.  So its not the free game itself, its the bullshit surrounding it. Stop making it okay for companies to do this shit."
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,Waldinator,-8,Wed Jun 24 17:05:22 2015 UTC,multiplayer behind paywall? What are you talking about?
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,hedonistoic,5,Wed Jun 24 18:35:07 2015 UTC,"On PS4, you need PS Plus to play online. Sorry, I should've been clearer."
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,ssssssbob,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:50:29 2015 UTC,That's standard for all games isn't it? Or do you mean multiplayer on the one console?
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,PhillAholic,9,Wed Jun 24 19:55:05 2015 UTC,"But it's not ""free"". PSplus is a subscription model, so while it does make it relatively cheap with all the other games you get with subscription it is not entirely free"
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,peat76,18,Fri Jun 26 04:17:42 2015 UTC,People like you are exactly why developers and publishers can get away with broken promises
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,ohmyword,-9,Wed Jun 24 20:30:27 2015 UTC,Don't compare a free version of a game to something you paid $60 for. Evolutions first priority was getting the game working for those that did spend $60. After that they worried about the free users.
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,keeb119,-13,Wed Jun 24 17:16:35 2015 UTC,Every company in the world break promises.  Every person in the world breaks promises.   This current hate filled gaming community are doing my tits in.   The community was not like this even 5 years ago.  People  that think devs should be shot (with their families)  if the devs don't match what they originally hoped for (promised) should be fucking shot themselves.
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,ohmyword,-13,Wed Jun 24 17:42:06 2015 UTC,"How is it right to complain about something that you are getting for free at a date later than promised? If you got PS+ specifically for it, sure you got ripped off. But you could've cancelled until it came back. If you kept your subscription because you felt like it was coming soon anytime and then feel like you were getting strung along, then you are an idiot.   The internet has made people under the age of 30 not able to wait for more than 2 milliseconds. When I was young, videos games being released weren't something that you complain about. If the game didn't come out as scheduled you wait a little longer. If you don't want a broken game out of the gate, don't buy it right away. let the publishers know with your wallet. Stop preordering and wait for reviews to come out. No one but you cares about how much fun you are having with a video game."
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,keeb119,13,Wed Jun 24 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"funny, i remember when games didnt ship broken and you were supposed to ridicule the developer if they did."
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,Waldinator,-6,Wed Jun 24 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"Back before hard drives, games didn't get patched so out the door the game had to be near perfect without bugs. Which is why games were/get delayed back then. Now, when a game gets delayed people complain about why it's taking so long (See driveclub). If games don't get delayed but come out with bugs they complain about how its full of bugs and devs need to get their act together (see any game released in the last 5 years). You people are impossible to reason with."
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,IbanezHRC,3,Wed Jun 24 18:21:00 2015 UTC,"I'm all for a game getting delayed so it can work right when you play it. Having to wait,this long for something that should've not been a problem is why I'm frustrated.   On pcars they delay 9 months, release a broken game, wait over a month to patch it, its still broken. These sorts of things are unacceptable. For me it's getting to the point where there is abslutely no enjoyment in new games as they are undoubtedly broken. The joy of opening up a game and playing it is gone as the game is almost always broken. If rather save the money and wait. Which is bad for developers if enough people get that attitude."

PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,oakleez,5,Wed Jun 24 22:45:36 2015 UTC,FYI - You can't cancel your PS Plus subscription.  Once paid for it is yours until it expires. So people who bought PS Plus subscriptions with the promise of Drive Club as their major selling point have a legitimate reason to be upset and complain.  They were essentially swindled out of their money.
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,TygaFreak,3,Fri Jun 26 04:24:23 2015 UTC,"How is it right to complain about something that you are getting for free at a date later than promised?    One of the things that we were told to sell PS+ was that by buying it you would qualify for the driveclub + edition some 18 months ago. Yes, it's free, but it's also massively delayed compared to what we were told and it was a specific and well marketed selling point of PS4 PS+ accounts"
PlayStationPlus,3ayb5l,carterirons,2,Wed Jun 24 21:46:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  It's a game I would otherwise NEVER buy...but I'll try it out for free.  If it's good then awesome... if it's great, I can go for the platinum.  I signed up for PS+ before the PS4 even existed so anything they throw in as a perk is icing on the cake for me."

PlayStationPlus,3ay8qu,TweetPoster,15,Wed Jun 24 13:42:07 2015 UTC,Why is anyone surprised by this? There is precedence! UK/EU PS+ games are released the day after NA PS+ games. NA PS+ games are released on the first Tuesday of the month. I feel this should be an automatic post toward the end of every month like the PS Store update post about when the games update every week. What time does the store update? By 5 PM Pacific Standard Time on Tuesday!
PlayStationPlus,3ay8qu,obi5683,14,Wed Jun 24 16:08:44 2015 UTC,"You see, the cycle goes like thus:   Games come put the first Tuesday.  We then complain how they aren't as good as that one month long ago. Then we speculate what next month will have. Finally, there will be good games! Next comes the speculation of when the announcement that there will be an announcement for the following month's games. That's where we are today. Next comes the rumor that Drive Club is going to be ready soon.  (For sure this time!) Then they announce the games.  We are both excited for some games, as well as disappointed that it could be better if my favorite game were included. Finally the day comes and we ask when it'll be ready for our time zone but without mentioning which zone it is.  Or that it is two minutes past the hour they came up last month and should be ready.   Join in, it's never too late."

Rayman Legends might be switched with Tomb Raider DE since I bought that on sale, but I hope that it will be Rayman otherwise I will kick myself for not getting that on sale.

Dricveclub Ps Plus Edition has been released today, and that isn't part of July's games, but since it took Sony alot of money to do so and everything, we might be promised indies for sure now next month and maybe a few other months, and maybe not only that, but maybe Sony might cut back on triple A support on Ps Plus to compensate.  I post it in many places, but think people. For those who don't like indies, this could be bad for you. I don't mind, but think people. They just spent so much time getting a triple AAA game here, then one of their biggest games here, so next months is indies for sure."

PlayStationPlus,3b0qac,JT-Lionheart,2,Thu Jun 25 03:22:00 2015 UTC,Which games are those? I'm curious since I also have a BC PS3 from the early days but I have yet to have a game fail me.

PlayStationPlus,3b0qac,Latinola1,2,Thu Jun 25 05:59:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, more newer/modern games on the original PS3 tend to not work  as much, probably explains why Arkham Origins didn't work for me. But again, it could be that your PS3 could play Arkham Origins but the problem occurs with other games. It probably has to do with the updated technology in game now or that PS3 updates are beginning to take a toll on the original console. It's always best to have a newer PS3 model as it's meant to keep up with the updates. But I don't think you would want to spend money on a new one like me."

I think it was around £12  It's more 'relationship'-hunter than 'monster'..and while it does have turn based combat, it's quite different than FF. And mostly optional when you want to partake.  I pretty much love it. But it's quirky and won't be for everyone..I'd recommend checking it out on youtube, or reading some non-fanboy reviews, because they (and I) can gush about it, maybe a little too favourably."
PlayStationPlus,3ay4ak,Doomsdays97,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:33:45 2015 UTC,Anyone have any recommendations for someone who doesn't play Japanese games. Already going to pick up war of lions :)
PlayStationPlus,3ay4ak,Doomsdays97,2,Wed Jun 24 23:03:03 2015 UTC,"Since you mentioned War of the Lions, I'm going to recommend Vita games.  The Disgaea series is similar to Final Fantasy Tactics. I'm currently playing the fourth one and I love it.  If you're interested in JRPGs, Persona 4 Golden is one of the best.  And if you're interested in visual novel-like games, Virtue's Last Reward and the Danganronpa series are amazing. If possible, try to play 999 before VLR, but the game is only available on the DS (and iOS, but that version is missing the puzzles, AFAIK)."
PlayStationPlus,3ay4ak,Doomsdays97,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:13:44 2015 UTC,I know that final fantasy and disgaea are kinda linked but can I ask how?   I am waiting for P4G to go on sale and when I have a lot of time to dedicate to it :)   Also would you say to start with disgaea 4 first?
PlayStationPlus,3ay4ak,twilightskyris,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:19:44 2015 UTC,"They play very similarly, since they are both Strategy RPGs. You control a party of characters from a top-down perspective, taking turns. Disgaea is quite grindy, since you can level each character to level 9999, reincarnate them (a lot of times), level up their skills, level up each item, etc. It's not for everyone, but you may like it a lot. :)  You can start with Disgaea 4. As far as I know, Disgaea D2 is a sequel to Disgaea 1, while all the other games are standalone (I may be wrong)."
PlayStationPlus,3ay4ak,Doomsdays97,2,Wed Jun 24 13:23:39 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for the reply :D

PlayStationPlus,3ay4ak,Sicmay,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:36:28 2015 UTC,I've actually played dragons dogma before because it was on plus and quite enjoyed but I think another game I wanted to play came out and I never went back to it.
PlayStationPlus,3ay4ak,ptikku,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:16:39 2015 UTC,"So how is Oreshika? I remember being somewhat interested in it when it came out... but for the life of me I cant actually remember why right now xD I think maybe it was the art style.  Also, Toukiden Kiwami. Worth it at £17.50? How is the Vita version? I was originally waiting to pick it up on pc but it's released with a price of £50. So that's not happening."

PlayStationPlus,3awrz0,Gcoks,6,Wed Jun 24 03:12:15 2015 UTC,Saw this on the Vita store.

PlayStationPlus,3av0mj,wolfmankipp,6,Tue Jun 23 20:00:23 2015 UTC,I know seriously! FWIW I gave in and bought the game for $24.99 and it's definitely worth it. I am having a lot of fun with it.

PlayStationPlus,3av0mj,dfrazier81,5,Tue Jun 23 23:00:59 2015 UTC,It was released prematurely - https://www.facebook.com/driveclubofficial?fref=nf
PlayStationPlus,3av0mj,Aram_Fingal,2,Tue Jun 23 23:19:39 2015 UTC,Possibly the store isn't updated yet.  Usually not fully updated every week until 6pm for me so give it a couple hours

PlayStationPlus,3av0mj,FadeToBlack1,8,Tue Jun 23 19:39:38 2015 UTC,"Weird, I wonder why they didn't announce this at E3?"
PlayStationPlus,3av0mj,SiriusC,38,Tue Jun 23 19:00:31 2015 UTC,The whole Driveclub ps+ thing has been a huge embarrassment for Sony. They didn't want to highlight this at the biggest gaming week of the year so just releasing it quietly is probably the best thing they could do.
PlayStationPlus,3av0mj,Dicethrower,3,Tue Jun 23 19:16:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess if they were to announce it they'd have to acknowledge the fact that they didn't deliver previously."
PlayStationPlus,3av0mj,Heratiki,2,Tue Jun 23 19:29:49 2015 UTC,"Knowing a bit about how SONY does business, Evolution studios is not going to survive this embarrassment. They're better off cutting their losses and starting over under a new name.       In March 2015, 55 staff members were cut from Evolution Studio, which sources say is approximately half the studio. The redundancies have been described by Sony as a way to focus the studio on developing Driveclub as a service.     And so they do."
PlayStationPlus,3av0mj,SiriusC,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:31:23 2015 UTC,"Especially now that they've pulled and and stated the exact same reason it never showed in the first place.

PlayStationPlus,3av0mj,letsgometros,8,Wed Jun 24 04:36:08 2015 UTC,Probably because they've announced it at E3 before... in 2013.  And because there wasn't an official announcement this could just be a mistake.  Edit: And it appears a lot of people are getting errors.

I suck at racing games, even though I love them and I really enjoyed what I played. It feels like it's something you can learn and get better at.   The graphics (and sound) are really nice effects wise but the visuals are a little below what I was expecting. That being said the feel of the driving is probably the best of any sim type racing games I've ever played.  I'm thrilled to have it and even tempted a bit to buy the full but I won't. There's enough in there to last me awhile. I think it will be a nice change of pace to play that for a bit between TLOU and Tomb Raider, my only actual purchases for PS4, the rest being PS+ titles, of which there are many, which makes me giddy"

PlayStationPlus,3auzls,lockescythe,5,Tue Jun 23 20:23:14 2015 UTC,"Same here. Weird thing for me - I was planning on buying the dlc at some point, but now I’m not sure. Still, I promised to buy Invisible inc. when it comes to PS4 ;)"
PlayStationPlus,3auzls,lockescythe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:27:55 2015 UTC,I'll also probably buy don't starve together when it hits ps4. So it's not like I'm against giving this company money.

PlayStationPlus,3auzls,modemhead-,4,Fri Jun 26 13:43:59 2015 UTC,thanks!! i dont really play that game but now i have it on 4 platforms ... maybe now its time to check it out :P
PlayStationPlus,3auzls,PornoPichu,2,Wed Jun 24 00:36:28 2015 UTC,"For what it worth, I think it’s one of the best games we got on PS+. The first few hours are really fun when everything is new. Don’t spoil yourself too much by looking about the game on the internet – a big part of the fun is figuring out the inner mysteries of this Tim Burton-esque world.   Oh, and for your first tries, start with the original content – don’t start with the Giant edition content – it’s a little hard."
PlayStationPlus,3auzls,PornoPichu,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:17:24 2015 UTC,"I have such a hard time with the game. I'm always bumbling around the controls, and I feel like I never find enough stuff to actually make anything of substance. It just feels like I'm only finding enough stuff to feed myself barely and make a fire at night. Then I die and don't want to try it all over again"
PlayStationPlus,3auzls,TX_domin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:25:37 2015 UTC,"In vanilla (not giant edition), I start my games by collecting a lot of resources (twig, grass, wood, etc.) before finding a spot for my camp. I also try to find some gold for science stuff. I focus on exploring in order to find the herd of buffalo for some easy manure and wool. Manure is great to build farms and wool will become handy when winter comes. Football helmets are a must to, but getting around pig skin is though.

PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,turtle_mummy,38,Mon Jun 22 20:15:48 2015 UTC,"The stupidest thing is where they say you need to have at least 2 systems to make it worth it, yet just spent a paragraph earlier explaining that the crossbuy system means you can get up to 5 games in one month with just the PS4.  It is an advantage to have more than one system, but crossbuy makes it less urgent."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,jschild,4,Mon Jun 22 20:24:45 2015 UTC,"I felt like that article was written by an XboxOne owner, especially in the passage you said and other few things like the quality and number of GwG games. I think it's not objective at all. People should talk about that without necessairly joining a side, seeing things as they really are and trying to be fair in their conclusions."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,01luca01,0,Tue Jun 23 09:10:16 2015 UTC,"But that doesn't work for every month. Sure one month you can get 5 games, but maybe next month you'll be holding 2 indies. The last few months they have been focusing more on ps4, while ps3 gets almost nothing. Before it was the opposite, ps4 getting almost nothing with ps3 getting 3-4 games because of cross-buy. We never know what is coming next, but the tendency is to focus on ps4 obviously.  As a ps3 only subscriber, i feel like i'm getting less value every month that comes by, i'm not even sure if i'll re-subscribe in 3 months when mine ends (already started playing the games that i still want to play, in fear that i won't want to renew it). If i had either a vita or a ps4, i'm sure i'd feel like im getting way more value from ps+."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,heisenbergfan,8,Mon Jun 22 21:24:47 2015 UTC,"Of course PS3 only subscribers are getting less value, PS4 is the system Sony is focusing on as they should be."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,DrunkeNinja,0,Tue Jun 23 01:21:01 2015 UTC,"That's a way too simple line of thought tho.  Sure ps4 is the priority, but PS4 users alerady need ps+ to play online. Ps3 users have nothing other than the free games and discounts, if they don't give ps3 users an incentive, they might lose a share of the subscribers. If you think that there aren't many active ps3 users you are very naive."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,heisenbergfan,5,Tue Jun 23 01:22:24 2015 UTC,"There are not that many PS3 only Plus subscribers.  Besides, Sony hasn't cut them off, but they will be moving the focus further away from PS3 as they should, just like game makers have lessened their focus on PS3.  The main focus should be on the main platform which is continuing to grow, and that's the PS4.  PS4 is what is driving Sony forward, not PS3."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,DrunkeNinja,4,Tue Jun 23 01:26:51 2015 UTC,Do you have any numbers in regards for how many PS3 subscribers there are vs PS4?
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,BEAR_DICK_PUNCH,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:34:14 2015 UTC,Not him but I imagine a lot of PS4 Plus members are using plus on their PS3 too and getting the games if they have one. So not sure how accurate it would be if you wanted to compare them assuming we had the numbers. Going by how many people were playing Hardline on PS4 I'd probably say there are more subscribers on PS4 than PS3 since you have to have it for online.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,BlindStark,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:11:03 2015 UTC,"I used to be a PS3-only Plus subscriber, until the quality of the games offered started to decline about a year ago. Now I only game on PC, and don't plan on buying a PS4.  Sony's loss, really. Especially considering there are 4 times as many PS3's than PS4's out in the wild."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,redditsucksandsodoyo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:38:21 2015 UTC,"PS4 owners are mainly the ones buying new games though, not PS3 owners.  That's why there are many big AAA titles that have been released or will be released in the near future that are only on the current gen.  Sony is still supporting the PS3, but it's support is waning since the PS3 is obsolete.  It's an 8 year old console.  If you were not getting a PS3, you would eventually be cancelling your membership anyways unless for some reason you thought full support was going to continue indefinitely."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,DrunkeNinja,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:56:14 2015 UTC,"That's my point, I definitely would have kept giving them 50 bucks a year. Now they get zero."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,redditsucksandsodoyo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:37:19 2015 UTC,I think the money they make from not prioritizing an obsolete console makes up for the loss of your $50.  Videogames are a business.  Full support for an 8 year old console would be ridiculous when their newer console is available and driving sales.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,DrunkeNinja,2,Fri Jun 26 18:47:28 2015 UTC,The games aren't the only factor for having Plus. The cloud saves is the biggest reason I have it. The games are secondary. I've had two ps3's ylod but was only mildly inconvenienced. All I had to do was download my game saves on the new one and I was good to go.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,dracula3811,2,Tue Jun 23 14:14:58 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, not my case...  My main account is not from US, so back in the day i had to subscribe for the US PS+ on a new account (nowadays they have ps+ on my country, same games as US, but if i change i'll lose every game from the last 3 years, not really worth it). I don't get access to the cloud save since i'm not playing on the ps+ acc.  my HD is reasonably big tho (320gb i think ?), so i don't have many issues, ofc sometimes i have to delete games to download another ones, but that's np for me.  All i get are the games and the discounts =|, which are great, don't get me wrong (or i wouldn't be a 3 year subscriber). I have bought many decent games during these years, so even if i stop sub'ing i'll still have a bunch of games available, Max Payne 3, nfs hot pursuit and most wanted, Tales of Xillia, diablo 3 evil edition, twd season 1, south park, bioshock 1, journey,  ferrari race experience, game of thrones rpg, just from the top of my head (some might not have been ps+ only discounts tho)."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,heisenbergfan,2,Tue Jun 23 14:16:27 2015 UTC,"I was PS3 only for a while. I just keep adding the games for when I finally do upgrade. I won't have that awkward new system with only one game phase.  I recently got a PS Vita TV while it was on sale for $40. It's not the greatest thing, but I get to play some Vita games I've been missing out on.   Unless you're a Vita only subscriber, I think it's still worth it. Soon it may not be for the PS3, if you don't plan on upgrading."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,KingDoink,2,Tue Jun 23 04:39:31 2015 UTC,"I ""buy"" the ps4 games too, but i have no idea when i'll be able to get a ps4 (economy not doing good in my country, ps4 is ridiculously expensive here and no plans of flying to usa right now since our money is worth even less out there). I'm certainly not gonna keep subscribing just for the ps4 games, but im still hoping that sony can surprise me with a few ps3 offers in the next 3 months so i can keep paying.  First time i'm hearing about that ps vita tv, i'll google that out to see what is it about."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,heisenbergfan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:04:26 2015 UTC,"The PS Vita TV is just called the Playstation TV in the US, and I noticed yesterday that it is $50 new on Amazon at the moment. It still isn't worthwhile for me (I'd rather have a Vita if I'm going to play Vita games), but I can see the appeal."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,commenter_on_reddit,2,Tue Jun 23 16:05:12 2015 UTC,"To be fair, as a PS4 only subscriber, it's only very recently where the games are halfway decent. I don't care for indies, and all the cool PS3 titles don't apply to me."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,rebelx,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:52:01 2015 UTC,i know it is only recently that ps4 has gotten better. PS3's has declined a lot from a year or two ago.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,heisenbergfan,12,Tue Jun 23 00:17:06 2015 UTC,"If you have Vita/PS3/PS4 -- PS+ is clearly a better value.   I think the Games with Gold have mostly been pretty lackluster, but that's a subjective thing so... idk."

PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,PrinceAli311,7,Tue Jun 23 03:07:25 2015 UTC,Plus has become terrible since going compulsory.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,ProfessorPhi,2,Tue Jun 23 03:25:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think it's more that PS4 games aren't that impressive -- because they are all indie games."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,blaek_,2,Tue Jun 23 03:36:51 2015 UTC,"PS3 & Vita owner here - I agree with /u/ProfessorPhi. It has most definitely changed.  I barely decided to renew my subscription for another year, and I really haven't gotten much out of it.  You're right - PS4 is getting a lot of indie games. But the PS3 isn't getting the same AAA stuff it used to.  Frankly, it seems like the IGC has become ""Here's this month's 8-bit side scroller"". It was fun at first, but now I'm fairly tired of it. At least I'm catching up on the backlog :P"
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,rand486,2,Tue Jun 23 16:57:15 2015 UTC,"Overall I still feel like PS+ is a better value, but it's worth bringing up with the backwards compatibility announcement, GWG has a lot of potential in the coming months.  1 Xbox One title, 2 360 titles(that will likely be playable on Xbox one)."

PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,ZoopZeZoop,10,Tue Jun 23 13:19:53 2015 UTC,This click bait article is crap. Why not break down the month to month at-time retail value of the games presented? What percentage of consoles have users with their respective plus accounts?  I've only recently seen Xbox offer games that weren't halo/fable or any game you've already played because you own an xbox. i'm happy with my ps4 and the Plus service. it exposes me to games i may not even think twice about playing.   xbox exclusives have little to no appeal to me and i'd bank most of the games i do have interest in make their way to steam eventually.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,Fruhmann,6,Mon Jun 22 21:38:07 2015 UTC,"This click bait article is crap. Why not break down the month to month at-time retail value of the games presented?

I love looking at & analyzing numbers so I was espe geared up to read through it.  But really, they're not doing anything more than what we're doing now. Just talking about it & discussing the pros & cons of each service. We can do that ourselves!"
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,SiriusC,8,Mon Jun 22 22:13:34 2015 UTC,I felt like that article tried really hard at making a point and then would contradict that point in a few paragraphs.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,TimeTravelingDog,16,Mon Jun 22 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"Sony has a bad habit of padding PS Plus with really low budget indie titles   ...   whereas the Xbox One headliner for Games with Gold in June, Massive Chalice, despite being a crowdfunded game with a relatively small budget, provides significantly more playtime and replay value.   You mean like that?"
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,shitmyspacebar,7,Mon Jun 22 23:20:13 2015 UTC,The source also acts as if low budget instantly equals low quality or lacking fun.  The whole time the author shat on PSPlus and praised Games with gold yet his final statement seemed like someone completely different wrote it.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,bino420,6,Tue Jun 23 01:15:16 2015 UTC,"The IGC concept is awesome, but Sony should work on better digital sales."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,McsPwr,2,Mon Jun 22 21:33:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  PS+ was great back in 2012 but it's a shadow of its former self.  I don't think I'd have much of a problem if the IGC disappeared altogether if it meant digital pricing got more realistic.  Most of the free games I've played already on PC.  Most of the games on the store I got cheaper months-to-years ago on PC.  My vertical standing PS4 is pretty much a headset stand.  Time for the down-voters to do their work anyway.  Que Sera, Sera."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,konstructiv,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:36:05 2015 UTC,I would agree but PS4 doesnt have the catalog available to give bigger games away yet. Sure PS3 games have dipped a bit but it was bound to happen. PC does bite into the indie market though which is a shame.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,LukeNeverShaves,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:16:19 2015 UTC,"I don't want bigger games.  I said I wouldn't mind if the IGC was discontinued altogether provided the retail price of games was more competitive.  I would like to give Sony money for quality games, but priced the way they are, it's pointless buying them for PS4.  As for indie games, even the new releases are actually ancient.  Super Meat Boy being a classic example.  My mistake I suppose for buying a PS4 when I already have a gaming class PC... not that you really need a gaming class PC to play games like Super Meat Boy."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,konstructiv,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:25:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a tough thing. I'm gonna hope SMB has some new levels and something new from the standard game. Sony's digital pricing won't ever be very competitive because they're they only place you can buy a game digitally for their system, Amazon sells some but not all."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,LukeNeverShaves,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:35:20 2015 UTC,Sony's digital pricing won't ever be very competitive   I tend to agree with you but since somebody posted this link here a few months ago...  http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-11-28-sony-explains-ps4-digital-game-pricing  ...I'm hoping we're both wrong.  That article is seventeen months old now and I'm not aware of any change in pricing strategy at all.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,konstructiv,16,Fri Jun 26 19:15:56 2015 UTC,depends on the month  I would say though that now that the XB1 is getting Backwards compatibility if all future 360 games w/ gold games are backwards compatible then that will add content and perhaps value for XB1 owners.  Since as of now for PS+ you have to own the hardware to take advantage of all the available games.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,HARDonE,9,Mon Jun 22 20:23:20 2015 UTC,"depends on the month   It really doesn't if you own all platforms or just current gen.  I would say GwG took the Rayman Legends month but that's about it for current gen alone.   Remember though, PS4 gets two games per month and that's not including anything that's cross-buy.    Now, if you don't have a Vita but have the rest, then I think they go toe to toe a bit better but, as it stands now, I don't think any impartial observer would choose the last year of GwG over PS+.  Going forward, who knows?  GwG could up it to 2 XB1 games per month and make all 360 games on the service playable on XB1.  They could go full AAA.  But as it stands now, I don't think the discussion is close.  On a personal note, I've kind of been disappointed in both lately."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,IceBreak,5,Mon Jun 22 21:43:13 2015 UTC,Agreed. Microsoft could really steal the show from Sony if they continue releasing titles for the X1 and couple that with 2 360 games a month that are Backwards Compatible.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,Heratiki,2,Mon Jun 22 22:34:03 2015 UTC,I would say it depends on the bigger picture than any one month.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,SiriusC,3,Mon Jun 22 22:20:41 2015 UTC,"Not much in the way of specifics here, but it's helpful for those unfamiliar with the two programs. It would be nice to see the game lists compared head-to-head to help users see exactly what games they would be getting with each service."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,Decyde,3,Mon Jun 22 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"Depends on the console.  Generally it's PS4 12/12 months compared to XB1.  With PS3 vs Xbox 360, it's more around 7 or 8 / 12."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,SiriusC,3,Mon Jun 22 20:36:20 2015 UTC,"They criticized Sony for padding the games they offer with ""really low budget indie titles that don't offer a lot of value"", then use MGS: Ground Zeroes as an example. What?! That really irritated me. And they mentioned that it can be beaten in less than 10 minutes. A lot of games can be beaten in an absurd amount of time! And you can only do that if you've played so many times that you know every single ounce of it. If you're playing it to where you can complete it within 10 minutes then you've thoroughly enjoyed that game. Not to mention the rest of the content in there."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,Sicmay,2,Mon Jun 22 22:20:05 2015 UTC,To be fair MGSGZ can be beaten very quick even without learning the game. Took me hour and half from when I put disc in and I wasn't exactly rushing (was tryihn to be sneaky and save prisoners also). It's not really a full AAA title

The fact they were asking for $40 at one point is fucking mind blowing. If anything the ""game"" should've just been released this month, for free basically like P.T. cause that's what Ground Zeros is, a playable trailer."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,SiriusC,2,Tue Jun 23 04:20:42 2015 UTC,If you're only playing the story I can absolutely see how it would feel like a playable trailer. But there's otherwise a ton of content in GZ that can keep you very busy.

PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,mesenkomaha,3,Tue Jun 23 00:07:26 2015 UTC,I own both families of systems and find the PS Plus to be a better value.  It is cheaper and since I have all three eligible consoles my library is bursting with games.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,leshadowbanned69,3,Tue Jun 23 00:17:00 2015 UTC,"PS+ slowly spiraled into crap territory after the PS4 came out and made it mandatory for online gaming. PSVita and PS3 owner here, I can definitely say Games With Gold is a far better deal since one you get to keep the games if you ever go back to silver and two they're mostly retail games and not indie garbage (note the mostly before jumping on me)  Also, some months GWG users are get 3 or up to 4 games for one system."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,-jackschitt-,4,Wed Jun 24 19:21:33 2015 UTC,"When PS+ first started, it was shored up heavily by mainstream titles such as Just Cause 2, Bioshock 2, Uncharted 3, Far Cry 2, etc. etc. etc., leading many people to believe that PS+ would be a way for people to play older top games at a bargain price while essentially hyping up the next sequel in the franchise, while also offering several indie titles as well.  The mainstream titles have all but disappeared in favor of indie titles.  The fact that this happened around the same time they made PS+ mandatory for the PS4 should be considered no coincidence, since they no longer needed top titles to entice people to buy a subscription that they largely had to buy anyway.    And while some of the indie titles are quite good, there have been plenty of real stinkers as well.  Also, indies aren't everybody's cup of tea -- not everybody wants to play a bunch of 2D sidescrollers and games that look like they could've been made 15 years ago.  Simply put, Indie games don't sell subscriptions.  Indie games don't move systems.  I know people who bought PS3s and PS+ subscriptions because they thought getting a steady stream of games like Bioshock, Shadow of the Colossus, Just Cause, Far Cry, Sleeping Dogs, etc. was a really good deal.  I don't really see a bunch of people tripping all over themselves over games like Apotheon and Super Exploding Zoo.  It's one thing to promote indie games.  It's another thing to shove them down everybody's throats and expect them to like it.  I'm not saying that every single game has to be an older AAA title, but one title a month wouldn't hurt."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,Sicmay,6,Mon Jun 22 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"When PS+ first started, it was shored up heavily by mainstream titles such as Just Cause 2, Bioshock 2, Uncharted 3, Far Cry 2, etc. etc. etc.,    No it wasn't. When it first started it was mostly indies, ps one games and minis. When the IGC started about year and half later is when the AAA came"
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,naylord,2,Mon Jun 22 23:42:58 2015 UTC,"Shoving indies down your throat would be automatically downloading them, installing them and forcing you to play them for at least an hour (and earn 2 trophies to prove you actually played and not just left it on) before you were given permission to uninstall it.  What they are really doing is just offering tons of indies because relative to the metascores they often achieve by being often quite good, they are cheap to lease out and acquire for the service. Offering!=shoving down throat."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,DrunkeNinja,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:23:34 2015 UTC,"PS Plus started with giving away mainly indies, smaller games, PS titles, and minis.  They then transitioned into the bigger AAA titles and I'm guessing they did this because they knew they were going down the road of having Plus mandatory for online in the future and that's what they did with PS4.  They made Plus into this great program that when they announced Plus as a requirement for online gaming on PS4, people largely didn't care because PS Plus was so beloved.  Since PS4 came out, they have greatly lessened the big AAA titles given out.  I still think it's worth $50 a year, but it's value has lessened."

PlayStation Plus has given out 388 games.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Instant_Game_Collection_games_(North_America)  That is a HUGE, very quantifiable difference.  I would also argue that PS+ also has superior quality of games but that is much more subjective."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,Sicmay,3,Mon Jun 22 23:38:04 2015 UTC,What would you expect - it's been around much longer. It's no good for new users- to benefit from that you'd have to have been already subbed for all that time
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,Yangoose,0,Mon Jun 22 23:46:46 2015 UTC,"No, Xbox Gold has been around as a paid service much longer.  They just chose not to give any free games for a long time."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,Sicmay,4,Mon Jun 22 23:48:36 2015 UTC,Yes but Games with Gold hasn't and that's the part of Xbox Gold we are talking about. What use is a past comparison

Looking forward if/when I move to next-gen/current gen, though I'll probably go for a PS4, the backwards compatibility would be something I'd be wanting Sony to copy."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,Redarmy1917,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:00:11 2015 UTC,"Except they can't unless they literally put a PS3 within the PS4, like they did with PS3's launch, having a PS2 within it. Which also caused the initial price to be $600 and you'd probably be looking at a similar price point if not slightly higher for a PS3 within the PS4."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,thefigpucker,2,Tue Jun 23 04:24:35 2015 UTC,No MS handheld and more games on PS+ so PS+ wins I think.

PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,LukeNeverShaves,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:41:30 2015 UTC,You can also buy PS+ subs for cheaper too. Sales mean nothing unless sony is selling their XBL for $30 all the time and Sony never has PS+ sales.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,Sicmay,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:08:18 2015 UTC,Rarely. In the UK I can (or could even- I don't own an Xbox)almost always get a years Xbox live for £25 but PS+ is £35 at its cheapest
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,LukeNeverShaves,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:03:34 2015 UTC,Xbox is also trying to play catch up when the PS4 launched they had $25 for the year as did Xbox to try and bring in the sales. Ps4 is still selling very well while MS tapered off needing they to have more sales and do more to win people. I usually get PS+ for $30-$40 around the time my sub expires and can't say I watch Xbox very much to know when sales hit but watching /r/consoledeals I don't see very many XBL sales that often.

PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,reaper527,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:35:10 2015 UTC,"doubtful, because the pricing today is consistent with the pricing we saw at the end of the last generation, before the x1/ps4 were even announced. that was a time when sony was playing catch up."
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,LukeNeverShaves,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:53:30 2015 UTC,"Funny because before the PS4 launch I was paying $30 for PSN very often. Sony was playing catch up which made their service tend to be cheaper, now its the other way around."

PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,ps4more,-5,Tue Jun 23 02:30:38 2015 UTC,Games with gold allows you to keep and play the content even if you unsubscribe from the monthly payment. Playstation plus dose not allow you to access your downloaded games once you stop paying for the subscription.  Games with gold is better.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,LukeNeverShaves,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:28:22 2015 UTC,With the subscriptions being required to play online I think it doesnt matter as like 95% of those with a PS4 have PS+. Also you more games with PS+ if they were giving those away for free to every PS+ subscriber theyd lose a good amount of money.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,reaper527,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:05:57 2015 UTC,that's only half true. on the x1 your games are tied to your subscription. what you are talking about is only for the x360.
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,reaper527,0,Tue Jun 23 18:25:18 2015 UTC,what a shitty article
PlayStationPlus,3aqz7j,grbolivar,-2,Tue Jun 23 18:24:17 2015 UTC,"My humble opinion on this subject:  1) The ""Games with Gold allows you to keep the free games FOREVER"" is more like an illusion trick, why? Simply because without a Xbox Live subscription the Xboxes are bricks with no online features, so in the end players are forced to keep the subscription if they want full access to their games, making the ""free forever"" offer irrelevant.  2) With a very few exceptions almost all games offered on GwG are total crap. PS+ has offered a lot of great titles over the years, every month there's at least one or two really good titles.  3) Lets be honest, most players play a game once or twice then move on with another game, there's no need to own such games so renting it a-la PS+ is much better than owning it (unless you like it of course and/or plan to play it for a long time).  4) If you own all three systems PS+ is a no-brainer, you'll be getting 6 games per month, for me that's more than I can play.  5) And I am not even mentioning the other nice features like cloud-saving, demos AND special discounts of PS+."

I haven't even played a ton of games on my PS4 and I've been getting constant ""cannot upload save file"" errors because a few of my games have pretty large saves.  It's 2015 and game saves can border 200 megs (or more) if they're crazy robust. Sony needs to just give unlimited save storage across the board. The people who only store a few small games will more than make up for people like me who store a gig and a half or whatever I'll be storing.  Plus, this is only hurting their biggest buyers directly - people who both play and buy a ton of games and subscribe to +. It's silly that they've haven't done something about it yet."
PlayStationPlus,3auzu1,coheedcollapse,3,Tue Jun 23 19:37:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree. Storage is cheap andpeople with a lot of game saves are probably Sony's best customers, they need to get on that."

PlayStationPlus,3auzu1,joaobenin,-22,Tue Jun 23 19:24:01 2015 UTC,"guys guys here's how you do it. get your annual renewal time around the holidays, pay per month, get a free 3 month trial whatever, until you can buy it for $40 or even less. For example, last year I got the $80 for $100 PSN credit on ebay, then used it to buy 2 years worth of plus.  If you plan to have Plus indefinitely it's worth it to go through the small hassle.  I still say you're lazy, I've never paid full price for it and never will."

This set up has been good, as it comes to 2 bucks a month (50/24 = $2) for me. The games wouldn't have been my first choice the past couple months for Vita, but there is no harm in broadening my horizons. Some of my favorite games now, I would have never played if I didn't try something new."
PlayStationPlus,3auzu1,MisterTruth,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:51:25 2015 UTC,Its not 3.33 everywhere in the world. In Mexico we're charged in dollars for some reason while south american countries are charged in local currencies which leads to cheaper games. I think Brazil especially enjoys the cheaper games (not entirely sure though) So with the current rate of pesos to dollars I pay a about the cost of a brand new sealed game here in Mexico.  Considering the crappy indie games PS+ gets monthly or games I bought dirt cheap from previous sales I'd rather spend my money on a brand new game I will play instead of gambling it with Sony.  PS+ used be an amazing deal back when I subbed around half year after it started but not so much now.

If Ether One wasn't so broken, I would say that all of the May games were worth trying. I can't say anything about Murasaki Baby since I don't have a Vita and it doesn't work on PSTV. Ether One is a great exploration title, but the many bugs in the game keep me from playing it. Race the Sun is a good time waster. Hohokum is a game that I still don't understand, but it's a relaxing game. The Unfinished Swan is a fantastic exploration game. Guacamelee is a good Metroidvania with up to 4 players. The best part about May was that three of the games could be played on all three platforms. Murasaki Baby was only on Vita. Guacamelee STCE and Ether One were only on PS4. There is a version of Guacamelee on PS3, but this was not the same version."

PlayStationPlus,3alqst,pajaro11,3,Mon Jun 22 07:59:24 2015 UTC,10 million combined. Which was the same as Black flag the previous year. Most people would look at that and assume unity made up a majority of the sales
PlayStationPlus,3alqst,StammeringSam,0,Mon Jun 22 08:04:20 2015 UTC,But thats our assumption not fact. Also you have to expect they expected cannibalism of sales for each title. Maybe they just wanted the two to match the success of black flag the year before. They claim they are hapoy and overall profits are up i would believe its a sucess. Again the only place anyone says its a flop is reddit.
PlayStationPlus,3alqst,pajaro11,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:13:35 2015 UTC,Yeah probably just a assumption but it seems Unity may have got more sales for being a next gen game. Rogue I would imagine may got close but probably didn't hit the mark for what the game cost to make it possibly. Still want to play Rogue but not on last gen.
PlayStationPlus,3alqst,JT-Lionheart,8,Mon Jun 22 18:02:36 2015 UTC,Not a leak. This sort of stuff happens all the time because the PS Store is extremely buggy.

PlayStationPlus,3alpl5,dougieman97,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:31:20 2015 UTC,At least I have the USB option. But obviously given the distance the PS+ option would be way better.  Any tutorial on how to do this after signing up?
PlayStationPlus,3alpl5,dougieman97,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:33:00 2015 UTC,"I mean, he could download it to a usb and send it to you through the internet... How did you play the game? On his user or on a separate user?"
PlayStationPlus,3alpl5,dougieman97,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:14:57 2015 UTC,True that. I did play the game on his user in Germany at his home.  Does that change anything?
PlayStationPlus,3alpl5,dougieman97,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:36:11 2015 UTC,"If it's on his user/account, I don't know if you can still transfer the saves (both on usb and on plsplus) onto another account :/ I THINK saves are registered to the ps4 account, but i'm not the expert on this, so i recommend you try with the USB. But if you want to go through the PSplus route, and it's on his account, then you're going to have to tell him to back up his saves to the cloud on his ps4, and then you have to sign in on his account on your ps4 and restore the saves from the cloud. Hope this helps."
PlayStationPlus,3alpl5,b_ukkake,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:39:06 2015 UTC,"For the usb, there's a thing on save data management that lets you backup the saves to a usb, then from there you could connect it to a PC and host them online or something so you can download them onto your ps4. You just download them onto another usb, plug them into your ps4, and in the same 'save data management' area, there should be a restore from usb feature."
PlayStationPlus,3aj4kr,Tidus755,3,Sat Jun 20 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"Sony checks the address on your card very closely, I had this problem before and it was because I had the Apartment number on the wrong line than I did on my CC. Once you format your address to be completely identical to what your bank has on file try that and see if that works.  Edit: I just noticed you said you had it work a couple days ago, I guess that rules out a formatting error. Hmm not sure what it could be then."
PlayStationPlus,3aj4kr,Rassirian,2,Sat Jun 20 22:32:57 2015 UTC,"I might have edited something about my address though, I forgot if I changed it before or after I got problems, I'll look into it thanks!

Weird thing is, one day before i tried to add funds to my wallet I was able to buy destiny on the ps store no problem with that exact same card. But now that i try to pre-order Arkham Knight they won't let me, tried everything but no dice. Guess I'll have to go physical there."
PlayStationPlus,3aj4kr,Wood_Ape,6,Mon Jun 22 19:06:32 2015 UTC,"First, check if you have the expiration data updated on your account.  Secondly, tread lightly, gaming buddy. I have zero faith in Sony's abilities to keep their customer data private. There was the huge PSN outage a few years ago that lasted for over a month because a shitload of data was stolen. There have been issues in the past where user's accounts have been jeopardized and credit card information has been used to put money in wallets then instantly spent on FIFA and all the DLC. This happened to me (caught it before they could spend the money) and happened to a gaming friend of mine (he didn't catch it and had to eat $200 or have his account banned). DO NOT TRUST SONY with your information.  My own paranoia has allowed me to see easier methods to adding funding. Go to Amazon and buy a PSN Card. They will issue it electronically and send you a redemption code. Input the code and it will add the funds to your wallet. The only difference here is that you might not be able to put exact amounts of money onto your wallet."

PlayStationPlus,3anb86,Matt4045,46,Mon Jun 22 03:21:23 2015 UTC,So you blazed through a game designed for stealth in 20 minutes and then wondered why you didn't enjoy it?  Wow. A true mystery.
PlayStationPlus,3anb86,obi5683,16,Mon Jun 22 13:40:58 2015 UTC,"'Awful' is a bit much. The game mechanics were pretty great.           They should have added more content though, especially considering they charged for it. I spent longer in Episode Duscae than in this game."

PlayStationPlus,3anb86,Matt4045,3,Mon Jun 22 14:26:00 2015 UTC,"You had to purchase a $60 game to get a demo, and for me, Type-0 was not worth a purchase. I'm sure that a lot of people enjoyed it, but it does not look interesting to me."
PlayStationPlus,3anb86,obi5683,3,Mon Jun 22 14:47:22 2015 UTC,"I spent $27 on Type-0 because I wanted it. It was long after launch so I had no idea whether it would be one of the launch copies that contained the demo code in it, that played no part in my purchase. It was also a pretty great game, exceeded my expectations. Very fluid and responsive combat and an ending that I won't forget any time soon.             Real, tangible changes were being made to XV based on feedback from the demo, it was the right decision to limit this to fans of the series."
PlayStationPlus,3anb86,Keaton_x,2,Mon Jun 22 15:00:46 2015 UTC,"Pleasant surprise on your part. Had they announced an HD version of Crisis Core and included the demo on that, I would have purchased that game in a heartbeat. I wouldn't have even cared if the demo was on it or not."

Gives a good look into the new mechanics of MGS and is a nice filler until MGSV gets here. The added missions also give some replay value. Heck, I was playing it earlier tonight, going through trying to get all the unlockables."
PlayStationPlus,3anb86,Veranek,7,Mon Jun 22 01:42:37 2015 UTC,"You got 100% in 32 minutes, 10 of which was the intro? Just because you beat one mission, doesn't mean you beat the game.  Get 'S' ranks on all missions and then I'll listen to your complaints."

Hypothetically this cost you only a $1, so I don't see the point in getting butthurt and calling the game awful...  Math Proof using Science   MSRP PSN+ 1 year $49.99/12 = $4-5 per month  PSN+ free games per month = 4-5 titles  Therefore OP equals bundle of twigs as butthurt goes to infinity   Thank you"
PlayStationPlus,3anb86,armedcombatexpert,7,Thu Jun 25 16:33:50 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that if you beat in in 22 minutes then you didn't see or experience even 5% of what the game has to offer, as a whole. In fact, I'm guessing you equipped an automatic rifle of some kind and just Rambo'd your way through.  People can Speedrun Dark Souls in less than half an hour too. Doesn't mean you have to.  Personally, I probably spent about 30 minutes standing on the rocks, admiring the weather effects, reccying the compound and checking out my shiny new idroid and other gadgets, before I even made my way in.   I dunno..this post just comes across as a bit 'spoiled brat'...ish, to me."
PlayStationPlus,3anb86,Kelter_Skelter,-2,Wed Jun 24 03:31:16 2015 UTC,All the other missions are the same map though.

PlayStationPlus,3anb86,fil345,-3,Fri Jun 26 05:57:01 2015 UTC,"Well, it wouldnt really be the same mission, then."
PlayStationPlus,3anb86,ArrVeePee,-4,Fri Jun 26 08:09:38 2015 UTC,"That way, you can be DarkSouls staring at the death screen for hours and say that it is insane how long the game is."
PlayStationPlus,3anb86,maxwellmaxwell,2,Wed Jun 24 05:14:25 2015 UTC,"Well, you can't. Because the death screen lasts about 5 seconds. You'd have to die 720 times for just one hour. And that's just a really silly comparison to make.  And that's not my point, anyway. OP is claiming the game is ""awful"" on the sole basis of the time it takes to 'complete' it, when he/she clearly hasn't completed it. They just 'got to the end'"

PlayStationPlus,3anb86,DaxterAttano,2,Thu Jun 25 03:06:51 2015 UTC,"The game was about 15 or 20 bucks when it released, the packaging never lied about being anything but an extended teaser, and you just got it for free..."

PlayStationPlus,3anb86,ThatAnnoyingLad,7,Mon Jun 22 07:55:15 2015 UTC,"See, this is correct. It's not wrong to say the game is short, but what IS wrong is to immediately associate the game being short with being shit."
PlayStationPlus,3anb86,OmegaSol,-7,Mon Jun 22 13:47:02 2015 UTC,"the game has absolutely no valid justification to be priced at all, its a demo, its not even a prelude, its even shorter than the virtuous mission on MGS3.

Try some of the side missions, yeah it's the same place, but there are different patrols, etc. that make it fun. For what it is, it's much better than a lot of AAA games that come out now a days, give me a choice between Assassin's Creed Unity (filled with a bunch of bugs) or this and I'd take Ground Zeroes any day. Besides you shouldn't complain, you did get it for free and didn't have to pay for it."
PlayStationPlus,3anb86,Ohliuf,2,Mon Jun 22 02:55:24 2015 UTC,Listening to all of the audio tapes and trying to get through the main mission without being spotted had me spending at least 10 hours.

PlayStationPlus,3anb86,Johnny_Is_Truant,-10,Fri Jun 26 05:59:06 2015 UTC,20 hours into this? Are you a die hard MSG fan or something because I really can't see how can someone put so much time in a game that literally has 10mins of gameplay in it.
PlayStationPlus,3anb86,SIRTreehugger,7,Mon Jun 22 07:00:44 2015 UTC,"There's actually a ton to do in the game if you just look for it. It's the perfect engine for just fucking about in, trying new things and all that. It was the same with the MGS 2 demo that was released with ZOE, people put a buggerload of hours into it just because there were so many ways to approach each situation. Ground Zeroes has even more than that."
PlayStationPlus,3anb86,dennisisspiderman,3,Mon Jun 22 09:34:36 2015 UTC,I put about 30 hours into it myself. Replaying each mission trying to beat time. I swear I spent 3-4 hours just on the Rescue Hostage Mission trying to do it nonlethal. I kept missing my shots from the heli.

Also it was just a filler title to tell events before MGSV and yes it was short. The only thing people complained about it was it's price for 40$. Just be happy you played it for free and didn't have any interest into buying it. But the game was good, you could have had a bit longer experience with it but if you're saying it's bad because it's short then I don't know if that would be the right word unless you hated the controls or anything else.

Thats why devs keep throwing shit with glitter, because they know, out there, its an army of brainless consumerist buying on sight whatever they trhow to them.  Thats why we have anual COD's and Ass Creeds, thats why we still have preorders, preorder bonuses, microtransactions, unfinished games that require 40gbs patches, etc etc.  Its because, most gamers, it doesnt matter if they are old or young, most gamers are just fanboys, blind fanboys, walking wallets.  I bought MGS ground zeroes on 12 bucks, I still regret it. Dont get me wrong, I love MGS, all of em. Ive played all the canon games, even MG1 and MG2, but Ground zeroes its just not worthy.

My kid is 10, but I prefer to do my own parenting, not rely on Sony to decide for me what is appropriate for my kid.  And the reason I want to purchase via the web is so that the games are tied to the account in the future when he might be able to play them.  I don't want to buy and accidentally download a M rated game because I had to log into his PS4 to do it."
PlayStationPlus,3aesk1,ZToups,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:58:07 2015 UTC,Probably a bug with it being a sub-account.
PlayStationPlus,3a79yc,rehman2009,14,Wed Jun 17 19:58:12 2015 UTC,"I swear, I hate these ""deals"". They used to be a little more reasonable in giving you $10 back for every $50 you spend or adding to your wallet. That's what I hate most about this version. You can't even store up some money, it has to have been spent."
PlayStationPlus,3a79yc,SiriusC,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:01:45 2015 UTC,"You can't even store up some money, it has to have been spent.   I don't ever remember them allowing you to just store money into your account."
PlayStationPlus,3a79yc,powercorruption,8,Wed Jun 17 23:50:32 2015 UTC,They had 1-2 of these cash backs for adding $50 from PayPal to your wallet in the past
PlayStationPlus,3a79yc,ZToups,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:10:52 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. Luckily I know I'll be getting MGSV no matter what, so I'll go ahead and preorder that. Got the Driveclub Season Pass finally.  So I just need to find somewhere to spend $15.  But I'm like you--there's nothing I particularly want."
PlayStationPlus,3a79yc,Tralfamadore64,4,Thu Jun 18 15:31:35 2015 UTC,"If you have the Sony credit card, don't you get $10 in points every time you spend $100? This deal would technically give you 25% back then, right? (assuming you had the card)"
PlayStationPlus,3a79yc,asdfweskr,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:51:54 2015 UTC,Is it $10 for every $100? I can't find how much you actually get anywhere on their sign up pages.

PlayStationPlus,3a79yc,IceBreak,2,Thu Jun 18 02:03:44 2015 UTC,can it include preorders?
PlayStationPlus,3a79yc,ApolloIntheSky,2,Thu Jun 18 01:05:26 2015 UTC,I believe it does since you can't cancel a digital pre-order.
PlayStationPlus,3a79yc,jdwyer2009,2,Thu Jun 18 01:33:07 2015 UTC,Perfect for anyone wanting to buy Arkham Knight + Season Pass.
PlayStationPlus,3a79yc,heyenikin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:22:30 2015 UTC,Saw this on another subreddit and thought it should be posted here also. Not sure what countries this is valid for since it says SEN offerings vary by country.
PlayStationPlus,3a79yc,Chowdaire,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:59:09 2015 UTC,It's sort of strange how they left Canada out of the terms & conditions.
PlayStationPlus,3a79yc,Accophox,2,Thu Jun 18 03:24:58 2015 UTC,"Well... Canada has it's own storefront in Canadian dollars. Be sorta silly to give $15 USD back, eh? ;p  That being said... I've found, 7 times in 10, it's cheaper to buy off Amazon.ca and deal with the trouble of switching discs as needed. When a physical good is cheaper than its digital counterpart... there's something wrong with the equation; this is why I've yet to commit to being fully digital on a console. :/"
PlayStationPlus,3a79yc,Decyde,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:31:36 2015 UTC,"This is a great deal.  Get a couple of $40, $50 cards from Best Buy if that deal is still going on and get a couple years of PSN+ or whatever else you want.    I did this last time and spent $80 to get $15 back.  It was well worth it because I ended up spending $25 on the flash sale that followed."

PlayStationPlus,3a2kal,Mr_Dove,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:45:02 2015 UTC,Diablo and Stick of Truth both look great to me.  It's hard to justify them when I have so many other unplayed games though.
PlayStationPlus,3a2kal,Quikemex,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:52:11 2015 UTC,The last of is just for $19.99! GET IT FOLKS! its a new price its not sale!
PlayStationPlus,3a2kal,Teh_akod,0,Thu Jun 18 07:11:24 2015 UTC,Excellent price for one of the best games on PS3.

PlayStationPlus,3a2kal,frozengash,2,Tue Jun 16 23:24:03 2015 UTC,Many of the prices have been lower in the past couple weeks.  Many of the games have been free PS+ games recently.
PlayStationPlus,3a2kal,Pizentu,0,Fri Jun 19 05:59:40 2015 UTC,"Im 30 cents short of the Tomb Raider Definitive edition price. I enjoyed it on PS3 but not enough to pay $30+ on it. 12 bucks made me wanna jump on it quick. Then saw my wallet only has $11.70. There are many deals I would consider quite good, but wont have the money till the sale is over. Seems to always happen that way. Oh well. They will all eventually drop price at some point."

PlayStationPlus,3a0bw4,FabulousKilljoy,14,Tue Jun 16 05:57:58 2015 UTC,w...what the heck...how did you get so many? also I thought trials don't stack
PlayStationPlus,3a0bw4,sony4life,12,Tue Jun 16 06:31:17 2015 UTC,The reps at the e3 event gave them to me. Only about 15 people showed up to the theatre at the experience dealy.
PlayStationPlus,3a0bw4,rehman2009,3,Tue Jun 16 06:57:25 2015 UTC,Nice dude! Dang I should've went :(
PlayStationPlus,3a0bw4,TheWhiteeKnight,-1,Tue Jun 16 07:07:23 2015 UTC,"They don't, but they don't really need to when you can just activate another one once the previous ends. And he either works at a store that has plenty of these in stock, or stole them. I wouldn't be surprised about either, the last gamestop I worked at, used to open all the new games (since they were too cheap to buy a display cabinet and refused to not display the cases, so they had to remove the discs to prevent them from being stolen), and most, if not all of the in-game codes, would either be stolen by the employees, or stupidly left in the empty case on the shelf for any schmuck to walk in off the streets and activate over their phone."
PlayStationPlus,3a0bw4,Thnito_Kyrios,14,Tue Jun 16 06:38:40 2015 UTC,"These codes definitely stacked. I entered 13 and my ps+ license was extended by 13 weeks under the ""licenses"" section of my account management."
PlayStationPlus,3a0bw4,Thnito_Kyrios,8,Tue Jun 16 06:56:01 2015 UTC,"Also, they were freebies at the sony e3 experience dealy. Almost nobody showed up to the event so the rep handed me a giant stack."
PlayStationPlus,3a0bw4,Tyler2Tall,7,Tue Jun 16 06:58:24 2015 UTC,Should have asked for two stacks! And said how handsome the rep looks. 60% of the time - it works for me every time.

PlayStationPlus,3a0bw4,LogicalFlakes,2,Tue Jun 16 17:33:11 2015 UTC,Shit I remember when Netflix accidentally have away stackable 1-Month codes of Xbox Live. It was a bummer when my then maxed out account ran out.
PlayStationPlus,3a0bw4,hSix-Kenophobia,4,Wed Jun 17 00:41:20 2015 UTC,"my understanding is that even if you let it expire, the system knows you've had PS+ in the past and won't let you redeem the next code."
PlayStationPlus,3a0bw4,LogicalFlakes,9,Tue Jun 16 06:41:18 2015 UTC,That is the case for some trials. These just act like 7 day cards.

PlayStationPlus,3a0bw4,FireworkFuse,-18,Tue Jun 16 19:26:27 2015 UTC,But the effort of typing in all those codes for a week's worth of time... aren't we talking at least a few hours of work for less than a year's worth? I'd just pay the $40 Best Buy is selling a year for right now.
PlayStationPlus,3a0bw4,bxnyjoey225,17,Tue Jun 16 14:02:14 2015 UTC,It took me literally less than 5 minutes to add 3 months of time. That's about 15 for a year. That's about $160 an hour to type in codes.
PlayStationPlus,39zfw0,rehman2009,10,Tue Jun 16 01:05:47 2015 UTC,Not really a Plus thing I don't think and I'm not sure how long it has been free. I just saw this posted on another subreddit.   Does anyone know if it has been free for a while or is it pretty new (being free)?

PlayStationPlus,39fza3,horoblast,7,Thu Jun 11 18:22:15 2015 UTC,I'm not cutting them any slack its been 2 years and counting to release that edition. Well before it sounded more like a full game for plus but now it's the Plus edition.

PlayStationPlus,39fza3,Maximelene,5,Fri Jun 12 12:02:12 2015 UTC,Supposedly it originally had something to do with the servers not being able to hold the flood of all the PS plus subs....but that was a long time ago. You think it'd be easy to fix some servers.
PlayStationPlus,39fza3,jakedasnake173,3,Thu Jun 11 22:54:26 2015 UTC,"It's not a matter of ""fixing some servers"", it's a matter of reengineering the multiplayer portion of the game to scale better with large numbers of people."
PlayStationPlus,39fza3,SiriusC,3,Fri Jun 12 11:22:13 2015 UTC,"I'd love an explanation as to why they even need to develop anything at all. They told us it was a server issue, not a development issue."
PlayStationPlus,39fza3,WeWereInfinite,3,Thu Jun 11 23:11:40 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the game has server issues right down to the coding. It was badly designed from the beginning and the game itself simply couldn't cope with the traffic from players regardless of the servers, so the developers have had to go back and rebuild some of the code from the ground up."
PlayStationPlus,39fza3,Poor_Hobo,2,Fri Jun 12 09:30:39 2015 UTC,I am curious as well.
PlayStationPlus,39fza3,Dicethrower,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:48:19 2015 UTC,"If I can take a guess, the game always worked fine, but the server cost were higher than expected. Most likely if they catered to all the free players, the company would go bankrupt on server cost alone. They probably had to optimize or refactor, test the shit out of it, etc. I can't imagine what else justifies a year delay other than a fundamental technical flaw in the game that had to be reworked, especially if the paying players are doing just fine. It has to be something back-end related that doesn't scale very well the more players hook on to it."
PlayStationPlus,39fza3,TheGallifreyan,36,Fri Jun 12 04:47:03 2015 UTC,I think they're strategy is to wait till interest is so low that the servers can handle the load.

PlayStationPlus,39fza3,zeress1,6,Thu Jun 11 19:18:02 2015 UTC,1/4?.. But seriously this thing is a demo that they are giving us.
PlayStationPlus,39fza3,Latinola1,6,Thu Jun 11 23:01:23 2015 UTC,"Yup, def. a demo touted as a feature of PS+."
PlayStationPlus,39fza3,Issune91,2,Thu Jun 11 23:12:39 2015 UTC,Sad part of all of this is that I got my PS4 and ps plus in the release days since I believe the words and news about it being a free instant full game back in the day.

PlayStationPlus,39fza3,Apache15,4,Thu Jun 11 17:02:19 2015 UTC,I bought the game a few months ago and frankly it’s a good game. It’s too bad they made some bad decisions with the PS+version. What they should have done is to release the PS+ version anyway a year ago with the multiplayer disabled but a few more offline races unlocked to compensate. By delaying the ps+ version they just pissed off a lot of potential buyers.
PlayStationPlus,39fza3,Pstrnil,7,Sat Jun 13 19:02:54 2015 UTC,"This is great news for the three people who still care. Everyone else has either bought the full version of the game, or moved on to other more interesting things"

It's not like they're giving everyone who has a PS4 5 years of plus.  Anyway, PS3 (and x360) have started to be called last gen for a little while now, and rightly so. If you want to stick with them for now, as a lot of people seem to be, then that's fair enough. But this isn't the first time last gen consoles are going to be cut out of something and it's only going to get worse as time passes.

Look, I see where you're coming from when you feel happy with the selection of games PS+ has to offer (I for one am very pleased with it), but you can't deny that it's var from diverse enough.  There are other people out there who also pay for the service, and are also looking forward to new games to play. It's fully understandable that some of them might be a tad upset after receiving bazillion of the same genre or theme that they specifically don't enjoy, or perhaps have played enough of.

Since people like to use Plus as a service where they try free games that they wouldn't have purchased in the first place.... why not throw these genres on there. Same goes to other genres that aren't wildly popular.

Read it somewhere and it worked on ps3. Also I tried it out on ps4 but I didn't download anything because I didn't have any games I wanted to share at the time, but I could access the library. If the profile is removed all games are locked."

PlayStationPlus,39471g,pappapidanha,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:21:31 2015 UTC,"Nop, you can:  1- set up that new ps4 you'll have as his primary, when its like that anyone/ any account can play those games without problem.  2- Or don't, set up as secondary, and the only way to download/play/update his games would be to sign in as him, and you can play the games as long as you are logged in like him (he can turn on his ps4, join automatically and that will kick you out of the login session) and only on his account you can be able to play those games...  This will work same with the games he owns"
PlayStationPlus,390qiy,zincdreams,18,Mon Jun 8 12:06:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much you hate the game.  Active hate: remove as soon as you can.  Passive hate: Give it 20 minutes.  Meh: An hour?

PlayStationPlus,390qiy,phessler,6,Mon Jun 8 12:16:10 2015 UTC,"Depends on the type of game.   If it's an extensive RPG that has your doubts in the tutorial, I'd try and stay until you arrive a bit past the tutorial.   For a small indie side-scrolling game, the first hour is usually an indicator for the meat and bones of the whole game. If the combat, story or movement is not to your liking, I'd say it's justifiable to quit and move on.   Overall, don't feel obliged to stick to games you don't enjoy. Not every game is for everyone."

At the end of the day all that matters is that you feel you used your time to your liking.

I think the only exception is Unfinished Swan - the combination of first person view, camera controls, & bright white levels made my feel physically ill, but by the time I realised that I was far enough into the game that I refused to let it defeat me & kept going."

The thing about Plus is that as long as there is one good game on PS4, it will be alright. Even if it sucks that one of the games were bad I still feel it was necessary for them to add it there just to let us try it out. They don't necessarily know what we like and everyone has a different opinion or interest. So if you don't really like a game, maybe someone else does. How can Playstation know that you will like it or not?"

If you get two full retail games, it becomes a great value. If you get any amount of games that you have fun with, it is worthwhile. Even if you get some that don't interest you, you at least have the option to try something that you normally wouldn't pay for or buy yourself.

PlayStationPlus,38ok14,llamateizer,0,Mon Jun 8 02:07:23 2015 UTC,What keeps you going..? I tried it once and after a dozen deaths before even killing a boss(there are bosses..right..?) I got so bored and frustrated that I stopped.
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,likebau5,5,Sat Jun 6 13:46:33 2015 UTC,"Rogue Legacy is like the opposite of instant gratification. You should expect to die, a lot, and make very little notable progress from run to run, because the odds are massively stacked against you.  But with each death you'll be able to level up your character a little bit, and level up your real-world play skills too, from learning about the environment and your adversaries.  If you just keep playing and leveling up, then eventually the first boss will be little but a memory.  And around that time you'll probably find that you're woefully unprepared to face the second boss, not to mention everything that comes after that.  And honestly, you're either going to love this style of gameplay or hate it. Rogue Legacy's novelty lies primarily in the fact that most games don't expect this of you.  A game developer could take any instant-gratification action/platform title that gives players all the in-game tools they need to succeed on their first run, and change it so that the main character sucks horribly but learns to suck slightly less over time, and then there'd be dozens or hundreds of games like Rogue Legacy. But because they haven't, Rogue Legacy stands out from the pack, for whatever that's worth to you."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,infinitelives,0,Sun Jun 7 02:40:07 2015 UTC,"Beating the bosses, only to unlock a harder version, and after that, beating them unlocks a near impossible skill based boss! Mind you, that the last ones you fight, are with skill ready characters."

The whole thing works on economy of scale, i.e. sony being able to plop down a large payment that is actually a small payment per subscriber combined with publishers promoting upcoming content, hoping for dlc sales, reviving multiplayer and/or getting one last revenue stream of a game.    This system flat out does not work by here's 30 bucks go on a shopping spree, at that point, the publisher is going to want their usual cut, assuredly somewhere around 70 percent.  You guys are really naive or ignorant and so that creates your bat shit crazy reactions when your 4.33 a month doesn't yield 30 bucks worth of content you want (me too heavily publicized AAA online shooter game).  Those games cost 20-100 million bucks to make and advertise, they aren't going to give them to you for 4.33/6 minus sony's 50 percent or more profit taking."

However, I just want to point out that the whole economics argument doesn't work because Sony were doing exactly this for years."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,CurbedEnthusiasm,5,Sat Jun 6 02:53:16 2015 UTC,"Most of the AAA games that were put out on ps3 ps+ were sitting at the bottom of bargain bins for 5-10 bucks due to being old; ironically, they were often cheaper to buy at the time of being given away than most of the indie titles we get."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,naylord,7,Sat Jun 6 07:35:13 2015 UTC,"I'm sure many were, but the perception was what I think mattered back then. Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider, Need for Speed, Spec Ops, Uncharted 3...these were the kinds of titles that really made the service amazing. Now...not as much."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,CurbedEnthusiasm,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:44:04 2015 UTC,"I can see how a lot of people would enjoy it more then; for me it was much more often the case that games were put on that I either bought or borrowed from friends (or had a friend that I could just borrow it from).  Now that I have a ps4,vita and ps3 the service has never felt like it is providing me with more value."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,naylord,2,Sat Jun 6 07:46:54 2015 UTC,"Yep I still enjoy the service as well, and there's a lot of games I'd never have bought that I enjoyed, however, I think it would be better as one big title for each console each month."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,CurbedEnthusiasm,1 point,Sat Jun 6 08:06:29 2015 UTC,"That was only for the last 2 years, before that we hardly got AAA, and anyway, back then PS+ didn't have so many subscribers, so developers wold make deals easier considering not everyone would get their games for free."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,DrYaguar,0,Sat Jun 6 09:44:11 2015 UTC,"Many of the AAA PS3 titles were well timed releases to promote upcoming sequels. Many others were just 5 years old and were no longer making money anymore. If you go back and look at the timing of the releases, you'll find very few titles that were relatively current, selling for a higher priced, and not promoting a sequel."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,junkit33,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:49:44 2015 UTC,This post needs to have its own thread. Or someone from Sony needs to come here and explain the economics of Plus. Fantastic post.
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,icon365,-5,Sat Jun 6 11:06:54 2015 UTC,"Sony might see some value in giving subscribers a $30 shopping spree each month if possible. First, it is clearly a good deal for anyone considering signing up, but most importantly, it'd create value for those already subscribed and reduce the likelihood of them cancelling their subscriptions in the future. My PS+ library is huge as I've been subscribed for a long time. Paying $50 next year to renew and retain access to my $500+ library of games (not to mention the other features of PS+) is a no brainer.  Customer retention is a highly important long-term investment."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,humanmanguy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:23:54 2015 UTC,"You have misunderstood. I never said they should do anything, all I said was that you shouldn't overlook the possibility that Sony would be willing to lose money in the short term to increase customer retention."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,humanmanguy,22,Sat Jun 6 18:25:59 2015 UTC,"Eh, I kinda like having them choose.  Gets me to play stuff I wouldn't normally."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,KittenRaffle,35,Sat Jun 6 19:32:56 2015 UTC,"I'd love a middle ground - 'here's 12 games, pick 4 that interest you' sort of deal."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Romiress,24,Fri Jun 5 18:44:06 2015 UTC,"I would love to see that happen but i think it would take a tremendous effort from the playstation plus team at sony, they would have to make 12 contracts each month with the publishers. Thats double the effort."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Romiress,6,Fri Jun 5 15:55:28 2015 UTC,"Eh, I could see them getting away with it by occasionally doubling up. You could have the same game appear twice (or even three times if it's really popular)."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,chinese_medicine,-4,Fri Jun 5 16:18:02 2015 UTC,Your idea still makes a lot less sense than the one you're criticizing.  Edit: If you're going to downvote explain how the original idea would work in a place that resembles reality.
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,JT-Lionheart,2,Fri Jun 5 16:19:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah too many contracts like the other guy said. They probably end up rehashing the same games over and over because getting more games for it will end up costing more. They don't necessarily choose the games so to speak, they kinda get what they can get. Would be fun to choose though but in the end, you'll get all those games for free with the illusion of deciding what to pick.   ""Here's 12 games choose 4"", all those games will be the same exact games we already get so not sure if I see the point behind the ability of choosing. Choose 4 games each month but the way it is now you get 6 games each month.   By picking 4 do you mean people vote to what games they would like to see on Plus?"
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Romiress,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:49:45 2015 UTC,"I mean, there's 12 games, and you pick which 4 you want. Maybe 4 a month would be repeats from the previous months - wouldn't be that much more than what they have, and more open ended because it wouldn't have to be just two of each."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:40:25 2015 UTC,"Still don't see how that differs from now. It might make some sense if people were to vote than to choose the game they want right on Plus day when the game are out that way they don't have to spend money on getting all 12 games which few are the least likely to be chosen by people. I think you mean by actually voting for the games on Plus is what you mean, because having to choose the game from the store on Plus day with a selection of 12 games seems very complicated to pull off even if they were to reuse the games for another month"
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Romiress,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:49:36 2015 UTC,"I definitely don't mean voting, thanks. I am aware of what I mean.  Having people vote on which games would come to plus would not have any advantages over offering 12 games and having people pick which ones they want. Sony couldn't offer people games they didn't already have contracts for."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:50:06 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, then I wonder how that would work. Well all 12 games need contracts for Plus, if people chose 4 games one month, the next month will still have the other 6 games they didn't choose last month as well as new 4 games added to replace the ones they chose, and that process repeats each month. Is that what you mean?"
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Romiress,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:40:09 2015 UTC,"Could be like that. I just meant in general, having some amount of choice would probably ease a lot of the complaints. Right now you just get a grab bag, and there might be a lot of good games... but not ones you care about. Or maybe you only have 1 or 2 of the systems, so you have fewer options."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:34:51 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying it will be hard to pull off. Like, they wont be able to keep the same games for the next month because how will they know you didn't choose that games. Also there can be so much they can spend one month for a couple games. Also what if you want all the games but can only choose 4 like you said?   Why choose the games you want when eventually you are gonna get it soon. And why have the ability to choose when you can't have them all but with how it is you get them all anyways."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,NotReallyASnake,8,Sun Jun 7 00:36:40 2015 UTC,I want to live in the world of magic where everything is free and everyone loves me.
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,BARDLER,9,Mon Jun 8 07:18:59 2015 UTC,"So what are you are asking is for Sony to turn your $50 a year, into a potential $360 a year. That would not be a smart business model for them."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Greenjuggleguy,5,Fri Jun 5 23:47:31 2015 UTC,They already give out like $1000 worth of games with PS+ each year..
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,BARDLER,5,Fri Jun 5 18:53:25 2015 UTC,"They work with the developers and publishers of those games to cut them a certain amount of money in order to have their game be part of PSN+. If they were to allow you to just pick any game for free under $30 in the store Sony would have to eat the cost to pay the chunk that the developer/publishers are owed. Sony set up PSN+ to make them money, and they would lose a ton of money if they did it that way."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Shadybob91,10,Fri Jun 5 19:25:54 2015 UTC,on games that people probably wouldn't have bought/played otherwise
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,bellbel,-12,Fri Jun 5 21:44:42 2015 UTC,"They dont give out anything, and I wish people would stop saying this.  You are ALLOWED to RENT ~$1000 worth of games of SONY'S CHOOSING, ONLY as long as you keep your SUBSCRIPTION current, COSTING approx $50 a year IF you PAY for the year IN ADVANCE.  Sony is giving you nothing. You are allowed to rent what Sony says you can rent as long as you keep a stream of money flowing into Sony's pockets. That is all. You dont own the titles, you are allowed to borrow them for a set amount of time, for a set amount of money."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,ronzon775,6,Fri Jun 5 20:44:51 2015 UTC,How about games from playstation now ? I think they should give a game for free on ps now for that one month for free
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Dropofr3d,9,Fri Jun 5 22:24:13 2015 UTC,"its not available world wide like ps plus, and ps now is a subscription in its own, it would get confusing meshing both subs together.   Lets not forget how awful sony's servers can get."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,JT-Lionheart,3,Fri Jun 5 15:52:32 2015 UTC,"ps now isn't a subscription. it just has the option to subscribe, but the subscription only gives you access to about 1/2 the games on ps now. Aside from it not being worldwide, I think it's a really good idea that could potentially get more people interested in ps now."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,SmokinDynamite,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:57:10 2015 UTC,"Well that's the thing, nothing about PS Now is free... I don't even think it has a function to make a game free. It doesn't even have an option to buy it. Only rent. I think the idea was great only because it was a chance we be able to buy PS3 games on the PS4, apparently not. I just saw the pre order bonus on the PS Store for God of War 3 remastered. Pre ordering on the store gives you 90 days access to God of War 2 in PS Now."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,BeriAlpha,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:35:46 2015 UTC,It has the option to make a game free. You have a subscription option which makes some of the games turn free.
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,crunrun,5,Sat Jun 6 00:31:10 2015 UTC,"6 random, definitely."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,pir8pat,2,Mon Jun 8 03:06:04 2015 UTC,"While I think most people would like to choose a game, I think that idea is missing the point of PS+. PS+ only functions on games people aren't buying as much as they were when they came out. There's plenty of great games that fly under the radar or have had their heyday and don't project many sales anymore since most of their market has been tapped. Only games given under these conditions will benefit the publishers, Sony, and the players."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,jacobi123,2,Fri Jun 5 21:08:41 2015 UTC,"I prefer random. Basically if I want to play a game bad enough I'll buy it or rent it.  Having a random assortment of games gives me the opportunity to try games in genres I don't pay attention to and exposes me to games that flew under my radar. Also on a less tangible note I like the surprise each month of the random games.  For me its like opening a pack of trading cards,  will I find that super rare gem,  a solid pick, something I own,  or junk. All in all I think I get my yearly value in solid games and surprise gems even when several months don't do anything for me. I view my value in yearly increments."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Rinaldootje,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"I love your trading card analogy as its really apt. It's fun to do the ""what are we getting this month"" game. Also, the games are usually ones I would never seek out and buy, but usually at least one of the curated  games is a hit for me, if not more.   I love the system just the way it is."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,smacksaw,2,Fri Jun 5 21:52:53 2015 UTC,Let them decide. For me its a great way to get some great games each month. Without actually ever considering to buy them
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Kurtis2202,2,Sat Jun 6 17:09:42 2015 UTC,Curated games are interesting.  Go with the flow. Let it happen.
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Willeth,2,Sat Jun 6 00:30:15 2015 UTC,"Six random please. I get at least one game every month that I would've wanted to buy, and I discover loads of other stuff I like but wouldn't necessarily have thought to buy."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,wielku,2,Sat Jun 6 04:11:02 2015 UTC,The curated selection. I get access to so many games I wouldn't otherwise.
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,iWatern,2,Sat Jun 6 08:12:22 2015 UTC,Nah I rather have 6 shitty games that I can pick from than 1 game I chose that I can get bored with and nothing for the rest of the month
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,DangassDanger,2,Sat Jun 6 08:18:54 2015 UTC,"I like their current model, it's just that the selection seems to be very weak on average for PS4. I've had PS+ for 9 months now and only downloaded 4 or 5 games. Then again, some of the games that don't appeal at all to me like Guacamelee or Valiant Hearts constantly get praised on here - it is hard to cater to everyone.   I think they'll get a much better feedback as soon as they start to recycle old 40€ titles or very old 70€ titles. I know I would have been much more grateful if I had a PS3 in the same period and played games like Sherlock Holmes, Thief, Hitman, etc."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Dracaras,2,Sat Jun 6 10:52:37 2015 UTC,Definitely the 1.
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Hillbillyjacob,2,Sun Jun 7 16:59:21 2015 UTC,"Of course 1 game i pick. I would actually benefit from ""instant game collection"" I would have never subscribed if not for multiplayer. Had ps3 since launch never even thought of getting ps plus."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,terrSC,2,Sun Jun 7 21:10:39 2015 UTC,Yeah that's not the way this business would ever work. Dumb idea.
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,johnymyko,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:53:31 2015 UTC,I would rather pick one for sure.
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Eblan85,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:59:22 2015 UTC,"As someone who only has a PS3, looking to what games they gave for PS3 the last year and a half and comparing them to the old PS Plus catalog, I would completely prefer to pick just one game I wanted."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,SIRTreehugger,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:38:05 2015 UTC,"I love my random games. Thanks to that I got to play Transistor and Rogue Legacy. I do wish we could choose/trade a game they previously gave away because I only have a ps4. But really, Im very happy with my free games."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,WildBizzy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:00:18 2015 UTC,I don't know...I mean some months I would definitely choose 1 game....other times they have 3-4 games I enjoy. If I could alternate between the two choices that would be great. This month for example I would rather have just one game. Previous month I would have taken the 6 games even though I only liked 3 of them.
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,MFTWrecks,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:44:27 2015 UTC,"Definitely one of my choosing. The last game I was particularly happy with as a free game was Infamous: First Light and that was forever ago.  If it weren't for the fact that I'm a student who can't really afford to buy games often, I wouldn't have put more than 15 minutes into a lot of the plus games"
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,Pyrrolidone,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"That was January. Not exactly ""forever"" but still. That was the last high profile one they built up to. Which is sad 'cause it's a stand alone DLC prequel."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,aids0109,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:08:37 2015 UTC,definitely the 1 game a month.  over the last few month's i've tried all of the games and none of the ive actually liked :(  And if there was a game i did like..guess what.. I've allready bought it a while ago ! :(
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,jacobi123,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:24:16 2015 UTC,I remember reading a post on here about a token system and I quite liked it. It was along the premise of you saved your tokens per month and you could buy specific games using these tokens. You wouldn't be able to get the latest games but ones they've put up for purchase by token.
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,aids0109,0,Fri Jun 5 20:18:46 2015 UTC,I'm curious why one wouldn't just save up and buy a game outright if they wanted this system?
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,heisenbergfan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"I do buy games regularly and use PS+ to access the online. Because I prefer cased, physical copies, I have been brought to a few new series by the PS+ system."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,johnymyko,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:11:00 2015 UTC,"I'd definetly like to pick 1 that i want per month, specially since i only have a ps3 so most of the games are useless to me until i buy a ps4 in the future.  Last game i was happy with was Dishonored. That's one game in 4 months. That's 1/3rd of my subscription for one good game, i'm not even sure i'll re-sub when mine ends, im already trying to clean my catalog of ps+ games from the past, if i renew it'll probably be to finish old games as i can't be counting on new games coming anymore (the ps3 offers have been so average lately)"

PlayStationPlus,38ok14,wasabipeaz,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:13:36 2015 UTC,I would like to have the option. See the lineup of the 6 games and if i already have them or I'm not interested in them then I'd want to pick the one free game of my choice.
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,TheOneTrueChuck,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:58:51 2015 UTC,"I would pick as well. Even if they went in the middle, say, here are 10 games and you can choose one per system (or just one in general.)  I used to agree that having the random ones would broaden my tastes in games, but this whole year has been pretty bad. It's worse now that they took away the Instant game pool that used to refresh in June."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,corruptheretic,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:26:53 2015 UTC,"I'd rather just pick one, even at a $30 or $40 capped value. I have limited time, and virtually never play online with strangers.  I know precisely what games will appeal to me as a rule. The vast majority of games that have been offered for free don't even remotely appeal to me. I literally either don't play them, or I play them for under an hour, and then say ""meh"".  Since getting my PS4, I haven't bothered to pay for Plus, having let my subscription run out months previously. The PS4 hasn't had a single Plus title that I find even remotely attractive.  As a rule, I only play RPG's/SRPG's and American sports titles, along with the occasional action game. No platformers, no shooters...aside from Borderlands.  It's not about ""broadening my horizons""..I know that I don't enjoy most fighting games, detest modern warfare shooters, and hate anything that calls itself a platformer.  My time's at a premium, so PS+ doesn't really offer much value for me.  That being said, I can't picture them changing their formula."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,lfc80,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:17:37 2015 UTC,Pick 1. I game that I really want each month is better than 6 that I won't ever play.

So say Sony gets 30 percent or so like most of the app stores.  Sony owes the publisher 21 bucks, you pay 4.33 a month.  So, Sony is now losing 16.67 a month.  It's a great scheme.  Hopefully you'll be in charge of Porsche+ in the future"
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,tbx5959,-1,Fri Jun 5 18:58:46 2015 UTC,"How can you even do math like that, ps+ is a rent service, we don't keep the games ""forever"" as we would if we actually bought them."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,heisenbergfan,3,Fri Jun 5 16:58:26 2015 UTC,"because the publisher doesn't give a damn.  You 'rent' their game with Sony's ps+ here's 30 bucks go 'rent'a game voucher they want their cut, they aren't going to say, oh yea, it's the magical ps+ voucher, that's ok, i'll take whatever is left over from that 4.33 a month; no, they are going to say you owe me 21 fucking dollars and if you don't pay me my lawyers will be in contact with yours and my content is going to be pulled.

PlayStationPlus,38ok14,tbx5959,-2,Fri Jun 5 21:20:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how old or how dumb are you.  Of course Sony pay them to have their games on ps+, that doesn't mean they pay the full game price per subscription, that's the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,ItinerantSoldier,5,Sat Jun 6 02:00:19 2015 UTC,"i didn't say they did.  That's the whole point, the reason they get these games is economy of scale - they pay a lump sum to get games cheap.  That's exactly why you can't say here's 30 bucks go buy a fucking game like this dumb thread says.  If that were the case then the goddamn publisher would want their full cut."
PlayStationPlus,38ok14,thorlord,0,Sat Jun 6 02:01:42 2015 UTC,The middle ground that /u/Romiress mentioned would be fine or even making it choose one $30 or less full game OR two $15 or less PSN-only games would be fine. The system now is just weird where at least one system gets utterly screwed and sometimes all three do.

Something you did prevented it or caused an error, but the game does auto save I have seen that it may be every 40 levels.  I have played through a decent amount of the game on PC and never had any issues with saves nor did I manually save."
PlayStationPlus,38ht58,Bangcrashboom,3,Fri Jun 5 01:18:23 2015 UTC,It saves on every single level in story mode for me. Automatically. Check the settings.

PlayStationPlus,38ew71,captaintrips456,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:21:22 2015 UTC,Back up your save with PS+ to prevent this sort of thing happening again. It's pretty poor design that there's no confirmation or anything. I usually lose interest in games pretty quick if I have to replay a bunch of it due to a lost save.

It has a few rough edges (certain sounds, certain dialogue lines) but I would consider buying the upcoming full game.  The main mission took me 90 minutes and I went very slowly. Even shorter was my introduction to the controls: intro concludes, I have control, promptly accidentally fall off cliff, now hanging on ledge, ""how do you climb up?"", press X, game over. Worst spy ever."

PlayStationPlus,38cyy9,Nade_IL,2,Wed Jun 3 19:40:07 2015 UTC,"Microsoft likes to publish indie games on XBLA in exchange for exclusivity. Eventually many of these Microsoft-published indies get put out on other platforms as well, usually self-published. This is the case here. PSN says Skulls of the Shogun is published by 17-BIT, which is also the developer.  Another game I remember this happening with was FEZ."

PlayStationPlus,38cyy9,Guglio08,4,Tue Jun 30 13:09:35 2015 UTC,Skulls of the shogun is quite a fun little strategy game. Every turn you get a set amount of moves can do to take out enemies. Along the way you can eat the enemies skulls to level your soldiers up. Really enjoyable!
PlayStationPlus,38cyy9,General_Awesome,10,Thu Jun 4 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"I played 45 minutes of Ground Zeroes and it took me a bit to get into the game, it was my first ever Metal Gear. I did however manage after 15 minutes and really enjoyed it. But then it was pretty much already over. Just like that. 45 minutes to beat the game and I took my time.. I know there are side missions but they are in the same area as the main mission. And in a way they are the same objective, either kill X or Y or destroy 3 X or rescue X. You always go from A to B and then exit the area. That's in total 60 minutes of true gameplay value. Pretty poor.  While it is free now, it cost 40(!) bucks at the start, reduced to 30 when there were complaints. Generally I like to get 1 hour of gameplay for every Euro invested so this game should have cost no more than 5 Euros, including several replays. Back in the day you used to get demos and prologues for free or as goodies in a gaming magazine. This is unacceptable. If it had been a PS Plus game from the start, I suppose that would have been alright.. not everyone has Plus, though. The fact that this was on sale for the past year for such an outrageous price is ridiculous.   I'm a sucker for turn based combat and while this isn't traditional JRPG style, Skulls has a nice Xcom feel to it. One of the better indies out there in my eyes and games like this are always welcome! It seems fairly big for an indie too, I've put in a few hours and I don't think I'm halfway through yet. Definitely recommended if you like a little strategy!"
PlayStationPlus,38cyy9,Guglio08,10,Wed Jun 3 18:03:04 2015 UTC,"I'd like to challenge you on Ground Zeroes. I pre-ordered it for PS3, it was $20, and there's an incredible amount of content in that game. A lot of it is never played by people, because they just assume that it's the ""same map.""  The main mission is much easier than the side content. Try playing the daytime missions - they are much more challenging. Try unlocking the Deja Vu mission. Try getting the Gray Fox skin. Try getting S ranks.  Most games generally tell you what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. Ground Zeroes gives you the objective, and that's it. You can escape by leaving the base, by helicopter, by driving a tank or jeep out, or hiding in the back of a truck.   You can play super stealthy, or go guns blazing with your helicopter as backup. Playing it on Hard is even more fun - limited ammo, no silenced carbine, and you have to be really good at hiding.   I think you'd be surprised by the amount of game play you can get out of it, if you really look."

The Gray Fox skin works like Raiden does in the Jamais Via mission - he can sprint really fast. But it's MGS1 Gray Fox, polygons and all."

It's linear with the pre-made missions. It's quite good, but not on the level of Tactics Ogre or Disgaea.   I finished Ground Zeroes in 90 minutes and I feel I sucked. Anyway not as good as MGS4 at all, it felt very generic. The best part were the cinematics, and it makes me scared for Phantom Pain."
PlayStationPlus,38cyy9,pir8pat,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:17:46 2015 UTC,I think for the average person MGS: ground Zeros is not going to be a game they enjoy. For those die hard fans or people that have played the series already this will wet your appetite for Phantom Pain. If you aren't into stealth games I wouldn't recommend this. For the average gamer this game that was way too expensive when it came out is not worth the 1.5-5 hour gameplay they can get out of it. I think a lot of people just like to play the story and don't care for S rank and whatnot.
PlayStationPlus,38cyy9,TomPheysey,0,Thu Jun 4 17:33:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I finished it but I'm not great at it which probably doesn't help but it seemed like a bit of a chore as well, which is weird because I loved MGS 1-3. It has actually put me off buying Phantom Pain."
PlayStationPlus,38cyy9,yanggmd,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:31:49 2015 UTC,"Skulls was good looking and had some humor but it's not really for me.  Mostly because it feels so bare for me as a tactics game. Newcomers will probably not notice though.  As for metal gear I was disappointed and not because of the length.  The ai just pulled me out so much, I'd see the highlighted enemies shooting into a building I was hiding behind and not always following me even when I know they saw me hide around the corner. It all seemed pretty old like they put everything into graphics and nothing into ai."

PlayStationPlus,38b2m5,Thang0,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:53:17 2015 UTC,"It's the smaller game of the series but would say it could be the best one yet possibly. I wouldn't recommend the first game as it's way too dated to even try to play for the first time. Bound By Blood was pretty decent with a full fledged story that did well, but whatever you do, never play The Cartel. The game takes place in a modern day west as cops as already you can tell it's ruined, but it's horrible. Anyways Gunslinger here was great because they really tried pushing towards a more western cowboy game making it more ""spaghetti"" if you know what I mean. Wasn't a serious game like the others but a fun arcade type of game."
PlayStationPlus,38b2m5,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:56:27 2015 UTC,I played it for the first time yesterday and I'm in love. Going to finish the game for sure.
PlayStationPlus,38b2m5,The_King_Of_Nothing,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:23:13 2015 UTC,"CoJ Gunslinger is great! Played it when it first came out! I was a fan of the original game CoJ Bound in Blood, and while the second game wasn't anywhere as good I still enjoyed it. Gunslinger brought it back to the roots and was extremely fun! For anyone that enjoyed this game I implore you to play Call of Juarez Bound in Blood, it's still my favourite of all the games! While the online multiplayer has dwindled to only a few, the story mode was always it's strongest point. For trophy hunters I would recommend playing BIB on a separate account and just enjoying it unless you want to grind hours online with help from others."

PlayStationPlus,38g69g,MulhollandDrive,7,Thu Jun 4 00:15:37 2015 UTC,Alternative: The Sony app on a smart phone has the ability to delete 0% trophy lists from your collection
PlayStationPlus,38g69g,Bangcrashboom,3,Thu Jun 4 01:17:08 2015 UTC,This is really useful. Thank you! Now if there was a way to get rid of all those pesky 1% and 2% games...
PlayStationPlus,38g69g,DramDemon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:44:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel you. The only way to fix them is to finish the game :(  Glad I could help out.  I recently found the method in a different thread somewhere and it helped me clean up a little bit. Raised my completion percentage a whole 3% haha.
PlayStationPlus,38g69g,Bangcrashboom,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:45:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I'll probably go back and try to finish some of them now that I have more time (yay summer!). It's just kind of frustrating to have those games that you didn't really enjoy all too much give you a trophy and then forever be cemented on your list."
PlayStationPlus,38g69g,DramDemon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:35:44 2015 UTC,I know your pain. Just last night I was looking through games I'd like to up my percentage on. It always a shame when you've got those 1 or 2 %s that sucked hard. It also sucks when you realize a game you wanted to finish (army of two 40th day for me) now has unobtainable trophies
PlayStationPlus,38g69g,Bangcrashboom,0,Thu Jun 4 18:05:12 2015 UTC,"Oh god, the unobtainable trophies are such a pain. I personally play mostly sports games (way more than I should, considering most of the great games are non-sports), and there are always those timed trophies you have to get during the season or you're SOL. I always make it a priority to check and see if a game I like has trophies like that so I can try to go after them first, but I usually get caught up in just playing and enjoying the game that I completely forget."
PlayStationPlus,38g69g,DramDemon,2,Thu Jun 4 21:16:03 2015 UTC,"Problem with relying on that method is if a game registers a trophy early on,the ability to delete is now gone."
PlayStationPlus,38g69g,Bangcrashboom,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:43:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. It's particularly frustrating on a game like Deadpool that gives you a trophy for just starting the game  Either way, I just wanted to give others this method that I recently discovered. Helped me get rid of a good 10 or so 0%s"

PlayStationPlus,38g69g,UrbanRedFox,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:52:07 2015 UTC,As stated before this won't work if the game triggers a trophy early on. Some games give you a trophy just for starting the first level

PlayStationPlus,388yoa,blumpkin,3,Wed Jun 3 01:38:36 2015 UTC,I believe Cloudberry Kingdom was part of one of the recent flash sales for 99 cents or so. You probably bought it on a whim and lost track of it among everything else you got at the same time!

And the other one is one of those round up a group of things and attack something else - i kind of like those so i'll play through it.

PlayStationPlus,388yoa,360walkaway,0,Tue Jun 2 18:07:15 2015 UTC,I'm not liking this practice of using brand-new games for the collection. I'd rather have something more established to give some weight to the PS+ lineup. Yes there's Ground Zeroes but aside from that it's been a ton of indies.

PlayStationPlus,38ahnn,AnthonyMimming,20,Tue Jun 2 23:10:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it'll stay 2/2/2 for another year. There's just not enough PS4 titles coming out steadily for them to go up to 3 a month. They already often exceed 3 titles with PSV crossbuy stuff, but not consistently."
PlayStationPlus,38ahnn,Romiress,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:16:05 2015 UTC,There is easily enough titles but I think your right in that they won't phase out PS3 any time soon.  It's gotta be ridiculously cheap to put out PS3 games nowadays.
PlayStationPlus,38ahnn,IceBreak,5,Wed Jun 3 02:01:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking overall titles, just titles that they could realistically put on Plus. Everyone would no doubt love for them to drop Destiny, Witcher, etc... but it's unlikely to happen. Retail games generally go up when they've been out for a while, or when they have a sequel about to come out. If people are complaining about the lack of retail titles now, imagine how much worse it would get with more PS4 titles and less PS3/Vita ones."
PlayStationPlus,38ahnn,Romiress,9,Wed Jun 3 02:42:29 2015 UTC,I don't think this it will happen this year. PS3 is still a strong source of PS+ subscribers and with no need to pay for multiplayer it would be a huge mistake if Sony would lower the number of games for PS3. I would rather see Sony promising a biger game every 3 months on PS4 for example or even expanding the number of games making it 3 games for PS4.

PlayStationPlus,38ahnn,tbx5959,5,Wed Jun 3 04:27:17 2015 UTC,Just out of curiosity - do you personally want that to happen or do you think it is a realistic possibility?
PlayStationPlus,38ahnn,icon365,-9,Tue Jun 2 23:12:38 2015 UTC,"Out of the rumor a week or so ago about the Vita becoming a legacy platform, i see them slowly weaning us off it. And the ps3 is getting old, and the ps4 has sold like 22 million. So i think its realistic they will increase the value for ps4 owners"
PlayStationPlus,38ahnn,Zhiroc,5,Tue Jun 2 23:16:09 2015 UTC,"As much as I like PS+, I think you're kidding yourself if you think it has anything to do about value for customers. It's about revenue, and given the MP lock they have for PS4, there's no reason to entice more people to subscribe than have already, I think. That's why you see very little in the way of PS+ sub sales from the last Black Friday period, and for the PS4, they've said they have no price reductions in sight.  I'd have to say they are making oodles of money as-is, and increasing costs and/or decreasing revenue is just not in the cards, given how the XB1 isn't challenging them much."
PlayStationPlus,38ahnn,j035u5,-3,Wed Jun 3 06:31:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the way i think itll change to; 1/1/3 games, they actually end up dropping from 6 total games to 5 total a month. This obviously will save them money, while the huge i flux of ps4 users will get more value"
PlayStationPlus,38ahnn,glitchs2d,2,Wed Jun 3 07:29:57 2015 UTC,This obviously will save them money   Based on what? I'd assume they can get much cheaper licenses for PSVita games than PS4.

PlayStationPlus,382ifv,chrisnmarie,19,Mon Jun 1 12:55:45 2015 UTC,"Why bother? The base game is almost old enough to just give us that next month. It's owned by sony, so they could totally pull that off."
PlayStationPlus,382ifv,squat251,42,Mon Jun 1 17:31:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it's dead and done now.  They had a nice window of opportunity to get something going before the competition built-up, but missed it.  They burned everyone that bought it around launch, then have effectively thrown all the hype and marketing they did pre-launch out of the window with this huge delay.  I'd be very surprised if they made anything of this now.  I really hope they open up enough of the game to get enough people playing and build some momentum.  I have several friends that haven't bought Project CARS yet, but it seems almost inevitable that they'll crumble within the next few months.  Look at their competition they now have / on the way that they didn't at launch:   GTA V (out now) Project CARS (out now) F1 2015 (next month) Carmageddon Gran Turismo 7 WRC 5 Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo Distance Dirt 4   Plus with VR on the horizon, there are likely more on the way that are unannounced (and probably even more that I don't know about).  Last year at their release there was only a poor NFS game.  They could have built something really great - but just didn't test their software properly.  Such a shame.  Hopefully they have the funds to take the hit and try again.  EDIT: Also, I think there is huge scope for using their engine to make an awesome arcade rally game."
PlayStationPlus,382ifv,vampatori,16,Mon Jun 1 14:28:03 2015 UTC,"Counterpoint - there's a giant assload of users on PS+, and many don't know anything (or care) about the back story drama on Driveclub.  You can already get the game used or on sale for under $40, and by the time the PS+ demo comes out, that number will probably look more like $30.  Sooo... if it really is a solid experience, the PS+ game still has a reasonable chance of selling quite a few full copies to the more casual racing game crowd.  At the very least they'll have a leg up on all of those games.   The only name with huge public cachet in this category is Gran Turismo 7, and last I heard that wasn't coming out until 2017."
PlayStationPlus,382ifv,junkit33,2,Mon Jun 1 16:08:48 2015 UTC,"i know all about the backstory on driveclub. and if they open up they PS plus version i'll STILL play it. even if it's not a perfect experience, it's free. i'm not a huge racer fan, and really like arcade as opposed to sim. but i'll still give it a shot. it looks awesome and i was interested when they presented at e3 2013 (2012?)"
PlayStationPlus,382ifv,docbauies,2,Mon Jun 1 22:27:13 2015 UTC,"It's nothing to do with the drama.. it's a complete lack of momentum, no marketing, and very little word of mouth - in fact most word of mouth is likely to be negative, not positive.  They're going to have to spend a fortune advertising it again, doing the rounds, and so on.. but they're going to get much less coverage this time no matter what they do.  They'll get a short news article on the news web sites, but very few second reviews, and the news will soon be buried.  Games are all about momentum.. people move on to the next thing, they very rarely move back in any meaningful numbers.  There needs to be a real incentive to do so, and so that's what I said.. I really hope they open up enough of the game to get people into it.  But only time will tell.. they'll have to absolutely get the technology right (another failed launch would be a death sentence) then really push it hard, give a lot, and build a community.  They'll have to become the game that everyone plays together, rather than the one that most of you play together (because of the cost of the game).  We'll see.  I hope they do well, but I just don't see it.. I can't think of a single example of a game that's turned it around in a meaningful way that isn't an MMO that's gone F2P."
PlayStationPlus,382ifv,vampatori,4,Mon Jun 1 16:41:11 2015 UTC,"Not sure I understand your argument.  The ""demo"" is going to headline PS+ for a month, which has over 10 million subscribers - what form of marketing is better than that?    It's all about how the game handles the load of PS+ users, which is why they've taken so damn long with it.  They know this is their last shot to avoid the game going down as one of the biggest disasters in gaming history."
PlayStationPlus,382ifv,junkit33,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:45:26 2015 UTC,Part of what I understood from his argument which I see in myself is that people will maybe pick up the demo and play it. But the game having been out now for a good time will be old news with people wanting to try new and better games. In my case I used to wait for a game to go down in price but by then I didn't have that urge to get it as much as the newer version or better similar version of it that just came out.   At least for me Driveclub has crashed and burned. It's a game people may buy once they get shit rolling but not many people will stay on or keep playing it. I have a friend that bought it new and already resold it for the lack of many things.   I had the chance to check it out from my library and it was an ok game and had potential but with the lack of online functionality it seemed incomplete. Maybe they'll have luck with a sequel or launching a new title.
PlayStationPlus,382ifv,Latinola1,-1,Mon Jun 1 19:11:52 2015 UTC,"Tons of marketing is better than that.. TV adverts, months of articles, adverts on all the gaming sites, buzz on social media, review videos, events held at a track, let's plays, etc.  They did all that, at great expense!!  They won't be getting all that this time around.  Look at how games are announced, then a buzz is created about them, then they build it up and up until launch which should hit the absolute peak to maximise sales.  Then they use reviews, videos, TV, etc. to really push it hard at that peak.  Sony are only likely to be pushing it so hard on PS+ because it's an exclusive and therefore represents a form of investment, and is an embarrassment for them right now (as it reflects badly on the PS+ service, and therefore the PS4 as a whole).  But on top of all this.. it's fundamentally not a great game.  It's just average to good, and was widely reviewed as such.  Its main redeeming feature being that you could play online with friends completely for free has yet to materialize.  The point is that it wouldn't matter if it was an average game if on day one everyone could get together and have fun online.  It could have been great.. a free racer better than anything else on the console at that moment.  But now that's not the case... there are better racing games, there are more fun racing games, and there's a ton more coming out.  So the player-base is fragmented.  That's the beginning of the end for any online game unless they can do something to bring it back.  Just releasing the game as intended is not enough.  They have to go above and beyond to draw attention and get people back.  Will they?  Who knows.  Only time will tell.. I'll be more than happy for you to say ""I told you so"" to me in six months, but I seriously doubt that will be the case."
PlayStationPlus,382ifv,vampatori,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:35:02 2015 UTC,"Sooo... if it really is a solid experience, the PS+ game still has a reasonable chance of selling quite a few full copies to the more casual racing game crowd.    But it's already been established that it's not a solid experience.  I still want Sony to make good on their promises, but I choose not to support this game on moral grounds.  Other folks can decide based on its merits (and it sounds like they are few and far between)."
PlayStationPlus,382ifv,Aram_Fingal,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:19:28 2015 UTC,I think your under-estimating the amount of people who have PS+ and will play it now because they can at no-charge. I'm one and can't be the only. I can see it getting some people into it when the demo comes out....maybe.
PlayStationPlus,382ifv,erikb42,0,Tue Jun 2 14:49:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have PS+, of course, but it's different now. The game has been out for over 6 months, anyone that was desperate to try it has done so.  Many people will now have left the game for others, like those I mentioned.  There are tons of copies available for very little second-hand, so people that do like the demo can upgrade to the full version without paying anything to the developers (we don't know how digital / physical is split).  This makes it very hard for the developer to make money and keep things going. Are they going to sell DLC to these PS+ players? Seems like a tough sell.  All of this is splitting the player-base, which is critical to build-up for an online game.  You need to get as many people as possible all playing at once so a community forms.  I genuinely don't know.. But what PS+ games are there with a strong online community, where it's easy to get a good game / match?  I feel like PS+ players are inherently transient.. They get new games every month, and quickly leave the old behind.  We'll just have to wait and see though.. Only time will tell."

PlayStationPlus,382ifv,snusmuff,-1,Tue Jun 2 09:03:41 2015 UTC,"It's got a huge online racing community, and targets the same sort of arcade handling Driveclub does. GTA V is one of the most sold games of all time. In terms of trying to create a playerbase for Driveclub, it's a major competitor. In fact, it is likely the market leader by a huge margin, it has sold that many copies.  While it is paid for, almost everyone owns it (literally, it's ridiculous). So Driveclub being free isn't a big incentive if you already own GTA V and all your friends are playing it, creating custom tracks, etc.  Plus Rockstar are pushing GTA Online as an ongoing product / service, regularly releasing new content for free. That's a lot to compete with as a small company."
PlayStationPlus,382ifv,vampatori,2,Tue Jun 2 12:01:18 2015 UTC,"Initially I could at least try, a little, to follow your argument. However, you totally lost me when you said that GTA V arcade handling is the same as driveclub. Maybe try the game out before talking out of your arse."
PlayStationPlus,382ifv,christ408,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:00:09 2015 UTC,"I have both games.  I'm not quite sure which way you're arguing though.  Do you think Driveclub handling is more or less arcade than GTA V?  Driveclub has significantly more of an arcade feel than GTA V - but if you include sims in the spectrum (what I mostly play) then they're considered both over near each other in the arcade end.  While you can drive properly to an extent in Driveclub, it's actually faster to 'power slide' around everything.  Also, when you are trying to drive properly, the system is ridiculously forgiving.  Check out this awesome lap time for example.  Or any of the top lap times actually.  See (and hear!) how they get the car out of shape, then hold the slide around the corner and keeping up a huge amount of pace.  This is exactly the sort of handling in classic arcade racers like Need for Speed, Ultimate Race Pro, and Burnout.  Because of that, they're not really sticking to a standard racing line - the reason is they don't have to because you stick to the racing line to keep traction and momentum, and they're sliding around at crazy speeds so don't need either.  Compare that to a GTA V lap here.  You can see that in GTA V, you have to brake, you can't brake and steer at the same time (much, it is still an arcade racer) without loosing traction.  You also have to follow a proper racing line.  This type of handling was added to GTA in GTA IV, before that it was very much more arcade handling.  It revolutionised the game for me.    If you're driving 'properly' in Driveclub, you're doing it wrong.  I started like that, and found it quite tough going some times.  Then I realised you just wang it around, and the game becomes much easier.  Try it, you'll see!  Get it out of shape, then whack on the power and adjust the angle of the slide to steer.  Fastest way around the track, every time."

PlayStationPlus,381j82,zincdreams,2,Mon Jun 1 12:22:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, it is still broken after the patch. I can't get past a simple puzzle myself, the game crashes everytime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRrVAI4cZZM  Really annoying, as I actually started to like the game. But in this state it's just unplayabe at the moment :/"
PlayStationPlus,381j82,Comrade_Max,2,Mon Jun 1 07:23:06 2015 UTC,It's broken?! Darnit. I just downloaded the 3GB base game and 3GB patch file too. :(
PlayStationPlus,381j82,robih29,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:48:36 2015 UTC,"It seems it is selectively broken.  Some people play it fine (maybe a few small bugs) but others the game breaks and won't progress any further.    If you are itching to try it give it a shot, but otherwise it might be better to wait for the next patch (if that happens)."
PlayStationPlus,381j82,zaldan,2,Mon Jun 1 12:29:10 2015 UTC,Breaking mid-game is fine as long as I can progress to the rest of it. I want to get a platinum on this before I delete it. How far along did you get the game-breaking bug? Thanks
PlayStationPlus,381j82,Sirusavath,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:19:27 2015 UTC,My bug is happening towards the end. I am in pinwheel village and touching anything that solves a puzzle crashes the game.   Hope it doesn't happen to you.
PlayStationPlus,381j82,Erotic-Handshake,2,Tue Jun 2 07:51:23 2015 UTC,"Bugs in that game are insane and that's after a massive patch, it still has a 50/50 chance of hard locking up in certain places. The texture pop in on things is unbelievable not to mention I went exploring 4 times in the mines walked down a corridor and fell through the map into nothingness and another hard lock up, they just don't seem to have been bothered to shut off dead ends in the game. It's a shame because its a good premise for a game just seems to have been executed poorly."
PlayStationPlus,381j82,Sirusavath,2,Mon Jun 1 09:24:57 2015 UTC,Quite surprised to read that it is freezing. It always appeared to me that Sony and Micorosoft were both very strict about what comes to their consoles and their QA really tests game submissions very thoroughly
PlayStationPlus,381j82,Erotic-Handshake,2,Mon Jun 1 11:05:57 2015 UTC,"I played through the game over the weekend and ran into several smaller bugs and one major one. I was able to actually finish the game this time, which I was unable to do prior to the first patch.  The major bug was the game crashing and my save game being corrupted when making the transition from Pinwheel Harbour to Pinwheel Village. I was able to reproduce this again when I loaded a much earlier save game and tried to make the same transition. My workaround was to always transition from the Industrial Area to Pinwheel Village.  Some of the smaller bugs I can recall:   I transitioned to The Case immediately after triggering the elevator up from Brimclif mine and I clipped out the bottom when I returned. The Ore Tramming control panel seemed to get stuck and I was unable to redirect the crane to any other chutes after I selected the first one. I was able to get the item out of the box in the schoolyard without solving the puzzle there first (though I still needed to solve the puzzle to restore the projector)   Bugs aside, the story was great and the puzzles ranged from simple to very difficult. I found myself holding down the L1 button during my entire playthrough, so it would be great to be able to toggle it on by default."
PlayStationPlus,381j82,obi5683,4,Mon Jun 1 11:55:26 2015 UTC,"The major bug was the game crashing and my save game being corrupted when making the transition from Pinwheel Harbour to Pinwheel Village. I was able to reproduce this again when I loaded a much earlier save game and tried to make the same transition. My workaround was to always transition from the Industrial Area to Pinwheel Village.   Same thing happened to me and when I did some research someone said that if you just wait long enough it eventually loads. It took about five minutes, but it did work. I was so mad because my most recent backup was from a few hours earlier and I was just about done with the game. So glad that it wasn't as bad as it looked."
PlayStationPlus,381j82,Lord_Vinton,2,Mon Jun 1 12:26:58 2015 UTC,"Any idea if this will work for loading the save file that's been affected by that bug? Just wondering if I'm going to have to start he game over again for a third time, or if I can wait out the loading for 5 minutes."
PlayStationPlus,381j82,PartyLogic,3,Mon Jun 1 13:31:29 2015 UTC,"Yep. When it looked like it froze I closed the game and reopened it. I picked my save file and then the screen went black with nothing happening. It was at that point I started poking around online to find the ""just wait a few minutes tip"". Then it worked."

PlayStationPlus,381j82,Chef_Lebowski,2,Tue Jun 2 15:12:50 2015 UTC,"I have experienced a few minor bugs, but personally they don't really bother me.  As long as it doesn't completely stop progress in a puzzle or in the game I am willing to forgive.  I completely agree with a toggle for L1 it would make things much more user friendly. I would also love a faster walking or keep that the same and actually make running faster than a brisk pace.  I don't need a world class sprinter but maybe a slow run or jog would be better than walk and slightly faster walk."

I decided to move on to the next area, solved like two puzzle parts, discovered the mines, went back and everything worked smoothly until the other ending's end.    For the freezing just wait it out.. it'll take something like 10 minutes but it'll eventually work."
PlayStationPlus,381j82,AsianBlue,2,Mon Jun 1 22:51:16 2015 UTC,"I've had similar bugs happen to me, but I did download a large patch two days ago. I remember I would walk through walls where normally you wouldn't be able to reach because of the environment locks and I would fall endlessly through the map or reach some section you wouldn't normally be able to reach. Reminds me of that Goldeneye guard tower bug. Great game, love the atmosphere and art style, but the bugs really take you out of it. I didn't play after installing the latest patch so I can't tell ya."
PlayStationPlus,381j82,Escheron,2,Tue Jun 2 07:42:45 2015 UTC,"Kind of annoying as i really enjoyed playing it. But i've come across 2 game breaking bugs/crash and occasional glitches.

PlayStationPlus,37pg3y,TheToiletDuck,11,Fri May 29 12:51:32 2015 UTC,I've had better (quicker) luck with the online chat.
PlayStationPlus,37pg3y,_pigpen_,3,Fri May 29 16:37:49 2015 UTC,"I have had the exact opposite. Online chat either doesn't actually understand you, is forced to work from pre-concocted responses, and has always made the problem worse for me. Though you may sit on hold for a bit, calling has resulted in my issues being dealt with within minutes of talking to a representative."
PlayStationPlus,37pg3y,Wood_Ape,24,Sat May 30 00:41:58 2015 UTC,"Right. I mean, I saw the picture, and the first thing I thought was, ""Why did he come to reddit?"" Problem with product... talk to the people who produce the product.."

PlayStationPlus,37pg3y,Paleran,5,Fri May 29 14:14:10 2015 UTC,"Does calling Sony actually work?  I have heard some grim stories.  I have a year sub that I got through amazon and a year I bought through the interface on my PS4 and they have both been counting down in parallel rather than being additive.  I know I need to call and get it straightened out, but I just don't feel up for arguing with someone about it."
PlayStationPlus,37pg3y,bkedelen,6,Fri May 29 16:31:00 2015 UTC,Sony actually has very good phone support.   The vast majority of people who complain decided to go the easy way with chat support.   I wish people realized how useless chat support was.   For simple questions it's fine I suppose they might give you an answer but when you need something resolved you need to call 100% of the time.
PlayStationPlus,37pg3y,dfrazier81,1 point,Fri May 29 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"About a year ago I heard the opposite, and it went well when I used their chat support to refund an unwanted music+ subscription to my PSN wallet.  Maybe it depends on how you act on the phone."
PlayStationPlus,37pg3y,ghjkcvbn,-2,Wed Jun 3 03:27:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I have horrible hearing, and unless I want to repeat the word ""What?"" two dozen times as the Support on the other end of the line can never grasp the concept of SPEAKING UP, I have to use chat support. I've called Sony before, and I specifically stated that I have trouble hearing, and can not hear what the person on the other end of the line was saying. This went on for 10 minutes, and he literally never spoke louder, it's like he blocked out what I was telling him over and over. Your excuse may have worked a decade ago, but nowadays, when you do a large portion of your business over the internet, you damn well better have decent support for people over the internet."
PlayStationPlus,37pg3y,TheWhiteeKnight,7,Fri May 29 22:45:06 2015 UTC,If you are that hard of hearing don't you think a hearing aid would be a good investment?   Not making a joke I lost lost a lot of my hearing  while in the army and although it's not that bad yet I suspect it will get there the older I get.   When it  does rather than make people speak up just for me I would rather take care of it myself.   Some people just can't talk that loud and up  for support centers they are usually  an arms length away from another rep on the phone so they may not be allowed to talk above a certain volume.   I do agree that chat support should be a viable option to get support these days but it simply isn't.   I have never seen chat support for any company have anywhere close to the power of a call rep.   If they can't do anything they will tell you to call.   Due to a ton being ooutsourced now you would think it would be easier to read text than have to figure out various accents.   Lol reminds me of the time I got asked how to spell David.    Anyways hopefully one day it will get better but for now calling is the best option
PlayStationPlus,37pg3y,dfrazier81,-2,Fri May 29 22:57:07 2015 UTC,"what about those outside of the USA, we cant afford international calls, also most of us dont even know another language, so if we cant use phone support we are indeed pretty much fucked up if this happen."

PlayStationPlus,37p6fc,dfrazier81,3,Fri May 29 22:03:07 2015 UTC,"Because it's already $39 new, even less used.  Digital games should bare some resemblance to physical prices if they want to convince everyone to move over."
PlayStationPlus,37p6fc,junkit33,4,Fri May 29 22:20:14 2015 UTC,For the most part digital it's still new for consoles... This is the first gen that has even offered 100%of the library available digitally.    It will get there eventually just give it time.   Steam was horrible at launch and took quite awhile to figure out how to price games accordingly.   Like it or not though digital is the clear future....

Apparently this is a PSN+ exclusive sale, not merely a two-part sale where PSN+ members receive additional discounts.  The logic is a little strange to me personally, as long as I have a PS3/4 I'll have PSN+.  If the new program is to entice more users to purchase PSN+ the sales seem lack luster right? Because if you're frugal enough to not have PSN+ ($40 a year on sale), you probably aren't reading this and thinking ""awww fck, now I have to subscribe so I can get 20% off Bloodborne..."""

PlayStationPlus,37o9eu,nether1n,3,Fri May 29 09:11:05 2015 UTC,"AC4, as it was just on Games with Gold for XBL"
PlayStationPlus,37o9eu,Balfe,2,Fri May 29 22:46:15 2015 UTC,"As an Assassin's Creed newbie, which of these should I invest in?"
PlayStationPlus,37o9eu,168523,5,Fri May 29 09:17:12 2015 UTC,"Would you prefer city exploration, or wilderness and open seas? I'd suggest AC 4 because it has little of the meta-story, modern day bullshit, and because sailing the Caribbean is a lot of fun. And sea shanties!  If you prefer urban settings, the atmosphere and the art direction of the latest one, Unity, are great, but the game is kinda wonky... I've had loads of fun with Brotherhood and its Rome, or maybe Revelations if you'd rather go with Constantinople and a slightly more ""oriental"" vibe.  Avoid the third one, unless you're a civil war buff or something, and Liberation, which is kinda ""meh"". Also I'd suggest to only get one in the series— the gameplay is more or less the same, so you might feel like you've had your fill for a while after one, and not be interested in playing another straight away."

PlayStationPlus,37o9eu,ccstuck,1 point,Fri May 29 16:48:34 2015 UTC,I haven't heard of this. Do you know how it works?
PlayStationPlus,37o9eu,DreadnaughtHamster,2,Fri May 29 19:32:06 2015 UTC,"Sure!  What I did was:   1) create an NA Playstation account using a throwaway email address and entering a US address when it came to all the address business.  2) log in to that account on my PS4 and set that PS4 as that accounts 'Primary PS4'. This means that any games bought and downloaded on that account and that system can be played by anybody.  3) Unfortunately, credit/debit cards from other regions don't seem to work and neither does PayPal. So you have to purchase PSN gift cards that use the other store's currency (for you, that'd be GPB £). This is the site that I used :) http://www.pcgamesupply.com/buygames/sony-playstation-network-cards/  4) Then you just register that foreign currency PSN card on your foreign account and go spend some money! :)   If any of this is wrong, I'm sure somebody will correct me but that's what I seem to remember from doing it :) nabbed myself Don't Starve and The Walking Dead: S1 for under £10 which is such a good deal."

It's the most satisfying animation I've ever seen."

PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,tbx5959,19,Wed May 27 16:11:53 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, I get it.  I've played Ground Zeroes and understand the criticism.  Not everybody wants to play around in a small sandbox with no underlying campaign of any substance, no matter how good that sandbox is.  Looking at the broader issue, Sony hasn't included any full AAA games for PS4 in PS+ except for Injustice, so obviously it bothers people to see that trend continue.  Ground Zeroes and InFamous: First Light are shorter experiences.  DriveClub PS+ is a subset of the full game.  So we're stuck in this pattern of basically never getting a full AAA game and I think that's a fair criticism of the service.  With what's been available for PS3, expectations were set high and have not been met."

People's expectations for plus are not within reason - 6 games for 4 and a third is not going to equal online shooter du jour."

Then how do you explain the quality decrease in the PS3 selections, and don't tell me it's because of PS4.  PS Plus was still giving awesome PS3 games each month when the PS4 was here, it's just the last few months they have gone way downhill."
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,pear1jamten,2,Thu May 28 01:40:03 2015 UTC,"Easy, PS+ is now mandatory, so Sony no longer has any reason to attempt to get higher quality games since most of their users will need PS+ anyways."
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,TheWhiteeKnight,3,Thu May 28 15:32:26 2015 UTC,"That's exactly my point, PS+ is on a downwards trajectory as far as value is concerned.  IF Sony kept in contact with the player base like Microsoft does and actually implemented needed content like DLNA then I might let it slide.  But the fact remains, the titles are getting weaker and the updates to the PS4 are mediocre without any valuable communication (think Major Nelson) with their paying customers."
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,pear1jamten,3,Fri May 29 04:06:59 2015 UTC,People's expectations for plus are not within reason   I disagree.  It's wildly profitable (and increasingly so) and I think Sony could do more to provide a return for our subscription fees.  It's not like PSN is actually stable/reliable enough to justify the cost.
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,Aram_Fingal,4,Wed May 27 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"Plus is not a co-op; its purpose it to be profitable and for 50 dollars a year one gets far more value in games than the price.  Yes, people's expectations are not within any bound of reason."

PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,IceBreak,3,Thu May 28 11:02:56 2015 UTC,it is AAA quality gameplay though
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,letsgometros,4,Thu May 28 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm an asshole, but MGSV is basically just a demo, is it not? This is just the first chapter of a game that hasn't been fully released yet, correct? If that's not a demo, I don't know what is. I find it disappointing that Sony couldn't find a full AAA game to put out this month (yet again) and instead half-ass it by releasing part of a full AAA game. There are plenty of day one games that have run their course and people aren't buying anymore. There's no reason Sony can't release them. It might actually create some new players and earn them some DLC money."

PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,Ad__Hominem,2,Tue Jun 2 09:08:42 2015 UTC,"Metal Gear Solid is the most story driven franchise I've ever played. If you really want to understand what's going on then yes, you have to play the previous games. Or just MGS 3 and Peace Walker if you will, because they follow the same storyline as MGS V."
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,Snowyguy,2,Wed May 27 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"The story is pretty short, small element of a larger series. You probably won't know what's going on despite the text explanation before the mission.  That being said it's stilll a solid little stealth game. If you want to sneak around a base for 5 or so missions you could play it just as a stealth sandbox and have a great time not knowing what's going on in the story mission. The other missions aren't canon anyways and have no story to them except stuff like blow up that AA gun, or rescuse that hostage. Ground Zeroes is one of the most stand-alone games in the series in some ways.   If you like it then I really suggest playing them through in release order. If you are interested in games as a medium at all it may be the most innovative AAA series out there."
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,Tercotta,5,Wed May 27 16:41:41 2015 UTC,"DOn't do it, play the others before. I made that mistake with MGS4, and then I had to play all the others before."
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,ryanhardy101,3,Wed May 27 15:56:16 2015 UTC,I too have never played any. Should I start at the very beginning with the PS1 version and go from there? Been procrastinating getting into this series for years and now there are so many games.
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,fieldstudies,5,Wed May 27 16:08:49 2015 UTC,"I actually just played all of them last year during the summer. You can actually find the legacy collection pretty cheap on amazon and other stores for $30ish dollars. You get MGS1,2,3,4, and Peace Walker...also some extra stuff like some extra missions and some remastering of the old games. I forget what exactly, but its a great deal. Though technically only thing you need to play to get ready for MGS V is MGS 3 and Peace Walker"
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,SIRTreehugger,3,Wed May 27 16:13:26 2015 UTC,only thing you need to play to get ready for MGS V is MGS 3 and Peace Walker   I'm actually not sure that's true. There are a lot of moments in MGS3 that are specifically designed to be impactful if you've played games that come after it chronologically. MGS5 Trailer Speculation
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,Tercotta,2,Wed May 27 17:25:03 2015 UTC,"But for ground zeroes,  you should be fine. The upcoming mgsv yes you'd want to play the others. But if you play just ground zeroes and want to know what's happening,  3 and PW will be good enough."
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,d1rkSMATHERS,3,Wed May 27 18:44:42 2015 UTC,I would recommend playing the first from PS1 and go from there (Legacy Collection is perfect for you) or just play MGS III and Peace Walker and then this one (this is not ideal).
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,ryanhardy101,2,Wed May 27 16:32:40 2015 UTC,Just MGS3 and Peace Walker. Whole series cronologically: MGS3 - PW - GZ - PP -MG - MG2 - MGS - MGS2 - MGS4. Right after that is technically MGR.
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,lle0nx3,3,Wed May 27 16:17:54 2015 UTC,"But if somebody is playing the series for the first time,  play in chronological order of release:  1, 2, 3, 4, PW,  GZ"

PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,junkit33,1 point,Wed May 27 18:44:05 2015 UTC,"My first metal gear was MGS4, and I was super confused so I played all the others starting from MGS1. After that I'm still super confused, but at least now I get the references/names/people.   All the individual games are made to have standalone plots that can be enjoyed without having every single bit of back story. Plus, even if you were familiar with the series, you'd still be confused. It's not like a movie or show where the first one might end on a cliff hanger, and the second one finishes it up."
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,humanmanguy,1 point,Wed May 27 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"It has a brief recapitulation of the cronologically previous games in the menu, so you should be good with that.  That said... the rest of the mgs games are freaking excellent"

PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,DerClogger,1 point,Wed May 27 17:26:28 2015 UTC,No! The game seems to continue almost entirely from Peacewalker (which I never played). There's an excellent  written synopsis that'll catch you up in 5 minutes. This is set before every MGS except 3 so most of the canon is irrelevant anyways.

PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,DoodMonkey,3,Thu May 28 14:41:57 2015 UTC,"This is a solid lineup. I have Skulls of the Shogun on the PC, but I've never played it, and would just as soon play it on the PS4 so that works for me. Exploding Zoo is the type of game I would have never purchased, but having it be a part of PS Plus for the month makes me more than happy to give it a go. Never really played Ground Zeroes, so that will be nice to have on the system.  My only small minor barely visible nitpick is I wish Futuridium wasn't offered so close to Race the Sun. I know they aren't the same game, but they sort of live in the same space in my head. Having a month between them would have been nice. But then I could just dl the game, and play it down the line when it feels fresher to me. See -- I said it was a barely visible minor nitpick."
PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,jacobi123,4,Fri May 29 06:47:08 2015 UTC,"this is a really great lineup this month I am impressed.  I like the AAA titles but I rarely play that much into them. I play it for a couple hours and move on. So the limited game that is GroundZeros is fine for me, You get a large sampling of AAA quality gameplay that for many is more than enough to have a great experience. NOt all of us have the time or patience or attention for much more than that anyway.  I'm really excited to play Juarez, never have before. That environment looks fantastic.  I love shooters and Futuridium looks right up my alley. Watching the ps+ preview video of it reminded me of Race to the Sun but with much much more action, and colors!  The ExplodingZoo game I will probably hardly touch, though it does look unique.  The Shogun game looks interesting, a unique setting and style, bit different kind of gameplay  and Cloudberry Kingdom looks like fun too, and the premise sounds great, of customly generated levels to match your gameplay level.   Lots to explore on my ps3 and vita and another few games to add to the PS4 list for the future"

This nail-biting mission onto a Cuban military base follows Snake as he attempts to rescue Paz from enemy imprisonment.  Skulls of the Shogun: Bone-A-Fide Edition (PS4) This turn-based strategy game turned a lot of undead heads with its story of a Samurai Afterlife. Build an army of the undead, battle your opponents, and regain your honor.  Super Exploding Zoo (PS Vita | PS4) Players must defend all the precious animal eggs in the zoo from evil aliens who want to eat said eggs. How do you defend these tasty treats? With a herd of explosive animals, obviously.  Futuridium EP Deluxe (PS Vita | PS4) A psychedelic, retro-inspired shooter with crazy action, puzzle elements, and a bumping electronic soundtrack. May or may not induce random dance parties.  Call of Juarez: Gunslinger (PS3) This first-person shooter celebrates the wild west in a big, bloody way. Take down anyone unlucky enough to cross bounty hunter Silas Greaves.  Cloudberry Kingdom (PS3) The dev team behind this insane 2D platformer spent 2 years building an AI that could build a near-infinite number of levels for any difficulty. It looks totally bananacakes.

PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,25sittinon25cents,1 point,Wed May 27 18:52:15 2015 UTC,It can be speed run in 6 to 10 minutes with average play of an hour or two taking place in one location originally was going to be 60 dollars but konami realized that was beyond stupid and launched it at 30 or 40 dollars (I forget). I've heard game play is really good but most people are pissed about the length for cost. As a side note you can squeeze more time out of it doing some of the side missions. I refused to buy it because I felt it was a rip off but now that is plus I'll gladly play it.

I've had my eye on Skulls of the Shogun since back when I did my gaming on the 360. I never did talk myself into pulling the trigger, though, which means this will be a welcome addition to my library even if it isn't the greatest game of all time. Futuridium has also been on my radar for a while. I love arcade-style shooters! I hope there are leaderboards. Super Exploding Zoo is the only game I'm not too sure about.

PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,Sokonomi,1 point,Wed May 27 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"Happy that MGS V: Ground Zeroes is up there, but at the same time it is a bit of a let down. The second triple A game they have put up since the PS4 came out, and it's pretty much a glorified demo that cost $20 bucks at launch.  It's a fun demo, but at the end of the day that's what it really is. The truly sad part though is that with it being free it may be a lot of people's first MGS game. While the gameplay is fun, the scale of Ground Zeroes is so tiny (because it WAS a demo for a game coming later), which makes me worry that anyone playing MGS for the first time will write the series off because of how little there is in Ground Zeroes.  Some people may not know that this is pretty much a demo for another game, and expect a full game's worth of content out of it only to be left going ""Why do people like MGS so much?"""

PlayStationPlus,37gxuh,mattiejj,3,Wed May 27 15:44:26 2015 UTC,I picked it up when it was $1 a few months back because people on this sub had a lot of good things to say about it. People should still give it a shot despite it belonging to a genre they may have come to loathe. It's a lot of fun.

PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,RecyclingBin23,6,Sat May 30 16:06:16 2015 UTC,I rented it and honestly even if it was free I wouldn't play it. Just a terribly repetitive game and no motivation to get through it.

PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,Tyler2Tall,0,Sat May 30 21:26:34 2015 UTC,Isn't the MGS we are getting just somewhat of a demo for phantom pain?
PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,GarethMagis,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:52:29 2015 UTC,"From what I heard it's the prologue, and took 5-10 hours to beat. It launched at $30/$20. It probably has the highest production value of anything PS4 has gotten on + yet."
PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,Tyler2Tall,2,Mon Jun 1 22:23:05 2015 UTC,"I think you mean, AAA games will start coming again.  Seriously, what happened? We used to get at least one AAA game every two/three months, and then all of the sudden it started being an endless parade of indie games. I really hope that this signals a return to the old."
PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,kilbert66,1 point,Sat May 30 23:28:45 2015 UTC,That's pretty much the same reason I loved Knack.
PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,CA719,-5,Wed May 27 21:00:42 2015 UTC,"Knack is way more fun that 90% of The indies we've been getting. I played and enjoyed the whole game, most of the indies get deleted pretty quick"
PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,lightningsword,4,Wed May 27 21:42:03 2015 UTC,"Because it was a really poor choice as a launch title that people fixated on. At its core, it is a fun crash bandicoot-esque ""old school"" platformer, and people do enjoy those. But not as an example of what their new shiny can pull off.  Couple that with the lead designer (who, if memory serves, was also one of the big guys as far as the PS4's development goes) outright saying it wouldn't come to PS+ as he was concerned over cannibalized sales and it becomes a way for people to prove themselves correct for not buying a game.  I got it at launch because Amazon did a promo deal (other game was AssFlag, with Killzone as the bundle), and I actually enjoyed it a lot. Not the best game, but for the price I liked it."
PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,Gundato,3,Sun May 31 15:04:04 2015 UTC,"Because it has a bigger budget and is a retail game meaning it feels more 'worth it'. Like it's a 'real game' because it shows what the PS4 can do on a technical level. Which is silly to me, but I understand the logic. Also I feel that people are more willing to try something they are familiar with, games like Knack are already on people's radars, but they don't really want to give an indie game they've never heard of the time of day. It's more satisfying when a game you've been considering for a while goes on Plus than something that is completely unknown to you. And even though it's an indie game, I think it's the same with Octodad - a lot of people already know about it, but they don't want to pay for it.  Every month I see people complaining when the Plus games aren't something they've heard of or something they already wanted to play, and I think they prematurely establish in their minds that these games they've never heard of are going to suck, even before they play them. I imagine more people will play Knack to completion than say, Apotheon or Never Alone. They've already decided that those games aren't worth the time and Knack is, because it's an AAA game with good graphics. Which is quite sad to me."
PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,greg225,2,Wed May 27 22:42:46 2015 UTC,i bought it at 20 and at that price it was worth it. If i paid more i'd feel cheated its a simple platformer if you know that going in and have the bar set low its not a bad game  only real issue was how many gigs it required to install. Remember it was alot for a hum drum game
PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,peterkozmd,2,Thu May 28 15:08:30 2015 UTC,"Aside from the fact that it's a little repetitive, I had a lot of fun playing through it. Even more fun the second time playing co-op with my girlfriend, who isn't much of a gamer herself (she likes it too!)"
PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,johnmichaelhowe,2,Thu May 28 18:51:25 2015 UTC,I thoroughly enjoyed Knack. I just think it shouldn't have been a launch title because people wanted more realistic graphics right away.

PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,NippleThief,1 point,Thu May 28 13:06:45 2015 UTC,They just want a AAA title. Knack is commonly mentioned since it seems to them that an under-performing Sony-owned property would be an easy one to make the transition.
PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,happyscrappy,1 point,Thu May 28 15:59:05 2015 UTC,"I bought Knack on launch day. I enjoyed it and it was my first PS4 platinum.   It's inly $15-$20 on eBay now, just buy it!"
PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,Mr_Pie_Eater,1 point,Fri May 29 17:46:53 2015 UTC,Because it was a first-party launch AAA game and people think it would be feasible for PS Plus for these reasons. People so badly want a AAA game but Knack is just another AAA Platformer that these guys always complain about.
PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,zombieducklings,1 point,Fri May 29 21:49:02 2015 UTC,"I played through it with my son three times. It's not great, but it's not terrible either.

PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,turdoftomorrow,1 point,Sat May 30 04:38:42 2015 UTC,"It can be argued that Sony does get some benefits for putting up their own games simply since they don't have to pay a royalty (so to speak) to another developer.  Lets face it :P if someone is going to buy Knack they are probably going to buy a used copy where Sony gets none of the money anyway. So why not put Knack on for a month to entice people into PS Plus where they get potentially $8 from many new members, which is better then the $0 they get from someone getting a used copy."
PlayStationPlus,37i4d8,BreezyNate,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"Knack and Killzone were one of these first exclusive PS4 AAA games on release and it's possible considering they are cheap now. But then again Sony don't usually put their own games up on Plus often as they being the one who usually pays devs to put their games on Plus, Sony wont get any benefit from it by putting up their games. They did during the PS3 days when they had the yearly games list because they were trying to get people to buy Plus but now that you need Plus to play multiplayer, everyone is gonna buy it regardless of what's games are free on Plus. About half the people who have Plus don't even care about the free games or aren't up to date/have little info on it. I think some people want it because it has a better chance of hitting Plus than any other AAA game, same with Killzone."

PlayStationPlus,37gxlh,gekko201,12,Wed May 27 16:10:11 2015 UTC,I'd say it is as much of a game as Infamous First Light.  It is not worth the 40$ they were asking for it initially. I payed 10$ for it and felt like it was money well spent.  The main story only lasts like 2 hours but oh boy it's intense.  Additionally there are other side missions to complete that will take most of the time and those are fun challenges.
PlayStationPlus,37gxlh,Tercotta,4,Wed May 27 16:26:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it totally wasn't worth a 40$ ps4 disc purchase. But I certainly got my value out of the 20$ ps3 digital copy. It's probably one of the best games they've put out for free on ps4 yet."
PlayStationPlus,37gxlh,SilverKry,2,Wed May 27 16:47:30 2015 UTC,It was $30 disc. 40 was the original before Konami reduced it    due to eople yeling. $30 used to just be the physical PS3 price.
PlayStationPlus,37gxlh,clint_iestwood,1 point,Wed May 27 21:32:52 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the main mission can be beaten in a hour and half tops, and you can literally beat each of the very few side missions in 5-10 mins. I'm happy to see GZ on the list because it is a fun game (and should have been free from the start) but I hate that our second triple A game since the release of the ps4 is what's basically a glorified demo."

PlayStationPlus,37gxlh,wmurray003,1 point,Sat May 30 03:35:47 2015 UTC,I'm going to say yes being that they usually explain a lot of stuff during the games.. yet people still don't understand what's going on.

PlayStationPlus,37gxlh,_MrBubbles,0,Mon Jun 1 00:49:14 2015 UTC,"So, I never really come to play any MGS Game.  After I bought a PS3 sometime ago, I bought the HD Collection but I can't really play that. It's weird. I get dizzy doing so.  I wanted to buy Ground Zeroes the last time it was on sale but asked a friend who's a huge fan of the series if I should do so. His answer was No, because it would bombard me with story plots I just couldn't understand, since I've never played any of them.  Now my question:  Is there any (good) Video Series which explains the Story clearly?  I tried one sometime ago, but it was just constant ""blah blah"" because it wasn't really good explained and very confusing.  I could of course ask my friend but he can't explain it really good either^"

I too have played multiple MGS games and I still don't fully understand what is going on, but it is interesting. A lot of it has to do with the cold war and Snake being a clone and potential nuclear war etc. The story spans a 50-60 year period of time also. 60's-2010's."
PlayStationPlus,37gxlh,skitech,2,Sun May 31 13:29:01 2015 UTC,The play through that chip cheezum did was pretty fun.  If you are interested in the story but don't want to try to slog through it's worth watching as he is very good at the games so is quite fast.

For a classic bundle I would place Crash Bandicoot, Spyro The Dragon, Ape Escape, Parrapa the Rapper, something from team ICO, Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank.   For a more modern bundle, I would love to see Killzone, Uncharted, Beyond Two Souls, The Last Of Us (that stand alone DLC would be nice), even Knack.   Or we could just get some decent indies like Shovel Knight, Teslagrad, Rogue Legacy, Bastion, Spelunky and OlliOlli.  All crossplataform (when available) and crossbuy. To be honest,if more companys were given the chance to do these kinds of bundles for consoles I would love to have some of those games.   For charity of course."

PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,dark_delight,1 point,Wed May 27 20:59:19 2015 UTC,I don't know. Nintendo just did one so it wouldn't surprise me if by the end of the year there was one.
PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,al_ien5000,4,Wed May 27 22:51:55 2015 UTC,He's saying a lot of those titles are brand new or less than a few months old. If a bundle did happen it would not be that fresh.
PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,Gcoks,0,Thu May 28 13:57:50 2015 UTC,"True, although they are only new really to playstation. They are at least a couple of years old overall though."

I would LOVE to see consoles adopt a similar pricing structure to that of PC. Both Humble Bundle and Steam offer PC gamers incredible deals, and is a key factor to Gaming PC sales.. so hopefully by implementing this, Sony will see this as a way to sell more systems."
PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,johnmichaelhowe,3,Wed May 27 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"Well Sony has done some amazing sales that have given some of steam's sales a run for their money. Less than 5 dollar games, even 1 dollar games."

PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,DKnight32x,3,Wed May 27 16:59:50 2015 UTC,"It's ridiculous that they've done this too. Why not just name it something else? If you can't play it's games on the regular 3ds then it's not a 3ds, calling it ""new 3ds"" just sounds like a new model like the ""ps3 slim"", could you imagine if the ps3 slim played different games as well as the original games and then you'd have to buy ""ps3 slim"" games. They've been doing this for awhile now and it's caused people to completely not understand their products. For like a year a lot of people thought the wii u was just a Wii controller...  With this said though, I wish they'd just wisen up. I don't dislike Nintendo. I actually own a 3ds and Wii U."
PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,PatrickKelly2012,2,Wed May 27 22:24:14 2015 UTC,"Because the new 3ds exclusive games are far and few between. Right now, Xenoblade is the only retail title even announced. I believe Binding of Isaac is the only digital game. Thats not a lot to launch a new brand off of."
PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,DKnight32x,3,Wed May 27 23:42:09 2015 UTC,Yeah. That's true. But I don't see the point in claiming it's the same system if they can't play all the same games.
PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,PatchTheGamer,2,Thu May 28 01:17:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll likely buy this so he can get some new games, sadly pretty much everything for the WiiU I've already played on PS4."

That said, I don't think a Humble Bundle would work on Sony consoles. I've been looking through the list of indie games on PS4, and most of the good ones have been given on PS+, and the ones that haven't like Shovel Knight or Axiom Verge are definetely coming at some point."
PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,DrunkeNinja,3,Wed May 27 15:35:29 2015 UTC,It doesn't have to be just indie games or PS4.  A few companies like EA have done humble bundles full of AAA games.
PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,MightyGreenPanda,3,Wed May 27 16:30:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we have the same issue. Most of the games that big companies offer are older ones (not always, but usually), and most of them have been offered on PS+ or will probably be offered in the future. That said, it could still work for people that subscribed lately to PS+. I started on June 2013, so I missed lots of great games like Hitman Absolution, Sleeping Dogs or Dead Space 2 (although now I have all of these)."
PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,DrunkeNinja,4,Wed May 27 16:37:56 2015 UTC,It's not like they all have to be games that never appeared on Plus.  Humble Bundle frequently has games that were in other bundles and even other Humble Bundles.
PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,Teh_akod,2,Wed May 27 16:52:20 2015 UTC,"I for one would love to see some older games from 2012 or 13. I was not a subscriber until very late on 2013 so seeing some games I might have missed wouldn't be so bad. Just as an example, I never got the chance to get Vanquish on Ps3, but with a bundle like this I would gladly pay for the game."
PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,jclast,2,Thu May 28 01:19:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know. At some point I might not have PS+ anymore. It'd be cool to own some of the stuff I've gotten for ""free"" forever. Especially if I could get them for a low price."
PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,MightyGreenPanda,3,Wed May 27 15:43:31 2015 UTC,"Now that's a whole another story. Upgrading your PS+ games to actual ones for a small price is a very interesting idea, and I don't see why it wouldn't work."
PlayStationPlus,37gs1z,cotch85,0,Wed May 27 15:45:58 2015 UTC,Region lock on the current bundle is so upsetting.. Just bought a wii u and would have liked some games to play on it other than repetitive remakes

PlayStationPlus,37gjx1,Streetfoldsfive,4,Wed May 27 13:50:02 2015 UTC,"Murasaki baby was alright. It had a pretty unique premise, but some of the controls or gimmicks get kind of annoying.   Unfinished Swan is awesome. That game is really a great experience all around."
PlayStationPlus,37gjx1,pir8pat,3,Wed May 27 14:00:11 2015 UTC,Enjoyed baby although it only took about two hours to 100% and some of the later levels the controls became more of an annoyance. Overall I think it's worth playing just to see the designs as the puzzles and platforming was nothing to write home about.   Swan originally didn't do anything for me and I quickly got bored of it. Then my kids got ahold of it and loved it. Eventually they progressed through the game to the dark portion and called me for help. These later levels captured my attention and I enjoyed finishing it. My advice is stick with it as it does get more interesting but doesn't run so long it over stays is welcome.
PlayStationPlus,37gjx1,infinitelives,2,Wed May 27 19:43:20 2015 UTC,"Murasaki Baby is perhaps the weirdest game I've ever played.  It makes fantastic use of the Vita's unique hardware features and as such, could never be played anywhere else.  Highly recommended if you're looking for something different.  The Unfinished Swan was pretty decent, not a must-play but worth trying and finishing for fans of first-person puzzle action games like Portal.  The fun is in figuring out the different mechanics, which shift slightly as you progress through the game, and use those mechanics to get through each area."
PlayStationPlus,37gjx1,Sadistic_Sponge,2,Wed May 27 17:43:12 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the unfinished swan. It was a little simplistic but it didn't overstay its welcome and the mechanics mixed things up enough that I didn't get bored. The extreme use of white hurt my eyes at first and I was very happy when it got toned a bit, especially in the later stages. The ending was cool, though I was left a little confused about if I was supposed to have figured everything out by that point or not. The big reveal at the end was something I figured out due to some obvious hints, so it felt (unintentionally?) anticlimactic."

Now.. with how much people bitch and moan about indies every chance there is.. and Trials Fusion is an ""AAA"" game apparently.. what makes it better than, say, Olliolli? they're pretty similar.. but I'll help and say Olliolli is a smaller game, but then what makes Trials Fusion better than Binding of Isaac? Oddworld? Transistor? BoI is definitely much bigger and deeper than Trials Fusion (it's still getting support and an expansion too).. while Trials Fusion has that ""indie style"" to it.. how come people still say they want more AAA and less indies? it's definitely not about the style as evident here.. is it just a 'this game is called aaa so i want' then? Hopefully you can see why this is so stupid."

We also got Infamous, but just the DLC and not the actual game. And now we're getting a third ""AAA"" game, but it's just a demo for Metal Gear 5 really. Why are they not giving out more AAA games by now? Surely they could give away a game from the PS4's early lineup that doesn't really sell too much anymore, like Rayman Legends, Killzone, or AC4. I mean, most of the indie games turn out to be fun, but I really wish we could get actual mainstream games soon."

PlayStationPlus,376j18,johnmichaelhowe,9,Mon May 25 13:51:19 2015 UTC,They won't give us exclusives so early. My bet is on a third party AAA. Something like PES or one of the Metro games.
PlayStationPlus,376j18,ICodeHard,32,Mon May 25 10:46:45 2015 UTC,Is it really too early? Its been out for for a year and a half. We don't really have anything to compare this too though since PS+ came out a few years after the PS3 came out
PlayStationPlus,376j18,_meppz,10,Mon May 25 13:32:12 2015 UTC,"Taking ps3 average time to release on plus being 19-24 months I'd say that it is to early. Maybe in next few months but if I were sony I wouldn't start doing AAA until I had the ability to do at least one a quarter or people will scream deceptive advertising, dropping one AAA to get subs then going back full indie. From a purely financial point of view they have already given 50 dollars plus value a year to the AAA crowd with infamous and injustice just for ps4 not including 3 and vita."

PlayStationPlus,376j18,Sirusavath,12,Tue May 26 07:31:25 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try and be realistic with these perdictions, because I have a good feeling that this month might just be a good one. My predictions will be entirely based on the fact that E3 is coming up within the next set of weeks.  I feel that we should at least have AC: Black Flag. If not for the PS4, then at least the PS3 variant or ACIII.  The Escapists may make an appearance since people have said that its release date is roughly around the same time the store will likely to update (don't quote me) with said PS+ titles.  I want to say The Last of Us: Left Behind (PS4). Hard to say since it hasn't been out for a long time. But the price for it is cheap as compared to First Light and/or The Old Blood, in terms of standalone titles.  Otherwise it'll be either a set of indie games I've previously heard of but not acknowledge a PS4 version for said game(s) or ones that I've not even heard of before. Something entirely brand new, but may find tiresome since my library is filled with indies I've yet to play.  PS4: TLoU: Left Behind, The Escapists  PS3: Assassin's Creed: Black Flag / III, [INDIE TITLE]  PSVita: [SONY TITLE], [INDIE TITLE]"
PlayStationPlus,376j18,ShaunSP,5,Tue May 26 14:12:31 2015 UTC,"Assassins Creed 3 had already been on the EU PS+, so I don't think that would happen.  I can see Assassins Creed IV: Freedom Cry happening over Black Flag."
PlayStationPlus,376j18,BeanbagTheThird,3,Wed May 27 11:31:23 2015 UTC,"I don't see Sony just giving out Left Behind since it spoils a lot of TLOU.  Now that TLOU has been bundled, it's price is in the $10-$20 range which makes the whole package a good candidate for PS+."
PlayStationPlus,376j18,Tyler2Tall,1 point,Mon May 25 16:03:58 2015 UTC,I honestly don't see Sony giving away TLOU as a free PS+ game while still bundling it. They would essentially be giving two copies of TLOU to new PS4 buyers for the whole month.

PlayStationPlus,376j18,Lightfooot,11,Mon May 25 09:12:55 2015 UTC,"My first test of the prediction formula I'm working on for fun. All games picked meet the average time to release criteria and an emphasis on ps4 crossbuy because they seem to be flooding the system with games. I think the indie trend will continue but because of e3 they will have a big name indie line up. Vita is most uncertain because the library has too many ""average"" candidates. Also given average release time for AAA knack and killzone are not up for plus until next month.  PS4 Hotline Miami 2 (ps3 ,4, vita) Escapist (ps4) (releases on plus day in us)  PS3 Starwhal (ps4 ps3) Hell divers (ps3 4 vita)  Vita Oreshika (vita) Tales of hearts r (vita)"
PlayStationPlus,376j18,pir8pat,9,Mon May 25 14:27:37 2015 UTC,Hotline Miami 2 and Helldivers were released to recently
PlayStationPlus,376j18,Sicmay,1 point,Tue May 26 08:42:58 2015 UTC,"They are on the short side, ps4 average indie being 4 months with a range not including day one of 4 to 9 months but I figured sony will push big names early for e3. Runners up were splice, super stardust ultra, metro city, and grim fandango. In any case just for fun seeing if I can even guess one game and at least it's realistic compared to some wild predictions I come across."
PlayStationPlus,376j18,pir8pat,5,Mon May 25 13:37:37 2015 UTC,"It's not their choice unless is a first party game, if the developers don' want the game to be in PS+ then Sony can't do anything."
PlayStationPlus,376j18,DrYaguar,1 point,Mon May 25 15:21:12 2015 UTC,"IMO, it's more likely that Sony will hold off on big-name games like Hotline Miami 2 and Helldivers. If they're going to be on PS+ soon-ish, my guess is that Sony will make that announcement as part of their E3 presentation. That would make them July titles."

PlayStationPlus,376j18,MightyGreenPanda,4,Mon May 25 17:47:42 2015 UTC,"Yes that's the one,  I put it in there because of the release date on plus day. Why would an indie risk sales from plus speculation by launching that day if they weren't on plus. Could obviously be wrong but all these games fit the launch time window and what sony is looking for in plus."
PlayStationPlus,376j18,pir8pat,10,Mon May 25 14:23:14 2015 UTC,I may assume that Warner Bros could be adding Batman Arkham Origins to IGC with the release of Arkham Knight since the'r already partnering on AK Bundles and Exclusive DLC. But that's just me. And thus we may play 3 previous Arkham Games on PS3 before starting the Arkham Knight.
PlayStationPlus,376j18,PsychoDesign,5,Mon May 25 14:47:59 2015 UTC,"I think Origins is a good bet, at least one of the previous Batman games has been plus already so we know WB is willing."

PlayStationPlus,376j18,Hawk798,3,Tue May 26 11:50:55 2015 UTC,I think this month should be stronger in the razzle dazzle department. E3 is in June. They want to look better than MS games with gold. But we could have 6 more indie games. Who knows.
PlayStationPlus,376j18,MisterThundercleese,3,Mon May 25 15:18:31 2015 UTC,"The Escapist on PS4 seems to be a reasonable choice. It comes out on the first Tuesday of June and usually when an indie game comes out at the beginning of a month, there is a good chance that it's a freebee. Well, I hope it is, because I want to buy it."
PlayStationPlus,376j18,poklane,1 point,Mon May 25 23:31:10 2015 UTC,"I doubt that The Escapists will be a PS+ game since it's releasing May 29th in Europe, so it will be on sale already for a couple of days when PS+ games release."

PlayStationPlus,376j18,RussellGrey,10,Tue May 26 22:21:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sure if they could offer 6 AAA titles a month they would. They approach developers and ultimately it's up to them. Indie developers are the ones looking for exposure, so of course they're going to bite more often. You can't really blame successful franchises for not wanting to give their games away for a fraction of the price. They'll only do it when it makes good sense as a business. This month, as others have said, that means there's a strong possibility that Batman Origins will be up in order to advertise the new Batman game coming out shortly."
PlayStationPlus,376j18,HairyAsHull,9,Wed May 27 07:16:15 2015 UTC,"See that is the kind of things people want, Origins, is a great week long game, and worth the play through, not better than Arkham City, but it was fun. I was under the impression Playstation Plus was going to be of the mindset to release Greatest Hits Games consistently, seems like a great model, instead of buying this year+ old game for 20$, I can play it for the weekend."
PlayStationPlus,376j18,CurbedEnthusiasm,5,Mon May 25 12:13:13 2015 UTC,Exactly. I'd rather one game in each category that was a solid AAA than 6 indies.

PlayStationPlus,376j18,robred007,6,Mon May 25 15:35:22 2015 UTC,"I could see them doing something where they give away an extra game during E3 week for each platform, similar to EA giving away 3 games during Playstation Experience."

PlayStationPlus,376j18,robred007,3,Mon May 25 07:57:12 2015 UTC,I think Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare is very under rated. Its a great game when you ignore the micro transactions (which you can easily do without).  I hope the new Plants vs Zombies game that EA announced at its investors call last month is a sequel to it and not another version of the mobile game.
PlayStationPlus,376j18,bugzkilla,2,Mon May 25 11:57:52 2015 UTC,Totally agree with that! I really enjoyed the game and it would be great to see some more features like 4 player split screen with a bunch of new modes and maps. Hopefully it is a sequel and not another mobile game.
PlayStationPlus,376j18,JohnQuim,2,Mon May 25 15:18:41 2015 UTC,The Escapists is the quintessential indie game. Absolutely brilliant fun for a short while but zero replay value.

That said, it's probably going to be more indie platformers."

PlayStationPlus,376j18,Tumaras,2,Tue May 26 05:36:20 2015 UTC,"We look at PS Plus the wrong way sometimes in trying to make predictions.  It's not so much the games we want or how long they've been out.  The dev has to accept basically zero to little revenue for their game when they do it, so it's always 1 of 2 drivers for them to let Sony add it to Plus.  Either #1 it's a smaller (cough, indie) developer that wants to gain brand recognition to help sell future games, or #2 if they sell DLC for the game and think they will make more off of DLC purchases than selling the base game outright."

PlayStationPlus,376j18,Matt4045,3,Mon May 25 15:23:37 2015 UTC,"Multiple people have come out and said that the amount they were paid was pretty adequate.  It seems to serve as a nice little lump sum at the end of a game's profitability. On top of which will likely come an increase in DLC sales and new potential buyers for sequels. Let's be frank here, if they weren't getting a decent deal, they wouldn't agree to it."
PlayStationPlus,376j18,DrYaguar,2,Tue May 26 00:27:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly, that's why the quality of games dropped shortly after the PS4, now that PS+ is required for online play, developers know everyone and their mkthers have it, so they're more unlikely to make a deal with Sony."
PlayStationPlus,376j18,Tyler2Tall,2,Tue May 26 01:00:42 2015 UTC,"Even for AAA dev's once the game hits the $20 price point, the game has had the vast majority of its sales.

I've noticed that when we pay for AAA titles they ALWAYS need patch, are sold unfinished (so the D1 patch), and cost more than 50/60 euros. Indie are for certain aspects better, more funny, and complete. I've enojed more indies that some retail titles, so I hope to see great games (like Shovel Knight for example) this month.

I was thinking about games like Valiant Hearts, Binding of Isaac, Guacamelee, Resogun.  I prefer retail over DD so if I buy a physical game I pay the full price for an incomplete game, and this is a real fact. Do you know any retail game that doesn't need a patch? Some like Alien or Wolfenstein need patches of many gigas.  In my favourte games in the current gen there are titles like Bloodborne, Battlefield, Rayman, Dying Light, Diablo and I love them. I enjoy both AAA and indies; but is also true that many people complain about all indies on PS+. Personally I enjoy playing indies and love them and hope to get good ones. There are some good and bad ones in both AAA and indies, but my words were spent about the constant need of downloading something to have a finished game that SH should test before put on the market, since the full price is high. :)"

PlayStationPlus,373d9f,MFTWrecks,11,Sun May 24 14:37:14 2015 UTC,"Anything you buy, you own. No matter what.  If it's given to you as a PS+ member (as part of IGC), then it is unplayable upon a membership relapse/cancellation. HOWEVER, note that the moment you renew anything you used to have access to is accessible again.  So for instance, you're a PS+ member for a year. You get all the IGC games during that time and buy a handful of games on sale. Upon relapse/cancellation, you would have access to everything you bought but none of the IGC games. You go a year without PS+. The following year you decide to buy another membership. The moment you buy in, you'd have access to all the IGC games you had before.  Note: PS+ generally pays for itself buy buying stuff at extreme discount. A lot of people think it's best used for multiplayer gaming and the IGC stuff, but really, access to steeper sale prices during flash sales and other promotions is really where you get the best bang for your buck. I saved something like $24 on Shadow Warrior a few months back in a single flash sale. That's half a year's membership ""paid for"" in a single purchase. It's fantastic."
PlayStationPlus,373d9f,tjwharry,3,Sun May 24 15:32:21 2015 UTC,"The word you're looking for is ""lapse"". ""Relapse"" is when an addict begins using again."
PlayStationPlus,373d9f,avball,3,Mon May 25 03:47:03 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't ""relapse"" be an appropriate choice of word when buying another membership the following year? ;)"
PlayStationPlus,373d9f,BYF9,2,Tue May 26 23:25:39 2015 UTC,"I guess so, lapse is latin-based, lapso, which means loop, so a lapse would be a loop, in this case a twelve month loop. To relapse, then would be to do the loop again."
PlayStationPlus,373d9f,Awake00,-5,Wed May 27 14:41:07 2015 UTC,Relapse. Ha.
PlayStationPlus,373d9f,coyote1284,3,Sun May 24 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"From the FAQ:   [ 8 ] What will happen if I let my subscription run out? What will I keep and what won't I have?  As outlined in #6, if your subscription lapses or runs out, you will lose access to the game and all the free DLC. If you purchased any DLC (or anything, games included) at a discounted price, you will be able to keep that. Also, avatars and themes that are free are kept."

PlayStationPlus,373wf5,peterkozmd,1 point,Sun May 24 22:25:10 2015 UTC,"Just turn off auto renewal or remove your stuff like /u/Mcllamas said. They will charge you and if its some kind of bank card you will likely get charged and have a negative balance, which would then make you pay the negative balance + bank fees and that could be like 20-30 bucks extra."

PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,Khyrdantai,7,Fri May 22 20:32:56 2015 UTC,That's the current plan. I'm still trying to work out why I got it though!
PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,Regithiel,5,Fri May 22 20:37:21 2015 UTC,"I assume they're glitches on the PSN Store infrastructure. I got Resogun for free the other week for the same reason. Just enjoy it, I guess!"
PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,Regithiel,3,Fri May 22 20:39:22 2015 UTC,Nice. Was Resogun on PS+ at some point? I feel like it's one of the few PS4 games I accidentally bought (I don't own a bloody PS4) when hoarding stuff on PSN thinking some of it was free.
PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,the_italian_stallone,6,Fri May 22 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"Yup, it was on it last year, around summer I think."
PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,Regithiel,1 point,Fri May 22 20:47:29 2015 UTC,I think it was earlier than that because I didn't get PS+ until may 2014 and unfortunately Resogun hasn't been on IGC in that time.

PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,wmurray003,1 point,Sat May 23 16:48:26 2015 UTC,It was the very first PS+ game for PS4.
PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,IllIllIII,1 point,Sat May 23 18:06:02 2015 UTC,It was one of the first games on PS+ around the time PS4 came out.
PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,Regithiel,2,Tue May 26 05:04:19 2015 UTC,"Resogun is free because it was cross-buy and released on PS3 and Vita after it was no longer on PS+. Sony had to manually make it free for those who bought it or got it before through PS+. As a result, those versions weren't tied to the PS+ sub.   I was thinking the J&D trilogy must be different, but then I remembered that the games were in the European IGC and (accidentally?) cross-buy with the Vita version. That might have something to do with it."
PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,IllIllIII,1 point,Fri May 22 22:38:22 2015 UTC,"But I got all 3 versions for free, months after my subscription ran out."
PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,Regithiel,0,Fri May 22 22:44:11 2015 UTC,"Did you 'purchase' the PS4 version of Resogun at one point? I think all that matters is whether it was in your purchase history when the PS3 & Vita versions were added to the store, whether it was free through PS+ or bought with your PSN wallet funds. Since it's three-way cross-buy, you still get to keep the PS4 version."
PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,Endyrith,1 point,Fri May 22 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"Nope, never spent a dime on any version. Got all 3 for free, after my PS+ subscription ran out. I did have all 3 through PS+ at one point but they had expired, I deleted them and then a few months later showed up randomly for free on my library"
PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,xXSushiSanXx,3,Sat May 23 00:12:46 2015 UTC,"I think that the Jack and Daxter Collection is cross-buy with the Vita version of the game, so when you got the PS3 version of the game you probably got the Vita version as well. It seems that sometimes even if you got the game originally through PS+, it will give you the versions on the other platforms to keep when it's cross-buy. Since you now own a version on another platform and the game is cross-buy, you basically own the original version that you downloaded as well. This is what seems to have happened to me with some games, and this might be the same for you."

PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,SkyScooter,2,Sat May 23 18:07:42 2015 UTC,There was a glitch on the EU store (or UK atleast) when these games were on ps+ they were free forever (not tied to ps+) and also the ps3 versions were given away by mistake when it was only meant to be the vita ones... if I remember right anyway.  But I definitely remember at the time the games were listed as free with no ps+ icon by mistake when I went to purchase them for my IGC.

So when the subscription ran out there was no timer to lock the game.  If you go into Information on some Plus titles (especially older ones) you dont have an expire date there."
PlayStationPlus,36wsy7,bluEfya,1 point,Tue May 26 22:53:30 2015 UTC,"The ""Cross-buy"" feature on certain ""Free with Plus"" titles ends up granting a free full license; I think it's related to the original title going free and the cross-buy version being launched later.  Also applies to the Vita versions of Resogun and Don't Starve."

I'd say it's worth only 5 or 10€ at most.

PlayStationPlus,36v1tm,Mongfight,4,Fri May 22 16:36:20 2015 UTC,That's not true.  They offer a free 7 day return window on used games. I'm not sure how often you could get away with that before raising a red flag.

PS+ alone provides me more games than I can play, and that's on top of things I really want to play that aren't on PS+, games on other consoles, mobile games, Steam sales, PSN sales, etc, etc.  I fooled around with Secret Ponchos for maybe 20 minutes because the concept looked interesting, but I wasn't loving it, so I moved on and never looked back."

PlayStationPlus,36lyw8,fieldstudies,2,Thu May 21 02:31:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, I've been playing it on my Vita a lot and then I remembered it was cross-buy and installed it on my PS3. Not nearly as enjoyable, a combination of a bigger screen hindering the experience for me and (imo) that the vita controls are tighter, makes the Vita a better choice."
PlayStationPlus,36lyw8,frakilk,1 point,Thu May 21 20:49:25 2015 UTC,"Me too, big surprise. I wasn't expecting much from an endless runner, but I think the execution and the minimalist style are fantastic. It has me leaning in my chair and pulling cartoon-like facial expressions.  I just discovered last night that it's an almost zen-like experience to play this and have suitable music playing through your headphones. I got to this part of Air's ""Run"" yesterday just as I was taking off from a ramp and I got goosebumps."
PlayStationPlus,36lyw8,TimberWollfe,12,Thu May 21 08:18:31 2015 UTC,"I think I bought into the hype a little too much with Hohokum. While it was a nice peaceful game with good music, I needed a little more structure. I found myself often times not knowing what to do and I was having problems a lot of the times with the screen zoom, even after turning it off. I'll admit to using a guide for this game just to get through it. 6/10  Race the Sun is what it is; an endless runner. Like someone already said, you can play a quick game or get caught in the ""just one more race"" and eat up a ton of time. What puts it above some others is that it changes the maps every day. I'm currently pulling my hair out trying to get the Yeager trophy. 7/10"

PlayStationPlus,36lyw8,robih29,19,Wed May 20 13:03:05 2015 UTC,"Played race the sun a bit, probably won't play it again. I'm usually not switching on my PS4 to play a ""time filler"" game.  Hohokum: I just don't get it. I was flying around and getting somewhere else it seems, but I don't really know what to do so I kinda stopped and played something else."

PlayStationPlus,36lyw8,YoungForever,8,Fri May 22 11:11:48 2015 UTC,"Hohokum is not for everyone. You just have to be in the right mood for it. The fun in the game is just exploring and the joy of figuring out the puzzles. About 1/3 through the game you actually figure out your objective. It takes patience, a carefree attitude, and just enjoying the ""art"". I personally loved it but it was unlike any video game I've played before."

PlayStationPlus,36lyw8,pythagean,4,Thu May 21 06:32:34 2015 UTC,"Race the Sun: I haven't played that much of it, but I really like the feel of it. The sound design is awesome, I'm not a big fan of endless runners but I might put some more time into this.  Hohokum: A pretty hard game to really rate, personally I found it relaxing and interesting. Just moving through the levels and seeing the different scenarios the creators made was awesome, then I figured out that there were actually puzzles in each level. Pretty fun trying to figure out what you need to do on each stage."
PlayStationPlus,36lyw8,D3adkl0wn,8,Thu May 21 02:19:45 2015 UTC,"This month was as bad as last month IMO.    Hohokum was interesting to me and from the quick trailer I watched, seemed like something I'd enjoy a little..  It wasn't..  I was hoping for something more, with at least a point of playing other than flying around meeting other things and bouncing off of stuff..  I dunno, I'm sure someone liked this, but it wasn't for me.   Race the Sun was okay the first time I played it.. But I soon realized that this was it..  There would be no changes to the flat grey textures and the progression made the game feel like a less fun jet pack joyride more or less..  Again, I'm sure someone liked it, but it's not a game for me."

PlayStationPlus,36izv1,Aram_Fingal,4,Wed May 20 03:03:29 2015 UTC,Dying Light worth it?
PlayStationPlus,36izv1,madbubers,3,Wed May 20 02:46:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, though I can't speak to the quality of the DLC.  The main campaign and overall mechanics are really surprisingly good."
PlayStationPlus,36izv1,Aram_Fingal,3,Wed May 20 03:06:37 2015 UTC,Hmm...Premium for BF4 worth it?
PlayStationPlus,36izv1,Saint3Dx,4,Tue May 19 22:45:22 2015 UTC,"I think Premium is worth it. 5 map packs, plus guns and exclusive tags. Plus, a lot of people are still playing it."

PlayStationPlus,36izv1,tbx5959,4,Tue May 19 22:48:33 2015 UTC,"just played it a little bit - it's like rc pro am for nes back in the day - top down remote control car game - it has races, overtakes, hot laps so far for the 30 mins I played.  there is a ton of content here - looks like 190 cars/trucks and nearly 100 main events plus a bunch of other things to do."
PlayStationPlus,36izv1,SteveSharpe,2,Tue May 19 23:04:45 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed Motorstorm RC. Some of the highest challenges are really tough, but the races are quick so you get to where it is fun to try over and over again until you run through perfectly.   The only negative that I have with the game is that every challenge is basically a time trial. You have races, but it's basically you starting in the back and you have X number of laps to get into 1st before it's over. Then you have actual time trials, ghost laps, etc., but at the end of the day everything is you racing against time on a bunch of different tracks.   They could have made this an absolute classic if there was an online mode where you could have actual races with a bunch of real opponents."

So I thought you were outright wrong (since $20.99 > $14.99). That or I thought you thought the yeti campaign was normally $20 which I KNEW was wrong.  I looked again on my laptop where I saw the PS+ discount added and saw what you meant. So I did actually grab it.  Sorry for my misunderstanding.

It's making me seriously consider switching from this point on but I have a few games I should really play. But then I'm not seeing myself having enough time for all of them plus upcoming games. This sucks.

PlayStationPlus,36fau8,Booker_Ijonen,2,Thu May 21 14:38:45 2015 UTC,Most of them aren't that good if it makes you feel any better.  Most of the time it's bad games marked up to 50%-70% off you'd waste your money buying and the popular games are marked down to what psychical copies cost in the stores.
PlayStationPlus,36fau8,Decyde,7,Thu May 21 17:39:44 2015 UTC,"You think US has it good? Try Canada; same deals and promotions and our prices are in CAD and I don't know if you checked recently, but CAD is worth shit all. We are getting an insane deal by buying ps+ for 50 CAD.  Most games are the same price on our store too (save for full priced retail games which are 10 bucks up which isn't even representitive of how weak our dollar is)"
PlayStationPlus,36fau8,naylord,2,Tue May 19 03:07:20 2015 UTC,"Are the games the EU and US get always the same now? There used to be small differences but if they're exactly the same, you're right, it might be working looking into a US account. Standard prices are: £40 / $50 USD... (which is £32) but I'm sure you easily shop around and get a code online cheaper."
PlayStationPlus,36fau8,DY357LX,2,Mon May 18 23:52:30 2015 UTC,Yep it's been the same for something like a year now. In my store PS+ is exactly $65. US have it for $50 I think. Not to mention there're online offers that go as low as $28 (hovers around $30) about every three months. It's very hard to say I want to sub on my EU anymore if the PS+ benefits are shared between all the account on the PS4. The only problem is the vita but that barely gets attention lately so.
PlayStationPlus,36fau8,G-H-O-S-T,3,Tue May 19 00:11:22 2015 UTC,"I realize this post is marked as EU, but it's worth mentioning that for my J-PSN account, I hopped on a deal that was 12+3 just in March. So Sony as a whole still does these. In EU, I have no idea. Sorry."
PlayStationPlus,36fau8,LoserOtakuNerd,2,Tue May 19 00:06:11 2015 UTC,The had PS+ EU for 25% off for the first two decembers after PS+ was introduced. Nothing after that IIRC. :(

PlayStationPlus,36epre,failburn,9,Mon May 18 20:50:47 2015 UTC,That would work if you subscribed to PS+ on your OLD account.  Your new account doesn't have access to those games. Any given account only has access to the games that were free when the PS+ sub was live.

PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,wrboyce,3,Fri May 15 11:59:55 2015 UTC,"In the UK ""hacking"" is covered by the computer misuse act, which has three salient points:  1) unauthorised access 2) unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offences 3) unauthorised modification  The law doesn't tend to state a required skill level or the use of an exploit/vulnerability for it to be classed as hacking. If I was stupid enough to write my password down and you, having read it, logged into my account then that would be unauthorised access and a crime."

PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,InaneSpontaneity,1 point,Fri May 15 01:00:27 2015 UTC,It's unauthorized use of a password.
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,finalellipsis,23,Fri May 15 03:53:17 2015 UTC,This shit is why they need to implement 2-factor authentication. It happens way too much and their policies prevent honest people from getting their accounts back when it does happen.
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,PenguinTD,8,Fri May 15 14:48:05 2015 UTC,A policy change is definitely in order.
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,finalellipsis,2,Fri May 15 04:00:51 2015 UTC,"Use a google e-mail, enable 2 step authentication. Apply LastPass for free, enable 2 step authentication as well(same google authenticator app). Now, use this with properly choosen password for LastPass, random gen password(at least 20 chars) for google/psn.  Now you are set until quantum computer is a thing that people can buy. There is no way a internet person can hack your account like ever again, because math and LastPass provides region lock. They also provide notification if a major security exploit was found and some of your account's website might be affected.  However, that does not prevent someone you know to steal your phone and you told them your LastPass master password."
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,PenguinTD,1 point,Fri May 15 04:02:47 2015 UTC,"I actually use all that personally, but they still need to implement it for the people that set their own passwords and have nothing tied to that. Your post is still great advice for anything that doesn't do that yet though."
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,Rosur,3,Fri May 15 18:12:42 2015 UTC,"people choose really bad passwords, that's why we see these thing popped up time and time again."
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,corruptheretic,2,Fri May 15 18:17:09 2015 UTC,Yep they definitely need 2-factor (should be standard these days)
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,corruptheretic,26,Fri May 15 18:21:52 2015 UTC,My kids activated my account on a friends system. I and already used the online tool to deactivate all systems so I couldn't use that. Sony customer service didn't give me a hard time. They just deactivated things from their end.  Tell them your kids did it.
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,jonmsanti,3,Mon May 18 12:19:57 2015 UTC,"They said ""no matter what circumstances"" they will not deactivate a system because they do not have that option. All that is available is an online form that you put your psn ID, your email, and your serial number. I was originally told to do that and it was an immediate rejection because ""i had just deactivated an account on 4/15 (this is the deactivation in question, of which i did not do) and they couldn't deauthorize the one on the account"" and that they didnt have to give a reason as to the denial of deauthorization."
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,Atomizy,5,Thu May 14 21:23:29 2015 UTC,Guess I got lucky.
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,kaztrator,6,Thu May 14 21:31:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. you did. At least in my experience with them. May do what someone mentioned on another post, just wait a week nd play dumb, i can tell them then my kids did it. Maybe they wont give the ""we have no option to do that"" spill and do it. Which would suck because why couldn't they just do that to begin with."

PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,indianapale,3,Fri May 15 15:13:04 2015 UTC,Have you tried logging into your account from your computer? You can deactivate consoles from there. Then just reactivate yours.   I don't see why Sony would give you a hard time. If it's really your account you shouldn't have a problem getting on and reactivating it. So why not allow you to deactivate them all?   Make sure you change your password and maybe even your email linked to your account.
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,dead_ed,3,Sun May 17 06:39:47 2015 UTC,The website is the problem. Someone used my credentials and deactivated my console and activated theirs in place.
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,indianapale,2,Thu May 14 23:03:29 2015 UTC,"Log in to the website. Change your password. Deactivate theirs and activate yours. Bottom line is you shouldn't do anything until you get your psn password changed. I really don't get why you're not understanding that.   EDIT: After reading more including the official PS docs (https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2616) I see now that you can't deactivate a single device unless you're in control of that device. And now your only option is to deactivate all devices which the person who got control of your account has already done and now you're in the 6 month waiting period. Dude, that sucks so hard. Still, I hope you got that password changed and anything else you need to change that would help that person get a password reset. I hope you can at least reactivate your ps4."
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,indianapale,9,Thu May 14 23:09:43 2015 UTC,"I can't deactivate theirs to activate mine. There's a 6 month wait time between website deactivations. So the person deactivating mine to activate theirs imposed the 6 month wait. Sony won't circumvent that either. That's the problem I'm having.   Edit: Yeah this whole situation is terrible. Thanks, man"
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,triedtostayaway,2,Thu May 14 23:28:32 2015 UTC,"Sony only allows for one or two system deactivations every six months. The problem here is that even by doing that,  they won't be able to deactivate the other console."
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,MadenX,2,Thu May 14 23:56:19 2015 UTC,Wouldn't changing your password require you to authenticate again? Effectively locking them out of the account?
PlayStationPlus,35zkw8,triedtostayaway,5,Thu May 14 23:35:34 2015 UTC,"Yes they now are locked out of my account after a password and email change. However, they still have access to everything I've purchased and can play it on their accounts. Sucks cause my 8yr old daughter was trying to get all the trophies for Minecraft on her own psn account but since I can't make my console my primary, she can't use her psn id to play Minecraft cause I bought it on my account. I mean, its only $20, but its the principle of the thing, ya know?"

They just told him that he's spouting nonsense because no one has accessed his account and that he deactivated the consoles himself. In the end he just waited for those 6 months to pass so he could reactivate his consoles.

For Xbox 360 and Xbox One games – Yes, the codes will work with no problems. For Playstation 3 and Playstation 4 games – You will need to create an American PSN account to redeem the code.  Anyone can create an American PSN account, just do a quick Google search for directions.  So the answer is unfortunately no - US only."
PlayStationPlus,35r7lj,Maximelene,1 point,Wed May 13 02:35:20 2015 UTC,"So the answer is unfortunately no - US only.   The answer is Yes. After dowloading it with your US account, you can play it with your EU account, just like if you downloaded it on the EU store."
PlayStationPlus,35r7lj,TiittySprinkles,2,Wed May 13 12:00:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should probably have been more clear - the answer is unfortunately no, if you don't have a US account.  (My impression was that the question was whether the code would work to download it from an EU account, not whether it would work to play on an EU account if you download it from a US account.)"
PlayStationPlus,35r7lj,sliverr828,1 point,Wed May 13 21:40:33 2015 UTC,"You'll have to create a US account to download it, and after that you can launch it with your EU account."

Still don't see why no one has made a big deal of Naughty Dog not releasing the old DLC perks and weapons for free in the Remastered version. Guess not a lot of people care about the multiplayer.  Or know that it exists.

Sony didn't handle it well which is par for the course with them, but I wasn't upset at all.  That being said, this is merely a demo without a time limit. Now I think I'm glad this was such a f-up. It could have set a dangerous precedent for PS+ games. It still might.   Imagine a game like Street Fighter where you only get 8 characters and you have to upgrade (buy the full version) to get all the characters (except for the DLC characters of course, that's extra).  It's basically a ""free-to-play"" type game that isn't really free to play because the full version is restricted until you pay to play it. It's ridiculous this is being included as part of a service people pay for.  Don't hit me with the ""PS+ is great value and you're just an entitled whiner"" crap. PS+ is great value. I typically find that I get my money's worth after a month or two, not to mention the sales. I'm not complaining about PS+'s value. But this DriveClub PS+ Edition is a totally different animal."

If it ends up taking the place of some other free game in a future month, then we can talk about the precedent it sets.  Otherwise, it's just free stuff on top of everything we were already getting."

Next step would be to replace one of the future games with a ""free-to-play"" demo type game.   My friend has a Tekken game that's free-to-play. I think you get 1 character and there is a time limit. This Drive Club PS+ Edition isn't far removed from that. But no one would be excited if that was added to the PS+ lineup. It's already ""free-to-play.""  My problem is the idea that this game demo adds value on top of the regular PS+ lineup. It's just a demo which almost should be free to play to the public anyway. The only thing that really makes this different than a demo is that there isn't a hard time limit. The soft time limit being one's subscription to PS+."
PlayStationPlus,35pjpx,Boroda_UA,0,Sat May 16 00:22:07 2015 UTC,"Although I understand your concern, it's really just a slippery slope argument that could be used by anyone anytime they add anything of value to a Playstation Plus subscription, as long as the recipient perceives it to be of lesser value than anything else already on the menu.  And if bonus content is met with criticism instead of praise, it can just as easily mean no bonus content in the future.  Calling DriveClub PS+ ""basically a demo"" isn't wrong either, but even then it's a substantial demo that clearly outshines your Tekken example.  Even if they chose to make the Tekken demo (or something similar) a PS+ exclusive, as long as it was purely bonus content, it would still be a perk.  Whether or not it's right to put such content behind a paywall where the general public can't get at it is another matter entirely.  In the case of a generic demo I think it's unfair, but I can't deny that it's a fantastic PR move if executed correctly.  When Nintendo announced a week-early release of the Super Smash Bros. for 3DS demo with no usage restrictions for Platinum Club Nintendo members only, I argued against it, but very few people seemed to grasp that all Nintendo had actually done was take an ordinary (albeit highly-anticipated) demo, create nonstandard restrictions (compared to the rest of the industry) and then remove the very restrictions they created for the exclusive benefit of their spendiest customers (of which I am one.)  The reason I think DriveClub is a possible exception from the above is because the DriveClub servers seem to be so fragile — regardless of whether or not sloppy design is to blame, the product is the product.  The PS+ edition was supposed to be ready for us at the launch of the PS4, but here we are one and a half years later and we're just now getting a ""coming soon"" teaser with no date attached.  Imagine how much longer the wait would be if they were planning to invite every PS4 owner to hop on board as well.  Ultimately, however, like the Super Smash Bros. demo situation, it's not the PS+ members who are being penalized here, it's the general public (potentially.)  But since DriveClub PS+ goes way beyond a traditional demo, I can't really argue that they're being deprived of anything.  A traditional demo doesn't allow for online play (I don't think I even know of any that do), but DriveClub PS+ will.  If anything, the fact that online play is behind the PS+ paywall is the actual crime here, but that goes well beyond the scope of DriveClub.  And unfortunately, having a paywall of that nature is essentially the penalty we all pay for wanting to have heavily-subsidized state-of-the-art gaming consoles.  Sony went with free online play on PS3, and lost substantial market share to Xbox 360 because Microsoft subsidized, making the initial price point of the Xbox 360 far more attractive than that of the PS3.  Somewhere, there has to be a limit to how much free/cheap entertainment a person can expect, and considering that PS+ is only $50 a year (compare to the $400–$500 a person had to spend in a calendar year to be a Platinum Club Nintendo member, and participate in market research besides) I just don't see the sense in complaining about any of this, and especially not in getting upset with Sony over things you fear could happen before an actual precedent for those things has been set."
PlayStationPlus,35pjpx,bubbywashington,0,Tue May 12 17:41:52 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point entirely. This edition of Drive Club is much closer to a demo or a free-to-play than a real game. The fact that it includes more features (online play) doesn't change that.   And it is only a slippery slope fallacy unless it's real. That's the thing about slippery slope arguments. Sometimes they're accurate.   Gaming has been going in the direction of what should be known as pay-to-play for a long time. First there was DLC, then there were more egregious examples of DLC like launch day DLC and games Super Street Fighter IV where the content was on the disc when sold but required purchase of a code to access the DLC, then we're seeing more and more freemium games that don't allow access to all features of said game without massive real world expenditures.   The Drive Club demo is just another example of this trend. It's a free-to-play game that Sony is trying to pass off as an ""additional perk"" for a service that people are paying for. Now it's ""additional"" but given the trend it could very well become the norm.  Give an inch and they'll take a mile."

Actually once the consumer acts complacent with what they are given that when companies start seeing how much less they can give.

The difficulty was perfect, challenging, but never unfair. Recommended!"
PlayStationPlus,35pdgu,StarfighterProx,6,Tue May 12 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"Guacamelee is tons of fun. I played it a bit on my friend's Xbone and was pumped to see it on PS+ this month. I started my first PS4 playthrough on hard and it isn't too bad for the most part. The boss fights are a real pain, though, since the fights are really long and you have so little health. I'm up to the second major boss (spoiler) and I keep getting one-shotted by an enemy that spawns right next to me late in the fight and immediately lets loose an unblockable attack. :/   The art is good, the dialogue is pretty funny, and the controls are extremely responsive. The platforming puzzles are really fun, too. I'm not too impressed with the costumes, though, as most of the early ones seem to be of the ""gain a benefit, but lose health"" type which lacks variety. Thus far, I seldom use any of them since I'll just get killed in a single attack. Everything else is fun. I like the challenge arenas quite a bit.  If you're interested in play on hard mode from the get-go, enter the Konami code at the main menu: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, square, triangle, touchpad. The screen will change colors if you did it correctly (and quick enough). Good luck!"

I've heard a patch is coming but I usually don't stick around buggy games as my back log is massive.   Guacamelee: I've mostly been playing this. It's given me some smiles and the game was fun for me and the family.  Artwork and music were also a breath of fresh air and I've enjoyed the fighting and platforming mechanics.  Unfortunately I'm growing tired of the game after hitting a difficulty spike in the last level. I don't mind hard games (got an issac platinum to prove it) but I just don't like grinding and backtracking and since this is a metroidvania that's probably why I've got the spike because I'm under upgraded. Still don't regret playing it even though I'm probably not going to finish it.

PlayStationPlus,35lfzl,Ramblemore,17,Mon May 11 13:49:08 2015 UTC,"One PS+ account is good for two PS3s and two Vitas*.  Both PS3s can be online at the same time playing the same games together (with different PSN names).  *Both Vitas CANNOT be online at the same time, but can play ad hoc together. If the second Vita goes online with the first one is online, the first Vita will get booted off.  So in theory you really only need two PS+ subscriptions for maximum value, OR you could get a memory card specifically dedicated to having THE PS+ account, and swap it for a non + account when playing non PS+ games."
PlayStationPlus,35lfzl,Nawara_Ven,2,Mon May 11 14:57:51 2015 UTC,"Downside on the Vita is you have to use the PS+ account on both vitas to be able to play plus games. For example, my son can't download my vita plus games as a sub account. Only my account can download them. Kinda sucks since he can play my plus PS3 games with his account."
PlayStationPlus,35lfzl,IamBabcock,1 point,Mon May 11 17:47:17 2015 UTC,So I could just link one Vita to my master account and the second Vita to one of the sub accounts?   Would the Vita on the master account kick me off PS4?
PlayStationPlus,35lfzl,Nawara_Ven,3,Mon May 11 15:02:48 2015 UTC,May be eaier just to get them separate PS+ subscriptions. They are starting to play online with school friends and I don't want the friends list of my master account clogged up with sqeakers. lol
PlayStationPlus,35lfzl,ViceroyFizzlebottom,5,Mon May 11 15:04:46 2015 UTC,"The Vita PS3 and PS4 can all be on at the same time. But it's probably going to end up being more convenient for you in the long run to just get separate accounts, and cheaper than buying your kids new games."
PlayStationPlus,35lfzl,ViceroyFizzlebottom,0,Mon May 11 15:09:50 2015 UTC,No such thing :(
PlayStationPlus,35m199,SapiR2000,3,Mon May 11 16:44:17 2015 UTC,PS+ games only work if the account that owns them has PS plus. So because you bought it with a different account you won't be able to play the other accounts PS plus games.

PlayStationPlus,359qcg,UberDemon,4,Sun May 10 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"Always look out for indie games that have been critically praised. When you see or hear people saying a indie game is really good, it's worth playing. People today thinks bigger AAA games today provide much more entertainment as a video game when actually most Triple A games don't. Not to say there aren't any bad indie games, there are, but always look out for them because you'll end up getting this reaction of being surprised."

PlayStationPlus,359qcg,survyguy79,3,Fri May 8 15:35:05 2015 UTC,Nope. It's just a stupid little easter egg but it made me laugh. It's in the true spirit of the silly nature of the game.

I'm pretty much forcing myself to finish it at this rate. I believe I'm halfway through I thought I was going to love it, but it is just meh for me. I have put more time into Race the Sun which for some reason has me addicted. I haven't touched Ether One yet, but I will soon."

PlayStationPlus,359qcg,emor09,2,Sun May 10 03:49:34 2015 UTC,"What's different about this Guacamelee version that wasn't in the original one?  Is it much more expansive?  More levels?  More moves?  I finished it last year, and I enjoyed it a lot, but I felt like I finished it at or near completion.  Is it really worth playing again?"
PlayStationPlus,359qcg,phbohn2,2,Tue May 12 19:35:44 2015 UTC,"Felt the same way.  Saw a bunch of indie games that didn't seem all that interesting.  I always try out the games anyway (I mean, why not?) and Guacamelee was definitely a pleasant surprise.  I still don't care about any of the other games, but Guacamelee was enough.  What really pulled me in was the combat.  So much time in Metroidvania style games is spent fighting enemies and if you don't nail the combat things get boring really fast (main thing that turned me off from Dust: An Elysian Tail).  The NPCs never overstay their welcome and are sprinkled in just enough.  Though now that I'm further into the game I'm wishing the map was bigger because I've just about cleared everything.  Maybe I'm wrong, but the castles in the Metroidvania Castlevania games (SotN, Sorrow) always seemed larger."
PlayStationPlus,359qcg,Endrance,2,Thu May 14 18:54:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah the maps in Guacamelee! are medium compared to other platformers, I'm currently working on the platinum trophy for this game so I'm rather happy about that, less work. Haha"
PlayStationPlus,359qcg,Activelikeasponge,4,Fri May 15 08:05:49 2015 UTC,"Hohokum is a blast! I'd really recommend giving it another shot.   The ""first"" level is really just the home zone, and the objective of the game is to find all the other colorful snake-thingys you met in the home zone by visiting the different worlds.  The environments are brilliantly drawn, and I absolutely love the reactive sound environment in each of them. You have to figure out puzzles to free your snake-friends, the game doesn't hold your hand and instead just lets you explore and figure it out for yourself. Also the soundtrack is fucking epic (featuring Com Truise and Tycho among others)!"
PlayStationPlus,359qcg,jbonejimmers,2,Fri May 8 10:49:11 2015 UTC,Awesome--this makes me excited to give it another go!

Feels a lot like Rayman on the PS1 to me, brutally hard on the platforming at times but really rewarding once you get it down. I like the way the power ups work as well. Best indie game I've played this year! The rest really underwhelmed me but I've come to expect that from most indies. It's really nice to have a good one, though!   The most challenging thing was actually getting the super long combos for the training chicken down.. the stupid dummy always flew halfway across Narnia before I could land my final punch.

PlayStationPlus,3585tp,Toysoldier34,0,Fri May 8 02:31:54 2015 UTC,"Um no that post is for a year and only covers value.  My post is different in that it show's what's going on with the meta critic score and how long it takes a game to get on plus from release. I'm not trying to show ps plus value because it's really a personal opinion, rather I'm looking at how games are selected to be put on plus so I can hopefully crack the prediction code. From the averages in makes sense why knack hasn't come yet or really any major retail on ps4 but we should be getting close.  It also shines a little insight on what sony wants plus to do for each system.   Taking a look at averages I have a prediction for June where each game listed is a strong possibility for inclusion. Not a sure thing of course but each game listed does continue the pattern in the data.  Hot line Miami 2 ps3 ,4, vita Escapest ps4  Starwhal ps4 ps3 Hell divers ps3 4 vita  Oreshika vita Tales of hearts r vita"

PlayStationPlus,359e5d,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Mon May 11 01:16:10 2015 UTC,I don't mean I lost them I just mean I can't access or play them since I don't have ps plus on my account anymore and that's the account I downloaded the games from. I still have the games on the system it's just they're locked until I reactivate ps plus on my account.
PlayStationPlus,359e5d,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Mon May 11 01:44:51 2015 UTC,Well if you couldn't get help from Sony then another way you could do this is to just get on your brother's account and change his licensing in the settings so that games can be shared across accounts on the system as long as his account downloads them. Though I figure this doesn't help get your account on PS Plus but you will be able to play the games. Hopefully you'll be able to get PS Plus for yourself later on but if you can't you'll just have to do it this way and your brother's account will get the games since he has Plus.

PlayStationPlus,357xyg,PokemasterTT,7,Thu May 7 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"I am finding Race The Sun a perfect Vita game. Short game-time and high replayability. Couldn't really see myself sitting down infront of my tv to play it, but perfect for the handheld while on the john."
PlayStationPlus,357xyg,BOT-Brad,3,Thu May 7 23:29:16 2015 UTC,This. Exactly what I was saying to my friend playing it yesterday. It has vita written all over it.
PlayStationPlus,357xyg,stevosaurous,1 point,Fri May 8 06:40:32 2015 UTC,I found that I did better on the vita as well
PlayStationPlus,357xyg,Blackash99,3,Wed May 13 03:41:35 2015 UTC,"I've played and finished Unfinished Swan on both PS3 and Vita. There wasn't really any difference. Performance was completely fine. I suppose the console version may feel a little better because of the higher resolution and the controller is more comfortable (you have to use the shoulder buttons/triggers almost exclusively, which can be a bit of a pain when done for extended periods on the Vita). But that's really down to your personal preference."

I may try this on Ps4.  -Unfinished Swan I choose to play on PS4 and I think it's a better fit there than Vita would be, so far loving it.    -Hohokum I installed on both, but only played on Vita. I'm probably only going to play this game one more time then call it. It's was fun for a bit but the gameplay is a bit too abstract to pull me away from other things I want to play."
PlayStationPlus,357xyg,melfinastarwind,1 point,Thu May 7 23:34:34 2015 UTC,"I've found Race the Sun quite hard to control with a PS4 controller. Perfect on the Vita, where the lesser range of motion in the sticks, works as an advantage."

PlayStationPlus,357xyg,Urabutbl,1 point,Tue May 12 19:40:40 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion- Hohokum and Race the Sun are both amazing on PS4, especially with the lights out and a headset in. The sound effects and music on RTS get me so into it and pumped, and the colors and abstract-ness of Hohokum in complete dark is an experience. EDIT: I now realize you don't have a PS4, but it still stands for PS3"
PlayStationPlus,357xyg,RawrCat,1 point,Tue May 19 00:11:14 2015 UTC,"I pretty much always go Vita if I can. I can play it in bed, on the bus and on the toilet. Also, quite a few games are just better on the Vita. It's DEFINITELY true versus PC, but even against the PS4/PS3, most of the rogue-likes are just better in short bursts (like on a bus journey) rather than ""making a night of it"". Oh, and Hotline Miami is just easier to control on the Vita, it' the best version hands down."

PlayStationPlus,356cdr,Comaburr,2,Thu May 7 14:16:19 2015 UTC,I've been a member of PS+ since it first became available; and the only thing that comes to mind that I have seen is that Sony decided that PS+ would not be an additional requirement for MMORPGs on the PS4; and that it would be up to the publisher to decide to charge a fee for online access or not.

One thing that does undermine the value of the service is often the free games were part of sales earlier.  Unfinished Swan, for example, was something like 3 bucks in a sale 2-3 months ago.  That's a lot closer to free than the suggested retail of 15 bucks.  Edit:  No knocking Unfinished Swan, btw.  It's a great experience and is a perfect fit for PS Plus."
PlayStationPlus,351did,jbonejimmers,2,Wed May 6 12:48:01 2015 UTC,"Are you getting the Vita games too? They've offered a really nice selection, and if you end up getting one down the line you'll already have a pretty big library."

PlayStationPlus,351did,jbonejimmers,1 point,Wed May 6 18:57:45 2015 UTC,Sales are a part if the value too though. Most of the games I've played are not the ones they give us but the ones I get on sale.
PlayStationPlus,351did,NotReallyASnake,40,Thu May 7 01:37:58 2015 UTC,"Problem:  The PS+ system is backwards, and heres why; Those who buy no games, get rewarded most. PS+ does not compensate for those who already own the games that are offered. So if you are a well paying customer, you get rewarded fewer free games. Spent full retail price on a game that ends up on PS+ a month later? Tough titty, that ll teach you to spend money in our store! Basically it rewards those who don't spend a dime the most.  Solution:  Ive pitched the idea before, but I think the PS+ program should just give everyone a monthly ""game token"" allowance, along with a list of games that are eligible for token purchase that month. Big games cost more tokens than smaller ones, and you can save up your tokens as well. Everybody would get an equal worth out of their membership, even if you already own a few games, and even if you don't own multiple platforms (Vita-only owners could focus their tokens on vita titles, etz.)"
PlayStationPlus,351did,Sokonomi,19,Wed May 6 11:31:21 2015 UTC,"I like your idea, but I'm not sure if I agree with your premise of it being broken. I buy a lot of games, mostly mid-tier and AAA games. With plus, almost all of the games aren't something I would have bought on my own. In the 2+ years I've been a PS+ member, I could count maybe 6 games that I already owned (paid for)."
PlayStationPlus,351did,judgedeath2,2,Wed May 6 13:26:15 2015 UTC,I have atleast 10 games in my library that I bought prior to PS+ pooping them out. Maybe I just had a run of bad luck. Though if given the choice I would skip all the indie sprite crap and save my tokens for nicer games. The vita has been drowning in it..

I really wanted to play Gravity Rush ever since it came out, but couldn't justify the, what, $300+ (or however much the Vita cost at the time) purchase just for that one game.  But over a year of PlayStation Plus I've gotten so many free Vita games just sitting there, and there were a number of indie games that, even if available on PS3 or other systems I owned, I would rather play on the go. So I finally took the plunge using my Christmas money at the beginning of this year. Quite a worthwhile purchase, and I've yet to even buy a single retail cartridge game."

PlayStationPlus,351did,yanggmd,2,Wed May 6 15:56:09 2015 UTC,"This is so bad for advertisement of PS+,  Terrible honestly.  It's one thing to say ""Give us 50 dollars, we give you THESE games"" and ""Give us 50 dollars and we'll give you tokens that let you save up and buy games""  The second line sounds like a complete scam to anyone who doesn't look into it.  And then there's also the fact that Sony likely do not have legal ground or put Developers/Publishers into a hold in which they can sell their games for virtual ""tokens"".  Everyone would save up their coins until they could get Day One AAA games and instead of the Service looking like ""You payed 50 Dollars to us, you received One game in total"" which would destroy all marketing of the service that has been worked up...  And then there's the issue that Indie Developers are not benefiting from the Token System at all, I'm not completely certain how the system works but I'm certain that Indie Devs would not be getting a fair pay from Sony.  Part of the reason people feel good about PS+ is because they feel like they're getting ""free games"". It's an illusion that they're getting ""free"" things even though they're paying for a service and wouldn't ever buy the games their getting to begin with, a Token system sounds straight up stressful.  While that might sound better to the Average Hardcore gamer, it'd sound terrible to the average consumer and absolutely terrible to Sony who have to market a Token system without sounding like they're Scamming people."
PlayStationPlus,351did,kagnit,0,Thu May 7 02:27:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's more realistic for Sony to have a system where a PS+ subscribers are rewarded a certain number of points for owning a game digitally or beating it (based on earning a trophy) before it ends up in the IGC. Those points can then be spent on a small selection of games, DLC, themes, and avatars on the PS Store. 1 point = 1 cent. If you don't have enough points to purchase an item, you can pay the rest with your PSN wallet money.  Example: Dishonored was free for PS3 last month. PS+ members who already bought it on PSN get 300 points. Those who earned the trophy Resolution (You completed the game.) get 50. Story DLC could be 500-1000 points, themes 200-300 points, and avatars 10-100 points.  This encourages people to buy a game even if they think it'll end up on PS+ eventually and to spend money on DLC a while after they've finished the main game since they're potentially getting a significant discount on it."
PlayStationPlus,351did,IllIllIII,2,Wed May 6 23:01:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, atleast SOME form of alternative incase you already bought what is in the IGC would be nice. Whenever an A game finally DOES decide to show up in IGC, more often than not I already bought it."
PlayStationPlus,351did,Sokonomi,0,Thu May 7 06:15:15 2015 UTC,What if someone doesn't care about trophy s
PlayStationPlus,351did,Neillpaddy,0,Mon May 11 04:16:52 2015 UTC,"The trophy is for completing the game. It's not something you go out of your way to earn. It also wouldn't give you many points since it's possible to automatically unlock trophies if you have a modded PS3. There are probably other ways Sony could reward PS+ subscribers, but these are some ideas that popped into my head."
PlayStationPlus,351did,IllIllIII,18,Tue May 12 20:04:51 2015 UTC,"That would be really awesome if I actually wanted all of those games.  You're suggesting PS+ is worth over $1000 a month USD but that's only true for the rare few who never buy any of the games you offer when they come out, play them all to completion, and love every minute of it.    For me, the $50 a year I pay gets me a few hundred dollars worth of games I was unsure about when they were released.  It's still worth it for now, but probably won't work for archiving my favorites into the future.  If I had to pay $50 a year for continued access to the old classics that still mean something to me, like Super Mario World, Metroid Prime, or every Zelda ever released (among others), eventually it would be much more cost effective to buy a used copy than to continue with a subscription service that has no guaranteed future.  What happens when Sony decides to quit supporting the PS3?  Can I no longer play the games I discovered and loved through their service?  Will I be allowed offline access at any time in 10-20 years?  It may sound like a long time that shouldn't matter, but it's not, and it does.    I've yet to see these questions seriously addressed, let alone answered adequately.  Next year may be cheaper for me to buy copies of the games I loved like Tomb Raider and Brothers than to continue paying for access.  I don't know."
PlayStationPlus,351did,SlendersSuit,4,Wed May 6 09:34:16 2015 UTC,"For $50 bucks I got a couple of games that I would have bought anyways: injustice, trine and a few more. Is it an amazing deal? No because I don't have nor want a ps3 and ps4. But since I have a ps4 and a vita, it's worth it."

PlayStationPlus,351did,ToasterP,4,Wed May 6 11:13:30 2015 UTC,"I don't expect AAAs often, but my problem with the people who say we shouldn't expect them ever, is the fact that Sony promised a ""full AAA game minus a few cars and tracks"" literally on day 1 of the console coming out.  They made that promise in order to justify + being a requirement for online. It's the only reason people accepted it.   Then driveclub never came, still a year later didn't come, now 6 more months later and still no game. We've had 1 AAA game since and it was a port from old gen."

PlayStationPlus,351did,arcarsination,6,Wed May 6 13:59:36 2015 UTC,"Notes * The platform totals include all games for each platform (the monthly 2 games + Cross-Buy versions). That’s why the sum of the platform totals is higher than the total value. * American PS+ subscribers received 2 more PS3 (retail)games: Sly Cooper - Thieves in Time (June 2014) and Dragon’s Crown (August 2014). Sly Cooper was offered to European subscribers in April 2014 and is therefore not listed on this image. Only the Vita version of Dragon’s Crown was part of the European PS+. * Dragon’s Crown isn’t a Cross-Buy game, but both the PS3 and PS Vita version were offered to American PS+ subscribers. Therefore the monthly dollar total for August includes the prices of both versions (PS3: $49.99/PS Vita: $39.99). * Rainbow Moon isn’t a Cross-Buy game, but the Cross-Save bundle, which includes both the PS3 and PS Vita version of the game, was offered to PS+ subscribers. Therefore the monthly total for October includes the bundle’s price ($22.49/€19.99/£15.99). The PS3’s and PS Vita’s platform total includes the game’s regular price (each $14.99/€12.99/£9.99). * The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth isn’t a Cross-Buy game, but both the PS4 and PS Vita version were offered to PS+ subscribers. Therefore the monthly total for November includes the prices of both versions (each $14.99/€14.99/£11.99). * Spelunky released with PS+ on PS4, therefore it’s counted as a new release. The PS3 and PS Vita version were already available and aren’t counted as new releases. * InFamous: First Light is only available as a retail title in Europe, so technically American PS+ subscribers only received 1 PS4 retail title. * German subscribers received Gravity Crash Ultra (PS Vita, €6.99) instead of Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition (PS3/PS Vita, €9.99). * With Woah Dave!’s PS4 release in April, the game was offered again to PS+ subscribers. The game’s price is only included in January’s total. * [minis] Mighty Flip Champs! DX (PS3/PSP/PS Vita, $5.99) was offered as an extra to American PS+ members. It’s not included in the image overview. * The PS3 and PS Vita (still in development) version of Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee - New ‘n’ Tasty are counted as new releases. * Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee – New ‘n’ Tasty launched in Europe originally at €20.99/£17.99. With the PS3 version’s release the price was changed to €19.99/£14.99. The original price is used in the calculations."

PlayStationPlus,351did,ColinZealSE,7,Thu May 7 08:04:45 2015 UTC,"First of all: Very nicely done, it's a great overview!   In my eyes however, you can't slap 19,99€ on something like Tower of Guns or Olli Olli and act like this is a fair price. Yes, it is the price it claims to be on the PS Store, but no one in the right mind would pay this much. Those are games you can play for free on Kongregate, hell Kongregate offers better titles.   It's still a good deal but not THAT good of a deal. It comes down to personal preference, most people won't play/enjoy all of the games anyway, so for them only the games they did play count. Last year was disappointing but I still got my money's worth so I am not going to complain. Some of the games were fantastic, most weren't. People do have a right to complain, though, as they are paying money for what they get. Some months, like May for instance, are worth nothing to me. I wouldn't pay 50 cents for any of those games let alone the full price. But I am glad others enjoy them.  tl;dr: PS Plus is a really good deal, even if 5/6 games are shit. Just not as good as this overview makes it look. You can slap 19,99€ on a piece of shit but that still doesn't mean I get 19,99€ out of the deal."

PlayStationPlus,351did,donkeygoat6699,2,Wed May 6 15:12:31 2015 UTC,"Of course, every game/month is subjective, but if you had been a ps+ member for a while, you already had gotten Velocity Ultra (I realize 2X added a whole new aspect of the game, but 50% of it was very familiar).  Plus, having Sports Friends as a ps+ game was kinda bullshit."
PlayStationPlus,351did,TheGallifreyan,0,Wed May 6 15:34:09 2015 UTC,Bad year of games.
PlayStationPlus,351did,reaper527,2,Wed May 6 16:55:48 2015 UTC,"I know, right? This $1,354 worth of games is a total rip off for the $60 we pay."
PlayStationPlus,351did,TheGallifreyan,1 point,Wed May 6 16:58:38 2015 UTC,"the games only have value if they are something you would have considered getting anyways.  also, lets not forget that the majority of the indie spam is old pc games that were routinely available for 99cents each long before coming to ps4."
PlayStationPlus,351did,Beckawk,3,Wed May 6 17:08:07 2015 UTC,"the games only have value if they are something you would have considered getting anyways.   I disagree. I am often open a PS+ game I don't think I'll like and I end up enjoying it a lot. That is my favorite part of the service, getting good games that I would have never gotten on my own."
PlayStationPlus,351did,Dingus4000,1 point,Wed May 6 17:17:44 2015 UTC,"This. PS+ lets me try games I wouldn't usually spend money on or even give a second look. Some of them are awful, some of them are winners. You're not gonna appeal to everyone's tastes. For one, I hated Injustice and didn't even finish the tutorial because it was already shaping up to be bullshit I didn't like."
PlayStationPlus,351did,shadowmoses316,0,Wed May 6 22:37:45 2015 UTC,"I started PS Plus in January, and used a 7 day trial to get November and December games before that.   I play on PS4 only, (I do not own a Vita or PS3), and of the 16 games I have received before this month, here are some of my thoughts. Keep in mind this is all my opinion, and I probably have different tastes in games to a lot of you.  I have tried 10 of the 16 games: Injustice, Isaac, First Light, Swapper, Transistor, Apotheon, Rogue Legacy, Valiant Hearts, OlliOlli2 and Tower of Guns.   Of the 10, I stopped playing 2 (Tower of Guns and Injustice), and enjoyed 8 enough to keep playing. I 100%'d 1 (Infamous First Light), and finished story mode of 6 of them (I'm not going to count Isaac, as I haven't found all endings.)  First Light and Transistor are my top two picks. Infamous was my first platinum, and while not a good storyline the open world + neon lasers were enough to keep me hooked. Transistor IMO, has the best soundtrack of any of the free games from the last 6 months (PS4 only, remember). It has solid mechanics, a decent storyline and nice strategy elements.   The Swapper I found intriguing, and the puzzles were some of the most difficult I've had to face in a while (near the end), so that is my third top game.   Valiant Hearts is decent, but I found it too repetitive at points, which disengaged me. (It did have an interesting finish though). I found the game a little long, and would have preferred they cut it slightly. OlliOlli2 I didn't finish, the controls are tough to get a handle of, and while I enjoyed it, it didn't keep me hooked for long. Rogue Legacy, The binding of Isaac are slow work, and require some lucky and patience. Rogue felt a little grindy as well tbh. Apotheon was average, good enough to finish but not good enough for me to ever play it again.   My overall analysis is that from the 4 months this year, I would have been satisfied paying for Infamous First Light, The Swapper, and Transistor. The others that I finished I enjoyed, but not enough that I would pay for the experience (Isaac and Valiant Hearts would be close).  I'm paying $70 Australian a month, and in the first third of the year I've gotten 3 games I would pay money for. If I get 9 in a year like that I'll be very happy. If you've made it this far, let me know what you've enjoyed this year. :)"
PlayStationPlus,351did,Beckawk,0,Wed May 6 15:46:45 2015 UTC,"PS4 only had 1 retail game. Injustice, not 2."
PlayStationPlus,351did,unknownone32,1 point,Wed May 6 18:09:57 2015 UTC,"Infamous: First Light is a retail game, albeit a short one. At least in Europe and Australia."
PlayStationPlus,351did,dejonarationx,0,Wed May 6 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"Ok here is my problem with this. If you didn't join PS+ until a month or so ago your really screwed out it. From what I keep hearing your only going to see the game free once. In my instance great I lost out on Batman, Dead Space 3, Crysis 3, and countless others.   So what do I have to look forward to as being a PS+ member? 85% of Indie games don't interest me at all. It's cool if they do for you but they don't for me I just find them boring for myself. Plus I'm a PS3 owner so don't need it for the MP, I have an external drive so cloud does nothing for me.   This isn't a bash towards PS+ because for people who love Indie games this is the best feature ever. But for people like myself can anyone tell me what they service does for me? I mean is there a chance that Batman will ever again become free on PS+?"
PlayStationPlus,351did,Dooder39,-7,Thu May 7 03:27:53 2015 UTC,"Nice work, but First Light isn't retail."

PlayStationPlus,351y0l,willgeld,13,Wed May 6 12:52:20 2015 UTC,"Same here. Also, does the ""Unreal Engine 4"" logo appear very choppy to anybody else? Everything else runs fine, even the game, but it feels like the console struggles to play that 3 second animation."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,MightyGreenPanda,19,Wed May 6 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"Hey MightyGreenPanda, we're working on the UE4 logo - apologies about the FPS - We're only able to but a certain size video as the splash and we tried a bunch of different formats but the results kept coming out sub par. We're in touch with Epic and we'll be sure to get that video polished up for you :)"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,3,Wed May 6 16:53:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! I'm glad that you're getting feedback from the community!  Let me say that other than the loud noise on the PS4 and this (really small and nitpicky) issue with the UE4 logo, I'm having a great time with the game, definetely one of the most pleasant surprises I've had lately with PS+, and I'm getting some BioShock vibes from it, which is always good.  EDIT: I just saw your comments about the update, I'm currently downloading it and I'll update this comment if I notice any changes.  EDIT 2: Just installed the update. There's still noise and the PS4 is still getting hot, but it's much, much better than it was before. Also, looks like a small visual bug at the beginning of the game when interacting with the appointment list has been fixed too."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,MightyGreenPanda,5,Wed May 6 17:32:25 2015 UTC,Thanks - I'll be leaving this thread open so I'll be sure to refresh to see if you're experiencing further issues. The UE4 logo won't be updated in this patch but hopefully will be in the next update. Thanks for the compliment also :) Very kind of you.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,3,Wed May 6 17:53:42 2015 UTC,Are certain items not allowed to be saved on shelves?  Or is that a bug? I had my raisins and tobacco tin disappear between the first projector and being teleported back.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,etphonecomb,3,Wed May 6 21:48:49 2015 UTC,Hey etphonecomb - that's definitely a bug - we've noticed certain items weren't saving for some reason however we've fixed this in a patch yesterday so look out for the update in your SCE territory! Let us know if anything else goes wrong once you've updated the game. There's a chance comments could slip through the cracks on reddit as I can't catch them all so feel free to tweet directly at us @whitepapergames or email for any issues! Apologies again :)
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,2,Thu May 7 07:57:36 2015 UTC,"I will install the patch and follow the twitter handle.  Thank you for being involved in the community!  It's always nice to see a dev interacting with people directly.  Also, I  love your game!  Keep up the awesome work!"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,etphonecomb,1 point,Thu May 7 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"i just completed the game and never received any trophies after the ""rembrandt repairer"" trophy. Really enjoyed the game, very powerful ending and will be back to solve all puzzles :)"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,emphaticus,2,Fri May 8 22:13:49 2015 UTC,"Hope you don't mind me responding here.  Have quite an annoying bug whereby I picked up two items in quick succession and immediately pressed triangle to warp back to the case. Now I permanently have a floating beer stein in my game! Tried restarting but had no luck, will probably just restart as I'm only a couple hours in, just thought I would share.  Love the game btw it is a great change of pace, and the writing is excellent."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,bendtosquares,4,Thu May 7 07:51:14 2015 UTC,Oh wow bendtosquares - I've never heard of this - how do you manage to pick up items in quick succession? I wouldn't have thought that would be possible. If you can't remove the floating beer (which I don't think is ever a bad thing ;) ) you could try changing levels and see if that removes the item for you. I think this is so super specific that we may not be able to fix the issue but I'll see if I can reproduce picking up a bunch of items quickly. Thanks for the kind words and sorry about your weird bugs - I'll look into it! :)
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,2,Thu May 7 07:59:38 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks a lot for your speedy response!  I was actually able to reproduce the issue just now, thought to save a video clip of it this time as well so I hope this helps. It only seemed possible if I had no items on me at first, and then tried to pick up two items quickly. Wasn't possible to place the glass onto the shelf in the Case.   Here's the clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kFmRIa77tk  Thanks again!"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,bendtosquares,2,Thu May 7 08:29:04 2015 UTC,Oh excellent! That video helps me out A LOT! I'll be sure to look into this now - Sorry for the bug and I'm even sorrier than the beer was empty! :(
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,2,Thu May 7 10:04:33 2015 UTC,"Haha, its not a problem!  Sorry to bother you again but there are a couple other things I thought I should mention:   I think there is an issue with the game keeping progress of how many projectors you have restored. I have 5 unlocked downstairs in the Case, but the map only tells me I have done 3, which isn't possible as I went back around Pinwheel Harbour and all 4 are done + the very first in Devlin Mine. The middle shelf to the left and behind the chair will not allow you to place any items on it. Film reels 1&11 are available as soon as you first enter the Case. If you aim your crosshair in a certain position you can pick them up through the storage units.   Sorry, I'll leave you alone now! lol"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,bendtosquares,3,Thu May 7 11:12:55 2015 UTC,Thanks! The 'projectors' solved issue is definitely fixed in this patch. Found the middle shelf bug from someone mentioning it yesterday - fixed also! (It was something I changed last minute - silly me!). I've also stopped people from being sneaky and picking up the reels from the side of the casings! Haha. Thanks for the feedback and feel free to throw more my way when you have it (Ideally after the patch so we know what's fixed and what isn't! :) )
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,4,Thu May 7 13:20:00 2015 UTC,"This might be really dumb, but the only two games with the Unreal 4 logo that I have are this and Daylight, and both seem to have poor framerate issues.   I understand this isn't connected."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,boogitydogbutt,3,Wed May 6 22:36:25 2015 UTC,Hey boogitydogbutt - Is this just on the opening video or in the game also? The video we're working on - it's an issue with the PS4 video not accepting a high def video and so we have to adjust the quality to LOOK good but without the file size - we're going to try a few more options and make sure we get it looking nice and polished - sorry if this is detracting from the game - I assure you it's our fault and not on the UE4 end. If you're having issues in game then please do let me know where you're experiencing those issues - I've noticed on some twitch streams if people are spending a long time in 1 area the frame rate can start to drop however going to the PS menu and then back in the game seems to reset it. I'm not sure why this is the case but we're currently looking into it.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,3,Thu May 7 08:03:27 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm afraid to play this game.. Within 2 mins of loading in my ps4 was ready to journey to the moon..  Really wanted to try this game but even after cleaning my ps4 the game is just putting to much stress on my ps4 to be worth playing  BTW got stuck in the chair upon first sitting in the chair.. On the loading screen.. Frozen. I booted up.. The person said look around and get familiar and thats when my ps4 fans kicked in.. Over drive

PlayStationPlus,351y0l,JoshuaH,4,Wed May 6 14:41:11 2015 UTC,"This might contain some spoilers!  To the developer reading this thread,  I downloaded the game this afternoon and played for about 2 hours and was definitely having fun! Then when I got in the mine area and after descending with the elevator at some point I wasn't able to teleport back to ""the case"" anymore, so I decided to save and restart the game. When I was back at the Playstation menu I got a notification that an update file started to download for the game. I thought, well that might solve some problems, so I waited for it to download and install and then booted up the game again. When I loaded my save file I spawned back at the beginning of the first area again, so where you first enter the simulated memory world. All the things I had previously done in that place were still done and I went back into the mine. The water in the mine was gone like after you activate the machine with the valves, but the gate to the elevator was closed. The valves on the machine were still in the right positions but when switching the lever nothing happened. After setting one of the levers to off and then on again and pulling the lever the machine activated again and the gate to the elevator opened (took longer then the first time to open but oh well) but I couldnt switch the lever for the elevator to go down again. So.. I had to delete my save file and start over again. I am now in the harbor village and everything seems fine but I do have some framerate issues now. Also I found a gold key with two people on it and when I got to the two toy boats (on the way to the gate) and trying to interact with them the key somehow comes up and when trying to interact again the key dissapears into the ground in a manner like your setting it down on a table. So that's some weird stuff. Trying to fix some framerate issues and the key thing I saved the game again before restarting it and it the save file said 30 minutes played while in the meanwhile I had already been playing for at least 2 hours again. Then when trying to get back to the Playstation menu to close the game some weird thing happened. It crashed (the game I think) and I got a progress bar of the Playstation trying to restore some corrupt files and then an error code. When restarting the game the framerate was fixed but the key thing still happened, though this time when pressing L1 I didnt get an item description for the boats anymore. There were more little bugs but I cant remember those except in the room where you find the wrench, binoculairs, gasmask and magnifying glass there is a note that is readable without opening it and when opening it a name in it is spelled differently, but thats nothing to worry about, just something I noticed. I also have the same problem as most other people with the PS4 making a lot of noise and getting quite hot. I hope youre able to push out a patch soon fixing some of the problems, cause I'm having a blast with the game! If it wasn't for my brother wanting to see a soccer match on tv I would still be playing it after already playing for 5 or 6 hours! Haha. I think it's great you're reading this and listening to the poeple here :) Have a good day!"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,EmperorBread,2,Wed May 6 19:03:57 2015 UTC,"Hey EmperorBread - Thank you SO MUCH for the detailed description of everything you're having issues with - it helps me out a lot when trying to locate these things.   It seems as though the patch fixed the first few issues so I'll skip over that (Im glad to hear!). I wasn't aware that you could place the key into the ground by the boats but I totally know how this could be a bug so I've noted it down and I'll go and fix it straight after to replying to your comment. I know where the note is you're mentioning so I'll fix that too - didn't know about that one either!  The framerate seems to be the most serious issue here. And yes, as you've noticed, if you go to the PS menu then back into the game it magically resets the framerate - I honestly have no idea how this can happen as you'd think it would be in the game so we're looking into this but at least that's a temporary fix for now. I'm curious though, do you know what model of PS4 you have? As in, did you get it when the PS4 was first released? It's obviously not an issue with your hardware and instead, with our game but we're trying to repro it on our end and it doesn't happen for us. Sony haven't mentioned anything either when they've tested it so I think that one will be on-going but we will try to isolate the issue and get it fixed for you guys.  Thanks again for the awesome detailing of your issues and if you have any more feel free to tweet directly at us @whitepapergames or drop me an email as sometimes the Reddit comments can slip my attention (although I am trying to catch them all!)."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Thu May 7 08:10:12 2015 UTC,"No problem, glad to be of help ;) I got my PS4 in december 2014 so it's quite new. Also I just now ran into another problem. I filled in the post order letter on the table in one of the houses (filled in ""Baldrics"" and at quantity ""1"", don't know if that's the right info or if it has to do with anything), then put on the stamp and the paper slipped into the envelope, then the game crashed and the ps4 tried to restore some corrupt data again. Im going to try again now :)  EDIT: I tried again and it crashed again. The error code I get is ""CE-34878-0"". Hope that helps."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,EmperorBread,1 point,Thu May 7 10:01:59 2015 UTC,Thanks EmperorBread - I saw someone else post the same issue this morning - it seems to be whenever you're 'writing' stuff into the blank spaces (it's happening on other puzzles also) but it isn't happening for everyone. We're going to look at the code and try to get a fix for the issue - hopefully you've not lost too much progress by the crash. Thanks for keeping me updated.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Thu May 7 10:06:00 2015 UTC,"I think it was because my save file was corrupt. When loading the game again and doing something else (collecting a ribbon) it overwrote my save file and then I was able to do the post thing without it crashing. (Writing baldrics 1 was correct btw haha, I recieved one in a special delivery box hehe)"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,EmperorBread,1 point,Thu May 7 11:18:14 2015 UTC,"Hey :) Got a new bug. When I got into brimcliff mine and after doing some stuff like restorimg the projector, I set the dial for the cage to 380F and entered it. Got into some lower parts of the mine and after walking around a bit i went into the cage again to see if I could go up again. After pulling the lever it did indeed go up again but because I was just testing I pulled the lever again and it started going down again, but the door didn't open. So thats one bug I guess. Then I decided to go up cause that was the only choice I had and about halfway up I noticed the door on the opposite side of the lever was open. I wanted to see if i could walk out while still ascending and I could, but i just fell through the world (under the whole map) and ended up in a grey space where theres nothing. I can go back to ""the case"" but when returning to the world I'm still in that grey space. So I'm pretty much stuck here haha. I think i can upload a video of it for you since the ps4 automatically records. I'll update you on that.  Edit: Here it is:https://youtu.be/N8vk1NXiIlo"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,EmperorBread,1 point,Thu May 7 12:32:33 2015 UTC,Excellent! That is a great spot - I never tried interacting with the lever halfway up the lift so this is really useful - putting a fix for that in now. Thank you! Great job on the Baldrics however bad job by us on the save file - our programmer is working on that issue currently.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Thu May 7 13:22:08 2015 UTC,Hope you don't think I'm getting annoying with all these bugs but I found 2 more places where you can fall through the map. On 480F behind the machine with the red button and on 400F when you take a right after the bridge you can walk past the fallen mining carts at the end of that tunnel and you can walk right through the wall.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,EmperorBread,3,Thu May 7 14:21:21 2015 UTC,"Hey, not at all - thank you! I definitely wasn't aware of these issues so thank you for bringing them to my attention - they're easy fixes which is what I like! :)"

PlayStationPlus,351y0l,RandExt,2,Thu May 7 02:30:24 2015 UTC,Hey RandExt - really sorry about that issue. The patch we released yesterday should fix that and should be available in your territory very soon. It's only out in SCEE currently.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,3,Thu May 7 08:11:10 2015 UTC,"Yes it is, also has anyone had a problem with it crashing horribly? I'm now doomed because my auto save is just a giant error message."

PlayStationPlus,351y0l,ltcuetf,2,Fri May 8 00:14:32 2015 UTC,"I had my fan burn out and replaced it before. I noticed that when I first got my console (launch model) it was really loud, specifically the jet engine sound. When I replaced it the new can looked slightly different, had twice as many blades on it. Also now it is completely quiet. Like you can hear the disc drive over the fan up close and it seems to push out just as much air if not more. I'm wondering if you might just have the older style fan."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,RockTheShaz,5,Wed May 6 15:23:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, RockTheShaz! I'm definitely seeing this as a common theme on the game when people are complaining about fan noise. We'll do our best to narrow down this issue and get a fix in there for you guys."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,2,Wed May 6 16:57:45 2015 UTC,Oh I meant that it is probably a hardware issue more than a software issue. Mine burnt out a couple months ago and was making the jet engine noise no matter what I played. On a side note I'm excited to try out the game tonight the premise seems awesome and unique
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,RockTheShaz,1 point,Wed May 6 17:18:30 2015 UTC,Thanks RockTheShaz - there are definitely some things we can try out to reproduce it it's just hard because it doesn't happen on our PS4 machines so we're trying to isolate the issue. Thanks for the patience and be sure to grab the patch before you play as that may fix some of issues! :)
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,2,Thu May 7 08:12:20 2015 UTC,"I got stuck,  the character literally could not move,  at one point in the mine.  I had to restart the game :("
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,atli4,2,Wed May 6 21:20:56 2015 UTC,"Well then, looks like I won't be playing this game."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,TheGallifreyan,2,Wed May 6 16:51:33 2015 UTC,"From the sounds of it, maybe just hold off for a patch or two."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,esDragon,1 point,Fri May 15 20:48:04 2015 UTC,"Mine kicks on after a few minutes but it's nothing abnormal. Doesn't sound any more taxed than it does when playing Bloodborne or GTA, for example.  Edit: Nevermind. After about 10 minutes, it is running extremely hot and loud. Almost immediately after closing application the fan returns to normal. Wtf?"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,ChrisKerrigan,7,Wed May 6 13:34:21 2015 UTC,"Hey Chris, are you running the game with the patch or without? I've been jumping into a few streams and no one has complained about the fan however a few people in the chat did mention about their fans getting loud. I'm going to try and figure out why this issue is so inconsistent - are you able to tell me when you got your PS4? I'm not sure whether it's an issue with the model or what. We'll do our best to resolve it though :)"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Wed May 6 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!   My system is currently showing the game at version 1.00 and when I check for an update it says the application is on the latest version.   I purchased my PS4 about 15 months ago (can't remember the exact date, sorry) but I am on the latest PS4 firmware."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,ChrisKerrigan,1 point,Wed May 6 18:12:08 2015 UTC,OK thank Chris - I'm trying to find a common theme on the on the PS4's that it's happening on - really sorry that we don't have a quick fix for this one but we will make sure we work on trying to resolve it.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Thu May 7 08:14:08 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem, I turned it off because it seemed to be getting quicker and quicker it then returned to normal, strange."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Emjayblaze,1 point,Wed May 6 13:56:58 2015 UTC,Same here. Stopped playing last night because of it....
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,zerrafett,1 point,Wed May 6 13:50:30 2015 UTC,Yup. I've had my PS4 since release and it's never been so loud.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,6,Wed May 6 15:17:03 2015 UTC,"Hey zerrafett, I'm just confirming with Chris in the comment above about which PS4 he had but if you had yours since release then this could be a common theme - obviously it's our game and nothing to do with the hardware but it might make it easier for us to repro it and see exactly what's going on there. Thanks for the feedback!"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,zerrafett,2,Wed May 6 16:56:38 2015 UTC,No problem! Other than the weird fan issue and some minor glitches I'm enjoying the game. Good on you guys for being so hands on here with the community.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Wed May 6 20:39:21 2015 UTC,Trying to be zerrafett but please do let us know if there's anything else causing you issues! :)
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,OneOfDozens,1 point,Thu May 7 08:14:34 2015 UTC,yup. Can only compare it to the recent rocket league main menu which had the same issue. no other games have done it
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,synt4xg3n0c1d3,2,Wed May 6 15:40:04 2015 UTC,What about Transistor? Menus in that game make my ps4 fans go crazy. It's the reason I don't play it.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Ruzek,1 point,Wed May 6 20:41:42 2015 UTC,Same issue here as well. Makes me very nervous to play this game.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Hawk798,2,Wed May 6 15:48:33 2015 UTC,Good deal. I'll try the game out once I see a solid trophy guide. It looks interesting. The fact the Devs are responding and working hard on quick fixes after launch is a very good sign to me.

Around the 2 hour mark my PS4 started getting pretty hot and making noises, so I saved and put it into rest mode. It doesn't seem like the kind of game that could cause a lot of stress on the system...but who knows."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,strikercja,1 point,Thu May 7 08:15:16 2015 UTC,"So first off I think it's an amazing game. I played it yesterday for about 3 hours when it was available and had no problems what so ever, no crashes or a loud fan.  This probably will contain spoilers. When I wanted to continue playing today, I loaded my safe file. I was in the workshop of Bell and I decided to go back to the pub. Upon entering the audio cue played again and the game crashed. I started the game back up and tried it again and it crashed again. Before the update I didn't seem to have this problem."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Craigrofo,1 point,Wed May 6 19:53:51 2015 UTC,"Game crashed on credits screen when i completed it, trying again now to see f it happens again, but its about 15 mins between autosave and endIng so bloodh hope it doesnt happen again."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,SnakeyD2,1 point,Thu May 7 12:03:48 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is something that anyone else has noticed but I'm only getting stereo sound for this game. It really sucks you out of it a little, with surround it would be totally immersive. Is the game meant to only be in stereo or is there some surround sound bug going on? I'm in the EU and I've tried playing a blu ray on both linear pcm and bitstream options in both ps4 settings and the blu ray settings menus and the blu ray plays surround sound fine. I'm hooked up with HDMI to a fairly new Onkyo receiver. I'm also getting the loud fan issues as others have mentioned but I wouldn't say it's any different to other games really?"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,FaytesEnd,1 point,Thu May 7 17:19:22 2015 UTC,"Same issue, PS4 is getting very loud (only game that does this) and game seems to have low FPS. I""m having a hard time playing more than 15 minutes as I'm starting to feel sick. Not sure if its the motion blur or low FPS. I like the game so far too, shame."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,NecroLazarus,1 point,Thu May 7 20:16:53 2015 UTC,"Been looking for a place to ask this, but does anyone know how to teleport back to areas you've previously been to?  I've seen videos where you highlight the harbour text in the map and then it asks you if you want to teleport there.  I've been trying for ages now but when I go to press harbour text it just disappears!  Any help would be appreciated!  Thanks,"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,EmperorBread,1 point,Fri May 8 02:38:41 2015 UTC,Same. I can't interact with it too and sometimes areas just dissapear or become black. Didn't know it was a bug though.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Sat May 9 11:48:03 2015 UTC,Hey NecroLazarus & EmperorBread - you should be able to walk back to each area through the gates if you're needing to return to an area. We have also noticed an issue with the map board not working the way it's supposed to so we're going to make sure it's fixed in a future patch update.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,NecroLazarus,1 point,Sat May 9 20:26:26 2015 UTC,"Hi Thanks for this.  I think the issue is that I'm at a point of no return,  I've collected the last ribbon in the Village and gone back to the case.  I'm technically at the end of the game and all I have to do is hit that music box on Village Door.  I've tried back tracking to the Industrial zone, but then after a minute of me walking it sends me straight in to the Lounge Room as though I'd pressed the music box!  Looks like I'm going to have to start from the beginning now.  A bit of a pain  > <"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Sun May 10 10:27:13 2015 UTC,Hey NecroLazarus - I'm not entirely sure if you will have to play from the beginning once the patch comes out. It sounds like you have a couple of different things going wrong so I couldn't say for sure but if it's just a music box issue then that should work with the patch. Let me know how you get on and if it works for you after the patch. Sorry for the delay in getting it out to you!
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,NecroLazarus,1 point,Sun May 10 11:17:53 2015 UTC,Apologies only got around to testing again last night.  I am on version 1.001 and it still has the same issues.  I'm going to start again and hopefully get that plat this time!
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Mon May 11 07:00:28 2015 UTC,"Hey NecroLazarus, no problem! I totally understand there's a million more important things to do than play Ether! Haha. Let me know how you get on!"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Wed May 13 11:28:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was already concerned.. until I found this thread (I have the latest update). The fan blasts at FULL ALMIGHTLY POWER since the first seconds of gameplay (in the hall), after 1-2 minutes it decreases a little but its still very noisy (maybe fans are at 70% speed)"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Chef_Lebowski,2,Wed May 13 18:28:39 2015 UTC,Hey almostnothuman - apologise about the late reply on this one. The thread slipped my attention even though I was responding on the other threads so sorry about that!  We've been made aware of the fan issue and we've been trying to isolate the issue since we can't reproduce it on our end. It won't be fixed in the patch coming this week however we'll be sure to keep an eye on it and try to get it fixed for the next update.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Sun May 10 22:46:50 2015 UTC,"NP and thanks! Kudos to you for the support and the involvement with the community, I wish you the best.  FWIW I'm investigating my new PS4 too, Ether One was kinda the first game I tried on my new console, so I couldn't compare to other games at the time of my writing. But today I tried BF4 and some other demos. They don't make my PS4 roar like Ether did, so I think we can rule out some critical defect on my fan or heatsink. But even if less loud, my ps4 is still a tad noisy, someone says they can't hear theirs whereas I can hear mine from 2-3m on the couch while playing, I'll definitely keep an eye on that, it could be slightly defective too, who knows. Cheers!"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,rojocapo610,1 point,Thu May 14 08:20:56 2015 UTC,"Nope, but goddamn this game is super buggy. I'm further up Pinwheel town and I can walk through rocks and walls and I even fell through the in-game map forever lol. There are actually numerous spots in this game where you can walk through it. Sounds like the devs just didn't give a fuck about it after they released it last year lol."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,2,Thu May 14 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"Hey Chef_Lebowski - we definitely are trying to track down every comment people make and I'm so sorry I missed this thread - I was keeping on top of other threads but this one slipped my focus. We've listened to everyone's issues over the last week and we've put a patch fix in place which should be coming to you in the next couple of days.   The reason behind their being a bunch of new issues is that we released on PC last year in Unreal Engine 3. We had to re-create the entire game in Unreal Engine 4 for the PS4 release. We thought we had caught all the bugs in time but as is the case with most games, as soon as you release to 20million+ people there is more play testing in the first few hours of release than was ever done on the game. The specific issue about being able to walk through the walls was a very weird one as the walls block on our editor but as soon as we pushed it out to a console release build they would disappear. We've re-added the collisions for the walls so they should be fixed in the patch. Thanks again for the feedback and your issues should be fixed very soon."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,rojocapo610,1 point,Mon May 11 02:30:13 2015 UTC,"Yes !! i was worried and pulled my ps4 out and put it near a window to vent , thinking it was heating . I shut this game off and it went right back to normal. So this game sure is making the fan work really hard.might not even start ths on again just in case."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Thu May 14 08:11:06 2015 UTC,Hey rojocapo610 - thank you for making us aware. Unfortunately we weren't able to solve this issue for the patch that's going out in the next couple of days however we're still looking into this. We're not able to reproduce this on our end through our devkits and we've tried playing the game on our consoles at home and it doesn't seem to happen. I'm thinking it might be isolated to some of the launch consoles. It's definitely not an issue with your console and its 100% our game - we're just trying to find the right circumstances to reproduce the issue so do you think you have a release console? Thanks for the feedback!
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Northern_Chiliad,1 point,Tue May 12 14:29:20 2015 UTC,Thank you for the reply. Yes it is a release console. Check it out on one of those if you have. Sad i'm scared to play this because the game looks fun.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,esDragon,1 point,Thu May 14 08:06:18 2015 UTC,Yeah that seems to be a consistent issue with release consoles - we'll definitely try and get our hands on one to check it out. Thanks for letting us know! :)
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,enekomh,1 point,Thu May 14 16:13:54 2015 UTC,"Yup, and it's not even a pretty game or graphically stellar.  It's also not a good game in general."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,pabulous,1 point,Thu May 14 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe that is a taste issue, because I've been enjoying it a tonne. It's definitely getting to me, on an emotional level, and I love the gameplay. Sure it's not as slick as a AAA game, but it's got it where it counts (for me, anyway)."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,muteownz,1 point,Thu May 14 10:14:53 2015 UTC,"I was on the title screen and I realized there was a huge noise coming from somewhere. I though it was my laptop, then my girlfriends and finally I realized it was the PS4. Closed the game, uninstalled it. End of the problem."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Fri May 15 20:46:46 2015 UTC,"Hi, I just started this game today (and installed the patch) and it's really intriguing so far but I've noticed the same issue. It's not extremely loud, but it is noticeable, and sort of detrimental to the serene, otherworldly vibe the game seems to be going for. I don't have a launch PS4, I have one of the later ""glacier white"" models, but mine doesn't sound like what I'd describe as a ""jet engine"", however it is noisier than any other game I've played so far. I'm glad that it's something you're looking into and I'm impressed that you're keeping in touch with your audience like this."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Dcook212,1 point,Thu May 14 22:22:59 2015 UTC,New here hope i'm posting this correctly but anyways i have a brand new just bought the other day PS4 and this game makes my system so loud i just can't stand it.  other games i have that came with they system like the last of us gets a bit noisy but this game seems to just set the fans to maximum all the time with no letting up.  again this is a brand new system and as soon as i load this game sounds like i'm vacuuming my room.  my system has plenty of room and it is set vertical due to space but honestly i doubt being vertical has anything to do with why this game makes my ps4 sound like its about to take off and fly out my window.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,pabulous,1 point,Fri May 15 09:26:21 2015 UTC,Hey muteownz - Thank you for posting and sorry I didn't see your message sooner!  Thanks for the information of your console edition - this is pretty worrying as previously we had only had reports of it happening on launch consoles but if yours is a brand new one it kind of throws an theories we had out of the window. I just bought a PS4 last week (To download my own game - sad I know). But it doesn't seem to be an issue for me so we're not sure what's causing it.   Thanks for letting us know though and we'll be sure to continue to monitor this issue - unfortunately it's not a quick fix though :(
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Fri May 15 19:48:25 2015 UTC,I enjoy playing this game but I can't continue as the PS4 sounds like it's struggling to keep cool. So until that is fixed I won't feel comfortable playing it again.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,pabulous,1 point,Mon May 18 10:31:23 2015 UTC,"Now I seem to be receiving an error message (CE-34878-0) every time I try to load my save, and the game closes. Between this and the noisiness of the PS4, I think I'm going to give this game a rest for now. =("
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Sun May 17 08:25:36 2015 UTC,Hey pabulous - I'm extremely sorry to hear this. Is this happening after the European patch update or are you still running the release build of the game from American & Canada?
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,CipherN7,1 point,Sun May 17 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"It happened after the EU patch. Fortunately I wasn't very far in the game so it wasn't a big deal to start again, it's just something you should probably be aware of."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,DraftingDave,1 point,Mon May 18 10:29:04 2015 UTC,Hey pabulous - yeah I really appreciate you posting! So did you start again? Have there been any issues so far?
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,1 point,Mon May 18 11:12:30 2015 UTC,I'm afraid to keep playing Ether One. I think my PS4 is gonna explode. I can play MGS ground Zeroes at 1080p 60fps and my PS4 is silent but Ether One make my PS4 hot and loud as hell.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,DraftingDave,0,Mon May 18 12:13:06 2015 UTC,I had/have the same problem with Hand of Fate.    It seems like these smaller titles are just not worrying about optimizing.
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,5,Sun Jul 12 22:53:28 2015 UTC,"Hey DraftingDave, we did our best to optimise the game. It seems to run fine on a development kit and we didn't notice any over-use of the fan. It could possibly be the older model fans that are causing it, and although obviously our games fault, it will help us narrow down where we're loosing optimisation. We'll keep working hard on making sure the game runs great for you guys it's just one of those situations where 5 guys in an indie studio can only do so much testing before it launches to the world and suddenly millions of people are playing! :)"
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,DerMuller,3,Wed May 6 16:00:36 2015 UTC,"we did our best to optimise the game.   I believe you, and I think I chose my words poorly.    A better way to say it is ""these smaller titles cannot dedicate the thousands of man hours larger Devs/Publishers do into optimizing/testing their AAA titles/engines.""    Plus, I'd rather you spend your time on the great dialogue :)    I can deal with a loud fan, and some stuttering during deck shuffles."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Pete_Bottomley,7,Wed May 6 16:59:39 2015 UTC,Haha no problem at all - I understood the intention behind your comment not to worry at all. We definitely want to create the best experience for you guys and no matter how good visuals/dialogue/audio is if the game is sucking performance it's very hard to look past. We will be sure to keep monitoring performances. One thing we have noticed is if people are spending prolonged period in a certain area the frame rate will drop however if you go to the PS menu and then back into the game it resets - very weird one which we're trying to track down :)
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,Smallkittenfeet,5,Wed May 6 17:42:09 2015 UTC,"Can I just say that this level of developer engagement/concern/transparency with the community is nothing short of commendable. Thank you for this--it's obvious you are listening. This is one reason why I love smaller teams of developers. I haven't had a chance to play the game yet, but I'm excited to when I get home today."
PlayStationPlus,351y0l,chokingduck,3,Wed May 6 17:55:55 2015 UTC,I think the industry as a whole needs to be super active - you guys are the onces spending your free time playing our games so it's important to us that it isn't frustrating for you and you can relax otherwise it's not a good use of your free time!

Apparently Sony has trouble updating their store on day one or at least takes them quite a long time to update which usually starts at 3PM Est, or 12PM Pacific. I usually check the ""New this week"" tab and usually they have one of the Plus games updated there, then I go to search each game individually in the search of course to go directly to the game and they'll will always be updated free but not listed in the Plus tab yet. Though last month took until the next day for games to update for some reason. But never count on Sony on Plus updates release day. Everything else they can update quick but for some reason they can't do it quick for Plus games. It's not until the next day when the games are completely listed as free and are being advertised."

PlayStationPlus,34xno5,PhillAholic,1 point,Fri May 15 00:06:00 2015 UTC,"It doesn't get that repetitive if you're cautious. The best thing about it is the fact that the alien has the best AI I've ever seen, and it always acts differently, so every time you die it's like you're doing another level.

I also live in North America and as a general rule I can always get a game at a local store for at least 20% less than the PS store digital price, and quite often I can get it for 40-60% cheaper locally.  At best a sale in the PS store brings the digital price down to match physical.  Digital prices being better than physical are the exception rather than the rule."
PlayStationPlus,34xno5,tbx5959,2,Tue May 5 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"I guess I should have specified ""North American PSN store"" vs. Canadian brick-and-mortar stores, specifically, where prices are generally abysmal.  If you have Guilty Gear Xrd - SIGN or Project Diva F 2nd in your neck of the woods for sub-$25 USD on disc, it is a Shangri-la of gaming consumerism compared to the rest of the word. I may have to do some cross-border shopping one of these days!"
PlayStationPlus,34xno5,CaptainPick1e,3,Tue May 5 18:12:48 2015 UTC,That's a big difference. Games are regularly cheap on disc than the PS store in the US. I've so far gone all digital and have paid more a couple times.

PlayStationPlus,34xno5,Spottybag,-1,Tue May 5 21:57:22 2015 UTC,"So, besides shit yearly release games, what is there that isn't an HD remake? Second Son, Shadow of Mordor, Dragon Age, Thief, Killzone, Knack, LBP3. Probably forgetting a couple, so let's say 4 more. So, 11 games, that aren't just rereleases on next gen or some shitty yearly title. Legitimate candidates are basically Killzone and Knack at this point. First Light was free just 4 months back so Second Son doesn't seem so plausible. LBP3 came out not too long ago, give it 2-4 years and that's free though.  Of the remakes only TLoU and Metro: 2033 really make much sense. Tomb Raider was already free on the PS3. So was Sleeping Dogs. I don't really see GTAV going free until GTA6 is being advertised at least... Getting a game like CoD or a sports game is fairly pointless cause that won't happen until the next year comes out/is one month away from coming out and the servers die anyways."

PlayStationPlus,34yd14,charlie4lyfe,3,Tue May 5 16:24:03 2015 UTC,Rogue Legacy is a great choice. Really approachable intro to Roguelike-ish games and a ton of fun.
PlayStationPlus,34yd14,humorlessNOOB,3,Tue May 5 17:37:19 2015 UTC,Me too but my favourite has to be apotheon. It was such a cool game and I really appreciate the art style and the gameplay mechanics.

PlayStationPlus,34yd14,chorgox,3,Tue May 5 22:43:11 2015 UTC,"Attention: not trolling here!!!, But what people found so special of that game, I like it the story of mom hearing voices and so on is really great, but i found the gameplay extremely stupid, and shallow I played twice for 15 minutes and still dont get whats is so great. seems to me is more a joke than a game itself. Can you tell me what keep you playing ? thanks"
PlayStationPlus,34yd14,jbonejimmers,3,Wed May 6 12:55:50 2015 UTC,"Every play through is different and given the variety of bosses, power ups, enemy types, each run requires different strategies. Little explanation behind power-ups so it's a lot of self-discovery. A lot of stuff to unlock/complete.   I also think It takes some time to really get ""into"" it.  For me it took failing miserably 5-6 times before I got some dope power-ups that made my run last longer.  Then once I started wrapping my head around how they work a lot of the strategic decisions made more sense and I started making better decisions.  From there my runs started to last longer, and everything got more addicting.  I can see how this game isn't everyone's cup of tea though."
PlayStationPlus,34yd14,chorgox,2,Wed May 6 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"great answer thanks!, I reckon the b&w pixelated hand drawing, and the little details like leaving all to the cat when he dies are cute, but the grphics of the game is nothing to write home .. i will give a couple of tries again, still a game that could have been made for the SNES :/"
PlayStationPlus,34yd14,jbonejimmers,1 point,Thu May 7 09:11:37 2015 UTC,"Graphically, totally looks like it could've been done on SNES.  It's definitely not a game that had a large budget, team, or length of development.  The graphics are definitely indicative of that.  The enjoyment you'll get won't be from any kind of immersion or storyline or impressiveness.  It'll be from a lot of the ""ah-ha"" moments as you figure out how certain power-ups and mechanics work.  If it ends up clicking for you... you'll get to the point where when you die, you'll say yourself, ""just one more run..."" over and over again."

PlayStationPlus,34yd14,jsm85,6,Tue May 5 17:04:06 2015 UTC,Yakuza 4. It just has so much content. It feels very familiar in being a 3rd person action game. But also very unique because its Japanese as fuck. I can't wait for the next game to come to ps4. It looks awesome.

PlayStationPlus,34upfy,Romiress,4,Mon May 4 18:43:44 2015 UTC,So you can stream PS3 games with stuttering and extreme input lag rather than just playing the game normally on the ps3? What the hell is the point of that?

That said, I don't see any reason for a PS3 owner to use this unless you want to try out a bunch of games at once every now and then or are impatient."
PlayStationPlus,34upfy,Rytlock,2,Tue May 5 03:02:59 2015 UTC,It's been pretty crappy in my experience too. Then i got sick and was in the hospital for a week and when i came back i was automatically signed up for another month. Dammit.

I will never understand how people go without it.    I see people say its too expensive and don't enjoy a lot of the free games but even if you only play a couple of the free games chances are that pays for it.   Honestly if I only had $50 in my pocket and was excited for a new game release but my ps+ was about to run out I would renew every single time, just a no brainer.

Several characters with unique levels, backstories and abilities that will change how every single run through is played? Sounds amazing. But the execution was horrendous. Generic levels with easy puzzles cut between the character-specific levels that are the only ones that ever use that character's special ability. Just incredibly disappointing. I was so excited for that game."

You'd have to be a kid, not yet able to drive, too far from a park to be able to walk, and have parents who wouldn't drive you there but who will buy video games for you.  Either way, I'm not arguing that others aren't allowed to enjoy it just because it doesn't do anything for me.  If it found an audience, that's wonderful, and personally non-threatening to me."

I like indie games but Proteus is just the most pretentious pile twaddle I've ever come across masquerading as a 'Game'. It manages to combine every single pretentious indie scene thing into one completely unlikable mess.
PlayStationPlus,34kppk,Jamesbuc,2,Sat May 2 06:51:18 2015 UTC,"It's just a game where you walk around in a stylized forest. How the fuck is that pretentious?  It's experimental, and you shouldn't shit on it for just not being the typical videogame with scores and enemies and things like that."
PlayStationPlus,34kppk,Derpface123,1 point,Sat May 2 23:19:38 2015 UTC,"Its the whole games are art thing and yes, its experimental but personally it just doesn't work for me. I do find it pretentious, I find the art style pretentious and gimmicky and the entire lack of solid gameplay.  Personally I don't mind some Games are Art titles but I feel Proteus fails in this by forgetting the 'Game' aspect."
PlayStationPlus,34kppk,Jamesbuc,3,Tue May 5 17:21:09 2015 UTC,"Pretentious: ""attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed.""  Proteus is just a game where you walk around and explore an island.   How is that pretentious? It's just an experimental little game and you got it for FREE and you think it's a pile of garbage.   How the hell is a pixelated art style pretentious? Does that make Minecraft pretentious? It's just an art style.   Your argument seems like it's coming from someone who finds games that don't follow strict established gameplay genres automatically ""pretentious"", which to me is a very close-minded way of thinking.  The gameplay is the exploration of the world in Proteus. That is the gameplay; just because there's no shooting or beating up enemies or traditional gameplay doesn't mean there is no 'solid gameplay' or they forgot the 'Game' aspect. The developer of Proteus didn't forget anything; he made the game exactly as he meant to, he didn't release it and then go, ""OH GEEZ! I FORGOT TO ADD GAMEPLAY!""  I think you need to reconsider the way you think about videogames as a medium as it is people with mindsets like yours who are holding videogames back from being recognized as an art like film and literature are. ""Experimental"" doesn't just mean it tries something unique (like Antichamber and the way it defies realistic physical connections between areas in the world). Experimental can mean anything, and if you're down with experimental games, you're down with Proteus, The Stanley Parable, and everything like it.  Before you call games ""pretentious pile twaddle"" because they don't offer traditional gameplay, I suggest you investigate how videogames are created and recognize that Proteus was not a 5-minute project, but rather one made over the span of many months, because hey, making videogames isn't easy, and if you think it's easy to make a game that is as much of a ""mess"" as Proteus, I challenge YOU to make a better game.   Let's see if you can do better."
PlayStationPlus,34kppk,Derpface123,1 point,Tue May 5 18:24:24 2015 UTC,"Right. Usually I wouldn't bother responding to such a silly rant but given I haven't exactly got anything to do right now... Shoot.   You seem to think that I got Proteus for free. That's only part true if you only count the PS+ giveaway. I originally got this and several other indie titles a few years back as part of some steam indie pack sale and I disliked this one completely back then. I tried it again on my Vita when it hit plus and still, I really don't like it. Just because things are free, doesn't make them good or even acceptable. I could throw out a spare steam key for Bad Rats for free and that's a horrid title. I could point you towards multiple sites giving away janky Mario fangames which are free. Still doesn't make them good. (this isn't in order from your rant btw) You seem to think that because it took many months its somehow validated itself in some way. Here's the thing, it doesn't matter how long you go and make something, you can spend years building up something and if somebody finds it crap, they are going to find it crap and nobody other than the owner and maybe the odd one or two people will give two flying hoots regarding how long the game took to make outside of a Wikipedia 'intresting info' mention and a couple of 'Making of' articles if its lucky. Again you make presumptions regarding my liking for indie and you even amusingly bring up one of the indie titles that I bought and loved on release day (The Stanley Parable). Don't believe me? Go check my steam library. I'll wait. Sure there's a lot of bundle stuff there but... tell me... how many bundles as Stanley Parable been in? Zero. Standpoint? Zero. Skullgirls? Zero. Oh and mentioning Antichamber, played through it from start to end and enjoyed it. Just because I enjoy Indie and experimental doesn't mean I like everything under that banner nor should it mean that everyone should either, that's like suggesting that all F-Zero players should love Wipeout because 'future racing'. Again presumptions. I don't like Pixels somehow because I don't like Proteus? Please. Proteus doesn't own that particular style. Once again, view my steam library. I've played through both 'To the Moon' and 'A Bird Story', I ploughed through 'Potatoman Seeks the Troof', 'Bleed', 'Fez', 'Finding Teddy', 'McPixel', 'VVVVVV' and several others. So no, it being pixelly is NOT an issue. I can stand Games are Art as I mentioned already. I can stand Games are Stories too. Where my issue comes along is where I feel that Art is pushed to the point where gameplay is heavily sacrificed and that's where the pretentiousness comes in for me. Take 'Gone Home' for instance, here is a game which pushes heavily in the story department but makes sure the player feels that they are part at all times through immersion, through some basic puzzles and through a tale. Take Kentucky Route Zero, another art-story title which draws the player in through actions but at the same time provides a stunning backdrop. Proteus meanwhile I feel is completely lacking in any sort of meaningful interactivity and the randomized nature of the islands ruin any sort of personal touch. Finally I don't claim to be an indie dev. I don't claim to make games for a living and quite frankly good on those who do. I never said its easy to make a game and quite frankly I know at times its the exact opposite BUT that doesn't mean I should like end results. And I don't like Proteus."

Now that you have made your opinions clear, I can see I was wrong in the assumptions I have made. You make an excellent point about the randomized islands removing any personal touch from the experience, and now I see why you dislike the game. I would just hate to see someone write off Proteus simply because of its art style, which is what I drew from your original post when you said that you find the pixelated art style pretentious.

PlayStationPlus,34kppk,Dingus4000,2,Mon May 4 09:34:36 2015 UTC,"lol, you just suck at it. The issue with it is that it expects you to be able to string together tricks for massive amounts of points, but early on it doesn't tell you how to manual, which is the way to keep a combo going. This is where the game falters and most people lose interest. The game could definitely use better tutorials and explain things better, though."

PlayStationPlus,34kppk,killress,1 point,Sat May 2 12:15:37 2015 UTC,"I feel you on that. What makes that so difficult is that there are very few games that require you to do things when you land. Anybody who has played Tony Hawk in the past know that landing is as simple as being aimed the right direction. Yes, this does make Olli Olli 2 a bit more difficult, but once you learn to habitually press X before landing, things become a lot easier. I haven't really played it in a while as I have some other games I'm playing right now, but it's not bad for a nice little 20-minute session or something while you download an update or other game."

When dealing with a repetitive game where a lot of trial and error is involved I feel like it is best to keep levels short and concise. Super Meat Boy did a great job at making short levels (especially at the beginning when teaching you the mechanics), incredibly precise controls, and instant respawns when you die. Olli Olli 2 takes those extra seconds pushing to get going at the beginning of each level, the stages are too long for how repetitive it is, and its learning curve is too steep at the beginning to encourage new players."

Here were his reviews:  Hohokum was pretty much a 2D version of Proteus, cool for about twenty minutes but its very pointlessness (NO REAL OBJECTIVES, JUST EXPLORE THE AREA AND SEE HOW PRETTY THINGS ARE WHEN THEY REACT) wasn't to my tastes. When I think 'review bait boredom simulating Indie games in the future, this will likely top the list).   Race The Sun felt like a game I've played 50 times before, with only the Graphics changed. If I wanted that experience I'd go find one of those games rather then install this again.  Guacamelee! I already received on PS3 and Vita back in November 2013. I didn't enjoy it then and I've got no intention of taking up precious PS4 space now.   The Unfinished Swan... sigh just sigh.  Murasaki Baby disappoints me.  Massimo Guarini seems focused on making artsy award bait rather then enjoyable games. He should team up with Suda51 again, Shadows of the Damned was pretty sweet.  Ether One is an old Myst style adventure game that tries had but seemingly sacrifices gameplay for plot convenience.  May is a month filled with 5 indies that seemingly focus on being 'experiences' rather then enjoyable gameplay and one game they've already given us that actually tried to be enjoyable but just wasn't to my taste.

They've created a very interesting world (Well I guess Dmitry Glukhovsky did create the world through his book series the games are based on but i haven't read those so i didn't want to make allusions to having prior knowledge of the universe the game takes place in.)   They blend Stealth and a FPS shooter really well.  And I like that there are minimal cut scenes. You get to experience everything through the gameplay. Its very immersive.  and i like games that let you decide your plan of action. If you want to go in guns ablazing, go right ahead. If you want to stealth through the level that is fine too.  It doesn't seem to ever punish you for the way you play.  Ill add also that I didn't play the first game Metro: 2033 either so it was easy to pick up on the story for this one also.  The only thing that threw me off was the gunplay seems very chaotic at first, because the first things you fight are monsters.  So i was worried that it would be sloppy and fight for your life type of gameplay but it really dials it in and you get some of the tightest FPS gameplay i've ever played.  and also the horror elements are very fun too. They are able to balance a lot of things and make it fun.    I say definitely give it a shot if your a fan of FPS gameplay."

There are a few I've been planning to play, but I've just had more fun with the games I purchased (like BF4 and GTA V). Overall, I'm largely disappointed with the IGC."

PlayStationPlus,34inqp,Beckawk,2,Sat May 2 05:57:48 2015 UTC,"I played a bit of Ether One last night. It wasn't long before my girlfriend had the guide open online. The puzzles are a bit obscure and apparently you can spend hours just walking around a level trying to work things out. I don't think the walkthrough is ruining the experience though, because the story is interesting enough.  I played about half an hour of Hohokum before I gave it up as a bad joke. I have no idea what the point of the game is or what half the controls actually do. I felt like I was exploring someone's art project and that just doesn't appeal to me. It might be your thing if you like games so indie that they don't explain themselves."

I really wanted to love that game but... the platforming doesn't really work with the two characters. In situations when you need to run or place yourself in safety, you can count on the AI to screw things up. Really infuriating at some time. But still a must play as it's short but beautiful and the cultural insights are great.  Working on Valiant hearts, Not really difficult or driving, I'm not that into it. Again with that one, the story is cool and I like the art.  I plan on getting into Dust and now with the announcement I will beat Guacamelee again as this game is soooo good!"

But the game has some technical issues and the pacing/flow of the game suffers tremendously from it.

There are a few games that came out with cross-buy after they were free on PS+ (RESOGUN for example). According to the list, I own the Vita and PS3 version even though I only got them due to the fact that I ""bought"" the PS4 version when it was on PS+. Do I actually own these versions or are they still locked to my PS+ membership?"
PlayStationPlus,34jq6c,srbman,1 point,Fri May 1 20:17:19 2015 UTC,"To the best of my knowledge you actually own them. (This may change, be fixed, what have you.)  When you purchase a cross-buy title, seemingly after it stops being offered via PS+, it loses its associated expiration date which PSDLE uses to identify PS+ content. This can be verified by downloading the content and viewing on the system where it will also lack an expiration date."

PlayStationPlus,34dawz,willozsy,5,Thu Apr 30 06:02:07 2015 UTC,"Not to most people who complain.  To them, it's budget.  And I'm kind of with them at this point.  It's been almost two years.  I don't think one old retail title per month is too much to ask for PS4.  If you have to discontinue PS3 to do it, so be it.  But my guess is PS3 costs like nothing to do so they'll keep that going for a long time."
PlayStationPlus,34dawz,IceBreak,6,Thu Apr 30 07:35:07 2015 UTC,"They won't stop doing that for a while because that would cut out all of the subscribers who do not have any system other than PS3.  I personally think that's a rather large demographic and a lot of easy subscribers.  The difference is they need to keep us PS3 owners happy with the offerings to keep us subscribed. With PS4, however, there are plenty of users who only care about the multiplayer and continuing to release indies will not be effecting Sony's amount of subscribers as much becuase they have the bonus of multiplayer."
PlayStationPlus,34dawz,Bangcrashboom,2,Thu Apr 30 18:03:53 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have six total games per month than only four including a PS4 AAA, personally.  If I want a specific old AAA game, I'll go to any store and pick it up from the pre-owned/discount section.  For example I bought Wolfenstein for $12 from Target recently, and got Killzone, Metro Redux, and Infamous: Second Son for $36 at BB with GCU (preowned).  I can always trade them in to offset the cost.  I understand the desire for AAA current gen games, but if IGC is your only source of games, you're doing it wrong."
PlayStationPlus,34dawz,ms2guy,1 point,Fri May 1 21:47:55 2015 UTC,"YES EXACTLY! I mean I love AAA games too, but because they are popular and printed on disk that means you can get them for super cheap and resell them to make playing it free. I just recently platinumed Shadow of Mordor for free by buying it on Craigslist and then selling it on Craigslist 2 weeks later for the price I paid.  I can't do that with digitially distributed indies. Now with ps+ and craigslist I am playing pretty much all of the games for nearly nothing. I only made an exception to jump in at full price for a game with Bloodborne because it's just so damn special."

Not asking for 12 retail games at once like PS3 got.  Just one retail game a month.   And second, they shouldn't discontinue shit, you little self-serving ass.   Again, bold strategy.  I kind of even respect it."
PlayStationPlus,34dawz,IceBreak,2,Thu Apr 30 09:21:08 2015 UTC,"to be honest they should atleast give us every 3-6 month one bigger retail game like knack, sherlock, wolfenstein, sleeping dogs, trials. thats all the complain about nothing more or less.  there were alot more games developed and released since release until now, than for ps3 at this point."

PlayStationPlus,34dawz,HatmanGates,-2,Sun May 3 12:23:51 2015 UTC,"Uh, good reply?"
PlayStationPlus,34dawz,bmacorr,13,Thu Apr 30 17:19:05 2015 UTC,"The thing is, the game industry is being taken by storm by smaller games. And that's fine, because it's risky and expensive to make big ""AAA"" games. I sort of want publishers to realize they need to release better games (finished, less buggy, more fun) to get sales.   But what that means for Playstation Plus is dissapointing customers. This shit used to be optional for free games and some system perks. Now it's required (for PS4 online and some key features that should be standard). So it doesn't seem unfair to release some bigger games every couple months.   Now if the service had been flawless this would be more forgivable, but there are too many down times and other mis-steps recently to excuse a lackluster selection of games.  There's no reason that they couldn't be trickling some of these games to us:   Driveclub PS+ (I mean, really) Knack Killzone: Shadow Fall Infamous: Second Son Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes   I mean, those games are all Sony anyway! Not to mention games that would probably have promotional reasons to make it cheaper for Sony or are just old enough that it wouldn't matter much (Battlefield 4, Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, Wolfenstein: The New Order).   At this point it feels like they think they got enough users that they no longer need to lure people into Plus based on the IGC. And that's sad . . ."
PlayStationPlus,34dawz,irishsandman,5,Thu Apr 30 17:05:28 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind paying for PS+ if they defined what type of games they put onto it.  If they say it's meant to give us a taste of indie games I have nothing against that.  It's the fact that we never know what we'll get so we don't know whether we should drop money on certain games or not because they might go on PS+
PlayStationPlus,34dawz,bmacorr,2,Thu Apr 30 17:22:21 2015 UTC,"It's the anticipation that ""someday"" we'll get something more ""full"" that makes these announcements seem so weak.

Same with BF4 really, game now has a successor of sorts with Hardline and used its going for like $17, with all the Premium content available for $50 still I would think this would be IGC worthy.  Also, maybe Last of Us HD? It's now going for $12 digital, I think they could toss us that bone. I don't even care if they strip out the DLC."

I'm not really into those kinds of games, so I usually check them out for a few minutes and then never play them again. I've only put more than an hour into a small handful of games like Resogun and The Swapper.

PlayStationPlus,34abba,Jackissocool,4,Thu Apr 30 01:04:42 2015 UTC,"I think comparing those as just ""puzzlers"" is pretty dismissive. They are wildly different games in terms of gameplay, tone, number of dimensions, and art style."

An Fifa and PES are wildly different if you like football.  And so are Battlefield and COD.  I'm not dismissing them. I'm actually going to play at least one of them, probably two, that I've chosen for their differences, but it's still 4 games of the least demanded genre."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Jackissocool,10,Wed Apr 29 16:36:15 2015 UTC,"No, I mean, you can barely even consider then the same genre. Those other ones aren't good comparisons at all. MK and SF are different, but in both you control one dude fighting another on a 2D plane using a set number of attacks and combos with multiple button inputs for special attacks; control schemes are pretty similar, just SF has two more attack buttons. In Hohokum you fly a snake around a 2D environment picking people up to take them to other places based on what they're doing. In Murasaki Baby you guide a child through a 2D plane by manipulating the environment. In The Unfinished Swan you move through a colorless 3D world in first person and reveal your path by shooting paint blobs onto the environment. The only thing they have in common is puzzles: not the type of puzzles, way you interact with the environment, linearity/openness, or their control schemes. It's kind of like saying MGSV and that new Assassin's Creed China are the same cause they both involve stealth, even though everything else about them is completely different."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Golwar,17,Wed Apr 29 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"I must agree with theBloodedge here. As a fan of the genre you naturally will see far more variety and details there, compared to someone who can't stand it.  Other genres also can vary between 2D, 3D or something in between. First Person and Third Person. Some will require more dexterity, others less. Some a tactical approach, others less. Some will adopt elements from genre A, others from genre B. But for everyone else outside that sphere, they are all part of that one big genre.  And no matter what, we surely don't have to argue that puzzle games are certainly overrepresented in Plus. Besides the ultra hardcore puzzle fans (which are a tiny minority as seen in the poll above), absolutely nobody needs (or wants) that many puzzle games. No matter if in 2D or 3D or whatever else variation. ;)"
PlayStationPlus,34abba,johnymyko,13,Wed Apr 29 17:02:37 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand how PS3 had such great games back in the day and now it's just random puzzlers, 2D platformers and so on.

PlayStationPlus,34abba,CurbedEnthusiasm,15,Wed Apr 29 19:03:43 2015 UTC,"The service changed. Plus went from free game service to online play service with a few games. When it was the former, PS3 got AAA each month. Now, it's this."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,tlamy,9,Wed Apr 29 20:52:46 2015 UTC,"I could be completely wrong, but I imagine that the budget for PS+ titles might be the same now as it was before the PS4 released. For example (and I'm just making up random numbers here), imagine that Sony has $750,000 to spend a month to buy games that will be free on PS+. In the past, they could buy a AAA PS3 game for, say, $500,000 and then a couple smaller games for PS3 and Vita that add up to $250,000. Now, however, Sony is committed to two games a month on each of their three systems. With the same budget of $750,000 and a quota of six games a month to meet, they are now forced to buy games that are much cheaper (indies, old games, unpopular games, etc.). Again, I made up completely random and arbitrary numbers here but I think you get the point. And this is just a big guess."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,johnymyko,2,Wed Apr 29 20:30:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense!

Shadows of the Colossus.  Deus Ex HR.  Spec Ops: The Line.  Hitman Absolution.  Borderlands 2.    Playstation Plus used to bring the thunder.  Sure, even 2013 was peppered with a few stinkers here and there, but now it's just almost entirely ho-hum indie games from month to month.  I even found one of my most favorite games of all time, Virtue's Last Reward, from PS Plus.  How many disc-based, full retail price PS4 games have we seen yet?  Let's look.  -Injustice: Gods Among Us  That's it, end of list.  PS4's about a year and a half old now, there are plenty of $20 games, they could do better."

Maybe your anger translated into hyperbole, but if you have a valid point, it wasn't going to come across or be heard by making statements like ""PS Plus is just a bunch of games that didn't sell well"".

PlayStationPlus,34abba,MakeshiftMakeshift,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:17:12 2015 UTC,"Realistically, what AAA games on PS+ would ""bring the thunder""? because I can only think of Wolfenstein. It was a well-received game that a lot of people probably skipped.  Rayman is a side-scroller so people would complain. Knack, AC IV, Thief, or Killzone would all be pretty lame in my opinion; they were released at a time when there was little else to play, so either everyone played them then or they weren't interested. Heck, I don't even think Watch_Dogs would get people that excited. I'm just curious, but I don't think the PS4 has a big enough AAA library yet to really make a big on PS+.   Maybe I'm completely wrong and a bunch of people skipped all those games... I can only speak from my own view and what I've played on my PS4."

PlayStationPlus,34abba,BenjaminTalam,3,Wed Apr 29 19:25:32 2015 UTC,"I get that PS+ giving out these games kind of helps to introduce subscribers to games they wouldn't normally play and maybe get some new fans of certain games, but a AAA title would sure be nice.   I can't believe Shadowfall hasn't been on the IGC yet. It's ridiculous that their big exclusive FPS game is pretty much dead in the water. The IGC could really help get the game more players, because honestly when there are actually people on the multiplayer can be fun and there's a lot of variety (invisible, knives only, Rambo game type) that I can't enjoy because no one is ever on to populate playlists.   Even Knack hasn't been on it yet. What gives? I own both of the games I mentioned (they were the launch titles I got with the console), just giving some examples.   I don't see why we can't get one AAA title that's been out for at least three months already every other month alongside these indie games.   Not to mention the Drive Club fiasco. Really let down by PS+ lately."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,MarkusGisdol,3,Fri May 1 02:46:28 2015 UTC,"In June 2015 they should give out 1 AAA Game for PS4 like Rayman,  Wolfenstein, Trials, Sherlock and June 16/18  at E3 Experience they should give out KNACK or Little Big Planet 3 for free for everyone.

PlayStationPlus,34abba,Dr_Mintberry,7,Wed Apr 29 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"I'm actually pretty excited about this month, every game looks interesting and the crossbuy this month is amazing. I'm grateful that all but one is on the ps4, I have a ps3, but the ps4 is much snappier, especially with the store. So I'd rather use that, also my ps3 is pretty much filled   I totally understand people being disappointed with no AAA game though, I was expecting one too. The Indies are great when they're great, but they tend to be very short. I mean I know plus has been going on with the ps3 for years, but a one non indie would be great.   I enjoy reading this every month, it's interesting to see what people think and it's nice to be part of a community, this is my first time actually participating. I'd like to say to everyone who is whining about some people being whiney and brats, first off, why are you here? Secondly I get that some people are annoying, say the ones who wanted bloodborne on plus the first month it came out, to make up for a bad month or some bs. Most people just like to speculate on what could be coming and they're just excited.   Also ps plus is something you pay for. A lot of people have it even though they only have a ps3, therefore online is free for them. I don't think it's having a sense of entitlement or being bratty when you do not receive what you payed for, being what was promised, expected, advertised. Such as drive club, which is not something I care about, but I'd imagine some people got plus just for that. They did not deliver and the story changed on what was included in the plus edition if I'm not mistaken, which I might be. They drop the ball sometimes for sure.  Ps plus is a great value in my opinion though, $50 for a year is not that much if your an adult with a job, it's about a day of work or less. You get way more than $50 in content and if you're on ps4 and don't have a ps3, you can get a one used for about the price of a year of plus, my brother did easily and that would give you so much more. But again you pay for it, so feedback is not being entitled, if someone worked on my car and didn't quite fix the root of the problem or charged more than they should, I would call them out on it. On the other side if you don't like it don't buy it, being outspoken is saying that you think they are almost getting it or the idea is good and want it to improve  Long I know, but thanks for reading if you did"

It's a whimsical little romp through a rather bizarre kingdom which has little neat surprises for you. Terry Gilliam provides some voice work, to give you an idea of the kind of weirdness we're dealing with.  Murasaki Baby is just a bizarre little game. It's a bit like Monsterbag in that it is beautifully designed, is certainly charming, but the game itself is flawed, however it's short enough for you to forgive it. It's all controlled via the front and rear touchpad, and you drag this weird little girl through a Tim Burton inspired nightmare world and you alter the path to make it so she doesn't fall down a hole or something like that. The animation is brilliant, the characters are quirky, and it results in a decent 2 hour adventure."

I love indie games, counter-spy was fantastic, rogue and legacy, transistor,Valiant Hearts: The Great War, Olliolli2, Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee — New ‘n’ Tasty!

If anyone's interested, here's how the game works.  You're in a ship flying through a procedurally generated field of columns, which apparently can fall down.  You constantly speed up as you progress through the levels, which have a clear gateway into the next level.  It's just a fast-reaction based game.  Edit: Cube field is the flash game and cube racer is the iOS version.  Edit2: why the hell am I being downvoted?  Did I get something wrong?

Guacamelee, with all due respect, was already on the IGC. Race The Sun is a pretty Cube Runner/Field/Racer (done over and over again in the same format). Ether, Swan and Hohokum are indie puzzle games, which the IGC has plenty of already.  I'm not saying he lineup is bad (the games are pretty good) but something new every now and then would be cool."

If you want a triple a so bad just go buy or rent it instead of waiting years for the possibility it may hit plus.

PlayStationPlus,34abba,Issune91,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:29:57 2015 UTC,Yeah. bar a few exceptional indie titles and Injustice... i've not got a whole out of PS+ on PS4. It's easy to see why they insisted on PS+ for multiplayer... i'd have stopped mine by now without that.
PlayStationPlus,34abba,heisenbergfan,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:38:29 2015 UTC,It was on ps3 for psplus in the past and this is a new version for the ps4 with more stuff. So that's why.
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Issune91,3,Thu Apr 30 15:13:52 2015 UTC,Still. Game selection getting worse and worse from what i noticed.
PlayStationPlus,34abba,heisenbergfan,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:39:06 2015 UTC,"Dishonored was great last month man !  But yea, ps3 got the short end of the stick this month. Guess they can't make everyone happy, ps4 users definetly deserved better than what they were getting.  Hopefully our ps3 games can get back on track next month, cuz this is not my favorite lineup either. Unfinished swan has some potential tho, will definetly try it out first."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Issune91,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:42:14 2015 UTC,"I will try all of the games out. But I never felt so disspointed about a lineup on ps+ before. Got ps+ last month for the 1st time :D was hyped. Free game Dishonored which i already had though, and this month all these meh games... so ofc i'm dissapointed. Edit: Even if I just got ps+ for the 1st time, I was always drooling over what games were free on ps+."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,urethra_butthole_3D,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:59:32 2015 UTC,"Sadly The best days of PS+ for ps3 are long gone, they were great back in the day before ps4 was launched. Now they share their budget with every platform and there is definetly fewer games and fewer AAA games.  We can still hope for some great games, like Dishonored last month, just don't expect them to come very often."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,pedromreis95,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:12:34 2015 UTC,"Crime and punishment was great, Dishonored great, I think before that it was Thief which was k. They simply fucked up this month. I hope they step up their game or just lose people that subscribe to the service. The ONLY reason PS3 and vita owners would get PS+ is for the free games."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,FloppyDiskFish,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:21:29 2015 UTC,The PS3 & Vita version was never free in the USA actually.
PlayStationPlus,34abba,caxor,4,Wed Apr 29 17:26:35 2015 UTC,"Seriously? More indie shit? I have spent 100€ on ps+ subscriptions and what have I got? Injustice and the Infamous DLC. Fucking hell... why don't they give us AAA's? Killzone, Infamous! I'm not even asking for 3rd party games, those are Sony-owned! I know I'm gonna get hate from the 'Indies are cool' crowd, but I personally can't be asked to pay for a service that gives me games I have zero fun playing."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,SethArnok,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:20:30 2015 UTC,You're paying for access to multiplayer in the ps4 the free games are just an added bonus.
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Mikeoneus,3,Thu Apr 30 17:11:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, peer-to-peer is really expensive."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,DavidLovato,23,Sun May 3 19:58:30 2015 UTC,"Please learn what entitled means. We pay money for plus, it's called a service. Yes, you can criticize the value of things you buy."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Gregtacular,24,Mon May 4 22:37:27 2015 UTC,goddamned whiny entitled brats that show up and pout   Is people expressing dissatisfaction with a service they pay for really this much of an outrage?
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Boroda_UA,3,Wed Apr 29 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"Same. I came over to PS4 from Xbox. I'm one of the twelve people who actually likes Destiny so I had to get Plus anyway, but I've been pleasantly surprised a few times. I remember seeing videos of Don't Starve and I thought it looked boring, but it was free so I downloaded it, played it, and got hooked. It's one of my all-time favorite games now, I bought it again on PC and I still play on PS4 from time to time. I might even get the Wii U version too because why the fuck not.  Outlast was so much fun, I didn't mind paying $9 for a two-hour DLC since I'd gotten a ton of use out of the main game, for free. I play it every Halloween-ish, can't wait for the sequel.  Resogun got me through the first few weeks of my PS4 when there was really nothing on it to play. Lots of fun.  Never Alone is short but I spontaneously played it co-op with my brother. We beat it in one sitting, but it was great to get a nice couch co-op experience like that again, even for just a little while.  Sure, most months are full of games I don't care about, but I always look forward to being surprised. And if I'm not, oh well; this cost me nothing I wasn't already going to pay anyway. Not to mention if I ever buy a PS3 or a Vita, I'm going to have a kickass library before I even take it out of the box."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Sicmay,3,Wed Apr 29 18:21:22 2015 UTC,That's a pretty good way of looking at it.   It's like clockwork every month.
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Bangcrashboom,3,Wed Apr 29 18:22:26 2015 UTC,compare to xbox free games this is fail 3rd month is the row
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Sicmay,3,Wed Apr 29 17:24:00 2015 UTC,They just announced Games with Gold for those interested:   Xbox One - CastleStorm: Definitive Edition  Xbox 360 - Mafia II (1st-15th May)  Xbox 360 - F1 2013 (16th - 31st May)   I guess it's a dud month all round
PlayStationPlus,34abba,heisenbergfan,7,Wed Apr 29 16:27:06 2015 UTC,How is mafia 2 a dud?
PlayStationPlus,34abba,johnymyko,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"Well it is 5 years old and can be picked up for under £5. Besides I said the month was a dud, not the games themselves."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,heisenbergfan,2,Wed Apr 29 16:09:41 2015 UTC,"damn, definetly wanted mafia 2 and f1 2013 on ps3."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,tbx5959,3,Wed Apr 29 16:53:07 2015 UTC,Mafia 2 was already a PS+ game some time ago.
PlayStationPlus,34abba,wielku,2,Wed Apr 29 17:21:22 2015 UTC,Not on US....
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Streetfoldsfive,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"castlestorm is fine, but I bought it on a ps flash sale for like a dollar or two"

PlayStationPlus,34abba,Streetfoldsfive,5,Wed Apr 29 20:56:49 2015 UTC,Pretty Great month all around. 5 games on PS4 and Muraski Baby on Vita? I'll take that. Some excellent games on here that are already blindly being called shit on other subs.  How can someone call Guacamelee a shit game :(
PlayStationPlus,34abba,MightyGreenPanda,23,Wed Apr 29 16:11:24 2015 UTC,How can someone call Guacamelee a shit game   In all fairness people might be disappointed because we already got the standard edition in the IGC.
PlayStationPlus,34abba,01luca01,4,Wed Apr 29 16:08:53 2015 UTC,That's perfectly understandable.
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Streetfoldsfive,4,Wed Apr 29 15:46:13 2015 UTC,How can someone call Guacamelee a shit game :(   Who's saying that? Everyone looks excited for it.
PlayStationPlus,34abba,larsvondank,2,Wed Apr 29 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe not directly, but I read lots of people calling shit the entire lineup, so I think it's more or less the same thing."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,ImPhelpsingIt,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:59:07 2015 UTC,There was some hate for it on other subs. Not here
PlayStationPlus,34abba,BrahamStein,2,Wed Apr 29 15:56:58 2015 UTC,At least there are two titles this month that actually interest me: Guacamelee! and The Unfinished Swan.
PlayStationPlus,34abba,SpoomMcKay,2,Tue May 5 18:33:24 2015 UTC,Does America get the same?
PlayStationPlus,34abba,triedtostayaway,4,Wed Apr 29 15:59:23 2015 UTC,"It's not confirmed yet but most likely, yes. The lists sometimes used to have slightly different games but for the past year or so the games have been exactly the same.  ninja edit: just as I clicked ""save"" they posted the NA list, it's the same.  http://blog.us.playstation.com/2015/04/29/ps-plus-free-games-for-may-2015/"
PlayStationPlus,34abba,DarthJetta,2,Wed Apr 29 15:47:44 2015 UTC,With Guacamelee and Murasaki Baby I'm well served. I already have the rest of them
PlayStationPlus,34abba,geocities,2,Wed Apr 29 15:50:28 2015 UTC,"Either One looks really cool, and I've actually never played Guacamelee so I'm pretty happy with this month."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,nowhoney,2,Wed Apr 29 15:58:35 2015 UTC,"Damn, already played half of them, the rest look too cheap. Guacamelee is the only real standout here, but they've already given away the ps3/vita editions. Shitty month, I regret renewing my subscription to ps+ honestly, but I've still got so many older games on the ps3 I want to play that the benefit outweighed supporting a service that has seriously nosedived in quality recently. I get we aren't going to get anything amazing on the ps4 for a long time, but the ps3 offerings have been pretty weak recently. Just no reason for that."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,MightyGreenPanda,2,Wed Apr 29 16:09:00 2015 UTC,Another no download month for the ps4...
PlayStationPlus,34abba,fakeplasticmax,2,Wed Apr 29 16:55:11 2015 UTC,"Well I'm skipping this month...  I fucking knew that when this service started, that it'd be mandatory for online on the next generation. And I knew the quality in games would take a dive, as a result."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Lecter07,2,Wed Apr 29 18:48:54 2015 UTC,I don't get what all the hate's about. I'm stoked to play all of these!
PlayStationPlus,34abba,UrdnotHorner,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:08:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna lie, even if I still believe that they should give us more AAA games, this month is pretty awesome. Ether One is definetely a pleasant surprise, I didn't hear about it until right now. The Unfinished Swan looks good too, and I've heard some great things about it. Everyone should try Guacamelee!, it's just so funny. Don't know about Murasaki Baby and Hohokum, but I'm not gonna lie, Race the Sun looks like a mobile game. An entertaining one, sure (if it's half as addicting as Pix the Cat or Titan Attacks, I'll be all over it), but a mobile game after all.  Seriously, this is what I want with PlayStation Plus; good games. I don't care if they're indies or not, I just want them to be good or surprising (in fact, I've discovered some amazing indies that currently are some of my favourite games thanks to PS+)."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,Oblimix,2,Thu Apr 30 01:40:58 2015 UTC,"5 games I probably never would've bought, but which will probably surprise me. Already finished Guacamelee on the Vita, but if you haven't played it yet: it's amazing!"
PlayStationPlus,34abba,docbauies,3,Thu Apr 30 09:11:14 2015 UTC,"Another disappointing month. Why am I always surprised? Probably misguided hope. Oh well, that's what I get for putting my faith in a money hungry corporation. Fuck me twice, shame on me, aye?"
PlayStationPlus,34abba,coolcon2000,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:02:53 2015 UTC,Race the Sun is actually really good.

PlayStationPlus,34abba,bigdwb1024,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:11:37 2015 UTC,"Unfinished Swan is really interesting. I own it, but I'm not upset, since I get it forever. Same with Guacamole. Both very innovative games that I thought were worth the purchase price.    I'm really intrigued by hohokum and race the sun. heard great things about them both.    Murasaki Baby looks like a perfect plus game. I was probably never going to buy it. Maybe it'll be good. maybe it won't. who knows.    ether one I'll reserve judgment on until I play it. I like puzzlers, although I don't know if it'll be something I play on the ps4."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,jcal0032,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:37:07 2015 UTC,"My PS+ ran out a few days ago. Do not have a PS4, so should I skip this month (Money tight at the mo, with no job) or would it be worth renewing for getting Unfinished Swan and Ether One on the download list?"
PlayStationPlus,34abba,zombieducklings,2,Wed Apr 29 20:13:10 2015 UTC,"Just skip, there mainly all crappy indie games. Guacamele is good but not really worth it. Maybe I get a renew on the second to last day and get them then if you want them"
PlayStationPlus,34abba,TheApples,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:20:03 2015 UTC,exactly what im doing... mine ran out today and after seeing this im gonna wait till then.

Not complaining though since as long as I get a few games a year I really like, the sub is worth it to me. I already got Dishonored so that's 1."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,desmondao,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think all of these look like allot of fun, the only one that looks maybe a little boring is murasaki baby, but even that has an awesome aesthetic. Super awesome looking month!!"

If I wasn't playing Mortal Kombat and Battlefield 4 I'd cancel the hell out of it. The only game I've given a shit about on PSPlus this year was Counter Spy and Transistor, and Transistor doesn't even count because I bought that on launch day last year. You really gotta step this shit up Sony, and not just rely on the good name you built over the past few years with the service."

Stop expecting AAA games, it's not going to happen, maybe rarely, but see the service for what it is, and resubscribe or don't acordingly."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,StarfighterProx,2,Wed May 6 17:58:35 2015 UTC,"I don't fucking understand why there is such a strong desire for AAA PS4 games when we know the ones we'd get would be Knack, Killzone, Thief or AC IV. I find it hard to get excited about any of those. We're getting FIVE PS4 games that all look unique and interesting... I had the same reaction as you. I couldn't believe the overwhelming ""not more indies..."" response. These are quality games.  I swear the AAA is just an image thing. Knack got trashed when it came out and now people want it in here for some reason."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,RickityRickityRecked,2,Wed Apr 29 17:35:14 2015 UTC,5 ps4 games and 4 vita games?  That's sweet.  I think we can put away our pitchforks this month.
PlayStationPlus,34abba,pir8pat,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:56:36 2015 UTC,A big yay from me here. A load of titles I really wanna mess about with and play. I can see the whining coming though given there isn't a single retail title amongst the lot.
PlayStationPlus,34abba,SilverKry,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:50:42 2015 UTC,"Nice! Guacamelee is a great game. Hohokum is a perfect PS+ offering, IMO; it's a game I will definitely fire up to chill out after playing hardcore stuff, but I never would have purchased it on my own.  I don't know much about the other games. Ether One looks like a fun, Myst-esque puzzle game. Unfinished Swan is a total question mark for me. Race the Sun is putting off a real old-school arcade vibe."
PlayStationPlus,34abba,TheStressGamer,3,Wed Apr 29 16:04:37 2015 UTC,"I loved Unfinished Swan.  Very mysterious, charming, beautiful.  It may seem a little tiresome at times (well, repetitive, I don't know), but I remember feeling satisfied at the end.  Then again, it's been a while.  I think you'll enjoy it on some level :)"

PlayStationPlus,34abeg,letsgometros,10,Wed Apr 29 16:40:23 2015 UTC,"Not a very strong month. Guacamelee is fun if you like that type of game. Race the sun has an 8/10 difficulty to 100%, ether one has no trophies posted yet. I fished Swan is short like never alone. Then the vita one is apparently a 1-2 hour game. So yeah, meh. They better turn it up to 11 in June to dazzle e3."
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,Hawk798,2,Wed Apr 29 20:05:56 2015 UTC,"Race The Sun is good, especially for shorter play sessions.  I guess my problem with these indie games is that they don't really hold my interest for longer than an hour each. The Swapper was very good, but most of them end up getting downloaded and then deleted a day later. The positive with that is that you can experience all six games in a given month, but I miss being given a game that I may have missed out on when it came out, and really sinking my teeth into it."
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,Guglio08,2,Wed Apr 29 15:56:38 2015 UTC,"This is what my issue is - that they're all short experiences.  Ether One is a 6 hour game. Unfinished swan is 3 hours. Hohokum is about 5 hours. Guacamelee is about 8 hours. Murasaki Baby is 2 1/2.  Even assuming you have all consoles and are going to play all the games, you'll get about 25 hours total gameplay.  Speedrunning dishonored alone gets you that many hours. This month just seems very short by comparison."
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,Romiress,4,Wed Apr 29 19:06:24 2015 UTC,That's a lot of hours for the less than $5 price.
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,DrunkeNinja,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:05:26 2015 UTC,"In the end, it's entirely up to the individual person, which systems they have, which games they like, etc. Last month I got about three hours or okay-ish gameplay out of the games, considering my personal tastes. Previous months I got more, sometimes none at all.  In the end, it's a balancing act - do I get more hours than I would just buying a game I want? Sometimes it can be a neat way to find a game I might not have otherwise played, but other times it's just a bunch of games I don't really enjoy.  Not all hours of gameplay are created equal - my point was simply that most of the indie titles are fairly short, compared to some of the bulkier titles given out in the past."
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,Romiress,2,Fri May 1 21:31:00 2015 UTC,People said Guacamelee was a free game for PS3/Vita was this EU? I don't have the game and I been with PS+ for 2 years....unless I somehow missed it...which would suck.
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,SIRTreehugger,2,Fri May 1 21:37:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was free on the X1 too. It's an awesome game."
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,SemiColin47,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:09:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing it on the 'all time' NA list, so it probably was EU back when they got different games."

PlayStationPlus,34abeg,Likuoooo,4,Thu Apr 30 09:55:22 2015 UTC,And another month goes by with leaks that were WAY off the reservation. I really need to stop getting my hopes up when I see those.
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,eXplicit815,2,Thu Apr 30 22:21:42 2015 UTC,I wonder if the budget for getting IGC games went down or something.
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,Flgibson97,3,Wed Apr 29 16:48:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and it's also not used to improve the online infrastructure for the PS4. I'm questioning where our PS+ money is going"
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,b_ukkake,0,Wed Apr 29 22:44:33 2015 UTC,The bank probably. They want to spend the lowest amount to get good financial reports. I feel like all of this is pushing me to pc gaming.
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,Flgibson97,5,Sun May 3 22:27:51 2015 UTC,What a load of shit. One game was already on the fucking IGC before.
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,Zack_Shikari,3,Sun May 3 22:39:47 2015 UTC,Other than Ether one... this month looks like a no play for me.

PlayStationPlus,34abeg,chonginson,3,Wed Apr 29 17:58:41 2015 UTC,"This is a fantastic month I was going to buy hohokum and murasaki baby couple months ago glad I didn't. Purchased the unfinished swan but haven't played it and played grucmelee awhile ago, I am jealous of those who get to play it for the first time  :)"
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,Doomsdays97,-7,Wed Apr 29 18:21:58 2015 UTC,No.
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,chonginson,2,Wed Apr 29 18:39:32 2015 UTC,How's this not a good month 5 ps4 games including guacamelee a 84 on metacritic and unfinished swan a critical acclaimed game. Murasaki baby which look unique and interesting.
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,Doomsdays97,0,Wed Apr 29 16:04:19 2015 UTC,"It looks like a really good month to me as well, but I think people are going into PS Plus with vastly different expectations. To me, paying a little more than $4 a month and getting a nice batch of indie games is awesome. Maybe this does feel like a come down to people who were used to the PS Plus offerings on the PS3, but for what this service is now? I think this is a great line up."
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,jacobi123,2,Wed Apr 29 18:39:04 2015 UTC,"I still think that the games would have to be absolutely terrible to not justify 4.79, like have to be really really bad."
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,Doomsdays97,2,Wed Apr 29 18:48:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm more in line with your thinking. $4.79 can barely get you lunch from McDonalds, so the cost for what PS Plus gives you (even after it has moved away from offering the catalog bigger budget games) still feels more than worth the value to me."
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,jacobi123,2,Wed Apr 29 21:42:13 2015 UTC,Yeah exactly my line of thinking :)
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,Doomsdays97,2,Wed Apr 29 22:06:36 2015 UTC,"Quick opinions on all the games;  Ether One: Might be interesting, never heard of it before. Doubt it'll last particularly long however  Race the Sun: One of the cheapest if not the cheapest game on the PS4 Store, it's been £3.30 or less for months. Not to say the game will be bad, but it's both a simple concept and a very inexpensive game.  Guacamelee: Played it before on PS3/Vita (It's already been a game of the month -.-), it's a decent game if you're never played it I suppose. Also much like Race the Sun the improved edition was very cheap if you got it last time it was on the IGC  Hohokum: Got very good reviews, will give it a try.  Murasaki Baby: ""Puzzle platformer horror game"", apparently it's quite short and got good-ish reviews. Not particularly interested in this one to be honest...  The Unfinished Swan: ""The Unfinished Swan is a videogame about exploring the unknown"" -.-, but to be fair it was rated highly and does seem like an interesting premise.  The main problem with this month for me is the lack of a triple A title on the PS3, which is quite odd. I can't help but feel they were trying to cut costs this month even as XBLG was pulling all the stops (AC4, Gears: Judgement, Terraria and Army of Two: 3 + Rayman Legends & Pool Nation on xbone). Maybe they're going to pull out all the stops at E3?"
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,BokuNoPickle,2,Wed Apr 29 23:04:57 2015 UTC,"not the greatest month eva... but still some games i hope to play.  PS+ is $50 a year so just over $4 a month, if you offered these 6 games for $4 i'd probably say yes"
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,iamkoza,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:43:34 2015 UTC,"But if this were a humble bundle for pc it would be $4 and that's it. No subscription fee, no losing access to the games if you stop paying."

PlayStationPlus,34abeg,ApolloIntheSky,4,Wed Apr 29 21:39:49 2015 UTC,"Wtf are people complaining about? 0_0 Honestly I was (at first) not impressed with the choices of games for the past few months when they were first announced, then ended up enjoying at least one title in each month after trying them out. And yet this month seems amazing to me! First, with Guacameelee. Granted, I already bought the game on a PSN flash sale a few months back, but for those who haven't played it yet? It's an amazing title! 9/10 in my mind. Ether One? I've honestly never heard of until now, but from what I'm reading, sounds very intriguing. Hohokum? Yes! I've been wanting to check out this title for a while. Awesome that now I get to for free. Unfinished Swan? Also seems awesome. Look at all the reviews on any sites via Metacritic, and you'd see each one of these games have an average of 80-95 on several sites"

If they regularly put out blockbusters then people wouldn't buy them and it would drain revenue."

PlayStationPlus,34abeg,bigwalleye,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:24:20 2015 UTC,"For everyone dissatisfied with the recent offerings, remember that they have a satisfaction survey for the previous month linked on the blog.

PlayStationPlus,34abeg,xaureatex,3,Wed Apr 29 17:48:21 2015 UTC,"That survey seems very poorly set up, since there's no way to say 'I don't have a PS4'. Why's there no N/A option? :/"

Race the Sun looks like something that I'll play for half an hour on my Vita and then delete so whatever. I'm going on a road trip on the 6th so I'm happy it's a Vita heavy month."

PlayStationPlus,34abeg,GhettroGamer,-1,Wed Apr 29 22:43:24 2015 UTC,"I apologize, didn't see that.  Personally, I think this is the worst month by a wide margin.  I'm not remotely interested in any of these games.  I'm not looking for 6 AAA titles, all I'm looking for is some variety, I am so sick of puzzle and platformers.  Sucks, looks like a wasted month for me."
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,pear1jamten,-2,Thu Apr 30 02:46:29 2015 UTC,Here's the thing... they're not free. I pay 15$/month for access to these and they are not worth the price at this point.
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,Holographicmind,6,Thu Apr 30 04:00:09 2015 UTC,You pay $15 a month?  Why?  I pay $4 and some change a month and Plus is definitely worth that.  I get 6 games a month and most of them are enjoyable.  I think it's great value.
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,DrunkeNinja,-1,Thu Apr 30 07:54:26 2015 UTC,is it really worth $4 though? i mean i have ps3 so i can play online for free and $4-$5 a month is more than i've paid for bundles with all these recent ps+ games that i already own. you think you are getting a deal and sony isn't profiting?
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,freezerburn666,4,Wed Apr 29 20:53:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, $4 and some change is more than worth it for me.  Yes, I'm getting a deal and Sony is profiting, those two things don't have to be mutually exclusive.  You cannot get all these games in bundles for less that $5, I game on PC too and some of these games are not even on PC.    April wasn't even that good of a month imo, yet that was still worth it for me with:  Tower of Guns, Never Alone, Aaru's awakening, Dishonored, Kill Zone Mercenary, and Monster Bag.  I liked Dishonored, Killzone, and Never Alone a lot.  Tower of Guns and Aaru's Awakening were subpar.  I haven't got around to the Monster game yet but I recently read some interesting info about it so it sounds pretty cool.    Overall, this was one of the lesser months and I still think it's more than worth it.  I'm not trying to say Plus is for everyone, but with me, I own all 3 platforms, I'm open to different types of games, and I generally don't care to replay games years later.  Not everyone feels that way.  Edit:  three of the May games are only on Playstation platforms so I'm not sure what bundle you got them in.  Not sure what bundles Ether One has been in but that is on PC.  I know Race the Sun has been in tons of bundles, but I don't know about this version of Guacamelee.  I know the regular version was though.  Half of the games are not even on PC though."
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,DrunkeNinja,2,Thu Apr 30 04:06:31 2015 UTC,"But you're also paying for online play, cloud services, etc. I'm not disputing the fact that the games aren't actually free. I understand that. But competitors are charging the same, often with less.   I don't want to hear, ""I DON'T PAY TO PLAY ONLINE ON STEAM"", I understand that as well. Shit, I mainly play games on PC anyways. But I think it is nice I get a few decent games a month for a service I would probably be paying for anyways if it were just required for online play."
PlayStationPlus,34abeg,GhettroGamer,-1,Fri May 1 06:34:48 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think you actually understand. You're paying  $5 per month to play your shitty 500 dollar console (every time I think about this it makes my blood boil, you're fucking paying to use something you already bought) and the 60 you paid for the actual game. Sony gives you 25 cents worth of shitty Humble Bundle phone game trash to thank you for investing between half a grand to 2k (depending on how many of their consoles you own).  Even Amazon's appstore gives better games away FREE every fucking day. yikes@people still supporting the blood sucking ghouls at Sony/xbox live"

More likely that Ubisoft didn't want to put it on sale again only a handful of months since the last sale, especially with a deeper than expected discount on the base game.  You can't look at this like Steam because they're operating in different market environments. It's easier if you treat it with a bit more patience. It's been on sale before, it will go on sale again, but don't be surprised if Ubisoft don't discount their entire PS4 catalogue at once."
PlayStationPlus,349etd,Desperaddos,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:06:38 2015 UTC,Why can I not buy Sleeping Dogs on my PS4. Is it not allowed in germany?
PlayStationPlus,349etd,Desperaddos,3,Wed Apr 29 13:15:06 2015 UTC,It's banned due to the violence and they chose not to censor it so it will never be available in Germany. The best you can do is import the disc version from elsewhere.

PlayStationPlus,349etd,Benj5L,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:09:20 2015 UTC,Is Murdered: Soul Suspect worth picking up?
PlayStationPlus,349etd,geshordan,3,Wed Apr 29 15:47:57 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's a good little murder mystery game that was critically mauled because it was too short, too easy, too repetitive and the story was a bit cheesy. All of these are much easier to forgive with a lower price point. If you go into this thinking more along the lines of recent Telltale games, with a hide and seek mini game thrown in, then you're going to have a better time than those who played it at launch.  I picked it up the last time it was on sale and had a good time, a solid 7/10."
PlayStationPlus,349etd,KyuubiReddit,1 point,Thu Apr 30 10:12:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for that. I liked the Walking Dead games so might be worth a look. Thanks.

PlayStationPlus,349dnr,fakeplasticmax,3,Wed Apr 29 10:23:30 2015 UTC,"Or you try the game, realise it's awesome, get into the lore and want some more! I guess you could look at it either way."

PlayStationPlus,349dnr,irishsandman,-3,Wed Apr 29 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"There is no Bioshock 3. Irrational Games only made Bioshock and Bioshock: Infinite. There was an abomination called Bioshock 2, but that isn't even really connected to the other two games."

PlayStationPlus,349dnr,irishsandman,-4,Thu Apr 30 10:03:38 2015 UTC,"Understandable. It's only a great name if you play the whole game, otherwise it's pretty generic.  I wasn't trying to be an asshole, just helping to educate because that second game sucks. ;)"

PlayStationPlus,349dnr,irishsandman,0,Thu Apr 30 17:16:43 2015 UTC,"The gameplay isn't bad compared to Bioshock (1). But the gameplay of Bioshock was getting old even by the end of the first game. It wasn't the highlight, the story-telling, mood, and world were it's high points.  If you tell me that you would play Bioshock, and then play Infinite, and then you'd still want to play Bioshock 2, I'll respect that, but I think it's crazy."

PlayStationPlus,349dnr,Sirusavath,4,Wed Apr 29 14:25:46 2015 UTC,I think it would have made more sense last month. The Old Blood comes out a week after the PS+ games so not a lot of people will have finished The New Order by then and will be satisfied with that at first.

PlayStationPlus,349dnr,mrwynd,2,Wed Apr 29 12:56:58 2015 UTC,It would be a good way to promote the new expansion. Games are often put on good sales before the new version comes out to boost sales. I like the cut of your jib.
PlayStationPlus,349dnr,cosmiccrystalponies,2,Wed Apr 29 12:05:05 2015 UTC,great game but already played it on pc

PlayStationPlus,349dnr,Wood_Ape,2,Wed Apr 29 15:42:23 2015 UTC,"I think knack is way more likely, but still don't think we'll see that either."
PlayStationPlus,349dnr,Wood_Ape,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:03:18 2015 UTC,Any particular reason? Or just because it's old?
PlayStationPlus,349dnr,Wood_Ape,2,Wed Apr 29 13:09:02 2015 UTC,"I'm with Harlequin on this one. The bigger games we are most likely to see will likely be old exclusive titles because Sony knows exactly the financials of the game as well as has control of distribution, which makes the process easier as there is less hassle involved. That means games like Knack, inFamous 2, LittleBigPlanet3, and Last of Us. I would be pretty shocked if a third-party developer/publisher want their games offered on PS+ just yet. The only real reason why they would want to do this is if sales figures reached a dead point and they want to boost interest if they are planning to make a series out of it."
PlayStationPlus,349dnr,Harleequin,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:10:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think history proves that theory at all. The only full priced game we've ever received on ps4 was from Warner Bros, Injustice. The PS3 library is composed almost entirely of 3rd party and indie games. I mean, it could be Knack. But it seems to be more of a wild guess. There isn't any real indication or reason it would be."
PlayStationPlus,349dnr,MulhollandDrive,2,Wed Apr 29 14:24:27 2015 UTC,"I feel you on that. However, the PS3 library is quite extensive and nowadays it is considered outdated of sorts. The biggest issue with PS4 is the size of the library of games. There just aren't that many third party games out there that will have a sequel, so there's almost nothing to gain from allowing them on PS+."
PlayStationPlus,349dnr,Dead_Skull,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:37:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get you. I think in the next 6 months, as the console approaches being two, that we'll see a real attempt to offer bigger titles. And we all know Knack, Black Flag, Killzone will be the first to go! But this month, approaching e3, I dunno, the timing just seems right to me. I'd just be happy with a price drop for Wolfenstein - 70 euro on the PS Store when you can pay for 15-20 for a physical copy!"
PlayStationPlus,349dnr,MulhollandDrive,2,Wed Apr 29 14:49:35 2015 UTC,"PS Store is one of the worst for sales. Sony just refuses to compete. I will admit to seeing some amazing deals, but that was only during the publisher sales (BF4 Premium edition for $24 was a steal).   To me, most single player games are absolutely overpriced. $60+ for a game that gives you a week or two of playtime just ain't worth it when the multiplayer games can be played daily for over a year and don't tend to get stale.  I agree with you, though, it'd be nice to see some better deals on the games they are selling if they aren't going to throw us a bone already. It's been over a year and still no AAA titles with PS+. It's bad enough they're forcing us to pay for PS+ just to get MP in games. The least they could do is offer better deals."
PlayStationPlus,349dnr,quasimoto406,0,Wed Apr 29 14:59:29 2015 UTC,Because there isn't any real talk about it. It's old and a Playstation exclusive.

PlayStationPlus,349dnr,Kage-kun,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:22:50 2015 UTC,It's definitely possible. When sales flatline they're more willing put out sales or other deals
PlayStationPlus,349dnr,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:46:44 2015 UTC,Usually if a title was coming out free on its release date there wouldn't be a preorder. I wouldn't mind it but Im surprised we haven't gotten the standalone killzone dlc yet

PlayStationPlus,346os4,Nawara_Ven,8,Wed Apr 29 03:04:49 2015 UTC,"I Enjoyed it, puzzles were both fun and challenging. The story was interesting, I'm tempted to buy it"
PlayStationPlus,346os4,inspiringpornstar,4,Tue Apr 28 23:25:47 2015 UTC,"It's a cool game and it's really difficult at times. I have owned it for about a year or so, and just pick it up from time to time and finally beat a level that I was struggling with months ago. Just keep in mind it is at it's core a puzzle game with a lot of anime cutscenes, and not much else.   I think it's a great game (even though it frustrates the ever living shit out of me and still haven't finished it) and bought it on sale when it was about this price and don't regret it at all. At this price I would say go for it even if you are on the fence about it."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,fieldstudies,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:33:11 2015 UTC,I bought it and this game is hard as shit and makes me aware of how wishy washy I am when it comes to relationships.  Basically fuck this game but I love it.
PlayStationPlus,346os4,SandbagsSteve,1 point,Fri May 1 19:34:19 2015 UTC,After your first playthrough you'll get the hang of how the puzzles work. Wait til you try those damn towers. If you're a trophy hunter you're going to want to break your tv trying to get those trophies.
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Vykim223,1 point,Sat May 2 15:42:42 2015 UTC,"I got it at release and still own it. It's a great game if you like puzzles and weird stuff. It was definitely a unique experience after coming off so many FPS and ""hold-my-hand"" titles. But honestly it's only the first play through for the difficulties which give a challenge. On second play through everything was a walk in the park.   Still not as challenging as the Soul's series but a good buy none the less. Also, it features animated cutscenes so if you're into anime then you'll enjoy it more."

PlayStationPlus,346os4,ErectusPenor,6,Tue Apr 28 21:14:13 2015 UTC,I would like to know the answer as well...  Even at normal price they are $5 cheaper than the HD collection.   Classic Konami.

PlayStationPlus,346os4,mrgodfro,2,Tue Apr 28 20:28:25 2015 UTC,Ouch my wallet too. I just had to re-up my PS+ subscription for another year on top of it. Gonna be a pricey gaming month... but the SAVINGS! :D
PlayStationPlus,346os4,tekchic,3,Wed Apr 29 03:17:11 2015 UTC,YOU CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO BUY IT!!!
PlayStationPlus,346os4,petrov32,7,Wed Apr 29 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"Any opinions on Battle Princess of Arcadias, Natural Doctrine, or Guided Fate Paradox?  There are so many ""definitely buy""s in the sale for me that I probably don't need any of the above, but I haven't heard much about these ones."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Nawara_Ven,2,Tue Apr 28 19:44:48 2015 UTC,"Battle Princess is kind of like a side scrolling fighter RPG.  I don't even know if that made any sense, lol.  I had a lot of fun with it.  I'd suggest watching some videos."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Folk_,2,Tue Apr 28 21:52:49 2015 UTC,"Guided Fate Paradox is a fine game if you like dungeon crawlers on isometric view It has similar mechanics as zettai hero project, but not as great."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,0NightFury0,8,Wed Apr 29 14:32:37 2015 UTC,Demons souls if you don't have it already.
PlayStationPlus,346os4,fml_twice,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:48:39 2015 UTC,"Ahh!! Want it so bad, I think! Played dks 1 and 2. Playing bloodborne, but I'm afraid it would be such a step backwards in gameplay that I won't be able to make myself play it all the way. Conflicted."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Ballsyugly,5,Wed Apr 29 03:54:12 2015 UTC,It's a really good game. Definitely my favorite of the Souls games. It was the hardest too IMO and last time I played the e online community was still decently active for a game that's been out so long.
PlayStationPlus,346os4,fml_twice,2,Wed Apr 29 04:21:28 2015 UTC,"I got all the trophies on Bloodborne today and I thought... I should try Demon Souls now. And bam! Its on sale. And I agree with you , Demon Souls is the only game I have ever quit playing because of its difficulty. I think Im ready to try again."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Eblan85,2,Wed Apr 29 07:24:03 2015 UTC,"I fucking hated it at first! Boletaria Palace is, IMO, the hardest part of the game. Once you get the hang of it though it's definitely all challenging as hell but doable."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,fml_twice,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:30:38 2015 UTC,"Harder than bloodborne? I thought I would breeze through bloodborne since I was hella good at dark souls, and dark souls 2 was pretty easy even my first time. But fuck was I wrong."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Ballsyugly,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:29:46 2015 UTC,I actually haven't played bloodborne. I was referring to demons souls and dark souls one and two.

PlayStationPlus,346os4,Ballsyugly,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:30:10 2015 UTC,Sweet! Have fun! Don't die though or it gets harder.
PlayStationPlus,346os4,fml_twice,3,Wed Apr 29 05:51:47 2015 UTC,"It is by far the best of the Souls games. It's harder, more unforgiving, the plot is tight, and the NPC's will compeltely enrapture you (especially the Maiden in Black). Just standing around the Nexus, talking to the Monumental, is an amazing experience."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,17th_knight,3,Wed Apr 29 07:27:33 2015 UTC,"You should get it. It has different mechanics, but by no means is a step backwards. And it has far better atmosphere than dks1/2."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,0NightFury0,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:34:56 2015 UTC,Better than dks1??impossible!
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Ballsyugly,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:30:08 2015 UTC,"That's the consensus of most people who have played all the Souls games. The atmosphere really blows away Dark Souls 1. Not sure if you were being sarcastic or not though.   Also, you should get the game for sure. The gameplay is by no means bad or outdated and you should have no problem getting used to it if you're comfortable with Dark Souls 1.   To further entice you, there is a boss level where you can become the boss for another player. Not like Dark Souls 2 where you get summoned by the Mirror Knight, but you are actually the boss itself.   One of the best boss battles I've experienced because other players were relentless in not letting me pass. You couldn't memorize attack patterns or anything else either because sometimes you'll face a player that was a mage, another time a person with a two hander, and the next someone with dex weapons."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Policeman333,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:52:19 2015 UTC,Dude that boss sounds great pretty rad. No I wasn't being sarcastic I loved the ds1 ambience. I did buy it though! Gonna play that bad boy tonight

PlayStationPlus,346os4,Ballsyugly,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:53:17 2015 UTC,"You should win the boss, help anyone win the boss or invade someone (you can only invade live people).  I think is very similar to dark souls."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,0NightFury0,6,Thu Apr 30 17:11:56 2015 UTC,The Witch and the Hundred Knight would be interesting at that price if I wasn't aware of the PS4 version coming up soon.
PlayStationPlus,346os4,ColinZealSE,5,Tue Apr 28 19:40:08 2015 UTC,Is the PS4 version going to substantially enhanced? I imagine it would be awhile till a PS4 version is $9....
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Nawara_Ven,4,Tue Apr 28 19:43:17 2015 UTC,Much sharper textures for instance. I suspect better lighting effects as well. PS3/PS4
PlayStationPlus,346os4,ColinZealSE,6,Tue Apr 28 19:46:23 2015 UTC,Is strider worth it? Seems like the best one out of the ps4 games.
PlayStationPlus,346os4,tggt00,3,Tue Apr 28 19:52:08 2015 UTC,"I really really liked it, was free some time ago from plus.  I feel it's absolutely worth the sale price."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,mrsparkleo,3,Tue Apr 28 20:16:37 2015 UTC,Fantastic game IMO. I haven't found myself playing a lot of the free PS+ games but this one I was compelled to beat and get all the trophies.
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Coos-Coos,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:45:43 2015 UTC,It was awesome and since it was already free on plus you can't get burned by it being put in a future IGC lineup.
PlayStationPlus,346os4,naylord,6,Wed Apr 29 01:54:17 2015 UTC,"so many games, so little money. Having a hard time picking what I want lol."

PlayStationPlus,346os4,heater06,4,Tue Apr 28 19:11:41 2015 UTC,"Gurumin and Revengance for the exact price of $10.50, just as much money I have in my wallet. Any other better combination that adds up to my budget that anyone would recommend?"
PlayStationPlus,346os4,rcrd,2,Tue Apr 28 19:31:29 2015 UTC,"Not really... Revengence is one of the best ""stylish action"" games you've ever played."

PlayStationPlus,346os4,Awkward_kidd,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:35:06 2015 UTC,"Is Ultimax a sequel or an add-on? I'm pretty sure it's a sequel but the title of the game makes it seem like an ""Ultimate"" edition."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,ImmatureIntellect,2,Tue Apr 28 22:27:23 2015 UTC,Ultimax is the sequel. It takes place right after the events of P4A.

PlayStationPlus,346os4,ImmatureIntellect,2,Tue Apr 28 23:54:40 2015 UTC,"Yea, I kinda got spoiled too, but I still want to figure out how it all fits in the story. So far I really like it (not as much as P3) but still. I'm currently in November, so I got a ways to go.  I played P4A at a friends house and liked it, and he said that Ultimax is even better. So I'm super excited about that too."

PlayStationPlus,346os4,-Clayton_Bigsby-,4,Wed Apr 29 01:31:06 2015 UTC,Can anyone tell me if they liked killer is dead? The only suda game I've played is killer 7 and I thought it was pretty neat. Does is it at least live up to those standards?
PlayStationPlus,346os4,jsm85,5,Wed Apr 29 10:05:34 2015 UTC,"If you like Suda51's style in Killer 7 then you'll be head-over-heels for a modern take.  A lot of reviews bash it because the reviewer didn't understand the game, or didn't play it long enough.  From the outset, the game seems insultingly simple in terms of hack n' slash, but by the end of your second playthough on the hard difficulty, you'll be dodge-countering at super-high speed and using quite a bit of tactical skill to beat the regular enemies, let alone the extremely unique bosses.  The game-noir style itself is worth the (now very inexpensive) price of admission, as long as you're into a little black humor, a little Mad Men-style chauvinism/machismo, and you're open to piecing the mysterious and symbolism-laden story together yourself.  (Note that, for some reason, the 5th mission was made into a DLC pack that certainly isn't necessary for enjoying the game, but it does flow a little better if you play this mission in order with the rest of 'em, and it's just a fund level/boss.)"
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Nawara_Ven,2,Wed Apr 29 11:24:19 2015 UTC,I. Am. Sold! Thanks!

PlayStationPlus,346os4,ImmatureIntellect,3,Tue Apr 28 23:55:53 2015 UTC,Was thinking about getting a PS3 this summer cause I've been super psyched for Under Night In-Birth Exe: Late cause it looks like an awesome game and plus it's by the guys who did melty blood. I don't even have a PS3 right now and I'm debating buying it.
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Das_Wood,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:31:29 2015 UTC,"I got a PS3 last year with the hope of playing a few exclusive games, like The Last of Us or maybe Uncharted. I figured I wouldn't get into fighting games because I had a stick for 360 and didn't feel that I needed another one.  Then... the sales. For not-very-much-money I soon found myself with a myriad of PS3 exclusive fighting games, like Blazblue Chronophantasma, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure All-Star Battle, Aquapazza, Guilty Gear Xrd Sign, Arcana Heart 3 Love Max!!!!! (and Skullgirls Encore with Playstation Plus), so I got a Hori RAP V4 (because it's compatible with PS3 and 4) and haven't looked back.  I'm not sure if I'll get Under Night In Birth this time 'round, I'm waiting for more of a price drop for it (and Dengenki Bunko Fighting Climax).   In other words... PS3 is great for casual fighting game fans that want a lot of different experiences."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Nawara_Ven,2,Wed Apr 29 14:57:41 2015 UTC,Yea with all these fighting games I want to play I need to get some similar competition to my level. I literally just started playing fighting games when I saw BlazBlue CP go on sale a couple months ago on vita and now I'm watching airdasher tourneys on youtube and UNIEL looks to be my favorite so far. It's awful how pulled in you can get with fighting games I'm already looking on ebay for a solid fight stick and then checking craigslist for a PS3 not to mention I'll probably get UNIEL and BBCPEX soon so that's close to $200 I'm already looking at haha.
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Das_Wood,3,Wed Apr 29 15:38:58 2015 UTC,Any thoughts on Hyperdimension Neptunia V? I'm aware of the fanservice-y stuff. Never played the other HDN games.
PlayStationPlus,346os4,rappin_raven,2,Wed Apr 29 05:58:37 2015 UTC,I would just get Re:Birth 1 and 2 first if you have a Vita. Or alternatively on Steam.

PlayStationPlus,346os4,Greenjuggleguy,3,Tue Apr 28 23:51:13 2015 UTC,"Its main feature is the fan service, which it does really well. If you're looking for a deep action game, look somewhere else."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,syrinaut,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:57:19 2015 UTC,"It's got a lot more depth in terms of character and battle system than it first seems; there are three different ""fighting stances"" per character (and 20 characters + 2 DLC) and you unlock new moves with each stance as you progress. It's pretty tough on the higher difficulty, too.  Multiplayer is fun and frantic as well.  $20 is by far the cheapest it's been."
PlayStationPlus,346os4,Nawara_Ven,4,Wed Apr 29 03:03:19 2015 UTC,Still no Xenogears. I don't this it's ever gonna be in the sales. Still waiting for it though.

PlayStationPlus,346r4h,Hawk798,3,Tue Apr 28 20:17:48 2015 UTC,Hopefully they make the AT-AT rail section into its own small PSN game. That would be pretty sweet.
PlayStationPlus,346r4h,360walkaway,0,Tue Apr 28 20:36:41 2015 UTC,"Or just delay the game until a worthy product can be made. But EA has no spine, so this wouldn't happen. They would look at the money loss upfront instead of the increased gain down the line. Or they will add the stuff people want as 20 dollar half thought of/ half finished dlc.  Essentially we are getting plants vs zombies: Star Wars edition."

PlayStationPlus,33zqei,chicken_and_ham,5,Mon Apr 27 13:00:42 2015 UTC,"With Project Cars coming out and Driveclub not being in the top sellers anymore (not present in VGchartz top 75 at least), I think it would be a good time. Or June maybe."

PlayStationPlus,33zqei,havoksmr,3,Tue Apr 28 18:59:29 2015 UTC,Not sure we'll ever see that. It is cheaper for Sony to let that game die and cut their losses than fix the servers.
PlayStationPlus,33zqei,Trigliceratops,2,Mon Apr 27 23:17:35 2015 UTC,"I really hope so, they keep saying they're working on the PS+ edition and currently the game is pretty cheap so right now would be the perfect time to put it up."
PlayStationPlus,33zqei,_meppz,6,Tue Apr 28 01:52:42 2015 UTC,"Since there are no indie games coming out for ps4 next week, there could be a chance of getting a AAA PS4 game. Wolfenstein, hopefully? Also hoping for persona 4 golden on the vita."
PlayStationPlus,33zqei,fakeplasticmax,3,Tue Apr 28 09:37:12 2015 UTC,My (I think semi-) realistic hope is Octodad and Wolfenstein as a little game big game combo

PlayStationPlus,33zqei,Jennorocks,6,Mon Apr 27 20:33:21 2015 UTC,"Well looking at the trend of sales and xbox gold games: PS4: Rayman Legends, Nidhogg PS3: AC: Black Flag or Splinter Cell Blacklist, plus something less known Vita: Child of Light, for another title hard too say... maybe Dokuro, Murasaki Baby?

PlayStationPlus,33zqei,Espurreyes,37,Mon Apr 27 03:40:34 2015 UTC,I was really disappointed with the free games this month. Tower of guns was clunky and absolute shit. The platformer type game called something I can be bothered to remember wasn't anything to write home about either. The fox one was ok. Here's hoping for something decent next month.
PlayStationPlus,33zqei,Parallel-Parkinsons,14,Mon Apr 27 03:44:24 2015 UTC,"Platformer was Aaru's Awakening.

PlayStationPlus,33zqei,ratchan,5,Mon Apr 27 05:20:55 2015 UTC,Good call on ToG. Absolute crap.
PlayStationPlus,33zqei,Kdawg74,11,Mon Apr 27 20:45:48 2015 UTC,Yet I somehow can't stop playing Tower of Guns...
PlayStationPlus,33zqei,DrugCrazed,8,Mon Apr 27 07:22:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, same here.  Actually had fun trying to beat it."
PlayStationPlus,33zqei,yanggmd,2,Mon Apr 27 12:05:02 2015 UTC,Did it bug out for you so that no enemies would fire at you? That made the game fantastically easy...

PlayStationPlus,33zqei,TomPheysey,3,Mon Apr 27 18:50:01 2015 UTC,Retro City Rampage was already given away for PS+ on PS3 and Vita
PlayStationPlus,33zqei,SomaXD,3,Tue Apr 28 00:38:58 2015 UTC,I can totally agree with that. They just don't do it for me anymore. I don't mind indie or puzzle or anything just as long as it's not 2D sidescrollers.
PlayStationPlus,33zqei,cup-o-farts,2,Mon Apr 27 17:49:59 2015 UTC,I was tired of 2D side-scrollers also... until Shovel Knight.

PlayStationPlus,33zqei,Boroda_UA,2,Mon Apr 27 14:16:16 2015 UTC,"Injustice was announced before the ""hack"", it was to get people with expiring PS+ subs to re subscribe as the PS4 was a year old."

Evolve though has already dropped to 40 dollars and with over a 100 dollars of dlc with only about 1700 people playing  on average according to steam last 30 days it won't be too long till we see it on plus.  The devs have even talked about it originally being f2p before 2k acquired it and changed it to retail."

February and March had an excellent collection of indie games that where both intriguing and had loads of replayability. But April.... I don't even know what to say. It was garbage for the ps4 users. I played all games in one day and didn't enjoy any of them.    Aaru's Awakening is rage enducing, beautiful game though. But just not for me  Tower of Guns, i can't even comprehend how repetitive this game is. All i did was hold the trigger button and straved left and right, and jump like an absolute idiot. The maps were blant and overal it was very bad.   Never alone looked pretty decent but theres no replay value. You play it once and that is it.   I'm looking forward to the month of may."
PlayStationPlus,33zqei,dannygojo,3,Mon Apr 27 13:55:44 2015 UTC,Yeah i don't mind indie games either but lately that seems like all they want to give. I'd prefer 1 indie game for each console every month.

Honestly, I can't tell if I enjoyed it or not. The first 3/4 of the game was a pretty fun and enjoyable puzzler, but the last chunk was... well, it turned from a 'figure out what to do' game to a 'learn to time stuff really well'. I didn't really enjoy the end of the game for that reason - everything seemed to come down to a lot of very specific timing.  That said, this game is the Madoka magica of games - it looks all cute and whimsical and things get really dark fast."
PlayStationPlus,33qrec,spedmunki,2,Fri Apr 24 19:10:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the end of Monsterbag was freaking tedious. I enjoyed the first 3/4 and the progression of the story was interesting, then it just became an enraging timing grind, no longer fun puzzles."
PlayStationPlus,33qrec,LMW-YBC,3,Tue Apr 28 13:53:29 2015 UTC,"I've already played Killzone Mercenary, back when it launched. The BETA for it got me pretty excited to see what the full game had to offer, and boy did it deliver! The multiplayer is as stellar as it gets for an FPS on Vita, offering a decent selection of maps with lots of loadout varieties: and the singleplayer is short I'll admit, but it's enjoyable and is surprisingly replayable, with different ways to tackle each level that spice things up.  But holy moly the graphics! The game is easily one of the best-looking games to grace the Vita, maybe even the best-looking handheld game period, and the framerate rarely dropped in my experience so it's well-optimised. Guerilla Cambridge did the Vita a great deed making Killzone Mercenary for Vita, it's a solid FPS game that pretty much every Vita owner should play.  MonsterBag on the other hand is a brand new game, so I've had less time with it. From the time I did spend with it though, I enjoyed it. The best aspect of the game is easily its presentation, very colourful and charming animation that feels like it's from a cartoon. Well, not really when you see the deaths, did not expect the game to be so brutal with the way people die given its cartoon-y look, and the pink blood (taking from Danganronpa presumably) doesn't really lessen that.  The puzzles range from decent fun to unnecessarily frustrating. The earlier levels are simple enough and are fun to go through with the progressive havoc playing out as you solve things, but the later levels get really annoying with less obvious solutions and seemingly broken enemy turning (and sometimes they spot you when they shouldn't have been able to), and this made me less eager to complete the game. I did though, and it only took me about 3-4 hours, with no real replay value besides the extra ""mode"" at the end (haven't played it).  It's the perfect example of a PS+ game in my opinion: not worth the price tag it bears, but still worth playing."
PlayStationPlus,33qrec,DragonbornAgain,2,Sat Apr 25 10:18:09 2015 UTC,"I actually bought Killzone day 1 when it first released, and I absolutely loved it, and the inclusion of bots as DLC well extended it's lifetime for me. Fantastic game. Monsterbag I just started yesterday, and I'm enjoying it so far, it's different and I really like the art style. Only on chapter 10 hopefully it keeps its quality throughout."
PlayStationPlus,33qrec,Blabadon,2,Sat Apr 25 12:06:17 2015 UTC,"I've posted a lot about Killzone since I played it two years ago. I think its campaign is mediocre at best and by-the-numbers boring at worst. The multiplayer is fantastic though, particularly maps like Intel where I've racked up 30+ kills before.   Otherwise, the contracts for other medals is a badly botched idea and the story is a mess. I liked it a lot for MP but I need room on my memory card for other things.   Now onto MonsterBag, which I'll quote from a site I post on, endlessbacklog.com:  ""Beat MonsterBag (7/10)  A wonderfully creative game that takes its own simplicity in strides and is overall quite affable throughout. It's a short puzzle game involving a bag that's actually a mini-monster trying to get back to the girl he belongs to. The game should have stuck to its best parts, namely navigating and sneaking around crazy people to reach the girl; when the game deviates, it starts to lose its charm a bit, and ultimately doesn't regain it.  Also, this game is actually much darker and much more violent than any early impression can ever make it out to be. Both qualities prove to be a bit shocking and welcome in a game like this when they're handled right. The violence in this game is zany, with pink blood spewing everywhere and disgusting (I mean this in a good way) situations, like (assuming you guys aren't playing the game anyways, it's a relatively light spoiler)  MonsterBag  Man, turns out Chile is as weird as Japan huh?  For the darker parts, the game actually briefly touches about what it means to be a child, how experiences affect people, and the nightmares that can come to those kids who don't have powers - and the respites they find elsewhere. I don't think I'm reading into the game too much when I say these things because the few, if only one, chapter that has these moments are incredibly strange and up for interpretation in ways only video games can do.  Unfortunately, for as much praise as I want to toss at this game, it shies away from its bolder ambitions and does some hoopla with alien and alien invasion tropes. Some of this is to good effect, but most of it is eh. The worst part is the game is a mess technically. The numerous cutscenes don't run at the Vita's native resolution and are compressed, and the game glitches very often. Luckily these don't freeze the game as much as a level restart is needed, but all gets insult to injury when the frame rate judders very often. It's not that it's not smooth, it's just that faster camera movement speeds show a noticeable juddering effect. MonsterBag deserved better, but with what it does have, it does well."""

PlayStationPlus,33qrec,dneill99,3,Tue Apr 28 16:20:41 2015 UTC,Touch controls. The goal is to jump person to person by touching the next person and your monster hops to them.  You will have to have timing and solve puzzles in order to make it down the line.  Some people in line have angry eyes and when they see you they smash you. So watch the eyes and find objects to help distract people that are road blocks to make your way to the end of the line.

PlayStationPlus,33ic4f,maxwellmaxwell,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:32:17 2015 UTC,"Let us know if this has worked. Because I highly doubt this will work for PS3. That's why Sony changed it for the PS4 where you have to have one concolse as your primary (that's the one that can share games over all users). With the PS3 you can log in and download PS+ games on a lot of consoles (also not registered ones) which are playable by all users of that console for as long as you (the original downloader) has an active PS+ subscribtion.  For the Vita I don't think this is an issue, since the Vita is bound to one account. Nothing on the Vita can be used by more than one account (that's why you have to reset the whole console).  So, please let us know if it has worked and if your 'friend' has 'cursed you all the way to hell' for disabeling her games :-)  And to answer the other part of your question: yes, you can safely de-activate all your consoles (max. once every 6 months) and re-activate the ones you want. No problemo."
PlayStationPlus,33ic4f,maxwellmaxwell,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:09:18 2015 UTC,It worked fine. Only downside was strangely enough my vita themes went away after I did it and I had to redownload them. That was all. She cursed me all the way to hell before that so I'm going to assume the same. We haven't talked about it but she did unfriend me on PSN.
PlayStationPlus,33hj9i,Gaffeire,2,Wed Apr 22 15:57:44 2015 UTC,Well I guess we can update the sidebar now with the PS3 version there. I originally made a post to have the cross buy symbol removed as they didn't have plans to do so but glad now they changed their stance on the matter!
PlayStationPlus,33hj9i,bugzkilla,2,Wed Apr 22 19:57:38 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping the fact they specifically stated PS Plus version is an oversight, I bought it on release and it'd be a pretty shitty move to only give cross buy to those who didn't pay for it"
PlayStationPlus,33hj9i,sicjoshsic,2,Wed Apr 22 22:20:57 2015 UTC,"This means that if you buy the game on PS4, PS3 or PS Vita, you would get the other versions to download at no extra cost when they were released.   They explain everything in the article."

PlayStationPlus,33goby,thefigpucker,2,Wed Apr 22 11:18:40 2015 UTC,Happened to me about a month ago on my PS4. I don't even own a Vita. I just stopped playing.

I had the issue some time ago, I picked up the most recent one (I don't recall whether it was the local or server one) and had my progression back.  I play this game almost daily on my PS4 and Vita so I thought it was something wrong due to a corrupt save when it checked the status.  Doesn't explain how it can happens to someone with only one console though."

PlayStationPlus,33goby,irish91,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:46:26 2015 UTC,This game isn't cross-save is it?  Why do you not have local content for it?  There's no cloud-save advantage (besides minimal space savings) if games don't support cross-save.
PlayStationPlus,33glwv,coyote1284,5,Wed Apr 22 10:43:46 2015 UTC,"I think the most frustrating cross-buy content is the Zen Pinball 2 tables.  If you buy them on PS3 or Vita, they can be imported to the PS4, but if you buy them from your PS4, you only get the purchase(s) for that one platform.   I've no idea what happens if you buy from the website but I have a feeling it's the same as above.  And I can't remember if Pinball Arcade content works similarly but I want to say yes."
PlayStationPlus,33glwv,El_Fader,2,Wed Apr 22 21:39:37 2015 UTC,"What I do is, go to the Playstation Store on my phone/computer and ""purchase"" the free games that way do I don't have to turn on every platform, go to the store, search for PS+ and then add them to my cart.  If you go to the website you'll also see what's crossbuy because it'll have a list under the title for the platforms you're purchasing it for.  Also, once you add each of them to your cart, you just click Download to PS** or Download to All Systems which implies it's crossbuy."
PlayStationPlus,33glwv,Arsis82,3,Fri Apr 24 12:41:17 2015 UTC,"One person raising a question about Binding of Isaac because it was released as if it was crossbuy does not mean there is general confusion.  The post was answered correctly and quickly, no one was supporting the assumption that Binding of Isaac was crossbuy so it's strange to see you reply twice then make a whole new post dedicated to a rather minor point."
PlayStationPlus,33glwv,WearingThin,6,Wed Apr 22 11:40:50 2015 UTC,"Not true, this has come up many times before and people ask in seperate threads each time.

PlayStationPlus,33cza5,bmacorr,31,Tue Apr 21 14:59:56 2015 UTC,"It would be really interesting to know in detail what kind of obstacle they are facing and why it is taking this much time. Being more transparent with the issues and communicating to the community could help them (or could have helped them). Anyway, all of the pieces in this puzzle are a bit shady, so how cool would it be to know the actual concrete problems - who knows if some gamer/programmer could have a solution. Unlikely, I know. A long shot, I know."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,larsvondank,35,Tue Apr 21 16:16:57 2015 UTC,"I think at this point it is fairly clear to anyone who has ever worked on software.  The fundamental manner in which the game was written likely does not scale very well at all.  Meaning, in a development environment, and even in some lightweight testing, the game probably ran fine.  But as soon as they launched the game and experienced the real world with a large number of users all on different qualities of connections, everything just shit the bed completely.  There's no way to fix that with some simple code tweaks and a bit more server horsepower.  They likely have had to fundamentally rewrite major parts of the game to try to make it all work with the number of users that will be descending upon the game if/when it releases to PS+.  Being more transparent is only going to overload consumers with information they largely won't understand, and would probably just create more questions than answers.  I don't think they're really trying to hide anything.  The game got mediocre reviews and can already be bought for under $40, so clearly it is not selling like hotcakes.  Basically just a big bunch of incompetence with no easy way out.  At this point I'm most surprised that they are still even bothering with the PS+ version.  It will be a $20 used game by the time they launch it, so there's not much point anymore."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,junkit33,17,Tue Apr 21 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"I come from a software background and this is probably what happened, but it really makes me question what they were thinking if this is indeed the case.  The game was boosted and hyped so much everyone knew lots of people were going to playing and purchasing it.  For there to be something fundamentally wrong with the code that doesn't scale well that's a serious blow to Evolution and Sony especially since they're both software companies.  A day or week-long delay is unfortunate but a normal circumstance, but half a year delay is really quite unacceptable and almost unheard of for me personally, especially since they are allowing purchasers to play online (what would've happened if millions of people bought the game?).  Something just doesn't add up."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,junkit33,4,Tue Apr 21 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"It's not really that unheard of in the software world for such a large project to end up a year or two behind.  There's an entire world of literature out there on how it happens, and in this case there was probably plenty of blame to go around.    The Sony business unit may have decided to hype the game too early, and the naive Evolution studio overpromised and underdelivered.  I'm sure at some point expectations were also never properly set about how many people would be playing the game on PS+.  Keep in mind that Evolution's last totally new IP was Motorstorm in 2006 - lots of things can change in 8 years, so they may have been completely unequipped for the challenges of Drive Club on the PS4."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,three18ti,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:36:49 2015 UTC,"Well that's how the games industry works now.  They sell hype and don't have to deliver because you've already given them your money (and you can't return an ""opened"" game).  This is only the most recent example, but I've personally stopped preordering games because I'm tired of getting excited for something only to find I can't play it."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,MaximumDrive,3,Tue Apr 21 23:52:12 2015 UTC,"This more or less. I don't bother preordering and gamefly is a godsend. But this....I dunno. They're supporting the paid version and you can go online with that no problem, but the free version is still being delayed? After half a year?

PlayStationPlus,33cza5,Coos-Coos,13,Wed Apr 22 20:21:48 2015 UTC,The obstacle is that people are still caving and buying the game and since so many people from the studio were laid off there isn't really anyone to blame anymore so why not milk it for whats it's worth.

PlayStationPlus,33cza5,adtst3,10,Tue Apr 21 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know. I meant its been 6 months since it released in NA (October I believe), but looking at it from when its original release date was to be, its even more of an embarrassment."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,PhillAholic,-6,Tue Apr 21 15:43:36 2015 UTC,"Project Cars was delayed, Batman was delayed, Uncharted was delayed.... You can't go by the original release date on games."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,aids0109,11,Tue Apr 21 17:44:06 2015 UTC,But games that are promised at such events and backes by companies like Sony should be more realistic about their dates.
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,PhillAholic,-4,Tue Apr 21 16:30:17 2015 UTC,Games are only getting more and more complicated. The alternative is shipping games broken (BF4).
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,Aon_from_accounting,13,Tue Apr 21 16:57:12 2015 UTC,"They did ship this game broken.  You couldn't log in to the servers for over a week and the ""Club"" in DriveClub requires it.  The weather effects didn't get patched in for over a month iirc and that's was one of their biggest selling points to the fucking game.  I still kick myself for buying this game.  It's not just bad, it was shipped broken and remained that way for a while.  By the time they were done fixing things and giving away DLC as an apology I had long since moved on."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,PhillAholic,-8,Tue Apr 21 17:03:09 2015 UTC,They delayed it for everything they could test. They couldn't really test the number of users on their servers at once like that.
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,Aon_from_accounting,3,Tue Apr 21 18:32:14 2015 UTC,"Actually, they tried.  They used synthetic tests and failed miserably in trying to secure launch day issues from happening.  Many triple A developers have run into these issues and they've been well documented.  Diablo 3 launch comes to mind.  However, most users were able to still log on in spite of these issues and those that weren't were on within the week.  This was not the case with Drive Club, in fact it was pretty much the exact opposite.  Most couldn't log in and even after more then a week, the server ""fix"" was to limit people from logging in and they didn't even setup a queue system.  It was just try and fail, and keep repeating.  At first anyways.  This is without the weather effects btw, which weren't taken out of the game to make things run smoother at lunch, these were unfinished and not released day-in-date with the game.  I don't know if you're a PR guy for the company or what, but my point stands.  This game was released unfinished.  Just as your previous example, BF4, was.    You may like the game, and that's great.  Good on you, someone has to like this game.  But they shipped an unfinished product.  End of story."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,PhillAholic,-6,Tue Apr 21 18:42:54 2015 UTC,"I never said the game was finished at launch. You've got people complaining that games get delayed, people complaining that they ship without all their features, people complaining that DLC comes out too early, too late e.t.c."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,Aon_from_accounting,5,Tue Apr 21 18:58:05 2015 UTC,"I never said the game was finished at launch.      The alternative is shipping games broken (BF4).    I simply ask that you pick one of these statements, as they are mutually exclusive. The operative word you used was ""alternative"" after all, implying it wasn't broken when it shipped.   This was all in your justifying this games many well documented delays.  It seems your argument was that you'd rather have a delayed launch then a broken game.  I totally agree with this sentiment.  I just think it's funny you chose this game to stand on, as it shipped late, and broken.  Actually, if you include the promises for a PS Plus version, it's still late, and it's still broken."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,PhillAholic,3,Tue Apr 21 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"Yea sure, that's exactly how it works."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,uniquecannon,3,Tue Apr 21 20:26:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind the delays, but logic would dictate that getting more time to work on a Game means it shouldn't be a broken mess at launch."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,PhillAholic,-1,Tue Apr 21 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"No, that would only mean it should be less of a mess at launch. There's no way for a developer to test this specific issue without a beta. Most games don't have betas so it's a real possibility."

PlayStationPlus,33cza5,mr-photo,16,Tue Apr 21 18:44:02 2015 UTC,if it comes out as a free version without any added content I'm definitely not buying the upgrade especially since it's going to basically be obsolete by the time it comes out.  it's been a 1.5 year delay it's almost insulting if they don't give ANY value-added to the PS+ version.
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,PhillAholic,2,Tue Apr 21 15:43:44 2015 UTC,"The entire debacle has guaranteed that I will not purchase a single thing from them.  Had they come out with the PS+ as was planned, and it was indeed a fun game that I enjoyed then I likely would have purchased some upgrades to add to the trimmed down PS+, but treating us like complete garbage right from the start has made save my money for Project Cars instead."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,mr-photo,-9,Tue Apr 21 15:22:12 2015 UTC,treating us like complete garbage right from the start   What are you talking about? They've done nothing to you.
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,ThcLoserGuy,7,Tue Apr 21 15:29:56 2015 UTC,"It's been a long time, so maybe you've forgotten how they have treated us PS+ users.  Forget about the fact that this game was supposed to be a launch title and PS+ version along with that for a sec, and just look at the fact that this game was clearly and full heartedly announced as a PS+ IGC title in October of last year.  The release date came and went with no PS+ game being given.  The being treated like garbage began there when the complete lack of communication began on what was going on and why the PS+ version was never released. It took them several days before they finally announced that they were having issues and needed to fix them before release, and it was clear that their online multiplayer servers were not up to the task of supporting their full game users let alone all the future PS+ users. The radio silence was the first slap in the face of all PS+ users. Ever since then the PS+ version has been a single line in all their updates as ""trust us... we're working on it"" with no communication on a if/when/how it will be released. This is clearly another slap in the face of all PS+ users in that they really do not care about us and are just trying to make us go out and buy the full version instead. Taking over 6 months to fix an ""issue"" with the game shows that they clearly never intended to give out the PS+ version of the game for us who wanted to try it before buying the extras or full game for that matter. If they really had any respect for us the PS+ version would have just been released as a temporary singleplayer with all the multiplayer online aspects of the game disabled until they could resolve their online issues. This would not impede the online performance of the people who paid for the full game, and give us PS+ users at least half of what we were promised in a timely matter. As of right now (6mth later) we still get jack... other then the ""we're working on it....... """

PlayStationPlus,33cza5,PhillAholic,0,Tue Apr 21 17:33:37 2015 UTC,"Also the PS plus version was intitally advertised as the full game ""minus a few cars and tracks"" 90% of game content is not a few. That is straight up false advertising."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,ouroka,-9,Tue Apr 21 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"The being treated like garbage began there when the complete lack of communication began on what was going on and why the PS+ version was never released   You haven't directly paid for the game. They don't owe you anything. The problem is clearly a lot larger than some small fix so the developer likely didn't have any news for weeks as it was. Remember that they need to be able to keep their servers stable when over a million people hop on their servers the day the PS+ version comes out.    they really do not care about us and are just trying to make us go out and buy the full version instead.   Yes, because all the bad PR they received was so worth it. It's a total scam to sell more copies / not be shut down by Sony for how bad they screwed up. I'm sure all those laid off are laughing all the way to the bank.     If they really had any respect for us the PS+ version would have just been released as a temporary singleplayer with all the multiplayer online aspects of the game disabled until they could resolve their online issues.   You act like they can just snap their fingers and come up with that. That's a lot of work that was never budgeted that would ultimately slow down the process of supporting the game for paid users (Season Passes were already sold, they need to get the DLC Out) and the process for getting the PS+ version out."

PlayStationPlus,33cza5,ziekke,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:25:52 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a go once it comes out.  I'm not really a big racing guy, but I make it a point to at least try all the PS+ games.  I've been surprised before."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,Laser0pz,-8,Wed Apr 22 01:47:13 2015 UTC,"So a failed integrated demo has you ruffled?  Driveclub is extremely supported, and boy has it become something I didnt anticipate. Evo have done a stellar job, tbh.  Pcars is a different game, i assume you know its the xbox360's RACE PRO 2.0? No one went crazy for that except us simracers. It's not going to make driveclub a void of nothing. Not even close."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,m-p-3,6,Wed Apr 22 01:56:05 2015 UTC,"You may not have been around or don't remember but DriveClub PS+ was a part of the major push into PS+ on the PS4. It was marketed as a launch title and was a part of a lot of the PS4 marketing.   It isn't just a failed demo   At the end of the day, though, I don't ever think about it until someone posts here about Sony/Evo mentioning it.  I won't download it nor will I support DC or Evo moving forward. That's my choice just as its yours to support it.   The only people I see ruffled are the people who bought or supported the game. I'm not bothered in the least since I didn't give them any money"
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,mesenkomaha,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:03:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, I have been around - im highly aware of it since e3. Bought driveclub day 1 because I love racing games and it has delivered to my expectations. I didn't buy it for a ps+ focus. One thing you have to keep in mind, Promises come short, and most times they don't work considering complexity. Maybe following gran turismo since 97 has numbed me.  But i understand your stand. Yeah, bad move on evo and bad move on sony. Ill accept the incoming downvotes though."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,Gnardude,2,Tue Apr 21 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily disagree with you either. Problem is if they can't do it they shouldn't promise. Sony has been around long enough, so has Evo. Not to mention if it didn't have the mention of being a ""free ps4 launch title"", ""racing game day 1"" with a bunch of people (including Evo's management) trying to defend it as ""not a demo"" and it being a huge incentive to subscribing to PS+ for PS4 owners then it wouldn't have had so much backlash.   They rode a lot of things on that promise and are still failing to pull through on it.   Also - people buying it day 1 are clearly not the demographic for the PS+ edition and are absolutely not going to feel the same about a missing release that has no direct benefit to them, especially when the online component launched so poorly.   I've always said on this topic: nobody forced Sony/Evo promise a PS+ edition (most importantly with the particulars that they promised). They made the effort to plan and execute it and failed, it's on them."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,Bierfreund,0,Tue Apr 21 16:17:34 2015 UTC,"Project CARS is going to be huge considering we don't have any staple racing games. The only ones we have are Driveclub, which is great but a critical failure (due to its rocky launch), Rivals which is a buggy mess, The Crew which has physics floatier than a balloon filled with helium, and GTAV which doesn't even focus on racing."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,Chef_Lebowski,3,Tue Apr 21 23:32:08 2015 UTC,What a clusterfuck.
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,ricker182,7,Wed Apr 22 00:52:08 2015 UTC,"Never going to happen.  I'm surprised they keep giving these bogus ""updates"" and stringing us along."

PlayStationPlus,33cza5,ColinZealSE,6,Tue Apr 21 18:01:22 2015 UTC,I bought it for $20. It's okay. Gran Turismo is still better.

PlayStationPlus,33cza5,NFX45,5,Tue Apr 21 19:07:26 2015 UTC,I bought the full game a couple of weeks ago and I love it. Haven't had this fun with a arcade racer since Grid on PS3. It's not perfect but it is really fun and pretty cheap.
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,NFX45,4,Wed Apr 22 11:58:52 2015 UTC,"Just came to say that I purchased the full retail game, and also the Annual Pass, and there is so much great content, that even playing it almost exclusively for the past couple of months, I am still nowhere even close to getting to the end. This game is massive, super fun, and the online aspect is incredible.   Just because they failed on the PS+ Free version, don't ignore this really amazing game.  (I usually hate driving games too, this is the first one I've enjoyed.)"
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,Sicmay,3,Wed Apr 22 16:48:44 2015 UTC,"I think that's why there's so much disappointment.  It no doubt looks like an amazing game, and hell I probably would've purchased it IF they didn't promise a free PS+ version to use.  I know that the announcement of Driveclub definitely pushed me to purchase PS+ in anticipation of the game coming, and now it's left a really sour taste in my mouth.  On one hand it looks like an amazing game and I do want to play it, but I just can't bring myself to support the fact that there's been nothing done in HALF A YEAR for those who were waiting on the PS+ version.  Even though it is technically supposed to just be a demo it's the fact that there were MANY people who chose to purchase a PS+ in anticipation of this game or because they heard it would be a free version."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,ouroka,2,Fri Apr 24 06:32:10 2015 UTC,"I waited too, for a very long time. Then decided that I'd rather play it, then continue to wait. :)  It's been worth every penny."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,Sicmay,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:45:48 2015 UTC,Don't you have to have PS+ in order to play multiplayer anyway? I don't think too many people will feel cheated since they would have eventually got it anyway.
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,i_like_reddit_,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:47:28 2015 UTC,"As I mention in another comment, I didn't buy ps+ solely for driveclub but it was an aspect that was marketed to me and definitely played a hand in me signing up for the service."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,devensega,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:53:33 2015 UTC,"I can understand that. But would you have signed up for the service without it? My point was it would be hard to have that ""I felt cheated and bought this for nothing"" feeling when most would buy PS+ anyway."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,d_pyro,0,Tue Apr 21 18:03:02 2015 UTC,"I doubt the announcement of Drive Club PS+ edition made loads of people signup for PS+. I was already subscribed and it didn't make me feel cheated either. Software problems can be really tough to troubleshoot and fix without causing additional problems. As a few other commenters have said, netcode with worldwide service in mind isn't an easy manner.  Look at Battlefield 4, it had a terrible start with network problems but people now say it is very good.  It will come one day, and I picked it up a few weeks ago for $20 bucks in store and it's very enjoyable and as /u/sonician said, there is tons of content."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,jpagel,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:23:16 2015 UTC,I didn't sign up solely for driveclub but it was certainly marketed hard for it and definitely played a hand in me signing up.
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,phbohn2,2,Wed Apr 22 00:58:34 2015 UTC,I can certainly agree on that. But I felt they backed down from the commitment pretty fast.   I didnt even have a PS4 at the time.   I hope it gets released for everyone else though.
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,pwnjones,2,Wed Apr 22 05:12:19 2015 UTC,I don't know why anyone cares about the ps+ version in the first place- it was essentially a glorified demo of the full game
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,peterkozmd,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:39:12 2015 UTC,"It was actually supposed to be 80% of the game, but they then cut it to 20%."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,AL2009man,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:57:02 2015 UTC,Not quite. What they claimed was 80% was more like 20% in terms of content. It's more a case of how much you value each thing. In their eyes you were getting the full games engine and modes but not all the tracks and cars- probably 80% + of their work would make it into the plus version. From a customer perspective in terms of content that might only represent 20%
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,SiriusC,-5,Wed Apr 22 01:18:16 2015 UTC,People wanted a free platinum and then bitched when they couldn't get it.
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,Romiress,2,Tue Apr 21 17:38:18 2015 UTC,"In all honesty you are missing out if you don't get this. I paid twelve quid a month ago and haven't stopped playing it since. Online head to head racing works for me but suffers from what all online racers suffer from; other players.   The best online component are the challenges, I've sunk hours into them and it's really started a fierce competition between my mates. Texting your mate at 12.30 am when you've shaved four hundredths of a second off of his time is priceless.   The Gameplay straddles that nice territory between hardcore Racer and arcade too. It's not going to bite your bollocks off if you make a slight mistake but you still have to concentrate in order to drive well. It's fun as fuck too, something I struggle to have in the more simulation type games.   I'll be playing this for a while yet, Project Cars can wait."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,jumpyg1258,1 point,Thu Apr 23 07:34:52 2015 UTC,"To be fair I Don't know why you're getting downvotes, you actually gave some decent insight into the game which is nice since we're all waiting for it and don't know what to expect."

PlayStationPlus,33cza5,tbx5959,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:27:52 2015 UTC,A case of a little too late  not sure what they hope to salvage at this point maybe some goodwill? i dunno next time maybe they won't join up with sony and hype it up on ps+ prior to it being done and tested  i actually feel bad for them as its obvious they want to make up for the whole mess but its really hard to come back after this backlash  It's obvious they never intended for this to happen. Funny thing is if they were a big company like ubisoft or EA you know they would be forgiven in a heartbeat  Assassins Creed Unity sucked and buggy as hell? let's throw some freebies their way and see the rage disappear  Funny how this company tries the same and can't seem to catch a break oddly
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,crokexcore,2,Sat Apr 25 05:36:00 2015 UTC,"Evolution is actually owned by Sony, so it wasn't a team-up it was just Sony marketing the shit out of a game they had a vested interest in.  Now that it's had so many issues it's like it never existed on the general PS news sources."
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,frozengash,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:12:32 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that Sony/Evo gave away freebies as well for compensation.   It didn't work out for them that well.
PlayStationPlus,33cza5,Dooder39,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:31:03 2015 UTC,"Assassins Creed Unity sucked and buggy as hell? let's throw some freebies their way and see the rage disappear   At least Uibsoft eventually patched and fixed most of the issues in AC:U fairly fast and gave away freebies when they realized how bad they fucked up.  Driveclub developer?  Took a PS+ exclusive launch title and turned it into a demo (they promised it would have most of the content of the full game) that never released, but they keep releasing DLC and going after money instead of releasing the PS+ version."
PlayStationPlus,33ets8,hopeucanswim,9,Tue Apr 21 23:09:02 2015 UTC,BoI Rebirth isn't crossbuy at all. The fact that it was 'crossbuy' for PS+ was an extra bonus.

PlayStationPlus,33ets8,Romiress,-1,Thu Apr 23 12:32:25 2015 UTC,Offering both/all versions on PS+ is not what makes 'crossbuy'.
PlayStationPlus,33ets8,CA719,2,Wed Apr 22 10:16:51 2015 UTC,Notice how one is in air quotes and one is not. It's not Crossbuy - it's 'crossbuy' because it imitated crossbuy and let people pick up multiple versions when it was on PS+.
PlayStationPlus,33ets8,sony4life,4,Wed Apr 22 15:11:47 2015 UTC,You had to have 'purchased' both versions when it was free because it's not crossbuy.

PlayStationPlus,33ets8,coyote1284,2,Wed Apr 22 06:32:13 2015 UTC,"From my experience, they don't. I'm pretty sure Boi isn't cross buy, but they let it be when it was free. Kind of like Dragons Crown."
PlayStationPlus,33ets8,likeyes,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:13:23 2015 UTC,"Offering both/all versions on PS+ is not what makes 'crossbuy'; buying one and getting all is 'crossbuy'. This is true for 'crossbuy' games not in a current IGC. If you actually buy CounterSpy for PS4 today, you still get all versions. BoI and DC were never 'crossbuy' even though the PS4 and Vita versions were offered on PS+ simultaneously."
PlayStationPlus,33ets8,coyote1284,1 point,Wed Apr 22 10:15:57 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly sure that's what I said. That the games aren't cross buy, but Sony allowed them to be for a month. It seems like you're just being picky with my choice of words, which is stupid, especially since when the games were on ps+ you did get all versions available at that time (like counterspy), so while it may not have lasted, still cross buy."
PlayStationPlus,33ets8,likeyes,0,Wed Apr 22 16:01:42 2015 UTC,"Counterspy was 'crossbuy' for free while on PS+ because it's ""crossbuy"" in general. If you go to the game description for any version is says:   For one price, get this content for your PS4™, PS3™ or PlayStation®Vita systems. Purchase it on one system and it will automatically appear for download on the other systems at no additional cost.   If you pay for it today, you still get all versions. Being on PS+ has nothing to do with it.  BoI:R is not and wasn't 'crossbuy' because you had to add both versions to your cart, even though both were offered simultaneously on PS+."
PlayStationPlus,33ets8,coyote1284,0,Thu Apr 23 09:46:33 2015 UTC,"Still got both versions for free, and you did have to ""buy"" them, so still a technical limited time cross buy.

PlayStationPlus,33ets8,likeyes,0,Thu Apr 23 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"No, if you have to 'buy' both versions, even when free, it's not crossbuy at all.

Use PSDLE to easily view and/or export your available PS+ content, keeping a local copy for future reference. Decide from there.   Another, more time consuming process, would be to check your e-mail history of purchase information and hope you still have them. As other users have mentioned or hinted at, the content pretty much disappears from your download list/etc. when the subscription lapses."

PlayStationPlus,332sf7,GODZILLA_BANKROLL,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:41:58 2015 UTC,this. i cant believe how garbage it is and how many years it's been. it's so fucking basic
PlayStationPlus,332sf7,daigoro06,0,Mon Apr 20 01:05:19 2015 UTC,"Yep. I wrote up a sweet excel sheet actually that keeps track of all my games, and categories them by Sony my console."
PlayStationPlus,332sf7,Jinketsu,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:45:39 2015 UTC,"yeah my download list doesn't show anything PS Vita, thats who I know the download list isn't showing everything as I picked up everything vita every month for a year. They only thing my list shows is Don't starve RG which I actually bought. Sounds like I would have to buy plus again and hope there is something worth playing that I got while I had a subscription"
PlayStationPlus,332sf7,168523,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:20:31 2015 UTC,You don't own anything you got for free through PS+. You only have access to all those games when PS+ is currently paid for and active. Once you let PS+ lapse you either have to buy them or renew PS+. If you really want to play those games without PS+ I would buy them while PS+ is active so you get them at a slight discount.
PlayStationPlus,332sf7,DishwasherTwig,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:27:25 2015 UTC,"Can you not view the list of content you've acquired in the past via account.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com? There should be a section, after you login, listing all your purchases on every system you've registered (I think it might be ""Multimedia content"" in English), including rented movies and PS+ games.   Can you check that?"
PlayStationPlus,332sf7,muzaq,1 point,Sun Apr 19 10:20:23 2015 UTC,"Not everything shows up there. I'm in the same situation and I've checked this, download list on PSN, previous downloads on playstation.com, purchase history, etc. They all show some of the content I got while I had an active PS+ subscription, but not all of it. As far as I know, the only way to completely tell all of what you've bought is to check the confirmation emails you got after buying them."
PlayStationPlus,332sf7,jagenigma,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:10:39 2015 UTC,"You could check your email if you don't delete them. A little bit more of a hassle, but it's doable. They show up as purchases for $0.00."
PlayStationPlus,332sf7,shinHardc0re,1 point,Sun Apr 19 11:07:21 2015 UTC,There is a downloads list within the psn store. It says 'view downloads' on it.

PlayStationPlus,333sgj,frakistan,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:27:03 2015 UTC,"So just out of curiosity, if you move from NA to EU, you need to repurchase all of your games? That really sucks if that's the case."
PlayStationPlus,333sgj,RussellGrey,1 point,Sun Apr 19 07:15:35 2015 UTC,Just create another account in EU. Use both accounts in same PS4 and made your PS4 primary in both the accounts.
PlayStationPlus,333sgj,arijitlive,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:42:00 2015 UTC,"Good idea, assuming that works. I don't particularly care about trophy data, etc. However, someone who does might not like the idea of having to create an entirely new account."
PlayStationPlus,333sgj,RussellGrey,0,Wed Apr 22 03:31:18 2015 UTC,Thank you for the answer. I remember having a PSN game from PS+ locked after my subscription ended but I got another subscription from another store and that game worked. Maybe I got the subscription from the same store. I don't remember
PlayStationPlus,333sgj,ipot_04,2,Wed Apr 22 13:20:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the PS3 but the same also happened to me. Last year I subscribed to PS+ for my US account just to get Outlast for free (My primary account is EU-based and has a PS+), once the 1 month sub on my US account expired the game was inaccessible.  If I just knew that would be the case, I would've bought Outlast instead of a 1 month PS+ sub."
PlayStationPlus,333sgj,zero86sk,1 point,Sun Apr 19 07:21:29 2015 UTC,"it would make more sense to retain those titles, since Sony themselves encourage having multiple PSN accounts"

Its a great game, and for $2.50, its at a great price.  Its an amazing 2D sidescroller MOBA, with a wide collection of different characters to play as. Not quite as vast of a selection as the other games in the same genre, but you can still get many hours of entertainment.  Bonus points to this game for being couch co-op!"

PlayStationPlus,32yoqd,heisenbergfan,3,Sat Apr 18 00:43:44 2015 UTC,I recommend you actually get it on steam.  Bigger player base (ps4 version has a very small player base) and updates happen first there.   It usually drops to a dollar or two during a sale.
PlayStationPlus,32yoqd,SticklySnipe,-1,Sat Apr 18 07:15:34 2015 UTC,2d sidescroller? Sounds like it's going to be on PS+

PlayStationPlus,32yoqd,hellfroze,3,Sat Apr 18 05:30:43 2015 UTC,"I actually platinum'd Spec Ops, and I don't platinum that many games. It was the right combination of great game + manageable trophies that made me go for it. According to psnprofiles, it's my fastest platinum, at 2 weeks and 3 days, to give you a sense of the challenge level.  You will have to do 3 run thrus, though, as I recall. I don't want to spoil anything but if you go for it, after the 1st completion, look up what people say about the way it ends before starting another run."

On two occasions I've talked to someone through live chat support and gotten reimbursed within 48 hours.. one was for the price difference for a game I bought right before it went on sale, the other for buying the wrong seasons of a TV show.. they file your claim right then and that's that."
PlayStationPlus,32yoqd,Coos-Coos,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:07:20 2015 UTC,I bought the protection plan even though I was outside of the period of eligibility so I asked for a refund and it took almost 2 months of phone tag.

PlayStationPlus,32yoqd,heisenbergfan,5,Sat Apr 18 02:42:33 2015 UTC,All this for $40.50. Not bad.    Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two - I've been wanting to try Epic Mickey 2. A nice reason to dust off my PSmove.   Cars 2: The Video Game - for my kid Toy Story 3: The Video Game - for my kid Dante's Inferno - That one GOW clone that I always wanted to try. only $3!  TOUCH MY KATAMARI - Wanted the Vita version.  BloodRayne: Betrayal - I thought the animation looked great as a hack n slash.. Hotline Miami - maybe i'll actually play it. i didn't like playing with a keyboard and mouse on PC Rayman Origins - I've always loved rayman.. I never got a chance to play this.

PlayStationPlus,32yoqd,heisenbergfan,5,Sat Apr 18 05:10:23 2015 UTC,It is very god of war.  If you like that gameplay you will probably enjoy it.  Also surprisingly a lot of bits out of the book.

PlayStationPlus,32yoqd,SpaceMercenary,3,Sat Apr 18 00:46:15 2015 UTC,The cheaper one piece is a dynasty warriors game. It's exactly what you'd expect.

When you play on ""Normal"" mode, the game doesn't register your inputs like it should.   Game ends up being frustrating to play and unsatisfying considering you have to mash buttons like crazy to get a passable grade (game thinks you're awesome when you go out of sync). Easy is rather fun and playable, and I'd have fewer complaints otherwise, but unfortunately you can only play the first 3 levels on Easy, which is really dumb.  MAYBE it's just the digital version, but I've heard a lot of complains from other people.  Sorry for this mega long post, but my God that was one of the few time I was really disappointing by a game purchase. I hope they make a patch/sequel that will make this rhythm game fun to play."

A western themed GTA if you will.  RDR: Undead Nightmare is a stand-alone expansion, the story is a zombie themed spin off out of the vanilla RDR and can be played without playing the original game although references here and there might go over your head. It's a solid Western/Zombie shooter game.  Read Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare Collection is both the main game and the standalone expansion in the same package. At a start screen you have to pick which one you wish to load, there's no progression into either game naturally. (If you finish RDR, Undead nightmare won't load automatically and viceversa)."

On PS4 every PS4 except for one is not activated at all but just works when you log in to your account.  The single one which is activated has no reason to be activated once you delete your account and so should deactivate itself as you delete it.  Anyway, whether I was right or not, it's not Sony's recommended method.  http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps4/basic/relinquish.html  Apparently that's how you actually should deactivate before you sell/dispose of the PS4.

But there was something that made me want to stop playing. But when I wanted to end playing, I was already halfway through the game and I was like ""Aw well, let's just finish it.""  And I regret it. Some parts in the later stages are just unfair and barely playable with the controls. And don't get me started on the final boss. That guy is just unfair and horrible. And when I finally beat that mf, the game crashed. I still got trophies for winning, but I had to defeat him AGAIN to see the ending...which I didn't. I deleted the game. Gosh, I want my time back that I spent with this game.  It's not a bad game itself, but it's just badly designed, I guess."
PlayStationPlus,32t3dp,Kr1ll1nX,2,Thu Apr 16 17:33:02 2015 UTC,"The controls are the only thing that make Aaru's Awakening difficult. And you cannot change them.

PlayStationPlus,32t3dp,zombieducklings,8,Fri Apr 17 00:57:14 2015 UTC,"Dishonored was great, although I didn't like that the good ending was only exclusive to 'peaceful' gameplay. I played the entire game stealthily, wasn't caught a single time but I decided to kill some guards just because I have all those abilities at my disposal. I think the ending should have only been related to how you decide to deal with key targets.. if you kill all the key targets, you get the bad ending but if you let them live, you get the good ending. The story wasn't all that great anyway so it didn't bother me that much. The gameplay is where the game really shines.  The other titles are, as per usual, terrible. If you give us indie titles, at least give us good indie titles like Dust and Resogun, not some glorified crap. It's hard for me to believe that anyone can defend shit like Tower of Guns or Aaru's Awakening, Minesweeper and Pinball are more enticing than that. Never Alone was alright but has no replay value and was way too short.."
PlayStationPlus,32t3dp,zombieducklings,1 point,Sat Apr 18 11:32:46 2015 UTC,But the point is that the dead bodies attracted the rats. It has nothing to do with how stealthy you were in killing them.  Edit: autocorrect error

They will keep being terrible until December when it's time for us to renew our subscriptions.. we'll get another ""Lel look at our AAA games, plz resubscribe"" announcement and then it's gonna be rinse and repeat. The service isn't what it used to be, I'd prefer PS one titles like at the very start over games that the Atari 2600 would have declined. But with Star Wars Battlefront, GTA online and more I depend on it for the multiplayer.   It doesn't have to be AAA but how about indie that's actually good? Or y'know.. if they release Thief or Sherlock Holmes on the PS3, why not give it to the PS4 as well? Those games have been released on both consoles at the same time. I'd take a good indie over Thief any day, though."
PlayStationPlus,32t3dp,Gregtacular,2,Sun Apr 19 07:36:25 2015 UTC,"can we expect something good next month for ps4?  there are aaa games out there nobody really cares about. what about, bound by flame, murdered, watchdogs, wolfenstein, trials fusion, ground zeroes, second son, rayman, lego marvel, thief, sherlock, black flag, knack and killzone they really should atleast give us one of them, they  exaggerate it with indiegames and the big problem is, that those indies are really terrible and bad. look at tower of guns or awk awakening, who plays those games? are they serious with the april lineup? and nobody says something, every month i hear the same sentence, for 2$ a month its a really good package. no it isnt if they continue to treat ps4 costumers like second class people."
PlayStationPlus,32t3dp,Smallkittenfeet,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:18:16 2015 UTC,"I've only had time to complete just the second mission where where you kill High Overseer Campbell but I'm loving Dishonored so far. The amount of player choice is insane and makes me feel like I really have options, unlike most games which say go hear and complete the objective this one way. While the story is so-so, the world itself is very cool and well-realized. I'm predicting Dishonored 2 is announced at Bethesda's E3 conference. Would make sense since they just put it on both PS+ and Games with Gold."
PlayStationPlus,32t3dp,ThcLoserGuy,1 point,Sat Apr 18 14:46:48 2015 UTC,"The more I kill, the more I begin to enjoy Dishonored."
PlayStationPlus,32t3dp,Blabadon,2,Thu Apr 23 11:51:19 2015 UTC,"Didn't they say something about if a game had lower than a certain rating on metacritic it wouldn't be considered.  Now TOG and AA are both new to PS4 games but they were out on PC BEFORE the PS4 they could have looked at reviews and such.   TOG is a cluster fuck of shit. It should be called Tower of Shit.  AA is just terrible and I'm guessing Aaru got awakened because he was tired of the game dev's shit.  Never Alone is barely good for one playthrough, after that unless you are a trophy hunter there is nothing. One playthrough can be done in 2-3 hours not to mention the game is very boring.  Sony needs to get their shit together or PS4 players are gonna stop subscribing. I know of two friends who have to renew next month that are waiting to see the games because if they aren't good they aren't subscribing. To be fair neither of them play online games that much they mostly sit in parties and talk, which you can do without PS+."
PlayStationPlus,32t3dp,viciousJack,2,Wed Apr 22 08:40:27 2015 UTC,As a non-native that grew up in Alaska I have a much deeper appreciation for Never Alone than a lot of people. Not all games are just games. There is a lot to be learned about the Inuit culture that the game does a great job of conveying.
PlayStationPlus,32t3dp,Blabadon,0,Tue Apr 28 19:59:44 2015 UTC,they were out on PC BEFORE the PS4 they could have looked at reviews and such.    TOG has a metacritic on PC of 77 which is above any arbitrary limit set by the IGC (and even higher than most AAA games on PS4 looooool).  http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/tower-of-guns  I really don't see what you are getting at here.
PlayStationPlus,32t3dp,chosenAntdead,-2,Wed Apr 22 19:18:21 2015 UTC,"Well it plays like a giant piece of shit. No idea who on that site gave it such high marks but they are probably stupid hicks who have no idea what a good game is and circle jerk over it just because it's ""indie""."

PlayStationPlus,32oiyj,papa_bear_uk,10,Wed Apr 15 17:03:47 2015 UTC,this is where the consoles NEED to be more competitive with the b&m stores.   why go digital when it cost more money to take up more space on my hard drive?
PlayStationPlus,32oiyj,Fruhmann,3,Wed Apr 15 17:21:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I know I know Sony doesn't want to piss off the market.   Look at Apple, they've revolutionised market places by causing upset but at the cost of what the consumer wants. If only Sony followed suit."
PlayStationPlus,32oiyj,papa_bear_uk,7,Wed Apr 15 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"digital games were supposed to be cheaper than physical. no materials to manufacture, no transporting, no store and sales person needed.   what happened?  they don't want to upset the market, well the market is upsetting them. i have most of my games in physical copy because it's almost always cheaper than digital. i'm sure i'll get bloodborne in a few weeks for $40 somewhere else and sony will still have it on psn for $60."
PlayStationPlus,32oiyj,Fruhmann,2,Wed Apr 15 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"Buying digital games is the dumbest financial thing for me to do. First if all it's the full price of €70 for months and months. In retail there's often deals that save you 10, maybe 20 euro if you're lucky. Secondly when I'm done with the game, that's it. It goes in my library never to be touched again. I'm not the kind of guy who goes back to play games from years ago. Physical discs I can return for 20 maybe 30 euro and delete all the data.   Where's the financial incentive to go digital? If money isn't an issue for you then digital must be pretty sweet."
PlayStationPlus,32oiyj,Dininiful,2,Wed Apr 15 23:52:08 2015 UTC,"i'm 100% with you. the only digital game i've bought for ps4 was gta5. and of course it was $20 less in about a month, but that's just my luck. thing is, it's $40 on sale at stores, but still $60 on psn.  there is no incentive to go digital. at all. unless you have crippling social challenges and removing one retail interaction is worth the price difference, then i see no reason for people to do digital."
PlayStationPlus,32oiyj,Fruhmann,3,Thu Apr 16 00:07:03 2015 UTC,"Apple doesn't need to ""appease"" people with physical games and apps, everything is digital. There would be a much bigger uproar if they stopped having stores carry games by undercutting them digitally it would seem. Maybe next gen they could make it digital only?"
PlayStationPlus,32oiyj,bugzkilla,7,Wed Apr 15 18:29:54 2015 UTC,£40 on sale? Fuck off Sony. £65 for Lego Marvel not on sale?! Who pays this!?

PlayStationPlus,32oiyj,CurbedEnthusiasm,3,Wed Apr 15 20:05:27 2015 UTC,WTF?   This is fucking bullshit. Where are the savings?
PlayStationPlus,32oiyj,synthballs,2,Thu Apr 16 09:05:57 2015 UTC,I wish companies would step foot in a brick and mortar store and look at the prices you can get these games for physically. Even without going preowned you can manage to get the majority of these titles for twenty to thirty dollars cheaper.   I understand not wanting to put them out of sorts but at least make sure the prices have parity at the very least.
PlayStationPlus,32oiyj,Sicmay,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:01:58 2015 UTC,And even then brick and mortar is shit pricing compared to online
PlayStationPlus,32oiyj,WearingThin,1 point,Thu Apr 16 02:06:25 2015 UTC,"It's in the publisher's interest to keep it there though, they've already sold the game to the retailer, they're the ones who have decided to sell it at a loss to clear inventory.   Sadly because of this it's going to be difficult to cut them out like Steam, too much is invested in the current model."
PlayStationPlus,32oiyj,peat76,1 point,Thu Apr 16 08:56:30 2015 UTC,We can't compare steam to psn or xbl unfortunately. Steam don't sell PCs in bricks and mortar shops. Whereas if Sony or Microsoft piss off the bricks and mortar shops there is then no one to sell their consoles. I imagine the retail companies have made this quite clear to Ms and Sony.

Here in Mexico  you can get CoD and FIFA for pretty cheap as soon as three months after they come out, half the price. I can get it far cheaper physical used than the 30$ sale in the PSN right now. At least I grabbed San Andreas and Liberty City Stories for eight bucks so I guess it was alright."

I didn't mind Ben Affleck in Daredevil. Or Colin Farrell  But what I immediately didn't like in Powers is taking the NY-dark noir setting of the comic and putting it sunshine California.   From there it just got worse, with cherry picking story lines from the first couple of arcs and making them seem superficial, petty and generally not interesting.  I'll definitely come back to it, but I had no desire to return to the series after the first episode ... especially after thinking about what the show could've been on FX with Kyle Chandler as Walker."

So less  These types of things quickly fall apart into SOAP OPERAs where the super hero is doing less fighting and mostly standing around talking and basically turns into a a contrived romance  They quickly fall out of ideas. It becomes cliche and hackneyed   The writers have good ideas the first few episodes and they quickly lose steam. Does it happen in other series? Sure But especially in superhero ports  I imagine if spiderman was ported today it would be less action and more talking to viliians and broading about his love life   So you'll excuse me if i'm not to eager to jump into a superhero tv show with near zero action budget thats less action and more a babbling telenovela   I'd rather have a full movie with a better developed story and plot than an episodic one pieced together only to derail. Doesn't help that they are less action and more talking about their love lives and boring shit nobody cares about  and no i'm not saying budget and action are everything. Its more a negativity towards them porting superhero genre and them quickly forgetting that its about the action and not so much about them sitting around talking about their problems. ie: gotham, Agents of Shield,etc tv shows rarely get good superhero ports that don't go downhill pretty quickly. I don't want mind story and talking,etc but not when its the main focus with maybe 20% action because their budget is so low and what cgi there is looks like crap"

I've had ps plus since September last year, but only just found out about adding all free games to your cart a couple months ago. I think it's silly that I can't get binding of Isaac for my vita after getting it for free last year. I've made sure to put every single free plus game in my cart since I found out about this. Better to be safe than sorry."

PlayStationPlus,32lyti,Romiress,2,Tue Apr 14 21:50:04 2015 UTC,"I am confused. So the issue is that i didn't ""purchase"" it for free back in the day, to ""collect"" it into my library?"
PlayStationPlus,32lyti,Pman-47,2,Tue Apr 14 21:53:49 2015 UTC,"Yes. The games are not naturally cross buy - they were all available on PS+, but you have to have purchased them individually."

PlayStationPlus,32g7ge,wykdvypr,7,Mon Apr 13 16:56:12 2015 UTC,Dishonored is basically the game to play if you want to play a modern Thief game. Cuz the Thief that came out last year was not very good at all.

PlayStationPlus,32g7ge,Knight_Soiaire,6,Sat Apr 18 17:46:00 2015 UTC,Bought it during its release and I have never fallen out of love with it. Without a doubt my favorite game on the PS3. I've played through it and the dlc so many times I lost count.
PlayStationPlus,32g7ge,DaxterAttano,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:54:11 2015 UTC,Same here. I'm so excited for the Bathesda Keynote at E3 for the possibility of an announcement of the sequel.
PlayStationPlus,32g7ge,WolfintheShadows,0,Tue Apr 14 02:10:51 2015 UTC,"Another ditto. I don't have a ton of time for gaming anymore, so while my gf puts in massive campaigns in ESO and Dragon Age, I have to be picky about what I play and how rewarding it is for the hours I can play. Games that give a consistently great experience during the first few hours, the learning curve, the slog, and the full experience get my attention because I feel rewarded playing in brief bursts or longer sessions. Red Dead Redemption, Infamous, Skyrim, and Dishonored all fit that bill for me, and all are games I put the time into to get their platinum trophies, because I could have fun progressing the story, chasing the next achievement, or just fucking shit up. Now on PS4 The Last of Us and Tomb Raider are the most recent titles I've become invested in and put what time I have into. There are others like Assassins Creed that I can enjoy, but I would say Dishonored is in an echelon of few games I would give a true A+ to for ""I always had fun, and I often felt awesome""."
PlayStationPlus,32g7ge,nutsocharles,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:45:18 2015 UTC,"Very interesting you mention that. I've never played Dishonored but I absolutely love every other game you mentioned, so this has made me think twice. What turned me off to Dishonored was that it looked more like Bioshock than anything else (I enjoyed Bioshock, but it's not one of my favorite games or anything). Since everything else you mentioned, Skyrim, Red Dead, Infamous, Last of Us, and Tomb Raider, are all in my top ten favorite games, you think I should give Dishonored a try?"

I never bought it because I'm terrible at stating hidden in stealth games, but in Dishonored it doesn't matter so much. Unfortunately I wastes some earlier runes because I thought I would try to be stealthy then changed my mind."

PlayStationPlus,32g7ge,WolfintheShadows,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:12:29 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite games from last gen. I love how much freedom you have to approach the levels. You can just be brutal and relentless and kill everyone in sight or you can go stealth and avoid them all. And there's an alternate ending if you can go through the whole game without killing  anyone. It's supremely hard to pull off, but so much fun. Especially the level with the big party. It's so friggin hard to get in and get out without alerting everyone and having to kill someone."
PlayStationPlus,32g7ge,Coos-Coos,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:46:04 2015 UTC,"I loved it. Played complete stealth, so without being seen, no kills, perfect etc. for the trophies. Just made one mistake by poisoning a drink. Had to do it all again and that sucked a bit."

Dishonored, Dying Light, etc. So this is definitely a worthy addition to the collection if you somehow haven't already picked it up."
PlayStationPlus,32g7ge,Tre_Q,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:17:03 2015 UTC,"I was never interested enough into this game to buy it....mostly because I suck at stealth games. The only stealth games I can succeed at is splinter cell. So I'm trying to be stealthy....and failing miserably most of the time. I can stealth past half a level...get spotted once and all of a sudden an alarm is blaring and I'm fending off like 10 people.....killing them. Loving it though, especially the combat. I heard this game has two endings....guess I'm getting the high chaos ending whatever that is. I've only done three missions and have barely used my rune powers I have enough runes for another power. Loving the game immensely though."
PlayStationPlus,32g7ge,SIRTreehugger,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:26:32 2015 UTC,"Just play the game however you want to, don't feel constrained by a certain playstyle just because of the endings. You'll have more fun experimenting with what the game gives you on your first play through."

PlayStationPlus,324qsu,AiwassAeon,3,Fri Apr 10 16:19:00 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking Costco is at least 5-10% below standard retail price on everything they sell, including all video game merchandise. Even the hottest new release game may be only $55 on day 1 while everyone else has it for $60.   If they can't sell it at a discount they usually just don't bother carrying it."
PlayStationPlus,324qsu,junkit33,7,Sat Apr 11 00:54:14 2015 UTC,They are on eBay all the time for $40.  Keep an eye out for the spend $100 and get $15 back in your wallet.  I recently bought 2 $40 cards and used that $15 I got back on that flash sale a little while ago.  I had to spend $0.25 on some stupid app to get past $99.98 but it was worth it.  In the end it came out to 2 years for $65.
PlayStationPlus,324qsu,Decyde,2,Fri Apr 10 22:10:32 2015 UTC,40 usd is probably more than 45 cad
PlayStationPlus,324qsu,AiwassAeon,2,Fri Apr 10 23:07:55 2015 UTC,"Yea, $45 cad is $36 usd, forgot to check the currency exchange."
PlayStationPlus,324qsu,Decyde,2,Fri Apr 10 23:45:32 2015 UTC,"I had to spend $0.25 on some stupid app to get past $99.98 but it was worth it.   In the past they've allowed buying a PS+ membership to count. For example, in the past ""Spend $50 get $10 back"" promos, if you bought a PS+ yearly sub card for $49.99 you would still be eligible for the promo.   But again, this was the case in the past, things may have changed."
PlayStationPlus,324qsu,Policeman333,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:57:24 2015 UTC,I wasn't about to take any chances and the people on slickdeals had the link for the $0.25 app to buy.    I'm sure if I would have called and thrown a fit on the phone that they would have allowed it if I didn't qualify.  I din't want to go that route though.
PlayStationPlus,324qsu,Decyde,2,Sat Apr 11 19:49:30 2015 UTC,"Buying PS+ in CAD is already a deal, this is just a cherry on top."

PlayStationPlus,324qsu,naylord,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:19:08 2015 UTC,"No it still is even if it doesn't feel that way. Our money has less buying power, plain and simple. If you try to buy games on steam or humble indie bundles you are either buying in USD, and hence paying lots more or paying in adjusted CAD prices and still paying more.  Games being increased to 70 bucks is actually still a good deal based on how weak our dollar is, they should be 75. PS+ remaining 50 is like we are getting 10 off right away when it comes to the amount of buying power we are applying to getting that huge vat of games."
PlayStationPlus,324qsu,mabba18,2,Sun Apr 12 06:46:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely regular price.  Makes me wonder if there is money to be made buying them in CAD and selling for USD. With the dollar low and cashback from Costco, it might be worth it."
PlayStationPlus,324qsu,CrazyAuron,4,Fri Apr 10 16:42:34 2015 UTC,"If you sell them on eBay, you may not make that much, if anything.  There's a seller right now who's selling them for 40 bucks USD, which amounts to around 50 CAD, after taxes, and eBay fees, you're more likely to lose money."
PlayStationPlus,324qsu,mabba18,2,Fri Apr 10 16:52:17 2015 UTC,"Good points. Sales tax would be the kicker. Maybe if someone were to trade them privately for Amazon.Com credit, it would be a good way to acquire USD at par anyway."

This game was made by one guy though and ported by another company so I can't be to hard on his optimization. The porting company should have fixed this.  Thought about putting title ""indie is killing the ps4"" as a joke but didn't want too big of a battle Royale. In any case games ok though it does do this from time to time but I have to ask is the ps3 version working or is it even worse on stability."

PlayStationPlus,3221l1,letsgometros,28,Thu Apr 9 23:09:35 2015 UTC,Since Vita's digital game saves will be deleted if you delete the game. The plus service is tremendously useful since disk space on the vita is a luxury
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,xxfay6,14,Thu Apr 9 23:14:04 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't see this as a feature, more of an unexpected fix to a major flaw in the Vita content manager.  I mean, why can't we have basic file saving magagement? Why? I don't want to be cloning 4GB of a game just to keep a single savefile."
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,xxfay6,2,Fri Apr 10 00:47:29 2015 UTC,"Actually, yes they did. It was really easy to use exploits on the PSP so they needed to safeguard that, even the PSP emulator of the Vita has been hacked and patched numerous times with that.  Being said, the Vita platform has been rock-solid since release with its already strict file management, but making save files hardwired to games is just plain inefficient, plus I'm sure one could sideload a savefile if they really wanted to."
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,xavis,1 point,Fri Apr 10 10:40:39 2015 UTC,"yeah, but as far actually hacking the vita, no one is interested in hacking it. no is really interested in it at all expect for a small group of people who see JRPGs as the end all be all of games. so vita hacking is pretty much out of the question. its all PSP side hacking which is pretty much a dumb effort because you can find a psp for $20-$30 and have a better experience with it."
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,Heratiki,3,Fri Apr 10 16:34:42 2015 UTC,I do have a vita so that is definitely useful.   It'd be great if you could pick up and play with the same game save across multiple playstation's
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,specterofthepast,4,Fri Apr 10 20:47:59 2015 UTC,You can it just requires as much work as using more traditional media like Flash Drives. Understandably it's not perfect but it does allow for you to download your save to a friends machine when you visit.
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,phbohn2,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:15:53 2015 UTC,Sony using proprietary memory cards is infuriating.  I could buy like 6 SD cards for the price of one of their cards.  If I want to play Killzone:Mercenary I have to delete 8GB of games or buy a 40 dollar card.
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,MaximumDrive,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:22:41 2015 UTC,Didn't they change it recently where you can delete the game data and still keep your save data?

PlayStationPlus,3221l1,bigdwb1024,3,Thu Apr 9 23:58:57 2015 UTC,Once a week? Is the game that buggy or are you just breaking all kinds of crazy things that are corrupting your game?
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,reallynotnick,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:10:41 2015 UTC,"i had a bad habit turning auto save off when i build experimental stuff, realize its been 4 hours and i've put down 3-4,000 pieces of redstone , i notice the world is getting laggy then soon as i hit the start button it says ""minecraft failed to load can not continue"" and you either loose what you been working on since your last manual save or the file corrupts and im my case i only loose what i did since the last auto upload of my save (8am each morning). truthfully i should be building on pc not ps3. i use too much redstone to keep the game stable on ps3"
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,bugzkilla,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:47:03 2015 UTC,"Ah, I've only played the PC version and that was years ago, though I never did anything crazy in it like that (hell I remember when they first introduced redstone! haha).

PlayStationPlus,3221l1,happyscrappy,1 point,Fri Apr 10 11:57:29 2015 UTC,"PC still has the benefit if you have a decent one (my laptop does as good if not better in some aspects than the PS4) The draw distance, I would say is the biggest thing that PC has an edge on. The graphics are still decent and the game runs smooth without any noticeable hiccups I have seen. I myself find it a bit more comfy sitting back on the couch under a blanket with a controller instead of hunched over a keyboard and mouse. I would say the PS4 holds up fairly well comparing both of them. One other bonus with the PS4 is 4 player split screen without needing any extra PCs and such, just extra controllers."
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,TisAGuy,2,Fri Apr 10 12:15:06 2015 UTC,"It's the backup thing. One PS3 cannot read another's drive. So if your PS3 dies, everything on it is lost. You can't even pop the drive out and put it in another PS3.  So having the backups is useful.  Cross-save does the kind of live syncing you want. Some games have it, most do not."
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,leshadowbanned69,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:48:20 2015 UTC,Rogue Legacy was an excellent use of the cross-save feature. It was cool playing it on my Vita in the subway and have my progress uploaded to my PS4 when I wanted to play it on the big screen.
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,edhere,2,Fri Apr 10 05:49:47 2015 UTC,"Sony is giving it some value by removing features like manually backing up saves unto a PC like you could with the PSP. For the Vita you either need cloud storage or to copy the entire game unto a PS3 (I think a PC can back it up too but I'm not sure) As far as I know, on a Vita you can't chose to delete the game but keep the saves."
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,sweetg,2,Fri Apr 10 18:08:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for me it's basically just a backup because using the saves between devices is so complicated. It's not just the laborious manual upload and download process. It's also having to remember which device you played on last or go check time stamps in two different places in order to figure out which save to use.   Their faq claims that with automatic updates activated, it works the way you want it to but only between a PS3 and a PS4.   The 360 has cloud saves. It seems more intuitive because it saves in just one place. You decide within the game where you want to save, locally or online. The risk is that if your cloud save goes missing, you wouldn't have a local backup (unless you manually created one). This happened to me once early on so I never used it after that."
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,Nawara_Ven,3,Thu Apr 16 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"I keep one PS3 doing automatic backups, my other one (when I play it) I download the game file and upload when finish. It works very well for that purpose for me.   And also the vita. Awesome for that and the limited space."
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,edhere,2,Fri Apr 10 00:14:23 2015 UTC,"How would a 360 cloud save go missing?  Also, it will create a local copy of the file if the save was used in X time period; I've been able to ""recover"" cloud saves when my Internet was out by copying from cloud storage to the 360 HDD. It's not fool-proof, though...."
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,Electroniclog,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:47:36 2015 UTC,I don't know.  How do you copy a save from cloud storage when your internet is out.  Edit: it-->is
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,TheGallifreyan,2,Fri Apr 10 11:45:37 2015 UTC,It's so you can play your save on another PS3/4...unless you carry your saves on a usb.
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,ttech10,2,Fri Apr 10 11:51:28 2015 UTC,"I guess it's useful as a backup.    Yeah, my hard drive has crashed a few times. I love cloud saving.   Also what happens if I ever discontinue psplus? I have to manually download all the game saves?   No, it copies your save to the cloud, leaving your local file there. Btw, it does this during the automatic update time that you set."
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,Psychozoa,2,Fri Apr 10 02:38:49 2015 UTC,"It's point is for backups. It's true you can also download the save from the cloud on another PS3 instead of using a USB stick, but that's just an added benefit."

Recently I got another PS3 and a few days later swapped out the hard drive, all I did was connect back to PS+ and I was able to get my game saves back worry free because I set my system prior to that to sync up everything daily at 6AM :)"
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,AnthonyMimming,2,Fri Apr 10 03:50:05 2015 UTC,Anyone know if you can delete them all at once because I keep getting errors that stuff can't save there because I'm out of space but you can only delete one game at a time.
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,StrikerJaken,2,Fri Apr 10 04:29:27 2015 UTC,"I actually originally got psn+ for the online saves because i was moving countries. I could then download the saves on a new ps3 and continue. But all the free games kept me on board, so i was lucky enough to be someone who has a large majority of all free games ever released on ps+. It was  fantastic when they added all the fallout 3 dlc for free too, as i was playing it at the time  Basically i got ps+ for the online storage, and stayed for the games"
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,StarfighterProx,2,Fri Apr 10 06:15:52 2015 UTC,"Only a backup like others said.  Still would love a sync option. Right now my main PS3 is at my parents, as I am moving at the moment, while I play on my GFs. It would certainly be a great improvement to the system."

PlayStationPlus,3221l1,Ayyylien,2,Fri Apr 10 11:01:09 2015 UTC,A couple of benefits... if something tragic happens to your ps3 you still have your game saves when you replace it.  It saves a little memory as well... though I do wish that I could cross save between my PS3 and my roommate's PS3.  Luckily you can use a USB drive to do that but it is a little bit of a hassle.
PlayStationPlus,3221l1,yojimbo12,2,Fri Apr 10 18:48:07 2015 UTC,"It's good because it pretty much saves your checkpoints... Let's say you're playing some game where you need to experience three different endings for a trophy but has no chapter select, you could just upload the save file before finishing it, finish it, redownload the previous file, finish again, and so on. It can be of great use sometimes.  Or let's say your HDD dies and you've spent tons of hours on a game and bam all your stuff gets deleted! guess what? it's in the cloud. Just redownload it."

Tower of guns is basically a hold trigger strafe shooter with a very unapealing environment. I played it for half an hour, beat a couple of bosses but at one point i just couldn't take it anymore. There was no substance, nothing holding you on to play a little bit more.   Aarus Awakening is artistically beautiful, but gameplay wise? rage indusing. And Never Alone is ""meh"" at best in my opinion. Overall a very weak selection of games for the ps4. I hope that in April we get a much stronger selection of games for the playstation 4."

The arrow is pointing down and I keep dashing up, I hold the stick down and it dashes up, I tap the right stick down right before hitting L1 the second time and it still dashes straight up.  Really doubt anything is wrong with my controller since the arrow on the screen immediately goes down and it works fine when I point it to either side.  I'll try again tomorrow with my other controller."

PlayStationPlus,31v19t,mesenkomaha,12,Wed Apr 8 18:29:30 2015 UTC,That is a perfect description of the game.  It really does feel like something from the late 90s kind of thrown together on a shareware bundle cd.  It is total junk and won't be taking up space on my PS4.

PlayStationPlus,31v19t,RossFixxed,9,Tue Apr 14 20:22:20 2015 UTC,"Never Alone is presented beautifully. The characters are full of life, and quite endearing. However, the constant bugs, the fox committing suicide every two platforms etc have rendered it very frustrating. I have had to restart it twice and eventually gave up. It's an awful pity to see such potential held back by bad code.   Tower of guns. I used to love Quake and all the similar old school shooters. I'm not the biggest rogue-like fan in the world, but an FPS would be the way to get me hooked. It's a pity it's so bland, boring, stuttering and generally unengaging. The guns are weak feeling, the movement is too floaty and the frame rate is dreadful."
PlayStationPlus,31v19t,mesenkomaha,31,Wed Apr 8 21:33:20 2015 UTC,Tower of Guns is easily top 3 worst games I've ever played.  Bullet hell and 3D FPS doesn't work when enemies spawn and shoot from 360 degrees and you can only see in front of you.  Level design is lame and controls feel clunky.  I'd sooner install Extreme Paintbrawl than play Tower of Guns again.

I mean, it starts and everything  like any other PS4 title but playing it on the Vita you cannot shoot. R1 just doesn't do anything. Neither do the front or rear touchpads (to where R2 sometimes gets assigned to).  So you can't even get out of the very first room! :/"
PlayStationPlus,31v19t,Bisquiteen-Trisket,3,Fri Apr 10 14:31:47 2015 UTC,I tried it last night and thought there was something wrong with my vita!  I even swapped the buttons to make R2/L2 map to R1/L1.  L1 seemed to work to let me jump but I couldn't shoot.

Both on the Vita and also on the PS4 but both doesn't carry over to Remote Play :/  What I finally found out, though:  If a developer doesn't implement otherwise, the default mapping of R2 is the upper right corner of the front touch screen.  Yeah.. try playing the game like that :P"
PlayStationPlus,31v19t,jeaceasar,6,Tue Apr 14 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"Never Alone  I finished Never Alone today. It took three short sessions, but it can easily be finished in one sitting. The game has some technical problems. Characters would sometimes get stuck on objects, the AI does some stupid stuff and some characters clip through objects. The platforming and puzzles were okay, but some parts didn't work well.   I did however enjoy the story. The characters were fun although a bit shallow. The setting was interesting too and I learned new stuff through the ""cultural insights"" (short documentaries about Inupiat culture).   I would not recommend this game to most gamers, but if you're a history nut (like me) you'll probably get 2-3 hours of enjoyment out of it."

PlayStationPlus,31v19t,Wubmeister,2,Thu Apr 9 07:25:00 2015 UTC,7.5gb? I'm downloading KZ: Mercenary and the game is 3gb and the patch is like 500mb.

The 500mb one is only the initial update I believe.  The patch will start to download after the main game installs I think  EDIT : I misread, but it's still 4.6gb total.   Note: Due to the size of the full game and patch, users who purchase the digital version of the game will need 4.6GB of free space on their PS Vita memory card"
PlayStationPlus,31v19t,Wubmeister,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:50:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 4.6gb total sounds about right. Bad for anyone that doesn't have at least 8gb.  I personally have a 32gb card so I don't really mind. I would guess that any Vita-owner that has PS+ also has a card bigger than 4gb."

PlayStationPlus,31v19t,Wubmeister,15,Tue Apr 14 21:29:07 2015 UTC,"Tower of Guns is just bad. Really bad. It's a FPS roguelite which is a bad FPS and a bad roguelite.  First off, the graphics are hilariously ugly. It looks like an early PS2 game, with PS1 textures. I played on PS3, though, dunno if it's less ugly in PS4. It looks painfully plain, also. The designs are generic as hell, so it's not just technically bad. The interface reminds me of PS1 shovelware.  Oh but that doesn't matter, right? What matters is how it plays, right? Well it plays like shit, so yeah. For a shooter, the guns feel absolutely awful. There's no kick to them, there's no recoil, there's 0 impact. And this is coming from someone that loves Borderlands, which gets its fair share of complaints about the feeling of its guns. The roguelite aspects are barebones, but that wouldn't matter if at least the shooting were good. But no, it fails as both a shooter and as a roguelite. Level design is bad and bosses are lame, too.  The music is meh. Not awful, not great. It's average. Probably the best part of the game.  I wanted to like Tower of Guns, but it's awful. It feels so much like shovelware.  Oh well, at least the other games this month are good, I hope. Killzone: Mercenary looks great (I played the beta and it was great), Dishonored is good (I already played it when it came out, tho), Aaru's Awakening sounds neat, Never Alone sounds good. Dunno about Monsterbag, but doesn't look particularly bad."
PlayStationPlus,31v19t,PetePete1984,2,Tue Apr 14 21:32:33 2015 UTC,For some reason there are rooms in the levels that are just atrociously huge with cannons all over the place - these actually lag on the PS4 despite looking quite bland. Imagine dodging a plethora of bullets at 10-15 fps.
PlayStationPlus,31v19t,FireworkFuse,10,Wed Apr 8 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"Play tower of guns for about half an hour yesterday. Great game but i was expecting it to be faster paced. It just felt kinda sluggish. But overall good game. In the menu where you select your gun it definitely didn't look like ""hundreds of weapons"" but there seemed to be a good amount."
PlayStationPlus,31v19t,Marmaduk,7,Mon Apr 13 18:14:39 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion apparently, but I liked Tower Of Guns. I played it on PC a few weeks ago and was excited to learn it was coming to PS4. The ""hundreds"" of weapons comes from the amount of modifiers you can pick up for your gun. One second your flying disk launcher shoots homing disks and as soon as you pick up a shiny new modifier, its shooting disks that drop land mines on every surface they bounce off of.   As for pacing, I think its a very fast paced game, and it being a bullet hell is nice, you just have to get used to jumping. A lot. There is a reason that triple jumping is one of the first two unlocked perks.  Overall I'd say its at least worth an hour of your time to form an opinion of your own."
PlayStationPlus,31v19t,LeprosySucks,3,Wed Apr 8 12:53:51 2015 UTC,"I've gotta say, I liked it. But the fact that the last two trophies I needed were (and still are) glitched kinda made me a bit mad. Also, being a roguelike I expected it to be harder, or at least take longer to do literally everything in the game."
PlayStationPlus,31v19t,benengland,5,Wed Apr 8 16:56:22 2015 UTC,"Already had Never Alone from the Christmas sale.  It's really quite a fun little game with some sweet visuals and clever mechanics.  It's good for coop play too - my wife did a lot of running around as the fox, and we really enjoyed it.  The death animations get a bit samey though - particularly when you die repeatedly (on the later ice floes for example) and we were laughing at them by the end.  We watched most of the videos too - well made and interesting."

PlayStationPlus,31v19t,ArthurBelmont,3,Wed Apr 8 17:17:36 2015 UTC,I agree with you. Although I must recognize that my first impression was not that good...  The game gets better with time. Believe. Only when you unlock new guns and perks you'll get the idea. But this game needs a fix ASAP: in some parts the frame rate gets so low that the game becomes slow and unplayable ...
PlayStationPlus,31v19t,drilldrive,1 point,Thu Apr 9 07:02:20 2015 UTC,Yeah the gun that you get on the 50th playthrough makes the game lag so much it is unbearable. How did it get through without anyone noticing that it lags so much? Also I noticed a few spelling errors but the game is pretty fun.
PlayStationPlus,31v19t,ArthurBelmont,2,Thu Apr 9 20:14:19 2015 UTC,"""Also I noticed a few spelling errors""  On my post? Or in the game?   :)    Yeah, i am wondering the same thing: how they released a game with so many  problems? I'm playing on a PS3 and you? I wonder if the PS4 version has the same issues ..."

I had a problem at the end of the first level, when the stats screen shows up and I should press X to continue but nothing happens and I'm only able to restart the game: is anyone experiencing the same issue?"

I think it's a serious issue since this game is a roguelike and taking that much everytime you clear a level is so annoying and definitely a waste of time.

That being said, I'm terrible at Rouge-like games so I doubt this will be a game I'll get really good at.  Gameplay wise, it was..alright at best. I don't normally get motion sick playing games, but I can't imagine playing that game for more than an hour and not getting sick.  Personally, I'm just waiting for Driveclub.

Never alone was a decent little game and I found the vids and story to be interesting but nothing really stood out gameplay wise and it was very short with no replay value. Still easy trophies and I don't regret my time playing it.  Tower of guns is a real mixed bag. I enjoyed playing it in short bursts and seeing how op I can get (got one setup where a chain gun was so powerful firing it would make me fly) but I don't see myself paying it as much as isaac, mostly because the game physically simulates all bullets the frame rate can become unplayable and while I don't mind poor graphics there isn't a lot of variety in the games visuals which is pretty important in this style."

PlayStationPlus,31o50g,ShoutsAtClouds,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:16:56 2015 UTC,Never encountered the save file issue on the PS3 version. Are you sure you weren't just manually saving each time? Everything after creating your initial save file should autosave.
PlayStationPlus,31o50g,wisaaka,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:31:00 2015 UTC,It is a known issue.  I never use manual saves when auto saves are available.  2K Sports never fixed this issue (at least not on PS4).  It resulted in consistent duplicated save files and would fill the entirety of the cloud storage space unless you turned off auto-uploads.  It duplicated after every instance of the game was completed.
PlayStationPlus,31o50g,ShoutsAtClouds,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:55:21 2015 UTC,Yikes. Sorry for the disbelief. PS3 version was fine.
PlayStationPlus,31o50g,wisaaka,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:37:03 2015 UTC,No problem. It was just frustrating. I wasn't aware of the issue until I had to send my system in for repair. It returned and I found out I had lost a couple of months worth of saves because 2K14 filled about 800MB of my cloud save allotment of 1000MB.
PlayStationPlus,31o50g,ShoutsAtClouds,2,Tue Apr 7 00:40:48 2015 UTC,"Your career mode is still playable, and any VC you have gets converted to a single-player only currency (1:1).

PlayStationPlus,31ikam,Heckler456,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:25:01 2015 UTC,I played the whole game except for the final boss fight and if you like anime and RPG's you will probably like ni no kuni. The only main gripe people have with this game is the repetitiveness of it but I didn't mind it too much.

PlayStationPlus,31ikam,mikeet9,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:56:16 2015 UTC,"It's very much like a mix between a movie and a choose your own adventure book with quick time events. That's the best I can explain it. They also often involve you making decisions that greatly influence the story (sometimes life and death) without knowing how things will play out. Not your standard ""Do I save him or help myself"" type karma decisions but more like ""who do I side with?"" or ""which path do I take?"" where outcomes are dependent upon factors that you know but every decision has plusses and minuses, as well as risks and rewards.   The genre is really cool. I just never enjoyed the majority of the ones I've tried because I never watched game of thrones or the walking dead, and I don't care what anybody says, you need the background information to understand the plot. They're designed to be standalone and separate story arcs, but there will still be a lot that you will miss if you aren't familiar with the setting."
PlayStationPlus,31ikam,Beckawk,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:24:18 2015 UTC,"Started playing it and my girlfriend thinks some of the gags are hilarious, she's only ever watched me play parts of Borderlands. So it's not entirely necessary, but it does help with the plot."

PlayStationPlus,31gm23,surrenderthenight,8,Sat Apr 4 23:15:02 2015 UTC,"Lots of people on here suggesting lots of games that weren't on PS+, which is what OP asked.  There's some obvious answers (Fez, Limbo, Killzone coming up, etc) but here's some that are a little easier to overlook:   The Swapper was one of the first games I played when I bought my Vita. Thoroughly enjoyed it. It would be a mistake to overlook it as ""another puzzle platformer"". It's beautiful, has an awesome story (which you shouldn't spoil), and some really tricky sections to it. Excellent game. If you like the Trials games, Joe Danger is a great mobile cross-over between those and something like Skate or SSX. Lone Survivor is polarizing, but it was one of my favourite games I played last year (on PS3). The sound design is fantastic. Scared the hell out of me. Velocity Ultra and 2X are both supposed to be extremely good, but I'm giving my poor fingers a rest after Hotline Miami.  Thomas Was Alone is short and easy, but definitely worth a look. Very charming game. I was hoping it had a separate trophy set on Vita so I could find an excuse to replay it. Pixeljunk Shooter: Ultimate - I'd never played any Pixeljunk games before, but this is a really solid twin stick shooter. Kick & Fennick got solid reviews recently, though I haven't checked it out yet.   Seriously though, if you haven't already played it, Hotline Miami is way too much fun/frustration to miss out on. It was $3 in a sale a few months back, and I feel bad for not having paid more."
PlayStationPlus,31gm23,ShoutsAtClouds,5,Sun Apr 5 09:02:11 2015 UTC,"sure, but the guy just got a vita, it would be a shame not to recommend the hands down best game on the system."

PlayStationPlus,31gm23,ScarletSpider2012,2,Sat Apr 4 23:58:54 2015 UTC,"Binding of Isaac is a great game, but not well implemented on the Vita. It will frequently lock up during the loading screen, requiring a full restart of the Vita. It also frequently suffers from framerate drops, which makes some builds (pretty much anything that shoots a lot of projectiles or has a lot of followers) very difficult to play.  Both of these issues are very sad because the game is extremely fun on other platforms."
PlayStationPlus,31gm23,Fitzsimmons,6,Sun Apr 5 02:25:43 2015 UTC,The Binding of Isaac got an update recently and the frame rate and performance are a lot better!
PlayStationPlus,31gm23,xcubegirl,2,Sun Apr 5 02:55:20 2015 UTC,Really happy to hear this! Maybe they fixed the loading issue too.
PlayStationPlus,31gm23,Fitzsimmons,1 point,Sun Apr 5 03:04:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't experienced it since the update and I used to get it pretty frequently. By the way it doesn't require a full system restart, just a restart of the game."
PlayStationPlus,31gm23,greg225,2,Sun Apr 5 12:33:48 2015 UTC,"I disagree, Vita is my favorite platform for Isaac.   The load problem is real, but only happens sometimes, and restarting a game on the Vita is effortless. Why would you need to reboot the Vita?  Just open the system menu and swipe Isaac closed.   Frame rates are not a big deal though. For one, it takes a crazy amount of stuff on screen to cause a problem - it's pretty rare. For two, the game never ceases being playable. As someone who played the original, back then fighting against a terrible frame rate was half the challenge of the game. Generally speaking, it's a beautiful and smooth experience, even on the Vita."

PlayStationPlus,31gm23,Fishooked,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:31:06 2015 UTC,"Kinda late to the party, but the latest update for Isaac on Vita greatly improved performance and was said to have fixed the loading lock-up (I haven't experienced it since the update, personally).  It's kind of amazing how much the performance improved with that one patch, really.  Now if they could bother patching a certain game to improve its performance on Vita, it would be great. *cough*borderlands2*cough*"
PlayStationPlus,31gm23,Wubmeister,10,Wed Apr 8 17:59:42 2015 UTC,"Rogue legacy and spelunky are great. A lot of people would recommend Binding of Isaac, personally wasn't so keen on it. Terraria is also a lot of fun. All those are great time wasters, you can pick up and play for short bursts or get lost for hours on them. Excellent for truly portable gaming.  If you're more into a console like experience, in a week you'll get Killzone mercenaries (if you're into shooters).  You also should have Dragon crown and Muramasa rebirth, both are amazing, my personal favorites from last year's ps+, (except that I had already bought them before they got on ps+)"

PlayStationPlus,31eqge,Mapleleaf97,12,Sat Apr 4 10:43:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like he's taking mundane concepts from the game and really blowing them out of proportion, making them seem bigger and better than they really are. Like the short game length, he talks about it like its a good thing. Saying, ""this game doesn't want to take up too much of your time."", clearly trying to put the game in this ""friendly"" image. But the truth is, it's 2 hours and also 15 bucks, and it evidently lacks replayability. The puzzle aspects of the game are tiresome to me, especially when h praises it like its this awesome, innovative concept. It's tiresome because it's been done on games like Limbo, Fez, and Valiant Hearts. The only different thing from this game, the only truly unique concept I got from this game, was the Eskimo/snowy theme. I haven't really seen that been done. Also, another thing would be perhaps character switching, but c'mon, The Swapper. The only thing this game has left is a good story, which it may or may not have. We will see, but until then, do not praise this game like its the second coming of Jesus. Same goes for every indie game coming out that is merely ""okay"", and you're just blowing it out of proportion. What bugs me is people throw around words like ""amazing"" and ""addicting"" and ""brilliant"", but have no real claim I back it their praise up."
PlayStationPlus,31eqge,k0mbine,3,Sat Apr 4 14:04:14 2015 UTC,"Agree BUT as a dad with a young son, this game is great. My boy is 3 years old and there aren't many games that he can play. We have to play it together but it's a pretty harmless game which he can control.  The other thing is that the intent was to create other communities around the world using the same platform. Don't know where that lands now, but as I played it, reminded me of Mysterious Cities of Gold, where at the end of every tv episode you got 3-4 minutes of the real culture behind the story in the episode.

""you push boxes around to trick enemies into helping you, and that's JUST as cool!""....  for fuck's sake.  This is a non-challenging game.  It's like Trine, but much simpler.  ...

PlayStationPlus,31c54u,Dogstarz,2,Fri Apr 3 21:40:54 2015 UTC,Well even the last Flash sale was a bust if you were only on ps4
PlayStationPlus,31c54u,dfrazier81,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:54:49 2015 UTC,PS3 reaped the benefits of that flash sale.

PlayStationPlus,31c54u,peterkozmd,7,Fri Apr 3 21:15:39 2015 UTC,boooo hisssss
PlayStationPlus,31c54u,csolisr,6,Fri Apr 3 21:32:16 2015 UTC,Holding out hope as well! Those flash sales have been pretty great lately.

PlayStationPlus,31cdom,C1ank,2,Fri Apr 3 20:33:12 2015 UTC,"Canada doesn't have Powers yet. To the best of my knowledge Sony's just said ""we're working on it"" when asked about the Powers international release date. I wouldn't expect it any time soon"

PlayStationPlus,319ja8,happyscrappy,5,Fri Apr 3 04:04:43 2015 UTC,"This game is more fun than I was anticipating.  Free running games generally aren't that appealing to me, and the same can be said for free mobile games with in-app purchasing. But this game is LBP to the core, and it's makes a huge difference. Great free game, and particularly for LBP fans!"

PlayStationPlus,319ja8,juan15236,3,Fri Apr 3 16:39:39 2015 UTC,it can only be controlled with the touch screen (which sucks by the way)

PlayStationPlus,319ja8,Work_McGurk,3,Fri Apr 3 07:41:04 2015 UTC,"I considered picking one up too, even though I already own a Vita. From what I saw, hardly any games are even compatible with PSTV, so do your research before you buy - otherwise you could be in for a disappointment."
PlayStationPlus,319ja8,takedownchris,1 point,Fri Apr 3 11:28:59 2015 UTC,One of The biggest problem with pstv isn't wireless 5ghz which would make remote play way better

PlayStationPlus,319ja8,ashimonovits,2,Fri Apr 3 19:18:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't get one just for that as most probably doesn't work, however it works very well for me for Remote Playing in my office room"
PlayStationPlus,319ja8,grbolivar,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:51:51 2015 UTC,"PSTV is only worth for playing PSOne classics and PSNow on your TV only if you dont already own a PS3, hardly any Vita game works and the few that do are not worth the investment IMO."
PlayStationPlus,319ja8,MoeyAssi,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:26:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, I was googling this game to see what it is, and not used to my new phone's keyboard- so close to searching 'rub sack boys'... Ima just stick to finding it on psn store..."
PlayStationPlus,319ja8,obievil,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:11:54 2015 UTC,zomg! There's a Vita and Android version! My productivity just went to hell today.
PlayStationPlus,314dpf,Emperor312,13,Wed Apr 1 22:34:34 2015 UTC,Yes
PlayStationPlus,314dpf,shadowgunner200,8,Wed Apr 1 22:53:51 2015 UTC,"Yea, and also, buy anything with a ps+ discount and you can keep it forever, no worries here.  Only the ""free"" monthly games need a subscription to keep running."
PlayStationPlus,314dpf,heisenbergfan,1 point,Thu Apr 2 04:56:38 2015 UTC,"yes, there's no restrictions on the trial."
PlayStationPlus,314dpf,blackhaze9,-31,Thu Apr 2 18:00:39 2015 UTC,"Since nobody is replying with an actual answer, yes, you get the discount, but you can only play games bought with a PS+ discount when you have an active PS+ subscription. So if you don't plan to continue your subscription, your money will be wasted because your game will become unplayable after 14 days. If you subscribe later down the road, your game will become playable again. So I there are three possible scenarios:   You buy the game and never renew subscription: your game is playable for a maximum of 14 days  You buy the game but don't have the money or motivation to subscribe to PS+, but subscribe sometime down the road: your game is playable for up to 14 days, then unplayable until you decide to get a subscription You buy the game and continue a subscription when your 14 day subscription leaves off: you get full game functionality as long as you maintain your subscription"
PlayStationPlus,314dpf,mikeet9,20,Thu Apr 2 03:11:57 2015 UTC,This is absolutely not true. Discounted games can be played with or without ps+. It is only the freebies that are limited to while with subscription.
PlayStationPlus,314dpf,rudaz,9,Thu Apr 2 03:59:50 2015 UTC,I have bought games with a trial membership and they all still 100% work. This is a total lie.

PlayStationPlus,314dpf,xDoze,2,Thu Apr 2 22:56:49 2015 UTC,Apparently so.
PlayStationPlus,314dpf,mikeet9,-13,Fri Apr 3 01:25:52 2015 UTC,There is only one ps+ for all your devices with your psn.
PlayStationPlus,314dpf,Blitzed97,7,Wed Apr 1 23:15:32 2015 UTC,"That wasn't the question, he/she was asking if PS+ Trials activate discounts on digital games."
PlayStationPlus,314dpf,Fyzx,-1,Thu Apr 2 01:02:10 2015 UTC,Ok
PlayStationPlus,314dpf,Blitzed97,-6,Thu Apr 2 11:49:19 2015 UTC,"there is no ""trial"" ps+, putting the code in gives you ps+ for the ""trial"" duration of 1/2/whatever weeks. so if you got plus you get all it's features."
PlayStationPlus,314dpf,Fyzx,3,Thu Apr 2 02:53:10 2015 UTC,"Trial is exactly what I said, I didn't say demo ;)"

PlayStationPlus,314dpf,Fyzx,4,Thu Apr 2 08:18:10 2015 UTC,OP Asked for a question that requires an answer.  Not an answer that needs explaining...
PlayStationPlus,314dpf,Blitzed97,-4,Thu Apr 2 08:57:41 2015 UTC,a long-winded and/or convoluted answer is still an answer...

PlayStationPlus,311ju1,PyroSpark,2,Fri Apr 3 04:15:16 2015 UTC,They never get the prices right on the blog- I've seen x% off a few times and it's less than that- and it's still more than even the overpriced brick and mortar stores
PlayStationPlus,311ju1,Sicmay,3,Wed Apr 1 11:28:14 2015 UTC,"To be fair to him, that one was my fault. Since it was a few hours before the blog post i was calculating the percentages then allowing for variances since I use neither GBP or EUR and there are differences in the level of discount between currencies.  My bad."
PlayStationPlus,311ju1,Sicmay,2,Wed Apr 1 13:42:58 2015 UTC,"No I mean on the blog itself, I keep noticing errors in their calculations, and inconsistencies in their pricing"
PlayStationPlus,311ju1,Lozsta,7,Wed Apr 1 13:54:51 2015 UTC,"So for a non existent, leased, non physical item the sale price is still £10 more expensive than the item on a Bluray in a box."

PlayStationPlus,311ju1,Lozsta,2,Thu Apr 2 14:14:33 2015 UTC,"Still bloody stupid to pay more for something downloadable, rather than a game in a box.  I will always prefer to pay less for the same thing."
PlayStationPlus,311ju1,monkeymonger1,3,Fri Apr 3 01:09:34 2015 UTC,"Is it?  I like having a large collection that can be selected from the ps3/ps4 library. Keeps them organised, takes no space, and can be easily transported.   If you rely on selling games then it is a no brainer, but if you don't then there isn't that much difference between the two. The extra cost to me is worth it."
PlayStationPlus,311ju1,Lozsta,1 point,Fri Apr 3 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"No, I don't rely on selling games.  Never have never will.  I really do not get why they insist on charging so much more.  If you are in the US then this argument is moot as in the EU the price difference is huge."

PlayStationPlus,311ju1,Ad__Hominem,-2,Sat Apr 4 16:39:18 2015 UTC,"On a purely economic level, it makes sense for the digital version to cost more.  Although the physical copy has a higher up-front investment cost, economy of scale means that each subsequent physical copy is cheaper than the last, relatively speaking. It may cost me $5 to ship a PS4 game cross-country, but if I fill up a big rig with them, I've shrank the cost to pennies per copy.  With the digital edition, there's a certain degree of ongoing burden. As long as they keep the game available for download, they're losing money with each GB downloaded. If you buy my cd, I pay to get it to you once. If you buy the digital edition, I pay to get it to you every single time you download it. For the more data-heavy users, that can be hundreds of gigs per month."

Not sure if that's a good or a bad thing but it is funny that these games are being played on our 400 dollar next gen consoles.  Edit.  Just played it.  It is terrible and feel bad for anyone who paid money for this game.  Yikes.
PlayStationPlus,310bcp,rainmcmanis,3,Wed Apr 1 15:53:16 2015 UTC,"What's so terrible about it?  It's an extremely simple game that has great mechanics.  Put an hour into it on my vita, got a few trophies, enjoyed it for what it is, and moved on.  Would I have paid much for it? No, but it's certainly better than a lot of the craptastic $0.99 iOS or Android games out there.  PROTIP: Enter initials POO for a free trophy. ;-)"

PlayStationPlus,310bcp,rainmcmanis,2,Wed Apr 1 17:24:05 2015 UTC,Yeah... I like the game but have no desire to revisit it on PS4.
PlayStationPlus,310bcp,oakleez,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:24:42 2015 UTC,"I used to play this daily for about half an hour each time, gets really good when you unlock the harder mode. the easy mode is way too easy but is pretty much there for you to get used to the mechnaics and start figuring out tactics for yourself, and then when you start getting far in the harder mode, it gets really difficult and that, for me is when the fun kicks in and i love it, requires very fast twitch reactions at that point."

PlayStationPlus,30xooh,internetknowsall,9,Tue Mar 31 22:19:11 2015 UTC,"This generation isn't really a ""switch"" or ""upgrade"", as marketing keeps insisting. The PS3 and PS4 share very little (the 360 and One even less so); unless money or space is a factor, it seems illogical to be rid of the former console in lieu of the latter."
PlayStationPlus,30xooh,Nawara_Ven,3,Tue Mar 31 20:17:56 2015 UTC,More of a space/port thing.  Have a PS3 and a WiiU on a not super new TV with no HDMI ports left and don't really want to move either out of the living room and the 50 inch plasma TV or hook up the PS4 in the bedroom.  So if I want to keep them all hooked up then I would need to get a new TV and then we are looking at ~$12-1500 for the PS4 and TV of comparable size and quality.  I know I could swap them out but we know what happens once it id disconnected it takes something seriously amazing to make you bother to hook it all up again.  So basically nothing on PS4 has forced me to switch yet or be so great I want to shell out over $1000 to get it all working.

PlayStationPlus,30xooh,Rickyd96,11,Tue Mar 31 17:43:53 2015 UTC,"While I don't necessarily have a problem with indie games in theory, if that is all they are ever going to offer on PS4, they might as well not even have IGC on there. It's okay to have them on there from time to time, but not every freaking month (or at least seems like it's every month)."
PlayStationPlus,30xooh,tbx5959,5,Wed Apr 1 02:05:45 2015 UTC,Nothing exiting for me tbh.  Dishonored is a hell of a game thought. You guys enjoy it.

PlayStationPlus,30xooh,gta-man,3,Tue Mar 31 16:08:23 2015 UTC,I wonder if they put it on ps+ just to get people to buy bigger cards.

PlayStationPlus,30xooh,ShannyBoy,4,Tue Mar 31 15:40:45 2015 UTC,The amount of crappy games released each month for PS4 is strongly correlated with number of games they give PS+ users.
PlayStationPlus,30xooh,asportking,2,Tue Mar 31 15:45:03 2015 UTC,"Meh. Dishonored is good, but I already own it and all the DLC. The other PS3 game is a rage inducing platformer,(from what I can tell). But it's pretty. Still haven't seen a reason to get a PS4, so those games are not important to me, yet. I'll ""purchase"" them via the webstore, just in case I ever get a PS4. Same with the Vita."
PlayStationPlus,30xooh,Doomburrito,2,Tue Mar 31 20:51:13 2015 UTC,Thanks god a AAA game for the Vita!

I'm not sure how the PS3/PS4 port is (I've only played with a KB/M, can't vouch for how a gamepad feels), but it's got tons of replayability value, lots of options with weapons and powerups, and does a great job at randomly generating levels."

If only dishonoured and tower of guns was available as cross buy. Tower of guns seems a bit rage inducing and very hard, but worth a shot. The other two games just aren't my type."
PlayStationPlus,30xooh,thrillxseeker,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:26:48 2015 UTC,"Tower of guns says ""PS3, PS4"" next to it, so it's probably cross-buy"

PlayStationPlus,30xooh,Streetfoldsfive,3,Wed Apr 1 06:12:12 2015 UTC,"I'm just sick of getting at least 3 indie side scroller platforming games per month. I have SOOOO many that I don't even care for that type of game anymore. Indie games are fine, but stop giving me so fucking many of the same type."
PlayStationPlus,30xooh,SuperUnknown78,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"But there are 3 FPSs as well. I'm biased because I still love these indie platformers, but when I saw this line up, I thought it would appeal to people who complain about to many indie platformers. I guess not.  What type of games are you hoping for?"
PlayStationPlus,30xooh,SpoomMcKay,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:30:22 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm really happy about Killzone. I would have been happy about Dishonored, but I've beaten it twice. Still a good game though and happy to see it on there. Tower of Guns looks like pure shit.  oh and just because I don't want indie sidescrollers and platformers doesn't mean I just want FPS games! No seriously though, almost any type of game is fine for the most part. I'd love some more triple A, but I'm absolutely fine with indie games as well. I'm just tired of this ONE TYPE of indie game that seems to be a requirement each month. We always get at least one sidescrolling platformer on ps4, and one for the other consoles as well. Sometimes we get THREE side scrolling platformers for ps4 in one month. It's fucking crazy.  I'm not saying those are bad games, I'm just saying that'd I'd LOVE for sony to get 2-3 months without putting ANY sidescrolling platformers on there. This includes non indie ones as well, such as Rayman. I know, it's a great game, but fuck sidescrolling platformers at this point in time. Ps+ ruined that game genre for me by overloading me with WAY too many of them in a very short amount of time."
PlayStationPlus,30xooh,bmacorr,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:45:31 2015 UTC,"Some games I haven't really seen, but upon investigation they look awesome. Super excited for this month for PS4 and Vita. Never alone looks beautiful."

PlayStationPlus,30xooh,Bangcrashboom,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:42:09 2015 UTC,Tower of Guns actually looks pretty cool. I like indies but since I only own a ps4 it makes me jealous seeing PS3 and vita getting treated so well.
PlayStationPlus,30xooh,qwertyytrewq99,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:47:12 2015 UTC,Never Alone actually looks like a really interesting indie game.  I'm super happy this was in the lineup.  Tower of Guns seems interesting.  Can't really say until I try it though.

PlayStationPlus,30xooh,letsgometros,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:17:42 2015 UTC,Agreed. Tower of Guns sounds and looks like pure shit.
PlayStationPlus,30xooh,concept8,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:24:17 2015 UTC,Well I guess I'll ruin the vibe and say I'm excited. Tower of Guns looks like something that I'll play for a bit and the other two PS4 games look decent enough. Killzone is a good get when I traded my Vita for a PSTV.

PlayStationPlus,30zo1d,Roondak,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:24:46 2015 UTC,Yeah a flash sale this week seems likely.
PlayStationPlus,30zo1d,JT-Lionheart,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:56:02 2015 UTC,Maybe because we got that Spring fever thing going on. I don't think that's happening anywhere else.

PlayStationPlus,30xxem,hambeastkd,-2,Tue Mar 31 16:44:41 2015 UTC,Rayman Legends is about 15€ at shop.. get it while you can. For me Never Alone itself is more than enough for me
PlayStationPlus,30xxem,Qraparta,7,Tue Mar 31 19:08:29 2015 UTC,"It's cheap now, but games use to show up on PS+ when they were hitting the $20-$30 price point. We are finally at the point in the PS4's lifecycle. Any time now we will likely be getting AAA games more months then not.  Publishers want to hurt the used market too."
PlayStationPlus,30xxem,Tyler2Tall,-1,Tue Mar 31 19:24:10 2015 UTC,"the big question is, what AAA games does the ps4 have they can give away? not a diss against ps4, but people want the AAA games ps3 had (years after it's launch there were plenty to choose from), what does the ps4 had in the last few 2 years and more importantly people don't have yet? knack? killzone?   Publishers want to hurt the used market too.   publishers want you to buy the newest shiny title in the ultra super duper deluxe edition for $70+, not play the previous title. don't forget sony has to pay for those games to show up on ps+. if they want too much...  I don't mind the indie games, and wouldn't mind some big ps4 games (maybe it would finally be a reason to pick up a ps4), but imagine how people will react when sony finally puts some launch games on ps+.."
PlayStationPlus,30xxem,Fyzx,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:51:33 2015 UTC,"Theres a handful, i don't think it matters if most people have it, since it at least sets a precedent that we will be getting AAA games regularly.  Also for PS4, it wasn't uncommon for them to release games that were right around a year old. I also wouldn't be surprised if EA Access get announced during E3 for PS4.  Off the top of my head games that could be released are:  Very Likely: Knack Killzone Lego: Marvel Thief Metal Gear Ground Zeroes Infamous Assassins Creed 4 Driveclub (full version)  Semi-likely: Wolvenstein Saints Row IV Little Big Planet 3 (Has dropped in price a ton already) Tomb Raider Last of Us Watchdogs Battlefield 4  The very likely games are all games that could be released already and not be much of a surprise, and there's enough there to last a year while even more games get old."
PlayStationPlus,30xxem,Tyler2Tall,-1,Thu Apr 2 03:07:13 2015 UTC,"you mean the HD re-releases because sony (and ms) are out of AAA games? not saying there aren't any AAA games, but a lot you listed are multiplats...  EA access would even devalue ps+ more, since EA ofc has no interest making them available outside access (or wants such an amount of money sony simply deems it not worth it). ubisoft was on plus before, we should see black flag (or more likely watch_dogs) ""soonish"". sony games will definitely be on plus at some point since it doesn't cost sony anything, but like I said most people already have/had those games.  it comes down to money, how many publishers want to have their games on plus and how many sony is willing to spend."
PlayStationPlus,30xxem,Fyzx,2,Thu Apr 2 08:26:30 2015 UTC,3 weeks ago i picked up kz: m for $8 used and was ahppy about that.... I didnt see it going free since it is one of the few high quality VITA games... and the best FPS on vita... but i'm going to stick with the cart because I dont have 4 gig to spare on my card

Dishonored I already have on Xbox thanks to games for Gold so unlikely to even download that one.  Aaru's Awakening looks nice but its also in danger of being irritating if the controls are not pinpoint. I cant see myself touching Killzone given im not usually a FPS fan and Monsterbag looks interesting, but confusing."

PlayStationPlus,30xxem,mattiejj,3,Tue Mar 31 21:49:04 2015 UTC,"Then yeah, unfortunately IMO Playstation Plus only really becomes completely worth it if you own more than one console."
PlayStationPlus,30xxem,pythagean,3,Tue Mar 31 22:00:59 2015 UTC,"For sometime it was well worth it if you were a casual with only PS3.

They're quite happy with it."
PlayStationPlus,30xxem,spotter,1 point,Wed Apr 1 09:46:11 2015 UTC,I did this I download the vita titles for about a year and when I got my vita it was amazing having about 20 quality games to play.

PlayStationPlus,30xxem,mattiejj,-1,Tue Mar 31 22:04:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get it, I don't have a new generate console yet (got a PS Vita and PS3). Most of my gaming is either on PC or Vita at the moment.  There really hasn't been too many big console-exclusive games which have made me consider buying a PS4. I'll wait until after E3, but there just doesn't seem to be any huge incentive to buy a console over a PC (especially compared to last generation)"

PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,Simsams,10,Tue Mar 31 16:06:34 2015 UTC,Killzone is a good offering on Vita but still disappointed with this month. Getting sick of not getting anything substantial on PS4. Games like valiant hearts and counterspy have been great finds that are perfect for PS+ but they need to be supported by a solid recognised offering.
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,FXHNT_Steve,10,Sat Apr 4 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, Woah Dave! is available free for PS+ right now, I just grabbed it."

PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,Greyfeld,3,Wed Apr 1 01:29:01 2015 UTC,I think I might have got this as part of the Vita bundle I bought. I haven't played it but I've seen several people say how good it is that I might do now.

Same with Never Alone."
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,nonegenuine,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:46:24 2015 UTC,Dishonored is an amazing game. I loved the freedom and how the game would bite back if you got lazy so you always felt on your toes but still felt super powerful at the same time. Also there were so many ways to go at each level. Fantastic experience.
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,Juuichidaime,11,Wed Apr 8 06:35:38 2015 UTC,"On PS4, I'm generally really excited about a lineup heavy on indies, but this is pretty weak any way you slice it.."

PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,pir8pat,8,Sat Apr 4 13:44:00 2015 UTC,"Are people not actually looking at Tower of Guns or something? I keep hearing everyone complain about ""shitty side scrolling indies"" but there's also a pretty cool looking shooter. I'm starting to think that people will instantly dismiss a game if they haven't heard of it (because if they haven't heard of it then it's not worth playing, or something). I had never heard of it before today but I'm really intrigued, looks like it could be fun. It's fully 3D, graphics are okay (looks kind of like a lower budget Borderlands) and it seems pretty fast paced."
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,lightningsword,7,Wed Apr 1 00:08:32 2015 UTC,"https://youtu.be/MyXcr6sDRtw this video by game theorist will tell you why no one plays games they haven't heard of, I find it pretty interesting and hopefully you will too."
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,greg225,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:06:05 2015 UTC,Isn't it tragic that on PS4 we have to defend a game by pointing out that it's 'fully 3d' and the graphics are 'okay'. You would think that by this stage those things would be a fucking given.
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,difixx,9,Wed Apr 1 19:28:28 2015 UTC,"You would think that by this stage those things would be a fucking given.    Why should it? Does every game have to have top of the line graphics for it to matter? Just because the console is capable of games that look like The Order doesn't mean every game needs to be like that, or even CAN. A lot of indie developers choose to go 2D because it's cheaper for them, because of technical reasons (i.e. not having to make a fully 3D camera) or because it's their artistic vision, sometimes all three. I'm tired of this mentality that 2D games are bad and 3D games are good by default. There are a lot of great and shitty games on both sides. Hell I personally think Rayman Legends and Guacamelee are among the best games available on current platforms. Most of the games we've got are pretty good, but people don't even want to try them. Every month I see people saying they deleted a game after five minutes. And I say all this as someone without a hint of nostalgia for side scrollers, my first game was Crash Bandicoot.  Every month people beg for something that isn't a 2D sidescroller and when we get it, people still shit on it. It's a shooter and it's 3D. Because it's a roguelike? Don't see what's wrong with that. Because it's indie? What's that got to do with anything? Because it doesn't have photorealistic graphics that pump every ounce of power out of the machine? Shame the game was almost entirely made by one guy..."
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,greg225,-3,Wed Apr 1 20:16:03 2015 UTC,"because people want an AAA title.  when two years ago I did a 3 months subscription for PS3 I was amazed. for 15€ I got Hitman, XCom: Enemy Unknow, Little Big Planet 2, Dead or Alive 4 and a lot of other cool titles.  I was so happy about it and when PS4 comes out I immediately signed for an year.  Not only for the first year basically every big game I played was a game I could play even on PS3 (Assassin's Creed 4, Fifa 14/15, Dragon Age: Inquisition) but everything I got from IGC are indie or low budget games, with the only exception of that DC beat 'em up (shitty game) and the infamous DLC (a DLC, not a game). I mean, I appreciate many of the Plus games, but when I signed for PSPlus I was looking for something different.  Meanwhile PS3 users get Thief, while PS4 users don't."
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,difixx,6,Thu Apr 2 09:17:15 2015 UTC,So what were you looking for? One of those big budget titles you bought a PS4 to play? Were you expecting them to give you the biggest selling games from a small library? People need to realise that it was like this for the PS3 during the first two years of that console's life too. Mostly Indies and PS1 classics. I think it wasn't until late 2008 that the PS3 got its first major Plus game. When they started giving away games like Hitman the IGC was already like 5 years old for that system. The console had a huge library and it was more likely a big game would be passed on than it is now. If people are so interested in certain games I don't understand why they don't just buy them instead of Hong they'll be free and complaining when they aren't.
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,greg225,-6,Thu Apr 2 12:27:45 2015 UTC,"I was looking for AAA titles. I understand your point and it makes sense. The library is small and they can't give away 2 big games per month like they do for PS3. But... something? I can wait and I'm going to sign for another year when my plus end, also because I like indie games too, but I totally understand the disappointment because when every month I look what is available, I'm disappointed too"
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,lightningsword,2,Thu Apr 2 12:36:19 2015 UTC,"Tge problem is people are expecting things that just aren't realistic. Acting like they deserve these games for some reason. Instead of saying ""Oh boy, I hope we finally get Killzone this month!"" every time they should be more open minded and see the game as a chance to try something they've not heard of or might not have played otherwise. I've discovered many of my favourite games this way."
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,greg225,-7,Thu Apr 2 12:41:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, sorry for rattling your cage there guy. Obviously I understand good stuff can not be 3D etc. I was trying to point out how ridiculous it is that people are so desperate for anything other than 2d side scrollers, that a big deal is being made that this game is 'fully' 3D. If someone travelled back in time to explain this absurd situation to me back when I was playing PS2 I would have told them to fuck off, you must be mad if you think that on PS4 3D games will be a rarity (obviously I know all mainstream games are, but this is in regards to is plus titles)."
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,enclavesoldier,2,Wed Apr 1 21:21:01 2015 UTC,"you must be mad if you think that on PS4 3D games will be a rarity   I'm not. But it seems like an awful lot of people are. I'm perfectly happy with what we have but with the complaints I see all the time you'd think it was 50 2D indies for every AAA game.  I wasn't really directing my comment towards you necessarily, by the way."
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,greg225,1 point,Wed Apr 1 22:10:38 2015 UTC,"I agree that Indies can be fantastic. In fact, I prefer most Indie titles to AAA games. However, AAA games cost more money and more people play them so they are more appreciated when given fro free. Ps3 plus users have, and still do, received many quality third party titles for free. That's why people are mad.   P.S. Yes, Tower of Guns is great!"
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,enclavesoldier,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:06:43 2015 UTC,"Ps3 plus users have, and still do, received many quality third party titles for free   Because the console is nearly 8 years old and has a massive library probably approaching 1,000 titles if not more. There's so much they can choose from, but you have to remember that the first two years of PS+ on the PS3 was mostly indies and PS1 Classics. No big games until around mid to late 2008."
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,greg225,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:19:37 2015 UTC,"True, and again, I personally like the overall path ps+ is on right now, but most people who are upset can probably attribute that to the Sony's promised DriveClub exclusive and the Injustice give away. They gave one AAA game and promised another, though that kind of fell through if I'm remembering right. It's also important to note that many of the big third party games available on the PS4 are rereleases of older titles."

PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,greg225,-5,Mon Apr 6 19:26:20 2015 UTC,It's a shitty roguelike. That is also not a underrepresented genre on psplus.
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,mattiejj,0,Wed Apr 1 08:02:59 2015 UTC,Roguelikes are not shitty. Roguelikes are great. And they aren't all the same as well. Is it because they require an attention span of more than two minutes or something?
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,greg225,4,Wed Apr 1 08:45:25 2015 UTC,"Funny that you say that, because according to the reviews :    The game is intended to be completed within one to two hours, and has been described as a ""lunch-break experience.   one to two hours? I don't know if my attention span is that long.."
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,Mrdaimion,4,Wed Apr 1 08:52:35 2015 UTC,"Most roguelikes though are designed to be replayed over and over, because it's different every time. That's what makes them roguelikes."
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,Makalol,6,Wed Apr 1 09:00:16 2015 UTC,"Have you never played a Roguelike or something? Rogue Legacy, for example, was on January IGC and it was a great game, and even though it could be beaten in about 20 minutes, most people take 20 hours to beat it instead, because roguelikes are designed to be able to beaten really quickly if you're good enough but they're also really hard at first so you won't be able to beat it for a while."

PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,alatar_,8,Thu Apr 2 02:44:30 2015 UTC,"This month is mixed for me.  Killzone was on my rental list so I get it early and tower was a game I almost bought back on a steam sale. Dishonored was great but I already beat it several times on 360. The rest seem very cheap but I'll still play them in case of hidden gems. Also don't know why the hate for plus.  Do people really expect big games?  Most of them are now owned by ea, ubi, and 2k and probably cost a mint to get on plus.  There are 6 games on offer and two triple a this month.  I guess getting those is what broke the budget so the rest are tiny teams or student developed. Anyway by the time a big triple a is up for plus you've probably already played or rented it if you were interested and the mp is probably dead.  Isn't it better to get a good mix of lesser known but high quality games you may have missed than one or two big games you already played and some scraps? At 5 dollars a month even if you get 1 game you like in 4 months your breaking even, so why not try and find a hidden gem, never know when a game will surprise you regardless of genre, style,  or budget. All your risking is a few hours of your life, no different from trying a over hyped game day 1 you may not like (bf, watch dogs,  destiny)."

PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,Fuegofucker,4,Thu Apr 2 14:54:59 2015 UTC,"you could say the same sentence and replace ""online gaming"" with ""psplus"" and it would still be true.  In my mind, the losses of psplus from people who ""are sick of the indie crap"" are made up by people who now are buying psplus that didn't before for online gaming.  I mean of course i could be completely and utterly off the mark, but hey, there's no way to no for sure without sony telling us."
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,uberwaffle,-7,Mon Apr 6 03:38:11 2015 UTC,This Isn Xbox where everyone is playing online. We actually have good single player games. Ps plus is not necessary at all.

PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,Greyfeld,1 point,Wed Apr 1 07:04:12 2015 UTC,"It was actually made in conjunction with the Inupiat, an Alaskan Native American tribe. From their site:    Nearly 40 Alaska Native elders, storytellers and community members contributed to the development of the game.   I believe the development was partly sponsored by the tribe's PR people. It's got a lot of their stories and legends woven into the game, which I think will be fascinating. Better than watching the History channel, I'd say."
PlayStationPlus,30xt4w,DrunkeNinja,-2,Mon Apr 6 23:46:52 2015 UTC,"I dunno, the visuals look good and the story might be interesting, but it just looks like every other sidescroller puzzle/platformer to come out in the last few years.  I mean, at least Swapper had an interesting game mechanic."

PlayStationPlus,30xowb,TweetPoster,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:35:55 2015 UTC,I will be purchasing this day one. I want to give the developers money because I only heard of it when they gave rebirth away for free. I feel dirty getting to sink hours into a awesome game and had paid nothing to the people who worked hard on it.
PlayStationPlus,30xowb,TopSuperRoll,1 point,Thu Apr 2 15:07:10 2015 UTC,"Don't feel dirty, they made plenty of money before it went on PS+ and they get a lot of money just for appearing on the IGC.  The money they received from Sony might have enabled them to make this sequel, you pay for the ability to rent games, don't feel bad for it."

PlayStationPlus,30vcl4,cenorexia,4,Tue Mar 31 07:33:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's going to be free unless they received the Vita game during January. It's a cross-buy game, so just like how Vita owners got Don't Starve for free if they received the PS4 version months earlier, PS4 users will get Woah Dave! if they had the Vita version from January."
PlayStationPlus,30vcl4,ZebraMuffin,6,Tue Mar 31 09:01:00 2015 UTC,"Well, in the Blogcast that's been linked in the article (it's around 11:05 into the show) they just plain say that the PS4 version will be free, whether you already got it for the Vita or not :)"

PlayStationPlus,30vcl4,FXHNT_Steve,14,Tue Mar 31 19:26:09 2015 UTC,"Here for the anti-indie comment. I wouldn't mind them as much if more effort was put in to them. I saw a comment once where someone said he waited his whole childhood for games to evolve beyond Atari style and things like the NES or SNES were ground breaking for him, now everyone wants to make and play 8-bit games. Retro revival isn't bad if it's done right but they don't have a fan in me with stuff like Woah Dave. Oh well, at least it's an extra free game.  Edit: Called it 8-bit but it's more Atari style. Though I could make an argument for 8-bit too although a bit more work and consideration seem to go in to those, regardless."
PlayStationPlus,30vcl4,IdolizedByZeroes,2,Tue Mar 31 01:32:11 2015 UTC,"8-bit too although a bit more   I don't think there's such a thing as 9-bit games.  Don't worry, I'll show myself to the door."
PlayStationPlus,30vcl4,killit,1 point,Tue Mar 31 11:56:25 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad mentality, but besides art style I believe a lot of indies are way beyond what was done on those systems. Hotline Miami, Fez, Guacamele, and a lot of other games may wear the classic cloths but they bring great ideas to the table in lot of cases (my opinion at least). I guess I just see more fresh ideas from this scene when compared to the AAA. Either way everyone has a preference, I just wish it wasn't always so toxic."
PlayStationPlus,30vcl4,Streetfoldsfive,1 point,Tue Mar 31 12:24:06 2015 UTC,"Sure, fresh ideas are okay. Hotline miami is succesful because it's hard and has a great soundtrack, also Valiant Hearts and Ori and the Blind Forest are amazing, even though they are platformers.   but it's not fresh if you'll get 3 months of indie-titles. I play a lot of indies on steam and I just want something cool to play on my TV. Things like OlliOlli 2 were not refreshing at all and I can't understand the amount of hype that game had."
PlayStationPlus,30vcl4,mattiejj,2,Tue Mar 31 12:51:09 2015 UTC,"I guess its just preference. I loved sitting back and playing olliolli2 on my TV. Thought it was an excellent, deep, and fun game. With an awesome soundtrack and lits to do."
PlayStationPlus,30vcl4,Streetfoldsfive,-3,Tue Mar 31 13:25:33 2015 UTC,"OlliOlli 2   Maybe because it was one of the free vita games  Man you ""indie platforming trash"" guys are getting desperate. You now have resorted to complaining that the PS Vita games that are cross-buy aren't taking advantage of your PS4. Like how deluded can you be."

PlayStationPlus,30u2al,FXHNT_Steve,23,Mon Mar 30 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"Dishonored for PS3, obviously, and then I'd assume they'd want to do something kinda big to compete with Games With Gold's double offering, so maybe Tomb Raider for PS4? It's not gonna be anything mind-blowing. Maybe, maybe Second Son."
PlayStationPlus,30u2al,SpoomMcKay,14,Mon Mar 30 18:46:12 2015 UTC,"Highly doubt Second son as they just gave out the DLC for free a couple months ago. It will probably be something like Killzone or Wolfenstein, hopefully Wolfenstein because I hear that game was really good and I've already played shadowfall and it's very meh."
PlayStationPlus,30u2al,Selykg,11,Mon Mar 30 20:50:51 2015 UTC,I can't see Wolfenstein happening.
PlayStationPlus,30u2al,2555555555,7,Mon Mar 30 23:08:28 2015 UTC,The only reason I could see Wolfenstein on IGC would be to get more sales for the upcoming DLC Wolfenstein: The Old Blood.
PlayStationPlus,30u2al,Selykg,2,Mon Mar 30 23:26:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a valid enough reason for it to go free.   The Old Blood is standalone. It doesn't require the full game to play it. It's also only $20, so it's not like this is a super big release. If it were a true sequel I could maybe see it. The dlc got a lot of people talking as is, it doesn't really need advertising as word of mouth is working super well.   Technically the Old Blood is a sort of prequel. I have no clue if they can be played out of order, but if they can then I'd say they might be trying to use the DLC to sell more of the full game."
PlayStationPlus,30u2al,SpoomMcKay,0,Mon Mar 30 23:35:39 2015 UTC,It's a much higher chance of happening than Infamous second son.
PlayStationPlus,30u2al,Selykg,5,Tue Mar 31 00:48:12 2015 UTC,i don't know about that. Release of second son was about a year ago. Wolfenstein was what? 10 months?   I'd bet second son comes to ps+ before Wolfenstein does.

PlayStationPlus,30u2al,Yosonimbored,2,Mon Mar 30 22:40:30 2015 UTC,Dark Souls didn't get a digital release on the PS3? Seems odd to me since XBox got it and was actually a Games with Gold game about a year ago.

Grand Theft Auto has a feature where when a PS4 stream is going or a video clip is saved, the music will automatically be substituted with GTA's score (though the player will still hear the licensed radio music as normal) All other sound effects and dialog will be intact.

PlayStationPlus,30pem1,Pantry_Inspector,28,Sun Mar 29 17:36:48 2015 UTC,But RPGs are the exception that proves the rule. Very few non-RPGs are more than 10-15 hours.
PlayStationPlus,30pem1,arcteus,-19,Sun Mar 29 18:06:00 2015 UTC,"What constitutes a non-RPG in gaming in the past 5 years?  RPG is a very vague and non-descriptive category. In the 90s an RPG was a game where you had things like ""character levels"" and ""items""...  What game now doesn't have these things? Fucking Batman games had items and ways to ""pseudo level"" with experience points. Fucking latest CoD multiplier even had itemized guns.   Also, feel free to prove your point with statistics instead of opinion and conjecture: http://howlongtobeat.com/stats.php"
PlayStationPlus,30pem1,somehokie,5,Sun Mar 29 19:55:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know how well I trust that site though, for there are many muliplayer only games that people report tons of single player hours into.  The other problem comes games like Minecraft and KSP where there's no set goal, and so problem give them total game time as completion time, which can be upwards of hundreds of hours.  Overall, the site is a good reference for games with lots of submitters for rough estimates, but the data is very unreliable.  WoT at the top of their longest games list has only four people who submitted times as of this post for the multiplayer section, with a huge standard deviation."
PlayStationPlus,30pem1,arcteus,-13,Sun Mar 29 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean it was gospel, are you saying its better to fly by anecdotes?  I noticed you didn't provide a better source for scrutiny.  Also, yea there's plenty of outliers, but I was mainly proving that subjective statement was subjective.  And I believe that unless you are someone who samples games and never beats them, you would know that games in general are demanding more and more time. That does NOT mean I am arguing that everyone gives in to the demand, only that, as you noted, the multiplier incorporation is starting to blur with single player. Companies want us playing longer.   /u/Pantry_Inspector didn't link his PSN, so I have no clue what he plays. But the original commentor had his linked and his game completion was like %14...of course games are less than 12 hours when you don't fucking play them.  Stay tuned for the sound of one hand clapping and the sound a tree makes when no one is around."
PlayStationPlus,30pem1,somehokie,4,Sun Mar 29 22:01:42 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean it was gospel, are you saying its better to fly by anecdotes?   Of course not.  But you are aware that site is entirely anecdotes being shared in a structured form?   Also, yea there's plenty of outliers, but I was mainly proving that subjective statement was subjective.   Very few non-RPGs are more than 10-15 hours.    Eh.  It's not subjective, as it's not based on an opinion, but can be proven (or disproven) with facts.  So it's an objective statement, but it could be correct or incorrect.  Subjective statements are things that can't be proven solely with facts, like ""Americans like Coke more than Pepsi.""  Though, in turn, we can make objective statements using subjective statements as a guide, such as ""Americans buy and drink more Coke products than Pepsi products.""   you would know that games in general are demanding more and more time.    Didn't you complain about anecdotes?  I'm not taking sides about what genres take more time to play or have longer stories, but I think this statement is false.  We have games that are shorter and games that are longer.  I'm sure if there was a solid scientific way to look at things, we'd see that the average hasn't moved much.  But that's subjective.   as you noted, the multiplier [sic] incorporation is starting to blur with single player   Did you read my comment?  The only place I noted single vs multiplayer is I said multiplayer-only games have single-player times listed on HLoB.  I definitely agree with this statement, but in one way did I note anything to lead to this.   Companies want us playing longer   Depends on the game.  If it's episodic through DLC, like Destiny, Call of Duty, or Assassin's Creed, I definitely agree.  But for ""one and done"" style games, like many indies, they just want us to play and enjoy - length is less of a concern.  You also have yearly franchises that always want you to upgrade to the next title.  So I'd say ""yes and no"".   /u/Pantry_Inspector didn't link his PSN.   So what?  You, nor anybody else, asked to look at it, and he felt no need to post it indiscriminately.  There's also a problem with that site, where it lists trophy completion, not personal user's completion point.  Take one of the games I have the Platinum for, ""Hyperdimension Netpunia Re;Birth 1"" on the PS Vita.  I was done with the story and unlocking characters by 40-ish hours, but it took me until nearly 80 hours to get the Platinum.  Many players would be personally feeling done after the story, which would cover only roughly 25% of trophies in that game.  If I looked at someone's profile and saw that 25% but saw it included the ""beat the game"" trophies, I wouldn't think they haven't beaten the game.  Trophy completion doesn't always equal game completion.   of course games are less than 12 hours when you don't fucking play them.   DravenMain has so few games played on his PS4, that I really, really doubt that these are all of the games he's ever played.  And even then, if you look into the trophy lists, you'd see he has beaten the games, but hasn't scoured for ever collectable item inside.  Take TLoU for example, he's got the trophies for beating it on every difficulty - but that's it.  That's only 9% of trophies in that game.  Does that mean he's only 9% done with it?  For a trophy hunter, maybe, but for him, he felt satisfied.   Stay tuned for the sound of one hand clapping and the sound a tree makes when no one is around.   No reason to be a prick because someone doesn't agree."
PlayStationPlus,30pem1,Pantry_Inspector,3,Sun Mar 29 22:37:02 2015 UTC,"I'll respond to you because you're not an asshole. I personally have no interest in debating something I couldn't really care less about. I disagree wholeheartedly that 'RPG' is vague, especially as someone who plays A LOT of turned-based RPGs. But again, not passionate enough to argue for them.   I haven't linked my PSN account because I don't play my PS3 that much and don't pay any attention to trophies, so I never really thought to do it.  Thanks for responding for me (seriously) because I was so put off by this guy and his weird insistence that a casual discussion become a pissing match with verified figures.  Last note: it's really obvious from his linked site that most non-RPGs are between 5 and 16 hours, with some outliers closer to 20. Why would he link something that disproves his point?

A few of the top ten now playing from HLTB*:   Skyrim - Main Story (campaign) - 31 hours Borderlands 2 - Main Story (campaign) - 31 hours GTA V - Main Story (campaign) - 31 hours AC: Black Flag- Main Story (campaign) - 22.5 hours Tomb Raider - Main Story (campaign) - 11.5 (barely made it) Bioshock Infinite - Main Story (campaign) - 11.5 (barely made it) The Last of Us - Main Story (campaign) - 15 hours   *These hours are of course estimates and based on ONLY the main game not running through side quests or grinding collectibles. Notice the site does provide other stats for those things.  Now are these ALL RPGs? No, maybe a few could be considered pure RPG, but now-a-days most modern games simply incorporate things that we consider RPG elements (levels, itemization, character progression).   So in you statement what is and isn't an RPG? Call of Duty?   CoD: Advanced Warfare - 7 hours Battlefield 4 - 5 hours Battlefield Hardline - 7.5 hours   Oh wait, but then you grind multiplier for 100+ hours and it becomes RPG-like just like every fucking modern game of the past 5 years...

And why do you assume that because you perceive yourself as bad at video games (something arbitrary and totally worthless to even point out) that somehow correlates with how fast one progresses through the games? And the on top of that, why do you assume that others play games the same way you do?

PlayStationPlus,30opz4,Lumas202,3,Sun Mar 29 10:30:00 2015 UTC,Same. I'm a teacher and coming out this Tuesday would have given me my entire spring break. Next week gives me a couple of days during which I may or may not be in town.
PlayStationPlus,30opz4,TheGallifreyan,1 point,Sun Mar 29 13:37:31 2015 UTC,Pfft... they can barely handle doing one region at a time properly.
PlayStationPlus,30opz4,killit,1 point,Sun Mar 29 14:26:21 2015 UTC,"I've not had Plus very long, is there a history of them screwing up the monthly goodies?"
PlayStationPlus,30opz4,TheGallifreyan,2,Tue Mar 31 12:07:20 2015 UTC,"The roll out is usually problematic for some people for several hours after the update. Things like some of the games not being available free right away, needing to search for some of them manually, and that sort of thing.  It's not a big deal, as it's always (from what I know) fixed within the first day, but I imagine doing the rollout worldwide on the same day would increase such issues."
PlayStationPlus,30opz4,killit,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:38:59 2015 UTC,"Isn't that more a problem with people's perspective as opposed to how Sony perform the releases?    It's impossible to roll things out instantly like that for everyone, it will take time; not only that, but gradual rollouts for large userbases are considered best practice, if you release to a minority to begin with, when something's wrong (I say 'when', not 'if', because it is bound to happen sometime), it's much easier to spot and correct before releasing to the masses."
PlayStationPlus,30opz4,TheGallifreyan,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"As I said, it's not a big deal. My original  comment may have been harsher than I intended. My point is, they should continue to stagger the release as they do now or else I'm worried that these minor issues would become larger."
PlayStationPlus,30opz4,shitmyspacebar,0,Tue Mar 31 16:41:04 2015 UTC,"I imagine the EU store updates on Wednesday because if it updated on Tuesday like NA then because of the time zone differences, EU would release before NA and I don't think Sony wants that."
PlayStationPlus,30opz4,Brandhor,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:12:55 2015 UTC,"it's really stupid though, they would be released like 6 hours before while it's early morning in the east coast and the west coast is still sleeping, instead we have to wait ~20 hours to get them in europe, and I'm sure will have to wait for next week even if april 1st is the first wednesday of the month"
PlayStationPlus,30opz4,Boroda_UA,1 point,Mon Mar 30 10:25:52 2015 UTC,but in september 2014 games was released in wednesday 1st november and there was same calendar situation as now.
PlayStationPlus,30opz4,shitmyspacebar,3,Sun Mar 29 15:03:10 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about September, October or November 2014? Because October was the only one of those 3 months in the same calendar situation, and according to this link: http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2014/10/01/playstation-plus-october-driveclub-spelunky-dust-elysian-tale/ they were released Wednesday the 8th in EU."
PlayStationPlus,30opz4,Boroda_UA,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:11:29 2015 UTC,"September 2014-Tuesday 30.09.2014 = 1.10.2014 Wednesday, and games were up in Wednesday.  31 October 2014 were friday 30 November 2014 were sunday, so no sutuation like now and september 2014"
PlayStationPlus,30opz4,shitmyspacebar,2,Mon Mar 30 10:15:17 2015 UTC,"You're actually talking about the October games, that were announced September. And they were released Wednesday 8th October, not Wednesday 1st October"
PlayStationPlus,30opz4,Boroda_UA,1 point,Mon Mar 30 11:10:46 2015 UTC,oh i see you're right
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Foxes281,48,Fri Mar 27 14:11:55 2015 UTC,"Nothing has been said on this, but I'm pretty sure it'll be a while before they stop. The PS3 is still being sold and games are still being made for it. I don't really think it hurts that much to keep giving a few games away here and there, especially if they give out0 Indies and older titles and/or their own titles."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Seraphinejg,15,Fri Mar 27 14:39:55 2015 UTC,"It definitely won't hurt it, it's why I still have mine hooked up. As ps4 becomes more dominant theyll release better and better PS3 games from the vault. That's what I hope anyway."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Unsharted4,2,Fri Mar 27 19:46:08 2015 UTC,I don't agree it's hard to argue that the PS3 games haven't gone down in quality since the PS4 launched. I see no reason this trend won't continue.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,meganev,3,Fri Mar 27 23:36:57 2015 UTC,"I got a PS4 at launch with PS+.  I've been going strong with PS+ since day 1 and I finally got out and bought a used PS3 the other week. I had over 112 PS3/Vita games that I could just play instantly, its fucking awesome."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,HowieGaming,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:42:48 2015 UTC,"I jumped on the PS+ bandwagon when they announced PS4 multiplayer required it because I thought that I'm going to need it, so I may as well start getting the free PS3 games now.  Then I realized that it fit my broke ass gamer lifestyle so perfectly. I'm really kicking myself for not starting sooner."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,RevDanlldo,20,Sun Mar 29 17:46:43 2015 UTC,I think the bigger question is when Sony will no longer support the PSN infrastructure for the PS3.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Aram_Fingal,18,Fri Mar 27 17:03:14 2015 UTC,"If it's any indication, the PSP is discontinued and the PSN still works on it."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Bruce_Wang,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:02:08 2015 UTC,There were still ps2 games that had online access up till last year.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Freyaka,7,Sun Mar 29 15:33:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wonder about this every now and then. What happens to all your PS Plus games when they can't verify your Plus status anymore because PSN for PS3 no longer works?"
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,frosario,8,Fri Mar 27 19:56:37 2015 UTC,Guarantee you there's a line of small print in the PSPlus TOC just for that scenario.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,ActualButt,0,Fri Mar 27 20:14:49 2015 UTC,Proof?  Otherwise it isn't a guarantee...
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,OptionalDepression,5,Sat Mar 28 02:37:33 2015 UTC,All that line would say is you dont and never have owned any of it.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,renadi,-5,Sat Mar 28 03:05:47 2015 UTC,Figure of speech smart ass.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,ActualButt,2,Sat Mar 28 17:05:01 2015 UTC,I think there's still years to come on that.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Onionsteak,2,Fri Mar 27 20:21:13 2015 UTC,"The thought of this happening never crossed my mind. It's bound to happen sooner or later, so I need to get a external hd just for all of my digital games."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,DaxterAttano,5,Fri Mar 27 20:18:26 2015 UTC,How would an external HD help you in this case?
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,marktronic,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:36:09 2015 UTC,back up all my games on it????
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,DaxterAttano,9,Fri Mar 27 20:38:22 2015 UTC,"For the games you bought this will do fine. The free PS+ games however need an active PS+ account. Without PSN it can't check this, so the games woun't start"
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,RoelTM,0,Fri Mar 27 20:54:11 2015 UTC,"Yea, sorry. I wasn't thinking about plus games, just games that I have bought.    the downvotes though lol."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,DaxterAttano,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:35:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that shouldn't happen for asking questions..."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,RoelTM,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:31:44 2015 UTC,True. That is how communities cannibalise themselves and shun progress. Saw the same thing happen over in the Payday subreddit.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,OptionalDepression,21,Sat Mar 28 02:39:14 2015 UTC,"Why would they stop? They're keeping current PS3 owners happy, and at the same time have an incentive for PS4 owners (who likely all have Plus because of the gated multiplayer) to buy a PS3 since anyone that is smart (buys all free games, even for platforms they don't own) will have several games for it already.  As long as Sony is manifacturing PS3s they're not likely to stop."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,hovercraft_of_eels,3,Fri Mar 27 15:06:48 2015 UTC,"My guess is that they'll only stop when they stop manufacturing the PS3.  Until then, if they're going to the expense to produce and sell new hardware, that means they're still expecting new people to join the PS3 family, and that means they still have a market they can sell PS Plus to.  We might see some changes over time, though. Maybe a static Instant Game Collection, and some new small game once a month.  But as long as there's a monthly fee for PS+ on the PS3, they'll see some kind of new content once a month."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,BeriAlpha,8,Fri Mar 27 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"Well if the Playstation 2 is any indication, it was released in 2000 and was discontinued in 2013. If the PS3 has the same lifespan (released 2006), it will be discontinued in 2019. My guess is they wean off the games about 18 months before then."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,daniellesinclair,5,Fri Mar 27 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine in 1.5 to 3 years. But then again, what the hell do I know."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Bozarkian,2,Fri Mar 27 15:31:45 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they won't, unless they run out of titles to give and start recycling some of the older titles again back into the mix.  So here is another thing as well.  Sony said that they were not shutting down the PS3 servers for quite some period of time.  So if you want to make a PS3 purchase again for those who would just rather have a 4 and a 3 to go back an play games then there is that option for you."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,BuckwildBeast,2,Fri Mar 27 21:59:42 2015 UTC,"This probably won't happen for ATLEAST the next 5 years or so... think about it, if they end it they won't receive any more subscription revenue from PS3 gamers."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,wmurray003,2,Fri Mar 27 23:16:09 2015 UTC,"March 2017 is my completely unprofessional and uneducated guess. I figured the final retail PS3 releases will be rolling out end of this year. There might be some niche titles here and there, but not a whole lot. I figure they will keep it up for another year or so, to keep the memberships flowing.   Ultimately, you need PS+ for online PS4 play. Right now, all the free games are doing is selling subscriptions to PS3 users who haven't moved up to PS4. Once most everyone has moved, I think they will dump the free PS3 games and just add one more PS4 game."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,papadoc03,1 point,Sat Mar 28 08:06:47 2015 UTC,And when that happens I'll probably retire my ps3 to storage.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Rosur,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:12:30 2015 UTC,I figure htye need to give at least a years notice so people who only own ps3 know to stop subbing.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,naylord,1 point,Sat Mar 28 02:13:52 2015 UTC,Hopefully for a while. I plan on riding my PS3 until the wheels fall off (or until Mass Effect 4 comes out -- then it's time to upgrade).
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,zombieducklings,2,Sat Mar 28 04:31:07 2015 UTC,Same with me for ME4. At least that was until Just Cause 3 was announced so I'll probably get my PS4 in December and slowly catch up on all the games I missed in 2014 & 2015.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,laymness,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:49:41 2015 UTC,Probably when there's a significant drop in downloads/use. I think right now it's still very active so it's safe to say not for a while.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Eruanno,1 point,Sat Mar 28 05:20:05 2015 UTC,"Probably not any time soon. It's still generating money, games are being released for it and people are still paying and using PS+ on it. At a completely uneducated guess I'd say they will keep it up and running for at least another 5-6 years, probably more."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,zombieducklings,1 point,Sat Mar 28 12:37:52 2015 UTC,That's pretty far off. The PS5 will be out by then.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Eruanno,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"Unlikely. The PS3 was out for ages before they announced the PS4, I assume this generation will be pretty damn long too."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,zombieducklings,2,Sat Mar 28 16:34:42 2015 UTC,I don't think so. The jump I'm technology from PS3 to PS4 is much smaller than PS2-PS3.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Eruanno,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:50:54 2015 UTC,"I meant timewise, not technologywise. The last generation of consoles was really long."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,zombieducklings,2,Sat Mar 28 17:35:24 2015 UTC,But that's my point. It won't last as long because the jump in technology wasn't sign I can't enough. The difference between 2006 PS3 games and 2013 ones was massive. Buy I don't think the difference between 2013 and 20XX PS4 games will be as big. But I could be wrong.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,victovski,2,Sat Mar 28 18:14:04 2015 UTC,"Looking at the current lineups on the PS4, I think it's going to take at least a year because if they do this, they have to compensate on the PS4 lineup."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Isomodia,2,Fri Mar 27 14:33:56 2015 UTC,Why do you say this? Did they start offering less plus games on the other consoles when the PS4 launched?
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Loupip,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:19:41 2015 UTC,Didn't they take a game a month from PS3 and put it on ps4? I may be mistaken
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Isomodia,2,Fri Mar 27 16:36:42 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. I'm one of the ""bought a PS3 because of free plus games after getting a PS4"" crowd."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Sicmay,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:47:53 2015 UTC,They cancelled the instant game collection and reduced the number of PS3 games after a while
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,victovski,1 point,Sat Mar 28 08:22:03 2015 UTC,"No, but there's no point in taking out the PS3 lineup if the PS4 lineup isn't strong enough."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,nguyen_,-4,Fri Mar 27 16:34:23 2015 UTC,they have to compensate on the PS4 lineup.   You're assuming all PS3 owners have PS4s
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,DrossSA,5,Fri Mar 27 17:47:02 2015 UTC,"No, we're assuming all PS+ subscribers once they discontinue incentives for PS3 owners have PS4s."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,nguyen_,-5,Fri Mar 27 18:55:34 2015 UTC,Semantics. You know exactly what I meant.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,DrossSA,6,Fri Mar 27 19:00:57 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying something different than you were.  When PS3 support ends, there will be no reason for people to subscribe if they do not own a PS4 or plan to purchase one.  If they want to woo those people into buying one, a good lineup of high profile PS4 titles like they had on PS3 would be a great start.    After I had owned a PS3 for a while and built up several months of free Vita games, I bought a Vita so I could play them.  It's likely that they could motivate me to buy a PS4 the same way, but most of the PS4 lineup so far has been indie games I can get on Steam or Vita."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,QuadraQ,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:28:24 2015 UTC,"I'm much more worried about ""loosing"" all my PS+ games when the discontinue support for it. They should have some way you can keep the games."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,zombieducklings,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:54:37 2015 UTC,I don't understand how you could lose them?
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,MogMcKupo,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:52:17 2015 UTC,"As it is free money for them (from subs), and the prevalence of that generation (kids don't have 300 bucks for a PS4), I would assume it will be until 2016 at least."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,buzz0309,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"Probably when they start giving AAA games to ps4, which while take another year or 2"
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,wmurray003,-2,Fri Mar 27 20:09:22 2015 UTC,"We've had a few triple A games... Evil Within, Alien Isolation, Blood Bourne etc."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,coyote1284,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:18:22 2015 UTC,I think buzz0309 meant when they start giving AAA PS4 games on PS+.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,wmurray003,1 point,Sat Mar 28 11:16:56 2015 UTC,I realized after the fact. They haven't started doing that because there aren't very many AAA titles and the companies want to make as much money off of the AAA's that are out as possible.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,Smallkittenfeet,-1,Sat Mar 28 15:33:23 2015 UTC,Tell that to Sony then who thinks we need indies shoved down our throats every month.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,letsgometros,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:34:51 2015 UTC,My guess is that'll happen when PS5 comes out  And what of our digital games collection? I will always for the rest of my life (hopefully another 50 years at least) want to play the games i have on my PS3. this is the problem with digital. if my PS3 doesn't last that long or the hard drive dies and I need to download them again will I be able to?   This is one area where Steam is a much more customer friendly
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,zombieducklings,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:23:05 2015 UTC,Of course you will. As long as you still have a PS+ account they'll be saved in your downloads. You don't need to download the games to save them. I don't have a PS4 or Vita but I still have games for the from PS+ for when I get them.
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,architta,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:51:37 2015 UTC,"Sony goes by their '10 year life cycle' for the system. Meaning they will support a system fully for at-least 10 years. Ps3 was released November of 2006. So expect Sony to maintain support until November of 2016. With that said the ps3 received support for a few years more even after the 10 years. So I would say at-least until early 2017, maybe early 2018 if they are generous."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,evilshadowdove,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:47:59 2015 UTC,"The PS3 is currently outselling the WiiU.   So I hope not anytime soon!  I mean, people still love them some PS3."
PlayStationPlus,30hqxv,DrYaguar,3,Sat Mar 28 02:31:32 2015 UTC,"We still get good games in the PS3, the things is that developers are not interested in the last generation now, so we won't see the same deals as 2013 and early 2014."

PlayStationPlus,30euep,Lumas202,6,Sat Mar 28 00:39:24 2015 UTC,"it's not particularly hyperbolic to state that only reddit uses ""deep"" as an intensifier for ""discounts"".   Yes it is. The phrase 'Deep discounts' predates reddit. Amazon uses 'Deep Discounts'. So do plenty of stores. 'Deep Discount' is just a generic term for a discount that's larger than what people would expect."

PlayStationPlus,30bojv,letsgometros,12,Thu Mar 26 01:32:37 2015 UTC,We need this on ps4
PlayStationPlus,30bojv,DenominatorX,6,Thu Mar 26 02:41:53 2015 UTC,I'd like it if buying these meant they'd unlock in the Now library for you.
PlayStationPlus,30bojv,Fruhmann,3,Thu Mar 26 09:51:47 2015 UTC,Here here! I've suggested to Sony that if they won't offer Plus members a discount on Now that maybe they can offer Plus subscribers free access to the digital games they already own. My PS3 is on its last legs and I want to completely switch platforms by now.
PlayStationPlus,30bojv,AshMCairo,3,Thu Mar 26 12:31:32 2015 UTC,"here's the deal. nobody wants to rent. if sony is committed to this rental option, they should just write Playstation Now in the yellow font and blue background to make it look like Blockbuster.  I don't rent those steam games I never play. I own them. They're mine on my list. I grow my list of game I own. Games I play all the time and games I'll never play.  I hope they'll see past this failed-from-the-start approach and change over to an account based library system that has prices comparable to competitors, both online and physical.   Honestly, I would much rather give Sony my money for a game that's digitally tied to my account and not have to wait for shipping or deal with cases and disc. But when the same item is on amazon for half the cost and will be on my doorstep in two days, or at a local target/bestbuy/etc for $5 more than amazon but immediately available, then Sony doesn't get my money.   Being able to compete, not just outright price match or undercut, is something PSN has only been able to do through flash sales. So it's great that I spent money on a few $0.90 games this week, but amazon and other places are pulling $30+ during a similar week."
PlayStationPlus,30bojv,Fruhmann,2,Thu Mar 26 13:33:47 2015 UTC,"I have no problem renting. I have a GameFly subscription so I can try a game before I buy it and in most cases I don't buy it. I'll beat the game and then be done with it. Very few games have any replayability value to me and those that do I usually wait for a GotY or Deluxe edition to come out. With that in mind, if Sony can compete with GameFly on value then I would be much more likely to rent from Sony."
PlayStationPlus,30bojv,AshMCairo,1 point,Thu Mar 26 13:47:25 2015 UTC,"i have not seen the new/current rates, but when i saw it was $5 for half a day I just laughed. Most of those ps3 games are $ at gamestop used. I could essentially just save up and buy the ps3 i traded in for the ps4 back from gamestop and forgo Now entirely.   Being competitive in pricing is something PSN and Live really have been lax about. When an international outlet is selling a game for $30 and you still have it on your digital store for $60, something is wrong there."
PlayStationPlus,30bojv,Fruhmann,2,Thu Mar 26 17:58:46 2015 UTC,"The PS Now rates haven't changed from what I can tell, and the selection of games from the PS Now subscription service does not cover all of the games available on Now. That last part I believe is a bad move on Sony's part.  I've only rented one game on PS Now because my kids can play it on the PlayStation TV. $15 for 3 months is an OK price point for that game in particular. Not great; just OK. If my kids want to play this one game again, next time I'll give them time on the big family TV or just drag the PS3 into their room."
PlayStationPlus,30bojv,AshMCairo,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:08:31 2015 UTC,"that's really what is comes down to.   if i'm not paying to add games to my account bound library, then i'm paying a monthly fee for access to their games library or it's not worth it.   if netflix charged per title/per view/whatever and the cost was comparable to what the physical copy cost in a bargain bin at walmart, then i'm sure everyone would still have walls of DVDs in their living rooms."
PlayStationPlus,30bojv,Fruhmann,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:22:20 2015 UTC,The problem is that streaming a game uses more bandwidth than downloading it once and playing whenever. I assume that's why there is no option to buy games on PS Now to stream indefinitely. I think PS1 games will be downloaded and emulated on your PS4 if/when they make it to PS Now because they're relatively small files. Streaming them would be inefficient.
PlayStationPlus,30bojv,IllIllIII,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:46:30 2015 UTC,"I'm still waiting for some magical update to download PS1, PS2, and mini games to play on the PS4.  As for not being able to buy a game to stream forever I agree with you that it would be a tax on their resources if it was available to everyone. I suggested to Sony that they add that option on for PS+ members as a bonus."
PlayStationPlus,30bojv,AshMCairo,2,Thu Mar 26 16:38:40 2015 UTC,I think that would actually make PS Now make sense. sigh*

Then it said the GOW: Ascension Ultimate then said Unavailable for the rest of the day where before I checked out it said $8 like it does today. Now the DLC upgrade is showing unavailable and the game is $8.  My assumption is something fucky was going on in general when they put the God of War game on sale and some people just reaped the benefits one way or another.

PlayStationPlus,3094cj,redisforever,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:13:18 2015 UTC,Damn... Thank God I hit X when that happened to me as I was about to do the last mission earlier today.
PlayStationPlus,3094cj,MakeshiftMakeshift,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:26:35 2015 UTC,"Definitely... most of the time you know when you're not going to make it to the end of the level, so it's better to just bail the mission and hope you get a better level when you retry. I'm surprised the harder difficulties still let you do this."
PlayStationPlus,3094cj,SomeAppleGuy,8,Thu Mar 26 17:05:01 2015 UTC,"I have not finished CounterSpy yet, but considering I did not have to pay for it, I am more than impressed. It added a more classic, platform style game to my library and its a fresh change from my other AAA titles. Perhaps the best thing about it is the ability to play a level and set it down. You can play for 10 minutes or hours, it doesn't matter. I also enjoy the careful scavenging of levels that rewards you with new weapons and formulas. Really cannot recommend it enough as a free game. Would pay up to $10 for it if it wasn't free."
PlayStationPlus,3094cj,abdeluna,5,Wed Mar 25 15:32:26 2015 UTC,CounterSpy earned it's spot on the top screen of my vita! Such a cool little game :)
PlayStationPlus,3094cj,SomeAppleGuy,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:00:40 2015 UTC,I'm playing on PS4 but considering the iOS version just so I can play on the go. It's so good to pick up and play.
PlayStationPlus,3094cj,redisforever,3,Thu Mar 26 13:36:42 2015 UTC,"I finished my first game today. Such a fun game, great music. Some problems, but they're not big enough to stop me from having fun with it."
PlayStationPlus,3094cj,SomeAppleGuy,2,Wed Mar 25 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"Totally agree! Love the overall vibe, and without having to make the decision to purchase it, I cannot complain."
PlayStationPlus,3094cj,chinese_medicine,5,Thu Mar 26 13:35:24 2015 UTC,"I pretty much played CounterSpy non-stop until I got all the trophies which isn't something I usually do with games. It was really great but I wish there was more replay value. It's in need of a Time Attack or Endless mode. Hopefully there will be DLC or a sequel in the future which I will happily buy.  As far as strategy, the persuasion darts are really important for getting through large rooms with multiple enemies and getting the 100% stealth trophy. Hit someone with a machine gun as soldiers with shotguns or grenade launchers will not take out many enemies before the effects wear off. Also, it's sometimes advantageous to stay in 2D side scroller mode during big gun fights to take out more enemies quickly.  OlliOlli2 is also very good although I thought the difficulty spiked significantly with the Zombie Funfair levels and I was unable to progress past the first one. I find it very difficult to pull off specific tricks as well. I do respect the old school style gameplay where you basically just have to keep playing until you get better. I'll definitely be picking it back up in the future."
PlayStationPlus,3094cj,redisforever,2,Wed Mar 25 15:43:04 2015 UTC,Counterspy does sort of have an endless mode. You don't have to do the final mission as soon as it comes up. You can keep doing regular missions to get more weapons and stuff.
PlayStationPlus,3094cj,MakeshiftMakeshift,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:22:46 2015 UTC,"The Stealth trophy was the hardest one for me. I didn't use that dart though, since I just kept trying it over on the first level of New Game over and over. Probably should have thought of doing that... especially since I used that dart a lot on every playthrough. Seemed like the most powerful weapon, to me. Guards tend to kill each other with grenade launcher even WITHOUT the dart, so using it on them made quick work of things."
PlayStationPlus,3094cj,MakeshiftMakeshift,2,Thu Mar 26 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"OlliOlli 2  I was a big fan of OlliOlli and absolutely loved Olli2, so much that I got the plat in about a week... I just couldn't put it down. I'm a big fan of games with short levels that you're asked to master, so you end up doing them over and over, getting the controls down to muscle memory, and perfecting a run.  At first I thought the level themes were going to bug me since it was such a departure from the realistic-ish themed levels in Olli1, but it made for some very entertaining sections so I can't complain.  Manuals really changed the way the game played, I felt. The end of Olli1 was non-stop grind fests so that you could get massive combos, where in Olli2 you have to combine grinds and manuals, Tony Hawk style, to achieve that. This also means you could combo entire levels right from the start, which was great for Olli1 fans who knew the ropes already.   I see a lot of people struggling with the controls, and most seem to be Tony Hawk vets, so I can understand that. I wonder how today's PS4 update might affect that, though? I'd like to see some player's custom controller mappings for Olli2 use and if it helped them out.  CounterSpy  I just finished this one a couple days ago, and really enjoyed it! Very fresh experience, with some good challenge. One thing I found odd though, by the end of my third run on the hardest difficulty, I STILL hadn't unlocked all the weapons, and I'm the kind of player that always tried to find the secrets. I realized this is because I always went for the levels that yielded more Codes to move forward in story progress, instead of focusing on levels with more Weapon parts or Formulas. I played the entire game with a pistol, a silenced pistol, an assault rifle, and the mind-manipulation dart, and never felt like I needed anything else, so I never bothered to prioritize missions with more weapon parts than Codes. I just couldn't find the justification for it; the only time I'd prioritize anything other than the Codes was if a level had 3-4 officers and I was Defcon 1 or 2 there. Plus, on the harder difficulties I pretty much always ended up spending all my earned money on replenishing ammo and grabbing a couple formulas, so buying the higher-end weapons wasn't an option even if I had unlocked them. Something about the way they handled that just felt a little off.  (I played both of these on PS4)"
PlayStationPlus,3094cj,saywhattyall,2,Thu Mar 26 17:01:52 2015 UTC,Uhhh how exactly did you get all stars on all the pro levels
PlayStationPlus,3094cj,zombieducklings,2,Sat Mar 28 01:38:45 2015 UTC,"CounterSpy was an interesting game but it had a lot of issues. The AI was a bit loose in when enemies detected you or not, which caused a lot of frustration. Also, the controls were a bit wonky sometimes and didn't respond properly. I would love to see a sequel that fixed some of these issues though."
PlayStationPlus,3094cj,mediarulestheworld,2,Sat Mar 28 15:39:00 2015 UTC,"I've been having a lot of fun with OlliOlli 2. It doesn't really feel like much has changed from the first game, but it's still just as fun. It helps that I get it for free with PS+."

PlayStationPlus,308dfd,SkinnedRat,2,Wed Mar 25 09:44:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know why they can't just hire someone with CMS experience to set up a proper staging system, so you can put all the changes in for the next week starting on Thursday. You can take your time, have a 2nd person/team verify all the prices and descriptions are correct, and then have a set time for changes to go live on the production servers, like Wednesday's at noon.  But they seem to like to work on a live system. Heck, I got burned buying something on a Wednesday. They removed a sale a week early and I didn't catch I paid full price. 10 minutes later the sale price was back...  Maybe they have started making a proper CMS, as they don't come quick/cheap, especially something as custom as the PS store, but I doubt it..."

PlayStationPlus,30cm3c,SkyScooter,0,Thu Mar 26 08:27:02 2015 UTC,"I wish it was something similar like what you've said.

As a grown-up that pays for products with my own money though, I have the power and ability to choose to whom I give that money.  If I felt that over the course of a year, I didn't get a product worth paying for - I wouldn't pay for it. I wouldn't month after month, piss and moan about how what I want isn't being catered to.  So yes, mocking that constant, monthly, whiny, I want what I want attitude is a lot more amusing to me.  If people don't like a product, they should stop paying for it."
PlayStationPlus,304tqq,ReverendVoice,8,Tue Mar 24 17:23:49 2015 UTC,I think its more about how disappointing it is to see PS+ go SO FAR downhill from what it once was. I agree though.

PlayStationPlus,304tqq,UrbanRedFox,4,Tue Mar 24 22:32:09 2015 UTC,NO! you misunderstand. I am satisfied with how they are handling PS4. It's more how PS3 and vita has gone down since PS4's inclusion. Like I said though I agree with your first statement.
PlayStationPlus,304tqq,Flgibson97,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:35:47 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna have to disagree with you on that one man. I don't think the Plus games for the ps3 has gone downhill at all. As far as I'm concerned, strong line-ups that consist of triple A games and some honestly, really charming and fun indies that people should really just try their hand at, have become more frequent in the past few months. I think it's just getting better. This makes sense as agreements for last gen games to be featured as plus games, i assume, are much easier to finalize. And I think it shows. As for the vita, can't say anything about that cause I don't own a vita"
PlayStationPlus,304tqq,TartarRenegade,2,Wed Mar 25 08:35:19 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, if I didn't think I was getting good value, I wouldn't subscribe. PS Plus is like $50 a year and it's more than paid for itself this year already with Valiant Hearts, Sherlock Holmes, Thief and First Light. Not to mention the ones I haven't gotten to yet.  I only download games I'm actually interested in and I have to keep a Word document with a list of my Plus games so I can keep track of my library. Even without the free games Plus is worth it just for the online multiplayer, cloud saves and discounts."

PlayStationPlus,304tqq,thecacti,0,Tue Mar 24 16:12:58 2015 UTC,Probably the crackdown was due to it potentially cutting into sales of said igc games prior to being put on igc.   It's probably a part of the deal with the developer to have a sale prior to adding it where they try to squeeze what remaining amounts they can via sales. If it gets leaked it would endanger those last minute sales to squeeze out guillable fools prior to giving it for free

That leaves Ascension Ultimate Edition, which you're blocked from buying if you already own the DLC bundle that was free at one point.

PlayStationPlus,308ygq,Redevil1987,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:04:33 2015 UTC,"If you buy the DLC pack first or have bought it previously, it rendered them unavailable since the ultimate edition comes with that DLC.

PlayStationPlus,300g34,dawnofthemichael,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:51:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with Hohokum, especially since they've already put the other 3 games from the 2014 PLAY sale (The Swapper, Counterspy, Rogue Legacy) on PS+. Pretty sure that's coming soon. Not sure what else they might put up but don't think it'd be Wolfensten."

PlayStationPlus,300g34,evilpigskin,2,Mon Mar 23 14:50:31 2015 UTC,Correct...although I could swear announcements are on the Thursday before.   Seems for awhile I always see people freaking about  the games not getting announced on that Wednesday and its always (or most of the time) on Thursday.    Did I miss something were Sony changed it to Wednesday?     My money goes towards announcement on the 2nd for the US.   Could be a leak before that but officially will be the 1st or 2nd for sure.

In all of those cases, the IGC games were released on the 7th in US, and 8th in EU with announcements on the 31st/1st. I imagine it will be the same this month, so you won't find out until next week"
PlayStationPlus,300g34,willgeld,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:15:44 2015 UTC,The announcement is generally 1 week before the games release. The games release on the 8th (not the 1st) of April for EU because they always release 1 day after the US games.. And the first tuesday is the 7th.   So the announcement is next week :)

PlayStationPlus,300g34,crokexcore,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:58:51 2015 UTC,"Considering Hotline Miami 2 was just on sale in the spring fever thing, I doubt they'd give it out for free too.  If Qbert is included though, I'd hope it's a crossbuy title."
PlayStationPlus,300g34,slader166,1 point,Tue Mar 24 10:05:22 2015 UTC,What about dark souls 1 ?
PlayStationPlus,300g34,GXsolution,1 point,Tue Mar 24 12:03:34 2015 UTC,XCOM: Enemy Within for PS3?  It's finally discounted lots of places and I just bought it on my XBOX 360 so...it will probably come to PS3 now.
PlayStationPlus,300g34,crokexcore,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:20:51 2015 UTC,it was already in ps plus I think.
PlayStationPlus,300g34,HydraVea,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"I know that Enemy Unknown was, but I didn't know about Within."
PlayStationPlus,300g34,peterkozmd,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:55:27 2015 UTC,What day is the announcement? I thought it would of been on the 26th
PlayStationPlus,300g34,dotdotP,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:34:37 2015 UTC,Limbo was already on PS+ at some point.  My prediction for PS4 : Bastion
PlayStationPlus,300g34,Smallkittenfeet,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:21:38 2015 UTC,"Bastion is a part of the Spring Fever sale, so it won't be on Plus for a few months at least"
PlayStationPlus,300g34,Ayyylien,1 point,Tue Mar 24 09:42:30 2015 UTC,"I got my PS4 and my Vita just 2 months away, so I don't know what came out in the past. Did Dragon's Crown came out anytime? This guy from a podcast I hear talks about it non stop, and I kind of want to try it out.  EDIT: Nevermid. I just saw the all time lists. Is it any good?"
PlayStationPlus,300g34,rainmcmanis,2,Thu Mar 26 13:58:00 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend getting Muramasa: Rebirth. It's made by Vanillaware (the developer of Dragon's Crown), but it's so much better imo. Easily one of my most favorite games for the Vita so far."
PlayStationPlus,300g34,peterkozmd,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:05:51 2015 UTC,I'd give it a go if I were you. Play it on my PSTV and it's a blast (:
PlayStationPlus,300g34,rainmcmanis,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:26:49 2015 UTC,"I'll wait until it's on sale. It's 40 € right now, and I don't want to pay that much for a game I don't know I'd like. Besides, Bloodborne will be time consuming... :D"
PlayStationPlus,300g34,hipo5PL,1 point,Tue Mar 24 09:53:35 2015 UTC,"PS4 had so many indie games that I think they might get an AAA title for a change. Maybe Murder: Soul Suspect?  PS3 could be either getting one or two Indie cross-buy titles with Vita, like Crimsonland and KickBeat/DiveKick alongside of Dishonored.  PSVita I hope we get Borderlands 2. Its been awhile since the port was released and it never went to sale once. I feel like we might get it on May if not April. Ethan: Meteor Hunter might be free too, since they pushed the game with cheap sales a lot of times."
PlayStationPlus,300g34,Smallkittenfeet,0,Tue Mar 24 10:10:45 2015 UTC,This. Look at all the crap indies they tried to shove down our throats in repeat sales gradually lowering   crimnsonland and ethan aren't selling very well maybe not these particular titles but my guess is dishonored with one-two of those crappy indie games
PlayStationPlus,300g34,rainmcmanis,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:14:30 2015 UTC,"I would love it if PS4 got Sleeping Dogs, but I doubt that's going to happen anytime soon..."
PlayStationPlus,300g34,Smallkittenfeet,-13,Tue Mar 24 14:33:29 2015 UTC,"More trash indies for the PS4.  Don't get me wrong I loved counterspy and oddworld. VH was ok, kinda dragged on in my opinion.  But trash like olliolli, then february's line up... I don't expect much."
PlayStationPlus,300g34,GoldenNewt,7,Thu Mar 26 13:42:08 2015 UTC,I hated Olli Olli 2
PlayStationPlus,300g34,Smallkittenfeet,6,Mon Mar 23 17:38:45 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one, look at the trophy completion rate on the game.   Very few people played long enough to unlock the first trophy for beating the first few levels."
PlayStationPlus,300g34,GoldenNewt,2,Tue Mar 24 02:27:03 2015 UTC,"not seeing the love for olli olli  frustrating controls, seriously i got to push a button when i try to land flat? how about i just keep the board flat and just let gravity do its job?  yeah sorry i may be a old 35 yr old gamer but not seeing the appeal on this. looks like it should be fun with the graphics etc but the controls are too overly difficult and frustrating  did love BOI though, that was a fun roguelike lite game"
PlayStationPlus,300g34,Smallkittenfeet,2,Tue Mar 24 04:03:30 2015 UTC,Good post and I agree.  Fellow old gamer here.  OlliOlli feels like it belongs on newgrounds circa 1998.  My son has pretty much the same game on his tablet and that one actually plays better.  There is nothing fun about twirling the left stick and pressing the X button.  I feel bad for the people who will buy this junk at full price expecting a real skateboarding game.
PlayStationPlus,300g34,InsaneTomato95,3,Tue Mar 24 16:37:36 2015 UTC,Olli Olli 2 was the best game this month dude. Valiant Hearts was pretty good too.  I hope we get some nice vita titles.
PlayStationPlus,300g34,freaknpsykotik,-20,Tue Mar 24 16:55:08 2015 UTC,No a 2d side scrolling flash game wasn't the best game this month it was the WORST.
PlayStationPlus,300g34,peterkozmd,3,Mon Mar 23 18:47:44 2015 UTC,Not much to be good or bad at.  Stick and X button.
PlayStationPlus,300g34,thrillxseeker,-3,Mon Mar 23 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"Actually I just don't like to play flash games on a $400 console. But keep assuming things bud, maybe eventually it will get you somewhere."
PlayStationPlus,2zw7ni,FickleLife,6,Sun Mar 22 11:02:51 2015 UTC,"Sadly, no. You cant change your account region, Sony decided to be asses about it. You can access your main account from anywhere, there's no IP block or anything, so your BF4 Premium stuff should be fine, just use your UK account.  Edit: You could also make an Australian or US account (prepaid cards or stuff), purchase things on them, and play on your main, if you care about trophies. There are extremely few games that are region locked, Persona 4 Arena is the first one that comes to mind."
PlayStationPlus,2zw7ni,omkrn2000,4,Sun Mar 22 15:16:10 2015 UTC,Right. I think I'll just maintain my UK account. when the ps5 comes out though I'll be getting a USA account if this policy doesn't change. Seems crazy they can't change stores when someone moves country.
PlayStationPlus,2zw7ni,cenorexia,9,Sun Mar 22 16:16:20 2015 UTC,Did you try calling their support?  You cannot change your region or user name by yourself but maybe  they're willing to do it for you. Might be worth a try if you want your region changed.
PlayStationPlus,2zw7ni,IC_Pandemonium,8,Sun Mar 22 18:28:34 2015 UTC,"You really don't want to be doing that anyway, considering that AUS prices are a rip off compared to the UK store. I just buy top ups through PayPal and buy my games in pounds. Ends up much cheaper than most physical options here."
PlayStationPlus,2zw7ni,omkrn2000,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:49:38 2015 UTC,"True. Since the European PS+ extravaganza has ended and isn't looking to come back, US is providing the best prices and deals at the moment though."
PlayStationPlus,2zw7ni,Chad___Sexington,2,Sun Mar 22 23:49:09 2015 UTC,Don't do it! You will pay 2 times as much with an AU account. I moved from Canada to NZ and hell no if im paying those digital prices when I can literally pay half that on my old account.
PlayStationPlus,2zw7ni,Ienjoylongwalks,2,Mon Mar 23 01:23:02 2015 UTC,Yeah it sucks you can't change it. I have an NZ account while living in Australia. I just get my parents to buy me PSN gift cards back home so I've got credit for my PS plus. If you're from the UK you may be able to buy gift cards from Amazon or other game stores online.
