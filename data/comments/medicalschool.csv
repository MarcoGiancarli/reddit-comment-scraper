medicalschool,3e3bgv,CyberianCitizen,15,Tue Jul 21 17:09:45 2015 UTC,"I completely understand the point of this article and DO agree with what the author is saying. I am Canadian (yes, complete socialist) and one thing that CAN be an issue with out healthcare system is that, since healthcare is free, sometimes people go to see a doctor (whether it be their PCP or an ER doc) when they really don't need to. Now, I feel like everyone should be entitled to some peace of mind, just because we know its ""just a cold"" and there is ""nothing to be done"", doesn't mean the 20-something year old mom with the sick kid isn't worried about it. Patients typically aren't trying to waste our time, they just want themselves or a loved one to feel better.   I both understand healthcare workers frustration with people going to the ER when they really have no place there AND the position of the worried patients. However, I truly believe it is awful that were parents like those having a rough time with money, they would have to pause and determine whether they (untrained/not knowledgeable in medicine) thought their kid needed medical attention ""bad enough"" to justify several hundred dollars. This is part of the reason why people don't go in to see a doctor until a pathology has progressed ""too far"" and why PCPs are doing more damage control than preventative medicine.   I am fortunate to be from Canada where I don't have to budget in an unknown/unpredictable illness/ I think it is pretty awful that in a country with the medical resources that America has, that patients have to basically do a pro-con list as to whether seeking medical attention is worth it."
medicalschool,3e3bgv,letsplaycachecache,9,Tue Jul 21 18:12:30 2015 UTC,"This is precisely why the KevinMD article is ultimately counterproductive - it tries to frame what is a systemic deficiency (overbilling and extremely expensive medical services) as a doctors vs patients issue. Sure, it makes a nice read from the view of the doctors that can often be the recipient (unfairly) of patients' well-founded dismay and anger at the ridiculous bill, but it ultimately does us a disservice."
medicalschool,3e3bgv,syprox,4,Tue Jul 21 20:12:35 2015 UTC,"I think there's a pretty strong argument to be made that framing it the way it is actually ends up discouraging people from getting medical attention when they might need it.

medicalschool,3e4mh1,xi_mezmerize_ix,6,Tue Jul 21 22:51:58 2015 UTC,"OneNote is not a to-do list app, it is a full fledged note-taking app that syncs across all devices (Windows and OS X).   You can type notes, insert PDFs to mark-up, as well as write/draw/annotate with any supported tablet or phone. There is also an extensive sharing feature that allows viewing and collaboration with various users. Organizing is simple too, you can make individual notebooks for each subject, and then further organize within that notebook with three separate tiers. Plus, everything is timed/dated for ease of use. Best of all, it is free! Highly recommend you give it a shot.  My favorite feature is inserting a PDF, then right clicking and choosing ""set as background image"". This allows for the PPT slides/textbook to act as the page's background so you can type/annotate around it without accidentally moving any of the images.  I own all Apple products (MBP, iPhone & iPads), and OneNote is my favorite school-related app on all of my devices. If you are a heavy note taker (by that I mean writing with a stylus on your tablet), the Surface Pro is the way to go. The built in digitizer makes writing super smooth and accurate, unlike the iPad. If you don't write that much, I would stick with an iPad due to ease of use and compatibility with your Macbook. OneNote syncs seamlessly and automatically across all devices, regardless of their manufacturer.   Enjoy!"

The Macbook Pro (non retina) used to have a HDD (older hard drive technology) and the Macbook Air had SSD (newer hard drive technology) and so for a time the Air was faster in startup speed and file read/write. They both use SSD now so the MBP is actually faster.  As far as the difference in weight (for the 13 inch models of both), the Air is 3 pounds whereas the Pro retina is 3.5 pounds. Really negligible I would say, plus you get a gorgeous display with the Pro.  If you want my opinion as a pretty techy guy... I can bet money that Apple is going to get rid of the macbook air pretty soon and its just gonna have the Macbook pro retina and macbook (new 2015 that is ultra thin-- dont get this one).

medicalschool,3e1jni,smackythefrog,3,Tue Jul 21 16:41:37 2015 UTC,As an IMG: Appropriate dank meme
medicalschool,3e1jni,lordrohan,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"But charting outcomes does paint a pretty bleak picture for IMGs. In IM, for example, you have to get above 221 before more independent applications match than don't match. This only gets bleaker as Step 1 drops, to the point that an IMG with a 200 or 210 will have an extremely difficult time matching IM."
medicalschool,3e1jni,TibialisAnterior,3,Tue Jul 21 18:13:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It even looks a little bleaker when you consider the median score is a 228, but the spread is also wide. A 215 still puts you at the lower interquartile of those who matched in IM.  But I would hope that people with IMG status are more realistic and less careless when it comes to what they apply for. A 215 puts you above the median score for FM. I'd rather have a job than no job.   And as an aside: If we are being really honest, I personally didn't even know family med was so looked down up on until Reddit/SDN. I had always wanted to do that. But over the course of the last 2 years, I've started to think about aiming higher just because I feel like I should, not necessarily because I want any one particular specialty more."
medicalschool,3e1jni,secretman2therescue,2,Tue Jul 21 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"Your last paragraph.... It's a double edged sword for both parties. Many IMGs are deluded into shooting for specialties even US students have to have some top-notch applications to get, and feel IM and FM is ""below"" them. They usually get the rude awakening at some point and that's usually after a match cycle or two before they go report to the newspapers how Carib schools took their money but left them without a residency.  The more sensible IMGs know beforehand before going to the Carib, or elsewhere, what the numbers are looking like for them. Some score above the US avg. (~230) and some score lower (~210) but they understand what the implications are with scores on either end of the spectrum and they apply smart.   And IMGs aren't the only ones that have to apply smart, US students do too, but probably to a considerably less level than IMGs. But the fact is that if even some US students have to cut out those highly sought after specialties, that rule applies double to IMGs even if they're scoring around the same as said US grad.   So the smart IMGs study their asses off and get the score they get; for better or worse. But when they apply, they think long and hard about what is realistic or not.   I won't paint with a broad brush here, but most of the IMGs that do not match do not apply smart. But I feel that it's common sense, too. A 210 and looking at a university program for IM or above is not the going to go well for you. You can try. You should be applying to 150+ programs, and sure, 5 or so can be Hail Mary passes to the end zone at a uni program, but some of the not-so-smart IMGs don't understand that. ""Oooh, Hopkins has an IM program? Nice. I'll just kill the interview and tell them how far I've come from my 194 Step 1 and learned to study better."""

medicalschool,3e1jni,sgt_science,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:20 2015 UTC,"It's wrong for you, bc this data is the most current matching data, 2014 (or people who took step 1 in 2012). It may fluctuate by the time you apply for residency if you took step 1 this year, but not drastically. Best prediction for step 1 average in 2015 is somewhere between 230-235, yet again with a SD of ~20 which still means, at least 25% of people score below 215 at most (210 if average is 230). The only thing that has changed is the minimum passing score, so yes a 180 pass is not possible today, but we can assume that with a score between 194-204 you have a 75% chance in IM and >90% chance if your score is >204, which I agree is debateable but I feel reasonable, based off of the most current matching data which is included in my post. Still I find it highly unlikely that 25-30% of US graduating seniors will be entering FM or Psych in 2017 (those with scores between ~194-215). Did you even look at the most recent matching data? In 2014, anyone with a score above 210 had very near 100% chance to match into IM. That may increase to 215 in 5 years, but I honestly doubt it. Again, specialties ranked no greater than 1 is a much better predictor of whether you will match. Just look at the link I posted, or if you don't trust me google ""charting outcomes residency match""."

medicalschool,3e1gjd,Spicy_Masala,26,Tue Jul 21 05:47:29 2015 UTC,Spicy foods contain capsaicin.   Capsaicin acts on some receptor > depolarises cells > pain signals up C fibres to brain.   GIT is (largely) insensitive to pain. But in the anus you have that transitional epithelium and the cells become skin-like. I assume these are more pain sensitive or have more receptors.   This is my vague understanding as an MS2.

You can get portable USB monitors for a laptop, but even if it's just something you keep on your desk at home when you need to get work done, the extra space is invaluable.  Being able to have my lecture slide, the lecture recording, Anki, and a wikipedia page up all at the same time was a serious productivity boost.  Tabbing through programs on a single screen just feels so slow and archaic now.  Also, not sure what your school does, but mine gave us iPads.  If I had a choice, I would have sprung for a Surface Pro.  The digitizer is soooo much better for handwritten notes on top of your PPT slides.  Also, being able to write with your hand resting on the screen is a game changer (iPad has a work around ""hand rest"" function in notability, but it isn't that great and I never got used to avoiding the writing area with my pinky.  Many of my classmates love it, though, so you have to decide if it would be an issue for you).  Finally, I got to second the headphones opinion.  If you don't have a great study space at home, you're gonna be spending a lot of time in you school building surrounded by other students.  You don't need to go crazy expensive (don't bother with bose or beats), just find something over the ear and comfortable.

Step 2 CS - Created by a succubus to drain you wallet. Except they raised the pass rate, so you could also fail. And lose more money.  Ok the real question. Step 2 CK. Clinical Knowledge.  Here's the first example that comes to mind. Clinical vignette is midepigastric pain that bores to back in middle age drinker. Step 1 asks, what is the function of the elevated marker used to diagnose the condition? Ok so you know it's pancreatitis, lipase, digest fat. Done. Step 2, ""what is the next step in management?"" It might tell you that the U/S shows pancreatic inflammation"" (Which is annoying because you read the whole thing thinking...I know this...I know this...then they give you the punchline). Other examples include anything that has to do with a pap-smear or breast lump. Asthma. What type of fluid to give. Etc. Etc  Step 2 is a lot of Step 1, but a little less granular, and a lot more, ""now what?"" Often the diagnosis isn't possible, you just need to deal with it. (Basically every trauma question...fluid in the belly, low vitals, operate)  As for resources. Get UW. The Shelf exams are (probably the only thing on) your grades which you can control, so points matter. Use it all year. Good luck finding other sources for each rotation. It's a crap chute (shoot? Not sure the term). UW isn't even THAT good for the shelves/CK, but we make do.  I like OnlineMedEd+UW+Step Up to CK + Step Up to Medicine. I think that covers everything. Got 80% my first pass through UW (I think that's like 90th%), now getting 84% going through it after a reset (94th%).   There's a ton of discussion as to good resources, so search around. I will say like Step 1, the best formula is a top bank, a top book and time. I think 4 weeks is the sweet spot. Can't focus as much as I used to.  Good luck.

Great little hybrid device, it can load up class notes (given that your institution gives out electronic notes of some kind, be it pdf or powerpoint) and open them in OneNote, which is great for keeping class notes organized, annotating over/highlighting pdf files, etc.  Since mine wasn't a Pro I rarely physically wrote over my note files, but I typed up any notes not on the slide spoken by the professor on the side and highlighted or marked up important points.  It worked really well for me, and the non-pro series has Microsoft Office pre-installed which was nice.  You can also record lectures using OneNote, and then do an audio search for keywords (ex: ""I know the professor discussed hormones, but don't want to search through a 2 hour lecture."" you could then jump to the point where the speaker used the word ""hormones"").  Very handy device if you like typing your notes.  EDIT:  Should also add, the PDF reader is nice and I have all of my reference books loaded up on it."

It's an obvious answer, but does that mean this trend has to continue? Absolutely not. At the very least, there should be a movement to make state medical schools exempt from state-wide tuition increases.   Also: unless these programs are binding, they will not work.

medicalschool,3e0jhd,testoftests,2,Tue Jul 21 00:51:46 2015 UTC,"So, basically, if a patient is unstable you are pretty much always going to treat first, because if you waste time doing labs and scans they'll die or be severely impaired (esp in USMLE-land). If that treatment is ABC's, ACLS, emperic abx, or surgery, etc is dependent on the thing they are talking about. For a cancer example would be someone with spinal cord compression from metastasis - you give a giant dose of dex, because if you don't then they won't regain function, and the dex will buy you the time to confirm with imaging and get set up with nsgy to remove the met before the patient is paralyzed.   If a patient is stable it gets more complicated. If they are currently stable but look like they might be unstable in the very near future (ex: expanding hematoma in the neck), treat. If the disease is clinical in nature and has good empiric treatment, you can probably go ahead and treat. (ex: epiglottis, diptheria, impetigo, etc) If there is some question as to the diagnosis or the treatment will be dependent on the specific organism, then test.   After that, unless you know the guidelines for the disease they are talking about, just go with your gut. Usually the questions where they give you both a treatment choice and further testing choice there is either something glaringly obvious in the question that indicates the need for a specific test, or they so painstakingly spell it out for you that you can go ahead and treat. Exceptions may apply, but the majority will follow. If there is a specific example that is giving you trouble, why not post it and we can discuss?"
medicalschool,3e0jhd,hamm3rhand,2,Tue Jul 21 05:49:39 2015 UTC,"Great answer, I'd also add that fluid resuscitation is almost always the right answer, if it's an answer choice and hasn't already been done in the question stem. Similarly, always bolus with NS or LR to start."
medicalschool,3e0jhd,anriarer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:34:41 2015 UTC,"This is very helpful and hopefully in time, I can get use to that mode of thinking for USMLE-Shelf-Land questions.   As for an example, that's a good idea. Maybe others can give similar case vignettes where it might be a better one to the one I'm giving.  I came up on a few different questions presenting Aortic Dissection (you wouldn't be told this in the vignette).   Most questions would present with a non-specific race, usually male, asymmetric BP's of 180+-200+ Systolic BP on both upper limbs/arms (or just giving one very high single arm hypertensive urgency/emergency BP reading). Usually something where the patient presents with pain radiating to the back (or to a specific region of the central/upper back to a scapula for example).  There may or may not be other clinical presentations on respiration status but let's say, they are in some respiratory distress (e.g. tachypneic)  Initial imaging in the vignette would typically mention a widened mediastinum on CXR. Question would then ask, ""what's the next step"" -   Answer Options :    Beta Blocker (most commonly seen) CT Chest or TEE (most commonly seen) Angiography (sometimes given) MRI (sometimes given)   Some answers would either go for Beta Blocker and some would go for CT Chest or TEE - most wouldn't ask for Angiography unless it was an absolute confirmatory type of diagnosis but I don't think that was ever one I saw due to being invasive, acuity of patient setting to do other things which are quicker, cost. For MRI, I would say that isn't the best option due to cost (maybe a bit more to CT's cost) or time to do in where a CT or TEE could be done quicker.   So there, is it a delay to treat or delay to do an image study. Sometimes there was no other information in the question to make it clearer.  I did read somewhere there were two types of Aortic Dissections. Upper (from arch and above)/Lower (descending) - Type A/B respectively. Seems the Type B is treated with Beta Blockers to reduce BP whereas Type A is to surgery (If I recall, not 100% on that one).   I don't think there was anything else in the vignette from a clinical presentation to discern between Type A & Type B.  I would imagine to determine this, the CXR is not enough and so you should do the next step being a better imaging study to locate and be sure it's a dissection, if so is it Upper or Lower A or B type and not something else like a MI.  Alas, questions in that kind of description would go for the Beta Blocker. Others would go for CT Chest/TEE. I didn't want to single out a question source because I've been going through a mix of pretest, mksap and uworld questions and so they all had slight variations.  Maybe something else I completely did not see or learn about yet but I know for sure we can't just do a trigger reflex from Step 1-land and think Aortic Dissection - Beta Blocker - Boom!"
medicalschool,3e0jhd,hamm3rhand,2,Tue Jul 21 15:03:41 2015 UTC,"As you said, there are two types of aortic dissections, ascending and descending (a/b). You are correct in that ascending is a surgical emergency, where descending can usually be managed medically with B-Blockers.   There are some clues that may help distinguish an ascending, though they may not be given: a new onset aortic regurgitation murmur, or pericardial tamponade.  Severe hypertension is more common with descending.. None of those characteristics are enough to diagnose however, and so lets walk through.   For hemodynamically unstable patients with high clinical suspicion: Intubate, TEE, and go to surgery. Maybe do the TEE in the OR. TEE's are fast, though invasive, and equivalent to CT's for sensitivity of dissections.   Unfortunately for this example, for stable patients, its actually a bit gray. You need to confirm the diagnosis and determine if it is ascending, because even if they are stable they still need surgery. So diagnose first. But also you need to give B-blockers asap to reduce their heart rate and blood pressure to reduce the wall stress and prevent the dissection from increasing. So you would really do that probably at the same time in real life. On the test, I don't think they would ask you to choose between the two, but if they did then I would say test first, because if it's ascending they are going to the OR instead of the ICU.    They would probably need to have more information in there that would push you one way or the other if they gave both BB and TEE/CT, like saying ""best next step in diagnosis"" or ""best next step in treatment"" rather than just regular ""best next step in management.  Or perhaps showing symptoms of the increased BP like blurry vision, etc.   Either TEE or CT would be chosen over MRI (if you have time to sit through a 45 minute MRI you probably aren't going to be asked about it). Aortography is outdated and has been replaced almost everywhere with the above, and is only used when the imaging is either unavailable or inconclusive. TEE is preferred in unstable patients because it can be done quickly and bedside. CT would be better in stable patients as it is non-invasive, especially after-hours where it may be difficult to perform a TEE.   You are correct it's much more uncommon to be able to do reflex answers, but you will find that after a while you will get used to the diseases and know the next step by 'reflex'. It's a bit unfortunate the example you chose would be hard to delineate clear answers without the specific questions so we could say why they would put one or the other.   Also, keep in mind that if your resources aren't new, they might be operating off old guidelines. uworld is usually pretty up to date, but if you want a definitive answer most of the time uptodate.com will give it.   See this page for the aortic dissection management, for example"
medicalschool,3e0jhd,hamm3rhand,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you Dr. House hamm3rhand :) Here is one example from an set of printed cardiology notes passed down. I'm not sure of the source but it's from a few years ago. The question is below and the final prompt reads exactly as ""What is the next step?"" (no best next step in management/treatment/diagnosis"")  64 y/o woman presents w/ ripping chest pain radiating to her back w/ dyspnea & dysphagia. She has Hypertension that is being treated with HTCZ. Blood Pressure = 162/95 mmHg, Heart Rate 135, Respiratory Rate 29/min. She is in severe distress & has asymmetrical radial pulses. ECG shows LVH. CXR = Hazy aortic knob w/ a mediastinal width of 8.5cm. What is the next step?   a) Labetalol b) Nitroprusside c) Angiography d)Contrast Spiral CT e) Echocardiogram  Answer was noted as labetalol."
medicalschool,3e0jhd,hamm3rhand,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:18 2015 UTC,"I agree the answer is labatalol. It will help her whole picture, from BP to HR, which will hopefully help her pain and discomfort and give you time to make other plans.   Nitroprusside is an option if b-blockers don't control the BP enough, so not time for that yet.   Angiography we mentioned earlier, definitely not the first step.    Contrast spiral CT is close. the only reason that I would choose lebetalol over this is that it says she is in severe distress. Even though CT's don't take very long compared to MRI, you still have to be able to lay still for several minutes in order to get a good scan, and someone with the ripping chest pain and dyspnea of aortic dissection would most likely be unable to do that. If it had said IV morphine or other pain control followed by contrast spiral CT, that may be have been a better answer than labetalol, or at least equivalent in my mind.   Echocardiogram is too vague. Transthroacic echo cannot visualize the aorta well enough to make the diagnosis definitively, thus the use of the invasive TEE.  Without the distinction and since trans-throacic is by far more common of a test, this answer cannot be the correct one. (note, if this was a patient with a new onset murmur, just ""echo"" without a qualifier would be acceptable)"

In response to this line:  Being a US student, I don't know the entire pre-med process in the UK, but I did experience something somewhat similar after gaining admission.  At least in the US, especially as a non-trad, the length of the process can make admission seem like the goal.

medicalschool,3e052d,pagingdrpaige,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"I've literally never posted to reddit before but I think I can help a little. I was admitted to medical school in the states last February and after the initial high of being accepted, I too felt down for awhile... I started having these crazy nightmares that my acceptance was a mistake and was takin back, and with that during the day there was an overall meloncholy and sense of dread I didn't understand.  After a lot of instrospection and some research I decided that what I was feeling is something called imposter syndrome. It's the feeling that one became successful through luck or a mistake and that one does not necessarily deserve the success.  Going off of what adifferentjk said, the whole application process here in the states is a nightmare and I ended up seeing medical school as almost an unattainable goal, so when I got in I didn't feel good enough.  After I realized what I was feeling it was much easier to deal with, and as matriculation has gotten closer the whole thiing has started to seem more real, and the stress and aprehension has subsided and been replaced with excitement and happiness. I'm obviously not sure if this is what you are going through, but it sounded like it to me. During the awkward ""I'm in medical school, but it hasn't started yet"" time I suggest doing some introspection, remembering that you deserve to be in the position you are in rightnow - I don't think adcoms really make mistakes - and above all look in the mirror and remind yourself that it's real and that you are going to be a doctor!

A lot of medical students (more than you think) end up seeking mental health services at some point because the stress is unlike anything they've ever experienced.

Better to address these things early on before you begin what might be the most stressful period of your life, otherwise you may be looking at a mental health crisis later on."

The best way to improve your score in such a short time frame is to study your known weaknesses. For me, peds and Ob-gyn were long past by the time I took my first practice test. I studied them, and got 18 points higher on the next test I took (not counting NBME 7 which is an anomaly). I am guessing there are areas in which you are stronger and weaker. It is more fun to study the stuff you like and are good at, but much more productive to study the areas you dislike and are weaker at. You can make up much more ground in a short period of time improving on weak areas than you can rounding out strong ones."

Student loans are plentiful, easy to get, can't be cleared in bankruptcy and are secured upwards of 70% from default. Aside from the schools (which obviously love the extra funds), loan servicers, the law firms employed by the servicers, the banks and firms that employ the servicers, the collections agencies employed by the firms that buy the cheap debt, and countless others form a massive industry that all stand to gain as tuition rises. Everybody is happier that tuition is higher. Everybody except you.      As for why 'the government' allows it.. why did the government allow every other bubble industry? You need to stop seeing the government as this big thing that makes logical, conscious decisions. The government is just a bunch of people. 535 congress people, 9 justices, and the Executive staff. All but 9 of whom are constantly trying to get reelected. Campaigns take astounding amounts of money.      A single 30-second tv ad costs $350,000. So when a representative from any of those countless companies offers you $25,000 for your campaign (money that you need to keep your job and feed your family) and all you have to do is say the word 'yes' instead of 'no' on Tuesday afternoon's vote, are you really going to throw that money away? Are you going to sacrifice your own job to try and make some minor change that may or may not payoff at all and certainly won't payoff in any tangible way for you? Of course not."

There's no need based aid; as broken as that system is, at least it tries. Someone from a family of 200k/year willing to help fund their education is more likely to pursue medicine than someone from a family who can't or won't help with tuition.

That's actually not unique to medical education - there are quite a number of universities that are historically black schools. However it's deliciously ironic that they depend quite heavily on financing from white intellectuals and have in many cases succumbed to influence from white leadership that may or may not have any stake in the communities these institutions purport to serve. You can see where I'm going with this, I hope.  It's kind of interesting that all of this social justice bullshit was started by a Belgian King named Leopold, who used it as a cover to reinvigorate the African slave trade. 2 centuries later and here we are.

EDIT: Because why not, http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=182528, a study showing that increase in student diversity in a school's student population correlated positively with feeling ready to work with minority populations.    Worth noting is the context line, from 2008 which reads ""Many medical schools assert that a racially and ethnically diverse student body is an important element in educating physicians to meet the needs of a diverse society. However, there is limited evidence addressing the educational effects of student body racial diversity.""  The feeling/clamoring for the need for increased diversity in medical education was apparently enough in 2008 that it lead to studies and publications.  I don't know what more proof you need that this has been long established."
medicalschool,3dx0as,IAmA_Kitty_AMA,0,Mon Jul 20 18:59:28 2015 UTC,I see the push but I dont really see the need. Look at this study http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1466852/ . Only the patients that had strong feelings about discrimination in medicine prefered a racially similar physician. The grand majority didnt care. That study you linked measured thier percieved readiness but did it actually help? This might be anecdotal evidence but many of my friends and family (im hispanic) prefer white physicians because they know URM's get an unfair advantage to get into medical school and might not be as competitive as others.
medicalschool,3dx0as,dumbms1,3,Mon Jul 20 19:20:28 2015 UTC,"I linked the study specifically for the year and the context line, not because of the study itself.  You implied that there was no explicit clamor/desire for diversity and I wanted to show that it was false dating back at least 8 years (data is roughly 10 years old).  Regarding your study, while the minority, it states that 22% and 33% of black and hispanic patients preferred their doctors to be the same race as themselves however an even smaller minority preferred a different race (13% and 19% respectively).  Likewise, among the entire population of the races, the average belief of racial descrimination implicit in the health care system was more than 50% (greater than 10 out of a scale from 0-21, see Table 1).    I don't read this as a study saying that not a lot of people require a doctor of their own race, but rather that almost all minorities think there are racial issues within the system.  I consider that alone to be a need to push for more diversity."

Which completely ignores the fact that level of preparedness is very very highly correlated with socio-economic status which is highly correlated with race.  Look at the numbers.    When the average black household wealth is $11,000 it gets hard to afford the bootstraps needed to pull yourself up to the point where you are as good of a student as privileged students.  Studies on summer learning loss show that it accounts for almost all of the achievement gap between high and low income students, AND that students with high loss (the poor kids,) gained at a faster rate during the year than other groups.  Is affirmative action a perfect solution?  Absolutely not, students will be less prepared and will have to work harder to not wash out, however at some point you have to work with what is actually possible because the alternative of doing nothing is ridiculous."

My SO is British and was complaining how university costs went up from £3000 to £9000, which albeit is a huge jump, but that's it, that's all you pay for med school a year (except for some private schools). To be honest, I know more and more people who are looking elsewhere for school, i.e. In other countries with much cheaper tuition, the same, if not more, possibilities and great quality of life. To add insult to injury, it doesn't help that US graduate federal loan interest rates were doubled as well (cheapest you can get is 6.8%).   I believe this will seriously affect the medical profession. People still have the impression that doctors are wealthy and should be payed less in the name of social justice. That of which culminated in the income tax of 39.5% on a salary of $250k+.   I agree with OP that this leads to a decreased interest or incentive to become a doctor, not that it is all about the money, but if you have the burden of caring for peoples' lives, you don't want the added burden of living paycheck to paycheck.   This is why I know more and more young doctors (typically with young families) that are moving to the Middle East (e.g. Dubai and Doha) for a better opportunity because their financial burdens are too high. And I think the reason  this has persisted so long is because so many people in the general public are unaware, when I share the facts you mentioned of tuition costs, everyone is shocked.

The salary they pay you is already after all of the other things are taken into account. As for the need of specialists, I'm not sure and can ask around.   Eastern Europe is wonderful and the cost of living is astounding (check out Poland!), but I wouldn't recommend it if you still has this astronomical debt of US med school looming over your head as your pay wouldn't be enough to pay it off."

medicalschool,3dx0as,lf11,4,Mon Jul 20 13:47:21 2015 UTC,"It also means that doctors will continue to come from wealthy families.   I think this is more a function of financial literacy than the amount of debt, at least for the time being. Say for example the upper end of indebtedness - in the ballpark of $500k. Now at 7% interest, that's about $4,000/month to pay off in 20 years. If you go with IBR at 15% of AGI, and figure an adjusted income of $125,000 (i.e. a low paying specialty), you're paying about $1600/month. That won't even meet the interest payments. You'll have a tax bill of several hundred thousand dollars after 20 years when the loan gets forgiven. I don't think interest capitalizes on the loan but I think you still have to pay taxes on the hypothetical amount given, which would mean you have to save an extra $880/mo to pay that eventual bill. Altogether about $2500/mo. So if your unadjusted income was 150k, in effect you're making 120k. Not great considering you've foregone 4 years (med school) of income and then another 3 in residency where you're severely underpaid. But it's still more than what most people are making after 7 years in their career. Should be very attractive to someone from a low income family, but the loan scares people off. Now if you're in a subspecialty and take advantage of all the tricks to lower your AGI, you are coming out way ahead. The loan is just an investment at that point"

Also, that tax bill on loan forgiveness depends on where you work for those 10 years."

Very true, and it's not helped by the stigma in academia against all things business-related.   Also, that tax bill on loan forgiveness depends on where you work for those 10 years.   AFAIK 20 year forgiveness is across the board but has taxes. the 10 year is always tax free I'm assuming you're referring to PSLF?"
medicalschool,3dx0as,pancakees,3,Mon Jul 20 14:29:44 2015 UTC,"Two forces seem to be pushing tuition ever higher while the only foreseeable counter force hasn't occurred yet.  First, with the advent of income based loan repayment the total principal of the loan no longer matters. $400k is the same as $750k when your payments are based on your ability to pay.  Second, some calculations show that the net present value of a medical education is still a good investment as long as it is below $183k/yr. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20563942  The main driver for change will probably be in 2017 when the first of the PSLF bunch comes in. Then and only then will the massive medical school debt become a problem for people other than doctors.   However that last counter point can be eliminated by placing a cap on loan forgiveness and extending the repayment length to 40 years instead of 20-25 years."
medicalschool,3dx0as,Issimmo,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:39:59 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, PSLF is 10 years of payments then all debt forgiven. I think IBR and PAYE is 25 years then all debt forgiven. You can use PSLF and IBR/ PAYE simultaneously."
medicalschool,3dx0as,blargy_,4,Mon Jul 20 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"It's a gamble, though. It's only a matter of time until budget reforms leave you holding the bill--after you've made life decisions about where to practice, as well as loan repayment at a higher rate.   Oh, and that tax bill for the extra $200k+ ""income"" you're going to get when your loans are forgiven, payable to the IRS ASAP.  If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is."
medicalschool,3dx0as,count_zero11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:11 2015 UTC,"That is why PSLF will push the medical student debt question to the forefront. The funds for forgiving those loans will have to be accounted for elsewhere in the government's budget. Right now the debt is only the student's problem, but starting in 2017 it can be transferred after 10 years."
medicalschool,3dx0as,Issimmo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:34 2015 UTC,"If the government wants to solve this ""shortage"" issue that always gets tossed around I think it be in their interest to provide incentives for people to practice family med/psych/hospitalist in areas no on wants to practice in. Or they can just replace docs with mid level providers, which will probably be better for their pockets."
medicalschool,3dx0as,StoicElephant,0,Mon Jul 20 22:13:43 2015 UTC,"Except, you can't replace doctors with midlevels. They just don't know enough."
medicalschool,3dx0as,xi_mezmerize_ix,3,Tue Jul 21 00:00:14 2015 UTC,"Glad I'm doing an MD/PhD program for a variety of reasons, but the lack of debt when I get out is a major plus. A lot of people rag on me for the fact that I'll be in school for ""so long"" when I can be out earlier as an MD-only and ""paying off my loans earlier"". I'd rather spend 3-4 years doing research than have the burden of loan repayments and massive debt hanging over my head during the decade I am trying to establish a career, life, and family. I don't plan on becoming a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, so the odds of me paying off medical school loans in the same time it will take me to do a PhD is highly unlikely."
medicalschool,3dx0as,AC130Gunner,2,Mon Jul 20 22:02:19 2015 UTC,"It depends on the school, but doing a 3-4 year PhD will still cause you to lose money in the long run. Suppose your MD years are $40k/year. You are getting $40k waived + $30k stipend for 4 years (about $210k). Then you receive the graduate school stipend for 3-4 years (about $90-120k), so you could say you gain about $300k-420k for 7 or 8 years. If you just did the MD program you would lose $160k with tuition but have 3 to 4 more years to practice as an MD. Those are years with salary from $200k-$300k or perhaps more. This route would net you about $440k to about $1mil or more in the long run.  Essentially many MD/PhD students are losing between $100k to $600k or more depending on the situation. (I don't actually know what the average tuition is at schools with MD/PhD programs, so don't quote me on this.) The loss is even greater if its a state school with cheaper tuition. I know there are schools that allow for a 2 year PhD, so it does work out better for these students. Of course the value of being able to do research in the field you want at a good academic center might be priceless, so this could easily be worth it for many people. It just doesn't come without some sacrifices, because in addition the years and salary lost with training, most likely spending significant time in research running a lab will lower your salary in subsequent years."
medicalschool,3dx0as,xi_mezmerize_ix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:36 2015 UTC,"Putting it in a strict vacuum like that is a bit different from reality though. You have to factor in living costs, choice of specialty, location of practice, the interest rate on the loan, the repayment timeline, tax brackets, the burden of the loan on your mental well-being, more career options, potentially better residency placement, etc. All of these things are hard to predict before and during medical school.   Also, I'm going to an OOS medical school, so my tuition would be around $70k/year."

Also, I'm only 23, so I'll be doing residency when I'm around 30-31, which is not too bad considering that I took 2 years off after college, as well as the fact that the average matriculant is 24 (residency at 28-29)."

They did this w/o any prompting or request from me and without it, I'm not sure I would have gotten in. I know that's not helpful to you, necessarily, but I say that to say this- Recommendation letters from a doctor will go a very long way towards getting you in and getting to know people in the field can only pay dividends. I received a number of other unquantifiable benefits from these connections, from mentorship to interview coaching. As I'm sure you'll find, people will want to help you if they believe you to be a value to the medical community.  During my interview, I made a conscious decision to avoid buzzwords and to have a few stories in my back pocket which demonstrate those qualities which I believed were hallmarks of good physicians, namely compassion, humility, and work ethic. I made an effort to be succinct and forthcoming, while trying not to overshare.  As a non-trad, you'll have a wealth of different experience from which to draw, and you shouldn't be afraid to use them. You'll have 'real world' examples, which will serve as a strong counter balance to the thousands of ""we had a team work exercise in our biology club"" stories that I believe many direct admits are forced to offer.  But the best advice I can give is this: Be straight-forward. Be honest. and be yourself. Speak to your interviewer as you would a patient who is choosing whether or not they want you as a their doctor, because that's exactly what's happening."
medicalschool,3dtr9i,blisteredeyelids,14,Sun Jul 19 21:16:30 2015 UTC,"Don't give in. I was diagnosed with UC 2 months before graduating from med school. It went into remission right away, then as soon as I started orientation for residency last month it flared up like crazy. The past six weeks have been unbelievably hard, yes. I got through orientation week but then got so sick that on my very first day of internship I ended up in the ED of my new hospital. I spent 7 days in the hospital, then ended up missing another week to recover some more at home. Last week I finally felt well enough to go back to work. It's been rough, but not impossible. I know what you're going through. I lost a total of almost 25 lbs in the past 6 weeks (and I'm not a big guy) from simply not being able to eat, which I think I'm finally starting to regain a few pounds. I'm still not totally controlled; in fact I'm sitting on the toilet for the 4th time this AM writing this. I've been on prednisone for almost 6 weeks and the side effects of that starting to hit. But I am getting better, slowly. Through it all I refuse to give up- I will not let this disease disable me. My story may not be the most encouraging but I want you to know that you're not alone, and that it can and will get better. If you need time to recover then take it- you can always pick it back up in a few weeks. UC is an ugly disease but it is by no means the end."

medicalschool,3dtr9i,BMEJoshua,4,Sun Jul 19 13:49:23 2015 UTC,"Hey. You're handling it better than anyone could expect.  First, GET BETTER. Start by talking to the dean and getting yourself more time, whatever that means.  Then, rest. Do what you must, but rest.  Finally, return, and finish what you began quite well.  Good luck."
medicalschool,3dtr9i,zebrake2010,4,Sun Jul 19 14:30:07 2015 UTC,"Hey OP, I was diagnosed with Crohn's halfway through my junior year of college after having gone through my whole fall semester crapping constantly, bleeding out of my ass, and wondering what the hell was going on with my body. This whole last year between end of college and med school, while I've been applying to med school, I was in remission without any sort of medical management and then at the beginning of July, out of the blue I'm flaring up again and not responding to meds yet, and I start med school in less than a month. So I get where you're coming from - as soon as I read ""going to the toilet 12 times a day,"" I knew where your story was headed.  I know how it feels when you just want to be yourself and do the things you want to do and you can't because your own body is undermining you, for no reason. I know how how exhausting it is to have to go through all of this stuff to try to get better and then how frustrating it is to just keep not getting better.  Here's the thing, though. Most people who become doctors haven't had to deal with chronic or life threatening illness (they may later in life, but probably not before becoming a doctor or early in their careers). You have, and that gives you a perspective on patients and what it's like to be a patient that I don't think can be taught, and I think it will help you in how you interact with and treat patients. You're clearly a smart guy/gal, you're obviously capable of doing the work (and doing it well), and you seem to really enjoy medicine - you would probably do really well and be a great doctor if only your body wasn't undermining you.  I don't think you should give up, and I certainly don't think you're a failure. You are not a failure for having poor health due to a condition that is almost entirely out of your control. Yeah, it sounds like you're having a loss of motivation, and you know what? I don't blame you! You're sick, dude, and that wears on you mentally and physically.  You gotta get better (I know, easier said than done). There's nothing wrong with taking a year off, and there's nothing wrong with being ""three years behind."" Behind what? Behind the kids that go directly from college to med school? Plenty of people now take time off before going to med school, and three years is not uncommon. If you can get healthy, get your disease managed so that when it flares up again (because let's be honest, it'll probably be a matter of when, not if) you know how to handle it, a year is nothing in the grand scheme of things. It may feel like a long time while you're in it, but let me tell you as someone who just took a year off from school, if you're keeping busy it actually goes pretty fast. And if you're healthy at the end of it, it's so, so worth it.  I think you should try to take your exams and finish out this year, and then work with your school to set up a year leave of absence. If I'm reading your post right, if you finish out this year you'll have finished M2, and taking a break between M2 and M3 is the best time to do it if you need to do it. And I think you do need to do it. It sounds like your UC is pretty bad and isn't really managed yet, and being in med school with all the stress and constant pressure of things to do and be on top of isn't helping. Just based off of what you've said in your OP, it does sound like the inflammation in your colon got pretty severe in the months before you were diagnosed and it may have been bad enough to have done damage that you can't really fix with steroids. Hopefully, you have a good gastroenterologist that you like and trust, and you should maybe talk to your GE about a colectomy.  Whatever you do, don't give up, and remember that you've had to go through some serious shit. Maybe you can't cope with this illness and this year, but I know you could cope with each individually, and you just need to give yourself the opportunity to do so."
medicalschool,3dtr9i,eeliahs,3,Sun Jul 19 17:50:01 2015 UTC,"Hey man, my mom has UC so I've seen a lot of what you've described and I can imagine how difficult it is, physically as well as mentally/emotionally. But look at you- top 5% in a competitive field that attracts some of the brightest and most motivated students around. You have gifts that are worth sharing with the world. ""all I could do is study and focus on my academics because I enjoyed it: it was the only thing that fulfilled me."" It'll be hard giving up this part of your identity right now. But I want to echo everyone else's comments; take the time off to get healthier. Maybe you will never be 100% ok again, but I bet you can find a way to become healthy enough to do the things you enjoy. You are not a failure. You are one tough MFer. There is virtue in persevering through suffering. Through your perseverance you can inspire others going through similar struggles, and that alone would be worth it. Good luck."

I was diagnosed with UC at the start of my penultimate year and have been pretty unstable since then. Probably not as bad as you (I've always been steroid responsive), but I've had about 6 flare ups since then and I know exactly how much energy it can suck out of you. I sat my end of 4th year exams during a flare and came extremely close to shitting myself in the psych OSCE, I have probably been at the absolute outer limit of the time you're allowed to be off sick without actually taking a leave of absence, I was hospitalised with thiopurine induced pancreatitis which came on during a seminar, and last week I graduated from medical school.   You are not a failure for being ill, and if it takes another year off to try to get well before you can go back to work, then that's what it takes."

It's invaluable for when you're caring for a patient who wants to give up.  Take a break, get healthy, go back when you're stronger and remember this awful experience. At least it will have been worth something.  I'd listen to you give a talk or read your paper on how it feels to be mismanaged. The person who under managed you sees > 15 pts/day. You, as patient, have one life that's being severely screwed up every hour of every day - a critical thing to remember in pt care. Everything matters. You've not only learned that, you can teach it."

medicalschool,3dtr9i,monchiz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:42:52 2015 UTC,"Two gap years is nothing. I took six gap years and two of those years were spent getting diagnosed with UC, failing medical treatment, and having a total colectomy and ileal pouch surgery (j-pouch).  I was working a relatively easy 40 hour/week kind of corporate job when I was diagnosed and trying medical treatments and it was incredibly hard. I was even able to work from home often and it still kicked my ass. I can't imagine doing medical school in an uncontrolled flare.  Do not make any permanent decisions about your career while your disease is uncontrolled. I can't stress this enough. UC is a mindfuck. A therapist told me I had PTSD from my experience being ill (and incontinent, hospitalized, etc). The worst thing you could do right now is try to soldier on under the assumption that graduating late is the end of the world.  Take a leave of absence. Take a year to get your disease under control. Seriously investigate surgical options -- it's not a panacea but I'm no longer immunosuppressed and my fear of ""the next flare"" is greatly reduced. I had to have three surgeries because of longterm steroid therapy and malnutrition at the time of my colectomy and it was still only seven months from the first surgery to my return to work.   When your health has returned you can go back to school and give it your all. It will be so much better to graduate a year or two ""late"" (PS still several years earlier than I will) in good health and with a good record than to muddle and struggle through.  Incontinence and 12+ BMs per day is severe UC. Frankly I'm shocked that your GI and your school administrators haven't been more vehement about your taking time off. When I finally admitted that I couldn't work anymore (I was at the point of taking conference calls while sitting on the toilet) my GI told me she couldn't believe I had kept working as long as I did.  Best of luck, please feel free to get in touch if you want to talk about anything."

medicalschool,3dtr9i,stargrunt6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:58:54 2015 UTC,"It's all up to you. If you want to remain in med school then I would say go for it. But if you choose a different path, no one is stopping you. Something that a lot of people forget is to make sure you take care of yourself. When you know how to take care of yourself only then can you take care of others.  Personally, I would say go and give it a shot if you can but if it proves too much for you then see if you can work something out with your medical school. If not, then reevaluate your current situation. First thing is to approach your support network, like family and such, to get their opinions on your current situation but DON'T blindly follow their suggestions. Try to remember why you chose medicine, and see if you are still passionate enough to remain in the profession/field. Seeing as you got into med school means you have the potential to become a doc and are more than deserving unless you are lazy/procrastinate/scrape by and fine with it. Another alternative too is finding something that can take your mind off stress pertaining to schoolwork and your condition, try looking into exercising or other hobbies.  You're not a failure, don't think less of yourself; all you need is direction.   TLDR; Just think about it, and remember why you want to go into medicine. Try to get support from friends and family, and take your mind off stress and problems by exercising or your hobbies."

medicalschool,3du6ft,Dr_Takotsubo,5,Sun Jul 19 16:54:02 2015 UTC,"Hard question.   Is your situation such that you can visit very rarely? If so, there's wisdom in telling you to save it for a weekend when she's going to be more free.   If you can be there more often and it's important to you that you be there to support her? Tell her that. Explain your reasons and go from there."

For what it's worth, they try to make a big deal out of it but I found it frankly embarrassing.  I'm not a doctor, I won't be a doctor for years to come, and I don't want to wear a white coat until I am one.  Putting a white coat on me in front a huge crowd is frankly a very disturbing experience, and I felt more like an imposter than anything else.  I felt like that going into the ceremony (told my family not to come, they didn't come) and I wondered if I would feel different about the ceremony after.  I didn't.

Both my parents are going and that's good enough for me. If you want to go for you I doubt she'd be mad at you, but similar to myself, I wouldn't demand  or expect that anyone go extremely far out of their way to come to it.

medicalschool,3du6ft,mawbles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:18:25 2015 UTC,Don't go. I'm betting they are only allowed two guests anyway and the extra room is because they know people will break this rule and bring more.... leading to overcrowding and many parents or spouses not being in the same room during the ceremony. At mine even the extra room was filled because people didn't just stick to 2.

Got a couple of recommendations, but I think the biggest thing you can do to help yourself out is to get a mentor. Most cis LGB folk aren't really going to understand quite well enough.  I only know of one public account of transitioning while being a physician, and that's Dr Becky's website. I think she transitioned back in the 1990s. She had a really, really hard transition in the field. I think people are generally more accepting these days. Dr Marci Bowers is also pretty open about transitioning while being an OB/GYN. I don't know of any trans masculine physicians though.  I know at my school we do regularly talk about trans issues and would bend over backwards to help out a trans student. I hope your school is the same.   First -- if you can afford it, join WPATH. They have a mailing list that ought to be helpful and mentors can hopefully come out of the woodwork for you. Also consider joining GLMA, and your local LGBT or trans organizations. If you identify as female and bisexual/lesbian, Women in Medicine might be another option but I haven't vetted them myself yet for trans-friendliness.  Second -- get the care you need and take care of yourself! This probably will require going outside your uni. I would not trust a uni without some backup. Do you have a provider or a therapist yet? If not and if you're lost, feel free to PM me or come on over to /r/transhealth to get some assistance.  Third -- consider getting in touch directly with ""out"" trans physicians/surgeons. Many physicians involved in trans health are trans themselves but not all. Again -- holler, and I'll try to help. :)  Please do feel free to send me a PM -- depending on where you are I can probably point you toward the nearest good organizations. My roots are California based, but I know some organizations all over. If I can help in any way, holler. :)  And -- good luck. I hope you find the resources you need, and that your transition is a smooth one."

Your main priority right now is figuring out where you went wrong and fixing it. Find out what your school's policy is on you taking time off to study - sometimes you can just push back rotations by a month or two, sometimes you have to defer for a year.  EM is kind of middle of the road as far as competitiveness. The nice thing about failing is you have a chance to retake the test and get a good score, where as someone who barely passes is stuck with what they get. Study your ass off, then do it again for Step 2. Personality means a lot in the DO world, so having a good attitude and a good work ethic during your auditions will go a long way. You will need a back up plan though, so I would suggest also applying to something less competitive like family medicine and ranking them lower when the time comes.  Sorry for the rambling - it's 3 am and I'm on call."

Figure out what went wrong or pay someone to do it for you. COMLEX is not the USMLE so don't use USMLE prep for COMLEX boards. There are plenty of boards prep courses that are tailored for COMLEX. Some send you a study schedule and books. Some have live lectures. Some are private tutors. Do not expect your school to offer much help.   Take some time to gather your thoughts, calm down, and get into a board prep mode again. It might take a couple weeks and that is okay. You will be removed from rotations and that is okay. You will be anywhere from slightly off cycle to an entire year behind your current class and that is okay. Everything will be okay :)"

There's another one run by some SDN members which are no strangers to the public eye like Pholston aka Michael Mehlman. This is all public information as posted on their about page for their business and so not anonymous info. I'm sure many of you have read and seen his stuff. That member has helped a lot of people genuinely and no diss to them because they all worked very hard to be where they are, but you'll notice patterns of how some members on SDN are posting things.   These people all play the slow game on the forums and post a lot with experiences. There are many others on SDN who sneakily do this.  You know what Pholston's company pricing starts at? $250/hour for USMLE tutoring?  http://residentsmedical.com/usmle-pricing  http://residentsmedical.com/about  **If that's not alarming, see their other ridiculous price plans which range from :   $5000 for 20 hours personal $5000 group package $8500 40 hours $12000 unlimited**  Specials included in some of the bundles are all the books you need at the higher packages. Lol, I mean come on - you can buy those for a fraction used or even new...  I mean, wtf - what is so special that can't be found on your own searches or for free on the millions of other places.  Just posting this so people are aware. Yeah, those people worked really hard and it's a business option for them but there's a lot of undertone and sneakiness in how a lot of these things are done and who they target.  That group created a new SDN account and post yesterday.   http://forums.studentdoctor.net/threads/free-webinar-q-a-today-4pm-pst-with-michael-mehlman-regarding-step-1.1149591/  So they will offer those free webinars and then give a lot of common information. Then, you'll get sucked into the marketing loop and spend all that money after. I'm not saying it won't help those that need hand-held direction but if those are the prices for just USMLE things, think of the pricing on the other stuff. It's a networked scheme of banking on students, probably from overseas and what not.  Tutors should be paid but when you start tiered pricing like this, what justifications are there that you can't find elsewhere that is available for free or even from the many helpful people throughout the medical communities?"

Of course you can pay off 500k of loans on a 200k salary. But it might take 4-5 extra years of lifestyle sacrifice, retirement saving sacrifice, saving for your kids college being sacrificed, etc etc to get it done versus if you were getting paid more.

If lectures are optional, figure out if staying home and listening is better for you (it was much better for me). Dont buy all of the crazy books your professors recommend, you probably dont need them. Dont take everything so seriously, sure its medical school, but dont kill yourself over it. You will make mistakes, you will fuck up, you will feel stupid, you probably wont be the top of your class. You know what? that's all OK."

Netter's is the go to for what things should look like, and is really good for learning where things are.

I was luckily able to find a group of friends who are friendly type-B, non-neurotic people. WE NEVER COMPARE OURSELVES TO EACH OTHER.  It's done wonders for my mental health compared to undergrad where all the premeds psyched each other out before tests and wanted to talk about grades 24/7.   Also, understand that there is more to life than med school. Go out and enjoy town, do recreational things, exercise, talk to family and friends outside of medicine, take time off during the weekends and day when you can. You need to take care of yourself in order to stay sane the next 4 years.  Do not cram for tests. Make sure you read your emails and fill out administrative paperwork on time. Join lots of interest groups and clubs because they often hold lunch & evening events where you can network with doctors, listen to interesting lectures and get free food all at the same time. Shadow a lot of doctors in specialties that you might not get exposed to in your rotations later on. Find out which cafeterias have the best food and which bathrooms are the cleanest. Upperclassmen are usually your best resource on how to do well on your exams, but talk to multiple upperclassmen because not all of their experiences were the same. Realize that what your professors expect you to know for exams isn't always high-yield for boards and they won't cover everything, it's your responsibility to fill in those gaps. Use /r/medicalschool's search function and wiki to find good resources for different subjects. Get a good foundation of knowledge your first year because everything will build upon it. Find out who to go to if your aren't doing well in class whether it's the professor, a learning counselor, or the Deans.  Form good study habits early so that you don't have to form habits after doing poorly on your first exams. Keep an open mind about what specialty you want to do, even if you're dead-set on something right now. You never know what you might like in the future as your interests and priorities might change. Because of this, always strive to do well in your classes and aim to do well on your board exams so that you don't limit your opportunities down the road."

medicalschool,3drdc4,helpful_grey,3,Sat Jul 18 21:15:27 2015 UTC,"Well that's the thing with gyn onc-- their patients to them can't be that dehumanized because they see them in the clinic so often, and then in the OR, and they manage their chemo, and they see them after for follow up. ICU docs can be more OK with their patients dying because the acuity was already so high before they got there. Surgeons also don't have as much time to build up long term rapports, but gyn oncs have hard cases (and easier ones) from beginning to end, and depending on their scope they could have patients for decades if they're practicing enough gyn. The personalities in the field respond to that in different ways I think..."

I'm sure it's annoying to deal with and it doesn't surprise me that the field in general might have a bit of a chip on its shoulder.   For what it's worth, I think gynonc has very interesting pathology and the chemo thing is a huge draw if you're interested in oncology.

It's basically summed up best by one of my OBGYN registrars ""You have to be a super surgeon to go there."" It's a great field if you're a keen surgeon, but as others have said you need to be ok with being a run of the mill OBGYN as well. It's hard to get in and a really, REALLY long road to take (my GynaeOnc sat me down and tried to talk me out of it). However it's also a very interesting and rewarding field. My country has a shortage of GynaeOncologists so I've been heavily pushed towards it by my superiors on my OBGYN placement, but I'm still not sure if I could hack it.

If you are really interested I'd recommend talking to a career advisor in your school and/or finding gyn onc docs at your hospital to shadow (or do research with if you're really looking to get somewhere).

medicalschool,3dqtnz,icedoverfire,12,Sat Jul 18 15:50:43 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you are trying to treat. The pharmacologic properties are very different. Ampicillin is poorly absorbed and doesn't reach a good concentration in the blood. However, it is concentrated very well in the kidneys, so, there's your UTI indication with IV amp. And since it is poorly absorbed, that means it'll stay in the GI system longer. So there is your indication for certain GI pathogens and PO amp."
medicalschool,3dqtnz,3MinuteHero,2,Sat Jul 18 17:38:45 2015 UTC,Typically ampicillin-sulbactam (Unasyn) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) are used interchangeably.  Granted Unasyn is the IV formulation while Augmentin is given via the oral route.  I've used Unasyn is patients with aspiration pneumonia while in the hospital then transitioned to Augmentin once they're discharged from the hospital.  Does that answer your question?  My mnemonic for ampicillin as the IV form is ampIVicillin whereas for amoxicillin is amOxicillin (O = oral).  Not sure about the rest of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics of these two aminopenicillins.

If there was no UW, the exam averages would probably be 10-20 points lower than they are right now, with passing being at the lower threshold it once was.  The hatred I have for attendings from the ""good old days"" where they masturbated over a tenth of the material we have to learn now while working 100+ hour workweeks and paying less for their entire medical education and a downpayment on their house than we pay for one fucking year of school now is uncontrollable."

I used only uworld to study for 3rd year shelves and did fine, so no worries with contrasting styles.   I just cannot study from textbooks. Space out, can't recall. I need a contextual scenario, and then I remember very well. Medicine is about decisions, particularly the decisions that Step 2 is preparing you for: i.e. being an intern. As an intern, you need to rule out life threats and choose the best test. You need to know when to call the OR team in at 3am; the attending can deal with the minutiae of the plan. It seems there is no book that really addresses those key decision points the way uworld does.  So, in conclusion, score would be lower without uworld."
medicalschool,3dr0py,jvttlus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:47:08 2015 UTC,"Many medical students can easily pass the STEP without UWorld or FirstAid for that matter.  My school gives a CBSE exam at the end of the 2nd year as a way of comparing performance between classes and monitoring the curriculum (at least that is what I think they use it for). Anyways, many people, myself included (I did not use FirstAid the first two years) did manage to meet the minimum passing criteria for STEP 1 based on the extrapolation. Anyways, what I think UWorld does is teach you pattern recognition. Human have evolved to recognize patterns in the environment rather than remembering small details. Take driving for example, you can easily get to a place you've been to before without knowing the street names.  Anyways, that is what I think UWorld is all about, there a finite number of ways to write a question, you can disguise any question with a number of obscure details, but if you recognize the underlying pattern then it makes it easier to answer the question.  To answer your question, scores would be significantly lower without resources like UWorld.  My guess is anywhere from 15-20 points lower."

Maybe not the theory behind what you're doing, but in practice it just sucks. The FM people I worked with third year worked harder than most other attendings I saw throughout the year, and they probably got paid the least. On top of that, the work they are doing is mind-numbingly boring and so far removed from actual medicine that they seem to operate as social workers more often than highly trained physicians.  Unless deep down in your heart you want to be a primary care doctor, there is absolutely no motivation to go into the field -- and if you have a large burden of debt it is a stupid financial decision as well."

I went to community college for two years and then transferred to a four-year university. I remember going to college and saying to myself ""look at these privileged, spoiled elitists brats."" I was shocked to see students driving BMWs, talking about their doctor/lawyer parents, etc.  I took a fairly long time off between undergrad and med school. In that time, I realized that I really had no basis for judging those people. They may have come from a wealthy background, but that was not their choice, either. I would drive a BMW if my parents bought me one. I became friends with someone from a wealthy background, who had actually suffered a great deal of adversity in his own life.   When I came to medical school, I again saw people from a very different background than me, but my perspective had changed. Taking the time to get to know people in my class, there are truly only a handful that I would consider to be elitist or otherwise have their background reflect poorly on them. So, when I see posts like this, I wonder how old OP is and if this attitude is just a reflection of exposure to a new, different group of people, and feeling isolated from them.  Someone else said that deep down, people are the same, and I really believe this is true."

Both of his parents are doctors at the school. I couldn't fathom how this happened, then I asked our pre med advisor how someone like this could get in and she said "" uh well... he has a lot of experience with medicine because of his parents ""  and people have the nerve to complain about AA, that was the most atrocious bullshit I had ever seen."
medicalschool,3dotf2,SGUgunner,17,Sat Jul 18 13:26:44 2015 UTC,"I'm also surprised that happened. I worked in the admissions department as an M3 once a month as one of the student members on the panel that accepted applicants. There were strict rules and guidelines in place to prevent nepotism. If you knew an applicant, or knew someone from their family, you were to excuse yourself from taking any part in their application review.   And the acceptance process itself was brutal. Sure, if you had connections or knew the Dean, you could have strings pulled and be given an interview even with the worst application imaginable. However, being accepted is another story, and your application is combed through and voted on by and entire panal of students, professors, and administers. The applicants that get accepted are discussed and reviewed by the panel as a group, and each member of the admissions board can basically veto a candidate if they feel strongly about then not being qualified. There is no reverse method for one board member to accept anyone by themselves, the entire admissions committee has to agree on the acceptance. Not even the Dean of the medical school can accept someone without the admissions board's approval.  The guidelines our school uses for admission came from the AAMC, and are supposed to be fairly standard across the country. So your story of someone getting in with a 18 MCAT means one of three things:   You're not at a US MD school? You are at a US MD school, but your schools admissions process is not following the protocols its charter says it is, and you've got some shady stuff going on that the AAMC would love to know about. Or, what's probably most likely, the kid you're referring to doesn't actually have a 18 MCAT and the story is just gossip. Think about it, who the hell has actually seen this guys MCAT score? Your story reads like textbook gossip: ""Omg that guy shouldn't even be here, I heard he got a 18 MCAT and is only here because his mommy let him in"".

I casually mentioned these low scores when speaking with the director of admissions about grade and MCAT cut offs at this particular school. Apparently someone found out about it and they were not happy.  Now they have a strict 24 cut off.  Public US MD school."

This unit of measure is called character and it comes from coping with adversity.  I will bet that the length of how far you have come is much further than anyone of your classmates.  Acknowledge your colleagues flaws, but make a special effort to celebrate what is great about them too, because they represent your school and your reputation to some degree and you may work with some of them in the future.  Focus on you, compare yourself only to your past self, study hard, and remember that everyone who knows you is damn proud of the person you've become.  Best of luck, you will be f*ckin great."

Also, the ""OP 'shouldn't' be here"" because institutionalied racism, discrimination, etc. is BS.

Here's the thing: they usually passed the exams(we have interviews, not standardized tests) and got really high grades without doing or saying shit. Some of them will probably end up getting good positions in hospitals in my city or private clinics.  Now... this doesn't have to stop anyone from working hard towards their dreams. You don't study in medschool to get grades and compete with the other. No, you work your ass off to gather information for your future career.    In a few years none of your patients will ask you what score you got on that or that subject or why weren't you on top of your class. No, they will put their hopes in you to help them or their relatives. And in that moment you'll realize how irrelevant the grades/scores are.  You will be facing real problems then that you'll have to solve using your own knowledge!  I'm gonna say this as nice as I can: stop bullshiting around, stop complaining, stop find excuses and just open your books and study till your head falls on your desk, then wake up an study some more. Nothing is easy! Especially medical school which is getting harder and harder as you get closer to graduation...  You are on your own!  TL/DR: Medschool is hard.

On a sub that isn't /r/coontown I don't think I've read anything this racially oblivious and salty. And I'm more conservative than most on Reddit.   Being black, you're in the minority in medical school. Being the only X, whatever X is, is a naturally isolating experience.   Most of ya'll are salty because he's right, this is an incredibly privileged group. A non-small minority have their education paid for by their parents. Most of my peers have no undergrad debt.

I get what you're saying: you're making a livable income, it's temporary, etc... there are a lot of ways to justify it.  Still, changes in resident salaries have not come even close to adjusting to inflation for a long, long time. In addition you're making barely half of what a PA or NP makes, while working twice the hours and taking on much greater responsibility for patient outcomes.   So yeah, I get it when people say it's not that bad, or it's a rite of passage, but I think these are rationalizations that contribute to keeping residents from being paid fairly. Physicians need to get better at standing up for themselves, and having people within the profession basically saying lower wages are totally fine is completely counterproductive to this."

We suspect that he may have COPD, but he does not receive regular medical care and does not carry any diagnosis. He's been requiring oxygen anywhere from 2-6L NC. He's been tachycardic and but breathing in 15-20s. CXR shows mild to moderate pulmonary edema.   I think the problem is the clinical picture is not super clear to me either. I was gone for two hours at lecture and when i return my patient is somnolent (our guess is from the valium for EtOH withdrawal and opiates for his pain) and on way more oxygen than when I saw him this morning (at 6 up from 2).

medicalschool,3dpndr,kineticgraffiti,2,Sat Jul 18 12:06:10 2015 UTC,So are you saying that if the O2 sat is lower in the ABG than on the finger probe than it is venous? I think he was is the mid 90s when this was drawn. Anywhere from 92-95%. I'm not really confident what the expected difference in saturation should be. I recall hearing in a talk that if you're at 100% arterial saturation that you could expect an venous oxygen saturation of 75%
medicalschool,3dpndr,16334480004,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:54:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, correlating the oxyhemoglobin % to the patient's pulse ox is the best way to figure out if the ABG was actually arterial. And you're right--most venous specimens aren't going to have a lot more than 75% saturation. So yes, your specimen definitely looks arterial. It's possible someone took off his oxygen before drawing the ABG to get a ""room air"" sample."
medicalschool,3dpndr,bitcoinnillionaire,3,Sun Jul 19 00:27:16 2015 UTC,"It doesn't actually matter here if it's venous or arterial. The pH is only slightly decreased in venous blood, pco2 is slightly increased. Po2 is significantly decreased in venous blood. Regardless of if your sample is venous or arterial, your guy is having trouble ventilating.   I also disagree with the interpretation here. For a pco2 of 60 with chronic respiratory acidosis you would expect the bicarb to only be around 32 (increase of 4 for every 10 rule). You would also expect a slightly acidic ph whereas yours is bordering on the alkalemic range, especially if the sample is venous. This is a mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. Is the guy volume contracted? He's an alcoholic, any vomiting?  Edit: you mentioned pulmonary edema on cxr, does he have chf? That can give you a metabolic alkalosis."

medicalschool,3dpndr,robo23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"Typically, a VBG is going to be slightly more acidic because you expect to have more CO2 returning than in an arterial stab. Equally, the PO2 will be lower. Other metabolic markers will be the same, regardless of how you've taken it (within reason - if you leave a tourniquet on for a while to do a VBG you can end up with a falsely elevated lactate or potassium).  Regarding the high BE - it's because you have more base in the elevated bicarb. Are they a known CO2 retainer? If so, this could be close to their baseline (slightly crappy)."

medicalschool,3doviq,deedsed,16,Sat Jul 18 18:35:20 2015 UTC,"Where you go for medical school often can set you up for a better residency, which in turn would shape your clinical perspective. You can argue you'd get a better clinical education in a major medical center than smaller town. Access to level 1 trauma centers, state of the art surgical centers, and comprehensive stroke centers are all going to beat out a smaller town's general hospital in the breadth of pathologies you'll see.   That doesn't make the doctors any better or worse by nature, but it does seem to be that major academic medical centers attract bigger names. Letters of rec look nicer if they're the president of a society in the field you're applying to as admissions committees will recognize the name.   The preclinical aspect, however, does not change regarding where you go to school in my opinion. Pounding away a competitive Step 1 score I think is more often reflective of individual students than a program, and Step 1 is the first (and largest) step into the door of any residency."
medicalschool,3doviq,Makaroo,3,Sat Jul 18 07:45:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think letter's of rec from respected faculty and research opportunities are the main concrete, consistent advantages at a big name school. Other than that, training is so variable and not directly correlated with ranking."
medicalschool,3doviq,-QFever-,5,Sat Jul 18 01:29:01 2015 UTC,"While I do believe ""bad"" residencies exist (I think I've seen them), ""good residencies"" are much harder to define.  Many of the so-called top-tier residencies are very heavily research oriented.  Despite the name brands, I'm not sure that those places are the best possible training location for those interested in clinical medicine.  The best possible residency for any given medical graduate depends on so many more factors than what is cooked into the basic SDN-style reputation of a program.  The culture, the teaching styles, the location, the people, the clinical/research orientation, the patient population, the fellowship match list, etc etc.  You have to first decide what kind of doctor you want to be (and there are MANY different types!), and then you have to find the program that will best help you get there.    In this sense, I think I agree with the statement that medical school matters less because the process is much less individualized.  Step 1 is step 1.  The match is the match.  You want a school that will give you the opportunity to find your passions (good rotations) and help you succeed in actualizing them (match), but that's about it.  Residency is the place where you will become a physician, which I think gives it a significant edge in relative ""importance,"" though I recognize that you can slice this kind of argument pretty much any way you want."
medicalschool,3doviq,adenocard,5,Sat Jul 18 05:15:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, long-term residency is more important but the medical school makes a big difference too.  First two years will probably be similar but M3 and M4 can be DRASTICALLY different between schools. The way the two years are structured, how the culture of the school is towards letting med students doing stuff during cases, research opportunities, the quality of resident and attendings teaching on service, the types of patient population at the university hospital, how many different types of practice situations students are exposed to, how many students they need to stuff on each medicine/peds team etc. etc.  Consider there are DO schools which don't even have their own hospitals and the students have to go all over the country to train versus international referral centers with the best of the best. Then most of the places are in the middle somewhere."

medicalschool,3doviq,icevermin,-12,Sun Jul 19 08:40:08 2015 UTC,I thought what matters most is treating the patient.

medicalschool,3dqaz2,GKidney,3,Sat Jul 18 12:16:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know of one.  It is a rather straightforward shelf.  Read the psychiatry first aid and watch Emma Holiday.  Do both NBME exams, which are excellent practice for the shelf in my opinion.  The curve is effing killer, so gotta get a great score."
medicalschool,3dqaz2,ZombieMD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:05:46 2015 UTC,Just starting my 3rd year.   What do you mean about the curve being a killer? Could you please expand on that if possible? Is that true for all shelf exams in 3rd year?  Those exams for practice have no explanations right? How do you even go about learning from them if you get them wrong?
medicalschool,3dqaz2,fuggyp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"It means that the average is high. Like an 87. where as the average on a harder shelf will be lower, like a 71."
medicalschool,3dqaz2,Spicy_Masala,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"Sure.  The curve is a killer because many school use a percentile score not a raw score to grade shelf exams.  These percentile score calculators are released every year I think.  On the psych exam if you don't get over a 90ish raw score then you drop a few points.  If you get a 70, which is a ""normal"" raw score then you are down in the teens for percentile.  It is a brutal curve.    They all might be graded on a curve but psych is definitely the worst of them all.  NBMEs don't have explanations but you can look them or figure them out for yourself.    Edit:  Do the four hour test time so you can copy down the topics (ie - know DEPRESSION VS GRIEF) and you are good to go. Don't worry about getting a score, worry about knowing the subjects.  Some of my friend would just answer them all wrong so they could go back repeatedly (they don't give you the questions that you got right again)."
medicalschool,3dqaz2,ZombieMD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is a crazy spread. I had no idea everyone does that well and if you don't meet near those higher averages, that could be a big difference in grades where schools emphasize a good percentage of your shelf exam to it.   Oh man, I have a lot of work ahead to keep up to the upper echelon scores. Thanks Zombie and Spicy."
medicalschool,3dqaz2,fuggyp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:04:58 2015 UTC,"Everyone has different study techniques but to me it is ALL ABOUT QUESTIONS.  Do every question you can and refer to textbooks when they are amazing (Like first aid for psych).  You also just kind of get the hang of studying for and taking the test.    If I remember correctly, I started out somewhere in the middle of the pack but eventually got up to the top 10-20th percentile.  I didn't do too much different either, I just got better at identifying what is important and what isn't.   Talk to your upper classman as there are certain resources that are amazing for some and terrible for others.  For instance, first aid is really really amazing for psych but meh for everything else.  Case Files is kinda good all around.  Blueprints and BRS are excellent for peds and Step Up 2 Medicine is excellent for IM.  However, these might suck for other ones (Looking at you blueprints for surgery).  If you don't know about Emma Holiday from Texas look up her reviews.  Watch them before a rotation starts and again the final week.   Make a study schedule and stick to it. Read every night, even if its just for a few minutes and you have to pace around the house to stay awake. Keep a notebook in your pocket to write down topics and read about whatever you learn that day during the evening.  If service is slow ask your lowest level residents if you can scoot to a quiet corner and get some UWorld questions in on your phone...whatever you need to do.  I can't emphasize this enough.  You are there to learn, not to be a work bitch.  Do your work and help all you can but advocate to get out at a reasonable time.  I would often excuse myself when there was low work/learning opportunities and I only ever got one ""bad comment"" about this as compared to the 100 ""Well read and engaged comments"" because I knew what was going on with all my patients and their disease processes.  I ended up studying about 1 hour a night and 2-3 hours each weekend day on top of my in hospital studying and things turned out just swell -- I still had some time to live my life too.  Good luck!"
medicalschool,3dqaz2,ZombieMD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:44:46 2015 UTC,Is Pretest or the Lange Question & Answer book better for this shelf?
medicalschool,3dqaz2,fuggyp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:53:00 2015 UTC,"First aid for the psych shelf. Read the drugs chapter until you have every side effect memorized. Learn to count to 5 (need 5 of 9 criteria for depression, if they don't have 5 it's not a depressive episode no matter what)."

medicalschool,3dqaz2,Navy_Doc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:31:35 2015 UTC,These are both good for psych.  If you only have time to do one I would personally do pretest.  Lange is icing on the cake and is useful for taking your score from 90 to 95....but it is slow going and lots of tiny points compare to pretest in my opinion.  Up to you!  no matter what PRIORITIZE FIRST AID AND DRUGS.
medicalschool,3dmpen,sothisismyusername0,24,Fri Jul 17 14:56:57 2015 UTC,"Overall, my advice to you is to decide what you want to do first. At least narrow it down to medicine vs surgery vs non-patient contact. From there watch the attendings and residents in the different fields and think which of them you want your life to be similar to. If you decide you want to do IM or peds or gas or gen surg or whatever, you will likely match at a good program or a desirable location (maybe not both good location and program though).  But let's say you end up loving the idea of making 400k+ and cutting stuff up that isn't in the abdomen or vagina?  It's not all doom and gloom if you get a sub-250 like the internets want you to think. You did perfectly well on step 1, almost literally you got the mean. Also big difference on where you go to school. Top 10? Gives you a huge step up versus a lower ranked state school. Caribbean or DO? Then I have no advice for you since I'm not sure what the odds are for you.  Let's look at charting outcomes.  Ex.  Orth step 1 of 221-230 is basically a 50-50 shot (47/90 match) Derm 221-230 is two out three (20/29 match) Plastics 221-230 is also two out of three (16/24 match) Radiology 221-230 is like 95% (42/44)  Now these people probably aren't matching at UCSF or MGH and probably also have strong publications and much higher step 2 scores, but is it out of possibility? Definitely not.  So basically it is well within reach to go for a competitive specialty if that's what your mind is set on but it's an uphill climb. It will require doing well in 3rd year, getting great letters and possibly taking a year off for research or going into the match knowing there is a chance you may not match. All of that is minor if whatever you are applying to is what you want to do the rest of your life. People take 2, 3 or more years to get into medical school since that's all they can see themselves doing. If all you can see yourself doing is fixing fractures, there's nothing wrong with taking a year off for research to make yourself more competitive."
medicalschool,3dmpen,blizzah,14,Fri Jul 17 18:52:04 2015 UTC,"It's kind of nice to know that people are just as doom and gloom to US students about a completely average score as they are to IMGs. People like you, who actually take the time to look at a charting outcome, are really rare. And frankly we are all smart enough to know better than to run your mouth without having stats in you front of you."
medicalschool,3dmpen,secretman2therescue,7,Fri Jul 17 20:30:20 2015 UTC,"While I'm all about the data, remember there is an immense amount of self selection that goes into applying for residencies. Many schools will actively discourage you from applying to competitive specialties with a low boards score or poor grades. And guess what? Students will listen because it really sucks to go unmatched.  The students with low scores probably have some other exceptional part to their application. So take this data with a grain of salt too."
medicalschool,3dmpen,programmar1010,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:58:36 2015 UTC,"Charting the outcome is the only thing that keeps me sane. Only thing is...I wish they had better data on categorical vs. prelim. Gen Surg avg for US-IMGs is 227, but I would bet a majority are prelim"
medicalschool,3dmpen,SalAssante,5,Sun Jul 19 03:27:43 2015 UTC,"First, congrats you finished step 1 and basically hit the national average. Nothing wrong with that, we are talking about med students here, not the MCAT. It is hard to advise you without knowing which specialties you are interested in. The Big 3 (Med, Peds, Surg) are definitely a sure match assuming you are AMG and everything else is in order and a good program is definitely doable. Mildly competitive specialties will be harder but still within range (EM, OB/Gyn, Anesthesia, Rads). If you are thinking super competitive (Derm, Plastics, ENT) you will have to think hard about a chance of going un-matched. At this point though focus on getting great clinical grades, strong connections for LOR, and figure out what you want to do and start some research!"
medicalschool,3dmpen,X-RT,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:56:36 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking IM, Peds, or EM but not entirely sure. Thanks for explaining it in a categorical way-simplifies things a lot!"
medicalschool,3dmpen,medlurk,4,Sat Jul 18 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"So this is a reasonable, average score. You're right, it won't do you any favors for the ultracompetitive programs/specialties, but if you're coming from a US MD program, depending on what specialties you go for it's likely high enough that the rest of your app should usually get looked at."
medicalschool,3dmpen,Jalangaloze,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:07:40 2015 UTC,Are you implying residencies slide Step 1 scores past their desk and if it doesn't hit a mark the application goes in the trash? That sounds outrageous to me.
medicalschool,3dmpen,tupacnn,17,Fri Jul 17 18:50:03 2015 UTC,A large chunk of residencies post publicly their exact number cutoff to consider applications and nearly every program has an internal cutoff. Some away rotations post a cutoff too.
medicalschool,3dmpen,blizzah,11,Fri Jul 17 18:53:45 2015 UTC,"Yes.  They need to filter somehow. Fortunately not all programs do this and some look at step 2 as well, but the reality is below a certain step score means you don't get looked at."
medicalschool,3dmpen,medlurk,5,Fri Jul 17 18:54:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Some residencies are more explicit about this than others, but more or less this would be true for most programs, sometimes with certain exceptions (the student is from their own institution, or did an away rotation with them, or had specific connections or some other extraordinary reason to merit further consideration). Not saying I agree with this policy, just that it can happen."
medicalschool,3dmpen,Jalangaloze,-8,Fri Jul 17 19:16:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't like that at all. We're all more than just numbers. Some hospitals have a reputation to uphold I guess... Unfortunate
medicalschool,3dmpen,ANGRY_TWAT,5,Fri Jul 17 19:20:15 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't really come as a surprise to you though. This happens for  college admissions with SAT and GPA, med school with MCAT and GPA, and residency with Step 1 and Step 2.   A lot of the programs at our hospital have cutoffs and won't even look at your application if you fall below their step cutoff.  edit: and these usually aren't kept secret. I was waiting for an attending one day and chatting with the secretary and she told me without giving it a second thought."
medicalschool,3dmpen,Jalangaloze,0,Fri Jul 17 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"Yes but in regards to OP's score, I would think he'd be above the cutoff of most hospitals and most competitive residencies. It's as if they see an ""average"" score and someone could be passing on an amazing future doctor.  EDIT: maybe I was more surprised that schools wouldn't give more detail on a 227."
medicalschool,3dmpen,ANGRY_TWAT,2,Fri Jul 17 19:41:04 2015 UTC,"One of the more competitive programs at our school has a 240 cutoff. 227 isn't anything special, I mean, it's below average."
medicalschool,3dmpen,D-jasperProbincrux3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:52:37 2015 UTC,I know of a lot of departments with a 240 cutoff if you don't rotate with them. But these are in various surgical subspecialties.
medicalschool,3dmpen,medlurk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:06:54 2015 UTC,"That's what I said though, most programs in non uber-competitive fields wouldn't screen out a 227."
medicalschool,3dmpen,Jalangaloze,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:26:25 2015 UTC,I know and I agreed. Just surprised about screening in general
medicalschool,3dmpen,medlurk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:09:17 2015 UTC,"Fair I guess, although where are you in your training? They just get so many applications that there are a few ""auto-filters"" as it were that each program sets so that they don't have to spend too much time looking at overwhelming numbers of applications. The important thing is that each program sets its own individual criteria, which is why it's huge when applying to residencies to look at their websites, any published cutoffs, and to look at who they took for their last class. If your application will clearly look nothing like anyone they've taken (regionally, name-brand wise, MD vs DO for some, IMG for others, etc.) then you'll have a harder time getting past whatever screening filters they use. Just food for thought, and by no means a hard and fast rule."

medicalschool,3dmpen,Billionaire_Bot,5,Fri Jul 17 15:11:21 2015 UTC,"That's simply not true, just by virtue that for the most competitive programs, his/her application will likely get triaged because of the Step 1 score.  So even if they are spectacular in the other aspects of their application, it's unlikely they will receive an interview much less a spot.  Sure, everyone has heard a story about a student getting a competitive residency spot with average board scores but this is the exception not the rule. So sure it can happen, but in their scenario I would apply like it wasn't going to happen."

medicalschool,3dmpen,X-RT,8,Fri Jul 17 15:22:23 2015 UTC,General Surgery Residency followed by Plastics Fellowship
medicalschool,3dmpen,-QFever-,5,Fri Jul 17 15:57:51 2015 UTC,"Although a plastics fellowship is probably not something you want to bank on considering that the number of programs that do the traditional route to plastics is dwindling while the number of integrated programs is starting to dominate the field. Basically going into to general now to get into plastics down the road is betting against the trend. It's still doable, it's just tougher every year."
medicalschool,3dmpen,X-RT,6,Fri Jul 17 17:01:18 2015 UTC,"Right, but in the context of a 225 on step 1- that seems to be the only realistic option. This is just based on what I've gathered through my friend who is applying for those integrated programs."

Though this program screens  applicants on step score, this person did an away rotation at their program and was so impressive that they accepted him even though his step was low.

medicalschool,3dmw90,TheShaker,7,Sat Jul 18 20:19:28 2015 UTC,"We don't have undergrad here (straight from High School to medschool) but I guess I can contribute despite that.  I changed a lot. Increase the amount of studying a ton and also the efficiency, it is kinda difficult to make a list of minor tweaks but I'll try. Also this worked for me, doesn't have to work for everybody.   Study plan. I started separating planning mode and studying. With a more general plan in advance and a very concrete plan (for example: summarize ppt 3 until 10am) made the evening before a study day. Planning the studying also goes with a lot more organisation than what I did in High School. I have an Excel Sheet in which I enter every lecture and have cells for everything I want to do with it. This way I know exactly what I already looked at, which lectures I missed and which Anki cards I want to do next. This said: Anki Anki Anki Anki I started to time my studying with a stopwatch and record the amount studied for a certain exam/topic in a Excel sheet. This has a number of advantages: 1. No ""I'll start at 8am, it is 2min past so I'll start at 8.30...."" when I click the timer I'll start studying immediately. 2. Gives me an incentive for tasks that seem endless in the sense that I can feel like I accomplished something if I've put a certain amount of time into it. 3. Some confidence before the exam because I know exactly how much I studied. And most importantly going with the next point: Studying means studying, nothing else. For anything more that taking a sip of water I stop the timer (including bathroom breaks, cleaning up, searching for the right ppt etc.) I also stop the timer when I get distracted and am not really doing anything, staring at a ppt does not count. Like /u/gobigorgohome1001 said. I used a firefox extension to block reddit/youtube and other sites from midnight to 10.30pm every day. Helped a lot to prevent going to those sites out of habit.   That is everything I can think of at the moment. Maybe you already did all or most of this. Or maybe you don't like it. As I said, everyone studies differently.

But if you don't eat 4 one day, you gotta eat 8 the next day. Every day I make another initial run through of ALL the material we covered that day. It's easy when its two hours of anatomy followed by OPP lab (easy on tests). It sucks when you have 6 hours of physiology lecture in a day. I changed by conquering each day's material in its entirety the day off, then using the weekend to go through a 2nd time.

medicalschool,3dmw90,-QFever-,2,Fri Jul 17 15:59:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah honestly didn't really study in undergrad either so I don't have much a comparison but I will say that myi dea of what studying is from the little I did before has changed. In med school you're studying is all about looking at a huge volume of info, memorizing the key details/pathways/diagrams, and trusting your brain to recall the less critical minutiae at test time. You can't spend very much time on any one topic so you have to learn to look at it and move on. Also I recommend everyone take a  VARK test to determine their dominant learning styles and figure out how to incorporate them into your learning as much as possible. It's a really short free evaluation and my school strongly recommended it."

Just let med school happen for a little while and you'll see how much your ""study game"" improves. You'll get through loads of material and actually understand it. I was amazed at my stamina and comprehension improvements, and it moves into the rest of your life too. You feel like you can do so much more in a day when you're used to going hard every day."

You can get loans, which you will be able to pay back when you graduate, and there are plenty of specialties where shaky hands don't matter. But bottom line is even if you end up in a career where you don't have to work crazy hours, throughout med school and internship/residency you will.

There are people who have overcome tremendous obstacles to be doctors, including losing one of their senses, like hearing. You need better excuses.  Yes there are a lot of hours, especially in residency, but I think it's worth it if I can treat patients for the rest of my life and get paid decently to do it. I'm not going to convince you it's worth it because that's for you to decide.   Look, it's hard enough just to get into medical school, so sit down and have an honest discussion with yourself about if you're okay with being in school/training until you're 30 and take aptitude tests every 10 years after to prove you're still competent.   Anyways, you seem to be seeking confirmation that being a doctor in not for you (I didn't see a single thing in your post about why being a doctor is awesome, just reasons why you don't want to be one). If you think it's not for you, you're probably right. If you think ""it'll never happen"" you're probably right. So I'm gonna stop here.  Point is, it's all a mindset no matter what you do. With an MD degree you can also do research if you don't want to be a traditional doctor, but that can come with long hours as well. If you get an MBA along with your MD, you can be a health care administrator. Lots of options, all difficult."

I didn't follow their recommendations 100%, but I did change two major things -- my laundry detergent (only using Free and Clear or fragrance free types) and my body wash (using a fragrance and lanolin free brand) -- and start taking regular anti-histamines (Zyrtec).

I can't really offer advice as to how to manage your money, there are just too many variables involved for an internet post that isn't a wall of text. What I can say though is your life will go on in spite of the debt. You can try like crazy to pay it back ASAP but I feel like you shouldn't sacrifice actually living your life in the meantime. We already give up a good chunk of time to study medicine so I don't think it makes sense to give up another 5 years of working yourself to the bone and living off the bare minimum just to get back to the break even point. You have your entire life to earn a good salary and the debt is going to be paid off eventually.

I'm gonna be almost 180K in debt by the time I graduate, not counting interest. Specifically picked this school (in state) because it would be cheaper and I'd know more people.   I'm currently dating a wonderful woman who I plan to marry eventually (probably end of med school), and she works a great job that we could both easily live off as we are very frugal (More than either of our parents made, but not amazingly fantastic money, about a residents salary).   So I'm honestly thinking I'll put almost all of my resident salary into repaying loans, then a portion of attending salary, and be done fairly quickly. I'll moonlight for extra cash to do any short vacations or buy anything special or take her to a nice dinner. I'll put as much as I can into a Roth IRA and if I can a roth 401k. Other than that, all paying off loans.  My brother who is also in med school makes fun of me for having found a suga mama. I ain't complaining. If you end up married to a working woman or man, though, frankly, you can do a lot as a childless person and pump money in to deal with debt.  And as far as the occasional extra grand or two I build into my loans as a buffer/entertainment/booze fund?

medicalschool,3dkyze,lmike215,2,Fri Jul 17 07:06:37 2015 UTC,"Okay so I give this advice to a bunch of people. The best strategy for paying off debt is going to be to try to live normally, not extravagantly.  What many people do is they try to do is scrimp and save and pay things down in residency. I don't think this is the best idea. What happens is in residency is that they put off for when they are ""making it big."" Then when they come out of residency, they buy the big house, nice car and so on. And suddenly they find the debt unmanageable.  The problem is the sudden change in salary. We don't know what to do with it. Instead, you should try to live comfortably on residency salary, and don't worry too much about paying down the debt. Then when the money comes, DON'T increase your standard of living at all (okay you can a little bit, but don't buy a fancy new car or house) for lets say 3 years and put half the extra in savings and half the extra into your loan. You will cut your loan in half and have a nifty little savings to boot. Then you can slowly start to raise your standard of living to match what you are actually making.   Kids can complicate this strategy, but they are an investment in human capital. Not yours, just theirs. So you just do it.  Remember, doctors ARE NOT RICH. We are paid well, but if you went into this for the money, and you are an MS1 get out NOW."
medicalschool,3dkyze,ashern,3,Fri Jul 17 22:12:44 2015 UTC,"If you're at least thinking about the money and you understand how loans work you're already ahead of many medical students. The best  thing you can do is take out as little as possible, and pay it back as quickly as possible. When you finally do graduate don't jump right into spending like a doctor, ease into it.

DO NOT PUT SO MUCH PRESSURE ON YOURSELF. I promise that you can get through this. Please PM me to talk if you want.   Now to answer your questions: Have you tried a SSRI? Abilify is an atypical antipsychotic, and might not be the best choice for depression and social anxiety. SSRIs tend to be really well tolerated. Please please find a good psychiatrist, because they can best guide you through this process.   There are a LOT of A type, stressed out, anxious, and depressed people in medical school.

All medical student interaction with patients (real or fake) at first is ""awkward, clumsy, and retarded."" Don't stress over this, it gets a lot easier with practice. Your professors and attendings don't expect you to be smooth at this point. Experience lends to confidence, and then you won't seem so awkward anymore.  Watching some of my new interns (actual doctors!) this past week has been especially painful. But when I look at my upper level residents that were new interns a year ago, I am always amazed at the change.  You've got lots of time to master this. Don't start stressing before you even start!"

I proceeded to measure a flexion in the knee of 270°. The examiner kept a straight face. I still passed.   I am looking forward to my first patient interaction as a real doctor in a few years. I am sure I'll say something stupid.   So while I think you (OP) should try to talk to a psych and get help and set up a support net for when things get more stressful, I agree with /u/count_zero11 patient interactions needs experience.

Everything changed when I got into medicine. The profession is hard enough already without having to deal with shit like being too nervous to make a phone call or get groceries. I used my student support at my college and was seen by a psychiatrist within 2 weeks. I've been taking 112.5 mg of venlafaxine everyday for the last year. The only thing I can say is I wished I sought help earlier, In retrospect I was miserable beforehand. I feel like I haven't really lived until this last year.   No real side effects from my meds except some insomnia that went away in 2 weeks.   Didn't feel really good until about 6 weeks after I started my medication and my dose had to be changed from 75mg to 112.5mg.  Hope this perspective helps."

medicalschool,3djg0k,runaardvarkrun,2,Fri Jul 17 00:55:08 2015 UTC,"Look and see if your school has any support services for this. Some schools don't but many schools have wellness programs and dedicated counselors you can talk to for free. I would also just be straight forward with a psychiatrist about your needs as a student when it comes to picking a drug or therapy for you. Lastly, if you have friends or family members you trust, you should probably talk to them before starting classes so that they are aware of your depression and that you will need them to be checking in on you. Keep your support network updated. If you get to depressed to update them, they'll probably notice and check on you. Best of luck this fall! Remember, they may be hiding but there are other depressed and anxious students in your class so you are definitely not going to be alone."
medicalschool,3djg0k,PennyTrait,2,Thu Jul 16 20:25:10 2015 UTC,"SSRIs are first line for major depression and social phobia. I don't know why you were given aripiprazole, which is an antipsychotic. Sometimes it is used to enhance the effect of SSRIs, but it seems weird to me that it was used as a monotherapy for your symptoms. The attending for my psychiatry rotation loved citalopram. If you really feel like you need medication, I would request that (or another SSRI). Just be aware that the side effects can be pretty significant (sexual dysfunction, weight gain, etc.). Personally, I would try lifestyle modification (e.g. regular exercise, improved diet) before SSRIs.   The first few weeks of medical school are not ""crucial."" I don't even remember the first few weeks of medical school. Also, the first semester (at least at my school) was super easy. The first two years will help you build a foundation of knowledge. Then you will take step 1. Just relax and learn as much as you can in the first two years.   It's not uncommon to be super awkward with patients initially. It's not really that big of a deal. You will get better at it. Chin up.  Don't be nervous. Everyone is new and wants to make friends. A lot of people will be very nerdy and socially awkward. It's not like high school at all.

She will probably know what you are going through much better than most, dealing with medical students and all. I don't think there is anything wrong with having the anxiety meds on standby, in case you need them.   As for the depression, the sooner you start dealing with that, the better. Any antidepressant takes anywhere from 3 to 4 weeks to take full effect.   Don't worry. It's not that bad. Trust me, there will be harder and more crucial times... and you'll get through those too.

medicalschool,3djg0k,MikeDBil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:50:16 2015 UTC,"Email your school counselor. Hooking up students who need mental health treatment with the necessary resources is one of their main jobs. Many schools have free psychiatric services for students (often called CAPS).  My main advice would be to get it taken care of early. Finding the right meds can take a short amount of time (4-6 weeks), or can be a long trial of many different failed meds. Med school will test you and very well could bring out the worst of your symptoms. So tackle it head on and do so as early as possible.  Last point, as /u/getthepointe77 said, the first few weeks of M1 are definitely not crucial in any sort of catastrophic way. Sure, it's nice to develop good studying habits early on.

Medical school is super emotionally draining.

I dip in and out a lot and it's manageable (I'd say at this point I'm dysthymic) but it's just more work and at this point the energy it takes to make sure you're mentally stable is energy you're taking away from achieving your goals.

Just food for thought, you'll end up completely customizing it to yourself and what you're doing with it, and you can always hide the columns with bulky info.   You can reuse some of the columns too, but I used a second spreadsheet to evaluate programs that I actually interviewed at, and if you want to be really nerdy you can objectively score them on various criteria (size, location, research, gut feel for fit, etc.), weight those criteria, and thus score the programs to come up with a draft of your rank list."

This is really handy if I only have 15 minutes or so.  Having one deck per 1/2 lectures means that you can easily find the relevant lecture material if you don't understand something Smaller decks can always be grouped into one 'super deck' (not sure what it's called) and be tested together if you want that.

medicalschool,3dix36,threetogetready,2,Thu Jul 16 19:17:42 2015 UTC,"Depends on the information in the lecture - is it fact-based stuff to memorize or more conceptual? My lectures in the last week or so have gone from as little as 9 cards to about 54ish cards.   I do less cards whenever I can - for example, stuff I know cold, already made cards on this topic recently etc.  Keep the card as short and focused as possible. 1-2 max for the most part ... BUT: I use Anki for most of my learning so I kind of make different types of cards -- for example, a larger card that just has concepts laid out on it. When I come to that card when reviewing I sit and read and think and make sure I have it down. Other cards are short and sweet facts and other stuff like that. Sometimes I will just have cut and pasted multiple choice questions / fill in the blank / open ended etc.... So I have to think instead of just fast recall of facts... so I use a lot of different things when I do.  I'm really loose about how many cards I make and review a day. We have a lot of pre-recorded lectures etc. so I will pound out a few lectures and make the cards at the same time (split the screen between Anki and lecture) and maybe make hundred plus cards. I can pause the video and re-watch right then for understanding etc.   I'm also loose about the guidelines and stuff Anki/others lay out. I just take a chunk of time and review all my cards for the upcoming test etc. almost everyday. That way I have seen all the material like a hundred times before the test. I'll do it slower when I'm not remembering stuff. I can then take the time to go back and read up on stuff I don't feel solid on (read the lectures notes, FA, watch pathoma, catch up on USMLERX questions etc. etc.). I have a subdeck for every scheduled lecture for each upcoming exam so I can the cards for a specific lecture or review the whole deck if I want...  It's been trial and error figuring out what works best for me. And I think the same goes for everybody using Anki.... in general."

medicalschool,3dhrwh,litehacker,17,Thu Jul 16 11:21:24 2015 UTC,"Here's a few issues with your idea:   Residents NEED to spend a lot of time taking care of patients. The difference between a med school graduate and an attending physician is the  tens of thousands of hours of clinical experience from residency. If you were to double the number of residents and cut the number of hours in half, you would also need to double the total duration of all residencies. Since your time as a resident is pretty miserable (below minimum wage compensation, long hours, grunt work, etc), most physicians would probably prefer to get it over with in 3 years rather than 6. Not to mention that decreased yearly compensation spread over MORE years of residency would mean it would take an eternity to finally pay off that $100-200k med school debt. Another reason why residents work so many hours is because hospitalists also work long hours. Continuity of care is incredibly important in ensuring good patient outcomes, and being able to follow a patient through the entire treatment process in one shift is very useful in learning how to treat patients. Doubling the number of residency spots means doubling the number of physicians. This would mean relaxing the standards for medical school admissions and would possibly result in less qualified people getting into the field. A lot of physicians probably don't want to admit this, but more doctors working means less pay for everyone. Physicians are compensated so highly because it is so difficult to become one. You make that process easier and let in more people, the profession as a whole is much less financially rewarding."
medicalschool,3dhrwh,Keegan-,-17,Thu Jul 16 13:32:38 2015 UTC,"Less qualified people getting into the field? lmao.  Calm down with the ego trip. Anyone, literally anyone, could do what we do, it is all about determination."

People quit not because they aren't smart enough, but because they didn't have what it takes to push through. Not everyone can do that, and therefore they don't."
medicalschool,3dhrwh,MyNameIsNotSally,2,Thu Jul 16 19:35:45 2015 UTC,"People quit not because they aren't smart enough   Plenty of people who wanted to be doctors at the beginning of their college education found out they weren't smart enough. There are tons of articles about IQ variance by profession. What stands out about doctors in those studies is the low end of the physician range is still pretty high. You don't have to be a genius to be a doctor, but there is a minimum threshold of intelligence, and plenty of people who want to be doctors don't make it because they're not smart enough."
medicalschool,3dhrwh,chickendance638,15,Fri Jul 17 23:14:51 2015 UTC,"As a fellow software engineer, I can relate to the feeling that there is a simple system at play here that nobody has ever taken the time to think through.  That's often the case in our job.  But what you've said here comes across as very condescending, mostly because it seems like you've said all this in order to justify saying this last line:   It's just that doctors have been trained to follow directions, and that is what they do - even if it affects their long term health, wealth, and social life negatively.   This is a cool line that the public has latched onto in order to maintain their lofty feelings of superiority in the face of a medical arena they mostly don't understand, and you're going to get blasted saying it on this sub.  The truth is that virtually all of us have degrees in other disciplines (read: full training in another field, often including computer science, engineering, and/or other STEM disciplines) and got here by a combination of critically examining our career goals and deciding that this was an option we want to pursue.  It's taking out a bet on yourself to the tune of several hundred thousand dollars, when we could have gone into many, many different lines of work and started making money immediately. (Some of us are actually leaving decent paychecks for the student lifestyle.) So you'll understand when we get kinda pissy after you imply that we're incapable of critical thought.

medicalschool,3dhrwh,WendellX,29,Thu Jul 16 20:43:40 2015 UTC,"People are focusing on your solution because frankly your understanding of the problem is incomplete at best and downright wrong in many ways. Match day is not responsible for the low numbers of residents. Residencies are paid for by the federal government and spots have remained stagnant since the 1990s, even while the sick and elderly population balloons. This topic is discussed on r/medicine and r/medicalschool pretty much daily, and calls to lobby the government to expand the number of spots have been ongoing for years. You haven't discovered some hidden secret that all of us lemming med students have never thought to ask about, and your understanding of it is not complete. Given that that's the case, what else can we focus on but your solution, which pretty casually dooms medical students and residents to a lifetime of debt and interest payments?"
medicalschool,3dhrwh,16334480004,2,Fri Jul 17 23:00:10 2015 UTC,"Increase residency spots by 16%, decrease work ours by 16%....12 hours a day turns into 10 hours a day, which is completely reasonable.  Increase residency length by 6 months and your hours of ""experience"" are more than made up.   No one is going into lifelong debt, no one is doomed.    Seems like money is everyones motivation... increase spots, get paid less, dont get attending salary as soon, less demand.  Everyone here is so damn elitist.  If patient care is the primary goal, then 12 to 10 hours a day allows residents to not only be more well rested but gives them more time to study, resulting in better patient care."
medicalschool,3dhrwh,hamm3rhand,28,Thu Jul 16 16:36:21 2015 UTC,"I also am aghast at the hours that residents work for the pay, especially when it seems like there is no way they actually adhere to the 80 hour limit in some cases, however let me play devil's advocate for a bit.   There is also an issue of quality of education in that case, which is one of the largest arguments against restricting work hours even more, and was a major one when they were first put into place. They say that there is a certain amount of time that you need to put in to be able to meet baseline qualifications. Also, who would teach these residents? The hospitals would need to hire more attendings to handle the load there too.   Also if you double the number of residents and halve the time they work, you probably just also increased their residency from 3 years to 6, or 4 to 8, or 7 to 14!  That is a huge lifelong loss of compensation when you compare attending salary to resident salary, especially if you are cutting the salary in half to pay for it. Post residency a physician's salary will in most cases at least quadruple, and for the longer fields that would be more impacted like surgery it can easily go higher than that. But if you want to double the time at half the pay, I don't think anyone would take that deal since it just doesn't make financial sense.   Finally, I just want to say that the first year of residency is the worst part for the vast majority of residencies. After that you generally aren't working so hard, because you have interns of your own to take care of the little stuff for you. So it will get better for your girlfriend!"
medicalschool,3dhrwh,Mnemoceos,11,Fri Jul 17 18:40:52 2015 UTC,"I'd take a 6 year residency at reasonable hours to a 3 year residency at 80+ hours per week ANY DAY. In EU, you work an average of 48 hours over a set period of time (so you might still have some 60-80 hour weeks but it's compensated by balancing time off). In the UK, postgraduate training can range from 5-10 years. I'm perfectly okay with that. I don't believe the argument of ""we can't cut resident's hours because their training suffers"" stands at all. It's ludicrous that you force a harmful, unworkable system on residents for fear of harming their education, at the peril of their social and personal life, as well as their mental health.   America has a higher level of public spending on healthcare than most EU countries, not to mention the huge private spending on top of that. Y'all can afford to make medical education affordable; compensate your physicians well; and hire enough people so as not to force people to work 80+ hours a week."
medicalschool,3dhrwh,hamm3rhand,7,Thu Jul 16 12:53:11 2015 UTC,"I agree our training system at the moment is not ideal, (as I stated I was playing devil's advocate), however I have a feeling more people would take the current situation over the proposed, assuming the amount of funding remained the same, ie: 20k/yr for 6 years. So you lose out on 20k/yr x 3 years for the first, and then approximately 180k/yr for the next three years. Would you give up 600k of lifetime earnings because of one year of long hours? as I mentioned, at most residencies, the hours and mental strain get significantly better after the first year.   The argument about resident hours is if you decrease the total number of hours, ie, the 80 hours/week year becomes a 40 hour/week year with no extra year added. If you add back the year at the end, at that point it becomes a compensation issue.   Personally, yes, it would be great if we could have a system where there was less strain on the residents, we were compensated better, health care was affordable for everyone, we weren't effectively locked into a specific program for the duration of residency, and many other issues."

Most of the time, even though you have some choice in matching, you never know where you will end up. People could be single, married, divorced. They could have an SO who makes a shit ton of money, some, none, or one that's even in debt. Aside from bills including rent, how do you expect someone to do all of this and still make minimum payments every month on around a $180000 student debt.

medicalschool,3dhrwh,acidrain06,-4,Fri Jul 17 21:16:31 2015 UTC,"As far as I have seen, since this is such a tightly controlled system, residency can be considered a continuation of education. If it were really a job, you'd have the ability to quit and find another place where to work without much effort. Costs for education are indeed too high, and should be addressed, but as a separate issue. In the worst case, you should have a choice whether or not you want to work the extra hours for extra money."

medicalschool,3dhrwh,aminoacyl,19,Thu Jul 16 12:02:33 2015 UTC,"Hey I know you're trying to help, but this kind of comes across as condescending. Also you didn't even do enough research so you falsly stated that the medical match makes all of the decisions to bottleneck residency spots. It's pretty insulting that you're basically insinuating that you, someone outside of the health system, are more knowledgable then us and that you have all of the answers.  Anyways, here are some points to consider.  1.) Majority of residency training funding comes from Medicare. Medicare has a residency cap(due to a previous ""fluke"" in the system that allowed for hospitals to get more medicare money by having more residencies). Therefore, if you want more residents than the cap, you have to fund it yourself or find outside funding.  2) Good luck getting the hospital to pay out of pocket to train residents. In my opinion this is a classic example of social loafing. Hospitals are run by businessmen for the most part(another topic entirely) and why would they train residents out of their own pocket when the resident will most likely go work somewhere else when the training is done? Even if every hospital starts training out of pocket to increase the total number of residents some hospital will get the bright idea of ""Hey, everyone else is paying to create more residents, we could save money by not contributing since there are already lots of residents."" Tragedy of the commons.  3.) 20k a year(for potentially 8 years NOT INCLUDING FELLOWSHIP!!!) is pebbles in comparison to the average med student debt of 150k-200k. You can't really say that it's a ""continued education"" since you literally have similar if not the same responsibilities as the doctors and nurses. Also, lots of places pay wages during training."

It's just stupid to inject unknown compounds into your body during med school.  This is not the time to experiment. Only use compounds and doses you've used in the past and you know you react well to. Don't run a cycle until you're 100% sure you can keep up with your coursework AND commit enough time to lifting, meal prep, and sleeping.  Most important: control your estrogen.

Personality: You have no medically valid reason to possess these steroids. You have no diagnosis which necessitates their use.

I'm not talking about just being big and lean, but proportions and vascularity.  The desire to look like that probably comes from some deep-seated body image issue or inferiority complex, but it is what it is.  That's what it takes to make some people feel happy and confident.   You can argue that it sets a bad precedent, but at the end of the day a med student using exogenous androgens is putting no one at risk but himself 99.999999% of the time.  Narcotics are a totally different can of worms due to their addiction potential and how they would affect a doctor trying to care for a patient.  It's easy (and, I admit, not unreasonable) to use that blanket statement for all controlled substances, but the physician/student using steroids in a responsible manner to achieve his personal goals poses virtually no threat to a patient. I can't speak for OP, but I don't discuss steroid use IRL with anyone, ever.  I'm driven by a mix of conflicting amateur athletic goals I could not achieve without steroids and the desire to push my limits.  I do this for no one but myself.  Additionally, I have a prescription for the testosterone (hypogonadism with a legitimate etiology), so my legal risk is essentially nil."

So that's self-medicating, harmful in it's own right and against everything we're taught.  While I agree that narcotic use has a much higher probability of impairing a provider, exogenous androgens are not without their inherent dangers. Mood and temperament issues are possible, as you raised in your earlier post. Personality alterations can cause problems, both for patients and employers. But I see a bigger issue in the provider being unable to divorce themselves from biases created by their use of illicit steroids. We know that steroid use in adolescents and young adults carries an increased risk of suicidality. This creates a potential for impairment in treating patients doing the same.

You might also learn about testosterone therapy in the context of hypogonadism with a clear etiology (Klinfelter syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, pituitary adenoma, etc.).

The secret here is usually not to make more, but to spend less. Rent a crappy apartment with multiple roomies. Many of my classmates rent houses, but those are for rich kids. You can get a cheap 3 bedroom apartment for 700 a month near me, and get 2 roomies. Drive an old car. Ditch cable. Also, food can be a huge cost if you let it. Buying food at cafeterias and restaurants adds up to thousands a year. Learn to cook. I just made a giant pot of cabbage sausage stew for about 4 dollars that will feed me for a week. It's all about living within your means. It's what most of our patients have to do, and I think it's a great learning experience for us to have to do it for a while. I actually grew up this way, but most of my classmates have no experience with life like this. I don't know what you background was, but either way, there are always ways to lower expenses."

medicalschool,3dl2fw,amonust,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:47:23 2015 UTC,"Sure. Get a big pot. Put in a tablespoon of oil, a package of spicy sausage, a chopped up onion, a few sticks worth of chopped celery, and one finely chopped carrot. Cook it all together in the pot til it all looks cooked, stirring frequently. Maybe 15 minutes. Add 1 quart chicken stock (I use home made, made from boiling chicken bones from a roast chicken I made before) and a big can of crushed tomatoes. Then add seasonings. I use 2 tbs vinegar, 1 tbs paprika, 1 tbs sage, 1 tsp garlic, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, and a dash of cayenne. Add a whole chopped up cabbage. I also added about a pound of chopped cauliflower. Then add water til it covers all the solid stuff. Bring to boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours, stirring and replacing water every 20 min or so. Then it's done. This recipe is based on cabbage rolls, but its way easier because you don't have to roll them all up.   You will need more than one recipe though. I solidly recommend learning how to cook for everyone. Most recipes are very easy to do once you know the basics, and cooking for yourself in a cheap way is so easy and saves so much. You should start with learning to make chicken a few ways (BBQ, roasted, Italian, crusted, etc), a few pasta dishes, a few rice dishes, a stir fry, a few ways to make veggie sides (oven roast, steam, boil) and a few baked goods. With variations on those, you start branching out with different flavors and really make a great food experience that never gets old."

I got research funding for the summer, but if I hadn't it would have been easy for me to take out more loans to cover my living expenses.  Check out the budget your school publishes and see how your expenses compare. I needed literally less than half of the non-tuition expenses allotment (still on my parents insurance, live in school subsidized housing but school budgets for much more expensive housing, car is paid off, never bought a single textbook, cook ~80-90% of my meals, no credit card debt)"

After reading your plan, I think you might be over-compensating for your CIS.  If you are doing the same plan you had last time plus adding more things to say I think you need to come up with a different plan of attack.  If you spend too much time on CIS, you may decrease your ICE score.   Right before physical exam, ""If you can put ur finger on it, what do you think may be the issue or assosciated with it"" Let them responsd.   Don't bother doing this part.  Takes too long, and 9/10 will just tell you, ""If I knew, why would I be here"".  Instead, after summarizing or counseling the patient I would always ask, ""Is there anything you can think of that I forgot?""  I asked at least twice per case.  If I missed something the SP would usually tell me or they would say, ""Nope, thats everything"".   Go wash hands ""So mr./ms. blah blah, it must be fun working as a....... it must be fun to have 2 kids running around........... did you do anything fun this weekend?.........."" These questions help to connect with the patient more.   Don't wash your hands in the sink, Don't put on gloves.  Go up to the sink where the purell is and get the absolute smallest bead of purell you can possibly get and quickly rub your hands together so they are dry.  Then immediately get to your open ended questioning.  Don't kibbitz with the SP.  You ain't got time for that shit!  Pro tip:  If your patient is already draped, and the drape is really spread out (even covering the legs).  Uncover the drape during the exam.  There is usually a surprise physical exam finding for you :-)  Good Luck"

Not trying to criticize, just seems like I went about it the same way you did and I was borderline from a pass. I did sympathize with each patient, didnt do any bullshit small talk, always talked about the plan and asked if they had questions after. Was always polite, aka if somebody coughed, asked if they wanted water or if they had a headache, asked if they preferred lights off.

In essence it's more like the U.S. system as we all have degrees, but that's drastically different from most UK medical schools where you do a flat 5 years from age 18. I started at 23 after working for two years in a laboratory as a biomedical scientist. My entry levels grades for university were utter wank; I essentially failed because I didn't revise for them, meaning I had to go the long way around and do a degree before getting in.  Does that make a difference? No. Am I a worse student than my A-grade counterparts? Doesn't seem like it.  People on my course are lawyers, accountants, biomedical scientists, English Lit degree holders, etc. etc. Bar a couple who came straight out of their previous degree and still have no knowledge of the real world, most of us have worked and know the realities of what is required.  That's a remarkable thing and it really helps with the atmosphere. People aren't choking each other to get higher deciles because we understand it's a) very ineffective; b) makes you learn less because you can't work together; c) makes very little difference to your career so long as you work hard to get points elsewhere (papers, audit etc)"

Right now you're trapped in this relatively immature mindset that the measure of your ability is something that requires external evidence. You don't really believe that you're good at anything until you see the test result, and the positive glow from that experience (assuming you do well) only lasts a couple of weeks. Maybe less if you happen to catch sight of a classmate's higher grade.  The most important lesson I learned during my corporate career is that my successes and failures are a function of what I do, not what I am. Success isn't something that just happens to people. If I fail a test, it's not because I'm dumb, it's because I did something wrong (or failed to do something I needed to). It's not about beating yourself up, it's about knowing that you are a person who can succeed, so any time you fail to meet your personal standard, it's because of things you did or didn't do. This puts you in control of your own destiny. It means that failing is an opportunity for reflection and improvement, not self flagellation. Likewise, it means that success isn't about bolstering your ego, it's confirmation that your strategy is working.

A lot of my ego was wrapped up in being a strong student. It wasn't my friends or my class, it was me being too hard on myself when I felt I had failed.   I did three things that helped me:   Focus on wins, not on losses: Darn, I scored lower than I was hoping on my hematology exam. But in hematology clinic I answered 6/7 questions from my preceptor correct and got 2 proper histories from the 2 new patients. That's not shabby. Critically examine tests without self-loathing: What did I do well? What did I botch? I screwed up so many questions on cardiac pathophysiology. Damn. But I did I do a good amount of practice questions in it? Or did I focus on just pathology because I'm more comfortable with it. Let me tell you...I did the latter. So I won't beat myself up (even though I'm prone to that), I'll make sure to focus more on weak spots next test. Take fun when I can get it: Med school is hard. Should I try and power through that last hour from 10-11PM when I have already been studying for 6-7 hours that day? Naw man, watch some Thrones and have a glass of wine. Sometimes powering through a few more hours of studying is needed... but if you're on top of your stuff, I've found it rarely is.    I don't know your situation. But I was too hard on myself.

medicalschool,3dj1gw,guccimanelafleur,2,Fri Jul 17 06:11:12 2015 UTC,"Hi not a med student, still undergrad but I had the exact same dilemma that I want to share my insight.  Depends on the use you'll put into it, for general note taking and leisure activity such as browsing reddit and just normal things you would do on a normal laptop, get the surface 3. The surface 3 pro, really is the professional option, it's got a stronger processor and specs overall that I've seen is made for photoshopping, video editing and more graphics and processor intensive activities. If you're not going to be doing things that require the full use of the specs, don't get the pro. So unless you have a side job of marketing or a video editor or whatever, just go with the normal surface.  Or does a bigger screen mean the world to you? The biggest selling point of the surface is the touch pen, if you wanted a bigger screen might as well get a laptop with tablet capabilities.  Adding on, in case someone asks ""just to be safe should I get the stronger tablet?""   The answer is, is it worth almost double the price for it to possibly not affect your daily activity?  Save the money and invest it elsewhere. Why spend 1k on one item, when you could also get a surface and a pretty good laptop? Or desktop for home use?"

medicalschool,3dine4,Spicy_Masala,6,Thu Jul 16 16:04:13 2015 UTC,I would say it depends on the sensitivity of the test delineated by the lab
medicalschool,3dine4,HarryHoodlum,7,Thu Jul 16 18:55:15 2015 UTC,1:320 means that it is positive to the 1:320 serial dilution. What the lab techs literally do is make serial dilutions of the patient's sample and the number report is the dilution that it is still positive. So a higher number is more positive. 1:320 is a higher titer than 1:160.  The actual cutoff for clinical relevance is lab-dependent and test-dependent.
medicalschool,3dine4,tigecycline,2,Thu Jul 16 23:14:53 2015 UTC,"My understanding of ANA is that it is both a specific and sensitive for autoimmunity (commonly, SLE). Not everyone with a positive ANA test has  autoimmunity/SLE, but a negative ANA test can be used to rule out the diagnosis. In doing some quick reading approximately 30% of healthy people will have a positive ANA test at 1:40. This drops to 3% at 1:160 (Source: http://rheuminfo.com/diseases/anti-nuclear-antibody-ana-testing).  1:320, in my opinion, would be a positive ANA test."
medicalschool,3djic1,chomstar,4,Thu Jul 16 19:48:45 2015 UTC,"My advice: find a electrophysiologist/arrhythmia specialist (generally at larger cardiology-specific clinics or academic centers). These conditions are so rare and not well characterized compared to other CV pathology, general cardiologists may not offer the best management. An EP will be able to guide you through the decisions you will be making. Keep in mind that genetic testing only picks up the known mutations, so a negative there isn't 100% conclusive either  (I went through workup for a rare cardiac syndrome [PCP>cards>EP])"

medicalschool,3dka6i,kmob20,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:18:44 2015 UTC,"I've written a whole post about the medical school experience. For your circumstances, you need to make sure you have all of the medical school prerequisites finished, and you'll also need to take the MCAT pretty soon here if you want to start applying for next year's class. You may end up having to take two years ""off"" to get your ducks in a row - at least you'll have a decent job to back you up if you're getting your MLS or CLS license.    It's also a really good idea to understand completely what you're getting yourself into. I just started year 7/10 of this entire process (matriculant -> attending physician) and it seems like medical school was quite some time ago at this point. It's a long haul - don't take that time commitment lightly. Without further ado, I present:  Medical school -> Residency!    You'll need to take prereqs for medical school while in undergrad. For most medical schools, that means biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, physics (all of these for 2 semesters with labs), and then a few other things that tend to vary more between schools (calculus, English, etc). While in college, you'll definitely want to keep your GPA up (minimum 3.6, preferably more like 3.8) and do well on the MCAT (30+). Try to get some research published, or at least volunteer in a lab. Get involved with a few things in college for your resume. You definitely need to get some clinical experience as well, usually volunteering at a hospital or shadowing a physician. They want to make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. Anyway, if you do all those things you will get into medical school.  Medical school is basically college on steroids for the first 2 years - lots of lectures and tests followed by more lectures and tests. Grades matter less here, but you still want to get more High Passes (B's) or Honors (A's) than just Passes (C's). After your 2nd year, you'll take Step 1 of the USMLE. It is imperative that you do well on this test. You'll want at least 230 (range on the test is 187 - 270ish), which should leave most specialties open to you. For some perspective, highly competitive specialties like dermatology or plastic surgery average in the 240s or 250s, while less competitive specialties like family med or psych average in the 210s. After that, you'll rotate through all the different departments as a 3rd and 4th year (internal med, surgery, OB/GYN, family, psych, peds) and take some electives as well. This is the time when you figure out what you really want to do in the very broad field of ""medicine.""  As a 4th year, you'll apply to the match. Basically, you get your application together, apply to a bunch of programs, go on a bunch of interviews, and then one day you sit down and rank the programs in order of your preference. The programs do the same with their applicants. All that data is funneled into a computer which generates the ""best"" match - i.e., the one where most people/programs get the program/applicant they want. One day in March, everyone across the country finds out where they matched. Then you chill out for 3-4 months (hooray for vacation time!) and graduate.  After that it's on to residency (with the option of fellowship afterwards), which can last from a minimum of 3 years up to 8+ years, depending on what you go into or if you choose to do a fellowship. As a first year MD, everyone is considered an ""intern."" In some specialties, the first year of internship is also the first year of residency, but for others it's a separate entity. If you have an idea what specialty you're interested in, I can provide more information about the total time commitment involved. That said, here's a broad overview of how long it takes, assuming you do everything you need to do to go straight through.   College (4 years) Medical school (4 years) Internship (1 year) Residency (3-7 years) Fellowship (1-2 years) [optional]"

medicalschool,3dka6i,-QFever-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:58:48 2015 UTC,"Personally I wouldn't study in advance beyond the prep you do for your NMAT. First, the sheer volume of material you cover first year is hard to prepare for. Anything you do on your own probably won't be comparable or similar enough to what you'll learn the first year. Second, you don't want to start med school feeling bored of studying. Give yourself a break from school to recharge. Third, once you start school, you'll adapt to the pace and probably do fine without studying before school starts. Basically, studying beforehand probably won't be that helpful, might set you up for premature burnout, and first year is manageable without a year of prep. Spend your time on other things while you can."

Cut down on everything you can. This means going out to eat, bars, movies. Find cheaper ways to live. Maybe downsize to a smaller apartment. Buy groceries in bulk and then make food that will last several days. Carpool. Look up how to live on a budget. Many people have excellent tips on living well without spending a lot of money. Ask your med school for help. Lot's of times, financial aid will work with you to help you pay for everything. Look for other sources of money. It's not ideal, but you could get personal loans from the bank or ask family members for help. Alternatively, I've heard of med students working at the school library where you basically get to sit there and study the whole time. You get paid to do what you probably would've done anyway.

You have a full time job on each rotation in your clinical duties, and then you have to find time to study. Eating? Sleeping? Sometimes. Sometimes not.

It sounds like you're really interested in a relationship and companionship now and if you put off exploring it this year who's to say you won't do the same third year when life gets even busier. If you want to find someone, it's a pretty big sacrifice to kick that can down the road for the next half a decade or so. Besides, learning how to balance relationships and work during med school will presumably help you be successful balancing them in residency. I got married right before I started school, which is obviously not the same thing, but I'm really glad that I'm getting a handle now on balancing school and a relationship so that I'll be prepared for busier times later down the road. Having an SO in med school can also be an amazing support for you if you pick the right one. I know you're talking about dating, which is different than my scenario, but I really think there is no time like the present if this is something you want. A lot of people get burned out from time to time during this process and I imagine that has to be even more common if you feel like you're completely sacrificing a romantic life for medicine."

Perhaps it's better to try to find a relationship that can endure these stresses than wait for fairer seas?  Interesting side-note: doctor/doctor marriages have a notoriously low divorce rate compared to the general population"
medicalschool,3dhdwj,PoorAuthor9,4,Thu Jul 16 21:02:53 2015 UTC,"If you want to date, date. If you don't want to date, don't date."
medicalschool,3dhdwj,-QFever-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:22:50 2015 UTC,"While I appreciate the reply, this did not really address my central question -- when would the most opportune time be (i.e., when is there the ""least"" amount of worry/stress/work)?"
medicalschool,3dhdwj,not-again-,3,Thu Jul 16 19:48:26 2015 UTC,"there is no opportune time. If dating was something that had to be planned and carefully organized in order to maximize convenience, no one would do it. Generically, you will have more free time in MS1/first half of MS2 and the second half of 4th year. Finding a relationship is something that you can't plan. It's something you have to be open to and then run with it when you find it."
medicalschool,3dhdwj,probably_apocryphal,2,Thu Jul 16 20:26:16 2015 UTC,"That magical time was undergraduate or high school years, even MS1. All normal human being time you have left is MS2."
medicalschool,3dhdwj,jackgucci1,2,Fri Jul 17 05:28:44 2015 UTC,"MS2 is better than MS1 since its more studying and classes and stuff but you should be used to it by now. The end of MS2 will be exhausting because of non-stop STEP1 studying though.  MS3 is hit or miss. During rotations in lighter specialties, you'll have free time when you get home early like 4 or 5 (or like 3 in anesthesiology) but you'll also be responsible for studying cases and studying for the shelf exams. During busy specialties like surgery you will be up by 5am and home late and still have to study, so that does not work for dating as well as you'd hope.  MS4 is more laid back and you're mostly just doing what you'd like, and you have less responsibility behind applying to residency programs, and this would be conducive to dating  However, i personally recommend to start dating now, for happiness and experience and mental sanity. You'll always have time for dates during weekends or whatever, and you really can afford to start now. You dont want to wait and end up regretting it.   And if it leads sonewhere then you can make it work through the busier times"
medicalschool,3dhdwj,monchiz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:58:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  The thing is, I'm genuinely not sure if I'd have time to start now.  I feel like I'd spend a lot of time and mental energy analyzing the dates, worrying about them, etc...  Would it be best to just hold off until MS4?  How does residency workload compare, generally, to MS3?"
medicalschool,3dhdwj,mbahmed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:51:15 2015 UTC,Probably depends on specialty but the general rule I read is that residency is much much busier.
medicalschool,3ddy1i,igotsharingan,47,Wed Jul 15 14:54:42 2015 UTC,"That's cool, I guess. But do we really need more med schools right now?"
medicalschool,3ddy1i,meestermeg,59,Wed Jul 15 16:25:36 2015 UTC,"Lets build a new residency program instead... or ya know, just increase funding"
medicalschool,3ddy1i,GP4LEU,12,Wed Jul 15 16:28:28 2015 UTC,I'd especially like to see more states get in on this. Programs like ECU's Brody School of Medicine that focus on graduating doctors to serve in rural and under served communities should do more to train them post grad too.
medicalschool,3ddy1i,rehtulx,10,Wed Jul 15 16:39:21 2015 UTC,I realize it exists in some places but there needs to be way more aggressive pushes through financial assistance by the school to get people to practice rurally. I'm not saying that school pays off the debt but rather the schools make students more aware of the assistance by practicing rurally as well as getting involved at a state level to try to get more loan forgiveness
medicalschool,3ddy1i,docnotsopc,3,Wed Jul 15 18:30:46 2015 UTC,You can practically get your debt paid off in Arkansas for practicing rurally. It's sorely needed too.
medicalschool,3ddy1i,sgt_science,2,Wed Jul 15 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"You aren't going to get a city kid to practice in the country. You have to recruit people from the communities they are going to serve. Ask any medical director of a rural hospital / rural clinic.

medicalschool,3ddy1i,docnotsopc,24,Thu Jul 16 16:50:20 2015 UTC,I don't understand why new medical schools are allowed when the number of residency positions are still the same and more and more applicants are going unmatched every year.
medicalschool,3ddy1i,TheShaker,15,Wed Jul 15 18:09:58 2015 UTC,Push out the IMGs and replace with USMG. Push out the poor performing USMGs with smart IMGs. Win win situation for healthcare. Sucks for students.
medicalschool,3ddy1i,yell0mell0,17,Wed Jul 15 20:42:58 2015 UTC,Brains don't matter. This is all about the labor market and making doctors expendable employees.
medicalschool,3ddy1i,pancakees,5,Wed Jul 15 20:58:04 2015 UTC,If you don't get into a residency you don't get board certified. The number of eligible docs capable of practicing isn't going to change. You can't fire an attending and hire a unmatched medical school graduate to take their place. New med schools are opening because they can be profitable for already established schools.
medicalschool,3ddy1i,Nociceptors,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:50:32 2015 UTC,Doesn't stop places replacing their doctors with mid levels. A doc that didn't do a residency can still work under someone else.
medicalschool,3ddy1i,pancakees,2,Thu Jul 16 01:20:01 2015 UTC,hence the subpar clinical skills taught in ms1-4 and the focus on basic sciences. The clinical gap between graduated ms4 and attendings is huge
medicalschool,3ddy1i,yell0mell0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:55:26 2015 UTC,Completely agree with you but the quality gap doesn't translate into more $$ in all settings. Its a race to the bottom in many areas not just medicine

medicalschool,3ddy1i,Lukkie,6,Thu Jul 16 00:56:30 2015 UTC,"If the goal is to fill more residency spots with US grads, then sure. There were around 9000 PGY1 spots in last year's match that were not filled by US grads."
medicalschool,3ddy1i,Lukkie,12,Wed Jul 15 22:58:16 2015 UTC,"There is a serious problem with med schools being opened if residency spots are not simultaneously expanded. There are people who have put in 4+ years of hard work, and would be good physicians, who have all that effort and money go to waste because of the residency spot cap. I think its almost unethical to continue to open medical schools given the residency bottleneck. But I'm pretty sure that the motive isn't actually to make more doctors, but to take advantage of what is (for med schools) a fortuitous confluence of extremely high demand for med school positions and effectively unlimited student loans."
medicalschool,3ddy1i,DominantTolerance,6,Wed Jul 15 21:32:09 2015 UTC,There's about 10 000 spots each year not filled by USMD in the match every year. There's plenty of spots to go around still.

medicalschool,3ddy1i,Spicy_Masala,0,Wed Jul 15 22:53:20 2015 UTC,"Is it really money though? Our tuition at my school covers like 5% of the schools total operating budget.

medicalschool,3ddy1i,Chapped_Assets,2,Wed Jul 15 22:49:33 2015 UTC,"Is that what they told you? Look, when schools say that they aren't profiting off medical schools that just means that when everyone who works there is paid and they use money from the tuition for hospital expansions etc the left over money isn't much more than 0. Trust me, every medical school benefits financially from being a medical school"
medicalschool,3ddy1i,Nociceptors,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:56:06 2015 UTC,"I guess I should have clarified. DominantTolerance mentioned unlimited student loans. I'm sure that medical schools bring in loads of money, I just didn't figure it came from we students paying tuition."

The Caribbean schools have way more money than local schools and are slowly pushing a few local schools out of a few of the teaching hospitals.   My schools main hospital used to have barely any foreign med students. Now they are everywhere and even outnumber local med students.   Edit: why am I getting downvoted. Im not saying this is universal. Im aware this is not happening overall in the country. your opinions are not more correct than whats happening in...oh I dont know...real life at the hospital i'm at.  Im a US med student btw. And Yes im talking about rotations, but its pretty evident in the residency classes here as well. We went from a few to more than half the classes being IMG.

medicalschool,3ddy1i,docnotsopc,9,Wed Jul 15 17:56:29 2015 UTC,Im on the fence about this but I'll be completely honest I haven't looked at the numbers recently.  The problem to my understanding lies with not enough residency spots in desirable location's. I assume people can do their residency in small rural  programs can't they? Or am I completely off the mark? I will admit that I fully fall into the group of not willing to do residency in middle or no where
medicalschool,3ddy1i,TibialisAnterior,4,Wed Jul 15 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"The problem is that people tend to practice where they did their residency. So more residency slots in desirable locations is not going to solve the problem of the shortage in undesirable spots. The problem is not residency slots, the problem is that people don't want to practice in those areas, anyway.  The solution to the problem is making those jobs and locations more attractive to people. I don't know the best way to do that."
medicalschool,3ddy1i,ridukosennin,2,Wed Jul 15 21:27:28 2015 UTC,"The solution to the problem is making those jobs and locations more attractive to people. I don't know the best way to do that.   Increase pay in underserved areas, reduce pay in overserved areas?"
medicalschool,3ddy1i,TibialisAnterior,2,Thu Jul 16 00:37:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's quite that simple given that we don't have a central policy maker that sets salaries (not getting into whether that is desirable).  For primary care specialties, pay in less desirable areas is already often twice what it is in more desirable areas, not even considering cost of living differences or enormous loan forgiveness opportunities. I think the problem is more complex to address."
medicalschool,3ddy1i,pancakees,3,Thu Jul 16 01:09:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Desirable locations are pretty saturated with doctors already. Boomers are going to start dying off, there's no real doctor shortage except in BFE and broke people. Don't fancy working with either."
medicalschool,3ddy1i,sgt_science,2,Wed Jul 15 20:57:16 2015 UTC,"I admittedly know nothing about this, but the constant emails from the AMA sure make it seem like there needs to be more residency spots. Although I'm sure they have other motives."

medicalschool,3ddy1i,beethovenshair,5,Wed Jul 15 23:44:11 2015 UTC,"A similar thing is happening on Australia- despite internship shortages and vehement opposition on national, state and local levels the government approved funding for a new medical school at Curtin uni in Western Australia.   It's become a bit of a joke within the medical student community though because their student union is going to have to choose between CUMS and CUMSoc as a name and turn up to a national convention where everyone will hate them."
medicalschool,3ddy1i,PennyTrait,2,Wed Jul 15 23:38:52 2015 UTC,"omg CUMSoc  yeah they wanted one at Charles Sturt that every medsoc opposed. And it's not just the intern tsunami, it's getting training positions for your PGY3 year. it's just getting impossible unless you start building a CV in med school and applying to do a Masters in your JMO year."
medicalschool,3ddy1i,beethovenshair,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:33:19 2015 UTC,Hey! As a pre-clin still I didn't know about the issues with PGY3 year! How would you recommend we build CVs in med school?
medicalschool,3ddy1i,PennyTrait,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:12:59 2015 UTC,"It depends on what training programme you want to get into, and also what hospital you're at (they all do things a little different - eg. if you want to do crit care, some you start in PGY3, some in PGY2). The more competitive, the better your CV needs to be, and it's often in a points-based system (eg. a published paper is x points, a diploma is y points) when you apply. I was talking to an Intensivist who said they had a great candidate for a crit care PGY3 year, but his CV was bare, so they couldn't give him the job over others.  A really, really good place to look at is Map My Career - it's made by NSW Health but obviously all the colleges are national so the stats are somewhat translatable. You can plug in a few specialties you're interested in, and compare the average salaries, and if the training programmes are over- or undersubscribed (to get an idea on how hard they are to get into).  Pretty much every specialty is getting competitive, even GP. But things like Path and Psych are always undersubscribed.  edit: sorry I realised I didn't really answer your question! getting your name on stuff getting published is a great start, if you're on a rotation that interests you, ask if anyone is doing any audits or something that you can do some grunt work like some data mining/entry. Or write up interesting case reports with a senior as your supervisor. I've been advised to get my Advanced Trauma Life Support either before or during my JMO year. Also it's all about gaming your PGY1-2 rotations to get you towards the specialty you're into. If you want to do Paeds, try to get Paeds rotations or ED terms in a hospital that has Paeds referrals.  Also, get your face known by the Regs/Bosses. I've been told ""treat every uni placement like a job interview"". Turn up, be keen, help out. The junior docs will be senior docs and will remember you."

medicalschool,3ddy1i,icevermin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:01:02 2015 UTC,"Well the average DO doesn't take the USMLE, and even then the ones that do tend to pass. I can't find more specific statistics but anecdotally I know a person each MD and DO who got the same score on the USMLE.

I mostly used it to read up on things I saw with my patients. For example, if you are a brand new 3rd year on medicine wards and you admit a patient with acute pancreatitis, and you don't know how to manage it, you can look up ""management of acute pancreatitis"" on UpToDate and it will lay it all out for you. This way when you write your H&P and present your patient, you at least have some idea what to write under ""Assessment/Plan"".   It's also super helpful if you have to make a presentation on a topic, since it covers a lot of topics a lot of detail. Most attendings/residents won't like it if you cite UpToDate as a reference in your presentation, but UpToDate has its own references that you can read and cite in your presentation."

medicalschool,3dfvsk,OhHeyBaron,4,Thu Jul 16 03:42:12 2015 UTC,"I rotated at a site without surgery residents and, yeah, pretty much what you said. The biggest thing is to be an active learner, be involved, and offer to help out as much as possible (if you care about that rotation at least). Also nurses/medics/surgical techs are huge helps if you get on their good side. Since there are no residents that the attendings pal around with, they have much stronger relationships with other hospital staff. Be friendly and helpful to them and they will put in a good word for you."
medicalschool,3dfvsk,RedEM43,2,Thu Jul 16 00:44:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I did that for 3 rotations and got solid LOR from each of them. Just be proactive, work hard and willing to learn. Sure they are busy, but they make time for the student. In that case the nurses can really help too. I honestly really count on the nurses that are taking caring of the patients I have.   Plus you get access to the doctors lounge, huge plus."
medicalschool,3dfvsk,ronin521,2,Thu Jul 16 01:41:58 2015 UTC,I did a short surgery rotation at a private hospital without any residents of their own. They had one visiting resident while I was there.

Damn, he was consistently in the top ten percent of everything he did, actually top 6 percent if you remove the one time he got that 91st percentile. He had amazing references, research and interviews. He was told to his face that his Caribbean education was holding him back. It wasn't apparently common knowledge for him. It wasn't for me either, until I read this. I was quite close to going there myself and I have a few friends that are seriously contemplating it (Which reminds me, I have to share this blog with them).  He wasn't crying or whining, the blog felt more like advice to other students that are contemplating going to the Caribbean for medical school (Especially if they have surgery in mind). He says so himself, ""I am here to give my subjective first hand experience and provide access to the NRMP match data. I want to reach the version of me either getting ready to go or just arriving at a Caribbean medical school.   If I knew half of this blog 4 years ago, I would be a happy man today. "" That didn't seem like whining to me. Yes, sometimes he does say how his life sucks because of that experience, but wouldn't you.   What I think is actually clownish is asking a bunch of internet strangers about a website which, you could have figured out yourself, was worthy of your money or not. Seriously, I can see you posting a question on a fashion reddit asking if you should buy a particular shirt or not?"

I was quite close to going there myself and I have a few friends that are seriously contemplating it    If you go to the Caribbean with dreams of going into any of the top 5 competitive specialties, it's your own fault when you don't match. All it takes is to go on the school's website and see previous Match lists. They're not hidden. Scan down to the specialty you want and you'll see how often they match into it. Saying ""I didn't know my school never matches into Ortho"" is your own fault. Why would you take a $400k risk without doing ~10-15 minutes of research on the school first? Seriously, how is that the school's fault? Find me a current Carib school advertising ""Look at all of our Ortho and Derm residents and look how successful they are"" or a school advertising, ""Look at all these residents we placed into Yale, Columbia, Hopkins, Harvard, Mass Gen"" and I'll eat humble pie. But when you go on their website and see a bunch of testimonials from FM, IM, Peds, Psych, Neuro who matched at semi/less-competitive places, realize how dumb this argument is. Going to a Big4 Carib school and matching those specialities is very common. You acting like it's not common is just blatant disregard for facts. Lastly, you seem to be pretty stuck on this surgery argument. Is it easy to match gen surg from a Carib school? Absolutely not. Can it be done if you bust your ass? Without a doubt. Look at any of the Big4 match lists and you'll see surgery every year. ""But, but, but, but they're at less competitive sites. And and, and, and also a lot of them are just prelim spots so that's not a guaranteed full surgery residency."" No shit. No one is arguing that. I'm just saying pump the brakes a bit. The original blog posted is a gross exaggeration.    I just want to provide access to NRMP match information.   Since when is that information not readily available on the NRMP website. It's literally the second link that comes up on google. Again, <5-10 minutes of googling provides you with all of the information you need.    What I think is actually clownish is asking a bunch of internet strangers about a website which, you could have figured out yourself, was worthy of your money or not.   Lol. Really? That statement could be applied to 90% of questions on this site. ""How do I study for Step 1? How do I study for Step 2? What did you use to study for the Peds shelf?"" These questions could all be easily googled, yet people would rather hear up to date personal experiences rather than read blogs for hours and freak themselves out. Weak argument."

I don't know for sure how that would be viewed, but I can't imagine that it would look as well as a straight up attending letter. And everyone's letters are going to be gushing, so imo its mainly about making sure the letters don't hurt your application rather than the letters making the app."

I know you're right, but I was really hoping this would be my strongest letter because I know the resident has nothing but nice things to say about me.

medicalschool,3dgnpi,hamm3rhand,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:17:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah generic probably > cosigned. Or just try to ask someone else who could write you a strong letter. If i was a program director, a cosigned letter would look like they either didn't actually work with the student and so it was worthless, or they didn't care enough about them to write it, in which case i'd have to wonder why.

Especially applicable on wards. Levity aside, I strongly encourage you to write a journal entry or a letter to yourself describing your feelings right now. You seem like a really earnest person who will become a great doctor, but there will be times in med school when you question why you're doing this, and having a written reminder from yourself is a powerful thing.

medicalschool,3ddnx4,Cornpop_Cat,3,Wed Jul 15 20:16:46 2015 UTC,"I remember my first week. Ended up suture tech-ing in one of the local hospitals trauma wards on my first Thursday of classes. I saw a lady with a through-and-through gun shot wound in her calf. The place was hopping so the docs/techs/nurses/everyone shooed me over there saying ""talk to her until we get to her"".   Looking back the damage (as far as gunshots go) was pretty chill. In and out, no major arteries hit, no fractures, nothing except two nickel sized holes and some blood.  But at the time I didn't know jack shit about medicine.   First question she asks, ""Am I going to be OK?"" I had no clue. I looked at the right leg...compared it to the left...talked to her about how they looked similar and how there's not much blood so I thought that things looked OK so far.  I was taken aback about the power I was given. No life story, no history/physical exam. Just ""Am I going to be OK?"". That's all she wanted.   People are going to trust you. They (quite literally) may not realize that you're the newest newbie on new street. They know they're terrified, bleeding, and in a crazy trauma ward where a gunshot is put below 11 other patients.   Please don't ever betray that trust and do the best you can with what you know.  Oh, and if you don't know then just find someone and ask. My situation was a bit unique where all the other staff were VERY busy with other patients. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  Keep up the good work, and keep writing."

I busted my ass, up every morning at 4, always making sure I stayed late if I was needed, read up on everything the pgy1-pgy4's asked me to, always ready for rounds and my following up on my patients, etc. I thought there was no way I wasn't getting honors.   But guess what.. The evaluations for all students were done by the pgy5 chief resident.. Who no one ever saw or worked with because he only operated in another department while he was getting ready for his fellowship next year. And he just gives all students passes because he doesn't know anyone and couldn't tell one student from the other..   It's just the way it is. And it's horrible and will drive you crazy. Unfortunately you just have to put your head down and get ready for the next rotation."

medicalschool,3dfn4k,rufaterd,2,Thu Jul 16 03:39:11 2015 UTC,Your school should have a syllabus that defines how to get honors
medicalschool,3dfn4k,asclepius42,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:15:41 2015 UTC,"It is vague to the point of being useless, essentially stating that it consists of a combination of subjective evaluations and examination grades. A few rotations provide more detailed breakdowns, but this was not one of them."
medicalschool,3dfn4k,SolarianXIII,2,Wed Jul 15 22:17:55 2015 UTC,"I remember my first rotation third year. It was awesome, I was doing inpatient IM with a doc double boarded in IM and GI, so lots of interesting liver and pancreas pathology as well as some cool IM cases. I worked hard, I learned everything he asked me to. I made mistakes sure but it was my first month so I figured it would be OK. I was hoping for honors, but figured it wouldn't happen just because the clinical side was all so new. Get my evaluation back and what should I see in the comment section? ""I don't think u/asclepius42 realizes that he's actually going to be a doctor. He's completely hopeless."" And that's third year. Two months later I had a doctor tell me he liked me so much and was so impressed that if I wrote a LOR he would sign it no questions asked. Welcome to clinical education my friend."
medicalschool,3ddro5,quizzitive,6,Wed Jul 15 14:03:35 2015 UTC,"Gonna vary depending on your class, generally stick to studying your syllabus/lectures- now for the shelf I recommend Pathoma + this question book http://www.amazon.com/Robbins-Cotran-Review-Pathology-Edition/dp/1416049304."

medicalschool,3ddro5,Sir_Percivall_Pott,3,Wed Jul 15 19:25:00 2015 UTC,Brosencephalon Anki + Pathoma + Robbins Qs =  Honors in Pathology.
medicalschool,3ddro5,Sir_Percivall_Pott,2,Wed Jul 15 21:18:49 2015 UTC,I downloaded the Brosencephalon Anki decks but it seems they have an ungodly amount of cards ~200+ for some chapters. How did you manage to fit them in your study routine?
medicalschool,3ddro5,who_hah,6,Wed Jul 15 21:39:17 2015 UTC,"That's basically the only way I studied. I did not read textbooks, take detailed notes, or anything. I would attend lecture (sometimes) or watch lectures at 1.5-2x (more often) and watch Pathoma. Once I did that, I would go through Bros. anki cards for 5+ hours a day. It only works if you resist the urge to ""read through your notes to review"" or do anything like that. Towards the end of a organ system, I would do every question I could get my hands on to help tie things together.  It worked really well for me but your mileage may vary as it does take a lot of time (however it's worth mentioning that I have a significant other and I go to the gym and for runs 5 days a week so if it is regularly taking you >10 hours/day to do this then you are doing something wrong). Your best bet is consistency. Study every single day even if it's just for a few hours."

I didn't really use the american resources (pathoma and videos). But focusing on histopathology really gave me an advantage in my core knowledge base.

medicalschool,3d9gvg,TibialisAnterior,11,Wed Jul 15 02:31:16 2015 UTC,"I dunno, this sounds more like the ""mito"" (mitochondrial disease) crazy. Mito, POTS, and a host of other rare disorders are favorites of the factitious/munchausen's by proxy parents/patients.  Parent decides kid has POTS -> confines kid to bed rest for months -> kid physically decompensates, loses weight -> kid gets postural hypotension/tachycardia -> goes doc shopping -> winds up at big famous children's hospital -> sees world's expert in POTS -> not convinced -> continues shopping, child remains confined to bed rest  Lady has history of high medical use, increasing opiate dependence, pelvic pain refractory to multiple endometriosis surgeries -> gets pregnant -> has child -> tells her PCP the kid is diagnosed with mitochondrial disease -> ""finds out"" she has it, too, per world's expert on the other side of the country -> ""mitochondrial disease"" in chart -> gets extensive, invasive workup for every little complaint -> every line gets infected -> after multiple PCP changes, astute new PCP contacts world's expert, finds out world's expert didn't diagnose patient or her daughter with mitochondrial disease, documents in chart -> no one cares, patient continues to get unnecessary care.

medicalschool,3d9gvg,watluxid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:15:27 2015 UTC,"Ugh, as a patient with suspected mito who is in fact working with a metabolic geneticist, I hate these stories because the parents in them make life harder for patients who actually do have energy metabolism problems. I wish I could show those people just how much this disease, whatever it truly is, has stolen from me and how much I would give to trade places with them and never have to set foot in a doctor's office again, to be able to hike and swim and ride horses again, to be able to just go on an overnight trip without packing up multiple bags of medical equipment and drugs, to not be tied to a rehab chair and ventilator. I feel so bad for those children.  That said, a lot of actual patients with mito have so-called soft signs in family members, and the brain takes a metric fucktonne of ATP. My amateur observation from support groups is that a certain flavor of crazy is disproportionately common among mito parents/family compared to the rest of the population; having a child who's sick with a progressive, often fatal disease that requires a large team of specialists exacerbates any underlying tendencies that your brain has towards poor executive function or other cognitive problems.  I guess all I'm saying is that I identify with the frustration you have with parents who do this to their kids, but please remember that just because they're crazy, or their parents are crazy, doesn't mean they're not sick.  The incidence of medical child abuse is estimated to be on the order of 1 in 100,000, while the incidence of mito is estimated at 1 in 5000."

During your chill time, DO NOT think about what other people are doing and do not think that you should be studying. You need to stay sane and relaxed. Focus on efficient studying, not studying a long time.  You may have to change the way you study, but that's what everyone does at med school goes on.   You will be fine. Don't worry.

Additionally, to the OP, I truly believe that you can't be an effective caregiver to your future patients if you do not take care of yourself. I know it is terrifying to follow a nontraditional path to get through med school but 5, 10 years from now I think this may be something you are glad you did. No one in your class will think any less of you for taking a LOA, and those who happen to do, are not worth caring about. Realizing you are not in the best mental state right now and reaching out for help takes a lot of strength and is something that should be admired.   Immerse your self in other passions you have and you will gain your confidence back. It will only be a waste of a few months if you let it be. Spend time with family and friends. Spending time with friends from outside of school in particular will help you escape the bubble med school and help you gain perspective about your situation. I wish you the best of luck!"

Its true, i havent been taking care of myself as well as i usually do.   Alot of people are saying i should do just 6 weeks and that its plenty of time, and others are saying i should to the entire semester and seek some treatment.  i have decided to be safe, and decide on my condition come september whether or not i should wait and get more time.  ...not to self, stay away from studentdoctornetwork and valuemd for advice. because its not mentally healthy. heh."
medicalschool,3ddphf,WarriorHealer,2,Wed Jul 15 23:34:51 2015 UTC,Just go out and do it.   That's not how depression works.
medicalschool,3ddphf,badbluemoon,2,Thu Jul 16 02:38:28 2015 UTC,"I'm concerned that you are only giving yourself 6 weeks to get better. Your health doesn't operate on a timeline - it takes the time it takes. If you are starting a treatment program/plan, then it may take longer than 6 weeks to feel the full effects and get you back to where you need to be.   I know you said you'd feel bored and useless, but you can use that time for recharging - and more importantly, for finding an identity that isn't linked just to med school. Maybe take up a hobby while you're out - something that you can learn in this time away that gives you a sense of accomplishment and pride outside of your identity as a student.   If you've had trouble with grades and knowledge retention, then you can also use this time to go back and read things that you might feel weaker in. Maybe your biochem has always tripped you up - now is a good time to re-read that material and strengthen that base. The time is only boring and useless if you let it be.   Your confidence will build as you find an identity that isn't tied to just school and grades, and it's very important that you sort that out. You should reach out for some sort of help or therapy to get through your depression, stress, and anxiety, and identify ways that you can help yourself stay calm and positive throughout the rest of your education and into residency.   There's a lot of work that you can do on a medical LOA, and I hope you use the time well - and I hope you use enough of it."

Would you be happy as a cosmetic surgeon working with people who might be superficial, but where don't have to treat diabetes and other lifestyle diseases? Orthopedics, where you can tailor your practice to a relatively healthy patient population but where you're treating accidents (stupidity) and people with chronic problems like arthritis that often is the result of over/misuse? And where people will keep abusing those joints if you give them an injection, for example? ENT, where you might be able to tailor your practice to patients who are sick through no fault of their own, but may have chronic problems that can be extremely frustrating.  Maybe a future in litigation? Insurance companies contract doctors to, for example, discredit plaintiffs in personal injury claims. Like if someone gets into a car accident and sues for medical bills, the opposing insurance will contract a doctor to examine them in case they're lying or exaggerating, or otherwise can't factually substantiate the injury. You could work in rescission for disability claims (people who file for disability and then go cliff diving or whatever, the government hires private investigators to prosecute them for fraud), stuff like that. Probably opportunities with private companies and the government (i.e. medicare) to investigate fraud, malpractice, etc.  FWIW I kind of share some of your opinions but it's a rough way to go through life.

medicalschool,3dcawb,summerissoclose,4,Wed Jul 15 03:50:18 2015 UTC,"Well you should probably buy step 1, which is 590 dollars. Usually your school gives you instructions on that in the fall.   Other than that, it looks like you're going to buy full year subs for uworld and usmle-rx. Why not just get each for 6 months if you really want to use them for the entire year? I personally didn't use qbanks until second semester. I bought the 3 month for both uworld and usmle-rx which saved me a ton of money and I got the score i wanted.   Sketchy micro is amazing and it's 100 dollars. You can split the subscription between a few friends. I think 2 Nbme exams should be enough, and get the Uworld package with the 2 practice exams as well. The uworld practice exams can overestimate your score a bit, but the difficulty is spot on with the actual step test. The nbmes are much easier (i.e. you need >90% to get a 260 with nbme whereas in uworld self assessment ~80% correct is a 260), but i feel they are better are predicting your actual score.   As for textbooks and the like, try to get them from M3s or get the pdfs off of other people. Robbins pathology is useful for reference and BRS can be useful for stuff like anatomy and biochem. Personally I like watching videos more so I just borrowed kaplan videos from a friend."

medicalschool,3dcawb,red_city,0,Wed Jul 15 04:38:54 2015 UTC,Outside of lecture materials I literally only used Pathoma before the dedicated step 1 study period. Did very well in classes & step 1. So many people use way too many resources - in my opinion that just makes things a lot harder than they have to be.   Edit: also used the Utah path website for practice questions before an exam. Free
medicalschool,3dcawb,LeeHarvey_Teabag,2,Wed Jul 15 20:20:24 2015 UTC,"If you have any interest in DIT for the dedicated study period, it can be pretty pricey. If your school has a vendor fair they'll give a promo code for 150-ish off but it can still end up being around 750 after taxes and mandatory shipping. The videos are out there from previous years on torrent sites so I'd recommend watching a few to make sure they fit your learning style before you take the plunge. It's more or less true what they say -- the course essentially ""reads first aid to you"" but if you aren't a textbook person (me) I think it can be pretty helpful.   Edit: Also, NBME exams cost 50 or 60 each depending if you want ""expanded feedback"" for the extra 10 dollars. For the extra money it'll tell you what questions you got wrong but it won't give you the right answers."
medicalschool,3dcawb,SimonSezary,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:48:46 2015 UTC,"I would definitely only get Uworld for 3 or 6 months, using such a great resource before your dedicated study period is kind of a waste.

(thats what I tell myself anyhow).   1) I bought myself a cheap kettle for around £5 and stored that in my locker along with a mug and a bowl. Then I would have a selection of teas, instant coffee, ramen noodles and tins of soup (uni had a microwave).   This way I saved money on drinks (if you don't mind the downgrade of instant coffee, you actually save a lot of money from buying coffee) and you can make a quick lunch if you forgot it/couldn't be bothered to make it that morning instead of having to pay for over-priced sandwiches.   2) Reduced foods are also a good friend to have. Figure out when your local supermarkets reduce the price of the about-to-expire foods and visit them. You might have to hang around in the aisles for a little bit (I just put on a podcast or something), but you can get meat really cheap (50 to 90% off dependent on the time/supermarket) and just freeze what you buy. Also works for other things, which is a great way to learn new recipes - for example, I got some fennel that was 90% off and having never cooked with that ingredient before, learnt a nice fennel soup recipe.   3) Alcohol. Alcohol is expensive, but you are a student, so its part of the lifestyle I guess and its nice to let loose every once in a while. Never buy drinks while out in a club - always pre-drink with friends at someone's place before going out. Its much cheaper plus its also a lot more sociable (you can play party games/chat about random things, while actually hearing what people are saying).   4) Depending on how school is going for you and what kind of person you are, you could get a job, but be aware that burning the candle from both ends might not be beneficial. Unless its a job related to your studies in some way (tutor, HCA, writing up notes digitally for a GP surgery), I wouldn't recommend it - but again, its up to what kind of person you are. Working over the summer holidays is a great time to earn money though and thats how I save up some in case I hit a rough patch along the year.   5) Another way to get money is participating in studies. My uni has a psychology department that offer financial rewards for being a subject. Its nothing major (only like £5-10), but its nice all the same and the things they get you to do are fun as well - one time I was in a f-MRI responding to questions on a screen - was quite cool. Additionally, though i have no experience in this, you could sign up for clinical trails as a healthy volunteers, but thats at your own discretion   6) Last thing is to stay positive! Even your your finances are tight, they hopefully aren't going to stay that way for the rest of your life. So think of it an investment for the future and you should be golden (even if your wallet isn't)."
medicalschool,3dbspk,MouseyMedic,2,Wed Jul 15 08:15:16 2015 UTC,I sell plasma. I actually get some decent studying done since I am trapped with my flashcards for a couple of hours and I can make up to $200 a month. I meal plan and cook meals for the week on Sundays to save money. I also use the app Mint to track my spending. I look at living social and groupon for deals when I am desperate to go out. I also have gotten creative in spending time with my friends. 2 buck chuck and a potluck picnic in the park instead of an expensive meal out and so on. And you know I steal toilet paper/paper towels from the school so there's that.

If the meeting seems serious, enter at your own risk lol.  make your own coffee and food whenever possible. When I need to buy food (especially for lunch), I usually walk over to the hospital cafeteria since the food is cheaper there compared to the school's cafeteria.  Whenever I need to buy coffee (i prefer Starbucks), i always ask for a grande coffee in a venti cup. I pay the price for a grande (roughly $2.25) and the barista always gives me a venti's cup worth of coffee (415mg of caffeine so one venti cup usually gets me through the day)."

You're just starting college...you will have plenty of opportunities to improve your social skills by the time you are ready to apply for medical school. And if you still have some degree of social anxiety/ineptitude, who cares? You can still make it through medical school and then residency with the basic social skills to take a medical history and give orders to a nurse. You won't be alone either, there are plenty of slightly neurotic, socially awkward docs out there!"
medicalschool,3de84k,Jezzine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:27:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose it's a pretty normal thing to be anxious about. My anxiety factors in when I anticipate the event even weeks before and get symptoms when I so much as think about it :( There have been many times in the past where I've altogether avoided or even taken 0's because it's too hard for me to force myself to do the presentation for fear of (in my mind) embarrassing myself.  This was actually really helpful for me, though, because I need to be reminded that my class won't be a bunch of perfect, extremely intelligent and resilient people that I'll be struggling to keep up with, haha. That's a really grounding thing for me to remember. Thank you. :)"
medicalschool,3de84k,who_hah,3,Wed Jul 15 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the clinical years and beyond but you are unlikely to be frequently asked to present to large groups of people during first and second year. It might vary from school to school but unless you're seeking out public speaking opportunities, most likely you will almost never present to 10+. As you mentioned, you're not uncomfortable with speaking in front of small groups which is what you are more likely to do. Besides, you're young and you'll have way more opportunities to get comfortable in front of an audience during undergrad. I definitely wouldn't let this deter you."

It has been shown to be successful in treating these issues without the need for medications. Also, they can offer you some healthy coping mechanisms for stressful times (which I admit there will be a lot of in your medical career). And like others said, you are still young and can grow out of this. Try not to over think things and do your best in school! Good luck! :)"

medicalschool,3de84k,Henipah,2,Wed Jul 15 19:20:37 2015 UTC,"I was diagnosed with Generalized anxiety in college that sort of leaned towards social anxiety especially around people of power/importance, like a standardized patient, powerful intimidating professionals, etc.... I took medication which helped me a lot.  I am no longer on any medication.  During my first standardized patient interview I was so fucking nervous. I failed it badly. But you know what? The best way to get over an anxiety inducing event is to introduce yourself to that event over and over again. Eventually I got better and better at patient interviews. Now, having to do a standardized patient interview is no biggie.  I did have to present to an audience of 100+ people with my group of 9 classmates. We presented our respective parts and answered questions. That was tough, but I did it. If i was assigned to do it again then I am confident I would be better than last time. Just gotta throw yourself into those kinda situations to improve  tl;dr - yes you might have some anxiety in medical school but it is good for you and you will adapt"
medicalschool,3d9pwg,NomDeRedditor,8,Tue Jul 14 16:28:56 2015 UTC,"Complications are always a risk, and all you are going to hear here are anecdotes which might make you feel better, but won't help you accurately gauge risk. You should have plenty of time to recover like you said.  Dealing with unresolved medical issues once you've started is arguably a worse way to start off on the wrong foot.  And in the off-chance you develop complications that would warrant/necessitate an extended period of recovery, the school should grant you a deferral.  Might be worth it to pay up for a good second opinion and let them evaluate your symptoms/sinuses instead of the other provider's diagnosis."

The doctors that get remembered the most are the ones that diagnose something others don't catch--and that often comes from having listened to the patient and asked good questions.  The other ones that get remembered are the ones that treat their patients like human beings that have real value, regardless of what they've done or what they're suffering from or how horribly boring it actually is to be in the room with them.

Luckily his debt load isn't bad since his parents paid for a lot of it.

medicalschool,3d73kz,realitystrive,8,Tue Jul 14 06:16:13 2015 UTC,"There is always the option (if you qualify) of joining the Navy. They do something called a GMO or general Medical Officer where you basically act as a family med doc for a group of people you are assigned to. Then after 3 years of that you apply to residency and the extra time gives you extra ""points."" You end up owing time for the residency (usually one year for every year of residency) so the total time in the military including GMO is 9 years for most BUT you are a board certified doctor at the end of the day. I guess it depends how much you want it."
medicalschool,3d73kz,Beaudasious,9,Tue Jul 14 10:21:19 2015 UTC,"To do a GMO you need to complete at least an intern year (TY year or Transitional Year is what these are called in the service), and pass all 3 steps for a license and then you can practice as a GMO.  Unlikely the Navy will take a civilian who didn't match and commission them and then let them into a TY program. There are plenty to USUHS and HPSP grads who take the TY spots and also the GMO slots because they have to in the Navy.  If you didn't join the service as HPSP or got accepted into USUHS, you really can't join again until you're a board certified attending level physician.   Edit: there's a Financial Assistance Program that will take civilian residents who want to become staff attendings in the medical corps. But again you gotta match first."
medicalschool,3d73kz,thisisntnamman,3,Tue Jul 14 10:39:38 2015 UTC,With the FAP they take people after med school who've successfully matched. Some like it because unlike the HPSP you're guaranteed a civilian residency. Everything else you said is correct.   USUHS looks dope by the way.

Of us 180, when asked, only 10 said they were interested in IM, 2 in pathology, 1 in neurology, 1 FM and 5 in pediatrics.  The other 161 were about evenly split between neurosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery, derm, ophthalmo, other surgical specialties.  I was trying really hard not to crush anyone's dreams, but based on my experience, i feel that most IMG/FMGs have never even once glanced at the match stats, apply to ridiculous residencies, and then fail to match for years or at all. Luckily for me, im in love with IM. But i felt really bad for my colleagues whos dream was neurosurg or other competitive spots, and knowing thehll they'll most likely end up FM or IM and hate their lives."

Going overseas, I knew I had a fart's chance in the wind of getting anything out of primary care but that was what my impression of medicine was to begin with. And not having done rotations yet, I still don't have a strong idea of what other specialties do what it entails. So I guess that's good in a way.   I too had students that were shooting for rads and neurosurgery. It's one thing if they were saying this as their noses were buried in a book but that wasn't the case. So there's delusion, and then there's whatever the hell that was. Maybe their parents are PDs at those programs and I just don't know it.   But when reading  Charting the Outcomes, I spend a long time in FM and IM sections and begin and end my wistful thinking there. I check out derm and anesth and surgery just for a chuckle at just how hard the IMGs that matched at most of those programs had to knock it out the park with their scores and interviews.

Most of the patients at my hospital have poops that smell like--it's not roses--maybe a combination of lilac and white lilly? It's funny, I was actually just discussing the generally pleasant smell of the hospital with one of my patients as we walked to the trash can to throw his cigarettes away (he's giving them up after I told him they increase his chance of lung disease). He was especially impressed at the fine smell of our unit given that last week several of the patients who are at risk for heart disease organized an in-hospital exercise class that has them jogging through the hallways and working up quite a sweat.   So after I walked him back to his room, I checked in on his labs and saw that his HIV was clearing up nicely and my resident told me that I'd done good work that day and seeing as it was already pushing noon, I might as well head home and nap for a couple hours until it was late enough that society would deem it appropriate for me to grab a beer or two. When I got home, there was only one email in my inbox (from my school, letting me know they'd cancelled the shelf) so I decided that with studying no longer a concern, I'd follow my nap up with a beer and then have my butler helicopter me over to the white house for dinner with the president.   Sweet smelling poops. Lol."

The timeline for when MD students can apply into osteopathically focused residencies has yet to be set by what is now the new ACGME. You might possibly see a single match by the time you graduate, but again the timeline was not specifically spelled out in the memorandum of understanding in the initial agreement, or even discussed formally for that matter."
medicalschool,3d7nhg,syncopal,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:27:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! When you say a single match, does that mean DO students would have the opportunity to apply to what are currently ""MD residencies""? That would inevitably equate to at least some degree of an increase in competition, correct?"
medicalschool,3d7nhg,rover47,2,Wed Jul 15 05:00:04 2015 UTC,No problem! This topic can be super confusing and lots of people speak with limited knowledge. I ttoally get how.easy it can be to get lost. Currently DO students can apply into allopathoc residency slots. Some programs are much more accepting than others are biases (especially in the cutting specialties) still exist. What this changes (with respect to match ...eventually) is two fold.   1) allopathic students will be able to apply to oeteopathically focuses residency slots after they complete a to be determined set of prerequisites demonstrating understanding of osteopathic principles.  2) combine NMS and NRMP information a single system and unified match (time line and details not officially announced).  I hope that helps!

If the whole point is to merge everything so everyone gets the same post-graduate training, why even have 2 degrees to begin with?"
medicalschool,3d7nhg,improvemedawg6,5,Tue Jul 14 12:17:56 2015 UTC,"It benefits MD students because they can now also apply to former ""DO only"" residencies, which means higher chances of matching."
medicalschool,3d7nhg,lramire3,2,Tue Jul 14 12:46:57 2015 UTC,"DOs comprise approximately 20% of the US medical school graduate population now.  You don't see why the ACGME would rather be in charge of GME for 100% versus 80% of the population?  I'm glad this happened, but this was a power move by the ACGME that only happened after the threat of withholding ACGME fellowship opportunities for AOA residency graduates.    Plus I can't see how it could be a bad thing to standardize residency accreditation for all GME in this country.  Duplication is costly and unnecessary, and frankly (as a DO myself) the AOA side needs a little cleaning up anyways."
medicalschool,3d7nhg,adenocard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:07:50 2015 UTC,"This is how I like to think of it. This year is the first year in the country that there are more NP/PA students graduating than MD/DO students. There is a major shift in the politics of healthcare and the methods by which healthcare is delivered. Both the ACGME and AOA recognized this and the need to unite as primarily physicians to stand as a unified physician voice within this new climate of healthcare.   The major agreement includes items that allow people in the osteopathic tract to retain their core principles and ideals while still falling under this umbrella. Mind you this was a unanimous vote by the ACGME board to allow DO representatives now occupy some seats. Additionally, just as an FYI, there was recently an RC (residency committee) created for the practice of NMM (Neuromuscular manipulative medicine) which utilizes OMM. This was the first subspecialty accepted by ACGME in over 25 years. Times are definitely changing, and unfortunately it's mostly invisible to people who don't actively look at it. I urge you to reach out to your respective body (AOA or AMA) and see what you can do to get involved if you find this stuff remotely interesting."
medicalschool,3d7nhg,syncopal,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:32:04 2015 UTC,"The major agreement includes items that allow people in the osteopathic tract to retain their core principles and ideals while still falling under this umbrella.    Call me jaded, but all I saw in that ""retention of core principles"" stuff was an attempt to maintain power and access to DO dollars.  ""DO distinctiveness"" is a commercial concept that needlessly maintains a parallel medical system in this country that enriches and empowers a large group of people.  If you think keeping the COMLEX separate from the USMLE is about anything other than money than you're kidding yourself.  The rest follows from there.  The fact of the matter is, most DO graduates don't feel distinct, don't want to be distinct, and are represented by an organization that is purposely obtuse to that reality."
medicalschool,3d7nhg,adenocard,0,Wed Jul 15 10:17:47 2015 UTC,"It benefits everybody. The AOA is notorious for (no) low standards at residency programs. With the ACGME being strict about it, everybody is guaranteed at least the minimum for their residency training.   Hopefully this leads to the LCME cracking down on DO schools, but that's unlikely."
medicalschool,3d7nhg,icevermin,3,Tue Jul 14 19:43:03 2015 UTC,"This is entirely false. The standards are different to allow for rural programs to exist. In the capacity and funding they have at these sites where healthcare is neglected the ACGME standards would never be able to be supported by these programs. ACGME programs are focused more on rural programs and their standards reflect those needs. Please feel free to educate yourself on the standards here: http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/Education/postdoctoral-training/Pages/default.aspx . For comparison you can look at ACGME standards which have most of the same core principles: https://www.acgme.org/acgmeweb/tabid/429/ProgramandInstitutionalAccreditation/CommonProgramRequirements.aspx  Also regardless of single accreditation LCME has nothing to do with osteopathic school accreditation. That has, and will remain under purview of the COCA. I'm not sure where you got your information, but please recheck your sources and learn a bit about the topic before speaking complete falsehoods and blatantly demonstrating you have no idea about how the system works."

I see where you're coming from but your perspective might change when you actually see some of these programs on ""away"" rotations.  Also it's worth considering that this ""rural"" theme is more of a strategic move than an altruistic one.  The AOA has significantly fewer residency spots then there are DO graduates, and you have to keep in mind how that creates a significant pressure to expand AOA residency programs as fast as possible (sometimes at the expense of quality)."

I can tell you, though, that if you're a US medstudent and you're super paranoid about not being able to weed out the ultra materialistic bimbo who's end-game is to wait out the next 2 years of your medschool and the entirety of your residency, then perhaps just take a look at your own life and what kinds of people you're choosing to spend time with?    Idk, to be honest.  In my experience (anecdotal, but here it is), I've only run into 2 girls who seemed to only be concerned about the ""benefits"" of dating a doctor-to-be.  In both cases I spotted them coming from a mile away, and in both cases they were so unbelievably immature that I'm not sure why anyone in their own peer group would wanna date them.

First, there is a difference in how you learn clinically vs preclinically. Yes, you can get a textbook and read it through, chapter by chapter, if organization is essential to you, but this isn't how the bulk of clinical learning is done. Instead, you will receive small lessons and tidbits as you are in the hospital and follow different types of patients. Getting used to being able to learn on the fly (without strict structure characteristic of the classroom) will help you succeed moving forward.   With that being said, doing questions is how most of my class learned everything required for rotations. By the end of our clerkship year, a lot of people (including myself) only studied by doing questions. It's OK that you don't know anything when you do these questions. It's completely normal to do terribly on sections. But unlike UW for S1, you should be using this qbank as a primary resource to learn from the questions and focus less about how you're doing percentage-wise (which doesn't correlate to how you'll do on your shelf). Take the time to read why you got an answer right or wrong. By the time you finish, you will have seen the highest yield topics from many different questions.   FYI, Case Files, another popular resource used also teaches in clinical vignettes without any particular organization. Trust that this style of learning works for most people, and that you will get the information you need by the end of the rotation."

I have the Step up to medicine textbook and that has topics in order but then lists a lot of potential ways to diagnose and treat.   On the floors and clinic, some of the real world stuff being managed was a lot different than Uworld.  Uworld might have shown one stage of that algorithm in a question I referred back to.

medicalschool,3db5wj,narcotizedurukhai,3,Wed Jul 15 00:57:21 2015 UTC,"The majority of the people coming from Yale, northwestern, MIT, Columbia working in stocks or IB are making like 150-200 at most coming out and that is after multiple internships and shitty lifestyle. Of those the vast majority don't last very long and switch into something else. Yeah sure the ones that stick can make 10 or 100 million managing a hedge fund but its definitely not the norm.   The fact is that going into medicine and going into IB are very different. If you are as smart as you view as yourself, you really ought to have known the differences and known what you were getting yourself into going into medical school.   That said, if you are at a top 5-10 MD school, you can go into medical consulting after or spend a year at HBS and start at 250-300 minimum and can quickly move yourself up to high 6 figures and into the 7s in a few years. Not much different than your IB route other than you can be called Doctor too."

You act as if youre going to be one of the best and most hardworking IB if you were in it but obviously you don't have the same drive as those type of people.
medicalschool,3d5irt,snakeyeyes,15,Mon Jul 13 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the best thing you can do right now in M2 is do well in your classes. It's all fair game for the exam and the less you have to learn from scratch, the better. I would supplement whatever topic you're going over in class with First Aid or the DIT videos/Pathoma (if available). You don't want to bite yourself in the ass by just ""getting by"" and then, this summer, met with a wall of material you glazed over during the year."
medicalschool,3d5irt,djmccarty,11,Mon Jul 13 19:13:11 2015 UTC,"I didn't think about Step 1 at all until ""dedicated study time"" I had classes to pass, yo"
medicalschool,3d5irt,aigypt,9,Mon Jul 13 19:07:03 2015 UTC,"Its a vague answer, but everyone is different and what worked for me won't necessarily work for you. I'll list the things I would have done if I went through it again.  I tried to study a little microbio and biochem during MS2 and also reviewed the MS1 information. The thing with Biochem is that everyone eventually forgets it, but it helps to study it more than once, so when your dedicated time comes you have seen the material once more.   I agree that ankis can be helpful (especially the brosencephalons), but they did not always work for me. The problem with them was that I could guess the answer without actually knowing it (from visual memory, or maybe I'm just weird like that). If you have time to make your own anki, by all means go for it. It was too much time spend for me. I also wanted to sleep, eat and workout.  Firecracker is amazing for a ""lazier"" person because it lets you test your knowledge but you have to give it time every day. I mean every day! Give it an hour-2 every day and it will show results.   Listen to Goljan when you walk, workout, go to a store.  Watch Pathoma during cooking, cleaning, more than once. Watch Sketchymicro videos for every bug you learn, make ankis about them.    If you end up doing USMLE Rx, make sure you go through answers and actually learn from them. One thing that I did not do but really would have helped me was to make ankis to the questions/concepts that I would get wrong from Usmle RX or Uworld later on. Do those questions that you get wrong, repeat them many times and you'll be fine.  Most importantly, try to get excited about medicine and don't ever think ""this is too detailed, I dont need this for test"" make it interesting, make the things that you are learning exciting for you. CONNECT THEM to each other. Hepatitis B with Polyarteritis nodosa with MPGN; the more connections you make across different fields the more complete it gets.  Just my 2 cents.  Best of luck"
medicalschool,3d5irt,lifeismedicine57,5,Mon Jul 13 21:05:35 2015 UTC,"Listened to Goljan when walking my dog, doing chores around the house, etc. I usually fit in around an hour per day. I rewatched all of the Pathoma videos while at the gym on the elliptical or bike. I kept an excel sheet to keep track of how many times I'd seen each one. By the time I got to my dedicated period, I'd watched them all 3 times.  I did Firecracker, don't recall how much I flagged - maybe 30-50%? I did the questions on detailed mode and this became overwhelming. It would have been better to do on the less detailed mode. Firecracker is good if it helps you to fit in extra studying when you otherwise wouldn't, but in my opinion, it's not a great method of studying. It's very piecemeal. You'd probably be better off reviewing 2 pages of FA per day. What I wish I'd done: reviewed M1 subjects over the summer break. For me that was ID and micro. These were my toughest subjects, and while I ended up doing well in them, they took up maybe 1.5-2 weeks of my 6 week study period. For biochem, I ended up drawing out all of the biochem pathways on huge posterboards, which really cemented the info, but it took ages.  I could have done this over winter or summer break.    Ultimately, there is no one size fits all approach. I have a great memory for school stuff, but I tend to go somewhat slowly through the material. In 6 weeks, I still ended up with 400 unfinished Uworld questions. I was happy with my score (254) but I might have done even better if I'd studied differently. Think about how long it takes you to memorize things and how well you retain information, then plan accordingly."

medicalschool,3d5irt,imchrishansen_,3,Mon Jul 13 19:02:41 2015 UTC,"Everyone is different. I just tried to stay focused on classes, but I did use pathoma for classes as well as usmle rx for extra review questions. It was never a set plan to study for step 1 until dedicated began. Final score - 269."
medicalschool,3d5irt,LeeHarvey_Teabag,3,Mon Jul 13 22:08:24 2015 UTC,"Offshoot question --   For those who had to draw diagrams/do rather detailed studying for classes, how did you switch to ""review mode"" for Step 1?   I have been going over some old subjects in FA and feel uncomfortable with light reviewing because that's not how I study. I would like to become familiar enough with the subject to not have to rely on a memory of a diagram, but not sure how to get to that point."
medicalschool,3d5irt,anotherwish,2,Mon Jul 13 22:09:22 2015 UTC,Pathoma the weekend before each pathophys block for mental framework.   Goljan in the car while commuting.   Sketchy Micro prn.   Utah webpath questions the day before the exam.   That's it. I think Uworld or Rx questions if you have time would be useful though. Saving them for dedicated is not necessary if you reset before you start your study period.
medicalschool,3d5irt,bikedetroit,2,Mon Jul 13 22:51:45 2015 UTC,"I did pathoma over winter break. Did it help? It doesn't feel like it did honestly, but I did perform very well on the exam."

medicalschool,3d5irt,WarriorHealer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:32:18 2015 UTC,"During the year: focus on honoring classes + do brosencephalon the whole year. Really learn the concepts and understand how the details fit into the bigger picture. Pathoma early in the blocks makes for a great framework/minimum you should know cold. Didn't touch FA until dedicated time, but bros deck gave me the details.  I did bros deck the first half of the year and kept up on those cards - wish I would have kept doing them the 2nd half of the year because I ended up retaining the stuff I did use it for best...  Don't start UWorld until at least 3 months before the test for 2 reasons:   There's too much assumption that you have a background understanding of all disciplines, and you'll end up missing out on some important connections you could make if you do it later. Also read all the explanations, even the wrong answers, and understand exactly why they are wrong and what the question writer was ""going for"" with the question. UWorld helps you get your test-taking skills primed right before the test. I did untimed random but always watched the timer and tried to get done with blocks as fast as possible.   Sketchy for micro is pretty much all you need. There were a couple details in UWorld that sketchy didn't cover but this was probably overkill.  Do the bros decks for general principles (biochem, immuno, path) as early as possible and keep doing the cards... anki is best when you use it for a long period of time... and keep up on reviews every day! (Easier said than done.) As I mentioned above mentioned for 2nd year stuff, always try to understand how it all fits together, get a good conceptual understanding of the biochem pathways, cell bio, etc.  Ended up in the 260s on Step 1."
medicalschool,3d5irt,freshmn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:21:55 2015 UTC,Could you go into more detail about how you used the bros decks?
medicalschool,3d5irt,4for40,2,Wed Jul 15 05:25:27 2015 UTC,"Sure. I used the pathology and general principles + phys decks, not the pharm decks. I'm actually weak on pharm, but Step 1 pharm isn't bad.  I started at the beginning of 2nd year doing them with our system blocks, and basically tried to get through as many as I could as early in the blocks as possible so that there was plenty of time to get repetitions in and really get the stuff down. I didn't really add much to the cards. There was a lot I had to look up since a bunch of the terms and stuff were new, but I just kept going through it until I knew it. With anki, I don't say that I know something (ie, hit 'good' or 'easy' unless I actually get it right.  Drill those cards, though. They are a great resource to really memorize a lot of Step 1 stuff. Like I said before, try as hard as you can to understand where each fact on each card fits into the bigger picture. Being able to connect things will help you actually remember stuff as well as make the mental leaps you'll need if you want a great Step 1 score. Rote memorization alone probably won't get you there."

medicalschool,3d5irt,freshmn,-4,Thu Jul 16 23:27:13 2015 UTC,"all of those are the wrong answer. you need to make your own anki cards throughout the year and keep using them. you have to MAKE your OWN anki cards throughout the year. and keep using your ANKI cards that YOU MAKE throughout the year.   DIT - this program is designed for poor performing, unmotivated students. not 260 gunners  rx - its ok  firecracker - not making your own cards  brosencep - not making your own cards  you need to MAKE cards that highlight YOUR weaknesses. everyone has questions and drugs and things that just dont stick in their mind, and everyone has some facts that for, whatever readson, you learn once and never think about. doing cards that you already know doesn't help, and doing 1-2 cards for something you are weak in is not as good as making 10 cards for a weak thing, forwards, backwards, cloze, picture, etc.   don't be lazy. make 30 or so cards a day based on lecture, and don't think about it again til january"

Any person can answer a few questions about their specialty over coffee and move on. It takes a little more commitment to truly mentor a student and help them advance their career. Getting a stranger to take on this commitment isn't as simple as asking ""Are you willing to mentor me?"" You need to develop some kind of relationship and let it evolve naturally. If after a short while you find they aren't meeting your needs, then move on to find a new mentor. They won't all have the time or interest to help you out long-term and that's okay. OP, a good way to get a relationship started is to cold call/email faculty in your desired specialty to see if you can shadow them for an afternoon. This gets your introduction and lets you see if you're compatible. Then ask if they could use some help on a project they're working on; something light on the commitment but with enough to do that you can work together for a couple months. Build your relationship with your mentor at this time and use your weekly/monthly/whatever meetings as an opportunity to ask other questions and network. Hope this helps."

medicalschool,3d2tfo,TheShaker,20,Tue Jul 14 02:02:44 2015 UTC,"During orientation, our school administration told us that a lot of the students who did poorly in their first semester completely changed the way that they studied from undergrad. There is no need to completely revolutionize the way you study just because you're in medical school. I think most people know themselves well enough to know what works but some people get so swept up in the rush of the new environment that they just completely forget all of the good habits that got them here in the first place. React as necessary but there is no need to shoot yourself in the foot by fixing a non-issue."

medicalschool,3d2tfo,buttermellow11,7,Mon Jul 13 08:10:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Undergrad: read the book and my notes a couple days before exam. Med school: use anki to study consistently throughout the block, don't attend classes."

medicalschool,3d2tfo,mikemch16,5,Mon Jul 13 03:37:32 2015 UTC,I do have to say that I completely changed the way I studied because I had recorded lectures at my fingertips.  I didn't have that in undergrad.  It worked out well for me in med school.  I will say though that if your method isn't working - whatever it is - change it!
medicalschool,3d2tfo,TheShaker,5,Mon Jul 13 03:15:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the major thing that changed in my study habits as well. I was a book reader in undergrad. There's a good reason for switching though, not just changing for the sake of changing."

I'm still alive, I'm pretty tired, and the only reason I'm on reddit is because I'm prepping for a presentation.   You will find time to still do stuff you enjoy, just for the love of god, limit facebook/reddit/cellphone games to like a small handful of time a day, no more than 20 minutesish. I pack dinner with me and eat at the end of my shift and head to the gym right after. That way I can actually still get a workout. Working out at the gym is super important to my sanity, so is spending time with my wife. Get rid of anything else, trim the fat on worthless tv shows, anything you find yourself wasting time on, ditch it, or find faster ways. The two or maybe three hours you have between getting home and getting to bed will burn up real fast.

medicalschool,3d66d6,Metrees,4,Mon Jul 13 23:07:24 2015 UTC,"I use both. I annotate into the physical copy but if I just want to make sure something is referenced in FA as I'm doing a QBank, I just search the PDF for that word and make sure it's there and come back to it later. I just make sure it has the info I need to read pertaining to that question and find it in pretty timely manner.   So basically if I'm a bit lazy and don't want to flip to the index and find the word then flip back to the page and search in a wall of text for a drug or test, I use the PDF to find the page and where exactly it is on the page and then just flip the book to that page. It also lets me know if I need to annotate something that isn't in FA if something doesn't show up in a search.   So I use a healthy mix of both and it works fine for me. I would definitely not annotate into two different versions just because it's not quite ""synced"" with each other and you could miss stuff you wrote in one but not the other."
medicalschool,3d66d6,smackythefrog,3,Tue Jul 14 01:18:48 2015 UTC,I de-spined by FA book the day I got it and had it spiral-bound. Best thing I ever did.

I never actually read my scribbles, but it somehow helped get information into my head and form associations with the buzzwords in first aid. Whatever works for you."

And so will you if you're that willing to help others!  Oh wow that's great. I actually found a few of them helpful for nursing such as venesection etc, I would say how to do a good head-to-toe assessment. I would also say manual and digital BP would be good! I know it's not a thing most doctors will be doing much of, but it's entirely possible in junior years and nurses definitely will use manual BP at some point too.   There's so many that would be amazing (e.g. catheterisation) but are not exactly real-world practiceable haha, friends don't catheterise other friends.  Thanks for this :)"

medicalschool,3d4b33,drucey,3,Wed Jul 15 20:24:11 2015 UTC,Surface anatomy. I barely see any videos/content on surface anatomy within an OSCE context. But I think the surface anatomy station may be unique to KCL (this would be super helpful to 2nd year KCL students as well)?
medicalschool,3d4yye,SpirOhNoLactone,21,Mon Jul 13 15:49:32 2015 UTC,"Take questions on tutor mode. After every question sit and think exactly what did you have to know to get that question right. What was the chain of logic that led to the correct answer? If the chain includes facts you did not know, write them down and quickly scan over them every day. Do this about 7000 times and by the time you get to your real step exam you'll be dissecting questions like a boss. This method got me  250+"
medicalschool,3d4yye,jusSumDude,2,Mon Jul 13 15:57:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Take time to understand why the answer is what it is.  If the explanation is not clear to you, try explaining it in your own words. For the STEP understanding > memorizing. Also very important, don't second guess yourself, if you have a gut feeling go with it. Don't look for reasons to change your answer after you have moved on to the next question; in other words, once you get to the end of a section, don't go back and change answers around. Last but not least the question stem is the most important part of the question. Pay extremely close attention to it, I can't tell you how many question I have missed in UWorld and NBMEs because I missed to read a word in the stem. And one more thing, the questions on the real exam contain a lot of fat (like cadavers in lab), the better you are at dissecting the fat away the faster you will get to the important structures underneath.  For example, in my minds eye a question looks something like this: blah blah blah blah. blah blah blah blah. blah blah blah blah blah. An ulcer is located on the median sulcus of the tongue 1 cm ANTERIOR to the foramen cecum blah blah blah blah blah. blah blah blah blah blah. blah blah blah.  the pain sensation from his ulcer is most likely carried by which of the following nerves?  now you see, most of he content of this question is fat. 15 seconds and you are on to the next question. It might be helpful to read the question stem before reading the question to figure out exactly what they are looking for.  Anyways, good luck to you."
medicalschool,3d4yye,OrionZodiac,6,Tue Jul 14 04:14:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with what everyone else said, and I'll add that I think that some people who identify themselves as ""bad test-takers"" tend to try to ""psychoanalyze"" the test. They try to find ways that the questions trick them, focus on small details, and take the concept way too far. They end up doing poorly not because they don't know the material, but because they completely miss the central point of the question. The questions are not trying to trick you, and they're not asking for any more or less than what is evident within the question stem. So practice taking tests without trying to analyze them."
medicalschool,3d4yye,maria340,4,Mon Jul 13 23:09:56 2015 UTC,"Practice! If you really feel like you lack testing skills, make MCQ's a bigger chunk of your strategy!   Personally, I did Uworld twice, read FA three times, and made a review document for things that I had trouble with from FA so I wasn't going over stuff I already knew too much.  As far as MCQ strategy (and I'm sorry because this'll sound dumb) but the most important thing is to consider what you are being asked. Don't lose the tree for the forest. After you have assessed what is being asked, use only the pertinent data to answer your question or rule out other answers.  Removing irrelevant details and refocusing on the information wrt what they want from you had helped me a ton.   Also, worst case scenario, go with your gut.   Hope that helps. This (and a  ton of studying) got me 250+"
medicalschool,3d4yye,if_Engage,2,Mon Jul 13 18:47:26 2015 UTC,"I think the most important thing is to have a methodology. For example here's how I approach every question:  1) read the last sentence of the question  2) read the possible answers  3) read the question (I skim it if I already kinda know what the answer is based on 1 and 2).   4) choose!  Also be very introspective about why you are missing q's. For example during my dedicated study time, I was totally plateauing on my score. However I realized that I was overthinking most of the questions i missed. So I started to go for the obvious answer rather than the weird convoluted 5 step answer. My practice score went up 10 points that week.   I think what really stuck with me is the idea of trying to hit a single on every question rather than trying to swing for the fences every time.  Also be sure to learn why the wrong answers are wrong in each question!"

There are ways around not having to waste hours just being a greeter at the hospital or whatever when you could have a job or study or do things you actually enjoy. Nobody cares if you volunteered 1000+ hrs in a hospital making photo copies. Now in med school, I became involved in two organizations because I found them valuable for the community and only gave them very reasonable # of hours."

medicalschool,3d54io,tellme_areyoufree,2,Mon Jul 13 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"I think that, for the most part, schools expect that a lot of the things you put on your application were done for the purpose of improving your chances of getting into school. Most of the volunteering I had on my application was from undergrad or through local organizations in my hometown, so I would not have been able to continue those anyways. There were a lot of opportunities during first year, but I usually felt like the time would be better spent studying. I am planning on doing more volunteering this year."

medicalschool,3d54io,ceih,2,Mon Jul 13 22:01:59 2015 UTC,"Yes. I spent my four years at medical school teaching kids from the age of 10 through to 18 about science, medicine and university. At the younger ages it was kept simple, but as they got older it was about university and I really taught them first year med school stuff. Clinical skills, pathology, interview advice, whatever. I then volunteered my time for the BMA (British Medical Association), serving as my university rep for a year and also as the lead for widening participation.  Simply put, the reasons that other people don't get in to med school didn't go away when I got in. So I continued to spread the knowledge and fight their corner. All told I spent about 400 hours over my four years."

If I end up feeling disgusting, I take a quick break when I can and change into a new one. It helps a lot to have that extra barrier between myself and my outer dress clothes/scrubs.

The issue is more a practical one: I'm not sure I'm ready to devote 4+ years at minimum for this, in a part of the country I don't particularly like, away from family, and being highly stressed during most of those 4 years. I think I'm just hesitant to engage in the process of med school and the personal things I will give up (time, family, personal and romantic relationships) during that journey."

I would seriously consider if you feel that being a doctor is the way you want to help heal people. There's a lot of other good you can be doing.  I don't mean to discourage you at all, but you are at an ideal junction to make these choices.   Maybe take the rest of the time you have off to explore other fields.

medicalschool,3d7eri,myspicymeatballs,2,Tue Jul 14 22:31:45 2015 UTC,"I'll rephrase. The exam was too easy to study for. So many available resources (exam crackers from 5 years ago would have been just fine to study with last year), predictable questions/equations, predictable passages and types of questions (practice tests all seemed to have same type of Qs). Honestly, I slacked off through college, studied for a month and went from a 14 to 31, and my English is not even that good. A ton of people were able to do this, and a good score does not necessarily mean students are prepared for medical school at all. The new test is supposed to care about all this knowledge stuff plus a bunch of other topics and almost twice as long (compared to when I took it), to weed some people out and maybe deal with some issues medical schools are facing today like people failing out or not having social skills/knowledge (sociology and psych now tested). In my opinion, they had to change things around because this way they make more money and because it was the same damn test since 1991. Is this a good thing? maybe in the long run, but right now I bet it sucks balls to all premeds.

I don't really know how I got there, but I definitely did well in the first two years. How my med school career went:  Years 1 and 2:   I actually liked the material. It's easier to study this stuff if you like it. I'm not a genius so a lot of my success was studying a lot and studying smartly. I got settled into a studying style that worked for me relatively early and just kept with it. I read a lot and took copious amount of notes (by hand). I never studied from powerpoints or flashcards. To me it was less about memorizing details and more about concepts. And I think tactile memory is underrated. If you can read a chapter on a topic and summarize it in a page or two of diagrams and tables, you get a better understanding than just reading it or typing out notes, in my opinion. My school had a large PBL component so me off by myself reading a lot and taking a lot of notes worked really well. I skipped 90% of lectures. Pretty good test-taker, and better than average on being able to differentiate material that is actually important to learn as opposed to minutiae (which helps you study smarter). Treated med school like a job and clocked out at 5-6pm. Stress kills, so I tried to avoid it like the plague. I did zero extracurriculars.   Step 1:   Did well on it, probably just because I was doing well on in school in general. Don't specifically ask me for advice on this one, I took it in 2012 and study strategies were slightly different back then.   Year 3:   Had a strong base of knowledge from years 1-2 and Step 1 so that helped a lot on shelf exams. I studied very hard for them. I essentially prioritized studying for the shelf exams over any other type of reading during my rotations. My scores essentially carried me to honors on almost all my rotations. Otherwise, I laid low on rotations. Did enough to be seen but avoided trying to annoy anybody. I heavily dislike clinical medicine and the hardest part was trying to not look bored. I got pretty good at faking just the right amount of enthusiasm.   That's about all I can think of.  So basically I have no idea why I was considered in the ""top"" of my class. I guess it all boils down to studying smart and doing well on tests."

The only extracurricular activity I plan on doing is a free clinic 2-3 times a month, because I think it will help me incorporate what I am learning in the books to real life scenarios, which should help during rotations and Step 1 (also, if you think this is a waste of time please let me know!)."
medicalschool,3d0zps,tigecycline,6,Sun Jul 12 21:48:54 2015 UTC,"Question: Do you think the lack of extracurriculars made a difference during residency interviews (i.e. did any hold that against you?)   I didn't feel like it was a detriment to my application at all. Residency applications aren't like med school applications. The main things they're looking for are 1) academic competency, as measured by performance in school and on the boards and 2) a good personality, as measured by the interview, largely. Only do extracurriculars that you would do if no one was watching, i.e., stuff you actually like doing. Otherwise, spend your free time enjoying your hobbies, friends, and family, or whatever makes you tick. Interviewers ask more about your hobbies than your extracurriculars.   The only extracurricular activity I plan on doing is a free clinic 2-3 times a month, because I think it will help me incorporate what I am learning in the books to real life scenarios, which should help during rotations and Step 1 (also, if you think this is a waste of time please let me know!).   Probably not going to help on Step 1, but don't start engineering your life with things you think are going to help you on Step 1. Just focus on school and your personal life, and you will be able to deal with Step 1 later. I wouldn't even think about Step 1 until the semester right before taking it.  Volunteering in a free clinic is a very common extracurricular. Absolutely do it if you enjoy it. There are people who do it to ""remind"" themselves why they're in med school (to see patients), and there are people who do it because they're in pre-med resume-padding mode. Don't be the latter."

I won't know for sure for another couple of weeks.  I love reading out of textbooks. I really have to echo the comment about enjoying the material. That prose really helps me understand concepts. When I study I make sure I understand all the concepts of all the lectures presented so far before I start going through the PowerPoints in order to memorize facts. Big Robbins is my favorite book that I used consistently, and I have other books that I bought physical copies of for each block. Didn't use BRS or anything similar that much. I hate writing anything down physically, but I definitely remembered things by where they were on the page.  I'm not doing any extracurriculars outside of research. I edited a video once for a national contest for my school, and that was enough to convince me that it was not in my interests to do anything else.

I figured that if I enjoyed going for the RPG leaderboard so much, why not go for real life leaderboard instead?  I usually read up on the material before lectures, and use the lectures as opportunities to understand the difficult parts in the material. After rotations I would read up on the things I encountered during the day. Also systematically go through the course curriculum for an outline for what is important. 2 weeks before exams I would start cramming, reviewing the material and doing old exams. If friends are also available we would get together as a group and discuss exam questions. Both fun and profit!  Liking the material helps. During the surgery course I also went through the surgery 101 podcasts on my commute (at least 100 episodes back then!) Basically lived and breathed surgery, which resulted in the top score on the exam.

medicalschool,3d0zps,FearTheLobster,4,Sun Jul 12 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"Yup, I feel like a lot of the exam is understanding the intent behind questions and answers. Like, reading a clinical vignette and understanding the test writers wants to test you on this specific concept. Or reading an answer choice and understanding that they are seeing if you understand this other concept that makes it wrong or not the best choice."
medicalschool,3d0zps,if_Engage,3,Sun Jul 12 18:53:07 2015 UTC,Also there is something to be said for knowing how to rest well before an exam and be at optimal analytical capacity during the exam to deduce answers when. You don't have the relevant details memorized.
medicalschool,3d0zps,Jezzine,5,Sun Jul 12 22:41:29 2015 UTC,"The most widespread and damaging mistake most of my classmates make is thinking emotionally rather than logically when it comes to statistics.  Our tests are usually multiple answers. There are 5 alternatives; if you get it right you get +1, if you get it wrong -0.25, and 0 if you don't answer. Picking a random answer is never harmful, and is beneficial if you can identify (even without certainty) one or more incorrect answers.  Surprisingly, most people in my class answer only if they are 100% sure they picked the correct answer, and prefer to skip questions even if they are undecided between only two alternatives.  I tried talking to a few of my friends about it but they really don't seem to get it. The typical answer is ""yeah, but if I answer at random I could do worse!"" which is obviously true, but not considering the fact you are much more likely to do better."

medicalschool,3d0zps,bg3323,2,Sun Jul 12 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"For me it's just an extension of the skills you developed as far back as high school.   Go through the test with a first pass, answering everything you're quite certain of, marking things you're unsure of but still have a gut-based answer for, and then leave some that are too complex blank to hit later to make sure you get all the easy/medium questions dealt with.   Then go back through double checking the ones you weren't 100% on and deciding on a final answer. After that, hit the ones you left unanswered as you've dealt with the majority (hopefully) of the test at this point).   If you have enough time, double check all of your answers as quickly as possible.   As a side-note, I always trust my gut instinct on items that I mark. I'm only going to change my answer if I have very thoroughly convinced myself I was wrong in the first place.   And then as has been said, just remember with multiple choice exams, you have a pretty good chance of getting a question right with just an educated guess.  I'm not the smartest guy in the world by any stretch, but I've met people in my class personally who almost certainly knew more than me, but consistently did worse on exams than me (3.85 GPA and 250 Step 1)."

medicalschool,3d0zps,michellengineer,4,Sun Jul 12 18:33:59 2015 UTC,"I've stayed up in the top 10 (top ~3%) of my class through my first three years.  I really agree with what /u/tigecycline said -- a lot of it has to do with finding study habits that work for you.    My M1-M2 curriculum was largely based on being given a packet of ""objectives"" and assigned readings that should answer these objectives.  I felt that reading the text in a pointed, focused way really helped me to focus on the important content and pay less attention to minutia.  I hate powerpoints and avoided them like the plague.  Also, my social life was somewhat non-existent because I spent 95% of my waking hours studying (which also helped to drive away anyone who might be interested in hanging out with someone who is acting like a crazed librarian), but I did a lot of extracurricular activities and took on leadership positions because I figured they'd help my residency application (we'll find out in ~8 months).  These first two years definitely created a comfortable base for Step 1 and my clinical years.    Step 1 -- I started studying ~6 months in advance, just consolidating multiple resources into First Aid.  I'm a firm believer that starting early allows you to be thorough, take your time, and avoid the stress of last-minute cramming.  This let me work at my own pace (which is mad slow) and also focus on my actual courses at the same time.  I ended up with a 250.  M3 -- my school is weird and the way we get graded doesn't make any sense, but I did well on most of the shelf exams with the exception of my first one.  Just spending 1-2 hours every night reading and doing UWorld questions will do the trick for each rotation.    Not 100% sure if that's what you were looking for, but I'd be happy to answer anything you might still wonder about"

There were a few factors that helped me do well, but I think the most important were my personal reasons for going to med school (which kept me consistently motivated and interested), and the fact that I was lucky enough to find a group of friends that both pushed me and kept me grounded.  Oh yeah, and Adderall.    You have to decide if it's worth it for you personally.  My experience was that it took maybe 50% more work to go from C's to B's, but probably 6x10E24% more work to go from B's to a A's.  It was worth it to me because I barely made it in to med school and I had something prove to myself, and also I was at a DO school and (legitimately) worried about not making it into an ACGME residency.

Like everyone else said, it's a combination of being generally good at taking exams and learning how to prepare efficiently.  In general, I start off nailing down the basics like anatomy and physiology. FA or BRS phys are both helpful for that. Once I have that down, I fill in the little details for pathology using FA/pathoma and try to relate it to normal function. Once I've built up a good fund of knowledge, the exam is basically a game of recognizing buzzwords.  The other thing I try to do is really separate study time and personal time. I've seen other people pull 8hrs/day in the library, but spend all of it somewhat multi-tasking between reading and browsing facebook/texting/etc. I'm guilty of that myself, but I try to limit it as much as I can. 4hrs of focused studying is probably as good as 8hrs of distracted reading."

Take the time to learn physiology really well instead of cramming flashcards into your head. If you understand the fundamentals, then pathophysiology is easy. The details make more sense in the context of the big picture, and they won't seem like discrete facts that you have to memorize by brute force.  IMO people who study for tests by pumping and dumping seem more stressed and burned out. They might score well on individual tests, but they don't retain the information well, which can come back to bite you when step 1 comes around or when doctors pimp you on the wards."

Most talk is just normal chat between coworkers who work closely (vacations, family, work, etc...). Also, no one is really waiting for you to be out. There tends to be chat before you come in, followed by everyone working to get you prepped while anesthesia puts you under, followed by a safety checklist going over what the procedure is, who the patient is, a review of the consent form, anesthesia contributing, etc... Then the procedure begins. By the time that all happens you've already been out for possibly a couple minutes.

medicalschool,3d15ro,tableonwheels,5,Sun Jul 12 17:41:13 2015 UTC,"Took an NBME to gauge where I was before 4 dedicated weeks of studying. It was NBME 3, score was 203. I nearly pooped myself. I knew it was go time. Insert 4 weeks of 7am-7pm studying and I ended with 248 on the real thing. So to answer your question, yes it can be done.   How did I do it? UWorld, tutor mode, twice. Once during 3rd year. Once during those 4 weeks, then again through my ""Wrong answers."" Contrary to popular opinion on this sub, I don't see any benefit to doing timed UWorlds unless you're someone who always struggles to finish on time during tests. If that's not a problem for you, there's no reason to do timed, imo. Moving on, typical day for me was doing 3-4 UWorld sets per day (yes, that's all). Each set would take me between 2-4 hours to complete. After each question I would scan through the correct and incorrect answer and write down little tidbits that ""if you asked me the question that way, I would've gotten it wrong.""   For example, literally every set of UWorld you will ever do will have at least 1 question on ankylosing spondylosis. It's nearly impossible to know EVERYTHING about that fucking disease. Every question you get on the topic, learn something from it! Just because you got it right doesn't mean shit! Learn something, write something down that you didn't know. Every single UWorld question will have something you didn't know buried inside. Whether it be in the wrong answer explanations or the right answer explanation. Learn something! Write it down! Review it your page(s) of notes from each day at the end of the day. Repeat. Prove people wrong.   Do not waste your time with textbooks. There is literally no point. UWorld until opening the desktop app triggers your gag reflex. If you absolutely must look something up, scan through the relevant Uptodate.com section on it (the part that's at the bottom of the topic, usually 5-10 sentences).   As far as NBMEs go, the closest one (NBME 6) underestimated my score by 12 points, six days away from the real exam. UWSA was 246 five days out from my exam, so imo that was the ""closest to the real deal.""   And since I see it referenced so many times on this sub, my last UWorld average (my second time through) was ~72% correct. I think I broke 80% on a tutor-mode random block maybe 2-3x total. Ignore these assholes saying they're getting ""like 85% on my first time through bro."" They're full of shit. Believe in yourself. Get off reddit. Go fucking study.

medicalschool,3d15ro,Kobe_Didnt_Do_It,5,Mon Jul 13 03:02:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know, man. Step 2 CK is a really broad test. Typically a track record of success on the shelf exams is the best predictor. When I took the test in 2013 it was a random mess of all kinds of nonsense, and I felt that my ~4 weeks of part-time prep was not super helpful. So maybe I'm a bad person to be giving you advice because I really don't know how best to prepare for Step 2 CK in 4 weeks.  But, I can give you some general advice on resources. There is no single best review book for Step 2 CK. Kaplan, Step Up, and First Aid are not comprehensive on their own. For someone who did well on the shelf exams, UWorld is all they need to get fresh for the exam. Sounds like you need some more content before you're ready to take the exam, so it's probably not a bad idea to hit up some review resources.  So, first off, studying hard for internal medicine will yield you the most points. Secondly, there is a whole heck of a lot of detailed nonsense on surgery, ob/gyn, and peds that is on the exam and it's hard to predict. So you really need to focus in your deficiencies.  So let's start at square one and dig into some more in-depth review materials.   For internal medicine, the NMS Medicine Casebook is a great review which I recommend to people on their medicine clerkship. It's an easy read but it's kinda long, but it's in prose, based on cases, and gets you thinking about the ""next best step in management"" which is a Step 2 favorite. For surgery, go through the Pestana notes. Just do it. Trauma and subspecialty surgery pops up on the exam. You have to ace those questions because there are often clear right answers if you know the decision-making tree. For ob/gyn, if you're weak on this, consider CaseFiles if you have time. That has all the life-and-death scenarios you don't want to miss points on. For pediatrics, I would consider muscling through PreTest Pediatrics as that is a great source of questions that hits a lot of solid content.   Do all of UWorld, obviously. I favor going through UWorld random and timed from day one -- throw yourself in the deep end and force yourself to swim. Comb over the explanations early on and you'll learn a lot. Like I said there really isn't one single review book that hits all the goods but Kaplan (Master the Boards) is not horrible and some people like Step Up. Step 2 Secrets is a decent rapid-fire review of everything as well.  I hope that's helpful. Step 2 CK is unfortunately a more unpredictable exam than Step 1. There isn't a completely agreed upon strategy that works for everyone. So focus on what you suck at most and dig deeper on those subjects. For subjects you're good on, Step 2 Secrets or another review book like Kaplan may do ok.  Good luck."

One suggestion, do uwsa today for extra questions but don't do any more forms like that to cause panic.   I don't think any review book reading will help unless somebody disagrees based on this person's scoring stats from uw + nbme.   It looks like knowledge gaps but not sure if you should reorganize questions by topic or continue like you have. I am sure some expert opinions will come.

Post a link to your medical classes' facebook page saying your Magic the Gatheric group is a thing you've been involved with for a long time, that it's something to help you relieve stress, and if possible make sure alcohol is involved.

I will say this about my medical school experience though, my school was really big on ""wellness"". A lot of the time it felt like an absurd level of treating me like a child. They would talk about how stressful school could be, how many people get depressed or have crying spells.   I didn't fit in with the clique that had formed my first year. They were a bunch of bros and it was so strange for me to try and fit in and just not....work. It was sad. I've always been fairly introverted and the start of med school really accentuated how lonely I could feel while surrounded by people I didn't really click with.  It got better for me. But I guess the reason I tell this story is because as stupid as it felt while I was going through it, I thought hearing it from my associate dean...that life is hard for a lot of people...even if I didn't want to admit it at the time, made me feel better.  So I wanted to tell you. Even if it doesn't look it, even if everyone else looks so overwhelmingly confident, there are people, people you'd least expect, that are having trouble and difficulty just like you. Find and figure out how to get past it, and be successful.   That's really all it comes down to. You've made it this far, keep doing what you need to do to find what your looking for in life.

As for making friends, can you join an interest club? Maybe even get a position in one where you will collaborate on projects. Don't feel discouraged that you picked the wrong career, there are many nerdy doctors out there. I love reading fantasy novel and so does my fiancé who also just graduated from med school. The thing is that by just looking at us you might not have assumed it. So try feeling out some of those people who you may assume you have nothing in common with."

medicalschool,3cy97s,Wonka_Vision,11,Tue Jul 14 15:40:41 2015 UTC,"pro tip: don't try to be somebody you're not; that applies to every profession. Also DON'T ever compare yourself to others. If you don't like hanging around people in med school, fuck them don't hang out with them and go play magic on the weekend or play a video game. Going forward your #1 priority will be do know the material and do good on the exams.  Do research. One thing I will say is you should volunteer in a community clinic (not sure what they have in europe) so that you learn how to talk to patients. Last but not least, just because people seem outgoing and confident doesn't mean that they know what they are talking about. This is especially true in med school."
medicalschool,3cy97s,MedicalCat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:54:02 2015 UTC,"You are right there, talking to patients is a skill that I should practice. I worked in a hospital for a month, and I never realised how difficult it was to convice some people to take their pills!  Thank you for your advice."
medicalschool,3cy97s,MedicalCat,5,Sat Jul 11 22:02:43 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I feel this way in large groups where I don't know many people.  And it's weird because my mind is saying ""How do you know you wouldn't get along with any of these people? You don't even know them."" and my lizard brain is saying ""Every person here is an asshole and you're better than them, ignore them all.""  The way I got over it was baby steps: try introducing myself to someone I probably wouldn't like, and likely wouldn't see again -- say, a fraternity-looking kid in a burrito place near campus eating alone. And almost every time I did this I found that I could get along with whoever it was, and would likely value a passing friendship with them. Sometimes I got their number and called them up later.  And doing this over time sort of put the large-crowd reaction into perspective for me.  So now I'm more comfortable introducing myself and making friends because I feel like if I don't, I'm doing a disservice to them too.  I'm keeping them from a possibly valuable friendship.

I made a few friends, but my interests outside of school have allowed me to meet people outside the discipline.  You know how refreshing it is to have friends who don't ask me how often and what I study?  It's the freeking best.   Sharing a common interest of medicine with other people isn't enough to become besties IMO. Medicine is just one of many interests that make you, you."

It will help you healthwise, brainwise, and give you a chance to run into people from med school socially / a chance to make a friend in class to work out with.

It got better for me during clinical years because we had to spend so much more time not only together but relying on each other and what not (plus we had a Wii in the student lounge and they finally got to see the real side of me :P). Someone's exact words to me were ""wow, stellarosa, you're a lot of fun when you talk!"" I hope it gets better for you, but if not, just keep your eye on the prize and make sure to keep carving out time for things you enjoy with the people that do enjoy your company :)  Edit: and it seems like we would have been really good friends in another life.

medicalschool,3cz9mp,FeinbergSteinberg,61,Sun Jul 12 03:23:56 2015 UTC,"For the sake of this post I'm assuming you're an American in your 3rd year. If you're serious about dropping out, consider that the MD degree even in the absence of a residency can be a valuable addition to your resume. You're already more or less committed to 3/4 of the financial burden and you've already sunk 2+ years of your life into this (more if you count premed). What's your backup plan if Georgetown doesn't work out? Are you 100% sure you're going to love finance? Every field has pluses and minuses. If you drop out now you're effectively starting from point 0, except that you're much more in debt and burnt out than your new peers.   Everyone has a rough stretch during 3rd year, especially on rotations they don't like. The solution may be as simple as not being a pediatrician. Keep your chin up and think about all the reasons you've kept up with this so far. It'll get better."
medicalschool,3cz9mp,SimonSezary,10,Sun Jul 12 03:42:29 2015 UTC,You have a great point when you mention that the MD degree has value on a resume but I just thought I should point out the second part of your argument about already having 3 years of loans and 2+ years of time already invested is classic sunken cost fallacy which is actually a pretty examined concept in economics. Just thought it was a little extra relevant considering OP wants to go into finance. https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=sunk%20cost%20fallacy
medicalschool,3cz9mp,gbillz,14,Sun Jul 12 05:06:38 2015 UTC,"While I understand the fallacy, I think the point /u/SimonSezary is trying to make is that putting 150k into medical school without having a degree to show for it is worse than putting an additional 70k to actually be able to reference the degree later. Yes, it's more money and time, but it's not like poker where you put more in the pot for only a chance at a return."
medicalschool,3cz9mp,_OccamsChainsaw,19,Sun Jul 12 05:19:02 2015 UTC,"Actually that is exactly the fallacy. The amount of time and money invested so far is completely irrelevant to the decision to be made today.   What needs to be decided today is: Are the additional ~2 years and 70K in loans it would take to obtain the full MD degree worth it? It doesn't matter if OP paid $100 for the first two years of school or $1million. All that matters is how much value the full MD degree will actually bring to OP in the future.    Putting 150k into medical school without having a degree to show for it is worse than putting an additional 70k to actually be able to reference the degree later.   ""Without having a degree to show for it"" is a completely emotionally based assessment. ""Having a degree to show for it"" is only relevant financially if it will actually bring OP more than 70k + two years of lost income in whatever job he ultimately takes in returns.   Everything else the original commenter said OP making sure he isn't just burnt out specifically from Peds or having a tough transition to third year is totally on point though."
medicalschool,3cz9mp,gbillz,3,Sun Jul 12 05:33:09 2015 UTC,"Good point. I was working under the assumption that OP could potentially use the degree to obtain a job, rather than the emotional need for it. I disregarded its relevance to investment banking because I was thinking about the other options OP would have with the degree, which is unfair seeing as OP specifically mentioned investment banking. Those are the problems with my argument."
medicalschool,3cz9mp,_OccamsChainsaw,9,Sun Jul 12 05:39:46 2015 UTC,"Actually that is exactly the fallacy. The amount of time and money invested so far is completely irrelevant to the decision to be made today.   While this is technically true, it is only true if you go this road till the end of it, and translate the situation into this framework completely. In this case existing debts are indeed ""irrelevant"", as it is impossible to change the past, and the debts are already there. They should not affect your decision.  However the MD is now twice faster and twice cheaper to get than it would take any other mortal man (because the OP is half into the process). So that's the real question to consider. Is it a good idea to get an MD if it takes 2 years only, and the OP is already accepted in the program?  While I don't have a first hand experience with this market, my impression so far is that non-practicing MDs have pretty good job perspectives in industry, research, medical business, medical consulting, policy and law, and other fields like that. With this in mind, maybe OP has some reasons to consider finishing this path, even if they don't want to heal humans anymore."
medicalschool,3cz9mp,ampanmdagaba,5,Sun Jul 12 05:56:15 2015 UTC,"You're totally right, as was the original commenter.   My only point was the time and money already spent isn't a relevant factor in the equation. What OP needs to decide is if the remaining costs to getting the whole MD are balanced by the rewards he'll get for doing so. He should look at the job market for non practicing MDs and the salaries involved and compare them to his prospects without the MD, and then decide whether the 70k + 2 years for the MD is worth it. How much time or loans he spent to get here doesn't factor into that equation at all. Those are sunk costs, unchangeable, and in the past. The decison to be made involves the future and how to best allocate his resources today."

medicalschool,3cz9mp,mmmmick,0,Sun Jul 12 15:25:13 2015 UTC,"Of course you are right. I do think a huge reason to bring up the previous money and time spent, though, is to highlight the fact that it only takes one year and 70k to get an MD at this point, as the rest is done."
medicalschool,3cz9mp,connormxy,2,Sun Jul 12 13:52:52 2015 UTC,"What needs to be decided today is: Are the additional ~2 years and 70K in loans it would take to obtain the full MD degree worth it?

medicalschool,3cz9mp,Annatto,3,Sun Jul 12 18:20:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Concorde fallacy only really applies when the amount of money you've sunken into something is insignificant compared to the total amount of money you have left. The whole fallacy is that the behavior is ""inefficient because it misallocates resources by depending on information that is irrelevant to the decision being made (Wiki).""  I don't know OP's financial situation, but you kind of have to consider the 3 years of loans into the decision to quit, because whatever alternative field you choose to go into must provide adequate compensation to repay those loans. Don't know what the long-term career trajectory of a finance degree is, but a quick google search says median salary is $75k...so better than residency, but after that you'd be missing that nice attending pay bump to repay the loans and start making real money."
medicalschool,3cz9mp,chomstar,2,Sun Jul 12 05:48:29 2015 UTC,"My argument was made assuming OP wouldn't go on to practice medicine even after getting the MD, and would only be completing it for resume boosting purposes like the original commenter suggested. If practicing medicine after completing the degree despite hating it was an option, then definitely the sunk cost fallacy wouldn't apply here because the investment would totally be worth it financially."
medicalschool,3cz9mp,gbillz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:54:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah makes sense.  I think one of the hardest parts about justifying the decision to quit med school is that just about every month, you get exposed to a field and aspect of medicine that can be totally new and exciting to you and you may fall in love with it. It's hard to find a field that has so many diverse options, and even in the 2 years of clinical rotations, you only get exposed to a fraction of them. I'm in a similar boat to OP in that I haven't found my passion yet, but my family and friends and counselor have really sold me on the notion that if I stick through it, I'll find something that I could see myself enjoying for the next 10-20 years.  I almost feel like that minimizes the sunken cost effect, because each semester you're paying for a new experience and new opportunity to make the investment worthwhile."
medicalschool,3cz9mp,chomstar,9,Sun Jul 12 14:05:42 2015 UTC,"Make sure you actually want to do finance before committing to that, since you already committed to something and found out you don't really like it.  Also, if the reason you don't want to do medicine is typified by your first paragraph, there are plenty of fields where you don't have to interact with patients or be on call. There are also careers you can pursue with an MD where you don't really do much doctoring, and could go into administration.  But, at the end of the day, if you don't really want to be a doctor, and think you can manage the finances of quitting, don't be scared to pull the trigger. I've been in your shoes for the past 2 years, but I just haven't found any viable alternative, don't have the financial support of my parents (and no independent wealth), and have a long-term girlfriend/future family to think about.  Long story short...it's not an easy decision, so treat it accordingly."
medicalschool,3cz9mp,chomstar,12,Sun Jul 12 04:02:08 2015 UTC,Get some distance before you make a decision. Impulsive life choices tend to not be well thought out. They can work out but they can also leave your life a smoldering crater.
medicalschool,3cz9mp,kereekerra,6,Sun Jul 12 04:14:01 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate on what kind of finance program you're talking about at Georgetown? Master's, MBA, another bachelor's? I just mention this because there is a fairly common misconception in the medical community that any med student could break into and be successful in Ibanking. Frankly this just isn't true. The high finance work field is fairly saturated and often requires very strong quantative skills. Furthermore, if you are thinking that it will be easy to be a six figure banker compared to medicine, just consider that many of the successful wall street guys worked 12 hours a day 5-6 days a week through their twenties and the burnout rate is atrocious. This is not an easy field, the culture is very competitive, and it takes a lot of luck just to get in with the right companies. That's my two cents. Perhaps you already know all this, have some prior experience in finance, and are getting a graduate degree in the field. Or you're hoping to just be a midlevel Edward Jones salesman.

The upsides to this were that I still (1) was eligible for living expenses loans, since I was still a student and (2) I didn't have to use up any of my Grace Period or start the loan repayment process, since I was still a student. The downside, of course, is that you still have to pay for the part time elective, but it's still less than full time tuition. That's what they did at my school, at least.

Even if your specialty of choice isn't included, you can get a feel for how a drop in score from step 1 to step 2 seems to affect applicants.

Are you an IMG or do you go to a school here in the states? Also, what type of programs are you aiming for? Depending on your answers, forgoing the step 2 score until after submitting your eras works sometimes in your favor - especially with a high Step 1 score.   However I see that you're taking your step 2 exam soon. At that point, just do your best! Most students score within a few points +/- of their step 1 score. Also, keep in mind that a score >250-260 on the step 1 especially has a little more to do with luck than just straight knowledge."
medicalschool,3cyjaf,popsmed,2,Sat Jul 11 23:03:53 2015 UTC,"No kids but I'm married and I understand the reluctance/difficulty of bringing studying home. I did 100% question review/study during MS3.  I would say almost all of my studying was done while at the hospital/clinic- however; if i got out early, I would go to the library and study till 5. Almost never studied or read after 5pm. Honored all but obgyn. I think questions/explanations at this stage are the most efficient use of time. I don't think you need anything but Uworld and pre-test. I thought acog and aafp were useless, didn't use mksap though I hear it is good. Didn't touch case files. If you did good on step 1/ have a good foundation- it should be fine!"
medicalschool,3cyjaf,X-RT,2,Sun Jul 12 00:46:41 2015 UTC,"Your instinct about question based learning is accurate. Numerous, well-controlled studies have shown that self-testing and forcing yourself to generate answers from scratch is far, far more effective than the common textbook reading techniques so often used by students.   Before going to medical school I spent almost two years working as a scribe for a hospitalist group that hosted M3s on their medicine rotation. What you need to succeed is a well-connected mental model of information that you can access based on the clinical scenario. You don't want to be like the underperforming M3 who once asked an attending to rephrase his question as a multiple choice."

Used pestana (like 100pgs) for surgery, pretest EM for EM, ACOG questions for obgyn, that's mostly about it. Very strong shelf performance throughout the year. Just took NBME4 for step 2 (prior to doing any real step 2 studying) and got in the 230s so apparently that worked fine. Oh, the Emma Holiday shelf review PDFs are fabulous, I used them too.

Mksap +u world for medicine, aafp questions for family, acog questions for OB, etc etc. the only exception I think is psych. I didn't do a whole lot of questions and just read first aid for psych, it worked /okay/.   I think doing mostly questions is almost perfectly adequate study strategy for third year, along with reading around patients during each rotation."

medicalschool,3cyhar,T1430,2,Sat Jul 11 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"During the year: focus on honoring classes + do brosencephalon the whole year. Really learn the concepts and understand how the details fit into the bigger picture. Pathoma early in the blocks makes for a great framework/minimum you should know cold.  I did bros deck the first half of the year and kept up on those cards - wish I would have kept doing them the 2nd half of the year because I ended up retaining the stuff I did use it for best...  Don't start UWorld until at least 3 months before the test for 2 reasons:    There's too much assumption that you have a background understanding of all disciplines, and you'll end up missing out on some important connections you could make if you do it later.  UWorld helps you get your test-taking skills primed right before the test. I did untimed random but always watched the timer and tried to get done with blocks as fast as possible.   Also didn't touch FA until dedicated time, but bros deck gave me the details.  Sketchy for micro is pretty much all you need. There were a couple details in UWorld that sketchy didn't cover but this was probably overkill.  Do the bros decks for general principles (biochem, immuno, path) as early as possible and keep doing the cards... anki is best when you use it for a long period of time... and keep up on reviews every day! (Easier said than done.) As I mentioned above mentioned for 2nd year stuff, always try to understand how it all fits together, get a good conceptual understanding of the biochem pathways, cell bio, etc.  Ended up in the 260s on Step 1."

medicalschool,3cyhar,atppro92,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:21:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know that I'd recommend doing Rx AND UWorld during classes (couldn't tell if that's what you were planning on doing). Seems like a little bit of overkill and a waste of the UWorld qbank. If I could do it over again, I'd at least open FA from day 1 and do 5-20 Rx or Kaplan subject-based questions a day during each class. Micro section of FA is pretty bare bones, so make sure to annotate that during classes, and also supplement your micro school material with any bugs that are in FA that you don't cover in class. The nice thing about Rx is that it helps you to memorize FA because it's from the makers of FA and the explanations are literally FA pages. The nice thing about Kaplan qbank is that you get some very detailed material covered that neither FA or UWorld covers, and it may do a better job of teaching you the material as you learn it (IMO, UWorld questions make you think, but Kaplan questions test your core knowledge about a given subject, and it helped beat in some high yield specifics here and there. There will be questions on Step )  I went the focusing-on-class route (not a common plan). I honored--1 SD above class average--just about every exam 2nd year (though probably in part because most people spend a lot of time step studying rather than class studying.) I didn't open FA until December and started Kaplan in early February. I finished 80% by middle of April with a month left of class, then started UWorld. By end of second year, I had finished Kaplan and done 40% of UWorld, done 1 read-through of FA, and had 4 weeks to study. Finished UWorld and read through of FA in first 2 weeks and then did my first NBME. In the last 2 weeks I did 2 more NBMEs, all my UWorld wrongs, some targeted Kaplan wrongs in my weaker areas, and another FA readthrough. Ended up with a 256.  At the end of the day, there are a million plans that can all lead you to the same score. If you are confident in the way you learn, try your best to not feel pressured by other people's study schedules. It is still a good idea to make your own plan...100% encouragement there. Try it out early, adjust it early and often, and rest assured that you'll be fine even if you don't stick to it at all. Second year is rough, but just grind and do your best."

I still tell people that I'm open-minded about all areas of internal medicine because well, it's true. Also, to say you want to subspecialize at this stage of the game may cause you to miss out on a field that may actually be a better fit for you.

medicalschool,3cwxfd,metalaco,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"At our medical school, each clerkship decided its mix of weights for three components:    Subjective evals (based on rubrics),  Shelf/Final exam,  and supplemental other crap (online modules, quizzes, etc.).    Try to balance your effort in each category according to their weight. If the test is >60% of the grade, try to get home early and start reading a book like case files very early in the rotation, just reading a little every day. If the grade is mostly subjective, do less textbook reading and more primary journals at home to impress your attendings and residents on rounds. Be a team player ALWAYS. This is what gets you letters and a good job. And don't neglect the little BS stuff like online modules because sometimes those make or break you.  Regarding tests, usually we would take ours at the end of the rotation (about a month, except for medicine, peds and surgery which were a little longer). Shelf exams look like Step 2, except all the questions are focused on that particular subject (OB/GYN, Medicine, etc.) The surgery exam looks way more like medicine than you'd think. Step 2 questions are designed to make you think about the diagnosis and the next step, and they look as big as this whole wall of text I've just written. Usually, they only rely on a few key details, so they're also testing your ability to find needles in haystacks, too. Another good way to study for a shelf is to buy a yearlong subscription to a Step 2 Qbank (if you can swing it), and just run through those subject's questions once or twice before the test.  Hope that helps!  EDIT: I almost forgot about my favorite site: Online Med Ed. Extremely helpful website for clerkships and 4th year with tons of little videos.

It's not a lot of honors but jesus I was so interested in the material and everything...  because it impacted my Step 1 score more, which would lead to a good residency and more money."

When someone says a disease, you immediately think of 4 things: Who gets it? What is the pathophysiology? What's the natural history? Is there an easy way to treat it?  Network those 4 things and you'll also get a good handle on how it relates to other, similar problems. Then go through UWorld  in tutor mode Six weeks out. Its not an evaluation tool, its a learning tool. Have first aid open in front of you and look up the disease in question. Annotate in the information that FA doesn't have.   Every two weeks take an NBME practice. This is your evaluation tool. Get expanded feedback to see where you need to spend extra time.  Then, spend hours memorizing hundreds of drugs."

medicalschool,3ctuk5,SunglassesDan,8,Fri Jul 10 19:18:38 2015 UTC,That's not a fair comparison - Your GPA/Class Rank are more measures of how hard you worked over a long period of time. The MCAT/USMLE show more how well you can study for standardized tests (and are pretty skewed in favor of those with good test taking skills). A more fair comparison would be between your MCAT vs the class avg against your USMLE vs the class avg. IMO

medicalschool,3ctuk5,TheShaker,-2,Fri Jul 10 22:56:39 2015 UTC,"I've seen the handful of studies that purport a correlation and the reasoning is specious at best. I think most of the relationship is due to personal attributes needed to perform extremely well on the exam. I.e. hardworking. Which has nothing to do with the test per-se. My hunch admittedly unsupported by any data is nevertheless that if you remove the people who did really badly and really well, and just left those within a standard deviation of each other, the correlation would evaporate.  IMO the education industry needs to face the same legal scrutiny as employers with respect to  ""IQ"" tests and similar evaluation methods."

P2 was probably kinda in this boat but more like P3.  P3 has been a rockstar her whole life. She's used to just getting things right away, and so she's relied mostly on talent through school. Not to say this is bad, but she didn't have to develop study habits because she just ""got it"" right away. For her this was a huge flaw when going to med school because now on top of drowning in work like everyone else she has to figure out how to study in the first place. I'm not surprised she had to repeat - she didn't have the tools to succeed.  All in all med school more than anything is about working hard. Really smart people haven't had to work that hard to get by or even do amazingly well. This comes out in med school time and time again. It's a real struggle for them."

You can't paint everyone with the same paintbrush, but typically the super high scorers spend all of their time with their noses in books and have absolutely no people skills. Medicine is all about people. You absolutely have to be able to work well with your colleagues. And you have to be able to relate to your pt and their families.  Knowing the science will go a long way, but you have to relate with people.

Academic common folk might not make as good of grades, but they live a more manageable lifestyle.  Second, yes it is about 50% determination.  It is analogous to Navy Seal training.

They just have to work harder/smarter in order to achieve the level of knowledge needed for medical school.  In the Navy, physical fitness is a necessity just like knowledge is in medical school.  If someone is not physically fit, they will have to work harder than a more fit person in order to pass Seal training.   So, what people may lack in intelligence/fitness, they must make up for with discipline and dedication."

medicalschool,3ctuk5,pmm314,2,Fri Jul 10 22:43:04 2015 UTC,"I've always felt that what we learn in medical school (UK anyway) is no harder than a lot of other subjects. I think a lot of people from my circle of friends (teachers, engineers, sales staff) would be able to handle the 'intellectual rigour' side of it. The difficulty of medical school is the quantity of knowledge more than anything, and determination rather than brains is what will get you through."
medicalschool,3ctuk5,will_da_thrill,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:33:16 2015 UTC,"MCAT and undergrad GPAs are decent predictors of MS performance but as you stated it is a pretty hard thing to predict. People change for starters, some people didn't really apply themselves in undergrad because they didn't know what field they wanted to enter into and lacked direction or they were just unconcerned with their performance for other reasons. MCAT is, in my opinion, a fairly strange exam that lacks the focus of other acceptance tests. So plenty of people can do well in certain aspects of the exam but do horrible on portions that really have little to do with what they will be expected to know for boards. Finally, personality goes a long way. Some people fold under pressure and others lack certain social skills to allow them to excel in certain medical fields. So while they may excel academically they unfortunately can't excel for those other reasons. All in all it is just a hard thing to predict, standards need to be in place though and while they aren't accurate much of the time they are probably close enough for the majority of people, though perhaps they could use some fine tuning which will likely happen with time. Generally I think that if you do well in undergrad you will do well in med school and if you do well preclincally you will do well on boards and clinically. You just never know for sure though, there will always be outliers."

I would also suggest being proactive and introspective if you do have trouble on the first few exams. Of course I'm not suggesting you'll have any problems, but in case you aren't doing well initially I suggest you reach out to your school's academic support services and consult m2s for studying advice. There is a wealth of knowledge out there, especially from the m2s, that you can capitalize on to figure out how and what to study. I've sat in on probation hearings as a student rep, and the students who don't do well are typically the ones who: 1) don't reach out for help from academic support 2) don't seek advice from classmates to see what they're not doing that everyone else is doing and 3)don't change their behavior when what they're doing isn't working.

Thought I wanted to go to graduate school up until half-way through my junior year of college, then slowly realized I had no interest in that. Found myself with a neuroscience degree and no plan, but having already taken the pre-req's for med school, I sort of just decided one night to shoot for that. I spent senior year getting some token extracurricular experiences, shadowing, etc., took the MCAT, and then took a year off doing more or less nothing.  Now, with this in mind, it should surprise nobody that med school has not been a great experience. I obviously didn't put in enough thought into my decision, and I wasn't mentally prepared to put in all this work. Unfortunately, with no clear alternatives and $70k of debt, I'm past the point of no return.  Before getting my Step score back last Wednesday, there was a small but very real part of me that wished for a low score so that I'd have less pressure to do well in my clerkships (I understand that a low score puts more pressure on you to do well in year 3 and 4, but that part of my mind isn't rational), and I had/have convinced myself that I am perfectly content with trying to coast into a psychology residency. It was a complex web of immature defense mechanisms that prepared me for what I thought would be a much lower score than any of my practice NBMEs. I left the exam feeling like it was harder than UWORLD and Kaplan combined. I marked 15-20 questions per block, and many felt like true guesses.  Well, got my score back and did 2 points better than my best practice NBME (got a 256). Unfortunately, it hasn't really motivated me in any way. Still have no clue what competitive field I would have any interest in going into, have no research (and my elective as my very last rotation, so wouldn't have much time to scramble together any papers, abstracts, etc.)...I'm basically kind of feeling meh about everything still."

I'm just worried 3rd year is going to end and I'm going to match into something that I have no interest in, and end up hating my career.

medicalschool,3ctvz2,redplug,2,Fri Jul 10 22:39:32 2015 UTC,Did you study between completing a round of UW and UWSA?
medicalschool,3ctvz2,coffeeandstudybreak,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:23:45 2015 UTC,I was just asking what to do in that hypothetical situation. I am sure others have been in that like OP.   (not directed to you specifically but to anybody) : What would you do then and study?  I've heard people trying to go back to their review books as references but that doesn't always yield improved results.
medicalschool,3ctvz2,redplug,2,Sat Jul 11 02:59:27 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much time you have left and what you mean by completing a round of UW.  I completed 1 round while studying for shelf exams over the year, so when I took my UWSA after one block, but without any additional review, I did okay.  I had just started my dedicated time at that point.  So I started UWorld again and Master the Boards to nail those dumb what's the next best step questions.  Books are helpful, but you really need actual practice on actual questions to really put yourself in the shoes of the test writers.  Obviously if you don't have 2-4 weeks left, it's impossible to just go back through UW again.  Best thing to do is hit the incorrects&marked questions, and then read over the weak sections as suggested by UW and the UWSA."
medicalschool,3cqj04,bigavz,33,Thu Jul 9 23:38:26 2015 UTC,"I would add: make sure you get assigned to the interns/residents/attendings that just click ""excellent"" through the entire evaluation."
medicalschool,3cqj04,TibialisAnterior,6,Fri Jul 10 03:15:49 2015 UTC,"This plus people who wax effusive about your set of skills.  I recently finished a rotation where the attendings I worked with said that I was functioning at the level of a 2nd year resident. (I don't even think that's accurate, but let's continue)   Unfortunately, their commentary in the evaluation forms didn't include that exact phrase, was slightly more generically positive, and also offered a few suggestions for improvement in the ""formative"" section. Everyone can improve, right?  My averages for the competencies were 7 5/5 and 3 4/5. 3/5 is supposed to be average.  The course director for the rotation knows that I'm probably going into psychiatry, and not neurology (the rotation).  Average grade.  EDIT: Sometimes things actually go well? I don't know what prompted it, but he decided to change my grade (and I haven't spoken to him myself, someone must have noticed and gone to bat?) to the top grade."

That said, with regard to the advice, being pro-active, caring about your patients, doing things to make your residents' lives easier and asking questions that show you're interested is exactly what every single person in every orientation for every rotation has ever said.   Except the one chief who said go home and get drunk whenever you can."
medicalschool,3cqj04,DocCalculus,5,Fri Jul 10 03:39:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm glad my residents aren't like this guy in the writeup.  As a starting M3, I left my first day of my medicine rotation feeling absolutely lost (which is probably normal for most people anyway), but in the first week, all of my residents have been awesome. If I have questions about even little things, the chief resident sits down with me and works it out, and actively gives me feedback on how I'm doing and what I can improve upon. First progress note? she sat down with me and gave me great tips about how to make certain parts of it better and more thorough. Went through our entire EMR with me so I don't have to constantly bother them with questions when I need to check an order, and I can make sure that's all done for them so they don't have to worry about it.  If there is some small detail I overlooked, they bring it up in a non-condescending manner and again, provide feedback about how I can improve. I can't ask for much more than that.  Every single presentation of a patient I've given to an attending has gone off without a hitch because of how my residents have helped me, and in return, I'm constantly asking if there's anything I can do, or any orders I can check the results for, etc. I've only been here for a week and we already have a big family-type atmosphere here, and it's actually been a ton of fun. I've already had times where I've presented findings to an attending that weren't previously known, and that's largely because of the help my residents give me to allow me to be better at what I'm doing.  Even residents on services I'm not a part of have come up to me and asked me questions and offered to help me learn something, or allow me to be involved in things.  The resident who did this write-up sounds like a huge fucking dick, to be honest.   Who the fuck proactively goes up to a resident and says ""I'm not interested in your specialty...but help me out with avoiding being someone you will roll your eyes at later?"""
medicalschool,3cqj04,lethalred,4,Sat Jul 11 01:39:21 2015 UTC,"Totally agree!  Maybe I lucked out with first placement, but my IM team (including brand new interns) has been super supportive and very group oriented.  The Sr. resident and attending are always forgiving and up for teaching, even when they're busy.  And don't use uptodate or epocrates for reference or presentations?  Ok, instead of shelf studying, chart reading, or talking to a pt. let me spend 3 days reading reviews so I don't piss you off with my inferior knowledge.  Shit on the other specialty teams by asking how to avoid consulting like them?  Just care...what decent med student is in the wards not caring about patients or learning?  I don't know why this pissed me off so much, but this sounds like a dbag sleep deprived resident expecting new 3rd years to be as competent as interns.  Fuck you and your central line, everybody already knows how hard residents work."
medicalschool,3cqj04,cigarettesteve,4,Sat Jul 11 05:53:34 2015 UTC,"If it's cool with your residents, update the discharge summary of every patient on your team, even when not your patients. Not only is this awesome for your team and makes us think you're the superbest come grading time, but it actually teaches you A TON about what it's like to be a legit doctor. You have to start thinking differently come residency. Your brain needs to learn how to handle juggling distinct, complex narratives on little sleep. This is the best way to get a head start on this. It'll make you a better intern out of the gate."
medicalschool,3cqj04,BillyBuckets,5,Fri Jul 10 11:08:03 2015 UTC,"OP's advice is not sufficient at my institution.   Asking for something to do shows that you lack initiative and haven't been paying attention to the plan of the day on rounds. If you know your patients, you know what needs to get done, including the scut work. (With only a few exceptions.) Missing pimping questions docks your ""fund of knowledge"" score Asking good questions varies by the person being questioned. The Shelf is king. People are judgmental. Do your best to not rub anyone the wrong way. The most efficient way to do this is to have a superficially pleasing, passive personality. The intern always has priority over you on procedures. All the interns do.   What OP wrote is ""how to get an average grade"" at my institution. How to succeed involves scoring 90th percentile on the Shelf, rarely missing pimping questions, delivering succinct, but sufficiently detailed for your particular attending, presentations with a solid plan, +- telling people you want to do their specialty, and all of the other shows-initiative and well-liked stuff."

I can PM you a list if you like.  While the education in China is good, the classes are taught differently there since the drugs that are legal are different, and some of the procedures are different as well. I can't give you specific examples, but I've been told this is true.   I'm not sure how valid a MD or MBBS from China is when you go to the US, but I presume if you score well on your exam you will be fine.  From what my friends say, universities in China try to prepare you for the USMLE, but only for you to pass. I have been told that they are studying for the steps very early.  Also, have you compared your exams to other countries' exams? You may me exceptionally smart!"
medicalschool,3ct4eu,MedicalCat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:18:14 2015 UTC,"Haha, please send me that list! It's just that the teachers give us the scope of the exams, so for most of us it's unmotivating to learn the actual curriculum, rather just study to pass the exam. But most of us have the USMLE in mind... so we do end up studying anyway! Anyways, what's your opinion on the comparison between people who've taken the MCAT versus people like us, who have no knowledge of medicine beforehand? Aren't we at a disadvantage? Or does the age gap compensate? But yes, please do send me that list."
medicalschool,3ct4eu,MedicalCat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:47:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with the MCAT, but I have read research into how it is not good at gauging long term performance at university.  As a student in the UK, I had zero pre-med experience before I went into first year medicine. Our medical course is y1-y2 preclinical theory (premed) and y3-y5 clinical (med) and y6-y7 doctor foundation years. I'm a second year now, and I'm finding it OK, although there is a huge amount of work squeezed into a small space, since we have less time to learn everything.  I would say as long as you are motivated and you are intelligent enough, you can compete with those who have had pre-med or biomedical experience. You'll definitely have to work harder than those who have done a premed course, as you are playing catch up with them.  Some of my friends doing medicine (after pre-med) in the US are just incredibly intelligent, but when I talk to them they attribute it to their motivation"

I'm not in the US system so I'm going to wait until I'm qualified before doing the steps/usmle.

medicalschool,3csjvh,SundaySocks,8,Fri Jul 10 12:47:16 2015 UTC,"I struggled A LOT with feeling faint during surgeries because I was so prone to having my BP bottom out from standing up for too long. Several things helped me get through it. #1: compression socks, these helped me tremendously and I didn't start getting the nausea/sick feeling til much later in surgeries compared to without them, if I got it at all. #2: Stay hydrated and EAT SOMETHING before surgeries. Always try to have snacks in your pockets or at least down a small thing of soda before going in to get some sugar in your system (both is better). #3: keep yo legs moving during those long surgeries. It's not enough to just make sure knees aren't locking up, you've got to be actively bending those legs, shuffling, stretching.. Whatever it takes to prevent feeling faint. And don't wait til you start feeling bad to do this or it's too late.  And worst case scenario, it is ALWAYS better to speak up and say you feel faint and need to sit down than to actually pass out on the floor and risk breaking the sterile field. Not to mention now your surgeon has to deal with the case and your sorry passed out butt that's laying all over the floor. Just try not to let it happen frequently (luckily I never had to ask to sit more than once with any one attending/ resident).  As you can tell, I will not be going into a surgery-related field haha. I just did what I could to freakin survive that rotation. Hope this helps someone."

I first noticed I did better in surgeries with music playing in the background and I had no idea why until I realized it was because I kept at least one of my legs constantly moving to the beat of a song during those times. Afterwards I'd just get a song stuck in my head and do the same thing during surgeries without music and it worked great. But good advice with the stool too."

Question prompts were generally longer on the real deal though- more like uworld length or longer.  For study strategies- two weeks is a TON of time.   I'd start by picking the uworld categories that you're worst at and doing those until they don't feel so confusing.

If you find that you're running out of time on the practice tests, then maybe do some timed blocks here and there.  I went through all of uworld during the year, then got through as much of it as I could again during my 2 1/2 weeks dedicated study time.  I ended up focusing on my weak areas towards the end (mine were OB, Urology, cardio), because I realized I wasn't going to get through everything again.   I got a 243 on NBME 6 two weeks out, and a 252 on UWSA three days out.   I'd recommend doing more practice test if you have time.

Point is, I was suffering from serious depression and anxiety issues that prevented me from functioning anywhere close to my capabilities. I was so disappointed in myself and many times didn't want to go on and considered killing myself.   It's easy to suffer a defeat and think ""I'm worthless, I'm an idiot, I'm just not capable of doing X, Y, or Z,"" but the fact of the matter is that it is almost certain that you have something else at play. I'm not saying you have mental health issues like me, but it's one avenue to explore. Another is simply motivation; it's entirely possible that deep down this isn't what you wanted. Take some time to figure out what your true passions are and what your skill sets are. There are so many roads to leading a happy life. Don't stop now just because one of them is closed.

If you still really want to be a doctor you have a long road ahead of you, probably involving retaking and acing those prereq classes and doing the MCAT again. You will have to figure out how to adjust your study habits to handle the material. At this point in your life you are not cut out to be a doctor and be in charge of people's health.

Just remember when you're hating yourself that somewhere down the road you'll be happy again. It's trite and probably not what you want to hear right now, but you gotta pick yourself back up. Take the time you need to let the bad feelings run their course, but this doesn't define you or what you're capable of.  I wish you the best man, truly."

medicalschool,3cus0m,pastavangelist,3,Fri Jul 10 23:08:51 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that whatever you're looking at means your academic medical center has a residency in those specialties. You can still match into a specialty even if your school isn't associated with a residency for it--it just might make it a little harder due to lack of good advising. For example, my school lacks an EM residency, so for the past few years students wanting to go into EM have had to jump through extra hoops (doing extra away rotations, etc.) and kind of figure out what they were doing on their own b/c there wasn't a lot of good advice about how to get into an EM program these days (which I'm sure is mostly due to the fact that EM is getting much more competitive pretty quickly and all of the EM attendings at our hospital trained long ago). But people still get in; it's just more stressful.  Same rules as always apply for competitive specialties: the better a reputation your school has, the better of a chance you have of getting into a competitive program."

I kind of thought I would have no problem dedicating my life to medicine, but have found that I don't like the fields that I thought I would, particularly internal medicine and family medicine.

Cancer treatment is also very cookbook medicine.  I've decided I'm going into diagnostic radiology. I actually like patients. But I hate the medical system.  I honestly would probably do primary care medicine if I just had the autonomy and control of treating my patients the way that I want to--no dealing with insurance companies or government guidelines and regulations (some are good, most are annoying).

There are a lot of instances where the treatment received depends on the mutations present in the tumor - triple-negative breast cancer vs. targeting ER, or HER2/neu.  Very different treatments.  Or the PD-1 inhibitors and how they've transformed metastatic melanoma from a death sentence into something with survivors.  Precision medicine with whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing is also emerging, and will give us a much more broad picture of the driving mutations in each specific individual's cancer, and potentially drastically change treatment paradigms.  Obviously it'd be nice if the pace was faster, but the deeper you get into it, you realize cancer is ridiculously heterogeneous.    tl;dr Oncology isn't necessarily as cookbook as you think at the big research institutions these days."

First Aid is awesome as long as you're reading a factoid and asking yourself why, why, why. Try to rationalize things and you can remember them better. Also, the purchasable NBMEs are useful, I mean there is no feedback but you can see what you missed and look up answers and learn new factoids. Don't cheat yourself and recreate the test setting. I just got my score yesterday, 263, and I honestly was expecting around 250 based off my nbme performance. It kinda blew my mind, but I think a 13 point jump like that was partially lucky. Most of my friends was in their nbme range with some people having their score near their lowest (but still prepared) NBME. UWorld a second time will help as long as you ask yourself why why why if you feel you're just memorizing an answer. Memorizing an answer isn't entirely useless if it's a factoid. Knowing what builds up in some enzyme deficiency disease is helpful in itself if you feel memorizing a huge pathway won't be helpful. I know that I have endurance and a good test IQ just from taking so many practice and standardized tests and having gone through a shit ton of questions.

But I think you're onto something.  Maybe it's something to do with studying for two years with the knowledge of a test in the future which changes the way people think about the test.  Most premeds didn't think about the MCAT until a year or so before the took it  (and many far less than that).

It's seriously fucked up how this test is the one thing that will stop you from your dream.  The best thing to do is try to sign up as soon as you can and ace that shit. I've learned that in the CIS portion they want you to include some small with the patient. aka ""oh that must be an awesome job"" or ""you have 2 kids, how funnnn"". Oddly enough that is how I talk to my real patients and you underestimate the importance of it in the actual exam. i personally was so invested in making sure I did the write maneuvers, was polite, and if my diagnosis was right.

medicalschool,3cqxgg,FenixAK,4,Fri Jul 10 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"Depends, I know my school has ""faculty"" that purely just teach a few med students or residents.  At least at my school, they work for our affiliated hospitals, primarily.  The physicians that work directly under my school and within the various departments (i.e. Ortho, Uro, Plastics, etc), all sort of have hybrid duties.  While they teach med students and residents, they also head the research labs and pump out a lot of research.  In total honestly, they don't always write their own grants, or even work on the research that they publish.  Thats what fellows and med students are for.  I can tell you that in order to get into those positions, they had to have a lot of research experience and prior pubs.   While my school isn't a big NIH research school, we have a few heavy hitting researchers in a few of the specialties.  I've been able to publish 5 articles in mostly high impact journals during M1-M2.  This would definitely help me if I wanted to apply to more research oriented programs, and that would pave the way to a career in academics.

I did this and no one really asked about it on my interview trail (all my letters were from one city however, so I was asked about that, especially at programs far away from that city - ""why do you want to come here, it's so far away from your home school and places you auditioned). I did it because I was went into EM and was told you could only get letters from places you rotated at and it's highly suggested to be from only EM docs (which apparently might not be true). My first audition wasn't until September so I needed them because ERAS had already opened up and most programs won't even begin processing your application without at least two letters."
medicalschool,3cqa0x,RedEM43,2,Thu Jul 9 23:31:12 2015 UTC,"How did this work out?  I'm in a similar situation, have one home rotation early but don't have an away until October.  So I won't have my second letter in until the end of October or even early November.  Will it be problematic getting EM interviews do you think?"
medicalschool,3cqa0x,velcrowranit,2,Fri Jul 10 00:12:25 2015 UTC,"First of all, congrats on picking an awesome speciality!  Quick background on my situation: I'm from the midwest and my home city has a few different hospitals with EM programs. I had some aways scheduled but my school cancelled them at the last minute due to incompetence and inflexibility regarding scheduling, so I ended up getting all my letters from home programs (4 letters from 3 different ones).   The associate PD of one of my home programs ,who was also my ""mentor"" regarding applications, as well as our school's residency advisor both said programs won't start looking at your application until at least two letters are in. Since my first rotation was in September and ended in late Sept (after ERAS opened up) I made sure to work with one attending very closely to ask him for a letter in addition to the rotation director's letter. Programs won't start looking at applications until October 1st, which is when you're Dean's letter is released from your med school, but it is important to have two letters by this time. My first letter was in by October 1st, but my second letter wasn't in until a week later. In that time I only got three interviews, two from home programs (which are obligated to interview us, I think) and one from another program which is probably amongst the weakest programs I applied to. After my second letter got in, I got significantly more invites. My third letter came in 3 quarters through october (got a handful of more invites after this) and my fourth letter right before thanksgiving (got 1-2 invites and a couple of waitlists after this).   tl;dr so ultimately, yes, I think it is important to have two letters by October 1st, or as soon as possible after. Try to move up your away or schedule another EM based elective (even toxicology, EMS, peds EM, etc.) September/August  if you can. Worst case scenario you can thrown in a non-EM letter, but I would talk to an advisor before doing this.   Edit: and of course there are a lot of other factors that go into this (board scores, etc.) so keep that in mind. It's not completely based on letters but again, to my understanding from what the associate program director told me, most programs won't look at your application until you have at least two letters in.

So if I'm not able to fill in September (which it's looking unlikely), I'd be best off by getting a SLOE from my home department, and maybe a personal letter from one of the EM attendings who knows me well?  That way at least I have 2 letters in (though only 1 is a true SLOE) by October 1?  Then when I get my second and third SLOEs from my October and November aways I'll just add them.    Last question is: what was the latest date you had available for an interview?  Do they interview into January or are they mostly finished before the year is out?   I appreciate it!"
medicalschool,3cqa0x,velcrowranit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:17:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah that sounds like a good plan! I didn't have any non-SLOE letters but I know a few people who did and they said it wasn't an issue.   My last interview was at the end of January. I had thanksgiving to new years off so I intentionally scheduled most of my interviews then (especially the ones that were farther away), but most programs have dates to select going through January. My home programs interviewed in October, and I scheduled close by programs in November and January when I was still on rotation. I don't think any EM program interviews in February.  Oh and side note! When you start getting invites they will either come through as a message in ERAS that will be forwarded to your email, or they will go through a program called InterviewBroker which is an independent website that about a third of my programs used to schedule. The first time I got an InterviewBroker invite it went to the updates folder in gmail, not my main mail, so I didn't see it until the next day. By the time I noticed only the last day was available- so I almost missed out big time. Make sure you are checking all your mail/folders!!"

While it basically just changes how we store data and our notes, this has been extremely noticeable in practice. In EMS, I started out by writing reports on multi-layered copy forms and soon got to use EMR which allowed us to easily take notes while on runs as well as more accurate time keeping as well as being able to instantly send the report to the hospital where the ED docs could look over it without having to search all over for where it was dropped. Then, when I got into my clinical years in medical school, almost every service has used EMR and it's mindblowingly easy to look up previous encounters and test results from even years ago. The few services where I have had to use paper charts really underline the problems with those handwritten notes. Illegible scribbles which may be the only note regarding a procedure make it near impossible to effectively review a chart. Lab data is often missing or out of place. And trying to find ONE result or ONE bit of information can take a considerable chunk of time whereas on the computer you just have a few clicks and it's laid out in front of you. I mean the dang thing even trends data on request.   There are a lot of amazing and game changing technologies out there, but I feel the EMR has got to be one of the most important and tangible changes we've seen in recent history."

I am sure this sounds curmudgeonly, but I got lots more useful information out of hand-written notes than any EMR I have used.  When you hand-write a note, you make sure to include what is really relevant, and you don't waste time with the extraneous details.  When I receive patients in-transfer from other institutions, I have to plow through 20 pages of irrelevant medication orders and vital signs checks just to get to the part that explains why the patient is being transferred, and sometimes even that information is missing."

But if you're a general surgeon, you have nothing to worry about since someone still has to do the cutting, or operate the robot that does the cutting.

Another issue is Watson can tell you how accurate it feels that it's diagnosis is. So imagine this down the line after you miss a cancer diagnosis or miss an infection. ""So Dr ____, Watson said there was an 73% chance of metastasis, but you were convinced there wasn't any mets and decided not to treat. Care to explain?"" And this isn't just oncology related.

medicalschool,3cp2lo,MikeDBil,12,Thu Jul 9 17:06:05 2015 UTC,"I'm an MD/PhD student and my wife is a practicing MD-MBA. We have very different career trajectories, and realistically, there's very little reason to get all three degrees, as least this early in your career.  What do you think you want to do in your career? Your four options seem like: ""just"" an MD, MD/PhD, MD/MBA, or an MD now and a PhD (or research time) during fellowship. First, to clear a few misconceptions:   1) Nearly all PhD students (in the biological sciences) get paid, whether it's in an MD-PhD program, doing a PhD later, or as a straight PhD student  2) You don't need a PhD to run a lab or have a research group as an independent investigator. I know a lot of faculty members who are ""MD only"", but spent substantial time during fellowship doing lab research, and decided that's where they wanted to take their careers. It's very possible (though a little harder, according to the data) to get the same type of funding with ""only"" an MD (R01 etc). Many fellowship programs have protected research time built in, and some also have T32 training grants to fund your research time. It's very possible to get faculty jobs that are your desired mix of clinical and research (anything from 75/25 or 5/95) without having the PhD  3) The MBA is going to be useful to you if you want to get involved in health system management, or if you want to not practice and get a job (consulting, etc). Unfortunately, there are only a few academic medical centers that will allow you to really take advantage of your MBA as a resident or even as junior faculty. The MD-MBA is a relatively new thing, and many places don't really know what to do with MD/MBA graduates. If research is what you want to do, I see little reason to do an MBA now. The MBA may be the right decision much later down the line when you want to bolster your credentials for department chair-level positions.   .  So given all that, why should anyone want to do the joint MD/PhD?  *I would say you should be fairly certain you want to have a career that has a substantial research component.   *The advantage of doing a PhD versus just doing research during fellowship is that the PhD provides some formalized training into the art of doing science that you have to learn on your feet as a research fellow. In my field (computational bioengineering), there was a very steep learning curve to be able to do the research work I do, and the ability to take coursework during that time was really important to me.   *Another advantage of doing the PhD as part of a combined degree program rather than later is that doing a PhD is a huge time commitment and doing it during fellowship will put a 3-7 year gap in your clinical training. Many people who do 1-2 years of research time during fellowship still do some patient care, but as a PhD student, you're going to need to go 100% into your research, so when you come out, you won't have practice medicine for the past half decade. If you do a joint degree program, you'll potentially leave the clinical world for a couple years during fellowship to do a research fellowship/post-doc, but it's very possible to keep up some clinical work during that time.  *In addition, a ""softer"" advantage for me was the community aspect of doing an MD/PhD. In a dual degree program, you're in a cohort of students doing the same crazy thing as you, which is huge for your own sanity. If you decide to do a PhD during fellowship, you'll essentially be stepping out of the clinical world for an extended period, and your fellowship classmates will keep cruising along and be making $$$ in their attending jobs.  Hope that helps!"

My program is a little different and allows us to do a year of clinical rotations before starting the PhD. This was actually one of the reasons I chose to come here because I wasn't sure what I wanted to go into, and the clinical year helped me figure out my research interest."
medicalschool,3cp2lo,BillyBuckets,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:00:53 2015 UTC,"See that's the reason I am so hesitant to do the combined degree program because I haven't hit hospital yet and I have no idea what I want to do and I don't want to do a PhD in an area that I won't be practicing in when I'm a physician. That's where doing the PhD in residency definitely has the advantage. The residency programs, where people do grad degrees, I have heard of here in Canada keep you working in the hospital over your time too I think, in order to keep your skills up. But honestly, that's just hear-say from other med students about people they 'know'."

It's very possible (though a little harder, according to the data) to get the same type of funding with ""only"" an MD (R01 etc).   It's getting very difficult. The days of the MD-only lab PI are probably nearing an end in the US so long as the NIH budget remains where it is now.

medicalschool,3cp2lo,xi_mezmerize_ix,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:36:53 2015 UTC,You're right: the statistics that I've seen already showed that it was harder for MD-only PIs to get R01's and that was from early-2000s data when the funding climate was a little more friendly. We have quite a few established faculty who are MD-only but joining that group is probably getting harder and harder.

medicalschool,3cp2lo,murpahurp,3,Thu Jul 9 18:26:16 2015 UTC,"Plus MD/PhD programs are great for establishing a network of connections and a publication track record that helps you get into your residency.   My residency interview experience was almost awkward because faculty were so interested in my research background. PDs, department chairs, and other high-ups would often run way over time when talking to me as we discussed science and applications of my PhD work.  I would leave the room to find a very annoyed applicant waiting for their now-abbreviated interview. If you are aiming to match at a competitive academic program, the PhD is a huge asset. Plus, you can apply to PSTPs (if your field has them) and get a fellowship rolled into your residency. Excellent way to get started on creating a lab of your own."
medicalschool,3cp2lo,koriolisah,2,Thu Jul 9 20:30:54 2015 UTC,"It depends on the type of research you plan on doing. Medical research for non doctors is limited to animal experiments, lab work and database research. If you want to do clinical research with humans, you need the MD first.   I'm doing a PhD in the Netherlands as an MD because I despise animal experiments and genomic research. And I didn't want two full time tasks at the same time. I can't tell you about the MD/PhD track because the medical training is very different here, though in general I believe that the MD/PhD is harder than just doing your PhD (and not being a resident on the side)."

Not sure what specialty you're looking to go into, but residency positions which offer protected time for research are not very common. I've been quoted numbers to the tune of only one spot in many major residency programs. MD/PhD applicants are much more competitive for these spots.   I will be doing my PhD in between preclinicals and clerkships, and I can't wait. I'd rather do it now while in med school then put it off until later when it seems like doing the degree at all is less of a certainty."

Your school name likely has little to do with that.   Obviously residency performance matters but there are indirect advantages to going to top schools. Going to a top medical school gives you more opportunities for networking with your fellow alums in the same way going to a top undergraduate program matters. Then again this is confounded by the correlation that individuals who go to top medical schools typically are just more talented to begin with and also end up at very good academic residencies.  But it's what you make of it. If all you want to do is run a clinic in private practice, probably doesn't really matter. But, connections you make as an undergraduate and med student/grad student are pretty big especially if you want to be involved in more than just the clinical practice of medicine (e.g. business, technology development)."

medicalschool,3co85t,HarlemtoChelsea,-4,Thu Jul 9 21:28:22 2015 UTC,"Middle-class patients, doing medical cases? No problem.   Cosmetics on wealthy upper east side housewives, having practice privilege at NY-p, etc? Not in a million years.   Sorry people are getting butthurt at the truth."
medicalschool,3co85t,TA43214,7,Thu Jul 9 22:31:23 2015 UTC,wealthy upper east side housewives care about quality outcomes. not what med school their surgeon went to.  source: wealthy upper east side housewife's son
medicalschool,3co85t,Beeip,4,Fri Jul 10 02:26:58 2015 UTC,Get 'em.
medicalschool,3co85t,docfelt,3,Fri Jul 10 02:43:30 2015 UTC,"All I know is he has a cash only cosmetic practice.  He was doing really well.  Seems totally plausible to me, I don't know why it doesn't to you."
medicalschool,3cpn2v,forevermedicine,11,Thu Jul 9 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"DO school.  Two that I know of and have talked to in person.  One 270.  If there are more, I'm unaware of it and the class size is relatively large (200)."
medicalschool,3cpn2v,docfelt,5,Thu Jul 9 21:23:12 2015 UTC,My class had 3/40 (that I know of) over 260.
medicalschool,3cpn2v,MunkiRench,2,Thu Jul 9 19:49:37 2015 UTC,you only have 40 students in your class?
medicalschool,3cpn2v,BEWARE_OF_BEARD,8,Thu Jul 9 23:11:08 2015 UTC,Mayo haha

medicalschool,3cpn2v,hokietapes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:52:08 2015 UTC,"42 is the standard for my school, but we had a couple MPHs mixed in. Not Mayo :)"
medicalschool,3cpn2v,MunkiRench,5,Thu Jul 9 23:36:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely more than 10, and I've also heard of several 270+ in my class."
medicalschool,3cpn2v,CranialNerve,-1,Thu Jul 9 20:29:03 2015 UTC,"several 270+??? Hmm, I wonder if you go to Penn, WashU, or Harvard."
medicalschool,3cpn2v,HarlemtoChelsea,2,Thu Jul 9 20:34:07 2015 UTC,Nope

medicalschool,3cpn2v,redditownsmylife,-4,Sat Jul 11 12:19:14 2015 UTC,"hopkins, yale, ucsf?"
medicalschool,3cpn2v,cyberspecies46,7,Thu Jul 9 20:49:50 2015 UTC,"Haha not playing this game, but a top 20 school."
medicalschool,3cpn2v,CranialNerve,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:01:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to clue in on your school, I promise, but what is your class size?  10 out of 150 for example is incredibly impressive."
medicalschool,3cpn2v,docfelt,2,Thu Jul 9 21:25:18 2015 UTC,160
medicalschool,3cpn2v,CranialNerve,2,Thu Jul 9 22:38:28 2015 UTC,Damn.  That's an impressive class you're a part of.  Congrats.
medicalschool,3cpn2v,docfelt,6,Thu Jul 9 22:51:56 2015 UTC,Pretty sure ucsf has average step 1 scores. AFAIK Baylor and Vandy are the top step 1 schools.
medicalschool,3cpn2v,kneedeep3,-10,Thu Jul 9 23:29:12 2015 UTC,"I've heard this as well. FWIW, top schools don't need top step scores in order to match well.  Someone from JHU with a 220 can comfortably match into any specialty anywhere in the country, while someone with a 250 from no-name U has to still bust ass to match in a competitive specialty."
medicalschool,3cpn2v,br0mer,9,Fri Jul 10 11:15:18 2015 UTC,Someone from JHU with a 220 can comfortably match into any specialty anywhere in the country   no

medicalschool,3cpn2v,br0mer,2,Thu Jul 9 20:11:11 2015 UTC,We also had about 4-5 out of approximately 140 students.
medicalschool,3cpn2v,Natallon,2,Thu Jul 9 20:27:10 2015 UTC,"4/160, no 270s in my class, and an overall avg of 224."
medicalschool,3cpn2v,rufaterd,2,Thu Jul 9 20:40:19 2015 UTC,not very rare. (avg in 240s)
medicalschool,3cpn2v,reddityeah,2,Fri Jul 10 00:37:05 2015 UTC,10+/100. 2 got 270+
medicalschool,3cpn2v,sonicthehedgefund,2,Fri Jul 10 01:59:51 2015 UTC,Mid tier state school of class ~140. I can name 4 with >260 though I think there may be another one or two. One 270+ that I know of.
medicalschool,3cpn2v,jeanjacques_rousseau,2,Fri Jul 10 02:53:22 2015 UTC,This link has percentiles for step 1 and step 2.  http://www.usmle.org/pdfs/transcripts/USMLE_Step_Examination_Score_Interpretation_Guidelines.pdf

medicalschool,3cpcih,theJexican18,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"LectureNotes has the best capability to do this. You can set up a template and go from there.   Otherwise, Papyrus, Adobe Reader, and EZPdfReader will allow you to edit a PDF file so you could make a template PDF and edit that."
medicalschool,3cpcih,prestomedico,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:26:03 2015 UTC,"I can tell you that from personal experience this is more of a cool concept rather than a practical application. Writing on a tablet is far too slow for most clinical situations. I would instead focus on learning how to write short and brief personal notes that help with your memory of the interaction. You will get a lot more details in your H&P by being engaged in conversation instead of focusing on writing everything down. Use the back of your signout sheets to jot down any to-do's or notes, and write H&P stuff directly on a patient's sheet. Efficiency is key, and its a skill you'll learn as you move forward. Tablets are useful for other things in the clinical setting: patient education, looking up things on UpToDate or wikipedia, filling out patient logs if your school requires that, text books."
