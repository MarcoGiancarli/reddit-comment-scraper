Of course, I finished S7-a well before S7-b had finished airing. So, I went back to Season 6... then 5... then 4... until I had watched the entire series in reverse-season-order. As you might expect, this revealed all kinds of fascinating things! (for example, the S5 finale includes a line from Alexis Bledel about a ""door"" that opens up amidst her depression, beckoning her to the other side. First episode of S6? The Doorway, offering an extended metaphor about doors and death)  Anyway, I was about half-way through S1 when the series finale finally aired, at which point I was so hyped up on the show's mythology that I... well, I just kept on watching the series forward after I finished S1, ultimately re-watching the entire series again, this time in the proper order.   By the time I reached the last episode (again), I wasn't even close to fatigued. I've had to resist restarting it all over again, and may have watched The Suitcase a couple times stand-alone.

They seem more fitting for a working-class guy or a tough guy noir type. (Don has always reminded me a bit of a noir detective. I think one of the women in the show even says he seems like a private detective, though I can't remember who.)    Vodka and gin seem to fit a bit better with an upper-class, aristocratic character. It seems ""classier"" to sip on a vodka martini than it does to sip on whiskey. Also the colors seem to match: Mr Tall-Dark-and-Handsome Draper drinking brown liquor, Roger the Silver Fox preferring clear spirits."
madmen,3dvcif,Andrew_W_Kennedy,30,Sun Jul 19 21:36:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with the colour aesthetic.

To me it was mainly part of Roger's characterization, an extra detail added to help make his character more rounded. Sticking to clear liquors really seems like a rationalization an old school alcoholic would make, thinking they they're not going too hard as long as they stick to vodka and gin (which are usually just as strong, if not stronger, then their darker counterparts)."
madmen,3dvcif,captsgt,8,Sun Jul 19 21:58:31 2015 UTC,I guess it's because gin/vodka are 'lighter' spirits. They're not as harsh to drink.
madmen,3dvcif,BeatlesForSale,8,Sun Jul 19 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"That's not very true, is it? Vodka is considered hard liquor and can obliterate an unsuspecting person who can't handle their alcohol. And at any rate, I wouldn't think that Roger prefers vodka because it's light.  Vodka and vodka-based cocktails are usually considered classy, like martinis, bloody mary, gimlets. And Roger comes from an upper-class family, so I'm guessing that's what he usually had growing up. People who regularly consume alcohol usually have an affinity with a particular type of drink. Plus, you can barely smell vodka on someone (which came in handy when Roger had his first heart attack) and it has a great kick. Who wouldn't love it?"
madmen,3dvcif,pierreor,8,Sun Jul 19 21:52:23 2015 UTC,I meant light as in terms of taste. It's not as harsh as things like whisky.   personally I hate vodka. Just can't enjoy it. Gin all the way!
madmen,3dvcif,BeatlesForSale,2,Sun Jul 19 21:54:49 2015 UTC,I can drink a bottle of vodka and have no issue the next day. If I were to drink a bottle of whiskey I'd be hungover for like 3 days. Some people have a reaction to the congeners and whiskey is chock full of them.
madmen,3dvcif,DarkSideMoon,2,Sun Jul 19 23:01:22 2015 UTC,Vodka is considered upper class?
madmen,3dvcif,fjanko,5,Sun Jul 19 22:24:03 2015 UTC,It was up until the late 90's. Whisk(e)y production the world over was seriously struggling due to lack demand as it was considered an old mans drink. The rise of the Yuppie brought Vodka into fashion.
madmen,3dvcif,WhiskyBraj,4,Sun Jul 19 22:34:27 2015 UTC,"I guess you'll have to take my word for it, but, yeah.  It doesn't have to be expensive or infused with gold to be an upper-class beverage. These things are sometimes random, like with imported beer. Heineken is a cheap lager everywhere in Europe, but it was considered a continental delicacy on Betty's dinner table (and that's how it really was for the early 60s suburban family.) Stolis are Roger's favourite and they would be considered 'premium' vodka."
madmen,3dvcif,pierreor,-6,Sun Jul 19 22:32:21 2015 UTC,"Vodka and vodka-based cocktails are usually considered classy, like martinis   Martinis are made with gin. If anyone makes one with vodka they are doing it wrong."
madmen,3dvcif,damac_phone,17,Sun Jul 19 22:01:30 2015 UTC,"Look, they aren't doing it wrong. They are making vodka martinis. It's a recipe probably as old as martini itself, and James Bond likes vodka martinis. They are perfectly acceptable."
madmen,3dvcif,pierreor,3,Sun Jul 19 22:19:58 2015 UTC,"In the 60's the traditional American drink, Whiskey began to lose serious ground both to imported Vodka and Beer.   Remember in Ladies Room when Kinsey mentions the man of the future drinking Vodka specifically.  Don drink whiskey because he's old fashioned and because its what he grew up with. Canadian Whiskey (namely Rye), was imported in huge quantities in the depression era and Don simply never left the habit.   Its a nice tie to his poor, dirt-farmer roots.   Roger is more trendy and fashionable and so as the series started he drank a lot of Vodka.   If you google hangover prevention, you'll see a lot about clear liquors (namely Vodka and Rum) being more easily processable for the human frame than things like scotch and whiskey. These claims are somewhat dubious but are nevertheless widely believed.   This probably inspired the scene in Six Month Leave where Roger mentions he stands liquor better sticking to the clear stuff.  Other than that, I think its largely generational; Don likes beer but being a high functioning alcoholic, finds it unsatisfying compared to neat whiskey. That, plus, back then it wasn't fashionable for high powered businessmen to drink beer in public (see the Heineken episode for instance).   You see it in other characters too. Freddy, who has about ten years on Don and maybe even a couple years on Roger, primarily drinks Bourbon.   Peggy was ""raised on whiskey"" but on the other hand doesn't seem too choosey.   Duck drinks Gin, maybe because of his time in England but also maybe because martinis were such a fashionable cocktail in the 1950's (his heyday). There's also the Hemingway angle. He believed that gin didn't smell as strongly as other liquors so you could get away with more drinking it throughout the day (indeed Gin is made from Juniper berries and if you smell it, it kinda smells like a Christmas Tree).   Campbell drinks scotch, because hes always been rich and able to afford it, and because he's never hit the bottle the way other characters have.  Cigarettes gave a smiliar look at the timeframe of the series.   From '60-'69 the unfiltered luckies and camels of Roger & Don's generation steadily lost ground to their lighter, filtered competitors.   You'll notice Cosgrove smokes Marlboro Reds (as does Joan). And later on we see how big of an account Virginia Slim would be for either SC or CGC if they could only land it. Even Betty would up smoking long, elegant, mentholated Salems.   If Jim Cutler had his way, SC&P would have been helping to sell Newports to black kids off of ice cream trucks."
madmen,3dvcif,greasylake,5,Tue Jul 21 06:59:03 2015 UTC,He does this because vodka is odorless. Also because drinks like whiskey have been superstitiously associated with wild drunken behavior.

madmen,3dvcif,xenotime,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:10:59 2015 UTC,"Well, brown liquor could be blended, could be aged different ways, all that.  American whiskey can be any number of things from corn based to sugar based.  Bourbon can be high rye or high wheat, there's more variance in proof...  I don't get on that theory necessarily.  But I'm not Roger."
madmen,3dvcif,skippapotamus,-3,Sun Jul 19 22:23:09 2015 UTC,"Do you think there's any significance in Roger's preference for clear liquor?   no. matthew weiner's mad men universe is intricate and full of symbolism, repeated motifs, ambiguity and contradiction. i'm sure we could flesh out some sort of meaning in regards to roger's preference for clear liquor (he has white hair!), don's preference for whiskey (he likes brunettes!), but sometimes people just like what they like, simple as that."
madmen,3dvcif,jimcutlers_buttspeed,7,Sun Jul 19 21:38:13 2015 UTC,"I do think it makes sense though that they chose brown liquor for Don as a contrast to Roger's clear liquor as part of their general color schemes, and I do agree with /u/Andrew_W_Kennedy  when he says Don's drink of choice reflects his more working class upbringing (in contrast to Roger)"

I will say though- I watched all of season 1 of Rectify and all of Party Down on Netflix, fell in love, and made it a point to download the series.

madmen,3drp0i,Johnnycc,4,Sat Jul 18 20:26:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, and I'd also add that it was greatly satisfying in the way I think it inspires you to use your imagination to create for yourself how Don and/or Peggy created that ad in the time between the final shot of Don and the jump cut straight to the commercial.  You can create whatever series of events you want based on your own ideas about the show and the characters, which is very cool open-ending with the creation & airing of the commercial as both a final event and also a springboard to the imagined place of your choosing.  I'd say it builds on the the did he?/didn't he? yes/no Sopranos ending -- to create a whatever-you-think ending based on knowing that the Coke commercial was made but not being told how.  Plus?  I love the feels it gives me.  I'm happy for Don.  He's not only accepted and embraced his true self to himself, but he's also allowed himself to embrace the influence of his outside world and reflect it in his work in a way that he didn't in previous episodes (I'm thinking of the Martinson's coffee jingle and the ""don't use celebrity endorsements Peggy"" moments, even though he riffed on the Ali photo for Samsonite.)  Now he's made that thing of lasting value, as you say, making a difference in a way we can all appreciate -- because the difference is also in his character.  I've watched the ending over 10 times now since it aired. Thanks for your post."
madmen,3drp0i,Obey_the_D,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:39:54 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting point. The implication of the Coke ad forces us to imagine how the narrative might have continued, which contributes the feeling that these characters' lives cary on after the final credits."
madmen,3drp0i,dreamshoes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:19:53 2015 UTC,"I also think the way in which the show was about the sixties as much as advertising, I thought the choice to end the series on a note that did not include the Manson Family Murders/Altamont end to the sixties to be refreshing.  And, in the same way the pilot opens and shows us a very 1950's way of life in 1960, the finale ends in 1970 with a perfect commercial ad representation of where the seventies is going: counter culture is turning to consumer culture, and this ad/ending perfectly shows that -- while ALSO making me feel good.  Do I feel good about feeling that?  Hmmm.  The ending is satisfying, thought-provoking, feel-good but also it forces me to think about how manipulative media is: ""you are okay (AND BUY THIS PRODUCT OR SERVICE.)""  I really miss this show in my life.  EDIT: a typo"
madmen,3drp0i,Obey_the_D,4,Sun Jul 19 03:41:17 2015 UTC,"I appreciate what you say, and objectively agree with it all. However, I just wanted to voice my opinion because I've been thinking about it since the finale premiered. I know it's super long winded, and this might not be the best place, but I think I need to get this down in writing:  I felt like the first five seasons of Mad Men differentiated itself from other shows because it wasn't a show. Even the best shows I see, even the ones I get deeply emotionally invested in, are shows; they have their characterization, symbolism, plots, etc. For me, Mad Men was just life and people. There weren't plots but just people living life, there wasn't characterization but just people learning and changing (or not changing) through experiences, there weren't ""lines"" but just people expressing themselves, and the same goes for all other typical elements of a show. The world felt connected to real life more than any other tv show or movie I've ever felt.  Starting in season 6, this changed for me. I still appreciated and loved seasons 6 & 7, but barring a few episodes, it felt like a show again. Maybe it was because it had grown into such a cultural phenomenon, but I felt like there was a script, and characters, and a plot, instead of talking, people, and life. I started analyzing it like a normal tv show or movie, for metaphors and connections, antagonists and protagonists, instead of experiencing it.  I felt like the finale was the epitome of that feeling I got in seasons 6 & 7. I think from an artistic/tv perspective, it was a genius ending. The references to the beginning, its commentary on culture, the placement of every scene. But again, I felt like it was Matthew Weiner behind the scenes grinning as he nailed all the lines and connections, completing his masterpiece, instead of these people and this world continuing on living.  I may be putting Mad Men on an unrealistic pedestal, but I felt like the finale was an amazing tv show ending, yet didn't satisfy me as a Mad Men ending, partially because I felt it tried too hard to satisfy. I don't have any perfect replacements, but I'd have preferred something which didn't seem to define a beginning and ending spot for the characters, something along the lines of the endings of At the Codfish Ball, The Phantom, The Strategy, or The Milk and Honey Route."

madmen,3dqxvf,Sometimes_PeoplePoop,26,Sat Jul 18 19:19:28 2015 UTC,"Sally.  When Sally fell running in the office and Megan comforted her while Faye just watched awkwardly, that solidified Don's decision between Megan and Faye."
madmen,3dqxvf,leamanc,11,Sat Jul 18 19:43:58 2015 UTC,"I agree that this is undoubtedly the reason. I still feel like from a relationship perspective though, Faye and Don had the most potential for success."
madmen,3dqxvf,jimcutlers_buttspeed,15,Sat Jul 18 21:06:32 2015 UTC,"While Megan's rapport with the kids (and Faye's utter lack of skills with children) certainly played a big part in Don choosing her over Faye, I don't think Don and Faye really had potential for long-term success. (And I say this as a huge fan of Faye Miller. She has everything: brains, beauty, independence, street smarts, business savvy, etc. And she is SOOOO FREAKING HOT.)  The reason I say this is because Don knew -- at least in the back of his mind -- that Faye wouldn't put up with his BS. In their last face-to-face conversation, Faye tells Don he needs to come to terms with his past and ""live like the rest of us."" Megan, on the other hand, has severe hero-worship for Don at this point. I think Don thought he would have the upper-hand in the relationship, and Megan would continue to fawn over him, while Faye would make him get his shit together."

But in the grand scheme of things, this was during crazy Betty time so I'm sure his main concern in a partner is to have someone who can nurture his children."
madmen,3dqxvf,applesandcherry,3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:41 2015 UTC,I think it was because Don and Faye were more or less equals. She was very intelligent and successful and powerful and I don't think Don liked that. Jump to Megan who fawns over Don and is simply a secretary. He is back in the power again.
madmen,3dqxvf,montyjw6,5,Mon Jul 20 07:07:20 2015 UTC,"Thought it was pretty obvious. It boiled down to how good Megan was with the kids, and Faye wasn't so hot about the idea of children."

madmen,3dqxvf,CBJ17,2,Sun Jul 19 09:18:34 2015 UTC,"Faye started losing her strength and confidence, she started falling apart when she couldn't handle his kids. I dont even feel like she gave it a good shot, she simply gave up and resigned herself to the fact she was no good at being a mother and started playing the martyr. For me, this is when she started losing appeal. If you love someone, you learn to make it work, in whatever capacity you can. I also think she felt threatened by the fact she would have to compete for his affections with his kids and he would always make time for them and they would always be in the picture needing him in some way. Faye didn't want to share him or to have that distraction from his attention."
madmen,3dqxvf,jennybohmanfry,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:23:32 2015 UTC,"I've never been a Faye fan. It was readily apparent she wasn't compatible with Don and reminded me of too many women I have met who get too attached too quickly after what like 3-4 dates? Her attachment also came because she broke her own ethics to leak Don information, and I felt for her, but in the end that is on her."
madmen,3dqxvf,leamanc,13,Mon Jul 20 18:19:11 2015 UTC,I never liked Suzanne. Maybe I was experiencing mistress fatigue by this point but I audibly groaned when I saw Don watching her longingly as she was dancing around the Maypole. The only mistress I disliked more was Sylvia.
madmen,3dqxvf,KayPizzle,6,Sat Jul 18 21:53:31 2015 UTC,"She is also my least favorite of the mistresses. (Well, maybe Bobbie Barrett ranks lower, but that's because she was so unpleasant and fake.)  I didn't like her and Don together because I had to stop and ask WTF Don is doing pursuing her? They have nothing in common, the relationship could clearly go nowhere, and her proto-flower child attitude is not something I could see Don tolerating for very long.  This relationship was purely about Don conquering a young, pretty woman. Most of his other affairs found him with women who had strong personalities that made for interesting interactions. With Suzanne, the deepest conversation she ever had with Don revolved around whether the color blue was really blue."

madmen,3dqp9a,twinkiesmom1,56,Sat Jul 18 15:07:27 2015 UTC,"Sylvia was an archetype that Don was chasing, for psychological reasons that have to do with his mother and sex.   Dons mom was a prostitute, and the woman who raised him (and hated him) became one as well and brought him to live in a brothel.   When he fell ill, he was cared for only by Aimee, a girl working in the brothel. She feeds him, treats his fever, and, after applying a makeup beauty mark (like Sylvia has), takes his virginity.   All this is revealed in ""The Crash"", when Don is on amphetamines and supposed to be working on Chevy. Instead, after being let down by Sylvia, he searches for some old work he did: a mother feeding her son some soup, with a beauty mark. The tag line was: ""Because you know what he needs"".   After discovering this, he proclaims to Peggy that he hasn't figured out Chevy, he had figured out ""everything"". He then leaves, all these memories, psychological complexes, and drugs mixed together, to go convince Sylvia to be with him.  He thinks that Sylvia knows what he needs, because he himself needs a mother."

madmen,3dqp9a,sullysbarandgrill,8,Sat Jul 18 16:20:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this...these are the kinds of things I missed binge watching the series on Netflix.  I'm wondering if Sylvia reminded him of Aimee rather than his mother?  Because honestly, Megan was much more nurturing than Sylvia."
madmen,3dqp9a,crediblehulk83,3,Sat Jul 18 16:29:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah this show has such awesome development.   What I'm getting at is that Sylvia reminds him of Aimee and his mother at the same time. And remember that Don's mom was never nurturing at all, because she was dead. The only real attention he got was from another whore who also introduced him to sex. She might as well have been his mother: young, a prostitute, that's all he really knew about either of the.This girl became kind of a twisted placeholder for his maternal figure.   And I think Megan was nurturing with Don's kids, but I think he was looking for it for himself."
madmen,3dqp9a,CplSlyboots,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:46:29 2015 UTC,"I'm going to add on to this and say that Sylvia is probably the culmination of all Don's affairs because he has that little lightbulb moment in his head during The Crash that makes him realize he combines his mother figures and sexual objects into one person.  Don's virginity was not just 'taken' by Aimee; she raped him.  The one woman who showed him kindness also used him sexually after that kindness was done; then she flaunted it before she left and asked to be paid for 'taking his cherry'.  It wasn't an act of love, but one of power, since Aimee is used by men every single day.  The only ""man' she can conquer is an innocent and unloved kid.  This forever changed the way Don looked at women, and he has tried throughout his life to separate his Marilyns and Jackies, but he can't with Sylvia.  She's both of them.  Before The Crash, Don does that power-play sex with Sylvia, which is a role reversal of what happened to him as a boy, since he's the one in power now.  He could control Sylvia by doing this and get off on that power... but not Megan at any point.   Megan never wanted to be known as ""the wife"" or ""the mother"" of Don Draper or his children.  She was ahead of her time and had ambitions outside of those roles, and who could blame her?  Don wanted to fit her into the only two roles he was familiar with that women could play, but he can't control Megan that way.  Just as he can't control Peggy either.  For Don, it all comes down to control of his life and the people around him, since he never had any as a child."

madmen,3dqp9a,Really_Rizzoli,27,Sat Jul 18 19:26:49 2015 UTC,"Don infamously 'only likes the beginning of things.' I suspect, though, that if Megan had stayed on at the office that she would've been integrated into his life such that he wouldn't have wanted to cheat (not for a long time, anyway) and couldn't have gotten away with it if he tried.  I think the Sylvia thing was mostly a matter of her being Don's type (brunette with brown eyes, reasonably well-educated, strong enough to push back on him a bit). I also think Don was always really, really good at compartmentalizing his actions/feelings such that he didn't really think of the impact on her husband-- when he could avoid it.   Finally, I suspect somebody could make a good argument for the possibility that Don's choice to ""shit where he eats"" (cheat with a neighbor in his own building) was a subconscious attempt to get caught."
madmen,3dqp9a,Ammanda13,10,Sat Jul 18 15:25:29 2015 UTC,His skills in compartmentalising definitely diminished when Sally caught him in the act with Sylvia. It seems that he was on a perpetual downfall after that moment.
madmen,3dqp9a,mightymo77,7,Sat Jul 18 16:26:44 2015 UTC,"I also think it was hard for Don to accept that Megan just didn't want to work in advertising, because he thought she was good at it. I think he thought she though she was above it in some way and he resented he for it. I think he tried to be supportive of the acting thing, but Megan was no longer there 24/7 to give him what he wanted or needed. So, he found someone who would."
madmen,3dqp9a,fueledbyburd,3,Sat Jul 18 17:00:59 2015 UTC,"Just like Megan has a love of acting, Don has a love of advertising. When he is working in advertising, he has some form of happiness. This is why he kept doing it when the partners voted him out. I think because Megan was so good at advertising, Don expected her to love it and find happiness in it they way he does. When she begins to resent the advertising job, Don sees this as a rejection of him. He tried to put on a happy face when Megan told him she wanted to go back to acting, but from that moment on their relationship begins to crumble and he resents her.

madmen,3dqp9a,the_wolverine88,4,Sat Jul 18 17:10:48 2015 UTC,I'm glad I'm not alone...Megan was my favorite Don partner....although I believe Anna was his true soulmate.
madmen,3dqp9a,streetxmanifesto,7,Sat Jul 18 17:28:22 2015 UTC,"I'm very happy that Don and Anna didn't ever have a sexual relationship - I don't think Don really knows how value a person after they've had sex. The reason he holds certain women in his life (Anna, Peggy, Joan, etc) to such high regard is they've never been sexual objects for him; they're people first and (sexy) women second."

madmen,3dqp9a,RangerNS,3,Sun Jul 19 03:37:38 2015 UTC,Don can't be happy in a relationship. Megan could have been everything he wanted or anybody in the world and he still would eventually want someone different.

I couldn't cite to an exact moment in an episode, but I feel like at some point he showed contempt for the husband and it seemed like he is only putting on an act for the husband so he wouldn't get suspicious."

madmen,3dnruo,boynamedphillip,38,Fri Jul 17 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"Bob is just another example of ""fake it til you make it."" He is pretty much Don Draper 2.0 as far as Pete is concerned. Duck finds out that Bob's credentials don't check out at all. His job before being hired at SC&P was being a servant to an executive of another firm, not working there. Bob uses his charm to just be... around... til it actually lands him some good work at the company. Very Don Draper-y.   Pete is experienced with his coworkers and their false identities so he uses it to keep Bob is his pocket at the time rather than make a mess of things.  Is he a conman? Not in the purest sense I don't think. But his ambitions drive him like many other characters on the show, no matter what lies or half-truths he has to tell to reach his goal."

madmen,3dnruo,Robot-E3,22,Fri Jul 17 20:10:43 2015 UTC,I think the executive calls Bob because he guessed that he was also closeted and he was essentially an underling he could keep quiet. He dangled the carrot of getting work with Buick to further silence him... but I don't think Bob has a history of sleeping with executives.  The thing with Pete likely happens because that character is just so uptight Bob would get a vibe from him. Honestly I could see a world where Pete Campbell is gay.

madmen,3dp4qm,marie_samuels,3,Sat Jul 18 11:55:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because Rachel ended it.  Don likes to have control.  I think that's why breaking up with Sylvia hit him so hard, too."
madmen,3dp4qm,HoldOnMagnolia,2,Sat Jul 18 13:03:06 2015 UTC,Great point. Maybe that also illuminates why Don took the divorce from Betty so hard initially- because she moved on without him to Henry and away from his cheating.
madmen,3dp4qm,HoldOnMagnolia,2,Sat Jul 18 21:41:13 2015 UTC,"There was something about Rachel's sophistication and her past saying that she has never loved a man before that makes her so much more intriguing to the story line.

To me, it's because she was the only one of his affairs who saw straight through him in the first real conversation they had.  Right in the first episode, she understands him and says to him, ""I know what it feels like to be out of place. To be disconnected. To see the world laid out in front of you the way other people live it. And there is something about you that tells me you know it too.""  Don has always wanted an honest human connection to someone who knew who he truly was and didn't care.  He got that with Anna, Peggy, and Rachel.  Other people he has told have either wanted him to change (Faye, Megan) or rejected him (Betty)."

I was/am a Sally marching along to my own beat, left home at 17 because I was raised by a Betty type mother who did not understand my choices were different than hers, and I could not be her. It always was a messy relationship between her and I. My mother now has dementia and I never did get to hear that phrase about marching to my own beat, or having an adventurous life, or any acknowledgement of me as person.   I was so glad that Sally got to read those words from her mother, and so sad that I have never heard them from mine.  The letter totally reminds me of something my mother would do. 3/4 of the letter about what to do, her needs and by the way, oh, yeah ...have a good life, you weren't such a bad kid.

It already has a record that will likely never be equaled, in that it won those four Best Drama Series awards in a row, in its first four seasons. But that fifth win would be even better. Honestly, it really should have won its fifth for Season 5, as there was no way Homeland's season that year was better than Mad Men's. I think Weiner may have worn out his welcome a little bit at that time, after the negotiations with AMC, and mostly getting his way. Hollywood can be a very jealous and petty place.  But back to this year, I honestly think it has a good shot at getting that fifth Best Drama Emmy. A lot of shows get the farewell, sympathy votes in their final season (and that's not saying Season 7 wasn't great). I think Jon Hamm may finally get his Emmy too. Remember how rewarded Breaking Bad was for its final season."

I have tried again and again to find a high-quality printed SC&P mug like yours, but I haven't been successful. I ordered from Gold Label Goods (the official Mad Men/AMC merchant) and they sent me one with lousy low-resolution pixelated printing (from a distance it looks great, but up close you can hardly even read the ""Copyright 2013 Lionsgate"" etc). I called them to ask for a refund, but they offered to send me another one free of charge. This one, however, looks exactly identical to the first one.

The latter's printing is top-notch – so much so that you can actually feel its raised lettering with your fingers. Notice the low-resolution printing on the SC&P mug. You might think that it's a bad photo or that the mug isn't in focus, but that's how it actually looks up close. Like I said, it's not noticeable from 3-4 feet away when it's on a table, but when you hold it up close, you'll notice.

madmen,3dfrpz,MattBloom,8,Wed Jul 15 22:42:14 2015 UTC,"Obviously there's a lot going on in context as to why Don behaves like he does. But from a thematic standpoint I think he's angry with technology. Kubrick's monolith represents human advancement, which was a big theme throughout season 7.0. Creative has literally been ousted by the new technology that is going to bring SC&P into the future -- something creative had previously been responsible for. I think Don had a moment (after several other negative events) of realizing ""wait you're asking me to advertise for the thing that just (dis/re)placed me?"" The computer didn't even need a campaign to replace Don.   I also think season 7.0 played on the fascination/terror people in the 60s felt towards the rapid progress the computer represents. Even today, movies come out all the time about computers taking over the world. I think Don had a drunken moment of clarity. Maybe he is calling technology the devil.

Shit got real and for the rest of the series, he was a much more active partner. Also, he had a lot of great lines and the actor was perfect.  And I swear, I'm the only person who liked Henry. He seemed like a decent, respectable guy. I mean he's a politician, and a square, and he's kind of creepy in season 3 when he first comes onto Betty... but all around, I liked him. He was kind to Betty and her kids, but he also knew how to dismantle her bullshit, and his Mother's too. ""You know how I make those tickets go away, Ma? I pay'em."""
madmen,3dg8eo,dreamshoes,7,Thu Jul 16 03:08:28 2015 UTC,"Strangely enough, I started to like Henry when he started treating Don like shit, as people in his situation would. Like how he crushed Don's belongings in the garage, or left the boxes on the side of the road while he mowed his lawn. Even after Betty's cancer scare, after he speaks to Don on the phone and Betty asks him whom he was talking to, he says 'Nothing.' He became much more human and relatable.  But then he made his own milkshake. (What was that about? There was plenty of shake there, Henry.)"

madmen,3deqbz,hEyHeYwhatup,5,Wed Jul 15 18:17:44 2015 UTC,"Typewriter font, two spaces after a period - It's like I'm reading a sample from a style guide from the 1960s!  I think that Mad Men's initial premise was a really interesting one; one that other period shows caught up to and emulated pretty quickly. It was going to tell us of the 1960s before it became 'the sixties'. That the sexual revolution had begun way back in the late 50s for upper-middle class professionals. It was going to tell us about the counterculture from the viewpoint of the adults, the establishment, rather than a group of misfits and rebels, maybe for the first time in decades, perhaps since the actual thing.  (Boardwalk Empire used the same idea with the 1920s, it was mostly about the pre-roaring times, rather than high 1920s. Same with Halt and Catch Fire now, another AMC show, which began in 1983, nothing like the 1980s we know.)  Mad Men began a veritable early-1960s craze at the time of its first four seasons, which makes us forget that in pop culture, somehow, the Camelot years were seen as a prelude to the actual thing. I think this series was one of the first to see a story there. Other networks tried to reverse engineer Mad Men and came up with Pan-Am and The Playboy Club (The former gave us Margot Robbie, who would have been really good in Mad Men.) Even X-Men: First Class wouldn't have happened if it weren't for this show. They even cast January Jones. I think even the Man from U.N.C.L.E. reboot somehow takes inspiration from Mad Men.  Also, I think that with Mad Men, we are finally offered a specimen that stands between Hitchcock and Planet of the Apes. Or the man in the gray flannel suit and the man in a batik shirt, wearing tinted shades. 1960s were a time when two widely varying different cultures co-existed, and it's made the world a different place since, but we've never really seen those two cultures happening just at the same time in period drama before Mad Men."
madmen,3deqbz,pierreor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:47:22 2015 UTC,Thats very interesting... Mad Men may have created the go-to 60s  style for current and future TV shows and movies.
madmen,3deqbz,thatniggalexluger,2,Thu Jul 16 02:15:39 2015 UTC,"As the 60's get further and further away and people that actually lived in the 60's start to die, we may see that people rely on/use television shows like Mad Men as an example of what the 60's were like."
madmen,3dgepu,pinkbowvintage,10,Thu Jul 16 01:49:00 2015 UTC,I used to kind of ship Don and Peggy but then I realized that Peggy deserves better than an old alcoholic emotionally abusive serial cheater with a shit-ton of baggage. They are much much better as friends. Stan is much more sensible choice(and is a far better fit) for her.  Ida Blankenship and Bert Cooper are the best couple in the series of course.
madmen,3dgepu,PKMNTrainerGigi,7,Thu Jul 16 03:25:21 2015 UTC,Bert's obituary for Ida is one of the most poignant lines in the series.
madmen,3dgepu,dreamshoes,2,Thu Jul 16 03:42:12 2015 UTC,I could never see the Don/Peggy ship. I feel like she's more of his daughter or at least his equal. Don sees her as a competent working partner (for the most part) and I think respects her way too much to chase after her. And I feel like Peggy respects herself enough not to go after it either.
madmen,3dgepu,Laureltess,9,Thu Jul 16 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"I wanted Ginsberg to date that cutiepie teacher, though sadly it feels like a moot point now.  Roger and Marie. As you say, they're both hilarious. Their arguments are particularly great. ""You are speaking slowly, so I will understand. Forget - my - name."" click  Some of the early Don and Betty stuff was pretty sweet. I really loved their post-divorce dynamic once Betty came around. I also liked Don and Megan a lot, especially in Season 4. I never quite agreed with the notion that Dr. Faye was such a better pairing for Don, as if Megan didn't have a lot of great qualities outside of being ""sexy secretary number whatever."" She was smart, fun, and creative -- an actress even, and we know Don loves movies. I think the real tragedy of Don's decision is that Dr. Faye might have helped him more with her medical skills, because the whole damn show spends seven seasons circling the fact that Don. needs. therapy.  Back on topic, I really liked a lot of Betty and Henry's interactions, though it's hard to say exactly why. I think I always appreciated Matt Weiner writing a second-husband character, who is a pretty extreme foil to Don, but giving the relationship its own unique tone, and ultimately depicting it as one of the show's healthiest.   I loved that Sally kissed the nerd kid after parroting the jock brother's cynical opinions about the moon landing. It was a ""phew!"" moment of relief, watching Sally navigate a minor test of character and come out more like-able than ever.  As far as things I didn't like... Mark obviously sucked with Peggy. A lot of people hated Abe but his last scene is so bizarre and hilarious that I can't help but love him. I didn't quite love Peggy and Stan's breakthrough scene in the finale, but I think they're a great pair overall. Would've liked it to happen earlier in the final season so we could've seen them together more."
madmen,3dgepu,dreamshoes,5,Thu Jul 16 03:34:21 2015 UTC,"I totally agree about Peggy and Stan, that should've happened a lot earlier on in the series. Having it happen right at the end felt rom-commy.  And yeah, I think once Don plugged back into his relationship with Betty, they had some great moments. I LOVED their Italy escapade, and really felt for Betty when she realized how miserable she was to be back home. Bets should've just been a supermodel who never had kids. The life suited her.  I think Henry, while he wasn't my favorite character, became a kind of sweet, caretaking figure for Betty that was nice to see. She was often so childlike.   I so agree about Megan. She was talented, creative, witty, and all-around a catch."
madmen,3dgepu,pineyfusion,5,Thu Jul 16 05:46:00 2015 UTC,"I'm all about Peggy/Stan personally. I thought the evolution of their relationship was really fascinating to see.   I also liked Trudy and Pete because they always made a great team. Like she was more than willing to help play the game with Pete. And I liked that. He's a little shit though, but he's a little less shitty with Trudy.   I liked Roger and Joan but I'm also kind of glad that they didn't end up together. Roger's journey was all about trying to fight back against the sands of time which included chasing after much younger women. So I found it kind of fitting that in his acceptance of his maturity, he ended up with a woman that was more his age. That being said, I did like the banter between Roger and Joan.  I used to like Ted/Peggy but I completely get why it didn't work out and I'm kind of glad it didn't. I think Ted put her on a pedestal too much and I think Ted focused on Peggy a lot more once Frank Gleason got sick.   I really never liked Pete/Peggy and Don/Peggy felt kind of wrong to me.   Though clearly, the greatest pairing of all is obviously Meredith/Don. She is his strength."

madmen,3dgepu,CplSlyboots,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:48:12 2015 UTC,"On the subject of Peggy... I never really felt like any of the men Peggy was with ever truly understood her.  Mark pressured what he thought was a virgin into having sex with him, Duck was a lonely alcoholic who used Peggy to get to Don, Abe respected her to an extent but not her profession.  Stan is really the only man who took the time to grow and understand Peggy and ALL of her 'sins' and personas.  Pete just had bad timing... but I don't think he would've made her happy in the long-run.  No one's mentioned it, but I loved Joan with Lane the most.  Felt like he held a lot of admiration and respect for her that Roger just didn't cover.  Their dynamic as confidants was touching."
madmen,3dgepu,GuyFromOjai,-5,Mon Jul 20 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"Let's not call it ""shipping,"" please. Let's not be one of those batshit insane Tumblr fandoms which by default pairs every single male character with a male character and every single female character with a female character for the sake of it and then only writes/draws graphic pornographic fanfiction based off those hypothetical relationships. Not that I have anything against homosexuality (duh), but I feel like most people in those types of fandoms (not normal fanbases, like, say, that of Back to the Future) always try their hardest to deviate the characters and storylines away from what the writers originally intended them to be, and then become super protective of said characters and pairings as if they were their own children.  I have no problem with people having their own ideas for which characters they want to be together. But the whole concept of shipping/fandoms/OTPs/fanfics irks me. That whole fandom culture has only become popular in recent years, and even though it has flourished on a massive scale at events such as Comic-Con, I have always been proud that Mad Men is one of those shows that hasn't been cheapened like so many others. It's a show whose fanbase speculates about each episode thoughtfully and diligently, focusing on a variety of topics from pop culture references to usage of music to character development to changing environments to motifs and so forth. It's not a gaggle of 14-year-old fangirls desperately trying to sexualize every last character and moment on the show."

I think that fits pretty well.   First, the whole ""well, *I* would done it THIS way spiel. Are you a real writer/director/show runner? No? Then you're affecting greater importance than you actually possess. Don't get me wrong- you're certainly entitled to express your opinions in any forum you want to. But you're acting as if anyone's going to consider your voice as an armchair critic to be an important one. And that whole ""the pity I feel"" for the bourgeois Pepsi drinkers and those who watch tv shows that are clearly beneath the author? Who the fuck is this affected douchebag?  Then there's the writing. The author is obviously very impressed with himself but is not as talented as he's convinced himself that he is. The sentences run on. And the borderline stream of consciousness narrative is more like a stream of diarrhea running down his own leg.  I don't know about anybody else, but that's why I think he's pretentious.

madmen,3d8uuj,TheFarnell,3,Tue Jul 14 15:49:01 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we don't know much about the type of relationship Trudy's parents have.  In an era when divorce was socially unacceptable, a good number of couples whose chemistry had worn out came to mutually consenting ""agreements"" where, so long as they were discreet about it, spouses were ok with each other having relations elsewhere.  This could be the case for them.  Since Pete and Trudy had not been together long (and he had a different opinion of Trudy), and going by Pete's body language, he could have assumed she and Pete had no similar arrangement.  Trudy alludes to this type of mentality herself when she confronts Pete about his affair with the insurance salesman's wife.  IIRC, she says something to the effect that she'd understood Pete getting an apartment in the city was a tacit approval of his having affairs... so long as they stayed in the city."
madmen,3d8uuj,pierreor,3,Tue Jul 14 20:54:33 2015 UTC,"Whenever Pete sits on valuable information, somehow, things always take a turn for the worse. With Adam's box, for example, he didn't manage to use it as leverage because he and Don both knew, deep down, that he couldn't sell it. Don had everything to lose, but he went all-in on Pete's game.  Same with Tom Vogel. Sure, Pete ended up telling Trudy that her father was with the biggest, blackest prostitute, but a. Trudy didn't want to hear it (it's her father, for crying out loud) and b. Pete cheated on her only a couple of episodes ago. So in a way, it was a stalemate between them but Tom had the upper hand because of Pete's character."

Also Betty is a bitch to Bobby because she's the kind of woman who thinks that if things don't naturally fall into her expectations just-so then they're a disaster and anyone involved has ruined everything. Of course that's an insane attitude to have with kids, and it perpetuates the idea she has that her kids don't love her."

madmen,3d99oa,Reggie_Popadopoulous,6,Tue Jul 14 17:48:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that relationship is actually more interesting and deeper than all that. Betty's mother came from the first generation of women that started to get out and do things independently in the workplace. You can read about it in Betty Friedan's book, if you're interested, but right around the time of women's suffrage there was a whole movement for independent activity in the workplace in women that shut down hard right after the war. The backlash against that kind of thing was terrible and lasted well into the mid sixties and Betty's mother was part of the generation of women that were severely disappointed by their sudden loss of being able to act independently. Her father briefly alludes to it when he tells Sally about how her grandmother Ruth worked for an engineer and helped draft designs. You can even tell by how he encourages Sally to go out in the world and do whatever she wants that it wasn't even his doing necessarily that Betty wasn't encouraged to get out in the marketplace.  That generation basically taught their daughters that they can get an education, but they shouldn't expect to be able to do anything in the world outside of the home. Betty comes from that: from being told that she needs to have everything just right but that she cannot do anything herself and that personal ambition is foolish, that just the right things must be done for her not by her. This is the whole source of most of her problems."
madmen,3d99oa,iwpoe,3,Tue Jul 14 19:16:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you read the chapter ""The Problem that has No Name"" in The Feminine Mystique, you'll really understand Betty's general behavior."
madmen,3d99oa,applesandcherry,6,Wed Jul 15 22:44:07 2015 UTC,"Different time and attitudes related to children and child rearing. I could be a contemporary of Bobby's if he was a real person ;). Bobby seems like a nervous, stressed out child. He has dealt with a great deal of upset in his young life; unhappy cold mother (I got that version too; there were many of those types the 1950s), absent father, fighting of his parents, new brother, divorce, new step dad, sister away at school; so many changes in a few years for a little guy.  In those days no one talked to children about things the way people do now. I was told very often the line ""children should be seen and not heard"". Children were often ignored and their emotions not considered in big decisions. If the child acted out like Sally did, maybe a visit to a doctor would be considered.   Bobby is not like Sally though, so he is silently absorbing the pain and trauma he has experienced. Be quiet do not cry too loudly, ""we cannot hear the tv"" has been said to more than one child of that era who could not cope with their sadness and what was happening in the family, or go to your room and cry. The reasons for the crying were often irrelevant. Suck it up, deal with it and do not express it or you are considered ""bad"" or a ""problem"".  Bobby is a very stressed out boy. Remember the stomach aches too? Picking at the wallpaper is just outlet for some of the stress and anxiety in his life IMO.  Not every behavior is a precursor of mental health issues or a developmental problem. Many times behaviors are coping mechanisms and that is how I see Bobby's behavior, a nice little boy with a lot on his shoulders and a mother who, do to her own unhappiness and issues cannot communicate with her child and nurture him in any meaningful way.  I had the Betty version of a mother too and it is hard on the head. There were so many unfulfilled and unhappy women having children because the times dictated it. Motherhood was expected of a woman and sadly many of them were not very prepared for children and a stifling life of diapers, dinner and dreariness. The bitch factor was strong because so many mothers were just so unhappy with their lives and marriages, and very few options if they did leave."
madmen,3d99oa,acadien-driftwood,6,Tue Jul 14 18:40:02 2015 UTC,Betty's a bit of a bitch. Bobby's just a kid whose parents rarely communicate with him like he's a person.

Betty constantly shits on him from the get go, signs of OCD also appear when he rips the wallpaper.   Eh, maybe OCD. I don't see where he showed any signs of ADHD or Autism.   But also why is Betty such a bitch to Bobby?   Betty is too self absorbed to consider anyone else's feelings or needs, hence her being a terrible mother who (probably correctly) assumes her children hate her."
madmen,3d99oa,BrandtCantWatch_,2,Tue Jul 14 16:36:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think Betty is self absorbed, per se. She doesn't exactly like the expectation that she sets for her children. They're just the kind of expectations she thinks the world has. Consider her fight with Sally about her nose and what that was really about. It wasn't Betty's narcissism but rather her intense fear that Sally would somehow have to lead a deficient and inadequate life. Betty understands loving her daughter as making Sally apply to herself the most difficult and strenuous standards that she herself had to bear. That's essentially what Betty tells her she's come to realize in her final wishes letter in the finale."

And in fact, Weiner commented on this after the S5 finale: From an aesthetic standpoint, it was decided in the writers' room that unless Lane died, they wouldn't get Jaguar. Although this seems random and unjustified, think about how Lane practically begged for bonuses for the partners before he forged that cheque, and how it was refused and then juxtaposed with Jaguar.  After winning Jaguar, the agency was transformed. They gained a confidence that allowed them to win a titan like Dow. They had money they didn't know what to do with, at least for a while, and finally leased that second floor. (Lane's insurance money also helped.) For all his thriftiness and horse sense, Lane actually held back the agency in a lot of ways and the hunger came out after his departure. That's what Don's pitch to Dow was all about.  I think Peggy would have left for CGC regardless, but I don't think the merger with CGC would have happened if Lane was alive. Chevy was the one account that the agency couldn't swallow; it depleted the resources, drained morale, changed priorities and practically bloated the agency.  I think 'For Immediate Release' represent as fateful a moment as 'Commissions & Fees' in the agency's life. If only Roger was at that dinner with Herb, Don would have been appeased and Jaguar would have stayed for a while longer; the wheels of the public offering would have been set in motion and the agency would have grown organically. Then again, who knows what else would have happened by 1970."

madmen,3d10i7,Goku_Goes_Crazy,45,Sun Jul 12 16:58:20 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to say that Harry Crane did in fact have a transition. He was more of a family guy, stuck in the old ways early on (bow ties and stuffy office furniture), and he transitioned into ""Mr. cool guy cheating on his wife California hot shot"" within a matter of a few seasons. He was somewhat of a nice guy in the beginning and turning into a total douche by the end.   That's just my 2 cents though."
madmen,3d10i7,JohnCenaLunchbox,15,Sun Jul 12 20:53:28 2015 UTC,"Great analysis, but I don't think everyone thought of Harry Crane as ""Mr. cool guy"", he definitely thought that way about himself, but no one thought of him that way."
madmen,3d10i7,jimmyscrackncorn,16,Mon Jul 13 01:51:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. But I think the more light shined onto Harry, the more you got to see who he really was. But, in the beginning, he was as goodie two shoes as you could get for the characters at that time.   Like Ken, but without a soul."
madmen,3d10i7,JohnCenaLunchbox,6,Mon Jul 13 02:11:02 2015 UTC,"Since you mentioned Ken, how would you characterize his transition? A friend and I have debated how he ended up.   I think he went from season 1 Frat Boy to family man who had more in his life than work to someone almost too occupied & stressed about work in the end. But I think he maintained his overall good nature and positivity...my friend thinks he became dark and angry after his time in Detroit."
madmen,3d10i7,psychobeast,9,Mon Jul 13 10:24:48 2015 UTC,"My personal thoughts about Ken, after rewatching the series: in the beginning, we only really got a superficial outlook on Ken. A lot of what we saw of his character was through the perspective of others, like Pete and Harry, who didn't really like him because he was moving up the ranks faster.  But he was overall a nice guy, a little misogynistic, but nothing crazy compared to anyone else in the office in 1960.  It wasn't until later seasons where he was portrayed as a truly likeable character for the audience, when it was more obvious that work was just work and in the end he was willing to always put his family first (unlike any other character).    I just find it interesting that he is sort of portrayed as a slimy character in the beginning, but it's purely a result of how other characters react to him, not a result of character development.  I think he was the nice family guy all along, we just didn't get a chance to know it yet."
madmen,3d10i7,yoga_jones,4,Mon Jul 13 13:11:50 2015 UTC,I think you pretty much nailed it there.
madmen,3d10i7,JohnCenaLunchbox,3,Mon Jul 13 15:56:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Do you think his scenes in the final season where he seems stressed and work-focused mean anything more than what we see? My friend's interpretation is that work became his key focus, that he was more bitter. But I don't think so. I think the Ken we saw with his wife is the real Ken, and while he might have matured a bit toward the end, I don't think he lost his core nature or overall positivity when he lost his eye."
madmen,3d10i7,psychobeast,4,Mon Jul 13 16:05:05 2015 UTC,"I agree more with you, I think in the end he was still true to his core.  He was obviously bitter, but he used that bitterness to finally just screw over SC&P.  Even though he turned down his wife's suggestion that he finally just focus on his passion, I think he still chose a path where he could be the working family man.  Just a spiteful one."
madmen,3d10i7,yoga_jones,2,Mon Jul 13 16:32:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess he was bitter. But you're right that it was directed at certain people and not an overall bitterness in his personality.   I always enjoyed his scenes with his wife. Sure, Alex Mack rocks, but they were one of the few couples who seemed like a great team and who never fell out of love."
madmen,3d10i7,psychobeast,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:36:50 2015 UTC,I think after he comes back to SCDP in S4 he's a lot more likeable.
madmen,3d10i7,cougasaurus,3,Tue Jul 14 16:10:50 2015 UTC,"I never saw Ken as a frat boy or womanizer. He always stuck out to me as someone that didn't really fit in with the rest of the agency.   He was good at his job, but he always had an upbeat and positive outlook. He was the counterpoint to Pete, literally when they made them co-heads of accounts.   His writing accentuated how different he was.  He had this whole other outlet which he excelled at.  A skill that others were envious of.   I think Detroit and Ken was there to again demonstrate how different he was from the typical runnin' & gunnin' accounts manager.  He was more cultured, diplomatic and egalitarian."
madmen,3d10i7,FakkoPrime,3,Mon Jul 13 17:47:01 2015 UTC,I see him as more of a victim of the agency and how everyone else made the philandering douchebaggery look so cool and effortless. He was just trying to fit in all while sort of singlehandedly creating the future of the agency with a TV department.
madmen,3d10i7,ActualButt,2,Mon Jul 13 16:16:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced that Harry's reveal of having a huge ego, no tact and loose morals was him imitating others.   At first it was due to no one recognizing how important TV was becoming in society and, thus, advertising.  He kept trying (with little result) to get more resources to improve their reach in that market.  He handled it poorly, though, with his tantrums.   Once he did get the resources his behavior did not improve, it became worse.  He saw it as justification of his inflated sense of self-worth."
madmen,3d10i7,FakkoPrime,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:57:59 2015 UTC,I don't think it was like he was intentionally imitating Don and Roger or anything. I do think that it was a subconscious change though for that reason though. It's a combination of ego and maybe a little bit of delusion.
madmen,3d10i7,ActualButt,2,Mon Jul 13 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point, I've edited my post. You're right about Harry."
madmen,3d10i7,cannedpeaches,23,Mon Jul 13 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"This is the thing I yearn to hear all of my friends say.   It's weird - every time I broach the subject of Mad Men to somebody, even avid TV viewers, it's always ""I never really got into it."" People who're perfectly happy to take me up on suggestions of other series - The Americans, Hannibal, Vikings, Bob's Burgers, the list goes on - will act like I'm trying to yank out a molar if I pester them about Mad Men. But weirdly, if you hold somebody captive, if you go ""You're watching this with me"", and you really do set down and go through three, four episodes and give them that sense of momentum... they're hooked. I've had people go from grudgingly watching an episode a week (streaming) to finishing entire seasons in the same amount of time.   I can't really say what it is that people resist so much about it. I never had the ""Ugh, really?"" phase with Mad Men.   I'm just ruminating here. Why was it your ""white whale"", OP? Did it feel boring when you first started? Or was it something else?"
madmen,3d10i7,Stephennnnnn,10,Sun Jul 12 17:59:54 2015 UTC,"Same experience with trying to get others to watch it. I'm actually the only one I know of anyone in my family or circle of friends who watched it and I never managed to get anyone else to give it more than one or two episodes, but at the same time the same people who moan and groan about Mad Men seem more than willing to try other shows that aren't as good. I don't get it. Maybe it's the fact that it's a period drama...I don't know."
madmen,3d10i7,jpmondx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:29:01 2015 UTC,"Ditto here. I think with some of my friends and family, it was the 50's setting they resisted - ugh, they just didn't want to go there with the weird hairstyles and awful fashions. I know my brother faded on it because to him it was just one failing Don Draper affair after another.   Maybe it's that the characters either hook you or they don't. Lacking that, I think the show wasn't plot driven enough for many of the hold-outs. And certainly Weiner's style of dialogue didn't help a lot of people since, unless you knew the characters well, the point of the scene was lost to them."
madmen,3d10i7,TheOldGods,10,Mon Jul 13 14:40:40 2015 UTC,"It was my white whale because it was a show I constantly heard about, watched it win countless emmys, but I never watched it. It was this show that kept getting away from me, I kept putting it off, and when the final episodes aired and I still had not watched the show, I honestly thought I would never watch it. It was the show that got away. Mad Men, the greatest show that I'll never watch.  And then a couple weeks ago I'm watching Netflix and I just said ""what the hell am I waiting for?"" and I watched it and was hooked after episode 1."
madmen,3d10i7,Hagen711,2,Sun Jul 12 18:08:00 2015 UTC,"It was my white whale because it was a show I constantly heard about, watched it win countless emmys, but I never watched it. It was this show that kept getting away from me, I kept putting it off   Haha. I kinda know what you mean... but you make it sound like watching Madmen is hard work!!"
madmen,3d10i7,cougasaurus,3,Sun Jul 12 18:54:33 2015 UTC,I think OP is subconsciously quoting Jim Hobart when he says it's the white whale.
madmen,3d10i7,bondfool,5,Sun Jul 12 23:10:05 2015 UTC,Haha nope. When that scene came up I chuckled because that's what I've been referring to Mad Men as for a couple years.

madmen,3d10i7,cougasaurus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:13:18 2015 UTC,"Off topic, but is Vikings really as good as the other shows you mentioned? If so, I'll have to check it out."
madmen,3d10i7,BluCynMuk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:13:47 2015 UTC,"Well, nah. I like to think of Vikings as my off-season Game of Thrones. It's got some of the visceral action of that series, and a taste of the politicking, but it's a lot less high-minded and it's got a refreshing sort of alienness to it because they commit to the religious and cultural questions of the Vikings/European confrontation by making the Vikings very foreign to us. On the other hand, there's some writing of mixed quality and some of the arcs don't really get very tense like they do on GoT."
madmen,3d10i7,HoldOnMagnolia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:41:46 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who had never been that interested in watching it, but was always a big movie and TV snob. I finally convinced him to start watching it after the finale had aired and he's hooked. He's already binged through to S7 and is completely hooked."
madmen,3d10i7,bstevens2,8,Tue Jul 14 16:12:59 2015 UTC,"Hear hear- I have to admit I was absolutely shocked when I mentioned Mad men and the finale and what it meant to me to friends and strangers, the absolute lack of feedback I got,most people didn't even know the series. It's this forum that's meant so much to me to see so many like minded people."
madmen,3d10i7,HoldOnMagnolia,8,Sun Jul 12 19:25:12 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling this show is going to keep earning a lot of fans after its close. Netflix combined with word of mouth from fans comparing it to or placing it above The Sopranos/Breaking Bad/Rectify etc... Its a show that can't help but shine through even after other shows become dated and simply a fossil of its time because Mad Men both exemplified and transcended the period premiere drama. I'm glad you finally sat down and finished the series. Hopefully the fact that the conversation isn't as active now doesnt scare you away from this sub or reading up on the mountains of critical analysis out there. Like everyone still posting on this sub, I'm obsessed with the show and lover to mull it over still."
madmen,3d10i7,firo_sephfiro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:20:11 2015 UTC,"In 3-4 sentences why should I watch Rectify.  People always tell me Mad Men was too slow, and I was hooked after the first episode.  But I watched the first three episodes of Rectify and I could go no further.  But yet I see critics continue to rave about the new season.    Please convince me to give it another shot."
madmen,3d10i7,quaglandx3,3,Mon Jul 13 02:22:06 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. besides the fact that it's one of the most beautiful shows on television I think the most persuasive I can be is to tell you that Rectify has without a doubt some of the most surreal, sublime moments I've seen on television. In the first 3 episodes what you saw was largely exposition and introductions to this cast of characters who are all equally fleshed out through the series. But this heavy grounding is needed because Daniel, by dint of being in such an existential nightmare, soon finds himself in uniquely bizarre situations. While Mad Men hid it's intense dramatic build ups in period flair Rectify derives it from slowburning modern day tension between principles and beliefs. On top of all this is the fact that 18 episodes in and the truth of Daniel's crime is still fairly vague so there is a constant mystery even as the curtain periodically gets drawn back.   3 episodes in should give you a feel for the strong acting but if you're not sold I won't say it necessarily gets any more transcendent. I'll just close by saying if you're willing to stick around til episode 5 you'll start to get a sense of what I mean when I say that the show can get truly bizarre.  Full disclaimer though: I'm in love with Abigail Spencer and her character Amantha."
madmen,3d10i7,Landohh,5,Mon Jul 13 03:58:58 2015 UTC,I always refer to Mad Men and the Wire as the great American novel. Cool that someone else sees it to.
madmen,3d10i7,Boolit_Tooth_Tony,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:15:17 2015 UTC,my top two favorite dramas of all time. I watch both regularly over and over.
madmen,3d10i7,e_gadd,6,Mon Jul 13 16:37:36 2015 UTC,"I say ""A thing like that..."" Regularly now as a nod to it being over.  Almost like a salute. Really was a fantastic show and people who don't understand why Just need to realize it's more than just what you physically see happening on the screen. Underlying themes and symbolism being woven into some great acting and writing is what made this series mesmerizing to watch"
madmen,3d10i7,pantiedrawer,2,Mon Jul 13 04:37:28 2015 UTC,Matthew Weiner nailed it as he did with the Sopranos. I'd say those two shows along with Californication are my favorite shows from the last 20 years - though Californication certainly lost its course in the final season.
madmen,3d10i7,WolfofAnarchy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:27:38 2015 UTC,Is Californication really that good? Anyone? It's on freaking Showtime.
madmen,3d10i7,jpmondx,3,Mon Jul 13 03:03:33 2015 UTC,"The first few seasons are entertaining, but it is a comedy and not even in the same universe as MM or Sopranos. The last half of the series is complete shit, however."
