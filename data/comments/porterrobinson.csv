porterrobinson,3e52bx,GeekyCreeper,2,Wed Jul 22 00:42:14 2015 UTC,I'll do a 30 minute one
porterrobinson,3e52bx,itsamox,2,Wed Jul 22 01:32:24 2015 UTC,Alright!
porterrobinson,3e2l0t,GravityGod,5,Tue Jul 21 13:54:07 2015 UTC,Yo that last part with Alexandria sharing her anecdote was really cute!!!
porterrobinson,3e2l0t,PhoDucNam,5,Tue Jul 21 15:09:49 2015 UTC,"Funny anecdote:  I was fumbling in the car, trying to load worlds into the cd player (no aux or bluetooth), ended up dropping it and going ah fuck it I'll put on the radio. What a nice surprise it was when Porter's voice came through the speakers and then I got to listen to divinity after all :)"
porterrobinson,3e2l0t,Dickbuttwhatwhat,2,Tue Jul 21 13:59:15 2015 UTC,"I looove when stuff like that happens!! Thanks for sharing btw Gravity, really awesome interview ;D"
porterrobinson,3e53a4,Timbzt,3,Wed Jul 22 00:49:55 2015 UTC,"If the flyer for the event you're going to says something along the lines of ""Worlds Live"" on it then you can expect Porter to play strictly his own material. His DJ sets are more of a showcasing of songs that he finds interesting. This is pretty much what you can expect from the latter of the two."

porterrobinson,3e53a4,letstakeacatnap,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:10:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's definitely gonna be a DJ set. You'll still have a ton of fun though, his sets are something else!"
porterrobinson,3e53a4,letstakeacatnap,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:12:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I know I would if I'd go but all those amazing videos from his tour are stuck in my head, it would be kind of frustrating for me :/"
porterrobinson,3e104r,GravityGod,4,Tue Jul 21 03:08:45 2015 UTC,"I haven't listened to the original track in like a month or so, but I listen to the Worlds live remake basically everyday hahaha"

porterrobinson,3dzjjc,GeekyCreeper,2,Mon Jul 20 23:37:33 2015 UTC,Porter turned 23 last Wednesday.
porterrobinson,3dzjjc,TheDeadCruiser,2,Tue Jul 21 06:37:02 2015 UTC,as if i'd forget that :D
porterrobinson,3dzjjc,GeekyCreeper,2,Tue Jul 21 07:35:22 2015 UTC,"Journey album project, Worlds remix album coming soon, possible Odesza collab/remix, 2000 subscribers, subreddit redesign contest, etc"

porterrobinson,3dza1e,nickster2230,2,Mon Jul 20 19:10:32 2015 UTC,These aren't your visuals... Invisible Light Network and Ghost Dad made pretty much all of this.
porterrobinson,3dza1e,Canning87,2,Mon Jul 20 19:36:47 2015 UTC,"But if you meant it's your edit that you put together, then yeah this is awesome."
porterrobinson,3dza1e,Canning87,4,Mon Jul 20 19:39:16 2015 UTC,yeah that's what I meant
porterrobinson,3dza1e,Canning87,2,Mon Jul 20 19:43:26 2015 UTC,"Ahh, really cool.  Some really good timing with the cuts!"
porterrobinson,3dza1e,Dickbuttwhatwhat,2,Mon Jul 20 19:54:18 2015 UTC,"Dude, thank you so much for making this for my mix! They seriously look amazing and I can't tell you how grateful I am that you did this for me （＾ω＾）"

porterrobinson,3dyz8x,Dickbuttwhatwhat,2,Tue Jul 21 04:44:28 2015 UTC,thank you!!!! :D
porterrobinson,3dyc7q,CatmereCash,2,Mon Jul 20 15:12:45 2015 UTC,Porter explains the lyrics with his Flicker Commentary on Spotify.
porterrobinson,3dyc7q,TheOneStarfish,3,Mon Jul 20 16:52:33 2015 UTC,the other part is 自分たちの生活のトラックを失う方法です (Jibuntachi no seikatsu no torakku wo ushinau houhou desu). which roughly says “It’s a way to lose track of their lives.”
porterrobinson,3dyc7q,konciipt,2,Mon Jul 20 17:58:11 2015 UTC,tyty googled that phase and got a few interesting facts about the song as well
porterrobinson,3dyc7q,konciipt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:02:07 2015 UTC,btw I love your name
porterrobinson,3dxmly,Sandorawr,5,Mon Jul 20 11:18:53 2015 UTC,"Speaking as somebody whose been to shows with underaged friends who used their siblings IDs, memorize all the details of the ID and don't flinch if they grill you at the door. ;) Also they will know if you don't look at all similar. Bounders are strict fucks at certain venues. I've seen underaged people get IDs taken away for that reason, so proceed with caution, really. That's the best advice I have. I know you want to see Porter, and I really hope you do get to see him and have a magical night!"
porterrobinson,3dxmly,distortedcity,5,Mon Jul 20 15:04:51 2015 UTC,"You already have the tickets, so you would honestly be better off trying to use a fake/sibling's ID. They aren't going to arrest you for trying to get in with a different ID, the most they will do is tell you to go home. Trust me, it would be better knowing you tried to get in but couldn't rather than having to think ""what if I got in with another ID"" for a while."
porterrobinson,3dxmly,itsamox,2,Mon Jul 20 15:39:54 2015 UTC,"If you need a guardian to help you get in just ask someone who's over 18 in the queue if they'll pretend to know you so that you can get in, most people will help you out no problem."
porterrobinson,3dxmly,Psyprus_Sun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:05:11 2015 UTC,"I'm already going with my boyfriend, who is 18, but doesnt it have to be a legal guardian? How do I get around that?"
porterrobinson,3dxmly,Psyprus_Sun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:41 2015 UTC,"Approach someone much older and ask if they'll be your ""cousin/auntie/uncle"", the venue will have no way of knowing if they ARE related and they won't turn someone away if they could genuinely be together. Don't worry too much, you'll be fine."
porterrobinson,3dxmly,Turknjaydee,2,Mon Jul 20 20:08:34 2015 UTC,"You wont get a $2000 fine, I can guarrantee.  Just be confident. Memorise everything on the ID and make sure to make eye contact with the security as he/she is checking. If youre a girl, do your hair completely differently to how it is in the image.  Make sure when youre standing in line/being IDed your ticket is clearly visible.   Dont look nervous. Dont look away from security the entire time youre in the line, just be normal.   If they question you, just continue to insist that its yours. If possible, borrow one of your friends credit cards/uni cards as well. You can pull it out and show them that it has the same name.  I reckon most security would let you in, even if they had suspicion of you being underage. Its not like you're just trying to sneak into a nightclub. You're going to a live show.  Dont dress like a flog. Dress normal, act normal. Security like to deny people who look like trouble makers. Just stand patiently in line and DONT be loud/abnoxious. Or drunk. Do not be drunk.  Its been done many times before and will be done many times in the future. Im 95% sure you'll get in and 100% sure you wont be fined"
porterrobinson,3dxmly,IAmZackTheStiles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:07:20 2015 UTC,Well if you're scared don't do it. Plain and simple. Don't ruin a possible good night with a fine.
porterrobinson,3dxmly,GravityGod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:11:14 2015 UTC,Any reason that you can't/don't want to get a fake id?
porterrobinson,3dxmly,GravityGod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:19:04 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking of using a friends but eh, still kinda nervous..."
porterrobinson,3dxmly,GravityGod,2,Mon Jul 20 13:30:39 2015 UTC,"if the Forum won't let anyone over 18 be your guardian, then I'd suggest just using a friend's ID. As long as you look similar enough and can remember their details you should be fine :)"
porterrobinson,3dwpi2,GeekyCreeper,15,Mon Jul 20 04:05:56 2015 UTC,what
porterrobinson,3dwpi2,itsamox,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:25:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, apparently I misinterpreted your ""what"".   Here's an ELI5 for you:  I was working on producing a fake/concept Madeon and Porter collab album. Filne and I mocked up a tracklist and he made art.  I realized that I wasn't talented enough to make it happen, and that there are some very good producers, such as you, on this subreddit.  I am opening up the project to other producers to make it a group project where we all have input and work together to make the album.  :) sorry for the other comments, didn't know you were actually asking for explanation"

It'd make more sense to just do a compilation album showcasing the producers on this subreddit rather then slapping some other artist names on songs they have practically nothing to do with."
porterrobinson,3dwpi2,HypeGeist,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:37:26 2015 UTC,"If the album is supposed to be replicating the sound of a Porter and Madeon collab, why are the individual songs inspired by artists that are neither Porter nor Madeon?   Those are featured artists. All of the songs are (conceptually) by Porter and Madeon.   It'd make more sense to just do a compilation album showcasing the producers on this subreddit rather than slapping some other artist names on songs they have practically nothing to do with.   I think you missed the point. It's a concept, a ""What If...""  What if Ninth Parallel did a song with Madeon and Porter Robinson?  What if Madeon and Porter Robinson wrote an album together.  What if a whole bunch of talented people could create what we imagine this album would sound like."

porterrobinson,3dwpi2,letstakeacatnap,2,Mon Jul 20 06:41:49 2015 UTC,Oh cool! I'll have to apply soon. So basically an album in the style of Adventure and Worlds? How are these features happening though? Like Zedd and all that?
porterrobinson,3dwpi2,Shadowbro8,0,Mon Jul 20 14:48:54 2015 UTC,"Basically, we drafted out a tracklist of songs. Most of them have featured artists.  The idea behind it is that we create these songs in the style of the artists, just as a fun ~little~ big project. I'm allowing music producers on here to join the project, so that they can help create these songs, and turn the concept tracklist into an album."
porterrobinson,3dwpi2,neonblackattack,2,Mon Jul 20 20:35:32 2015 UTC,"Well damn, I wish I got into production myself, just so I could apply and maybe lend a hand in this awesome endeavor...   ... That said, I wish you all nothing but the best. This subreddit means a lot to me... Never before have I experienced so much awesome music as I have from this community. The Sky Lounge, the links to new tunes, and posts of Worlds remixes... All have been amazing. So thus, I cannot wait to see what this project turns into.  Geeky, while I'm not a producer myself, I have accumulated a lot of artists under my following tab on SC (azario123). If you, for whatever reason, need to find some peeps or just wanna check out songs for inspiration, feel free to thumb through my likes and followings. You probably will know most of them, but just throwing it out there as a resource. Mavoix, the artist I'm listening to as I type this, would be a good one for this venture... He's / she's / they've put out some tight PR / Madeon remixes & related music.  Best of luck,   A fellow feeler."
porterrobinson,3dwpi2,entendremavoix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:39 2015 UTC,Oh wow! Thank you so much!  There are quite a few artists like Mavoix I've been thinking about contacting! Thanks for the reminder!
