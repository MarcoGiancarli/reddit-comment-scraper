mechanical_gifs,3dml23,SexlessNights,63,Sat Jul 18 00:51:13 2015 UTC,Thats how a good bolt is threaded.  Cheap fasteners may have machined threads instead of rolled.
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,amaurer3210,21,Fri Jul 17 15:04:41 2015 UTC,Can you explain why the rolled version is better?
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,EirikHavre,63,Fri Jul 17 15:55:59 2015 UTC,"Rolling a thread causes intrinsic (residual) compressive stresses within the thread/bolt. This compressive stress makes it harder for microscopic cracks to propagate within the bolt and may ultimately prolong its life. Machining threads induces no such compressive stress. Additionally, (as far as I can remember) *rolled threads tend to have less extreme angles in the thread pattern compared with machined threads. The more extreme a 'discontinuity' in a workpiece, the more easily a crack can form and propagate.  Hopefully this helped. Source: 4th year mech end eng student"

mechanical_gifs,3dml23,Viking_Lordbeast,5,Fri Jul 17 20:36:42 2015 UTC,How does rolling affect the finished diameter of the bolt? I mean if you machine the threads I assume the threads won't be larger than the bolt diameter but how is the material redistributed when rolling?
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,falcongsr,6,Fri Jul 17 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"I don't have a concrete answer for you but if I understand your question correctly, the blank (un-deformed workpiece) would have a diameter larger than the desired pitch diameter of the bolt to be made. As the bolt is compressed through rolling, it will experience deformation (lengthening) in the direction of the length of the bolt.   ELI5: They use a bigger bolt than they need and it gets a little longer when they squish it to produce the threads.   To delve a little further, the material properties of the workpiece (specifically the Elastic Modulus and poisson's ratio) allow engineers/shopworkers to determine beforehand how much the cross section will reduce during deformation, and I guess they can then plan accordingly."
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,TypicalBeerLiker,6,Fri Jul 17 18:18:53 2015 UTC,"You don't think that, when being rolled, the metal would deform outward and fill the ""peak"" of the thread? Meaning that the outer diameter of the threaded section could end up larger than the unthreaded portion? It would obviously lengthen as well sightly."
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,nahreddit,9,Fri Jul 17 18:58:43 2015 UTC,Yes. The peak of the thread on a rolled bolt is higher than the unthreaded shaft.
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,2663999,5,Fri Jul 17 19:10:42 2015 UTC,"That's true in the textbooks, but the reality is that machined bolts can be much stronger, and higher tolerance. It may involve some pre or post treatment, but you end up with a much better (and more expensive) bolt."

mechanical_gifs,3dml23,Rx_EtOH,3,Fri Jul 17 18:12:48 2015 UTC,"My guess is that nuts would be tapped. Nuts are, to my knowledge, far less likely to fail than the bolt attached to it, so manufacturers would likely use whatever the cheaper / faster process."

mechanical_gifs,3dml23,TheWackyNeighbor,3,Fri Jul 17 15:59:23 2015 UTC,It's mostly due to grain structure
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,tooyoung_tooold,0,Fri Jul 17 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"You say tomayto, I say tomahto...  (i.e. work hardening changes the grain structure)"
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,TheWackyNeighbor,6,Fri Jul 17 22:59:54 2015 UTC,Those are actually very different things. Work hardening is mainly just topical hardening that trades hardness for flexibility. grain structures such as forging gives more strength without really making it more brittle by bending and contouring the grains.
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,tooyoung_tooold,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:07:17 2015 UTC,"This is false. Work hardening has very little, if nothing, to do with it."
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,bleedscarlet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:24:14 2015 UTC,Metal has a 'grain'. Rolling a thread means the grain of the metal follows the contours of the thread. A machined  thread will have a tendency to strip off.
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,2663999,4,Fri Jul 17 19:13:33 2015 UTC,Why would they machine bolts? Sounds like machining is more expensive than rolling it like this.
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,teasnorter,8,Fri Jul 17 19:42:33 2015 UTC,"Machined bolts can be made faster and with cheaper equipment.  They're also perfectly adequate for a great many applications.  Rolled bolts are demonstrably superior, but in many industries its irrelevant.  If you use lots of bolts or screws and can save 50% per fastener on a machined version that works fine for the application... why not?  In other industries, however, machined bolts are banned.  I work in spaceflight and many contracts demand that only rolled fasteners be used.  The uncertainty on strength, fracture resistance, and torque-to-preload uncertainty (perhaps due to a burr raised during machining) make machined screws unacceptable."
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,amaurer3210,3,Fri Jul 17 20:25:42 2015 UTC,"When you say machined bolts, I'm picturing a blank being put in a CNC like machine, which sounds expensive. The rolling method can quickly turn out a quality bolt in a swift motion, and that seems cheaper. Obviously I'm wrong, can you shed some light into why rolling is more expensive?"
mechanical_gifs,3dml23,teasnorter,2,Sat Jul 18 04:01:56 2015 UTC,"I think its way cheaper to buy the correct bolt instead of making or modifying one 99% of the time.   Tooling company's have been selling ""topping"" threading inserts for years now, they stop burrs from forming on the crest of the thread. Topping inserts also allow us to eliminate the finish pass we used to HAVE to do before threading. The downside of topping inserts is that you need a different insert for every thread pitch you cut, instead of ONE 60 degree insert for every standard thread. (M16x2 & M120x2 = the same topping insert)  I cut a lot of metal...  Edit added: standard"

Another common use is for when you cut a bolt or all-thread and want to repair the threads after filing down the sharp edges (although you can often just use a nut for this).

Edit: This is the best I could find... although the one she used had a frame above it for holding doodads -- it starts with the metal flaps unfolded, you drape the shirt over this, put a strip of cardboard in the collar and clamp it, put a large rectangle of cardboard in the middle of the shirt, flip up the bottom flap, then pull a lever. The machine would flip around the shirt and fold the side panels in, then another lever and it would flip it back around. You'd pull a new bag from a roll of plastic bags, pull it over the shirt, tear off the bag, then slide the shirt off the machine and put it in a big metal shelfing rack in a space based on the customer stamp.

If you took 20 classically-trained engineers and stuck them in a room and asked them to put a 90° bend in something, they'd probably come to a very standard design.    Innovation comes from trying out stuff ""because I can!"". Your designs are really cool. Hell, one of many engineers' favorite things is that Strandbeest concept from Theo Jansen. If he had been more practically minded, those things would have never come into existence."

mechanical_gifs,3d89e8,francis_0000a,119,Tue Jul 14 08:34:21 2015 UTC,"well, 7 million is a bit exaggerated, as you might have suspected ;)  But it's an unbelievably unefficient design.   My english is not the best, but I'll try to explain one of the main problems:  Look at the shaft in the middle, where the joint ""slides"" on. How would you make sure that it doesn't wear off extremely fast? The  joint in the middle has to withstand forces and moments in different direction, pretty much every direction. When the left shaft goes up, the right shaft goes down. Imagine how the joint in the middle would behave without the shaft in the middle. So the shaft has to withstand bending moments while gliding up and down without jamming. It's difficult enough to avoid a fast wear of on normal hydraulic cylinder, and they have to withstand forces in only one dircetion. This one has to withstand forces AND bending moments"

mechanical_gifs,3d89e8,_11_,22,Tue Jul 14 13:11:44 2015 UTC,"Sliding across a surface wears a TON faster than rolling across it.   Picture trying to ride a stock snowmobile on asphalt. Its skis would get destroyed so quickly, you'd never even get out of the neighborhood.    Gears work really well because their mating surfaces don't ever actually slide against one another (on the standard type of gear you're probably familiar with). They only roll, so there is extremely little wear over time. Here's a 90° bevel gear that would accomplish the same thing as what Gareth designed.     Gears are also really nice because there's a ton of material there to make the whole mate rigid, which adds to reliability. Gareth's design has a ton of overhang (compared to the gears) which would bend under loads.    Cool animation though! Playing with new moving designs is a great way to understand how things work. I like it. :)"
mechanical_gifs,3d89e8,BudDePo,5,Tue Jul 14 12:47:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but ball bearings would fix that.  I think this model was quickly drawn for the dynamics of the design rather than something that is actually being built, so they left out the bearings.    Edit:  It's would still wear quickly due to the forces being applied radially to the shaft, of course."

mechanical_gifs,3d89e8,ttarragon_man,2,Tue Jul 14 13:21:17 2015 UTC,Gears work really well because their mating surfaces don't ever actually slide against one another    Wrong-wrong-wrong. Get a text on gear design...or carefully make a mark on a pair of meshing gear teeth and look with a loupe and you can see the teeth rubbing each other.  A pair of gear teeth are like a cam and follower.   Have you never seen gear teeth worn until they are pointy? They get like that from rubbing on each other.
mechanical_gifs,3d89e8,_11_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:59:02 2015 UTC,"Involute gear profiles do not rub against each other in an appreciable way.  Tolerancing of course comes into play, so that manufacturing errors cause slight rubbing, but the whole point of the involute profile is to generate a geometry that rolls one surface against the other rather than sliding at the contact line of action .    The math behind it is also why the starting torque required to get a gear train moving does not include the static friction coefficient, μ_s, but rather the moving one, μ_k, as there's never any sliding surface to have to get moving.      The reason I said:    on the standard type of gear you're probably familiar with   is because not all gears do this. Most do, due to the involute profile's massively efficient nature (95-98% transmission of power). Worm gears are an example of this not holding true-- the mating gears slide along one another-- and as such commonly get efficiencies of 50-75%.    Helical gears are still involute profiles that roll at the line of action (94-98%). Hypoid are not quite (85-90%). Cycloid aren't quite either (75-90%).    Machinery's Handbook covers this pretty rigorously, as does the academic literature of the past 100 years.    I wouldn't call my explanation wrong-wrong-wrong, I guess."
mechanical_gifs,3d89e8,ttarragon_man,0,Wed Jul 15 18:23:14 2015 UTC,Involute teeth DO RUB. Get a text and learn. Or get a mesh and look with your own eyes. Make a mark on two teeth and watch them rub.
mechanical_gifs,3d89e8,_11_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:43:52 2015 UTC,"You're right that they do rub in the real world, but you don't have to be condescending about it. Empirical evidence doesn't change the ideal case, and I've already conceded that material properties and tolerancing errors cause wear in practical situations.    Pairs of involute curves, when rotated against one another at their PDs, provide a point of contact where relative motion is zero.     This is where force is transmitted, and in gearing terminology is the line of action. Force is solely transmitted along this line from one gear to another.   The friction that would cause the wear you're talking about is sliding friction, F= μ_k*N where N is the normal force at the moving point.    Since there's no moving at the point where there's a force, and there's no force at the places where the gears are moving, there's no rubbing friction.    This is the ideal case. The ideal case of a worm gear has sliding surfaces by definition.  Now, since there's deformation at the contact point due to the point force, you actually get a contact surface whose dimensions are a function of the material's modulus of elasticity and the applied force. This is not negligible, but it's not a huge player in the efficiencies of involute gears.   A good, recent article on this (as well as GD&T errors) can be found here (I'd give you the pdf, but it has PII on it).   All real world cases are imperfect versions of the ideal model, but idealized models can be very accurate predictors of performance.    Again, I wouldn't call my initial response wrong-wrong-wrong."
mechanical_gifs,3d89e8,ttarragon_man,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:16:37 2015 UTC,"Since there's no moving at the point where there's a force, and there's no force at the places where the gears are moving, there's no rubbing friction.   You're persistent:  You would need an infinite number of teeth for the load to be passed from tooth to tooth with all the force only at the pitch circle.  WRT ""wrong-wrong-wrong"", it got your attention, sent you back to your texts and made you and whoever else follows this thread aware of the sliding nature of gear teeth meshing."

mechanical_gifs,3d41tv,Zrel,43,Mon Jul 13 15:33:36 2015 UTC,"Basically this depends on the atmospheric pressure and exhaust speed. (how high you are and how high the throttle is)  Diagrams and info on the right of this page.  basically if the nozzle is to small, the flow expands into the air outside the nozzle, reducing power. If the nozzle is to big, the atmosphere compresses the stream as it exits the nozzle, reducing power.  If it is just right the exhaust goes exactly straight, and max momentum is transferred to the nozzle."
mechanical_gifs,3d41tv,pm_me_your_rockets,17,Mon Jul 13 16:14:15 2015 UTC,How is this controlled? Does the aircraft just measure the pressure and choose a diameter off a lookup table? Or is there more to it than that?

I know there are 30/60/90 day cycles on various components on both airframes.

mechanical_gifs,3d41tv,3rdweal,9,Tue Jul 14 00:42:32 2015 UTC,"In the 60s, missiles were not good enough to justify the argument.    Here are some stats for the AIM-7 medium range missile from the 1991 Gulf War, over two decades ago:   The most common version of the Sparrow today, the AIM-7M, entered service in 1982 and featured a new inverse monopulse seeker (matching the capabilities of Skyflash), active radar fuse, digital controls, improved ECM resistance, and better low-altitude performance. It was used to good advantage in the 1991 Gulf War, where it scored many USAF air-to-air kills. Of 44 missiles fired, 30 (68.2%) hit their intended targets resulting in 24/26 (54.5%/59.1%) kills. 19 kills were obtained beyond visual range.   More than half of the kills occurred beyond visual range - using a missile that was then already almost 10 years old - at a time when most current MIT students were still shitting their diapers. It would be just sentimental to think that thrust vectoring in today's environment would lend some kind of significant edge to an air superiority fighter."
mechanical_gifs,3d41tv,TheZigg89,3,Mon Jul 13 16:19:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, most air to air combat is and has been at long range for several decades. However the decision to not arm the F-4 Phantom in the early 60's with a cannon arose from the decision at that time that missile technology had made conventional dog-fighting anachronistic. The Viet Nam war proved that theory incorrect and F-4's were armed with cannon pods.  Thrust vectoring is not just about dog fighting, it is about aircraft control. My professor in college in turbines class specifically worked on developing a fluid dynamic thrust vectoring mechanism because a friend of his pulled up in an F-16 and stalled out at under 100 feet and pancaked into a runway crushing his spine and ending up a paraplegic. Thrust vectoring likely would have saved both this pilot and the aircraft.  Thrust vectoring has been employed on the F-22 which I believe was developed well after 360 degree missile technology was available."

In the Gulf War on the other hand, all fighters were furnished with cannon and there were to my knowledge zero gun kills (not counting a couple of incidents where A-10s shot down helicopters with their 30mm cannon) - which proves the point that unlike Vietnam, missiles are now actually good enough to render gun engagements extremely unlikely.   Thrust vectoring likely would have saved both this pilot and the aircraft.   ... as would software that would have prevented the aircraft ending up in that stall situation situation in the first place."

mechanical_gifs,3d41tv,AnythingApplied,36,Mon Jul 13 13:28:19 2015 UTC,"you really dont want to turn massive spinning parts while in flight; you get weird gyroscopic effects fighting you, it would take much larger motors, and you need a strong structural link between your engine and aircraft frame. gimbling the whole engine would actually be a much worse option; also, you wouldn't actually gain anything from doing that.   here, its a bunch of (relatively) small actuators, where if one fails, isnt as much of an issue (you wont just crash if one feather gets stuck out of place), and they can be turned much faster than havng to shift the whole engine as theyre much smaller."
mechanical_gifs,3d41tv,Throwaway1944719115,10,Mon Jul 13 13:34:44 2015 UTC,"Thrust vectoring doesn't affect efficiency that much, about 5%. Not many planes use it besides VSTOL (Vertical Short Take off and Landing) planes like the Harrier and F-35 and more recently planes like the F-22. The F-22 uses 2D unlike this gfy, meaning it only moves up and down not side to side. By doing so it gives the ability to turn tighter which can be the difference between life and death in a dogfight. With the advent of the newer generation missiles it really has no point as you no longer need to point the missile/plane at your target but can just look at and the missile will lock on. Missiles like Meteor from MBDA have a 3600 aspect so will be able to shoot behind the firing craft.    E:This is a Danish F-16 firing a AIM-9X at a 1800 angle. (From /r/MissileGfys)"
mechanical_gifs,3d41tv,autowikibot,11,Mon Jul 13 13:35:26 2015 UTC,One thing to note is that all axis TV bleeds energy like crazy. There are some write ups from F-22s fighting SU-27s (with TV) at a meet and the Raptor pilots said when the SUs started using their full vectoring it was only good for one turn as they would just end up near stall  when they came out of it......and have lost a ton of altitude. At that point it was nearly a guaranteed kill.   You are dead on about the new missiles though.
mechanical_gifs,3d41tv,pm_me_your_rockets,4,Mon Jul 13 13:42:52 2015 UTC,I think it's really interesting what happened between the F-22 and Typhoon at Red Flag in 2012.

mechanical_gifs,3d41tv,ilmedic,2,Mon Jul 13 14:45:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing anything definitive about the Typhoon wrecking the F22. Though the author of the second piece mentions TV as a negative for the Raptor:   what is obvious is that the F-22 has some weaknesses in close combat. The reason for this is that the F-22 has its thrust vectoring to turn quickly and this gives it an advantage in a dogfight, but if it does not score a kill then, it is in a lot of trouble to say the least. This come from the fact that once the Raptor has used its thrust vectoring it has lost a lot of speed, which tremendously increases the change of the Eurofighter to score the kill.   Granted, not exactly a nuanced explanation.   Conservation of moment is a huge factor in a dogfight, and turning on a dime with thrust vectoring - while cool to look at - is the exact opposite of conserving your momentum."

mechanical_gifs,3d41tv,Ko7a,2,Mon Jul 13 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"So if I understand your analogy well enough, that means that when the jet is going slower (burning less), they tighten the nozzle.

mechanical_gifs,3d41tv,AgEnT_x19,2,Mon Jul 13 17:48:02 2015 UTC,Yes.  Here is more information on the subject and the various types of exhaust nozzles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propelling_nozzle
mechanical_gifs,3d41tv,SpaceHooker,2,Mon Jul 13 18:08:08 2015 UTC,"Propelling nozzle:       A propelling nozzle converts a gas turbine or gas generator into a jet engine. Energy available in the gas turbine exhaust is converted into a high speed propelling jet by the nozzle. Turbofan engines may have an additional and separate propelling nozzle which produces a high speed propelling jet from the energy in the air that has passed through the fan. In addition, the nozzle helps to determine how the gas generator and fan operate as it acts as a downstream restrictor.   Propelling nozzles accelerate the available gas to subsonic, transonic, or supersonic velocities depending on the power setting of the engine, their internal shape and the pressures at entry to, and exit from, the nozzle. The internal shape may be convergent or convergent-divergent (C-D). C-D nozzles can accelerate the jet to supersonic velocities within the divergent section, whereas a convergent nozzle cannot accelerate the jet beyond sonic speed.   Propelling nozzles may have a fixed geometry, or they may have variable geometry to give different exit areas to control the operation of the engine when equipped with an afterburner or a reheat system. When afterburning engines are equipped with a C-D nozzle the throat area is variable. Nozzles for supersonic flight speeds, at which high nozzle pressure ratios are generated,  also have variable area divergent sections.

mechanical_gifs,3d4yvv,maximuszen,3,Mon Jul 13 20:57:27 2015 UTC,"There are a couple different ways of making sure that the power of the mainspring stays constant as it's delivered to the escapement, if that's what you mean. But the spring at the center of the balance wheel (seen here) isn't what gets wound, it just serves as the pendulum. The wheel on the right is being constantly forced in a counterclockwise direction by the spring, but can only advance from one notch to the next by the pendulum action of the balance wheel. The little whack that the wheel gives to the top of the fork (at the center of the left wheel) slides the purple jewel to the sloped section of the oddly-shaped teeth of the wheel on the right. Because it's no longer stuck on the jewel, the wheel slides forward and pushes the jewel (putting energy back into the pendulum) until the other side contacts a tooth, then everything stops. It holds there until the balance wheel swings all the way out, then back again to whack the jewel out of place again and the whole thing goes in the other direction.   It's the gold standard of watch movements. There have been some alternatives invented in the past few decades (considering that the lever arm is hundreds of years old, that's pretty impressive), most notably the Co-Axial Escapement that Omega uses in a lot of their watches these days."

Winding the timepiece, by turning a knob or key, stores energy in the mainspring by twisting the spiral tighter. The force of the mainspring then turns the clock's wheels as it unwinds, until the next winding is needed.

Now you can add something that's called a tourbillion that rotates the entire secapement mechanism on an axis so these disturbances get averaged around that axis (costs 30k extra) or even two axes (even more, I cant be bothered to look it up now). these things add some degree of accuracy, but even it's not a perfect system considering that humans move quite randomly.  add to that the fact that the power source spring is stronger when the watch is yound up more and your watch is imprecise even if you don't move it at all(unless you own one of these)"

mechanical_gifs,3ctnbs,sprayk,3,Sat Jul 11 04:53:28 2015 UTC,What is the advantage of this? Pumping blood or something that needs to be kept clean?
mechanical_gifs,3ctnbs,TacoRedneck,8,Sat Jul 11 14:35:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly. Used in medical allocations as well as industrial applications where you don't want the working fluid to come on contact twitch the pump. Also you can pump more viscous fluids with this type of pump."

mechanical_gifs,3ctnbs,junkstuff1,11,Sat Jul 11 01:22:42 2015 UTC,"Most operate at much higher flow rates than the system requires, and instead use a relief system to bleed off the excess. Makes sealing just a little easier as an added benefit since you won't need as tight tolerances."
mechanical_gifs,3ctnbs,Anticept,3,Sat Jul 11 01:49:24 2015 UTC,how does the relief system work?
mechanical_gifs,3ctnbs,cupajaffer,4,Sat Jul 11 06:57:07 2015 UTC,"Either it will route back to the tank, or route back to the inlet side of the pump, depending on the type of system. Oil pumping systems tend to route to inlet side.  In the simplest form, the relief part is just a spring and check valve. They put washers behind the spring (increase pressure required to open) and have a pressure gauge on the system. Removing washers decreases the pressure required. When something in the system opens, pressure at the relief valve drops and it closes some.  In addition, many critical systems that need emergency reserves and/or to smooth out pressure fluctuations in the system will use accumulators. These act like hydraulic capacitors. On one side, there is a nitrogen air charge, which is highly compressible, on the other is the tap for the hydraulic system, and they are separated by a diaphragm or piston and seal. When system pressure comes up, the accumulator takes up fluid and compresses the nitrogen, and when it drops down, the fluid leaves and uncompresses the nitrogen.  Feathering oil driven propellers and hydraulic control systems in aircraft are two examples of systems that make use of everything I described here (but may skip the accumulator in some installations)."

mechanical_gifs,3ctnbs,tradersam,7,Sat Jul 11 00:18:04 2015 UTC,This is called a positive displacement pump which pumps a given volume of fluid with each turn. Compared to a turbine style pump where volume depends on the pressure.

mechanical_gifs,3ctnbs,5uspect,3,Mon Jul 13 12:28:29 2015 UTC,Gear pumps tend to be pretty good at maintaining performance across various conditions. Most pumps are characterised by a pump curve. This tells you how much flow rate you should get for a given back pressure. Or conversely how much pressure for a given back flow. Gear pumps have a pretty flat response.

mechanical_gifs,3cpbfh,SMORKIN_LABBIT,12,Thu Jul 9 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"It's true that NASA does have the largest FSW machine in the world. It's at the Michoud Assembly Facility just south of New Orleans. The thing is insanely cool to see, the building I'm in actually has a profile model they're testing for the block 2 SLS.  In terms of the F-1 I think it was more a loss of manufacturing details not a lack of skill in manpower. After the end of the Apollo program a lot of documentation was ""lost "" both because of the size of the project and differing political points so the exact construction details for a big part of the Saturn V is no longer available. It's like the pyramids of Giza, sure we could rebuild them today, but I have no idea how they did it 6000 years ago."
mechanical_gifs,3cpbfh,AndrewFGleich,4,Thu Jul 9 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"SLS is using friction stir welding, not friction welding as shown in the gif above."
mechanical_gifs,3cpbfh,asad137,5,Thu Jul 9 23:53:35 2015 UTC,"Not exactly the same process, but the same idea... Space X uses Friction Welding for many of their components.  Edit: oh and from what I read it's better than TIG/MIG generally because it works on different types of materials, and doesn't (can't) leave void/air pockets in the weld. Also, there's less 'damage' to the nearby metal. I guess it ends up giving you a more easily reproducible weld that you can test, and then trust. Where as TIG/MIG rigs have a high level of entropy to them."
mechanical_gifs,3cpbfh,ElMalakai,5,Thu Jul 9 18:36:03 2015 UTC,From SpaceX's website...    The tanks and domes are fabricated entirely in-house by SpaceX using SpaceX’s custom-made friction stir welders to execute the strongest and most reliable welding technique available.

mechanical_gifs,3cpbfh,27496,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:12:32 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine it depends on the size of the part. Assuming these two shafts are solid, you'd probably get more heat in the middle using this method, but if it's just two hollow pipes, then you could probably get similar results with either method.  In terms of automation and repeatability, I'd guess you could do the friction weld more easily, unless you happen to have a welding robot handy."

Once spinning at the proper speed, the motor is removed and the pieces forced together under pressure. The force is kept on the pieces after the spinning stops to allow the weld to ""set""."

mechanical_gifs,3cfzd6,frankvanm,8,Tue Jul 7 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"Depends on the size of the cut and the type of aluminum. generally, easier cuts use higher rpms and harder cuts use higher torque. Keyword: generally."

mechanical_gifs,3cfzd6,frankvanm,3,Tue Jul 7 21:29:47 2015 UTC,Smaller diameter would definitely be easier. If I were to blindly guess I would says to start at 1500 rpm and see how it feels from there.

mechanical_gifs,3cfzd6,Breakthrough248,7,Tue Jul 7 22:34:36 2015 UTC,"SFPM for carbide inserts in aluminum is north of 1200 so if that's a 1"" drill, maybe 5,000 rpm? BUT BUT BUT aluminum's not really limited by the cutter's ability to hold an edge so much as it is the process's ability to cool the cut zone, remove chips, and operate the chip breaker properly. If you can do these things, you can run aluminum super fast.   If not, you have to slow down, peck, adjust your feed, etc. Also, vibration becomes an issue at those crazy surface speeds based on the feed, the power of the spindle, and the rigidity of the tool and workpiece/supports. Most regular sized machine tool spindles don't have great torque at 5,000 rpm - it could take 20% or more of the motor's power just to keep the spindle rotating that fast, forget about cutting.  tl;dr it depends."
mechanical_gifs,3cfzd6,DeleteFromUsers,2,Tue Jul 7 21:04:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Soo if you use a lower speed due to the specific machine available, can one optimize the process by best controling the temperature and chips?"
mechanical_gifs,3cfzd6,frankvanm,3,Tue Jul 7 21:34:23 2015 UTC,"You have feed limitations based on the chip breaker (to make it actually work) and the clearance angle (more importantly). If you have a low rpm spindle with lots of torque, you could create a cutter that has adequate clearance to allow a massive chipload (feed) but not as an indexable cutter. It'd be custom HSS or carbide.  Temperature is based on chipload (feed) and rpm (speed). At a low rpm you're unlikely to have heat issues unless your chipload is off the scale."

mechanical_gifs,3c5gun,brtt3000,13,Sun Jul 5 03:52:42 2015 UTC,"If your mason is doing your stocking and block work, I don't know how you're making money. Five or six layers if the job's big enough, one or two hands to a layer, plus a foreman for layout, and an operator. Add hands if the block needs to be fully grouted or if there's weirdness about the scaffolding on the job.  The way I see it, this thing replaces one (or slightly more than one) layer. The stockers stay the same, putting brick and mortar in hoppers rather than boards. Your foreman, operator and scaffolders stay the same. It's a slight investment in setup for a slight return in setting. The maintenance can be one guy for multiple machines, maybe even contract work.  I'm not saying this thing is revolutionary, it's just like the laser-plane dirtwork machines, or the sheetpile driving robot. Occasionally it will make somebody money, but is more trouble than it's worth for most jobs. So far anyway. It could probably make money in markets that don't have enough talent (of which there are a growing number) or jobs that are time sensitive and run multiple shifts."

mechanical_gifs,3c5gun,Jrook,10,Sun Jul 5 09:44:01 2015 UTC,I think most posters here are ignoring the scalability of these machines. Eventually the stickers will be replaced by loading entire pallets of bricks at once. The machine will have two laying arms that are each twice times as fast.  The scaffolding will be part of the machine and not a separate part. And there will be two to five machines on site all operating simultaneously.

mechanical_gifs,3c5gun,Tamer_,2,Sun Jul 5 10:44:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's dumb because it is essentially  copying a human arm. Which, maybe is the most effective route, but you'd think there'd be a more efficient route to brick laying."
mechanical_gifs,3c5gun,Please_Pass_The_Milk,12,Sun Jul 5 21:21:26 2015 UTC,"How many years does it take to train a baby to become a skilled bricklayer? Thanks to robots like these, said baby will now have the opportunity to compete in service or sales right out of high school!"
mechanical_gifs,3c5gun,Hobbycoder,13,Sun Jul 5 03:53:19 2015 UTC,"Bricks per minute? Sure, a human beats this.  Bricks per hour? Probably still, yeah.  But bricks per day? No. Not even close. The robot works until the bricks or mortar run out. The bricklayer works his 8 hour day with breaks.  Bricks per week? The bricklayer has two of those days off.  Bricks per year? The bricklayer takes vacations. The bricklayer gets sick. The bricklayer has emergencies.  So no, a skilled bricklayer can only do this faster if you're looking at the very smallest of time frames."
mechanical_gifs,3c5gun,Please_Pass_The_Milk,14,Sun Jul 5 09:23:21 2015 UTC,"The machine has to be refilled by a human. It has to be supervised by a human (you can't just let heavy machinery run on its own and go home). The machine will get broken in the same way the bricklayer gets sick, but when the bricklayer gets sick, he pays his own medicine, while the machines reparature has to be paid by the company.    So the bricklayer is still on the win here.     So no, a skilled bricklayer can only do this faster if you're looking at the very smallest of time frames.     Assuming that a bricklayer is 3 times faster than this machine (which needs a supervisor) then they get even per day. a day is not the ""very smallest time frame"""
mechanical_gifs,3c5gun,drive2fast,7,Sun Jul 5 10:58:46 2015 UTC,"The machine has to be refilled by a human.   So does the workspace of a bricklayer. This is, in fact, exactly the same.   It has to be supervised by a human (you can't just let heavy machinery run on its own and go home).   As does a bricklayer. You don't just let people run amok on your jobsite unattended, that's criminal negligence. Furthermore, lights-out manufacturing is literally letting heavy machinery run on its own and going home. Some lights-out plants aren't even actively monitored. So provided the technology gets fully automated feeds at some point yes, yes you absolutely could just turn it on and go home.   The machine will get broken in the same way the bricklayer gets sick, but when the bricklayer gets sick, he pays his own medicine, while the machines reparature has to be paid by the company.   But if the cost of the machine, it's daily operation, and its repair is cheaper than the bricklayer, the bricklayer is still more expensive. Also, it costs the company productivity when a bricklayer is out sick, and the longer they're out, the more it costs. A machine like this isn't going to be down for very long, at most replacing it entirely (a last resort) could take a week or two. Whereas a broken limb would take a bricklayer weeks to recover from, and that's not exactly the World's Rarest Thing on an active jobsite.   Assuming that a bricklayer is 3 times faster than this machine (which needs a supervisor) then they get even per day. a day is not the ""very smallest time frame""   A day is pretty damn small, and we both know that if this machine maintains the pace shown in the video that a bricklayer isn't anywhere near 3x faster than it."
mechanical_gifs,3c5gun,reynolds753,9,Sun Jul 5 11:38:09 2015 UTC,"Millwright here, I work on robots.   That robot needs a perfect straight track floor, often which won't be available. Note that they set it up on a man lift. That is a 'perfect world' construction site. Drive over a small scrap of wood and that machine will probably spit an error and stop. The brick layer steps over it.  That robot has to be programmed and set up for the job. The brick layer can just set up a string line and start loading bricks.  This is a neat looking demo, but I bet the setup took almost as long as it would have taken the brick layer to do the job. Oh, as a robot tech I am probably billing out twice the rate that brick layer is billing out at.  The quality control is not as good as you think either. That robot has no idea if it's mortar dispenser jammed up or didn't spread evenly. That's why they are wasting all that extra mortar. Robots are incredibly stupid. Who is scraping the mortar? Probably a human who is inspecting the quality and checking for air pockets. Yes, this machine not only needs a babysitter, but needs one holding a deadman switch AT ALL TIMES in order for it to operate outside of a safety cage (as per OSHA). That robot is a killer.  The only way to work with robots cost effectively is assembly line repetitive tasks. They can do the same horrible miserable task again and again. If you were making 200 buildings exactly the same, it would probably be worthwhile experimenting with this. But we seldom build like that. Everyone wants custom work and every building site has variances. Terrible environments for robots. Great environments for meatbots.  Now, 3D printing of an entire structure however out of concrete... That is where robots will shine. Mostly. Set up a massive crane sized printer and let it go. The problem is that now you have a house built entirely out of concrete. Want to move a wall in a wood and drywall house? No problem. 3D printed concrete? Fuck no. It is set in stone and you are renting the big jackhammer now. There is a reason we build like we do right now. Wood homes can be made energy efficient, quiet and are cheap to reconfigure. 3D printed concrete is a nightmare and you did not give any thought to insulation. Concrete also has a massive carbon footprint, where wood is quite carbon neutral and easily disposed of.   So go ahead and get into trades. You'll be happy and make a good living in areas that don't have cheap illegal labour readily available. Places like Canada have proper trade licensing and really well paying jobs. Want to be future proof? Learn to fix the robots.  Usually that is a second/third trade as the skill set required is quite up there. Pick something technical and start from there."

mechanical_gifs,3c5gun,Tssusmc,4,Sun Jul 5 23:05:13 2015 UTC,"Independent contractor, Canadian red seal certified millwright. I have service contracts with plants that have robots, and I make all sorts of weird equipment. Mostly for food plants and the printing industry right now.  How I got into this? Spent 8 years as a high level automotive tech. Lots of electrical/drivability/custom stuff. I literally peaked at age 25 at a high paying auto dealer and got really miserable. Automotive is either replace parts with known good parts (dealer), or make fuck all working on cool custom cars.  Did both, learned a lot more working in a high end custom electrical shop than anything else.  I left the industry and started yet another 4 year apprenticeship in a sawmill. Which is another fertile learning ground. Because there is no giant sawmill equipment store, you make everything. Plus all equipment is designed by Wile E. Coyote in this industry. This plant was a high end, heavily automated place ($45M in investment). Bounced around from there and picked up a lot fixing factory equipment. Had a main customer who's robot took a shit, and the guys brought in to fix it had to wait 2 days to get a part. So I started off with that 2 day crash course and started fine tuning their terrible original programming. After that, it's mostly self education and building, programming PLC's, customizing weird stuff, etc.  Basically, take a job based on learning difficulty and skills acquired before ANYTHING ELSE. Do this for a couple of decades, and expect to deal with some shitty jobs to get your foot in the door.  Apprenticeships in Canada are difficult and you learn a lot. If there is no opportunity in your area for this, fucking move.   Also, watch the Canadian version of 'How it's made'. The 'Murican one is seriously dumbed down."

mechanical_gifs,3c5gun,TENRIB,0,Thu Jul 9 16:00:57 2015 UTC,"That robot needs a perfect straight track floor, often which won't be available. Note that they set it up on a man lift. That is a 'perfect world' construction site. Drive over a small scrap of wood and that machine will probably spit an error and stop. The brick layer steps over it.   Robots are actually really adaptable, Honda's manufacturing porter robots run on painted lines on the floor and can handle up to a 10° differentiation from level before they have issues. Robots have the tolerances they're designed to have. If your robots need ""perfectly straight track floors"" then that's a design flaw, nothing more, and cannot be applied to robots in general.   That robot has to be programmed and set up for the job. The brick layer can just set up a string line and start loading bricks. This is a neat looking demo, but I bet the setup took almost as long as it would have taken the brick layer to do the job.   Again, robots can be really adaptable. It's entirely reasonable to believe that something like this could operate off an uploaded CAD file, or even just an adjustable control console. If your robots are difficult or inconvenient to communicate with that's, again, a design flaw and cannot be applied to robots in general. Also, the full setup took five hours including what appears to have been an hour long break, it was in the video. A bricklayer cannot lay a 20 foot wall in five hours.   The quality control is not as good as you think either. That robot has no idea if it's mortar dispenser jammed up or didn't spread evenly.   Again, we run into the problem where you think problems with your specific devices can be applied generally across all robots. One of the models of 3d printers I work with on a regular basis detects if the extruder head jams as soon as it happens, without affecting the print. It's entirely possible and even reasonable for a robot to be able to detect when feeds and flows are not functioning the way they should, and a lack of said detection is again, a design flaw.   Yes, this machine not only needs a babysitter, but needs one holding a deadman switch AT ALL TIMES in order for it to operate outside of a safety cage (as per OSHA). That robot is a killer.   This is the point where I can't really continue to take you seriously because you're obviously building a strawman. First of all, there's obviously a cage around the robot's work area. Second of all, OSHA doesn't require very many machines to be caged at all, especially in construction. A good example is an automated concrete leveler. Automated concrete levelers on liftarms are allowed to operate without supervision, despite the fact that even manned ones are obscenely dangerous and will hack off your limbs if given the slightest opportunity. Yes, it's a relatively new technology, but I've watched them operate on countless projects around here (they were developed in this region) and they do not do so in cages.   The only way to work with robots cost effectively is assembly line repetitive tasks.   Bricklaying is so repetitive that masons unions require frequent breaks and suggest specific exercises to prevent carpal-tunnel. How you can imagine this doesn't qualify for automation is beyond me.   Now, 3D printing of an entire structure however out of concrete...    And we're back to the totally unbelievable side of your argument. Few buildings are fully manufactured in concrete anymore. Did you perhaps mean to say cinderblocks? Because that's, again, a task that automation is uniquely suited for. Unless you're referring to Andrey Rudenko's proof-of-concept concrete castle he 3d printed, in which case that's a proof of concept and not some sort of production dry run.  Also it's funny that you bring up stickbuilt homes because drywall lifts have been becoming increasingly motorized over the last 30 years. Drywall companies now have lifts that can lift and place drywall in more-or-less any configuration and at any angle, and those machines are widely adopted because they slash insurance bills. People die every year falling off ladders while trying to install drywall.  Machines don't die, ever.   So go ahead and get into trades.   I don't need career advice, I already work in Systems. I'm one of the ones taking the jobs away. ""Learn to fix the robots"" is only good advice until we get the robots to fix each other and eventually themselves."

mechanical_gifs,3c5gun,TENRIB,2,Thu Jul 9 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"A thousand bricks a day over an 8 hour shift is a brick every 28.8 seconds. This machine lays a brick in 16 seconds, and it does it for its full operating time. Even if it only runs 8 hours a day (one full shift) that's 1800 bricks a day. 16 hours a day (two shifts) is 3600 bricks a day.  So assuming this works eight hours a day, five days a week, 52 weeks a year it'll lay 468k bricks a year. Your human will only lay 240k. If it works 16 hours a day (again, that's just two shifts of supporting humans) it'll lay 936k. So nearly double the annual output of a human, or nearly quadruple."

OSHA lets fully automated concrete levelers run outside cages (in fact they never require a cage) and a concrete leveler is a gigantic blade that necessarily has hundreds of pounds of torque applied. This robot could kill you if there's not resistance-sensitive actuators involved. A concrete leveler (manned or automated) will kill you straight-up dead because it has to be able to do so to do its job.  You guys can say these things all you want, but construction is a dangerous job and dangerous jobs are some of the most economical to automate for the simple reason that when machines die their families don't sue."

The real ""gotcha"" there is maintained properly. If you let yourself run low on oil and/or flog the engine like a teenager, they'll take a good beating just like piston rings. They're not really much more delicate than piston rings, but when you thrash a piston engine you generally just get a minor compression loss and burn more oil. Thrash your apex seals and the engine won't like to start, won't like to idle, and won't like to run, so you can't just ignore it like all those guys driving Honda Civics blowing blue smoke out the exhaust pipe."

mechanical_gifs,3c20ws,kashew1011,2,Sat Jul 4 15:56:02 2015 UTC,"Oil lubricates the apex seals sliding against the housing. The oil is actually pre-mixed in with the fuel so it is sprayed into your engine with the gas to lubricate. The engine is ""designed"" to burn oil, so if you do not keep an eye on your oil level it can lead to premature wear on the seals or even blowing a seal. I've had both an RX-7 and RX-8 (Mazda) and they have these engines, the dealers do a piss poor job relaying this information and if you buy it from a different dealer other than Mazda odds are they will not tell you anything at all, I test drove an 8 at a Dodge dealer (used) and the guy tried telling me it had a V8...

mechanical_gifs,3b4oyr,thorium220,12,Fri Jun 26 04:02:08 2015 UTC,"That's a jacket stripper though, not a wire stripper.  Your tool is for removing the outer jacket of Coax or multi-conductor cables (CAT5/6 etc.) and exposing the (still insulated) wires or shielding inside.  The tool the OP linked is a true wire stripper that is made to expose the bare conductor of a single wire or in this case two single wires at once."

mechanical_gifs,3b4oyr,thorium220,8,Sat Jun 27 01:08:03 2015 UTC,I've never seen one like that! Very cool!
mechanical_gifs,3b4oyr,eatsmeats,15,Fri Jun 26 04:20:01 2015 UTC,"It's advantage is that it will score or cut the outer sheath of Cat1/3/5e/6/6A etc. without damaging any of the wires within.

mechanical_gifs,3b4oyr,thorium220,8,Fri Jun 26 08:55:21 2015 UTC,"That trimmer requires finesse. The one in the gif gives pretty much anyone the ability to cleanly strip wire with a simple squeeze.   Edit: I see you have a somewhat specialized use case. you probably don't have to strip much wire to metal, so that stripper probably makes your job a lot easier than the one in the gif"
mechanical_gifs,3b4oyr,thorium220,9,Fri Jun 26 06:21:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it'd suck for going down to metal, but for removing the sheath of multi-wire cable, it's bloody fantastic.  For regular/audio-grade stripping I've got one of these."

mechanical_gifs,3b4oyr,thorium220,2,Fri Jun 26 22:19:48 2015 UTC,How does it work?
mechanical_gifs,3b4oyr,milanvo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:12:16 2015 UTC,"First off, it's not so much a wire stripper as a cable stripper i.e. you want to remove the outer insulation sheath without damaging the insulated wires inside.  You put your index finger in the hole and press down on the lever with your thumb, then you put the cable into the appropriately-sized notch. you then gently rotate the blade around the cable. It should only score the sheath, and should not cut all the way through. You then bend the cable to break the sheath and slide it off.  The metal bit on the end is a 110 punch-down tool for terminating wires into punch-down blocks (not dissimilar to a Krone tool)."

mechanical_gifs,3ax3d4,manondorf,5,Wed Jun 24 21:54:52 2015 UTC,Why in the world would it need to be heated?  The red tint is the coppers luster rather than glow from heat. Machining processes deforming the metals usually create a lot of heat that needs to be cooled with liquids in order not to destroy the crystalline properties of the material.
mechanical_gifs,3ax3d4,PointyOintment,4,Wed Jun 24 12:25:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok. I figured it would likely need heat to be easily deformable, and the (what looks like) glow seemed to back up that hypothesis."

mechanical_gifs,3ax3d4,Na3s,3,Thu Jun 25 04:43:10 2015 UTC,"nothing is red hot, skiving is a room temperature process, probably does heat up some due to friction.  Copper glows dull cherry red, but this is orange, and it woudl oxidize like hell if it's glowing.    No need to heat copper when working it like this.  You don't heat shears or knives."

It's essentially a wood planer.
mechanical_gifs,3ax3d4,metarinka,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:44:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the necro, but question: Wouldn't skiving result in an asymmetrical heat sink? As in the base has a slight slope thats equal to the thickness of the fin over the height of the fin. I feel like that could add up quickly even for smaller heat sinks. A 20 fin hs with 5mm thick fins would have a 100mm difference in base thickness. I'm not too familiar with designing heat sinks but wouldn't that make a noticeable heat gradient across it?"
mechanical_gifs,3ax3d4,NubieMcGrowerson,0,Wed Jun 24 22:01:45 2015 UTC,"no it doesn't interestingly enough, it's hard to explain but if you look at both this gif and any finished heatsink you'll see all the fins are the same height.

mechanical_gifs,3aqyve,helio203,17,Mon Jun 22 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"It is triggered by excessive current over a period of time. A brief surge over nominal rating won't trip it. Here's how it works:  1.) Too much current flows through through the circuit  2.) The lower bimetallic strip deforms outward as it heats  3.) The hook releases the spring loaded center contact and raises the plunger  4.) As the bimetallic strip cools, it will return to a shape that retains the contact in place  5.) When you depress the plunger (as pictured), the mechanism is reset"
mechanical_gifs,3aqyve,MuaddibMcFly,4,Mon Jun 22 21:14:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's why breakers have Instantaneous loads and Prolonged loads, right?  Because heavy loads will overheat the breakers (virtually) instantaneously, and lower loads will take time to build up that level of heat?"
mechanical_gifs,3aqyve,mc2880,10,Tue Jun 23 01:46:48 2015 UTC,"Every over current device has a curve which describes the trip behavior.  Your standard circuit breaker at home operates similar to the one posted. There is a bi-metallic strip that triggers the trip when it is heated up.   Another type of circuit breaker referred to as ""Fully Magnetic"" ignores this heating and will only trip when the current limit is exceeded. This is usefull in things like theatrical dimmers.   There is another common type ""Inverse Time Circuit Breaker"" this one trips faster the larger the current draw. So a dead short will trip really quickly, while a small overload will take a long time to trip."

He is said to have worked as a ""steel-driving man""—a man tasked with hammering a steel drill into rock to make holes for explosives to blast the rock in constructing a railroad tunnel. According to legend, John Henry's prowess as a steel-driver was measured in a race against a steam powered hammer, which he won, only to die in victory with his hammer in his hand as his heart gave out from stress. The story of John Henry is told in a classic folk song, which exists in many versions, and has been the subject of numerous stories, plays, books and novels.   Various locations, including Big Bend Tunnel in West Virginia, Lewis Tunnel in Virginia, and Coosa Mountain Tunnel in Alabama, have been suggested as the site of the contest.

mechanical_gifs,3a2r2b,oskay,5,Wed Jun 17 10:56:54 2015 UTC,"Dial indicators are pretty damn interesting.  Mostly you calibrate to 0 by turning the face itself before getting started. Actual 0 isn't as important here as looking for variances.  Now, the precision itself is basically due to incredibly high manufacturing precision. You can get cheaper dial indicators, but any self-respecting machinist knows better. Brown & Sharpe and Starrett both make some good stuff, but you're looking at $200-300 for just the indicator. More like $400-500 for a set with a few accessories."

mechanical_gifs,39jix6,FearTheCron,10,Fri Jun 12 04:50:49 2015 UTC,Could you explain what's actually going on with the blinking lights? I have limited knowledge in this field.
mechanical_gifs,39jix6,offlightsedge,23,Fri Jun 12 06:45:23 2015 UTC,"It's designed to fire on alternating cylinders.  If you start numbering them from top clockwise, it's firing order is 1-3-5-7-2-4-6.  The blinking light indicates that the cylinder has pressurized a fuel and air mixture and the light itself is the spark plug igniting the mix.  After the light goes out the cylinder goes all the way down burning the fuel mix, then all the way up forcing the exhaust out of the cylinder, then all the way down again to draw more air/fuel in, then back up to the top to meet the spark plug and ignite to start all over."
mechanical_gifs,39jix6,MuaddibMcFly,4,Fri Jun 12 07:50:50 2015 UTC,Why is the firing order offset? Like why not 1-2-3-4-5-6-7?
mechanical_gifs,39jix6,1-800-CUM-SHOT,19,Fri Jun 12 18:59:54 2015 UTC,"By distributing evenly, you never have a cycle where none of the cylinders fire.  Compare the two firing orders (bold being the firing of that cylinder):  1-2-3-4-5-6-7-1-2-3-4-5-6-7  1-2-3-4-5-6-7-1-2-3-4-5-6-7  With sequential firing, you go one full rotation without power being generated, but with alternating firing, you only go [2]/7th  of a rotation without power being generated.  The same thing happens with even numbered cylinders, too, except they're paired.  At any given time, one of the paired cylinders will be in its down-stroke (power generation or fuel intake), and the other will be in its up-stroke (exhaust, or compression).  Then, each pair is distributed as evenly as possible, to maintain steady power.  This is only something for engines that have a 4-stroke cycles, such as 4 stroke or diesel engines.  2-Stroke engines and wankle engines do not have a non-firing cycle of motion, and could easily be put in a sequential firing order."

mechanical_gifs,39jix6,risfutile,11,Fri Jun 12 20:01:46 2015 UTC,How would the upper cylinders get lubricated? Was there a pump that delivered oil above?
mechanical_gifs,39jix6,pomjuice,33,Fri Jun 12 08:05:04 2015 UTC,"Well, on some early radials, the whole engine actually rotated.  The prop was bolted directly to the motor and the shaft was attached to the body of the aircraft.  This allowed for very effective cooling of the cylinders.  It’s also why WWI pilots are seen wearing those long, dashing scarves.  These engines had ‘total loss’ oil systems wherein the oil entered the cylinders from the inner, crankcase side, was propelled through them by the centripetal force of the spinning engine, and ejected out the ends of the cylinders after only one use.  Thus, pilots needed those scarves to keep wiping the flying oil off of their goggles and windscreens.  Later radials did have a more conventional oil pump and circulation system, but someone more knowledgeable can speak to that."

mechanical_gifs,39jix6,BloodyIron,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:56:00 2015 UTC,Still a radial.  A rotary engine with conventional pistons is a subset of radials (as opposed to Wankels and other exotic rotaries).  Not all radials are rotary.

mechanical_gifs,39jix6,BigBadBorz,3,Fri Jun 12 20:41:00 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  It was part of what finally killed the rotary concept.  The range limitation imposed by oil usage made it impractical as flight times went up.  It did, though, have some advantages.  Weight and simplicity:  with no pumps or filters, there isn't much to go wrong on the system and it more than makes up for the weight of the extra oil for the short times that a WWI fighter would stay in the air.  Constant high quality oil - with no return, there's no need to worry about crud of any sort building up in your oil.  It's always factory fresh"

Also that must be some godly torque."
mechanical_gifs,39jix6,drunkenviking,3,Thu Jul 9 18:50:56 2015 UTC,Is the propellor connected directly to the crankshaft or is there some gearing also going on?
mechanical_gifs,39jix6,flyboy324,2,Fri Jun 12 16:58:22 2015 UTC,It looks to me like it's connected directly to the crankshaft.
mechanical_gifs,39jix6,drunkenviking,3,Fri Jun 12 17:37:26 2015 UTC,Is that common?
mechanical_gifs,39jix6,flyboy324,2,Fri Jun 12 18:07:29 2015 UTC,"It is for the smaller engines. 4 cylinder opposed, 7 and 9 cylinder radials mostly are directly mounted on. 8 cylinder and some 6 cylinder opposed have gear reductions and i would think the multi-row radial engines would as well. It all depends on the max RPM and prop length, the prop is ineffective if the blade tips begin to spin past supersonic speeds"
mechanical_gifs,39jix6,drunkenviking,2,Fri Jun 12 20:22:56 2015 UTC,the prop is ineffective if the blade tips begin to spin past supersonic speeds   Why is that?
mechanical_gifs,39jix6,Raysharp,2,Fri Jun 12 20:36:11 2015 UTC,Air behaves much different once moving at supersonic speeds. When approaching the speed of sound the air will compress instead of flowing smoothly around an object. The prop wont move the air like it should on the areas where it is super sonic. This is also why you can see  shockcones on jets but just formed in the areas where the air is supersonic.

I'm sure someone else can explain more eloquently."

mechanical_gifs,395z36,erktheerk,19,Tue Jun 9 16:36:34 2015 UTC,The drill is designed to do it. Chip management is critical. When the shavings start stringing up the drill is no longer working correctly or your feed speeds are off.  EDIT: Doesn't mean the drill is ruined if it stops chipping. We use drills to their breaking point where I work.  Also for drilling something that size we use inserted drills that have replaceable cutting edges. Those chip even better.

mechanical_gifs,38ss2d,h0och,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:32:58 2015 UTC,"Overlock:       An overlock is a kind of stitch that sews over the edge of one or two pieces of cloth for edging, hemming, or seaming. Usually an overlock sewing machine will cut the edges of the cloth as they are fed through (such machines being called ""sergers"" in North America), though some are made without cutters. The inclusion of automated cutters allows overlock machines to create finished seams easily and quickly. An overlock sewing machine differs from a lockstitch sewing machine in that it uses loopers fed by multiple thread cones rather than a bobbin. Loopers serve to create thread loops that pass from the needle thread to the edges of the fabric so that the edges of the fabric are contained within the seam.    Image i - The purl stitch.

mechanical_gifs,388rkk,justanotherlongerni-,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:36:28 2015 UTC,"Ooh camming. Sorry I'm thinkin' about guns again...  An AR15 bolt carrier functions similarly, but in a short arc instead of a complete rev, and in the reverse: propellant gas strikes the carrier (black part going side to side) which cams the bolt rotationally (white part going circley) to unlock the breech.   I couldn't find an AR15 gif, but here is a k31, which is a straight-pull bolt action using manual force instead of gas pressure, to achieve a similar operation. The bolt handle, bottom, is moved rearward, camming the bolt body rotationally to lock/unlock the bolthead - far right. You can clearly see the lugs on the bolt head rotating, which lock into a recess in the reciever, taking the full pressure of the cartridge and preventing the bolt assembly from entering the shooter's face. Even on a standard bolt action which has bolt handle, face and lugs as one piece, the firing pin is cammed rearward when the bolt handle is turned upwards.  I'm sure rotational/linear cams have many other uses, but there's the one I know a little about.  PS I am neither an engineer or a gunsmith so please don't take any of this as gospel, especially the AR15 bit as they are banned in my country and I have never examined one in the flesh."

How does the saw know when it needs to stop?     SawStop Saws Detect Contact With Skin. The blade carries a small electrical signal, which the safety system continually monitors. When skin contacts the blade, the signal changes because the human body is conductive. The change to the signal activates the safety system.     This is why less conductive material like wooden 2x4s don't trigger the system, but conductive flesh such as fingers and adorable hotdogs do.  edit - why is this old post getting so much attention all of a sudden?

mechanical_gifs,389sq1,easye7,7,Mon Jun 15 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, you'll feel it.    The CEO of the Saw's company once gingerly crept his finger forward, barely touched the blade, and it stopped. He said it tickled.    If you're using the saw, you are effectively feeding your hand into the blade. I'd say you're looking at 1/16 of an inch, although I've heard 1/8 thrown around.

mechanical_gifs,37pdtj,Ima_nobody,177,Fri May 29 10:24:54 2015 UTC,it's a silage bale.  Hay is dried/wilted grass - baled 3-7 days after being cut depending on weather conditions. It is then left unwrapped in storage. It doesn't decompose in storage provided its kept dry. If it is stored wet or gets wet while being stored it rots.  Silage on the other hand is wrapped while still green/wet like in this gif - 1 or 2 days after being cut. The lack of air and the still respiring grass causes the silage to ferment and preserve - giving it the smell that /u/gurgaue mentioned

This is caused by the hay being bailed with too much mostiture content and then being stored with little air flow. To preven this the hay is either baled at a lower mostiure conent or stored with adequate ventilitation.    Usually this is a problem with square bales only, not round due to how tightly square bales are packed."

mechanical_gifs,37pdtj,trigisfun,2,Fri May 29 12:53:29 2015 UTC,We dry bale all our hay or put it in a tower solo so we don't use a lot of plastic. We do ag bag high moisture corn and that is a pain to deal with.
mechanical_gifs,37pdtj,eviloperator,1 point,Fri May 29 13:41:59 2015 UTC,Yeah we do tower silos too. I'd like to see an energy breakdown of various feed storage. Obviously it takes quite a bit of fuel to fill a silo and chop hay but on the other hand once the plastic is made and the bales are wrapped it takes hardly any fuel to feed them.
mechanical_gifs,37pdtj,gurgaue,2,Fri May 29 13:46:18 2015 UTC,"With traditional dry bailing the farmer needs to cut the hay, then go back through and spread the hay out, then take it back into rows and then bale it.   That is one way to do it.  It depends on the equipment you have and the moisture content of the hay.  If it is dry enough you don't have to invert it or rake after you've cut it with the mower conditioner.  You can just bale it.  Also, if you have high moisture content and still want to bale right away, you can use a hay preservative.  The applicator goes in the baler and the baler sensors can adjust how much preservative to apply."
mechanical_gifs,37pdtj,Oilfan94,1 point,Fri May 29 14:31:08 2015 UTC,How is this bad for the enviroment? You mean the plastic used? It's a really thin film and lets the bales be stored outside where as actual hay can't be because it would get wet.

But somehow I had never thought about canned beverages being filled like an open cup, and then they put the lid on and crimp it.   There's no other way to do it. And yet I had never thought about it being done this way. Maybe I just assumed they magically grew on trees, and were picked when ripe."

mechanical_gifs,37kdls,Guerdonian,8,Fri May 29 01:36:57 2015 UTC,"While this is a commonly used filler/canner in small breweries this is not how most beer is canned.  Big and mid-sized breweries like Seirra, New Belgium, Oskar blues, and of course the Mega breweries like AB-inbev and Coors use much more modern machinery.  Midsize brewery Oskar Blues:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbyNdp-t8YE  MEGA brewery example : https://youtu.be/mgBeTmqVo7k?t=10m8s"
mechanical_gifs,37kdls,limp_noodle,4,Thu May 28 15:05:48 2015 UTC,I wouldn't necessarily call the machine in the gif less modern. It's just a different machine for a different application. The throughput that requirements are just different.
mechanical_gifs,37kdls,Guerdonian,2,Thu May 28 17:46:43 2015 UTC,"Often times caners like the ones in the gif are converted soup can fillers, or from other industries.  The amount of time it takes from the can being filled to capped is crucial due to exposure to air (thus the foaming).  A lot of beer-specifically designed fillers minimize this exposure as much as possible, saving time, beer, and improving quality."
mechanical_gifs,37kdls,limp_noodle,1 point,Thu May 28 19:33:51 2015 UTC,"Ah yes that is true. Just like someone else in this thread said they were a Design ME in automation, I do the same thing.

mechanical_gifs,37kdls,Jrook,3,Tue Jun 2 11:33:30 2015 UTC,Makes me wonder how many cans are rejected from the top not properly laying on the foam
mechanical_gifs,37kdls,babyinfection,1 point,Thu May 28 11:54:04 2015 UTC,"Not many. The tops are washed and dried before being put into cases. Usually you get misfills towards the beginning while you calibrate the machine, but theres only about a case or two out of the 600 or so we do per run.  Interestingly enough, the easiest way to find misfills is to weigh them. A 16oz can should weigh just under 500 grams (once you factor in the can and lid itself)."

The simplest solution seems to be to connect the tip of one of the arms to the tongue (supposing the tongue can only slide on one axis). This means having a rotating joint at both sides of the connection. The head moves in the opposite direction, so the movement is almost doubled (and the arms are long so the base movement is amplified). But the initial angle might be too much if it is wood on wood. If it is oiled metal it could work. Not sure about oiled wood."

I kind of definitely knew that gyroscopes don't have to be sitting on a table to exert force and are often used inside things for stability but for some reason I still thought ""well, duh, of course it won't work, it's in a bo... oh."""
mechanical_gifs,36t4kx,oneonetwooneonetwo,14,Fri May 22 11:55:35 2015 UTC,To anyone else who didn't see it...the gyroscope is spinning inside of the box. Can't really see that on mobile. I was all looking for a string somewhere...
mechanical_gifs,36t4kx,benannas,8,Fri May 22 02:08:13 2015 UTC,That's neat but I can't figure out where the energy causing the box to move comes from!
mechanical_gifs,36t4kx,Caudheur,16,Thu May 21 22:53:23 2015 UTC,"The bearings on the gyroscope are not perfectly efficient.  The slight friction between the spinning element and the frame of the gyroscope causes the box to be 'dragged' along with it.  Because the friction is very minimal, it takes a second for the box to accelerate against the mass of the box and frame, the friction of its own cardboard point on the ground, and air resistance against the box.  EDIT:  Because air resistance and the friction between the box and ground increase with speed, the terminal rotational velocity of the box/frame will be considerably slower than the speed of the gyroscope element."
mechanical_gifs,36t4kx,vonHindenburg,1 point,Fri May 22 00:55:02 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for the explanation!
mechanical_gifs,36t4kx,Caudheur,2,Fri May 22 08:29:13 2015 UTC,It's the fact that the gyroscope is spinning in the opposite direction. It's the same as sitting in a spinny chair and trying to make it go in a circle without using your feet.
mechanical_gifs,36t4kx,nbd712,4,Fri May 22 00:35:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's hard to tell, but I think they're spinning in the same direction.  The gyroscope isn't 'pushing off' against the box.  If it had a tiny motor that was continuously powering it, this would be true.  but it was previously set spinning by an outside force and is merely maintaining its velocity.  As it is, I'm pretty sure that the box is spinning in the same direction.  Because the bearings aren't 100% efficient, some friction is applied to the frame of the gyroscope and through it to the box."
mechanical_gifs,36t4kx,vonHindenburg,6,Fri May 22 00:44:11 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that they're going in the same direction.  The spinning element of the gyroscope does exert a force on the frame (and box) and the frame resists that force.  But, the gyrscope is not pushing against the frame, but pulling it along through the friction in the bearings.  The mass of the frame, air resistance on the frame, and friction of the point of the frame against the ground pull back on the gyroscope, slowing it, and ultimately dragging it to a stop, but doesn't ever move in the opposite direction.    Think about the 'spinners' that you sometimes see on a car wheel.  When the car starts moving forward, they take a few seconds to accelerate to the speed of the wheel because the drag imparted on them through the bearing that connects them to the wheel of the car takes a few seconds to overcome their mass and the air resistance on them.  It's the same for the frame of the gyroscope.  Source:  Worked for several years as a buyer and analyst of bearing suppliers for a manufacturer of turbines, centrifugal compressors, and various other rotating equipment."
mechanical_gifs,36t4kx,vonHindenburg,2,Fri May 22 00:54:27 2015 UTC,"You've got to think about the acceleration instead of the velocity. The wheel spins in one direction, but because of friction, it decelerates. The frame outside accelerates in the direction that the wheel is spinning, opposite the direction in which it is accelerating, because it continues spinning in the same direction, but decelerates. So the frame and the wheel spin in the same direction.  Remember, force is related to acceleration (F=ma), not velocity."

With a footrest there and a backrest a few feet back, the operator could sit and push with his legs, generating a lot more power from a more comfortable position.

It is mostly used as a maintenance of way or mining car, but it was also used for passenger service in some cases. A typical design consists of an arm, called the walking beam, that pivots, seesaw-like, on a base, which the passengers alternately push down and pull up to move the car.

mechanical_gifs,361yls,Cley_Faye,11,Fri May 15 12:47:29 2015 UTC,"If it's strong enough, inertia would probably do the other half."
mechanical_gifs,361yls,TrapDetector,5,Fri May 15 13:09:13 2015 UTC,"This seems to be more efficient on one side than the other, yet in movies you always see two people operating them. Why is that?"
mechanical_gifs,361yls,vonHindenburg,5,Fri May 15 15:35:18 2015 UTC,"You are correct that an operator could get more power, on the cart shown, when standing to the rear and facing the direction of travel (whichever way that happened to be at the moment.)  Two things make this true.  The first is that a person, pumping up and down on a lever, generates a lot more thrust pushing down than he does pulling back up.  The second is the placement of the crank gear.  You can see that it is on the opposite side of the fulcrum from where the piston rod attaches to the lever on top.  This means that the mechanism operates with varying efficiency throughout its cycle.  When the gear is in a position where the crank is more nearly directly below the attachment point on the lever, it will transmit power most efficiently.   Thus, if you watch the cycle, you can see that this happens when a person standing at the back of the car, facing forward would be pushing down.  (Whichever way ‘forward is at that time.)  If the crank gear was placed directly below the attachment point on the lever, power delivery would be symmetrical.  So why a second person?  Because it delivers more power and smoother power.  Getting one of these started was a real pain, particularly if the lever on the side on which you want to stand is down.  (Check out the movie “The General” by Buster Keaton.)  A second person, who has their power stroke opposite the first operator, delivers consistent power throughout the cycle.    This is analogous to the pistons on a steam engine.  As opposed to those in a car, which only push in one direction, depending on momentum to push them back up, steam pistons are ‘double acting’ with steam admitted to either side of the cylinder in turn, pushing and pulling, and delivering more and smoother power out of a smaller package."
mechanical_gifs,361yls,Deltigre,0,Fri May 15 18:15:30 2015 UTC,"It isn't more efficient, the torque is how far each end is from the fulcrum, not how far from the other load. A lever with the load on the same side is just as efficient a torque multiplier as one with the load on the opposite side.  This isn't intended to be patronizing - I slacked off and didn't do it for the longest time - but if you haven't already and you're interested in mechanical objects... I'd recommend taking a basic high school or college physics class."

mechanical_gifs,34bo1e,thesausageprince,2,Thu Apr 30 03:53:33 2015 UTC,Why do they make casings out of brass then? Why not opt for a cheaper malleable metal?
mechanical_gifs,34bo1e,OmniaMors,6,Thu Apr 30 20:21:15 2015 UTC,"So you can but you lose some performance.  Brass is able to simultaneously be malleable at the lip (to form a seal like a gasket) and hard at the base (so it doesn't, you know, explode). Which done with different metal working methods.  Other alternatives exist with trade offs. Steel cases are very common (and they do not damage your gun, thats a myth!!!) But they dont form as nice a seal and can't be reloaded. Plastic cases tend to be difficult, its a fine line between total failure and functional making them riskier. More complex metal alloys are mores expensive.  But going back a bit, reloading is super important. Some do it to save costs (which doesn't actually save a lot unless you use a progressive or automatic reloading press). But the bigger case is specialty ammunition. Long range shooters develop loads specific to their gun based on a scientific method or trial and error.  Competitive pistol shooters might adapt it for accuracy but they can work with power or speed. In most (if not all) pistol competitions there are advantages to having a more powerful round, they get graded into either major or minor ""power factors"". Many shooters will over/under load a cartridge so they are just barely in the major PF. This way they have the major PF advantage but with the lease recoil and sometimes more magazine capacity."

My guess is that it is a product promotion/demonstration, and that a seeder would be either attached to the end of the machine, or another pass would be made with a seeder, although that would be quite inefficient and would likely require a special tractor with narrow tires to not destroy the rows."

mechanical_gifs,3417rp,littlegolferboy,5,Mon Apr 27 16:57:04 2015 UTC,Having played a fair bit of the Farming Simulator games it's interesting to see the ridge marker in use. In the game it doesn't really matter if you're not perfectly lined up but here you obviously want to get the spacing right.
mechanical_gifs,3417rp,nero4983,2,Mon Apr 27 17:58:48 2015 UTC,Fellow FS player here.  Do you know what the frick that red thing is for that's tilling soil off to the side? I assume it's meant to make a line for the tractor to follow during its next pass but I've never messed with it enough to find out.
mechanical_gifs,3417rp,littlegolferboy,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:08:27 2015 UTC,Apparently yes
mechanical_gifs,3417rp,OneEyedPlankton,1 point,Tue Apr 28 08:48:54 2015 UTC,Yeah that's the ridge marker I was talking about. I rarely use it in the game because I have a mod that will show lines on the ground at the exact width of my implement so I just use that to line it up.
mechanical_gifs,3417rp,ImThaBean,5,Tue Apr 28 13:13:48 2015 UTC,I wonder what the red rod is doing being dragged along the left side.  Makes me think they follow that line on the next pass to properly align the ridges.
mechanical_gifs,3417rp,OneEyedPlankton,3,Mon Apr 27 22:43:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. Its the tractors center for the next set of rows. As such, the operator will lift the left and drop the right for the next pass."

White asparagus is the result of applying a blanching technique while the asparagus shoots are growing. Compared to green asparagus, the locally cultivated so-called ""white gold"" or ""edible ivory"" asparagus, also referred to as ""the royal vegetable"",  is less bitter and much more tender.

Like if the center drive has a furnace of some sort mounted on it and parts were mounted to the widget in a specific order but had to be heat treated inbetween. Allows you to have one furnace instead of 3.  Or if you don't like the furnace idea you could imagine a spray coating of paint or protection in the main chamber, and the rotation is used to prevent uneven buildup."

mechanical_gifs,33eq8r,ClaudioRules,30,Tue Apr 21 23:29:01 2015 UTC,Here's an explanation of how it works from the manufacturer's website.
mechanical_gifs,33eq8r,5710,15,Tue Apr 21 23:38:02 2015 UTC,"This is my bet.  You can see how they ""snap"" into position = due to magnets."
mechanical_gifs,33eq8r,Derkek,7,Tue Apr 21 23:38:21 2015 UTC,"There's a rig attached go the steering (the classic Mythbusters self-guided steering assembly) except with a magnet at the front instead of a tow cable.   This magnet follows a steel wire hidden in the track.   To stop and start the vehicle, other magnets affect a Reed switch, turning the vehicle on or off on the road."

mechanical_gifs,33eq8r,Captrotc,4,Wed Apr 22 02:22:44 2015 UTC,Going off of this link  When they pass over the train tracks you can see the little magnet that follows the wire embedded into the road.   The little magnet attached to the car turns the wheels similar to how it would work in real life.

mechanical_gifs,33eq8r,maximumhamburgers,2,Wed Apr 22 13:13:38 2015 UTC,why inductive? two metal contacts on the underside of the vehicle would be enough. It could drive to a depot and stop there while being connected through the contacts.  no need for complicated and expensive inductive charging
mechanical_gifs,33eq8r,B0rax,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:05:30 2015 UTC,"I was hoping to keep the road as clean as possible. Metal contacts would be much cheaper and more efficient, but you'd want to hide them someplace out of sight or need to find a way to theme them. Perhaps you could hide charging strips in sections of the layout which would allow vehicles to pick up a bit of charge as they go."
mechanical_gifs,33eq8r,TwistedFMJ,7,Wed Apr 22 18:35:40 2015 UTC,The contacts to charge are actually their mirrors. A Video (german with english subtitles) how its done in Miniatur Wunderland Hamburg  shows it really nicely

mechanical_gifs,337weh,blamb211,31,Mon Apr 20 18:45:05 2015 UTC,"I only asked so I wasn't writing this up for nobody.  This gif shows two distinct systems, first the trigger assembly, then the bolt locking mechanism.  The former exists because you need to wait to release the hammer. if it was just floated with a spring it would hug the bolt like a cam, which would prevent it from accelerating freely, which would prevent it from gaining the velocity it needs to break the primer. To do this the hammer is held back by two different pieces, the trigger, so it only fires when the operator wants it to, and the sear, so it wont be released until the bolt locks. You can see in the first half of the gif when the round fires, the hammer is reset by the bolt, but it doesn't get released again until the bolt relocks, moving the sear out of the way.  The latter system exists so racking the gun isn't impossible. Originally, guns would just use the opposite force of the cartridge going off the push the bolt back. This caused problems because it A) requires a MASSIVE spring to slow down, B) a lot of energy is lost since it releases gas early, C) casings were damaged from the air escaping. So to solve this, the bolt rotates to lock into place. After the gun fires, a little gas is redirected from the barrel to push a piston which rotates the bolt via a cam, then pushes it back. Once moving rearward it pulls the old casing out via an extractor, and throws it out via the ejector. Then it resets the hammer as it hits the back, and racks a new round as it moves forward. The forward movement is powered by a spring which actually pushes the same piston. This way it pushes the bolt closed and rotates it via the same cam locking it into place."

mechanical_gifs,335xcx,adogsfanclub,25,Mon Apr 20 00:16:01 2015 UTC,"Why?  One of the big advantages of mechanizing this having very few ways for contamination to get into basins like this. Keep the ice cream clean as it should be via similar mechanization, the injected chocolate clean as it should be, the air clean, and test occasionally, why would you need to clean it all that often?  Cleaning agents can add more contamination then they remove.  The most I would worry about is metal shavings from rubbing parts and that can be handled in a number of ways."

mechanical_gifs,32ul7y,Margravos,5,Fri Apr 17 05:00:00 2015 UTC,I don't think vertical would work at all. It's a pushing things along a tube machine.  I'd think you'd use some kind of stepped conveyor or a bucket lift if you wanted to actually anything.

mechanical_gifs,32ul7y,OrwellStonecipher,2,Fri Apr 17 14:34:41 2015 UTC,I don't think so because it's not sealed or tight around the edges.  A bucket lift would be better than that.

mechanical_gifs,32ul7y,bmcnult19,2,Fri Apr 17 20:38:33 2015 UTC,Doesn't seem very different from a roller-chain conveyor. What problems do you see with this setup?
mechanical_gifs,32ul7y,oneonetwooneonetwo,4,Fri Apr 17 00:44:03 2015 UTC,It's it for portioning? Because the gaps in the side and bottom would make it inexact. The curve of the tube makes the fall unpredictable unless it's going into a large funnel. A roller driven belt conveyer seems to have way less parts. That whole chain get-up looks custom made where the belts are more or less just made to size.   This whole thing just seems so unnecessary.

Caseless ammunition is an attempt to reduce the weight and cost of ammunition by dispensing with the case, which is typically precision made of brass or steel, as well as to simplify the operation of repeating firearms by eliminating the need to extract and eject the empty case after firing.  Its acceptance has been hampered by problems with heat sensitivity, sealing, and fragility. Its use to date has been limited to prototypes and low-powered firearms.

I'd go for a locking lug on the front of the bolt that slides into place just as it fires and isn't rigidly connected to the rest of the bolt carrier to avoid damage to the cam and follower. Relatedly, why not just use a second cam and follower for the firing pin, have the follower drop off a little cliff, then spiral back up."

You are simply not going to make a camtrack that can take the amount of abuse in less than an 1/16th of an inch of contact area backed by a ball bearing cam follower that two locking lugs with at least 5 times the contact area and backed up by 1/2 inch or more of solid steel can. Also, you're idea only removes two parts, the lugged bolt carrier and the track that rotates it. The rest of the moving parts are still required, you still need an extractor and ejector and you still need a firing pin and firing pin release."
mechanical_gifs,32b91y,bs1110101,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:44:06 2015 UTC,"My idea would replace the cam track, ether using a heavy roller that takes up the back side of the bolt, or a locking lug on the front of the bolt that would slide into place, making the cam not need to hold pressure. And true, it removes only one or two parts per barrel, i was counting all six though. And about the firing pin, my idea is to have it pulled back and released by another cam, instead of seemingly cocking as the bolt is brought back."
mechanical_gifs,32b91y,ItIsOneCrazyWorld,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:15:59 2015 UTC,"My idea would replace the cam track, ether using a heavy roller that takes up the back side of the bolt.       I don't think you understand how this works, it already has a heavy roller, that's what a cam follower is, it's in the picture (since we're assuming these are 20mm rounds the cam follower is about an inch in diameter). The cam track isn't pictured, it is a slot whose curvature is kinda like a roller coaster and moves the cam follower in and out to slide the bolt carrier forward and backward. They look like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5--XwKmGX1M Except that the camtrack in one of theses guns is a groove on the inside of a housing that goes around what's in OP's gif.  The track is stationary as the barrels rotate and the track zig zags in and out for closing the bolt and extracting expended rounds, causing the follwers to move the bolts in and out as seen in the gif..    or a locking lug on the front of the bolt that would slide into place   It already has locking lugs that rotate into place, and a slider would just be a different, and less efficient, piece for doing the same thing as the moving part it is replacing.       instead of seemingly cocking as the bolt is brought back.        It isn't, the firing pin is caught and cocked when the bolts slide forward and is released by the rotating bolt at the end of its rotation.     Like I said, I don't think you really understand what goes on in this thing."

mechanical_gifs,32b5ws,Clay_Statue,6,Sun Apr 12 08:31:23 2015 UTC,"It's a belt-driven screw compressor (positive-displacement superhcarger). It sucks air from the inlet end, into the screw rotors, compresses it internally, and outputs the compressed air out the other end and into the intake manifold. The purpose of a supercharger is to provide air to the engine at greater than atmospheric pressure.

mechanical_gifs,32b5ws,PandaHammer,9,Sun Apr 12 09:03:40 2015 UTC,"Close, this is a belt driven air compressor itself, which forces more oxygen into the engine.  A turbo charger is a turbine driven by the exhaust from an engine."

As far as modelling tools go, they're all very much the same general idea, and it's just a case of knowing the tool names and interface. I started on Max, moved to Maya and found it much more elegant and modern (Max is derived from an Atari program...), and then learned some C4D and found it even fresher, but with less tools than either of the former.

mechanical_gifs,31lei5,meccano300,5,Mon Apr 6 23:57:51 2015 UTC,"Super not even close. Glocks are hammerless and operate just on that springed firing pin so that the trigger pull always feels the same.  See how the barrel moves down to the magazine? that's unique to glocks, most other pistols will use a fixed barrel and have a feeder ramp that leads bullets up as the slide catches them.  There's a pretty wide variance on handgun operating systems, there's stuff like the Mauser C96 http://img-new.cgtrader.com/items/66560/mauser_c96_broomhandle_3d_model_3ds_c4d_lwo_lw_lws_mtl_c8a93b30-79af-40b5-8555-799a837d5a0b.jpg  which is closer to a downsized semi auto rifle than a handgun.  There's obviously the luger that has a unique toggle mechanism that cycles the barrel http://i.imgur.com/9LV9HTX.gif  And there was an unusual pistol posted somewhere that used gas to move the slide forward instead of back. It was a US army prototype from perhaps the 30's? I can't find a gif of it but it was odd, ultimately went nowhere but I hear it's a grail gun for people who are into unique mechanisms."

mechanical_gifs,31lei5,Tamer_,11,Tue Apr 7 02:41:12 2015 UTC,"I love this gif but I always feel like its lacking some seriously important information.     The basic premise of a semiautomatic is to use the reaction of propelling the bullet to cycle the gun. Now in its most primitive form that mean using the blowback to push the slide back. This has some seriously issues though. For starters, it will have a super heavy spring, since its just the force of the spring keeping the slide locked in battery. On top of that you get performance issues from gasses escaping early (since it opens up instantly), and your brass gets deformed from not being held in well. Gun gurus fixed this by having it so that the gun locks in battery for a little bit before opening up.     This gun in particular is a Glock, my guess is the 19, a full sized 9mm para model, but I could be wrong. (I owned the 26, the sub compact 9mm, great gun, but it didn't fit my taste). First look at the top of the barrel where it meets the slide. You see a slot in the slide where the barrel fits it, its actually locked with the slide right now. This way when the gun fires the barrel and slide move backwards together. They stay locked in battery fixing the problems we had before.     Now look right below the barrel, you see that weird hook. As the barrel/slide move back, it hooks on the catch below which rotates the back of the barrel down. As this happens it is no longer in that aforementioned slot and actually stopped from moving back. This lets the slide move farther back without the barrel and cycle the gun (reloading, reset the striker etc). That hook on the bottom is engineered to time the gun perfectly. If they want to move to a heavier firing gun they might move it back so more pressure can release before unlocking.     Source: Engineer and Gun Nerd"

Manufacture of article  Hockey puck:       NHL regulation pucks were not required for professional play until the 1990–91 season, but were standardized for consistent play and ease of manufacture half a century earlier, by Art Ross, in 1940.  Major manufacturers of pucks exist in Canada, Russia, the Czech Republic, the People's Republic of China,  [better source needed] and Slovakia.   The list of former or present-day major producers includes   In Glas Co. Viceroy Sher-Wood Gufex  Rubena  Vegum Dolné Vestenice  Converse HockeyShot Spalding Xiamen Yin Hua Silicone Rubber Products Co., Ltd. Xiamen Deng Hong Silica Gel Product Co., Ltd. Xiamen Ijetech Industry & Trade Co. Ltd   The black rubber of the puck is made up of a mix of natural rubber, antioxidants, bonding materials and other chemicals to achieve a balance of hardness and resilience.  This mixture is then turned in a machine with metal rollers, where workers add extra natural rubber, and ensure that the mixing is even. Samples are then put into a machine that analyzes if the rubber will harden at the right temperature. An automated apparatus, called a pultrusion machine,  extrudes the rubber into long circular logs that are 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter and then cut into 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick pieces while still soft. These pre-forms are then manually put into moulds that are the exact size of a finished puck.  There are up to 200 mould cavities per moulding palette, capable of producing up to 5,000 pucks per week.  The moulds are then compressed. This compression may be done cold  or with the moulds heated to 300 °F (149 °C) for 18 minutes,  depending on the proprietary methods of the manufacturer. They come out hard and then are allowed to sit for 24 hours. Each puck is manually cleaned with a trimmer machine to remove excess rubber. The molding process adds a diamond cross-hatch texture around the edge of the puck for more friction between the stick and puck for better control and puck handling.   The practice pucks are made by a similar but faster process that uses larger pre-forms, 4–5 in (10–13 cm) thick, puts them into molds automatically, and applies more pressure and heat over a shorter period of time to compress the puck into the standard size. This allows approximately twice as many pucks to be manufactured in the same time period as the more exacting production of NHL regulation pucks. People sometimes freeze pucks to prevent them from sticking to the ice.      Interesting: Apple USB Mouse | FoxTrax | Bubble Tape   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

If one of the slots of the driven wheel is occluded, the number of rotations the drive wheel can make is limited. In watches, the ""drive"" wheel is the one that winds up the spring, and the Geneva wheel with four or five spokes and one closed slot prevents overwinding (and also complete unwinding) of the spring. This so-called Geneva stop or ""Geneva stop work"" was the invention of 17th or 18th century watchmakers.""

mechanical_gifs,30cgn5,OfficialCocaColaAMA,2,Thu Mar 26 21:50:57 2015 UTC,"It depends. I was working on a piece if hardened steel on a lathe, and it got so hot that the lubricant would go tssss and smoke off. Picking them up is impossible, we use some pliars or let it cool in the chip basket. Our Mini Mill had a lubricant/coolant pump, and even then parts come out pretty warm.   It depends on the material, basically. And how long your doing it, plus speed of the tool, speed of the part, direction your cutting vs direction the tool is spinning, all of those things. But normally, without lubricant or coolant, even simple things get hot enough that you don't want to touch them.

The second program turns it into tool motions, like from ""I wanna make a block"" to ""with this raw material and this bit, move to these coordinates at this rate.""  A good machinist will always do rough cuts, which is the steps you mean. Its a lot less stressful on the tool and the part. It takes longer but you get a nice finish, a less destroyed tool and a part with stronger finish."
mechanical_gifs,30cgn5,OmniaMors,3,Thu Mar 26 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"A good machinist will always do rough cuts, which is the steps you mean.   I've also only done manual machining, but I learned recently that a modern way of programming CNC machines with high speed machining is that instead of doing rough cuts and then finish cuts, the toolpaths are designed for more or less constant chip load for the entire machining operation -- this means that you can often use the same tool for roughing and finishing (minimizing tool changes which are 'dead time' as far as productivity goes) and tool life often improves because its always being run at its sweet spot. It's a really interesting way of thinking about machining if, like me, you've always done it as roughing and finishing passes."

It is normally ""g-code"", which is pretty much a little g exerpt (like g32 for a random example) followed by coordinates. The coordinates can be in relative or absolute, absolute being what you normally use in school (having the little axis with 0 someplace, and everything is based off of that) and relative meaning that each points coordinate is based off the last, and not the ""0"" point that you set. Anyway, you have to manually type in all this code, with each coordinate, for every pass of every axis, tool type, speed, feed, everything. Most programs, as you said like solid works, can do this automatically, though plenty of things still need someone to design the cutting route for the part.

mechanical_gifs,2z9lj1,RespectMyAuthoriteh,27,Mon Mar 16 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I could hear the sound of this in my head the second I opened the gif.  I took a temp job at a factory when when I needed a summer job.  There were about 6 massive Trumatic punch presses that ran all day long.  You couldn't hear anything over that noise.  I would literally hear the rhythmic punching sound in my dreams.  They would also have me man those some days (not set up but just bang out and stack the parts and feed new steel sheets in).  I always had no fucking clue what I was doing because it was too loud to really get trained well and the managers didn't give a shit about me... I'm just very glad I never got injured and super grateful to not be working in a factory ever again."
mechanical_gifs,2z9lj1,nahreddit,11,Mon Mar 16 23:15:14 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of my short time spent working in a factory. I didn't really know who exactly my supervisor was but an Asian guy who didn't really speak much English would usually set me up on whatever I was working on that day, albeit with very little verbal instruction and mostly just demonstrating.

mechanical_gifs,2z9lj1,TheGreatAntlers,4,Tue Mar 17 03:26:33 2015 UTC,"It hits it from both sides, so if you're to stack two small cups together but the metal is between the two.  The tooling is created so when the die and punch meet it doesn't shear the metal but actually just deforms it."

mechanical_gifs,2z9lj1,TheGreatAntlers,3,Tue Mar 17 16:05:00 2015 UTC,We have a few automated punches. The ones that move the head instead of the sheet do better when you are dealing with louvers knock-outs or bends that can snag on the table or head.

mechanical_gifs,2z9lj1,ewoco,1 point,Wed May 20 16:49:11 2015 UTC,What's the benefit of such advanced multi-purpose (expensive) machine over multiple classic machines?
mechanical_gifs,2z9lj1,brtt3000,2,Thu May 21 18:50:17 2015 UTC,"Space and time.  The footprint of 1 Trupunch is about 30' x 50', and it is fed a pallet of sheet metal and it shoots out parts that are ready to head to the powder coating line.  Each tool head holds 30 separate tools, so in a sense our machine is able to perform 300 different operations with its 10 tool heads.  The driving factor here is volume.  If the volume of parts isn't high enough this machine is no where near justified."

mechanical_gifs,2zb2nu,protomor,3,Tue Mar 17 13:05:33 2015 UTC,Is this just a variation on VTEC?
mechanical_gifs,2zb2nu,TheApothecaryAus,8,Wed Mar 18 00:30:08 2015 UTC,"Infinitely variable lift and duration vs a two set amounts of lift.  The benefits are probably small, but they're likely there."
mechanical_gifs,2zb2nu,totally_rocks,3,Wed Mar 18 00:36:27 2015 UTC,"One of the supposed advantages of valvetronic is that adjustment of valve lift can take the place of a conventional throttle. The idea is that this reduces pumping losses at low loads (presumably because air flowing past a part-open throttle blade and a set of completely open valves is worse than just flowing past partially open valves?), supposedly leading to higher efficiency.  http://www.bmw.com/com/en/insights/technology/technology_guide/articles/mm_valvetronic.html"
mechanical_gifs,2zb2nu,asad137,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:58:58 2015 UTC,"I knew that may be physically possible, but I didn't think it was employed that way due to legal reasons.  I thought a car had to have a two springs, each capable of closing the throttle, as a redundancy.  I don't know if such a fail safe would be possible with this system."
mechanical_gifs,2zb2nu,totally_rocks,3,Wed Mar 18 11:52:24 2015 UTC,BMW say on the website I linked (if you expand the text) that they use a traditional throttle for redundancy -- presumably it's always open when the car is operating normally.

mechanical_gifs,2zb2nu,TheApothecaryAus,5,Wed Mar 18 00:46:15 2015 UTC,Honda's operates at min/max.  BMW's is variable.

mechanical_gifs,2z6h7r,herenorthere26,19,Mon Mar 16 00:23:19 2015 UTC,Can someone explain the utility of this gear setup?
mechanical_gifs,2z6h7r,yurie_nater,16,Mon Mar 16 00:55:28 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine that it's useful for anything more than looking pretty. Or, according to OP, demonstrating a mechanical principle."
mechanical_gifs,2z6h7r,Rileybrains,6,Mon Mar 16 01:22:01 2015 UTC,"here's the source But it just says that the film presents a deceptively ""open"" series of images of gears and pistons that transfer movement from vertical to rotary directions"
mechanical_gifs,2z6h7r,CraftyChameleonKing,8,Mon Mar 16 01:30:09 2015 UTC,"I imagine it reduces chatter, much like a helical gear. http://imgur.com/jjGTPdA  The grooves come in contact with each other more gradually, thus reducing the noise they make."
mechanical_gifs,2z6h7r,FoxtrotZero,4,Mon Mar 16 04:25:51 2015 UTC,"Nah, the gears aren't meshing any differently than a regular gear set. It's like if you had a really wide gear, and sliced it at an angle. The teeth are unchanged, it's just the shape of the gears they're wrapped around."
mechanical_gifs,2z6h7r,CraftyChameleonKing,1 point,Mon Mar 16 21:31:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I realized shortly after posting :/ - the teeth are unchanged
mechanical_gifs,2z6h7r,ItsADanThing,3,Mon Mar 16 21:42:35 2015 UTC,It is almost certainly just a proof-of-concept/visual demonstration. The gears are elliptical however they have a constant 1:1 gear ratio because of how they are mated.   It could reduce chatter or have some other purpose but realistically they would not be practical; the extra machining cost (the teeth change directions over the edge of the gear) would make it much more practical to just get a high precision gear of a more traditional style.
mechanical_gifs,2z6h7r,The_Dirty_Carl,6,Mon Mar 16 14:52:17 2015 UTC,How?
mechanical_gifs,2z6h7r,cakedestroyer,14,Mon Mar 16 01:35:46 2015 UTC,"It doesn't, the power of gear is dependent on it's torque, which is defined by the distance between the exerting force and the axis of rotation. This set up would not save any space vertically, and in fact would only waste space horizontally."
mechanical_gifs,2z6h7r,branman1228,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:06:49 2015 UTC,Rather than being taller it is wider. It doesn't necessarily take up less total space but it takes up less space in a single direction.
mechanical_gifs,2z6h7r,tooyoung_tooold,-1,Mon Mar 16 02:26:22 2015 UTC,I think because the gears are slanted instead of connecting in a straight line it doesn't take up as much room.
mechanical_gifs,2z6h7r,MotoFox,10,Mon Mar 16 02:11:01 2015 UTC,"But then the gears could be smaller, except straight, and have the exact same effect."
mechanical_gifs,2z6h7r,RamblingGiraffe,0,Mon Mar 16 02:12:15 2015 UTC,that is true. I actually did think about that. I am not an engineer (although it has been a hidden dream) I am a simple communications major.

I know that it looks really cool and I know that it looks like it's doing an amazing job - which is it - but when it comes to fine tuning a set-up, whomever did the work on this truck, didn't tune the suspension correctly for ideal performance in this section, at the speed the truck is travelling.

If you haven't watched long way down its worth watching, Charlie borman did the dakar rally and at one point explains what its like when the trucks come from behind, (the bikes are released before trucks) I can't completely remember but it sounded fairly terrifying. I believe in fifth gear they did a test of the f650 dakar in full dakar trim vs the x5 in full dakar trim with tiff nedel behind the wheel, bare in mind tiff isn't and off road driver. The bike JUST beat the bike. I'm not knocking bikes at all, on the street there isn't much that can beat even a medium powered bike out there but on the track unfortunately a lot of the advantage is played to the cars."

mechanical_gifs,2vxdjt,Circumspector,12,Sun Feb 15 00:51:30 2015 UTC,"Having held a p90, I can tell you that they were not designed with large people in mind. When I say that it's compact, it is compact in the very realest sense of the word."
mechanical_gifs,2vxdjt,Blue_Ryder,12,Sun Feb 15 01:19:52 2015 UTC,How do these things not jam every other shot.  Is it just gravity and curve inside the gun that keeps the ammo spinning into position?
mechanical_gifs,2vxdjt,derb,15,Sun Feb 15 01:26:44 2015 UTC,There is a spring at the end of the magazine that provides the force to keep the rounds channelling through the system.
mechanical_gifs,2vxdjt,sudoscientistagain,8,Sun Feb 15 01:51:06 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the channel that the rounds spin around in is tapered around the bullet and notched for the rim of the cartridges to keep it from slipping and sliding all over, but that's probably wrong."
mechanical_gifs,2vxdjt,The_Dirty_Carl,9,Sun Feb 15 01:34:04 2015 UTC,"You're right, the rounds travel through a spiral groove that doesn't allow them to move in any other way."
mechanical_gifs,2vxdjt,Ziazan,1 point,Sun Feb 15 02:39:40 2015 UTC,There'll be a spring in the magazine? Otherwise how would the bullets in the mag be coming forwards?

mechanical_gifs,2vxdjt,dghughes,1 point,Sun Feb 15 20:35:34 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing it seems needlessly complex I can't see the advantage other than making it compact but that doesn't seem worth the complexity and risk of jamming.

The P90 is a weapon of war, it is made to Kill... your enemy.""   Really they made it out to be more gun than it is. I'm no expert, but isn't it just a re-working of a pistol so army engineers and mechanics could carry something at least a little gutsy without it being in the way. It was never intended to be a frontline platform. I read somewhere that stargate used them, because the ar15 became impossible to find after the war in Iraq Started. They were relatively cheap, easy to find and modify, and looked bitchin. Never mind they were never made to work against armor. The Jaffa's armor must be made out of balsa wood and tin cans."
mechanical_gifs,2vxdjt,BloodyLlama,14,Sun Feb 15 03:56:40 2015 UTC,"The P90 uses the 5.7x28 cartridge, which is basically a small rifle cartridge and was actually designed to defeat armor.  It is definitely not the same as a pistol.  Edit: And it's a bullpup. It's useful for carrying in vehicles, but I think the design intention is more of clearing rooms and such.  A lot of militaries around the world use it."
mechanical_gifs,2vxdjt,autowikibot,3,Sun Feb 15 07:30:57 2015 UTC,"FN Five-seven:       The FN Five-seven, trademarked as the Five-seveN, is a semi-automatic pistol designed and manufactured by Fabrique Nationale d’Armes de Guerre-Herstal (FN Herstal) in Belgium.  The pistol is named for its 5.7-mm (.224 in) bullet diameter, and the trademark capitalization style is intended to emphasize the manufacturer's initials—FN.   The Five-seven pistol was developed in conjunction with the FN P90 personal defense weapon and the FN 5.7×28mm cartridge.  The P90 was introduced in 1990, and the Five-seven was introduced in 1998 as a pistol using the same 5.7×28mm ammunition.  Developed as a companion pistol to the P90, the Five-seven shares many of its design features: it is a lightweight polymer-based weapon with a large magazine capacity, ambidextrous controls, low recoil, and the ability to penetrate body armor when using certain cartridge types.   Sales of the Five-seven were originally restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers, but since 2004, the pistol has also been offered to civilian shooters for personal protection, target shooting, and similar uses.   Although offered only with sporting ammunition, the Five-seven's introduction to civilian shooters was met with vocal opposition from gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign, and the pistol has been subject to ongoing controversy in the United States.    The Five-seven is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations, including Canada, France, Greece, India, Poland, Spain, and the United States.  In the United States, the Five-seven is in use with numerous law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service.   In the years since the pistol's introduction to the civilian market in the United States, it has also become increasingly popular with civilian shooters.

mechanical_gifs,2vxdjt,BloodyLlama,1 point,Sun Feb 15 21:51:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, and the point of it is that it is more effective, especially against armor, than a conventional pistol."

You've got to admit though, it was really well suited for Stargate with it's modern looking frame and unconventional design. It really does look like it was lifted straight out of the future."
mechanical_gifs,2vxdjt,stuffandorthings,6,Mon Feb 16 01:12:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was editing that in when you posted. They chose it almost exclusively because it had blank ammo available, it looked ""spacey"", and it had the rails you could bolt anything to. Be it light, scope, or dollar store laser pointer dressed up as an anti-macguffin weapon addon.   Really if the snakes had duct taped phone books to the jaffa, the P90 wouldn't have been terribly effective. Could be wrong, all I know is from wikipedia."

mechanical_gifs,2vxdjt,Redsetter,3,Sun Feb 15 04:24:01 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but isn't it just a re-working of a pistol...   I'm no expert either, but that is true of a traditional SMG and the P90 is more of a PDW. Typically a SMG fires a pistol round and they struggle against personal armour. PDWs like the P90 and the MP7 fire specifically created rounds that are like short cased assault rifle rounds. They are small, but fast enough to penetrate armour. FN then put their 5.7mm PDW round into a pistol they called the five seven.  Given all the dinky assault rifles around these days PDWs and their unusual ammunition have not caught on widely."

But something to note with the Steam version (and the mobile versions might be the same way, but I don't know for sure) is that you either have to pay money to unlock the guns (except for the first one), or you have to go on every day to do the stupid ""quiz"" thing until you have enough points to buy all the models. (Also you get some points if you get as many achievements as you can on each gun)  There are also certain guns that can only be bought with ""credits"" which you need to pay money for, OR if you get the top score of the day with a certain gun in one of the ""game"" modes, you get one credit.  Not really a great model IMO, and for a long time you'll be stuck with very few guns, but if you enjoy doing the same thing over and over in one half of your screen while watching videos in the other half, then it isn't too bad.

This engine may have had other applications, but due to its extreme weight (5,400 kg (11,900 lb)), it would have been limited to ground or naval applications.  A German tractor pulling team designed a vehicle, named ""Dragon Fire"", around a methanol-fueled version of this engine;  this modified  engine is said to weigh 3,200 kg (7,100 lb) including the gearbox, for use in the 5.4 ton tractor pulling class, making 8,000 hp (6,000 kW) at 2,500 rpm.

mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,AP2S2K,13,Mon Feb 9 00:43:42 2015 UTC,"Oh good, maybe you can help me.   I have a rack and pinion setup on my cnc table, and I'm trying to figure out if I have 14.5° or 20° pressure angle components. I don't have a gear pitch gauge of any kind, but can I take a macro picture of the gear tooth and import it to SketchUp and measure some part of the gear's geometry to determine the pressure angle?"
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,KBTrumpeteer,14,Mon Feb 9 01:14:50 2015 UTC,"Not the OP, but I'll try to give two options. Take a look at these photos.  Option 1: Take the photo, model it in SketchUp, draw the horizontal line and the line of action, then measure the pressure angle.  Option 2: Measure the rack circular pitch (pc), and whole depth (top of tooth to base), using the chart in picture 3, solve for the various pitches using the whole depth expressions, and compare that to your measured pitch.  I think either option will work but I would prefer the second one. Depending on your skill in SketchUp, you might find option 1 to be useful too.  Edit: Measure the circular pitch, and then find pitch (P) using     P = pi/pc"
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,AP2S2K,2,Mon Feb 9 02:47:22 2015 UTC,"In addition to those, if you have a small enough protractor you could measure the pressure engle directly on the rack teeth."
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,greenroom628,3,Mon Feb 9 04:37:05 2015 UTC,"i'm not sure how SketchUp works, but it'd be hard to do without a gear pitch gauge.  are there any markings on the gear you can look up?"
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,mover_of_bridges,3,Mon Feb 9 02:18:51 2015 UTC,"Mechanical engineer here:  On a standard rack tooth, the faces of the gear tooth are both straight (no involute curve) and angled at the pressure angle.  If you have an optical comparator, pop the rack in there and measure the inclination of the rack and there's your pressure angle.  Option 2 is to measure the chordal tooth thickness at different addenda and calculate out the pressure angle with trig.  Use a depth mic to measure the depth of a pair of caliper jaws that are appropriately sized to get in between the tooth space.  Then, stack up some gage blocks to get a measurement at a known height from the tip of the tooth.  Repeat this at at least one other known depth, and calculate out the pressure angle from that.  I would take a third midpoint measurement if there is any uncertainty.  If you have a gear tooth caliper, it makes the option 2 above much easier to perform.  Machinery's Handbook has good basic information on taking chordal tooth measurements.  Let me know if this helps."
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,5HT-2a,14,Mon Feb 9 05:02:58 2015 UTC,My favorite part is how the force of transmission follows the shared tangent of both circles.
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,greenroom628,9,Mon Feb 9 01:23:03 2015 UTC,"after years of engineering and mechanical design, i knew that was the case from remembering all the equations, but actually seeing it on a gif was kinda like, ""oh! that's what it means!"""
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,sebwiers,2,Mon Feb 9 02:20:26 2015 UTC,"By calling it 'force of transmission', isn't it implied that it follows the shared tangent of both circles?  Otherwise it would be a 'force of partly pushing two gears apart and partly transmitting rotation'.  Not implying this makes finding the shape that allows that easy...."
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,protestor,2,Mon Feb 9 04:43:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's nice.."
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,Nephoscope,1 point,Mon Feb 9 03:01:34 2015 UTC,"It is designed like this so the torque is constant, because the force occurs at the same radius."
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,tvtb,4,Mon Feb 9 20:42:05 2015 UTC,So it appears that the faces of the teeth actually slide against each other. Is this true? Is there a gear system where the points of the gears in contact do not slide against each other at all?
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,AP2S2K,8,Mon Feb 9 03:53:07 2015 UTC,"It may just be an illusion of the animation but with involute gear teeth there is no relative motion between the points of contact (i.e. no sliding)  Edit: to put it simply, the contact surfaces of the gear teeth roll against each other instead of sliding."
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,Dr_Mantis,3,Mon Feb 9 04:30:49 2015 UTC,To say that there is no amount of sliding between involute gear teeth is an oversimplification. The only place with true rolling motion is when the center of the teeth are in contact(and even then there might be a very small amount of sliding as rolling motion is almost always accompanied by sliding) and sliding increases towards the start and end of contact.
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,Chrysoscelis,0,Mon Feb 9 18:06:22 2015 UTC,Then the gif is wrong.  Follow one of the bottom corners of a tooth on the right side gear.  It makes contact near the base of one tooth and leaves around the middle of it.
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,Szos,5,Mon Feb 9 11:00:17 2015 UTC,I think that is a side effect of using such a thick black line for graphical reasons.  They really would only be touching at one point and not sliding.
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,jkjkjij22,2,Mon Feb 9 11:44:17 2015 UTC,"Near the end of each push it looks like it's sliding, but it's due to the thickness of the black line in the illustration. If there was no line, it wouldn't look like it was sliding. Better described as rolling on eachother."
mechanical_gifs,2v8r1p,metarinka,2,Mon Feb 9 21:25:20 2015 UTC,"no, no sliding, the point where the two gears are touching moves as the gears rotate."

mechanical_gifs,2u94ko,RespectMyAuthoriteh,10,Fri Jan 30 23:51:32 2015 UTC,Source video I made the gif from. News article with additional information.
mechanical_gifs,2u94ko,FearTheCron,2,Fri Jan 30 23:51:59 2015 UTC,I wonder why they let it drop so far on landing?
mechanical_gifs,2u94ko,jsheradin,3,Sat Jan 31 01:13:25 2015 UTC,"The piezos they used are probably either on or off, no altitude adjust."
mechanical_gifs,2u94ko,FearTheCron,5,Sat Jan 31 01:40:11 2015 UTC,They show the piezo being able to adjust frequency.  Since they can fly sideways I assume this correlates with differential lift.
mechanical_gifs,2u94ko,jsheradin,3,Sat Jan 31 03:21:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's adjustable frequency, but only within a certain range. It may not be able to oscillate slow enough for a soft landing."
mechanical_gifs,2u94ko,RobotEngineerGirl,15,Sat Jan 31 03:23:03 2015 UTC,"I actually work in this lab :)   More details are in the Science paper here http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6132/603.full?ijkey=6bYNbd439KKZ.&keytype=ref&siteid=sci (although it's somewhat outdated at this point) or on our website.   There are two piezos on the robot, one independently flapping each wing. That means that you can differentially flap the wings to achieve roll, pitch, and yaw (which control the direction of motion). You need to flap the wings fast enough in order to generate enough lift - below a certain frequency and you're just not going to be able to lift the body at all. Generally, the vehicles are light enough that a crash from this height doesn't damage them too much."
mechanical_gifs,2u94ko,jsheradin,8,Sat Jan 31 03:54:58 2015 UTC,"Awesome, what an amazing place Reddit is.  So, there is a point at which the lift sharply increases due to oscillation frequency? Is that increase sharp enough that you can't regulate the oscillation finely enough to give it a soft landing?"
mechanical_gifs,2u94ko,RobotEngineerGirl,8,Sat Jan 31 04:01:13 2015 UTC,"I don't work on this project specifically, so I'm not sure about the exact threshold for the lift to be sufficient. I do know that there IS one, though. A lot of the lift forces come from passive rotation of the wings, so there are a lot of aerodynamic factors in play, not just the oscillation of the actuators. We're actually doing some work on perching (http://micro.seas.harvard.edu/papers/BIOROB14_Chirarattananon.pdf) and finer control. I'm not entirely sure why a softer landing wasn't implemented, but I can find out :)"

mechanical_gifs,2u94ko,FearTheCron,3,Sat Jan 31 04:18:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Didn't expect someone from the lab itself to chime in.  This project looks awesome!  If they are just two, how do you control roll pitch and yaw?  Also what is the primary focus of your lab? Is it controllers, mechanical design or something else?  Unfortunately the paper is paywalled, I will need to wait until I get to school tomorrow to take a look at it."
mechanical_gifs,2u94ko,RobotEngineerGirl,6,Sat Jan 31 04:00:38 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of adjusting frequency and phase between the wings, as well as adjusting the speed of the upstroke and downstroke.There's a really awesome figure in that paper which explains how each motion is achieved. The caption from the figure explains it, but the figure really helps! ""(C) Roll torque is generated by flapping one wing with larger stroke amplitude than the other, inducing differential thrust forces (7). (D) Pitch torque is generated by moving the mean stroke angle of both wings forward or backward to offset the thrust vector away from the center of mass. This mimics a method observed in Drosophila (17). (E) To generate yaw torques, the robot influences wing drag forces by cyclically modulating stroke velocity in a “split-cycle” scheme (25, 30) rather than tilting the stroke plane (10) or altering wing angle of attack (18) as have been observed in Drosophila. A difference in stroke velocity between half-wing strokes results in an imbalanced drag force per stroke cycle—the higher velocity half-stroke (black arrow) produces greater drag force. By modulating magnitude and direction of this mean drag force on both wings, a net yaw torque is generated. The black and gray arrows correspond to arrows in (F).""  The lab is really varied - we do mechanical design and control for this vehicle, as well as a few other micro- and meso- scale vehicles. We also work on soft and printable robots, basically pushing the boundary of ""what is a robot?"". You can find out more about us at micro.seas.harvard.edu."

The difficulty is that it's harder to update the design incrementally with the monolithic approach - needing to strengthen a single linkage would take a full redesign rather than just making a new part. The monolithic approach is great for mass manufacturing...in theory. Right now, the equipment we have is only able to make things in a 6cm radius or so, so making more than a few robots at a time is not possible (we're working on this though, so keep an eye out!)."

mechanical_gifs,2u4ic3,Clay_Statue,8,Fri Jan 30 03:36:10 2015 UTC,I think because the boxer pistons compress and expand at the same time it is a more inherently balanced engine. ie. the boxer will vibrate less than the 180v
mechanical_gifs,2u4ic3,sebwiers,7,Fri Jan 30 09:54:17 2015 UTC,"The center of gravity doesn't change in a boxer, but in a 180ºV, the center of gravity moves with the crank shaft.  The boxer will be very smooth comparably."
mechanical_gifs,2u4ic3,mrdotkom,1 point,Fri Jan 30 15:01:46 2015 UTC,The 180V would vibrate a lot.  I imagine the boxer was quite the improvement without a huge amount of added complication.
mechanical_gifs,2u4ic3,PM_ME_YOUR_SUBARU,1 point,Fri Jan 30 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"Much more balanced, if you only have 2 cylinders.  But if you use multiple cylinders (ideally 3 or 6 on each side), the two halves are themselves balanced.  In that case the V configuration makes sense, as it is a much simpler construction.  With half as many con rod journals, it is both easier to machine, an more compact."

mechanical_gifs,2u4ic3,sebwiers,5,Fri Jan 30 03:38:33 2015 UTC,More or less. I looked up the difference between a boxer and a 180* V
mechanical_gifs,2u4ic3,DodgeTHlS,2,Fri Jan 30 13:07:02 2015 UTC,"On a 180 v, what if you got rid of the second connecting rod, and instead put a rod connecting the two pistons? The motion would be ever so slightly different, would it matter at all?"
mechanical_gifs,2u4ic3,OmniaMors,6,Thu Jan 29 23:27:58 2015 UTC,"in theory, no there would be no difference  in practice, there would be awful timing issues. Since the piston is no long directly connected to the crank, there would be times when it would be timed slightly differently than the other piston. You are making it assymetrical, so its more likely to have small assymetrical differences. This wouldnt be serious or damaging, but less efficient than as it is now."
mechanical_gifs,2u4ic3,Mad_Maxx,2,Fri Jan 30 00:30:29 2015 UTC,"What about balance?  I feel like it would be ungodly off balance. Also, wouldn't the piston-piston rod interfere with the crank?"
mechanical_gifs,2u4ic3,OmniaMors,1 point,Fri Jan 30 03:36:19 2015 UTC,"Also, wouldn't the piston-piston rod interfere with the crank?   Not if you did it right.  Imagine using a fairly large diameter piston, larger the the max diameter of the crank, and ensuring that the bottom ends of the con rods don't go outside this diameter as well.  Quite a few engines meet these conditions.  In that case, the outer edges of the piston skirts could be connected (even to the extent of making both pistons in one piece) without interfering with the crank or con rod at all.  But, the resulting reciprocating mass would likely be rather high.  Using two con rods is both simpler construction, and likely puts less stress on the crank."
mechanical_gifs,2u4ic3,deprivedchild,2,Fri Jan 30 19:07:30 2015 UTC,You would then not be transferring the reciprocating movement of the pistons into rotary movement on the crankshaft that is required to drive wheels or other rotary applications.
mechanical_gifs,2u4ic3,Sam_meow,1 point,Fri Jan 30 00:06:09 2015 UTC,"this is not correct, you would still be doing so. the second piston would push/pull on the first, which would push/pull on the crank"

mechanical_gifs,2u4ic3,noisymime,1 point,Fri Jan 30 05:25:36 2015 UTC,"The main issue is that in order to connect between both pistons, this dual rod is going to be at a fixed angle (the piston's path is liner). Actual piston rods (as you can see in the gif) change their angle relative to the linear movement of the piston, which is what gives us rotation. This would not be possible if you constrained the two pistons to each other across the crank case. (this single rod would also interfere with the crank itself)"

But businesses don't just upgrade their gear every time a slightly better one comes out, that would just cost money, time and a drop in production. To be honest it looks like this machine could be over 20 years old. If it keeps up with the required workload (throughput) and doesn't break often (reliable) then it doesn't need to be upgraded.  Upgrading is a way of a) increasing production, or b) decreasing operating costs, or both. Sometimes things will need to be upgraded to adhere to changed safety standards."

mechanical_gifs,2t3i3f,catocatocato,9,Tue Jan 20 23:52:19 2015 UTC,"Section 4. Disadvantages of article  Verge escapement:       As might be expected from its early invention, the verge is the most inaccurate of the widely used escapements. It suffers from these problems:   Verge watches and clocks are sensitive to changes in the drive force; they slow down as the mainspring unwinds.  This is called lack of isochronism. It was much worse in verge and foliot clocks due to the lack of a balance spring, but is a problem in all verge movements. In fact, the standard method of adjusting the rate of early verge watches was to alter the force of the mainspring.  The cause of this problem is that the crown wheel teeth are always pushing on the pallets, driving the pendulum (or balance wheel) throughout its cycle; it is never allowed to swing freely.  All verge watches and spring driven clocks required fusees to equalize the force of the mainspring to achieve even minimal accuracy. The escapement has ""recoil"", meaning that the momentum of the foliot or pendulum pushes the crown wheel backward momentarily, causing the clock's wheel train to move backward, during part of its cycle.  This increases friction and wear, resulting in inaccuracy. One way to tell whether an antique watch has a verge escapement is to observe the second hand closely; if it moves backward a little during each cycle, the watch is a verge. This is not necessarily the case in clocks, as there are some other pendulum escapements which exhibit recoil. In pendulum clocks, the wide pendulum swing angles of 80°-100° required by the verge cause an additional lack of isochronism due to circular error. The wide pendulum swings also cause a lot of air friction, reducing the accuracy of the pendulum, and requiring a lot of power to keep it going, increasing wear.  So verge pendulum clocks had lighter bobs, which reduced accuracy. Verge timepieces tend to accelerate as the crown wheel and the pallets wear down. This is particularly evident in verge watches from the mid-18th century onwards. It is not in the least unusual for these watches, when run today, to gain many hours per day, or to simply spin as if there were no balance present. The reason for this is that as new escapements were invented, it became the fashion to have a thin watch. To achieve this in a verge watch requires the crown wheel to be made very small, magnifying the effects of wear.

Modern engines just use a different style of valve timing.  The intake stroke is shorter than the power stroke in order to suck in less fuel and to then get the maximum power out of said fuel."

In current practice, all you have to do is leave the intake valve open during part of the compression stroke. That allows for a greater percentage of the pressure from combustion to be recovered as mechanical force on the piston before the exhaust value must open. You gain efficiency (MPG) in exchange for reduced total power.   But with variable valve timing, I figure you don't even need to give up total power - perhaps you could just adjust the timing back to an otto cycle under heavy demand?"
mechanical_gifs,2s73n1,Sam_meow,4,Tue Jan 13 04:01:59 2015 UTC,"this is similar to how Mazda's skyactive engines work. Under low load situations they run one timing profile (which i THINK is atkinson but I can't remember) to get better mileage, but under high load (flooring it) it switches the timing so that it runs the otto cycle for more max power. I think that's how it works, if not it's something similar."
mechanical_gifs,2s73n1,MattieF,1 point,Tue Jan 13 07:11:06 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure there's a lot of history behind variable valve timing that does not venture into Atkinson-cycle territory. And it sounds to me that SKYACTIV is more directly comparable to Ford's Ecoboost.
mechanical_gifs,2s73n1,FesteringNeonDistrac,7,Tue Jan 13 07:14:03 2015 UTC,"'Ecoboost' is just a clever marketing spin on the word 'Turbo'. All their motors with the Ecoboost moniker are turbocharged, gasoline direct injection. Mazda and Ford are closely related, and the L block that Ford uses in the 2.0 and 2.3 Ecoboost is the same as the one Mazda used in the 3 and Mazdaspeed 3, but those are not Ecoboost motors. The Skyactiv motors all are based on the P block. They are high compression, direct injection."

mechanical_gifs,2s73n1,rynvndrp,2,Tue Jan 13 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"Desmodromic valve:        In general mechanical terms, the word desmodromic is used to refer to mechanisms that have different controls for their actuation in different directions.   A desmodromic valve is a reciprocating engine valve that is positively closed by a cam and leverage system, rather than by a more conventional spring.  The valves in a typical four-stroke engine allow the air/fuel mixture into the cylinder at the beginning of the cycle and exhaust gases to be expelled at the end of the cycle. In a conventional four-stroke engine valves are opened by a cam and closed by return spring. An engine using desmodromic valves has two cams and two actuators, each for positive opening and closing without a return spring.    Image i - Desmodromic poppet valve in Ducati engine.

mechanical_gifs,2s73n1,Dirty_Socks,3,Tue Jan 13 03:51:40 2015 UTC,"On demand timing adjustment is something almost every engine maker does these days. There are a large list of different ways to change the timing on mechanically linked valves. The mathematics of machining precision for helical camshaft (just one method) is unreal.   Having said that, there are other ways to time an engine.  Large diesel engines found on trains for example have hydraulic valves which are electrically signaled. This has less to do with variable timing and more issues of a cam shaft that would be 20 feet long.    With the amount of timing changes that are getting built into engines and the fluid dynamic benefit of being able to ideally place the valve, I would be surprized if car engine makers aren't looking at all the options. I can imagine an engine that has a variable pressure turbo and electromechanical valves that would be able to continuously adjust being between an Otto cycle, Atkinson cycle, and Miller cycle depending on what the situation required. With direct fuel injection, you can also play around with some amount of diesel cycle advantages."

mechanical_gifs,2s73n1,Frankk142,6,Mon Jan 12 20:51:26 2015 UTC,Thermal efficiency has little to do with moving parts. It's how much of the intake heat gets utilized and how much of it gets exhausted.
mechanical_gifs,2s73n1,StatisticallyRacist,1 point,Mon Jan 12 22:02:13 2015 UTC,"In an Otto Cycle Engine, the volume of exhaust gas is greater than the volume of the displacement of the cylinder, which means exhaust leaves the engine under pressure, and that pressure is what would have become mechanical energy.  By limiting the intake charge (Either by using the linkage in the gif, or by altering valve timing so a portion of the intake charge is expelled before being compressed) you allow the exhaust gas to expand to near atmospheric pressure, meaning, more of the pressure that was created by igniting the fuel mixture is converted into mechanical energy (Vs. being blown out the exhaust as waste)  All that together means more energy is extracted from the same volume of fuel, raising efficiency."
mechanical_gifs,2s73n1,rumilb,1 point,Thu Jan 22 16:30:57 2015 UTC,"Out of all the explanations, yours is the only one that really made sense. So basically all the Atkinson cycle does is to lower the compression?"
mechanical_gifs,2s73n1,palfas,2,Thu Jan 22 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"Effectively, yes, its lowering the dynamic compression, but the main action that gives it improved efficiency is allowing the power stroke to be effectively longer than the 'intake' stroke.  The compression is effectively lowered by limiting the amount of air that gets compressed, but its a little different from an engine with a lower 'static' compression, where the intake and power strokes would be the same length, just with less compression.  The tricky bit is that higher compression engines tend to be more efficient as well, but using our valve timing trick lowers the 'dynamic' compression, so we either have to have an abnormally high static compression, in order to still have an efficient dynamic compression ratio, which limits the ability of the engine to run in a Otto Cycle as well (which would give it more power) or we can turbocharge the engine, partially compressing the intake charge before it goes into the cylinder, then, when we want to run in Otto Cycle, we cut the boost pressure back to a safe level."

mechanical_gifs,2ro5pl,Oilfan94,19,Thu Jan 8 16:31:40 2015 UTC,honest question: what is the advantage to removing a tree this way instead of felling it normally & chipping it afterward? this looks rather messy and inefficient to this layperson.
mechanical_gifs,2ro5pl,mkraft,44,Wed Jan 7 22:47:51 2015 UTC,"Well in a residential area you can't just chop it down in the traditional lumberjack way because powerlines, houses children etc. Doing it the regular way for a residential area is to start at the top and take pieces until you get to the bottom. then chip it and cleanup. this takes it down pretty much instantly and the clean up is probably easily done in 20 minutes with a shovel. Just my thoughts not an expert or anything."

mechanical_gifs,2ro5pl,Jrook,15,Thu Jan 8 17:34:34 2015 UTC,"when you have trees that are killed by parasites (pine beetles, elm beetles) its deadly unsafe to try and fell the ""traditional"" way.  you have an entire tree weight sitting on a rotten trunk.. and you want to hit that trunk with a chainsaw... it goes ""boom""  the moment you weaken it with a saw/axe - and if you arent injured/ killed by the splinters, you likely will by the rest of the tree falling on you."
mechanical_gifs,2ro5pl,notHooptieJ,4,Thu Jan 8 02:38:29 2015 UTC,"Wow, I had no idea about that.

Additionally a technique of pressure welding may be used, where by the two mating ends are heated just a critical point where the material is very malleable. Then the two faces are pushed together under extreme pressure. This joins the two surfaces."

mechanical_gifs,2q6ec4,mrdotkom,3,Tue Dec 23 14:50:17 2014 UTC,"Yeah, with the thermostat closed the coolant doesn't circulate to the radiator. It works like this when you cold start you car, if you try to turn on the heater you're gonna get cold air because the thermostat is closed so coolant cant flow to the heater core (a tiny radiator inside the cabin). Note, if you car is overheating turn on the heaters to full blast and you'll be a little better off.  This is actually important to mention. A lot of people say ""No my car has never overheated!"" and they're partially right, the needle inside their cab never went to red, because there was no coolant to register on the thermometer. Generally an empty coolant system will never read overheated and people will warp their block so badly because they don't have the common sense to actually check their coolant regularly"
mechanical_gifs,2q6ec4,thewolfmansbrotha,7,Tue Dec 23 15:18:17 2014 UTC,"This isn't really true, you get cold air because all of the coolant is cold. Most heater cores are supplied separately from the t-stat anyway."

mechanical_gifs,2q6ec4,thewolfmansbrotha,5,Tue Dec 23 15:25:16 2014 UTC,"Separate plumbing, yes. Expansion tank, no. There is usually a bypass circuit that supplies coolant to the heater core.

mechanical_gifs,2q6ec4,HAL-42b,1 point,Wed Dec 24 08:13:58 2014 UTC,"Because of the easy and robust design, the chances of failure are already very small, but in most cars there are back-up systems.  From Wikipedia:   On many automobile engines, including all Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict flow to the heater core. The passenger side tank of the radiator is used as a bypass to the thermostat, flowing through the heater core. This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows the heater to function before the thermostat opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the thermostat fails."
mechanical_gifs,2q6ec4,sprawlingmegalopolis,1 point,Tue Dec 23 14:51:15 2014 UTC,The most common failure mode is simply rust.   People do not replace their coolant often enough so it loses its corrosion inhibiting properties. Not to mention running on plain water.

mechanical_gifs,2q6ec4,fredspipa,8,Tue Dec 23 19:04:31 2014 UTC,"One thing to add. The thermostat within an internal combustion engine is primary there to keep the engine hot, not cold. In other words, a engine runs better with a thermostat.   Ideally, it's designed to keep the engine within a range of ideal operating temperature, (usually between 200 to 250F)...and with respects to pollution (emission) the thermostat serves a critical role by helping the engine get to an ideal temperature sooner, which lowers emissions.   In other words, cold starts and cold engines produce more emissions and burn less efficient.   There are actually some radical engine designs of the past that burned super super hot...but were very efficient and produced little emissions.   Lastly, if you engine is overheating because of a stuck thermostat, then turning on your heater will not do any good. This trick of cooling your engine with the compartment heater is more related to the days when engines didn't have adequate cooling systems and tended to overheat. But...in order to work, you have to have circulation between the block and the heater core (a small radiator inside the passenger compartment)."

mechanical_gifs,2pzbbq,Nate__,49,Sun Dec 21 16:19:26 2014 UTC,"There is no difference between the left and right image. They show the same impact wrench.  It shows how the bolt is screwed by letting a heavy cylinder mass impact on the drill bit. It allows to tighten bolts and transfer a high torque without overheating, even when the bolt is not moving anymore.  The drill will speed up the rotating mass via a torsional spring, after which the mass hits the impact plate. While the drill is still turning, the torsional spring will wind up, which stores the energy and pulls the mass up.  It is commonly used by mechanics, e.g. when they replace tires. It is this drill that makes the distinctive rattling sound.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_wrench"
mechanical_gifs,2pzbbq,autowikibot,6,Sun Dec 21 17:15:18 2014 UTC,"Impact wrench:       An impact wrench (also known as an impactor, air wrench, air gun, rattle gun, torque gun, windy gun) is a socket wrench power tool designed to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion by the user, by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft.  Compressed air is the most common power source, although electric or hydraulic power is also used, with cordless electric devices becoming increasingly popular in recent times.   Impact wrenches are widely used in many industries, such as automotive repair, heavy equipment maintenance, product assembly, major construction projects, and any other instance where a high torque output is needed. For product assembly, a pulse tool is commonly used, as it features a reaction less tightening while reducing the noise levels the regular impacts suffer from. Pulse tools use oil as a medium to transfer the kinetic energy from the hammer into the anvil. This gives a smoother impulse, a slightly lower torque to weight ratio and a possibility to design a shut off mechanism that shuts the tool down when achieving the correct torque. Impact wrenches with shut off mechanism, which exist, often suffer from a very high mean shift, which is why this technology is losing ground. Pulse tools are not referred to as ""impact wrenches"" as the performance and technology are not the same.

mechanical_gifs,2pzbbq,reallifedog,2,Sun Dec 21 20:39:04 2014 UTC,Doesn't this wear down the wrench really really quickly and make it hard to hold on to for the user?
mechanical_gifs,2pzbbq,johnmal85,5,Sun Dec 21 18:36:33 2014 UTC,Some are packed with oil and they are surprisingly easy to handle unless you're using a high torque gun on a large screw.
mechanical_gifs,2pzbbq,adambultman,5,Sun Dec 21 18:44:54 2014 UTC,"Even then the torque is applied for only a split second(granted, repeatedly) so its not too bad to hold onto. It will wear out your grip though."

mechanical_gifs,2pzbbq,metarinka,3,Mon Dec 22 02:55:59 2014 UTC,You should oil them frequently.   Also for heavy torque you should use a limiter stick

mechanical_gifs,2pzbbq,forgetfulcoder,2,Mon Dec 22 12:13:34 2014 UTC,what mechanism causes it to retract the hammer?
mechanical_gifs,2pzbbq,nik282000,5,Sun Dec 21 20:57:12 2014 UTC,In the right image you can see briefly a helical spline that the weight is riding on. When the weight can not rotate any more the spline causes it to rise compressing the spring.

mechanical_gifs,2pnb9w,IcanCwhatUsay,15,Thu Dec 18 03:47:32 2014 UTC,I'm guessing it needs to rev the engine a bit more in order to give the hydraulics the extra push needed to split the log

mechanical_gifs,2pnb9w,OfficialCocaColaAMA,1 point,Thu Dec 18 18:09:09 2014 UTC,"It is not automated. Each step of the process in that machine has to be manually controlled. If the splitter leaves a piece of log in that chamber the logs fall into he has to shake it free, otherwise it'll drop the log out of alignment with the splitter, and it won't work properly.  The rotating teeth that feed the log under the chainsaw has to be controlled manually because 1. the log isn't going to feed at a constant rate and 2. when the log ends the operator has to make a decision on where to cut the rest so that he gets even sized pieces.  Pretty much the only thing that's automated is the speed of the chain on the chainsaw."

mechanical_gifs,2pnb9w,soil_nerd,-2,Thu Dec 18 06:33:31 2014 UTC,That tree would have yielded perfectly good lumber to produce something that would last many years. Chopping it into firewood is such a waste.

mechanical_gifs,2pnb9w,lx45803,2,Thu Dec 18 15:26:04 2014 UTC,alternatives?
mechanical_gifs,2pnb9w,dutchboy99,3,Thu Dec 18 15:32:32 2014 UTC,"Process the wood into lumber, sell the lumber, improve building insulation so less firewood is needed, burn waste material from the milling process. There are even machines that compress sawdust into 'logs' which an be burned in a normal fireplace if they insist on that authentic feel.   The problem is that even if they have plenty of trees to cut there is shortage of quality lumber worldwide. This is mostly because the trees are cut too young and are wasted as we see here. Not to mention the fast diminishing habitat for most species which can be helped a great deal by allowing the trees to grow bigger."
mechanical_gifs,2pnb9w,HAL-42b,5,Thu Dec 18 17:18:59 2014 UTC,so nothing I can put in my wood stove this afternoon
mechanical_gifs,2pnb9w,dutchboy99,2,Thu Dec 18 18:52:50 2014 UTC,There's a decent chance that this is a campground or something. They have logs delivered and happen to own a bobcat that can turn it into firewood.

mechanical_gifs,2pe0tl,PumbaTheGreat,2,Tue Dec 16 15:50:01 2014 UTC,"I know this is a few days old but here ya go...  1 unit of gasoline needs 14.7 units of air to burn completely.  The more gas you can burn in the combustion chamber the more power the engine will have.  If you just added more gas you would end up with an engine running lean which can destroy the engine.    Turbos and superchargers are a way to put more air in the engine than is possible in a normally aspirated engine.  With this increase in air you can put in more fuel, thus more power.  Here's a turbo  A supercharger send compressed air to the engine similar to a turbo the only difference is that instead of the exhaust driving the compressor, the compressor is driven from the rotation of the crank."

mechanical_gifs,2p35q7,griter34,11,Fri Dec 12 17:22:34 2014 UTC,I'm wondering the same thing. Maybe there's some sort of heat dissipation benefit if you alternate cutting deep and shallow that results in less tool wear? I don't know...

mechanical_gifs,2p35q7,joshu,1 point,Sat Dec 13 02:04:16 2014 UTC,Have you tried optimizing the toolpaths yourself? What software are you using?
mechanical_gifs,2p35q7,WatersLethe,4,Sat Dec 13 04:54:20 2014 UTC,"Not  yet. I have read the gcode and started understanding it - I wrote a program to optimize fastmoves but it didn't get much of a gain.  I'm using MeshCAM.  Note that I am a complete and utter nonprofessional noob here. The mill has a 4.5"" x 5.5"" stage - really teeny. But it is a huge amount of fun to work with. Here are some things I made: http://imgur.com/fSKPrST http://imgur.com/GDSVyk6"

mechanical_gifs,2p35q7,WatersLethe,1 point,Sat Dec 13 05:40:01 2014 UTC,"What do you use now? Are you happy with it?  MeshCAM lets me do a single roughing pass, and then watermilling and x-y parallel finishing with another bit, and then pencil cleanup and cutout with a final bit."

Chip thinning is a big part of the efficiency increase and better tool life because you are utilizing the whole length of the endmill rather than just a little bit of the end.

mechanical_gifs,2p35q7,griter34,5,Sat Dec 13 12:08:11 2014 UTC,Are compressor wheels generally cast? It seems like that's a lot of tech and machining time to be manufacturing something so prevalent.
mechanical_gifs,2p35q7,_11_,13,Fri Dec 12 18:42:29 2014 UTC,Depends on application.  We (aerospace) mill various impellers because we have low volume and can't live with any casting defects or the geometry is not conducive to casting.  Vacuum cleaners cast impellers because they don't have that issue.
mechanical_gifs,2p35q7,jaasx,2,Fri Dec 12 19:14:37 2014 UTC,"Gotcha. I was thinking of the centrifugal compressor wheels on turbo chargers. The yearly production volumes for those things would tie up every 5-axis mill in the states, so I figured there must be something else going on.    Cool to know that aero goes this route though. :)"

mechanical_gifs,2p35q7,Dr_Avocado,2,Fri Dec 12 19:14:31 2014 UTC,Many automotive turbos are sand cast.
mechanical_gifs,2p35q7,FrenchFryCattaneo,1 point,Fri Dec 12 21:18:14 2014 UTC,"Not compressor wheels -- they'll be cast in plaster or using some other technique that gives a better surface finish. Housings though, sand casting for sure."
mechanical_gifs,2p35q7,asad137,2,Sat Dec 13 02:34:35 2014 UTC,"I work for a compressor company.  We use forgings as ""blanks"" for impellors then 5-axis mill them.  This is done for 3 reason.  #1 is castings take FOREVER.  #2 castings typically are more prone to imperfections. #3 we customize the impellor geometry to optimize for whatever aero condition the machine needs to meet.  When you add all that stuff up, it just makes a lot more sense to 5-axis mill them."

The process is named after Polish scientist Jan Czochralski,  who invented the method in 1916 while investigating the crystallization rates of metals.   The most important application may be the growth of large cylindrical ingots, or boules, of single crystal silicon. Other semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, can also be grown by this method, although lower defect densities in this case can be obtained using variants of the Bridgman-Stockbarger technique.

If any debris is to pass within a set distance of the station, they alter their altitude to avoid any chance at a strike on the station. Generally, these impact trajectories can be calculated many orbits prior to that point, which gives them a lot of time.  Very rarely however the station will receive small debris impacts, but much of the pressurized sections of the station are guarded by the truss segments. I believe the most recent (and noticeable) debris strike was a small hit on one of the radiators located on the truss."

mechanical_gifs,2obauz,no0b_64,27,Fri Dec 5 01:33:42 2014 UTC,the only reason i can think of is it is very specialized. you could alter the depth of the screw's blade to handle looser soil but you'd need a whole new drive train. it would ruin hard paths... but this thing in the woods or a mud hole would be epic! i'm going to show this to some country boys form my home town and see if they feel like trying to recreate it!

mechanical_gifs,2obauz,LiquidInsight,7,Sat Dec 27 23:53:28 2014 UTC,One major reason:  The screws wear out very fast.
mechanical_gifs,2obauz,vonHindenburg,2,Fri Dec 5 05:50:04 2014 UTC,I really have no proof if i am right or not but I would think if your not riding on rocky surfaces or paved road the screws would last quite a long time. Anyways with modern technology I would think we could make alot better screw design with thicker screws. Maybe we could coat the whole thing in rubber to help not destroy the screws on logs and rocks.
mechanical_gifs,2obauz,Cadillacpimpin69,6,Fri Dec 5 12:24:05 2014 UTC,"By coating the whole thing in rubber you defeat the purpose of using rubber in the first place. Rubber on tires/treads is used to give grip, not really for protection. This whole machine operates by the gliding action of the screws over the surface. In the end, it's pretty inevitable that the screws will wear out eventually :T"
mechanical_gifs,2obauz,hipstergrandpa,1 point,Fri Dec 5 21:28:21 2014 UTC,Rubber on the screw would give it a bit more life I would imagine. Instead of the metal getting torn apart just the rubber would.
mechanical_gifs,2obauz,Cadillacpimpin69,5,Fri Dec 5 22:37:40 2014 UTC,"You'd be better off using plastic than rubber. It'd be a lot easier to make replacement pieces of plastic, say make 1-foot lengths that are fitted to the threads of the screw and can be replaced as needed. Easier to make than a piece of rubber like that, and would more-easily allow the ""sliding"" action the screw requires."
mechanical_gifs,2obauz,ITCD,3,Sat Dec 6 01:39:30 2014 UTC,"Well, super-thick snow, up to a horse's belly is really the exception, rather than the rule.  Anywhere you take one of these, even in a foot or two of snow, you'll be grinding against trees, rocks, ice, etc.  Even dirt will wear them down eventually.  Probably, yes, we do have harder steels than were possible back then.  Whether they'd be cost effective is another question.  As to a rubber liner, that would wear off in no time.  These aren't like the wheels on a car that roll along without sliding.  These are constantly grinding against the ground, with little bits abrading off."
mechanical_gifs,2obauz,vonHindenburg,4,Sat Dec 13 02:22:50 2014 UTC,Tracked vehicles work just as well and are much more versatile. And probably less prone to equipment failure.
mechanical_gifs,2obauz,peese-of-cawffee,3,Sat Dec 6 13:02:46 2014 UTC,This thing has a much wider foot print and it can float in water so I would imagine it would have advantages to it in certain terrains like purely deep mud and snow.
mechanical_gifs,2obauz,Cadillacpimpin69,2,Fri Dec 5 17:22:30 2014 UTC,"The linemen and pipeliners in south Louisiana use tracked vehicles that float and have a footprint on par with this thing. They take a normal dozer/excavator and put pontoon tracks on it. They're called marsh buggies, and I guarantee they can move more weight more efficiently through tougher terrain. And they can operate on pavement without damaging the surface or the vehicle. They can operate on any surface, anywhere. That kind of versatility is why tracked vehicles have taken over jobs in tough terrain. The ONLY place this screw drive might be more efficient is in that mud farming scenario. And I still wouldn't be surprised if a swamp buggy could out-perform it.  Edit: and I'm not positive the screw drive can actually float in water, I didn't see anything that indicated it would. I'm probably wrong, that seems like a feature you'd want to have on a heavy vehicle that drives on ice."
mechanical_gifs,2obauz,peese-of-cawffee,2,Fri Dec 5 21:30:03 2014 UTC,You are right about a track being alot better in 90% of situations but I can still see some things better about this. For one it seems like its smaller and able to fit through tight spaces. Also in a place where the mud is just to thin for a track to go over it this would work nicely. I could see this working well for logging in extremely muddy and snow covered areas (Russia) other then that the track is just better. I still like this thing alot though. I would imagine it would be nearly impossible to get this thing stuck. Heres a picture of one floating in water. http://patentpending.blogs.com/patent_pending_blog/images/capture1118200644350_pm.jpg

mechanical_gifs,2obauz,electricdog,0,Fri Dec 5 17:13:16 2014 UTC,"A track, or wheel, will cut even worse ruts, since they attempt to move the vehicle directly opposing the oncoming mud as it moves forward.

mechanical_gifs,2o7ggy,WhiskeyMoon,5,Thu Dec 4 20:08:16 2014 UTC,"The reason why most of these plants don't use robots boils down to the cost. (Overall machine costs, set-up costs, repair, etc).  But the benefit of using a robot would be more for expandability and modulatiry. The line that is used above looks like it only packages a set size of batteries and the change over from one size to another looks like it will take a long time. and looks like there would be a boat load of change-over parts as well.  Comparing apples to apples (just the battery sorting and arranging part) a multi-DOF robot wtih a vision system would be far superior than that of a system as the video above. a few hours of programming the vision system to detect the difference sizes and some programming in the PLC for the robots to arrange the parts and you can come up with many different recipes.  Unfortunately many manufacturers don't always see this. All they're thinking about is the price and ROI.  But that sorting machine is pretty cool though. I enjoy seeing these types of machines."

mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,Tain101,34,Mon Dec 1 08:10:13 2014 UTC,Would this run until the battery died if I made it into a loop?   yes   Would this work with a rechargeable battery?   yes
mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,B0rax,4,Mon Dec 1 08:16:31 2014 UTC,How does it use the battery to go forth? I thought it worked because of magnets..
mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,Urnquei,18,Mon Dec 1 15:59:06 2014 UTC,"The copper coil is connected to the battery via the magnets.  The current creates a magnetic field that pushes the magnets forward.  The current stays mainly around the train, and thus it travels through the coil."
mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,Altair1371,2,Mon Dec 1 16:17:06 2014 UTC,"If it where only the magnets it'd be a perpetual motion machine, something we can't make. In this case the energy lost comes from the battery which dispenses chemically stored potential as electricity and a magnetic field"
mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,Blissfull,12,Fri Dec 5 04:23:21 2014 UTC,make the coil yourself by winding copper wire around a tube.  Get magnets on ebay
mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,buyingthething,5,Mon Dec 1 09:07:07 2014 UTC,Unshielded wire in this case.
mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,Blissfull,6,Fri Dec 5 04:24:09 2014 UTC,"I would guess that if you could put it in a loop, it would get very hot after a while."
mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,BeedleTB,7,Mon Dec 1 15:02:38 2014 UTC,no.. the coil has enough resistance that it won't get hot. I think it wouldn't even get noticeable warm.
mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,B0rax,-1,Mon Dec 1 16:57:54 2014 UTC,"Resistance increases heat (more resistance means the electrons are smacking in to more things inside of the resistor/semiconductor, causing the semiconductor atoms to jiggle about more rapidly, thus thermal energy).  It's more so that the battery isn't powerful enough compared to the relatively large and exposed surface area of the wire."
mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,tnactim,5,Tue Dec 2 06:20:42 2014 UTC,"Resistance also decreases current which in turn reduces the amount of power getting translated to heat. (At a fixed voltage which it is with a battery)  You could compare the resistor with a forest. The more trees, the higher is the resistance. When you run through a forest, you can run faster if there are less trees. This is the current."

mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,buyingthething,12,Mon Dec 1 06:30:26 2014 UTC,"Yes, it's an ""unrolled"" linear homopolar motor, where the coil constitutes a solenoid."
mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,oskay,5,Mon Dec 1 07:45:05 2014 UTC,"Does that mean that in the gif, the battery is spinning while going through the coil?"

mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,three_three_fourteen,3,Mon Dec 1 16:36:05 2014 UTC,"Not really. Current through the coil (i.e. between battery terminals) produces magnetic field which is pushing against the magnets on the battery, moving it forwards. You can note that it doesn't come out rapidly spinning."
mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,dizekat,2,Mon Dec 1 14:57:42 2014 UTC,I think it's more similar to a solenoid.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoid
mechanical_gifs,2nx1n6,StetsonG,1 point,Mon Dec 1 19:27:42 2014 UTC,"More like a railgun, the current travels through the wire, producing a field that interacts with the magnets and propels it.

Fuel economy is equatable to a v6 for the most part, and since it produce power pretty similar to one it's not too bad.  There's just a little more work and know how needed, it's a simple design it's just matter of learning how to test it to know what need to be repaired."
mechanical_gifs,2nkm8b,Dick-Tracy,2,Thu Nov 27 19:35:46 2014 UTC,"I've got one. It's only worth about $9k CAD despite being an '05 with only 75k kms on it.  It's a hoot to drive, super nimble, super predictable. Not the fastest thing off the line, but it can easily destroy much more powerful vehicles on a twisty course due to its superb handling. I drive it year round, it has snow tires on it right now.  The reason it's so cheap is because the engine requires a bit of special care, and it's hard to know if a previous owner has treated it right or has abused it. If it has been abused, you could be buying a ticking bomb; if it has been treated well it can last a long time with less maintenance than a piston engine, at least until the seals go.  I set up a savings account when I bought the car - $10/month engine replacement fund. It's been nearly a decade now, so I have over a grand saved up - it'll be more than that when it goes, but it sure will soften the blow.  /r/rx8 and /r/Rotaries are both good subs, or rx8club.com"

mechanical_gifs,2nk0t9,forte2,23,Thu Nov 27 06:16:30 2014 UTC,what's the benefit of moving the coils?
mechanical_gifs,2nk0t9,B0rax,28,Thu Nov 27 09:34:42 2014 UTC,The idea behind it is using the coils to not only speed up the wheel but use induction to slow the wheel down therefore eliminating the need for a heavy breaking system.
mechanical_gifs,2nk0t9,B0rax,11,Thu Nov 27 10:36:51 2014 UTC,I thought this could be done without moving the coils? Is it more efficient this way?
mechanical_gifs,2nk0t9,Yianna,15,Thu Nov 27 11:13:46 2014 UTC,"I don't really understand the technology despite being an electrical motor rewinder (I haven't done it for decades). As I understand it removing the stator from the rotor drops the amount of EMF interference and increases the efficiency when running at high speeds, having the stator all the way in at low speeds allows for full torque which isn't needed at high speeds. Their product site is in Japanese and I don't have a translator on the work comp. http://www.mitsuba.co.jp/english/products/solarcarandev    So, I really don't know what the hell is going on with it. I think what you're alluding to is a regenerative braking system which this doesn't appear to be. They seem to be applying power through the stator to the rotor and basically dragging it back with magnetism causing it to slow down."
mechanical_gifs,2nk0t9,joetemus,2,Thu Nov 27 11:38:21 2014 UTC,But i dont understand why they remove the ability to regenerate energy from the system temporarily.
mechanical_gifs,2nk0t9,joetemus,8,Thu Nov 27 14:56:40 2014 UTC,"Because there isn't a regenerative system in the vehicle. These types of solar race cars aren't made for stop start, they're made for going long distance without stopping so the focus is on keeping the batteries charged with solar, using the available energy in the most efficient way possible, aerodynamics and keeping the weight down to conserve the energy available."
mechanical_gifs,2nk0t9,Yianna,5,Thu Nov 27 15:07:22 2014 UTC,"I'm on the Iowa state solar car team, and every solar car I've seen has had a regen system on it.  We don't just race on highways, but also through cities, and on race tracks.  This requires us to brake.  the mitsuba motor shown is variable stator just for efficiency."

mechanical_gifs,2nk0t9,RedMushtoom,4,Thu Nov 27 15:14:20 2014 UTC,"Yeah, entirely doable without moving the coils, using only the electronics. More efficient without moving the coils, too. It may be an invention made after it's time - back in the day you couldn't make fancy motor controllers and to raise the RPM at a given voltage (but lower the torque) you'd lower the field. Usually you'd use electromagnets to provide said field - there weren't neodymium magnets back then - so you didn't need to move anything.  Ditto for lowering the voltage at given RPM if using it as a generator.  The motor or generator works most efficiently at maximum field though (the higher the better), because then you have higher voltages, lower currents, and lower resistive losses, so it's not a good solution."
mechanical_gifs,2nk0t9,B0rax,3,Thu Nov 27 11:37:02 2014 UTC,Probably to vary the intensity of the magnetic field that the coils expose the rotors to without having to adjust the voltage.
mechanical_gifs,2nk0t9,ItIsOneCrazyWorld,1 point,Thu Nov 27 13:18:38 2014 UTC,"This was my first impression; using it to lower weight because less hardware was needed to more the stator than to regulate the large current involved.  Nonetheless, it's a guess and I'd love to hear the design logic."
mechanical_gifs,2nk0t9,B0rax,0,Thu Nov 27 13:21:22 2014 UTC,"More than the hardware, I'd say it has to do with the energy loss that happens when you change the voltage on a wire. I can't remember what it's called, but I know that when you're energizing an electrical circuit you have to momentarily provide the circuit with more current than it'll need while operating in order to overcome an initial resistance that'll prevent the conductor from moving your desired voltage. I believe this also applies when you're trying to increase the voltage on any circuit. Keeping the voltage on the wires constant, but moving them, could end up saving a while bunch of energy that would otherwise be lost increasing the voltage through the coils."
mechanical_gifs,2nk0t9,ItIsOneCrazyWorld,2,Thu Nov 27 13:41:11 2014 UTC,it would need much less energy than physically moving the coils..
mechanical_gifs,2nk0t9,RedMushtoom,2,Thu Nov 27 14:43:43 2014 UTC,"Not if the energy being used to push/pull the coils is human energy. I mean, with that set up you could just move the coils with levers and cables mechanically and not use any of the vehicle's electrical energy to move them at all."

mechanical_gifs,2njz91,Wiggen93,10,Thu Nov 27 09:23:27 2014 UTC,"I wonder too what that would do to combustion.  Wouldn't you end up with bits of fuel in the corners that don't explode properly?  Seals would be a bitch, compared to a circular piston too."
mechanical_gifs,2njz91,vonHindenburg,6,Thu Nov 27 11:30:37 2014 UTC,Not to mention even for the same seal a square park will have more leaks since it has a larger perimeter for the same area.
mechanical_gifs,2njz91,OmniaMors,4,Thu Nov 27 11:42:57 2014 UTC,Not to mention square corners provide fragile places for heat stress and vibration to work their damage.

There is a connecting rod in there, the large circle in the middle is to allow the crankshaft clearance along the entire travel area. The difference comes from the crankshaft being within the piston, meaning a shorter connecting rod (which may actually increase bearing wear along both ends, as they'd be hitting larger degrees of angle from 0 when the crankshaft is at 90- and 270-degrees), and the overall compact package offered by this arrangement."

mechanical_gifs,2n60pw,kleinyman,35,Sun Nov 23 15:08:58 2014 UTC,"It has no outer propeller, so it can be used in shallow waters without risking ruining your engine."
mechanical_gifs,2n60pw,furryscrotum,26,Sun Nov 23 15:21:33 2014 UTC,It is also beneficial in preventing cavitation. Since the propeller is working against a choke the pressure is higher in the liquid and the rpm can be higher than in open water.
mechanical_gifs,2n60pw,Accipiter46,3,Sun Nov 23 16:22:37 2014 UTC,"Yes and no, it actually can suck up stuff from the bottom and clog up the jet..  Another use is picking up divers, much more agile and not as dangerous as a propeller"

mechanical_gifs,2n60pw,shim12,2,Sun Nov 23 19:01:06 2014 UTC,That seems to be correct. It's a little bit less efficent so that will have to be weighted against the pros.
mechanical_gifs,2n60pw,Accipiter46,14,Sun Nov 23 20:49:42 2014 UTC,"Naval Arch here.  Its a less efficient engine, but on a consumer level they are just easy. They don't require any hull protrusions, so the keel is at the keel where a prop will lower the true keel. AKA. it stops rookies from running aground and requiring costly fixes.  The engines themselves are taken from motorcycles, so you dont need a specialized mechanic to do repairs on them. There are a few mods to make them work, but any idiot with a wrench and youtube can do most work on them.  They are also easy to care for. Lots have a nozel to plug a hose up to and flush the saltwater out. Its real easy to do. 10 min and you are done. most other marine engines require some form of dismantling to properly flush an engine.  thats just a consumer side of things. more professional reasons are all over the place but tend to boil down to weight displacement vs HP & vertical center of gravity vs. HP."

mechanical_gifs,2n60pw,Captrotc,2,Sun Nov 23 20:24:14 2014 UTC,But the Catch 22 is that you can't turn if you don't have you foot on the pedal.
mechanical_gifs,2n60pw,Daldridge,3,Sun Nov 23 22:10:25 2014 UTC,Well you don't need to have any feet on anything since boats are controlled with levers.   There is a setting where you can turn without applying a net forward or backward thrust.
mechanical_gifs,2n60pw,Captrotc,4,Sun Nov 23 22:44:56 2014 UTC,"To add to what the other two responders have already said:  Because there's less cavitation, jet boats can go faster than a similar sized boat with a conventional propeller. That's why they're used on things like PWCs(Jet-skis or ""ski-doos"") and fast ferries.  Without an external propeller, not only can they operate in shallower waters, but they can also operate when there's more debris in the water. Rescue boats(things that are like tow trucks for the water) use them because when they're making a rescue there may well be bits of rope or other crap in the water around the boat they're rescuing. There may also be people in the water to be rescued and since there's no external prop, there's less chance of injuring a person in the water."

They're often used with bowtie filters.  People will insert a bowtie shaped piece of metal around your body, so that the x-ray detector gets uniform exposure (i.e. the filter blocks more xrays where your body is thin, lets more xrays pass where your body is thick, so that at the detector the exposure is about the same everywhere).  Then do this normalization so that the filter appears invisible in the resulting image.  It could be some sort of subtraction imaging, like DSA, that highlights changes in time.    Or it could be anything.  Who knows.  It looks pretty cool at least."

mechanical_gifs,2mkf2a,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Wed Nov 19 19:48:25 2014 UTC,"The whole point of the suppressor is that it keeps gasses from escaping (for the time shown in gif, that is. The gasses will eventually escape, but slowly and over a much longer time)"
mechanical_gifs,2mkf2a,dizekat,2,Wed Nov 19 19:49:33 2014 UTC,"No, the point of the suppressor is that it keeps the gasses from making as much noise when they escape.  The gasses still escape (and even the quietest suppressed firearm ever is loud enough to be heard in your average bar), but the report is attenuated by every successive chamber that they pass through.  I mean, the thing is literally a muffler for explosions.  Do mufflers stop the gasses from exiting a car's engine system?  No. Do they make things completely quiet?  No.  Do they slow down the escape of gasses, do they make things quieter? Yes."
mechanical_gifs,2mkf2a,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Wed Nov 19 19:58:49 2014 UTC,"The point is, over the time shown in that gif, almost none of the gasses from the barrel make it out of the suppressor. The suppressor forces gasses to divert into those chambers to the sides instead of going straight out. The gasses will eventually escape, but not in the length of that gif. Over the length of that gif, more gas enters the suppressor than leaves the suppressor.  That results in less noise because the kinetic energy of the gas gets lost in the suppressor, there's less energy to make noise with."
mechanical_gifs,2mkf2a,dizekat,0,Wed Nov 19 20:12:26 2014 UTC,"Why on earth do you make that assumption?  If the cold gasses in the various chambers are displaced, they won't be visible in the image because they'd be the same density as the gasses outside the barrel.  What's more, if your statement that ""more gas enters the suppressor than leaves the suppressor"" it would become darker in that image, not lighter.   No, if this is an xray, then what's happening is clearly that the high pressure/low mass gasses displace the gasses in the suppressor, pushing them out of the barrel, then draw them back in as the gasses cool."
mechanical_gifs,2mkf2a,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Wed Nov 19 21:19:30 2014 UTC,"Why on earth do you make that assumption?   Because that's how suppressors work. Gun fires, high pressure gasses from the barrel come into the suppressor, and are slowed down, delayed, cooled, etc, with gasses (inclusive of air) leaving the suppressor at a much lower velocity and overpressure.   Naturally, if you have a set amount of gas coming in at 1km/s and leaving at 10m/s , it has to leave over a much longer time (picture a crowd walking into a hallway at 10 people per minute, for 2 minutes, then slowly dispersing at 1 person per minute, for 20 minutes)   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressor#Design_and_construction   Both types of suppressors reduce noise by allowing the rapidly expanding gases from the firing of the cartridge to be decelerated and cooled through a series of hollow chambers. The trapped gas exits the suppressor over a longer period of time and at a greatly reduced velocity, producing less noise signature.    .   What's more, if your statement that ""more gas enters the suppressor than leaves the suppressor"" it would become darker in that image, not lighter.    It is not an x-ray. It is a suppressor with a glass side, or something of that kind, and it becomes lighter because it's flame. Because it's black and white it's hard to tell. In an x-ray, the metal barrel, even with vacuum in it, will still be darker than no barrel. Because of how much more metal mass there is in the way of x-rays than air (plus metals also stop x-rays better because of higher atomic weight but I digress)   edit: and no realistic amount of correction, background subtraction, or the like will let you see the x-ray shadow of the minuscule weight of the air within a thick metal barrel.  edit: by the way, density of the air (room temperature, sea level) is about 1.2 grams per litre. The propellant in a gun, there's several grams of propellant producing several grams of gasses, and until said gasses expand to the volume of several litres, however hot they will still be denser than air."
mechanical_gifs,2mkf2a,dizekat,1 point,Thu Nov 20 03:05:26 2014 UTC,But they are getting lighter than the surrounding gasses outside the gun. This would mean it is actively emitting xrays that are hitting the mechanism   Edit... Blast these slower sub's.. this post is a month old!

mechanical_gifs,2mkf2a,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Mon Jan 5 17:44:23 2015 UTC,Well... I'm not exactly saying that. I'm saying that IF this is actually an Xray that it would mean the gasses are producing xrays. Since that doesn't make sense it is likely that this is some other imaging modality.

mechanical_gifs,2mkf2a,Alacritous,2,Tue Nov 18 00:01:43 2014 UTC,Higher pressure doesn't necessarily mean higher density (which would increase the opacity to x-rays).  It is also caused by higher temperature.
mechanical_gifs,2mkf2a,identicalParticle,1 point,Tue Nov 18 06:05:34 2014 UTC,"Well, if there's several grams of propellant producing several grams of gasses, and air density is about 1.2 grams per litre, then said gasses will need to expand to the volume of several litres before they're less dense than air. Volume of the gun barrel and those chambers that lit up in the gif is definitely very short of several litres.   (US units: a gallon is about 3.7 litres, an ounce is about 30 grams)"

mechanical_gifs,2lzc55,OmniaMors,63,Tue Nov 11 18:46:35 2014 UTC,"Well lets see   plastic has a coefficient of friction with itself of about 0.2 it also has a melting point of about 175oC and a thermal capacity of about 1.6 Kj/KgoC we can assume there is a normal force of 1N between the surfaces we can also assume the surfaces rub at about 2 m/s   Well to melt 0.001kg of the plastic we need to increase it from 20oC by 155o. so we need 1.6*0.001kg*155 = 0.248kJ = 248J  The force of friction is Ff = 1*0.2 = 0.2N  we can divide the energy by the force to find the distance we need the plastic to drag the plastic distance = 248/0.2 = 1240m  dividing this by the speed we find that it will take 1240*2 = 620s ~ 10 minutes.  Now this makes a few assumptions that makes it a lot lower than it should be, like the lack of energy distributing away from plastic by convection and conduction. If i really had to find out and wasnt allowed to run tests; i would find the rate of energy getting transferred into the plastic and plug it into an FEM simulator. More thank likely you will find that the rate of energy being drawn out is fast enough that the plastic will never melt."

mechanical_gifs,2lvg50,hiroki_h,45,Tue Nov 11 04:52:34 2014 UTC,"This video highlights the concept of motor redundancy, which is a an important concept for human motor control. Basically, all of the joint angles being hit by the robot arm all result in the end effector being placed at the same point in 3D space. That is, each of those configurations is a ""redundant solution"" to the problem of ""get the tip of this arm into that position in 3D space."" For that task, there is only one measurement that matters, namely the distance between the end effector and the desired location. Any variability in this measurement is ""task relevant"" whereas variability in the upstream joints is ""task irrelevant"" as longs as the variability lies within the space defined by the redundant solutions. In this gif, you see the robot exhibiting extremely high task-irrelevant variability while maintaining near-zero task-relevant variability.   Human motor control exploits this distinction between task-relevant and task-irrelevant error. If you record people performing a rapid pointing task (say, touch a spot on a screen as many times as you can within 10sec), you'll find that they exhibit relatively high variability in their wrist, elbow, and shoulder (task-irrelevant variabilty), but relatively low variability in the distance between their finger and the target location (task-relevant).   One theory is that the because the human motor system is made up of noisy biological parts, there will ALWAYS be noise and variability in our movements. As such, our neuromotor system tries to funnel as much of that variability in to the redundant, task-irrelevant dimensions in order to minimize variability in the dimensions that actually matter for a given task."
mechanical_gifs,2lvg50,sandusky_hohoho,23,Mon Nov 10 18:05:54 2014 UTC,"Well, this machine has a 5DOF task (3x position, 2x orientation). So it has zero redundancy (I counted 5 degrees of freedom on the actual robot). Note: it doesn't need a 3rd orientation dof because you're ultimately controlling the angle of a line, and don't care if that line spins around its own axis.  Assuming that you only care about controlling position, then we have a redundant robot. Usually for robot arms we use a 6 or 7 DOF robot. A 7 DOF robot (using 7 joints) is going to be redundant for 6 DOF (every possible orientation and position in space) control."

mechanical_gifs,2lvg50,thepainteddoor,10,Mon Nov 10 22:09:03 2014 UTC,"He's talking about the fact that there are MANY combinations of arm positions that all can result in having the effector at the same location.   Well, this isn't exactly true because the vector of the laser beam is important. You must cut at right angles to the material, and this machine is made for cutting 3d forms which can exist in many angles. For instance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hp_DPEapzg&t=135"
mechanical_gifs,2lvg50,DeleteFromUsers,2,Mon Nov 10 22:33:59 2014 UTC,"True, although the orientation of the laser around its own axis doesn't matter, so long as it doesn't interfere with the object being worked on.

mechanical_gifs,2lvg50,utexaspunk,1 point,Tue Nov 11 00:51:22 2014 UTC,Yet it's not only the effector you need to position but also the rest of the body must rest in space unoccupied by the target
mechanical_gifs,2lvg50,Blissfull,1 point,Thu Nov 13 01:59:09 2014 UTC,"That's the point, though- you have to hit point X,Y,Z from angle N, but in one situation you may be unable to reach through coordinates A,B,C and another you can't go through coordinates D,E,F. Redundancy makes it possible to accommodate those varying requirements by having multiple ways of putting the effector in the same position. In one case you may be reaching in from below, another from above, another from the left, another from the right."
mechanical_gifs,2lvg50,utexaspunk,1 point,Thu Nov 13 02:18:51 2014 UTC,What I wonder in these kinds of pro industrial arms is wether path is precalculated or done on the fly by the control system

mechanical_gifs,2lkr9a,B0rax,28,Fri Nov 7 13:38:24 2014 UTC,"This, as far as I know, is called a gimbal mount. The actual mount for the camera has a gyroscope which measures the movement and the placement of the camera. The thing which the operator holds on to contains a motor for each axis. These motors are then controlled through a low latency interface, which keeps the camera in the desired position. It can also be programmed to allow movement, eg. To get steady, non shaky turning of the camera."
mechanical_gifs,2lkr9a,tehyosh,15,Fri Nov 7 13:45:09 2014 UTC,Feline technology
mechanical_gifs,2lkr9a,Mortbopet,16,Fri Nov 7 23:36:10 2014 UTC,"There are 2 Brushless motors mounted in the rig, one for each axis.  There are electronics with accelerometer and gyroscopes. It then measures the position of the rig in space and can compensate any unwanted movements with the brushless motors.  This happens very fast. You can get the electronics and the motors for about $200  It was mainly developed for multirotor vehicles for aerial filming."
mechanical_gifs,2lkr9a,B0rax,1 point,Fri Nov 7 13:45:10 2014 UTC,"There are 2 Brushless motors mounted in the rig, one for each axis.   if there are 2 motors and each axis uses one of those 2 motors, what happens if the camera moves in the 3rd dimension?"
mechanical_gifs,2lkr9a,Cley_Faye,6,Fri Nov 7 13:59:06 2014 UTC,"It does move in the 3rd (Z-axis) - so yes, there's 3 motors. The motor which is responsible for correcting Z axis movement is the one you see connecting to the camera mount, going up and down."
mechanical_gifs,2lkr9a,Deltigre,0,Fri Nov 7 14:09:12 2014 UTC,It does only compensate for 2 axis rotation.  you can build one with 3-axis compensation.

mechanical_gifs,2lkr9a,oneonetwooneonetwo,19,Fri Nov 7 17:24:42 2014 UTC,"I've used one.   It has a couple modes it can be used in.   The main mode is called Majestic. This locks the camera at a desired angle (level to horizon by default) and corrects for any rotational forces. In this mode it uses the top bar as a guide for panning. This means that you can use the camera to pan left to right and the gimbal will smooth it out.   There is an alternate mode of Majestic that allows the operator to control tilt as well. In this mode you basically use the top bar as a framing device. The gimbal will constantly try and stay square to the top bar (pan and tilting only, it always maintains a level to horizon rotation/dutch)  The third mode is controller mode. In this mode you can use a traditional RC transmitter to control panning tilting and rotating. The gimbals will keep the camera aligned with the controllers instructions. Meaning you can spin the top bar 360 degrees around but the camera will always face the same direction."
mechanical_gifs,2lkr9a,shim12,3,Fri Nov 7 20:00:13 2014 UTC,There's either a couple buttons on it to rotate or there's a person nearby controlling that.

Can a machine be built to pick and place each bottle into a box? Yes! Will it be able to do the quality control of a human checking each bottle before being shipped? Not without being wicked expensive. Hope that helps!
mechanical_gifs,2lalol,WTF_Tigers,8,Tue Nov 4 23:09:42 2014 UTC,"Do humans have time to check each bottle? I would guess that due to repetitiveness, they end up not being very consistent."
mechanical_gifs,2lalol,protestor,20,Wed Nov 5 03:39:24 2014 UTC,"You would be surprised at how fast people can tell something is off. It's mostly for minor defects, such as a botched label or dented bottle. A human isn't going to notice everything,  but it's a lot better for the price.   Edit: Minor compared to a sliced bottle, no label, or low product full, which would be mechanically kicked off the line in most production facilities."
mechanical_gifs,2lalol,WTF_Tigers,4,Wed Nov 5 04:42:40 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure what kind of food plant you work at but there's usually a separate person who does the inspection for quality control. Most workers can notice small things but ""quality control coordinators"" have the overall responsibility to make sure things are packed correctly, LoT codes printed correctly, distributed to the correct location for shipment, etc.   Source: I used to be that guy for a Wrigley food plant.  Oh yeah having quality control around is only more reasonable the more the WIP is handled by workers. The more automated the process is, less effort is needed to watch for quality (still required for final inspection but most cases the beginning isn't even watched)."
mechanical_gifs,2lalol,PM-Me_Your_TaTas,5,Wed Nov 5 05:17:43 2014 UTC,I'd imagine the don't have much to look for. Just if there is defect in the bottles. If there's a problem with the sauce it would probably get caught as a batch before bottling.

Stir until the first kernel pops, then reduce to med-low heat, throw on a lid, shake the pan until the popcorn is popping slower. Turn off stove but leave pan on burner. When popcorn is done popping, add salt and butter to taste in large bowl, and mix well.  This recipe will result in nearly perfect popped popcorn ratios. I usually average about 10 unpoppes pieces, and the flavor is awesome. The only change i ever make to this recipe if i want it a little different is to add tapatio instead.

If you haven't read about SAGE, you might find it interesting as another example of how difficult it was to build advanced real-time computing equipment out of pre-transistor technology.  As happens a lot with technology, the ""sweet spot"" of price/performance that makes sense for commercial adoption at scale is one thing, while the most advanced prototype still provides good ROI for military applications. So while the previous breakthrough is slowly becoming mainstream as the price comes down and production goes up, the military can justify gobs of R&D spending on the next big thing.

mechanical_gifs,2jregt,Skanky,2,Mon Oct 20 13:37:16 2014 UTC,"Pressure angle:       Pressure angle in relation to gear teeth, also known as the angle of obliquity,  is the angle between the tooth force and the gear wheel tangent. It is more precisely the angle at a pitch point between the line of pressure (which is normal to the tooth surface) and the plane tangent to the pitch surface. The pressure angle gives the direction normal to the tooth profile. The pressure angle is equal to the profile angle at the standard pitch circle and can be termed the ""standard"" pressure angle at that point. Standard values are 14.5, 20 and 25 degrees. Earlier gears with pressure angle 14.5 were commonly used because the cosine is larger for a smaller angle, providing more power transmission and less pressure on the bearing; however, teeth with smaller pressure angles are weaker. To run gears together properly their pressure angles must be matched.

mechanical_gifs,2jregt,YouMustChill,10,Mon Oct 20 15:53:54 2014 UTC,"Involute gears are actually low friction.  The contact is rolling, not sliding.  The gif does make it appear that there is sliding contact, but I think it's an illusion caused by the lines.  It's easier to see if you watch the tooth without the blue arrow in the gif (the tooth on the right gear meshing with the left)."
mechanical_gifs,2jregt,kokirijedi,2,Mon Oct 20 16:39:25 2014 UTC,Im more concerned about the low contact surface area causing high pressure and warping the teeth. Is there anything that keeps the contact area between the two higher to allow higher torque?
mechanical_gifs,2jregt,YouMustChill,3,Mon Oct 20 20:31:42 2014 UTC,"Not-an-expert answer: Helical gears offer more contact area, but then you get sliding.  You can also make the gears wider for more strength.    In reality though, it doesn't take massive gears to transmit power.  I made literally thousands of spur and worm gears for large industrial winches, and you'd be surprised how a small gear can transmit massive torque provided there isn't much shock loading."
mechanical_gifs,2jregt,kokirijedi,1 point,Mon Oct 20 21:32:29 2014 UTC,I'm sure I would be surprised! I appreciate the response
mechanical_gifs,2jregt,encaseme,7,Wed Oct 22 05:44:31 2014 UTC,"It's definitely one of the concerns. There are gear designs that are optimized for one or more concerns (friction, strength, wear, noise, etc)."
mechanical_gifs,2jregt,Barbarossa_,3,Mon Oct 20 16:10:21 2014 UTC,"The sliding increases from the center towards the tip and root. There is pure roling in the middle of the tooth, called the roll circle. Shorter teeth will have less sliding but lower contact ratio and there for lower strength.  Gears are fun!"

mechanical_gifs,2jnnxl,SenorPuff,6,Sun Oct 19 05:38:49 2014 UTC,"In normal circumstances, since the  whole car moves the same speed, when one wheel turns so does the other. But, for example, when one wheel is over ice and the other on pavement, only one wheel will turn. This is the flaw of an open differential and why limit slip and locking differentials are sometimes used instead."
mechanical_gifs,2jnnxl,dbmonkey,2,Sun Oct 19 04:04:30 2014 UTC,How does one limit slip? The only things I can conceive of are brakes or some other mechanism that would wear out over time.
mechanical_gifs,2jnnxl,SenorPuff,5,Sun Oct 19 04:57:59 2014 UTC,"Bingo.  Think about this: when the 2 shafts going to the wheels are not connected you have the slip issue. On the other hand, if you lock the 2 together, you will completely stop slip, but then you can't get around a corner. The limit slip differential (lsd) finds a compromise by applying a breaking force between the 2 shafts.  I would assume they wear out over time, but I'm pretty sure they last more than 100,000 miles for most cars."
mechanical_gifs,2jnnxl,dbmonkey,2,Sun Oct 19 05:50:39 2014 UTC,"I figured as much, but what mechanisms do they use to apply that braking torque? Friction generates heat which would degrade the differential oil. Conventional friction brakes also usually need replaced a few times over the life of the vehicle"
mechanical_gifs,2jnnxl,SenorPuff,1 point,Sun Oct 19 06:08:22 2014 UTC,"Most of them use a mechanical locking mechanism to lock the two axles together.  Springs will move outwards when high rotational forces are applied, pushing pins into holes that lock the two axles together.  When the rotational forces lower, the springs retract and unlock the axles.  Other lockers use air to push pins in place, but those are usually meant for off-road dedicated vehicles.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locking_differential"
mechanical_gifs,2jnnxl,Clegko,2,Sun Oct 19 09:47:48 2014 UTC,"Locking differential:       A locking differential, differential lock, diff lock or locker is a variation on the standard automotive differential. A locking differential may provide increased traction compared to a standard, or ""open"" differential by restricting each of the two wheels on an axle to the same rotational speed without regard to available traction or differences in resistance seen at each wheel.  A locking differential is designed to overcome the chief limitation of a standard open differential by essentially ""locking"" both wheels on an axle together as if on a common shaft. This forces both wheels to turn in unison, regardless of the traction (or lack thereof) available to either wheel individually.  When the differential is unlocked (open differential), it allows each wheel to rotate at different speeds (such as when negotiating a turn), thus avoiding tire scuffing. An open (or unlocked) differential always provides the same torque (rotational force) to each of the two wheels, on that axle. So although the wheels can rotate at different speeds, they apply the same rotational force, even if one is entirely stationary, and the other spinning. (Equal torque, unequal rotational speed).

mechanical_gifs,2jbady,YouMustChill,2,Wed Oct 15 20:12:32 2014 UTC,A certain Ferrari comes to mind
mechanical_gifs,2jbady,Aratix,1 point,Thu Oct 23 05:54:57 2014 UTC,"Oh crap, forgot about Ferrari.  The only boxer I can think of is the BB512.  Is there a newer one as well?"
mechanical_gifs,2jbady,YouMustChill,2,Thu Oct 23 12:13:21 2014 UTC,"It's successor, the Testarossa"
mechanical_gifs,2jbady,Aratix,2,Thu Oct 23 13:51:26 2014 UTC,"You know, I thought they were V12s.  And I even had a poster of one as a kid.  Thanks."
mechanical_gifs,2jbady,YouMustChill,2,Thu Oct 23 14:11:33 2014 UTC,Its one of the reasons the Testarossa is my favorite classic Ferrari.
mechanical_gifs,2jbady,Aratix,1 point,Thu Oct 23 14:13:53 2014 UTC,"Shit, a car that I grew up with is a classic.  Way to make a guy feel old."

mechanical_gifs,2jbady,foshizzler,1 point,Wed Oct 15 23:34:06 2014 UTC,Can someone explain why Subaru is better than other cars in terms of racing and performance?
mechanical_gifs,2jbady,varunmaster,1 point,Thu Oct 16 12:32:35 2014 UTC,"It's not.  They have good success in rally including a brief period of domination in the Colin McRae era, but they're not any better overall than any other manufacturer.  Citroen actually has been the most dominant in WRC the last decade or so.  WRX fanboys will tell you otherwise, of course."
mechanical_gifs,2jbady,YouMustChill,2,Thu Oct 16 15:51:46 2014 UTC,"The VWs are definitely looking good these past 2 years though with Sébastien Ogier at the wheel, and Hyundai also has put up a pretty good fight despite how young the team is.  With that said, the competitiveness of Subaru is definitely hindered when Subaru doesn't have a car in the specs required for WRC.   ""The team was historically an extremely strong one, competing in the WRC longer than any other manufacturer team in their current form. It has won the manufacturers' championship three times, in (1995, 1996, and 1997), and the drivers' championship three times, in 1995, 2001, and 2003.... ...The team withdrew from WRC competition at the end of the 2008 season due to widespread economic downturn."" - Wikipedia Subaru World Rally Team  Subaru joined Rally America in 2001, and has since won the driver's championship with Mark Lovell in 2001, Travis Pastrana in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, and David Higgins 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. - Subaru Rally Team USA  TL:DR Subaru is known for rally, is good at rally, and wins at rally. They do one thing and do it well. There's no one spec that makes Subaru unique, other than that World Rally Blue and the driver behind the wheel."

mechanical_gifs,2j8zgf,moosemccutty,1 point,Wed Oct 15 10:12:15 2014 UTC,I believe this is chrochet
mechanical_gifs,2j8zgf,rousbound,2,Wed Oct 15 02:11:43 2014 UTC,It's hooks (similar to crochet hooks) but the fabric produced is a knit fabric.

mechanical_gifs,2j3goo,uluru,15,Mon Oct 13 06:42:43 2014 UTC,"If you can get a hold of it, the UK TV show ""Wheeler Dealers"" just did a restoration on a Z1 that shows them retensioning the belt drive system in one of the doors. I think it was either the last episode, or the one before last.  Edit: photo no 5 shows the door (and entire car) with the body / door skin removed. http://www.discoveryuk.com/web/wheeler-dealers/photos/bmw-z1/"
mechanical_gifs,2j3goo,zzpza,10,Mon Oct 13 07:12:23 2014 UTC,Good tip. Looks like it's Season 11 Episode 12 for anyone that wanted to download it.  Here's a snippet of the finished result from their channel if anyone wants to see the doors in action while actually driving.
mechanical_gifs,2j3goo,c-fox,2,Mon Oct 13 07:18:07 2014 UTC,"The .gif BMW has a gap above the window which Ed fixed on the show, by tensioning a belt."

mechanical_gifs,2j3goo,GRadde,8,Mon Oct 13 12:35:12 2014 UTC,"Well, it didn't exactly catch on, looking back 25 years later!  What would you say the biggest flaws would be with the design?"
mechanical_gifs,2j3goo,madworld,10,Mon Oct 13 12:39:03 2014 UTC,"The biggest flaw is that you have to have an empty compartment in the sill for the door to slide into. This makes for a whole host of challenges concerning crash safety, for one. In addition, this was why they had to have such a high sill: in its opened position, the door could only be half as high up from the bottom of the frame as in the closed position, since the other half had to fit as well.   Besides the engineering challenges, it would have been very uncomfortable getting in and out because you'd have to climb over the window edge every time, with little else to support yourself with (and you'd likely have to support yourself on the edge because of the high sill and low seat)."
mechanical_gifs,2j3goo,c0de76,4,Mon Oct 13 13:14:08 2014 UTC,Not to mention all the moving parts that if they failed would mean not being able to get into your car.

mechanical_gifs,2j3goo,bobjohnsonmilw,25,Mon Oct 13 06:54:22 2014 UTC,"Sure looks that way, but the majority of the door and window are merely hiding in the abnormally tall sill when they ""melt"" like that.   Perhaps this image will help illustrate how they hide within the sill :)"
