CodeGeass,3e1eaf,Asianbau5,14,Tue Jul 21 05:23:44 2015 UTC,"She did forget about it. The thing about the Geass is, when you use it for small things such as - Answering someones question, you forget it since it is not long term. The only thing that is left, is a jump from memory to memory. Meaning that part of her memory is missing. Which is why she didn't remember that, Lelouch was actually Zero."

However, this could be explained by a fact pointed out earlier in the show: using Geass causes someone to not only forget that they received and executed the order, but also causes them to lose some memories from shortly before and after as well:   ""[...] a subject appears to have no memory of events before, during, or after the power is used. I think this is due to damage caused by the Geass interfering with the brain of the subject."""

Is this a potential plot hole or something? I'm surprised at how little this is spoken about. Is it just super obvious and I'm missing something? The Wiki says she was paralyzed WHEN her mother was assassinated. But obviously no one was there but V.V., Marianne, and Anya.  This is so crazy to me and I'm so mad that I can't comprehend it!!

Like stolen or something. And tbh, i got this feeling like he cannot command as lelouche but only give the order to die. One way or another, he is something that is not approved by the celestial watchers. Im really curious what the author got there for us  But strictly thinking, their personalites do seem alike.

CodeGeass,3dm1rh,Browseitall,3,Fri Jul 17 12:15:52 2015 UTC,"I know he didn't know his geass was active.  That part is obvious and I can ride with that.  What I can't believe is why lelouch would so carelessly say something so stupid.  Why would he even tell Euphy he had this power?  He hasn't told ANYBODY of this power except Mao/CC and they pretty much just knew he had it because A. Mao reads minds, and B. CC gave him the Geass.  He didn't tell Nunnally, who he was so much closer to than Euphy, or any of the Black Knights who were his closest subordinates, but he'd randomly out of the blue tell Euphy?  A long lost family member he recently met like 3-4 times after a 7 year period of hiding?  Also with the geass activation, why did it take effect immediately and why couldn't Lelouch give out more orders?  It's been shown on multiple occasions that Lelouch could give out some pretty complex orders with his Geass, but Euphy just ignored the rest of Lelouch's orders.  And why say ""Kill all Japanese specifically?  Sure, maybe he was going for the absurd but this is too much.  It would be more believable if he said something stupid like ""Hop on one foot"" or ""Start singing wildly"" as a joke.  If anything, Lelouch would have said ""Kill all Britanians."" instead because he actually hates those guys.  He had no motivation to say ""Kill all Japanese."", even subconsciously.  There's really no way I can look at it besides a stupid line written in to further the plot."
CodeGeass,3dm1rh,Sextus_Rex,3,Fri Jul 17 20:14:51 2015 UTC,"I had to take a break from the show after I watched this episode.  You managed to take my jumbled up thoughts and put them into words.  There is no way ""kill all the Japanese"" would be the first joke to come to his mind.  And I agree with you, there isn't even a reason Lelouch would be telling Euphy about his power in the first place.  It just seems so unnatural, especially coming from Lelouch.  The fact that Lelouch's little ""joke"" conveniently allowed the story to progress so far was what made it seem so stupid.  I'm not sure how far you've watched, so potential spoilers ahead.  Lelouch seemed to love Euphemia just as much as he loved Nunally.  Despite this, and some of you may disagree with me, I didn't really feel that killing Euphy had a lasting impact on his character.  He kinda just said ""What a shame"" and rolled with it.  It had more of an effect on Suzaku, who had only met her recently, than it did on Lelouch, who pretty much grew up with her.  As for the Geass activation, some of the mysteries surrounding it are answered in the 2nd season, but the way it registers in the victim's mind is still pretty ambiguous.  I'm thinking along the same lines of /u/SirKendrick.  The small pause after he delivered the command must have triggered it taking effect."
CodeGeass,3dm1rh,SirKendrick,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:04:14 2015 UTC,"Before the events with Euphy, Lelouch didn't need to worry about every command he said, only when he personally activated his geass. But with the events that happened prior to him giving that joking command, C2 and Suzaku had an event happen which I think linked to Lelouch's geass becoming active all the time.   C2 warned him about this as well, giving Mao as an example. If you use it too much it will become active all the time.  He didn't necessarily tell Euphy about his geass, he just said he could make anyone obey him if he really wanted, any person would think you were just full of yourself. He adored Euphy and said himself she was the first person he ever really loved.      In regards to saying multiple commands it doesn't seem to work that way. When Lelouch uses his geass on a person it permanently rewires their mind to follow that command. There has been times where he has asked mutiple questions to someone under his geass but he commanded them to answer all his questions. Every other command has been in one sentence or in a group. After he finishes one command or chain of commands he is unable to stop them until they complete his command(s). In Euphys case he said the one command and paused, which it term stopped him from be able to give her any more commands.  This part of the season is vital in the story, if it hadn't happened Lelouch won't have lost his mind and became the demon he was in the end. Just like all of use we make mistakes, Lelouch's was just much bigger than ours by joking about killing all the Japanese. He knew the risks of using geass, and he had to deal with the consequences of it as well."
CodeGeass,3dm1rh,BlitheCynic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:55:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing that the plot twist shouldn't have happened, just that the way it was delivered was sloppy and sounded like it was from a ninth grader's fan fiction.  Here's a scenario that could have happened in place of that scene with Euphy and it would still propel the plot, but it would make a million times more sense.  Lelouch enters the room with Euphy and begins to yell at her because of the stunt she's pulling.  They get into an argument with Euphy saying she did it so they could go back to the past and all that while Lelouch counters that this wouldn't solve anything and blah blah blah.  Heated words are exchanged as they both try and explain why they're right.  They can maybe reconcile during the argument, but the plot twist comes in here: Lelouch tells Euphy ""You're going to kill all Japanese.""  He means that this special zone will spell the end of Japanese independence because it's not a real nation.  Of course the Geass activates and boom we move on to the bloodshed.  This whole scenario, if fleshed out with actual dialogue would make tons more sense than Lelouch just derping and saying ""Kill all Japanese.""  That's what I mean by bad writing.  The current argument for the scene is that ""Oh he just made a stupid mistake because he's human.""  True, he's human, but he's also not one to make stupid comments out of the blue like that.  It doesn't fit his character.  Everything he does always has a reason behind it, emotional or tactical.  Anyway, I was disappointed in the execution of that scene.  Everything leading up to that moment was so carefully thought up and planned out and everything flowed smoothly.  Watching it felt like I was dining at a five star restaurant and after eating 5 courses of wonderful food, I was served plain jello for desert.  It just broke the fourth wall for me."

So many things point to that  Oh and I'm going with the theory that he has his Code from Charles, not from C2. Makes it way more reasonable for me and I like to think about Lelouch and C2 being together forever"

CodeGeass,3cgisy,CasualTyrant,8,Wed Jul 8 02:29:26 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that the creator stated that Lelouch is dead, however, I personally feel like he is alive because of how CC reacts at the end.

CodeGeass,3cgisy,pax_47,3,Tue Jul 7 22:20:40 2015 UTC,"I kind of view it as CC mourning that Lelouch is sacrificing his current life entirely, like how Suzaku did when he faked his death."
CodeGeass,3cgisy,trowawufei,3,Wed Jul 8 00:05:30 2015 UTC,"Or R.R. aka R2, the name for season 2 :o"
CodeGeass,3cgisy,Polantaris,14,Mon Jul 13 22:19:27 2015 UTC,"Alive. He took his code from CC. Here's why I think people can give up their code and not die, just become mortal:   VV was already fatally injured when Charles took his code. VV would've died no matter which theory is correct. And he did survive for a little bit of time without his code- he didn't die instantly. The priestess has a wound on her after she passes the code on to CC. Some may think she injured herself before passing because this is required for passing the Code, however CC was passing hers on to Charles and she wasn't injured. So I think she committed suicide after passing on the code- which is consistent with the mortal theory.   Lelouch must give up contact with everyone he ever loved. He will watch them die and be forced to live forever- a miserable existence, as CC has made it clear. It is his way of fulfilling his last promise: that CC would die with a smile on her face. She's restored to mortal and he accompanies her through the rest of her life (60 years or so), showering her with love in a life with meaning.  Honestly I really, really do not want to think that Lelouch broke the promise that pulled CC back from suicide. He gave her mortality and love, and paid the ultimate price for that.  Also worth noting is that CC never talked to a dead person, as Marianne's consciousness was still alive when they communicated. So ""she was talking to dead-Lelouch"" isn't exactly the strongest of theories..."
CodeGeass,3cgisy,Sextus_Rex,2,Tue Jul 7 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"See I disagree that Lelouch has C.C.'s code. I think the point of the encounter in C's World is that he teaches C.C. that she doesn't really want to die, but just that she never really had anything because she intentionally disconnected herself from others due to the expectation that they will leave her. Remember that her Geass had to do with making everyone love her, which definitely scarred her when it became too much. Similar to how Mao went insane over all the voices in his head at all times. I believe that that's what allows Lelouch to defeat Charles in C's World. When Charles grabs Lelouch's neck with his palm, the palm that contained Charles's Code, I believe it transferred to Lelouch while he was dying (not that his death was caused by the Code transferring, but by him being rejected within C's World). With C.C. realizing that there's something in life other than death, she lives together with Lelouch.  I agree that V.V.'s death wasn't necessarily from Charles taking his code. It can easily just be because Charles was a prick and after taking the code left V.V. at the brink of death. C.C.'s Priestess forced C.C. to attack her, if I remember correctly. Why is unknown, perhaps the Priestess had the same wish C.C. did and after transferring her code forced C.C., as essentially a confused child, to kill her."
CodeGeass,3cgisy,Bigman61,3,Tue Jul 14 23:39:17 2015 UTC,"If Lelouch really is dead, then I'd be sort of disappointed with the writer.  That would mean he left C.C.'s story unfinished.  No one has taken her code yet, so her wish hasn't been fulfilled.  That's why I think Lelouch either took Charles' code, so he could live forever with C.C., or took C.C.'s code, to fulfill the contract and give her a meaningful life."
CodeGeass,3cgisy,liandakilla,6,Thu Jul 9 21:16:20 2015 UTC,I prefer to believe he's dead. The entire thing about lelouch was he was sacrificing himself to rid the world of violence. Everything he did was about making the world safe and peaceful for his sister. And he accomplishes this by becoming the embodiment of evil and the enemy.  It ruins his sacrifice for me if he's alive.
CodeGeass,3cgisy,QuadnaryCode,4,Tue Jul 7 23:55:49 2015 UTC,Yeah the story is just less compelling unless he actually dies. The story was really great and dying for the world has this nice finishing touch. There is awfully much evidence he is alive but i will always deny it.
CodeGeass,3cgisy,non_clever_name,3,Wed Jul 8 14:31:53 2015 UTC,"There is also evidence that he's dead, though, such as Word of the Writer being the most obvious one, then again its just from the Writer Ichiro Okouchi.   If I can recall correctly, Goro Taniguchi (director) did say that it was an ambiguous ending."
CodeGeass,3cgisy,fo_rev_er,2,Fri Jul 10 02:18:57 2015 UTC,"OK, so I literally just finished R2. (...I balled my eyes out....) My thoughts are still racing. What a story. I didn't think I liked anime.  Naturally, it does seem less compelling if he lives. Or so I first thought. Tragic hero stories are always so cheesy if the hero gets away at the end, right? But consider: if he is still alive, he can never reveal who he is, he can never associate with his old friends, he can never be with Nunally again. If he is to ever reveal himself, the world will realize it was an illusion and peace will be destroyed. I don't think it necessarily invalidates his sacrifice for him to be alive. Given his general view on death it may even be a greater curse for him to live on.  Considering he did kill Charles I assume he'd have Charles's Code (though I guess that's unclear).  I like the sacrifice of death, but I also dislike how it would be incomplete for him to die without either taking Charles's Code or fulfilling his contract with C.C and taking her Code. I really haven't made up my mind yet. I do love the ambiguity of the ending, so I may not even need to ever make up my mind about it."
CodeGeass,3cgisy,Bacon_Falcon,2,Mon Jul 13 03:20:31 2015 UTC,"there's another way to look at it that doesn't detract from his sacrifice, with him still being physically alive...his life as ""lelouch"" ended.  he can never be with his beloved sister or friends again, and must watch the world go on without him from the shadows.  i feel like living that way would hurt more than dying, but it was the sacrifice he made.  he does have CC still in this theory, so not a bad consolation prize"
CodeGeass,3cgisy,in0ri,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:53:14 2015 UTC,"Plus it also really fits with the whole identity theme, like Zero, Suzaku's ""death"", removal of titles, and so many more."

Not after his last words to suzaku and about how suzaku will live on as zero and about how it is also a curse for suzaku.

CodeGeass,3cgisy,mikebalzich,2,Thu Jul 9 11:32:30 2015 UTC,There's an abridged version of season 2 that has CC confirming that Lelouche died that day. Also there an audio drama called Lelouche's miraculous birthday or something like that where it shows him as a ghost basicly confirming again that he is dead. As much as I liked the open ended question at the end there has been an official answer from sunrise so its pretty much case closed.
CodeGeass,3cgisy,QuadnaryCode,3,Wed Jul 8 08:07:41 2015 UTC,Are either of those exactly considered canon though?
CodeGeass,3cgisy,GuitarBOSS,2,Wed Jul 8 13:15:22 2015 UTC,They were both made by Sunrise so I would image so.
CodeGeass,3cgisy,scott66313,4,Wed Jul 8 13:30:35 2015 UTC,"It is said that the Miraculous Birthday, or Kiseki no Birthday is actually just fanservice, or rather an omake.  Just because its made by the Studio that created the series does not mean it is canon.  For the abridged, where did you get it? It's probably the interview from writer of Code Geass Ichiro Okouchi saying Lelouch is dead, NOT C.C.. If its fan abridged, ie like Code Geass The Abridged Series, its NOT CANON.  Quoted from TV Tropes' Bonus Material page, which is what an omake and what ""The Miraculous Birthday"" is.   If this extra material is another story in the universe, it generally doesn't interact with the primary plot of the work, and is seen as ""stand-alone"" material.

The last thing she says at the end of the second season is that he died happy that day.
CodeGeass,3cgisy,QuadnaryCode,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:31:17 2015 UTC,"Since its abridged, I highly doubt that it's made by Sunrise, or any of the main producers. It could just be fan made.  Also, although Ichiro Okouchi said that Lelouch is dead, we could just say that ""Lelouch was reborn into R.R.""  I also never see it anywhere in Ending Discussions, and your probably the first one to bring it up.  Did the Abridged version look like this? Or something along the lines of this?"
CodeGeass,3cgisy,QuadnaryCode,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:20:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what the Abridged version looks like. It's made by sunrise, it says so in the wikipedia page. the video is the ending of the abridged series without any of the quotes, it has the voice actor of CC in the end so unless this is some expensive fan made abridged series or it was actually made by the company. It's never been brought up before because Reddit rarely does any research and likes to talk out their ass. It's been brought up before on other forum discussions and being a huge fan of the series I stumbled upon it about a year ago."
CodeGeass,3cgisy,Muddaawsome,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:06:04 2015 UTC,"It actually has a wikipedia page? Give me a link. Wikipedia however is not exactly a credible source.  Although it is possible that C.C. just thinks Lelouch is dead, considering that the so called ""Original Japanese Ending"" is a hoax, and the driver could be someone that isn't Lelouch.  Is it actually C.C. voice acting?   In the end however, Lelouch did intend to die, so he was unaware of himself having an inactive Code, if he did get it from Charles. An Immortal Lelouch, or in this case R.R., would be an unintended side effect.  Someone here said before that an ambiguous ending is also a good marketing strategy, it keeps Code Geass at least quite popular up to this day due to the big question of Lelouch's fate, and the endless debating of it.    Oh, and if this Abridged version is actually canon, it might go against Goro Taniguchi's decision of making the ending Ambiguous."

CodeGeass,3c6oxr,herrycopper,3,Sun Jul 5 20:58:04 2015 UTC,"I had no idea there was going to be a 5th episode, I'm sad now."
CodeGeass,3c6oxr,dc880610,3,Sun Jul 5 14:31:49 2015 UTC,"But at least we have an exact release date now. It seems like delays occur more often when the release is far-off and ambiguous, like ""fall 2015"" (the original release ""date"")."
CodeGeass,3c6oxr,trowawufei,2,Sun Jul 5 16:33:51 2015 UTC,What a twist!
CodeGeass,3c5y1i,Arcvalons,3,Sun Jul 5 03:24:12 2015 UTC,"You're kinda spoiling episode 3 of Akito... Might want to delete this thread, title it something more open-ended, and label it with spoilers.  That said, there were a few interesting things in episode 3 of Akito that I'm surprised people aren't really talking about. They just might end up covering a lot of history and background that was left out of the main series."
CodeGeass,3c5y1i,dc880610,2,Sun Jul 5 04:00:18 2015 UTC,I found it interesting as well.  When i rewatched it for the second time it made me do a second take.  I'd wish and hope that they made a new season even if it continued in a different era or described a different portion of the world in which Code Geass resides in.
CodeGeass,3c2qvl,dc880610,5,Sat Jul 4 05:25:48 2015 UTC,"Will this be the last episode, or is there more coming out? I've been waiting for it to finish before starting."
CodeGeass,3c2qvl,Foxdude28,5,Sat Jul 4 07:12:26 2015 UTC,"From the article, ""The series was originally slated for four episodes, but Sunrise producer Yoshitaka Kawaguchi announced last month that the project will have a fifth episode. The fifth episode will be titled ""Itoshiki Mono-tachi e"" (To Those Who are Precious), and is slated to premiere this fall."""

CodeGeass,3c0d1d,dc880610,2,Fri Jul 3 19:55:08 2015 UTC,Agreed. Akito would spoil a bit of stuff revealed in R2 if you hadn't seen R2 yet.

CodeGeass,3bxy53,ElementalSB,6,Sat Jul 4 00:02:48 2015 UTC,"There was a video called 'Top 50 anime boobs' or along that line but the video was actually a click bait and had a picture of Cory Baxter from the Disney Channel TV show 'Cory In The House'.

CodeGeass,3buf0o,betafish27,7,Thu Jul 2 06:10:41 2015 UTC,"Very similar to the popular 4chan post about why lelouch is alive. I'm a believer in it, since the second big sticking point of the show was that he had to fulfill his contract to C2 and I don't see him going back on that. Also she mentions there are always two codes. And the best way to ensure lasting peace is to be there to make sure of it, isn't it?"
CodeGeass,3buf0o,LeftyLamb,2,Thu Jul 2 07:39:56 2015 UTC,We might have hard evidence when <Spoilers Akito OVAs:>

CodeGeass,3br8gt,DrummerAkali,2,Wed Jul 1 16:19:35 2015 UTC,Seeing Kingsley made me think so much of the fanfiction Dauntless. Glorious.
CodeGeass,3br8gt,AskPortalPonies,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:26:23 2015 UTC,Read it. Loved it. Shame Allora Gale has left it in hiatus.

CodeGeass,3br8gt,AskPortalPonies,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:43:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and Lelouch of Britannia. There is something I noticed though, even when working for Britannia, Lelouch's personality is pretty much unchanged, and his tactics and all that are similar to Zero's. But these fanfic authors make him seem more like a Black-dressed Schneizel."
CodeGeass,3br8gt,Arcvalons,2,Sun Jul 5 03:20:56 2015 UTC,"After that debacle with Shaing, I think this may be the last we see of Julius and bodyguard. The asian with overflowing swag just seems to be killing it this episode! He single handedly dominated Euro B politics. Julius's performance was superb as well. Hearing Jun Fukuyuma's voice brought back shivers I haven't heard in years! However, Julius's multiple personality disorder seems to have left him incapable of serving Big Daddy's purposes in the land of Mother Russia.  It can be hypothesized that the White Knight secretly left with his charge after a deal with the asian swag to fix Julius's broken eye-patch back in the Britannian Homeland. Just my two cents on this."
CodeGeass,3br8gt,Kalseru70,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:29:29 2015 UTC,I imagine Julius will do something of importance towards the end of episode 4 that will have some lasting impact on R2.
CodeGeass,3br8gt,pspiq5,2,Thu Jul 2 16:11:35 2015 UTC,"Man, I thought the first half of the show was going to bring some tight packed action at the end. It did, but still.  Someone needs to get Bill Gates or whoever in order to fund Code Geass. We need a remake. We need more of this side series. We need more Code Geass related stuff.  How does Shin know Lelouch? Just based off the words Nunnally? Or did his eyepatch being taken off made Shin remember a picture of Lelouch.  Who is the woman that came out of the computer screen, lol. Is this another Code Bearer? Does the Euro guy have Geass too? Implied but never seen his power yet.   All Lelouch has to do is kill Alice and then Shin would go berserk or something.   Why did Suzaku leave the room with Shin and Lelouch? What was the thought process there? Was it for the cinematic sun rays through the window.   Man, so many questions.   I enjoyed this episode but, man oh man, I really don't want to wait another year or so for the next episode. I need my Code Geass fix. I need it bad.   Spinzaku returns with stellar animation. The Order of Michael girl got spared? Who are those people following CC. Man, I just need to know all of this. Why gotta be yearly episodes. I need more   of the Code Geass universe. I need more."
CodeGeass,3br8gt,Nyet13,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:33:37 2015 UTC,"I really don't want to wait another year or so for the next episode.   Won't be nearly that long: next episode debuts in Japan in two days, July 4th."
CodeGeass,3br8gt,dc880610,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:00:27 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Suzaku couldn't fight all of the Knights in that small room without endangering the life of Lelouch.  And I imagine Suzaku could do some of his unrealistic sonic speed acrobatic stuff if he really needed to save him.
CodeGeass,3br8gt,pspiq5,2,Thu Jul 2 16:15:27 2015 UTC,"I truly hope Sunrise continues to add to the Code Geass franchise instead of investing in 27 Gundam adaptations.   As a fan of Gundam and Geass, I'd be fine with both. But it's more likely they'll continue doing Gundam since it sells Gunpla."
CodeGeass,3br8gt,JealotGaming,4,Thu Jul 2 12:07:22 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't like this ep.  I really just didn't like the beginning, kinda a waist of time but I can see they were buliding the characters up. Still it was pretty annoying. Then after they wasted all that time we get a little action and another cliff hanger.  It wasn't great cause it was a lot of step up for 4, which isn't to say it was terrible."
CodeGeass,3br8gt,FuajiOfLebouf,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:13:10 2015 UTC,awesome ep... now to wait another two years for the next

But i feel like there is a lot of plot threads up in the air now, and i am interested to see whether the manage to pull it all together. The plot is definitely mysteries upon mysteries, but they can't draw it out too long.  also what do people think Shin Hyuga Shing's deal is?"
CodeGeass,3br8gt,mic1402,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:33:42 2015 UTC,Is Kingsley aka Lelouch going to be apart of the 4th and 5th of this series? or was he just making an appearance and that was it.
CodeGeass,3br8gt,DopeN1nja,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:01:04 2015 UTC,"This episode was really a build up, with nothing really interesting happening until the last 15 minutes. I'm expecting the last episode to blow me away. The  Kingsly debacle and Lancelot battle had me more hype than anything that had happened in the story so far.   Hopefully the last episode is more than an hour, cause I can't see them resolving everything in that amount of time."
CodeGeass,3br8gt,pspiq5,2,Thu Jul 2 16:08:31 2015 UTC,Extended to 5 episodes now.
CodeGeass,3br8gt,Kalseru70,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"Just clearing this up because I secretly don't want the answer to be yes, did Shin kill Alice (cause her to kill herself) at the end of the episode?"
CodeGeass,3br8gt,blazedancer1997,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:09:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for what I now realize (thanks to removing my Spoiler seems like a troll thread.  And yeah, after watching it again the episode has a definitely awkward pacing and, although the animation was great, the story did feel a little lacking.  I don't know if that's because I didn't rewatch the previous episodes in order to remember what's going on but Akito, for a title character, doesn't really feel of significance to the overall plot, we see flashes of his personality but it doesn't fit with the justification the show tries to give us for it.  The old lady thing while fun was still pure fanservice and plot padding for an episode that clearly needed more exposition. I know this is the big mystery of Akito The Exiled but we have no idea what Shin's geass actually does or even what he wants.   There are 3 episodes left in this series I think and so far it's been really hard to care for what's going on in Europe or Akito himself. It feels odd but I'm still hoping for an R2 final episode-like twist to end it with a very illuminating bang."

He definitely would have aided Marianne.  Marianne was only ""alive"" thanks to an ongoing geass ability, shown by the occasional red circles, so if it was cancelled she would have died.  Lelouch didn't take the king because he refused to allow Schneizel to dictate his actions. He wanted to be the one in control even if it meant passing an opportunity for victory."
CodeGeass,3bbiqc,heidurzo,2,Mon Jun 29 05:26:13 2015 UTC,"To answer the last question: I think Lelouch was just to proud to take any opening Schneizel gave him on purpose, he also possibly suspected that Schneizel had some plan he wasn't aware of, so he really didn't want to follow whatever Schneizel was doing."

CodeGeass,3atm61,DarkPhantom747,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:55:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe so. I don't recall reading that exact ""article,"" though. Maybe I'm just recalling someone's second-hand account of it.  But I'm a little suspicious of that ""article."" First of all, it's copied-and-pasted (strike 1) from some person's summary/personal interpretation (strike 2) of a translation (strike 3) of a Japanese article, the original text of which isn't provided (strike 4). That's quite a few steps away from an original source, so I'm taking it with a grain of salt.  Plus there were some other strange things in that post that I've never heard before. Season 1 was originally going to end on episode 23, not 25? I haven't watched Code Geass in some time, but that sounds off. I seem to remember everything continuing to build, all the way up to the end of episode 25.  Plus, there was that quote about how the end of episode 25 was originally intended to be the final ending of the show? That just sounds very off. How could that cliffhanger possibly work as a series finale?  I would be interested in reading an exact translation of the original article. Kinda suspicious of this source you gave. (Nothing against you, of course. Thanks for sharing.)  I definitely agree with you on your last point: I had no idea people hated the ending of R2. Maybe people were just upset that their precious Lelouch died? I loved the character of Lelouch as much as anyone, but I thought killing him off as the ending was appropriate and well-done. And I like that it was open-ended. But yeah, there was quite a bit of rage in that link you shared. That's yet another reason I'm skeptical of the interview."
CodeGeass,3atm61,dc880610,5,Sun Jun 28 01:44:49 2015 UTC,"Are you the...?   Perhaps, ""Are you the one I connected with at Narita?"" Only thing I could think of."
CodeGeass,3aplwa,LelouchViBrittania,15,Mon Jun 22 13:55:42 2015 UTC,"Lelouch created a scenario where the majority of the population, including those in power, wanted lasting peace, which should theoretically hold for at least the tenure of his little sister, Nunally. There is also this as the theory where the plot makes a tiny bit of sense."
CodeGeass,3aplwa,jimaboi,7,Mon Jun 22 14:10:24 2015 UTC,i prefer that ending so its the one i will believe. lol. i felt like lelouch didnt have to die. he just had to be percieved as dead and never return to the public. maybe change his identity
CodeGeass,3aplwa,megacookie,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:53:30 2015 UTC,"I think he also wanted to repent for all of his actions that lead him to become a hated dictator in the first place. He's killed a lot of people, and his mind control Geass is the ultimate dirty tool of manipulation, it's practically mind rape. He also feels guilty for what happened to Euphemia, how probably the kindest and most gentle member of his wretched family had to slaughter thousands of civilians she was trying to protect against her will and was post-humously branded as ""Euphienator"" and ""Princess Massacre"". Lelouch's famous line ""The only ones who should kill are those willing to be killed"" isn't just a badass catchphrase but a pretty central theme that he intended to live up to. Also, only Suzaku was in on his plan from the beginning, and while they reconciled enough to work together, he never really forgave Euphemia's murder and only went along with it because it promised the punishment they both deserved. If he knew or even suspected that Lelouch wanted to fake his death there's no way he'd go through with it. Finally, there was too much riding at stake for a death the public might suspect was faked or staged, it would completely throw the Zero Requiem in jeapordy and only lead to further distrust and conflict."
CodeGeass,3aplwa,jimaboi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:40:16 2015 UTC,"susaku wouldnt have had to know about his immortality. but your explanation does make perfect sense and throw my thinking into question. i think its just too sad to have another death like such after so many sad deaths, no matter the meaning of it. maybe im just too emotionally involved.  last night i dreamed i had geass and i was going to have to sleep forever(dont know how i came to the conclusion)"
CodeGeass,3aplwa,megacookie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:17:36 2015 UTC,"I think there's just too much anime (and other mediums) out there where important characters seemingly die or really should die but survive because the show just isn't willing to kill them. It takes the impact and meaning out of death if you can just think ""it's ok they'll be back in the next scene with lots of bandages or something"".   Having him actually die is more tragic but I feel more genuine. If Code Geass didn't end with Lelouch's death (or at least highly debated presumed death) but in fact showed him clearly alive after a fake assassination it wouldn't nearly be as memorable and impactful a finale. Code Geass is one of my favorite anime largely because they had the balls to pull off an ending like that so well."
CodeGeass,3aplwa,Polantaris,3,Wed Jun 24 22:13:19 2015 UTC,"The only part of that ending I don't like is the explanation of why Lelouch keeps the Geass and the Code. Of course, any theory suggesting Lelouch's survival is conjecture, but it's more likely (at least in my opinion) that he kept his Geass until the Code activated. It seems odd to me that he would be allowed both, but since the Code hasn't activated yet he can still use his Geass. Once he died for the first time, his Code activated, rewriting his Geass.  Of course, there's no way to really know one way or the other unless there's a sequel of some kind, but I would suspect that it would be more likely that he would no longer have his Geass after he was run through by Suzaku."
CodeGeass,3aplwa,Sci-Pi,6,Tue Jun 23 00:26:46 2015 UTC,"Basically, Lelouch destroyed all major reasons for future conflict. He removed all political borders by uniting all countries under his rule and destroyed and idealogical opposition. Territories still existed in the UFN, but they were all collectively ruled by the UFN council. Since Lelouch made himself so disliked by the mass population, all territories would be unified against a common enemy, allowing for the global union to not fall apart after his death. The only resistance forces that remained would be against him, so upon his death, no major resistance organizations would challenge the peace because they had their reason to exist defeated. By uniting the world under one flag, a global economy was able to develop with each territory dependant on the other, so warfare would be like shooting yourself in the foot. Lastly, Lelouch gave the UFN complete control over participating country's militaries, so even if one territory wanted to achieve independence or supply a resistance group, they would be vetoed at the UFN council. As Kallen says in her final monolog, things weren't perfect by any measure, but they were far better with minimal conflict. Many futurists feel that global unification is necessary for any intelligent race to advance beyond its own planet for the reason that futuristic warfare could cause a species to make itself go extinct.   tl;dr:  if everyone on the planet is united under one flag without a reason to fight each other, peace tends to be at its most stable."
CodeGeass,3aplwa,Polantaris,6,Mon Jun 22 17:51:50 2015 UTC,"But what happens after that? I doubt the peace holds on forever, at the end he didn't accomplish anything   Expecting peace forever is a fool's game and Lelouch knows better than that. His ultimate goal since the beginning of the show was to create a world where Nunally could live in peace and happiness, where she wouldn't be treated badly simply because of her disability. This world is a world he creates, and he gives Nunally direct control over the future of this world for as long as she lives (because she becomes the leader of the new world).  Will the peace last forever? Of course not. Lelouch knows it won't. But the world was in such a terrible state of racism, elitism, and general shittyness that he realized that it needed to change for the better. No single person's effect on the world will ever last forever, but he made a massive shift in the world that will last for some time.  The Epilogue of the show is...six months after he is killed, if I remember correctly, and up to that point everything he set out to do was successful. The world's views had shifted completely, and instead of building war machines the people built peaceful advancements. Overall, he was successful. Nothing lasts forever, so the expectation that peace would be forever is foolish and wasn't what Lelouch set out to do.  Additionally, there's the belief among a group of viewers that Lelouch isn't really dead, and that he received Charles' Code, thus lives on forever. People believe that he was driving the wagon at the end scene. There's really no supporting evidence one way or another, and it was an intentionally ambiguous ending."
CodeGeass,3aplwa,retardedchicken5a,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:31:39 2015 UTC,"Didn't Nunnally recover from her shock-induced disability in the end? But yeah, no peace lasts permanently in human history. His goal was primarily to let Nunnally have a world where she could live in peace, without the constant threats and running they endured during their childhood."
CodeGeass,3aplwa,Polantaris,2,Tue Jun 23 19:10:58 2015 UTC,"She had two disabilities. One was the shock-induced blindness, which was actually an effect of Charles' geass. She's able to overcome that (I suspect most likely because of Charles' death). The second was the physical crippled-ness. It was intentionally physically caused to make the fake scenario of Marianne's death more believable. Unfortunately, she can't recover from that. In the Epilogue, she was being wheeled around by Zero/Suzaku. Additionally, even after she was able to see again and opened her eyes, she was still crawling towards Lelouch using only her arms crying for him to stop, and at the end when Lelouch gets run through she's still on the ground, unable to stand."
CodeGeass,3aplwa,1TRUEKING,3,Wed Jun 24 00:07:58 2015 UTC,"Lelouch destroyed the world and from his ruthless tactics caused the world to hate him.  He burdened all the hate and with the world being destroyed, the people had to focus on reconstructing and working together to rebuild the world instead of warring with each other all the time and killing each other.  The peace lasts forever because zero is the symbol that killed the evil lelouch so if anyone else tries to do evil zero will punish them."
CodeGeass,3aplwa,sil3nt600,2,Mon Jun 22 15:48:32 2015 UTC,"He created Zero, the black knights. These two things act as a guardian to maintain peace. He secured world domination and peace for Nunally. Honestly, I'm under this big theory that Lelouch is still alive and is immortal, hence why he could afford such a dramatic fake death in front of the world, justifying Zero and getting the people's support for Zero. I believe that Lelouch roams the world with CC and will come back when the world turns into chaos again. All hail Lelouch."
CodeGeass,3aplwa,godblow,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:16:41 2015 UTC,"My only gripe with the creator killing Lelouch off is that 1) it retconns everything, and 2) sunrise made him change a lot of things in the story which means we never really saw his true interpretation of the story. Yes, Lelouch is dead canonically, but it was a really lazy ending and the entirety of season 2 was poorly executed relative to season 1."

CodeGeass,39m2lo,Lup3rcal_,5,Fri Jun 12 18:11:45 2015 UTC,"I was in your friend's position a few years ago. Episode 6 was painful. Episode 15 convinced me that the series wasn't for me because I couldn't deal with a show where the plot was that ridiculous and implausible. I was expecting a show where ""people die when they are killed,"" and that is not Code Geass.  Then I went back and rewatched it this spring, and it was amazing. It really picked up from episode 17 onward, and I've rated both the first and second seasons as solid 10s. Once the politics is in full swing, it's a fascinating, captivating show.  It is completely over the top and every stylistic choice revolves around the rule of cool, but if you can accept that, then it is very cool and supremely entertaining."
CodeGeass,39m2lo,StarOriole,2,Fri Jun 12 22:50:57 2015 UTC,"I would tell him to get to episode 14 (I think that's the one where, where Shirley and Lelouch, you know). If he has time to spare and can get up to that point but but still doesn't like it, I'd give up."
CodeGeass,39m2lo,myusernamestinks,2,Fri Jun 12 20:14:07 2015 UTC,I think its great that you like the show and its an amazing show and one that i love as well.  But if he hasn't picked up the show and not shown interest after watching the few episodes then maybe he doesn't like it and doesn't need to be convinced.  I've had a couple friends that i've recommended to watch a few things that i liked/thought was interesting and they didn't pick it up whether they weren't interested or whatever and thats totally fine.  Sometimes some shows aren't for everyone and sometimes people don't need to be convinced that a show you think is great they should like and think is great as well but is merely not their cup of tea.

CodeGeass,39jl40,Gunism,3,Wed Jun 17 02:03:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, the second season is a continuation of the story (the bulk of the plot imo) and completes the moral messages the creators wanted to convey to the viewers, so I think we, as the viewers, owe it to the production team to see their entire product, especially before drawing conclusions and making judgement. With that said, season 2 definitely requires you to be more mentally active (awareness/paying closer attention) because at times the plot and character's motives can be a bit convoluted. Overall, it is as entertaining as the first season, possibly moreso, and it more poignantly affects your emotions."

CodeGeass,39d45r,6l4c13m,12,Wed Jun 10 23:27:15 2015 UTC,This is exactly how I felt after switching from CrunchyRoll's free 480p on mobile to downloading full 1080p from OZC. I was lucky to have gotten it before all the torrents were shut down (for Code Geass) on bakabt.
CodeGeass,39d45r,ImperfectSanity,3,Thu Jun 11 01:44:48 2015 UTC,I lucked out as well. Torrent hd before they got shut down.

CodeGeass,399nou,zak561,2,Wed Jun 10 10:32:07 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it makes more sense when watching it subbed. Because when stuff like that appears, the text is usually italicized."
CodeGeass,399nou,Gunism,2,Thu Jun 18 20:44:28 2015 UTC,"Why would you even care about this. These types of scenes or 'flashes' as you call them are completely normal. It's used to represent a much more dramatic scene that has more to it, but remains a mystery and lets to viewer think what might of happened afterwards."
CodeGeass,399nou,sil3nt600,6,Wed Jun 10 08:52:25 2015 UTC,"I was just curious, and there are some stranger ones that cut off in the middle of a sentence. It just seems weird to me, thats all."
CodeGeass,399nou,Meldorn,5,Wed Jun 10 09:55:50 2015 UTC,You're correct in saying this is a miscut and not part of the show. The person putting the episodes together made a few mistakes that I ran into as well when I was first watching. I would find another copy--sometimes it skips halfway important stuff.

CodeGeass,37vjcd,BrokenSil,23,Sat May 30 19:22:48 2015 UTC,"Japan Pro:   Directed by the creators of the show, thus giving the truest rendition of the creators' desired story. Arguably higher quality voice-acting. Could just be better sound direction (See point above).   English Pro:   No need for subtitles. Johnny Yong Bosch. Troy Baker (Sploosh).   Japan Con:   Need subtitles. No Troy Baker.   English Con:   Arguably not-as-good voice acting (Though Troy Baker is God).   It's not our damn job to convince you to watch the show. If you want to watch it, then just watch it. Why should you need to be convinced? You're an intelligent human being; make up your own damn mind. The dub is better than most English dubs, but if you prefer Japanese, then watch it subbed. It's not going to make or break your enjoyment of the show in any way.  Watch the first episode in English, then again in Japanese, and see which one you prefer."
CodeGeass,37vjcd,Kerrigor2,6,Sat May 30 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"I tried that method for Cowboy Bebop. That turned into the only show I can't watch in jap, it sounds too weird to me."

CodeGeass,37vjcd,Li4m278,0,Sat May 30 19:58:10 2015 UTC,How are subtitles a con? I love subtitles. It makes it easier to understand exactly what is going on.
CodeGeass,37vjcd,Kerrigor2,2,Sun May 31 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"Cause maybe people are different. Sometimes I like doing things while I'm watching anime: grinding EXP in Fire Emblem or Bravely Default, playing SSB4, practising guitar. If I'm watching in Japanese with subtitles, I can't do most of that because I need to keep my eyes on the screen at all times to even understand what's going on. Most of the time I watch anime subbed, but, when I feel like multi-tasking, it's nice to have the option of not needing them."

CodeGeass,37vjcd,sean151,5,Tue Jun 2 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"Johnny Yong Bosch does a fantastic job acting as Lelouch, imo better than the Japanese actor. Johnny distinguishes his voice/personality of Lelouch and Zero very well where as the Japanese VA can only do one voice for both characters.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with the english dub and I can tell you won't be missing anything by going with it."
CodeGeass,37vjcd,teethandteeth,3,Sun May 31 03:15:58 2015 UTC,"Dang, I have to agree with you on the differentiation. The Japanese voice actor sounds incredibly regal, though! It reminded me of Nobunaga in the Samurai Warriors games a lot."
CodeGeass,37vjcd,Zezin96,2,Sun May 31 07:44:04 2015 UTC,Johnny Yong Bosch  No more encouragement needed.  He does Lelouch in ways Jun Fukuyama can only dream of.
CodeGeass,37vjcd,ImperfectSanity,3,Tue Jun 2 22:14:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like, in this thread, I'm the only one who hates the English dub of Code Geass. Though I also hate the dub of FMAB. I don't hate all dubs but I don't think the one for Code Geass is good at all. Also, watch it in whatever language you prefer. Try out both. No one's gonna judge you. If they do, fuck em."
CodeGeass,37vjcd,Yoneou,4,Sun May 31 06:31:59 2015 UTC,"You're not alone! Personally I love Lelouch's voice a lot more in Japanese than English, I just tried the English dub again and I seriously can't listen to it. Maybe because I'm used to the Japanese voices, but the English ones just sound too.. Girly? Especially the male voices..."
CodeGeass,37vjcd,ImperfectSanity,1 point,Sun May 31 11:48:00 2015 UTC,Yeah they don't match the faces at all. I know I'm a bit biased because I watched it in Japanese first but I doubt think I would've liked it in English anyway. I watched Naruto in English first but I still absolutely hated it so there's that. Same with Bleach.

CodeGeass,37vjcd,squaredrooted,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:41:50 2015 UTC,"You can read everyone's comments, but if you're used to anime (as in used to watching dubs and subs), you should just try both out.  I personally cannot stand the English dub because the voices lack real depth and emotion to me. Admittedly, I never really watched entire episodes, but I've seen clips and I'm not a fan.  However, I'm most likely biased because when I started watching Geass back in 2008, there was only the subbed version and I was hooked on the show.  The reason why I tell you to just try both out is because no one else knows your preferences. I like subtitles, so people who list subtitles as a pro/con can't really help.  Either way, it's a wonderful anime and hope you enjoy your ride :3"

Jeremiah would've wiped out the entire force of would-be Black Knights, except maybe Kallen, Ogi, and Tamaki for plot convenience. Suzaku witnesses the slaughter and joins said group after Jeremiah summarily ""proves"" his case that the Pure Bloods should be dominant faction and Honorary Brittanians are excused from service.  After Lelouche hijacks Violletta's Sutherland, he is captured by Jeremiah for being a subversive. During his public execution, Jeremiah somehow finds out his real identity, and suddenly we have a roll-swapped Orange scenario played out, but thanks to the Lancelot's (again, plot convenience) superiority, Lelouche and Jeremiah escape and suddenly the series revolves around three factions fighting for control of Japan. The lesser two factions (Orange and ""terrorists"") would survive long enough to grow because Cornelia wouldn't have shown up if Clovis was still alive, at least, not until something disastrous happened.  I think it'd make a great spin-off series. They could call it Code Geass: The Orange Rebellion."

CodeGeass,37e14n,zak561,6,Wed May 27 00:51:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I find that statement a little odd. I wouldn't say that ""Power Corrupts"" struck me as a theme of Code Geass -- and particularly not for Lelouch (which is implied by pairing the phrase with the Geass symbol). I don't think Lelouch ever really corrupted himself after obtaining his powers. He was always the type to ""do evil to prevent the greater evil""; he just took that to its fullest extent.  Or maybe I missed the point of your wallpaper."
CodeGeass,37e14n,dc880610,5,Wed May 27 02:23:08 2015 UTC,"When I was creating the wallpaper, I wasn't thinking of Lelouch but rather what Geass ment in general.  Geass symbolized power, whichever way you put it.  It made C.C forget what love really was.  It made Charles go on a conquest to ""kill god"", fucking up his entire family and making his own son hate him.  It made the guy who could read peoples thoughts (I honestly forget his name at this point) completely loose his mind, and obsessing over C.C.  In the end, Geass would twist each of its bearers into eventually wanting to kill themselves, seeking the next bearer of it so that they can have the sweet release of death. This in itself can be classified as corruption, since prior to obtaining the Geass the bearer would have almost no temptation of suicide.  I went on quite a rant, it probably doesn't make sense, but, whatever."

And then...what will he do?  The black knights will not fight outside tokyo and lelouch would not have achieved his dream of destroying the britannian empire.  Since suzaku thwarted his plans, lelouch was forced to grow slowly and expand his army, become a real threat to britannia and force all the huge fights in the end."
CodeGeass,372263,ddk220,15,Sun May 24 04:17:06 2015 UTC,"This.  Definitely agree that because of Suzaku, Lelouch was forced to adapt and grow. He was constantly challenged and so he never grew complacent. Rather than just Geass his way to the Emperor, he had to make tactical alliances and stay alert, on his feet, and try to remain one step ahead.  But, that all aside, Lelouch would have lost without Suzaku's challenging him. Let's say he did Geass his way to the Emperor. Without his experiences and growth, he never would have been able to take on the Emperor himself and the Knight of One and whoever else. Lelouch never suspected the Emperor of being as powerful and planned out as he actually is. And after all that, when Schneizel goes all crazy, he wouldn't have been able to take on Schneizel either, provided he survives the Emperor."

CodeGeass,372263,trowawufei,3,Mon Jun 1 18:15:15 2015 UTC,"It's interesting. I think he might lose. Clovis doesn't have the entire military with him at Shinjuku, so that engagement is lost eventually as overwhelming numbers come to bear on Lelouch. His victory in that battle was due to his brilliance, but with such inferior forces he could not triumph against someone competent- unlike Clovis. He then kills whoever pilots the Lancelot at some point over the next few battles.  However, the fact remains that the government bureau + air support cannot be defeated without the Gawain- an unlikely acquisition. And even if he infiltrates the bureau via Geass and gets it to surrender from within, then EU, Britannia, and Chinese Federation send forces to Japan under their best commanders- with Schneizel likely leading Britannia. Who knows what happens then? Does Lelouch Geass the EU or CF commander into following him? Does he prevail against Schneizel? He did not prevail against Schneizel in R2 without Suzaku's help."

CodeGeass,372l1l,JosiahSethWilliams,3,Sun May 24 22:34:06 2015 UTC,"An example of power being abused is in the scene where an aristocrat uses his social position to exploit people below his station. In that same scene, Lelouch uses his geass power in a good way to stop the aristocrat from belittling and beating a commoner on the street. I tried to find the scene, but it was so minor I had trouble locating it. I'm sure there's loads of better scenes, but it's the first one that came to mind for me and it illustrates current world tensions between the upper and lower classes. An example of corruption in the anime is when the eunichs of the chinese federation decide to forsake their princess and nation, an act of pure greed and selfishness, in order to become nobles in the Brittannian empire. One of them has a monologue that explains their intentions entirely and it gets broadcast across the world which results in citizen revolts and them losing the power they held. Overall there are a few ideologies highlighted in the series when it comes to creating a better world. The emperor believes the world should be survival of the fittest, where the strong feed on the weak. Lelouch believes that doing whatever it takes, even if it means committing lesser evils, is worth the price if it means ending the greater evil. Suzaku believes that using evil to end evil is an oxymoron nonsensical and counterproductive. Evil is wrong no matter the degree, and the only way to defeat it is to do what is right and just."

That is my favorite quote - it's from Lelouch in the first episode... that's a great way to talk about the lives of those without power ( the peasantry aka middle and lower class citizens) in a world dominated by people with a strong grip on the political/economic power.

Definitely worth the watch however!  Code geass imo isn't about power, its about one person's ambition to change the world."
CodeGeass,372l1l,ddk220,5,Sun May 24 14:51:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that. A huge motif of code geass is ""Does might make right?"""

CodeGeass,36xhwq,2Cor517,14,Fri May 22 22:52:41 2015 UTC,"Once the command is fulfilled, the Geass user acts however they want. Since he had already told him the questions, the command was fulfilled and the professor was free to act under his free will. Certain commands can never be completed, in fact most cannot. Lelouch instructed the professor to tell him the questions on a single test, which is very clearly a limited command. Lelouch tells Guilford to see him as Cornelia whenever certain conditions are met, and he keeps doing so. He also tells the purple-haired student to mark crosses on the school wall, every day at the same time. When he orders Suzaku to ""Live!"", it's a vague command. I'd argue that this one depends on his intent.  http://codegeass.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Lelouch%27s_Orders. I think nearly all of them are consistent with this."
CodeGeass,36xhwq,trowawufei,2,Sat May 23 01:16:17 2015 UTC,He commanded him to answer the question. He asked the question again meaning he should answer. He told shizle to obey Zero and he is going to do that the rest of his life even though he obeyed the command. Same rules should apply to this scenario.
CodeGeass,36xhwq,AlcibiadesXI,3,Sat May 23 01:33:09 2015 UTC,"Lelouch commanded the teacher to tell him the answers to tomorrow's test, the teacher told him and the command is fulfilled.  Zero says to Schneizel: ""You shall serve Zero!"" That is a command that cannot be fulfilled until Zero or Schneizel are dead."
CodeGeass,36xhwq,trowawufei,2,Sun May 24 13:27:10 2015 UTC,He didn't literally command anything in that scene. He simply asked the question... which is part of the ambiguity with Geass. You don't always have a verbal command.
CodeGeass,36xhwq,Adragon09,8,Sun May 24 03:36:46 2015 UTC,I'm not sure but maybe its because he did not ask the teacher to give him repeatedly information about exams.

There's nothing that even gets mentioned as having happened in the gap between season 1 and 2, so it'll have to be a good show in its own right for me to care about it. If it were filling in gaps I'd probably watch it regardless, but it's entirely new stuff."
CodeGeass,3675sh,Kerrigor2,3,Sun May 17 16:10:42 2015 UTC,"I would say so, yes. Not much is mentioned, yes, but that just paved the way for the animators to make this series. Don't you want to know what happened on the Western front in Europe?"
CodeGeass,3675sh,Kerrigor2,2,Sun May 17 16:13:16 2015 UTC,"Well... not really? It was never important in the show; we know that it all gets conquered in the end anyway. Watching what happened in the lead up to that will only be worth it if its a good show. Its like re-reading a book, or re-watching any other show: you know everything that happens, but its good enough that you want to experience it again anyway.  So if its good, then sure, I'd love to see what happens. If it's crap, then I can live on without it. But since you say its good, I'll give it a look. :)"

CodeGeass,34l5zt,Dant2142,1 point,Mon May 4 05:23:37 2015 UTC,"IMO I don't think you can hardly compare Britania to the U.S. The ideals are in most cases completely opposite. For example you can't really compare Muslims with the Eleven's. In Code Geass the Eleven's were former Japanese that were being repressed by the holy empire (which invaded without any provocation from the Japanese) so they were rebelling against them every way they could and the reason the Britania's saw them as terrorist was because of the ideals of the country. And that was extreme racism towards anyone who wasn't pure blood born Britanian. You can say that the media portrays all Muslims as terrorist but that isn't exactly true either, you can't blame them all for the actions of a few Zealots. The emperor even states that no man is born equal, which goes against everything that America stands for. Also the empire of Britania and how they act against the entire world is nothing like the U.S. For example the military literally slaughtering entire cities worth of innocent civilians, there is no one in there right mind in our military who would obey that incredibly unlawful order. That's probably the thing I liked the most about the anime was for my hatred of how their military acted. No one would disobey any orders given to them no matter how fucked up they were. The excuse, you have to do it that's an order doesn't fly. That's the difference between us and them. Small unit leadership and the morals to disobey an order when it is clearly not a lawful one to be given. So I believe that The Holy Empire of Britania and the U.S. Are in most case polar opposites in how they operate and act as a society."

CodeGeass,34l5zt,TerantQ,1 point,Thu May 28 03:35:57 2015 UTC,"What comes to mind is Ferguson, Baltimore, etc. and the Black Lives Matter movement. CG definitely shows how an oppressed minority population can understandably be driven to violence, and the argument between peaceful protests, working within the system, and riots/revolutionary change is certainly familiar."
CodeGeass,34l5zt,TerantQ,2,Sat May 2 15:39:41 2015 UTC,I agree but no american population (or european imperial population) will ever be driven to revolution. This is because of middle class luxuries being at an all time high and the media has convinced people that those things are all-important. Police brutality is not enough to trigger rebellion - and the american people don't seem to care about any of the other federal infractions of human rights.

My brother sympathized with him, saying ""yeah man, without that ending it's barely a 7/10 but with it it's a total 10/10.""  R2 had an incredibly rocky start and has a whole lot more flaws to it. This is all due to the time slot change and them having to scrap a lot. R2 is okay. I still like it, but it's not nearly on the level as R1 in my opinion."

CodeGeass,3473cd,Ramsay_Reekimaru,4,Tue Apr 28 21:38:12 2015 UTC,"Here is the source on all that.   Basically Sunrise moved them from a late-night time slot that catered to a more mature audience, to one of their prime-time slots earlier on a Sunday. The new time slot is the slot they usually use to push toys and figures. The show also had to be re-written in a way that anybody just jumping in could understand what's going on. The Sunrise execs pretty much said ""hey anything you can't fit in a 1-2 episode recap, is cut.""  The two links linked inside that blog are broken, but you can read exactly what they said using the Way Back Internet Machine or whatever.  And don't get me wrong, I still think R2 is solid too. I just felt like the first 10 or so episodes were really lackluster and a bit annoying to sit through after the epic finale of R1."

I really should be finishing off college assignments, but I think I'm too far gone.  I have really enjoyed it so far though. I have watched very few anime series so far. Have seen half of Cowboy Bepop and thats about it. Maybe a random episode of FCLC and others here and there. mostly while at friends houses. Also seen Akira and Ghost in the Shell, and I guess bits and pieces of DBZ and Pokemon, but I don't really count them."

Code Geass' score is indeed amazing, I think out of all the animes I've seen thus far (Sword Art Online, Attack on Titan, Death Note) this score is the best.

Once this code is in place, it will evolve on its own and eventually make your geass more powerful Spoiler (such as when Lelouch accidentally issued Euphemia the command to Spoiler because his geass fully activated.)  This code can also be taken from an immortal geass user by a fully evolved geass user in order to end the immortal users' immortality, thus causing them to die. A fully evolved geass user with 2 codes then becomes immortal."

Basically, the Code is something that is given to you when you kill a Code-bearer. (so, if Lelouch killed C.C.) Code-bearers are immortal, though, and require the killer to have full Geass (double eyes and permanent) to be able to kill them. (like when Lelouch kills Charles) Code-bearers are able to grant others Geass (C.C. giving Lelouch his Geass, for example. Usually the person with the code is killed by the person they granted Geass to.) and they are immortal, but they no longer have the ability to use their Geass (presumably because they killed the person who gave it to them). To activate the immortality, the Code-bearer must die once first and then they'll regen and come back to life.   (I know that was a bit confusing, so... TL;DR: Code is immortality and ability to grant Geass. Only be received by killing a Code-bearer. Must have full Geass to kill Code-bearer. Must die once to achieve immortality once acquiring the Code.)  Now, the Lelouch is alive theory (or at least a version of it) has the idea that Lelouch took the Code from his father and maintains his Geass:  Charles kills V.V. (who gave Charles his Geass) and receives his Code. Lelouch orders Charles to kill himself and Charles becomes immortal. Lelouch receives his full Geass (double eyes, permanent) and kills Charles, receiving his Code. Lelouch then achieves immortality when Suzaku kills him at the end of the show. Now, because Lelouch didn't kill C.C. and receive her Code and killed Charles instead, stealing his Code, C.C. is alive, and he theoretically keeps his Geass. Effectively achieving the status of CODE GEASS.  The END!"

CodeGeass,322jro,Just_Dreams,10,Fri Apr 10 01:39:26 2015 UTC,Lelouch would have killed cornellia on the mountains. That would give him control of japan. Then the brittanian empire would have sent their entire military force against them and lelouch would have probably been defeated ( he did not have a large army at that point)
CodeGeass,322jro,ddk220,8,Fri Apr 10 01:58:09 2015 UTC,"Don't you mean Cornelia, not Villeta?"
CodeGeass,322jro,QuadnaryCode,6,Fri Apr 10 02:01:56 2015 UTC,"Well technically It could be both they were both at that battle, I he most certainly means Cornelia"

CodeGeass,322jro,ddk220,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:05:47 2015 UTC,Yeah if he would've killed her that probably wouldn't have ended well. However if he killed Cornelia he  might have gotten some help from new allies acknowledging him.
CodeGeass,322jro,zak561,1 point,Fri Apr 10 11:52:53 2015 UTC,"I think he was trying to capture Cornelia and use his geass, not kill her."
CodeGeass,322jro,Bacon_Falcon,7,Mon Apr 13 23:11:09 2015 UTC,"hmm, if he joined up with lelouch after his rescue from jeremiah, the series would be significantly different. Since the first conflict after that is the mountains, i'd assume cornelia would've been captured. This would also probably lead to the jlf and blackknights merging, after lelouch used his geass on the leaders. If he subjugated cornelia with his geass, he could also turn whatever units she controlled to their side as well. So i think the conflict would of rose a lot quicker, since the black knight's size would grow tremendously. I bet Japan would have been liberated, but i can't really guess past that."
CodeGeass,322jro,JealotGaming,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:52:17 2015 UTC,I agree that Japan probably would have been liberated temporarily. I wonder what the actual plan was after capturing Cornelia though.
CodeGeass,322jro,jrdodd989,1 point,Fri Apr 10 11:48:03 2015 UTC,The show would have ended much earlier because most engagements that Lelouch lost were because of Suzaku appearing.

CodeGeass,31m60i,CodeGeassHater,6,Mon Apr 6 10:47:29 2015 UTC,"What is orange?   It's a bluff! That's why Jeremiah hates it so much, he got dethroned by a well-timed bluff. Why would he be so afraid at first? He's a Brittanian Nobleman, he has things done wrong. There's all reason to be afraid of something that actually was something big.   When Zero uses his Geass on Suzaku, at that instant Schniezel's gundam Knigthmare shoots the Hadron beam at the pit ... and then... 4 of them fucking end up on another island. <Did I miss the explanation as to why they loose their memories and disappear?>   Yeah, there is a short flashback of what happened, as far as I remember Suzaku basically made an unlikely quick escape. Lelouch actually remembers this, and I think Suzaku may too. It def. was unlikely, but I enjoyed it.   On this island when they all reach that platform and stand in a particular position, the mark activates and Suzaku suddenly has a vision - WTF was this??!   Geass. Probably happened because Suzaku had Geass-induced visions before.   At the end of R1, Suzaku and Zero face off , shots fired and Suzaku drags him all the way - straight to the fucking Emporer?! WTF? and Kallen just stands there and does nothing?   Kallen was overcome by emotions. I don't really know where they come from aswell. As to why Suzaku drags Lelouch all the way to the emperor: He states that he'll hand him over in return for being a knight of honor. How? He had a Knightmare parked outside.   Why the fuck does Charles absolutely do nothing for all the years if he knew V.V killed his wife?   Marianne was too weak. This is Charles' complete way of thinking: If you're killed, you were too weak. V.V. was simply stronger. Not to mention that Charles possibly couldn't beat V.V.   What's with Charles' demeanor with Lulu when he demands questions behind his mother's death - and Charles' is all like ""Lul - so what, fuck off""   Same answer, it's damn Charles. Also, what father would tell his kid vivid details about who killed his mother?!   does Charles personally wipe everyone's memory regarding Nunnally and all that (at the end of R1)   I believe all students except for Lulu's friends got placed on another school. His friend probably got the Charles treatment, yeah.   who orchestrates Zero's revival   C.C. as far as I know, she's the only one who has a major stake in this. With help of the Black Knights because Zero is basically a miracle worker.   In your opinion is ""accidentally ordering Euphemia to ""Kill all Japanese"" because miraculously somehow at that exact moment his Geass became permanent"" a valid Plot point?   That got foreshadowed earlier already. He almost ordered a Brittannian nobleman to kill himself when Rivalz was watching. He had major eyesores. Mao had perma Geass. Also, it's a bit of symbolism: The power of the king condemns you to a life of solitude.   Nina   I am not gonna argue on this one. Her character was a terrible creation and there are so many ways she could have actually been improved.   Geass on Suzaku (the way it activates randomly at later times)   Live on! Suzaku wishes to die, so at the points he would normally die he will abandon his values and make sure he stays alive.   Mao   More information on Geass, expanded on Suzaku's character, expanded on C.C.'s character history, expanded on Shirley's character. Expanded on the impact of Geass in daily life and Lelouch's daily life intertwined with the Black Knights.   Accidental massacre ""Kill all Japanese""   This expands on many characters. Lelouch gets a huge burden to bear. Suzaku gets a pure hate for Zero, which is just epic. It sadly enough also gives opens up Nina's character a bit. Those faces holy shit! Pure terror!   Random visions / disorientation that affects some people   Always happens due to Geass at valid points. C.C. can do this on purpose, everyone who touches her or which she focuses to through indirect contact gets the visions. When Lulu got perma Geass, it was uncontrollable. There were some more instances, I can't remember them all.   overall behavior of charles (except in the end when he explains everything to Lulu) - we can say his behavior / lack of concern was the very reason Lulu led to become a type of person that can turn into a zero. This behavior would've even made sense if it came to light that for some reason it was necessary for Lulu to have become a Zero (for Charles to achieve his goal) but this was totally not the case - he had absolutely no use of Lulu/Zero he could've 'lured' out C.C with other ways.   He was the biggest power in the world and could do what he wanted. It didn't matter what people thought of him, eventually it would disappear through his plans. It wouldn't have mattered that Lulu became Zero or not, Charles simply didn't like Lulu giving him shit so he said fuck off. He could do this because he was the mightiest man on the planet. Lulu was a good way of luring out C.C. when it became needed, so why not use him? He was there readily for Charles to use. EDIT: He also had no intent of using him to lure out C.C. beforehand, he had to do so because of an unlikely chain of events leading to her being freed. Before the series, he had her already.  EDIT 2: Shirley's death. Rolo killed Shirley because she wanted to reunite him with Nunnaly. Rolo is a psychopath who wants Lulu as his brother, so he would do anything to stop bringing Nunnaly back. He really liked killing people for some reason."

Lelouch actually remembers this, and I think Suzaku may too. It def. was unlikely, but I enjoyed it.   I didn't miss this flashback, but it doesn't show how Suzaku was able to frisk off four people to another island. Also it makes sense if Suzaku lost his memory (since he was acting under a geass) but it seems all of them lost their memories?  And there were a lot of spectators (from both sides) with their focus on the pit , since they had basically used that trap the first time - but afterward everyone seems to be all confused and with 0 clues as to where those 4 might be  EDIT: Lulu remembers, that's why we see this flashback (as shown through his perspective) - they deactivate that EMP like field (forgot the name of that tech) Suzaku grabs them using his Knightmare and gets out of the pit, this is the point till where Lulu remembers, but nothing since."

I'm talking about times when Suzaku or Anya specifically have these - its as if the show's screaming to us there's something special about them - there is indeed , Marianne is inside Anya this whole time (but none with regards to Suzaku). Also the times when this happens isn't explained or why. Often when Anya and C.C's Knightmares would clash they both would get them hallucinations, but why oh why"
CodeGeass,31m60i,spam123kappa,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:48:13 2015 UTC,I think it's simply contact and C.C. losing control of her power. Such as during the SAZ ceremony. Or being focused on a battle like Anya and C.C.. Suzaku had gotten the purposeful visions from C.C. before so I think that plays a part in it too.

One other thing I remembered - When V.V shoots Marianne, she doesn't have Nunnally in her arms, but then later in the morning they show her fallen on the stairs in the same position with Nunnally trapped underneath. (I remember this clearly because Marianne chooses Anya to use her geass on , as there's no one else around)  I understand that Charles makes Nunnally blind by using his Geass but she lost her legs because of the fall when Marianne gets hit, if I'm not wrong."

I think in the last or second to last episode Kallen mentions that the Gurren has better specs than the Lancelot Albion. These two seem to be the strongest knightmares in terms of general capabilities. Obviously the Shinkiro has a stronger shield for example. But the Gurren is probably the strongest, most well-rounded by the end of the series."
CodeGeass,313a5t,LiamSkylar,5,Wed Apr 1 22:34:23 2015 UTC,Guren seiten is obviously strongest if we're not considering the pilot
CodeGeass,313a5t,spam123kappa,4,Thu Apr 2 07:36:03 2015 UTC,"Going by the anime themselves, the Guren S.E.I.T.E.N Eight Elements is the strongest, because Lloyd simply says ""even at 50% output that thing is more powerful than the Albion"" if I remember the end of R2 correctly.   And is it not the S.E.I.T.E.N.That flies sound so fast it's simply a streak of light to all? AND the fact that the guren can block the phase luminous around the Damocles in the same way the shinkiro does (albeit with some damage inflicted to the luminous)"
CodeGeass,313a5t,Falkerz,3,Thu Apr 2 15:34:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there is a strongest. I'd say most custom Knightmare Frames of the Knights of Round are about equal, + the Shinkiro, + the Guren S.E.I.T.E.N Eight Elements. Yes, the Eight Elements can stop a blast from the Mordred iirc, but it raw power the Mordred beats it. The Shinkiro has the strongest shield, but is it the fastest? Probably not.

It was hard to watch. Especially when the Vampire of Brittania tried to make moves on her. Really, just like you said, I got sick to my stomach.  I really wanted a happy ending romantically with Kallen x Lelouch.. I still think that Lelouch loved Kallen romantically, and by the end its obvious that Kallen is still in love with Lelouch as well.  Judging from your post.. Is it safe to assume you're Kallen x Lelouch? =)  For recommendations, it sounds like you just like badass main characters. In that case, you NEED to watch Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Both shows have the same director and the most badass main characters. Cowboy Bebop has Spike Spiegel, the most legendary protagonist of all time next to Lelouch. He's pretty much the Lelouch of the 90s in terms of status and popularity. Watch it."

The end just goes to serve there is no ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" in the world. There is power, but should those in power abuse it, there will always be someone to lead a rebellion and start a new era. Its not black and white, and nothing in the show really is - all the ""enemies"" are motivated by good intentions gone awry (Charles, Marianne, Cornelia, the list goes on). Its really a show about human nature much more than anything else.   Wish I could respond more in depth to your questions and points but I'm typing this on a phone at work haha. Maybe when I get back home."
CodeGeass,2zna1m,ddk220,2,Fri Mar 20 01:24:10 2015 UTC,"a show about human nature much more than anything else.    [BSG SPOILERS KIND OF BELOW]  This qoute and your whole reply embody what everyone in /r/BSG say about the show. I also felt in that show that every (sorry, this is not what I feel about CG) was an asshole / made irrational decisions and it's heralded for being human like or real.  Honestly I like realism in shows such as Game of thrones (everyone is an asshole) or breaking bad in the sense of humans are inherently not perfect or evil.  But after the long journey I feel depressed with how Lelouch decided to unite everyone at his own expense."
CodeGeass,2zna1m,JealotGaming,3,Fri Mar 20 01:36:03 2015 UTC,"I loved reading your long post. I had similar feelings, but after my fourth or fifth watch i had a few more insights. 1. Lelouch committed many crimes. He was responsible for the death of many many innocents. He may have honorable reasons, but that doesn't cover the facts. And he used euphy's death to his advantage. All he ever did was use people. And this hurt him inside, he wanted to atone for all his sins. This is why he died at the end. That was his payment for all his sins. Also he never explained to suzaku about euphy because whatever happened, he used her. He used her death. That's a very dishonorable thing and he didn't want to give an excuse and hide behind it.    Suzaku - yes he seems like a betrayer all the time, but that's only because lelouxh succeeded. Imagine that during the euphy scene, lelouch didn't use his geass. He would have accepted defeat. Suzaku and euphy's dream would have come true. Suzaku isn't sucking up to the throne, he wants to avoid killing, same as euphy's wish. Orange is a name lelouch gave. And he continued to call himself that to honor him when he came over to his side."
CodeGeass,2zna1m,Pyrelord,3,Fri Mar 20 03:29:53 2015 UTC,"I never understand the whole orange thing. Lelouch said orange as a made up term right? I remember hearing a few people say ""He might reveal it..."" Was orange ever actually something or was it just a word Lelouch used?   It was just a word Lelouch used to taunt Jeremiah with.   I'm sad Lelouch never made any actual feelings known to either Kallen, Shirley or CC, he never once made the use of all of the attraction like every female on the show had for him. I'm the last person on earth to ever want T.V. romance, but I felt it was needed even a tad, even just once.   He definitely had feelings for all of them, but he couldn't really show it since he believed everyone around him died, like with Shirley.   The start of season 2 was so utterly fucking confusing at the time. Who the fuck was Rolo, what the actual fuck is going on?   That's the exact reaction they wanted.   I understand the ""code"" now, but did ever explicitly explain it in the show? They talked about geass 24/7, but like how does one become immortal? Was VV CC's first geass giver? How did VV get here? How did he die again, wasn't he immortal?   No, it was the Nun in C.C.'s church that gave her Geass. V.V. died because Charles took his code.   I felt that Lelouch throwing himself under the bus made me a bit upset, it worked and everything, but I wanted him to explain to everyone why he did what he did. Nunally hated him at the end (until the touch moment...) but if he had explained to her on the ship, explained to Suzaku the Euphy mistake, explain to the black knights, he never faulted, he was unyielding. I wanted him to have some redemption, to win. I felt like everyone except himself won in the end, even the asshole Suzaku who could not make a moral or rational decision.   It made me upset too. Though that's how they went with it, i guess it's because Lelouch himself felt he didn't need redemption. Besides, some of the Black Knights did deduce what happened there at the end, Todoh for example.   I hated whenever Lelouch lost. Especially when a new mech came out and seemingly could kill everything.   Yeah, it was kind of asspull, then again, Lelouch's victories are also asspull. It's a Sunrise show, they are prominently known for creating Gundam, so of course they'd create a myriad of OP as fuck Mechs."

CodeGeass,2zna1m,Chamelemon_64,2,Fri Mar 20 00:22:44 2015 UTC,"Shirley's death I really did not enjoy. She didn't need to die.    I believe her death was warranted. It really drives home the point that for Lelouch, there is no gray area. If he wants to succeed with his plans, he has to be all-in. There is no way for him to continue with any of his plans, continue using his Geass, and NOT see repercussions (loved ones dying, Nunnally hating him, etc.) For me, those deaths in the series were important because they emphasized JUST HOW ALONE Lelouch really was, all the way until the end, and just how much strength he had to muster up to continue along that path. I'm sure he had feelings for Kallen, Shirley, C.C., or some combination thereof. But for Lelouch, the one most important thing (creating a peaceful world for Nunnally) trumped every personal desire he could ever have. It's a way of being selfish that is paradoxically un-selfish.  Damn, I love this series so much ;____;"

CodeGeass,2zna1m,Aatra,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:36:25 2015 UTC,"Even if he isn't shown as the cart driver, who ELSE can the cart driver be? are you guys kidding yourselves.  Lelouch lived, do you think he was the kind of guy to die for his actions? I don't think so, that's so not in his character.   Also Jeremiah loved lelouch more than ANYTHING in the world, and he says ""go swift suzaku"" or some shit, when suzaku passes him and goes straight to kill lelouch. I don't think he would have such thoughts if lelouch was REALLY going to die.  Just my 2 cents on the matter, I really think lelouch lives in the end."

CodeGeass,2xysde,billycoolj,2,Thu Mar 5 17:07:50 2015 UTC,Superiority complex? Where'd you get that from.
CodeGeass,2xysde,BretticusWins,2,Thu Mar 5 17:24:12 2015 UTC,Superiority complex is a psychologicaldefense mechanism in which a person's feelings of superiority counter or conceal his or her feelings of inferiority.   I'd say after the shit that happened with his father and Nunnaly he probably felt at least somewhat inferior.
CodeGeass,2xysde,billycoolj,2,Thu Mar 5 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"Really? I didn't get that a superiority complex from Lelouch at all. He doesn't feel inferior at all.. He just harbors hatred towards his dad for what he did.  He doesn't feel inferior to Charles at all, and his thoughts of superiority don't stem from that either. He certainly wants revenge because well.. he hates Charles, because after all, Charles did kill Marianne and cripple/blind Nunally.   He certainly has a messiah complex where he believes he's the savior of the earth, but that doesn't mean he has a superiority complex. Does Light Yagami from Death Note have a superiority complex? No, he just believes that he's justice, similar to Lelouch. Lelouch adamantly believes he's justice because of the experiences that shaped him, but a superiority complex doesn't fit in there at all."

CodeGeass,2xnpyi,SplosionMan,3,Mon Mar 2 11:10:58 2015 UTC,"If he didn't do what he did, Lelouch wouldn't have been happy. He seeks to place all hatred of the world on himself (Zero Requiem) and seeks to move the world into the future."
CodeGeass,2xnpyi,AscendanceLoL,1 point,Mon Mar 2 12:18:41 2015 UTC,"I understand Lelouch's want for such an end. Was it, however, really just his pride that drove that? Could the world not move into the future through the UFN unification with Britannia? Was his end entirely necessary?  Also don't get me wrong. Love the ending."
CodeGeass,2xnpyi,SeKrayZed,3,Mon Mar 2 12:34:23 2015 UTC,"I think that the UFN would not have stayed united, after all, it was formed as a coalition to stop Britannia in the first place. With that threat gone, do you really expect those countries to go stay that way? We've seen how the EU and Chinese were. Even Britannia, Lelouch was a strong ruler for Britainnia, but there would always be some corrupt successors after that would bring a downfall, much like throughout history. Even this united world that Lelouch brought with the Zero Requiem would eventually fall one day, as younger generations forget the reason why."
CodeGeass,2xnpyi,AscendanceLoL,2,Mon Mar 2 22:12:44 2015 UTC,"Yes. As shown multiple times, Lelouch is someone who lets nothing deter him from his goal, which applies here. I'm sure that unification would have been entirely possible, however, Lelouch believes firmly in an ""ends justify the means"" way of going about this."
CodeGeass,2xnpyi,eat_those_lemons,3,Mon Mar 2 13:23:51 2015 UTC,there is a chance that the UFN would not take and accept him and that he couldn't join the black knights again. The other way of betraying the world probably seemed more fool proof to Lelouch
CodeGeass,2xma7a,eat_those_lemons,2,Mon Mar 2 00:59:39 2015 UTC,Akito's brothers Geass will go out of control and start killing everyone ruining his good reputation.   ....because he's a psychopath.
CodeGeass,2xma7a,AsunasPersonalAsst,2,Fri Mar 6 08:32:58 2015 UTC,"Well, he could just kill everyone. He's pretty ruthless, and he doesn't even need to use his Geass to kill, we all saw him Knightmare. But this is indeed very interesting. I hope in the third or fourth one, we get to see the reason why he wants everyone, especially his brother, dead.  EDIT: I think he also wants his brother to die by his Geass, as some sort of self satisfaction, otherwise he could've just killed him in a Knightmare duel when they met."
CodeGeass,2xma7a,SeKrayZed,1 point,Mon Mar 2 02:38:46 2015 UTC,"the other question is why his brother isn't dying from it. When he was little he didn't die which doesn't make really any sense, but at the same time Akito said that he had ""died already"""

CodeGeass,2x7imt,BlitheCynic,5,Thu Feb 26 07:14:47 2015 UTC,That was kind of the whole point of Kanon.

CodeGeass,2x7imt,trowawufei,2,Thu Feb 26 08:51:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Kanon was one stop short of a giant flashing ""I'M GAY"" arrow pointing to Schneizel.

CodeGeass,2x7imt,goldiefoxx22,13,Thu Feb 26 16:58:13 2015 UTC,"I think that sexual orientation is a trivial aspect of Schneizel's characterization.

CodeGeass,2x7imt,SaiphCharon,6,Thu Feb 26 07:12:48 2015 UTC,Yeah in the end it has nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. But I figured now that the dust has settled I'd just ask for clarification.

CodeGeass,2xaqb7,zak561,5,Fri Feb 27 01:34:04 2015 UTC,Uh...he did. In the last episode he uses Geass on Schneizel and Nunnaly...

CodeGeass,2x313c,ZeroCiipheR,13,Wed Feb 25 05:48:17 2015 UTC,"his earlier geass is definitely weaker, but a real big part of it is they would just become mindless drones probably unable to complete daily routines and definitely unable to interact with others. it would be a huge giveaway that someone was brainwashing/abducting people and would bring lelouche to light very quickly.  what I think he should've done was say ""every time I snap you will obey every command, once I clap you will return to your daily life."" so he hypnotizes them, but if he didn't clap they would be again set in a drone state"
CodeGeass,2x313c,munsosl8,5,Wed Feb 25 06:13:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that's how Geass works. Suzaku was instructed to live, but as long as he complied with living, anything beyond that was up to him. I would think as long as everyone obeyed his commands, anything else would also be entirely up to them."
CodeGeass,2x313c,trowawufei,12,Thu Feb 26 02:07:51 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's morals. When he becomes completely unfettered after Rolo's death, you see him use an ""obey me"" Geass on pretty much everyone on Shikine Island. After ascending to the throne, he does the same to thousands of his acolytes. Lelouch knows what it's like to have no power over your destiny- he experienced it for much of his life. That means he dislikes overriding others' will more than is necessary to fulfill his objectives. He's also arrogant about his intelligence, so he thinks he's capable of consistently picking specific commands that are just as effective as a catch-all ""Obey me.""   I don't buy the mindless drones theory. We saw dozens of people who fulfilled his Geass commands and then continued their day-to-day lives. A total Geass would simply mean that they would have to follow his orders. If he ordered them to ""kill the viceroy"", the person did so, and then he gave no further commands, they'd revert to a state of free will like every other Geass subject."
CodeGeass,2x313c,trowawufei,2,Thu Feb 26 02:15:36 2015 UTC,This is my favorite answer. Thank you for this!
CodeGeass,2x313c,trowawufei,2,Thu Feb 26 03:40:33 2015 UTC,"No prob, thanks for posing a question that really made me think!"
CodeGeass,2x313c,JealotGaming,11,Thu Feb 26 03:41:44 2015 UTC,"It would be pretty obvious if all of a sudden half the Knights of the Round started attacking loyal Britannian soldiers chanting ""Kill the Emperor"".  Basically, he uses Geass as part of his plans, but doesn't rely on it,which is why he doesn't become like Mao."
CodeGeass,2x313c,whirl-wind,3,Wed Feb 25 09:11:13 2015 UTC,"Even I would be tired of people responding to everything I order with 'Yes, your majesty'."
CodeGeass,2x313c,BigBoyBirdShit,6,Wed Feb 25 09:15:34 2015 UTC,"Two reasons: the first is that an ever-increasing group of mindless drones would eventually become extremely suspicious and make his chances of being caught as a Geass user increase dramatically. Even with the small amount of people that he Geassed he still got caught, imagine if he had Geasses double or triple that number.  The second reason is that Lelouch gets a thrill out of manipulating others and seeing his plans fall into place. While Geass is often a part of his plans, simply using Geass to manipulate one person is too easy for him and wouldn't give him that much of a jolly. Lelouch has a huge ego and enjoys exerting power over people and situations; easily getting by with Geass would ""detract from the fun."""
CodeGeass,2x313c,BretticusWins,3,Wed Feb 25 06:37:20 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, it would be very boring if that's all he did. Part of the charm of the show is how he uses it in a smart way."
CodeGeass,2x313c,goldiefoxx22,3,Wed Feb 25 10:53:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's because Lelouch finds out during his confrontations with Mao that the more he uses his Geass, the less control he has over it. This is exemplified when he accidentally commands Euphie to ""kill all the Japanese."" If he used it a million times on everyone, sooner than later his power would no longer be under his complete command, ironically...So, this element of using Geass forces Lelouch to spout commands wisely :)."
CodeGeass,2x313c,Hegemott,2,Thu Feb 26 08:21:45 2015 UTC,I feel that would go against Lelouch's morals. He wishes to end the world-ruling empire. It'd be hypocrisy to do so by ruling everyone on the world.

CodeGeass,2wtp00,r_antrobus,10,Mon Feb 23 01:53:06 2015 UTC,"In the end Lelouch talks about how Suzaku had become a warrior unlike any other because of his resolve, and in the battle this is explained by the knight of one, Bismark, when he asks ""is this the machines special functions? or Kururugi's skill?"" there is also some at the beginning when Earl mentions that Suzaku is the only one who can pilot it at 100% capacity. It isnt explicitly stated but I would assume that it is because the Lancelot was designed for Suzaku. for example there are 4 slash harkens on the Lancelot instead of the usual 0-2 like on other knightmares. and they are not on the shoulders but in the legs and arms. also Lancelot focus' more on sword skills like an old fashioned knight with sword and shield (even has the shield on the arm like a medieval knight) compared to many other nightmare frames that have a machine gun component.  or like in season 1 episode 20 susaku got 100% on the float system simulation which since it is mentioned I would expect to be significant so Suzaku is just a really good pilot and so the lancelot is really for him and his great skills. Just like the Guren is for Kallen and her special skills, she isn't the only one who CAN pilot it but she is the best one to do so."
CodeGeass,2wtp00,eat_those_lemons,5,Mon Feb 23 05:08:00 2015 UTC,"I'll have to watch again to be sure, but I believe what the Earl said was Suzaku achieved 93% efficiency on the Lancelot simulation on his first try. The Lancelot probably required extremely advanced skill (probably mostly human reflexes and APM) since it was the first generation seven Knightmare Frame. Achieving that level of efficiency was only possible due to Suzaku's inhuman reaction speeds and combat capabilities.  Most normal soldiers can probably pilot the Lancelot, but in their hands the Lancelot is hardly better than a basic Knightmare Frame. Suzaku was the only one to push the Lancelot toward its limits. However, he is probably also not the only one capable in the world, just the only one that the Earl had ready access to. I would think Gino and Karen wouldn't have too much problems getting the same performance out of the Lancelot."
CodeGeass,2wtp00,xdavid00,4,Mon Feb 23 15:54:18 2015 UTC,"Now im just gonna throw out my vauge reason. I havent seen it in forever, but I can try right?  I think he was the only one capable to piloting it at its max capacity. Not sure what power it drained, willpower? Or something like that. Suzaku had imense determination. I highly doubt it was willpower, probably some other characteristic. It doesnt fit into Code Geass's world. But he had something nobody else could replicate. And thus he was the perfect candidate to test the prototy lancelot"
CodeGeass,2wtp00,xSoft1,14,Mon Feb 23 02:03:59 2015 UTC,It ran on hypocrisy.  No one can match Suzaku.

CodeGeass,2wtp00,BigBoyBirdShit,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:14:38 2015 UTC,"Nobody else is skilled enough. Suzaku is able to use it to 96% efficiency, higher than anyone else, so there is no reason to have anyone else pilot it."
CodeGeass,2wrrv8,ThunderNova,24,Sun Feb 22 16:41:05 2015 UTC,"I always felt that it was intentional.  The guy's a straight up hypocrite, he's in hardcore denial, and that's how his character was meant to be portrayed. Again, at least that's how it seemed to me."
CodeGeass,2wrrv8,GoldForce,19,Sun Feb 22 18:00:45 2015 UTC,"I actually quite liked Suzaku at the end.  He tried to be the hero of Japan through his own hypocritical ways. Basically, Suzaku had the perfect body and physical prowess, but lacked intelligence, which is why him and Lelouch made for the ultimate team.  His ideals were childish and foolishly optimistic, but in the end he realized that he was wrong. During the Ragnarok, he ends up agreeing with Lelouch's ideology, so in ways he was a redemption character. And for me, he completely redeemed himself.  I mean come on.. during Lelouch's coronation when he fucking spinzaku'd the guards and stood by Lelouch's side? That's still my #1 favorite scene in all of Code Geass.  But yeah, I agree. Suzaku was a major fuckboy by the end of season 1 and almost all of R2. He could never fully redeem himself, but at least now he's cursed to be Zero."
CodeGeass,2wrrv8,tidusblitzace,5,Mon Feb 23 04:34:42 2015 UTC,Makes him really sound like a white knight. I see your points in this and looking back I think I need to rewatch the show to get a different perspective on the characters.
CodeGeass,2wrrv8,WildStang,5,Sun Feb 22 16:54:30 2015 UTC,"Huh... yeah he was pretty hypocritical and ignorant.... but I kinda hated the way he acted when he was a Britannian pilot, but to me he redeemed himself when he joined with Lelouch."

CodeGeass,2wrrv8,Mr2D,2,Mon Feb 23 04:57:29 2015 UTC,"Suzaku gave up his dream joined Lelouch and became Lelouch's pawn/shield. He did what Lelouch told him to and ""gave up the ordinary pleasures of the world"" ie he gave up his old life for Lelouch's plan not for his own. Suzaku wanted to change the world without fighting (even though that is what he did) but his goal that he professed was to change the world from the inside out but then after joining lelouch he became a warrior to take over the world the opposite of what he had proclaimed before"
CodeGeass,2wrrv8,eat_those_lemons,2,Mon Feb 23 05:28:07 2015 UTC,"Not really.  He wasn't lelouch's pawn, as he joined lelouch's cause in according to his own ideals and plans.  Secondly, he didn't want to change the world without fighting, he wanted to change it without any unnecessary fighting(yes actually a big difference here).  He didn't technically abandon his way of doing things when he and lelouch made up the zero requiem, seeing as he was still fighting for Brittania.  Him giving up his life and his name to become Zero was part of his and Lelouch's atonement.  He and lelouch simply ended up wanting the same outcome(a better future for the world) and took extremely different paths to get there, but he didnt give up his dream, because his dream was to create a better future for the world.    He didn't even really do everything lelouch told him to do, because by the point that they were working together, they were working as equals, and both needed each other to further their plans.  In fact, it was actually Suzaku that bullied Lelouch into continuing his plan when they found out that Nunally was still alive."
CodeGeass,2wrrv8,Mr2D,1 point,Mon Feb 23 06:24:38 2015 UTC,"Lelouch isn't a complete hypocrite. He has everything planned.

Eh, screw guilt, it's the inventor's and Lelouch's fault (which it was, but the way Suzaku rationalized it and rather than feeling for the people he killed was just stupid)."

Suzaku is an existence whose sole purpose is to be the perfect soldier, but tries to have the mentality of someone who wants to have ideals, not realizing he has no idea of the consequences."
CodeGeass,2wrrv8,xdavid00,5,Mon Feb 23 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"I really do like that at the end Suzaku seems to recognize that he has been naive and goes to kill charles and ends up under Lelouch who is the Leader, so Suzaku becomes the perfect soldier one that does whatever the leader asks of him."
CodeGeass,2wrrv8,eat_those_lemons,1 point,Mon Feb 23 04:29:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for an entire season and 2/3 of another season, for sure, he got on my nerves, but at the very end he finally got some real honor and balls, cause he thought his way of changing things from the inside were better than the Zero way, was so annoying all along, so hypocritical of him, so many times I just wanted to punch my monitor.  It would be ok for him to be like that if almost half of the other characters didn't really think he was some cool guy with all the good reasons and stuff like that, a Japanese that wanted to change the tirany from Britania fighting for them, WTF... Only this says it all."
CodeGeass,2wrrv8,klipeh,1 point,Sun Feb 22 20:04:03 2015 UTC,"First off, yes, Suzaku acted like the mother of all hypocrites, and that's exactly what we were supposed to see about him. I'm sorry you were so enraged by his behavior that you became unwilling to sympathize and pay closer attention to his development and psychology.  We know that Suzaku acted rashly as a child, scared by his father's intentions to spill blood, and killed his father in order to prevent it. He buried the memory of his hypocritical, foolish and painful act for years. To my interpretation, it only surfaced when prompted by Mao's mind reading.   At that moment, Suzaku realizes that he's been trying to right the ""wrong"" act of murdering his father in the form of saving other people. So, his grand idea of carrying out justice is in response to his internal (suppressed) torture over his own unjust act (its morality up to interpretation). He chooses to achieve justice through the ""system"" because it seems like the traditional ""right"" way to go about things, following the law, staying in line. It's his attempt to write over his past actions with an excess of morally sound behavior.   He becomes aware of this, but realizing the source of one's largely unproductive behavior doesn't easily instigate changes in our behavior, usually.   Plus, the show is made interesting by the difference between Lelouch's and Suzaku's take on morality, and if the ends justify the means. If both were in the same camp, there, then we wouldn't have much conflict. Because of Suzaku's mentality that opposes his, Lelouch is forced to own his philosophy that much more fiercely. What we love about Lelouch is his insane drive. Suzaku is necessary for Lelouch to demonstrate it to the degree he does.  That's the short of it. I could go on."

It is the only show I have cried about since the ending was so touching. There are problems with the rest of the anime but the ending makes up for all of that. The reason for that is: Best twist ending with a purpose and not just for shock value but you the audience gets to see some of what the world is feeling that Lelouch is a terrible human being and he is a tyrant and should be gone, but then the creators fill you in at the last minute about Lelouch's plan and everything comes into place.  In other words you become Kallen, you want to fight Lelouch and the terrible person he is but then at the end you realize: ""Lelouch and Suzaku, that is what they had to do?"" and then scream ""NO!"" because you don't want Lelouch to die in the end once you see his plan and true intentions."

It's a different sort of style than S1, for sure -- S1 is very micro-oriented, and deals with a set situation with very few macro-consquences.  R2 is set on a whole different scale.  It also plays with the existential and the bizarre more than S1 ever does.  But it's just as powerful, if not more so -- and the ending will definitely meet and exceed all expectations.  Some of the older characters are neglected, somewhat, but others are highlighted, and the new characters that show up are wonderful.  Watch it."

CodeGeass,2w1yn2,twinfyre,25,Mon Feb 16 06:52:17 2015 UTC,"Just going to paste what I said when I commented on this   He is the son of a very powerful figure Declares himself as the one true king (when he attacked the Geass order he said there can only be one king), just as Jesus proclaimed himself as the true messiah He has a second coming, after which the world is ""destroyed"". Just like the Christian prophecy of the Rapture Is resurrected after his supposed death He is matyred for the good of the world. In old Jewish cultures Rabbis would lead an animal such as a goat to the desert and place the sins of the people on it, then kill it with the sins destroyed along with the animal, this is how we get the term scapegoat. In the Bible this happens with Jesus, all of the worlds sins are placed upon him and then he is killed by the Romans, removing the sins from the world with his death. In Code Geass this happens in the Zero Requiem, however instead of sins Lelouch takes in the hatred of the world and then is killed by Suzaku, removing  hatred from the world. Many people revered him fervently while others saw him as nothing but a madman and an enemy to all that that is right. This is just like Jesus' converts and the conservative Jews and many Romans"
CodeGeass,2w1yn2,GreenHairedSnorlax,3,Mon Feb 16 07:24:18 2015 UTC,"The resurrection that you're speaking of, is that at the beginning of the second season, as in Zero's return?"
CodeGeass,2w1yn2,Aatra,3,Mon Feb 16 19:48:06 2015 UTC,The resurrection I see as him coming back at the start of R2 and the second coming/rapture as the Zero Requiem
CodeGeass,2w1yn2,GreenHairedSnorlax,2,Mon Feb 16 20:32:54 2015 UTC,That's a really interesting way to look at it. I was so focussed on Lelouch as the savior that I forgot that Zero was the Messiah that he created. I just assumed the resurrection wasn't an important part of the story. Thanks for this insight!
CodeGeass,2w1yn2,Aatra,3,Tue Feb 17 01:02:12 2015 UTC,Can we talk about Babel Tower and say again that there is no religious symbolism?
CodeGeass,2w1yn2,kgurr,3,Thu Feb 19 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's directly referencing the biblical tower in which human hubris caused it to crumble when humans built it to reach the heavens so they could be at the level of God. However God had none of that, knocked it down, and in order to stop them building it again he cursed them with the different languages of the earth, stopping the builders from being able to work together  Although it should be noted that being part of the Torah it is allegory, and being Old Testament it involves God generally being a dick"
CodeGeass,2w1yn2,GreenHairedSnorlax,8,Fri Feb 20 05:08:44 2015 UTC,"The reason for all the religious imagery in Death Note is because Light saw himself as God. If you notice, when we're in Light's head the music is choral and epic, but when we're out of it (and when he's lost his memory) the music is more techno and modern. The contrast is supposed to separate him from everyone else. It also plays during Higuchi's and Mikami's Godly moments. Its not just there for the sake of it.   Lelouch is definitely a Christ figure. Its a really common trope in literature, and its obvious that Code Geass takes a lot of cues from not just other anime, but from literary sources. But there is an element of deconstruction of the Christ figure. It could be argued that his ""solution"" was very idealisitc and would break down when Nunnally, Suzaku, and Schnizel were dead. He also wasn't able to do it all by himself, and needed the help of his friends. There's a ton to talk about there, but ultimately, yes Lelouch is a Christ Figure.   And it really isn't overdone in symbolism, just in storytelling. Lelouch is like Jesus thematically, but he never sits on a cross.   Though I'll disagree with you emphatically on it being not integral to Evangelion. While it may not have factored greatly into the plot, the point of including the crosses and the dead sea scrolls was to add an element of worldbuilding. It wasn't thematic or literary, those elements lie elsewhere in the story. It just serves a different purpose, but some would argue that that purpose is very important as well."
CodeGeass,2w1yn2,Aatra,3,Mon Feb 16 19:47:07 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that Lelouch could be taken as a more aggressive Jesus Christ.  But Christianity is taken as a choice, and acts passively in the world; Lelouch very actively destroys the world structure as it is and then ""resets"" the political stratosphere by taking all of the former bitterness and heaping it upon himself.  I actually found that a more significant parallel in Madoka Magica or Full Metal Alchemist, there's a concept of entropy or equivalent exchange.  For every hope granted, there is an equal amount of destruction that the change unleashes.  For every action, there will be some reaction against that action, rendering it useless.   Lelouch destroyed two empires and a ridiculous number of people.  But by dying with that bitterness focused on himself, he was able to  release the world from the need for revenge.  The hypnosis was broken. In addition, he undertook the evil actions himself.    He forced his own crucifixion.    Christianity views Jesus' crucifixion as unjust, but somehow symbolic of all of humanity's freedom -- one part of the religion that I don't really get, even though I grew up with it.  Somehow, an innocent man dying absolves the guilty of their sings.  I get that it shows the best way to live, without succumbing to pride or caring about who's ""right"" -- but those who killed him remain guilty of killing him, even if his own honor was unsullied.  Lelouch was not unsullied.  He was guilty of a fair bit.  But he was willing to suffer the consequences of his own actions.  There's a quote he says, right? Episode 1?  ""He who pulls the trigger must be willing to die for it himself.""  He's not just talking about risks involved in terrorism.  He's saying that he is willing to bear the brunt of the consequences for his own actions, and so avoid dirtying anyone else's hands, where Jesus is willing to bear the consequences for other people without attempting to enact revenge.  Similar, I guess, in a way, but I wouldn't call it a parallel."
CodeGeass,2w1yn2,Sa_Rart,2,Mon Feb 16 19:59:25 2015 UTC,That's probably why I enjoyed Madoka and Fullmetal so much. The plots were so well thought out and the endings of both shows seemed perfect for the series. Especially the ending of the first FMA.   There was just layers upon layers of content.

CodeGeass,2w1yn2,BretticusWins,2,Tue Feb 24 18:01:36 2015 UTC,"The reasons behind Lelouchs decisions were justified. You can't go and tell your followers that you can make people obedient. They'd all most likely leave because of panic, not knowing if Lelouch already made them do something against their wills or not. Also, you can't necessarily find symbolism everywhere. Don't forget that Lelouch is also a human being with emotions that makes mistakes, and connecting that to any type of symbolism is a bit unprofessional. People find symbols and conspiracies wherever they want, that goes without a doubt, however I'm not saying your opinions are wrong, just that I personally don't see any connections to what you said."

CodeGeass,2t1f2u,megacookie,23,Tue Jan 20 16:43:56 2015 UTC,"They don't use the year system most of our world (and by extension, Death Note's) uses which would be BC/AC or BCE/CE. Years are counted from the reign of the first Britannian emperor, ATB. Which is ~50 years before the start of our calendar system. So 2017 in Code Geass universe is really equivalent to our 1960s. But because history is so dramatically altered I guess technology developed quite rapidly in recent times so it seems futuristic what with all the mechas and stuff."

Not many people wrote anything down and if they did we sure didn't find it. As far as a Historians viewpoint goes there is almost nothing to show what events happened in all those years so due to the fact we are basically blind to events of that time period it is referred to as ""The Dark Ages"" since we can't see into that period of time.

CodeGeass,2t1f2u,Darklight66675,0,Thu Feb 5 19:15:41 2015 UTC,"The name may not, but the facts of the age are immutable. The Pope was the dominant power in Europe during that time period, Kings would go so far as to do on foot pilgrimages from their castles to the Vatican to gain the Pope's favor. Christianity during the time discouraged literacy among the poor, and actually created a higher class of people who shared in all the wealth in a way not seen during the Greco-Roman period. This structure was, of course, perpetuated and justified by ""God's favor"". These are the things that we do know. Reason, learning, and knowledge were all considered superfluous by most people, as it was a period of great war between Kings who all believed ruling to be their God-given (literally) right. It wasn't until Thomas Aquinus revived greco-roman teachings and effectively modernized the church that we saw this begin to break, and it really wasn't until the Rennisance when Europe saw productivity anything like the enlightenment of the Romans again. The fact that most Medieval writing that have survived (and contrary to what you seem to believe, we do have quite a few, enough to teach entire classes on individual writers from the period) that the main concern at the heart of everyone's musing was how to get to heaven, not how to further the cause of mankind. Whether or not that is good or bad isn't the subject of this conversation, but on the question of whether or not it as a time period restricted the West's philosophical and technological growth, I'm going to have to go with an emphatic yes.   TL;DR: The Middle Ages were bad."

Of course there is the issue of fictional time and universe divergence, but I'm sure some horrible fanfic writer and/or physicist could make it work."
CodeGeass,2t1f2u,insideanerdsbrain,10,Tue Jan 20 11:30:14 2015 UTC,"If Light had geass, he would kill people by just telling them to kill themselves. This would include L and anyone who got in his way.   If Lelouch had the Death Note, he would have just killed off the royal family directly and assumed control, then killing anyone who got in his way.   Neither series would have been nearly as interesting under those circumstances. It was the limitations of their powers and how their powers combined with their unique circumstances.   Lelouch was less egotistical than Light. Light wanted to be a god, and didn't care how he reached that point. He cared only about himself and felt no remorse for any harm he caused. Lelouch was actually visibly affected by his own actions and who they hurt. Geass was a far more powerful ability than the Death Note, but was put in the more tame hands of Lelouch. The Death Note was severely limited in its ability, but put into the hands of a man who had no self restraint.   I'm addition, geass requires close range proximity to be used, which for a person who needs to stay hidden to his enemies creates an issue of being limited. Light didn't have to worry about that since he could move around freely, and only when under the Death Note's limits did he have to hide himself.   In conclusion, they both would have been very boring stories if the powers were switched."
CodeGeass,2t1f2u,Zezin96,-1,Thu Jan 22 05:24:00 2015 UTC,"Of course it would be different and maybe a bit too easy for both of them. For Light the Emphasis of the show would be on tracking down L and others in his way and kill them or make them change their ways. He would Geass people to kill other people and L would (Being apparently omnipotent) eventually get on his trail and then it would get interesting and we could still have the famous ""I AM THE GOD OF THE NEW WORLD"" shenanigans. And as for Lelouch he could quickly list off the royal family and take the throne himself and then the show could be more about the politics and Lelouch trying to fix the world as he wants it to be. Your right it wouldn't be as entertaining at least not the way it was already written but they change a couple things here and there then it could be just as great as the other two shows are."
CodeGeass,2t1f2u,NightmarePulse,2,Thu Jan 22 06:46:57 2015 UTC,"Light's story might be able to make a save. I doubt it would be nearly as good, but it could work into a reliable enough story.   Lelouch could not. Upon becoming emperor, any enemies he came across would be dead one way or another quite quickly. There wouldn't be an L investigating him as a serial killer because his enemies would be political, and the equivalent of assassination targets.   If the U.S. president had the Death Note, what would happen? Leaders of other nations or terrorist groups would be killed quickly and efficiently and with complete denial by the president and no proof he ever killed them. Even if the Death Note was found, he could claim it was his personal notes on intelligence he received from the CIA. Add into that the supreme power the emperor has in CG, and you have a person who can kill anyone at any time. Factor in that Lelouch had a far more simplistic idea than Light (changing the nations leaders and their goals toward peace requires influence on far fewer people than eliminating crime entirely), and you have just lost all sense of story.   Either way, I hate to say it, but any story we could get from either would be a disappointment in comparison to what we got."

CodeGeass,2t0h2g,fryamtheiman,2,Wed Jan 28 01:54:45 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting question, but unfortunately there are too many issues with knowing what determines how geass powers form. C.C. And Lelouch are pretty obvious, and Mao could probably be guessed at (I would say it came from low self esteem and a desire to know how to make people like him better as just a wild guess). The issues though come with Rolo, Marianne, and Charles. Guessing at Rolo or Marianne is difficult at best, and Charles, a man who wanted to erase lies from the world, had the geass to implant lies in the memories of others.   There are too many issues with knowing their desires and how their desires could lead to their geass.   However, I do think that a more interesting subject for the thread might instead be what geass power does each person think he or she would acquire himself or herself. Unfortunately, without rules to the thread, I think people would come up with some stupid OP power just as an ego boost."
CodeGeass,2szdy9,kagedtiger,9,Mon Jan 19 22:10:30 2015 UTC,"An interesting topic, OP.   Assuming that similar to memory transference, perhaps a Geass can be triggered through touch.. I'd say the Geass to inherit a persons abilities after making physical contact, like a pat on the shoulder. Of course using the ability on another person would overwrite the previously copied skills, otherwise it'd be too OP.   But perhaps mastering Geass would allow me to keep sets of skills? It's fun to speculate I suppose. :)"
CodeGeass,2szdy9,acesilver1,2,Tue Jan 20 02:30:47 2015 UTC,"Let me get this straight: it would allow you to absorb the skills of people you touch? That's interesting and not at all overpowered, which can be a problem when creating powers like these, as you noted. Are you an envious person?"
CodeGeass,2szdy9,acesilver1,6,Tue Jan 20 02:34:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have it exactly right. Touching Lelouch would allow me equal footing in chess, you see?  No, on the contrary - it's very rare for me to be envious of anything. I'm one of those frustrating individuals blessed with natural talent I suppose. 30 minutes of effort tends to yield results that comes with weeks of practice. If I'm not as good as I think I should be, I'll relentlessly pursue it until I've mastered it (normally in a brief time), and then never attempt it again unless it's needed.   Lelouch was able to manipulate many many many people without the use of his Geass, you know? I just see myself manifesting a Geass in this nature, as it suits me as a person already. It would sure explain a lot to my friends and family!"
CodeGeass,2szdy9,BlitheCynic,4,Tue Jan 20 02:48:44 2015 UTC,"I think mine would be to alter the senses of those around me. It has the same sort of spherical range as Rolo's Geass and does something similar to Rolo's but rather than suspend the target's sense of time, it manipulates what they sense (see, feel, smell, hear). The more people that are targetted, the more difficult it is to control exactly what is or isn't felt (at the same time, this may make it easier to physically erase one's presence). With concentration, the range greatly diminishes but the control greatly increases.  The drawback may be high levels of effort and stress, which have their own effects like migraines, etc. It also becomes incredibly difficult to control the longer it has to be maintained.  Might come from a desire to be able to disappear while not making an effort to find a place (just to have some alone time) but also a desire to influence others indirectly by adjusting their perception of reality."
CodeGeass,2szdy9,pawned90210,1 point,Tue Jan 20 00:27:52 2015 UTC,"It seems like the type that should require eye contact, unlike Rolo's or Mao's. But hey, you're the one making it up, not me. Then again, that might make it too much like Tsukuyomi..."
CodeGeass,2szdy9,pawned90210,2,Tue Jan 20 01:23:29 2015 UTC,"The reason why I would not think it should require eye contact is that what would be the difference than say, a complete-obedience Geass that can just command that person to sense something. The whole point is for it to be subtle and therefore the person affected would not even be aware that they were affected while it is affecting them. However, there have to be major drawbacks to this ability and this all has to do with the sustaining high levels of mental stress."

This would help me achieve my goal of convincing people to agree with me, say to buy my product, or accept my idea by making them more confident with my idea and lesser with others.  It is a skill with words that accomplishes the same, like the skill a lawyer has. The geass will let me do that with absolute control.  Btw, whats your geass op?"

CodeGeass,2szdy9,oshare_banchou,2,Tue Jan 20 02:22:13 2015 UTC,"OP, perhaps it'd be more fitting if your Geass worked as a sort of.. inhibition blocker? Using your Geass would force others to be nothing but truthful or impulsive with you. If they trust you, they'll confess their problems. If they love you, well perhaps they'd be prompted to affectionately maul you haha.   The downside would be using it in the vicinity of someone who hates you, though.. and that could potentially get messy. Or, potentially entertaining. =P"
CodeGeass,2szdy9,megacookie,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:00:14 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but the powers seem to more or less directly grant the wish. Lelouch wanted to command, so he got the power to command. CC wanted to be loved, so she got the power to make others love her. Of course, it gets a bit muddy outside of those two, but the point stands.  I believe the power would work as something like an inhibition blocker like you mention, but it would probably just make people less resistant to confessing their struggles while also making them see me as a problem-solver. (I bet this power concept would make for a cute anime series of its own...) Anything else would seem to be outside the scope of the original wish.  However, I bet the wording would also affect the manifestation of Geass. If I wished instead to ""fix the problems of others"", it would probably just make others accept their issues, not seeing them as problems anymore or something like that, which would, of course, be more morally questionable. Or maybe it would simply increase their drive to do something about it...hm..."
CodeGeass,2szdy9,PhettyX,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:15:47 2015 UTC,lol i had the same thought in my mind. I also wanted to help people and was wondering how would a geass let me do that. Probably it could let me understand their problems but that would be like reading their mind. Like mao. It might sound comical but would a pretty good geass!

CodeGeass,2szdy9,JealotGaming,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:29:13 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, it could work like a combination of various abilities, but in a limited way. Initially, it would make a person see you as a trustworthy and effective person, making them ask you for help. Then, it could allow you to command them or change their personality, but only in order to solve their problem. Similarly to how Lelouch can only command one person one time, you would only be able to use your power to solve one problem per person. It might also affect other people that are involved. For instance, you might help a woman with an abusive husband by ordering him to never hurt her again, or you could just tell her to leave him. You would have freedom of choice like that. Man, I never thought such a stupid-sounding power could end up so OP..."

CodeGeass,2szdy9,SwedeNIKeane,3,Mon Jan 26 17:02:26 2015 UTC,"Good topic OP.  I think this one would be interesting rather than something I would want, but a Geass that kills. Essentially, upon activation, the Geass will kill the person whose eyes you come in contact with. Method of death would probably be a brain hemorrhage, since the Geass affects the brain. Like all Geass, this Geass would eventually, with multiple usages, become strong enough where it is activated by default. This would cause the person to have to cover their eyes constantly in order to avoid randomly killing people. How's this Geass useful, you ask? You could walk into anywhere without opposition; just look into the eyes of anyone who stands in your way. How is this Geass detrimental? Killing is extreme, so it's not something that can be used a lot in one setting (unless intentional). You would have to plan out strategies and tactics to avoid using the Geass unless necessary (you might kill someone important to you, or you may alert others when they see piles of dead bodies)."
CodeGeass,2szdy9,a_shiny_heatran,2,Tue Jan 20 04:22:28 2015 UTC,"My Geass would cause myself to alter the rate I can process time. Making time slow down a lot in my perspective actually means my brain and entire body's systems operating at a high speed state and vice versa. Using slowmo to think quicker would lead to more mental stress and physical strain if my body tries to keep up with my mind (making use of faster reflexes for example). But the opposite effect (fastmo) would be restorative when processing everything slower, sort of like sleep."

CodeGeass,2swnzd,MaverickGH,13,Mon Jan 19 07:39:29 2015 UTC,For the most part I think they're pretty close. I do think that the English dub does Lelouch better. Johnny Yong Bosch does a great job of nailing the everyday-teenager-persona Lelouch as well as the more grandiose Zero. Japanese Lelouch just sounds like Zero all the time.  English dub Nunally is one of the most grating VOs I've ever heard though. Between her and Rivalz I'm not sure if it's worth it. I also kind of like the quirky voice Lloyd had in the Japanese version. The cool British voice doesn't really fit him as well in my opinion.
CodeGeass,2swnzd,TheIntellectional,2,Mon Jan 19 06:20:07 2015 UTC,"I like JP Lelouch a lot better, while his Lelouch Lamperouge voice does sound weaker and ""fake"", his Zero/Lelouch vi Britannia is much more grand than the dub's IO."

CodeGeass,2swnzd,Dartkun,3,Mon Jan 19 14:17:31 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer the dub. The story takes place in a Japan that has been overtaken by the British superpower, I just find it more likely that the characters would speak english rather than the language of the place the captured. Same goes for Hellsing Ultimate, which I prefer dubs in as it takes place in England, and Death Note, which I prefer the original in as it takes place in Japan."
CodeGeass,2swnzd,Sci-Pi,3,Mon Jan 19 22:07:55 2015 UTC,"The anime is meant to be watched in English. Why would entire Britannian Empire be speaking Japanese?

But in the end, the real reason I watch the English dubs is because I don't want to put my focus on the bottom of the screen reading subtitles lol.  However, I hate Nina and Nunally's English voices.

CodeGeass,2swnzd,in0ri,7,Tue Feb 10 07:20:10 2015 UTC,"I apologize in advance if my comment offends any dub viewers, dubs are completely fine, its just a preference. :) In my opinion (for dubs in general, including cg),they feels less original, in the sense that things are lost through translation. Because a perfect translation from japanese to english does not exist, one example being ""条件はすべてクリヤーしました"" or in english ""all the condition of been cleared,"" the english phase sounds awkward and less majestic. Another thing that really puts me off about dubs is the pronunciation of the names of different character, the way native english speakers read japanese names is far from what they should sound like, or intended to sound like. One example, suzaku kururugi, there is a difference when you read it as romaji and when you read as if it was english. TL;DR: I prefer the sub or the raw version because that is the way the creators wants you to interpret cg, the occasional awkward translation and weird pronunciation of names is pretty annoying (for me at least), in the end of the day, its your own preference. I apologize once again if I offended anyone, it is not in my intention to do so. :("

CodeGeass,2ryk8y,Nivmilk,3,Sat Jan 10 14:52:18 2015 UTC,"For what it is worth OP, try not to compare anime too often. I personally find that every time I try to watch something that is similar to something else, I am always disappointed when it doesn't turn out how I wanted.   That said, I believe it is around episode 19/20 that things will really start to get interesting. A lot builds up to that to give you a sense of what is at stake, and when the moment comes (you'll know it too), you will realize just how screwed things are going to be from then on. R2 is definitely the better of the two seasons, but everything leading up to that is worth watching.   Also, just a heads up, on episode 1 of R2, if you are confused about what is going on, don't worry, it is natural to be, just keep watching it and you will understand."

Anya is a Knight of the Round but only 15 in R2 so it makes sense for training to start fairly young for nobles.  In addition it is repeatedly shown that Knightmare's controls are learnt from a manual and given Lelouch's intelligence, reputation for reading and ridiculous ability to quickly absorb information meant he likely pretty much knew all about it from reading a manual once."

My guess is that it was slightly after that. As you said, after Lelouch was exposed, he went all-in to kill Charles. My guess is that that was all that was on his mind at the time. But after he succeeded, he (with Suzaku and C.C. present) probably came up with the Zero Requiem, during that period of time between Charles's death and Lelouch's ""big reveal."""

CodeGeass,2qsapy,ETERNALSPECTRUM,2,Tue Dec 30 06:52:50 2014 UTC,"Seriously, what did you all do to deal with Code Geass withdrawal?   I read a lot of fanfics.Recommendations:  https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6175861/1/Dauntless - Lelouch is found by Clovis before the events of the Shinjuku Incident.  https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8969391/1/Once-More-with-Feeling - Lelouch goes back in time.  https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4994784/1/Code-Geass-Megiddo - Instead of being brought back to Ashford, Lelouch is brought back into the fold of the Imperial Family at the end of R1.  Anyway, i can recommend you a few anime to watch.:  Gurren Lagann. Probably one of the most over the top anime you'll ever see, ever. /r/gurrenlagann   No Game No Life. Two NEETs are transported to another world in which games decide everything. /r/NoGameNoLife   Kill la Kill. Another ridiculously over the top anime, created by the same people as Gurren Lagann. /r/KillLaKill   Log Horizon. I personally like it, it has some strategy elements and the main protagonist is a light-hearted version of Lelouch/Light. /r/LogHorizon   Mirai Nikki. Twelve people are given diaries that see the future and are told to kill each other in order to become god. Insanity ensues. /r/mirainikki"

CodeGeass,2qsapy,Aatra,1 point,Tue Dec 30 08:03:24 2014 UTC,"Best advice I can give is watch a new anime, but don't go into it hoping for it to be like or even exceed Code Geass. Not because CG is untouchable, but simply because I have found with the anime I have watched that each needs to stand on its own without comparison. If I expect an anime to be like one I already watched, I become disappointed when it doesn't pull through.   For months after finishing CG, I couldn't get into any anime because I kept comparing them to it. The way I really got out of that was by watching Clannad, which has a completely different tone to it, although it left its own little hole as well.   I would suggest you just watch something in a different genre of anime. If you can find you like the different ones, switching between them keeps each one fresh and helps to prevent moments of thinking ""this just isn't like xxxx."""

Those ancient structures around the world are the portals to the world of C, or something, and charles will use the thought elevator to kill ""god"" or the world of C, and release humanity into a new form..  The origins of geass aren't really explained, but I suppose there existed a religion before the Geass Cult that had direct connection and power from the world of C, and they got Geass from there.  Geass would not work in a world where Charles had achieved what he wanted because he would have killed god, the source of geass.  Or at least these are my thoughts on it."

She's nothing more than the product of the sheltered upbringing that she, and almost every other Brittanian, likely had. She's actually a really interesting character if you care to analyze her. She obviously has issues of repression and perpetual shyness that cause her to want to make herself distinct from everyone else. Unlike Llyod, her dedication to science is emotional. She wants to prove herself, and she also has an innate sense of loyalty to Britannia that many of the side characters have (Rivalz and Milley come to mind. Shirly in the beginning). While she's obviously a despicable bitch, it's actually true I think that there is a lot of Nina in a lot of us, and that it's those qualities that we have that we demonize in both ourselves and in Nina."

It shows what is going on in Europe with the European Union during that time.  It's not necessarily part of Code Geass, pretty much just a little something extra.  However, I'm fairly certain that Code Geass is over. I could be wrong though, I haven't been keeping up with the rumors and such."

I could pretend that I am super late because I was having a beautiful time with the family on Christmas Day, but fuck it I was actually just so hungover from dealing with the family on Christmas Eve that I didn't wake up until 9pm. Anyway, business.   Whatever medication they put Nina on, I think it's working. Whatever medication they put Nina on, put Schneizel on it, too. Bahahaha Lelouch faceplanting in a Knightmare. Cornelia's back early from Belize. I guess Schneizel's wall-gun attended the Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy. Holy shit did Guilford just get the girl? Dinner and a movie at least? Well, she did let him hold her hand, and that's something dammit. All it took in the end was a round of near-death experiences. A true underdog story, I tip my fedora to him. R.I.P. Diethard. (Long live the new flesh!) Nunnally is awfully arbitrary about which evil brothers she trusts and which she doesn't. I was always kind of expecting Xingke to finally hack up that lung during the battle, but that doesn't seem to be happening. MEMORIZE THIS! MEMORIZE JEREMIAH GOTTWALD! Wow, Jerry, way to throw the poor girl's mental problems in her face. Arthur at Suzaku's ""grave"" might actually be the most poignant moment for me. HE DID LOVE HIM! HE LOVED HIM ALL ALONGGGGGG!!! WHYYYYYYYYY!?!?! omg so sad I'm done bye T_T   In conclusion:   Thank you /u/SpockNorris for organizing this and for the acknowledgement.   1: I agree that Lelouch is dead just for plot structure reasons. It would be too much of a cop-out if he lived.  2: Why would Lelouch be driving a cart? Everyone knows that if he were around he would be in the back roll, roll, rolling in ze hay with C.C. I agree she is supposed to be communicating with him in C's world.  3: Nunnally probably put the pieces together because just before he geassed her Lelouch said something like ""Oh so you have the same idea then."" She probably remembered that when she touched his hand.  Merry fucking Christmas."
CodeGeass,2qe2p4,BlitheCynic,5,Fri Dec 26 06:37:43 2014 UTC,"Just finished watching CG.  My wife and I have been marathon-ing it, but didn't hit the end until today (27th).  Kind of a fan of the ""he lives"" ending.  This is just my personal thoughts on it, mind you:   His being alive gives C.C. someone to hang out with for the rest of eternity.  Also she kinda liked him.  D'awww. It doesn't water down the meaning of his death for one reason: for the gambit to be effective, he must be dead.  Never see anyone he knew, ever, and completely discard his former life and rank.  He can never see his sister again.  He must go where nobody has ever heard of Britannia, the Black Knights, Zero or Japan, and never come in contact with anyone from his former life.  That's straight up tragic. If he's alive it would be because he has a code; he is immortal.  Everyone but him (and C.C.) will age and die, and within half a century likely none will remain who knew him.  He will be an ageless young man without a name. His alias was Lelouch Lamperouge.  L.L.  C.C.  V.V.  It fits. It fits CC's dialogue about the life of solitude being ""not quite right"" - because they are together."

I think maybe that's not quite correct. Right, Lelouch?""   It seems pretty clear Lelouch was living a life of solitude in his final days. The whole world hated him. He was killed, and his death was celebrated. How is that ""not quite"" a life of solitude?  I suppose you could argue it's not a ""life"" of solitude, but a ""death"" of solitude.

CodeGeass,2qe2p4,legacy_of_fail,1 point,Sun Dec 28 22:23:23 2014 UTC,"The whole problem is that this show isn't like Death Note, in which they went through great pains to lay out all of the rules and conditions. Code Geass didn't really specify all of the rules about Codes and such, which makes it all the easier for these fan theories to spread.  To make matters worse, Geass isn't just one power with one set of rules. Lelouch's power was to control people, which required eye contact and could only be used once. But Mao's power was totally different: to read minds. It didn't require eye contact and could be used indefinitely. Maybe the rules about Codes are also not so fixed..."

Is ""she's chosen to flee"" Schneizel-white-lie-language for ""I ate her liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti""? For whatever reason, the brief moment of Rakshata and Tamaki sniping at each other makes me want to ship them. ""Where the hell were our perimeter guards?!?"" ""Durrrrr sorry we dun goof'd."" Sorry but why can't Lelouch just be a good emperor? I know blah blah blah deathwish and all that jazz but he could just fucking suck it up. He even seems to know what Schneizel is up to already (unlike everyone on Schneizel's team) and could probably take him down effectively and avoid the imminent mass-nuking with the power he would gain from legitimate popularity. Whatever. Oh! It's Sayoko. I guess Schneizel didn't kill her horribly after all. Although it doesn't look like he lacked for trying... Schneizel told Nunnally he evacuated all of the residents of Pendragon to Belize. Aaaaand Schneizel is nuts. Big surprise there. I blame whichever parent decided to name him ""Schneizel."" Cornelia picked a terrible moment to tone down her bloodlust. Can we talk about Schneizel's wall-gun for a moment? Let's just consider this: he actually built his evil headquarters so that he could spontaneously gun people down from behind with a snap of his goddamn fingers. Now, presumably these are to be people who are unarmed and unsuspecting, since they have agreed to meet with him in his office and stand where he goddamn tells them to. Furthermore, he actually seems to have calculated the ballistics so he can stand right in fucking front of whomever he is fucking over at that particular moment and smirk in their goddamn face without actually getting hit by any bullets that might make it through their now-corpse. It's like a standard villainous trap door with extra violence. God, I hope Cornelia gives him a solid kick in the dick for that one after her miraculous recovery. Pink Barbie Lancelot. Looks like Ohgi can't even put on a condom right. I see Nunnally also bought Schneizel's story about Cornelia's spontaneous decision to take a long vacation in Belize. Blow shit up. All the shit. Blow it up."

If he just ascended the Britannian throne and nothing more that would only deal with one third of the world plus it would go against his wish to destroy Brittania.  And even after defeating Schneizel there would still be the UFN since Schneizel isn't technically their leader.  Not to mention Britannia itself would feel cheated since Lelouch just marched in and killed their emperor.   and could probably take him down effectively and avoid the imminent mass-nuking with the power he would gain from legitimate popularity   Nope nukes are nukes no matter how popular you are.

Ooh, Gino and Suzaku have a rivalry happening nvm. Omg, Bismark has Geass! Aaaand he's dead. ""The Supreme Council is meeting at the basketball court"" Lol. The Black Knights are finishing each other's sentences for some reason. Not sure if adorable or creepy. That exchange with Tohdoh and the mook gets me every time.  ""Sorrysirwecompletelyfuckeditallup"" And Nunally's alive. Unlike the Emperor this one actually somewhat surprised me the first time around.    Ep23:   Does Nunnally really buy that Schneizel evacuated every single inhabitant of Pendragon before the FLEIJA? She is super naive to buy into every bad thing said about Zero but then 100% trust everything Schneizel does completely, including this and the subsequent Cornelia vanishing. Think for yourself girl! Jeremiah actually joins a conversation by falling in from the sky. It's no Emperocket but it's close. And Schneizel shows his true colours. ""Peace attained by force is no peace!"" So why you were slaughtering all the Japanese resistance groups in season 1, you hypocrite? Wall guns! Pre-battle prep montage is cool. Oh good, the battle is like chess and Schniezel doesn't actually understand that game. Lelouch got this. The BKs totally deserve that defeat for being gullible idiots."

While people are right that he essentially wanted a world that would be peaceful, I think the end goal goes beyond just that. A world which is constantly at war with itself cannot progress beyond a certain point. It will either destroy itself or a single entity will control it all if the world as a whole doesn't come together.  With the Damocles, he could keep the world under fear of destruction and have it ruled by a single nation. However, with both of those, people will hate him and unite to bring him down. After the fall of such ruler though, the world can come together as a whole, not out of fear or conquest, but from mutual benefit. This means the world can move beyond wars fought between its people and can move into the future.  Of course this is just my take on it, but I do think there was a goal beyond what the end result of what we saw was."

He then takes control of Britannia, which allows him to use Britannia's superior military and bad reputation to bully other countries. His acts of aggression cause the world to forget about some of the surviving Britannian nobles and officials from the previous emperor's reign (such as Cornelia, Guilford, Gottwald, Odysseus, etc) and focus on hating Lelouch. Lelouch eventually has Suzaku dressed as Zero kill him, eliminating the one person in the world who was most hated.

Deep down he just wanted family and to be able to experience things that family members do for each other. In the end he got to, even if Lelouche says no. Rolo is probably one of the biggest winners and losers of the whole series."

That's what I've been saying all along! ""Do we have any more units to send Zero?"" ""Just Tamaki."" ""Well we're boned."" Hahaha why are there cartoon animal faces on the Guren's startup screen? Someone get Nina a therapist already. Did Lelouch genuinely not believe Suzaku about the nuke? How could he risk trying to have him killed? More charmingly misguided gallantry from Guilford. WHAT DID YOU FUCKING EXPECT NINA!?!?!?! Good thing the school was 3 feet outside the blast radius. I feel like openly not giving a damn about your own casualties is asking to be betrayed.  ""We've been doing fine just the two of us, haven't we?"" - Rolo, master of social tact. ""We've had our hands full with the 10 million dead people you slaughtered!"" OMG Tamaki is so embarrassing. Why does Viletta always wear fishnets with garters? It just seems like a really weird wardrobe choice for daily use. Diethard's actually the only one making sense. Ok, so nobody can recognize Lelouch's voice as Zero's in everyday life (presumably because he's Batman-growling!), but suddenly a shitty recording of Lelouch is sufficient evidence against Zero? While we're on the topic of the Black Knights' standards of evidence, I'd like to share this old fanart favorite of mine (slightly NSFW) Oh man, where was C.C. going to put those band-aids? Rolo!

Rakshata still chillin on the couch Ok, so I feel like Lelouch's choice of geass for Guilford was 10% pragmatism and 90% spite. He could just as easily have gone with the classic ""Obey me"" or the slightly more creative ""Be as loyal and dedicated to me as you would be to Cornelia."" But, no, instead he goes with ""I'm going to impersonate your crush just to show what a pathetic tool you are already."" It's really one step short of a bed trick.

As an Australian myself, I enjoy seeing Australia be the one neutral country on the map of the world. Completely unrealistic to how it would actually be in real life, but then again giant-fighting-robots.  The CC segments make me a tad uncomfortable. If you taught her to eat pizza Lelouch, I'm sure you could teach her to wear actual clothes. Luciano is a large ham, even by this show's standards. Nina is rather upbeat about the whole grafting a nuke onto the Lancelot thing. I like how a drunken Tamaki is happily celebrating with Asahina who's mostly just uncomfortable and wanting to get back to his whole exposing Zero deal. ""Morning sickness! Congrats to Papa Zero!"" Oh gawd. All this talk about the EU makes me more impatient for Akito the Exiled. Omigosh, the Emperor's alive! What a totally unexpected turn of events!   17's fairly good, with the Lelouch/Suzaku confrontation clearly the highlight.   ""This attack is far too weak for one of Zero's trademark strategies"" -Bismark being the first character to demonstrate some degree of genre awareness. I understand why he's doing it, but man is Lelouch screwing himself over with his confessions to Suzaku. Bismark vs Xingke, whilst basically filler material, is pretty badass. ""You know I can't undo what's already been done!"" Doesn't that just sum it all up. Aaand it all goes to shit. Again. Lelouch is soo lucky that Guilford happened to be among his captors.

The plan makes zero sense (harhar) and just serves as a really cheap excuse to change the setting to China for a few episodes. The rest of the episode is a bit dull too, mostly just characters speculating about the resolution.  Episode 9 is better - I actually really enjoy the China arc itself, though it seems to be rather unpopular amongst the fanbase.   Some Blithe-Cynic-style dot point notes -    It's interesting that despite the bride being the Chinese Empress, there really aren't many Chinese characters in this scene - only the High Eununchs and Xingke really. There are a ton of Britannian characters around, in every scene. That probably says a lot about this arranged marriage. The Xingke flashback is the most gosh darn adorable thing. Kaguya rocking up with Zero, all like ""Problem?"" ""I'm here for you, Nina!"" ""NO SHUT UP YOU'RE SHALLOW I HATE YOU"" Love that Kaguya sass to Suzaku ""They're evenly matched!"" They're actually really not, Lelouch has 3 pieces left and Schneizel has like 8. Schneizel, that is not how chess works. You can't move your king into check. Also, why did you say 'checkmate'? You haven't actually got Lelouch in checkmate at all.  The game shouldn't even continue to Lelouch's turn, even if we allow Schneizel's previous move; Lelouch has already achieved checkmate. You don't win chess by capturing the king, you win by trapping it in checkmate. Lelouch doesn't even have to make a move, he could just declare victory right here and walk away. I love that autocorrect keeps changing 'Schneizel' to 'Schnitzel'. omg Nina stop Xingke is a badass. I have never felt more guilty about one of Zero's plans than his kidnapping here.   Really strong episode, some decent political intrigue, good scenes basically all around, despite the writers having obviously never played chess before."

As for the masks i assume that since technology is so advanced there are probably a lot of 3D plastic printers around.  So if someone were to make a 3D model and uploaded it to the internet,  then everyone could just print a mask in black plastic, glue some dark colored cellophane on for the lens, and call it a day.

Has he not figured out yet that Zero is in the running for the biggest cheater in the whole world? Does he get it and just not care? Is he just riding on the chance that Zero isn't the same guy as before? I don't give a damn how good you are, YOU NEVER CHALLENGE A REPUTED CHEATER IN SINGLE COMBAT! EVER! Loving Lelouch's Sarcastic Wonka ""Please, tell us more about Zero's identity, Suzaku!"" Arthur loves to hurt Suzaku, but he still follows along at his feet. :3 Gino is such an adorable little shit What's with the partial mark on the wall? In what school can students make their teachers wear sexy bathing suits? Sign me up, I guess? What's with all the gratuitous Kallen ass shots? First time I've noticed Villetta's crack attack when she runs into Kallen.

CodeGeass,2pex0q,Hawk301,1 point,Tue Dec 16 15:46:17 2014 UTC,Of course. How could we ever forget about the sub-viceroy?  And you'd really think that Guilford would have caught on after Cornelia of all people got taken down by a dirty shot from an ally in a move that was completely out of character for him while fighting Zero. And that was with the element of surprise on her side.
CodeGeass,2pex0q,BlitheCynic,2,Tue Dec 16 17:36:52 2014 UTC,"Guilford really annoys me here. Seriously, he could've destroyed the Black Knights and therefore's Zero's credibility as the savior of the Japanese right there and then. And what does he do? Challenges the man with a history of cheating to an 'honourable duel'. Everything that the Black Knights do from here on should be on Guilford's conscience.  I enjoy that you can already see the beginnings of the BK's eventual betrayal here - some of them are understandably kinda pissed that Lelouch screwed them at the end of last season. Luckily for Lulu, Ohgi is gullible and Tohdoh is loyal as hell.  Favourite part of episode 4 is Lelouch completely turning the tables on Rolo, manipulating his assassin into becoming one of his most loyal allies. The whole Rolo plan is classic Lelouch.  Episode 5 bugs me, as I really dislike the fanservice in this season. It doesn't really contribute to the story and is mostly gratuitous. The Kallen ass shots are unnecessary and dear god Viletta you're a teacher that's not ok.   Pretty meh episode, the only scene I enjoy from this one is the twist at the end with Nunnally. It's one of those rare times when Suzaku is actually smart, and the look on Lelouch's face is pretty amazing.    Xingke is still kinda chilling in the background and not really affecting the main plot in any substantial way. This will continue until the characters actually get to China."

The Vincent is really cool too, I seem to be one of the few people who actually likes Rolo as a character.

My favourite part of episode 23 is Lelouche's poignant little phone conversation with Suzaku. And then everything explodes and the crazy laugh happens.  Episode 24 is probably my favourite of the season. Just all kinds of awesome watching the Black Knights finally succeed. My favourite part is Diethard's smugness to the TV station chief, and it is damn satisfying watching Cornelia go down after being messing with Lelouche all season long."

Lets just let that sink in for a minute. Schneizel seems to be making a pretty shameless attempt to get into Cornelia's pants. I can't tell if she's supposed to be genuinely flattered or just trying not to act too skeeved. Euphie's ""disguise"" is doing nothing to detract attention. Way to wreck the sisterly moment, Nunnally. Then again I guess there is no non-awkward way to invite someone into an incestuous three-way. I feel like there is something morally questionable about Ohgi sleeping with a brain-damaged woman who has no idea who she is. Definitely the first of many lapses in judgment. Emperor Charles all smirkin' cause he knows shit is about to go down. For once Suzaku actually knows what's up. ""Lelouch, you would never shoot me, would you?"" ""No, I would never do that."" Priceless. Aaaaaand the ""Poorly timed Holocaust jokes"" card in Cards Against Humanity takes on a whole new meaning. What exactly was Cornelia's planned course of action when she tells Guilford not to follow her (if she even had one)? You know it just occurred to me this time around: if they had only publicized Euphie's abdication earlier, the massacre would have been avoided because nobody would have any obligation to obey her orders. A slightly more subtle tragedy.   /MST3K"

CodeGeass,2p0tny,JealotGaming,2,Fri Dec 12 18:52:49 2014 UTC,"That quote was from Euphie. All that happened anyway. It would have been much easier for someone else (like Darlton or even Suzaku) to call for a ceasefire if her order hadn't carried all the weight of her rank.   Another question is why neither Cornelia nor Schneizel made any attempt to override the order, since it was explicitly stated in an earlier episode that their authority as viceroy and prime minister carried more weight than Euphemia's. It's possible that this was Cornelia's intention and the main issue was a combo of proximity and not knowing exactly what was going on, but it seems odd that they would not issue such orders from afar despite both of them clearly being totally WTF'd upon learning of the whole situation."
CodeGeass,2p0tny,BlitheCynic,1 point,Fri Dec 12 19:05:04 2014 UTC,"Another question is why neither Cornelia nor Schneizel made any attempt to override the order   It probably all happened too quickly.

Cecile's fangirl face when Schneizel is holding her hand is priceless. Also Bartley seriously needs to back off. What's really so insufferable about Suzaku isn't even his philosophy - it's how self-righteous he is about it. Look, I get it, sometimes working the system makes more sense than trying to fight the system. But that makes a lot more sense as a pragmatic strategy than it does as a moral philosophy. His complete lack of empathy for the people who want to fight the system the old-fashioned way is astonishing. Suzaku seems to have gotten himself caught up in a paradox: he desires to change the system from within, but in order to do so he must infiltrate it completely, which requires him to actually acknowledge his own wishes for change as thought-crime and abandon them as well. ""Shut up! I have to LIVE!"" - Hahahaha Suzaku's geass also seems to have turned him into a right jerk. ""Lloyd!? That philandering playboy!"" omg Destruction friendship montage!"

CodeGeass,2olgjh,BlitheCynic,2,Mon Dec 8 08:27:12 2014 UTC,"It's about time I get in on these.  One thing I have been noticing about the discussions we've had so far is that they've primarily been directed toward finding and ""patching"" plot holes.  Now that isn't necessarily a bad thing and I will admit I do that a lot myself.  But the conclusion I've come to is that plot holes are really a very trite problem when it comes to works of fiction.  There was a time when all i would consider when critiquing fictional works was the plot. The smallest contradiction or oversight in the details would be an instant 1/10 rating  Then some time after seeing Code Geass and Gurren Lagann i realized that what I truly dislike in fiction is a lack of themes, narrative and characterization.  I realized that by only considering the plot I was missing the true root of my dislike; rather than looking at the root of the issue in the themes, narrative and characterization I was instead blaming all the problems on plot alone.  But to look only at the plot is to miss most of what fiction has to offer.  While a coherent plot can be instrumental in providing a suspension of disbelief, at the end of the day it is just a fictional story.  Why does a contradiction in an entirely fictional plot matter?  I conclude that it really doesn't matter beyond breaking the suspension of disbelief.   Now don't take this personally.  In fact go right ahead and look for plot holes!  What would be the point of a discussion that isn't open to ideas?    Basically this is just my counter to all plot holes:  Code Geass offers wonderful themes, narrative and characterization; all with a sly wink that comes from being slightly self aware.  TL;DR  I don't care about plot holes"
CodeGeass,2olgjh,BlitheCynic,4,Mon Dec 8 00:39:54 2014 UTC,My two cents: examining plot holes can often lead to fridge brilliance with regard to themes and characterization.

The fun of watching Code Geass is in the tension and character growth. The detailed mechanics of a fictional world are incredibly hard to keep consistent if imagined in such a creative way as is the case in this show...so, maybe a few elements don't line up perfectly, but errors I consider trivial hardly compromise my viewing experience."

Despite the fact that she is totally unlikable as a person (as are many fan favorites), there was still a lot of potential for her to be developed as a complex, multi-dimensional character. The writers fucked up by making her so over-the-top ridiculous. It's also a real pity that the only overtly queer character in the show has ultimately become known only for her thoroughly mockable sexuality (not to mention that the other more ambiguously queer character is the thoroughly depraved Schneizel, who it seems will literally flirt with anything)."

Yes, they have their honour but cmon, rescuing a princess should matter more than who does the fucking rescuing.  Poor Table-Kun :(  Ah yes, one of my favourite episodes: Zero reveals he is not an 11 but is corroborated as a trustable leader. However, you'd think Ogi and the others would then already start to suspect he's a Brittanian extremist since Japanese and Brittanians are the 2 majorities in Japan with little reason for someone of another nationality to be creating a group such as the black knights  Also damn I really wonder what CC's name is.

CodeGeass,2ogyu8,Solid_Goat,2,Sat Dec 6 19:52:07 2014 UTC,"Lloyd was a sociopath but was very intelligent so he understood how things worked, so at times he made more sense and was serious. No one trusted gottwald."
CodeGeass,2ogyu8,KidCrimson21,2,Sat Dec 6 19:00:53 2014 UTC,"Lloyd only cares about furthering science. He's a genius who could, if he really wanted to, do a lot more than he does. He's also very conscious of himself, and conscious of his limits (as shown by his occasional reliance on Cecil). And of course he's wearing a mask, everybody in the show is.   Gottwald is a follower by nature. Even in part 1 when he was trying to become Viceroy of Area 11, he was only going to be a pawn of the pureblood faction. And really, he doesn't want it any other way. He's content to be a loyal soldier."
CodeGeass,2ogyu8,Aatra,1 point,Sat Dec 6 23:02:15 2014 UTC,"I realized after rewatching that Lloyd makes a really interesting foil for Schneizel. Thoughts?  As far as Gottwald goes, I think it is outside of the Britannian philosophy to remain loyal to those who have been disgraced, regardless of their former accomplishments. This is the only place ever that Viletta actually demonstrates any kind of integrity."

Like how Rakshata Chawla gets mad when Lloyd modified the Guren without her consent. That seems like he may have done that for a reason for her to get mad.  Also as far as Gottwald goes,  the betrayal of Zero by the black knights, you would think someone or himself would have told someone of the power he has to cancel Geass in order to gain trust of Gottwald or Zero. Lelouch is smart shouldn't he have thought of a plan, just for that reason. Some people would have been a little paranoid about something like and would have at least have a plan.  Gottwald would have been a great choice to have people behind him in order to follow Lelouch, not Zero, anywhere he goes."

Sure, it lacks the vengeful bravado, but it would probably be a more effective way of improving the world. ""Guilford, don't treat me as though I'm another one of your women."" LOL So much shaaaade"

CodeGeass,2oewqp,dynokid11,1 point,Sat Dec 6 06:09:38 2014 UTC,"My point is that nobody actually investigated the scene. Even if a forensic investigation would have determined they DID kill themselves, none did. They were literally just going on the word of Zero. It would be ridiculous to jump to the conclusion of a supernatural power, but not to conclude that Zero was somehow responsible, even if they cannot determine exactly how. All I'm saying is it was weird that no one even demonstrated a single shred of doubt about what was by all accounts a really bizarre situation."

CodeGeass,2oewqp,GhostofSora,1 point,Sat Dec 6 16:38:44 2014 UTC,"I thought we were in for another cat episode but then the freakin scenes with the different characters wanting to escape their lives and go into the past, particularly the hot dog vendor and mom were pretty heart-wrenching."
CodeGeass,2ob9c2,SpockNorris,4,Fri Dec 5 00:02:41 2014 UTC,"Requested: 10-hour loop of Suzaku walking with the cat toy and humming How could Cornelia fall for C.C.'s Zero body double trick so easily? As is exploited countless times later on, literally anyone could be in that suit (not to mention the physical incarnation of Zero could very well already be multiple people like the character suits at Disneyland, but no one ever bothers to consider this). It seems almost predictable that if Zero were planning to infiltrate the Britannian force, he would employ a decoy to distract away from that possibility. And yet they just abandon their search for a mole at the first sight of the Zero mask. This episode is supposed to establish Cornelia as a formidable opponent, but at this point she just seems to pick up the idiot ball where Clovis left it."
CodeGeass,2ob9c2,BlitheCynic,3,Fri Dec 5 02:59:22 2014 UTC,"Another observation: Lelouch notes at one point that the imperial siblings are locked in a battle royale for succession because the Emperor is ""forcing them to fight"" for it. However, almost everything else for the rest of the series seems to contradict this:   From the interactions we see between them, the siblings actually seem to have each other's backs more often than not. And even if we chalk this behavior up to deception, none of them seem at all worried about trusting the others. It seems like the only one who might be invested in bumping off a few family members is Schneizel, and his motivations are entirely his own. We later learn that it was precisely this kind of chicanery that ruined Charles' childhood and motivated his whole zany villain scheme. Granted, he doesn't seem to have much concern for his children, but it seems highly unlikely that he would encourage this behavior in them.   So what is the deal with succession? Is that whole bit just Lelouch projecting? I guess this makes a lot of sense, since it is the same  (incorrect) mentality that led him to think his siblings had something to do with Marianne's assassination. Either way, interesting insight into Lelouch's thought process. I suppose there is also the possibility that he is under that impression because Charles used their ""weakness"" as his excuse for exiling Lelouch and Nunnally, when actually his reasons were totally different."
CodeGeass,2ob9c2,BlitheCynic,2,Fri Dec 5 18:07:31 2014 UTC,"I actually feel pretty bad for Nina in this episode since she clearly has a traumatic history, but I'm amazed she had the stupidity say something racist (let alone anything at all) to the guys with submachine guns holding her hostage. Millie and Shirley mouthing off to them after the fact is also appallingly stupid. Do these kids not know what a fucking submachine gun is? Why does Lelouch use the term Elevens in his speech? You'd think this wouldn't endear him much to his own closest allies. SUPER ELECTROMAGNETIC SHRAPNEL CANNON: FIRE!"
CodeGeass,2ob9c2,BlitheCynic,1 point,Fri Dec 5 03:28:35 2014 UTC,"Well the way I saw it was that she ordered one of the divisions to go capture Zero, and Lelouch went with them.  Then when they were out of sight and distracted with the search he got off and entered the tunnel.  It is possible that the remaining divisions were still being searched while he did that."
CodeGeass,2ob9c2,BlitheCynic,1 point,Fri Dec 5 17:05:54 2014 UTC,It's still inexcusably stupid to let the guy who was just clearly resisting opening his hatch go along with the mission.

CodeGeass,2nzq87,seooo13,4,Tue Dec 2 05:35:02 2014 UTC,"Okay so I tried out sub for the first time to watch episodes 1 and 2 (I've seen the dub twice) and I've got to say, the sub just doesn't do it for me. It doesnt have the same feel to it that the dub has. Lelouche doesn't sound like a slim/fit teenage boy in the sub. I've got dual audio files so I think I'll just go back to dub.   Other than that, for the third time watching Code Geass, the right-off-the-bat intensity of the situation of Area 11 is still awesome but there are two things that I've got to nitpick:   I know its for character development but whyyyyy would you sanely step out of the safety of a knightmare just to pick up some dead guy's chess set? How does Lelouche already know how to decently pilot a knightmare without fucking up? Are the controls really that simple? (Then again, Suzaku read a manual and in half an hour becomes a top knightmare pilot for Brittania)"
CodeGeass,2nzq87,DuskOfDawn23,7,Tue Dec 2 00:18:10 2014 UTC,That's interesting because I'm the opposite.  I've seen it twice subbed and now the dub sounds too American.   I plan to stick with it though...

While it is an earlier generation frame, apparently the later gen frames were based off it so I'm guessing the controls wouldn't be too different."

CodeGeass,2nzq87,Gamerguy_141297,5,Tue Dec 2 04:37:28 2014 UTC,"This is a stretch, but here goes at patching the plot holes:   It's figurative. He didn't actually pick up the chess set - he just saw it and used it as a framework for envisioning his strategies. It would be pretty dumb for him to be holding up chess pieces while piloting even if he did manage to snag the set, so I'm calling metaphor. His life-long goal is to destroy Britannia, so he's probably done a lot of research into their military technology. Who knows how secure the information is, but it is the case that even in the real world you can find Youtube videos detailing fighter jet cockpit controls and the like from which maybe a very intelligent person could figure out the basics. Keep in mind, Lelouch is a pretty sucky pilot. Also, I'm pretty sure Suzaku already had some training (Lloyd mentions a simulator)."
CodeGeass,2nzq87,DuskOfDawn23,1 point,Tue Dec 2 02:08:07 2014 UTC,"To answer question #2 Lelouche is extremely talented at learning new things fast, as you saw when  Spoiler: he was able to do the calculations for the fleja (don't judge my spelling), extremely fast without having gone through that before. And Suzaku was already extremely talented when it came to handling knightmares, the Lancelot probably wasn't too much different control wise. So by reading the Manuel he was able to pick up on some differences."
CodeGeass,2nzq87,Oareo,1 point,Tue Dec 2 00:32:04 2014 UTC,I'm just surprised at how easily Kallen trusted a transmission coming from an unknown person. Could've been the enemy trying to lure them someplace
CodeGeass,2nzq87,KidCrimson21,5,Tue Dec 2 01:27:23 2014 UTC,That was actually answered by Lelouche himself when he said that the Brittanians were moving in a way that showed confidence (in winning) enough to not need to rely on trickery

But if she really thought it could be a Duke's son, I don't see what else she could have reasonably done. We have to assume so. I think the real reason is the story didn't have Knightmares at all at first, and couldn't fit in how/why the various characters would be good at piloting them. So it must be very intuitive."
CodeGeass,2nzq87,KidCrimson21,2,Tue Dec 2 01:52:17 2014 UTC,I thought that the first episode did a great job of showing how Lelouch lived his life and how he viewed the world as it was; hating Brittania but given up on fixing it. And how much all of that changed when he got the power to change it. As well as how fast he went into motion.

CodeGeass,2nq33y,BlitheCynic,6,Sat Nov 29 02:54:07 2014 UTC,"Euphemia's name was never cleared, and by all indications it looks like it never will. Good! The circumstances were admittedly a bit contrived, but the end result was arguably the best twist/moral conflict that Lelouch had to deal with. It symbolically threw every life and reputation he has already ruined right into his face. And this time he can't bullshit away his guilt and wrongdoing by calling it a necessary evil. Don't get me wrong, I like Lelouch as a character and Britannia needs to go, but that does't mean he can get away without criticism.  In addition, this figuratively showed what kind of world these people live in. The kind where, completely by accident, a nice person will be put down in history as a despicable monster. And then her mangled remains used as a stepping stone for the very person who ruined and used her. All of a sudden Nunnally's life is not the only thing at stake."
CodeGeass,2nq33y,ThatEconGuy,2,Sat Nov 29 03:47:53 2014 UTC,Nope. Rather I think people just slowly forgot about it since Emperor Lelouch was so much worse.
CodeGeass,2nq33y,OtakuMecha,4,Sat Nov 29 05:50:48 2014 UTC,It was only cleared to the people who knew of the Geass and could link the massacre of the Japanese to it. Needless to say only the most elite group of people know what really happened with Euphemia. Lelouch even says that he was going to kill a lot of people just so the general public can forget about what Euphie did.
CodeGeass,2nq33y,Maoux,2,Sat Nov 29 08:20:59 2014 UTC,No. It's one of the main themes of the series.
CodeGeass,2nq33y,Aatra,1 point,Sat Nov 29 04:11:08 2014 UTC,No. Announcing that Euphimia was magicked into killing people would make the people think everyone was crazy.

CodeGeass,2nj68p,trowawufei,3,Thu Nov 27 13:46:12 2014 UTC,"Well another huge blow against him was that he didn't reveal his identity. And at that moment when they cornered him, they would have unmasked him. If he was the person that Schnizel said he was, his position would have looked a lot better. Not only that, but everything that Schnizel brought to them was true, at least from an evidentiary point of view. What he told them would have confirmed all of their fears, fears that most of them either kept private or amongst a few people. Overall, his evidence was extensive and damning."

CodeGeass,2nj68p,Sci-Pi,2,Thu Nov 27 01:50:50 2014 UTC,"Put yourself in his shoes though. How are you going to explain to Suzaku, who absolutely despises you and already thinks your'e a terrible person and a liar, that your Geass malfunctioned that ONE time? Suzaku might have killed him for the percieved arrogance of trying to shrug off what to him looks like obvious guilt. Lelouch realized he had to give ground and admit that he did things it looks like he did so that he could protect Nunnally."
CodeGeass,2nj68p,Raenryong,3,Thu Nov 27 03:56:26 2014 UTC,"It certainly wasn't like Lelouch, that's why I feel like it was part of his plan. If he was prepared to pour over the truth of his actions, he would have mentioned his Geass, Suzaku knew about it at this time so it wouldn't be an issue. Lelouch noticeably made himself sound incredibly sadistic, and given Suzaku's righteous nature, the ambush and recording should have been easily predicted. Using this, Lelouch was able to use Guilford to escape and mount a counter-attack. Furthermore, by allowing the Black Nights to turn on him, he was able to make the public believe Zero's death, allowing for a global rejoice upon Zero's return in the Zero Requiem and thus preventing further large scale conflict. Or the writers got lazy and I'm just over analyzing things."
CodeGeass,2nj68p,dc880610,2,Thu Nov 27 02:36:28 2014 UTC,"I think Lelouch was simply completely desperate and saw no other way to appeal to Suzaku. I don't think that was part of the Zero Requiem plan; simply too risky and with too many negatives, even for Lelouch's gambits."
CodeGeass,2nj68p,ThatEconGuy,2,Thu Nov 27 04:48:04 2014 UTC,"I'm inclined to agree; I doubt Lelouch would try to plan that far ahead, with so much out of his control."

CodeGeass,2n6j25,trowawufei,3,Sun Nov 23 19:28:13 2014 UTC,"Well, to be fair, their actions were still very dumb. Schneizel had enforced Britannian policies for years and he would have total control over the entire world once Damocles reached a certain altitude, but the Black Knights kept going after Lelouch's depleted forces without paying any attention to Schneizel? It just shows how incompetent their leadership (read: Ohgi) became in the aftermath of Lelouch's escape. They geared all of their objectives around the rescue of the UFN representatives and revenge on Lelouch, and lost sight of the good of the people of the UFN. They should have allowed Schneizel to destroy the Avalon immediately, then turned on him and attempted to exhaust the Blaze Luminous with their combined firepower."

If they'd killed him off during the Battle of Fuji, I would've been too distracted by my absolute glee to care about any of these plotholes.  Also IMO Xingke acting like an idiot as well was rooted in his big-brother-and/or-pedophile thing he had going on with Tianzi."

CodeGeass,2n6j25,redkiller4all,1 point,Tue Nov 25 01:29:18 2014 UTC,"Schniezel never enforced his father's policy. The reason he got the black knights on his side was he campaign saying how bad his farther was and he wants a peaceful rule ( in secret his peace would be brought about by fear). The is also the fact of lelouch holding the U.N hostage, using his geass on millions, and using his position to kill anyone who is against him. It is the whole thought of the enemy of my enemy is my allie. Also I just remembered the black knights didn't join Schniezel, he flew to there ship and became allies by saying zero can't be trusted. Which once lelouch became hitler they realized that schniezel can be trusted."
CodeGeass,2n6j25,trowawufei,1 point,Mon Nov 24 14:04:49 2014 UTC,"( in secret his peace would be brought about by fear)   There was nothing secret about it. He was placing a giant weapon of mass destruction within striking distance of every point on Earth, right in front of the Black Knights. And ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is a complete fallacy. It's not something that should ever be used in the decision-making process of a powerful military force. You treat anyone whose goals are incompatible with your own as your enemy, and even if you make temporary alliances you should not lose sight of trying to stop them (which the Black Knights did with Schneizel). The Black Knights prioritized their overall strategic objectives terribly, that cannot be denied."

He wanted to bring peace to the land and stop Lelouchs rule. That was the exact same as the Black Knights. He worked and gained there trust and joined them because they had the same goals and beliefs (this isn't counting his secret plan). It was just like when zero himself joined, but this time they actually knew what schniezel wanted."
CodeGeass,2n6j25,JordanReaps,3,Tue Nov 25 03:21:44 2014 UTC,So them turning over to the black knights made sense to me. I also understood why lelouch didn't tell the black knights that commanding Euphy to kill was an accident. What i don't understand is why lelouch didn't tell suzuku that commanding Euphy was an accident. At the end of part one he could have easily told him when they were alone on the island. Also near the middle and end of part 2 there were plenty of opportunities to tell him instead of acting dumb and saying he did it on purpose. That is one thing i never like about the series.

Like, yeah, it was an accident, but he felt so bad about a) the fact that he let it happen and b) the fact that he turned it to his advantage that he internalized the fault and felt obligated to accept responsibility for the whole mess."
CodeGeass,2n6j25,BlitheCynic,1 point,Mon Nov 24 16:38:29 2014 UTC,"Not to mention that saying ""I'm a huge fuckup who accidentally compelled a nice young girl to commit mass murder and then killed her"" doesn't exactly make a good case for his competence as a leader."
CodeGeass,2n61y2,KhevaKins,11,Sun Nov 23 14:34:56 2014 UTC,"Nuclear weapons were never invented in the Code Geass Timeline. There was something like World War 1, but World War 2 and the Cold War never happened. Nina's work into nuclear fission layer the groundwork for the first nuclear weapon, the FLEIJA, which is basically a modern fission weapon that is started with Sakuradite rather than high-explosives, except it produces some weird field that just removes the space inside it. I'd say Australia just managed to remain neutral because every animal there tried to kill everyone and even Britannia doesn't want it."
CodeGeass,2n61y2,Sci-Pi,7,Mon Nov 24 01:03:09 2014 UTC,As an Australian I must endorse this answer
CodeGeass,2n61y2,yellowbluesky,4,Mon Nov 24 10:39:46 2014 UTC,"We know New Zealand is Britannian territory so Australia is obviously known about. So perhaps they are the Switzerland in this alternate world and maintain full neutrality like Japan, but the Japanese got attacked because they had a lot of that Sakuradite or whatever. Australia's probably not important in the eyes of any empire. Of course, these are just my thoughts and opinions."
CodeGeass,2n61y2,SeKrayZed,2,Sun Nov 23 17:33:20 2014 UTC,"I'm fairly certain Australia had no nukes, lad. Britannia invented the nuke with the help of Mrs Table-kun."
CodeGeass,2n61y2,SigmundFreud,0,Sun Nov 23 23:33:06 2014 UTC,"It's probably a territory of Britannia the same way that it was a colony of the British Empire in the real world.

CodeGeass,2n4hr2,SeKrayZed,3,Sun Nov 23 00:25:53 2014 UTC,"Depends on your opinion, some people think he is alive with some evidence, other think he is dead, no right or wrong answer. I personally believe he is alive from title CODE Geass (the code is immortality), and the fact that nannally saw visions of lelouch's past, when only people with the code can do that. We can assume that they eventually figured out that lelouch planned the whole thing, the only people that we know that actually knew about the zero requiem is nannally, suzaku, lelouch, CC, Jeremiah, and Sayoko. Yes Suzaku is supposed to stay Zero forever (more in question 10) Because if I am correct Marianne left Anya's body when she went into CC's world. To live...? Sorry don't get the question I don't think so, because rolo could stop others perspective of time. Pretty sure, in the wiki it says she shot him with a silent pistol. Not sure which guy you mean. Not sure, after she got her memories back i guess she just stuck with him. The whole talk about geass was a metaphor, the ""geass"" lelouch was giving suzaku was his responsibility to live as zero and give up his identity as suzaku. It also is a allusion for what lelouch has actually done with his powers ""You will sacrifice your own happiness for the world"" both what suzaku must do, and what lelouch has done. What lelouch wanted to get rid of all the prejudice and racisim that had corrupted the world, have all the people unite under a common enemy (lelouch), and have him killed to bring forth an era of peace.   Hope that helps somewhat, this is mostly from my memory and a little bit of the wiki."

Fifth question (reddit numbering system is stupid), Before Rolo saved Lelouche from execution by the Black Knights, Kallen was trying to protect him. He then told her she was his greatest pawn. Then after Kallen said farewell to him, he whispered to her that she had to continue living.  Eighth question, Pretty sure he was Anya's partner during school, also saved Kallen from falling to her death after fighting Suzaku and causing his ""death""."
CodeGeass,2n4hr2,samcuu,3,Sun Nov 23 02:45:13 2014 UTC,"Fifth question. I think it was just his last message to Kallen before he died (he accepted his fate, he knew he could't run away), telling her to continue living. Maybe he has some feelings for her.  Honestly I just take it as a plot device, so Kallen could realize that Lelouch wasn't that much of a bad guy etc."

I am pretty sure Kallen did, did anyone else?   Pretty sure Tohdoh did.But i don't think Cornelia has.   Does (forgot his name ) Lelouche's friend stay as Zero forever since he 's suppose to be dead?    Did you listen to what Lelouch said to Suzaku when he was stabbed?   If Marianne was in Anya why is Anya still alive after the episode when Lelouche killed his father?   It was a Geass,Anya is just restored from it's influence.   What did Lelouche mean when he told Kallen to live, when he got betrayed and Rolo saved him?   Because he cared for Kallen and didn't want her to die.   Did Lelouche ever use his Geass against Rolo?   Presumably not, he said that he didn't need to.   CC killed Mao ?   C.C. killed Mao.   Why'd that one Round Knight guy with the Tristan join the Black Knights?   Is there a reason for him to not do so?He can't exactly join the Knights of the Round for Lelouch,since he didn't support him.   Why is Anya with Jeremiah at the end?   Presumably after every conversation between Marianne(Anya) and Charles, Charles wiped Anya's memories. So Jeremiah used his Geass Canceller to restore Anya's memories.   When he stabbed Lelouche, Lelouche told him about something geass-related, and he accepted the Geass. What went on there?   Lelouch put a 'Geass' on Suzaku, to force him to stay as Zero and bear the mask for the rest of his life.   So Lelouche ""died"" and world peace occured. I know all hatred was suppose to be pointed towards him but isn't independence what the Japanese been fighting for this entire time? Unless Britannia joined the new Federation thing   Yup, Britannia joins the UFN."
CodeGeass,2n4hr2,Sci-Pi,1 point,Sun Nov 23 06:53:17 2014 UTC,"Just going to give my 2 cents for question 11. During the Cold War, Ronald Reagan of the US and Gorbachev of the Soviet Union agreed that if ever faced with a common enemy such as an Earth destroying meteor or an alien invasion, the two rivals would work together. This is paralleled in the Code Geass universe, by becoming an enemy to everyone, Lelouch effectively makes even bitter enemies allies as everyone now had a common enemy. When Lelouch ""dies"", the remaining countries no longer have anyone to fight an large scale warfare is effectively abolished. Resistance groups Lelouch did not stamp out would lose support as many separatists would favour the liberal global government that functions to reduce poverty and improve wellbeing over an independent nation, resulting in the slow decline of global separatism. Also, with Zero now showing allegiance to Nunnally, the symbol of liberation is now associated with the global government Lelouch set up, preventing the break-up of Lelouch's global empire as freedom is now found with Nunnally rather than against her."
CodeGeass,2n4hr2,Aatra,1 point,Mon Nov 24 01:18:11 2014 UTC,"It's a little bit up in the air, but I don't think so. We're never shown a moment where she was told, and I don't think she's the kind of person Lelouch'd enlist. I think that she was simply part of a rebel force that saw their opportunity.  Yes. He wouldn't be able to take the mask off without causing a huge uproar. And seeing as he was Lelouch's Knight of Zero, Suzaku is probably the second most hated man in the world. He may reveal his identity to Nunnally, however.  Because she left Anya to enter into C's world, leaving Anya with her body back.  He was trying to show her that he still cared about her, even though it seemed he was a horrible manipulative monster. He trusted her to see through everything at some point, and she did when Suzaku killed him.    6.. Strangely, no. ironically, Rolo is probably the only person Lelouch wouldn't need it for. He'd have believed anything.    Yes.  Because his Emperor was dead and his killer took his throne. The Knights of the Round are loyal to the ruler, not the land. He needed some way to fight Lelouch, and the BK were his best option.  A little unclear, but I interperted that as because he had the Geass Canceler. He used that to free her from the prison that Charles and Marriane built around her with their Geass. She probably felt a huge debt to him, or soemthing like that.  He was speaking of Geass as a symbol, not his actual geass.  ""World Peace occurred"" for a short while, at least. My interpretation is that there was an unpresceneted period of peace, and that the Nukes were destroyed in the sun along with Damoclease. But humans are humans, and humans fight. The world would have descended into chaos at some point once again. The point was to give them a historical figure that everyone could point to and hate, making a more moral world as the result.  And really, Japan's independance was only Lelouch's means to an end. Once the United Federation of Nations was formed (with Japan as a key member), that idea went away."

CodeGeass,2n0uvn,Pyrelord,2,Sat Nov 22 19:43:56 2014 UTC,"Code Geass, to me, was the most influential work of fiction on a personal level since Calvin and Hobbes (the comic, not the philosophers) back in sixth grade. I've internalized so much of the proud, arrogant Byronic archetype that I couldn't imagine being any other way. It wasn't just the show; I'd been slowly shifting in that direction for a while. It just really crystallized everything that had been below the surface.  It was such an unlikely coincidence that I ran into it, too. I saw a video of the top 15 anime openings, or something like that, and they showed the first opening somewhere in the middle. It really drew me in with the music, and how much I liked the characters' appearance. Zero seemed like an enigmatic romantic, CC intrigued me and Lelouch was, well, the beautiful purple-eyed brooder we all know. Also I just wanted to know how the three groups shown one after another (Cornelia & Britannian military, Ashford students and Black Knights) tied together and related to each other. It looked like a huge and interesting cast with a ton of different settings woven together. I didn't anticipate that it would be quite as dark, though, the first opening is incredibly happy compared to the actual series.  Anyways, I know the feeling of wonder you're going through. I want to watch it all over again, because I feel sad that I don't always cry anymore when Shirley loses her memory or dies, or when I see the ending. I felt so emotionally monotone when I started the series- not sad, but stagnant. I needed something with huge emotional impact, and boy did it fit the bill. CG for life!  Any series particularly like it?"

For a multitude of reasons that would take me forever to get into.  ...But since that would probably never happen, realistically speaking, I'm pretty sure Lelouch x C.C. is the most logical answer. Kallen x Lelouch isn't so bad, but I always remember back to the first season how Kallen's love was for Zero, while Shirley's love was for Lelouch. While Kallen did eventually come to terms with Zero's identity (and Shirley never really got the chance), it was C.C. who was there to witness both sides of the man all along. While Lelouch was obviously troubled by receiving the Geass from her, ultimately he was grateful towards her being his accomplice and for giving him the power to make this possible. Out of the three ""love interests"", it seems as though C.C. is the only one whom Lelouch himself truly returned feelings for.  And of course Suzaku x Euphemia, but that's... well, you know.

CodeGeass,2mi2wd,brater8,11,Sun Nov 16 22:20:42 2014 UTC,"The whole show is based on repeating events that happened, and in many ways R2 is a mirror image of R1. So many events correlate to how they happened the first time, like Lelouch guiding the terrorists after getting his power (Ep 1 of R2 and Ep 2 of R1) or using the terrain against the Britannians when he fights Guildford (like he did against Cornelia's forces at the end of R1) or blowing up the methane underwater (like when he used the Guren's Wave Surger to cause an earthquake).  There are dozens more examples of these and the show is very much about regret and taking responsibility for the actions the characters take. The next time you watch the show look out for these moments and they'll be incredibly obvious, the show is filled with foreshadowing and nods to what will happen to these characters."
CodeGeass,2mi2wd,RetroMedux,2,Mon Nov 17 00:00:58 2014 UTC,"There's also a huge amount of influence from Suzaku. The two of them exchange a lot of personality traits as the show goes on, and by the end of it Lelouch is more idealistic than Suzaku. The Zero Requiem is a very huge dose of idealism that I'm not even sure R1 Suzaku would have bought. I think that Lelouch also adopted Suzaku's deathwish, and in a sick way he may have enjoyed dying a martyr. Suzaku, on the other hand, became the perfect Zero."

During Euphemia's massacre he was shocked and appalled at what his actions led to.  As during those two months he ruled he was called a Demon, and that during the finale people were talking about how he'd kill the families of those who dissented, I'd say that he didn't consider the idea until much later."
CodeGeass,2mi2wd,Ritxarin,1 point,Mon Nov 17 21:21:13 2014 UTC,"It was his plan all along, and I think he makes it clear from the first episode when he says to the guards ""Or have you finally realized; the only ones who should kill are those who are prepared to be killed"".

CodeGeass,2mi2wd,megacookie,1 point,Mon Nov 17 22:46:01 2014 UTC,From the writers view sacrificing himself to make everyone have a common goal is gold. In reality after shnizel dies it will all just fall back in place and maybe Japan won't be as subjugated but somewhere else in the world will be in only a matter of time.
CodeGeass,2mi2wd,skullshark54,6,Mon Nov 17 02:47:08 2014 UTC,"Why does it really matter what happens to Schneizel? He was Geass'd to mindlessly obey everything Zero (now Suzaku) says, so he's not particularly important or powerful any more if I'm not mistaken. I agree the world peace Lelouch brought is temporary, but he didn't aim to fix the world indefinitely, just to give humanity a chance to recover and right some wrongs."
CodeGeass,2mi2wd,megacookie,1 point,Mon Nov 17 14:30:05 2014 UTC,Exactly once shniezel dies it's back to the old ways and it's only a matter of time before geass is rediscovered by someone else. If he wanted to fix the world he should have done it himself as emperor but no I'll just assassinate myself and everything will be fucking great.
CodeGeass,2mi2wd,skullshark54,5,Mon Nov 17 16:17:13 2014 UTC,"You don't understand. It doesn't really matter if Schneizel dies, Nunnaly is Empress, Suzaku is still playing the same function as Zero but with the Black Knights being more like a UN peacekeeping force (except actually kickass capable) instead of revolutionary/terrorists which they dont need to be anymore."
CodeGeass,2mi2wd,megacookie,1 point,Mon Nov 17 16:36:43 2014 UTC,And when they all inevitably die some Genghis Khan type is going to seize control and we will be back to where we started except maybe in a new location being suppressed.

CodeGeass,2mi2wd,Aatra,0,Mon Nov 17 20:10:13 2014 UTC,"Charles didn't conquer he was a tyrant who was born into his power no one is going to conquer them but this Ghengis Khan type will be born into the royal family sooner or later or hell he doesnt even have to like war at all they need is one shitty ruler and everything goes back to how it was. With the new emperor just being a puppet for the other rulers. Point is a generation from now whatever safeguards lelouch suzaku or nunnaly made will be gone and everything will go back to some degree of fucked. And Lelouch was only hated because he made himself hated on purpose he is a PR master if he wanted the love of the masses he could have taken it and ruled fairly and probably be the best ruler ever. But instead he decides to assassinate himself. So what Zero can be a symbol? most of the rest of the government of Britannia is still going to be against Zero.(unless he geased literally everyone) Frankly if it weren't for plot armor, killing Zero or Suzaku or anyone really would take one drone strike or a bomb , or maybe next time Zero monologues he will grant some sniper his wet dream and get a hole in his face. To conclude Lelouch fucked up due to his desire to martyr himself and failed to see that his death would accomplish nothing in the long run."
CodeGeass,2mi2wd,BlitheCynic,1 point,Mon Nov 17 17:28:11 2014 UTC,Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Even Lelouch wouldn't be free from that.
CodeGeass,2mi2wd,skullshark54,2,Wed Nov 19 18:25:09 2014 UTC,"There's definitely some truth in this, which I why I thought the ending was either silly or (more) tragic depending on how you look at it. The fact of the matter is that a common enemy is only any good as long as s/he is alive and kicking. With the common enemy eliminated, it will take maybe 5 minutes of celebration before old faults crack open again. Just look at how the Cold War broke out almost immediately between former allies following Hitler's defeat.   If anything was accomplished by the Zero Requiem, it is not that the world was united in the hatred of a common enemy, but under the salvation of a common savior. If peace persists, it will be because everyone feels indebted enough to Zero that they will be too afraid to raise a hand against him. After he's gone, though, the world will probably fall into warring factions again pretty quickly.  I also think this is different from the Euphemia situation. Her evil actions continued to be a uniting force after her death because she was viewed as an agent of the Britannian empire, a collective oppressor which persisted after her death. Lelouch appeared to act as a lone wolf without even the backing of the rest of his own empire.  I'm not sure what you were getting at with the Schneizel part though. He fucked up; he's done. Got no hand in this brave new world."
CodeGeass,2mi2wd,BlitheCynic,1 point,Mon Nov 17 19:34:01 2014 UTC,Schnizel becomes emperor next after Lelouch and then Nunnaly (If he doesnt become a daddy) so once Shcnizel dies Nunnaly becomes emperor. Now Nunnaly is a good person but a good emperor fucking probably not. So if the world doesn't get fucked up under her rule then it will under her kids (If that is even possible) or whoever gets it next if I remember correctly there are a fuckton of princes and bastards and grandbastards lying around waiting for their turn to play king. Oh and they are all still shooting for the throne so it is very possible she could be assassinated like a week after the show ends or whenever. Point is Lelouch just wanted to martyr himself and he obviously didn't think long run because if he did he would say hey dying is a bad idea I need to keep an eye on all this shit instead of doing literally the dumbest move you can make. I get that the theme was supposed to be attoning for his sins and whatnot being killed by Suzaku but from a political view that was a fucking stupid move on his part.
CodeGeass,2mi2wd,skullshark54,1 point,Mon Nov 17 20:22:33 2014 UTC,"Why would Schneizel necessarily become emperor? It seems that Lelouch's antics have officially disrupted the royal lineage, not to mention we don't even know how succession was determined in the first place (Schneizel is the second oldest son and third oldest child of the emperor, which is not to mention the various theories that the emperor's over 9000 kids was meant to amount to a social Darwinist battle royale for succession). At this point, anyway, Schneizel has been established as way too evil to be allowed to be emperor, and if he did ascend the throne officially, it would probably be as Suzaku's puppet. Personally, I don't think Suzaku would abuse the geass in that way, nor would he allow Schneizel to sit the throne independently thanks to the shit he pulled. I would guess Nunnally will become empress with Zerozaku as a top advisor or the position of monarch will be abolished entirely (with the former being a temporary solution until the latter kicks in)."
CodeGeass,2mi2wd,BlitheCynic,1 point,Mon Nov 17 21:16:53 2014 UTC,"Schneizel is next in line I don't remember where but it was mentioned somewhere in R2. Schneizal may obey Suzaku as emperor as Lelouch planned or maybe the Geass dies with Lelouch and Schneizel goes and does whatever the fuck he wants who the fuck knows about that (The writers sure forgot to mention anything about that). Any who as heroic (OR FUCKING STUPID) as Lelouchs death was odds are it wont cause the entire structure of the Britannian government to change into a Democracy, there will be another emperor and there will be one after that and one after that UNZ ANOTHER ONE UNZ AGAIN, that's how it has been for something like 100 generations so that wont change. As for Schneizel being ""way too evil"" 1  I have no idea what you are talking about there 2 Even if I am forgetting he led a holocaust or something like that he would still be considered a ""good guy"" to Britannia regardless of whatever war crimes he committed to the Japs. To the rest of the royalty he is still considered the heir and future Emperor (Assuming they follow rules of succession similar to our own history). So assuming the Geass is still active (EVEN THOUGH LELOUCH IS DEAD AND THAT WOULD MAKE NO SENSE) Schnitzelhoiden would effectively be Suzakus bitch and that fixes some of the problems they have in the immediate future. Now lets say Geass wears off Schneizal everything would instantly go back to fucked. game over good show A for effort you will all be executed in the morning. But lets say Snitzelbro isnt a factor even if Nunnaly becomes Empress I bet my left testicle she would suck at it sure Suzaku would be pulling the strings but I don't have much faith in him either. None of them could maintain the absolute control that the ruthless Charles did. The empire would start to have bits and chunks seperating and sooner or later shit is fucked and Flaias will be launched every which way. Now lets say everything goes perfect Snitzelbro is Suzeros bitch then Nunnaly is next in line. Everything will be fine for some time who knows how long. But then a Calligula (or a Joffrey) would be born to the throne eventually and shit would once again be fucked from there. Final point Lelouchs plan guarantees peace for (Ill be generous and give him say) 50 years but then after that it will be fair game for a Tyrant like Charles to assume the throne eventually and start some sweet sweet genocide making Lelouch moot."

To the rest of the royalty he is still considered the heir and future Emperor (Assuming they follow rules of succession similar to our own history).   He nuked the capital and was ready to kill ""one or two billion people"" according to the English dub. He was bad enough that even Cornelia, who seems to have had a benevolent relationship with him before and could be considered a war criminal herself, decided he had to go. I feel like it is safe to say that he both committed a holocaust AND has not endeared himself to the rest of the royal family (the ones he didn't nuke that is).   Schnitzelhoiden would effectively be Suzakus bitch and that fixes some of the problems they have in the immediate future.   Again, I feel like Suzaku would think it too unethical to use him as a puppet. Especially given that Suzaku resents and feels violated by his own 'live' geass, it is likely he would be reluctant to abuse vestiges of the geass. If he takes advantage of the geass at all, it would probably be to get him to step down.   None of them could maintain the absolute control that the ruthless Charles did.   This is why the empire will necessarily break down. No one is going to deliberately instate a ruthless ruler to bring shit together again. That would just be going back to square one. Especially since Japan gains sovereignty at the end, it is likely Britannia will fall apart entirely into numerous independent nations Soviet Union-style."

CodeGeass,2mi2wd,BlitheCynic,1 point,Mon Nov 17 23:29:05 2014 UTC,"You can't exactly abdicate.  Lelouch abdicated and was disowned.  So was Euphemia.  But eh, since Charles is dead, let's assume you can.  Just because Odysseus was mediocre does not mean he didn't have an interest in the throne.  He certainly did, even leading armies against Lelouch under Schneizel's orders.  He just isn't as skilled at anything as his siblings.  But yeah, he probably died at Pendragon.  Schneizel certainly would be next in line, but as Suzaku controls him, and Suzaku is certainly in support of Nunally.  What I don't get is why Cornelia wasn't placed higher up.  She has more of a claim to the throne, and would have the support of the common people, as she was apparently affiliated with the remains of the Black Knights."
CodeGeass,2mi2wd,skullshark54,2,Mon Nov 17 23:54:48 2014 UTC,"You can't exactly abdicate. Lelouch abdicated and was disowned. So was Euphemia. But eh, since Charles is dead, let's assume you can.   Yeah, I always figured he'd abdicate after Charles died. He just seemed too willing to submit to Schneizel.   What I don't get is why Cornelia wasn't placed higher up.   Maybe this is just more of my headcanon, but I didn't get the impression that Cornelia had any interest in the throne from the get-go, as she seemed content in acting as the empire's iron fist. Maybe it was just her readiness to turn over Area 11 to Euphemia after the rebels were subdued, but it seemed she didn't care much for politics. I figure that this would continue to be her role after the ending, especially since she seems to have come to trust Suzaku."
CodeGeass,2mi2wd,BlitheCynic,1 point,Tue Nov 18 00:07:29 2014 UTC,"Suzaku nuked Tokyo (If that is what you mean by capital). Schneizel nuked some random villages and that may have peeved Cornelia but none of the other royalty seem to give a fuck about it or hate him for any reason I can think that is plot related.(I also am pretty sure he didn't kill any royalty) So Schneizel still looks to be the front runner in the eyes of the Brittanians that matter (And by Succession rules he still is numero uno no matter what.) If Suzaku feels its unethical then he is the wrong man for the job of effectively ruling half the planet. As for the Empire 2 things can happen. If Suzaku and Nunnaly take control of the Empire, their new policies and ideals will most likely lead to a civil war with the other royalty and numbered knights and then Britannia goes down USSR style. Before my second scenario remember that Charles would be absent for months at a time in his magical world and that the Brittanian Empire runs like a well oiled machine with a structured command line and can more or less conquer countries without the Emperor lifting a finger. Now what is most likely to happen is. Nothing. A new Emperor Whether it is Schneizel Suzaku or Nunnally will be put in place and they will all most likely be assassinated and replaced and Britannia goes on to rule the world."

I admit i was a bit confused how just in the power of one touch nunally realised lelouche was faking his evilness the whole time.   suzaku's zero is going to solely exist to keep princess nunally safe, and be just which is all lelouche wanted anyway, that his sister be safe in a new gentler world. I expect that she's basically empress of britannia and because she's so calm and nice and peaceful she'd make a good ruler, with zero as her sword and shield.  Was a bit miffed that kallen didn't weep more, maybe it was the english dub or something but they dont make it clear enough the resident players that were in on the scheme.  I do like lelouche's last words to suzaku were that his punishment was to never have a life and continue to live selflessly as zero. Basically because the whole fricking time zero/lelouche is trying to tell him to understand the corruption in the system, and suzaku just ain't seeing it, that they had to force him to be a personality free knight for nunally was great.  There's also great personal loss and tragedy in lelouche's tale. After all he knows everyone would hate him, the millions of people he's killed, the fact his loves, euphemia (sisterly), shirley and kallen and countless others would be lost to him. I mean you can really see that that personal sacrifice angle necessary for his scheme to work was extensive. if you love people keep them away from you  great show"

I also think I need to watch dune saga now, but touching him didn't give Nunnaly her epiphany, it was the fact that zero was able to break through the defenses and kill Lelouche without any trouble. If he wanted to, Lelouche could have taken Suzaku out in an instant before he even got to his transport. Once she realized that this was a set up, she was able to piece it together since she's the one who knew Lelouche the best."
CodeGeass,2m2lkt,SPRDestro,1 point,Thu Nov 20 02:45:12 2014 UTC,"good points.  i agree there was a bit on the clip though. where as lelouche tumbles towards her, when she touches his hand she sort of has a feeling of shock and surprise, visibly different to her earlier feelings and then there's a very brief montage of all the interplay that went on with suzaku, the emperor, and lelouche showing that somehow when she felt the touch she got all that info somehow"
CodeGeass,2m2lkt,wildmetacirclejerk,2,Thu Nov 20 02:50:47 2014 UTC,"Lelouch obtains Code from Charles, which then causes the flashback you see with Nunally. Touching a person with Code makes you experience their past."

CodeGeass,2m2lkt,brater8,9,Fri Nov 14 00:37:20 2014 UTC,"well no, everyone who got there code were given/took it from whoever gave them geass. However Lelouche got his code and geass from two different people so he got to gain a code and keep his geass, therefore achieving Code Geass.  (this is just a theory BTW, but it's one i personally believe to be true)"

An outstanding soldier, pilot, and leader, able to not only fight on the front lines, but inspire devotion and courage from those who follow her.  Yet outside of her duties as royalty and as a soldier, she is compassionate and kindhearted like her sister.  Despite her upbringing, she recognises Suzaku's worth and loyalty, and overcomes her bias against Elevens to elevate him to true knighthood after he gains her respect.  She is devoted in return to the men under command, genuinely cares for their well-being, and seeks to give them the chance for glory and to prove their worth (and not steal it from them)."

Suzaku seems like an idiot idealist that fails to realise he's dealing with essentially a Nazi regime here. Lelouche seems to be a dark knight lento atreides type dude. 'We will hunt him because he can take it'. My only sadness is that he didn't once let his personality mask slip it would seem. I wanted him to end up with kallen.

CodeGeass,2l0nw5,AskPortalPonies,2,Sun Nov 2 00:09:30 2014 UTC,I recommend reading the 'Dauntless' fanfic for this if you like reading. The author takes the story from the idea of Lelouch being captured by Clovis and returned to Britannia as a Prince. He tries to accomplish the same goals as the anime but from a new direction. It's 97 chapters of epic but still needs finishing.

CodeGeass,2l0nw5,jramos037,2,Tue Nov 18 20:38:17 2014 UTC,"Agreed man.  Code Geass to me is like one of the most perfect animes out there.  What I really liked about the show is the evolution of technology throughout the show.  You can truly see a major difference from the beginning of the show to the end.  I also loved the intelligence and the strategic battles the show had.  To me, Death Note is the only other show that I know of that uses intense mind battles.  Overall, I do believe Code Geass remains one of the top animes on my list.  Always one of the first ones I ask anime watchers if they have seen it."
CodeGeass,2l0nw5,wildmetacirclejerk,2,Sat Nov 8 21:22:12 2014 UTC,"Its funny, my first anime was death note and I thought no one could top light in the genius stakes. But lelouche is better. Mainly because he sacrifices everything for the greater good including himself"
CodeGeass,2l0nw5,insanity_pianist,1 point,Wed Nov 12 07:31:00 2014 UTC,Both Death Note and Code Geass remind me of an epic game of chess (even though none of the chess positions in Code Geass made any sense).

CodeGeass,2kkqds,eat_those_lemons,5,Tue Oct 28 15:24:13 2014 UTC,Much of Lelouch's ascendancy is based off of Nietzsche's will to power theory. The two most important philosophies in Code Geass to me anyways are Machiavelli's and Nietzche's.
CodeGeass,2kkqds,rmekdaschi,2,Fri Oct 31 11:56:43 2014 UTC,"I came in here to say that there are an absurd amount of Nietzschean traces in CG, from the Emperor's speech echoing some of Nietzsche's ideas about strong and weak in Beyond Good and Evil to of course the ubermensch in later Nietzschean thought"
CodeGeass,2kkqds,stichomythia,3,Fri Oct 31 20:55:03 2014 UTC,"Yes, but I think Lelouch signified the Übermensch more than his father, Nietzsche never advocates unnecessary cruelty which is what a lot of the emperor's actions and his servitors propagate. Being better than other human beings is a virtue in Nietzsche's eyes and in mine, but sadism is not. I think this is very important, because many people posit wrongly that Nietzsche advocated sadism."
CodeGeass,2kkqds,rmekdaschi,3,Fri Oct 31 22:48:45 2014 UTC,"The problem with Britannia is this quote: ""Some are born swifter of foot, some with greater beauty, some are born into poverty and others born sick and feeble.""

It is true that we all lie in one way or another. It isn't always bad though. And that description of god is pretty orginal.
CodeGeass,2k4ri3,Valiantttt,8,Thu Oct 23 23:03:49 2014 UTC,"I really like the whole idea of the mask and how each person has one, especially in the case of Lelouch where once the ball got rolling he kept lying no matter how much it hurt.

I'm not even religious but I thought it was so cool if it was intended but it might be coincidence."
CodeGeass,2k4ri3,Solid_Goat,2,Thu Oct 23 22:29:28 2014 UTC,"A lot of people actually believe that Lelouch represents Jesus. I don't want to sound all preachy, but the way each of them became despised, and gave their lives to save the world, even if nobody recognized them for it. It makes sense, and their are many examples from the show that support this idea."
CodeGeass,2k4ri3,Lelouchhh,4,Thu Oct 23 23:24:44 2014 UTC,"How would Lelouch represent Jesus, really ? They are totally diferent... Lelouch hated a lot of people, he also started everything because his hate towards Britannia and for Nunally's sake.  Meanwhile Jesus is a plain boring character, bringing ""salvation"" to humanity. That was his plan all along, unlike Lelouch who is a way more complex character, Jesus never developed because he was ""perfect"", he is god.   People despised Lelouch because he wanted to do that, to bring an end to the worst dictator the World has had. He just wanted everyone to hate him, so everyone could ""forget"". He was also loved by everyone as Zero.  Jesus wasn't despised as Lelouch was, he was only despised by Kings/noble mans and the old church, and later other people. Why ? He preached to everyone the he was god's son and the true king.  Lelouch is a byronic hero, you can go ahead and read about it."
CodeGeass,2k4ri3,AlcibiadesXI,1 point,Sun Oct 26 11:51:59 2014 UTC,"Obviously they are not gonna be completely perfect parallels to each other, but they do share similar traits. Yes Jesus being perfect makes him boring as he doesn't really develop, but I was talking more about the end result. And if I recall correctly, it says that everyone hated Jesus at the end, as they chose to free that one criminal instead of Jesus. It all says that the very people he cured, the ones he allowed to walk once more, were the very ones who turned on him and called for his death. Now we can get into debate about how how they are completely different because Lelouch turned against his father rather than doing his will, and how he differs from Christ in several aspects, but that's not the point I'm trying to get across. The idea is not that the life Lelouch led was synonymous to Jesus', it's that the death he endured was similar, as it was for the sake of mankind.  One of the best parts of this show, is that it's open to interpretation. That's why the ending is so ambiguous, it let's the audience decide for themselves how they want to interpret things, so in all honesty, take my words with a grain of salt :P"
CodeGeass,2k4ri3,stichomythia,1 point,Sun Oct 26 16:48:08 2014 UTC,"That Jesus comparison just hit me like a bulldozer, I really like it. There are a lot of things that are the same. Compare Tamaki and Petrus, they both had a big mouth in how they were the best friend of Jesus/Lelouch but in the end they denied him. I bet there are more examples but the main point is the ending of course.  Lelouchs goal has always been to make a safer and gentler place for his sister and the way he could do that was to destroy Britannia, so that wasn't really his goal but more the way to do it.  All he did came from his love towards Nunally and mankind.  Damn this I'm really not ready to move on yet, best anime i've ever watched!"

There are certain characters and themes that resonate with a society as a whole in art that has an epic (all-encompassing) scope. You could argue society needs these kind of self-sacrifice/messiah stories to restore internal stability, provide a direction in the face of the meaninglessness of a stratified, class-based society (which is what I think), or you could view it as simply pleasing because of how powerful it is to the inner conception of self importance and love.

A stagnant world where nothing ever changes. In that regard it is more a prison for mankind then it is a utopia."

CodeGeass,2juwsl,Gixxer_406,8,Tue Oct 21 04:20:15 2014 UTC,It has one of the best endings ever. Period. That is reason enough

CodeGeass,2juwsl,2dwn2care,9,Tue Oct 21 05:29:07 2014 UTC,"I actually loved this. I think it entertaining as hell whenever a likable character gets killed off. To me it just shows balls from the creators.  Btw a shit load of animes and mangas, even regular movies, have tragic events occur to keep the story going just as things are about to get resolved. I don't see why you're so surprised or have issues with this one. Euphie's tragedy is explained really well in this anime and I found it very plausible. Its not lame and caused by a characters stupidity or obviously controllable events that could have been easily avoided. But then again this is just my opinion and this is one of my favorite animes."
CodeGeass,2juwsl,2dwn2care,1 point,Tue Oct 21 04:53:36 2014 UTC,"Although she isn't dead (yet anyways), she's completely ruined. I tend to like twists given moderate circumstances (L from Death Note - It's been nearly 4 years since I've watched that scene but I'm pretty sure it was a plot twist....holy shit It's already been 4 years my how time is moving swiftly)   But your comments seem to confirm my suspicions. I suspect that many people actually enjoyed this scene. Shock value is an important aspect of animes like this, but I was left with more anger directed towards the writers than shock from the turn of events this time. I've watched my fair shair of twists, but I do not know why this one is giving me issues.   A big reason I wrote these posts is because I was hoping to understand why I felt this way if I could formalize it into text. I'm not sure if this anime is for me anymore, but I'm to reluctant to cast it off given the high amount of praise it gets."

CodeGeass,2juwsl,stichomythia,3,Thu Oct 23 03:49:54 2014 UTC,"I actually have a theory as to why this happened. Lelouch effectively ""lost"" to Euphimia. She was going to have the peace that she wanted, though because of the Nature of Brittania I think wouldn't work. Lelouch had to bow down to the court of public opinion, as well as his love for her.   Now let's for a moment assume that Geass can think for itself, or at least react reflexively. What is the purpose of Geass? To be used and to get stronger (ex. Geass Runaway). When Lelouch bowed down to Euphimia, he wouldn't need to use his Geass as much. That would be contrary to what the Geass wanted, so it forced Lelouch to have that ""slip of tongue"". And at that moment, it choose to go runaway so that Euphie's plan would be ruined.   There's also the theory that Lelouch choose to do it, and was only reacting the way he was because a) Euphie was in the room, and b) there may still be audio/video recordings. But I dont' buy that."
CodeGeass,2juwsl,Aatra,2,Sun Oct 26 18:22:36 2014 UTC,"Did Lelouch still ""love"" Euphemia then however? I always thought it was more of a childhood love that he had"

CodeGeass,2juwsl,eat_those_lemons,5,Wed Oct 29 17:39:25 2014 UTC,"I, too, hated that turn of events. I almost dropped it after episode 22 — and I was also borderline on episode 1, which I also didn't care for.  However, I forced myself to finish to the end of episode 25, and from there I found renewed motivation to continue. Code Geass became my favourite anime out of nearly 200, and I have now watched it from start to finish ten times.  Do not be too discouraged; there is reason to continue. It's not just people who liked that direction who enjoyed the series overall."
CodeGeass,2juwsl,eat_those_lemons,2,Tue Oct 21 12:12:10 2014 UTC,"Thanks. In my heart I was hoping for an answer like this. It might still be some time before I am ready to watch episode 23, but It's good to know that people who interpreted the first episodes similar to how I did still ended up enjoying the series as a whole."

CodeGeass,2jqbvt,GVSDSV,3,Sun Oct 19 22:40:38 2014 UTC,"Kallen through the show is shown as someone who had a fair understanding of Lelouch, and she is probably the one other than CC who understood Lelouch, his drive, reasons etc. (she new about Geass, tried to get Zero back, wanted to stay with Lelouch when the black nights turned on Lelouch and many other instances)  in the final battle when Suzaku and Kallen are talking Suzaku talks about how he and Lelouch have to do something. Then in the last episode Kallen questions who is in the Zero costume because ""Lelouch is over there"" (there being the car/float thing) and then Kallen wonders if ""this is what Suzaku and Lelouch had to do""  when Lelouch is killed it is asked if it really is Zero and Kallen says that ""It's Zero, its him"" She knows as show previously that it is really Suzaku in the Zero costume but when she says Zero she is talking about what Lelouch talked to Suzaku about. That the idea of Zero lives on in the heart of the people, which is to say that Zero is not a person but a set of ideals. so what Kallen realized is that Lelouch wanted to make everyone hate him and that it was ""Lelouch"" in the Zero costume, as in the ideals and world that Lelouch wanted were going to happen through Suzaku and the Geass he accepted from Lelouch  I hope that that made sense.  TL;DR: Kallen figured out the plan when Lelouch was killed by Suzaku. Kallen knew Lelouch well enough to piece together what happened."

CodeGeass,2ji8dr,Emolk,3,Fri Oct 17 10:45:59 2014 UTC,Good point. I still think the most obvious sight is that how Lelouch's memory flashed through Nunnally's eyes when she touched him.
CodeGeass,2ji8dr,samcuu,3,Sat Oct 18 01:56:34 2014 UTC,"Plus, we don't actually know what happens when someone gives up their Code.

Without Lelouch, she has no reason to keep on living, she would just desire death again, but in the last scene she seems happy with the way things turned out.  The close up shot of the paper thingo supports this as well. It symbolizes a wish coming true (explained by nunally), and her wish it to be loved (hence her Geass power), so by showing the close up of paper it shows that C2s wish to be loved has come true through her and Lelouch being together forever."

Now Geass is based off of the old Scottish/Irish myth of Geas/Geis (Scottish and Irish spelling respectively), which is both a curse and a gift given to someone (often a witch) which applies a taboo to one's life, ranging from a Geas that causes death if its owner eats dog meat to Macbeth's famous ""You shall not be killed by anyone born of a woman."" Essentially Lelouch is bestowing upon Suzaku a Geas of the classical sense. A great tie into the origin of Geass. For further readings, here is the Geas wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geis"

He served quite a few purposes.   1) C.C.'s backstory 2) Expanding the myth of Geass 3) Prepping people for all the Geass in season 2 4) Giving Lelouch an enemy on the same supernatural level as him in Season 1.  5) Bring Suzaku and  Lelouch together again in a non-formal way to do something, and further their plot."
CodeGeass,2htob5,ddk220,3,Tue Sep 30 14:03:12 2014 UTC,Yeah I felt like it showed that Lelouch wasn't the only one with this special power. Others were out there as well.

You always need to make a difference between a bad created character and a character you hate. I hate Nina, but that doesn't mean I want her to not be a part of Code Geass. I want her to be in it. But I wanted her to die. Same for Rolo. I was somewhat happy when he died after what he did to Shirley and almost Nunally, but that doesn't say they shouldve removed him from the Anime."

CodeGeass,2hd32o,Vathoska,3,Sat Sep 27 05:44:46 2014 UTC,"""Lelouche"" means ""The Bizarre"" in French. Louche is a word that has quite a few meanings (Soup ladle, squint, and weird), but the most commonly used one is colloquial and means weird, odd, queer, but in a creepy / perverted / sexual way. If you say ""C'est louche"", that can mean a ton of things, but it's almost always pejorative."

CodeGeass,2hd32o,mtmuelle,18,Mon Sep 29 00:08:34 2014 UTC,"It makes me sick this made it to one of the top tier examples for a persuasive essay.   First of all, it should be ""Vi Britannia, LeLouch"", not ""LeLouch, Vi Brittania"" (which is misspelled btw)  and second of all, Vi Britannia isn't part of his name, it's where he's from. So it should be ""Lamperouge, LeLouch""  You know the college system is surely failing when its students can't even spell the name of a country which controls 1/3rd of the world or correctly quote one of the most influential people in area 11."
CodeGeass,2hd32o,PhilosopherKingSigma,12,Thu Sep 25 16:29:54 2014 UTC,"Vi Britannia is his real last name, Britannia being the royal family name and the Vi dictating which consort he was born from.  Lamperouge is the one he took when he got to Japan."

Here comes the 2nd point, character development. as you watch lelouch win you also understand him and want him to win, when he looses it's like you have lost. The character development also goes on with more then just lelouch, it goes to Shirley, it goes to the connection between two step siblings, the characters development can go so far when it comes to telling a story. (sorry for Grammer, this is a hard thought to put into words let alone with it being midnight for me)"
CodeGeass,2hafuw,redkiller4all,4,Wed Sep 24 05:28:08 2014 UTC,"This whole thing is filled with spoilers so read at your own risk.  I believe that part if the reason the show is so good is that there is no clear ""bad guy"" but instead there are many diffrent people all trying to make the world a better place. The conflicts come from the characters disagreeing on how to go about makeing the world better instead of some asinine ""oh they are evil and trying to kill everyone so we need to stop them because we are the good guys"" plot. The fact that there is no clear cut bad guy (though there still is a protagonist and antagonist) makes the stroy much better since you can really understand the motives of both sides.  Also the pacing of the show is spectacular, that is there is never a moment where you are watching and wishing that they would just get this part over with. Each moment in the show last just long enough for the importance if whatever has just happned to really sink in. Also there is almost never a moment while watching where you are not wondering what is going to happen next. The writers keep you at the edge of you seat and when they do make a reveal it never disapoints. Whether that reveal is super badass like when Lelouch is executing the steps of his plan or just plain shocking like with Euphy's death. Every moment of the show makes you want to keep watching."
CodeGeass,2hafuw,Ral_Zarek,10,Wed Sep 24 20:01:27 2014 UTC,For me it was because every week you never knew what was going to happen next. There wasn't a Manga that you could just read ahead and see what w I would happen. Every week there was something unexpected that would happen.

Some people dont like the school stuff but personally, theyre some of my favorite parts. If it had been all black knights all the time, it would have been quite depressing really. The comedy parts really helped in adding in some light hearted elements to give you a break from all the tragedy going around.   i think its one of the reasons i think code geass is superior to death note. (since they're compared often) and why L is so immensely popular. He provided some much needed comic relief in that show.

He didn't have L's boldness, and preferred to stay back and figure things out himself rather than go out and test them, but his skill and attention to detail are undeniable.   He only received two pieces of information that weren't found by his own skill.   That a rule was fake. That the real notebook was hidden.   And both of these, he admits, were found by Mello.

It's pretty interesting, with some new Knightmare combat, but it's not quite up to par with the anime. It's also only got two parts done out of four, so it'll take a while to finish.  As far as OVAs related to the main series, I think there's one called Nunnally in Wonderland, which is just an audio with some drawings. I haven't seen that myself, though.  According to Wikipedia, there are a number of manga related to the series. However, these came after, and it seems as though the anime was an original idea. I've got no idea what the manga are about, they could just reiterate the series. Also, there's some light novels, if you like those."

From the all-knowing Yahoo Answers:   Akito the Exiled hasn't even been licensed, and it can't be dubbed until it is. [...]  It's impossible to even estimate how many years it'll take unless it's licensed. If/when it is licensed, whenever that happens, it'll be a good 1-2 years from that time until it's dubbed, at least.

CodeGeass,2gjj1q,rikeus,4,Tue Sep 16 08:09:09 2014 UTC,"Ok, here's my take on it:  Let's start with the definition of authority  The first meaning is:  ""The power to determine, adjudicate, or otherwise settle issues; the right to control, command, or determine.""  - basically the power given to government officials as in:  ""The Emperor has the authority to make the law.""  I believe the ""other meaning"" that Schneizel was referring to is the eighth meaning: ""Persuasive force; conviction.""  as in ""He spoke with authority.""  In the context of the dialogue we see that:    When he said: ""Above all the Emperor of Brittania must play his part.""  - He was referring to the emperors' authority as a top government official. (meaning #1 of authority)   After being questioned as to how he would become ""The Grand Authority"", Schneizel said: ""Did you know that authority has another meaning?"" - I believe that what he is getting at here is this meaning: ""Persuasive force; conviction."" - Something that everyone has in varying degrees.  This serves as a subtle foreshadowing of the Damocles;  showing that, rather than trying to use normal government power (arbitrary legal power), he is instead building a machine that commands so much respect (speaks with so much authority) that people will have no choice but to follow it.   TLDR: ""Emperors are given authority, FLEIJAs speak with authority.""  In contrast Lelouch would rather command disrespect than respect, thereby becoming the common enemy of the world, bringing everyone to one side."
CodeGeass,2gjj1q,SpockNorris,2,Tue Sep 16 22:00:57 2014 UTC,"The full quote would help...  This page has an unofficial transcript of that episode. The relevant segment is:   Schneizel: The true nature of people is this. They want to be controlled by their nation, their religion, their traditions, and by figures of grand authority. Above all, the emperor of Britannia must play his part.  Gino: So now you're the one to play that part, Your Highness? The grand authority?  Schneizel: If I'm called upon to do it, then perhaps...  Cornelia: Perhaps... How so?  Schneizel: Did know that the word authority actually has another meaning?   (I don't have the episode on-hand, so I can't guarantee whether that quote is accurate. But it sounds familiar.)  I have no idea what was meant by that. Code Geass likes to do that a lot: a character ends with a mysterious quote and doesn't finish a thought, and then it switches over to the next scene. Sometimes it works, and I get why they do it ... but many times I found it sloppy and confusing; this is a good example of that."

My interpretation:  Lelouch wanted Nunnally to be safe - he stated that ""nothing of this has to do with my sister"" (or something) before getting his face crushed. By taking the blame (more than necessary) Lelouch was effectively pleading for Nunnally's life - pleading for Suzaku to protect Nunnally from the Emperor because naturally she had nothing to do with his activity as Zero (and so he was trying to direct as much blame towards himself as possible).  Anyone have any thoughts on this?"

CodeGeass,2gfz9p,sumitviii,5,Wed Oct 15 14:32:16 2014 UTC,While everyone is entitled to their opinion I am pretty much convinced that Lelouch is dead:see this source.  I 100% agree with the OP on the final episode aftermath being waaay too short. There is a picture drama R2 25.01 which shows the Ashford students at Ashford Academy after being rebuilt. There you get a glimpse of life and I guess it shows that everyone is happy. Still not enough IMO but it is well worth checking out!
CodeGeass,2gfz9p,Teh2ndrunner,2,Mon Sep 15 18:13:42 2014 UTC,"I personally do not care whether he actually is alive or not. I do agree that aftermath was way too short. It was like a minute? Maybe 2? On the other had, most of the story has been completed by that point so i see why they did it this way.  And I really like the way they ended the series (as I said, it doesn't really matter whether he's or isn't alive). The fact that even though he succeeded with his plan, there are people who know what he did and appreciate it, mattered to me. I would be happy if he was actually alive (and in the Jap. version it really looks like it), but on the other hand, he didn't really deserve it after all the horrible thing he did."

CodeGeass,2gfz9p,dmquery,2,Mon Sep 15 12:44:47 2014 UTC,"Kururugi wanted to trade his life to atone for killing his father.

CodeGeass,2gfz9p,dynokid11,1 point,Mon Sep 15 14:19:45 2014 UTC,The argumentsssss in that vid is actually great. And i did feel a little better because as one pointed out: the end is open for interpretation. Personally I would like to believe that he is alive because then C.C.'s happiness would have made a lot more sense (and hence making me satisfied as well). I guess the real next step is season 3 or even just an OVA on the couple. Then my life would be complete.

Well, most likely it does anyway, but the writers ended it there for a reason. Not that the story is over. Not in the least. It's most likely that they feel that Lelouch's story is done.

The English dub's protagonist has the same voice actor as Lelouch, and the protagonist's best friend has the same voice actor as Suzaku, so you'll be in familiar hands.  It's has a bit more comic relief in it, but it's just as mature and has a murder mystery as an overarching plot. The final couple of episodes do seem a bit rushed, but overall it's very enjoyable.  It has 25 episodes and an extra episode ""True End"" which goes beyond episode 25's ending and is 100% canon.  I hope you check it out :)"

I'm having trouble understanding, did you mean it the other way around? Schneizel never properly ousted Lelouch. If Charles had been a nice guy there probably wouldn't have been any ""survivial of the fittest"" Social Darwinism bullshit, so the Elevens would probably not have been treated like such shit.

I do think that he intended to liberate the territories that Britannia controlled, and possibly dissolve Britannia itself. That was one of his stated goals early on, that he would destroy it. However, obviously things get in the way and he can't do that, so he adapts his plan.  So I think ideally, he would have dissolved Britannia, liberated Japan, and gone back to Japan to launch fireworks with his friends at Ashford. Then everything goes to shit and he can't."

I read that the production was forced to make  an R2 with hints of what happened on R1 for people who hadn't watch the R1 (that is consistent with ""they had to use up two slots for recaps"").  I also read that R2 was planned to tell a lot of the backstory of the Geass, how it all started, etc.  I guess this also may link (in case it's true) to the link you posted. Anyway, for me this is the usual story nowadays; owners of the company decide to fuck up some film/anime/series/videogame because they can get a few more bucks.  P.D.: Clarify, it's not that I don't like CG, it's my favourite show ever.

I read somewhere in the past that the creator had planned to do a lot more with Kallen's character (for example) which included introducing her dad and potentially a plot twist with her brother (the number of times he was mentioned in the first 9 or so episodes of season 1 was begging for some kind of attention).

If you're interested, here's the real explanation for Rolo's creation:  http://code-geass.livejournal.com/1376181.html  Kallen's brother was already dead though, so I don't think it was likely he'd show up. Yes, she mentions him several times, as part of her motivation for becoming a resistance fighter, but not as someone who is still alive or plays an active role in the story anymore. Her dad is only ever brought up indirectly and a lot less, so that's even more debatable."
CodeGeass,2f5wnj,souther1983,1 point,Sat Sep 13 14:59:26 2014 UTC,"My reasoning comes from this source - I draw your attention to post 92, specifically this quote:  ""in the audio commentary for episode 4, Kawaguchi lets slip that Kallen ""thinks"" her brother is dead. When Koshimizu (Kallen's VA) pressed him for more info, Kawaguchi said that while he cannot say whether Naoto is dead or alive, it is fact that Kallen & co. ""thinks"" he is dead. Around the same time, Asuka's description for Naoto was changed to ""MIA"", instead of the more final ""Dead"".""  I've watched episode 4 again with the audio commentary on and I can verify that this is accurate. Also, we are given so little insight into the circumstances surrounding his death i.e. was anyone there to witness? etc etc. In any show I don't usually take things at face value (obviously the writers have sweet plot twists in mind) so I did not think, at the time of viewing, that Naoto was definitely dead simply because we were told that he died.  Thanks for the link on Rolo!"
CodeGeass,2f5wnj,Zayus,1 point,Sun Sep 14 19:54:52 2014 UTC,"The problem is that people usually jump to conclusions, beyond what the creator himself (in this case, the director) is saying, and ignoring the parts of his interviews where he is talking about something else.   I think it's a big mistake to assume that because something wasn't explained in R2 then it would have been originally focused on. Perhaps so, perhaps not. But especially not when in another interview the staff (in this case, the writer) say they didn't plan to explain everything in the first place.  There's no indication anywhere that the origins of Geass would become relevant to the centrals events of the story, which is more about Lelouch's personal tale than about finding out every single detail of background story behind the universe.  In practice, certain details were changed and that's unfortunate, but the basics of the story were still the same, despite the time slot change, and both of the creators have mentioned time and time again that the ending  reflects what they wanted to do."

I liked seeing a lot of Sutherlands or an outdated Glasgow just because they felt very practical as far as mechs go. Whereas a lot of the mechs in the show (most shows for that matter) where huge and shooty and high-tech, the basic mechs felt like something that you could see infantry piloting in the not-so-far future."

CodeGeass,2efw8l,Aurabolt,2,Sun Aug 24 17:34:56 2014 UTC,"Would that really have been his plan from the outset though? I was under the impression that the Zero Requiem was something that he came up with pretty late into the series. What 17 year old would want to martyr himself, for any reason? Lelouch's motivation was always a peaceful world for Nunnally, but if he couldn't spend it with her I don't see the point. I think he eventually just decided that that was the only way to create a peaceful world, not that it was his idea from the outset.  If I'm wrong though, I'd love to hear it, I just realized I've never really thought of Lelouch's end goals at various points in the series."

After the Black Knights betrayed him, he went to confront his father, with a ""nothing left to lose"" mentality -- as if to say, ""If I'm going down, I'm taking him with me."" Hence Lelouch destroying the door to the other world. I bet it was shortly after killing his parents (or around that time, at least -- maybe it was on his way over...) that he came up with the plan."

I fully believe Lelouch survived because of that theory.  For fellow nerds: Regarding C.C. addressing Lelouch at the end he had to be alive or she was simply talking to herself (why ask a question out loud then?) because it was Marianne's Geass that allowed C.C. to communicate with her.  Also why would Orange allow Lelouch to just die like that given his vows and his reaction to the realization of who Lelouch actually was - he must have known something about it, especially after the whole guilt over Marianne's death thing.  Officially though Lelouch will always be marked as dead because obviously mark him as alive and shit will happen, right?"

CodeGeass,2dv1n9,goldiefoxx22,4,Mon Aug 18 05:35:05 2014 UTC,"If you like Knightmare Frame combat, you should definitely watch Akito. I don't think it holds up to the main series, but it definitely has its own perks, namely the new animation they used for the Knightmares. It seems odd at first, but you get used to it. It's just different. The story is good, in a weird way. It elaborates a lot on the European Union and it's relationship with Britannia, as well as the status of the Elevens in Europe. Since you said you wanted more content, I would say it's worth watching.  There are a couple issues, like some outrageously stupid decision making by some of the characters, but it doesn't ruin it or anything.  As far as Lelouch, as of now no one knows exactly who the look-alike is, but just keep in mind that Akito takes place in between R1 and R2, which throws a lot of people off. They set up an interesting cliffhanger at the end of Part 2, and I'm looking forward to where they'll go with the next installment."
CodeGeass,2dv1n9,Edwardaido,1 point,Mon Aug 18 07:34:02 2014 UTC,I'll never get used to the new combat. It's so boring compared to Code Geass. I liked how they used unique angles and constant jumps to give you the feeling of the combat. It was unique.
CodeGeass,2dv1n9,Aatra,2,Tue Aug 19 04:33:05 2014 UTC,"That's true, yeah, the action scenes in the original series did feel a lot more inspired and artistic, since it wasn't usually feasible to animate every action. I liked that better, but I still think the new combat is cool for different reasons."
CodeGeass,2dv1n9,Edwardaido,4,Tue Aug 19 08:24:28 2014 UTC,"It's different. It doesn't have Code Geass' atmosphere or speed. Don't go into it expecting R3.   But that being said, it's fabulous and worth the watch.   1) It explores the EU. This was the most alluring thing to me. Other than the Chinese Federation (which was only explored briefly), Britannia is the main focus of R1 and R2. It's nice to be clearly in the same world, but a different setting.   2) The themes. The central themes of R1 and R2 are still present and very strong in Akito. Class warfare, modes of idealism, political corruption, and power are all central to the plot.   3) The old and the new. There are plenty of cues from R1 and R2, and by the end of OVA 2 there are even some familiar faces. But it mostly centers on a conflict and a set of characters completely unexplored by R1 and R2.   4) Kickass female protagonist. I'm sorry, but Anime (Code Geass included) has a habit of treating women horribly. It's refreshing for our badass protagonist (who doens't seem to be Akito despite his being in the name) is female.   THere are some other factors that are not exactly ""good"" or ""bad"", but a matter of preference. The pacing of the show is slow (especially OVA1). I like the buildup, and hope that there will be a good payoff.  Another thing is the animation. The combat sequences are totally different than R1 and R2. They're more fluid and are shown in a more start to finish way than the choppyness of those that came before. I don't like this change, and will take Kallen in the glasgow vs. Jerimiah in his sutherland over Akito's badass Alexander any day.  It's also only in sub so far, and as someone who perfers the Geass dub over it's counterpart, I hate that. Lelouch's voice in English is music to my ears.  The tone is VERY VERY VERY different. It's subdued, almost hidden behind a calm exterior. It feels sometimes like you're reading a novel, not watching an anime. THere's a melancholy to it. I enjoy it, but still prefer the tone of the original show.  The characters are not yet fleshed out. Like I mentioned, it's mainly buildup at this point. We only have snippets of Akito's backstory, and very little on anyone else (including the actual main character).   Overall, it's different. But not bad, not at all. OVA2 has more livelyness to it, but OVA1 has it's merits as well."

CodeGeass,2dv1n9,BigBoss424,2,Wed Aug 20 18:58:08 2014 UTC,It's an interesting take on the series focusing more on Knightmare Frame combat and squad tactics rather than the grand scale of combat seen in the main series. Plus seeing how the EU takes on the Britannian Empire is a pretty cool thing to see regardless.
CodeGeass,2dv1n9,SaiphCharon,1 point,Thu Aug 21 11:24:47 2014 UTC,"Currently there is only 2 of the 4 episodes, with the third one being delayed way too much already, so it's not worth convincing you for now, as you'll just be left with unanswered questions...  I loved the 2 eps so far and can't wait for the other 2 though. It certainly doesn't feel like some unrelated ""low-quality"" side project for the sake of it or something.

His choice to wait until the last moment to unleash the Shinkiro (so that he could get Shin Xi on his side) was brilliant. His flair for the dramatic was shown to be very practical in that moment.   His larger plan to unravel the Chinese Federation was beautiful as well.   His destruction at Narita was great.   And also the small ways he'd use his geass. When he got the suit made, when he got the sniper to attack him when he returned to power in R2, things like that just made me smile."

CodeGeass,2dku1v,eat_those_lemons,22,Thu Aug 14 21:35:25 2014 UTC,I find most U.S TV to be predictable and unoriginal but I do sometimes find a good show.
CodeGeass,2dku1v,indiefolkfan,11,Thu Aug 14 22:08:35 2014 UTC,You're just not watching the right shows. There are tons of good storylines in American TV. Breaking Bad in particular.
CodeGeass,2dku1v,OtakuMecha,0,Thu Aug 14 22:50:59 2014 UTC,"Yeah, Breaking Bad is awesome. As i said i can sometimes find good shows but its rare."
CodeGeass,2dku1v,indiefolkfan,9,Fri Aug 15 02:50:31 2014 UTC,Good anime is rare as well. Good anything is.
CodeGeass,2dku1v,BiPolarBareCSS,1 point,Fri Aug 15 10:13:17 2014 UTC,"Yes, but good anime is easier to find becuse of large fandoms"
CodeGeass,2dku1v,Jawado116,7,Wed Oct 8 17:15:35 2014 UTC,"Yes, but for a different reason.  Most Animes are very short, the ones I watch range from 13 to 50 episodes.  It's not a huge commitment or hassle to sit through a series.  However, American TV's goal seems to be to make it as long as possible.  Even shows that have stories have too many seasons.  I'd prefer it if watching a show wasn't a commitment, so I'd rather watch Anime.  Also, yeah, Anime plots (actual meaning of the word) are much better and make you think a bit more."
CodeGeass,2dku1v,ljsauk,3,Thu Aug 14 22:59:23 2014 UTC,I find the stories in anime to be much more interesting so i don't watch as much TV as i used to do but occasionally a good show like breaking bad can catch my attention :)
CodeGeass,2dku1v,EL_Horse1,2,Thu Aug 14 22:28:15 2014 UTC,"I haven't had cable or watched any new TV in three years. I started getting tired of a lot of anime years ago (Dragon Ball Z, Inuyasha, Bleach...), but to this day two of my favorite shows (not just anime, but shows in general) are Code Geass and Death Note. However, the more I go back and rewatch them (I've watched Code Geass at least 3 or 4 times and Death Note twice), the less I find myself liking them.  While I find certain aspects of both shows very engaging, there are many aspects that aggravate me. For example...  1) Clumsy plot points. While I enjoy the overall story arc of Code Geass, certain plot points (like the whole Sword of Akasha story) felt poorly thought out, rushed, and out of place.  2) Anime cliches. Lelouch himself barely ever engages in anime cliches, but there's a lot of generic, cringe-y dialogue from the other characters in Code Geass -- typically from the supporting characters, but even from some of the main characters (say, Suzaku). Which brings me to...  3) One-dimensional characters. Again, Lelouch is a very well-developed character, but I find almost all of the other characters pretty forgettable. Even Suzaku, for example. After the first few episodes, we pretty much know what Suzaku's role is. Pretty predictable and generic. I just didn't find any real depth to the character.  Overall, I just find myself wanting more substance. Maybe I need to start venturing more into books and literature."
CodeGeass,2dku1v,dc880610,1 point,Fri Aug 15 00:35:49 2014 UTC,"I really loved Code Geass when I watched it and want to re-watch, but I just know I'm not going to like it nearly as much as I did then (for several reasons like you mentioned) and it would stop being one of my top 5 shows. But that's not just the fault of the show, which still has a ton of merit and enjoyability, more the fact that the biggest source of enjoyment for watching Code Geass is not knowing what comes next and being dropped with painful shockers and crazy twists."
CodeGeass,2dku1v,megacookie,1 point,Fri Aug 15 03:20:12 2014 UTC,"Honestly, that's probably a fairly big part of it: half the fun was the mere fact that it was the first time. But I also eventually came to realize that even though Code Geass is (IMO) a fantastic show, there were a lot of flaws that I let slide ... and those flaws started to bug me more and more, the more that I watched it."
CodeGeass,2dku1v,dc880610,1 point,Fri Aug 15 03:29:28 2014 UTC,"to the whole part about re-watching code geass, is that different from any other show? It seems like most shows when watched again will be not as good as the original time you watched it."
CodeGeass,2dku1v,Zeoras,1 point,Sat Aug 16 15:01:29 2014 UTC,what anime cliches were there?
CodeGeass,2dku1v,7TeenWriters,2,Sat Aug 16 14:59:58 2014 UTC,"The medium with which theme and plot is conveyed is markedly different between the two but that doesn't mean that certain templates for plot and theme are exclusive to an anime or to an American television show or any other piece of media.  The idea that the stereotypical ""Good Wins"" story is more American than Japanese is false. There's plenty of anime that could be viewed in the same light that OP saw those American shows and movies, Dragon Ball Z for example, with what resurrection being commonplace to the good guys, loss isn't permanent, doesn't make it not a loss, but it's still not as bad it could be.   What is a subjective truth is that humanity tends to favor more ""optimistic"" stories, wish fulfillment if you will. That's not a notion exclusive to any nation. It's just that American media gets a significant amount of flak for it because of the sheer amount of media us Americans put out.  The ""episodic"" exclusivity that's heavily apparent in American shows is something I believe is rooted to the idea that in the world of today, people don't want to have to commit to watching a show from the beginning in order to enjoy the show, the mentality that shows can be ""convenient"" to a viewer is both beneficial and detrimental.  For example a series such as True Detective or Game of Thrones cannot be simply picked up mid-season, inconvenient for those who for whatever reason are ""late"". But in that vein, those series have more ""continuity"" not that more ""episodic"" shows necessarily exclude themselves from having plotlines, it's just that something like CSI or Law and Order won't have the same idea of a ""storyline"" like a show such as Game of Thrones  On the other hand, shows like the aforementioned CSI or Law and Order mean that you could show up essentially whenever during the season and pick up on the ongoings of the show. It gets the job done.   A ""healthy"" consumer and viewer of such media would see to it that they watch both, because forcing yourself to stick to one kind of media is restrictive, and consumer freedom rocks."
CodeGeass,2dku1v,Parenegade,1 point,Thu Aug 14 23:00:07 2014 UTC,from most of the movies (big blockbusters or or teen shows) that I have watched here in america though include that happy ending which after watching some anime actually causes some disgust.
CodeGeass,2dku1v,HWBrook,2,Sat Aug 16 15:04:04 2014 UTC,"I would say that there is a lot of anime that i dislike for similar reasons. I tend to like shows regardless of genre on the basis of having good characters, and interesting plot, and generally not going into too many overused tropes. While there are more than a few anime that I enjoy, the same can be said for American television. Take Firefly for example (or basically anything written by Joss Whedon). You just have to know where to look. If you want I can provide you with a list of shows (both live action and Anime) that I think fit what you're looking for."

But most modern stuff today in American TV consists of one or two good seasons and the rest being shit. Take for example Heroes and The 4400. The lack of creativity after two seasons is ridiculous. But anime on the other hand gives me the satisfaction of people actually dying. Granted some animes take death way to liberally (coughs Dragonball Z and Naruto).

The entirety idea of the weapon didn't make a lot of sense imo, almost like a very hastily written idea. I think poor writing was involved in developing the idea of that place and explaining it. Also explaining how destroying a god (the infinite source of power that fueled EVERYTHING) wasn't going to destroy the universe entirely."
CodeGeass,2digwl,TheGogoy,3,Thu Aug 14 10:22:15 2014 UTC,"So as I interpreted it the 'God' in code geass wasn't meant to be a 'created / controls the universe' type thing; it's more of a collection of all human consciousness. Hence its susceptibility to lelouch's geass. As for the gears, I have no idea. Might be some symbolism that I don't understand, or it might just be there because it's a cool looking way to represent the system Charles built. The masks, I think, represent the different personas people take on in life. Charles thought that destroying these personas would bring about a peaceful world, but Lelouch disagreed. That's how I interpreted it at least."
CodeGeass,2digwl,Thorium-229,1 point,Thu Aug 14 14:51:53 2014 UTC,"Well he didn't disagree to that point directly, he thought it would render people soulless and lifeless if they didn't have a life to care about. By making everyone eternal, all human aspects of caring for life would be lost. Heaven on earth doesn't work with our current capacity as humans."
CodeGeass,2digwl,TheGogoy,1 point,Thu Aug 14 16:31:44 2014 UTC,"Lelouch did say that lies had purpose. That people lie because they desire things, and that lying for that reason isn't an inherently bad thing.  I'm not exactly sure that they were trying to create heaven on earth, I thought the idea was to have everyone become a part of one collective consciousness. I really don't know, they're so damn ambigous about the whole thing. I would guess it made more sense in the original Japanese."
CodeGeass,2digwl,Thorium-229,1 point,Thu Aug 14 18:07:47 2014 UTC,It didn't make any sense to me and gave me a headache. lol.
CodeGeass,2digwl,TheGogoy,1 point,Thu Aug 14 20:40:11 2014 UTC,"I presume that the gears are part of what Charles called ""Thought elevator"".Lelouch himself told us about the masks.  He also remarked that when they were dissolving that it was ""Reality's response""."
CodeGeass,2digwl,JealotGaming,1 point,Thu Aug 14 16:29:21 2014 UTC,"The masks were already explained so keep that in mind as you think of the gears. If the masks were destroyed the gears would stop and so would human progress and you could only live from memories already made. (Lelouch was for the future, Charles was for the past). Also Charles and Marianne Dissolved because Lelouch commanded god (basically, God was just a shit ton of minds collected in one place, best way to describe it is how the bad guy died in the first ghost rider, Lelouch used his geass all those minds combined.)"

CodeGeass,2diorh,eat_those_lemons,9,Thu Aug 14 07:21:41 2014 UTC,"I don't understand why you would want to show people this show but not the whole show. It isn't the same if you actually just skip parts of the series. It isn't even that long, just watch it over an extended period of time. And how can you 'make it more family friendly?' Honestly it just won't be the same show if you need to change it that much. It sounds like CG just isn't the show for the people you want to show it to."
CodeGeass,2diorh,LiamSkylar,2,Thu Aug 14 18:20:11 2014 UTC,the reason for making it shorter is to get them to watch it even a little bit they say that they don't have enough time to watch it but if it was 4-5 hours instead of 18-20 the most likely they would watch it then. and if I can get them hooked on a shorter version then the might watch the whole thing.
CodeGeass,2diorh,gammarik,2,Sat Aug 16 15:21:23 2014 UTC,"There are two special edition movies that retell the series in 4 hours, but I think they're made for rewatching, as they spoil the endings of each season in the beginning of the films :P"
CodeGeass,2diorh,heidurzo,3,Thu Aug 14 08:34:40 2014 UTC,"I don't think it's possible to watch both R1 and R2.  All in, with not even the OPs/EDs skipped, CG is 20 hours long. Estimating OP and ED are 3 mins long total that's 17.5 hours if you skip them.  If you just watch R1, which is pretty inclusive in itself, you're looking at 8.75 hours. If you trawl through you can probably find enough flashbacks, reminders, the island of the gods, gratuitious nudity and purely wasted scenes to bring it down to around 7 hours but that's about it."
CodeGeass,2diorh,SpockNorris,0,Thu Aug 14 17:42:19 2014 UTC,for my family to watch it (probably just my parents and a few of my older siblings) I would need to take out the gratuitious nudity scenes but don't really want to watch all 20 hours just to find them although I might have to.  the unfortunate thing though about only watching R1 is that it doesn't have the great ending of R2 which is a big part of why I want them to watch it.  but it seems like there is more of R2 that could be cut out.  I wonder how much exposition I could just insert like in episode 4 (3?) with the whole collin thing I could just cut that out or just replace it with some text to explain it.
CodeGeass,2diorh,kaidynamite,1 point,Thu Aug 14 18:24:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah Code Geass isn't the most family friendly show.  Are your friends and family already into anime or something?  Because if they are new it would probably be better to show them a short movie like The Garden of Words (Very family friendly, has a good dub) or a short series like Baccano! (Be aware that Baccano it is not family friendly, but has a great dub.)  Your best option might be to wait until Zankyou no Terror finishes airing,  because it is more similar to Code Geass and will only be 11 episodes long.  Then once they are interested in anime you can figure out how to show them Code Geass.  Because if your family isn't already into anime, then just showing them Code Geass is a bad idea!"

CodeGeass,2d7d3n,Zamkyem,8,Mon Aug 11 04:18:16 2014 UTC,"No. It's highly unlikely that everyone in the entire world will be able to place a large amount of blame and hatred on one person. For example, if Code Geass was real people would start going after former Britannian leaders and generals (Cornelia, Gilbert GP Guilford, Nanaly, Suzaku, Gino, Anya, Odysseus, the other princes and princesses, etc), the Britannian military, and the Britannian citizens. Some people like Cornelia, Guilford, and Suzaku might sacrifice themselves for the sake of the world like Lelouch did but the rest would fight for their lives. Since the F.L.E.I.J.A.s are now mass-produced, there would most likely be either a cold war or a nuclear (F.L.E.I.J.A.) war."
CodeGeass,2d7d3n,Shafalabaz,4,Sun Aug 17 03:18:17 2014 UTC,It has kinda worked to a smaller degree with Hitler and atomic bombs. But for it to completely work we would need someone who is absolutely hated by everyone (Even more so then Hitler).
CodeGeass,2d7d3n,shelcod,9,Sat Aug 16 01:40:49 2014 UTC,"Nope. Instead of Schneizel ruling the world from above, we have a balance of power decided by nuclear weapons. Without nuclear weapons, the world would be much more imperialistic and violent than it is today."
CodeGeass,2d7d3n,Silvadream,24,Mon Aug 11 04:58:27 2014 UTC,"So we've already inherited Schneizel's world. A perpetual ""Now"", balanced on the edge of a knife, masquerading as peace."
CodeGeass,2d7d3n,DeplorableVillainy,9,Mon Aug 11 06:32:38 2014 UTC,Its getting closer to how it is in the start of Mobile Suit Gundam 00. Spheres of influence and military-industrial complexes are as large as ever.
CodeGeass,2d7d3n,LiamSkylar,3,Mon Aug 11 09:39:05 2014 UTC,"Realistically, very doubtful. As someone else said, since everyone has nuclear weapons, no one can act like Lelouch did and attempt a total world dictatorship. It is like if everyone had FLEIJAs instead of just Schniezel. The only way it could happen is if someone had a bigger threat that somehow no one else had."
CodeGeass,2d7d3n,redkiller4all,2,Mon Aug 11 19:36:35 2014 UTC,"I think that at this moment it couldn't, but, in the future, eventually someone will create something to alter the balance. Mech technology seems to be moving forward, and full body suits that protect you from getting hit by moving vehicles have already been created. Its only a matter of time before these are perfected."
CodeGeass,2d7d3n,DeplorableVillainy,5,Mon Aug 11 19:40:16 2014 UTC,"Ya, but none of that will matter as long as nukes are still available. Someone would have to invent something that can effectively stop nukes."

CodeGeass,2d7d3n,eat_those_lemons,2,Mon Aug 11 23:24:22 2014 UTC,"Ya, but the only real way is to get something that can stop them from exploding. Even if a country makes something that is 10x as powerful as a nuke, It wont change anything besides who has more power because if they send that one warhead, everyone else will send a nuke and still do a shit ton of damage to the world and the country who first attacked."
CodeGeass,2d7d3n,DeplorableVillainy,3,Mon Aug 11 23:40:08 2014 UTC,"You know how Schneizel was the present, Charles wanted the past, and Lelouch wanted the future, I think we need to look at what would result from their ambitions.  I think Charles had a permanent solution, Schneizel had a mid length solution (like the cold war between Russia and the U.S.) and Lelouch has the most temporary solution, because his reasoning is so flimsy (as evidenced by what everyone is saying in this thread).    What do you guys think, based on this, who actually had the best solution after all?"
CodeGeass,2d7d3n,KayanRider,5,Tue Aug 12 03:42:53 2014 UTC,"I agree with you there, but Charles solution isn't really living is it? Everyone welded into a single collective conscience. We would completely understand each other and therefore have no conflict. War is the mother of invention. What would people strive for? What would their goals be? What would give them purpose? The people in code geass has a reason to live. To fight, to create, to survive. They had hope that they could find their happiness. Conflict creates sadness and without sadness, how could happiness come to be?"
CodeGeass,2d7d3n,JealotGaming,3,Tue Aug 12 05:06:41 2014 UTC,I would say that those are good examples of real life in the fact that if you have something that is completely stagnant or rooted in the past and will not move then it is a long term solution but it will be terrible. and then there is Schneizel's plan which was semi permanent but would not really allow that much change. Lelouchs is the shortest but could turn out for the best. Like Lelouch said he didn't want to stop the wheels of time. ie he didn't want to stop human striving which would continue to bring a better life for people both Charles and Schneizel's plan was to stop that possibility. TL;DR the more stable something is the less it can change so it will stick where it is
CodeGeass,2d7d3n,willit1016,3,Thu Aug 14 18:19:00 2014 UTC,"Lelouch's solution had the least control on the world specifically because he trusted human nature, and believed there was good in people.   All he really did was free people from the divides that exist in society. No classes, no national boundaries, no old hatreds.  To do this, he had to breed the discrimination out of people in the harshest way possible. To drag the entire world, face-first and screaming, through the mud until they had no choice but to hate him. I don't think we ever really saw the cruelty or the heartlessness of ""Emperor Lelouch"" But what he had to do required great measures of both.   I think his solution was beautiful because despite the depravity and sin it took to get there, he reminded the world that we are all human beings, just trying to live."
CodeGeass,2d7d3n,redkiller4all,2,Thu Aug 14 22:35:09 2014 UTC,"Never! But we need to think about the several mounths that Lelouch went off the grid, he could be throwing geass around like a maniac all that time, and thus setting it up so everyone would, like Schneizel, follow Zero, thus makeing Zero a diktator in everything but name. And if Zero could uphold the peace long enough, and remove enough corruption, and get nations to bond. Then yes the peace would last, not because of the Zero Reqiuem but because of the next generation and MASS GEASS."

CodeGeass,2cpeip,GhostofSora,1 point,Wed Aug 6 23:28:14 2014 UTC,I was debating this point while writing the post. You just reminded me why no other character can be worse.
CodeGeass,2cpeip,GreenHairedSnorlax,19,Wed Aug 6 00:32:25 2014 UTC,"To start off with, Nina was probably a very weak person. She is not the traditional racist, who has a feeling of superiority over people of different ethnicity, instead she has a deep root fear of them which stems from her once visiting the ghettos were she may have been raped, physically abused etc.  The reason she put so much faith in Euphemia was because she couldn't put it in herself. Combined with the fact that Euphemia helped her out in this traumatic situation (with Elevens) when no-one else did, and she had to face another traumatic situation beforehand (again, with Elevens) and no-one helped her.  In my opinion Nina wasn't a bad character, she was designed to be hated, and she did that, but she wasn't a bad person. As with most Code Geass characters, Nina does not fall into the camps of good and evil but instead drifted around the middle ground. She believed that building the FLEIJA and it's prototype was for the greater good and Euphemia's honor however she was of course gripped with guilt after it was used (same story with actual Einstein).  Was Nina an annoying table-rapist? Yeah, but Rolo was an annoying, homicidal and clingy psychopath, but he was able to redeem himself, and in my mind Nina was also able to do that towards the end of the series when she started to think for herself."
CodeGeass,2cpeip,GhostofSora,4,Tue Aug 5 22:23:31 2014 UTC,"Dude, I totally I understand her motives and her actions, it's part of why I hate her. I just find the qualities that she represents completely and utterly disgusting. Rolo was bad, but something about his somewhat unperturbed nature made him better in my eyes. You see, unlike Nina, his actions and choices are things that I can't see normal people around me doing (being a homicidal psychopath) so I can't make myself essentially hate it, I know it can't exist (in my perfect world). Whilst Nina's actions I see in people and sometimes in myself all the time, especially in the celebrity worshiping world we live in now and it bothers me in multiple levels. You're probably right, she was wrote to be hated."
CodeGeass,2cpeip,ratguy101,1 point,Wed Aug 6 00:30:36 2014 UTC,So you think Nina Einstein signed a Manifesto in the months Lelouch had full power and before he died. Who do you think Russell might have been. Kaguya Sumeragi maybe?
CodeGeass,2cpeip,Aatra,3,Wed Sep 17 15:15:48 2014 UTC,"Lelouch's ascension to the throne and then death were less than two months apart. She had no interaction with Lelouch until he captured her right after he took the UFN representatives as hostages. She decided of her own free will to join Lelouch, even if she couldn't forgive him for what he did. She knew that a united and loving world was Euphemia's wish and that she ""had to find her own answer to everything that had happened"".  As for Russell, I've got no clue who that is, and Google's not helping me out"

It highlighted the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict.

CodeGeass,2cpeip,megacookie,4,Tue Aug 5 21:45:37 2014 UTC,"She's actually very significant. She's an extremely racist character, but does it by illustrating an insidious kind of racism that's less overt. She sees herself as the victim of the vicious elevens, which justifies to her the brutality that's wrought upon them. It's so important becuase it's the kind of racism that's most common today. Think about the people who justify the Iraq war, which killed 500,000 people, because they hate ALL muslims for what a fringe group did during 9/11."
CodeGeass,2cpeip,Aatra,3,Tue Aug 19 05:29:58 2014 UTC,"I agree that the type of character that Nina was was necessary and had value. But Nina herself wasn't the right way to do it.

Open world, tonns of stuff to do and explore, customizable Character etc. The main Questline would eventualy have to branch into seperate ones for the Black Knights, Britannia and mybe some more factions. Maybe also throw in some difficult moral dillemas à-la the Witcher. Of course there would be at least one Questline that gives your Character Geass."
CodeGeass,2cps28,force200,1 point,Sun Aug 10 09:31:31 2014 UTC,"Oh I kinda see, I was thinking of a game from the point of perspective of lelouch but that could be interesting too. Have it be where at the start of the game the choices you make determines the geass you get. Mech combat would be a little bit hard to get right though."
CodeGeass,2cps28,redkiller4all,1 point,Sun Aug 10 18:21:42 2014 UTC,"A combination of Valkyria Chronicles (for strategy-based large scale battles with the ability to control individual units), Armored Core (for Knightmare piloting) and a healthy dose of over the top melee combat from anything by platinum games."
CodeGeass,2cps28,GamingGuru1992,1 point,Thu Aug 7 03:00:18 2014 UTC,I think it could be a pretty good FPS type of game with a Story Mode which was Statigic and could basically teach the player of fast and quick reactions like the show has it. Plus it can have you set in a Player vs Player at some points which could work.   A even cool thing is if you get more kills or something based on the gameplay you can unlock abilitys for the game which you can use on the enemy or the AI.  Let's say you got Lelouchs ability. You could use it on one of the AI or one of the other players for a short amount of time that player will become a teammate on your side. (Could be nerfed or be sorta like a final thing as its just an idea tho you could also do like Live which gives the player more health)  Over all i think this kind of game would be fun as it has the main story line which could be fun and will unlock abilitys which can change the tide of battle.   (Also to gain an extra ability you get to play as the table in the favorite scene everyone loves)

It's kind of chaotic, but there's also this tone of hope in it, but that's more subdued than in World's End. At the same time, there's a sense of forboding to it that you don't even notice until after episode 25. And I suppose that I just like the sound, the instruments, etc.   It's a shame, but I've looked up everything else from that band and I think they suck. XD"

The main character's ideas and planning in situations are quite smart, he is abnormally calm throughout it though.  I'm only up to the third episode, but I'm already really into it.  Plus it has Hiroyuki Sawano, the same composer who worked on Attack on Titan and Kill La Kill, so the soundtrack is awesome.  Of course there are giant robots too."
CodeGeass,2cknyq,Lelouchhh,1 point,Mon Aug 4 09:14:16 2014 UTC,"Well, the main character is way too calm/unnatural/emotionless and he seems to be an master pilot and also a master tactician.  Unlike Lelouch, who was a mediocre pilot and went though really bad emotional breakdowns and questioned his ideals.   It is still a pretty good anime, Im really enjoying it.   Zankyō no Terror is also a pretty good anime."
CodeGeass,2cknyq,HymenBane,6,Fri Aug 8 01:07:49 2014 UTC,"If you also liked Death Note, then I might recommend 2 animes that are currently airing this season.  Aldnoah.Zero - Mechs and all that, just like in Code Geass. Main character has good planning and deductive skills (thus far) a little like Lelouche.  Terror in Resonance - No mechs, but has wit and quick thinking just like in Code Geass and Death Note. Also similar in the fact that in deals with terrorism/rebellion and stuff.  Both so far are very well written just like Code Geass."

CodeGeass,2cknyq,Aatra,1 point,Fri Aug 8 01:40:35 2014 UTC,"Death Note and Code Geass are only similar superficially.   I'd say your best bet is Neon Genesis Evangelion. If you do watch this, skip the last two episodes and replace them with the movie End of Evangelion.   And in all honesty, there aren't may anime similar to it. It's unique in the way that it both idealizes and critiques various anime tropes/genres. Many of it's common themes are unique to it, especially in it's actually questioning something deep about humanity (the fact that the world revolves around lies) as opposed to being overly vague and pretending to be Socrates' Magnus Opium.

CodeGeass,2cagul,felipegbq,2,Fri Aug 1 01:24:32 2014 UTC,"also, think of lelouch's personality, hes not one to shift the blame on others and make himself look weak, only so that other people realise he didnt mean to do the things he did, hes really proud, and imo, he thinks accepting something didnt go according to plan would hurt him as much as the actual fact, at least this is how i see it of course."
CodeGeass,2cagul,Aatra,3,Fri Aug 1 02:37:07 2014 UTC,"A few reasons.  1) It was indirectly his fault, or as with Euphie, directly (he was being careless, in his eyes, though I hold to the theory that that was his Geass acting of it's own accord to make sure the contract is seen through to the end. Lelouch wouldn't need it as much during peacetime.)  2) Nobody would believe him at that point. He was such a villain in everyone's eyes that they were willing to believe anything about him and nothing from his lips. If you were absolutely sure a mass murderer (let's not beat around the bush) had killed 30 people, then news surfaced of them killing their best friend or sister as well, would you have a hard time believing it? And how guilty would they look if they said ""No! I didn't kill those ones."" You'd say, ""Yea right, here's another 200 years to your sentence."""

CodeGeass,2c1kxo,Veere,21,Tue Jul 29 14:09:09 2014 UTC,"They were modifying the fabric of reality to destroy the barriers that separate all beings. Instantly, every person alive and dead would be smashed together into a single entity. A single consciousness embodying all of humanity.   It's rather like the Human Instrumentality Project from Evangelion, or a more powerful version of the Khala from Starcraft.   They believe that humanity is actually one being, that people are fundamentally the same, and that the only way to stop the world from lying is to destroy the greatest lie itself: the lie of separation."
CodeGeass,2c1kxo,DeplorableVillainy,4,Tue Jul 29 19:21:43 2014 UTC,"That was well worded. I found the original dialogue that explained it to be a little awkward and confusing, but now it makes a little more sense."
CodeGeass,2c1kxo,dc880610,3,Tue Jul 29 20:47:48 2014 UTC,"That's a really good explanation. But if that's the case, why was the phrase 'stop time' a feature of their plan? I remember Lelouch saying he 'wanted to press forward into the future' (non-verbatim) as a rebuke to what Charles and Marianne wanted."
CodeGeass,2c1kxo,DeplorableVillainy,8,Wed Jul 30 03:54:32 2014 UTC,"A world without differences IS a world without change.   It's our interplay with each other and the environment around us that make life what it is. We need contrast to define the environment around us, and we need change to distinguish each moment from the next.   If there was a single human entity that encompassed the whole of mankind, humanity would cease to change. Past, Present, and Future would no longer have meaning to a being like that. Humanity, and our way of observing the universe, would be ""complete"" and time itself would become irrelevant. Time may as well stop at that point."
CodeGeass,2c1kxo,JealotGaming,3,Wed Jul 30 04:50:02 2014 UTC,Wow... That train of thought makes so much sense out of all the confusion.
CodeGeass,2c1kxo,DeplorableVillainy,2,Wed Jul 30 06:05:33 2014 UTC,"Lolwhat?Wasn't the Khala part of the Protoss Religion?All protoss were single entities,really the Hivemind and zerg were connected and controlled by a single entity."
CodeGeass,2c1kxo,OtakuMecha,2,Thu Jul 31 15:27:49 2014 UTC,"The Khala is quite a bit more than that. The books go into detail about it.  The Khala is actually a mind link that is created between Protoss people.  When in the Khala, you are yourself, but also not yourself. A person in the Khala can feel the feelings and remember the memories of others within it, as long as they are immersed in it. How much they can depends on how deep in it they go, but even at its gentlest level it's a bit mind-meldy.  Leave it and you become just yourself again, but many Khalai protoss couldn't bear the thought of leaving each other.   Because of the Khala, Protoss people usually have nothing but love and trust for each other. When it was implemented, it stopped the single bloodiest war in their history overnight.  If anything, you could say that it's an example of this sort of idea working out, but it usually operates on a smaller scale.   There are definitely faults, though. Just ask what they did to people who tried to opt out of it.  If you tried to close yourself off, or didn't want the mental link, you were viewed as evil, sinful, hiding something. The right to internal mental privacy was a huge social issue for their people."

CodeGeass,2bzr6m,Edwardaido,0,Tue Jul 29 00:06:33 2014 UTC,"well, on the wiki it says that the 50 episodes of r1 and r2 were realeased every week since beginning of r1 to the end of r2 (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Code_Geass_episodes), do you think they made 40 episodes, then started the series and made 10 more? That might be the case, I'm not sure how this stuff works.."
CodeGeass,2bzr6m,dc880610,3,Tue Jul 29 00:12:19 2014 UTC,"For reference, most American cartoons take quite a while to make, so they do end up starting with a handful but they still make them as the season goes on. The creators of both Adventure Time and Regular Show have said production for an episode usually takes about 9 months from scratch. I don't think CG would be quite as long since they seemed to have a clear direction for both R1 and R2 but it probably still takes a very long time.  Plus, they've been using a different style for the Knightmares, and who knows how long that takes."

It showed us the hard life she had before and that she wanted to be loved but was most likely punished...

For all intents and purposes, the appearance of death and subsequent escape from all public life is the death of the figure Lelouche created.

I reason that both of them are better off if Lelouch is dead.

CodeGeass,2bh5vn,themoondog,3,Wed Jul 23 14:28:44 2014 UTC,"I like to post this every time a topic like this comes up. My interpretation:  I don't think Lelouch knew that he had obtained Charles' code. I think the Zero requiem is exactly what it was shown to be. It wasn't that Lelouch wanted to receive his code, he really just wanted to die as a scapegoat, in repentance for all the sins that he committed. I think that that's why the driver/Lelouch held his head down, he was depressed that he wasn't able to receive his punishment. It's quite ironic, when you think about it. It's like a double edged sword; he is granted eternal life, but at the cost of bearing the burden of his sins for all eternity. There's no way that he'll ever grant Geass to anyone either, because it is unnecessary since the war is over, and he doesn't want anyone to suffer the same fate he did. I believe C.C. will feel the same way, and they'll just stay together forever. I think that is what makes this ending so great. In the first episode, when C.C. is giving Lelouch the terms of the contact she says: ""The power of the king will condemn you to a life of solitude."" Because of the events that transpired, they won't be forced to live in solitude. They'll be together forever, in a world of peace"
CodeGeass,2bh5vn,PureFresh,1 point,Fri Jul 25 04:12:34 2014 UTC,"I like your presentation of his immortality. Quite a lot.  Reminds me of the ""Boy Who Lived"" alternate ending for J.K. Rowling Harry Potter books, where Harry as the ""Boy Who Lived"" was immortal, all his actions were for his loved ones, but ultimately he would never be able to join them.  His life is not the ultimate sacrifice, it's his death instead. Both make the choice unknowingly. http://imgur.com/QsXxDWg"
CodeGeass,2bh5vn,PureFresh,5,Sat Jul 26 15:50:22 2014 UTC,"My interpretation was that the Lelouch/Zero that everyone knew/loved/hated did die in every way except physically. I think the fact that Lelouch had so many attachments that it was in his nature to stick around and be a silent guardian to those he cared about (after all, he first began his battle for Nunally, which evolved into the whole world), which is indicated by his sacrifice of everything to bring peace to others. Hence, his immortality was his final sacrifice for humankind - his way of atoning for his sins, and ensuring that his loved ones are safe."
CodeGeass,2bh5vn,pierogieman5,2,Wed Jul 23 09:10:53 2014 UTC,"But that's the thing, I honestly don't think he's strong enough to keep them away for the rest of their lifetimes, which is the only safe way to spend the beginning of his immortal life, as any sort attempt to reveal the ruse risks the peace.   Lelouch by the time of the execution parade is, on the inside, a tired man. He has done so much, his death and reputation which will outlast him is more than enough for atonement in my eyes. Immortality isn't necessarily a ticket to becoming an immortal guardian right from the get-go, imagine how long it'll take before the conditions are even right for him to start controlling the board again, or long it'll take before he's willing to or has to. There's good people in charge now, give them some credit.  He gave everyone a new world, but he gave a select few the burden of watching over it. He gave Nunally the throne and Suzaku the mask, along with paving the way for events such as Ohgi becoming Prime Minister, and Tianzi becoming a true ruler."
CodeGeass,2bh5vn,JealotGaming,6,Wed Jul 23 15:15:30 2014 UTC,"I disagree. I think Lelouch is very strong, and so emotionally attached to his world that he would feel like it was the only thing to do. Think of Lelouch as a dad. He'll scold and punish his loved ones but also love them unconditionally. He'll help them when they need it, do things without asking for gratitude and ultimately protect them. Lelouch demonstrated his strength when he destroyed his own reputation for his cause.  And what happens when Nunally dies? Or when Oghi grows old and senile? How could Lelouch possibly ensure that the right people are in command from the grave?   On another point, Lelouch was able to keep his identity a secret from his enemies, friends and family for a long time, I do believe that part wouldn't be a problem."
CodeGeass,2bh5vn,force200,3,Wed Jul 23 21:04:14 2014 UTC,"Lelouche was strong enough to kill Clovis and Euphemia, keep going on after Shirley's death, and ultimately stay true to his goal. Even when he thought Nunally was dead, he still swore to finish what he had started after some time. He spent a huge percentage of the show keeping his friends and loved ones at arms length. I don't think it would be beyond his ability to remain hidden from them."
CodeGeass,2bh5vn,kaidynamite,0,Thu Jul 24 10:55:59 2014 UTC,"Interesting point, I saw it as his death would mean he wouldn't have to force himself away from his loved ones anymore, those that died would be there in the World of C, and those that lived, specifically the few that know, would live on, not just because of him, but for him.  Immortality would prevent his rejoining with his deceased loved ones, for a significant time at least, for an eternity at most. That gets worse as more of his loved ones die as time progresses."

C.C.'s changed quite a bit, her decision on the Sword of Akasha is proof of that, and I feel that sort of exposure to someone such as Lelouch is enough make immortality for her not as bad of a thing now.  C.C. doesn't interact with the other characters nearly as much as Lelouch, she does not form attachments to them the way he did, as I've said before, what Lelouch leaves behind and C.C. leaves behind are significantly different from each other.   edit: This isn't to say that C.C. should be alone after Zero Requiem, it's just that she's facing a far better situation than Lelouch would be."

CodeGeass,2bf80v,Caleus,3,Tue Jul 22 19:23:45 2014 UTC,"I think what makes it stand out most from other anime is how blurred the line between good and evil is. It's so blurred it doesn't even exist in the anime. Some characters who we were expected to think of as ""evil"" in the beginning turned out to be very likable as the show went on and, respectively, some who were introduced as ""good"" slowly became more ruthless, to the point where you start doubting whether the concept of good vs evil even means anything. Does striving for the noble cause using destructive methods makes you a bad person? Does staying on the supposedly evil side, yet not agreeing with their ideology makes you a good person? Is the ""greater good"" more important than the deaths of thousands?  Due to this, most characters also turned out incredibly complex and multi-dimensional. From the beginning I admired Cornelia, so later I was glad that she officially stood up for justice. I believe her love for Nunnaly was exactly what defined her as ""good"" in my mind. The same with Lelouch: even though he behaved inhumanely by taking the will from people and playing them like pawns in chess, and he definitely abused the power he had, in the end he was doing it mostly for Nunnaly. That alone helped me not to see him as ""evil"" even when he did everything to make us think he is.   Also, for a long time, I didn't know what to make of Lloyd. Was he good or evil? In the end, I decided that he was neither. His type of character, the ""eccentric genius scientist"", is a very common trope in many animes, and he was no different. As for most scientist, progress was his ideology and what he valued most, and the times of trouble is where progress can thrive most. ""War is the mother of invention"", he said. So, the way I see it, while he doesn't intentionally wish ill for anyone, he would sacrifice whatever it takes for the name of science.  Not to mention that I've yet to see an anime with such a complex and shifting plot. Definitely one of the best animes I've ever seen.  (Wow, this turned out long...)"
CodeGeass,2bf80v,Sunjammer0037,2,Sat Jul 26 17:30:15 2014 UTC,"Actually about Lloyd...  I was re-watching R2 close to finale, and realized, that Suzaku and Lelouche spoke about Requiem itself freely with Lloyd being around. Which makes me think, his part and dedication was not limited to stopping Schneizel.   It made his character a bit deeper than like three previous times I watched it. In my understanding, it breaks that neutrality that you are talking about. Aside of Nina's redemption, Lloyd did continued as a major part of Requiem, which makes to question of the depth of his understanding.  sorry for the cruel usage of my broken English"
CodeGeass,2bf80v,ImKrypton,1 point,Sun Jul 27 00:32:38 2014 UTC,"Yeah you're right... But still, my point was that in this anime, it's impossible to neatly put most characters in the drawers ""good character"" and ""evil character"". It's much more vague and complex than that.  As for Nina, I believe she was just too immature to realize the consequences of her scientific experiments. And she strikes me as a tad emotionally unstable too. She outright fell in love with Euphemia after she saved her life and when Euphemia died, she was stricken with grief and revenge."

There's a massive list of the changes on the CG wiki. Look it up if you aren't worried about spoilers.  And yeah, removing knightmares was presumably done because the manga artist didn't want to draw them.

The English dubbed voice acting for Lelouch was fantastic; the show just wouldn't be the same without it, for me. On the other hand, a lot of the other voices could get aggravating, so I don't blame you for disliking the dub..  I kind of don't like to admit it, but I think a big part of it (IMO) is that the supporting characters just aren't as good of characters. Much more one-dimensional, much weaker lines of dialogue; I almost don't blame the voice actors (though, they don't help...)."
CodeGeass,2awjkc,dc880610,2,Fri Jul 18 00:00:02 2014 UTC,"I'll agree with this. On the one hand, with the anime taking place (mostly) in Britannia, English kind of adds to the atmosphere. On the other hand, bad voice acting ruins it completely. And... it's bad. Though that's a personal opinion."

Most of the main antagonists (Lelouch as well, actually) had philosophies to back up all the screwed up shit they did. So I think that while some of the characters philosophies were pretty fucked up (<cough> Schneizel <cough>) they believed that what they were doing was right, so very few were just straight evil."

He and shirley would probably argue about which One Direction boy sings the best.   Lelouch would be very into punk/metal, but he wouldn't let anybody know. It'd be a secret passion of his. He'd also listen to orchestral music, and any music with epic scales and choirs. LoTR soundtrack would be an orgasm for him.   Kallen would listen to Japanese punk/rock/metal to try to reconnect with her old culture. She'd like some, but not many, songs in English, but wouldn't admit it to anyone because she's slightly ashamed.   Llyod would listen to stoner music.   Milley would listen to the most sexual music she could find so that she could feel like a rebel.   Nunally would listen to cute pop songs.   Rollo would listen to whatever Lelouch listens to with the addition of deathmetal. Kid's hardcore.   Jerimiah Gotwald would listen to showtunes, but only the dramatic ones like Phantom of the Opera and Les Mis. I relate to his big personality, so I'm pretty familiar.   Cornellia would listen to stuff from the ""old days"", as I've found military types to like. She probably laments how far music has fallen while listening to the Beatles of all people.   Charles would listen to classical, and grudgingly admit that Lelouch has good tastes in that department.   C.C. thinks all music post-1800s is stupid. She's into that bard stuff.  Euphimia can die. She doesn't get to listen to music in Hell.   Viletta listened to regular music before she lost her memory, but now her iPod is cramed with Japanese music, but not exactly J-pop.

And it gives them self-esteem in most cases so this is just not right. Idk about the rest of it, but coming from a heavy/death metal fan, this is bs."

CodeGeass,2al4sq,SigmundFreud,15,Sun Jul 13 14:55:12 2014 UTC,Yes both are worth watching but what you have been told is wrong. R1 is the first season of Code Geass and R2 is season 2. If you were to try and watch R2 without seeing R1 you would be VERY lost. There are no new versions of code geass (unless you count the Akito the Exiled OVAs). If this isn't what you are referring to then I am sorry but from what I understand this was your problem.

CodeGeass,2ak2h0,redkiller4all,1 point,Mon Jul 14 00:20:45 2014 UTC,From what I've seen there is multiple Mangas. The Lelouch of the rebellion comes from it being about lelouch (in the manga it only his point of view) . There is also one with it being suzaku's point of view. I forgot the name but just search in code geass on a manga website and it should come up with every version (about 6 different ones).

She also played an important part in the Zero Requiem by leading the ""rebellion"" that stabilized the Empire after Lelouch's death. She also showed that she's got a heart when she rejected Schnizel's plan and tried to kill him to preserve the lives of many, in stark contrast to her senseless murder of Japanese in R1."

CodeGeass,2a99sw,redkiller4all,1 point,Sun Jul 13 05:43:13 2014 UTC,"1) I think it's pretty damn obvious given her high position, her being favored by Charle's favorite royal concubine, and the sheer similarities between her and him. I think it's a very safe assumption to make.   2) She knew to wait for Suzaku to kill Lelouch. She was quite obviously in on it, though probably not 100%.  How about where she tried to kill her beloved brother to preserve the lives of what R1 Cornelia would have called ""Lowborn scum""? That enough atonement for you?

There are also some picture dramas, which are on youtube I believe, and which are all english dubbed videos that indicate where they are in the timeline with their number (ie one of the episodes can be 12.5, meaning between turn 12 and 13).  There's also an Alice in Wonderland spinoff/parody that's hilarious and just oh so sweet.   There'll be no more Lelouch. Hate or like him, but Code Geass won't be the same without him, and it'll be a bit pathetic if the only way the franchise continues is by throwing Lelouch all over the place. Let him spoiler  You can watch the OVAs online with subtitles, but I don't believe there is an English dub.

The Eunuchs literally sell her off to Britannia and plan on abandoning China and it's citizens in order to become nobles of Britannia. In their eyes, Britannia will rule the world one day and wield more power than the Chinese Federation. The Black Knights is more or less icing on the cake to please the Britannia royals even more, hoping they get even more land, titles, and money.

He took 'death' before dishonor."
CodeGeass,296xvw,clinically_alive,2,Thu Jun 26 23:54:43 2014 UTC,The first one is explained well in the other posts.  As for the second one: He didnt really lie. He is responsible for the deaths both Euphemia and Shirley. Im assuming you meant Euphemia and not Nunnally. He blames himself for both those deaths. And no kind of explanation would suffice for suzaku anyway. He lost control of his geass? That doesn't make it any less of his fault.  Third: Suzaku changed after the fleija went off in tokyo. He tells Shneizel and Gino that he was naive until then.
CodeGeass,296xvw,kaidynamite,3,Fri Jun 27 20:55:26 2014 UTC,"First one: It would have been a gentle world in the same sense that George Orwell's 1984's society is a ""utopia"". Actually no, that's more about misinformation and loss of identity. It's more like Charles would have prevented not only the bad, but also the good (a world stuck in the present is the language I believe the anime uses). Lelouch decides that such a world is just as bad, if not worse, than the current one, because all sense of good is lost. While it's been a while sense I watched Code Geass, I think what Charles was trying to do was similar to what ended up happening in Evangelion (also a show I haven't watched in a while). Charles was going to accomplish this by influencing the ""god"" that Lelouch (supposedly) cast a Geass on (this ""god is the collective of ALL humans/humanity).    To restate: both Charles and Lelouch see that the past is full of pain and negativity. Charles proposes removing it all by ""being stuck in the present"" (not necessarily direct quote but I think a good paraphrase) while Lelouch believes that being stuck in the present, and not being able to hope for a better future (ie. not having the prospect any good or positive energy) is just as bad. Interestingly, both Charles and Lelouch have a necessary evil as a foundation of their actions/beliefs; it's what leads Charles to the solution he had, and it's what Lelouch... well, you know.  This is why Lelouch decides to center all the hatred/negativity on HIMSELF, and why he chooses to act so horribly; with Zero Requiem, he becomes the ""last"" negative thing in the ""future"" he's trying to create, and with his death, he creates the gentle/good world for Nunnally.  Of course, the negative ""past"" and the positive ""future"" are not entirely black and white, but Lelouch hopes to make his future as damn white as possible. Charles wasn't going to make it white OR black, but more along the lines of completely making colors irrelevant and unchanging.    Second One: Zero Requiem was conceived at some point shortly after Charles' death in the world of C, but most likely before he became emperor. Reason it's before he became emperor is because Lelouch uses the plan to essentially recruit Suzaku to be his the Knight of Zero. As such, he didn't plan for it from the beginning.    Didn't follow the part about lying. What I will say about Lelouch and lying is that he is a liar. The episode with Rolo's death, where he says ""you're brother is a liar"" shows just how manipulative Lelouch can be, even if it hurts him internally (you can argue a white lie for a dying person, I guess). So the potential for Lelouch to be manipulating Suzaku, even when he's begging with his face to the pebbles/rocks, is not something I would disqualify because of the severity of the situation. Of course, it's been a while since I watched the anime :P   Third One: Suzaku is a mixed bag for a lot of people because of this. What I'll say about the character is that he is supposed to represent the typical goodie-two shoes hero, who's going to change things the ""right"" way. What ultimately happens is that Suzaku and Lelouch are actually not that different; it's just that the former believes his methods are nobler, and his results more moral. Glass Reflections recently put up a video review of Code Geass on Youtube that touched on this briefly but well enough I think.    In terms of Suzaku's change at the end, I guess he just decided fuck this and stopped pretending to be morally superior. I'm not a big fan of the necessary evil/ends justify means argument, and this is obviously a fictional anime (so it's unrealistic value is exponentially larger than reality), yeah, what a great show."
CodeGeass,296xvw,wiithewalrus,1 point,Fri Jun 27 03:36:24 2014 UTC,"I'm not super clear on the first two myself but that last one, I like to think that Lelouch leveled with him and asked if he would participate in the zero requiem for the chance to be the ultimate inside man, as the assassin of anime Hitler and man of the people, Zero."
CodeGeass,296xvw,condor216,1 point,Thu Jun 26 23:30:06 2014 UTC,"Good point, he did become one of the most epic characters in anime alongside Lelouch during the finale. But I just wished they had developed his character a little more, at least discussing his views on the situation, for the last 2 episodes he seemed to be fairly bland without much emotion or depth. (which was obviously there, just wasn't shown)"
CodeGeass,296xvw,gammarik,1 point,Thu Jun 26 23:45:59 2014 UTC,Suzaku also had a moment where he stated that changing the world by gentle means was not the way forward. Although I can't remember when and where.

CodeGeass,296xvw,shadyelf,1 point,Fri Jun 27 14:20:35 2014 UTC,"Just finished it myself, and for the first one it would basically create a world where nothing would change. Every single consciousness, dead or alive, would be brought together. In this form everyone would see the true self of others so there would be no lies, no conflict.   But Lelouch counters by saying Nunally wanted a world where even strangers could be kinda to each other, of their own will and without the need of a world where we'd all be one basically.  So what I got out of Lelouch's reasons was   Free will some philosophical thing about ""can it be life if there is no death?""   Still trying to wrap my ahead around this so feel free to disagree."
CodeGeass,296xvw,shadyelf,1 point,Thu Jun 26 23:45:05 2014 UTC,"So in charle's world everyone would become one? together as some massive consciousness?

CodeGeass,296xvw,Aurabolt,1 point,Thu Jun 26 23:48:49 2014 UTC,"yeah destroying the god would have merged everyone into one massive consciousness. Beyond that it gets a bit murky for me.

This leaves us with a feeling of wonder and intrigue that lasts even after the finale. That sounds kind of lame, but it basically makes the anime bigger than its already massive self... if that makes sense.  In a way, at the end, we feel like we have about the same level of knowledge and understanding as Kallen. I'm sure there are some aspects that she doesn't fully understand, either. Lelouch was a damn insane genius, and the things he was dealing with (Charles' plan?) were equally insane.. I'm OK acknowledging there was something, but it's not extremely important, because Lelouch took care of it for us :)"
CodeGeass,296xvw,pierogieman5,1 point,Fri Jun 27 04:30:33 2014 UTC,"i feel like the point of the ending was made clear during lelouch's confrontation with charles and his mother in z's world his father and mother would prefer a perpetual state of the past, a world of memories in which there were no more secrets and no more putting on airs. a finished and complete world, as lelouch put it  schneizel on the other hand was willing to stagnate the world into a state of the present. never to get any better, never to get any worse -- better the devil you know, that's how i took it. shneizel renounced the idea of people controlling their own future, and instead opted to control or subvert the entire population under the threat of fleijas (nuclear proliferation)  lelouch, of course, represented the future. the unknown, and hopeful idea of a world constructed anew. i don't think the point is to say that he ""won"" or that they lived ""happily ever after"". i think the reality, even from episode one, is that the world was heading towards disaster. lelouch, with his amazing power of geass, really did destroy the status quo and created a new world. you're not meant to know if nunally's wish was fulfilled, but there is at least hope that he did so. mission complete, as far as i see it  at the same time, he was able to finally face off against charles (his nemesis and father) and disavow the oppression of his past (and analogously, the pasts of all the lives who they claim they wanted to preserve) sorry if that's longwinded. but to me the point of lelouch's story is that fighting for a future is always more hopeful than living in the past or things staying just the same as they are now"
CodeGeass,296xvw,JealotGaming,1 point,Fri Jun 27 06:11:10 2014 UTC,"I answered question 2 up above and i feel one has been answered sufficiently by the utopian argument so ill take 3 now because its simple. Suzaku's hallmark as a character is that he is emotional wreck and views himself in a way that is impossibly different from who he really is. Just like many real world people, he sees himself in light of who he wants to be, and rejects who he truly is. He runs completely on his emotional desires and is in fact, as Anya points out, a bit of a masochist. He likes to play the sacrificial role but out of selfishness. All this is made evident early in episode 8 where during the hotel jacking we see him say ""i prefer the logic of systems."" This couldnt be farther ftom the truth as Suzaku often ignores logic completely. Its part of what makes the show so great. Lelouch and Suzaku are polar opposites in every way.  So all this leads to the answer that is in fact very much like Suzaku to abandon his change from within plan and join Lelouch. He gets his satisfaction for playing the sacrificial role, he gets to feel like he is fulfilling euphemias desires, and he hets to feel like he is meeting out justice on Lelouch. These are all very emotional events. Because Suzaku functions based on his emotions not what is logical or a set of rules, he does what seems right to him in his mind at the time. From the begining through end of the show, Lelouch's trademark is lies, Suzaku's is betrayal."

CodeGeass,296xvw,LelouchtheGreat,1 point,Thu Jul 3 15:15:40 2014 UTC,"about a world without lies and the next talking about how they will be resurrecting everyone who is dead? I didn't understand any of that,    A world which is supposed to be kind to evetyone,no masks and wars and so on.   I also didn't understand why Lelouch felt the need to deny that. The entire mission of his rested on the fact that Nunally could live in a gentle world.   He denied it because ""That world will only be gentle to you!"".And also because progression will be stopped.   When Lelouch and Szsaku finally meet face to face Lelouch admits to killing both Euphemia and Shirley. Why?    He himself said that he seeks the Future.   Suzaku always claimed he wanted to change the system from within.... and yet he goes and completley changes his life long views by joining up with Lelouch and causing the deaths of countless individuals.    Probably because Suzaku is a hypocrite who says he's doing the right thing but does the same thing Lelouch does,then critisizes Lelouch for doing it.He also has a change of heart after firing the first Fleyija in the tokyo settlement  This is my point of view mostly,it may or may not be wrong."
CodeGeass,296xvw,kaidynamite,1 point,Wed Jul 9 13:47:52 2014 UTC,"While Code Geass is probably my favorite anime, I have to say that one of my biggest issues with the show was your second point.  It made no sense to me when Lelouch lied to Suzaku during that meeting. For example, why say that he purposefully commended Euphemia to kill the Japanese in order to fuel public opposition to Brittania? Since Lelouch went through the trouble to ask Suzaku there and have that conversation, why not be honest at that point? Why not say that the Geass on Euphemia was an accident and a terrible mistake? It would be truthful, while also helping to persuade Suzaku to side with Lelouch (and relieve some of Suzaku's hard feeling).  Along the same lines, most of his lies just didn't make sense to me. It would have made far more sense for Lelouch to be honest: admit to using Geass to advance his agenda, while acknowledging that he used it fairly conservatively, and also being upfront about mistakes that he made.  Instead, it seemed like he just lied for no reason -- except to provide justification for the later plot twist, in which Schneizel presents a recording of Lelouch's out-of-context lies to the Black Knights in order to turn them against Lelouch.  Also, about your first point: I've watched the whole show three times (maybe more, I've lost track), and I'm still not quite 100% on understanding Charles's entire plan. I watched it dubbed in English, so it wasn't a problem with the subtitles (for me). It seemed rushed and wasn't explained well, in my opinion."

CodeGeass,291bw6,redkiller4all,2,Wed Jun 25 16:55:31 2014 UTC,"They sound great! However, keep in mind that my music collection is composed of anime music (OST, bonus CDs, OP/EDs) or related, the extra bass boost really immerses you into the song (examples: Bios from Guilty Crown, Gurren Lagann OST, etc.).   I also listen on my HTC One, which I use in conjuction with music players that support EQ. Sometimes I lower the bass on some songs (when I listen at home, because it's silent) but outdoors, the extra bass boost almost acts as another isolation field. So I'd say it's mostly aimed for portable use.  As a moderator of /r/animemusic and thus only listening to said genre, the other genres I can't comment on (classical, rap, etc.) , but I've heard that electronic/pop are the best on these (which is what I listen to). That being said however, songs like Happy Fate from Choucho or Heart Realize from Supercell's Tia still sound really nice despite them hosting a more calmer variety of instruments. The soundstage is really quite excellent despite them being small cans, and songs sound ""fun"" and, again, immersive.  Songs that sound really good on these include This game (No Game no Life OP), COLORS and World's End, happily ever after from Gurren Lagann, Hacking to the Gate from Steins;Gate, No pain no game and Nevereverland by Nano, all the Guilty Crown opening and endings. I'd say if you share similar music interests as me, you'd love it :P  EDIT: Oh, you've never heard of V-MODA. Um, their Crossfade M-100 series (300 dollars) has a ton of raving good reviews. They're for bass-heads admittely but I can't say I'm a bass-head but everything still sounds crystal clear to me. You can search up the M-100 for reviews, they're generally all positive. The M-80s are also a valid option, but they're on-ear as opposed to over-ear. If you order from the V-MODA website they give you free custom shields (which if you order off Amazon, you can't get. It's a 25 dollar value) so that's where I got em. The M-100s was everything I needed in a headphone (isolation, look cool, customization, great sound) and so this purchase was one of my 'best' purchases, so to speak :P"

Suzaku would never know who Zero really was, because he only suspected since Lelouch was chasing the cat, and missing school the exact same time Suzaku missed classes. as /u/KeyBlader358 said, he wouldn't have sympathy for the students, and may make some different choices, especially when the students were held hostage in the hotel.

However, Lelouch's previous actions are not like Christ and are anti-Christ if anything. His usage of people, apathetic mass killings, and the fact that he continually refers to himself as a ""devil"" aren't very Christ like.

CodeGeass,28jrjk,Aatra,2,Thu Jun 19 15:59:36 2014 UTC,Christ Figures need to share much more in common with Jesus to be given that title. Merely coming back from the dead isn't enough.
CodeGeass,28jrjk,WackyModder84,1 point,Wed Jul 9 16:57:31 2014 UTC,"If we're talking about Lelouch, then yes, absolutely. Lelouch is by no means Perfect in Every Way.  Kira Yamato on the other hand is the total opposite."
CodeGeass,28jrjk,kaidynamite,1 point,Wed Jul 9 18:53:14 2014 UTC,"Dark Jesus IMO. I mean, his death invoked Jesus-on-the-cross imagery pretty clearly. Kallen=Peter, most loyal follower who denies him before his death, only to realize their mistake later. I still believe in the resurrection of our Emperor Lelouch vi Britannia, since Marianne was never shown to be dead when CC talked to her... But that's probably just because the writers were making shit up as they went along and creating some pretty significant inconsistencies."

CodeGeass,28b7yp,redkiller4all,5,Mon Jun 16 20:54:09 2014 UTC,"Lelouch UA: Geass: If used, every civ will agree to one trade no matter what it is once."
CodeGeass,28b7yp,IgnitedSpade,2,Mon Jun 16 22:06:20 2014 UTC,that could be a bit op. You could destroy the other civ easy by just having them trade you everything and have them go to war with each other.
CodeGeass,28b7yp,Shinkir0u,1 point,Mon Jun 16 22:37:23 2014 UTC,That would work out rather nicely if it could only be used once per civ.
CodeGeass,28b7yp,TopicCreator,3,Tue Jun 17 13:27:28 2014 UTC,Unfortunately this mod has been given up on by the developer. There's a lot of game breaking bugs still as well (i.e. one commentator says the game no longer works past 1994). The last update to the game was over a year and a half ago.
CodeGeass,28b7yp,Bravario,1 point,Tue Jun 17 16:44:06 2014 UTC,Here is a small release of that mod. It has some of the already completed stuff in it but it doesnt have everything.

CodeGeass,28a8xe,Thorium-229,11,Mon Jun 16 15:18:10 2014 UTC,He also had that one girl mark on tje wall every day to dee how long it will work. I don't think it ever mentions it stopping
CodeGeass,28a8xe,screw_all_the_names,3,Mon Jun 16 17:04:32 2014 UTC,Yes and no.  Mild Spoiler
CodeGeass,28a8xe,DeplorableVillainy,8,Mon Jun 16 18:01:18 2014 UTC,For verifiable stuff like this don't answer before you've checked. As per the wiki Mild Spoiler  http://codegeass.wikia.com/wiki/Carve-tan
CodeGeass,28a8xe,heidurzo,3,Tue Jun 17 03:54:04 2014 UTC,Thank you for the correction.   My statement was based off what we see in the show. I wasn't aware that things like this had been addressed by the creators after the fact.   Cool business.
CodeGeass,28a8xe,DeplorableVillainy,1 point,Tue Jun 17 04:29:00 2014 UTC,They mentioned her evac during the show.

CodeGeass,28a8xe,Thorium-229,1 point,Mon Jun 16 18:59:11 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that guy."
CodeGeass,28a8xe,Jourdy288,4,Mon Jun 16 19:00:55 2014 UTC,"R2 spoilers  I mean, really, Lelouch probably should have just said ""Obey all my future orders"" every time he used his geass. Would've saved him a bunch of trouble."
CodeGeass,28a8xe,Thorium-229,10,Mon Jun 16 19:10:34 2014 UTC,"He typically never did this, presumably out of respect for free will.  But when he was desperate enough to do it, it is shown working as expected."
CodeGeass,28a8xe,DeplorableVillainy,2,Mon Jun 16 18:05:17 2014 UTC,"once he starts commanding people to 'be his slave', i take this to mean exactly what you suggest  obviously if lelouch would have done so earlier then there wouldn't be much of a plot"
CodeGeass,28a8xe,queensavior,2,Mon Jun 16 19:17:21 2014 UTC,"His Geass gets stronger throughout the show, similar to Mao, so presumably he wouldn't have been able to permanently enslave someone earlier on, but obviously he can in R2 with R2"
CodeGeass,28a8xe,Baconoflight,2,Tue Jun 17 04:00:54 2014 UTC,"There's some slight complications to ""follow my future orders"" that people might not have pointed out yet.  For example, random off-hand comments may be taken literally as comments. Lelouch would need to become overwhelmingly aware of every comment he makes around people he commanded to avoid any extremely unfortunate accidents."
CodeGeass,28a8xe,xdavid00,2,Tue Jun 17 06:07:21 2014 UTC,"Indeed, like if he was at the UN and he noticed the skill the Japanese ambassador has with diplomacy."
CodeGeass,28a8xe,condor216,2,Tue Jun 17 13:44:47 2014 UTC,Yes Spoiler I am not sure but it could be that this is the same. Best scene of the whole series btw.
CodeGeass,28a8xe,aazang,2,Sun Jun 22 11:31:32 2014 UTC,"Multiple times,Spoiler"
CodeGeass,28a8xe,JealotGaming,2,Mon Jun 23 16:41:33 2014 UTC,"He does. Every person who is a part of his royal guard was given the command ""Obey my Commands!""  The point of Lelouch not doing that until so late in the anime is to show that he has respect for his fellow man. He has to be careful about how he uses his Geass because he could destroy a man's life with it. Imagine being one of those Guradsman. THey loose their memory every time that Geass kicks in, so that's every time Lelouch gives an order. They would have huge holes in their memory, and they wouldn't be sure about anything."
CodeGeass,28a8xe,Aatra,1 point,Wed Jul 9 17:01:01 2014 UTC,"Yeah, he does it in R2"

CodeGeass,2896vy,unkn00wn1,9,Mon Jun 16 04:20:38 2014 UTC,"I think the end result would have been the same.   If I were to find out that my superior (which I respect 100%) has an ability to make anyone obey his command, I would lose all trust in him since I wouldn't know what he's commanded or will command me to do.  Besides, in that situation, I would think that the 'only works once per person' rule is ridiculous."
CodeGeass,2896vy,Veere,7,Mon Jun 16 04:45:57 2014 UTC,"Paranoia and fear are powerful tools; that ""Was he controlling me?"" aspect brought down the bridge of trust in an instance."
CodeGeass,2896vy,oshare_banchou,6,Mon Jun 16 14:23:36 2014 UTC,They would have been accepting off it like they are when Schneizel reveals it. It's only when they're told specifics of whom he used it on that they make up their minds.
CodeGeass,2896vy,Crustin,2,Mon Jun 16 05:37:49 2014 UTC,"The actual question is, why the fuck they believed Schneizel, their enemy."
CodeGeass,2896vy,TxXxF,2,Sat Jun 21 09:21:31 2014 UTC,"Because the evidence was very convincing, in particular for Princess Massacre."

CodeGeass,27xoyd,Siuzio,5,Thu Jun 12 03:44:03 2014 UTC,"I like it, though I would assume the closing of the capsule would be the end of R2 and the reopening would be R3. I think the ending we got though is better, one of the best endings in anime, but I would still love an excuse to get a third season."
CodeGeass,27xoyd,Rockmanll,5,Thu Jun 12 14:49:33 2014 UTC,"The part with C.C. was a bit cheesy, but the rest up until him telling her his name was really well made. However I don't like the name. R.R. sounds bit weird :P I was hoping for him to yell either ""I am Lelouch Li Britannia!"" or ""I am Zero!"". Would've made it a lot more epic ;) and yeah, I get why you (or the creator, in case you're not him) choose a double letter again, it makes sense, but still... Other than that, it was great!"
CodeGeass,27xoyd,gammarik,3,Thu Jun 12 06:15:28 2014 UTC,Really good but the part with CC didn't need to happen when Suzaku stabbed Lelouch. Could've easily happened in the church before hand when Lelouch gave Suzaku Zero's helmet.
CodeGeass,27xoyd,Zugam,3,Thu Jun 12 10:18:28 2014 UTC,"I think this way is better (if a bit cheesy with the timing) because Lelouch was prepared to die and really didn't want to live forever. If the code transfer/activation happened in the church then he would have gone to his own ""execution"" knowing full well it was a farce."
CodeGeass,27xoyd,megacookie,3,Thu Jun 12 11:57:16 2014 UTC,Lelouch ignores Nunnally and leaves her behind again   ( ;︵;)  ;     ;  ;     ;  ;     ;   ;     ;  Those nostalgic feels

CodeGeass,26kne1,fox112,2,Tue May 27 08:22:08 2014 UTC,Deep breathes comrade. The ending is ambiguous. This means there's evidence to justify your (and my) theories on Lelouch being alive. It also means that the naysayers are more than justified in their respective opinions of the ending.
CodeGeass,26kne1,wiithewalrus,2,Tue May 27 20:08:41 2014 UTC,/s is used the internet to denote sarcasm

CodeGeass,26kne1,wiithewalrus,5,Wed May 28 22:46:37 2014 UTC,Just wanna tweak one little thing about this: Kallen DOES realize what happens at the very end. It's why she insists it's Zero when another Black Knight starts connecting dots. I believe it's considered canon that the higher ups of the Black Knights come to know of Lelouch's intentions and of Zero Requiem (especially with Suzaku being Zero)  Glad you enjoyed the series! Check out Akito the Exiled for a bit more on the universe (not as much overlap in characters with R1 and R2)
CodeGeass,26kne1,LombaxTheGreat,2,Tue May 27 20:07:13 2014 UTC,This post explains my feelings on the show entirely.

And now, to remember it and watch it from now and here out."
CodeGeass,26kne1,TxXxF,2,Thu May 29 01:09:57 2014 UTC,"Honestly, that black knights thing though was no betrayal by lelouch. Schneizel outplays him and the bks themselves chose to trust their enemy istead of their leader. Lelouch had no choice."
CodeGeass,26kne1,KingScrapMetal,2,Fri May 30 19:35:50 2014 UTC,"I've seen it all the way through twice and I gotta say I loved it. In fact, I watched death note after and felt myself comparing them as well. CC was still alive after and could carry on his good intentions with her, but I know what you mean. The story wouldn't be as great in the end if only the viewer(and CC) knew what was gonna happen. The irony in it all is what makes it great.    Glad you enjoyed it. I recommend Sword Art Online if you haven't seen it. Look into it at the very least."

CodeGeass,26kne1,kaidynamite,1 point,Tue May 27 16:45:01 2014 UTC,"but it sort of frustrates me that he died with nobody knowing of his good deeds.   that isnt true at all. The people who matter know the truth. The leaders of the Black Knights, Nunnally, the top heads of the UFN, Kallen, Cornelia, Lloyd and Cecile, Nina etc.   As for ""good deeds""-they really weren't. He said it himself. He spilled an ocean of blood. He had good intentions and they might even be the only way to achieve them but his actions were hardly what someone would call 'good'."
CodeGeass,26kne1,basedwindu,1 point,Tue May 27 19:28:04 2014 UTC,Exactly who amongst the Black Knights and UFN do you think knew? That's bugged me for awhile. Obviously Kaguya knew. Who else I wonder.

CodeGeass,26kne1,basedwindu,2,Wed May 28 01:56:09 2014 UTC,I can't recall any of them showing any recognition like Kallen and Kaguya did. Without knowing Suzaku was Zero they wouldn't have known for sure. Are you assuming they just put two and two together?

Nunally knew for sure, and I think most of the Black Knights leadership probably suspected. I'm about 99% sure Kallen knew as well.  Then you have Jeremiah and what's-her-name that Marianne was controlling (I remember her Knightmare's name but not hers for some reason), and probably everyone that was close to Lelouche near the end (including Suzaku, obviously)."

CodeGeass,26gbja,FuajiOfLebouf,3,Sun May 25 16:42:32 2014 UTC,Watch r2 it explains in like the second or third episode of r2
CodeGeass,26ffx4,KeyBlader358,8,Sun May 25 05:43:52 2014 UTC,"The way knightmares seem to usually function is on two legs, it would be very easy to topple them over from the side with a missile of the right caliber. Also even though there is an eject button, the driver is still more vulnerable then let's say a tank. It is a good idea in concept, but in reality I'm not sure anything of that size would be implemented. On the offset that we do have knightmares in our armies, they would most likely be too slow, or too expensive. There may be a slight chance of mechanized warfare in the distant future, but i doubt it will be in out lifetime."
CodeGeass,26ffx4,mrpizza531,3,Sun May 25 06:34:49 2014 UTC,"Well one thing that knightmare frames are is if they make them out of strong tank armor then they could take a good shot. as for toppling over they will be just like a person getting pushed, they could balance out. The big thing though is the wheels, If you watch the star of the first few episodes of r1 is shows the knightmares speeding to the back of the tanks before it could spin it's barrel around. Heavy weapons are meant for heavy targets which aren't really fast. A knightmare would be a whole thing of speed vs armor."
CodeGeass,26ffx4,redkiller4all,2,Sun May 25 20:34:28 2014 UTC,"I understand your reasoning, and you convinced me that if done right then knightmares would be useful in military tactics if we could get the balance and speed right. I just doubt that we will have knightmares mostly because I the cost if making one."
CodeGeass,26ffx4,mrpizza531,5,Sun May 25 23:21:31 2014 UTC,"I'm sure modern militaries would love to have a few knightmare frames if someone was just giving them away for free, but they definitely wouldn't be worth the effort to build today and they have a few features that would make them impractical even for use in the future (when they might be cheaper to make). As far as power sources and materials go, it's perfectly conceivable that all of those complications could be addressed even in the near future (at a prohibitive expense, mind you; like several global combined annual military budgets prohibitive) and certainly in the more distant future (much more cheaply). Robotics is advancing fast enough to deal with all the control issues even in the near(ish) future; power sources are rapidly getting more efficient; and I'm sure things like carbon or boron nanotubes could be used to create the materials necessary to handle the job, although those substances are currently too expensive to produce in mass quantity.  Why no one would ever bother: First, the humanoid form of the knightmare frame serves no practical function. Humanoid mechas appear in anime because humanoid mechas are cool. But four legs are better than two, and that's assuming legs would even have any kind of advantage over wheels, tracks, or just some landing gears and a Williams X-Jet style hover system. And heads? With faces? There's definitely no reason for superweapons to have those. Second, they have pilots. Inside them. If you're going to build something that advanced and expensive, it's probably going to be completely unmanned and operated by AI; at a bare minimum you're going to have your pilot operating remotely in a secure bunker a few kilometers away.  So yeah, they'd definitely be useful in combat. Aside from small scale, SWAT-type stuff, they could fill pretty much any role our modern weapon systems are used for. And they're even kinda sorta halfway plausible to make. But all that money and effort that would have to be poured into them could be spent a lot more efficiently on more antimissile lasers, bigger bombs, or even stuff like small AI-driven non-humanoid combat robots. On the other hand, I could see something like knightmare frames being used for entertainment purposes in the distant future. Maybe two hundred years from now, humanoid mecha battles could be the equivalent of Battlebots or Robot Wars."

CodeGeass,26ffx4,LocutusOfBorges,2,Sun May 25 13:30:20 2014 UTC,"Knightmare Frames?  Absolutely impossible.  No material would be ever able to withstand the strain of supporting a body that size, moving with the speed and agility we see the frames possess in the show.  Not to mention the control of such machines is inconcievable when you think about it... They really just hold on to joysticks with trackballs on them, how exactly do they manage to manipulate the entire body, including the fingers?  Steel Battalion type mobile suits, I would much sooner expect.  Slow, ponderous, tank-like machines that definitely don't fly or jump around."

CodeGeass,26ffx4,LocutusOfBorges,3,Sun May 25 09:56:34 2014 UTC,"That isn't really a potential application for CNT, though.  They have excellent tensile and elastic strength, but are very fragile when subject to buckling, compressive, torsional, or bending forces.  Which there would be a ridiculous amount of those in a Knightmare Frame.  Its a basic property of the structure (they're tubes), and wound never likely be overcome."

Also CC remarks in episode 24 of season one about how good of a pilot jeremiah is when she and Lelouch battle him in the Gawain. I believe the radical (and humorous) changes jeremiah goes through overshadow his ability as an excellent pilot, and had he been given a next gen knightmare, we dont kno how formiddable he may have been"

CodeGeass,25q6g3,titanshita,21,Fri May 16 17:27:54 2014 UTC,"Geass-net mobile site explains in Nunnally’s profile that her blindness gives her the ability to see through the hearts of people just by touching their hands, and in the final episode she found out everything with said ability. Officially, that flashback scene had nothing to do with Lelouch and Codes.   That just seems like bs to me. It always seemed like Nunnally would take people's hands to feel their pulse to determine if they were lying or not. Not to use some unmentioned power, with no basis or hints, to see into their hearts.  Plus she was able to see at the time of Lelouch's death."
CodeGeass,25q6g3,sean151,7,Fri May 16 18:33:45 2014 UTC,"It's definitely BS for her to get such clairvoyance to such an extent without Geass or contact with a Codebearer. Nunnaly has touched Lelouch's hand plenty of times earlier in the series and she definitely couldn't see into his memories due to her ""ability"". Otherwise she would have known about Lelouch being Zero from very early in season 1. The only other explanation beyond the obvious one of Lelouch's code taking effect is that she didn't actually see that flashback, and it was just shown to the audience for effect.   In reality she could have been trying to make sense of him over some time, the kind protective brother clashing with the masked revolutionary/terrorist and power-crazed, heartless, mind-enslaving tyrant...what kind of person is her brother really and what is just a cruel lie? Maybe her final encounter with Lelouch had her realize that he was still a good person, one who would rather die than turn into the monster of an emperor that he paraded himself as. Just as Kallen figured out the truth for herself with the sight of SuZeroku committing the assassination being the final piece in the puzzle, Nunnaly probably had her final confirmation by touch before it all made sense. Why else would he die while being completely content and peaceful when he just had a huge sword run through him as the whole world watched? A real tyrant would be shocked, furious, and terrified after being cut down mere months after achieving uncontested domination. Knowing Lelouch, she probably figured he must have planned for this and used world domination as a means to justify an end far greater than his own life.   As for his exact plans, she could never have figured all that out by touch alone had she not come up with an eerily similar plan to his, but centering all the world's hate on and sacrificing an object (the Damocles) instead of a person. She had told her plan to Lelouch and it made up his mind to use Geass to stop her, probably because it struck a little close to home."
CodeGeass,25q6g3,megacookie,5,Sat May 17 01:23:07 2014 UTC,I agree.  My assumption at the end of R2 was that she saw the flashback when she touched Lelouch because he had taken CC's code.  Since the only other times such flashbacks happened was when someone touched CC.
CodeGeass,25q6g3,RiftOfBelief,-4,Fri May 16 18:43:00 2014 UTC,"The way I see it is if it ends that way, pretty much all of S2 was pointless because the ending meant nothing (from a geass standpoint).  If Lelouch dies then CC is back to square one and the whole series was pointless."

CodeGeass,25q6g3,llorttt,2,Fri May 16 19:04:12 2014 UTC,"Honestly I don't really care what the ""true ending"" is or if there is one. I think it can be interpreted in many ways and for me Lelouch is still alive. For others they may think his death is a better interpretation for them since it shows that he has truly sacrificed everything for his dream. I'd like to think that his ""death"" is the death of just his alter evil king ego and after giving up everything Lelouch and CC are kind of reborn and free from their curse."

Her true wish was actually for someone to love her but since everyone she had ever known is dead since she is immortal her wish ends up being to die.   So assuming Lelouch is dead wouldn't she still move on towards that wish which would mean somebody else down the line would receive a geass from her?  The problem here is that would directly contradict lelouchs whole plan to ""erase the power of geass"" and would also leave his promise unfulfilled.  Add that to the fact that if you are dead than i would safely say that you are indeed alone which would contradict c2's last words.  I guess i just assumed that he fulfilled c2's wish by being with her eternally hence she no longer had the desire to die since she would have him to love her eternally."
CodeGeass,23xe1s,ZhaoLongsun,1 point,Fri Apr 25 15:14:34 2014 UTC,"Or maybe C.C wasn't talking about the fact that her and Lelouch are together and thus not lonely, but maybe about the way Lelouch lead his life for a cause greater than his own self (even if it ended in the world hating him). Geass is supposed to lead one to a life of solitude, eventually isolating one from interacting with the world due to the uniqueness and unfairness of their power preventing any meaningful relationships from forming out of secrecy, fear, distrust, and betrayal. While Lelouch certainly did feel the isolation of Geass, he didn't allow it to break him or dictate his life. He made enemies, betrayed friends, and lost those close to him, but he did not give up on the world and he retained his humanity. So even if he died, he did not die alone or in vain. I believe C.C could still have said what she did even if Lelouch ""failed"" her wish of death because even during their brief time together he granted her wish of being truly loved as a companion and partner."
CodeGeass,23xe1s,megacookie,1 point,Fri Apr 25 19:57:02 2014 UTC,It certainly is open to interpretation but throughout the show i always got the feeling she would do what was in her best interest regardless.  Guess its just my own feelings that the limited time she had of happiness wouldnt be enough for her to live out eternity in the solitude she so desperately wanted to end.  I just feel like if thats the case it leaves the possibility for sequels when she decides to give out geass again and the world is once again thrown into turmoil.  After all she is the immortal witch who was obviously extremely self centered judging by the flashbacks of when she had her geass.
CodeGeass,23xe1s,ZhaoLongsun,1 point,Sat Apr 26 00:53:20 2014 UTC,"I actually do think it's more likely that Lelouch survived with the code than that he's dead, because of things that can't be explained otherwise. Mainly Nunnaly seeing Lelouch's memories/flashbacks when she touched him. However, I find the ending much more powerful and meaningful if he died. While it's a horrible fate for C.C to continue living forever and alone, Lelouch Vi Britannia has no place in the new world he created. Sure, he could have gained the Code from Charles either with or without his knowledge, but the completion of the Zero Requiem and the exchange of world peace for his life seems fraudulent if he had not planned to die. One of Lelouch's most famous sayings is 'The only ones who should kill, are those who are prepared to be killed', and over the course of the rebellion(s), ascention to the throne, and final battle he has been responsible for countless deaths and tragedies, whether it were intentional, inevitable, or accidental. It is very thematic that Lelouch were to willingly offer his own life as the price to pay for both his own sins and the sins of the world."
CodeGeass,23xe1s,megacookie,1 point,Sat Apr 26 01:26:05 2014 UTC,"Whew three months late.   I don't think it would have mattered if Lelouch actually died, as long as the character of Lelouch vi Britannia died. He and the world could just live happily ever after if he laid low."
CodeGeass,23xe1s,wtrmlnjuc,2,Sun Jul 27 05:02:48 2014 UTC,"the theory of lelouch using a war prisoner makes no sense because a geassed person would not have said ""i destroy worlds i create worlds"" neither would they have the memories that were shown when nunally touched lelouch. The only possible endings are Lelouch is dead or he lives eternally with c.c"
CodeGeass,23xe1s,Linsanityv1,2,Fri Apr 25 18:23:46 2014 UTC,"I mean it's an option, but it's not really Lelouch's style. Lelouch gained immortality, established world peace and understanding, faked his death and rekindled the icon of Zero all in one fell swoop. It was his final move, his final checkmate, he won everything."

Now, your theory isn't wrong, but it's as the top post says: it's not so much of a happy, wrap-up ending. I like either one. To think the entire time he was doing it for a just cause, is just nicer. However, to think he had gone completely off the deep end is less fantasy-like.    Your choice, man. Haha"

CodeGeass,23tko4,-TheLethalAlphX-,6,Sun Apr 27 01:17:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the WTF part isn't that Nina would masturbate to the princess or that she's humping furiously against a table, but that it was somehow worth actually including that scene in the first place. At least they had the courtesy to keep it fairly dark and not show any passion fluids, unlike Shinji's handiwork at the beginning of End of Evangelion. But it actually made more sense in the overall messed up concept of EoE than in Code Geass, where it really didn't add anything of relevance to the story or discussion besides endless ""NINA RAPED POOR TABLE KUN LOL WTF OMG""."
CodeGeass,23tko4,megacookie,15,Thu Apr 24 05:27:58 2014 UTC,It makes sense to include it to show how into Euphie she was. It's character development that gives credibility to her ressurecting the 1st gen Knightmare frame and threatening to detonate her freiya basement prototype.

But it was kind of just thrown in there unexpectedly and feels kind of out of place. Though I'm not sure how you would make a masturbation scene, specifically a non-fanservice, slightly creepy one not stick out like a sore thumb."
CodeGeass,23tko4,megacookie,4,Thu Apr 24 16:36:17 2014 UTC,"Did it surprise me? Absolutely. But did it make sense? Yes, it showed how infatuated Nina was with Euphie. It was a jarring moment, revealing both a sexuality that Nina might have been uncomfortable with (conservative as she is), and demonstrating the sexual side of any love (or obsession) that IS a part of how love in real life functions.  More often than not, people get hung up on the table, or on the simple shock value of the scene, and don't appreciate wtf the creators were trying to tell us about Nina. If you look past the shock, you can see that it's a brilliant bit of character development.   I mean, it's what we do when we're alone that really defines what we are on the inside, right? Freaking contrast Lelouch when he lets his guard down (that freaking scene when he's sitting back to back with CC on the bed, or when he's at the docks with Kallen) with most scenes he's in. It's that small look into the minds and hearts of the characters that made the the supporting characters as loveable as the main ones. And this was Nina's character development. Shocking, jarring, controversial, but character development nonetheless. The fact that you can come out of a scene with a strong impression about the nature of the character speaks of character development. Should I say character development again?   Just my opinion though."

I was about to watch that (R2) and paused just before they show anything major... watched it all and webt to the the small clip and like 2 seconds later they showed the ending...

I had watched R1 and was browsing the wiki page (wikipedia, not the Code Geass wiki) looking at the episode summaries of the episodes I'd already watched without realizing yet that there was an R2. While they are clearly on separate pages now, I swear both seasons episode summaries were on the same page back then. Anyway, I scrolled too far down and read R2's episode 25 summary thinking it was R1. I was confused at first, then it dawned on me that I just spoiled something massive, reading that Spoiler Of course, after the revelation and cliffhanger ending of R1, the character dynamics of the two had me assuming that Spoiler Needless to say, I never predicted how it would actually unfold, and thus while I spoiled the ending for myself, I didn't ruin the experience and surprise at all."

What i mean is, the psychological / mental issues theme throughout made me question if anything was even really happening. I had lots of questions because so many things didnt make sense to me, or happened for no reason. Half the characters were mentally challenged or insane, it seemed. Plus it got repetetive for me. I was tolerating it up until the end, then I was disappointed.   In contrast, Code was pretty hard to believe sometimes but I always knew it was really happening. You questioned some of lelouchs choices along with the other characters and I also started to get disappointed.. But then when you make it all the way through the roller coaster of both series and realize that lelouch was even more of a genius than you thought, and everything you questioned was answered/revealed for you and the black knights...

It never explains the plot, the endings of it make literally zero sense, and everyone tries to give it this ""too deep for you"" feeling, even though the creator of the fucking thing hates when people try to read that deep into it.  The people that argued with me about it left a bad taste in my mouth and Evangelion is the only anime that I've ever watched that I absolutely despise and cannot understand how people like it. There's literally zero meaning or depth to it. The endings aren't really endings at all and leave more questions than answers. There is no deeper meaning to it. Gendo is just a shitty father, Shinji is just a pathetic pussy (regardless if we would all probably cry if our dads told us to get in a fucking robot and save the entire human race), none of the characters are really explored at all, and everyone is just as fucked up as everyone else. The whole ""psychological thriller"" part of it is pretty exaggerated and stupid. Yeah, everyone's messed up and wants to die, not really that psychologically meaningful.  I also dislike when people compare it to Code Geass because it isn't the same in any way. There's no legitimate comparisons you can make to any of the characters. Suzaku gets thrown into a Knightmare frame just like Shinji, but he doesn't whine about it. He uses it as an opportunity to try to change everyone from within.  I'm not upset at you for liking it, I just really don't like Evangelion."

It was also one of the first I watched, and compared to the majority of western programs, the depth of character and depth if story were incredible, even though the story culminated in a load of nonsensical craziness.   Though I still enjoyed it very much.  And yeah, I can't really compare NGE and CG either. Other than maybe the giant robots. That's about it. I just meant I liked them both a lot. But after a few days of recovery from the devastation of finishing CG (it was a crazy ride... Very emotional) I think I like CG much more than NGE. Doesn't mean I dislike NGE any more than I used to.

CodeGeass,23dlp0,MrSkittleScone,7,Fri Apr 18 18:57:53 2014 UTC,"I like the ambiguous ending best. It's a little far fetched to claim he MUST be alive. I certainly see a strong case. But you assume some things that can't be proven. For example:   even though it was God/the Subconsciousness of all humans who killed him, then Lelouch would still have to be considered to killer, otherwise Charles wouldn't have died   There's no way to know that God can't kill someone with a code. Since the origins of the code are a mystery, it's equally possible C's world just revoked his code/existence.    If Lelouch had actually died for real, then the Geass on Sneizel would disapear and the whole Zero Reqium plan wouldn't work.   It's also possible he was such an advanced Geass user his commands would be permanent.   Lelouch shows Nunally his memories after he is stabbed, this can only be done by a person with Code (which just activated as he got stabbed and is close to death). I refuse to believe that Nunnally was able to figure it all out just by touching his hand at the end, that would be soooo cheesy..   Cheesy or not it's possible. She's a smart girl with a strong connection to Lelouch. Perhaps simply his acceptance of the whole thing (rather than fighting or screaming) demonstrated to her that Lelouch had a plan similar to her own. I had a similar thought a few months ago and posted here asking for explanations. Link"
CodeGeass,23dlp0,Oareo,2,Fri Apr 18 19:47:17 2014 UTC,"The answer to this question is all about the philosical definition of god in Code Geass. In CG god is the definition of everything and everyone. It is a organism consisting of individuals souls (all dead and living humans). So god is just the soul of all the human beings, he is no like a person with his own intilligence. What happened was that Lelouch ordered all people who had ever lived to kill Charles. And since everything is connected as God in Code Geass then that means that the world had to eliminate Charles. But Lelouch would still be considered the killer, there is no other way Charles could ever die. I believe that there should always be 2 Codes, so it would have to transfer to Lelouch.  And yes i know that he ''asked'' God to kill them, but he can also give an order as a question."
CodeGeass,23dlp0,Silvadream,1 point,Fri Apr 18 20:02:39 2014 UTC,"And yes the thing about being able to permanently geass someone might be true, Charles is described as '' The perfect Geass user'' He has Geass in 2 eyes, yet he is still able to turn it on and off."
CodeGeass,23dlp0,Silvadream,1 point,Fri Apr 18 20:10:59 2014 UTC,"I agree that there is evidence for Lelouche being alive, Nunally seeing his memories for example, but your theory has some major holes in it. For example:   If Geass users can't talk to the dead, how did Charles speak to Clovis? Charles is able to talk to Clovis after he's dead in R1.    Lelouch tells Suzaku that Sneizel will continue to follow the orders of Zero/Suzaku (Because he geassed him to do so). If Lelouch had actually died for real, then the Geass on Sneizel would disapear and the whole Zero Reqium plan wouldn't work.   What evidence is there for Geass no longer working on the dead? There is that kid in R2 who controls a Black Knight until he's killed, but that's probably because he was completely controlling him. It's hard to manipulate someone's body when you're a pile of blood on the floor after all.   Orange is smiling and happy as he falls to the ground right before Lelouch is stabbed. I dont think he would be happy unless he knew that Lelouch would live on. Also keep in mind that Orange is probably the most Royal person to Lelouch, and he has a lot of knowledge about Geass and Code, so he might be the only one aware of Lelouch's plan ( Kallen and Suzaku know the plan aswell but not the part about Lelouch suriving ).   Jeremiah is an interesting character, and he does allow Suzaku to pass him in the last episode (that's also why he goes to deal with the interloper instead of having his men shoot them). I would be more shocked if he didn't know the plan. Still, I think Jeremiah would be happy to know that Lelouche did his duty and that the world is free (for the most part) of imperialism and war."

I think this might be how the lord of 1st realised that Charles was dead aswell).  But come to think of it there is a flaw that we both forgot. The Geass cast on Nunnaly ( I suppose they made her crippled by making her memories believe so ) should have disapeared when Charles obtained Code or atleast when he died.  Please keep in mind that i am not hoping for Lelouch to be alive, the other ending is better. But everything points towards the fact that he is still alive.  I will just look up the information about Geass disapearing when you die.   Would be happy if you could help out aswell :D"

I am in the middle of rewatching R2 though, so I'll keep you posted if it turns up.   Now that you mention it though, Nunally's being able to see at the last episode could have been good evidence of this. Although Lelouche was also able to remember Nunally and everything after reading about how his memory was erased, so it could be that Charles has a really weak Geass.   I still think the ending is ambiguous, and that depending on the interpretation Lelouche can be either dead (forever) or alive (forever)."

""assuming direct control"" is technically ""transfering your consciousness to another body"" so it's practically the same thing. it's not like you can geass-control someone else without your memory as a person being in your control when you're inhabiting another body.  the bit about Nunnally recovering her eyesight is psychological iirc. the only things she was ""geass-ed"" out of were the memories of her mother being assassinated.  the only person that's shown to have opposed geass successfully was a dying Euphemia.. probably because the parts of her brain that were re-wired started to power down.   other than this..

I think Jeremiah would be happy to know that Lelouche did his duty and that the world is free (for the most part) of imperialism and war.   Jeremiah's purpose was never to free the world from imperialism or war. he lived to serve the royal family and its survival would be the only thing making him happy.

Jeremiah's purpose was never to free the world from imperialism or war. he lived to serve the royal family and its survival would be the only thing making him happy.   I think you may be simplifying Jeremiah a little bit. I would also say he cared about Marianne and her children more than the royal family.

Transfering consciousness means you basically become something. You would have full control, but you would also have no means of escape without leaving the body.  The kid could manipulate the black knight without leaving his body. In other words, it's as if he's controlling him live a puppet. He does not become the black knight, and we can also see the black knight trying to resist and yelling that he can't help it.    Marianne and her children ARE the royal family.    No shit. I was differentiating between Lelouche and the rest of the royal family. Jeremiah isn't really torn up between choosing Lelouche and Schneizel for example.   Also, you contradict yourself:   he would never let Lelouch be killed without sacrificing himself first. i doubt Lelouch would've told Suzaku about his Code though. i'm fairly confident if there's anyone who'd unbury Lelouch it would've absolutely been Orange.   Why would Jeremiah let him pass if he knew he was going to die? He lets Lelouche die, knowing that Lelouche is bravely doing his duty and fixing the world. Jeremiah knows about this, and must let Lelouche be killed for the greater good. Jeremiah also orders his guards to retreat, even though they could have easily fought off all of the poorly armed revolutionaries, presumably so he can use his anti-geass on them to free them from slavehood.   Also, tell me that we won't stop being friends (or pseudo-friends) because of the argument that's going to continue."
CodeGeass,23dlp0,sinira,1 point,Fri Apr 18 22:17:46 2014 UTC,You missed the point. Jeremiah is loyal to Lelouch vi Brittania AKA he knows Lelouch will not die from being stabbed to death. Because of his involvement with the Geass research and VV nothing will surprise him if Lelouch told him about it. He would not let suzaku do it otherwise and greater good was never once his concern throughout the series.

They're not as good as attack on titan, and it doesn't even get close to code geass.

Now before you watch Elfen Lied, I'm going warn you that it is at least 5x more depressing than AoT. It's survivable but damn you're gonna need a hug afterward.  I would also recommend Detective Conan. (The subs because they stopped making dubs.) It's a very long series that is still going to this day, but fortunately they have 17 movies out which are really easy to get into and definitely not as time consuming. But if you want to watch the whole series have at it hoss. I think they are around 800 by now.  Also be aware the DTB also got a second season and 4 OVAs that took place in between.  Well, if you're looking to get into the less serious side and more on the happy side. I would recommend these:  SHUFFLE!  Strike Witches (very good show if you give it a chance)  Lucky Star (plug)  KissXSis ( The entire show is one big WTF but it's still hilarious.)  K_ON  Melancholy of Haruhi Suziyama"

The speed and brutality at which important characters die is, by far, my favorite thing about that show (actually the same exact reason why I enjoy watching starship troopers). I dislike heavy amounts of drama in my shows, and I really enjoy the depth of the world being described, as well as the strategic aspect of whatever the main characters might be doing. Combine that with my love for chess and you'll understand why code geass is, by far, my current favorite anime.  I'm currently three episodes into Elfen Lied, and I am finding all the characters rather obnoxious, and the sometimes terrible voice acting in the English dub is NOT helping. I'll probably give it another two episodes and then see if I want to keep going.  How the hell did I miss the second season of DTB? Then again, the end of the first season did feel like a good ending for it...  I'm not usually into upbeat animes, they're just a bit over the top for me. I hope that code geass' third season is going to start coming out with episodes a bit faster, at this rate I'll probable rewatch the entire damned thing this week."

CodeGeass,234sdy,LiamSkylar,3,Wed Apr 16 02:10:15 2014 UTC,"Even worse for us people following it at the time. There was a long time between episode 23 and 24/25 of R1, something in the order of half year to a year (can't remember of the top of my head, on mobile atm)."

Even with such cliffhangers, I still wish I could've watched it as it came out. I would have been so captivated by the whole thing. Although, nearing the end of R2 my life would literally be waiting for that next episode."
CodeGeass,234sdy,LiamSkylar,2,Wed Apr 16 14:26:51 2014 UTC,So many parts in this show give me chills. Its my favorite show for sure.
CodeGeass,234sdy,GlassesWarFair,1 point,Wed Apr 16 04:14:03 2014 UTC,I watched the dub of Code Geass and the final scene in R1 is probably one of most well-voice acted scenes I've seen in anime. Yuri Lowenthal and JYB nailed it.

CodeGeass,22q2ph,LOTO-12,3,Fri Apr 11 04:19:44 2014 UTC,"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, often shortened to Gurren Lagann or TTGL. It's a greatly entertaining over the top mecha anime that's really worth watching.   You know how there are shows that are considered a ""deconstruction"" of certain genre right? They take the stereotypes and tropes that are so popular in that genre and give it a dose of reality, turning it on its head and going against the grain.   Evangelion is considered a deconstruction of mecha anime because its teenage mecha pilot, world saving MC is actually depressed and cowardly and never really becomes the fearless shounen hero that is the norm for the genre. And the very idea of giant robots is shown to be rather cruel and terrifying, rather than glorified.   TTGL is the exact opposite of that. It takes everything that makes a mecha anime a mecha anime and cranks it up to 12. It gets so ridiculous it almost becomes a parody of the genre and itself, removing everything further from reality and into a much cooler world where anything is possible."

CodeGeass,22krgd,TheRagingInfant,5,Wed Apr 9 03:07:18 2014 UTC,The memories Nunnaly saw were good enough for me to believe Lelouch got the code and is alive. Good work!
CodeGeass,22krgd,ichi-kun,3,Wed Apr 9 07:33:45 2014 UTC,"Exactly. There could still be some bull explanation of how Nunnaly could always ""read"" a person's intentions by touch, but that was mostly just a way of identifying people while blind rather than any telepathic ability. And if she could truly look into Lelouch's mind of her own power, then she would have figured him out in any of the previous encounters they had. The flash of memories is way too detailed and vivid and is very similar to when C.C exposed her own memories via contact."
CodeGeass,22krgd,megacookie,1 point,Wed Apr 9 19:13:13 2014 UTC,Thanks.
CodeGeass,22krgd,TlMB0,5,Wed Apr 9 12:12:35 2014 UTC,"The absolute best evidence in support of this theory is Nunnally's vision when she touches Lelouch. The only time we have seen memories shown to other is when a Code owner shows them to someone. That moment would make no sense if Lelouch did not have a Code.   Also, Charles' Code was in his right palm, so when he grabs Lelouch by the neck before being erased by God, Lelouch is in direct contact with the Code. It could be that Charles forced it onto him (like the nun did to C.C.) as one last ""fuck you"", Lelouch knew how to transfer the Code and took it himself, or God transferred the Code to Lelouch while Charles was being erased. The Code had to go somewhere, right? I doubt a Code of freakin immortality would just be erased that easily. It had to go somewhere.   As for the cart scene, its my opinion that there would be no way C.C. would be that happy if Lelouch was truly dead.   Oh and while this is in no way evidence, I just think it's neat: C.C. goes by that name because it's her initials right? And we all know that in Japan there is no L sound, and the R sound is used in it's place. So Lelouch Lamperouge, if he had a Code, would go by his initials, L.L., or in Japanese, R.R.... as in R2... just like in the title. Checkmate nonbelievers!"

CodeGeass,22krgd,MrSkittleScone,1 point,Wed Apr 9 19:22:52 2014 UTC,Please do :)
CodeGeass,22krgd,themoondog,5,Wed Apr 9 19:59:44 2014 UTC,"There is no hard proof either way, but I think Lelouch is dead and continues to exist in C's world.  At the beginning of episode 6 we see Charles in C's world, and he says he that was just talking to Clovis who, by that time, was dead. Also, later in R2, Charles and Marianne talk about bringing Euphie back for Suzaku. I don't think they would have been so desperate as  to lie about being able to do that. So we know that people can continue to exist in C's world after they die.  We also know that C.C. has a connection to C's world. She's able to talk to Marianne because Marianne is technically dead and can freely move between C's world and Anya's body. So if C.C. can speak to Marianne, then it's not too much of a stretch to think that C.C. can speak to Lelouch after his death; hence we get that cart scene where C.C. seems happy.  As for how Nunnally reacts to Lelouch’s death, Nunnally is initially shocked, but when she touches Lelouch’s hand, she realizes that this person was the same brother who cared for her when she was blind. Of course she consciously realized that before, but she didn't really see him as her brother because ever since she regained her sight, she only saw him do tyrannical things. She is Lelouch’s sibling and, like Lelouch, she is very smart. She realizes that Lelouch could have made a plan like her own, except using himself as the focal point of everyone’s hatred, instead of the Damocles.  I prefer this theory, but I'd like to know what other people think."
CodeGeass,22krgd,Bigman61,2,Wed Apr 9 10:37:52 2014 UTC,"Another cool theory. Honestly, I'm beginning to understand why the writer left it for us to decide. Look at all the cool stuff we're coming up with! We wouldn't have any motivation for doing so with a clear cut ending. The best part about it is that all of the theories are possible."
CodeGeass,22krgd,redkiller4all,1 point,Thu Apr 10 00:33:57 2014 UTC,"The reason CC was able to speak to Marianne was because of Mariannes ability to cross into the mind of others. C's world is the subconsiousness of all human beings ( both Living and dead ) which is probably why Charles said that he just spoke to clovis. God is the barrier between C's world and the real world, but at the same time god is both if them, so by killing god he would change the existence of the world. That way suzaku would be able to talk to Ephy again since the two worlds would mere into one. It is complicated and you might want to watch it again. The main reason it is hard to understand/explain is because it is a philosophical way of Seeing the world.  If you watched FMA brotherhood then you might understand what i mean."
CodeGeass,22krgd,KidCrimson21,4,Fri Apr 18 12:35:57 2014 UTC,"I don't think Lelouch knew that he had obtained Charles' code. I think the Zero requiem is exactly what it was shown to be. It wasn't that Lelouch wanted to receive his code, he really just wanted to die as a scapegoat, in repentance for all the sins that he committed. I think that that's why the driver/Lelouch held his head down, he was depressed that he wasn't able to receive his punishment. It's quite ironic, when you think about it. It's like a double edged sword; he is granted eternal life, but at the cost of bearing the burden of his sins for all eternity. There's no way that he'll ever grant Geass to anyone either, because it is unnecessary since the war is over, and he doesn't want anyone to suffer the same fate he did. I believe C.C. will feel the same way, and they'll just stay together forever. I think that is what makes this ending so great. In the first episode, when C.C. is giving Lelouch the terms of the contact she says: ""The power of the king will condemn you to a life of solitude."" Because of the events that transpired, they won't be forced to live in solitude. They'll be together forever, in a world of peace."
CodeGeass,22krgd,Ryddin,1 point,Wed Apr 9 21:30:27 2014 UTC,"Awesome interpretation. I personally think that while Lelouch can live without power, he certainly doesn't mind it. He likes to think he's better than people. It's why IMO he plays chess. And this is one of the core values I was ruining if when I wrote my version of the theory."
CodeGeass,22krgd,Ryddin,2,Wed Apr 9 23:08:40 2014 UTC,"This is a pretty common theory and might actually have been confirmed. I honestly prefer it if he is dead, it has more meaning for me but I can argue for why he would be alive and what evidence there may be for it."

CodeGeass,20n5vs,Evildietz,1 point,Tue Mar 18 14:58:59 2014 UTC,"Well, we can't be really sure of that. Lelouch acted all surprised and shocked when it happened, but I think he subconsciously intended to do it. He hated Euphy for (while not meaning ill) undermining his plans, he knew the Black Knights were gonna fall apart. In a later Episode he admits to Suzaku that it wasn't an accident, and I can't imagine why he would lie at that point.  That episode though. When her eyes started glowing all i thought was oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit And when she asks Suzaku in the end if her idea worked out, and he tells her it was a big success... dem feels"
CodeGeass,20n5vs,ShadicNanaya510,3,Wed Apr 16 09:17:54 2014 UTC,"I thought that he lied to Suzaku because no matter how much he tried, he wouldn't be able to convince him otherwise. Suzaku saw him kill Euphy, and is too stubborn to convince him otherwise, but he needed his help so he ""honed"" up to his actions.   Again, my opinion."

He's way too proud for that and would rather face penance by being hated than coming up with excuses even if they were true. Besides, it would be worse it was known that Lelouch's terrible power of mind control was something he himself was no longer fully in control of (even if special contact lenses solved the ""always on"" problem)."

CodeGeass,1zdiij,Raging_Hemorrhoid,19,Mon Mar 3 18:08:05 2014 UTC,The ending is totally different in R2 than R1. You'll learn a lot more about each character you mentioned in the spoiler as it progresses. Lancelot becomes less and less of a trump card as large amounts of increasingly powerful knightmares are come into play.  Just finish it.
CodeGeass,1zdiij,heidurzo,11,Sun Mar 2 21:52:01 2014 UTC,"""The Lanzelot is here? Curses, foiled again!""   The lancelot is supposed to be a ""check"" blocking moves that lelouch makes just like in a game of chess.  It becomes a ""wall"" type piece that he has to remove from the board in order to progress.  As for Suzaku trying to change things from within, you'll see just how that unfolds and why he does it in R2, and how it juxtaposes lelouch's goal of destroying the world.  I personally rank Code Geass in my top two anime of all time. It sounds like you don't enjoy it though. I don't recommend you continue if you're starting to hate the series. It's just going to be pain to the end if your mind is already made up that you don't like it. Trust me I know from experience with watching One Piece.   Long story short I couldn't stand the stupidity of the main character and lack of tactical skills and analysis that I was spoiled with in anime like Code Geass.  I kept trying to force myself to get through one piece telling myself it would get better as the story and characters develop but it never did and I ended forming a hatred for it.  Occasionally I go back to it every few months to see how it's doing (the lore behind the story is decent) but it's not high on my priority list.  If you're not into it I'd say it's not the anime for you."

I just can't get behind how good everyone makes it out to be and I get really frustrated and aggravated with Luffy's and a few other people's actions.

As for the answer you weren't given, you'll be given them in R2. However, you'll probably have a few new ones after it. There are plot elements that aren't fully explored or are left ambiguous. I kinda just told myself to accept them and chalk it up to writing and time constraints, as the rest of the story overshadowed it, for me at least. You'll eventually learn why CC keeps saving Lelouch and has to keep coming to his aid. She eventually becomes referred to as ""His shield""  Feeling like season two basically discards season one is perfectly justified.  When I stared R2 after R1 I was confused as fuck. Nothing made sense.  It starts out slowly but picks up exponentially.  After a little bit that feeling of confusion and disregard fades away."

CodeGeass,1zdiij,Oareo,3,Wed Mar 5 15:04:06 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure what you expected posting on /r/codegeass, but I'm sure most people here like the show and would encourage you to finish it. Having high expectations of ANYTHING is bound to make you enjoy it less, though. I would also refrain from speculating about it too much until you've seen it all. My advice for consuming any media is to just experience it with as little hype and preconceptions as possible, and not to judge until the end.  I think the comment that prompted you to start the show is a bit off. There's a lot of facets to the show, planning/tactics is only one of them. However, that is what makes the show great IMO (especially when watching again). It's so many things blended together.  It certainly has a lot of anime tropes, as well, which can be hard to swallow if you aren't a fan of the genre. Suzaku is definitely idealistic to a fault, but no, you don't have to like him. The reset in R2 is a bit jarring, but it doesn't take long to get beyond the scope of R1. Personally I found the middle of R2 to be the weakest point in the whole series. If you can make it through the first half or so of R2 you should be good.   What animes DID you like? Personally I found CG is one of the few I've really enjoyed, enough for me to watch again. I lost interest in Death Note the second time around."

That's pretty much what I expected, I just wanted to see if others saw the same problems I did and if it got better or if they would recommend the show regardless.   What animes DID you like?   I enjoyed the first half of Death Note and I'm ashamed to say that I've watched and enjoyed all of Hikaru No Go... Both have their faults though, some of which may in fact be tropes of anime in general, as you say. (The melodramatic dialogue, forced cliffhangers, etc.) I don't want to say anime as a whole is flawed though, maybe I just haven't found the one that's perfect for me yet."
CodeGeass,1zdiij,kaidynamite,1 point,Mon Mar 3 21:27:01 2014 UTC,"Don't be ashamed of Hikaru No Go, Go is awesome. Totally agree on the first half of Death Note. However CG is not the same. Like I said in the previous post, the first half of R2 is a bit wonky, but it has a much more satisfying ending that Death Note. With the full scope in mind, watching it over makes the flaws not so bad.  Code Geass is my favorite anime, but it's not perfect. However I really would like to hear from you after you finish the show. Since you mentioned you were binging on it, hopefully we don't have to wait long. Seriously though you should make another post when that happens. Whether or not the full story changes your view of the show, I think we'd all like to know."

If you put it down for too long you may never come back. No matter what you think by the the end, having a complete picture of the show is critical to forming a well-informed opinion. CG is short and sweet, no reason not to finish. Hopefully we'll hear from you soon saying ""you guys were right..."""

But all of the annoying issues and cliffhangers from the end of R1 and the first few episodes of R2 get proper resolutions, you just need some patience. 2 episodes in to a 25 episode season isn't really enough to judge the series as a whole, even if it's the second season and you have lingering issues with the first."

CodeGeass,1zahl5,Lomop,20,Sat Mar 1 20:46:18 2014 UTC,"The supernatural power in the show Code Geass has two ""phases"", The Code, and the Geass.  The Geass is what comes first. It's what Rolo and Lelouch have. It's what CC has before the Nun betrays her. It is only obtained from a Code-bearer,  but we'll get to that later. The Geass also has ""phases"", which pass as the user uses their power more (Lelouch going from one eye active to two eyes active). Only when the Geass user has used their power extensively are they ready to obtain the ""Code"".  The Code, once obtained, changes the individual's powers and makes them immortal and indestructible (see CC and/or Charles for example). The individual obtains their Code from someone who already has the Code. The Code may or may not be acquired from the same person that gave the Geass. The original Code bearer may die from the process, or may just become mortal.  Only instance this is really explored is with CC and the Nun, and the Nun was so hateful of her immortality, it's hard to determine whether she committed suicide or whether the process itself killed her. Code phase may actually have two parts, the active and inactive (introduced with Lelouch's supposed acquisition of Charles Coe theory). A special feature of having the Code is that you can do memory dives/transfers/magic. See CC with Suzaku's Lancelot.  Alright, now to talk about Lelouch. The argument goes something like this:   Charles had Code (true), and this Code somehow transferred to Lelouch (brings up the question of whether both parties were willing, did Lelouch know, and introduces the possibility of the Code having both an active, and inactive, state).  Lelouch goes through Emperor phase as normal, with his Geass, while his Code (which he got from Charles) remains dormant. Lelouch plans his demise (unaware of inactive Code), and DIES at the hands of Suzaku This ACTIVATES his Code, destroys his Geass, and makes him the same thing as CC: indestructible and immortal. The part with Nunnally and the memories is a demonstration of Lelouch's newly found abilities with the Code to transfer/show/do memory magic. Now that Lelouch has ""died"", his Code is active, his Geass dead, and he runs off with CC.   I've already pointed out some of the flaws with this theory:   Does the original Code-bearer need to consent to the transfer? (contrast CC w/Nun and Lelouch w/Charles) Does the Code condition have two states, in which the first allows one to use Geass? (see Lelouch's Emperor phase following his supposed acquisition of the Code from Charles) Are the memory transfers voluntary, involuntary, or both? (contrast Nunnally seeing stuff from Lelouch with Suzaku seeing stuff from CC) Couldn't the ""memory"" flashback be seen as Nunnally using her ability to read from the hands to see into Lelouch's heart?   Here's what we know: The Code isn't activated until the individual dies. The video showing the cart driver smiling is fake. There's an interview in which one of the creators makes the point that Lelouch died/dies in the anime.   My personal opinion: CC on the cart. Her monologue, the presence of the pink crane, and CC's look upwards (towards front of carriage), combined with driver being completely covered (why would that be the case?) yells ""Lelouch lives"" in my mind."

I knew that CC got this ""curse"" after the nun died but I thought that the nun somehow cursed her intentionally, because she was kind of like a witch. :P  But now I understand. Was really depressed after I read some statements because I had no clue about what they were talking about. But thank you very very much. You helped me a lot! :)"
CodeGeass,1zahl5,wiithewalrus,6,Sat Mar 1 21:33:56 2014 UTC,"No problem, glad I could help! Now that you understand as much as the rest of us how the Code works, you get to the ultimate question: Is Lelouch dead, or alive? (notice the ""is he"" versus ""did he"" :P)  An old post that also does a good job of summarizing the points for the ending theory that you might enjoy:  http://www.reddit.com/r/CodeGeass/comments/17t3ig/code_geass_in_a_nutshell/"
CodeGeass,1zahl5,wiithewalrus,3,Sat Mar 1 21:37:18 2014 UTC,I would say that he is alive. Just based on the facts that are listed by the post that you linked. I got nothing to add there tbh :P  Just one question. How was CC able to kill the nun? I thought people with the Geass are unkillable? Or is the person who got the Geass from the Code bearer able to kill the Code bearer?
CodeGeass,1zahl5,wiithewalrus,4,Sat Mar 1 21:50:39 2014 UTC,"here's what happens with the Nun:  Nun, with Code. CC, with Geass.   Nun somehow transfers her Code to CC   Nun, Codeless, Geass-less. CC, inactive Code, with Geass   Nun kills CC   Nun, Codeless, Geass-less. CC, dead, activating Code, Geass-less   Nun somehow dies (whether becoming mortal made her weak or because she killed herself)   Nun, dead, Code-less, Geass-less. CC, alive, with Code, Geass-less  ~~~  CC doesn't kill the Nun, she loved her. The Nun either dies either because of suicide or because losing her Code caused her death.  A person with a Geass CAN be killed. These people are Mao, Lelouch, and Rolo.   A person with a Geass AND a dormant Code CAN be killed, BUT they come back to life immortal and indestructible at the cost of their Geass. This is only Lelouch, only after Charle's death.   A person with a Code CANNOT be killed in the normal manner. These people are CC, Charles, VV, and Lelouch (after his first death, which is what activates the Code)  ""Or is the person who got the Geass from the Code bearer able to kill the Code bearer""  That's unclear, just like a lot of things about the whole nature of the Code and the Geass. Makes for a good sequel/prequel, you know? ;)  yes, i'm waiting for the R3 announcement at the end of Akito, episode 3. Get at me"

Ive watched Death Note and Code Geass. (also Naruto, Pokemon, YuGiOh and One Piece while I grew up but both got cancelled in Germany for w/e reasons :P)"
CodeGeass,1zahl5,archlinuxrussian,1 point,Sat Mar 1 22:03:13 2014 UTC,"Depends on where you wanna go from there to be honest. I'm not entirely sure about availability in Germany, but these all have subtitles, as that's how I watched them.   Tried making lists. Incredibly hard to be all inclusive.    Really, it comes down to what you wanna watch yourself. Full Metal Alchemist and its remake in Brotherhood offer a good sampling of a lot of things, and acts as a good gateway anime to a lot.  If you want more slice of life/romance/modern, Maid-sama and Toradora (absolute favorite) are good places to start.  If you want anime to really make you cry, Clannad (and Clannad Afterstory) and Steins;Gate are good places to start.  In no particular order, the anime shows I've enjoyed:   Baccano! (1920-30s, awesome action/plot/characters) Steins;Gate (modern, awesome plot and characters, will make the tears flow) Clannad (and Clannad afterstory) (epitomy of tear-jerker) Blast of Tempest (secret mage society) Maid-Sama (slice of life, romance) Ergo Proxy (cyberpunk future) Neon Genesis Evangelion (a classic in anime) Cowboy Bebop (a classic in anime) Trigun (a classic in anime) Series Experimental Lain (a classic, confusing, complex, anime.) Akira (another classic, but a movie) Swords Arts Online (personal fav, others don't like the poor characters and the execution of the plot) Attack on Titan (everyone seems to love it, action, medieval world) Black Lagoon (a lot of action and violence, not much plot and character depth)   Final remarks about this:   As a general rule, if different anime shows are in the same universe, watch the series that came out first before watching the newer ones, even if it means watch the prequel after watching the ""main"" series.  Some animes don't follow the manga, and this may result in a new series being made (Full Metal Alchemist was remade in Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, which  was more accurate to manga). Again, watch the older ones first.  Some anime don't fully follow the manga. They may stop after an arc. Berserk is a classic anime AND manga, but the manga only follows the first Arc in the manga series.  Some anime adaptations just aren't up to par when compared to the manga. Rurouni Kenshin is a classic, but the manga is infinitely better than the original anime series was.    This youtuber puts some good reviews up about anime shows. May contain spoilers, but you can get a feel for whether or not to watch the anime off of the first few minutes:  https://www.youtube.com/user/GRArkada  His top 25 anime list has some good shows, but a lot of it is very much on the fringes and not mainstream or something introductory anime watchers would fully enjoy."

CodeGeass,1zahl5,archlinuxrussian,2,Sun Mar 2 13:55:50 2014 UTC,Since Lelouch got the code from someone other than the contract creator or the Geass giver he could have both code and Geass hence the name code geass.

CodeGeass,1zahl5,gambitfan,1 point,Thu Apr 3 17:39:12 2014 UTC,"I would like to address the flaws you pointed out.    The code bearer does not need to consent giving that V2 most likely did not consent for giving his to Charles for it would mean he is consenting to Charles betraying him. Charles still had his geass and was going to use it on Lelouch before he ""killed"" him the first time. From all the other incidents it is involuntary because CC did not want Lelouch to see the flashback and acted like touching her was going to cause it. The way she acted points out that she didn't want it to happen. I'm not even going address that because that is just a tall tale that was pulled out of thin air and there is no other cases in the anime of Nunnally having these ""super powers.""   Edit: Lelouch lives"
CodeGeass,1zahl5,wiithewalrus,1 point,Sun Mar 2 00:34:46 2014 UTC,"Thanks for this! I completely forgot about Charles getting it from V2 Your second point supports the active/inactive theory of the Code. That would mean that all contact led to a flashback? There must be some control over it, and a lack of control leads to the memories simply gushing out upon contact. Politely disagree, it isn't something pulled out of thin air; it is something that builds on Nunnally ability to read a person's emotions by holding their hands, which is entirely in the anime. Granted, it is a bit extreme for her to see so many precise details in Lelouch's case, but it isn't ""pulled out of thin air"".    Also, it wasn't portrayed as a superpower, sorry if I implied that; Nunnally just has the uncanny ability to read a person's emotions by holding their hands. I believe the episode where she demands control of the nukes illustrates this.  Edit: damn right he does :)"
CodeGeass,1zahl5,gambitfan,2,Sun Mar 2 03:18:54 2014 UTC,The flashback is only caused when that person is damaged/has a cut. And the emotion can easily be pointed to how a person talks and sounds. Reading a persons emotion by there voice and holding them is a lot different then seeing into there memory. (which if holding hands would allow her to see someones memory then she would of seen Lelouch's secret along time ago)
CodeGeass,1zahl5,Martlan,1 point,Sun Mar 2 03:25:00 2014 UTC,The Code isn't activated until the individual dies.   Could you clarify how is this so?
CodeGeass,1zahl5,wiithewalrus,1 point,Tue Apr 1 17:36:42 2014 UTC,"Hello, if I recall correctly, there are 2(3) incidents of a Code being transferred in the anime. CC and the Nun, Charles and VV, (Lelouch and Charles).  Again, if I recall correctly, the injury that CC has beneath her left breast, was done by the Nun after transferring the Code. There was a brief period of time where the Code was ""dormant"" inside of CC. Only when she ""died"" due to the injury does the Code activate. None of this happens on screen, but it's the assumption one has (ESPECIALLY if you're of the camp that Lelouch got his Code from Charles).  I don't recall the order of events with Charles and VV, but I'll try to outline them here:  We know Charles has a Geass at the beginning of R2 (end of R1). We know that Charles was the one to kill VV. Since we don't see it on camera, it is ASSUMED that Charles gets the Code from VV in some way before killing him. This reveals that a code can be transferred without consent (VV wouldn't want to die). VV's Code is now dormant inside of Charles, and when Lelouch kills him (in an attempt to save/remind CC), the Code activates and goes into the 2nd phase, and the individual (in this case, Charles) becomes a Code Bearer, and not a Geass Bearer with a dormant Code (difference between normal Geass bearer and one with a dormant Code is that the latter becomes immortal upon dying, whereas the former simply dies. Compare Lelouch's case with Mao, unless you don't believe Lelouch got the Code from Charles. In which case, CC's situation with Mao. She didn't die after the injury, but Mao did from the shot). This also brings up the question of a shot to the head being a possible way to kill a Code Bearer, but that's another unclear area.  It's a messy explanation, and it makes several assumptions, but I think it's what the majority of Code Geass fans believe. So much of the specifics of how a Code is transferred happens off screen (does it make the first person mortal or does it kill them, is consent needed or not, etc), that assumptions really are needed to try to understand them. I hope that answers your question?"

The only characters who stuck with Lelouch were Diethard, who defended Lelouch to the best of his abilities and only turned on him disgruntledly and Tamaki who is plain stupid and changes attitudes easily CC definitely was the moderator throughout the series with her dry sarcasm, and it was good to see her relationship with Lelouch grow in the second season as well as Lelouch's mental state rapidly deteriorate when she lost her memory"

Note that these are answers I came up with reflectively (except for the illness one, that one has a picture from the epilogue), and may or maybe not be right. They may not even match up with others (again, except for Xingke one, that's so backed up that it's practically canon)   Not sure. I'm assuming she became better and ""normal"", and that she's pretending to be related to Jeremiah so that they can move around together. Why she went with him, I don't know. Maybe because Anya needed a figure to protect her (now that she doesn't have her nightmare and she's discovering the world without her condition, and Jeremiah needed a person to protect) Earl of Pudding because of some disagreement/tension in a prior research team, race (to a discovery), or maybe even a social gaffe on Lloyd's part (engaged maybe?) Xingke's illness is never explained. It primarily serves to provide a sense of urgency to the story arc/episode in China, because he running on a much shorter fuse than he should be. Illness is fatal however (notice his absence from the wedding picture in the epilogue ;__;) Probably to denote that it's a personal thing between CC and Lelouch, and that you, as the viewer, are not necessarily entitled to all the more personal details, especially about an immortal being (a bit far-fetched, but the classic ""whole"" ending is cliche, ok) World of C? No idea. No fucking idea.   All perfect stuff to explore in spinoffs, continuations, prequels... wouldn't you say? ;)  yes i'm hoping for the R3 annoucement at the end of the fourth Akito the Exiled OVA.

What happened between Jeramiah and Anya exactly after he erased the Geass powers that had been tampering with her? She just goes back to thinking normally in a couple months after knowing what happened when she was 10 years old (Marianne's death) and everything afterward?   I'm not quite sure, it's possible that after Marianne died for real (ie when she disappeared along with Charles) that Anya may have had her memories of her disappear as her own returned to her. Not quite sure though.   Why does Rakshata call Lloyd the ""Earl of Pudding?"" What happened between them all those years ago?   This was probably never explicitly stated, but it's a fairly small thing to leave open without any real need for backstory. Lloyd and Rakshata do have history together as colleagues, and somehow pudding was involved. Probably because Lloyd always liked pudding. She probably calls him that as a pet/friendly name kind of like how Shirley calls Lelouch ""Lulu"".    What's up with Xingke and the blood he coughs up? What illness does he have? Does anyone know about it?   It was never mentioned what type of illness he has, but it's supposed to be something pretty much incurable and eventually fatal.    Why were we never told C-2(C.C.?)'s real name?   Because nobody knows C.C's real name and there is no mention of it anywhere (it was blanked out when she told it to Lelouch), she will be forever called C.C. The creators didn't want us to know her real name because we'd associate that name with her instead of the name that she grew to assume through immortality. Even if she had a real name, I'd like to think it died with her along with her past, mortal life when she was killed the very first time in the church with the nun. It's one of the things that are made much more memorable because it is completely open ended. Would we all particularly care about her real name if we knew it? Not really, it's the lack of an answer that makes the question stand out.   What is that other world that pops up occasionally?   That is the World of C, also referred to as the Gods of the Code Geass universe. What it really is is not actually a physical world (though it is depicted as looking like Jupiter), but a combined entity containing the unconsciousness of all humans living or dead, past, present, and future, and is the source of their individual identities and minds. Charles wanted to destroy the Gods because he believed that individual human identity is the source of all conflicts and destruction. Destroying the Gods would unite all of humanity's consciousness into one singular mind.     are there more people with codes like C-2 and V-2?   I have no idea and can't seem to find an answer. It could be likely, given the relatively high number of Geass users, including the children from the Geass Order, that there would be more than 2 code bearers but there was no mention. V.V probably gave Geass to all of the users in the Geass Order, while C.C gave it to Lelouch, Mao, and probably to the members of the Royal Family and Knights who have it. Because Codes grant immortality and only transfer of the code to a matured Geass user can kill the immortal, the number of Codes should always remain constant. Except for the fact that Charles, who took V.V's code, was absorbed by the World of C. While this does count as a kill and Lelouch's Geass did mature at that instant, it's unsure whether Lelouch retained his father's code or if it disappeared."

Other Codes - I forget which episode it was, but it was explaining the history of the Geass and the Codes, in which there was a ""tree"" of sorts (like a family tree) which showed many branches but eventually formed into only a few. My belief is that like how Charles attempted to absorb C2's Code, other Code's were absorbed throughout history by other Code bearers.   Alternatively, in the ""Geass vision"" (the one everyone sees when affected by C2's power) you can see many hundreds if not thousands of people who have the Code which you can see on their foreheads. It's possible they were killed by unknown means, probably from the (presumably nuclear) mushroom cloud and the zombie-like people wondering around."

CodeGeass,1xvjk2,gobinator,2,Sun Feb 16 09:06:01 2014 UTC,"I just thought of a possible English-friendly interpretation of the R1/R2 season titles. What if the R1 stands for Rebellion, as that is what spans the entirity of the first season. And R2 could be Revenge and Requiem, because while the rebellion does continue into the second season, the conclusion follows through with Lelouch's plot for revenge, and sees the conception and installment of the Zero Requiem in the finale. I'm not saying this is necessarily what the creators had in mind, but I think it's more interesting than trying to use the logic ""Lelouch Vi Britannia=Lelouch Lamperouge=L.L=R.R=R2"" to somehow confirm that Lelouch does indeed become an immortal."

CodeGeass,1xe6cu,Antonin__Dvorak,-11,Sun Feb 9 00:25:38 2014 UTC,"Take computers for example. Just about everything to do with networking, hacking, viruses, whatever on television is absolutely, laughably wrong. Going to wikipedia and learning the rules of chess is fine, but convincing the writers of a show to learn everything about networking from scratch isn't going to work. Hiring a consultant to bounce ideas off of is costly, while reddit is free.  Other communities work too, but Reddit has just about everything."
CodeGeass,1xe6cu,Oareo,13,Sun Feb 9 01:45:55 2014 UTC,"I agree, having accurate chess scenes is a wasted opportunity. If they weren't going to bother researching board positions, they shouldn't have shown the board.  However...  It's possible the rules of chess are different in the Code Geass world. There's plenty of chess variants here in our world, and Code Geass has 2000 years of alternate history to muck with chess even further.  Also, I never really liked the ""it's illegal to move your king into check"" rule in chess. Why should it be?  Because it's dumb? So are a lot of moves.  But the point of the bad/illegal move in the show is to gauge Zero's reaction. The game was ""over"" at that point since it was going to draw, which gives Schneizel nothing. He probably assumes both of them won't really get what they want if they win, but by using the game against him, he forces Zero to reveal something about himself."
CodeGeass,1xe6cu,Oareo,1 point,Sun Feb 9 04:45:27 2014 UTC,"It's possible the rules are different, but I'd think they'd make mention of that. Or just come up with their own game.   The surprise when he moves his king is a pretty big hint that the rules are the same.   Moving your king into check is illegal because it's the same as forfeiting. Forfeiting is done in a different manner."
CodeGeass,1xe6cu,megabeano,5,Sun Feb 9 06:53:27 2014 UTC,"I've always found checkmate to be very unsatisfying. I'm sacrificing all these guys to kill your King but we just stop short because we can see it's unavoidable. If players are really bad and/or playing fast you should be able to take the King directly. Checkmate should be a trap that is how good players usually end the game (when it doesn't draw...), but not the ONLY way to win. Same with check. We can call it that informally, but making it a rule is just enforcing a minimal level of logic on players, which is arbitrary.   If people got really good at chess would it be illegal to play a move that allows your opponent to checkmate you next turn? Tack another move until you've solved chess and suddenly the whole game is illegal.   I guess my point is that even if all the other rules of chess are the same, checkmate seems very arbitrary. They could easy have capturing the King be the end of the game. To me, since Lelouch (a chess master) considers capturing and says ""you hand me victory?"" instead of saying ""illegal move wtf"", the surprise move is a pretty big hint the rules are not the same."
CodeGeass,1xe6cu,Oareo,3,Sun Feb 9 07:49:41 2014 UTC,"I'm a chess enthusiast and I love checkmate (as opposed to capturing a king), it feels very satisfying to me.  Its utter victory, when you've won you don't need to take the king, he knows he is defeated.  If you're warring with rival humans and you kill someone important to them, you've created enemies for life.  If you show them their cause is hopeless and demonstrate they have no choice to surrender, they are much more effectively defeated.  If you destroy someone in a debate you need not brag nor declare victory, it's plain for all to see.  Those with true power don't need to flaunt it.  Btw, in blitz chess tournaments many do play that if you move into check the opponent can just take your king so you can try that out if you prefer"
CodeGeass,1xe6cu,Lark_vi_Britannia,1 point,Sun Feb 9 11:53:51 2014 UTC,"It's not illegal to put yourself in a bad position, but that begs the question of why you're playing the game at all. Being a bad opponent on purpose is just as rude as breaking the established rules.  If we're to assume the rules are different, I'm just as annoyed. They gave no impression that the rules have changed, and I'd honestly rather them use their own game if they're going to walk over such a globally popular one.  With that said, I see more evidence of the writers' lack of Chess knowledge than a change in the rules. When I'm playing, it's possible for me to be in a bad position, but I'd probably slap myself if I ever unknowingly lost a piece. The surprise at losing a piece in a single move tells me the writers didn't put much thought into the actual games at all. They just thought, ""smart strategists play Chess, so let's put in Chess!""  I could be wrong though. If questioned, the writers would just say they planned it all. :P"
CodeGeass,1xe6cu,megacookie,2,Sun Feb 9 08:17:38 2014 UTC,"What I mean is, since there is no randomness in chess, if you were super smart, a lot more moves would appear just as foolish as putting your King in check, and thus by the same logic could be made ""illegal.""   I think a game like Stratego would have been better, since players don't have perfect information and there's still ranks for the ""king must lead"" metaphor. Go is a more complex/strategic game with plenty of metaphors, but the pieces are all the same and it probably felt too ""asian"" for Britannia.  I think many movies/shows simplify a game down to one ""amazing/terrible move"" because it's easier/more dramatic. Same thing happened in A Beautiful Mind (a movie about game theory and set in the real world) with Go. Anyone who knows Go has their suspended disbelief shattered.  I sympathize with that feeling, but honestly the show isn't that realistic. Knightmares, the Code, Geass...etc. I'm sure a physicist would tear apart the Knightmares and Slash Harkens. Even if you grant the existence of Sakuradite, CG has a lot of ""anime physics"" and other tropes that can break immersion if you think about them too much. But it's important not to miss the forest for the trees, and just go with the overall intention of the scene.  In general, I totally agree with you, but choose to keep the integrity of the show intact and ""forget"" most of what I know about chess. If it bothers you even if the rules are different, there isn't much else to defend the writers."

CodeGeass,1xe6cu,Oareo,4,Sun Feb 9 04:35:29 2014 UTC,"Here's the thing, I know that Code Geass fudge's the rules a little bit, but that was someone the point. Schneizel puts his king into check on purpose, if Zero takes, then Schneizel loses right there, even if it was an ""illegal"" move.  He does this because he was testing out Zero's character, he was willing to lose on a whim just to see if Zero would call him out on the illegal move and win the game, or if he would play on in order to win in a more ""noble"" fashion"
CodeGeass,1xe6cu,XetoFighting,1 point,Sun Feb 9 08:20:58 2014 UTC,"This is possible, but very unlikely. If it were the case, Zero's internal monologue would have been much different. The chess board wouldn't have changed dramatically for no reason half-way through the game, and the spectator reaction would have been much different.   Schneizel definitely used the move to test Zero, but there's no evidence that he knew the move was illegal.   Considering how many other times the writers completely botched the game, it's less of a stretch to believe they made yet another mistake rather than to believe there was some deeper meaning. Especially when there were so many ways to show the viewer whether it was purposefully illegal."
CodeGeass,1xe6cu,Lark_vi_Britannia,3,Sun Feb 9 10:59:19 2014 UTC,"I don't understand this idea that Schneizel didn't ""know"" it was an illegal move.   He's never properly lost to Lelouch, and Lelouch is a chess master. Are you trying to say a master of the game, who was raised to play it, doesn't understand the rules? That's just as illogical as the chess itself. We have to accept what we see in the show. Since the rules aren't explicit, it's a lot more likely they are different than a grand master doesn't understand the rules.  Of course I'm ""covering"" for the writers and warping the reality to fit their laziness, but again, canon is canon."

Instead, anime just portrays a bunch of characters saying, ""he's so intelligent!"" and the writers call it a day.  Luckily, this was the only truly aggravating thing about Code Geass. The writers did a fairly good job of making the battle plans and strategies seem creative."

CodeGeass,1xe6cu,UnorthodoxParadox,4,Sun Feb 9 03:40:37 2014 UTC,"Seriously, though, in regards to the picture I posted, Schneizel does the ""illegal"" move to see if Lelouch would take the easy victory (A Charles zi Britannia move). If Lelouch complained that it was an illegal move, it would bring up ""rules of war"". And since Lelouch moved back, Schneizel figured out that Lelouch wouldn't take an easy victory, which means Schneizel learned how Lelouch does things, so in the future, Schneizel had a basic idea of how he operated.  This is always how I saw it, and this is how it makes sense to me."
CodeGeass,1x3lp6,Silvadream,14,Wed Feb 5 17:53:23 2014 UTC,"I agree it doesn't have to be ""total world peace forever"" to have any benefit/meaning.

CodeGeass,1wyhi6,Implieslol,13,Tue Feb 4 04:10:03 2014 UTC,"From the wiki: ""Aside from Lelouch, Suzaku and C.C., several other key characters knew about Zero Requiem, including Jeremiah Gottwald, Lloyd Asplund, Cécile Croomy, Sayoko Shinozaki and Nina Einstein, while others such as Nunnally, Kallen, the core Black Knights members and Cornelia only realized it during and after his execution."""
CodeGeass,1wyhi6,Dynore,5,Tue Feb 4 09:44:53 2014 UTC,The whole point of the zero requiem was to have no one understand his true intentions.

CodeGeass,1wyhi6,sean151,2,Tue Feb 4 06:20:37 2014 UTC,"Nina knew for sure. That was directly alluded to when Lelouch spoke of how she was so amazing for setting aside her hatred of Zero for a greater good/greater future.  Cornelia appeared to understand at the end, much like Kallen.  While it was never directly stated, I would strongly suspect that Lloyd and Cecile knew. Otherwise, they would have little motivation to follow Lelouch's orders through to the very end.  Other than that, the whole point of the Zero Requiem was to create a universally hated figure to unite the world. A figure cannot be universally hated if many know of his true intentions. Lelouch wanted to go down as the most hated person in the world. He saw that as part of his penance for all of the terrible things he had done. He was satisfied in the knowledge that, in the end, he succeeded in creating a better world for Nunnally."
CodeGeass,1wyhi6,AtheismIRC,4,Sat Feb 8 17:24:02 2014 UTC,I cannot recall anyone else. I actually don't believe Jeremiah knew the full plan. He was just told to let zero pass. He could of came to a conclusion though just like Kallen. I think you have everyone (besides CC and Suzaku). Lelouch couldn't let this plan out cause all it takes is for one little slip up and his whole plan will fall apart.

CodeGeass,1vykeq,OtakuMecha,2,Thu Jan 23 23:51:32 2014 UTC,The anime legend collections are DVD sets with every episode on them. There is one for Season 1 and one for R2. I know the Season 1 set has dubbed picture dramas. Not sure about R2.

CodeGeass,1vuqml,megacookie,7,Wed Jan 22 16:30:47 2014 UTC,"I feel that there are more things pointing to Lelouch being alive than permanently dead. It's just that they decided to leave it ambiguous with no official verdict, but him being dead raises more questions and potential holes in the story."
CodeGeass,1vuqml,watereol,3,Wed Jan 22 19:57:10 2014 UTC,"The only other reason I could think of is if Nunnally has some ""power"" that makes her super receptive to everything to compensate for her lack of vision (this does happen IRL, but nowhere close to her case.)   Wasn't there a scene in R1 where she touches Suzaku's hand for a brief few seconds, and then realizes it's him despite not seeing him for like 8 years?"
CodeGeass,1vuqml,TheIntellectional,1 point,Thu Jan 23 00:27:38 2014 UTC,"True, in episode 6 of R1 she recognized him, but it's when he touches her hand (she says ""This hand!""). She doesn't appear to learn anything else from the contact, such as what happened in Shinjuku with Lelouch or his ""date"" with Euphy. Also, she is surprised to learn he's at the school and asks about him in the military."
CodeGeass,1vuqml,TheIntellectional,3,Thu Jan 23 11:25:07 2014 UTC,"If it was a Code, wouldn't she know about that too? Why does she cry over him and beg him to open his eyes? Suzaku too. He knew about Zero Requiem, which means he almost certainly would have known about Lelouch's immortality if that were the case, but he sheds some tears of his own and Lelouch gives him a little speech about being alone.  I think the images are just used to show that she's realizing the truth of her brother's actions. Most of the show's most brilliant minds come from the Britannian Royal Family. I don't think it's too much a stretch for her to figure it out on her own if Lelouch can predict an entire conversation accurately enough to carry it out through a prerecorded video. Twice."
CodeGeass,1vuqml,Ar-Curunir,4,Thu Jan 30 22:02:10 2014 UTC,"I don't think there's anything to suggest the Code is a complete transfer of all memories no matter what. CC is able to give Suzaku a ""shock image"" and although she can't control exactly what he sees, she certainly prevents him from accessing all her memories (since she knows Zero's true identity). It's plausible Lelouch can control what Nunally sees because of the direct contact. So she might not know about every detail.  I hadn't considered Nunally's intelligence. It isn't really explored in the show, but you are right, she certainly has the potential (genetics, education) to be smart and figure out her brothers plan, especially since it wasn't all that different from her plan.  However, she doesn't cry when he's first stabbed and falls down the ramp. She touches his hand, gives a surprised expression, then we see a short montage of the Zero Requiem. She can't believe it at first, saying ""No...everything you did until was..."" and THEN exclaims that she loves him. To me, it's not an ""aha! i've got it!"" moment, but more of a ""oh, really?"" moment."
CodeGeass,1vuqml,BillyrayTrey,3,Fri Jan 31 17:02:05 2014 UTC,"Remember that one adviser who was trying to bypass Nunnally and use the power of the Viceroy's office on her own? She tried to say she wouldn't harm the elevens, but Nunnally touches her hand and immediately knows she has bad intentions. Maybe she doesn't react at first because she needs to touch his hand to learn about his good intentions? I don't think it needs to be an ""aha!"" moment. She can figure something out logically and then have an emotional reaction to it. Not everyone's cold and calculating like Lelouch and Schneizel. :P  I don't think it could have been a memory transfer technique like C.C.'s because she did that willingly. After going back and looking at the ending again I noticed that Lelouch even talks about dying in his own internal monologue just before it happens, so not only do Suzaku and the others not know after all, if Lelouch has a Code then not even he himself knows about it. This means that he wouldn't be able to use any Code powers that require a conscious effort.  There's also the problem that we never actually see a Code mark on Lelouch. He doesn't have anything on his hand (like his father), his forehead (like all the other immortals), or on his neck (where Charles grabbed him before he died)."

CodeGeass,1vtr23,watereol,5,Wed Jan 22 04:26:59 2014 UTC,When CC brought Marianne and Suzaku with her to the Sword she probably repaired the connection between the two spots.

CodeGeass,1virsu,LaPXL8R,12,Sat Jan 18 13:24:44 2014 UTC,"Lelouch took on a habit of blaming himself for a whole bunch of shit that went down against his will as if it were totally his intention, it made him/Zero appear more powerful but also more ruthless and villainous. Besides, the last thing he wanted to do was not only reveal the extent of his Geass power, but also that he had lost mental control over it, because then the Black Knights would drop him in an instant (they do anyways, but only after Schneizel has a little chat with them). Also he ended up needing to burn some bridges and break hearts when he enacted the Zero Requiem, so maybe playing the role of bad guy was part of his plans even then."
CodeGeass,1virsu,megacookie,6,Sat Jan 18 14:11:35 2014 UTC,"This is basically what I figured. It annoyed me that, when he told Suzaku that he was responsible for what happened to Euphie, he didn't even say it was an accident. However, once it was revealed exactly what the Zero Requiem was, I realized that Lelouch wasn't just acting as a scapegoat. He was taking responsibility for everything, because someone had to. It wasn't just an illusion to him; he needed to believe it as much as everyone else."
CodeGeass,1virsu,haircut74,2,Sat Jan 18 15:30:52 2014 UTC,"Ah, I now agree.  BTW, what's with all the people denying that Lelouch is dead?  EDIT: ^ NVM that, I started reading this subreddit.  I really wanted to believe that he was dead.  But it all made sense to me after reanalyzing the ending. Lelouch is immortal, but does make him living?  After re-watching the ending, I am convinced that Lelouch is immortal. Why was CC crying for Lelouch?. After all, she herself, wants to die, so why is she pitying Lelouch? Because he is immortal. This also supports the idea that Lelouch was the driver here.  The reason that I was reluctant to believe Lelouch was alive was that it defeats the purpose of the ending. His death was meant to be the punishment for all the evil in the world. His demise allows for a non-violent world, and if he were still alive, it would all be a façade.  However, Lelouch's actions had caused the sacrifice of millions. Would his mere death be a worthy reparation? I think not. Therefore, he has to be immortal, and quietly suffer in silence.  So yeah, happy ending. :D"

CodeGeass,1virsu,haircut74,2,Sun Jan 19 22:29:06 2014 UTC,"I'm still not sure whether I think he's alive or not. Either way, I believe what I said about Lelouch taking responsibility for everything. Out of curiosity, where do you think he got immortality? Since the only way we know for sure someone can take another's code is by killing that person, I'm thinking Lelouch would have had to take Charles' code, as CC is obviously still alive."
CodeGeass,1virsu,RyanLedford90,3,Sun Jan 19 05:34:00 2014 UTC,"The consensus is that Lelouch did get the Code from Charles. That's why he stopped Suzaku from intervening when Charles attempted to strangle him. I am also a bit confused, as I thought (maybe wrongly) that you lose Geass when you obtain the Code. However, I think that the evidence outweighs the flaws (personal opinion).  And you are right. It doesn't matter whether or not he is dead. He, the holder of the blame, is gone. That's all that matters."
CodeGeass,1virsu,haircut74,2,Mon Jan 20 00:00:14 2014 UTC,I figured he kept his Geass cause it was Charles' code and not C2s. If he had taken C2s code it would of dissapered.

CodeGeass,1uofwk,jnde011,2,Thu Jan 9 00:50:20 2014 UTC,There is a whole theory saying how he took the code from his father and explaining in very strong detail on what proved that he had the code. One big one being his sister seeing all his thoughts when she touched him.

He also died as in he is now just a person who has to watch. He can never show his face again. He may only stay in the side lines and wait.

CodeGeass,1uabq6,heidurzo,3,Fri Jan 3 23:12:06 2014 UTC,"No he didn't. Geass is not something you can just create for yourself, it requires a contract with an immortal. The geass on Suzaku was simply a standing order to live which, when activated, forced him to use his all to live.  Suzaku eventually turns it into ""his own"" by changing how he views battles. At the beginning Suzaku simply follows orders and does what he is told, unless that puts innocents at risk. He viewed his battles as a rather passive uninvolved thing where what will happen would. After certain events in R2 he stops viewing battles as just something which happens around him to see it for what they are, fights for life. This activates his geass letting him fight to his full potential.  Basically he starts caring that he lives to see the future, so every single conflict appears life and death."

I'm not sure because I haven't watched English version, but I think ""C's room"" sounds forcibly translated (perhaps I'm wrong about this one; I'll look into it later). All those peoples are unknown to us.   All these questions can lead to spin-offs or off-shoots for more stories, thus more money.  EDIT: Oh, this is interesting. So I didn't quite understand ""シーの世界"" which means C's world, where シー means C, の means of, 世界 means world. I thought that シー was out of some obsolete Japanese kanji.  I previously thought that they were saying しん, which can lead to a lot of variations in meaning in kanji, but narrowing down the relevance of the Ragnarok, it could be: the true, the mind, or the new world."

I don't think the people in the photo have the code. I always thought that they worshipped those who do have the code and had the code tattooed to symbolise this, it also explains the other identical markings on them that neither C2 or V2 have. They are immortals with god-like powers, it doesn't seem too impossible for a church of geass to have sprung up at some point."
CodeGeass,1u0f8f,SaiaiNinja,1 point,Wed Jan 1 01:40:26 2014 UTC,"-We never learn her true name.  (skipping the second question for a moment)  -As for the picture, I think it shows the people in the theoretical ""world of C"" which may have existed before in the past.  Since Charles' ideology is based in the past, Schneizel's in the present and Lelouch's in the future, Charles' is the only one that involves Geass, and seeing as the picture is from a flashback, the theory has at least some legitimacy.  -Back to question 2!  Considering that the world of C might have existed prior to the time period that the show runs for, the people might have been servants of the rulers of that world.  I doubt that Charles would've given up the power to rule when he would recreate the world of C.  As for the origins of Geass, my guess would be that someone powerful (maybe the ""king and/or queen"" of the world) locked away the Code for the world of C within themselves, leading the predecessors of V.V. and C.C.  As for why it's called C's room or the world of C, I think something about consciousness was mentioned, otherwise another guess could be C for Creation."

That was the whole way she was shown, she always cared for Lelouch/Lulu but he didn't want to involve her... After the first time when she learns of zero and lelouch. Lelouch realize he could no longer be lulu, he could only be zero. Lelouch did all he could to keep her protected and away from zero... but no matter how hard he tried she died in his hands by his own pawn.   Each time I watch this show, out of the 4 main parts that effect me, shirley is in two of those. It is the breaking of love. Lelouch had to sides in this anime (maybe three), zero and Lulu (you could said normal lelouch is one). Shirley was to Lulu as C.C was to Zero.   (sorry for the long, not organized, and bad Grammer)"
CodeGeass,1txbpz,redkiller4all,4,Sun Dec 29 13:44:28 2013 UTC,"So in short: Lulu ""died"" with Shirley?"

While it may be possible for Shirley to overlook these parts of Lelouch's life, Lelouch is clearly not okay with dragging his student friends into his crusade.  Also, hammering the final nail into the Shirley/Lelouch ship's coffin for me are Lelouch's massive trust issues. Of the four people he seems to trust with his life (C.C., Suzaku, Kallen and Jeremiah) there is only one he consistently and honestly shares his true feelings with, and even then, they all had to claw their way into him accepting them."

CodeGeass,1txbpz,WoolyCaterpillar,2,Fri Jan 10 21:41:29 2014 UTC,Honestly i think Lelouch in normal circumstances had the best chance of being happy with Shirley than with either Kallen or CC.
CodeGeass,1txbpz,SilverSomething,0,Fri Jan 17 06:59:08 2014 UTC,She had to die. Lelouch couldn't afford having a gf with the goal he set for himself. Perhaps his determination was what made him so attractive.

CodeGeass,1tna2u,KayanRider,1 point,Thu Dec 26 04:47:48 2013 UTC,"The way it would be done, i imagen, is to have four factions. (five if including Australia) One the EU, one the Chinese Confederation of Nations, the Empire of Britannia, and the terroist faction to even the odds. China and the EU are just about equal since China is bigger but the EU has better resause depos, clima and no big earthquakes(real world) So with those two equal the Empire need to geet down to  their strength since the Empire is MUCH bigger and stronger, so that's where the terroist faction steps in. (Zero) The Terroist faction objective is to prevent Brittania in just annexing China and the EU. The rules for Zero could be like the ""All terrist must DIE"" game where you can either be an empire or terroist. The way the EU would win would be if they got the entire europe and africa. (maps show that Brittania has parts of Spain/Portugal, Finland and Polen.) The Chinese win objective is to take the middle east, asia and the indonesian islands. (Together the EU and China would have to push Brittania of the continents) ((An additional thing that would spice the game up would be a victory goal to beat the other nation EU <--> China and then subjigateing to the Brittanias, that way the EU and China aren't automatic friends!!)) Brittanias objective is rather easy, kill every one else, or make them subjugate to your rule. (China in R2) ((or as mentioned before, a trick would be if Brittania promised one nation that an offer to win though that vitory goal, but after the EU/China betray the other one for brittania, brittania could go back on  promise)) The Terroist faction could be a multible amount of objectives; Support the EU and China in achiveing their objective. Having enough spys/rebel cells/assasins/agents/soldies in enough kay locations within Brittania that the terroists could perform a coup. Outright coungureing brittania. (the world if they want) One could even put in a victory goal to giving up. (TAKE THAT YOU TRAITORIES BLACK KNIGHTS!) Endless potential and many ways to betray each others could be great fun. (I play backstapper when i play risk, so yeah...) The balanceing would be REALLY HARD so maybe a pc game would be better... it could be updated and whatnot. If it was made as a pc game it could get behind the copyright clause as a fanmade game (those aren't illieagle, as long as money aren't claimed upfront when downloading the game) But to do this the game would relly on comercials and donations. And it would also be forced to be a browser game. Oh well, that's what it takes to (leagaly) make such a game. This idea has been inspired by RISK and All terroists must die.

CodeGeass,1td1tn,watereol,3,Sat Dec 21 00:06:44 2013 UTC,"As much as I love code geass and its entirety, there are a few problems in it that are from the change in the timeslot. I really want to see the original script. I honestly wouldn't mind seeing the director rehash or maybe did what evangelion and madoka with their movies. What do you guys think? I honestly want to talk to the creator about this and convince him.  P.S.  Code geass is still my number 1 show."
CodeGeass,1td1tn,Triskaidekaphobia_,1 point,Mon Dec 23 01:44:48 2013 UTC,"Little late here, but absolutely.  Part of the reason there was such a long delay between R1 and 2 was due to this shift in timeslot.  It was due to the timeslot change that they made the first dozen or so episodes a reset of season 1.  By wiping everyone's memory and returning them to the states at which they began R1, they essentially redid the first season in the first dozen episodes of R2 so as to make the show more comprehensible to their new audience who had likely not seen R1.  They essentially did what Evil Dead 2 did to the first movie, which is roll up the general idea of the first season/movie into about half the time and then continue where the plot of the first left off for the second half.  Also, they hugely toned down the maturity of the show in R2.  Drug addiction, genocide, nudity, and the gallons of blood present in R1 were toned way down in R2 in order to comply with the earlier timeslot.  The demographics of the earlier timeslot were younger than those of R1's late night timeslot.  To better appeal to the younger crowd, they made R2 much, much more similar to Gundam, Sunrise's other major mecha series--a show already very popular among the new target demographic.  So basically, you're absolutely right.  R2 was completely (re)written by the change in timeslot.  TL;DR:  Changes: -Gundamization -Less serious themes -Reset button plot between R1 & R2"
CodeGeass,1tdbme,RealNerdLewis,4,Sat Dec 21 02:22:42 2013 UTC,"I guess the Gawain could win as long as it's able to cut the umbilical cord and fly as high as possible until the Eva runs out of power. Evas are fast and durable as shit, the only weakness is the power supply really. Otherwise the Unit 00 will destroy the Gawain with a flick of it's AT field. I give it to Unit 00 8/10 times.   As for being better, I would say that I would rather be in the Gawain because you don't feel any pain when it's damaged and because you're not totally fucked if you lose control of it.

CodeGeass,1tdbme,BretticusWins,1 point,Sat Dec 21 13:48:10 2013 UTC,"I'd like to add my two cents here. I believe we can look at the tech differences of the two shows by analyzing their ""super weapons"". The positron cannon used to destroy Ramiel took power from all of Japan to fire. However, later in CG we see an extremely powerful Hadron Cannon, which is fired with relative ease, despite Hadrons being extremely more massive. Keep that in mind."
CodeGeass,1tdbme,HelpImOnRedditAgain,-1,Mon Feb 3 08:14:03 2014 UTC,"I think the Gawain would tear and eva apart. The evas honestly just are not built to the fighting standard that Knightmares are. This isn't even taking into account the superior fire power of such an advanced Knightmare. 10 slash harkens, two shoulder mounted hadron cannons, a float system and the ability to predict enemy movements. An eva doesn't stand a chance against the Gawain."
CodeGeass,1tdbme,arthur463,7,Sat Dec 21 02:53:11 2013 UTC,"Evas were used for one specific type of enemy, Angels. They have AT fields which render any physical attack ineffective unless countered somehow by an opposing AT field, such as from an Eva. I believe this may be a crucial advantage of an Eva unit, if they can generate an AT field to protect themselves then even something like a Gawain would just be wasting its ammo. I don't know how it compares to Blaze Luminous based energy shields (which can be pierced given a strong and persistent enough attack), and if a Hadron Cannon blast can break through then an Eva would be in trouble. The only energy based ranged attack of similar magnitude that an Eva could produce would be that electric sniper cannon thing Unit 01 used against the blue cube shaped Angel, and that is a stationary weapon that takes an entire city's worth of electricity and has a long recharge time. Plus KMF's don't run out of power after 5 minutes, have emotionally unstable 14 year olds with tendencies to break down under pressure as pilots, or run the risk of going berserk. But the final thing to consider is the scale, which may actually be really important. According to the wiki, the Gawain is much larger than other KMFs and stands 6.57m tall weighing 14.57 tonnes. Info on the Eva is harder to come by, but one site suggests 50.32m tall and 12494.67 tonnes. Simply put, if an Eva stepped on Gawain, it would flatten it."
CodeGeass,1tdbme,megacookie,1 point,Sat Dec 21 04:48:26 2013 UTC,I thought I read that Eva's were 100meters tall if you take into account the shoulder armor/weapon holsters. I picture the fight being more like swatting an insect...until the at field anialates the  kmf.
CodeGeass,1tdbme,Voxous,2,Tue Jan 14 05:44:57 2014 UTC,"Please, an Eva is like 20x higher than a Knightmare, also its not made of metal because its mostly organic but its actually alot sturdier than the armor of a Knightmare. Its really not a competition, it's like swatting flies and even if you exclude the fact that the AT field exists which could just blow up the mechas in an instant, if the knightmare gets caught its over"
CodeGeass,1tdbme,mrRuffles,1 point,Fri Jan 3 04:28:55 2014 UTC,"Assuming he strongest weapon used(fleja, I know I spelled it wrong) is based on a nuclear reaction of some sort, it would not damage the Eva's critically as we see what happens to he angel with the n2 mines detonated on it and the other angels with similar weapons used against them. This should mean that there is almost literally no chance at all for the kmf to win."

The amount of symbolism harking back to WWII is incredible. One of the terrorists has a star of David symbol on his coat and the part about the 'ghetto' is a clear parallel to the Nazi regime in Europe. From this I noticed that during the intro the map is similar to the US approach towards Japan during the 'island hopping' campaign. Also the Knightmares are akin to the atomic bomb in the sense of a revolutionary new weapon.  Perhaps Code Geass is some sort of Japanese re-interpretation of WWII if they had lost. Or even maybe a future prediction.   I'm not sure what the creators are really getting at. The hypocrisy of the Allied winners? Japan's contemporary relationship with the US? Either way, as a history student I'm loving this.   Maybe I'm completely wrong but I picked up on the symbolism quite early and my theories have snowballed on from there. Not sure if this is what you are looking for OP but these are the views of a newcomer!"

CodeGeass,1t8v8y,Triskaidekaphobia_,5,Fri Dec 20 15:01:37 2013 UTC,"This is one of my theories for code geass for its many meanings.  Suzaku, though having the same goal as Lelouch, is the opposite on how he approaches change. He in my mind represent the classic hero, as he is absurdly strong, wants to change things from within. His battles with Lelouch in a way are a clash of ideology. One thing that I think the director hinted well is suzaku’s past and how he Spoiler. I think code geass is commenting on these seemingly hero characters in history and that everyone has done something wrong and questionable. No one is absolutely pure. An example of this is Abraham Lincoln in the movie as it is shown that though he is revered as ""honest"" abe and was a great president, he wasn't as pure as he actually was. Abraham basically bribed the senators to pass the 13th amendment. Did it justify the ends? Yes, but it is not as glorious as people think. Suzaku represent this and in a way the creator notes his flaws."
CodeGeass,1t8v8y,ReoRak,4,Fri Dec 20 06:14:47 2013 UTC,"I know that I'm late in noticing this thread, but I felt the need to share my current favourite Code Geass theory, which is that Nunnally knew who Zero was the entire time. I feel that this is backed up by the anime in nearly every interaction between Nunnally and Zero or the Black Knights. Every time that it appears that Nunnally is in danger from Zero she always remains resolute in her insistence that Zero will do what she believes is the right thing. Even when confronting Lelouch prior to the final battle over Japan she never calls him out on the fact that he was Zero, only her disgust that he would force people to do monstrous acts that went against their nature.  (P.s. I also believe that a lot of her problems with the use of geass stem from Schneizel deliberately withholding infomation from her.)"

The only ones I know had sakuradite reactors were never destroyed close enough to something hey could damage heavily, or did not have their core destroyed such as lelouche's which only lost limbs."
CodeGeass,1srcec,Voxous,4,Tue Jan 14 05:54:17 2014 UTC,"From an engineering standpoint, I don't think they're that practical. I mean, what's the point of the legs? or putting all the useful weapons on the arms, which are arguably the most easily detachable part. If Knightmares existed in real life they'd be boring ugly, floating tanks."
CodeGeass,1srcec,watereol,4,Fri Dec 13 05:47:49 2013 UTC,"Oh no, there are definitely few factors you haven't considered.   First, one factor you did not think about the legs vs.wheels is the terrain. Surely, in the modern times, we have paved roads therefore it would intuitive to have wheels. However, if you think about hills, mountain, or any uneven structures, the legs would be necessary. Having both available in the Knightmare is great. If your argument was to transfer over to human legs, we should all be using roller blades.  About the hands, they can use any weapons with hands. They typically hold those giant Uzi type, but when ammo run out and whatnot, the hands can either reload or pick another weapon, for example Knightmare sized rocket launcher. They could also throw cars if anything."

CodeGeass,1sly1d,Ar-Curunir,8,Wed Dec 11 04:15:52 2013 UTC,"I felt that Death Note wasn't anywhere as good as Code Geass. Nowhere near the same emotional impact, perhaps because all the leads in Death Note were so emotionally detached.  I'd instead recommend Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Lots of emotional attachement as well as some heartbreaking losses."
CodeGeass,1sly1d,wizarduss,5,Wed Dec 11 07:16:27 2013 UTC,"I agree on Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Though I wouldn't write Death Note off that easy, I personally liked it, until about halfway through. After that event (if you've seen it you know what I mean) it starts to go downhill fast."

CodeGeass,1sly1d,Mr_Redletter,2,Wed Dec 11 05:55:48 2013 UTC,"I recommend Neon Genesis Evangelion its not as great but it still has an amazing plot (except the last 2 episodes,still can't make sense of them). It may fit your tastes."

CodeGeass,1sly1d,BretticusWins,2,Thu Dec 12 05:45:02 2013 UTC,"Attack on Titan, FMA:B, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. They should keep you busy for a while."

CodeGeass,1sjpqa,RuneKatashima,2,Tue Jan 7 12:55:19 2014 UTC,I don't know why people specifically claim they have to turn their brains off for this anime.  Lots of great animes are stupid in the same sense. TTGL...
CodeGeass,1sjpqa,Park216,1 point,Wed Jan 8 07:15:14 2014 UTC,"I would agree, But with Gurren Lagann you kind of realize they're going for this absurd over the top feel. But with GC it feels like they're trying to take themselves seriously. And when you start to think about the plot and how characters interact with eachother....well...it get's pretty sketchy."
CodeGeass,1sjpqa,jgunit,10,Wed Jan 8 13:24:25 2014 UTC,"I agree that the ending was fantastic and the 'void' feeling is strong after Code Geass, but considering that the first three shows you list as other animes you have watched are bleach, naruto, and one piece it's not surprising at all that you were so affected by this one.  Although it doesn't seem like it, those three shows have a lot in common, especially in their structure, specifically in that they are these infinitely long and on going stories that seem to never end. Although it's great never having to say goodbye to the universe, it also can become very stale after a while. A character can only become SO superpowered before it gets stupid and often times the plots lose direction after a few seasons and it feels like they are just walking in circles.  If you continue watching shorter (15-25) episode animes, you'll realize how much you've been missing. The plots feel a lot more compact, and character development is a lot clearer and less ambiguous. It's hard to really become stale in such a short series and you feel like you get to experience the climax without having to wait for ever. And as unfun as it seems now, you start to really appreciate that void at the end of the show.  It was said in another comment that Death Note and Steins;Gate are great choices, but if you're willing to jump into drastically different genres I could suggest many more shows that are great as well!"
CodeGeass,1sjpqa,youngeric86,2,Tue Dec 10 16:28:35 2013 UTC,Void is probally the best word to describe how I feel at the moment. I guess in a way its good though as I'm more open to try different animes.
CodeGeass,1sjpqa,Psychemistry,4,Tue Dec 10 19:31:21 2013 UTC,this thread convinced me to watch steins gate

CodeGeass,1sjpqa,Caboose119z,3,Tue Dec 10 21:10:45 2013 UTC,"Yo, watch Steins;Gate. It is difficult to get into but it is possibly the most enjoyable anime I have watched, ever. By the time you are into episode 8, you won't be able to stop."

CodeGeass,1sjpqa,PTDota,2,Wed Dec 11 03:35:05 2013 UTC,"I can't compare this series to any other as it is so different and personally it is my all-time favorite. But I do know some other good, relatively similar shows. As many have said, if you like Lelouch, then you might like the main character from Death Note. They are definitely different in some ways, but extremely similar in some ways too. Also, I feel CG is on a fairly high level intellectually, and Death Note certainly has that in common with CG. Stein's Gate is another good one. I actually haven't finished it yet myself, but it seems great. I also really like FMA and FMA:Brotherhood, as well as Darker than Black, Baccano, and Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom. These all have action and drama and are great series imo. FMA is a little less drama though. Also, if you like the mechas, Neon Genesis Evangelion and Gurren Lagann are great. Although, both are very different from CG. And Claymore is fairly goodhonestly imo. Maybe give it another try after watching some other good stuff. Anyways, I know the feeling you are talking about all too well and I am sure most CG fans do as well. I hope you can find a way to get past it and can continue enjoying CG and other series."

There ARE-REALLY-great anime series out there that might make you feel like they're on par and make you feel like, ""No, I haven't watched the best yet""  GRArkada brought up this point. You probably feel like you've watched the best and there's no point to watching others. I'd mostly agree with you but Fate/Zero and some others should satiate you."

CodeGeass,1sjpqa,Shadowgale,-2,Wed Dec 11 04:22:11 2013 UTC,"It will pass, then you'll watch it again and notice small details that you didn't notice the first time.  The best part of Code Geass is that it doesn't really shove its message down your throat. The entire show is about the ideologies and personal conflict of the people who represent them.   And I'd argue that no character was a hero, just people in a war. Even with its ending, I'd hesitate to call anyone hero as it ends with Spoiler  Any other happenings are simply a consequence of their positions in the world."

It didn't exactly ruin them for me (I had been a big anime fan long before CG) but I became a bit more judgmental of other shows because of it. Code Geass is definitely in my top 5 and it would be pretty hard to knock it off."
CodeGeass,1sjpqa,watereol,0,Wed Dec 18 04:45:34 2013 UTC,Personally I felt the Claymore anime was not that great because it ends on a cliffhanger and has yet to be continued. Code Geass was a great anime though and it left me in a state of shock when I finished as well. If you want to experience a similar feeling then I would say watch Clannad. It's a high school romance/drama and has little to no action in it but it definitely changed my perspective on life and left me in shock for at least 2 days after I watched it. If that's not for you I would say try Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood or Attack on Titan.

I just hadn't read or heard anything about it really. My friend suggested it, so I watched it and fucking loved it. It is still my favorite series to this day. And I've seen a decent amount of shows."
CodeGeass,1rp5b6,LiamSkylar,2,Fri Nov 29 22:48:55 2013 UTC,"Same here! Friend insisted that I had to watch it, needless to say I finished r1 in 2 days... Love this show, especially the ending. It was brilliant!"
CodeGeass,1r9eyy,yeshayden,5,Sat Nov 23 02:08:00 2013 UTC,"""Code Geass: Akito the Exiled"" is four hour-long episodes that take place in the time-skip between R1 and R2. They focus on characters in the EU, fighting the war against Britannia. So far, two episodes have been released and only the first has been subbed in English. We don't know whether they'll ever be dubbed or not."
CodeGeass,1r70pg,jinnyjuice,14,Fri Nov 22 04:09:34 2013 UTC,"My favourite scene in the whole show is in the last few episodes (I have never watched from 22 to 25 of R2 on their own and can't be bothered to find out which it is right now), where Lelouch and C.C.are sitting with their backs together on their bed aboard the Avalon in the darkness, just talking.  I would have really loved more of these quiet scenes, showing two characters connect and wind down together. I also feel that more of these scenes would have helped prevent the second season from feeling quite so chaotic."
CodeGeass,1r70pg,ReoRak,2,Fri Nov 22 05:34:04 2013 UTC,"I agree. There really was a lot of depth of character in the show, and I felt like R2 didn't fully utilize that."

Not asking for fanservice or nudity, just a romance scene.   Obviously I'd prefer it be Lelouch with someone, but I know that was never an option. I know Ougi and Viletta did it, but I'm thinking more like Suzaku/Euphie or Milly/Rivalz. Even though Milly and Rivalz never actually got together."

CodeGeass,1qpz3c,OneAnimeBatman,6,Fri Nov 15 22:08:51 2013 UTC,"I am American so I apologize if this information is not helpful to you in the UK.  The reason Code Geass DVDs are difficult to purchase lately is because the series was licensed by Bandai and they discontinued all DVD releases last year.  As such, people who have leftover DVD sets are charging a lot for them because they're currently out-of-print.  About a month or two ago CG was re-licensed by Funimation, so the series should be coming out again this year or next.  If the company releases DVDs in the UK, you should be able to get it for a much better price."

CodeGeass,1qpz3c,Zolstorm,1 point,Sat Nov 16 06:45:04 2013 UTC,Thanks that's exactly what I was looking for :D  EDIT: Sold Out :/
CodeGeass,1qpz3c,RANewton,2,Sat Nov 16 11:20:35 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I preordered the last one that was going for £20 on amazon UK, that was supposedly ""in stock"" never received it. They then said theyve completely run out of them and cant seem to get anymore. I've checked several differnet websites and its sold out in all of them. Quite frustrating considering I have the R2 DVD UK pack and want season 1 to have the whole thing. I believe theyve completely sold out and stopped printing thats why theyre up for £400 now, instead of £20 which was the price tag like 2 months ago."
CodeGeass,1qpz3c,ReoRak,1 point,Tue Nov 19 18:29:58 2013 UTC,Its really strange that Amazon stopped selling them I got my season 1 dvd from amazon a couple years ago for maybe less than £20. Anyway I found this site after a quick google. Never seen or used it before so I don't know how good or reliable it is but it seems to have the dvd for a fairly reasonable price.
CodeGeass,1qpz3c,Nathionez,-1,Sat Nov 16 00:48:16 2013 UTC,"Yeah, That site has insane shipping costs like £15 to the UK which seems weird from a UK site :( It was on amazon as late as August and then it suddenly went out of stock everywhere which is pretty weird."
CodeGeass,1qodav,jmull3215,3,Fri Nov 15 06:32:00 2013 UTC,Its true people can just choose to believe if he is still alive or dead. It was really open ended. I chose to believe that he's still alive because thats just how I like it. :) Makes it seem like he's even more genius for planning everything out to his advantage in the end and also having the most epic scheme vs Britannia.
CodeGeass,1qodav,ibankai7,2,Fri Nov 15 15:17:19 2013 UTC,"Ok so, CC whispers his name at the end and we can wonder if he is now alive like Lady Marianne OR if she was just talking to herself as if he was there. Otherwise it's hardly open ended, we saw him bleed out in Nunnally's arms after being stabbed by a giant sword and falling down stairs.  That being said, I was totally expecting him to show up again just for a second at the end pretending to be a peasant or something. I don't know if that would have killed the magic, I think making him actually die had a lot of power."
CodeGeass,1qodav,jgunit,1 point,Fri Dec 6 16:49:06 2013 UTC,"I feel like an ending with him alive cheapens the whole ""he who kills must be prepared to be killed thing."" I know either way his time as zero is over, but him being alive almost cheapens the ending for me, but that's just me."
CodeGeass,1qodav,friendsKnowMyMain,2,Sat Dec 28 01:31:24 2013 UTC,"I think the community is either evenly divide or actually on the side of him surviving. I'm not an expert, but from the stuff I've seen (which is probably biased) this is the case. I personally subscribe to the idea he survived. It just seems like another step in his Xanatos gambit."
CodeGeass,1qodav,Johnnywycliffe,2,Mon Nov 18 02:42:46 2013 UTC,"Yes. Personally I think the theory on the second post down if you order this sub by top of all time (sorry for no link, on phone) is correct."
CodeGeass,1qodav,heidurzo,-2,Fri Nov 15 17:42:24 2013 UTC,Its seems the original intention was that yes hes alive  but they shorted the clip to make it more so of an open opinion ending
CodeGeass,1qodav,KillerChicken48,10,Fri Nov 15 10:40:39 2013 UTC,"That's been confirmed to be a fake. Just believe what you want to believe, because in the end, Lelouch vi Britannia still pulled off the most epic scheme of all time."
CodeGeass,1qodav,ActingCasual,1 point,Fri Nov 15 11:50:42 2013 UTC,I like this ending. And i wish he was alive. But i feel like this wasnt made by the original makers of the anime. When you pause it when lelouch smiles. It is just drawn TERRIBLY. The hair is all on color and blends in with the shadow.. The mouth is just a line which i guess can go either way... the bottom lip part though isnt even centered... his chin is a fucking triangle for christ sake... way too pointy.. All in all i think if this was part of the anime the artists woulda drawn it WAY better. Its probably some fan art that the artist edited together with the ending. And eventually someone thought it was the original or something and passed it down as that.
CodeGeass,1qodav,wiithewalrus,1 point,Fri Nov 15 16:25:15 2013 UTC,"True, but  I had hoped for maybe the people behind code geass debunking it rather than just analysis of the clip. Nothing quite beats official word. Thanks."
CodeGeass,1qeyb7,Rayden454,17,Mon Nov 11 23:45:17 2013 UTC,Spoilers All
CodeGeass,1qeyb7,Silvadream,6,Tue Nov 12 14:27:22 2013 UTC,I just finished the anime...  How did I not realize the humor in Jeremiah running an orange farm...my goodness is that's funny!
CodeGeass,1qeyb7,Staple_Overlord,3,Sat Nov 23 17:28:16 2013 UTC,I am literally in the exact same boat.
CodeGeass,1qeyb7,jgunit,11,Fri Dec 6 16:53:01 2013 UTC,"It was used later, on Anya in the final Damocles battle so she could remember her past which was erased by the emperor."
CodeGeass,1qeyb7,SinWave,6,Mon Nov 11 23:50:52 2013 UTC,"Still, that's more of a decision on Jeremiah's part more than a Lelouche plot."
CodeGeass,1qeyb7,Silvadream,7,Tue Nov 12 14:25:02 2013 UTC,"I take it another way. Jeremiah, by reserving the use of his cancellation ability, is demonstrating his loyalty in the most extreme way possible. Jeremiah has more absolute power than anyone else in the show but because he is so faithful to Lelouch he only uses it the one time (because he feels he must because Anya was robbed of her life)."
CodeGeass,1qeyb7,Sevaroth,3,Tue Nov 12 23:53:12 2013 UTC,I agree. That branch had a lot of potential uses in the overall story and they let it wither away into the background of the stage. I did enjoy how they incorporated him into the backstory with Lady Marianne and Cornelia and used that to add not only more action but also more depth.
CodeGeass,1qeyb7,jmull3215,2,Fri Nov 15 06:36:55 2013 UTC,But who would it be used on? The only people that he could really use it on would be someone he manipulated. Not really that advantages.
CodeGeass,1qeyb7,ShadicNanaya510,0,Mon Nov 25 01:41:30 2013 UTC,It couldn't really serve much purpose afterwards.  Spoiler
CodeGeass,1qeyb7,sideswipegtx,2,Sat Nov 30 20:45:09 2013 UTC,"I just want to point out that the Shirley thing does not confirm that he can't use it again after Jeremiah's counter. I interpreted that scene as saying even Lelouch and his Geass cannot stop the inevitable, at that point there was nothing she could have done."
CodeGeass,1qeyb7,jgunit,1 point,Fri Dec 6 16:55:21 2013 UTC,"Not necessarily.  If she was under Lelouch's geass again, she likely wouldn't have gone on about her eternal love of Lelouch as she died.  She would have, like Suzaku or Lelouch's geass-controlled army in the last episodes of R2, done whatever it took to ""not die"" even if it wasn't possible.  It's also not something that she would have considered completely immoral like in Euphemia's case because she wasn't suicidal (no, the scene where she almost fell from that building is not considered a suicide attempt)  that's how I see it anyway."
CodeGeass,1qeyb7,sideswipegtx,2,Fri Dec 6 18:18:10 2013 UTC,"Yeah but what could she have done? She was literally 30 seconds from dying, blood pouring out of her abdomen. It's not like she could have willed the blood back inside of her. I think if the writers wanted to show that Jeremiah's power didn't mean Lelouch got a second shot a using Geass on a person, there would be much better ways to do it.  I am very confident that the point was a sort of revelation for Lelouch that he wasn't actually God, he couldn't truly save everybody, he couldn't stop death. His power has a limit and it's what is physically possible. It wasn't simply a matter of having an internal instinct on how to live that could enhance your reactions and tell you what to do, it was literally impossible for her to survive so the Geass didn't work."

CodeGeass,1qc4c2,Vinkelslip,16,Sun Nov 10 23:06:03 2013 UTC,Probably the most popular theory is this.
CodeGeass,1qc4c2,aDumbGorilla,3,Mon Nov 11 00:52:28 2013 UTC,I had never seen that theory before. That makes a lot of sense though.  Any other theories?
CodeGeass,1qc4c2,alberto549865,3,Mon Nov 11 03:55:07 2013 UTC,"Personally I think that he's dead. His surviving would defeat the purpose of the requiem, in a sense. He wanted to destroy the world and create anew. He was the embodiment of the ""old world,"" and thus needed to die for the world to move forward. Lelouch vi Britannia, enemy of the world, needed to die."
CodeGeass,1qc4c2,DrN0,9,Mon Nov 11 22:02:17 2013 UTC,"But Lelouch Vi Britannia is just a persona, a character he has created for a specific purpose. (Not at the start but in the requiem).    In the same way actors don't need to actually die in films to make it real.  To be honest I think the whole thing was the writers keeping everyone happy:  The people who want him alive have enough to go off, whilst the people who want him dead also have more than enough to go off.  Personally he's alive, but that's just me, if you think the story works more if he's dead then he's dead."
CodeGeass,1qc4c2,alberto549865,1 point,Thu Nov 14 22:06:38 2013 UTC,Very well put.
CodeGeass,1qc4c2,SilverSomething,0,Fri Nov 15 02:21:05 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I think so too, but it's nice to hear about these theories if only to imagine what would happen afterward."
CodeGeass,1qc4c2,LegendaryGinger,10,Mon Nov 11 22:11:53 2013 UTC,"Before all the goddamn flame wars start about whether he's alive or dead, bringing out bullshit theories and explanations, let me say this. The ending is ambiguous for a reason. He could be either, depending on your interpretation of lelouch's motives, and the events of the requiem. Just sit back and bask in one of the greatest endings in all of anime."
CodeGeass,1qc4c2,IserbiusBJJ,2,Mon Nov 11 00:32:58 2013 UTC,"He is NOT living in C's World , it was mentioned (Though the episode it was mentioned in escapes me) that Marianne being able to telepathically speak with CC was part of her Geass. (Marianne was alive, she would occasionally take control of Anya's Body)"
CodeGeass,1qc4c2,777TheOneAndOnly777,3,Sun Nov 24 01:22:22 2013 UTC,Lelouch dying seems like too pointless of an ending for him. In chess you can't sacrifice your king to beat your opponent it doesn't work that way.

CodeGeass,1q7gj3,megacookie,3,Fri Nov 8 23:29:47 2013 UTC,Just keep watching. R2 is a continuation (with some time skip) even if it will seem kind of strange at first.
CodeGeass,1q7gj3,garganchua,2,Sat Nov 9 02:58:19 2013 UTC,Strange wont begin to describe it.it's as if it's a totally diffrent anime with the same characters.

CodeGeass,1q4v1c,yidavs,7,Thu Nov 7 22:40:26 2013 UTC,Geass would be bad for the world overall. Now having awesome characters would be great.
CodeGeass,1q4v1c,Silvadream,3,Thu Nov 7 22:56:34 2013 UTC,"I know, a world like this would be horrible, and many people would lose their lives and tragedies everywhere but...I dont know, I guess it just makes me feel insignificant compared to someone like Lelouch. And dont you want to have an immortal-witch-lover like CC? I sure would...I should wait another day or so after watching the ending because half a day is not enough to get over it"
CodeGeass,1q4v1c,megacookie,5,Thu Nov 7 23:08:55 2013 UTC,The scary part is how corrupting the power is. You can see how Lelouch being so many times morally strong than us was abusing it at times.
CodeGeass,1q4v1c,DrN0,3,Fri Nov 8 03:01:27 2013 UTC,"Yeah, the Code Geassverse is fantastic. I'm on the fence about living in the Code Geassverse though, on one hand there's cool Mecha to pilot and I would live in the most powerful nation. On the other hand, there's tons of war, genocides, killing and institutionalized racism, more than there is in our world. If I lived after the events of R2, I think it might be okay.   The Akito the exiled OVAs are okay. I dislike the use of CG, but others like it. I'd give them a chance."
CodeGeass,1q4v1c,megacookie,2,Fri Nov 8 00:06:26 2013 UTC,"After R2, the Geassverse would be pretty dope. For a few months or years before the next big war things start happening. And even in that case, seeing Knightmares put to use would be fun to watch, as long as you're far away enough not to be in the range of collateral damage."
CodeGeass,1q4v1c,Zusuf,2,Fri Nov 8 04:31:18 2013 UTC,Don't forget there is a guardian against war put in place at the end.
CodeGeass,1q4v1c,RookieStyles,1 point,Thu Nov 14 22:10:07 2013 UTC,"All countries/federations are at peace with each other and engage in diplomatic negotiations rather than power struggles and war, and that guardian will probably do a great job in maintaining order. But that won't mean there would never be conflicts which could escalate again. I bet under a peaceful surface some old (or newfound) hatreds continue to boil, stuff could become unstable in an instant, and because the new world is no longer ruled by a monolithic entity but presumably by a more democratic process, said guardian could begin to lose power and leverage if public opinion becomes more divided. Corruption, internal politics, selfish interest, power hungry corporations, basically anyone who benefited from the unfairness and volatility of the old world may be seeking revenge for the loss of their ill begotten gains. Tons of reasons that the post-R2 ""happy ending"" could begin to erode."

CodeGeass,1pifkt,NejiPt,2,Mon Dec 23 19:23:23 2013 UTC,"I have seen a lot of animes, like Hunter X Hunter, One Piece , Naruto , Yu Yu Hakusho, Kill La Kill ( read manga ) , Mirai Nikki , Soul Eater , Highschool, Bleach , World God Only Knows etc. , but I never felt more connected to an anime as Code Geass.  Lelouch has the prettiest face out of all anime characters, and after watching 50 episodes in less than a week, it suddenly is all gone..... When Lelouch died ( or pretended to die ) I felt like someone left me.   Honestly this was the best possible ending, I won't be sad if they would make a R3, but neither if they don't do it. I really like to listen to the amazing OSTs that Code Geass has. Sadly I won't rewatch it, because I don't like rewathing animes, it feels like someone spoiled the whole anime for you and you don't want to watch it anymore."
CodeGeass,1pifkt,ZephyrL0rd,3,Wed Oct 30 23:36:43 2013 UTC,"Notice how C.C. is pronounced as C2 and V.V. pronounced as V2? R2 is Lelouch after obtaining the code. Japanese pronounces L as R. Therefore, there wont be a R3 nor a season 3.  My 2 cents."
CodeGeass,1pifkt,FateAudax,2,Thu Dec 5 04:12:45 2013 UTC,I think you may be mistaken about Kill La Kill. It wasn't a manga. Its an original production by Trigger.
CodeGeass,1pifkt,GaiusEmidius,2,Fri Nov 1 19:20:46 2013 UTC,"At first I couldn't believe that he died like that. To me at that point it was a satisfying ending but I wasn't exactly happy about it.   However, since I was so caught up on what was happening, I failed to see how it actually ended, which was explained through the theory of lelouch being alive still. After realizing that, I was completely mind blown. Definitely an amazing ending."
CodeGeass,1pifkt,ibankai7,3,Wed Oct 30 12:54:27 2013 UTC,"I read that the writers said in an interview that lulu is dead.

CodeGeass,1pifkt,megacookie,7,Wed Oct 30 16:22:04 2013 UTC,"Yeah, the debate over whether he is dead or alive has been raging on the internets since the end of R2 in 2008 I imagine. Biggest ""proof"" he is alive beyond speculation and that dubious wagon scene, is when Nunnaly grabbed his hand, she saw a flashback of the ""truth"". Similar to when Lelouch touched C.C and saw a bunch of her memories."
CodeGeass,1pifkt,megacookie,1 point,Wed Oct 30 16:44:14 2013 UTC,"Just believe whatever you want, but keep it to yourself. the ending is left ambiguous for that reason. There is no true right answer, but it is annoying to me when people keep trumpeting their ""proof"" that he's alive."
CodeGeass,1pifkt,FateAudax,2,Sat Nov 2 16:57:06 2013 UTC,"Yeah, but I believe the ending was left ambiguous because they wanted to generate strong reactions and differing opinions. So while there is no solid evidence to prove or disprove anything, as so much is left unexplained or open ended, it's fun to speculate and try to validate your point of view using the shaky evidence that exists for both cases. It's not just anime or Code Geass, anything with an ambiguous ending will cause a similar reaction and clash of opinions. Did Batman die in TDKR, with the later scenes being Alfred's wish rather than reality? In Inception, did Cobb actually wake up or was he still dreaming? There isn't a right answer, but there are better formed and more validated opinions and arguments than others."
CodeGeass,1pifkt,DrCakey,1 point,Sat Nov 2 18:01:38 2013 UTC,Shouldn't the biggest hint being the name of the 2nd season of Code Geass itself? What do you think R2 stands for?  Notice how C.C. is pronounced as C2 and V.V. pronounced as V2? R2 may be Lelouch's after obtaining the Code.

CodeGeass,1p0lvy,MGTA12,5,Wed Oct 23 00:41:36 2013 UTC,"An interesting hypothesis. Since the 'god' is the collective unconscious of the world, them Mao could probably read the minds of everyone in the world at once. (Would this make his head explode? Please discuss.) CC wouldn't have much of an effect, since love is more of an emotional thing rather than a conscious decision. With Charles, that is almost what he was trying to do; rewrite the minds of the entire world in order to bring peace, but ultimate entropy."
CodeGeass,1p0lvy,sean151,3,Wed Oct 23 01:42:03 2013 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that Mao would have had a seizure due to his own mind being overloaded by every single mind in existence.  It's the only possible action I can foresee the human body taking to eliminate the ""noise""."

CodeGeass,1p0lvy,Silvadream,3,Wed Oct 23 10:47:47 2013 UTC,Doesn't Lelouche say something about not commanding the great unconscious but requesting it?
CodeGeass,1p0lvy,Zoogy,2,Wed Oct 23 05:44:18 2013 UTC,Yeah he said something like that but Lelouche does lie and mislead people so he could have lied for some reason. Of course it also could be that Lelouche really did just ask it not to do what Charles wanted it to do and then it didn't of its own free will. I guess we wont ever really know for sure.
CodeGeass,1p0lvy,Silvadream,2,Wed Oct 23 13:29:58 2013 UTC,"No, I'm saying when he was using Geass on the Great Unconscious, he said something like ""This isn't a command, it's a request."""

Second series felt like more of a clusterfuck. Entire arcs were introduced and finished in three episodes. It felt like they were trying to fit two more seasons worth of plot into just the one.

CodeGeass,1om9zy,AnorOmnis,8,Thu Oct 17 14:34:34 2013 UTC,R2 for me. Too many amazing moments. The escalation was well paced. Lelouch became a whole new person over the course of that season.

I went into it not knowing that there were two seasons at all and assumed that the R2 on the end of the title would be explained by the end.  I'll admit that it was strange watching a show where, as far as I knew, events that happened from before the show was set were referred to casually, without any elaboration (I did know that it wasn't based on a manga series that could have filled in any of R1's plot ).   Of course, everything was explained and cleared up once I watched the first season, but the sense that there was a far more developed world that the creators felt didn't need to be shown gave the show an almost magical quality that I wouldn't trade for the world."

She travels across 2 boxcars in 0.7 seconds, at full throttle, as I assume, since this is a direct attack and she had room to accelerate. A standard boxcar is 50 feet long, plus an estimated 10 foot distance between the cars, means she went 110 feet in 0.7 seconds, or 157.1 feet per second.

CodeGeass,1ngtej,megacookie,6,Mon Sep 30 22:29:44 2013 UTC,Interesting that Lelouch and Sayoko have such similar physiques and that with a facial disguise none of his friends could tell the difference. Other than Sayolouch being strangely athletic.

But she did not know he was a Britannian prince and heir to the throne until later, right? Only royal family can take the role of viceroy, and thus if Nunnaly was viceroy then Lelouch must be a Britannia too."

CodeGeass,1ndhx3,pmitch94,5,Sun Sep 29 16:44:43 2013 UTC,it's not explicitly stated whether she knows he's a prince or not. The most likely explanation is that CC told her about him being a prince and she decides to seek his help since he is the only hope of defeating Brittania.
CodeGeass,1ndhx3,Reddit197,2,Sun Sep 29 18:54:41 2013 UTC,well in R1 episode 25 Suzaku says he killed his sister Euphemia right in front of Kallen
CodeGeass,1n5tdw,mattrot92,16,Thu Sep 26 06:18:25 2013 UTC,"Biggest loser for me would be Diethard. His life's work amounted to very little, and he will likely die forgotten. My other losers are Nina and Euphie. Nina will be known as the person who invented FLEIJAs, and may even be killed for it. Euphie massacred tons of Japanese, and set back Japanese rights a long way (think of the pre-R2 world with the brothers fighting to death).   My biggest winner is Jeremiah Gottwald. He's fulfilled his duty as Marianne's protector, and reclaimed his honour. He's now living his life peacefully on an orange farm. Kallen no longer has to fight, and she has her Mother back. Japan also has independence. The useless Tamaki will be remembered as a patriotic veteran, and probably gets tons of respect."
CodeGeass,1n5tdw,Silvadream,8,Thu Sep 26 08:44:44 2013 UTC,"Top three winners would be:   Lelouch. As you stated, he did end up dying (I won't go into the other theories), but his plan went flawlessly. Besides hurting Nunally, an unavoidable outcome, everything he planned worked. He died as a tyrant,  Suzaku became Zero and the symbol he was meant to be, the world slowly demilitarized, and best of all, nobody has any idea it was all an elaborate scheme.  Kallen. She fought tooth and nail for her country's independence. She had no life outside of the Black Knights, no proper family, and was forced to watch Lelouch slip into darkness, and then fight him. By the end of the series, she no longer needs to fight and can finally be a normal girl, has her mother back, and is the only one to figure out that Lelouch wasn't the demon he was trying to portray himself as.  Jeremiah. He had one of the roughest rides in the show. Between being shamed, played, and reborn, the series wasn't kind to him. But to see him at the end on his farm is heartwarming. He redeemed himself, fought for the ideals him and Lelouch shared, and was able to walk away from it all, living a fulfilling life in peace.    Top three losers would be   Shirley. At first I thought her love for Lelouch was the typical token highschool drama we see in a lot of anime. But it evolved past that. She didn't have a teenage crush on Lelouch, she loved him. When Lelouch wiped her memories, I knew it was for the best. But in her eyes, he was killing himself. Everything she knew about him, gone in an instant. But it is the fact that she fell in love again and as a result died, makes her the ultimate loser. All she wanted was to be with Lelouch, and she was stripped of that dream twice. Nunally. All she wanted was to be happy with her brother. But she hadn't seen the things Lelouch had seen. He knew that no amount of happiness could fulfil the void in his heart. His desire for piece was just that. His. Nunally wanted peace as well, but not at the cost of her only remaining family member.  Diethard. Say what you will about him, but he died in an awful way. Was he paparazzi scum? Yes. But that was his life's work. To get the best stories, the best angles. To be remembered. And when he died up there on the Damacles, alone and forgotten, his dream died as well. Diethard will not be remembered for anything, invalidating everything he's ever done.    Honourable mentions  Losers   Nina. She made the FLEIJAs, a weapon of unprecedented destruction. The guilt she must feel for all the deaths she caused would be unbearable. Not to mention she may even be tried or killed for war crimes. Euphemia. She was by far the most caring individual in the series. And due to a freak accident, completely out of her control, she will be remembered as the Viceroy who set up a rally for peace, only to massacre all the Japanese who attended.  Lelouch. While his plan went perfectly, he had to die. He left his only friend, and sister, alone in the world. He died a tyrant, the single worst emperor ever, and will never get to experience a truly peaceful world.  Charles and Marianne. While their dream was questionable at best, they both sacrificed so much to attain it. Only to have it stripped by their own son and his clashing ideals."
CodeGeass,1n5tdw,TangibleTurian,8,Fri Sep 27 00:48:42 2013 UTC,With looser I will only say what I think hasn't been said and the one person I think should be said is suzaku. At the end of r2 lelouch said that he can never be suzaku again. He has to live his life out as zero.   For winners I think c.c was a huge winner. For all these years she has wanted to end her life but by the end she understood that she didn't need to die. Lelouch was ment to kill c.c but instead he saved her
CodeGeass,1n5tdw,redkiller4all,4,Thu Sep 26 12:50:41 2013 UTC,"Kaname Ohgi was definitely one of the biggest winners, considering how many bad/stupid decisions he made throughout the series.   Taking a random possibly dangerous Britannian girl home, being geassed by his dick to fall in love with her and trust and protect her over his own allies, betraying his country's savior and comrade in arms because of that her, tricking said savior into an EXECUTION in which he wasn't allowed to defend himself or anything just because he had been sweet talked by a Britannian prince. Rolo died because of his actions. He practically set into motion the whole final arc.   And yet, he still somehow manages to get the BEST ending. Happy marriage with Viletta, kid on the way, becoming the prime minister of Japan. What is justice?  Other winners include Jeremiah and Kallen, but their happiness feels a lot more deserved than Ohgi's.  Losers? I'd say Lelouch and Suzaku. They had to give up their happy, youthful lives at school and with friends to save the world. Lelouch will always be remembered by a complete asshole to history. Suzaku will never be able to experience friendship or love ever again in his life.   Diehtard also came across as a loser to me too. I can tell that the writers were trying to make him come across as the ""evil team mate"" but he didn't really do anything bad compared to the rest of the Black Knights. Yet he's killed outright and dies in misery. Oh wow, he wanted to become a famous TV Producer. SUCH AN EVIL GOAL."
CodeGeass,1n5tdw,watereol,6,Thu Sep 26 13:38:46 2013 UTC,"Diehtard got what he deserved. He was the bottom-feeder of the revolution, taking whatever side was fitting for him. He had no loyalty. Compare that to Jeremiah, who got one of the best endings. He was loyal to the end, even if he had to follow his leader down the road to evil. There is a clear contrast between both their characters and their fate."

(Oh, and in case it isn't obvious, I consider Kaguya to be the biggest winner post Zero Requiem. Everyone always forgets that Lelouch basically gave her more than half the world on a platter and trusted her with it's future.)"
CodeGeass,1n5tdw,Shafalabaz,2,Fri Sep 27 03:36:49 2013 UTC,"Lelouch is simultaneously the biggest winner and loser.

CodeGeass,1lz2xi,Charles_Zi_Britannia,2,Mon Sep 9 00:09:00 2013 UTC,"Wait, similar in general sense or congruous?  I had a little difficulty reading this old English, so just to clarify, Thomas Hobbes, to summarize, wrote that everyone becomes equal because even if there's a strong person vs. weak person in test of physical strength, the weak person can create something (a machine) to maybe beat the stronger person.  To draw a picture, imagine a all-tough gangster that's grown in a gang environment. In contrast, another guy, say a scientist, is opposite of ""all-tough""; however, he can build a nuclear bomb. That one nuclear bomb can clean out a million gangsters.  This is what Thomas Hobbes was pointing out, just to clear up an any confusion."
CodeGeass,1lz2xi,Syncidence,1 point,Mon Sep 9 03:52:03 2013 UTC,"Well, that position is arguable - Hobbes clearly states in the opening paragraph that man are not all equal in mind or body, but are equals rather through the differences that make each man differ from the rest.   As to your nerd vs gang parallel, you need not go so far as a nuclear weapon - rather it is the nerd's genius that holds him as their equal; by any power or plan he conceives.   Further exposition of the original text clearly shows that Hobbes sees a unification of man under one power as the only sure way for social equality, the notion of individual equality is briefly (if ever) touched upon.   Thus I say that it is similar in the general sense, rather than congruous with Charles' speech in the anime. Both Hobbes and Charles have a clear notion that individual equality doesn't exist - the only real difference is that Charles doesn't see his subjects as socially equal to him. Darwinism seems to be the founding principle of The Holy Britannian Empire; and it is clearly a Common-wealth by acquisition as much as it is one by Inheritance."

I think it was due to the comments I saw at the time, but even then how did I know they were females?    But one thing I can say for certain is that majority of those comments were wanting Lelouch to be alive and with C.C. Speaking for myself, I want Lelouch to be alive because he's a pretty cool guy and deserved more than dying with the world hating him (though he doesn't mind), I couldn't care less which female companion he has or don't have.  I'd incline other males would follow the same type of thought.  So all the pairing wars I probably associated with female viewers."

CodeGeass,1lms2p,heidurzo,3,Tue Sep 3 16:29:46 2013 UTC,I thought the consensus is he's alive.
CodeGeass,1lms2p,rakony,1 point,Wed Sep 18 21:29:45 2013 UTC,I just finished the series; why is that the consensus?
CodeGeass,1lms2p,OhMilla,6,Sat Sep 28 16:20:30 2013 UTC,Because we all want it to be so. Also this theory is pretty convincing. Sorry I took so long to reply.
CodeGeass,1lms2p,rakony,1 point,Sun Sep 29 14:42:28 2013 UTC,"there are major holes in that theory  1) its never stated or hinted at that the user needs to die to activate the code, CC and Charles never use their Geass post-code even before Charles dies, the scene with C.C. covered in blood is because the nun commits suicide not that the nun killed her as is the popular belief in that theroy  2) It destroys the entire point of the Zero Requiem which is that Suzaku and Lelouche pay for their actions, Lelouceh with his own death and Suzaku with having to live without his identity ' 3)the main issue with this ""lelouche killed charles"" is he never actually kills charles, he uses his geass on the sword of Akosha which both Charles and Marian had bonded with which is why they BOTH disappear, if Lelouche had just stolen Charles' code than Marian would still exist within C's world  4) we see when Charles and C.C. die they revive very quickly, Lelouche would come back to life on the float with his sister sitll crying over his body and pow she would be like oh your alive. there is no plausible way for lelouche to get away unnoticed by the enormous crowd that is now celebrating the death of Lelouche and if you know your history than you will know that Dictators bodies that are overthrown are never left alone or just buried."
CodeGeass,1lms2p,pmitch94,1 point,Mon Oct 21 17:05:47 2013 UTC,As I said I subscribe in part because I just don't want Lelouch to have died. But it is possible for Lelouch to play dead and if Gottwald and C.C. are in on it they could rig something up. The fact Gottwald (prominent in Lelouch's regime) got away and lives a quiet life is in itself intriguing.
CodeGeass,1lms2p,rakony,1 point,Mon Oct 21 17:10:57 2013 UTC,"Gottwald retreats with all the troops leaving Lelocuhe at the feet of Suzaku and the black knights  C.C. is grieving for Lelouceh in a church and praying for him because he is going to Die. if she knew he would live she wouldn't be grieving becasue A) she's immortal and b) she loves lelouche so a+b = c) they would live immortal together so why would she be crying  I get that you want him to live, but that's not necessarily a happy ending, You are honestly missing out on an amazingly poetic ending that takes after Hamlet. Dying creates the perfect ending, it brings his story to an end and shows the curse of Geass and how he accomplished what he set out to do, create a new world and destroy the old one and he did it through self-sacrifice, which is probably the most heroic way a story can end is through self-sacrifice that the world will never know about. It's just a better ending in a literary way if you accept that he died"
CodeGeass,1lms2p,pmitch94,1 point,Mon Oct 21 17:21:57 2013 UTC,"Oh I can appreciate the symbolism and perhaps the justice of him dying. Although comparing it to Hamlet is a bit over the top. That doesn't mean I want him to die, indeed its so tragic as I wanted him to have a happy life but he sacrifices his life for others (even if he is alive he's sacrificed his entire identity).  C.C. could be crying because she feels sorry for Lelouch as he is giving up all his friends, Nunally, etc...   We can debate this into the ground but the ending has enough ambiguity to mean we can never be sure. C.C. saying ""Isn't that right Lelouch?"" is a giant cocktease for fan theorists."
CodeGeass,1lms2p,rakony,1 point,Mon Oct 21 17:33:02 2013 UTC,"It doesn't though. there is no ambiguity, if you think he lives then you're cheapening the ending.  I was comparing it to hamlet in story progression only not in level of execution or influence, prince out for revenge and he must face the consequence of his own death at the end.  Sacrificing his friendship is something he has already done in the last 4 episodes he does it over and over when he commits crimes as emperor   It takes an amazing amount of guess work and non explained reasoning to get to lelouche being alive 1) he receives the code, never stated nor proven 2) he directly kills Charels, he destroys the sword which charles is bound too 3)the user must die to activate the code, NEVER PROVEN. 4) that Lelouche somehow controls how long he is dead for until his body is left alone and is able to escape and no one wonders ""hey where did the body of the emperor go  I apologies if I seem rude here but its just frustrating that soooo many people are so adamant that he lives just so they can have this ""happy"" ending when every sign in the show points to the opposite result. even the creators have said he dies.  Lelouche is dead, the ending is perfect. that's the truth."
CodeGeass,1lms2p,pmitch94,1 point,Mon Oct 21 17:38:22 2013 UTC,"I didn't say there was much ambiguity just enough so that with C.C.'s comment people are willing to speculate. Also I don't think it cheapens it completely, as said Lelouch has sacrificed his own desires and identity. He abbandons his dream to live in a peaceful world with Nunally and abandons his friends. He also ensures he will always be seen as the vilest man in history even to some of his friends (who don't guess his plot like Kallen does), a burden I personally could never bare."
CodeGeass,1lms2p,rakony,1 point,Mon Oct 21 18:28:53 2013 UTC,"For your point 3:  It may not be EXPLICITLY stated, but it is  ""proven"" When lelouches Geass takes control of Charles and he shoots himself. Geass cannot affect someone who has a Code. its been proven when C.C. said that Lelouches Geass wouldnt work on V.V. Soo if his dad had the code pre-death, the Geass command to kill himself wouldnt have worked. My 2 cents anyways. p.s. i see this is 2 months old. Eh worth the arguement anyways.  Edit: Infact, its never proven in the series that if you have a code and die, you resurrect within a certain time limit. I would say that it depends on the sevarity of the wound. if you resurrected within the course of say a minute, V.V. would not have crawled to the lowest level of the Order base. he would ahve died, and resurrected at the door quickly. But that opens up a whole slew of other possibilities. The guys fin hoods from the order said that V.V. couldn't die, and could use the Twilight gate at the lowest level of the building. maybe dieing resurrects you at location like that."

She alone has seen what humans have done to each other,(themselves?) And in these different universes there is always a character who had the same characteristics of LeLouch. So in theory C.C. Is this God that is mentioned in the Egg theory that is guiding LeLouch through every outcome. When Shirley died she said that it didn't matter how many times she was reborn she would always fall in love with Lelouch. This very well helped my understanding of the anime in R2 around the end because everything was very heavy dialogued and thought some of the translations might be off by a bit."

If you shout instructions they are mentally unable to comprehend (or execute), they wouldn't be able to do anything.  I was actually thinking earlier, ""Would people who didn't understand the language that Lelouch spoke still be able to understand his commands? Would the Geass 'translate' and make the command universally understood in the person's brain?"""
CodeGeass,1l1ibw,megacookie,3,Sun Aug 25 04:39:55 2013 UTC,I think it would translate. It sort of seems like it bypasses the listening comprehension bit and goes directly to 'rearranging' the circuits in the brain (or at least that's how they animated it).

CodeGeass,1kwqkb,Irf00,9,Thu Aug 22 23:47:54 2013 UTC,"Honestly, I'm okay with it either way, I do like that they left some room for ambiguity there though. That being said, I'm not sure where they would be able to take the story after this even if they wanted to and made an R3. There's nothing left to make unless maybe the world government that Lelouche made breaks up? Plus it's not like C.C. Suzaku and Lelouche can ever show themselves anywhere again really, and i'm not sure what the value of it would be if they did. It also kind of ruins the idea of Suzaku becoming Zero Requiem and the character development that went into that."
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,Boredpotatoe2,25,Fri Aug 23 06:59:44 2013 UTC,Isn't this pretty much the accepted viewpoint for most of the Die-hard fans already?
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,ReoRak,26,Fri Aug 23 00:44:00 2013 UTC,And I now realize just where Diethard's name probably came from.
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,ReoRak,20,Fri Aug 23 00:45:38 2013 UTC,for the longest time I heard his name as D-Tard.
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,Emorio,2,Tue Oct 1 05:16:19 2013 UTC,His name comes from Diet Coke.
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,RuneKatashima,9,Tue Jan 7 08:45:07 2014 UTC,"Actually, the majority of the voices I hear just chant, ""It is what it looks like, he died.""  My biggest problem with that is how un-Lelouche-like that is. Seriously, after you watch R1 and R2 does Lelouche look like the type of person who would allow himself to die?"
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,B-Con,14,Fri Aug 23 06:58:57 2013 UTC,"The only ones who should kill are those prepared to die.  Lelouch surviving would be VERY un-Lelouch-like. And it also wouldn't explain why Suzaku would join him. I believe that Suzaku joined Lelouch because Lelouch convinced him that while he needs to atone for his sins, his death shouldn't just be a revenge killing if it could bring peace to the world."
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,Ryuuzoji,-1,Fri Aug 23 22:27:25 2013 UTC,"The only ones who should kill are those prepared to die.   Yes, and Lelouch believes this...   Lelouch surviving would be VERY un-Lelouch-like.   But the Zero Requiem was his plan. It's not like he got killed by a smarter, stronger enemy in a straight-up battle. He set up the whole thing to ""kill"" himself to finish his plan. Not finding an alternative plan that lets him live is what, IMO, un-Lelouch-like."
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,B-Con,10,Fri Aug 23 23:17:41 2013 UTC,"Lelouch not taking responsibility for his actions in the end seems completely grotesque and pretty much makes him much less of a person. If he survives, he's a coward, running from his on convictions and lying to his best friend to stay alive. Also, why make such a beautiful dramatic climax if it's all just a fake anyway?  Practially it's impossible for him to get out of there. Suzaku believes Lelouch to be dead. That was their plan, and the only reason Suzaku cooperates with him. How would he deal with escaping? I don't think his corpse would be allowed to ""disappear"" randomly, and with no help he wouldn't be able to escape.  Also, the sequence with Nunnaly looks nothing like any of the sequences where C.C. transfers her memories. Cinematically it's built completely different.  The whole ""Charles transfered his code""-part is completely unproven and have nothing in it. There's nothing to support this what-so-ever."
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,Ryuuzoji,4,Fri Aug 23 23:26:45 2013 UTC,"Thank you. I thought I was alone in believing this, but you prove that there are others besides me who think he's dead!"
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,Ryuuzoji,7,Sat Aug 24 02:21:47 2013 UTC,"Lelouch dying is obvious, if not just from the massive story elements saying so, then from the narrative ways. Him surviving negates ALL of the emotion in the final scene. If he's just going to get up, there's no sacrifice, no need for Suzaku nor C.C. to cry. Nunnaly's tears have been for noone. In fact, if he was planning to survive, then why make Nunally watch him die? I bet his plan was to be with her in his final moments."
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,SnowLRQ,5,Sat Aug 24 02:24:59 2013 UTC,there's no sacrifice   Lelouch's name will go down in history as the ultimate evil and will lose all connections with all the people he loved.   no need for Suzaku nor C.C. to cry   Suzaku will most likely never see his best friend again. C.C. caused all of this pain on to Lelouch and feels regret.   then why make Nunally watch him die?   He doesn't plan to come back so cutting all ties like this was the best. Lelouch was already resigned to never see Nunnally again when he talked to her in the Damocles.
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,Ryuuzoji,2,Fri Aug 30 01:43:25 2013 UTC,"You know, if he survived he had pretty good connections (Zero), and could just live secretly in a room behind Nunally's closet."

If he survives, he's a coward, running from his on convictions and lying to his best friend to stay alive.   Who said that he has to do? Or that he should? It has nothing to do with taking responsibility for anything.  It wouldn't be the first time he lied to his best friends.  Yes, it would remove some of the drama from the ending, but it's not all about drama. I don't mind seeing the mastermind live.   That was their plan, and the only reason Suzaku cooperates with him.   According to what? Why couldn't Suzaku have known? Suzaku was an ally, not a deep friend. He could've agreed just because he thought the plan would work.   The whole ""Charles transfered his code""-part is completely unproven and have nothing in it. There's nothing to support this what-so-ever.   That part is speculation, yes. But that's the purpose of these topics, to speculate."

That's the difference between casual and die-hard fans.  Besides, I like to think that he went into it believing that there was a tiny chance that he had received the Code from Charles (Like the type of niggling feeling in the back of your mind that you don't want to acknowledge for fear of disappointment) . That way it wouldn't matter to him if he died or not, as it would help him in dealing with his massive guilt complex, either by killing him outright or by having him live on knowing that he had done all he could to make the world a better place.   Not to mention that having him live on being able to see but never interact with those he cares about is a far crueler fate for Lelouch and something that the writers would conceivably do to him."

CodeGeass,1kwqkb,TheUltimateShammer,6,Fri Aug 23 01:04:18 2013 UTC,"I sometimes feel so lonely in my belief that he is dead, and stayed dead. Fans seem to keep trying to bend the plot and twist the logic to make it seem like he's alive. However, when one looks past the minutiae pointing to either argument and merely looks at the main theme of the show, (the morality of using contemptible means to noble ends) then his permanent death makes total sense. He had to die in order to pay for the grievous sins he committed to achieve the ends that came about. That is what makes the show, at its core, a tragedy. He didn't get to witness the beauty brought about by his sacrifice, which makes the ending all the more bittersweet and poignant."
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,megacookie,14,Fri Aug 23 01:24:13 2013 UTC,"Really, I'd rather he died too, but there really isn't any bending of the plot required to ""prove"" he's alive, just reading between the lines using what everyone already knows. Sure, take it at face value and yes, he took a big pointy sword to the guts and he died and it ties up the ending nicely, and also fits with the idea of paying for his crimes. But does it really? If permanent death is dreadful and punititive, while immortality is ""getting away with it"", ""cheating the system"", or whatever, then why was C.C's one wish as an immortal to die? Sure, her true wish was to be loved, but it was buried under the ordeal of being alive for so long, unloved. Truth is, immortal or not, you'd suffer the pain of death the same. Just as an immortal it would never end: you can't escape from yourself nor can you live a fulfilling life of growing old and dying content. Lelouch has committed far too many sins to escape after just a few seconds of agony and death from blood loss. Now, bearing the same pain, along with the guilt, responsibility, and regrets of his actions indefinitely while the world he saved views him with scorn and hatred to the point of having to live life as a recluse from society...now that's a better punishment Lelouch would offer himself. Although it won't be that bad as he is contractually bound by C.C for her to be loved. Which brings me to the other thing. Why the heck would C.C seem happy and carefree if Lelouch were dead? He would have betrayed her completely by not killing her and by dying as the one she loved, leaving her alone forever. C.C may act aloof but she really did look satisfied in that horse cart scene and not putting on a mask or brave face."

It doesn't take away from his sacrifice and in fact makes it worse for him. Lelouch doesn't get an easy way out. Dying isn't enough to atone for his sins.
CodeGeass,1kwqkb,GreenHairedSnorlax,5,Fri Aug 23 04:47:28 2013 UTC,"I could see that happening. Charles figured out Lelouch was planning on sacrificing himself somehow, and as a sort of dying curse for destroying his and Marianne's hopes and dreams he forces the code onto Lelouch."

CodeGeass,1ko5qd,Kerrigor2,6,Mon Aug 19 15:30:04 2013 UTC,What I don't get is if he had the code why would he give it to Suzaku before going through with the assassination. If he waited until after he could still give Suzaku the code and live through the assassination.
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,Look_Down_For_Lies,-6,Mon Aug 19 16:01:30 2013 UTC,He gives Suzaku the Code by dying. That's how it works. The nun gave C.C her's by dying. Charles killed V.V. C.C wanted Lelouch to kill her and take her Code. Leouch killed Charles. Suzaku killed Lelouch. Every Code transference either involved or required the death of the Code bearer.
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,redkiller4all,9,Mon Aug 19 16:08:06 2013 UTC,"That's false, v.v. Didn't die when Charles took his code. He lived but later on was killed cause a explosion happened during the raid. Also It was most likely a figure of speech to point out that suzaku could never be himself again and will only be remembered as zero."
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,megacookie,5,Mon Aug 19 16:48:09 2013 UTC,"If Lelouch actually did that, he would be a really, really shitty friend. Forcing someone that wanted to die for their crimes to do anything they can in order to survive is bad enough, to do so behind a mask, to be constantly hiding his identity while out there on the world stage for all to view as some sort of hero for the rest of his life when he himself knows he would be just a fraud of the original masked hero is already diabolical. Now, making him live forever? I dont see it. Immortality became a torture for C.C even though most of her life she was free to live as she pleased. Now it is possible Lelouch became a code bearer and did in fact grant Suzaku a power of Geass overriding his Geass command to want to survive with a similar power (but under Suzaku's control), but it's a long shot."
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,megacookie,1 point,Mon Aug 19 16:23:16 2013 UTC,"Hey, I said I may or may not have been right. I'm not saying that's what happened, but it does explain some things that otherwise is left open. And it would be pretty damn shitty to do that, but it might also be necessary. The Zero Requiem wasn't about their friendship anymore, they had a goal and they were going to reach it no matter what. Suzaku's a pretty shitty friend for killing him, whether Lelouch made him do it or not. What would happen if Suzaku got old and had to pass the mask on to someone else and they found out that Zero was him all along. Either Zero would lose his ""Symbol of Justice"" status, at the very least. Or they'd figure out about the Requiem, at the very worst.  Both Lelouch and Suzaku were ready to do pretty much anything to make sure their plan worked. And given that Suzaku was killing his best friend, I'd say he'd probably be willing to take the Code, as his friend's dying wish or whatever. Suzaku, loyal to his friend, would want someone to live on with the knowledge that Lelouch wasn't a bad guy. I reckon he'd do it.  And, Lelouch was always a really, really shitty friend, regardless of whether he gave him the Code or not. He was a shitty brother too."
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,megacookie,2,Mon Aug 19 22:17:56 2013 UTC,"You have a point. I guess my actual reservation to this interesting theory is that it's a lot of stuff that you have to assume simply because nothing is confirmed. It's dubious if Lelouch even got V.V's code from Charles, that's one assumption. 1 in 2 chance of it happening. We also don't know if Lelouch actually gave Suzaku a Geass when Suzaku said ""This Geass I do solemnly accept"" or if it was just metaphorical speech (because Lelouch earlier compared it to a wish that he would give to the world). Another assumption that's possible only if Lelouch himself were a code bearer. Note these are both reasonable conclusions that were somewhat alluded to in canon while keeping it open ended. In order for Suzaku to become immortal, Lelouch would first have to have a code in the first place, then grant Suzaku a Geass power, then Suzaku would have to use and train his Geass until mastery and have the sigil appear in both eyes when used (everyone who became an immortal had 2 eye geass so it might be a requirement), but still be in control of his power as the symbol was never visible in his eyes so they couldn't be ""always on"". Then he would be able to take lelouch's code. Not impossible, not something Lelouch wouldn't do if he could (thereby nullifying the point of my previous post), but simply a long shot. I attempted to make a flowchart to show how unlikely it is. I'll ignore for now the possibility of Lelouch taking the code from C.C because it doesn't matter where he gets his code from in this case.  Edit: Forgot the possibility of Lelouch giving Suzaku the code after being stabbed to survive the wound and live as a mortal. That fucks things/"
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,megacookie,1 point,Tue Aug 20 01:38:53 2013 UTC,The flow chart is pretty good except that Charles can't die while he has a code.
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,munsosl8,2,Tue Aug 20 15:02:44 2013 UTC,"Well, technically he didn't ""die"". He was reabsorbed into the collective consciousness because under Lelouch's command it saw Charles and Marianne as a threat to its existence. My guess is that because they were already in an alternate dimension separate from the physical world, nobody present at the Sword of Akasha were actually there in flesh and blood, but were manifestations of their soul. Which explains why Marianne was able to appear as herself, as her soul was intact. Thus, C's World (or consciousness, or God, whatever it is) didn't have to kill Charles' body, just absorb the soul. The question is what happened to his Code. Did it vanish with him, or did it stay in existence, latching on to the best suitable recipient? Which, through (brief) physical contact, and the fact he was now a fully realized Geass user was Lelouch."
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,Yourmamasmama,1 point,Tue Aug 20 15:13:33 2013 UTC,That could be true but it makes much more sense to follow the established rules in the series that Codes grant immortality and must be taken to turn the user mortal.
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,munsosl8,1 point,Tue Aug 20 15:19:44 2013 UTC,"The thing is, did Lelouch take the Code, or did he command God to forcibly remove Charles' code? I mean, an immortality code is one thing, but the collective will of the world is another."
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,sean151,4,Tue Aug 20 16:58:47 2013 UTC,Still doesn't explain the memory transfer to Nunnally.
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,blaser22,3,Tue Aug 20 06:30:57 2013 UTC,Really good point!
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,munsosl8,-2,Tue Aug 20 10:32:48 2013 UTC,"Nunnally could always do that, it wasn't a one time thing."
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,megacookie,4,Tue Aug 20 12:40:30 2013 UTC,"She could tell when someone lied based on their pulse, she never got to see their memories."
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,ToastyToast71,-1,Tue Aug 20 14:42:57 2013 UTC,I'm pretty sure she can see the memories of Code possessors.
CodeGeass,1ko5qd,Nobutadas,2,Tue Aug 20 15:37:53 2013 UTC,"One issue is that the code has to be activated by dying once and coming back to life, as seen with CC flashback and Charles' death in C's world.  The general consensus is that a person may posses both a geass power and a code at the same time, however the code will remain inactive until a person's first death, during which the geass will be overwritten and the code will take effect.  It's why Charles allowed Lelouch to kill him in C's world.  Also Lelouch showed Nunnally his memories as he ""died"", something only people who have a code are supposed to be able to do.  Edit: grammer"
CodeGeass,1km1pp,sexyagentdingdong,5,Sun Aug 18 16:54:06 2013 UTC,"the symbol on the top right mysteriously vanishes when it cuts to lelouch..  So, Its fake"
CodeGeass,1km1pp,mikkomikk,2,Sun Aug 18 22:32:45 2013 UTC,I watched the Japanese version before the English dub and I am pretty confident that this is not true. It sounds like someone took one of Lelouches chuckles and just shopped an image together and then added it to the end of the scene. It sounds like the audio does not follow. Also the creator of Code Geass assured everyone that Lelouche did die and I am inclined to believe him.
CodeGeass,1km1pp,acesilver1,5,Sun Aug 18 17:49:40 2013 UTC,"The creator said that Lelouch died.  However, he never said that he stayed dead.  Charles died and came back.  C.C. died and came back.  I think the true meaning of what the creator was talking about was more about the entire meaning of what Lelouch was sacrificing.  He had to die so everyone's hate will forever be cast onto him.  He never talked about him staying dead."
CodeGeass,1km1pp,Nobutadas,0,Tue Aug 20 20:03:35 2013 UTC,"awe, but we can still hope that he can talk with cc"
CodeGeass,1km1pp,redkiller4all,2,Sun Aug 18 18:29:44 2013 UTC,"I know. I wish he had lived too. There was this theory that when Charles grabbed Lelouche by the neck, the Code transferred from Charles to Lelouche and that Lelouche knew he wouldn't die but he would be immortal with CC. But... The creator said he did die :("
CodeGeass,1km1pp,acesilver1,0,Sun Aug 18 18:52:00 2013 UTC,"i hoping in the new anime there is something that involves lelouch, but i'm going to wait till funimation dubs it so i can hear the voices that im use to."

Its like hellsing ultimate where instead of 30 minute episode each one is a hour long. I'm waiting for the dub to come out but from what i have gathered, It is in the same universe as code geass but many years after R2. I first thought nunnally was in it and grown up and in charge (but reading on it i guess i was wrong). One thing is there is a boy who looks ALOT like lelouch.   But what I hope is lelouch will come into play at a later episode and do his thing and have a huge plot twist."

CodeGeass,1km1pp,TxXxF,0,Fri Sep 27 00:38:44 2013 UTC,If thats the case then why are the mechs SO much more advance then the ones is r2.
CodeGeass,1km1pp,redkiller4all,1 point,Fri Sep 27 00:54:33 2013 UTC,"My guess would be that it just is because it is newer like in the new starwars trillogy, ships actually look more modern or evolved.  sources for this are code geass the original series wich play in 2017 (R1) and 2018 (R2) where new serie states to play in 2017.  Unless they stated something wrong i should be right."
CodeGeass,1km1pp,TxXxF,0,Fri Sep 27 01:13:57 2013 UTC,"hm, alright. Thanks for the info but i will bring up that in a Japanese magazine there was a page about code geass and it had older looking versons of suzaku and lelouch, But who knows."
CodeGeass,1km1pp,redkiller4all,0,Fri Sep 27 01:29:38 2013 UTC,He most certainly died. That doesn't mean he's dead. Charles and CC both had to die for their Codes to activate.

CodeGeass,1km1pp,redkiller4all,3,Mon Aug 19 16:14:27 2013 UTC,"However, Marianna was still alive.  She was just in someone else's heart.  Thus, Lelouch must be there with C.C.  Though Lelouch died like the creator said, he came back to life."
CodeGeass,1km1pp,redkiller4all,0,Tue Aug 20 20:04:35 2013 UTC,i fully beleave c.c can talk to lelouch. He unlocked the full power of geass. Talking to c.c shouldnt be all that hard for him.

CodeGeass,1k3poa,The_dog_says,3,Sat Aug 10 19:46:22 2013 UTC,I think its on the line that she realizes that Charles and Marian are creating the ragnarok connection for their own selfish reasons.

CodeGeass,1ij4oj,DontMatterStillKarma,14,Thu Jul 18 02:14:39 2013 UTC,"There's evidence to support either side of the argument.  Some, myself included, argue that Lelouch stole his father's code as he grabbed his throat in C's world and he had already planned the zero requiem, or at least toyed with the idea beforehand. His father's code gave him all he needed to put the zero requiem into action, ending everything while allowing him to fake his death and escape scott free. This is further supported by the title of the series.  Lelouch posses both the code and geass at the same time.  The code remained inactive until he was killed for the first time allowing him to preserve his geass until he no longer needed it.   Another major piece of evidence is the pink crane next to CC in the last scene.  The origami crane was Nunnally's creation and therefore highly precious to Lelouch.  It doesn't make sense for it to be with CC because she never had a connection to Nunnally.  It's interesting to listen to both sides of the argument so I'd recommend a few google searches to research it a bit yourself.  There's a ton of evidence for both death and life that I'm not covering."
CodeGeass,1ij4oj,sean151,8,Thu Jul 18 03:18:30 2013 UTC,"Also, I don't think Jeremiah would be okay with just letting Lelouch die. He already felt bad about Lady Marianne dying on his watch."
CodeGeass,1ij4oj,Lark_vi_Britannia,1 point,Thu Jul 18 03:35:15 2013 UTC,Yeah I don't think even his LOYALTY would override his need to keep lelouch alive
CodeGeass,1ij4oj,Arbalor,1 point,Fri Jul 19 06:28:00 2013 UTC,"When he's in the thought elevator and Charles grabs lelouch, does something happen that I missed where his code was stolen or does Charles disintegrate because his code was stolen? And now that you mention it the crane makes sense"
CodeGeass,1ij4oj,megacookie,4,Thu Jul 18 03:30:07 2013 UTC,"Charles disintegrates because Lelouch's command to the Gods was to ensure their own survival. Since Charles and Marianne were in the process of using the Sword of Akasha (that whole mechanical contraption stage thing) and the Ragnorak Connection (The twisted double helix skull thingy) to destroy the Gods that reside in C's World (""Jupiter"" looking planet), they acted to remove the threat to their existence thus ""dissolving"" and likely absorbing Lelouch's mom and dad. Basically the only way to kill an immortal without stealing their code...which begs the question, if Lelouch ""killed"" Charles without stealing his code, does it still get imprinted onto him when Charles grabbed his throat, or does it disappear with him?"
CodeGeass,1ij4oj,sydneygamer,1 point,Thu Jul 18 21:42:08 2013 UTC,"I agree to your theory but I'd like to expand on it a bit. After taking Charlie's code he gave it to Suzaku, making him the perfect choice to take over as Zero as he is both one of the most incredibly skilled mech pilots in the world and now immortal meaning that he could kill anyone trying to destroy the world peace created by the Zero Requiem. This is supported by the fact that he survived he explosion of his mech after his final battle with Kallen even though there's no evidence he ejected.   This is also so that Lelouch could complete his contract with C.C. and take her code."
CodeGeass,1ij4oj,sean151,3,Thu Jul 18 23:48:03 2013 UTC,"That's been highly debated throughout the internet as well, while I'm fond of this idea the obvious challenging point is that Suzaku already had the geass command to live and it would have been a bit redundant.  Not to mention Lelouch never had an opportunity and to give him his code before the fight with Kallen nor was it ever implied; that is up until the scene in the church in the flashback during Lelouch's death.  This is the scene that is marked as the point Suzaku would have received a code (if he did at all).  The main scene to analyze would be Lelouch's death.  We never see the red glow in his eyes that is the geass compelling him to live. This might indicate that he has a code and the geass command is canceled out because he can't die.  However if memory serves, you don't see his face inside the mask when he is evading the protection Lelouch has around him which is when the geass command would have been active. (granted the whole thing was rigged from the beginning).  Again just some of the evidence here. If I debated the entire thing I'd spend hours on it."
CodeGeass,1ij4oj,ReoRak,1 point,Fri Jul 19 01:28:49 2013 UTC,"There also the part when he lays dying in Nunnally's arms to consider; While Nunnally has been shown to have the ability to tell when someone is lying, the only other point in the show where a person's memories are shown like that to another is when C.C. is touched while activating her code to stop Suzaku."
CodeGeass,1ij4oj,sean151,1 point,Fri Jul 19 01:57:49 2013 UTC,"Oh yes, I don't know how this slipped my mind.  The only people in the series to ever be able to share memories are people in possession of a code.  There was some supernatural/non-human power involved in that moment.  Geass is ruled out since Lelouch's can't preform this action and there is no other conceivable means for this to take place."
CodeGeass,1ij4oj,megacookie,3,Fri Jul 19 02:11:07 2013 UTC,"The writers and director said Lelouch died, but the work itself would argue the contrary. Maybe the spinoff will shed some light, maybe not."
CodeGeass,1ij4oj,Lark_vi_Britannia,1 point,Fri Jul 19 00:43:24 2013 UTC,"I think people have been asking the same question for 4-5 years, but it's still a good one. It's been mentioned in the original Japanese version the scene with C.C in the horse cart had a shot showing Lelouch as the driver, but in the later showings and dub it's not there, because the creators wanted it to be open ended. I think the ending would be more complete and would offer more closure and satisfaction if he's dead, but I just know there's no way his plan would guarantee peace on Earth permanently, and in the world of fan fictions and extremely wishful thinking of being a third season, having Lelouch return as an immortal would be epic!"

CodeGeass,1gsqiw,RS19,3,Fri Jun 21 15:17:34 2013 UTC,Should of written the title myself instead of generating it. It's a preview for Code Geass Akito the Exiled episode 2.
CodeGeass,1gsqiw,jinnyjuice,2,Fri Jun 21 15:19:13 2013 UTC,"Awesome! September 14!? I can't wait that long!    Here are some bits of translations:  Female voice (that may sound like C2): For what reason do you live for?  Older boy: Die, Akito  Younger Akito: No  3x  Creepy guy's voice (probably Xin?): to think that you are still alive... (didn't know that you were still alive... etc.)  Man's voice: New Mikhail's Knighthood (or clan or whatever) Xin Hyuga Shine(spelling?) is... (cuts off)  Orange hair guy: I want to war already~  Akito (I think?): They will start a conflict  Leyla: I will also charge forth  Some man's voice: You're a little crazy (you're too wild/bad/etc. or something like I can't handle your level)  Woman's voice: What were you doing until now (somewhat unclear)!?  Man's voice: For sure, (someone) is/are going to regret  Man's voice: It's really exciting (kinda evil way)  Female voice: Without reason, just conquer  Female voice: CODE GEASS BOUKOKUNO AKITO (fuck yeah!)    You know, Suzaku was shown in previous PV as well, but didn't show up in episode 1 (right?). I wonder if he will really show up here.  It seems like my predictions in this thread (no spoilers?) were a little better than I expected.  The older boy is probably Xin, probably older brother of Akito. I'd change my prediction a bit; when younger Xin told younger Akito to die, Akito defied the Geass (similar to how Geass was semi-defied in original series) and continues to do so until he finishes something that he must do. In the end, I can only imagine the two brothers going into conflict, heavy dialogue about Geass, then maybe ultimately getting rid of Xin's Geass by killing him or something.  I still have no idea why that Knightmare would be in outer space at the end... also shown in previous PV."

CodeGeass,1g682s,BillBoyTM,6,Wed Jun 12 03:29:46 2013 UTC,"I'm currently reading it but as someone who is a much bigger fan of Code Geass than SAO, it's starting to feel like a longer and slower retelling of SAO but simply from the perspective of someone who was once Lelouch Vi Britannia but right now, in hiding and without Geass, simply another player stuck in the game. I'm hoping it picks up and shows more of Lelouch's character and back story show through. It's still a good read so far."
CodeGeass,1g682s,megacookie,1 point,Wed Jun 12 14:10:30 2013 UTC,"I don't know how far you are, so I won't say much because I don't want to spoil anything. But Lelouch does run into other people from Code Geass during the story, and every encounter provides some backstory to what Lelouch did before/after the rebellion was resolved with his ""death"". While I've only seen him run into two people he knows from CG in-game, I'm sure the author will continue to elaborate on how Lelouch deals with hiding his true identity from other players and people he knows. As the fanfiction takes place in the world of SAO, I still feel that Lelouch is being developed and explained pretty well. I hope you are enjoying it so far!   Edit: The author has written other Code Geass crossovers, but I haven't gotten around to those yet. So if SAO isn't really your thing, you may want to check out his other stories, becuase you might find CG crossed over with an anime that you like more than SAO."
CodeGeass,1g682s,megacookie,1 point,Wed Jun 12 14:30:23 2013 UTC,"I think I'll stick with it, the pace is a bit slow so far, but that's more like an actual novel and not just a short, rushed story. I've read or am currently following several CG fanfics but only one or two crossovers. For some reason although I'd like to think I prefer action stories to romance, I tend to gravitate towards the romantic ones because that was one thing that the anime never allowed to develop: Lelouch's love interests. Action was already there in bucket loads."
CodeGeass,1g682s,megacookie,1 point,Wed Jun 12 16:22:45 2013 UTC,"Thats why I like this story too. It is like a novel, which makes it slow at times. I also like seeing Lelouch forming a love interest towards Argo. Like you said, there wasn't much love coming from Lelouch in Code Geass, so it's interesting to watch him develop in that aspect. The downside is that the author hasn't updated this for a good while, and I don't know if he/she will anytime soon. /: However I was notified by the website that the author did just update another one of their stories less than 10 days ago, so that may mean the author is still working on writing and may get around to writing another chapter of The Violet Devil."

CodeGeass,1fn234,seiriyu,10,Tue Jun 4 08:04:26 2013 UTC,"Ooh, sorry to say, but /u/ajew92 made a good try.  To answer your question /u/seiriyu, it's actually Lelouch making a mistake because he was trying to convince Suzaku to join Lelouch while he was Zero (where Suzaku went back to trial after being rescued by Zero), but Suzaku was being stubborn even while he is being Lelouch. Because of this mistake, that's why Lelouch said something along the lines of ""nevermind"" (in the video, it became translated as ""oh... um..."") to hide his identity as Zero and Suzaku was confused.  ""Mae"" means before or front. ""Kono"" as /u/Cruxette brought up, means this (as a subject, not object). ""Kono mae"" means ""before this."""
CodeGeass,1fn234,jinnyjuice,3,Wed Jun 5 21:10:53 2013 UTC,"Ok, so Lelouch was just like almost letting it slip that he had talked to him before as Zero. THANK YOU.  Even after watching this series at least 2 or 3 times a year I learn things."

CodeGeass,1fn234,ajew92,3,Thu Jun 6 13:43:14 2013 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure, and this is just a theory I just came up with, but it seems that the Japanese word for ""before"" is ""mae"" (so says the Google translator) and my guess is that the translator for this episode just kinda messed this up. Or perhaps decided to use ""before"" because saying ""you"" wouldn't make sense for a response in English since we don't have a harsh version of ""you"". As to why he was taken aback, I think he was just confused as to why Lelouch would use such a harsh way to address him in normal conversation, but he sure got over it quickly."

CodeGeass,1fk8ng,HelpImOnRedditAgain,2,Mon Jun 3 04:19:22 2013 UTC,"Well, regardless of whether or not you believe it, the bible is a very successful book with regards to impacting the world and how many people read it.  It's also pretty much impossible/highly uncommon to have a perfectly original character/plot. Authors borrow from other sources, consciously or not.   Combine these two facts, and it's easy to see why we get biblical-esque plots and Jesus figures in pop culture pretty often.   TVtropes agrees with you on Lelouch being a Jesus figure: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype  Though they also note that he's maybe more along the lines of a Dark Messiah: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah  I'd agree with Lelouch being a Dark Messiac Jesus Figure. He's a brutal, miracle working protagonist who believes that the ends justify the means. He's definitely not a straight-cut hero, but he's not quite a villain.  This isn't too uncommon a trope to use, though. Like I said, the bible has massive influence, if only as a very successful book. And if you know a certain type of character sells well, might as well use it!  (This is also probably why we're seeing so many games/shows/books as of late about parallel worlds. Cool genre, sells nice. Jesus figures are good too, though.)"
CodeGeass,1fk8ng,Oxirane,10,Tue Jun 4 01:55:50 2013 UTC,"Although OP is a little off, there is a single point that remains somewhat valid.  Jesus Christ and Lelouch both took upon ALL of the sins of the world and died with them to save the world.  The similarities basically ends there.  Lelouch was nothing like Jesus Christ; he faltered, he made mistakes, he had no divine calling or sovereignty, he was calculating and manipulative."

If Shriley hadn't died, Lelouch would not have hunted down Geass users. His mentality would remain stable and he would be on good terms with Tohdoh. I think he would have accomplished his own goal of seceding from the Holy Britannian Empire. He wouldn't feel the need for a balls to the wall war with Britannia, and with his allies that he was continuously amassing, a victory was in sight.  Shirley's death seemed to make Lelouch a little screwy. I got the impression that he lost control of pretty much everything after she died.

CodeGeass,1eold5,dasunshine,12,Mon May 20 07:51:26 2013 UTC,"Kallen was codenamed ""Q1"" for a reason, I truly think she would be Lelouch's Queen even including all major characters not just within the Black Knights.  Lelouch really couldnt use Suzaku as a 'piece' as he would tend to end up playing in enemy hands, constantly being the thorn in the side of Zero, and had a personal vendetta against him for killing Euphie. When they did come to terms it was mutual, no manipulation required. Thus Lelouch never really played Suzaku as a piece, even though Britannia surely did.  As for C.C, she'd see through any of Lelouch's plans on using her in a second, mainly because she's probably had a lot of experience being used over the centuries. So she's really a free spirit who, if anything, has control over Lelouch both in the sense of his obligation to fulfill her contract, and acting on her own accord to keep Lelouch safe (when she's not cuddling Cheese-Kun and shovelling down endless pizzas with Lelouch's money). If anything, she's the person who gave Lelouch the chess kit and taught him the rules.  Charles (and later Schneizel): Enemy King, for all too obvious reasons.  Cornelia: Enemy Queen, she was a master strategist in her own right, but her fearsome power both in the forces at her command and her own battle strength make her easily Queen material.  Knights of the Round (and Guilford): ...They are enemy Knights. Duh.  Black Knights: The strong and smart ones Lelouch valued could be knights, but his overall control over them makes them all pawn worthy too. But I doubt the core members were as disposable as say the JLF or countless anonymous soldiers who are the true pawns.  Jeremiah and Rolo: I can see them being good bishops. Powerful but very specialized in their abilities thanks to Geass. Extremely loyal, even though not long ago they were enemy bishops.   Lloyd and Rackshata: Rooks, because after all, they are the ones who build the powerhouses: Lancelot and Guren."
CodeGeass,1eold5,megacookie,2,Mon May 27 22:35:36 2013 UTC,"I really like your assessment of the hierarchy.  The only disagreement I have is over whether or not Lelouche ""used"" Suzaku.  Now certainly Suzaku had just cause for despising Zero and wanted to take down Lelouche, but Lelouche has a superior intellect to Suzaku.  As evidenced by most of R2, Lelouche's plans relied heavily on having Suzaku on his side, and without manipulating him into his role in the Zero Requiem, Lelouche's plans wouldn't have come to fruition.  As for which piece he represents, that's harder to determine.  In some ways his unpredictability makes him risky to use in battle, which parallels the dangers of using the king in battle.  This scenario would also leave Lelouche open to being the chess player rather than a piece, which makes some sense.  Still, unlike the king chess piece, Lelouche was not trying to protect Suzaku.  Secondly, he says in the first episode that the king must lead if he expects others to follow, and Suzaku certainly didn't lead.  His utility in battle equals Kallen, who many have agreed must be the queen.  Unfortunately, no other piece equates the value of the queen in chess UNLESS he began as a pawn and eventually came so far as to reach the opposite side of the board and become a second queen."
CodeGeass,1eold5,megacookie,1 point,Sun Jun 2 06:57:08 2013 UTC,"Hmm, the risky (and difficult) strategy of advancing a pawn to the enemy side then gaining a queen seems pretty apt. Lelouch certainly had to work to make Suzaku one of his pieces, especially considering he was on the white (Britannian) side for most of the game."
CodeGeass,1eold5,LelouchViBrittania,14,Sun Jun 2 12:08:45 2013 UTC,Lelouch is obviously the king  C.C. is the Queen. The Knights would be Suzaku and Kallen.  The Bishops would be Lloyd and Reid. The Rooks would be Todoh and Jerimiah.   Everyone else is a pawn. Personal opinion of course.
CodeGeass,1eold5,ReoRak,5,Sat May 25 19:50:43 2013 UTC,Replace Lloyd with Rolo and I'm with you.
CodeGeass,1eold5,sydneygamer,5,Mon May 27 14:56:53 2013 UTC,Don't you know that Lloyd is the David Bowie of Code Geass?
CodeGeass,1eold5,TromboneSniper,5,Wed May 29 11:51:18 2013 UTC,"I kind of feel if we try to compare code geass characters to chess we cant encompass the entire series, instead we should focus on certain battles and who was on each side during certain times. For example for R2 pre- dark knight rebellion I would say kings would be Lelouch and Snizal, Queens: Kallen and Suzaku, the rest of the britanian pieces would probably focus on the knights of the round, whilst the black knights forces would be todoh, jerimiah, Xingke, Rolo, and maybe Sayoko, or Diethard"
CodeGeass,1eold5,Silvadream,3,Fri May 31 02:19:43 2013 UTC,Suzaku I think would be LeLouche's queen because he's the most useful piece and also the best at fighting.

CodeGeass,1emdpp,Belazor,11,Mon May 20 00:30:49 2013 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, Nunnally actually is crippled. It's just the blindness that was caused by Geass"

CodeGeass,1emdpp,munsosl8,2,Mon May 20 03:12:29 2013 UTC,How did I miss that?
CodeGeass,1emdpp,Shafalabaz,9,Mon May 20 07:17:58 2013 UTC,"My issue with this, you see Suzaku still under Lelouche's Live command even though had he taken Charles's code he would be immune to Geass and immortal.  My idea on Charles's code is that C.C. could hold 2 codes. Charles nearly took hers so why couldn't she have an additional code somewhere on her.  The Lancelot never had an eject system in place, I'm wondering if Lloyd equipped it with some other way for the user to escape as a last resort, it seemed like Lloyd knew something of what Lelouche was planning to do, especially with how they parted. Lloyd got thrown in jail after Lelouche took Damocles as a ruse to make sure he and Mina didn't get harshly punished for creating the Fleya because they tried to help in the end.  After Lelouche takes Damocles he takes Charles's code from C.C. passes on to Suzaku the mask of Zero and parades about prepared to feign death. When Zero ""slays"" Lelouche and Lelouche falls to Nunnally she touches him and sees all the memories because that's what code holders can do as shown so many times by C.C.  So in the end, Suzaku is Zero who is set upon creating a lasting peace in the world. Lelouche is on the Sword of Akasha communicating with C.C. experiencing the world through her with the ability to take her life whenever she wishes and also immortal so if the world ever falls into peril and strife again he can rise up as Zero or another figure and bring about peace again. The rest of the world lives on without knowing this. Kallen can suspect that Zero is actually Suzaku but I'm guessing that helmet doesn't get removed much afterwards. Schneizel must follow Zero's commands because of Lelouche's Geass, Nunnally is appointed ruler of Britannia which joins the UN under fair conditions and Japan repairs the destruction wrought about by the war. Everything is peaceful and time marches on like Lelouche wanted."
CodeGeass,1emdpp,Nobutadas,8,Mon May 20 07:21:31 2013 UTC,"This is all wrong.  Suzaku received the Geass order from Lelouch to ""live on"". When Lelouch (as Zero) and Suzaku fought the Chinese Federation, Suzaku nearly died. Lelouch told him to live on so that they could push back the Chinese forces. However, Suzaku might eventually be able to overcome the Geass order, as did Nanaly. Nanaly overcame Charles's memory-altering Geass and remembered that she was not blind. Suzaku might be able to overcome Lelouch's order and die.  Lelouch received Charles's code. Since he didn't take his contractor's (C.C.'s code), he got to keep his Geass powers and become immortal. When Suzaku stabbed Emperor Lelouch as part of the Zero Requiem, since Lelouch had Charles's code he survived. Now everyone, including Nanaly, believes that he is dead. In the epilogue, you see C.C. riding in a carriage. The carriage driver is Lelouch. C.C. even addresses Lelouch by name at the end of her monologue while looking in the carriage driver's direction.  So pretty much Suzaku is protected by the order of ""live on,"" and Lelouch is immortal with Geass powers.  Also Jeremiah Gottwald and Anya now own an orange farm."
CodeGeass,1emdpp,Shafalabaz,7,Sat Jun 1 02:10:58 2013 UTC,"This is what I came here to say.  On top of this, Lelouch had to die to activate the code.  The deal with the code is once you get it, it's still dormant until you die.  Let me explain this more.  When you have the active code, Geass doesn't affect you.  However, after Charles took V.V. code, Lelouch was able to tell him to kill himself.  This was because the code wasn't active yet.  After he died, he became reborn with the code active.    The same thing had to happen to C.C. when she was killed by the mob.  She became reborn with the Code active."
CodeGeass,1emdpp,megacookie,-1,Fri Jun 14 18:37:10 2013 UTC,"That's true, but if Lelouch wanted to end the Zero Requiem differently, or keep ruling as Emperor, he could have just gone somewhere private, shot himself in the head, been reborn, and saved everyone a lot of trouble."
CodeGeass,1emdpp,Kerrigor2,8,Mon Jun 24 20:35:25 2013 UTC,"A truly refreshing take on what would usually be a beaten to death case of ""Lelouch took Charles' code and is immortal"" or ""Nobody took Charles' code and Lelouch is dead"". Lelouch taking C.C's code also explains why she seems almost happy and carefree at the end. If she were still immortal and Lelouch dead, that would mean she neither gets her wish of death and the man she loved is gone while she remains. That would be depressing."

CodeGeass,1e5z7f,jinnyjuice,2,Sun May 12 03:29:33 2013 UTC,"It is an interesting interpretation, but the connection is honestly a bit of a stretch.  In my opinion, the primary influence on the ""Consciousness Ascension"" from Code Geass was likely the Human Instrumentality Project featured in the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. I would argue that in both cases the creators were describing a spiritual transformation rather than a future political utopia.  We of course never actually see Charles's plan implemented, but we do see Instrumentality pulled off in Evangelion.  As you can see in this video here, when everyone's souls are united in the Human Instrumentality Project, their bodies are dissolved into orange liquid (reflecting that eastern cultures don't necessarily subscribe to the same mind-body dichotomy found in western cultures).  Likewise, you can't assume that there would be any ""limbs"" to act as labor after Charles's plan was fulfilled if everyone loses their body."

But I doubt that the Borderlands 2 producers put him in as a reference to Code Geass. (If someone has supporting evidence of an actual relationship between the two, please prove me wrong, as I'd like to see a character double as well!) Also, if anything, the Borderlands 2 Zero looks more like Silver Crow (From the Accel World Anime) than he resembles Zero from Code Geass. Nontheless, I still like seeing a similarity, (the name and the helmet) between the two. All Hail Britannia!"
CodeGeass,1e5hct,BillBoyTM,5,Tue May 14 22:45:53 2013 UTC,It could be a reference to Suzaku as Zero. The Assassin could refer to him killing Lelouch.

When the Black Knights were going to shoot him and he lied in order to upset Kallen (who would have otherwise tried to protect him and get caught in the line of fire), he said only loud enough for her to hear that she should live on. I think that's when she began to suspect that heartless, traitorous manipulator is yet another mask and false identity that he wore and not his true self. Still, she doesnt jump ship and accepts that he is the enemy, whatever his motives are. It's when she's fighting Suzaku, who mentions that there is something he and Lelouch must do that in retrospect helped her put the pieces of the puzzle together."

Generally those seriously studying chess are under the tutelage of one who has been awarded one of these titles.

CodeGeass,1cyydx,Kerrigor2,6,Tue May 14 00:34:15 2013 UTC,"Yeah I think that may inevitably happen but perhaps its because world peace is seen as such an impossible goal to ourselves in our current lives. I believe that there would certainly be internal problems like criminals, power-hungry officials and other internal threats. But a nation with no external threats would operate a lot more differently to a nation with external threats. Also assuming the empire is organised into a UFN style nation to allow democracy, then the black knights would be the only standing army.  Another interesting question is how politics (i.e. left & right wing parties) would co-operate in this world nation. Ultimately, everyone can't have their own way so how to the people who lose out react? What is the class system like?"
CodeGeass,1cyydx,Kerrigor2,7,Wed Apr 24 00:31:38 2013 UTC,"Also seeing how short Lelouch's empire lasted, you suppose the old nobility system of the Britannian empire would come back?

Similarly, how would the Britannian royalty like Nunnally or Cornelia play a role in the UFN? They stay as nobility or have to be democratically elected?"

That's the United States of Japan, or the Black Knights or whoever, welcoming Britannia into the UFN. It's on the wiki, so I guess it's been confirmed somewhere along the road.  It's make sense for her to be the Empress. She's the one with the big dream to make the world a peaceful place, and Zero would have reinforced her claim to the throne, and given the state of awe they'd be in after he killed Lelouch, they'd probably do anything he suggested. The only living members of the family at that point are Schneizal, Cornelia and Nunnally. Schneizal's Zero's puppet, Cornelia never seemed the type to want the throne, so that leaves the line of succession to Nunnally. I don't know if her becoming Empress was part of the Zero Requiem, but I can only guess that Suzaku would have put everything he had into making her Empress, considering the Zero Requiem was about making the world into Nunnally's vision."

Of course, both eventually spread to both eyes.   Also, I'm not sure, but I think V.V.'s code also exclusively appears on the right hand whereas C.C.'s is on the forehead.   I'm hoping the new season (R1.5 or whatever we're calling it) delves deeper into the nature of Codes and Geass... or maybe an R3 set far in the future dealing with it. Massive spoiler: I say future, as I'm in the ""Lelouch lives"" camp- Also noteworthy is we don't get a clear shot of Lelouch's right palm after his father dies. At all.

They're relative to their usefullness to Lelouch.  a) Much better understanding of diplomacy. I imagine his tactical skills are contained within combat.  b) It's not really known how intelligent Kallen is, but she offers no knowledge or experience in useful matters. She's grade school smart, not diplomatic smart.  c) Tamaki's loyal to Ogi, not Zero. Lelouch recognizes this. His opinion hinges on Ogi's opinion of Zero throughout the show."

Lelouch was a liar through to the end, but he realized that he would have to pay a real price for all of his manipulation and deception, for intentional or not, the blood of millions was on his hands. If he had planned to fake his death then live a new life with C.C, he would have an immense guilt for eternity that he cheated his fate and that the entire world's peace was built on yet another lie. Lelouch desired justice for his actions, but once his goal of world peace was set in sight (versus just keeping Nunnaly in safe hands), he had to continue to drop blame on others and commit evils or it would all be for nought. Accepting that responsibility to atone right at the end is what solidified in my mind that Lelouch remained a good person and had not totally succumbed to his powers (political, supernatural, and intellectual alike)."

Remember how people with the immortality code could lock in their memories? I think Lelouch locked away almost all of his memories excluding the ones that shape his personality and his memories of C2.  That way, ""Lelouch"" died, but he could still live on immortal forever happy with C2. Something along those lines atleast."

Then when she died, she transferred the Code over to Lulu. Therefore, he is immortal, so they faked his death(I think) and put him into one of the containers C.C was in at the start.. Then, he says his goodbyes and leaves the world in a peace state and tells them that whenever the world is in trouble, awaken him.. Not sure how long it is in the future, but, they wake him up and one of his descendants needs his help to put the world back into order.. That's where it ends..

CodeGeass,1c4zvu,megacookie,5,Thu Apr 11 16:09:52 2013 UTC,Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a pretty universally well liked series. I would definitely recommend it.
CodeGeass,1c4zvu,BKS37,2,Fri Apr 12 20:52:17 2013 UTC,I'm finishing this up right now. It's good but not in the same way Code:Geass is good.
CodeGeass,1c4zvu,Chimneythinker,1 point,Tue May 28 06:40:07 2013 UTC,"Jus finished Gundam 00, it shares alotta the same themes. Its obviously not as good as code geass, but if you like your mech animes with a little suspense and political intrigue then it's worth the watch"
CodeGeass,1c4zvu,M_Toro,1 point,Mon Jul 1 07:06:41 2013 UTC,Ao no Exorcist. Basically a bunch of people fighting demons. Amazing action and a balance of feels and humor. If it had more episodes and characters (which the manga does) it would almost be on par with Code Geass.
CodeGeass,1c4zvu,Shafalabaz,1 point,Tue Jul 23 03:03:54 2013 UTC,Legend of the Galactic Heroes is by far my favorite Anime.  If you liked CG I would recommend watching it for sure.
CodeGeass,1c4zvu,LotGH,1 point,Mon Apr 29 03:31:17 2013 UTC,"Some notable dubs: FMA: Brotherhood, Stein's Gate (fascinating story involving time travel), and I've heard great things about Cowboy Bebop but have never seen it.  If you don't mind subs: I really enjoyed Sword Art Online (first episode here) and am currently watching Blast of Tempest, the first episode of which can also be found on crunchy.  The most similar to DN/CG in terms of thought would probably be Stein's Gate, but my personal favorite is Brotherhood."
CodeGeass,1c4zvu,TristanBlake,-1,Wed May 15 16:55:44 2013 UTC,Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) was really awesome.
CodeGeass,1c4zvu,Silvadream,0,Thu May 2 17:45:41 2013 UTC,"code geass is my favorite anime as well, biggest masterpiece i have seen in my life so far. anyways i think following animes come pretty similar in some points:  guilty crown (you can actually feel the similarity to code geass since it was made by the same producers if i am not mistaken)  mirai nikki (might be a little weird, seems a bit trashy in the beginning but the twist close to the end makes this anime absolutely worth it)"
CodeGeass,1c4zvu,DWeee,0,Tue Apr 16 23:03:25 2013 UTC,Gundam Seed. Basically a dry run of Code Geass.

One of our strongest instincts is to not kill/protect each other.   Also, the time to shoot might have cost him his life. The geass isn't V.A.T.S. It made a rash decision to accomplish it's goal. Another person dying has nothing to do with you living when you're bombarded by artillery."
CodeGeass,1bnpjh,I_command_you,7,Thu Apr 4 13:12:08 2013 UTC,"Set 10 years after the end of R2, a decade of relative peace and renewal for the world, afforded by the Zero Requiem and Lelouch's sacrifice. Suzaku has played his role of Zero II well, but not being able to show his face in public as a dead man yet dealing with the tremendous stress of managing the Black Knights, being the right hand man and advisor to Empress Nunnaly leaves him constantly worn out and stressed. He has begun making mistakes recently, not responding to terrorist threats and minor conflicts with the same charisma and efficiency that he used to.   His ability to assess and analyze a critical situation was almost on par with Lelouch's, but recently he has begun to lose credibility for decisions that have resulted in major errors by the Black Knights: sending a squadron of KMFs to take out what was supposed to be an international drug ring resulted in dozens of civilian deaths, an ill prepared team was dispatched to take out a mafia resulting in the capture of a rather highly ranked Black Knights member and secret military equipment falling into the wrong hands. Some members have begun doubting this Zero, including Kallen who is of the few to know Zero's true identity and is second in command. With the world's #1 global police force and largest independent millitary (Black Knights) under struggling leadership, the peace has started to erode as both internal and external disputes and conflicts begin to worm their way out of the woodwork.   Meanwhile, a secret Geass society consisting of several Code Bearers from around the world is set to develop a new strain of the Geass power which can be spread person to person and bestows certain superhuman abilities and an extreme desire for bloodlust when remotely triggered. These ""infected"" people have been integrated into society but are in a dormant state. The Society of code bearers wishes to destroy world peace, have the most powerful militaries turn on each other, thus reducing the ability to cope with the sudden ""Zombie invasion"" that would threaten the human population as a whole. However, while the ground work is laid out, every Code Bearer in existance needs to simultaneously activate the second nature of their code at the same time or else the infected targets will never awaken to their abilities and evil intentions. All of the Code Bearers have been captured and assembled...but 2.   Enter Lelouch and C.C, who have been on the run hiding from the Society for 5 years, all the while infiltrating its remote bases gaining intel and halting progress. The Society does not know their identities, until they happen upon an orange farm located in the middle of nowhere where they detect a strong and artificial presence of Geass: Jeremiah's Geass cancelling device. Jeremiah is captured but manages to help Anya escape to warn C.C (even with Marianne gone she still has a residual connection to C's world and can communicate with her). Jeremiah is taken prisoner and is tortured, eventually giving away Lelouch's identity when injected with an enhanced version of Refrain, a drug supposedly eradicated over 9 years ago.   Lelouch and C.C travel as stowaways until they reach Britannia, in search of Suzaku to warn him of the impeding crisis. He finds Zero after breaking into his personal residence at the outskirts of Pendragon City, but it's not as expected: The person behind the Zero mask is in fact Kallen! Kallen has taken on the role of substitute Zero while Suzaku headed on a solo mission (in the latest top secret prototype Lancelot variant, naturally) even unbeknownst to the rest of the Black Knights. Suzaku has discovered about the Society on his own and has gone on a diplomatic mission to negotiate with them and avoid bloodshed on either side. Of course, he too is disguised as Zero, not that many would recognize him as former Knight of Zero Sir Suzaku Kururugi because of the extensive facial reconstruction surgery he has had done allowing him to blend in to the civilian world without all of the attention Zero would bring. But the Society was adament Zero be the one who should come and Kallen could not convince that crazy bastard to let anyone other than himself take his place.   However, just as she has gotten over the shock of finding Lelouch alive after being dead for 10 years, Kallen gets an emergency distress voice recorded message on the phone linked only to Suzaku's: ""It was a trap! Ambushed by 20 KMFs, each as powerful as the Lancelot, my personal guards betrayed me. I don't think I'll make it, warn the others. A war is inevitab-----static----"". With no choice left and time precious, Lelouch convinces Kallen to let him become the role of Zero once again, as his intel on Society's evil plan and their location may be their only chance of stopping a potential world apocalypse. Having the Power of The King and immortality helps too.   And this is all I can think of right now, building up to the main battle, gotta involve some of the other original characters of CG while incorporating some new ones. Lots of Knightmare fighting of overpowered proportions, Lelouch mind games back in full swing, maybe some love interest stuff happening on the side (C.CXKallen jealousy over Lulu just for kicks, even though Kallen most likely has gotten married by now), Tamaki being a dumbass as usual, Nina being creepy and brilliantly smart as usual, whatever it takes to make it entertaining and awesome."
CodeGeass,1bnpjh,megacookie,5,Fri Apr 12 04:28:42 2013 UTC,"Love the thought processes put into this, though I would disagree that kallen would get married to anyone but lelouch however maybe her and susaku could have a symbolic relationship despite both still loving their dead significant other. Just putting that forward."
CodeGeass,1bnpjh,TromboneSniper,2,Sat Apr 13 01:04:42 2013 UTC,"Yeah, but set 10 years into the future, she'd be almost 30. Lelouch would have wanted her to move on not be stuck in the past grieving him (which is why he didnt allow himself to get romantically involved with her while alive). And I don't think Suzaku ""loved"" Lelouch. He co-operated with him out of necessity and a mutual understanding, but I dont think he could have ever fully forgiven him for everything nor would they really be best friends like they were as kids. But I guess I could see Suzaku and Kallen being sort of a thing, despite the fact the two were always on opposite sides fighting each other throughout the series, even when their allegiances switched towards the end. Regardless, she'd sure get a shock and emotional overload seeing him pop up after being dead for 10 years and still look 18."
CodeGeass,1bnpjh,megacookie,2,Sat Apr 13 01:26:49 2013 UTC,"Sorry should of clarified I meant Suzaku probably would have problems maintaining any relationship after Euphie, not lelouch. Also Kallen would only be 28 if it was only 10 years after the events of R2, wouldn't be unheard of if she would still have a secret love for lelouch. Also the general feeling that being on opposite sides fighting against each other would most certainly set up for some form of relationship between sesaku & kallen"
CodeGeass,1bnpjh,TromboneSniper,1 point,Sat Apr 13 02:31:04 2013 UTC,"Yeah, she would probably always love him, but if he was dead she'd have to move on with her life eventually, even if anyone else would only be #2 to him. Although it's also likely that she never got round to settling down being too busy with the Black Knights."
CodeGeass,1bnpjh,megacookie,4,Sat Apr 13 03:48:28 2013 UTC,"Personally I kind of want a continuation of original design where the world quickly becomes corrupted, susaku as zero has just become a puppet for some new tirranicle government, basically the world isn't turning out how lelouch planned. The Black knights have started to misuse their power and kallen dis-illusioned with the organization left the black knights and left with the guren, with nightmares in hot presuit trying to kill her to prevent her from telling people the information she knows about the organization. Lelouch is basically watching from the side line with CC just observing, until he sees the guren about to get destroyed, to which he makes a new appearance and saves kallen, probably getting gunned down at one point to show his immortality. Later Kallen, after dealing with some mental issues of lelouch being alive, convinces lelouch to recreate zero and to change the world once again, starting a new rebellion, and combating suzaku-zero a few times as he gains more power as zero.  Besides that I kind of want to just see Nina get killed."
CodeGeass,1bnpjh,TromboneSniper,2,Thu Apr 11 02:29:34 2013 UTC,Adding on I think a new interesting power lelouch would use would be making contracts with people to have them develop geass to use in his plans
CodeGeass,1bnpjh,TromboneSniper,1 point,Fri Apr 12 01:08:38 2013 UTC,"My idea would be that it starts from the beginning of series 1 but, it follows an alternate timeline much like FMA and FMA:B. Or another is that he never renounces his title as prince of britannia and doesn't grow up in Japan and has a series based in a different country."
CodeGeass,1bnpjh,JustASadNerd,3,Thu Apr 4 13:15:46 2013 UTC,Meh... I dont think that would really work... After the ending I don't think it would really work out
CodeGeass,1bmc8b,JustASadNerd,22,Wed Apr 3 22:41:45 2013 UTC,"Only Suzaku, Lelouch, Jeremiah, and C.C. knew about it beforehand."

CodeGeass,1bmc8b,KcajE,5,Sun Jun 16 03:58:16 2013 UTC,"They did not know about the plan, only that something was being plotted."
CodeGeass,1bmc8b,LelouchViBrittania,11,Thu Apr 4 11:17:42 2013 UTC,"Suzaku, C.C, and to some extent Jeremiah knew of the Zero Requiem before it happened, though I suspect Jeremiah wasnt told much other than to play his part and let Zero through to Lelouch. In fact, he probably didnt even know who the new Zero would be. Kallen wasnt in on it like the other 3, but she had all the pieces in her head and only realized what she both hoped was true and dreaded at the same time when it happened in front of her eyes. Nunnally, who had no idea what was going on but loved her brother deeply, we are supposed to believe gained access to Lelouch's memories regarding Zero Requiem in the split second when she touched him. As for Kaguya, even if Lelouch was horrible, she probably had latent feelings for him (he was her childhood crush if I remember). And Milly and Rivalz who have only known Lelouch to be their close friend and classmate, never quite wrapped their head around Lelouch being a world conquering emperor. They werent resentful, they just wished it didnt have to be this way. So seeing him killed in public spectacle would be kind of a shaker. But I dont think they knew his plan at all."
CodeGeass,1bmc8b,megacookie,3,Thu Apr 4 16:44:37 2013 UTC,"Thanks, that actually really cleared things up for me and although I still want to believe that all his old friends knew of his old intentions what your saying really makes sense and was well thought out so thanks."
CodeGeass,1bmc8b,hangemhigh420,6,Thu Apr 4 19:41:08 2013 UTC,I'm pretty sure Nunnaly didn't know about Zero Requiem. I think it was only Suzaku and Lelouch that knew. As for Kallen I think she just knew how Lelouch was and knew he was normally behind everything so she just assumed it was his plan all along.
CodeGeass,1bmc8b,Filmjelk,1 point,Thu Apr 4 21:23:47 2013 UTC,When lelouch falls down the ramp to nunally she touches him and see his memories. Nunally definutively knew about it afterwards.

CodeGeass,1bmc8b,blaser22,4,Wed Apr 3 22:55:27 2013 UTC,i also think lloyd knew to a degree. C.C. as well
CodeGeass,1bmc8b,TromboneSniper,1 point,Sun Jul 28 13:08:47 2013 UTC,I was going cam back to say that I also think Sayoko(the ninja maid) and lloyd's assistant knew because after nina developed the anti-fleia lelouch gave them a mission or something like that
CodeGeass,1bmc8b,megacookie,1 point,Thu Apr 4 00:34:08 2013 UTC,I understand that part of it I guess I'm more wondering did anyone else figure it out other than nunnaly and kallen? Hence some of the screaming from people that were close to lelouch/zero
CodeGeass,1bmc8b,akumizzle,2,Thu Apr 4 00:35:03 2013 UTC,Anyone that knew Lelouch well enough would probably have cried or screamed at his death. Only those who knew him solely as the demon emperor and not in person would have been impassive or cheerful (after the initial shock value). Which is the rest of the world.
CodeGeass,1bmc8b,akumizzle,1 point,Wed Apr 3 23:48:08 2013 UTC,Thanks for linking that I had never watched it before and it was pretty good. Other than that picture drama is there any other evidence that lloyd and cecile knew about the plan? I feel like im missing out on something
CodeGeass,1bmc8b,akumizzle,1 point,Thu Apr 4 01:32:26 2013 UTC,Just finished this amazing series. And since my question is related id ask here. How did all the black knights not figure out this was his plan all along besides kallen. I assume cornelia figured it out. But besides kallen in the epilogue.. how come the surviving black knights could not figure it out and admire him still like kallen did. were they really that stupid?

CodeGeass,1bb3dp,hackisucker,6,Sat Mar 30 18:15:53 2013 UTC,"I think it was after Lelouch's first encounter with Charles (where he attempts to kill him using a broken mirror). That was the first time the Black Knights questioned Zero's commands, and I think that was when he'd gone too far. Either that or when Kallen was captured, and he went nuts."
CodeGeass,1bb3dp,zero557,1 point,Sun Mar 31 11:09:06 2013 UTC,"Yea, he says that when he was in the other realm Suzaku and he both realized that the world was suffering, making me suspect that he devised the plan then."
CodeGeass,1bb3dp,GSWBoii408,8,Tue May 14 00:05:39 2013 UTC,"I think the biggest reason why Suzaku decided to forgive Lelouche was because of the Zero Requiem, so I think Lelouche would have came up with it sometime before that. I also think it was after the black knights betrayed him and Rolo died because that's when he had to make a new plan on how to take control and what to do with the power."
CodeGeass,1bb3dp,Rockmanll,2,Sat Mar 30 18:34:58 2013 UTC,"I believe they really started to devise the plan back at the kururgi shrine. Before Lelouch was captured by Schnizel, the two talked about working together and keeping the lie going till the very end which essentially was the point of the zero requiem. But when they got to Cs world then they truly realized the plan and how they were to do it."

It's not offensively bad the way some mecha anime are, but it's just... kinda meh.   The story doesn't really make sense, characters aren't explored or explained.  3) Maybe my criticisms in #2 will be addressed in subsequent episodes, but the enormous time gap between OVA's coupled with the fact that the first OVA didn't really make sense or feel like Code Geass make me dubious."

She creates a warhead that blows up the Tokyo settlement, killing 10 million people, and then she subconciously blames it on Zero.  She was racist towards ""elevens"", or japanese, as i'd rather call them, and the faces she made whenever something terrible happened. Those faces were just straight up disgusting. Seriously, look at this face and tell me that you will be able to sleep well tonight  Her personality was just so non-likeable, it's like the creator of Code Geass wanted everyone to hate her  also, she raped and traumatzed Table-kun, he was my favorite charachter"
CodeGeass,1b31dd,MuffinFactory,9,Sat Mar 30 00:03:12 2013 UTC,I agree with this completely.  Except table-kun was a bit annoying at times.  He was a bit too lenient too letting people but all their shit on him.

CodeGeass,1ayi0c,megacookie,3,Mon Mar 25 05:06:56 2013 UTC,When I saw this episode I immediately thought of the zero requiem.  Is there a chance that Hiro Mashima is a Code Geass fan?
CodeGeass,1ayi0c,sean151,2,Sat Apr 6 18:33:39 2013 UTC,"It got me pretty well. Sure, martyrdom in anime probably isnt that uncommon, but the resemblance was uncanny. Of course, it seems Hiro isnt such a big fan of good guys getting themselves killed, so it doesnt work out quite the same way. Because in the at least 3 times so far that a Fairy Tail member has considered their lives disposable in order to protect anyone, Natsu seems to get in the way or take matters into his own hands. Which is just as well, because I don't think the show could afford to kill off its protagonists with so much left on the table still. Whereas Code Geass had been building up to the Zero Requiem from pretty early on to be used as its final move, so death brings the perfect amount of impact and closure."

CodeGeass,1al584,OpinionKid,13,Tue Mar 19 11:29:44 2013 UTC,"Because the entire thread is a spoiler, please nobody tell me to use a tag. First of all, I felt exactly the same as you did at the end, and it is an extremely powerful ending that automatically makes the whole series a 10/10 in my eyes. As for Suzaku and Lelouch, while they may not be as close as they once were, Suzaku came to a realization and they mutually respect and trust each other at least. If Suzaku only agreed because it involved Lelouch dying himself and thus avenging Euphie's death, then why was he one of only 4 people crying at his death (when it shows him behind the Zero mask as he impales Lelouch)? Nunnaly cried because obviously she is very close to her big brother. C.C cried before the fact as she knew what he had to do, and she blames his death on the price of the power she gave him. He was the only person who really loved her, making her true wish come true and fulfilling her contract. That he would die while she continues to live forever is pretty sad and cruel, but it seems she still has connection to Lelouch even post mortem, as evident by the cart scene, and she is content. Kallen cries because she too loved Lelouch, even when convinced he was just a power hungry treacherous dictator who used them. Realizing his true intentions (and Suzaku's) in fulfilling the Zero Requiem after its conclusion was tragic for her. Suzaku's tears justify his relationship with Lelouch too, as a first and best friend. It's sad that world peace and happiness is due to everyone's hatred of the ""Demon Emperor"", while the people closest to him suffer his loss and have to silently bear the world ignorantly and spitefully rejoycing the death of the young emperor. Code Geass is a tragedy, but the sad end is also the salvation to an  unfair, wartorn world and the dissolution of the cycle of hatred. So in effect, it has a happy ending, and death with a meaning and smile is better than a hollow, meaningless life. Lelouch died with a smile."
CodeGeass,1al584,megacookie,6,Tue Mar 19 14:31:15 2013 UTC,It sucks that we never got a scene where they outright stated that Lelouch cared about anyone other than Nunnally. I mean it's understood that he did but as a character he never expressed anything like that.  You know when Rolo died I was saying to my friend who had already watched the ending. I was saying that I don't think I could forgive Lelouch. I said that I hated how selfish he was and how he threw away pretty much everyone who cared about him.  I was wrong. He even made a comment to me saying that I shouldn't be so sure he was beyond redemption but yeah. Such a good show!  Do you have any anime recommendations other than Code Geass? I seem to have watched the best of the best and I don't know what can top Code Geass. Haha  I just recently finished up watching Angel Beats and I must say the ending to Code Geass makes the Angel Beats ending seem so very miild.   (If you've seen the Angel Beats ending you'll know it is very sad.)
CodeGeass,1al584,megacookie,3,Tue Mar 19 20:43:57 2013 UTC,"The writers assume we are a good enough judge of Lelouch's character to know how much he cares for people under all of the cold, calculating, and apathetic masks he wears, something he is forced to do if he is to fulfill his roles without involving people he cares about into the mess. Even though Shirley found out he was Zero, she still fell in love with him and it put her through a lot of suffering and she became a pawn to be used by Lelouch's enemies such as Mao. Eventually, this relationship lead to her death at Rolo's hands due to knowing too much about him. I think from this point Lelouch decides he has to go about his path alone, and is afraid of opening his heart again for fear of more suffering to those he cares about. You find this a lot with how he pretends to be a massive jerk and lies about his intentions in order to sever bonds of camaraderie and friendship he has made with the Black Knights, especially the potential romantic relationship with Kallen. For these reasons we are forced to view Lelouch the way the world sees him: selfish and manipulative.  I think I felt the same way about him during the Rolo death scene. Admittedly Lelouch was well prepared to die at the hands of the Black Knights and was yelling at Rolo to stop overdoing his Geass (meaning he didnt want him dead any more). But when dying Rolo said he knew Lelouch was lying about saying he was plotting to kill him and that their ""brotherhood"" was genuine, Lelouch agreed that Rolo had figured out he was just a compulsive liar by nature. I do not know whether this was genuine or just another lie told by Lelouch to let Rolo die happy. It was pretty hard to forgive Lelouch if that were the case, but then again Rolo killed Shirley for no good reason and he told Lelouch Nunnaly was dead when she wasnt (in the hopes that he would replace her maybe).  As for recommended anime, I am fairly new to anime myself. There are shows that are very similar to Code Geass, but I can't recommend them because I havent watched them and anything too similar will probably just seem like an inferior copy of the original. CG is hard to top. I really find myself liking slightly darker anime that may or may not end well or tragically, as some of the lighter ones seem a bit unrealistic and cliche. Fate/Zero was really good because it presented the same kind of almost anti-hero protagonist as Lelouch, and there are times when you really hate the hero and sympathize with the enemies. It is the prequel to Fate/Stay Night, apparently you're supposed to play the Visual Novel for FS/N then watch F/Z even though it spoils the ending. I also really enjoyed Steins;Gate, if time travel science fiction is your thing. If it isnt, still watch Steins;Gate, it's well worth it for the mental and emotional rollercoaster mixed with great comic relief. Also watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. It's pretty long (64 episodes) but it's impactful in its own way and if you didn't like the bittersweetness of Code Geass's ending, this is probably more satisfying."
CodeGeass,1al584,megacookie,1 point,Wed Mar 20 00:23:15 2013 UTC,"Rolo killed Shirley for no good reason and he told Lelouch Nunnaly was dead when she wasnt (in the hopes that he would replace her maybe).   He didn't know any better. Which again reinforces my idea of a major theme in the show which seems to be, ""What is truly evil?""  I really liked that character even if he was a killer by nature. He just wanted someone to love him. Technically Shirley's death is Lelouch's fault really. He manipulated Rolo into that situation.   Fate/Zero   I keep hearing about this show. I might have to watch it. Is it something I can watch without a previous knowledge to the content matter? Or should I start with the ""sequel"". (You said it's a prequel.)   Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood   I tried watching one episode and I wasn't a huge fan. Is it actually that good? I was worried that it was one of those shows that was just pure action and stuff. Like no real plot."
CodeGeass,1al584,Chazm12,1 point,Wed Mar 20 01:44:27 2013 UTC,"Ok, the first like dozen or two episodes of  Brotherhood (2009) arent terribly great because they are a recap of what happens early on in the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist. I think at some point the two series diverge, and then the original content and storyline of Brotherhood become apparent and it just gets better until the end. The opposite to the original anime, as the back story for that is properly covered and you get side character development brushed over in Brotherhood. But it ends a bit anti climactic. If you want, you could watch both series to get the best of both, but 100+ episodes is a lot to commit to if you arent sure it's what you like. Dont worry, either one has a real plot.  For Fate/Zero, while watching in chronological order makes more sense, if you watch Fate/Zero first Fate/Stay Night will be a bit of a disappointment as it is considerably more juvenile and less epic. Not saying FSN is bad, I liked it a lot. I suggest starting with the sequel if you plan on watching both. If watching just one, go with Fate/Zero."

I say the strongest evidence for the renewal of their bond is when Suzaku cries as he kills his best friend :(..."
CodeGeass,1al584,professor_X231,3,Tue Mar 19 14:53:41 2013 UTC,"I think they were able to ""make up"" because Lelouch showed Suzaku that he himself knew the crimes he had commited and would owe up to them. Suzaku understood Lelouch's plan, and knowing Lelouch, knew he could do it. Therefor, while he still wanted Lelouch punished, there was no reason to make his death meaningless if they could save the world in the process"

CodeGeass,1al584,megacookie,2,Wed Mar 20 20:07:48 2013 UTC,I certainly hope so. Ah if only things had turned out better. I wish that the creators of the show would have made a one off episode in which all the characters got to shoot fireworks together though. I really wanted that. ;D
CodeGeass,1al584,zero557,2,Tue Mar 19 20:45:46 2013 UTC,I definitely think that at the end she was talking to Lelouch! Seeing as they become immortal when they have the power of the Geass (like when C.C died in the first or second episode then just shows up).  The only thing that I would have wanted was for more people to know the whole truth like Nunnaly did at the end as there were so many things that a lot of the characters didn't end up knowing.
CodeGeass,1al584,sean151,3,Wed Mar 20 00:29:16 2013 UTC,"I don't think so. I mean you can interpret it that way if you want but I feel like it spits in the face of the whole message of the show. Throughout the show the theme is, ""Do the ends justify the means?"" and even more than that ""What is truly evil?"".  I think the finality of death hammers home these two questions in the final scene."

CodeGeass,1acd5y,DontRockTheGoat,1 point,Sun Mar 17 10:45:46 2013 UTC,1 and 3 are different variations of Geass. I believe 3 appeared in the anime while 1 was used in the manga. 2 is the symbol of the Black Knights.
CodeGeass,19d36x,DaItalianFish,35,Thu Feb 28 00:29:04 2013 UTC,"I think Lelouch really did love her, but after what happened to Shirley, he knows that anyone who gets too close to him will either die or suffer horribly. If he already had the idea for the Zero Requiem in his head, then he wouldn't want to form a relationship with someone only to break their heart when he ends his life. I think he loved her enough to put her wellbeing over his emotional gratification by appearing stonefaced and unresponsive after their kiss in Ashford Academy, and appearing to haughtily betray her when at gunpoint by the Black Knights. I think they both knew that if he so much as hinted that their love was mutual, Kallen would have followed Lelouch to hell without regrets. I found this romance to be more powerful than whatever he had with Euphemia (only briefly mentioned, seemed like it was just remnants of their childhood together), Shirley (I believe he liked her as a friend and didnt really mirror her deep and troubled feelings for him), and even C.C (a bit obvious to fall for the magical girl who gave you second life and bounded you in a contract with her). Also, he saw Kallen steamy, wet, and naked in the shower and that's enough to make up the minds of most guys."
CodeGeass,19d36x,megacookie,1 point,Thu Feb 28 03:32:39 2013 UTC,"I just commented and then looked down and saw you said exactly what I said, except more eloquently."
CodeGeass,19d36x,Bob49459,15,Thu Feb 28 03:50:24 2013 UTC,"Lelouch has a girl for each of his persona, Lelouch vi Britannia for C.C, Lelouch Lamperouge for Shirley, and Zero for Kallen.   I feel he loved them all, but in order, in my perspective it was C.C > Shirley > Kallen. I'll expand on my opinion if anybody is genuinely curious."
CodeGeass,19d36x,megacookie,10,Thu Feb 28 11:16:49 2013 UTC,"Never thought about it that way. Though with Kallen, while she deeply admires and respects Zero as a leader, she doesn't really love someone she can't identify. When she finds out about Lelouch's identity, she is conflicted at the thought of the hero of the Japanese being a Brit, but as she gets to know him, it is Lelouch she falls for. Not sure if she falls in love with him before or after she realizes his royal status. As for Shirley, well, it is plainly obvious she only knew and loved Lelouch Lamperouge, because to her Zero was the terrorist who kills ruthlessly and murdered her father as collateral. That's why her conflict was so severe it tore her apart mentally when she came to terms with his secret identity. She comes to accept her love in the end, but really, it killed her in the end. I think that while her love for Lelouch has had the longest to mature, starting from episode 1 as a school crush, she only was allowed to know and love 1/3 of Lelouch's personas before the revelation of the second third betrayed her. Kallen came to know and love Zero first, then Lamperouge, but like everyone else on the Black Knights, felt betrayed when she discovered Lelouch's true secrets, sans masks as a prince who manipulates minds and treats not only the enemy, but also the allies, as soulless gamepieces. In truth, Lelouch has more humanity and heart than this, but he doesn't let on, as he doesn't allow Kallen a glimpse into the deepest corner of his heart and mind. His relationship with Kallen therefore had time to foster both on the front lines of battle as warriors and as young persons in a school setting. While he allows himself to love Shirley as a highschool sweetheart and Kallen as his protector and faithful companion in battle, the only woman who stands by his side as a family-problems royal prince and tyrannous emperor is C.C. She knows Lelouch about as deeply as he knows himself, and though she has had her heart coldened and worn numb by the cruel passage of time as an immortal who has spent a lifetime being denied proper, lasting love, their mutual and silent bond that arrives from their contract and constant company of each other is enough to allow herself to open her heart to someone after possibly centuries of solitude. Enough to overpower what she believed to be her greatest wish-to die, and replace it with her true desire for forbidden happiness. I believe because of this, their relationship has the most depth and dimension, and Lelouch is connected to her without the need for deception, heartbreak, awkward moments, and having to keep the fate of the world and his life a secret from her. It seems that love borne out of mutual connectedness (LxC.C) is stronger than love borne out of respect and admiration (LxK) which is stronger than a mostly one-sided but long-standing high school romance (LxS)."
CodeGeass,19d36x,megacookie,2,Thu Feb 28 18:10:39 2013 UTC,That was an excellent writeup.
CodeGeass,19d36x,megacookie,1 point,Thu Feb 28 09:15:24 2013 UTC,"Shirley does deal with Zero, or more specifically, deals with the idea of the person she thought she hates most in the world actually being the same person that she loves. But then I guess love won over hate in the end, and it's not as if hatred could undo what has been done. Still, both times she found out she was on the verge of killing herself from the torment."
CodeGeass,19d36x,megacookie,1 point,Thu Feb 28 09:47:48 2013 UTC,"Oh, true. She did point a gun at his head when his mask fell off, didn't she? But it doesnt really count. I don't think comparing that part to Kallen though really matters, because while Kallen had constant interaction with Zero (he's her boss, anyway), that was the side of him that she was comfortable with and knew, just like Shirley was with Lelouch (Lamperouge). Kallen's interaction with him in school was mainly on an acquaintance/classmate level (albeit slight suspicion) until she confirmed the truth."

CodeGeass,19d36x,blaser22,4,Thu Feb 28 04:15:27 2013 UTC,"He definitely loved Shirley. When she died he lost it and got really depressed After that he may have flirted with the idea of loving again, but I'm not sure if his heart was fully in it. Somewhere he knew what he might have to do, and he didn't really want to tie himself to anything, but he still was optimistic."
CodeGeass,198j8r,DaItalianFish,4,Tue Feb 26 03:26:07 2013 UTC,I think I might know the reason for C.C. being happy at the end of the series. I think it is because she was reflecting on the time she spent with Lelouch and after her time spent with him she is filled with hope again. She is looking forward to the future because she is finally living a real life and not just collecting memories.
CodeGeass,198j8r,jeff6644,2,Tue Feb 26 04:48:38 2013 UTC,"C.C smiling at the end is a big hint that he is still alive. Forgive me, but I wish you rant upon this. If you remember correctly before Lelouch boards the Shinkiro, C.C says ""Just come back alive, that'll put a smile on my face"" or something like that and if I'm correct the two aren't seen together for the rest of the show. But in the end, she is smiling, meaning that she won't be smiling if he was still alive, or back alive or whatever.  However, this doesn't explain why she was crying before Lelouch was killed. Perhaps she was unsure that he was truly immortal and that there was a possibility that he could be dead forever. So with her smiling at the end nearly confirms that he is still alive."
CodeGeass,198j8r,MrScruff95,4,Tue Feb 26 22:06:27 2013 UTC,"These are great points. It annoys me that people try to argue against this theory just by pointing out that the creators say he's dead, without providing any evidence from within the show itself. The fact that the show can transcend the bounds set by its creators is what makes it truly great."
CodeGeass,198j8r,FingerMyFetus,2,Thu Apr 4 04:45:31 2013 UTC,"A couple different reasons for this not sure which one it is though. If I remember correctly it states somewhere in the series that Nunnally has the ability to see/understand people's feelings just by touching their hands. Or it could be that people who are connected to geass are able to share memories and strange sights upon touching each other. The last thing I could think of is that it was because she was planning to do the same thing with Damocles and just realized what he had done. It could be because simply because his plan went well and he made the world a better place or it could be because Lelouch made her feel like she was living again and not just accumulating memories.  Don't think it really looked like the same place C.C. was in, I really think it was just some humor for the end.  Not sure maybe just because the plan went well or it could be that after Lelouch took over the world Jeremiah didn't know about the plan and started to hate him like the rest of the world. Which might explain why he just let Zero run past him...Or he knew about the plan and was happy it made the world better. Could be she was talking to him since he is dead and would become part of the collective consciousness which geass is connected too. Could be she was talking to herself. Either way I think she was referring to how despite having geass(which is supposed to condemn you to a life of solitude) both her and Lelouch had plenty of close friends and weren't alone. Or it could be since most people who get geass are forced to be immortal(and are thus alone throughout time) and Lelouch  didn't end up being immortal so he wasn't condemned to a life of solitude."
CodeGeass,198j8r,Moxypony,1 point,Tue Feb 26 15:54:18 2013 UTC,"She says ""the price you are going to pay for using your geass on them is a dear one"", while crying. She knows what it was like to live all those years. It was not a good experience. Assuming his code didn't activate until Zero killed Lelouch, she could be crying as she feels sorry for anyone cursed with immorality like her.  It would also explain what ""price"" she meant. Sure, death is kinda bad, but becoming immortal and having to watch everyone you love die, being unable to die yourself...  that's on a whole another level.  I agree with the other points, though."

I love Lelouch as a character, and it's really sad that he died, but I don't feel that any of the evidence proposed here is really strong enough to contradict the idea that he died.  Beyond that, Lelouch dying is a far more poetic ending to the series. Giving the ultimate sacrifice to create a more gentle world for Nunnally and everyone."
CodeGeass,198j8r,Bob49459,-1,Wed Feb 27 07:09:14 2013 UTC,"Lelouch is dead. That is the truth. Deal. With. It.  But that is the beauty about the ending. Lelouch died a very poetic and in my opinion a BEAUTIFUL death. He died for a greater cause than his own life. He died for a gentler world for everyone. ""Yes, I... destroy the world, and ... create it... anew."" The famous last words of an unsung hero. DO NOT LET THAT GO IN VAIN  Lelouch is not selfish enough to let his death be fake."

Same plan a Lelouch. She had changed then. She wasn't alone because she had Kallen and Kuzaku (sorry if I'm spelling these names wrong) and wanted to live. Working on a farm is hard but satisfying work. Every day you feel you've earned that night's rest and are proud of what you have done. There are days you can finish up early, and just sit back enjoying the serenity of your own hard work and labor. World peace and shit. Lelouch was happy about his plan, and death really shouldn't be mourned for too long. It should be a celebration of one's accomplishments in life. Lelouch accomplished a hell of a lot in his life. 5.It might be he is still there in spirit. C.C. was never talking to herself, but lelouch's mom who was floating around (Yoda, Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon...) That would even explain ""The Birthday Miracle."""

The added voices of Lelouch and C.C. are excellently spliced (I've seen some AMVs where they add it but it sounds completely different and disjointed). The only gripe I have is that the words in the video at the first ""The End is where we begin"" look really out of place. The font is okay I guess, but with the color and on top of the scene it looks really out of place. Honestly, I'd say it doesn't add anything to the amv, so it could be removed and the amv would look better without it.  That's all just my opinions though. Keep up the good work!"

CodeGeass,18u7k5,vBritannia,19,Tue Feb 19 20:39:16 2013 UTC,The only way I can see an R3 ever happening is if its set ~100 years in the future and people have fucked up the world so much again that they need to be reminded of Lelouch's power.
CodeGeass,18u7k5,LelouchViBrittania,1 point,Tue Feb 19 23:06:17 2013 UTC,"I'd like to see the initial expansions of Britainnia. The main character would be some middle ranking officer, and we would see the rise of Britainnia as they take the ruins. In one of these ruins, the main character meets V.V. and gains Geass (possibly recognise him as the older brother of the king from a picture?) Due to this contact, the main character is brought into V.V. and Charle's compact. Manipulated by both, the series should culminate finally in the character attempting to either overthrow Charles as he realizes CHarle's goal to destroy the world or being tricked by V.V. to make an attempt at Marianne. The final scene will be Charles picking the protagonist off the ground, his geass only in one eye, and beginning to speak, ""Charles zi Britannia commands you...."" Fade to black.  It'd be cool to see Charle's possibly mirroring Lelouch (trying to destroy the world for a single promise), and the subsequent change V.V. mentions as he met Marianne. To me, Charles is an interesting character because while he considered most of his children as part of the unconcious, his contact with Marianne changed him. Soon after her death, he exiled them to protect them. A year or two later though he no longer cared and was back to worrying solely about smashing god. IMO, watching Charle's actions after he takes the throne would be like watching a reverse Lelouch. He's cold, gains some emotions, loses someone, becomes even more cold. Lelouch starts out as a warm character, hides emotions, loses someone, really begins to hide himself from the world."
CodeGeass,18u7k5,Blizzaldo,14,Wed Mar 13 19:59:36 2013 UTC,"The problem is Lelouch's story is already done. He went out with a bang forever changing the world. Whether Lelouch is dead or alive doesn't really make a difference. Although I still favor him being dead, it was an epic ending because of his death and sacrifice. The funny thing is Suzaku is alive but can never go back to his normal life. If Lelouch were alive the samething would happen to him."
CodeGeass,18u7k5,RS19,5,Tue Feb 19 22:30:54 2013 UTC,"As Lark already said , it would be really cool if R3 was something like a backstory . Starting with Lelouch when he was little , or Lelouch and Suzaku as kids , i don't know .. Some history about Lelouch , and it may end when he get the Geass !"
CodeGeass,18u7k5,stillbutterfly,5,Sat Feb 23 13:54:53 2013 UTC,"My idea for an R3 is to go into the character's backstories, or even into the Britannia vs. Japan fight.  I'd like to see Lelouch as a prince and I'd like to see all these things happen before Lelouch gets his Geass.  Basically, I'd watch any Code Geass with Lelouch in it, as long as he was the Lelouch from Lelouch of the Rebellion and not some weird Lelouch like in Nunally's Wonderland."

Even if Lelouch is alive, that doesn't mean there needs to be an R3. I wouldn't be surprised if the creators just said he was dead to get people to stop wanting more Lelouch.  I'd be fine with some sort of prequel, but frankly, Code Geass is good as is."
CodeGeass,18u7k5,Johnnywycliffe,1 point,Thu Feb 28 23:01:02 2013 UTC,I want there to be an R3 because I like to imagine an immortal Lelouch actually acting how he magically plays the king in chess.

Is the police system like Britannian rule? A system that gets away with mistreating its subjugates and by being the law, is above the law? If so, a fired/exiled officer (prince) who has seen the twofaced policies and coverups in person vowing revenge to the point of murdering those who he was once on the same side as, claiming to be for the wellbeing of the innocent public but not hesitant to harm those who stand in his way. Oh, Dorner, you should have worn a caped suit and masked your identity, and should have had a power and a plan. Or not. There can only be one Zero, and Dorner's barbecue end means he lost, unlike orchestrating your own skewering. Very nice coming out with the manifesto, but will it cause the waves intended?

After trying( and failing) to pick up the pieces and restore what he lost within the confines of the law, he snapped and became what he saw to be a vigilante.   He killed many people in search of revenge, including several innocents.   He stained his hands with evil after good could serve him no longer.  His crusade was ended rather recently: when he was cornered, and burned alive by the police.  Some praised him, some called him a psychopath.   Me? I just find it interesting."

Do you know if they will ever dub this after it is finished? And if so, would it be done by the same company as the original series? If no one has any idea, that is entirely understandable. I was just wondering if so."

You saw the ending however, so it is obvious there can be no R3. I haven't seen Akito the Exiled yet, I am very tentative because it has a lot to live up to."
CodeGeass,16pxtv,megacookie,1 point,Fri Jan 18 00:54:21 2013 UTC,"I'd not be so totally sure that there cannot ever be a third season of Lelouch's story. After all, whether or not he died is a matter we debate.   While I may think he lived, I'm not entirely sure I want a 3rd season of that story, as it's already ended on such a good note."
CodeGeass,16pxtv,Oxirane,2,Sat Jan 19 03:20:33 2013 UTC,"Thing is, the ending is far more climactic if he did die. The alternative, while a nice way to wrap things up, really isnt as interesting. An immortal recluse Lelouch in some remote low tech area of the world with immortal and finally loved CC (until death do them part-or not) in a world made peaceful by the Zero Requiem. It's too much of an anti-cliffhanger either way, much better just to let the fantastic tale rest, either happily ever after or a martyr's death, whichever you choose to believe."
CodeGeass,16pxtv,megacookie,1 point,Wed Jan 30 06:45:28 2013 UTC,"And I do, in a sense, agree. But there's the question of the Code Charles had, which is certainly a possible factor.   I might be wrong, but I think I remember Lelouch smirking in the scene when his father is dying/chocking him... which might imply that he had gotten the Code? And of course, it seemed that Nunally got some kind of C.C.-esque psychic flash when touching Lelouch's dying body... which the show has implied is a side-effect of being a Code-holder.  Either way, I think they made the right choice leaving things a bit ambiguous. Yes, the ending is more climatic and resolves more should Lelouch have died (""The only ones who should kill are those who should prepare to be killed.""), however, I think either ending can work.   Like we both said, this ending was good."
CodeGeass,16nmt9,Mattyboy7,3,Wed Jan 16 01:34:32 2013 UTC,"There is no legal place that I'm aware of that you can download Code Geass, but you can buy it over Amazon for a decent price in terms of anime.

CodeGeass,16ieux,RS19,5,Mon Jan 14 17:30:57 2013 UTC,The manga is basically the anime without any of the action. Just the dialog.
CodeGeass,16ieux,LelouchViBrittania,4,Mon Jan 14 21:30:36 2013 UTC,"The manga is an extremely toned down version of the global chaos going on the in anime, from what I've seen even at the start of the first volume instead of kallen stealing the tank with (Supposedly) gas in it. It's changed to kallen destroying a statue on the schools grounds with other students and lelouche standing there menacingly in his zero costume. It was very confusing."

CodeGeass,16dqhq,tenachiasaca,15,Fri Jan 11 15:04:29 2013 UTC,"Does it necessarily matter?  The concept of Lelouch vi Britannia died at the conclusion of Zero Requiem.  Lelouch vi Britannia needed to die in order to achieve successful world reconciliation. Lelouch himself may be alive, or dead, but he will no longer be Lelouch vi Britannia.  In the same way, Suzaku is also dead, now only remaining as Zero.  Let's think about the significance of both cases.  If Lelouch lives, then it can symbolizes that the peace brought by Zero Requiem is a lie.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as it is a successful lie, and it is entirely a game of chess.  Or perhaps it symbolizes that, like the world, Lelouch is able to be reborn free from the conflicts that destiny imparted on him.  Lelouch managed to outplay destiny itself.  On the other hand, if Lelouch indeed dies, it will be as C.C. said an escape from the bondage of eternity.  Not eternity as in having the Code and being immortal, but shackled to the duties to the world forever.  He would atone for all the transgressions against the world.  So either way, it is extremely meaningful.  Perhaps it is more meaningful that both outcomes are possible."
CodeGeass,16dqhq,xdavid00,4,Fri Jan 11 17:20:15 2013 UTC,"Honestly this is the best answer I can think of, it doesn't matter either way because the outcome is virtually the same. Personally, I don't think Lelouch would accept an endgame where he dies, it just isn't in his character to accept defeat of any kind."
CodeGeass,16dqhq,LelouchViBrittania,13,Fri Jan 11 21:07:53 2013 UTC,In a game of chess any piece may be sacrificed to win.  except the king.
CodeGeass,16dqhq,Chukie1188,8,Sat Jan 12 00:33:50 2013 UTC,"The way I saw the end of the series was that Lelouch surpassed the limits of the real life chess game that he was playing and saw that true victory came only through the death of the king.  Lelouch accepted his death.  Even if he's not dead, Lelouch is dead and will never return.  Even going as far as giving up Nunnully, he proved that he will go to any length for the final victory, and that may not exclude the king itself.  That's my take. He is beyond chess.."

CodeGeass,16dqhq,megacookie,1 point,Wed Jan 30 06:49:18 2013 UTC,"This entire post is a spoiler for the ending, can we cut out the blacking out? It's hurting my eyes having to read in white on black  Personally, I think he'd just want to atone for his sins in the only way he can: death. All the people's lives he's taken, altered, or ruined due to deception in order to achieve this goal, I'd like to think his final move is a change of character as he seeks redemption. It would make him come off as a bigger hero than him swindling the world with a fake death."

CodeGeass,16dqhq,CritHitLights,2,Fri Jan 11 15:17:46 2013 UTC,"So, the only way for someone with an immortal code like C.C. V.V. and charles v Britannia to die is by giving up the code. So what happened to Chalres V Britannia's code when he died in front of lelouch."
CodeGeass,16dqhq,B-Con,6,Fri Jan 11 15:08:23 2013 UTC,"Charles' wasn't really a normal death, though. He wasn't a part of the physical world inside the Sword of Akasha and it wasn't just a death by physical means. I would guess that nothing needed to happen to his immortal code."
CodeGeass,16dqhq,Ryuuzoji,8,Fri Jan 11 16:43:24 2013 UTC,"I never really get why people seem to think that something had to happen to that code. Charles was erased, rather than killed, and I assumed that his immortality and code was erased along with him"

CodeGeass,16dqhq,vBritannia,-1,Sun Jan 13 14:45:33 2013 UTC,He lived.. the author said it himself. CC is now able to die. LeLouch is now LL.  Le Louch was immortal when Suzaku impaled him.  Suzaku couldn't bring himself to end LeLouch's life.  At the end CC is talking to the driver which is LL.  HE IS NOT DEAD.

I'll give basic plot but it shouldnt really spoil anything:  Steins;Gate (less action than CG but more of an emotional toll: just bear through the first few confusing and boring episodes. Absolutely perfect ending too. The dangers of altering the past...and the future. Also mad scientist)  Kaze No Stigma (really nice plot and budding love story, but ends incomplete because the mangawriter died before finishing the story. Frustrating cause of the potential. Disowned son of fire magic family comes back years later as super awesome wind magic user)  FullMetal Alchemist (I really like the original, just getting into Brotherhood but I dont think it's as good right now. Two brothers screw up their bodies trying to bring back the dead, joins the millitary as State Alchemists on a quest to get their bodies back)  Ao No Exorcist (pretty good action but nothing groundbreaking. Devil's child becomed exorcist in order to defeat satan)  Death Note (main character is like Lelouch in so many ways, it's the closest to CG in this regard. Guy wants to bring world peace by ruling over it like a god with his newfound power of death)  Familiar of Zero (more for younger viewers, but my first full anime series so I liked it a lot. Witch girl from a parallel world summons Tokyo boy and treats him like a slave...is jealous of his attention from other girls because she's flat as a board)  Initial D (I like cars and racing, this ones all about midnight races on mountain roads in Japan)  Sword Art Online (this seems to be the one that's overhyped and Reddit says you should shun, but it's pretty damn good. Virtual reality with real world lives at stake)"
CodeGeass,163q1g,jinnyjuice,1 point,Wed Jan 30 15:54:25 2013 UTC,"You Know Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is waay better than the original .

Once when Lelouch touched C.C. while she was touching Sazaku, and definitely the episode I got this from: R2 ep15. When C.C. shows Lulu how she got her geass from the crazy nun. I'm sure it was more than just once, it wouldn't have made such an impression on me after not seeing the show for a few years."

It is pretty interesting but has a much different plot and message and everything like that. Still good though. As for other somewhat similar series, I can attest to Death Note, Gurren Lagaan, and Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom. One of those might be my second favorite. Code Geass being first. Also, I heard Darker than Black is really good and has similarities to CG. I heard the same about Legend of the Galactic Heroes but I heard this one is very similar to CG and is supposedly more original. I don't know about that but I know it's pretty damn old. Like made in the late 80's or something."

BTOOOOM - Badass main character, slightly more about survival and action, but its still basically a small group vs a huge cooperation.  Magi - Not really anything to do with Geass, I just enjoy it.  DN - So obvious, the MCs are like brothers.  DTB - Edgy main character i that is your thing.  Zetsuen no Tempest - Main characters are both badasses, and it is about saving the world, but in this sense much more literal. Both are supposedly tragic."
CodeGeass,1432gu,mau5turbator,3,Sat Dec 1 20:48:09 2012 UTC,Guilty Crown great   Are you fucking kidding me? It was a shit clusterfuck story with horrible pacing and constant asspulls.

CodeGeass,1432gu,Trekkie_girl,4,Sun Jan 27 00:35:57 2013 UTC,"Trinity Blood - Lots of intrigue, and some excellent animation. Vastly underrated, I think.  Code: Breaker - Currecntly airing, rather similar in characters, although the story is a good bit different.  Chunnibyou - Plotwise, they're nothing alike. But the main character is voiced by Jun Fukuyama (Lelouch), and the resemblances are uncanny. Plus, it's hysterically funny. Also currently airing."

The ability only works really well on a single target. If used on a crowd, then the intents start to blend together. Specific intents have specific colors such as good Samaritans being marked blue and selfish individuals marked dark grey.   These colors are seen as an outline around the target. As stated before, crowds will have a sort of blending effect. However, if they have a shared intent, then they will be outlined with that intent's color.  The intensity of their intent will affect the brightness of the color. Someone who half-heartedly wants to help me will have a duller color to someone who really wants to help.  Perhaps upon the activation of the second eye, I'd be able to pick out specific intents from a crowd."

In coded data namine said that sora had to remember namine xion and everything that happened in castle oblivion.

CodeGeass,12fmv9,Ryuuzoji,9,Thu Nov 1 23:13:59 2012 UTC,"The Original Japanese show does NOT show Lelouch as the driver of the carriage at the end. This is some fanmade hoax, nothing more.  Lelouch died. That was the point of the series. Lelouch, throughout the series conteniously said that only those who are ready to be killed, should kill. In the end, his plan was one of self-sacrifice. He was making 2 personalities, the hero Zero and the villain Lelouch, and has his friend fill one role, and filled the other himself, gathering the world around Zero.  Signs that point to him being dead:   C.C cries when he's ""killed"". If she had any idea he possessed a code of immortality, there would be no reason for this. Same with Suzaku. There would be no reason for either of them to cry if Lelouch was indeed immortal. When you gain a code, you lose your geass. This is a bit weaker, since some people claim that you don't lose your geass immeadietly, but only when you are killed for the first time and the code ""activates"". Which one of these is true is unknown, but noone but Lelouch has alledgedly used their geass after getting the code. Euphimea's death is mirrored in Lelouche's. Both die, hated by the world, with the people cheering Zero's name. His death could be Lelouche's way of atoning for unintentionally getting Euphimea killed. The ending loses its meaning without it. Where's the beauty in the ending, where you have Nunnaly crying for her older brother in a world where everyone else hates him, if he just gets up afterwards and lives on? Nowhere. There's no sacrifice, no nothing.  The creator confirmed it: He is dead Lelouch, during his death scene says to Suzaku ""this is also a punishment for you"", meaning that he definetely did consider it a punishment for himself. Why would he if he was going to get up again as soon as people stopped looking? It's impossible to imagine that the corpse of Lelouch, the hated tyrant, could just ""disappear"". It would be watched better than that, and checked thoroughly to make sure that it wasn't a double, and the people examining it would notice if he was alive again. It was, according to creators, placed on the Damocles and sent into the sun to be burned with it.  Lastly I'd like to refute a point that some ""Lelouch is alive"" conspiracists like to make: They claim that the moment Nunnaly touches Lelouch, she gets a vision similar to what Lelouch had when he touched C.C the first time, showing that the has obtained a code. This is bullocks. Try comparing the two clips. In the one C.C. shows Lelouch, he's shown handing between 2 worlds, we see the previous code owners and a few other quick clips, but nothing continuous or connected. Nunnaly however sees a quick, recap of what happened, set in a completely different way.    edit: Please, if you have a problem with any or all of my points, comment and elaborate, don't just hit downvote. This topic was made for discussion, so discuss."
CodeGeass,12fmv9,Ryuuzoji,3,Thu Nov 1 16:37:54 2012 UTC,"I can't believe how many people still believe that hoax... you can very clearly see the logo disappearing in the fake bit. As for whether or not Lelouch is alive... I haven't completely made up my mind to be honest, but I do think it's at least possible he's alive.    I disagree with this. C.C./Suzaku could, at that point, not know he'll live. Lelouch may not have known he was going to live. If they did, they could be crying because Lelouch will never be able to be seen by anyone ever again. Living a life in the shadows, hidden... After so much hard work to make the world a better place, after so much suffering and  sacrifice that will be his reward. And everyone will hate him for it. Hell, just not being able to see Nunnally again could be enough reason to cry. C.C. could also be crying because she knows how horrible immortal life is, and know what is ahead of Lelouch. Suzaku could be crying because he knows how difficult his life will be and because he'll never get his wish. Imho, there are plenty reasons for them to cry. When you gain the code of the person who gave you your geass, you lose it. It is not clear how this works when it is another persons code. Lelouch gaining the code while still having a geass could explain the title. (That's not a solid argument, though.) That's a nice interpretation of the situation, I agree. But it's not a solid argument. I disagree. I do think Lelouch dying or at least thinking he'd die is stronger, but I don't agree the ending would lose meaning altogether. Also not really an argument imho. This is the only thing I can't argue with. Although, creators do lie. Sherlock was officially dead for 10 years as well. (Also, it officially says that C.C. en Lelouch's ""time is over""... if Lelouch died, wouldn't he go to C's world? I'm still not clear on how that works.) Because he would never, ever be seen by anyone ever again? Not even his loved ones. That's a pretty harsh punishment, especially considering his immortality. Lelouch was also a very strong advocate for mortality. He wanted the world to keep on moving, that's why he opposed the emperor. So him, of all people, becoming immortal, the thing he had been fighting... That's definitely a punishment. There are things worse than death. Considering the power he had and the amount of (geassed) followers he had that would be no problem. Orange-kun could take care of that. He'd just need some time to prepare. Also, if Zero said he personally examined the body and took care of it... who'd argue with him?  I'm not sure about this. On the one hand this is true. But then what did Nunnally see? Did she gain magical powers through her blind-ness? (Actually, I thought there was an official website that did say something like that... very disappointing imho.) C.C. showed that, while she had no control over the exact images, she could choose what kind they were. ""Shock images"" for example, with Suzaku. Maybe Lelouch could too. Maybe he sent Nunnally ""comforting images"" so she'd feel better. But I don't really know about this either way."
CodeGeass,12fmv9,Ryuuzoji,1 point,Thu Nov 1 13:34:57 2012 UTC,"Much of this is of course speculation (from both of our sides, as it isn't explicitely shown in the series). Therefor I will not be trying to ""counter"" your arguments: I consider all of them fair, but they don't sound convincing as the majority of it is guesswork, though I do feel that there is less supporting them than with my points (you are free to disagree with this).  If Lelouch had survived, there is nothing preventing him from living behind the scenes with Nunnaly, asuming that Zero had enough power to keep people from inspecting the body, there's no reason why he couldn't keep people outside of a secret room in Nunnaly's house/castle. On another point: If Lelouch did indeed survive, there's no reason for Suzaku to be Zero after Lelouch's ""death"". He could live as Zero along with Nunnaly, and Suzaku could go into hiding or whatever.  In the very ending sequence, right before he is stabbed, Lelouch's most favorite quote is played ""the only ones who should kill, are those prepared to be killed"". Why would the director put this clip there if Lelouch was to survive? The reason why this is played is because Lelouch, who has killed, is indeed prepared to be killed. In fact, that's part of his master plan.  The Nunnaly thing is apparantly because she can tell whats inside people's hearts when she touches them, rather than just tell if they are lying. I agree that this is kind of a deus made in order to not leave Nunnaly in the dark for the rest of her life."
CodeGeass,12fmv9,Ryuuzoji,2,Thu Nov 1 15:13:33 2012 UTC,"Exactly, so that's why I'm not sure myself, I just try to keep all the options open and discuss it as much as possible. The thing that bothers me a lot is Charles' code. Where did it go if it wasn't stolen by Lelouch?  Well, originally Nunnally was not supposed to know that Lelouch survived. (Actually, originally-originally Nunnally was dead.) He made it very clear that the only reason that he was able to use his geass on her was because he wanted her to see him as the enemy as well. She was supposed to hate him, to be able to move forward. So if he knew he was going to survive, he still wouldn't have be able to see her. He wanted to give her closure by his death. Real or not.  But that's the thing... did he know? Maybe he was completely prepared to die, maybe Charles gave Lelouch his code as revenge, as punishment. Maybe he didn't know. C.C. took a while to regenerate after death as well, so it's not impossible for Lelouch to be transported by Orange/Suzaku who then finds out he's still alive and then fake something to cover up for it. This seems more far-fetched though, but it's not impossible.  I don't think you can quite compare holding power a few hours after death (which you could completely plan ahead) and holding power (from the shadows) for years on end. No matter how smart Lelouch is, he's had many close calls. After his death absolutely everything would change. The people on his side would not be allowed power anymore. I don't think it would be that easy, especially because it was never part of the original plan. Nunnally was not supposed to know the truth.  Suzaku becoming Zero was a form of punishment for Suzaku. It could also have been a requirement from Suzaku's side to work along. Hell, Lelouch could have been conning Suzaku into thinking he was really going to die, when in secret he knew he'd live. I'm not sure I like that thought, but considering Suzaku betrayed him it's not completely inconceivable. I do think this is a strong point though, Suzaku won't nearly be as good as Lelouch, so why replace him if he was alive? (Although, he might be better at achieving peace than Lelouch.) But this is assuming Lelouch knew he'd live.  He could've put it there to convince you that Lelouch died only to have him gloriously come back in the next movie. Or because Lelouch truly believed he would die. Or because he does, is a way, die even if he lives. This is up to personal interpretation.   I'm still kinda pissed about this. Geass powers and over-the-top fanservice aside it was a fairly realistic series without magical powers. This feels like a total cop-out still... (I know the second season was rushed but come on...)"
CodeGeass,12fmv9,tenachiasaca,1 point,Thu Nov 1 18:43:35 2012 UTC,"The code could simply have disappeared? We have nothing proving that if the host is ""deleted"" that the code wouldn't vanish with him. That's how I always saw it. Charles is erased and the code disappears along with him.  Nunnaly wasn't supposed to know that Lelouch was actually ""good"" so he tried to make her hate him. If he showed her with his code, that would have negated that entire act and made her hate him temporarily for nothing. If it wasn't a decision by him however, it was a slight cop-out from the creators to not leave nunnaly hating her brother for the rest of her life.  If Lelouch didn't know he would survive, then Suzaku and Orange would have no reason to try to prevent people from asserting that Lelouch did in fact die. I won't say this is absoloute as Suzaku could have gone to comfort Nunnaly, and then noticed Lelouch being alive and started the cover up there. I'll let that one slide as plausible, with Zero using his status to prevent people from checking.  Of course, Lelouch living in a secret room would have to stay low profile, but couldn't he just be living there, by himself, with Nunnaly and Sayoko? I wouldn't put it past him he he did indeed survive. That is assuming that he didn't just take up the guise of Zero once again.  No matter what, if Lelouch survived, but didn't stay with Nunnaly, he would be punishing her in turn with himself. She would be forced to live a life without her brother, despite it being completely possible to live with him.  I'd like to reply to your fourth paragraph, but I just can't figure out the context, forgive me :("
CodeGeass,12fmv9,Ryuuzoji,1 point,Thu Nov 1 20:51:21 2012 UTC,"That's definitely possible, although to me that feels like a major cop-out as well. Considering what C.C. went through and what that nun went through because of their codes and in order to get rid of them... for it to disappear just like that kinda takes away from their story. Although I have to admit I still don't quite understand why Charles suddenly got deleted. Lelouch said something and then he was gone. Do you know what happend?  Right, it could have been that Lelouch had a change of heart or a moment of weakness. Maybe he finally realized Nunnallys real pain. Although that doesn't really fit his personality Nunnally has always been a slightly ridiculous sore spot for him. (Not being able to lie to her through the phone I mean... come on.) I completely agree the other option is a cop-out as well but considering the Nunnally-is-magic official story that part is a cop-out regardless.   Yeah of course it should be possible. Though considering Nunnallys status it wouldn't be that easy either. (Especially if Nunnally realizing what really happened wasn't part of the plan.) Zero's authority could help though. But I don't think Lelouch is the kind of guy that could just sit back and relax. He seems more like the person that goes to another continent and keeps watch over things from there, maybe communicating with Zero to help him keep thing going smoothly. But yeah, regardless of the situation, Nunnally will be suffering. Though I think she's stronger than Lelouch made her out to be. Maybe he realizes that now as well.  Sorry, I should have been clearer! Do you mean the part about Suzaku? Or about Lelouch possibly coming back in the new movie?"
CodeGeass,12fmv9,tenachiasaca,1 point,Thu Nov 1 23:02:34 2012 UTC,"I don't think of it as a cop out. While the code of immortality is indeed normally hard to get rid of, the thought elevator is the conjoined human subconsciousness, a massive power which has can apparently delete a human from the world. If the code is part of Charles, I can't see the problem. They can't ""die"" with the code, but deletion like Lelouch does to Charles is possible, and the code could be deleted with him.  For how it works, I can only offer my guess. Charles and Marianne wanted to harm the human subconciousness or at least manipulate it, making them a threat to it. Lelouch either made it aware of them being a threat or used it himself to target them. As they are asking why C.C. isn't disappearing with them, and she says it's because she's lost faith in the plan, leading me to believe its the first option.  The Nunnaly thing I don't really have much more to say to.  You're saying that Lelouch would travel to China and keep contact with Zero (through some means) and help direct it, rather than being living with Nunally, and not doing anything? I think he would be living with Nunnaly (secretly) and could give Zero directions from there. It would probably be a lot safer to have him live in the room behind the closet in Nunnaly's room and talk to Zero from there rather than through any other means. Basicly: Why go to another country when he could hide near Nunnaly and fulfill the same function?"
CodeGeass,12fmv9,nicjoeone,1 point,Sun Nov 4 18:33:15 2012 UTC,"It would kind of make sense that the conjoined human subconsciousness could absorb/delete (absorb makes more sense to me since dead people don't disappear either, but it could be either) people but at the same time Charles isn't actually human anymore. The code is something that can be stolen and given away without direct injury (V.V. was still alive after his code was stolen by Charles), so it's not truly part of them. Could the collection of the human consciousness delete something that that's neither human nor has anything to do with consciousness? It's not too big of a leap I guess, but it still feels like a cop-out to me. But that's just me.   Well I remember that Lelouch used his geass on the collective consciousness in order to keep time moving on. (Which should have technically meant that he used his geass on everyone, which means he shouldn't have been able to use his geass at all any more, but that's another discussion.) They were definitely a threat to that, so in order to make the geass come true, they deleted Marianne and Charles? That does make sense. Now the only completely unclear thing to me is still the rules concerning C.C.'s world. Do you think Lelouch would go there after death?   I just can't imagine Lelouch locking himself up and sitting still. He's too much of a control freak and would be too worried about things falling apart and ruining the peace. As to the details I was just kind of ranting, sorry. Though you can't fulfill the same function from a room and actually being out there. Inside a room he'd have to rely on the media and reports from Zero, outside he could gather his own information and set up his own network. Of course that'd be quite risky as well so I don't know.   Either way, I'm reserving final judgement until after the movie. I still think both versions are possible, with both versions having cop-out moments. Both versions have their symbolism (Lelouch's death mirrored with Euphies death, Lelouch's revival mirrored with Jesus ect.) and the final moments could be used either way. C.C. could be talking to Lelouch directly, or in the way she talked to Marianne or he could be in C.C's world. (Though the pink crane makes me wonder. It has no value for C.C., why would she take it?)"
CodeGeass,12fmv9,Ryuuzoji,1 point,Sun Nov 4 22:23:31 2012 UTC,"So, I've been reading your discussion but, I can't come to terms with an immortal code just disappearing. Also, after Charles V.

I can only assume this is because you can only have 1 immortal code at a time."

He can't take her code and live forever in her place if he has to die for the peace of the world."

I haven't dug too far into why he is dead, but I'm sure there are some.  My opinion, simplified: In C's World, he took Charles' code when Charles was eliminated, which is why Lelouch told Suzaku to stand back. Lelouch kept his Geass since he didn't take C.C's, but V.V's instead. Thus, he achieved Code Geass. Since it was his first time ""dying,"" it took him awhile to regain consciousness and find C.C to tell her what happened and flee Japan.  There are more elaborate versions out there."

We have school Lelouch as you explained who did love Shirley in a certain way or at least cared about her deeply we'll never know but we do know she loved Lelouch but only his fake persona but because of her love for him she was willing to love him as zero.   Then we have Zero as you explained again but I disagree with you here Zero is just another mask to hide his real self this mask is what Kallen and Kaguya fell in love with.   Then we have the part you didn't  mention the real Lelouch as I said before both Zero and everyday Lelouch are just masks to hide the his real personality which is a combination of both everyday and zero he only shows his true self when hes alone or with CC. This is who CC fell in love with and I do believe he loved her back.
CodeGeass,11z97i,electricninjaHEI,1 point,Wed Oct 24 07:26:48 2012 UTC,"I don't know if Lelouch ever loved Shirley, but if he did, he only realized it and allowed himself to love after it was already too late. He may have felt some kind of loss after Geassing away her troubled and conflicted feelings and memories of him/Zero, but all other times prior she was basically invisible to him."
CodeGeass,11z97i,megacookie,0,Wed Oct 24 13:21:30 2012 UTC,"Not sure, i would have to imagine he cared about her, but as far as loving her goes, i don't know if he actually could.  I think of it this way, Lelouch was insane. He was right royally off his conker, I would say, the millisecond after he shot Clovis. He treated everyone like pawns before that, but I think that after he killed his own brother, a piece he didn't need anymore, he saw all human life as rungs on the ladder for his own ascension. The only exception to this was Nunnally, but i think that stemmed from him using Nunally as a way of fighitng the injustices put on him, while still getting to feel like a knight for justice.   He cared about Shirely certainly, but not because he loved her but because she was a piece he didn't need, but was determined not to throw away, as his father would have. He failed, the helpless piece that was Shirely fell, and then he was forced to use her as he never wanted to, as a piece of his plan so he could kill Rolo. She was a piece of his world that he couldn't ontrol, a simple wek piece whos fate he should have been able to secure, but he failed to do so, her death was his weakness.  Did he love her, i don't think he could love her, or aynone, short of another game master. I think that's why he came to care about CC, she was playing her own game, using her own pawns, she was on his level, no longer simply a piece for him to use. A man as obbsessed with power as Lelouch, i think, could only love someone who he didn't have power over."
CodeGeass,11z97i,Farfener,0,Wed Feb 6 02:52:27 2013 UTC,"hmmm.... colour me at least partially mind-changed, i hadn't thought about those examples in particular, certainly something interesting to think about. I still lean more towards my way of thinking, that lelouch was one stick short of a bundle, still a perfectly functional bundle mind you, but perhaps i was a little hard on him. i still think, however, that he would have regarded those feelings with some measure of distain. This is a man who wants to control the world, who must maintain control over himself and others, and i would rather suspect that love is somewhat of an irritant to him, it has a way of throwing rationality and logic out the window, and he was no exception to this rule as you pointed out. He had to take risky actions just to try and keep his firends, people who were not useful to his plan, safe. I figure that, if he did love Shirley, he didn't allow himself to love her until the very end, out of fear of losing control.  There is just one more thing.  I am concious of the diffrence between Kira and Lelouch, as well as being aware of the similarities between them. I am completely and fully aware that they are different, and that Lelouch is a little more rational/sane/compassionate than Light was, but he was equally willing to throw away his humanity for the greater good, ala his ""willingness to destory' speeh to Kaguya, however more noble his goals were that Light's. I think the reason Lelouch seemed a little softer was he had his sister to mellow him out, and to guide his actions towards other people, not just her. He helps the helpless, not so much becasue he cares about them as people, but rather because they are helpless, he's fighitng the disease, not fighting for the patient as it were."
CodeGeass,11z97i,Farfener,-1,Wed Oct 24 03:24:08 2012 UTC,"If I had to guess, probably not. He blames himself for everything bad that happened to Shirley."
CodeGeass,11z97i,CritHitLights,-1,Wed Oct 24 07:13:24 2012 UTC,If he was in love with anyone it was her. Every other woman he showed interest in was for some gains in the political arena. Shirley had no political advantage to show affection towards.
CodeGeass,11z97i,2Cor517,3,Thu Oct 25 06:02:36 2012 UTC,"I don't want to start a fan-war-debate but what about CC, his relationship with her was the most complex, he did care for her and viewed her as his equal by the middle of R2 and she had nothing to offer him politically. His relationship with Shirly was different he probably viewed her as a best friend nothing more plus he does blame himself for a lot that went wrong with her life i.e her father dying."
CodeGeass,11z97i,electricninjaHEI,1 point,Wed Oct 24 01:05:15 2012 UTC,"CC was the one who gave him his power. I don't know, he was so inconsistent with his actions, it is crazy."
CodeGeass,11z97i,2Cor517,3,Wed Oct 24 01:47:03 2012 UTC,"I don't think he LOVED anyone, because he knew the general idea of his plan from the start. I do think that he LIKED both CC and Shirley, but knew it would be impractical to date Shirley or CC."

CodeGeass,11z97i,MrPleasureBear,1 point,Wed Oct 24 02:45:38 2012 UTC,"Kallen only loved Zero and not the real Lelouch, like many characters in the series she didn't really know Lelouch's true personality."
CodeGeass,11z97i,electricninjaHEI,0,Wed Oct 24 05:24:07 2012 UTC,"I don't know, I felt that she grew to see who Lelouch really was near the end and see through the masks he put up."
CodeGeass,11z97i,MrPleasureBear,2,Mon Oct 29 00:51:29 2012 UTC,"She knew way before any of the other Black Knights that Zero was her classmate Lelouch (but probably didnt know he was of the royal family). I think somewhere she did mention she was conflicted between her idolization of Zero and the fact he's a spoilt Britannian kid her age. But she still develops feelings for him, thus feels disdain when he appears impassive and cruel to her attempts at closeness, which of course we know is because he doesnt want her to meet the same kind of fate Shirley did for getting too close."
CodeGeass,11z97i,megacookie,1 point,Mon Oct 29 02:30:40 2012 UTC,I didn't feel that way at all. The moment when she kinda knew the real Lelouch was the end of the series.
CodeGeass,11z97i,electricninjaHEI,1 point,Mon Oct 29 17:33:12 2012 UTC,"Well, I felt that she more or less admired Zero. It wasn't until she realized that Zero and Lelouch were one in the same that her feelings began to develop. Not to mention it wasn't until after Kallen saw through his mask and his plan that she summed together her feelings and admitted that she loved him.   As for the OP, I don't think Lelouch loved Shirley, or any other woman in that way. He definitely cared for them, as seen in various ways but in the end, he chose Nunnally and his plans over them all."
CodeGeass,11z97i,McMuffin27,1 point,Wed Feb 6 02:31:53 2013 UTC,"During R1 Kallen had a love/crush on Zero. She did fall in with love him at the start of R2 but again she knew nothing about his true self. For a long time she thought he was a traitor only after the end series did she realize the kind of person he was, but yet again she still didn't really know him."
CodeGeass,11z97i,electricninjaHEI,1 point,Mon Oct 29 18:30:01 2012 UTC,"She did not know him in the sense that she could only figure out his noble intentions after the fact, but even prior she couldn't see him as the traitor the others did. When he (as Emperor) visited the Academy, she was the one that decided to make a move and kiss him, and when the Black Knights had captured him and were prepared to execute him, Kallen was by his side until he said some pretty horrid things to get her off and out of the line of fire. Really, the only reason she didnt completely fall for him was because he didnt let her."

I think Johnny Yong Bosch did a superb job as Lelouch, and Lloyd's voice actor was also great, putting in that amazing accent. Really, the only reason people don't recommend the english dub is because the japanese voices are absolutely fantastic too. With that being said, go with whatever you want, since they're both amazing. If your gf prefers english voices, go ahead. I also felt english definitely fits the show sometimes, as evidenced by how much english there is in the japanese version.  ""Yes! Mai Lorhd!"""

CodeGeass,11ouov,MakenCheez,3,Tue Oct 23 21:24:22 2012 UTC,"I suggest the dub. It's best for people who are slightly new to anime, and the voice actors are brilliant. Also, Lelouch's last words are much cooler in dub than in sub."
CodeGeass,11ouov,tHEkCAJ,3,Mon Nov 26 09:51:00 2012 UTC,Have to agree with everyone and say the dub. I have seen both and the dub resonates better. The phrasing of the sub can be a bit foreign sounding at times. The dub is awesome.

More importantly: WHY DO I HAVE TO WAIT TILL SPRING FOR THE NEXT EPISODE?!  edit: remembered that Xin's full name was mentioned as Hyuuga so fairly certain Xin and Akito are brothers separated for whatever important, plot-riveting reason."

I agree the characters are a bit shallow now, but tbh, weren't the R2 characters just as shallow? I'm just really happy to have a show revolving around these issues though, not to mention the absolutely beautiful, fluid animation. The kinghtmares literally blew me away.   Admittedly, I DO miss the wackyness of the previous seasons and I can sense that this series is gonna be a lot darker than Code Geass and R2, but hopefully with the addition of Suzaku and C.C to the mix, things will get a bit more familiar!"

Wasn't a big fan of the design of the new robot - the insect and transforming part I liked, but in robot mode, the face is a little too round, and looked 'toyish'. Certainly original but previously the main robots (Lancelot etc) were incredibly striking and impressive in terms of design."

I feel like the Geass is to cause people to suddenly have the desire to die. That will explain how Xin never once told him to die. With Lelouch, phrasing meant everything as he was giving commands. Xin merely used his Geass and the man (I forgot his name) voluntarily killed himself without order. I feel like there is a relation between Xin and Akito based on what I've seen."

To see the magnificent bastard struggle and finally accomplish his goal, killing himself in the process made me shed several tears.   The second saddest to me was Rolo, because of how naive he was."
CodeGeass,ztidh,Silvadream,7,Thu Sep 13 18:04:41 2012 UTC,"I actually would say that is my favorite scene. Although it is sad, all of the deaths and violence preceding it would have been worthless without Lelouch's death. Still sad though. Lelouch is awesome."
CodeGeass,ztidh,MakenCheez,6,Fri Sep 14 14:14:27 2012 UTC,"I agree. Lelouch's death was absolutely beautiful; it redeemed his character in some aspect in my eyes. If he had let himself live, he would have been as contemptible as Charles and Schniezel. I cried during that scene, though; seeing him die was heart wrenching and beautiful.  Edit: I think the saddest part of the finale was when Cornelia shouted, ""Lelouch the Demon is dead!"" That title was so vicious and cruel; it hurt me to think that that was Lelouch's legacy."
CodeGeass,ztidh,megacookie,5,Tue Sep 18 06:16:35 2012 UTC,"The world he saved spits on his grave and calls him a Demon. It's sad, but it's exactly how the Zero Requiem is supposed to work. Focus all the hate on a (now dead) guy, and with everyone agreeing on something for once, they will stop tearing each other apart. Because he's the hero the world deserves, but not the one it needs right now... and so we'll hate him... because he can take it... because he's not a demon king... he's an idealist genius... a faceless chessmaster... a Black Knight...Zero"

I loved the ending but wanted more,  I knew if I got more it wouldn't be the same, and I knew it would be a while until I found a show that gave me that feeling.  Shirley's death  Euphimias  Lelouch's death  Rolo's death  In that order."
CodeGeass,ztidh,Blan21,5,Thu Sep 13 14:19:02 2012 UTC,"I cried buckets watching Rolo's death. Lelouch's last words to him were perfect--broke my heart in the most touching way possible.  The finale of Zero Requiem was definitely sad; Lelouch's final act as a martyr, giving up the name of Zero in addition to his own life*, immortalized him as a character (for me).   Both Rolo's and Lelouch's deaths were carried out through pure selflessness. Rolo died for Lelouch; Lelouch died for world unity. Both could be considered ultimate acts of atonement.    *Personally, I don't believe Lelouch is dead. When I say he died, I refer to his identity as the tyrant, Lelouch vi Britannia."
CodeGeass,ztidh,megacookie,0,Wed Oct 10 19:14:45 2012 UTC,"Technically he did die either way. Even if he did acquire the code from defeating his father, there was no knowing of its implications. To activate the code, you really do have to die. And really, he didnt kill his immortal father, he just convinced the gods to survive and reject Charles's plan, absorbing him in the process. So it's equally possible he did die, and the scene with C.C on the wagon could just be her talking to herself or a dead Lelouch within C's World. What my point is, Lelouch's big, orchestrated assassination at Suzaku's hands wasnt just a way of escaping the angry and victimized public, of escaping his crimes under a false death, of shedding a role and public face like a pair of dirty clothes. Sure, it's the sort of thing you'd expect of his dramatic and unpredictable style, pulling a fast one on the world, but it's much more powerful an ending if he goes into certain and absolute death willingly, repenting for the sins needed to reach his end goal and paying for the world with his life. Whether the code returns him to the land of the living to live happily ever after with C.C is really not up to him. Or so I'd like to think."

CodeGeass,yfz0e,luis_carlos_92,14,Sat Aug 18 21:09:07 2012 UTC,"I am in the minority crowd which believes he is dead. Lelouch never killed Charles so he never got his code. C.C actually kills the nun she works with, and Charles kills V.V but Lelouch never kills Charles. Then C.C is praying for Lelouch's safe passage to Heaven, why else would she be praying? If he was immortal there would be no need. Furthermore, we saw that when C.C and Charles died and their codes activated and they sprung right back to life, however Lelouch lies dead in Nunally's arms. Jeramiah does not smile, I see it as him barring his teeth in grim despair, however although he loves and respects Lelouch he knows Zero Requiem has to work for the greater good of the world. However Suzaku  definitely does cry at the end, if he knew Lelouch couldn't be killed why would he be upset that he kills him? When Lelouch is dead in Nunally's arms, if Lelouch was alive wouldn't he of just whispered something to her? Also when he was talking to Suzaku, he was talking about Geass as in a ""wish"" which was mentioned earlier, Suzaku accepts the wish of becoming Zero. And at the end C.C was just talking to herself."
CodeGeass,yfz0e,Exposedo,5,Sun Aug 19 02:01:52 2012 UTC,"Lelouch never killed Charles so he never got his code.    Why is that necessarily though? Is that mentioned in the series? I don't remember that.   why else would she be praying?   She knows what it's like to be immortal and prays to give Lelouch strength to endure it? I think other reasons can be valid. (See Guardianlettuce's comment.)   and they sprung right back to life,    That's just not true. C.C. took so long to regenerate at one point that Lelouch actually cleaned out her wounds and tried to nurse her back to health. He realized it was pointless quickly, but there was a significant time lap. I don't remember the exact point, but they end up in a cave and Lelouch finds out C.C.'s real name. (So before Mao's ending.)   would he be upset that he kills him?   He doesn't have to be. He could be upset that he now officially never gets his death wish fulfilled, maybe he's angry Lelouch gets away with it. Maybe he's emotional that Lelouch would give up so much, including Nunnally. Plenty of alternative reasons, imho.   wouldn't he of just whispered something to her?   No. At that point he believed she hated him, and it would be best if he became the object of hatred so that everyone (including Nunnally) could move on. (That's what allowed him to use his Geass on her.)"
CodeGeass,yfz0e,Exposedo,1 point,Sun Aug 19 19:29:25 2012 UTC,"Of course it is necessary, how else do you steal the Code? Can you just look at somebody who has the Code and then randomly take it off them, it is implied beyond doubt that you have to kill them to get the Code. You could say that she is praying for Lelouch because he has become immortal, but he hasn't become immortal, so she's not. You could say she is crying because Kallen turned into an elephant, but Kallen didn't turn into an elephant, so you would rule that out. The thing with regeneration is that the first time the Code activates, with C.C and with Charles they had zero time relapse, so why would it be different with Lelouch? If he was not dead wouldn't Nunally be able to feel his heart when she puts the side of her head up against his chest? Suzaku is not angry at Lelouch, he loves Lelouch, he may never quite forgive him for killing Euphemia but he is still Lelouch's one true friend and goes along with Zero Requiem and accepts Lelouch's wish to protect the world by working as Zero. ""Maybe he's emotional that Lelouch would give up so much."" you talk as if you agre he is going to die. Do you really think Lelouch would go into hiding with C.C for the rest of his life? And finally, when Nunally is crying, saying, ""I love you big brother, how am I going to be able to live without you,"" it is pretty clear that she doesn't hate him, he couldn't become the object of her hatred because she knows why he did what he had to do."
CodeGeass,yfz0e,Milko3399,5,Mon Aug 20 05:59:01 2012 UTC,"That doesn't make sense though. If the death of the original code-holder is a requirement for the ability to steal the code, V.V. would have been dead, not dying. Charles had V.V.'s code while V.V. was still alive. Also, technically, Lelouch and Cornelia killed V.V., not Charles. (Charles just caused the mortality that allowed Lelouch and Cornelia to kill him.) So I don't see where that is implied beyond doubt, if I'm missing something though please tell me. (C.C. at one point asks why Charles decided to steal V.V.'s code now, but I don't remember if that's before or after V.V.'s death.)  Do we know if C.C. had an actual heartbeat? Either way I don't think you would feel a (probably weak) heartbeat through several layers of clothing that you don't expect while absolutely crying your eyes out. I don't have experience with that, though.  He is going to die, in a way. He can never see anyone ever again, he gives up the entire live he built for himself and all the people dear to him. And yes, I do think he would go into hiding for the rest of his life. He was already hiding as Zero, might as well finish the job and make sure everything works out as planned.   Right, after she sees his memories, and understand why he did everything he did, he is not the object of her hatred. Before though, it sure looked like it. But even if he wasn't, Lelouch thought he was, or at the very least planned to become that for Nunally. That's what allowed him to use his Geass on her. There's no way to tell if the memories she saw were on purpose or part of the plan. It seems much more likely Lelouch didn't calculate them."
CodeGeass,yfz0e,GuardianLettuce,-1,Mon Aug 20 14:03:17 2012 UTC,"Charle's Code did not activate until V.V was dead, so how do you know he had his Code before he died? On your second point I was talking about Lelouch, when you said C.C was that a typo, because I meant the part where Lelouch has just been slain and Nunally has her head on his chest. For the third point, with all of Lelouch's cunning and organisation, do you think he would just cast Nunally out of his life? He wouldn't, she meant too much to him for Lelouch to run away and never see her again. When he was hiding as Zero he still saw Nunally all the time, the only way he could cast her out of his life would be if he died. And I don't think Nunally ever hated Lelouch, she is crying and wishing for him not to die before she sees the memories."
CodeGeass,yfz0e,Raxiel,3,Tue Aug 21 06:02:35 2012 UTC,"Was that shown directly in the anime? How? I don't remember. It would seem very weird that Charles didn't directly kill V.V. Not knowing when exactly immortality kicks in seems like quite a risk. And yes, that's exactly what I think what Lelouch would do. His main goal has always been creating a gentle world for her. If his separation is necessary so be it. He already killed so many, he can't back out now. Suzaku wouldn't let him anyway."
CodeGeass,yfz0e,T_L_K,-2,Wed Aug 22 20:44:47 2012 UTC,"""Was that shown directly in the anime?"" what part are you talking about? Charles directly killed V.V, he had to of because that was how he got his Code. Charles must have known that killing V.V would grant him the Code, there are various theories as to how he would know, V.V telling him directly is very plausible. I'm not really sure what you mean at the end, but Lelouch would not be able to live, separated from Nunally for the rest of his life, however dying for her is a completely logical explanation, it showcases the extent of his love."
CodeGeass,yfz0e,Kinder_Surprises,2,Thu Aug 23 06:36:52 2012 UTC,"No I meant the part where he received the code. I remember seeing the effects of the code (the sign, reviving) but I don't remember seeing the actual moment where he received the code. So I decided to look at the relevant episodes again because my memory is significantly more fuzzy than I thought (I honestly thought V.V. was killed during battle, but he survived to crawl back to the cave.) I didn't see the emperor actually stealing the code. But I did see that V.V. was definitely alive even while his code was gone. After V.V. transports Lelouch to the emperor (at which point the emperor is already immortal) C.C. finds V.V. in said cave and notices he's shaking and about to collapse. She then says, surprised ""What's... V.V., are you...?"" (Dying? Mortal?) Charles doesn't come back and finish him off, so it makes sense that his severe wounds killed him. This would suggest stealing a code through death isn't necessary. I'll just agree to disagree on the last point, because I definitely think Lelouch can do that."

At this point, the code activated and he came back to life. You have to die in order to be brought back by the code it would seem.  You can't do anything but interpret what he would do about Nunally. Personally, I believe he would simply watch her from the sidelines as she was seen to be some sort of representative of Japan in the end. He could simply have moved into the country side with CC in order to disappear and watch the world he sacrificed his mortal life for grow as it left hatred in the past."
CodeGeass,yfz0e,xdavid00,1 point,Thu Aug 30 19:46:14 2012 UTC,"The thing with regeneration is that the first time the Code activates, with C.C and with Charles they had zero time relapse, so why would it be different with Lelouch? If he was not dead wouldn't Nunally be able to feel his heart when she puts the side of her head up against his chest?  Lelouch is really smart so he would've anticipated this. He could've shot himself Earlyier and sprang back to life. This would make him recover over a long period of time like C.C did. So it stands to reason his heart would be incredibly weak or even stopped."
CodeGeass,yfz0e,welch7,9,Fri Dec 14 16:53:28 2012 UTC,"I just re-watched the ending and am starting to think that Lelouch did live past the Zero Requiem. Most of the points you listed are the same ones that convinced me. One scene however makes me confident that Lelouch does live. It's the scene where C.C is at a church, crying because of Lelouch's death and the price for casting Geass on the world.  Now she could be crying because she had fallen in love with Lelouch, she's immortal however so the concept of losing loved ones shouldn't be so foreign. Sure she would grieve but afterwards she's shown smiling and talking contentedly.  Now why is that?   I believe that C.C was crying because Lelouch would give himself immortality through his plan, something she had experienced and not enjoyed which was the reason for her crying.  The reason that she is so content later on however is that she is no longer alone. C.C believed that Geass would force her to live an immortal life alone until she passed the Code to someone else. With Lelouch now immortal however her belief was proven wrong which explains, at least for me, her final lines.  Now does this change the significance of the ending? It depends on the person really. Ultimately dying to change the world is a noble and powerful ending, one that many people find makes the emotions more powerful.   The ending where Lelouch is immortal, probably outliving everyone except for C.C, could be just as emotionally powerful. He will see his friends age and die while he remains young. As he will most likely be remembered for the rest of history Lelouch will not be able to connect with new people as they may recognize him as the Britannian Emperor killed by Zero. In a way this may be worse as he is forced to abandon everything he achieved and enjoy it in secrecy while also being careful that no one recognizes him.  Sorry for the wall of text but I just wanted to get my opinion through.  TL,DR: Lelouch is alive."

He gives up everything he had, everyone he knew (except C.C.), and has to live the rest of his (immortal) life almost completely alone. which I think would be harder to do than just deciding to die."

CodeGeass,xz6py,biei098,2,Fri Aug 10 11:00:40 2012 UTC,"Absolutely awesome theory! Especially how it explains the title! This fits much better than any other Lelouch is alive/dead theories, imho. I do have a few questions though. Why would the Emperor give Lelouch his code? (Lelouch could have stolen it as well.) If Lelouch was aware of the code, he must've been aware he would be alive. So would C.C. and possibly Suzaku. Why did they cry? Is it because they knew they'd never see him again? Because Lelouch finally achieved his goal? Because he achieved his goal but would be hated forever? Did he not tell Suzaku?   Even still, this is much more solid. It also makes sense for Lelouch to stick around after, to make sure everything keeps going well. Not being able to see Nunally must be killing him though... maybe that's why Suzaku's crying."
CodeGeass,xz6py,biei098,4,Fri Aug 10 18:14:45 2012 UTC,"I can't say that Lelouch knew about the Code coming from the emperor because if he had know, when Nunally had touched Lelouch and saw his memories then she would know that Lelouch would still be alive and not  have cried out in anguish. In addition, you could say that the ""gift"" of the code from the emperor was actually a curse. In the final moments of the emperor's life Lelouch scolds him about change being the perfect world. Peace could be achieved through time and understanding and death is a motivator to progress as a society. Because Lelouch valued mortality and humanity the ultimate revenge would be to make Lelouch immortal."
CodeGeass,xz6py,biei098,1 point,Sat Aug 11 05:15:54 2012 UTC,"Good point! I completely forgot about that. Though I guess it's possible that she didn't quite see all his memories (especially in such a short time span, and Lelouch didn't see all of C.C. memories either), it would make more sense if he didn't know. That would also mean he was truly willing to lay down his life which is much more awesome imho.   That makes a lot of sense too... I still don't quite get Ragnarok/C.C.'s world but this seems to fit well!"
CodeGeass,xz6py,biei098,2,Sun Aug 12 17:30:41 2012 UTC,"Lelouch saw some of C.C.'s memories a few time. Each time was after Lelouch had already gotten the Geass except for one, when Lelouch received the Geass. Before Lelouch ""signed"" the contract and got the Geass his mind went to ""C.C.'s"" world (the thought world) and he sees a group of people with the Geass symbol on their foreheads and distorted images of other things. I would also like to point out that CC has to share her mind for Lelouch to see any memories. The prime example is when CC gives Suzaku shock images so Lelouch can get away. Lelouch tries to grab CC and she tells him not to because at that moment she opened the ""thought world/elevator"" (which is like a collective consciousness) to see and use Suzakus' memories. Lelouch accidentally invades CCs' thoughts because she opened the link to the elevator. CC can touch other people and not share memories. So one of 2 things is occurring 1. CC has to let people in to the ""though world"" or they have to have the powers of the Code, like the emperor or 2. Lelouch, having the Geass, can share memories even if it's involuntary.  The memories themselves are important. Every time a memory is seen or used it is a memory of the worst thing to happen to that person, ie Suzaku killing his father, Sherly losing her father, and CC being betrayed by the only person that loved her. It stands to reason that the most important, worst thing to happen to Lelouch is the act of being immortal and having to abandon Nunally and all his friends in order to save the world. So, the memory that Nunally most-likely would see is that, the pain of shaming his sister and abandoning her. Back to the 2 ""thought world"" problems.                                                                                              1. If a Code holder can open a connection to the thought world, then we can confirm that Lelouch received the Code from the emporer, is immortal, and, most likely, accidentally opened the thought world as Nunally touched him. Which would give her access to Lelouchs' memories. Being that her thoughts and Lelouchs' thoughts would most certainly revolve around his death, or lack there of, those memories pertaining to Lelouchs' life would be first to be viewed. 2. If a Geass user can access others memories then, as outlandish as it may be, Nunally could have Geass and that would be how she accessed Lelouchs' memories just as Lelouch had entered CCs'.   Sorry about the length if this one. It's late so I may have rambled. Please ask questions about this one if you need clarification because I may left some things out."

Didn't he destroy the thought elevator?"
CodeGeass,xz6py,FORGDEDELILT,1 point,Sun Aug 19 19:04:30 2012 UTC,"Theoretically the sword of akasha was created by the emperor to destroy ""God"". The idea was that the blade would pierce the heavens and cause time to stop. If time was removed from the equation bodies wouldn't decay and people wouldn't die. If time didn't exist you could even retrieve people from the ""past"" because the past wouldn't exist; that's why the emperor tried to use Lelouchs' mother and Euphemia as leverage to persuade Lelouch and Susaku.  Lelouch destroyed the thought elevator (sword of akasha) which would have caused time to stop, thus leaving the world in its normal state of change and progress. He ensured that time=mortality would cause people to try to better themselves to achieve peace."
CodeGeass,xz6py,AndrasZodon,1 point,Wed Aug 22 03:42:46 2012 UTC,"That makes sense... so what about these mask things?

CodeGeass,xz6py,ReoRak,1 point,Wed Aug 22 21:09:33 2012 UTC,"I need to go back and make sure, but I believe that the masks represent the individual consciousness of everyone. Each mask is almost identical to any of the other masks yet there are minor differences. They represent the faceless masses of people (meaning all people including the people you never see, so how can you place a face you've never seen) and the ""masks"" of deception each person wears. The significance of the lecture the Emperor has with Lelouch is that he points out that Lelouch, who believes he is above reproach and justified, is two faced and lies to everyone around him so that no one truly knows who he is. In essence Lelouch is a person from the huddled masses and not the hero he thinks he is.  Destroying the thought elevator doesn't destroy the mask; however, you could say that destroying the masks would free the people from uniformity."

I shall put myself under the Geass known as the wishes of the world."" <-- something like that .__.""  So, in the death scene, Suzaku is simply restating what Lelouch said, saying that he is taking that Geass, the ""wishes of the world,"" from Lelouch.  *I haven't watched in a while; so correct me if I'm wrong. I also watched only the subbed version, if that affects anything. (I don't remember him saying that ""for eternity"" part, for one.) JK HE DOES SAY IT.

However, the most important thing is moving the King and then calling checkmate is definitely and completely possible.  All you have to do is make moving the King into a ""discovered check"".  For example having a Rook behind and moving the King out of the way.  EDIT: Also, starting with the King doesn't necessarily mean the King is the first piece to be moved.  Generally pawns are ignored in these cases as you always start with the pawn (unless you move Knight for some reason), so the first back-row piece you move is the piece you start with.  It's pretty unusual of a start to be sure but it can be worked around with some Knights and whatnot."

Glad I didn't but I still wish they didn't add in the whole king move first stupidity. I know they're trying to build his character but they could have done it in a more intelligent way.
CodeGeass,wokli,Aerdirnaithon,2,Tue Jul 24 05:08:44 2012 UTC,"The game is quite advanced when Lelouch joins in on it, so moving the King would have been completely possible. 4:40 shows the board clearly. Lelouch is black.  Now, there are certainly scenes in which the chess play is bad / illegal, but moving the King first in this case was not illegal."
CodeGeass,wokli,mto92,1 point,Mon Aug 6 21:37:17 2012 UTC,"My point is not that it's illegal, just that it is a terrible move, and all but impossible, in almost all cases to move the king for an offensive. I say impossible because the king can only move one space at a time so the opposing player would have to move all his pieces to the other side of the board or have the king moved all the way across which would be suicidal.   Regardless of all of that, looking at that specific chess game, the teams are practically even with black having 25 points worth of guys and white having 24 points. I don't know why the guy saying the game was impossible to win because it is almost a complete tie. Also in this case, if Lelouch took over for the black team, there is no legal place for him to move his king as every space around it would put him in check and as such is illegal, at least if the white team started at the far end of the board. If he took over for white then the king has two possible moves, either into the corner or one space to the right, neither of which doing anything positive and just resulting in a waste of a move.  I really don't understand why I'm getting downvoted for this nor do I really care but this point did bug me when I first watched the show. I realize it doesn't really matter and at this point I could care less as I really enjoyed the show but when I first start a new series I tend to pick up on errors or dumb things and get more annoyed at them then I should.

LeLouch being alive is something people who didn't get the point of the show clings to. They didn't understand LeLouch's motto, and they don't get that LeLouch didn't see himself as superior to the rest of the human race. Throughout the series I saw him as a bit of a coward.

CodeGeass,wm795,weston12,-2,Mon Jul 16 06:05:51 2012 UTC,"The thing is, if one had only watched the English version, saw Suzaku brutally kill LeLouche as he says his last words and his sister cries into his bloody corpse than it's not the same ending. I only recently learned of the LeLouche lives ending."
CodeGeass,wm795,RS19,3,Mon Jul 16 02:35:41 2012 UTC,"You have the wrong information, the ending to both the Japanese and English subs/dubs is with CC on the end of a wagon, and then she says, ""Right, Lelouch?"", and then it focuses on the paper crane.   The people that made Code Geass wanted to keep the ending up for interpretation, meaning that CC was talking to heaven/the sky, or if you wanted Lelouch to live, he was driving the cart.  There was a deleted scene from a Home DVD box set with Lelouch's face, but that has been proven fake/ not canon multiple times.  Sub: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WTEnevdPs"

Sure, it's not as strong as it used to be, but the most adaptable people are still those that thrive the most. And the ability to change has always been the most important factor in survival.

As a result, he goes to tell Suzaku to be his comrade with geass, but at the last minute decides he'd just like suzaku to value his own life, and makes him do so in a non-combat based scenario. Suzaku is still in the technology division as well.  I just checked a random chapter of the series. If I had to guess the rest, I'd say that its in part due to their fighting/combat prowess.  Update prior to posting: I may be reading a mobile suit featuring version, however, after meeting lloyd Zero drops a bomb in area 11 in a helicopter piloted by kallen who exlaims/thinks ""he made the impossible possible again"" As if to imply it was his second miracle.

CodeGeass,swlbf,Wolftrex,5,Sat Apr 28 12:30:49 2012 UTC,The lancelot is awesome!
CodeGeass,swlbf,ThePaulium,2,Sat Apr 28 13:33:44 2012 UTC,"The Guren's Radiant Wave Surger is my second favorite weapon, after the Hadron Cannons."
CodeGeass,swlbf,ccbrownsfan,5,Sat Apr 28 20:36:58 2012 UTC,Mine is probably the Knightmare Frame Shinkirou. Everything about it is just awesome. I also love the way Lelouch controls it with a keyboard as opposed to the normal joysticks. Straight badassery.
CodeGeass,swlbf,Wolftrex,4,Sat Apr 28 23:13:02 2012 UTC,"Oh the Shinkirō, with its Absolute Defense System. It is my second favorite unit, and it just so happens that the Gawain is its predecessor. Coincidence? I think not."
CodeGeass,swlbf,TheArtisanOfWar,4,Sat Apr 28 23:36:42 2012 UTC,The Gawain is just awesome. The Guren SEITEN is also completely badass. The Lancelot Albion is also up there.  Edit: Spelling
CodeGeass,swlbf,Colbyyyyy,6,Sat Apr 28 14:52:56 2012 UTC,don't you mean LAENCELOTTOOOO
CodeGeass,swlbf,Colbyyyyy,1 point,Sat Apr 28 17:21:50 2012 UTC,"Yes, the Albion and S.E.I.T.E.N are easily the top two in terms of capabilities. And I like their energy wings, too."

CodeGeass,spxmx,RS19,10,Tue Apr 24 13:47:11 2012 UTC,"I've only ever seen clips of it in subbed. I first watched Code Geass a few years ago, back in a time when I refused to watch anything in subbed and I thought subbed was stupid (Bleach was my first subbed anime, out of necessity, and now I tend to watch more animes in subbed than in dubbed).  Anyways, I think all of the characters (except maybe Nunally) sound great in English, the voice acting is really well done in this show, so I don't see a reason to choose to watch it in subbed. Some animes have bad dubbed voices, but Code Geass is not one of those animes.  Plus, in this case, it makes more sense in this anime for the characters to speak English because most of them are English, and the Japanese have had their country taken over and thus would be forced to speak English by their oppressors. Anyways, just my take on it.  Ninja Edit: Clarification"
CodeGeass,spxmx,RS19,2,Tue Apr 24 18:33:46 2012 UTC,I like Bleach Dub because the same voice actor that plays Lelouch plays Ichigo. But I watched Bleach in Dub then switched to sub because American dub is a little behind. I liked sub to for Bleach.  I really hate Japanese sub in Full Metal Alchemist. I don't know about brotherhood yet.  Death Note I prefer in Sub.
CodeGeass,spxmx,LiamSkylar,3,Tue Apr 24 20:11:20 2012 UTC,"I hate FMA and Brotherhood subbed. Ed is so annoying and sounds like a girl. And Death Note I've seen both ways, but I don't really have a preference."
CodeGeass,spxmx,RS19,1 point,Tue Apr 24 23:04:58 2012 UTC,I've also seen Death Note in both sub and dub. I like Lights voice in Japanese better.  Naruto is like the worst ever when it comes to the dubbed version.
CodeGeass,spxmx,RS19,2,Tue Apr 24 23:10:53 2012 UTC,"Oh god. Naruto is the best argument against dubbing that there is. ""Believe it!"""
CodeGeass,spxmx,SpeedRacing1,9,Tue Apr 24 23:26:28 2012 UTC,"The English voice acting was spot on, so it is only easier and more fitting to watch it in dub. If you say subs are better for any reason other than the English voice acting actually being bad, you are either a hipster or a weaboo. Anyway, the dubbing work was fantastic. Especially the VA for Lelouch. All of them were good, but he stood out  as even better in my opinion."
CodeGeass,spxmx,TwatMobile,6,Tue Apr 24 22:00:24 2012 UTC,I like English Dub.
CodeGeass,spxmx,Skarma64,6,Tue Apr 24 18:13:21 2012 UTC,I just love Lelouches voice in english dub. I think Code Geass english dub was good. They did a good job dubbing it. Just like Full Metal Alchemist.
CodeGeass,spxmx,ccbrownsfan,4,Tue Apr 24 18:30:28 2012 UTC,"huh, I seem to be in the minority here. I think that sub is better. The dub grows on you, and I can at least bear it and still enjoy the series compared to some other dub. However, I just like the Japanese voice acting better."
CodeGeass,spxmx,MudkipBaws,2,Wed Apr 25 20:44:53 2012 UTC,"Maybe in reddit we're the minority, but overall i think there are more viewers of subbed than dubbed"

CodeGeass,sm4on,slightlyGreenTea,1 point,Tue Apr 24 10:20:06 2012 UTC,I can't pull miracles like Zero..  edit: I'm joking.. can't really find R2. I tried.
CodeGeass,slrc0,SpeedRacing1,1 point,Sat Apr 21 21:23:41 2012 UTC,Nice topic.
CodeGeass,skja5,cibino,2,Fri Apr 20 23:35:31 2012 UTC,I don't know man.. the dub was pretty good. I loved Lelouches voice.
CodeGeass,skja5,RS19,5,Sat Apr 21 03:19:33 2012 UTC,this is the only anime i cant recommend someone watch the japanese with english subb's because the fucking dub was so amazing honestly iv watched the series three times twice in english dub and once in japanese and each time i loved all of the voices and they match them so well in the english dub from the japanese that its just too close of a call
CodeGeass,skja5,mrdudefool,2,Sat Apr 21 05:19:47 2012 UTC,I also agree. I prefer the dub over the Japanese audio.
CodeGeass,sia8m,Zman74,7,Thu Apr 19 19:27:04 2012 UTC,I just killed like an hour and a half watching all of those and laughing my ass off. Thank you sir.

CodeGeass,sim2r,RS19,5,Thu Apr 19 22:49:22 2012 UTC,I like this Geass.
CodeGeass,sim2r,Detectiveoftheeast,5,Tue Apr 24 05:35:24 2012 UTC,I accept this Geass.
CodeGeass,sim2r,slightlyGreenTea,6,Tue Apr 24 22:34:39 2012 UTC,"okay I got this.   Geass: Ability, able to kill somebody by writing their name while thinking of their face in a notebook.  Advatage: I can have control over death  Disadvatage: I can no longer go to heaven nor hell"
CodeGeass,sim2r,slightlyGreenTea,6,Thu May 24 16:50:47 2012 UTC,"Geass: everyone within a ten foot radius of me thinks perfectly logically/rationally OR completely based on instinct and reflex.  I can switch between the two at will.  The Geass can also be used from a longer distance if I focus on just one person.  Advantage: Logical side is useful for getting people to see your side in an argument, stop being stupid, or offer good advice.  Instinctual side can turn allies into excellent warriors.  Disadvantage: If an enemy gets too close, they automatically become a brilliant force of reason or a beastly force of nature - both are equally dangerous."
CodeGeass,sim2r,RS19,2,Tue Jun 26 15:21:46 2012 UTC,"I like this one, it's well thought out; did you use your geass on yourself?"
CodeGeass,sim2r,RS19,2,Fri Apr 20 06:36:24 2012 UTC,"haha thank you.  Rationality is a good tool to have.  To counter the disadvantage, I could rapidly switch between logic and instinct.  The enemy wouldn't be able to hold a thought process long enough to act - it's like a combo of paralysis and confusion in pokemon.  Do I have to come up with a new disadvantage now?  :)"
CodeGeass,sim2r,queez,3,Fri Apr 20 08:04:37 2012 UTC,What if you had Rolo's Geass? If it's on 24.7.. that would suck. I would choose Lelouches Geass.
CodeGeass,sim2r,Detectiveoftheeast,1 point,Fri Apr 20 16:08:33 2012 UTC,"You can make a geass up, you know. :)"
CodeGeass,sim2r,Aerdirnaithon,3,Fri Apr 20 00:54:33 2012 UTC,I know but I'm to lazy to think of any creative Geass powers.
