When orks believe something, there's a tendency for reality to bend to match it. A gun shoots bullets without being loaded, a trukk drives without a functioning engine or piss for fuel. I suspect if a large group of orks believe they have a disguise clever enough to trick non-orks, it will become reality, either their appearance suddenly becomes outwardly space-marine-y, or the minds of those that see them actually become altered.   whichever the case, Orks own psychic abilities don't seem to have defined rules, and can be extremely flexible depending on the orks. This frightens me greatly, because physically, orks posses enough numbers alone to overwhelm the galaxy if they were ever to all join forces in a super massive waaagh, but this psychic ability added in, make the prospects for the future extremely daunting.

AskScienceFiction,3e1y39,heruskael,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:29 2015 UTC,"Orks tend to obsess about various pursuits forming subcultures. But as a whole all of them live by the rule of might makes right so there isn't much variance in that.  Incidentally Bad Moons don't ""love building guns and suits of armor"", all orks love that. Bad Moons have a mutation that causes them to grow teeth faster and in greater numbers. Since teeth are ork currency (because having teeth means you were tough enough to punch them out of someone else's mouth and get away with it) it means Bad Moons are very wealthy.  And that wealth expresses itself in lots of expensive equipment like snazzier guns, bigger armor and vehicles with fancy squig leather interiors and such.  Mostly ork subcultures focus on one facet of violence or excitement. Bad Moons like their violence fancy. Speed Freaks like their violence fast. Goffs like their violence straight forward with a minimum of fuss. Snakebites like their violence low tech and back to basics. Blood Axes like their violence disciplined and high tech like those fancy humies. Deathskulls like their violence with increasingly bigger guns made out of looted enemy weaponry and so on.  Perhaps the most distinct ork subculture are space pirates. These orks don't get swept up in the horde but actually work as mercenaries flying their space ships from one job to another. Using their wealth and fancy snazz guns to lend a hand in return for loot and payment before moving on. For ork standards they're surprisingly independent.  Moving a little beyond orks there's a really fun subculture in the Gorka Morka wargame. This game revolves around an ork population descended from an ork spaceship that crash landed on a desert planet. Their whole society revolves around rebuilding a functional spaceship with the junk of their crashed spacehips that's spread around the desert.  As a result there's many rival mobs driving around the deserts in ramshackle vehicles fighting each other for scrap, hoping to gather enough to buy a ticket on the spaceship under construction.  The really fun part is that the primitive human inhabitants of the planet called digga's are so impressed with the mighty orks that their entire culture revolves around imitating orks. They act, dress up and fight like orks complete with savage face paint and scrap metal ork fangs. These digga's cheerfully fight the mobs of orks for scrap and usually fare pretty poorly due to being nowhere as robust as orks.  The orks appreciate their efforts at pursuing a proper lifestyle though."
AskScienceFiction,3e1xle,limeburst2,62,Tue Jul 21 09:27:29 2015 UTC,"He hasn't been failing, he just hasn't succeeded yet.  We don't know exactly how old Thanos is, and I'm not inclined to go up to him and ask him for his age, but chances are he's not as old as the universe.  However long he's been around, though, and however long he's been after the Infinity Stones, you need to realize that he needed to plan things so that he could get all six of the stones, pretty much all at once.  If he tried to obtain each stone individually, then after he retrieved one, the keepers of the other stones would learn of it, and move the stones in their keeping, or increase their protections around their respective stones.  For example, let's say Thanos had traveled to Earth and obtained the stone hidden in the Tesseract.  Heimdall would see it happening, and inform Odin.  Odin would then know that there's someone after the Infinity Stones, and thus he'd have to hide the Aether better, or protect it more thoroughly.    As a result, Thanos has been subtly manipulating events so that he'd be able to claim all six stones in one fell swoop.  That involves, firstly, learning the locations of the stones, and to this end he's been quite successful thus far: four out of the six stones have revealed themselves.  Then, after he knows where all six stones are, he simply needs to head to their locations and grab them, before their guardians can respond."
AskScienceFiction,3e1xle,bhamv,16,Tue Jul 21 09:50:58 2015 UTC,"I think you are giving him way more credit. He has been trying to get each stone individually so far and has failed both times. All we can use is what we have seen on screen. He hired the Chitauri who are very bad soldiers. This army got their asses kicked by a group of 6 people. They also hired Loki which shows poor judgement because he let his personal vendetta cloud the ultimate goal. So already we know someone is after the Infinity Stones.               Then we see him hire Ronan in GOTG. Ronan gets the stone and tells Thanos to fuck off with zero repercussions. Thanos doesn't do shit, he just sits there and takes it. So not only does Thanos show poor judgement and poor planning, but he is all talk.         But according to you he allowed Ronan to fail so that he can get the stone later? When he could have just killed Roanan, taken the stone, and the Guardians and Nova corp would still assume Ronan had the gem and keep looking for him. Instead he allowed the stone to be taken away from him on the assumption he can get it later? That is a big assumption.               Also, I do not believe he had anything to do with the Aether. That was just whats his name wanting to bring darkness back into the universe. So Thanos is getting lucky that 3 stones are now in a known location. Based on what we have seen, Thanos is incredibly inept and weak."
AskScienceFiction,3e1xle,GoldandBlue,32,Tue Jul 21 10:46:22 2015 UTC,"He hired the Chitauri who are very bad soldiers. This army got their asses kicked by a group of 6 people. They also hired Loki which shows poor judgement because he let his personal vendetta cloud the ultimate goal.   He sent a jilted Asgardian prince after an Asgardian artifact.  To any observers (including the Asgardians themselves) it looked like Loki was retrieving the Tesseract for himself, to help achieve his goal of ruling over a world.    Look at the Tesseract incident from Thanos's perspective.  Loki is given the Scepter (which Thanos knows well and can keep track of), and sent after the Tesseract.  Once Loki arrives on Earth and makes moves towards the Tesseract, what's likely to happen next?  That's right, Asgardian intervention.    So either Loki manages to defeat Earth's mightiest heroes and take the Tesseract, in which case Thanos now knows exactly where it is, or the Asgardians send a certain hammer-happy big brother to defeat and retrieve Loki and the Tesseract, which then means Thanos once again knows exactly where the Tesseract is again.     Then we see him hire Ronan in GOTG. Ronan gets the stone and tells Thanos to fuck off with zero repercussions. Thanos doesn't do shit, he just sits there and takes it.   Yep, because once again, Thanos isn't interested in taking the Orb right there and then.  Let Ronan rant and rave if he wants, Thanos now knows that the Stone is in Ronan's hammer.  And after Ronan is defeated, Thanos now knows that the Power Stone is located in the Nova Corps' vault.    You ask why Thanos didn't just take out Ronan and take the stone for himself right then and there?  It's because of people like Heimdall.  Thanos wants to avoid any overt moves towards obtaining the stones, so that the remaining stones aren't moved or given greater protection.     Also, I do not believe he had anything to do with the Aether. That was just whats his name wanting to bring darkness back into the universe.     Indeed, this part was probably quite easy for Thanos.  He knew that the Convergence was a regular event, and that Malekith would probably try for the Aether again.  So all he had to do was wait for the Convergence to happen again, and watch Malekith track down the Aether for him."

AskScienceFiction,3e1xle,DirtyDav3,-7,Tue Jul 21 17:53:39 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like quoting everything you said so I will use bullet points for each.                       Thanos did not hire Loki, in fact they never even come into contact with each other. He hired the Chitauri who as we have seen are shit. So he got lukcy that this became an Asgardian problem but that raises other problems as well. For example, we do not know how powerful Thanos is, could he defeat Odin? Do you think Loki would have played along if he had succeeded? Loki is a huge wildcard in this and with an Infinity Stone could have just told Thanos to fuck off just like Ronan did. That is a lot of If's for a plan.                                      A lot of If's again. He assumed Ronan would fail and that the stone would end up in the Nova Corp vault? What if Ronan succeeded? He knew Star Lord was half whatever he is and be able to defeat Ronan with the help of his patchwork gang? What if Ronan gave him the stone? Does he say no? If he does take it, why not just kill Ronan and take the stone since nobody knows he is behind that plan anyways? Now he is making his plan more convoluted.                      Now we are assuming that Thanos knew Malekith would make a play, so he didn't even need to get involved here? Also, another situation where he assumed Loki and Thor would team up and that Thor's human friends would figure out a way to stop Malekith.                 So he created 3 plans that required a lot of chance and luck to succeed how he wanted them to because otherwise he would have to contend with 3 incredibly powerful people in possession of Infinity Stones.                 Now we are assuming that this guy who let Ronan disrespect him in front of his people is powerful enough to defeat Infinity Stone powered Ronan, Malekith, and Loki by himself. Men who would have the power to destroy worlds had they succeeded."
AskScienceFiction,3e1xle,GoldandBlue,22,Tue Jul 21 11:30:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're grasping the basic element of Thanos's plan here.  He doesn't want to take the Stones, not yet.  All he wants to do is know where they are.  He sent Loki after the Tesseract.  It didn't matter if Loki really did intend to deliver the Tesseract, or keep it for himself.  It didn't matter if Loki ended up in Asgardian custody and the Tesseract in Asgardian hands.  All that mattered was that the location of the Tesseract was revealed to Thanos, and that no one knew he knew where it was now.    Same thing with Ronan and the Orb.  It didn't matter if Ronan intended to betray Thanos (although Thanos probably guessed it would happen).  Now Thanos knows where the Orb is.  In fact, if Ronan had actually kept to their deal and tried to deliver the Orb, Thanos would probably have to find some way to decline it, or hide it elsewhere.    And Malekith's desire for universal oblivion is well-known enough to be written in books in Asgard.  It's pretty simple for Thanos to predict that Malekith would make another play for the Aether.    You say that there are lots of ""ifs"" in Thanos's plans.  And it's true, there are, but they don't matter.  It doesn't matter if Loki succeeds or fails, all that matters is that the Tesseract is now revealed.  It doesn't matter if Ronan keeps the Orb or not, all that matters is that the Orb's location is now known.    Look, think of this analogy.  Let's say you're on a beach, and you know that somewhere in the sand there are three pieces of treasure buried in the ground.  For argument's sake, let's say they're a piece of gold, a piece of silver, and a diamond.  You sit on a big beach towel and send off three dogs.  Small ones, like chihuahuas.  The first chihuahua has a good nose for gold, the second has a preference for silver, and you know the third dog favors diamonds.  You tell each chihuahua to sniff out their respective treasure, and then you know where each item is.  Sure, the dog might dig up the treasure and try to bury it elsewhere, but you're watching the dogs.  No matter what the chihuahuas do, you can still keep track of each piece of treasure.  And then, at the end of the day, when you're bored of watching chihuahuas run around a beach, you go retrieve each piece of treasure.  Sure, the chihuahuas might not be happy about you taking their treasure, but they're chihuahuas, what are they going to do?    As for whether Thanos is strong enough to defeat the likes of Ronan, Malekith, and Loki when they're powered up by Infinity Stones... it's hard to say in this continuity, but tradition states that yes, he probably could.  Odin and others in his power tier would be more trouble, though, so Thanos would need to out-think them."
AskScienceFiction,3e1xle,bhamv,4,Tue Jul 21 11:49:44 2015 UTC,"Thor could take on Malekith with the aether and won, loki couldnt do much with the tessaract, and all you had to do to take the stone from Ronan was break his hammer, which they did with a gun. Considering that these people lost while having the stone shows that Thanos, who probably is stronger then all the avengers and guardans and whatnow, could most likely take them"
AskScienceFiction,3e1xle,effa94,-2,Tue Jul 21 12:09:20 2015 UTC,"It didn't matter if Loki ended up in Asgardian custody and the Tesseract in Asgardian hands. All that mattered was that the location of the Tesseract was revealed to Thanos, and that no one knew he knew where it was now.             Except if Loki had won and decided to keep it and use the power for his self interest, how does that help Thanos? Can Thanos defeat and Infinity Stone powered Loki? How does knowing Loki has it help him?                                          if Ronan had actually kept to their deal and tried to deliver the Orb, Thanos would probably have to find some way to decline it, or hide it elsewhere.               What? Why? How does this help him? It just makes it harder for him. No one would know he has it, so why not just take it instead of risking an Infinity Stone powered Ronan? Just like Loki, he knows where the stone is but now it is harder for him to get it.                  With the exception of the Aether, which i still say Thanos has zero knowledge of Malekith's plan, the location of the other 2 stones are already known. That is why he sent Ronan and the Chitauri after them. So how does having super powered Ronan, Loki, and Malekith help him? If anything it makes it harder for him.                     Also, Thanos is not the only person who knows where the three stones are now. If anything his ""plans"" has drawn more attention to the stones.

AskScienceFiction,3e1xle,GoldandBlue,5,Tue Jul 21 12:08:02 2015 UTC,"Can Thanos defeat and Infinity Stone powered Loki?    Considering Thanos sent Loki off with an Infinity Stone, I'd say he's probably feeling pretty confident on this front.  Especially when you consider the fact that Loki has a pretty solid reputation for being a trickster.  Thanos doesn't care.  Infinity Stone or not, Loki does not register as a threat to Thanos.     No one would know he has it, so why not just take it instead of risking an Infinity Stone powered Ronan?     Heimdall would see it.  Ronan having the Power Stone would not be ideal for anyone in the galaxy (apart from maybe Ronan himself), but it is not a total disaster.  The Power Stone falling into the hands of Thanos, though, would be an ""oh shit"" event that would lead to an immediate reaction from the likes of Odin.  At the very least, Odin would try to move, hide, or protect the Infinity Stone he has access to (the Aether or the Tesseract, depending on when GotG takes place).     Also, Thanos is not the only person who knows where the three stones are now. If anything his ""plans"" has drawn more attention to the stones.     Yep, Thanos's plan has not been perfect.  Thor knows someone's after the Infinity Stones, which means Odin will know too.  Or, to be more precise, the ruler of Asgard will know.  In any case, Thanos now knows that he needs to get a move on, to track down the remaining two stones and then retrieve all six.    ""Fine... I'll do it myself..."""

If that is the case then Thanos' cover is already blown. The moment he met with Ronan in possession of the stone than it's over.                         Yep, Thanos's plan has not been perfect.

He has created an overly convoluted plan that could have been blown up in his face countless of times. But by sheer luck has succeeded (assuming what you say is his plan is correct). But in succeeding, he has created The Avengers and The Guardians who are now allies with the Nova Corps.                            To me this paints an incredibly inept person."

Loki speaking with the Other of the Chitauri.  Key quote:  ""You question us?  You question him?  He who put the scepter in your hand? Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated!""  Also, ""If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he cannot find you.""    This is clear evidence that Loki was dispatched directly by Thanos.     Wouldn't Heimdell see Thanos and Ronan conspiring?     Probably, yes.  Like I said, the plan's not perfect.  However, even if the Asgardians know Thanos is after the infinity stones (and they do, by the end of the events of AoU), there's little they can do to stop him from taking them, as long as he knows where they are.    Alternatively, I just remembered that there are places where Heimdall cannot see, such as the realm the Aether transported Jane to.  It's possible Thanos could use such a realm to hide his meetings with Ronan.     But in succeeding, he has created The Avengers and The Guardians who are now allies with the Nova Corps.    Mere insects.    It's worth noting that, in addition to his formidable power in combat, Thanos has a deserved reputation for being a master schemer.  It's quite likely that we don't know that full extent of his plan.  What appears to be an inept move may pay off two steps down the line.  For example, we would consider Thanos revealing that he's after the Infinity Stones to be a flaw in his plan.  What if that's exactly what he wants the Asgardians to know, so that they'll try to move, hide, or protect another Infinity Stone, thus revealing yet another one to him?"
AskScienceFiction,3e1xle,bhamv,-5,Tue Jul 21 12:50:36 2015 UTC,"So Thanos ' plan included relying on a wildcard like Loki. That just further illustrates how inept his plan was. Loki fails then the Asgardians have the stone. Loki succeeds than he has to deal with a Loki who has no qualms about using the stone against Thanos.    Probably, yes.

It's possible Thanos could use such a realm to hide his meetings with Ronan.   His plan is not perfect is a huge understatement. Also, if Heimdell could not see Ronan and Thanos meet then he would not see Thanos take the stone then and there. Again, it is further proof of how inept MCU Thanos is. He could be in a possesion of a stone right now and no one would know but he thinks it is better to risk losing it again?                          Mere insects.

This ain't the comicbook, this is MCU Thanos. This is a Thanos who is not a master tactician but an incredibly lucky person who could have created 3 enemies capable of destroying him, but instead created the ""insects"" that will lead to his eventual downfall.              From everything that we have seen on screen so far, Thanos is inept. he is a guy who sits on a throne while others make actual moves.

Most of the people in the Empire and the rebellion were kids when Anakin was all over the news every night. Hell most of those kids dressed as Anakin or Kenobi for Halloween, or what every the Republic's equivalent was. They joined the Navy so they could be like Anakin.

While, sure, I could believe one of them, it seems unlikely that the 'nids, Orks, Tau, and Terminators would all be immune to assimilation.

Even Tyranids at first, although Tyranids are just as adaptable as the Borg so I imagine they'd eventually find some way to resist assimilation, like maintaining a link to the Hive Mind that overpowers the link to the Borg Collective.  The Necrons might also be tricky since they're already machines, but then again the Borg assimilate technology just like they assimilate living beings, so maybe that wouldn't stop them.  The only things I can't see the Borg being able to assimilate at all are daemons, since their physical bodies are just a manifestation in normal space. If the Borg filled a daemon with implants it could just pop back to the warp to escape."

There's a lot of theories that suggest xenomorphs are not a naturally evolved organism but bio engineered by the Engineers or Space Jockeys species, it's uncertain for what purpose.  It's my personal theory that xenomorphs take on host characteristics to make sure the resulting creature is able to thrive in any ecosystem that it finds itself in. At the same time it retains a number of xenos characteristics like their typically hostile nature, acidic blood and exoskeleton.

According to to an interview with the writer of Aliens (I forget his name) on set discussions had basically settled on the idea that Xenomorphs breed with different species as a means of collecting advantageous genes which are retained through the birth of a Queen and expressed in the next generation. So for example the first Xenomorph produced from Newts father was very likely identical to the Xenomorph from Alien, while once it had transitioned to the Queen any Xenomorph produced from an embryo planted by a Facehugger from her eggs matured to be the more ferocious and aggressive Xenomorphs the Colonial Marine's faced when they arrived.

This brings up another question of mine: What was the Imperial PR spin on the destruction of Alderaan? I can understand the point of the demonstration was to showcase the might of the Empire by destroying a planet sympathetic to the Rebel cause, but would that not have encouraged more outrage and Rebel sympathy, especially since the planet was ostensibly pacifist? Granted, the Death Star was destroyed before the propaganda department could properly spin up, but would the message have been ""Yes, we did this. We have/are the biggest dicks in the galaxy now"" or would they have publicly denied it, but leaked through back channels that they were responsible, just to sow fear and confusion?  Given what I've seen from the Empire, I wouldn't put either one past them.   P.S.

Even Superman can't save everyone, and he'd probably respect peoples' wishes to be left alone to prioritize helping others. But if something happened that was important (in his judgement) that required him to break that law for the greater good?  Like a save-the-whole-earth kind of issue in No-Supes-istan? He'd do what he needed to and apologize afterwards.

AskScienceFiction,3e1jbm,Plintstorm,6,Tue Jul 21 06:45:34 2015 UTC,It depends. Since the Imperium is trillions strong there will of course be minor deviations (and some major) in the worship amongst the citizens.   For example on Fenris the population worship Leman Russ and his Sky Warriors who are said to take the strong and prepare to fight at the end of days (the Emperor is the Allfather but he is less significant). Included in this worship is that of Morkai and various other figures who signify death and whatnot.   The Tallarans have a small subsect that worship Commissar Ciaphus Cain as a prophet of the Emperor after a squad witnessed him kill a Greater Daemon with nothing but hard words and his chainsword. His spoken word has been recorded into a bible of sorts that they attempt to follow in the strictest confidence. This worship of sorts has migrated to other regiments that serve alongside the Tallarans after they hear of the greatness that is Ciaphus Cain.   Space Marines are generally worshipped on the barbarian worlds they recruit from as gods or angels.

There was one crossover story where Trickster remarked ""When super-villains want to scare each other, they tell Joker stories.""  The only other regular supervillain who seems most able to deal with him is Lex Luthor, because Luthor can usually direct Joker's attentions towards objectives they find mutually beneficial (and in the case of Joker, 'fun') for a not-insignificant period of time before they inevitably try to double cross each other. Namely team ups against both Batman and Superman or the entire JL.  Even then though, Luthor wouldn't say that he necessary respects Joker as a peer, but respects him in the same way one would regard a natural disaster or a great beast.  There was one JLA story where Joker laughs about how he arranged to have the corpses of some children him and Luthor indirectly killed be defiled, which prompts Luthor to punch him in disgust. Joker surprisingly lets the punch slide, and rather than rage at Luthor, finds Luthor's perceived sense of honor in that instance amusing.  Conversely, the Infinite Crisis ended with Joker disfiguring and murdering a Lex Luthor from a parallel Earth, while the main Luthor watched from a few feet away. Main Luthor plainly says that his parallel self did something stupid which he never would have done, which was to hatch a giant potentially universe-destroying scheme and forcibly put Joker on the sidelines, depriving him of his' fun'.   So as far as he's concerned, it's no surprise his parallel self was paying the price."

If he's so good at training pokemon, and he does it FOR A LIVING, how come I beat him as a 10 year old like 2 days after being made homeless by my sociopath mum?   Given that there are people who aren't even involved in the pokemon trade, just walking around towns with pokemon that could single handedly trash some gyms, you got to think that if they WANTED TO, they could be gym leaders, BETTER gym leaders than some of the ones around.   And don't get me started on the so called ""Elite 4"". Sorry, you're super elite, but 10 year olds waltz in with their 3 month pokemon collection, and beat all four of you, with no pokecentre breaks?

AskScienceFiction,3dztgx,LazyPalpatine,11,Tue Jul 21 15:28:04 2015 UTC,"You aren't wrong... from a gameplay perspective the gym leaders should be much harder. In the most recent games it seemed like no leader had more than 3 pokemon while I came at them with a full team. IMO you should just have to pick your favorite three to fight with (I think this is how the pvp battles work now). I think they really only exist to limit your pokemon levels and HMs for the current story arc you're doing rather than to benchmark your skill.  As far as the anime is concerned, it's implied on multiple occasions that gym leaders have a special team they use when battling the trainers so they can benchmark for a specific skill level. You might recall that Brock gave Ash a badge for displaying good trainer qualities rather than actually winning the match (he stopped the battle when the gym's sprinkler system activated over Onyx, giving Ash an unfair advantage).    A few seasons later, one of the gym leaders (cannot remember who) commented to Ash that he should come back later for a proper battle, implying that she had to go easy on him for the badge fight. In Pokemon: Origins, Brock is careful to affirm that Red didn't have any badges yet before selecting two pokeballs from his collection."
AskScienceFiction,3dztgx,safe_as_directed,4,Tue Jul 21 05:47:49 2015 UTC,"Everything is based on how many badges a trainer gets.

So your character is kind of an autistic savant in that you can catch and train any type of pokemon (assuming you have the correct amount of badges). You'll notice most trainers focus on one type or only a few types (or in some cases themes) while you, the protagonist, can build whatever team you get your grubby 12 year old cheeto stained hands on. Proof of this generally comes throughout with individuals praising how your pokemon love you and how you're a fantastic trainer."
AskScienceFiction,3dztgx,Oregano69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:17 2015 UTC,"The Geodude and Onix aren't his only Pokémon. You probably just faced him without any badges. Gym leaders decide which Pokémon to use based on a trainer's number of badges. If you'd came to Pewter City last, Brock would be much tougher than he was when you met him. If he was challenged by a champion from Johto, he'd probably go all out with his Lv 50+ team.  As for the Elite 4, you have to remember that Blue and Red were both prodigies. Blue was Professor Oak's grandson, and he knew everything there was to know about Pokémon. It was only natural that as soon as he actually got out there and started battling, he'd be amazing at it. And as for Red, that kid was like a battle machine. He never even spoke and his Pokémon just somehow knew what to do. I'd be more surprised if he didn't become the champion."

AskScienceFiction,3e26bb,goldenranger10,6,Tue Jul 21 11:26:32 2015 UTC,"THAT was Instrumentality. THAT is what you get when you combine the essence of both Adam and Lilith.  A thing that you have to keep in mind is that all intelligent life that we know of comes from one of two branches: Either you are a descendant of Adam, or you are a descendant of Lilith. The common denominator between the two is our AT-Fields, the means by which one sentient creature differentiates itself from another. For the Sons of Adam, those beings we call Angels, their physical expression IS their being. Their AT-Field forms a direct representation of how they ""view themselves"", in a manner of speaking. To the Sons of Lilith, Humanity, our physical forms are static, but it is through personal expression that our true forms are expressed. Our AT-Field comes from within.  Instrumentality is what happens when a Seed of Life from both ""parents"" are allowed to intermingle. It appears, at least to our simple minds, that whatever progenitor race created the Seeds did not intend for them to come together, and if such a situation occurred, Instrumentality was their way of ""fixing"" it.   Instrumentality called together all living things in its direct vicinity. Basically, LCL, that orange fluid people seem to turn into, is what everyone boils down to. All living things are LCL given form by an AT-Field. Instrumentality breaks down those AT-Fields, basically the means by which individuality is possible, and collects all of the LCL.  That crazy dreamlike sequence of flashing images and confusion was simply your individuality being blended with that of every other person. You were basically within a single consciousness made up of all Humans, with all of their thoughts, memories and personalities all perfectly blended.   The reason Instrumentality took the form of a woman, at least to our eyes, is because it was using Rei as a sort of ""template"".   And the reason you are alive again now is because the pilot of Eva-01, Shinji, was given a choice. He chose to let Humanity continue on if they also chose to. You are alive because, given the choice, you would choose to remain an individual."

AskScienceFiction,3e26bb,LibraryLass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:49:34 2015 UTC,"It goes back to the dichotomy between Adam and Lilith.  There is some progenitor race, an alien ""culture"" (in truth, we know virtually nothing about them other than the fact that they existed) that, at some point, sent out what we know of as Seeds. There were two types; those that bore the essence of Adam, and those that bore the essence of Lilith.   These Seeds acted as a means for intelligent, sentient life to come about by providing a means to ""project"" individuality (This is a rather simplistic way of putting it, but it should get the idea across). Somewhere, off in our galaxy, at least one planet was seeded by Adam, which gave rise to what we know of as Angels. Angels are an intelligent, sentient race whose AT-Fields are ""external"", which is to say that their physical forms are a direct representation of their perceived being. Here on Earth, we were seeded by Lilith. Humans are an intelligent, sentient race whose AT-Fields are ""internal"", which is to say that our mental and emotional expression is what constitutes our being.   These two types of Seeds, as far as we can tell, were not intended to be present in the same place at the same time. This is why the Seed came with a Spear of Longinus. The Spear is the only means we know of to ""kill"" a Seed. Somehow, the Spear is capable of piercing any AT-Field regardless of its strength.  Earth was a strange situation, because we had a Seed of Adam land here first, but it was superseded by a Seed of Lilith that crashed shortly afterwards. Normally one of the two Seeds would use its Spear to remove the other, but that didn't happen for some reason. Instead we had the Second Impact when Seele attempted to make Adam make contact with Lilith. The resulting explosion melted an ice cap, changed Earth's rotation and orbit slightly, and instantly killed over 2 billion people.   Instrumentality is what happens when the two Seeds are unable to remove the other by normal means. Basically, if there is no Spear of Longinus for them to use, and there is a reasonable chance that the planet's inhabitants may try to make use of both, they merge, dismantle the AT-Fields of everyone in their immediate vicinity, and absorb their LCL to be reused later. It is believed that to be capable of utilizing both Seeds would turn you into a God of immeasurable power, which is something that this progenitor race deemed dangerous or otherwise ""not okay"".   TL;DR = Instrumentality is a failsafe to stop an intelligent race from becoming God."
AskScienceFiction,3e26bb,teerre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:59 2015 UTC,"The short version is that SEELE were trying to cause Third Impact to happen in such a way that they would be reborn as a god-like being using the body of Evangelion Unit-01. Meanwhile Gendo Ikari was trying to engineer it in such a way that instead his soul would be reunited with his late wife's. Both of them were using Rei Ayanami (who is Lilith's soul in a clone of Mrs. Ikari's body) to accomplish that purpose, but she gave the decision to Gendo's son Shinji, and this is what he ended up going with.  You should actually know all this because you have existed as a singular consciousness with everyone who was still alive at that point (or who died recently enough that their soul didn't have time to degrade) but I suspect that you've blocked it from your memory for some reason."

No Spartan cares much for rank... as that is not essential to their mission and purpose.  Chief holds the rank he does because he needs to be placed somewhere in the official hierarchy and he was marked as a leader from early in training.  That being said, you would be hard pressed to find any non-Spartan of any rank who would ignore a Spartan's commands/advice out of hand.  When the heavily enhanced human, armored in what is effectively a walking tank, and capable of punching through concrete says ""here's what we're gonna do""... most people just shut up and listen.

There are also Command Master Chiefs, but those command large numbers of enlisted (250-ish for the Navy, I believe), which doesn't fit the Spartans. There's also the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy/of the Marine Corps, but that's an advisory position, which also don't fit a Spartan. There are also Warrant Officers, but my understanding is those are mostly technical positions, rather than combat-focused positions. That also doesn't fit."

To add to this, and contrast what /u/monkeysky said, egg laying creatures have a process known as parthenogenesis, that allows the female laying the egg to sort of become male and then fertilize it!

It's never explained HOW they did it, but they did.  The Undead are descendants of the Pygmy, and they alone have the power to collect souls from others, including the 4 Lords. And, with the 4 Lord Souls being necessary to relight the fire, the Undead are now the only ones who can do anything about it.   Whatever happened in the past isn't really important, because now the Undead are the only ones who can do anything with the fire. Either relight it, or put it out entirely (which despite the rather ambiguous options in the first game, is portrayed as just outright bad in the DLC and thereafter).   Dante, not being Undead, would have no way to interact with the Lord Souls (and there's nothing to indicate there are more than 4 in total) and thus couldn't hope to deal with the fire. There may, somewhere, somehow, be a way to claim a Lord Soul as the 4 Lords did originally, but there is nothing in the games to indicate HOW that was done."

So for starters he doesn't want to fix it, it's a sign of his knowledge and power as Sith Lord, further any fix he did do would be sooner or later infested and change by the Dark Side again.  While he was in office as Chancellor Palpatine he used a technic of the Dark Force ( I think called ""Mask"") to hide his dark aura from the Jedi and also to hide the changes the Dark Side did to him.  During the fight with Mace Windu once he saw Anakin approaching he purposefully let the Mask slip to aper to be harmed by the re-directed lighting to convince Anakin to act (why would he SUSTAIN the Lighting that was supposedly killing him if it was really hurting him?)  After that he used his real Dark Side face to gain sympathy in front of the Senate while declaring the creation of the Empire and after that there was no need to hide it."

The Colonists have eradicated all opposition posed to them from within the human organization known as the Syndicate. They now use the Syndicate's vast reach to prepare Earth for their return. The Syndicate's jackboot is pressed to the throats of every government, business, and children's lemonade stand. Although this New World Order is all but invisible to the common man and woman, it is nigh-omnipresent, eliminating all possibility of a human resistance.   What the Colonists did not know: The resistance will not be human.   Mulder and Scully are on the move. With the X-Files as their guide, they are revisiting their old haunts, finding those touched by the supernatural. Monsters, witches, mutants, demons, all of them will perish if Colonization goes unopposed. There's no room for the supernatural in the world to come.  Organizing these creatures might seem an impossible task, but Mulder and Scully have an ace in the form of their son, William. A bridge between the human and inhuman, the possible and impossible, William will bring the creatures of the night together to save the world. And with all the unpredictability of the X-Files, they might stand a chance against Earth's original inhabitants.   But despite this flicker of hope, there's a sense of unease among Mulder and Scully. With each new ally, they wonder if the world will be saved for humanity...or for something else. They wonder how much more humanity their son can lose before he becomes something other. They'll go down fighting together, agent and case file alike, but who or what will remain?"

Their physical the forms are basically the same. The Ainur have neither, but are complete entities unto themselves or ëalar. (Indeed, Gandalf's name means ""wand-elf"", because the men who first called him by that name assumed he was an elf of some kind.)  As to why the Istari were incarnated in forms that were more like men than like elves, the reason was to better restrict their ability to directly interfere. They were not meant to fight the Free Peoples' battles, but to advise them and assist them. Suffering from the weaknesses and afflictions of men was meant to keep them humble and in touch with the emotions of men."
AskScienceFiction,3e0w5p,LibraryLass,5,Tue Jul 21 03:10:32 2015 UTC,"Elves and Humans are genetically the same species, so their bodies are identical.  As to why the Ainur choose to take the form of Men and Elves, they had a cloudy image of what the Children of Eru Illuvatar would look like by the early visions via the Music of the Ainur.  Thus they largely modeled their physical forms after those visions, though they can choose to take alternate physical forms.  For instance, one of Melkor's forms was a gigantic floating mountain of shadow, fire and ice.    The Istari look more like men because they were there to aid the realms of men.  The Elves and Dwarves were already in decline, so it would be up to the race of man to finally defeat Sauron."

There's not chance that the blond haired young Charles would ever be mistaken for anything but a fine Aryan specimen; chances are he'd be rehomed to ""true"" German family. It's a bit of a wildcard from there, I'd imagine his new adoptive family would have a pretty heavy bearing on how he turns out. He might buy into the Nazi rhetoric and become a supervillain for the axis. He might see the error of their ways and use his mental abilities to influence the organization from the inside. Whatever happens, he wouldn't live the life of hardship Eric experienced.  Eric would have grown up in New York to wealthy parents. While he would live a far better life in this version of events it would still be hard. ""His"" father would still die as a young child, and ""his"" mother would still remarry Kurt Marko. Kurt would still be an asshole, driving his mother to death by alcoholism. Without the benefit of telepathy he wouldn't learn of Kurt's true intentions for marrying his mother or of his abusive nature until his stepfather tried it on him. Eric is a physically larger person than Charles, with a more volatile personality. Assuming Eric's powers manifest as early as Charles's did things go quite differently. It's quite possible that he would have killed Kurt, or at least instilled a healthy fear of him in his abusive stepfather. If he didn't kill him, he would have definitely stopped him from abusing Cain as well.  I think he and Cain would become closer after the abuse dies down. The more physical Eric would have more in common with his stepbrother than the bookish Charles. I think Cain wouldn't have been as much of a fuckup with the support of his stepbrother.   Eric's smart, but not as smart as Charles was at that age, especially not without Charles' telepathic advantage. He still does well in school, going through classes at the normal rate. With his stepbrother's help Cain becomes more of a normal person now that the abuse has stopped. Eric gets into an Ivy League school mostly on his own merits; Cain attends as well, trading the reputation of his father's and Eric's father's name, as well as his late stepmothers' fortune.  Charles graduated college as a teenager and was drafted into the army when he was a legal adult. Cain and Eric would be regular college age when the draft came up - as students, they would be exempt from conscription.   In the event that they didn't join up voluntarily they might have spent the rest of the Korean War as students and never have witnessed the atrocities Charles did during his service.  I'm really not sure where I'm going with this, I'm gonna go get some pizza and then maybe ramble on some more later"
AskScienceFiction,3e03ag,justsomeguy_youknow,4,Tue Jul 21 00:24:38 2015 UTC,"Many of Erik's beliefs come back to his experience in the Holocaust; he sees that mankind is on the road to doing to mutants what the Nazis did to the Jews.  If he hadn't experienced this, it's unlikely that he would hold that view.  I can't say for sure if Charles would believe what Erik believes if he'd been through the concentration camp experience that Erik went through, but I think we can safely say that Erik's hatred of mankind comes mostly from that experience."

Erik's telepathy initially manifests as the ability to learn how to evade capture in the ghettos in Poland; he steals the secrets of hunters of his people and leads hundreds to escape. He learns to subtly modify thoughts to create illusions and make Nazis delusional, and he gains a reputation as ""Mazikeen"", an invisible trickster from Jewish folklore.  But Mazikeen's actions only bring more attention, and a child can't long outsmart Nazis. He is captured, along with friends and family, although his powers aren't revealed. At Auschwitz, Erik has the horrific experience of telepathically experiencing hundreds of his people being murdered at once, and his powers explode in a wave of telepathic rage.   Every Nazi within five miles is driven to total insanity, while everyone else suffers horrible nightmares and PTSD for years. Eric, as Mazikeen, plagues the Nazis throughout the war. His favorite tactic is to force German soldiers to use chemical weapons on themselves. He also recruits others to join his team of Inglorious Mutants to hunt Nazis.  After the war, teenage Eric heads to nascent Israel and becomes Mossad's most powerful asset, for a time.    Charles, on the other hand, has a mostly privileged life as a boy. His powers over magnetism develop gradually, and his interest in understanding them leads him to study physics and engineering in school. But before he has complete control over his powers, subtle attraction of poisonous metals like mercury to his system renders him paralyzed. He compensates when necessary by walking on metal braces he moves with his mind.  Upon graduation, Charles is sought by the US government to develop advanced weapons, but Charles isn't interested in helping kill. He accepts an offer from ARPA on the condition that he not make bombs, but instead can direct ballistic missile defense research.  In the early 1960s, Charles successfully tests his SENTINEL (Superior Electromagnetic and Nuclear Tracking, Interception, and ELimination) System. SENTINEL creates defense shields which render inert all nuclear material which passes through them; the shields also block the effects of EMPs.  Charles believes he has completely ended the threat of nuclear war. He is wrong, though, because the USA does not want to share this technology."

I've always thought Yoda losing was related to why the darkside wins so often, that, in an effort to have no qualities of the sith, jedi will weaken their will to the point of quitting early. It's crucial that Luke never learned to be as stoic as a full jedi, giving in to just a bit of rage and pain and fear is what both allowed him to beat Vader and then invoke the empathy of his father.

AskScienceFiction,3dxco4,BeeCJohnson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:27:07 2015 UTC,The underlying question though is how palpatine manage to equal one of the greatest Jedi. It's not like he had sparring partners everywhere
AskScienceFiction,3dxco4,Sabu113,0,Tue Jul 21 06:06:39 2015 UTC,"In short, stronger the person is with the force, more skillful s/he is with lightsaber. With lots of training the skill gap can be narrowed, to some degree.  It may not be nice, but thats the reality. Some people are just naturally better, and no amount of training can change that. Thats just life in Star Wars universe."

AskScienceFiction,3dxco4,Lachdonin,5,Mon Jul 20 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think he definitely looks quite panicky when Yoda finally jumps up onto that last platform right in front of him. My reading of it (and I think it was intended to be this way also) is that he expected to overwhelm Yoda easily, but in fact they're almost perfectly balanced. Either could potentially win the fight, given time, but Palpatine has all the cards in his hand. He calls in the clones after Yoda falls (and why would he do that if he was still confident of winning? He didn't start with calling the clones), and Yoda knows he can at best barely beat Palapatine, so he has to get out before reinforcements show up."

AskScienceFiction,3dxco4,standish_,25,Mon Jul 20 21:48:03 2015 UTC,"In addition to the other answers explaining how Palpz was a lot more powerful, Yoda was also outclassed in another way. He had been training the Jedi in ways to beat the Sith of old - the ones the Jedi had fought hundreds/thousands of years before - but the Sith had evolved, partly due to the Rule of Two and partly because that's what they did. While they evolved, the Jedi stagnated. So Palpatine could do stuff, could use the Force, in ways that were simply beyond Yoda, because he had evolved and Yoda had guided the Jedi order down a path to obsoleteness."
AskScienceFiction,3dxco4,redthursdays,20,Mon Jul 20 11:11:21 2015 UTC,"He lost because Palpatine was the Sith Lord. He knew possibly every lightsaber form, knew every dark side secret, and was extremely powerful enough to elude the Jedi which he worked with day after day for years.   Also Sidious had one of the most powerful Force lighting of any force user, which kinda beat Yoda's force defense."

AskScienceFiction,3dxco4,TalkLikeYodadoI,6,Mon Jul 20 13:47:16 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it was a strategic rather than tactical retreat. Yoda knew he might or might not prevail against Sidious. If he failed, it would truly end the Jedi order. If he succeeded, it would not deliver him a huge advantage; it would appear that the Jedi had assassinated the Chancellor.  Therefore, the safest and best course for the long run (10s, 100s, 1000s of years) would be to ensure his own survival so that he could regroup and attempt to resurrect the Jedi order."
AskScienceFiction,3dxco4,evil_burrito,7,Mon Jul 20 17:47:07 2015 UTC,"Force users each have specific areas in which they're particularly talented. Anakin was gifted with machines, hence why he could repair anything, build his own droid, was a notably gifted pilot, etc.. Obi-Wan was particularly in time with animals, hence why he could deal with the creatures in the Coliseum, and keep control of that freaky bird lizard thing in episode III..  Yoda was adept at teaching, that was his gift, that's why he was such a legend. When he taught a lesson, it stuck, he could figure out how you learned and make his teachings click with you.  Palpatine's gift was occluding the force. He could muddy the waters, haze the battlefield, whatever you want to call it.. He could make the force nearly impossible to read for others. That's why he was never discovered by the Jedi as a child, that's why he could sit in the room with three or four members of the Council with them none the wiser, that's why he was able to defeat several Jedi in direct combat, that's why he could defeat Yoda.  Jedi rely on their mindfulness of the force to gain minor precognition, to have faster reflexes, to see threats coming. Palpatine short circuits that."
AskScienceFiction,3dxco4,Emperor_Cartagia,10,Mon Jul 20 18:20:04 2015 UTC,"Because the Sith evolved, thanks to the Rule of Two they had become more powerfull during thousand years. They changed.  The Jedi on the other hand we're still trained the same as thousand years ago. Yoda was powerfull, but he trained 900 years to fight the Sith from pre-Rule of Two. He just wasn't prepared to fight someone as Palpatine."
AskScienceFiction,3dxco4,Snakie113,11,Mon Jul 20 11:11:28 2015 UTC,"The rule of two ensured that only the strongest dark side users would survive.  And it ensured that the apprentice would always be stronger over the master given enough time.  After 2 thousand years of the rule of two, the dark side users were insanely powerful.  And pretty much the first technique taught to an apprentice was how to mask their force signature.  Palps was so fucking good at it, he was able to just live right next to the Jedi Palace for most of his life.  He could wreck any Jedi on a one on one fight to top that.  They did a poor job of showing it in the prequels."
AskScienceFiction,3dxco4,madagent,4,Mon Jul 20 13:27:04 2015 UTC,"Yoda himself says that the Jedi's ability to use the Force has decreased. Yoda also knew when it was fruitless to continue the battle. Had they continued it's possible Yoda could have won, but had he not then as far as he knows all hope is lost. He must live to train the next generation of Jedi, or at least live long enough to put that in motion. Yoda retreats because he realizes he has been beaten for a very long time. All of his fears about the Sith, the Dark Side and Anakin all just occurred."

In addition to being a very strong willed martial arts expert, he's a detective.  Some of Batman's notable feats that kind of personify what he stands for, that he did with no gadgets or money are as follows:  • He was buried alive, and broke out of his casket to freedom.  • He has on several occasions beat fear toxin.  • He had his back broken, and still fought to save the day, and I believe in the same comic he rounded up all of the escappees of Arkham, in a single night.  • Probably his greatest feat is his Batman of Zur-En-Arrh personality he created to combat mind control, or hypnosis that seeks to make him think he isn't Batman, where in this separate personality he is once again Batman.  Now of these feats, I don't know how they compare to Daredevil, as I'm not a super huge fan of him, but if he has anything like this, he's already pretty much Batman, since as I said in the beginning Batman is so much more than his cash and gadgets."

Unless Murdoch has that level of control over the trust fund his access may be less certain. Now, being able to pay all the bills and keep the lights on while focusing on your pick of clients.. and affording a wealth of toys and stuff.. will certainly make a better Daredevil. At that point it might be easier to help Hell's Kitchen through open investments- buy those tenements and put them under control of a 'good guy' landlord, hire those out-of-work people to clean up/improve their homes, with some enlightened policies in place and a slush fund left over to handle overhead costs for a while. Like the Kingpin, only less of the whole organized crime approach. Wayne level money aimed at improving a Daredevil-level neighborhood could go a really, really long way.

His power is in making the other hundred muggers think that they might be next.  This is really the same strategy employed by regular police forces. Sure, there probably isn't a cop around that corner, just waiting to tag you going 95 in a 40, but there might be, and that is deterrent enough to stop a lot of people from getting too far out of line.

AskScienceFiction,3dzrah,TheStradivarius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:22:37 2015 UTC,"Separate universes, yes. That has been established for some time now, although the recent End Times seems to indicate at least some sort of ""interdimensional"" connection.  The Skaven horde storming the temple cities of the Lizardmen use an advanced Slann device of some sorts which establishes contact to a strange Elven-like voice. Given the fact that the Slann actually have spaceflight capabilities, it's not too far-fetched to assume the Skaven accidentally contacted an Eldar craftworld with the help of Slann technology. (Anyway, it might just be not more than a slight head nod to the old idea of WHFB ""in"" WH40k.)  Furthermore, it is implied that the towering knight with gleaming armour and strange speech encountered by Araloth in the warp is Kaldor Draigo, Supreme Grand Master of the Grey Knights, who is trapped there fighting the demons on their own soil.  Maybe the universes are connected through the Warp somehow? It would make sense somewhat in the way that both universes seemed to share warp entities (gods and certain demons like Be'lakor for example) hitherto. The whole End Times/Age of Sigmar hassle implies that there exist multiple universes, that they can interact with each other, and maybe the WHFB-WH40k connection fits in there too.  They are separated universes but share the same multiverse."

It is my assumption that if he could hold out for a year he was fine.

Not only is Thanos as strong if not stronger, and probably more powerful in energy manipulation, but he's smarter, a skilled fighter, and a tactician. The Sentry is smart, but he's got average fighting ability at best, and only strong as long as he's focused. The Sentry is easily manipulated, and Thanos is a master manipulator.   Thanos and Galactus have had confrontations, but Thanos was attempting to outsmart or negotiate with Galactus. He's strong enough to trade blows a bit, but in outright strength Galactus is far above him.  I don't think we can say for sure how Galactus would compare to a Celestial. Celestials are mostly known through their works and seldom are encountered directly. Their power is difficult to ascertain.

Sentry is just a man who got some kind of super supersoldier serum and became super-superman. And i would guess a fed angry galactus could take out sentry. Anyone that can overpower his soul could possibly take him out, since that seems to be his only weakness. (he can rebuild his body, and says that its the soul that drives him) So, i would think someone like the wh40k emperor could take him out, just becuse empy could blast his soul apart, even tho he is much weaker then sentry.   And a angry sentry is still just a man with crazy matter maniupulation powers. Any large entites could take him. Fully powered odin perhaps, fully fed galactus maybe,  the abstracts, multiversal reality warpers etc. There is a lot of beings on the powerladder between sentry and the TOAA.

The most modern and prolific incarnations of Captain Marvel portray Billy and the Captain as being the same person.   When Billy turns into Captain Marvel, he's really only just transforming his body.  Back in the Golden Age when the character was first introduced, the Captain Marvel identity had his own separate consciousness and could be considered a true adult, but was influenced by Billy's personality and consiciousness which I think was sometimes articulated as a voice in the back of his mind. So whenever Billy summoned SHAZAM, he was basically 'calling' on Captain Marvel to switch places with him.  Jeff Smith did a Shazam miniseries several years ago that went back to that interpretation to the character, but it didn't stick."

This was one weakness, in that if it got damaged too badly, Vader would suffocate, or have his circulation stopped, or any number of other things. What's more, it restricted his mobility extremely, to levels lower than your average human, in some ways. You never saw the guy doing cool jedi flips or say, crouch, because his body physically could not do it. Vader was tough enough that he could stride through a battlefield without stopping for anything, but Anakin would have been much more dangerous.  Also, The Force is life, and losing half of his body to be replaced by dead metal was a huge hit to his force power. He was never able to use force lighting, for example, because it requires biological limbs to cast. Anakin was strong enough that even held back by his suit, he was still extremely powerful, but he would never be able to equal some of the things Luke does in the EU. He just didn't have the potential anymore, trapped in a metal shell."

AskScienceFiction,3dvnta,boisegang,7,Mon Jul 20 01:05:42 2015 UTC,"I have a theory about that: most of Vader's hatred and frustration that might be channelled into lightning was directed at himself. If he tried to project it as lightning, he'd only end up targeting himself."

The suit was hardened from the outside but Vader relied on it for his biological functions and Palpatine designed it or was responsible for it. He knew exactly what weaknesses the suit had. That was a failsafe against Vader ever turning on him (one of his only liabilities for losing his power). Maybe that was supposed to be obvious but after watching 1-6 multiple times over the years I didn't really consider how the simple act of defying the Emporer was a death sentence for Vader. THAT'S why Vader could never do anything but be an obedient dog. THAT'S the reason Vader truly needed Luke to ever have a chance to overpower him. (or in reality, catch him off guard). THAT'S why Vader being a badass meant nothing to the Emporer who enjoyed greater power than anyone else in the Galaxy. And THAT'S why it seemed like Vader took a lot less discharge but appeared to die so easily. The suit was done for, there was absolutely no time to save him. The parts we all know but it's still a bit ambiguous exact what happened, there was always that nagging feeling of how the hell did Vader go down so easily.   1) Relative Power between Vader and The Emporer after Mustafar.   2) The extent of Vader's reliance on the suit and Palpatine's involvement in knowing exactly where it's weaknesses lied.   Subtle but interesting."

The Legends continuity was inconsistent on this matter, sometimes he was awkward and slow, other times fast enough to keep up with other ridiculously fast Force users.

In Lords of the Sith, we get the clearest understanding of him inside his suit.   Without the neural connection to his armor, he was conscious of the stumps of his legs, the ruin of his arms, the perpetual pain in his flesh. He welcomed it. Pain fed his hate, and hate fed his strength. Once, as a Jedi, he had meditated to find peace. Now he meditated to sharpen the edges of his anger.  Vader stepped from the lift and used the Force to augment his speed, sprinting through the smoky, crowded corridors. He saw a Twi’lek repair crew ahead, four men and a woman. They navigated an antigrav tool-and-parts pallet through the corridor, and nothing about them looked suspicious. He didn’t care.

He was suffering third degree burns over most of his body, had lost most, if not all of each of his limbs, and his lungs were literally FRIED.  By the time Palpatine pulled him off  the Mustafar frying pan, he was little more than a force-preserved sack of HATE. The Dark Side is the only thing keeping him alive.   To allow Anakin to survive, Palpatine needed Life force. Life force he may or may not have drained from someone with a deep connection to Anakin. Someone who had his children VERY close to her. Who died without any visible or logical cause except ""A broken heart"".   Hmmmmmmm.....  Let's talk about Anakin's prosthetics for a minute.   Anakin has lost most of his skin, severely damaged most of his organs, While grafts and cloned organs could help him along, The dark Side has some side effects that make those technologies not so efficient (remember Good Old Palpatine's force-lighting induced scars? Man looks like a pug after a stroke). To deal with this (And the fact, while cloning organs is possible at a much faster rate than normal growth, that cloning still takes TIME. Time Anakin Did not have. The medical droids essentially slapped him full of mechanical parts and called it a day.   Vader's suit is a cobbled-together nightmare. The boots and shin-guards catch within anakin's leg prosthetics. The chest is tight, and anakin can't control his rate of respiration. The lungs are also poorly made, requiring medically treated air. His senses are probably mostly artificial, provided by his helmet.   There are two problems with repairing the shoddy work to Vader -   *1. Vader's body is a carefully managed system, maintained by droids and possibly Sith magic. To alter the arrangement is to invite failure. Also, it's likely that any more dexterous or efficient prosthetics might not withstand the damage Vader is prone to, or might interfere with his ability to use the force. As mentioned elsewhere in the thread, Vader can't use force-lighting without frying his own cybernetic arms.   *2. The emperor LIKES Vader as an ominous, Lumbering presence, vulnerable to ion cannon fire, unable to survive without his suit or environment bubble.

Life force he may or may not have drained from someone with a deep connection to Anakin. Someone who had his children VERY close to her. Who died without any visible or logical cause except ""A broken heart"".    My issue with this fanon is that nowhere else in the series do we see someone require ""life force"". Everything should operate on the same biological principles we currently have in the real world (modified of course, to support the force). I don't see any reason why Anakin would need some nondescript life force to survive, nor can I think of any reason why life force would be transferable or any mechanism through which that could be accomplished.  That being said, what I do see, from Palpatine's point of view, is a huge roadblock and future problem for his apprentice, in the form of his wife and unborn children. Anakin just betrayed everybody else he's ever known, and all the jedi teachings he had learned over the years, solely for Padme. That means, if push came to shove, he would just as quickly betray Palpatine to save her, should he decide that's necessary. That isn't even considering that Padme and their children would prove a major distraction to the young sith apprentice. To Palpatine, Padme is a critical weak spot in his plans for galactic dominance.  So what do you do if you're Palpatine in the above scenario? You use the force and kill her from afar, and you do it in such a way as would be passably consistent with what Anakin had already done. Make him think it's his fault and that will be the end of it. His self-hatred will consume him and empower him with the dark side. Without anything else to live for, this will also ensure he remains subservient to Palpatine."

You can read up on the specifics here.  A noteworthy line: ""The technology in the suit was already obsolete, having been used to rebuild and create General Grievous decades earlier. While Vader retained his knowledge of the Jedi arts, he began to feel uncertain about his place in the Force, and while he had taken his first steps toward awakening the power of the dark side, he felt uncertain about his ability to sustain that power. He knew that he was hampered by his injuries, and knew he never could achieve his full potential because of it.

AskScienceFiction,3dvnta,Imperium_Dragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:51:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like he would either be just as strong or weaker. here's my thoughts:  Vader had respiratory problems (obviously) and was essentially on life support, BUT his suit was mainly inorganic (he a cyborg) thus the only real limitation to his stamina would be an error in his machinery, so he could essentially constantly fight as long as the mechanisms didnt crap out on him or he wasn't overpowered like in return of the jedi. I say he could be ""just as strong"" because he is very powerful with the force. if most of his confrontations revolved around space or aerial combat and force pushing/choking (which, let's face it, it does) he would be just as good in those aspects without the suit because they don't require any real physical motion and thus he could perform them just as well. the problem i have with the ""stronger without the suit"" idea is that he is a human, and wouldn't be able to swing as fast, or hit as hard compared to him in the suit. i guess you could argue that he would be more flexible or agile without all that machinery weighing him down, but as he gets older, his maneuverability will become more of an issue.  so, as it stands, no.

Piloting a Gundam is an insanely taxing thing to have to do for any extended period, and many simply wear down over time until they are killed or seriously wounded.   Teens and young-adults are considered the best candidates for new pilots because they learn much faster than older people do, plus their muscle memory becomes much more apparent much faster. They have a much higher chance for an extended career, ensuring that we get the most bang for our buck. They are also much less likely to already have families that can get in the way.   They are either at their peak physical fitness, or are on track to be there soon. They learn fast, their reaction times are quicker, they tend to be more complacent and willing to follow orders, and their slightly more reckless nature makes them perfect for performing dangerous missions.

With SS3 however, there is a definite increase in hair length as you guys know. Also, the eyebrows disappear completely.  Judging from strands of hair disappearing during SS2 and eyebrows disappearing during SS3, which both come back after the transformation ends, I would say that SS transformations can not only change the length of existing hair, but also remove and add hair follicles (or at least make the hair fall out and deactivate the follicle, later reactivating it and making it grow very quickly). Therefore, if Nappa does have any of those left (and since he has eyebrows and a moustache, he might. I'm no expert on baldness though) a Super Saiyan transformation would allow him to grow hair imo."

AskScienceFiction,3dzs94,effa94,11,Mon Jul 20 21:20:16 2015 UTC,"Boy that's a lot.  The Emperor:  The Emperor was most likely one of, if not the most powerful physical being to ever exist. He faced off against the Void Dragon and both defeated and then imprisoned him with only the technology from the middle ages. (Note its likely that the Void Dragon was the most powerful of the C'tan).  The Primarchs:  As for the primarchs, it varies really. Lorgar for example was probably the weakest primarch when it came to physical strength (losing to pretty much every one of his brothers. To the point where Konrad had to save him from Corax). Yet he was still able to defeat an Avatar of Khaine, and later with his psychic powers fully capable of tearing the greater daemon out of his brother Fulgrim.   Sanguinius is renown for having held the combined forces of Chaos at bay long enough to close the eternity gate. Including killing several greater daemons and a Bloodthirster of Khorne. He even got Angron to back down during the siege which is an impressive feat. Possibly he was the greatest primarch in combat although all of them are very strong.   Its likely the only non-primarch, non-emperor to defeat horus in single combat was the greatest Custodes to ever exist.  We know from the confrontation between Leman and Magnus that Leman was fully capable of lifting and shattering his brothers body. Also from the confrontation between Konrad and the Lion they are capable of taking blows that would immediately kill even a space marine in their armor.   All and all: The Primarchs while they vary in physical strength are at least capable of killing an Avatar of Khaine and most likely most if not all greater daemons. Its unlikely that most non-titan units could compete with them on the battle field. In single combat its likely only the Emperor or another god tier being could compete.   As for powers it really depends on who you are taking about. The ones that are psykers could obviously use those powers, but also some had other abilities. Sanguinius had wings and could fly for example. Ferrus Manus had ""silver"" hands that could shape metal with ease as another. The Primarchs were a diverse bunch, but don't mistake any of them for being weak. Even during the Horus Heresy the only faction that was willing to go against a primarch in single combat aside from another primarch or the Emperor were the Custodes and there was a mismatch even there."

Through his study of Pym particles, Antman found that not only can he increase his size in the normal three space dimensions, he can also use those particle to grow along other dimensions that may exist in our universe. As it turns out, our universe is vast and exotic and such dimensions exist. The difference between our mundane exist and the existence of beings who represent aspects of the universe is, actually, somehow, a spatial dimension (or close enough).   Or something like that."

If not the what?    No, they are not gods, they are abstracts. Zeus, odin, thor and others are gods. They have followers, gain power by some special source (god-force, also called life-force)) can hear prayers and are generally worshipped and often lead by a skyfather.   The abstracts are parts of the universe, and are more powerful then gods. Eternity) is the physical ebodiment of time and reality. Infinity is the embodiment of time, Lady death is, duh, death, and Obilivion is all about non-existance. There is also, abstracts like Lord chaos and Master order, the in-betwener, who is  supposed to keep the balance between all the abstracts, the ""embodiment of opposites"", and ofcourse, Galactus, who is basicly his own deal.    Could he, let's assume , grow to whatever size Galactus is, could he be anywhere near as strong?    Using pym particles, he can also increse his strenght and durability, as well as his size (as he is much more durable as giant man then a 50 meter tall human would be. Tho, even tho galactus size changes as he wills it, if pym grew to the same size, he wouldnt be as strong as galactus. Galactus uses the power cosmic, and can use it to do almost anything. Pym on the other hand, is just a very large, strong and durable human. If galactus is fed, he can just make himself stronger then Pym. Or he can make Pym weaker. But, if galactus is very very starved, he is very small and weak, and by then most superstrong people can knock him on his ass.

You can only see the abstracts when you grow to that size, when you're powerful enough, or they let you. So no one could see Pym or anyone at that size anymore.

In those instance where Supes is actively looking for Bats chances are Bats is actively trying to be hidden from him as well. Then it is simply a matter of Bats using his knowledge of Supes' senses to his advantage. For instance he can see through lead, so lining his suit in lead would quickly make him appear as a hollow shape. Then as others have said, he could use certain frequencies to hide his noise."
AskScienceFiction,3dww5p,AcademicalSceptic,13,Mon Jul 20 18:37:35 2015 UTC,"Batman may well use Active Noise Control (taken to a comic book level). Basically a noise is transmitted which has sound waves with the same amplitude but with an inverted phase and this causes destructive interference and the noise is cancelled out.   So he could have small speakers on his suit which detect and transmit sound waves which cancel out his movement, heartbeat etc and be effectively completely silent.   A lead lining to his cape and if Superman scans the room he's just a lead cylinder or whatever Batman makes it look like, so long as he's subtle or hides well then he could maybe get away with it.   Smell might be an issue, It seems he smells at least as well as a dog, so Batman would need to mask his odour carefully.   So it's hard, but not impossible for him to hide from Superman."

(I'm pretty sure he did something like this in New52)  Smell: Superman is so used to Batman musk that he can't tell the difference anyway.  Taste: See smell.  Sound: Sound dampeners that are 100% effective. Supes can't hear somthing that doesn't make a sound.  He could also manipulate the fact that supes can't see through lead and I'm willing to bet there are similar properties involving kryptonite.

Sight: In one of the scans posted batman says ""gadget worked"". If that is in reference to the heartbeat comment then that would lead me to conclude that batman actually does use gadgets to mask his location at almost all times. Also at least for the last scan Batman shows up kind of behind superman. Think about they way you search for something. You can't instantly look everywhere at once. You have a certain field of vision. So does Superman. Also even if you're looking in the general direction of something you still have to be able to discern the object you're looking for from all the surrounding objects. Superman tends to in all the mediums(comics,tv,etc.) I've seen do wide area scans so totally possible he just misses the batman or mistakes batman for some background object that he isn't searching for.

It is larger, has superior power systems and actually has its own propulsion, but follows the same basic structure and defensive layout.   4 quadrants, each centered around a primary docking bay and supported by lance batteries and untold amounts of.turreted firepower. The central keep (more of a small moon) contains the primary power systems and habitations, along with dozens of heavy torpedo batteries which can support any of the quadrant defenses.   A normal Ramillies has the firepower of several Battleships and is used to offer heavy static support to pivotal fleet actions. They are a match for entire fleets in their own right, and are widely regarded as the heaviest space-borne assets the Imperium has (though limited by their lack of propulsion and the dangers of relocating them via-warp-jumps).   The Phalanx is superior in every way. Its increased size is noted by at least 6 docking spars, similarly configured to those of the Ramillies, along with defensive rails linking them with more supporting weapons. Alone, it is likely more than a match for any Space Marine chapter fleet, and more in par with the power of a Sector Fleet. Properly supported, not even a Craftworld could stop it."

Some of my more ancient documents do help however - one here known as ""The Rules of Engagement: Battlefleet Gothic"" does specify that a single Space Marine Battle barge is armed comparably to an Emperor Class ship from the Imperial Navy. one of these mounts a very heavy quantity of weapons - Port, Starboard, Prow and Dorsal weapons batteries counting large quantities of guns, as well as multiple launch bays. Another equivalent would be a Blackstone Fortress - these were used in the Gothic sector as large weapons platforms, although i have it on good word that an Accursed Heretic known as Abaddon may have somehow activated great warp-weapons on these, destroying entire planets.  I guess, initiate, that the best answer i can give is ""It's Classified"", but at a guess would be similar to a Fleet's worth of Emperor Class battleships."

Most of the great, compelling stories about Superman are exploring what it's like to be an all-powerful immortal living among mortals, even compared to fellow heroes. Superman is quite simply above other superheroes, both physically (or metaphysically, if you prefer) and from a philosophical/moral perspective. Superman is as close to an absolute paragon as we get.   Superman's position in the minds of everyone is quite different from Wonder Woman. She's a great hero, a founding member of the Justice League, and is on the front lines against Earth's greatest foes. Superman is the superhero, the one thought of, named, and respected before all others.

Raised on a farm in rural Kansas, despite Martha's best efforts to get her to behave more ""girly"" Clara has a tomboyish childhood, enjoying the same things Clark did.   Pete Ross, Clark's best childhood friend, is one one of a cadre of local who reject Clara for her tomboyishness out of that elementary school boy/girl us/them dichotomy.   As one of the few girls in Smallville, the tomboyish Clara Kent and the very girly Lana Lang become de facto friends. Martha approves, hoping it will rub off on her daughter. They eventually develop a real fast friendship, united against Pete Ross and the rest of his gang of boys.  As Clara's powers develop around Junior High, Martha and Jonathan put extra pressure on her to hide her abilities and ""fit in"". To Clara's displeasure and Martha's delight, this means putting aside her tomboyish ways and fitting in with the poodle skirt and ponytail crowd.  One winter morning Clara's telescopic vision manifests and she witnesses the school bus, still miles away, start losing control and head towards the edge on an icy bridge. Heeding her parents' advice about hiding her identity she throws on a pair of overalls and Jonathan's heavy coat, hat and scarf at super speed, and leaps and bounds towards the emperiled bus. She reaches it right before it goes over the edge, picks it up, and sets it down safely, leaping away before anyone can get a good look at her. The bus reaches her house half an hour later than usual, its passengers abuzz about their rescue by some sort of ""super boy"".  Thrilled by the adventure, Clara continues to aid the locals and develop her powers, all while perpetuating the legend of the ""super boy"". Martha and Jonathan catch wind and immediately know what's going on - while they respect what she's doing, they caution her to be careful about what she's doing.  Freshman year in high school, Clara and Lana make the cheerleading squad. Sophomore year Lana starts dating QB, school hearthrob, and former enemy Pete Ross. They are very deeply enamored with each other and are rarely seen outside of each others' company. Clara misses her best friend.  Junior year, Clara and Lana make plans to apply to Shuster University to study journalism. Both of them have aspirations to become reporters - Clara likes to investigate the facts; Lana is enamored with becoming a TV reporter.   Mid-year, fellow Smallvile High student and local genius Lex Luthor, obsessed with the ""super boy"" phenomenon becomes convinced he has figured out the secret identity of ""super boy"": Pete Ross! Lex kidnaps Pete to experiment on. He is missing for just over a week; it takes the investigative team of Kent & Lang a mere two days to figure out what happened. Concerned for her boyfriend Lana calls the police. Clara has other plans, and goes back to her house for a disguise.  Clara arrives at the place where Pete is being held, only to find it already surrounded by police cars. An increasingly agitated and desperate Lex threatens to turn one of his instruments, powered by a rare radioactive isotope, against the police if they don't leave him alone. She leaps into action, past the surprised and bewildered police and through the wall of the reinforced grain silo. Lex turns the instrument on the ""super boy"" and prepares to fire! To both of their surprise a beam of energy bursts from her eyes, and Lex's machine explodes in a green flash, spreading radioactive material everywhere!  Clara howls in a pain like she's never felt before and crumples to her knees. Pete, freed by the explosion, knows enough about radiation that he knows that sticking around isn't good. A good guy at heart, he drags both the ""super boy"", whom he now knows is a girl, as well as Lex, his kidnapper, out of the burning building.  Now far enough away from the radiation, Clara suddenly finds her strength coming back to her. She tries to leap away - Pete holds on but drops Lex, leaving him for the police. Still nauseous from the radiation she barely makes it a mile away, passing out midair and crash landing in a wheat field.   Clara wakes up at home in her own bed in her pajamas. She overhears Pete talking with the police downstairs, telling them an absurd cover story about how the Super Boy left him in a field, where Clara found him and carried her back to her house before collapsing in exhaustion.  Lana, angry with Clara because she thought that she had ditched her when she needed her the most, begins to drift further away from her over the course of the school year. Pete, upon the discovery of Clara's secret, grows more and more obsessed with her and thinks he's falling in love with her. By the end of the school term the two have broken up.  Clara eventually warms to Pete's advances. The two of them begin dating that summer, cementing the end of Clara and Lana's friendship. Clara is actually happy with Pete, and is happy that she actually has someone outside of her family to share her secret with.  Senior year Lana has quit the cheerleading squad, unable to bear working with Clara or cheering for her ex boyfriend. She buckles down with her studies to pursue her journalism dream. Both she and Clara enter the same journalism contest competing for a full scholarship. Pete finds himself becoming more clumsy and accident prone. He hides it from Clara, and worries that the athletic scholarship he's been offered will be withdrawn.  Midway through the school year Lex returns having had the charges dropped against him, both through the influence of his wealthy family and the fact that is deathly ill. Lex has been going through chemotherapy: He is bald, sickly looking, and quite a bit more frail looking than before. Pete learns that he developed cancer from the explosion the year before, and goes to get himself checked out.  X-rays reveal a series of malignant tumors. Pete opts for treatment it proves ineffective. He withers away and dies in a matter of months. Most of the school attends his funeral; Lana and Clara are both in attendance. They don't talk.  Graduation comes and goes; Lana makes Salutatorian, to almost everyone's pleasant surprise. The results of the contest come in: Lana takes first place, with the prize of very large scholarship to Shuster. Clara comes in second, taking home a lesser, but still sizable one to Metropolis University.  Clara decides to go to Lana's house to congratulate her and try to bury the hatchet, only to find that Lana had already left town for Shuster U. She begins to pack her stuff later that week, preparing for life in the big city..."

They had been trying for years to find a publisher for this man who could fly, off of whose chest bullets bounced harmlessly. He could leap buildings in a single bound! But something... something wasn't right.  Look, in the sky! It's a bird, it's a plane...   Jerry thought about his sisters Minerva and Roslyn, who were several years older, born in the home country, who had always been so strong. He thought about his sister Isabel, who, despite being barely older than himself taught him everything he knew. Joe thought about his sister Jean, and about how separate and mysterious the world she inhabited was. Jean was strong and soft, straight-backed and clear-eyed, confident in a way he could never be. It was almost an alien world.  They talked about Amelia Earhart, who could fly better than anyone on Earth until she disappeared.   Joe picked up his pencil and drew a new figure. Jerry nodded.  *  She was born in the midst of a dying planet, the last daughter of Krypton. Her father, Jor-El, held her tight in his arms as he ferried her to the escape rocket. There was no other option. There was no other hope. This rocket would carry the last best hope of Krypton: a single girl child. He could not know what her future held, but he knew it was not here. She was born under the red sun of Krypton, but she could not stay.  He brushed back a curl of hair and gently kissed her forehead. He could not know for sure, but yet he was certain. This child was destined for great things.   As the world burned around him, he didn't take his eyes off the streak of light headed for the stars. He watched it as long as he could.

AskScienceFiction,3dxyhe,vmos,8,Mon Jul 20 13:21:29 2015 UTC,"From the evidence, all of human culture, and its progress in most fields, stopped stone cold to make time for space travel.   Considering the amount of mining ships, it was probably because we finally hit a resource crisis - one day, we're living it up in the early 21st century or somewhen around then. The next, economies crash, first world becomes third world, riots in the streets, etc.  The governments of the world focus all the resources remaining to go into space and kill this scarcity once and for all. It works, to a degree. Humans are probably settling back down into a stable economy for the first time since the depression when we see Rimmer and Lister growing up. Some areas still have it far better than others. (Lister: ""This is just like where I grew up, except there's less burning cars."")  This explains why all other technology stopped dead, and, more importantly, why the ""future"" has ""modern"" values and rarely references its own popular culture, instead making jokes on 20th and early 21st century culture - they're only just making their own entertainment again, for the first time since then. For the whole depression everyone just hung on to old VHS tapes of the classics and rewatched those, since the government wouldn't let any money go to the entertainment industry.  This is strongly backed up in Back to Earth, when Lister talks about humanity only just having invented DVDs shortly before ""all the banks collapsed and money became worthless"". (Then going on to explain that they went back to VHS anyway, jokingly ""because they're too big to lose"" down sofa cushions, but more probably because with the economy wrecked, the newest, not yet fully adopted technologies were forgotten about in favour of reliable constants.)"
AskScienceFiction,3dxyhe,Mik0ri,3,Mon Jul 20 14:48:27 2015 UTC,"This, and there are a couple of other hints of how crappy the future is:   It seems that the dominant form of entertainment in Red Dwarf is virtual reality. It seems that while media compression may have not been a priority to convert from VHS to DVD, virtual reality was a common way for people to entertain themselves. This is probably because the world became so bad, and resources so scarce, that it was the cheapest way for people to travel and escape their surroundings. In the same episode that Lister first finds the VR machine, there was a news reports about the VR machine's popularity. The reporter says that lineups got so large and out of hand, that people would que up for miles. When the consumers eventually rioted, the police had to resort to nuclear bombs as a form of crowd control.   So this is clearly a future so crappy that people were willing to wait in mile-long lineups, and risk the chance of being nuked, just so they can get their hands on the one thing that could give them a little escapism."

When the Elves first saw Orome, they mistook him for a wrathful god, but he straightened that out the moment he could. They respected the Valar and acknowledged their power and authority, but that's not really the same thing. They weren't seen as gods to be worshiped, more like a big brother that Father has put in charge while he's away. This is especially true of the Elves, who lived and spoke with them directly for many years before everything went to hell. While the free peoples would pray to them and ask for their assistance, the Valar were not worshiped and had no desire to be.  None of this is true for the Dwarves, since they came about under entirely different circumstances. They were actually created by one of the Valar, Aule, and are his children. While the religious beliefs and rites of the Dwarves are not shared with outsiders, they do worship and revere Aule as their father.

As he convinces them to worship the Valar, who they have actually interacted with after all and whom they rightly respect/fear the power of, he also leads them to worship of the ""mightiest"" of the Valar:  Morgoth.    It can be read as a condemnation of people who only 'worship' those things that can be confirmed.  Sauron used the reality and proximity of the Valar to lead men into rejecting Eru (who remained aloof from his creation most of the time) and turning toward their own worst enemy."

I dont think they ever directly worshiped them, they just followed their orders. The orcs have no need for religion. tho its possible that the goblins of moria worshipped the balrog, but that was probably since they didnt know what is was.

AskScienceFiction,3dx6td,effa94,3,Mon Jul 20 08:17:59 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that the gradual changes are really more about the probability of those things happening. So take the slow disappearance of Marty's family for example. The school dance kiss was a key moment in his parents' relationship, and without it there seems to be zero chance of them having a family together. But our indication of this all comes from the period of time before that moment. In other words, the family picture was fading away because Marty's presence had decreased the likelihood of that kiss. The slow vanishing didn't mean it was fated to never happen- just that it was less likely. AFTER the kiss (or presumably the lack thereof), the future is suddenly decided. It is very much an instantaneous thing. If Marty caused Doc to perform some particularly dangerous interactions which might kill him, then we would see the car slowly vanish until the outcome was determined. But AFTER the danger had passed, the future would be certain. The car would either be there or not.  My point is this: it seems to me that this answer doesn't quite work. In the moment something has zero percent chance of happening (like Marty's parents having a family, or Doc inventing the time machine) then that thing will cease to exist permanently. The fading thing happens when probability is getting low, but is still above zero. The car would start to vanish (or maybe turn into a regular DeLorean?) if Doc were in some situation in which his life/intellect were in jeopardy. If he died, it would be gone instantly however.  That's my interpretation of the ""vanishing phenomenon"" anyways.  The real paradox then is what happens to Marty..."

One of the first places conquered by the Yuuzhan Vong was Dubrillion and Destrillion out near Dantooine. These planets were the core of a large mining operation overseen by Lando Calrissian. Dubrillion was the base of operations, Destrillion was for processing, and I can't remember for sure, but I believe both were being actively mined and were being exported to ship yards (I want to say Kuat, but that could just be because of its importance later on in the war effort).  The interesting thing here is that Lando also had control over a sizable asteroid belt (referred to as ""Lando's Folly"").

Now, with all that planet hopping, terraforming, enslaving, and destruction, they are bound to make enemies, and those enemies can spread word quick. eventually, they'll form an alliance with planets that have been hit, or are next on the list. essentially, each side has a half a galaxy worth of material. fuel, metal, technology, and both those halves are looking to stop the other.

IIRC one Senzu bean can keep you full for a week or so, and Korin only eats Senzu beans, so at the very most it takes about a week to grow a single bean.

Normally, a Padawan is then selected by a Jedi Knight, and they gain experience following him on missions. This was probably where the main difference was felt, as their missions went from ""Sort out this civil war on this agricultural planet"" to ""Command this fleet and reclaim this heavily defended planet from the Confederacy"". The kind of things Jedi Knights did changed, so the kind of things Jedi Padawans learned did as well.

AskScienceFiction,3dvqfe,TheStradivarius,2,Mon Jul 20 11:01:57 2015 UTC,"Jedi martial arts (like many real world martial arts) are as much a meditation method as simply combat training.  Every Jedi trains significantly in saber combat because it exercises mind, body and force aptitude all at once. During their training they end up specializing in various saber styles up to a point, many of them opting to train in styles that maximize their defenses against blasters.  After their basic training it's really up to individual preferences and talents how much effort they put into their training. Mace Windu for instance was an extremely martial Jedi who became a very strong combatant and skirted the very edges of the dark side in terms of aggression.  Others like Plo koon, Obi Wan and Kit Fisto were above average combatants without having a particularly martial mindset. Quite the opposite really, these were exceptionally well balanced and calm Jedi. They trained strongly in the force with great focus and for them saber training was simply part of that. But the end result was the same, strong fighters."

Its a non-Einsteinian universe where, as far as i know, photons carry kinetic energy, and there seems to be an abundance of red light. Tho, if it is light, then they seems to move much slower then regular light, as it seems people have avoided them. But its possible that these people are just avoiding his eyes, moving faster then he can move his eyes. But the end result is he shoots a red beam that hits with a shitload of kineitc energy, and cant run out of it. Why his eyes are portal to this place in the first place, well, he was supposed to be able to controll it much better, but he had a accident (he fell out of plane) and got brain damage, so now he has constant portals in his eyes that he cant turn of. His brother, havoc, have a similar power, and have much better control, but i dont know how his powers work exactly.  The meat dimension is nothing more then a joke as far as i know, a play on the punch dimension. People ask where the red punches come from, it comes from the punch dimension. People ask where all biomass comes from, when people like hulk and wolverine and deadpool grows and heals, and it comes from the meat dimension. I dont know if this is a thing in canon, or if its just a reddit joke.   Then there is ofcourse all the shitloads of other dimension and realms and planes of reality, like the microverses which are smaller then subatomic particles, or the dimension where Cyttorak are, or where asgard is, or the negative realm, or etc etc etc. And this is not getting into all the alternative universes."

It could explain how he lived when the world was farly alive, with the city and the other places where all the farmers and whatnot lived, it seems such a contrast to the constant wilderness that seems to exist everywhere. He has lived for several cycles, they say that he seems to be several hundreds of years old if you look into his eyes, so its possible that the bad guys have had several hundred of years of breaking the beams. Maybe all the beams where whole when he begun his quest, and there was more civilization, they break one beam every cycle or so, which fucks up the landscape and such. When he begun, Gilead had just bean taken over, there where farmers and civilization here and there. In his latest journey it seems unlikely that people live in a postapolayptic style everywhere he goes, but that he still visited blooming farmlands with a shitload of cattle when he was younger. I would be suprised if the world went so bad so fast.   So my guess was that the tower is in danger, since the beams holding it up dont reset, and the land fucked up by the beams breaking dont reset either.

Gilead was located in In-World and was the capital city of Roland's world (and the Old Ones' also), as such, it probably had machines by the Old Ones that staved off corruption hidden around somewhere, all of the Beams were still intact too.

With the current deteriorating relationship between Earth and the Colonial Union, the CU may put more resources into AI development again. But really, nothing beats a brain. No AI can possibly match a human brain, especially someone who has had a lifetime of experience and is augmented with the latest tech.

The advantage of scale is also impossible to ignore.   Get robots that mine materials, get robots that refine materials, get robots that build factories for other robots. Just point them at a mineral dense planet one day and the next day you could have a self sustaining million-strong army that doesn't need to be paid, doesn't want a pension, won't run from battle, doesn't need to be trained, and doesn't need to be convinced to fight.

Then second question, if the perpetuals can survive that kind of stuff how do they do it? Ignoring the physical, how do they come back into the same body if their brains have been destroyed or otherwise altered? So i made the educated guess that the Perpetual soul doesnt reside in the mind but rather the main body.   I based the exterminatus off the new Inquisitor Codex where it details a specific group of them who basically love to declare exterminatus on everything (one of them has 31 confirmed genocides) slightly suspicious (iirc one tried to declare the Space Wolves heretics and got his ass rammed into the planet and out the other side).   So basically when it comes down to it, with answers like this i try to base it on the available information and then make educated guesses to fill in the gaps."

AskScienceFiction,3dtjyu,KodiakAnorak,37,Sun Jul 19 09:01:38 2015 UTC,"It does seem that Dark Eldar can go backwards. It's tough, but it's doable. There are two characters in the Path books who are sorta in the attempt. I won't spoil who, in case people want to read it.   Certain Chaos worshipers are also able to 'snap out of it'. This is difficult with mutations, as the corruption seeps into your very biology, bit there is a group called the Illuminati (literally Enlightened Ones, not some shadow organization) who are basically all former Daemonhosts who shook off possiession on their own. So it's doable, bit very rare.  The God issue stems mostly from magnitude. There are Warp entities based around other, non-human thoughts and emotions, but they are minute compared to anything else in the Warp. Because humans are dominant, and the Chaos Gods are empowered mostly by human thought and emotion, any emotion that coincides gets absorbed by them, rather than going to a 'racial' god. Tau can feel Rage, for instance, so that feeds Khorne. The Hruud, on the other hand, can feel splelknar (it's sort of like feeling glorp, but more froody) but that emotion is not part of the 4 Chaos Gods, so it gatheres in its own little, minor pool. Chaos Furies tend to draw from most of these esoteric emotions, and are extremely weak because they have such a small pool of power to draw from."
AskScienceFiction,3dtjyu,Lachdonin,13,Sun Jul 19 09:17:35 2015 UTC,"Gork and Mork are non-trivial warp entities - in fact, there's substantial evidence that they constitute the largest warp presence.  Since Orks are the only species known to actually generate warp energies, their gods are disinterested in worship or conversion of other creatures.  It's well-known that Khorne is capable of recruiting young, impressionable yoofs, who enjoy his embodiment of mayhem like Gork, but appreciate his higher emphasis on militarism."
AskScienceFiction,3dtjyu,FlashbackJon,9,Sun Jul 19 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"Or in more direct terms, Gork or Mork can single handedly take on Khorne in hand to hand combat and break even at worst and dominate at best.   To put it another way, Daemon Worlds or Warp Worlds are worlds brought into the warp dedicated solely to raising power through worship for their Gods. Every single world, ship, hulk or asteroid that the orks land on is a Daemon world dedicated to Gork and Mork. Through sheer number and exuberance the orks dominate the puny human chaos worshippers."
AskScienceFiction,3dtjyu,Algebrace,2,Sun Jul 19 17:48:31 2015 UTC,"There's been ample discussion about Gork and Mork over the years, and I am ofthe mind that they aren't Warp entities proper, but rather manifestations within the ccollective Ork paychic net. They draw from and are formed from the collective psychic power of the Orkoid species, but are not actually IN the Warp."
AskScienceFiction,3dtjyu,Lachdonin,2,Mon Jul 20 02:25:46 2015 UTC,"All sources seem to indicate that they are actually warp gods, in that they have history and conflict with the Chaos and Eldar gods.  Part of that is Orkish folklore (Orklore?) admittedly, so it is naturally suspect, but there are Imperial sources as well.  Not to mention that the Orks were bioengineered (as the Krork) to combat an enemy that was fundamentally incapable of accessing the warp at all.   Orks and the Ork Way are strong and powerful forces in the universe. Orks are a highly successful race; they seem to be able to survive, expand, and prosper almost effortlessly in comparison to struggling humanity. The Ork character, which is strong and virtually invulnerable, has its reflection in the warp in the form of the mighty, belligerent, and boisterous Ork gods. Known Ork gods include two legendary heroic deifies commonly called Gork and Mork.   -WAAARGH! THE ORKZ"
AskScienceFiction,3dtjyu,FlashbackJon,2,Mon Jul 20 03:40:55 2015 UTC,"My main issue stems from their lack of identification or association as a distinct Warp Entity or presence by any other body. The Eldar, Humans, Nissicar and other psychic races recognise the Chaos Gods, the Warp presences of each other, and even the Shadow in the Warp, but none recognise or acknowledge Gork and Mork, even when facing off against Orks.   I don't think we can go so far as to claim they are just figments of Orky imagination, but they don't seem to have the same kind of presence as other, known Warp entities, not even lesser Daemons."
AskScienceFiction,3dtjyu,Lachdonin,3,Mon Jul 20 04:21:53 2015 UTC,"Because humans are dominant, and the Chaos Gods are empowered mostly by human thought and emotion, any emotion that coincides gets absorbed by them, rather than going to a 'racial' god.    Strange, as my research indicates that the Hrud are many, though they stick to the shadows unless they're in a mass migration. Perhaps they have little Warp presence in general?"
AskScienceFiction,3dtjyu,Algebrace,8,Sun Jul 19 15:48:16 2015 UTC,"C'tan are completely divorced from the Warp as are the Necrons, indeed it would be in their best interests if all life was destroyed so the warp would calm down. Keep in mind the worst enemies of the Necrons were the Old Ones who had complete mastery of the Warp when they were still around. The C'tan and the Necrons have also bound their souls into Necrodermis (the name might be wrong) so their souls cannot complete the cycle that other mortal races do (Eldar go to Slaneesh).  Also it must be noted that there are degrees of worship. For example worshipping chaos isnt the same as being a chaos champion for example. Like young rich kids everywhere many dabble in ""chaos"" worship and do very basic rituals which can be stopped however they will have formed an often unbreakable bond with Chaos (just a little weaker). On the other extreme we have Daemon Primachs/Daemon Princes (Greater Daemons are manifestations of their Gods power so dont count) that are unredeemable since they are no longer mortal and their entire beings have been changed (like changing apple to orange)."
AskScienceFiction,3dtjyu,Algebrace,3,Sun Jul 19 13:09:33 2015 UTC,"C'tan are completely divorced from the Warp as are the Necrons   Ah, but the Warp feeds off human emotions and thought, right? So if humans began worshipping the C'tan, wouldn't that be reflected in the Warp somehow? The star-devourers themselves cannot access the Warp, but perhaps the Warp would spawn a new deity to reflect their worship?"
AskScienceFiction,3dtjyu,thomar,3,Sun Jul 19 15:40:14 2015 UTC,"The warp feeds on emotion as a whole or rather it is a reflection of a race's emotional pool (think sedimentary rock) over a prolonged period of time. This is why the Tau have such minimal presence and the Eldar (excluding their enchanced abilities) shine so brightly, time makes all the difference. To make a God you must pool emotions/thoughts together for a singular purpose and the resulting creation is simply a reflection of that emotion i.e. Slaneesh is basically pleasure born from the wanton pursuit of pleasure  by the ancient Eldar. Gork and Mork are simply reflections of Ork mentality i.e. brutal but cunning and cunning but brutal.   So in worshipping the C'tan there would emerge over several millenia (if not hundreds of thousands of years) emerge something that represents what people believe the C'tan to be. Its kind of like how we worship celebrities, they are very different from what we believe them to be and comparing the two (assuming physical forms) they are like complete opposites. So while something that vaguely resembles a C'tan might emerge... it isnt one."

We've seen Quicksilver already redirect bullets once, so he could have saved her there. Or he could have even possibly knocked out Magneto at Xavier's request.  Or if he was with them at the White House during the Sentinel demonstration, he could have aided in the fight there against the Sentinels, though Magneto would more than likely stop him."
AskScienceFiction,3dvgd6,League-TMS,3,Sun Jul 19 22:10:29 2015 UTC,Magneto didn't just shoot her though; he was manipulating the bullet as it flew so Quicksilver would have to be strong enough to push against Magneto's power.  He isn't.

AskScienceFiction,3dvgd6,League-TMS,2,Mon Jul 20 07:05:26 2015 UTC,"Even in bullet time, Magneto still has magnetic fields guiding the bullet.  Quicksilver isn't strong enough to rip or push the bullet free of those fields."
AskScienceFiction,3dvgd6,calgil,3,Mon Jul 20 12:12:16 2015 UTC,"I would posit that he absolutely can. To Quicksilver, acceleration massively slows down and the mass of the bullet stays the same so to him its force is massively decreased. This is why he can push bullets out of the way in the first place; if the force wasn't massively reduced, the bullets would smash his fingers away even when he touched them in slow motion. Magneto can manipulate bullets using electromagnetic forces but he's not increasing their force or acceleration (they're already explosively forceful and incredibly fast, what's the point?) Bullets don't rigidly 'stick' in the air because Magneto is 'holding' them (unless he is deliberately holding it in place in which case maybe but maybe not), he is just guiding their trajectory using his control. Besides that, Magneto's reactions are simply just not fast enough for Quicksilver. Quicksilver is less than a blur, he's so fast that he's invisible and his light-force touches are translated to tremendous force in real time.  As /u/sophophilic says, Magneto's powers and ability are constrained by real - time physical laws and become correspondingly weaker outside of that. An electromagnetic force, where acceleration is zero, is still zero force. Magneto can't change that. If Colossus were punching a wall super hard, in bullettime Quicksilver could move that hand away as long as he could lift the weight of his hand because the force of Colossus' punch is now close to zero. Nothing that Quicksilver does makes sense unless we accept this."
AskScienceFiction,3dvgd6,League-TMS,2,Mon Jul 20 17:09:18 2015 UTC,"But Magneto IS accelerating the bullets in this specific case.  He is causing them to change direction, therefore he is changing their velocity and it therefore accelerating them.  He is applying a force to them."
AskScienceFiction,3dvgd6,calgil,2,Mon Jul 20 17:18:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's true. But he's only applying 'enough' force which, when slowed down, seems negligible to Quicksilver. If it were any MORE force than that, the bullet even in slow motion would very rapidly change direction and Quicksilver would be unable to touch it. I suppose you could argue that we haven't seen Magneto's effect on slow-motion bullets but I would say we have...when they were shot at in DOFP I doubt Magneto wasn't trying to stop or slow them - (perhaps he couldn't stop them dead like we know older Magneto can because he's not that powerful yet) - it's just that the focus was on Quicksilver, whose power over bullets makes Magneto's not even worth paying attention to.  So, yeah I agree Magneto in changing trajectory is applying force. But it is negligible to Quicksilver. For anything to be not negligible to him we would see it moving normal speed in bullet-time  (or it be absolutely massive like a slow - moving black hole which would kill Quicksilver dead)."
AskScienceFiction,3dvgd6,League-TMS,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:12 2015 UTC,The prison break-out bullets were plastic (or some non-metallic material).  We know that Mags can deflect bullets as of First Class.

AskScienceFiction,3dvgd6,Sophophilic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:15 2015 UTC,"Magnetic fields work according to time. If Quicksilver is applying enough force in a short enough amount of time, he can overpower Magneto's magnetic fields."

The Formics were able to use this to tap into human systems and determine that Ender would be the one to lead the force that would destroy them.  The Fantasy Game itself was also somewhat self-aware, in the sense that it could create new environments and react to an individuals personality. This, along with the tampering done by the Formics(the data about his siblings), allowed it to create the adventure that Ender would go through in the Game. Note: It is very possible that the program itself did all of the work here, and the data regarding Ender's siblings was from Battle School databanks. The Formics, having access to this data, were able to reconstruct a replica of the Fantasy for Ender to find later in life.  2) I don't remember. Oops."

As you near the end of the book, Ender discovers that the Formics work as a sort of hive mind, as I'm sure you read. Well, it also says they could communicate this ship to ship with and amplifier, exact details escape me. This implies they have ""evolved"" their form of hive mind communication to the point they literally share mental space with others of their species. Well, in any other science fiction book involving telepathic aliens, which is what this is equivalent to, they can get into others mind's, with positive or negative effects depending on the author's fancy. How I see it, the Formics reached into Ender's mind and began riffling through his memories, looking for something. What, I'm not sure, but I suspect a way to communicate that they were not hostile. They saw the Fantasy Game, and how it's themes paralleled Ender's life, as it was supposed to. Not sure why they chose the mirror as the hiding place for the egg, maybe because it was where he quit. Also, I just had an epiphany. The game was supposed to track Ender's mental health. Well, what if it predicted it, using an algorithim of some sort. When he went through the mirror, he did it with Valentine, ushered along by Peter. Well, when Ender was kicked off Earth by Peter, he went with Valentine, and found the Formics version of Fantasy Land, and kept roaming ""hand in hand"" with her, past the mirror.

I don't want to spoil the details (they are explained later on in the series) but it involves pulling an idea into our reality from a universe of infinite possibilities.  The Formics couldn't communicate with us and believed that to mean we weren't sentient.  After the first failed invasion they came to understand they realised we were sentient and would likely destroy them.  Desperate to escape extinction they reached out with their minds and found Ender was to be their doom.  They found a strong impression of his consciousness in the fantasy game and used it give him instructions on how to find the queens egg.  2)  After the first invasion Earth's politics reorganised to the International Fleet.  The Hegemongy is the governing body with the Hegemong the ceremonial leader. The Strategoi are in charge of planetary defense and the Polemarch the fleet.  It was a fragile system needed to fight the risk of extinction and as soon as the Formics ceased to be a threat it fell apart. The Eastern block;  formerly Russia, China and Poland were already mobilising troops to prepare for a separation from the Hegemongy during the events of the third invasion.  Peter Wiggin was a genius and saw this well before the invasion started.  He enlisted the help of Valentine to write political commentary that would eventually lead to him being elected Hegemong and re-establishing the role as a powerful one.  It lead to the colonising of other planets but the role of Hegemong effectively died with him."

Since the Formics have natural access to the web, they can in principle access the aiua of any living creature, Ender included.  In practice it's easier said than done, but Ender has a particularly strong aiua, and is atypically receptive. As it happens the ansible also uses the philotic web to provide FTL communication.  This gives the Formics a channel to communicate with and manipulate systems connected to the ansible, such as the Fantasy Game. As to the second question.  Sort of the point of the IF is that it's a cooperative venture on the part of all Earth governments.  Anybody from Earth is 'good', and anybody threatening Earth is 'bad'.  It functions much in the same was as the old United Nations forces did.  There is a lot of politicking regarding leadership, but the nationality of the crew of any given ship of the line is not supposed to matter very much."
AskScienceFiction,3dsxtx,XenoRyet,2,Sun Jul 19 08:23:19 2015 UTC,"You should read the sequels. They are amazing. Also, they have the answers to these questions (the first question in the original saga, the second question in the Shadow series).    2nd Question: I'll answer this one first because it's easier: The International Fleet has approximately the same structure as the real life U.S. Armed Forces. The top positions are Admirals and Generals, and the officers below them fall into two basic categories for their ranks: if they serve on a ship, the ranks are taken from the U.S. Navy. If they do not, they are taken from the U.S. Army.  Another relevant point is the Triumvirate: The Hegemon, The Polemarch, and The Strategos. These three individual positions are the most powerful in the world.  The Hegemon: Can basically be thought of as the President of the world. I think somewhere it said that this title originally belonged to the U.S. President, but since Peter Wiggin become Hegemon through other means, obviously this was not always the case. The Hegemon is the strongest political position in the world, but because it has no direct control over the International Fleet, it is the weakest in actual power.  The Polemarch: Is in charge of the fleet itself: ships, men, etc. They hold the rank of Admiral of the Fleet (simply addressed as Admiral), from the highest ranking officer in the U.S. Navy. I think Polemarch was originally Russian (as a counterbalance to the US' Hegemon), but the last Polemarch before Peter Wiggin becomes Hegemon is from India, so who knows.  The Strategos: Is in charge of everything related to strategy, specifically Solar System Defense. He has traditionally been Jewish, as stated in Ender's Game that there was a superstition that Jewish leaders didn't lose wars, since the Strategos was Jewish during both Formic Invasions. The Strategos holds the title of General of Army (simply addressed as General).  As you may have deduced, the Polemarch is directly in charge of all the officers whose ranks are taken from the U.S. Navy, and the Strategos is directly in charge of all officers whose ranks are taken from the U.S. Army. Also of note, the Fleet controls its own budget, and receives payments from every country in the world, based on those country's ability to pay.    So that was the second question. Not short, but clear cut. No confusion. The first question is a bit more abstract, and it's almost impossible to explain without spoiling massive parts of the sequels to Ender's Game (Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind). I read the other answers and they're pretty good. If you'd like me to answer the first question as well I'd be more than happy too, but in order to answer it well, it requires serious spoilers."

AskScienceFiction,3dq7m7,Lorix_In_Oz,279,Sat Jul 18 11:21:54 2015 UTC,"This is my headcanon: I think magic is discovered by a person through accident or intense focus, then an imprint of this spell can be made in the magicverse allowing everyone to access it.   Consider two examples: Harry making the snake glass disappear and Harry using Sectum Sempra. In the first example Harry comes across this magic unintentionally when his subconscious and magical ability worked together. This is organic and unpredictable magic. In that case the power was in his mind, not in any words.   Consider again when he used Sectum Sempra. He had no clue what this spell would do, but it worked just like it did for Snape. The power came from the words used. This leads me to believe that Snape discovered this spell either through happy accident or trial and error using that organic style of magic. Once he got it down through concentration and practice he added words of his own choosing to help him access his spell. But spells can take on a life of their own, and now this magical thought and words used to summon it become worn into the magical aether. Like a path through the forest. After Snape created the path, other wizards could stumble on this path without really knowing the destination. In this way, spells are both created and discovered."

That's what I've always thought. The fact that nonverbal and wandless magic exists suggests that neither incantation nor wand movements is truly integral to magic. I think that the use of incantations paired with wand movements is a way to teach, and ensure that the proper spell goes off.

Eragon doesn't even know about this until he's dueling with an elf that just pulls this forbidden knowledge out his ass and fucks Eragon's world up.

This is also why one generally doesn't make things appear out of thin air in that universe or transfigure them- Eragon becomes exhausted just making a palmful of water out of some sand.

AskScienceFiction,3dq7m7,RoboIcarus,24,Sun Jul 19 00:06:22 2015 UTC,"My headcanon is that magic is performed by the subconscious mind tapping into some neuro-magical organ. It's not accessible consciously.  Accidental magic happens when a strong intent gets passed to the subconscious, but to make it reliable and repeatable, wizards use words to evoke a certain feeling or mental state. They're often latin-sounding, but not actually latin, because the wizards in the story grew up in the European tradition, and hearing ""Sectum Sempra"" just sounds like a kind of cutty-slashy nasty hurting attack. Because Harry had enough cultural overlap with Snape, the words had similar enough meaning to evoke the same kind of subconscious effect. The wand motions are complimentary to this, that those hands movements set up some kind of sympathetic signal, like synesthesia, that helps reinforce the intent hinted at by the incantation.  This is also my explanation for why some wizards are inherently skilled, like Hermoine who grew up in a classics household, while others have trouble with simple spells. Under this theory, Japanese spells probably wouldn't work for European wizards at all, and everybody might have worked out little customizations or alterations to make spells work better for them."

So wizards use words to subconsciously to get that instant intent and concentration without it taking 100% of there mental capabilities.  Thats why when learning magic, you need to be aware of what the spell does, and if it has requirements (like ridiculus that need to have a funny mental image).

AskScienceFiction,3dq7m7,Nan0u,6,Mon Jul 20 12:10:38 2015 UTC,"I really like this. I'm modifying it for my head though so that each magical effect already has a word for it and the ""inventor"" is really just discovering it rather than creating it.  I would guess for instance that if Harry wanted to turn the glass vanishing effect into a real ""spell"" he would spend hours trying to recreate the effect using different combinations of magic words, gestures, and thoughts.  Success would be a combination of guesswork, researching previous spells to compare with, and perhaps a more skilled witch or wizard might be able to produce a weaker version of the effect if they were close and sort of play warmer-colder until they figure it out perfectly. There might also be some sort of magical intuition that plays into it."

To answer the question, maybe inventing spells comes with a bit of intuition?  I mean, you can't hand a young wizard a wand and expect them to cast even a spell as simple as winguardium leviosa, no matter if they know the words or not.  They still need to figure out how to intuit the magic, the wand motions and words just help them focus that specific bit of magic in them.  So maybe inventing a spell just means intuiting the magic without the word and motion, like putting together furniture without the manual.  You know the kind of furniture you want, maybe a chair or a bed, but you have to figure out the rest.  But once it's built, you know the steps on how to get there and you can teach others."

AskScienceFiction,3dq7m7,PalermoJohn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:26:03 2015 UTC,"I think all spells already exit out in the ether. To discover a ""new"" spell, you decide what you want the result of the spell to be. Then you study and focus and use your innate magical ability to suss the spell out of the ether into a directed force. In doing so, magical words are added at the time of the spell ""creation"" that imprint on that preexisting spell force. Now, whenever someone tuned to the magical realm utters those words, the spell is summoned from the ether and acts through the summoner. Some spells are too strong for just anyone to summon, like a patronus. Likely, the smattering of different languages that make up most spells reflect the origin of the first person to summon that spell force to world. And older spell, like avada kedavra, would be from a much more ancient language, which it is, aramic. But I don't think spells are invented. I think they are a natural part of the magical ether and their effects are summoned by wizards who imprint their own magical words to summon them. I am sure that some wizards are powerful enough and in tune with the magical realm that they can summon ( a word I use loosely because I don't necessarily mean to imply these spells are alive) spells without using words, just through their natural affinity to magic. And anything for which there isn't a natural magical spell in the ether can not be created, such as a bringing back to life spell. It just doesn't exist, so no matter how mard you try to get it you will fail."

AskScienceFiction,3dq7m7,SexualPie,38,Sat Jul 18 15:58:44 2015 UTC,"It's probably a mix between the process of trying a new wand - some things just work - and experimenting with the grammar of spells.  Wingardium Leviosa - why is it like that? Maybe the first bit modifies the object to allow easy physical movement and the second bit applies gentle upward force.  Same thing with sectumsempra I guess. Maybe there's a household spell called sectum for cutting fabric, and sempra (meaning forever in latin) enhances strength of some spells. Coupled with aggressive hand movement you could probably guess what it would do to someone.  And, conversely, there's probably a feedback loop 'into the system', in that the more he used it the more it embedded itself into the magic system and it was then available for other people to use more easily - sort of like becoming its own spell rather than a mishmash of bits of other spells.  Think of it like latin, or esperanto. You can know all the basics to either language quite easily, but you can put add-ons and additions and modifications and enhancements and negations on top of words ad infinitum. I think it's just a grammar of spellwords that particular people are skilled at deducing and manipulating."

AskScienceFiction,3dq7m7,EchoFaust,8,Sat Jul 18 15:36:27 2015 UTC,"Rather than magic being some ethereal dictionary of spells that already exist (for some reason), I believe that spells are made up of magical ""elements"" that invisibly govern the forces of the world. Sort of like a Periodic Table of Magic (rather than the mythical concept of earth, fire, water, air, etc.).  Because magic is intrinsically linked to the soul of the wizard (or perhaps the magical soul is a magical element as well) wizards are capable of interacting with these elements.   These elements seem to have a minute level of intelligence (or perhaps only a computative decisiveness), and so when a wizard performs a spell, elements inherently understand they are being called upon via the intent of the language of the spell (contrary to the intent of the Wizard).  While single element spells, like Accio, are prevalent, more complicated spells, like Expecto Patronum, are made up of multiple elements.  When a wizard casts a spell like Lumos, the magic understands that you are attempting to access the illumination element -- but you could say the equivalent of Lumos in any language and it would still work, so long as the word meant the same thing in the same essential context (and, in the case of multi-element spells, accessed the same elements in the same order).   That's why accidental or inncorectly performed magic is so dangerous; if you don't know exactly what you're trying to do, you're essentially accessing the elements at random.  In the case of silent magic, you either mentally recite the spell as you understand it (or recall the feeling of using the spell). Either way, I don't think the elements really care about how you contact them, so long as the intent of the language is clear."
AskScienceFiction,3dq7m7,MiaFeyEsq,4,Sat Jul 18 18:45:07 2015 UTC,"It's like how some people are just naturally good at languages or math.  They just intuitively get it.  So it's not so much that Snape invented something new, he just discovered magic that was always there to be done.  He's intuitive enough about it that he was able to discover spells and potions techniques that were not known before, or if they were, how to do it better."
AskScienceFiction,3dq7m7,sotonohito,6,Sat Jul 18 15:38:00 2015 UTC,"Contrary to popular myth, the words don't technically have anything to do with the magic effect.  Most European wizards use a sort of dog Latin for their incantations, but wizards from other cultures use other sources for the words of an incantation (a muggle sociolinguist would find this field fascinating).  In fact, when a wizard develops a spell they imprint their desire for the effects of the spell on the cosmos.  This imprinting fades over time if the spell isn't used, a spell that hasn't been used for centuries may not work at all if you attempt it today.  But the imprint of a frequently used spell is reinforced with every use.    As a result, a wizard or witch who is told the incantation and wand movements for a spell can produce the effect without actually knowing what that effect was supposed to be, as Mr. Potter learned almost at the cost of young Mr. Malfoy's life.  The process of imprinting a spell upon the fabric of reality is arduous and requires long periods of meditation, experimentation, and diligent work.  For this reason, and because during he imprinting period a wizard will often refine their incantation and wand movement, even some educated wizards are under the misunderstanding that the wizard developing a spell is somehow learning it from the universe, when the truth is that the wizard is teaching the spell to the universe.  It is unlikely that the young Severus Snape, gifted though he was, managed to develop an entirely new spell during his time as a student, more likely he found the sectumsempra spell in an obscure work on the Dark Arts and employed it, thus re-enforcing its existence, before it had fully faded."

I'm looking at you Wingardium Leviosa, a little too close to levitate to be a coincidence. It makes more sense for the spell to be generated elsewhere, then named so it can be called upon more easily. Like making a link or named pointer.

Since as they say any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.  The tech didn't really come with instructions though and each user found their own way to interact with it, the the method they chose to interact with it also influenced the kind of magic they could produce. One techno mage was a knitter, and when she worked magic, she pictured different knots and knitting patterns, she was really good at making shields. The protagonist saw everything as mathematical polynomials with multiple terms and because of this, he was able to do things that the other mages weren't able to do. Since he could mix and match different spells with different terms in his equation. or even submit a spell with no terms. I always imagine magic something like this. Wizards don't really understand magic, at least most of them don't, they say the words and move their wands at first, and then kind of like riding a bike, one day they realize that they really don't have to do that anymore they just know how to get things to do things.  but at the same time, words have power, well words and intent, just like Harry couldn't cast avada kedavra because he didn't want to kill someone, he could cast Sectum Sempra because he really wanted to hurt Malfoy.

A wand is a channel for the potential energy, making it easier to move energy from one place to another.  The words are a focusing lens, telling the magic what to do once it's out of the wand.  To make a new spell, you figure out the best word/syllable arrangement that makes the raw magic work right.

AskScienceFiction,3duif5,AmericanDerp,11,Sun Jul 19 16:36:48 2015 UTC,"Well first, let's outline the scenario.  Sentinels are killing the remaining mutants of the world using the stolen DNA and ability of Mystique combined with Trask tech to emulate and counter mutant abilities.  How does this affect this battle?   The Sentinels cannot copy the abilities of any of the new arrivals, because none of them are mutants. They can counter them with any of the abilities they've already emulated, but they can't easily nullify any of the power put against them.  The dispatched force was designed to hunt down a small cadre of mutants, most of whose abilities were well known. The net victory conditions are the same- the Sentinels are on a search and destroy mission, and the X-Men only need to delay long enough for Kitty Pryde to project someone back into their past self.    All that said, the situation pretty much plays out the same as it did previously- the X-Men will succeed.  Why? Because the Sentinels are unequipped to deal with any of the new variables, and have no defense other than attacking with their stolen powers or mobbing the new arrivals en masse. As it stood, the X-men present pretty much handled the attack well until the Sentinels began to counter their abilities and close to melee range. With additional forces added that can't be countered, the sentinels will not breach the monastery and cannot stop the transfer. In fact, considering the heroes assembled, it's unlikely they even survive the first engagement.  As to the individual heroes, let's assume there's no 'meet cute' required or any cliched 'good guys fight and then team up' thing going on, everybody knows everyone, trusts everyone's talents and does their job. They have some amount of time to be briefed and ready, and have a plan.  Falcon will fly recon and forward observer. He will not engage unless he is engaged himself, and will report the aerial approach of the Sentinels dropships. he will then fly back to remain in the airspace of the monastery and provide close air support should any stragglers get through the defense line.  At the first sighting of the enemy, Blink will blink out with a very special cargo on a series of exhausting teleports. She will not be present during any of the battle.  The front line defensive force will be aerial, and will consist of Vision, Iron Man, War Machine, Thor, Storm, Star-Lord in the Milano, and Captain America and Melinda May in a Quinjet.   It is very unlikely the Sentinels even defeat this initial force, as the heroes assembled have fought more dangerous and numerous foes in group settings and defeated them by the dozens. Tides do turn in battle, however, and if the melee begins to go the wrong direction, Cap will order Vision to leave the scene, as he knows what to do. Vision will fly directly into the temple leaving the others to their fate.  If by any chance the force somehow makes it past this assemblage, they will be met on the monastery grounds by a very well armed Rocket, Groot, Drax, Gamora, Bishop, Quake, Luke Mitchell, Iceman, and Scarlet Witch, commanded by Agent Phil Coulson. Again, the odds are not in the favor of the Sentinels.  Whatever is left of the enemy that breaches the gates will find that there is a platoon of non-mutant humans protecting every corridor and chamber, all well armed and very skilled. The robots will then be attacked and harassed by Lance Hunter, Warpath, Grant Ward, and 'Mack', commanded by Bobbi Morse, who will make hit and run attacks, and retreat while warning those in the inner chambers that the enemy has breached the interior. Falcon will retreat into here also if it's clear the exterior is lost.  Quicksilver will be running into and out of the battle, constantly running back to relay the status of the engagement, and then returning to strike when and where he can. If he is to fall it will be by his sister's side.  It is also within these halls that once the others have retreated behind him, Daredevil will extinguish all light in several areas and attack anything that enters the area, armed with everything and anything Gamora was willing to lend to him in the way of melee weapons, until he is stopped.  However, the interior of the monastery is where the real gambit is being played out and therefore will both be the best protected and yet the most vulnerable.   Inside the center chamber will be Kitty Pryde, Charles Xavier, Hank McCoy, Magneto, Henry Pym, Hope Van Dyne, Bruce Banner, Gemma Simmons, and Wolverine. Most of these people will be concentrating on completing the transfer and therefore won't be able to offer much of a defense, so Sunspot, Luke Cage, Colossus, Jessica Jones, as well as any survivors from the previous fights will be outside of each entrance providing last ditch security.  The good news is that the assembled scientific knowledge is likely to radically advance the timetable of transfer, so that it will not require as much sacrifice to hold the enemy off before the transfer is complete.  As soon as Vision arrives, however, several of the group will split along with him to a corner and begin a very careful, but ultimately critical operation. Blink will arrive, then exit with one of their number, barely without notice to most of the people present.  In the extremely unlikely scenario that this chamber is breached, the remaining Sentinels will then face Hank McCoy in Beast mode, and an enraged Magneto who has been chomping at the bit to fight...and no matter what forces the Sentinels bring to bear, the heroes still have a Hulk present. Again, this alone should be an unsurmountable barrier.  We are literally in impossibility territory here, as no force of Sentinels ever made should even be able to get within sight of Kitty Pryde, Xavier, and the reclining Wolverine. But if they somehow slew the entire assemblage of heroes and approached the actual scene of the transfer, another group's mission will likely have been completed, and Xavier would break contact and blast out a telepathic message for the last ditch gambit, the final card to play.  __  Far away, in the central control center for the Sentinels, a duo would be waiting. They've been masquerading as normal denizens, stealthily making their way through layers of security until they are but a few meters away from the mainframe that communicates with all the Sentinels. In a purple flash, Blink will step through her portal, exhausted, ferrying Leo Fitz and Ant-Man.  Blink will the port off once more, knowing the Sentinels have been instantly alerted to the presence of Mutant DNA. Black Widow and Hawkeye will emerge from the shadows, fitting on their combat uniforms and ask Leo Fitz one question: ""Do you have it?"" to which Leo will unsheath a small box and nod.  Ant-Man will immediately begin breaching the final security protocols, and wihin minutes the group will be facing the main communications hub for the entire local Sentinel forces. As Leo approaches, opening the box, the Sentinels will arrive, searching for mutants. They will find only bullets, explosive arrows and the Black Widow's sting.  Ignoring Scott Lang's constant insistence to hurry, and trying to ignore the legions of ants the guy brings everywhere, Fitz will slot in a specially made drive consisting of more than a few valuable parts of the Vision's CPU into the comm mainframe. It will light up and begin its work as the Sentinels finish off the valiant Hawkeye and Widow and enter the chamber. Ant-Man will run screaming at the Sentinels, a carpet of ants in tow, but Fitz will gain no hope from it, as he and everyone else knew this was a one way trip. He's been on one-way trips before, and he stopped being scared of them a long time ago.   His last consolations are hearing Lang's final quip as he is murdered (a pretty funny one, actually), and seeing the the 'downloading' bar reach 100% on the display of the drive- his resulting ironic smile will be permanently etched on his face after he is impaled by a metallic arm-spike from behind.  __  Xavier will wince and sigh as he feels the minds of his special unit blink out one by one, and look at the feverish Kitty Pryde, who will simply shake her head. This isn't going to happen in time, even with all the genius minds that had been assembled and then died to preserve this moment. He will survey the mounds of bloodied, burnt, frozen, twisted, and broken bodies around him, look sadly one last time at the lifeless corpse of Eric Lensherr, then turn to face the enemy, determined to die with his pride intact. He stares the lead approaching Sentinel right in his beady, glowing white eyes, face tight with determination.   The death he expects never occurs. In fact the Sentinel freezes, and its eyes begin to glow a brilliant yellow, the color of the sun. Behind him the Vision rises, the mind gem in his forehead scintillatingly bright. He will smile gently and speak softly-  ""I am sorry I took so long, Professor Xavier. The toll for my delay appears to have been great. However I have good news..""  ""I know where the Master Mold is, and I have control of all of his Sentinels within communication range. we will not be bothered again for a while. Miss Pryde, you may however still want to complete your task, as the ones I cannot control are coming, and the Master Mold knows where I am now, as well. The day is far from won.""   Xavier will ask, ""How many are coming?""  ""All of them.""  __  Logan awakens to the song 'The first time Ever I Saw Your Face', naked in a bed, a pretty equally naked blonde draped over him. The image, of hundreds of golden glowing Sentinels lifitng into the sky behind a rising Vision to face an approaching cloud of silvery death, fades away in his mind, the last thing he'll remember for quite a while."

Things may well have gone better in DOFP had this been true. It was a long and bloody conflict, probably with much death before Kitty could even use or develop or new powers...Hank McCoy had most likely been dead for a while. Though most of the MCU heroes would likely make it, I have to reason that SHIELD and other mostly baseline humans would have been killed earlier, probably Ant-Man and Daredevil as well. (Even if Sentinels were only going after mutants, surely Lang, Murdock, Jones, Cage etc would all have tried to help. Sentinels destroyed all humans who tried to help.)"

AskScienceFiction,3duif5,DVentresca,3,Sun Jul 19 18:43:44 2015 UTC,"Probably pretty badly. With the exception of Vision and maybe Groot, I don't think any of those are a match for a single Sentinel, let alone an indefinite number of them."

AskScienceFiction,3dsdnl,bobsaintclair,11,Sun Jul 19 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"Go on a road trip to a well established brothel. The more established and the further, the better. Ask for a popular prostitute and sleep with them. Go back home and live your life."
AskScienceFiction,3dsdnl,deafblindmute,6,Sun Jul 19 02:36:48 2015 UTC,That's the actual advice one of the victims says and one character is believed to have done such a thing for the exact reason.
AskScienceFiction,3dsdnl,richieg7777,5,Sun Jul 19 03:55:11 2015 UTC,"The character only goes to a prostitute in their town though. It's probably the best tactic for survival any of them actually attempts, but (at least partially because of his age and assumed lack of means) he doesn't do a particularly good job of the long distance element."
AskScienceFiction,3dsdnl,deafblindmute,5,Sun Jul 19 04:08:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was perfect, but as far as advice goes, he actually listened. Maybe that prostitute will go to a big hooker-off convention and orgy it up?   Actually, on that note, when you have group sex with someone who is cursed, how does it determine who will die first?"
AskScienceFiction,3dsdnl,richieg7777,2,Sun Jul 19 04:11:29 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, in theory it would pass on in order of who ""engages"" with who first.  Importantly though (and this is why the loose term ""engage"" is actually useful here and not me just being bashful), we aren't sure whether It will follow for anything besides male-female vaginal intercourse. This actually presents a relatively likely possibility for why the prostitute strategy (which as you said was as good a move as he could have made) could have failed or at least why it might not have been as effective as hoped (i.e. if the prostitute gave him a blowjob or only gave blowjobs after him until she was killed)."

AskScienceFiction,3dsdnl,waiv,6,Sun Jul 19 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"Well, we can see that It needs to be able to enter a place as normally as any other person. So physically, you should be fine with any safe house that would keep most robbers out.  Mentally though, you'd be staring down your sexful death everytime you look out the window, waiting for you to slip up, or get something delivered...  To be perfectly safe, I'd have your food flown in. With a side of prostitutes."
AskScienceFiction,3dsdnl,puremassey,6,Sun Jul 19 01:57:55 2015 UTC,"I said it once before, I believe the best way of dealing with It would be locking It in a vault. Seeing as it possesses limited super strenght (can kill a human and break wood but it doesn't seems to handle walls too well) and it apparently adheres to some vampire-like rules (can't just kick down the door and kill you), as well as considering that It only walks in a straight line, if you managed to lure It into a vault and close the door, you'd be safe as long as it wasn't reopened. Even better, if It takes a few years to claw it's way out, perhaps all heirs to the curse will have perished by then.  Just make sure said vault isn't Vault 69 or something."
AskScienceFiction,3dsdnl,Sharptrooper,3,Sun Jul 19 03:17:14 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be that easy. It's got some degree of intelligence and can wait for opportunities to arise. It doesn't just walk in a straight line. Definitely possible, however."
AskScienceFiction,3dsdnl,my-secret-identity,5,Sun Jul 19 03:30:00 2015 UTC,"Option 1) buy a safe that is large enough to hold a human being. Since you're a teenager, borrow mom's credit card to do this. Wait for the monster to get nearby. Shoot it in the head with an automatic gun. (it should be harder for it to recover from multiple bullets) When it is unconscious/healing, push it into the safe. Lock safe. if the monster is contained, just bury the safe somewhere. Or take it out to sea or something.   Option 2) The monster has mass. People besides the person who is being chased are capable of touching it and covering it with sheets and stuff. Get a police officer to see you being chased by this invisible monster. When he sees the monster and believes for himself, explain your circumstances and rules that the monster follows. Eventually, more attention will come. The government will help you avoid the monster. They'll form a plan to help you incapacitate the monster, load the monster into a rocket, and shoot it into space. It just has to get outside orbit and there's no way it's gonna come back! Not sure how realistic this solution is though...."

AskScienceFiction,3dsdnl,The_Flabbergaster,3,Sun Jul 19 02:42:56 2015 UTC,"1) It can be captured. One, you can throw a blanket on it, which means you can definitely throw a net on it. It also cannot undo even simple locks and cannot transform into anything that's not human (I guess, since it only takes on human forms) so putting it in a pit or a pool works.   2) If you lock yourself in a safehouse, it'll find you and eventually find a way to get to you. Even if it means standing outside your door forever; after all, no one else can see it. As for an island? It'll totally buy you more time, since the movie leads you to believe that it cannot swim (the edge of the lake, the pool, etc.) But, knowing that you're in a horror movie, expect the first supply boat or rescue boat to have It onboard.   3) What I think happens is that it's a sequential list. X bangs Y, Y bangs Z, Z bangs Z1, Z1 bangs X. If this is the case, the monster goes to kill X, then Z1, Z, Y, W, V, U, T...etc."
AskScienceFiction,3dsdnl,richieg7777,3,Sun Jul 19 03:54:23 2015 UTC,"If you get the jump on It and have sex with it, does that mean it is then compelled to commit suicide?"
AskScienceFiction,3dsdnl,MatttheM,4,Sun Jul 19 10:09:54 2015 UTC,"Best way to deal with it is to put as much distance between you and the last person you gave it to.  Because it magically knows where you are, and can magically get to you. The only reason distance is even mentioned is so that you lower the chance of getting it passed back."
AskScienceFiction,3dsdnl,Pm_Me_Gifs_For_Sauce,2,Sun Jul 19 00:26:47 2015 UTC,What happens if you go somewhere it can't walk to? Like space? Does it just wait until you die from natural causes then move on? Can it swim?
