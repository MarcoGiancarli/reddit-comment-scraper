She's recovering from a pretty nasty UTI, and when she started leaking pee (which didn't start until almost a week into her antibiotic treatment), the vet did some x-rays. On the x-ray, there was a bright spot that they thought might have been a kidney stone that had moved and started to cause problems, so they recommended doing an ultrasound to know for sure.  Fortunately, the bright spot is just a small nodule of scar tissue from when she was spayed as a kitten! And all of her organs look perfect, so I'm relieved to have that piece of mind! :)"

I rescued her a week ago and the vet said she was 5 weeks old, though she was underweight and seems developmentally behind.   She's doing a lot better now; she looks a lot healthier, she has more energy, she's eating canned food and using the litter box. She could still stand to gain more weight, but we're on the right track! But in the meantime I have a ton of tiny kitten pictures :)"

I saw a window somewhat distant and hose neighbours were apparently having a party... I went in our roof and screamed to get their attention and ask if it was their cat, and the 20 or so people who were inside and saw me started to hide and look frightened.. Eventually I showed them the cat and they made positive signs, so I put her back on the roof and off she went... Yesterday, a couple weeks later, she appeared again... I popped in the roof and saw their window is open, so it's probably fine!"

She is now 17lbs, vet is happy with her progress, and determined she won't lose much more weight without flat out starving her which I refuse to do. She gets a certain amount of food each day, and doesn't even eat as much as she's allowed according to the vet. I play with her as much as she wants each day so she gets her exercise. The difference in her attitude the past year as she lost the weight is amazing too. She jumps up places now instead of an awkward climb/Mufasa impression.

catbellies,2z2lcs,Raveynfyre,1 point,Sat Mar 14 23:56:51 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look like the description is displayed in my link.  We call this the lying belly, because just like the cake, this offer of belly to scritch is a lie.   As you can see she only has three legs, and we firmly believe that it's the result of abuse. She is extremely skittish, and wary of being picked up or petted if she is on the floor. Also, the tail-tuck to protect privates is a classic sign of submission and fear when combined with the belly-up position.  As you can see, the very tip of her tail is missing also. The injury that caused this happened prior to the adoption, but we had no idea. Our vet thought that she had a spot of ringworm, and we treated the area for that. After two weeks, more fur fell off from the area, and the ringworm culture came back negative. So she was taken back to the vet, and as she was removed from the carrier, the tip of her tail fell off.  It's believed that her tail was slammed in a door, either at the first place she lived in, or possibly in the cage door at the humane society. She was two months old (and 10 days out of her leg removal surgery) when we adopted her.  Here is a link to the entire album I created for her.   She turns 3 in a month and a half."

She's usually super tolerant and easygoing but she HOWLED like she was being murdered for the entire flight. I could feel the guilt killing my soul!!!"
catbellies,2xkehg,squidwizard,1 point,Sun Mar 1 20:52:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah the sedative actually wore off quickly :/ so the airport was traumatizing, but once we got in the plane he fell asleep. No one knew he was there until we landed and he started meowing haha.   He's fine once there's no stopping and going, rides on the highway and apparently planes he's cool."
