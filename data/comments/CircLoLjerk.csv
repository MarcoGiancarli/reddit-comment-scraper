CircLoLjerk,3dhqz0,-Shank-,7,Thu Jul 16 19:11:44 2015 UTC,"lol stupid KR fanboys, there's literally no basis for saying TSM won't win worlds. You probably think Fnatic getting to semifinals means that they'll beat TSM at worlds but you're sadly mistaken. MSI doesn't mean anything, our only goal is to win worlds, MSI was a good international exposure for TSM that will make our win at worlds all the more likely. There's no way in hell Fnatic will upset TSM. TSM has one of the oldest players, Dyrus, who is able to single handedly carry games like he did at MSI. On top of that they have the most effective team owner in league of legends history, Reginald, who himself could embarrass Febiven, as well as the hands down best Western coach, Locodoco. Locodoco himself has had a very accomplished career as a player, especially in OGN, which is now LCK. Moreover, we also have Bjergsen who is essentially the Faker of the West with how badly he stomps other midlaners.   You're probably going to reply saying that Fnatic still has a better team, but you're wrong. Huni is very meta dependent, he needs very specific picks in order to shine. Couple this with the fact that Fnatic only knows how to play around Huni as carry, you'll see that it's very easy to beat Fnatic if you only ban the 2 champions that Huni plays. Dyrus on the other hand is a very effective top laner with great game knowledge due to his experience. The only thing deeper than Dyrus' knowledge of playing 2v1s is his champion pool. TSM could ban all of Fnatics top laner's and Dyrus would have at least 2 times the amount of champions as Huni.  In the jungle, reignover is a complete push over when compared to Santorin. Reignover is a failed Korean import who was already faltering on his irrelevant Korean team. The fact that he only speaks korean means there just isn't team synergy or communication which is the single most important  skill for any pro jungler to have. TSM on the other hand have Santorin who is probably the best Western jungler since Meteos stopped playing for C9. Not only does Santorin have an enormous champion pool, having mastered mechanically intensive champions like Vi, but his presence on ALL lanes is unmatched.  In the midlane we have Bjergsen who is quite literally the best Western player. No one on any other team has close to the mechanical ability that Bjergsen does. Even if you want to compare us to Korea, you can see that Bjergsen is better than Faker in many areas, including his mechanics as shown by how he out cs'ed Faker at MSI despite losing the game. Febiven however is completely useless for Fnatic. Febiven himself is not a playmaker, as shown by his lackluster champion pool. Coupled with the fact that Fnatic has to channel all of its resources into Huni, it becomes obvious that Bjergsen will completely destroy Huni, even without jungler intervention.  In the bot lane, TSM also has ridiculous powerhouses. In the marksman role, we have multiple advantages. Keith and Wildturtle each bring a wide array of champions that allows TSM to be incredibly flexible in their comps. This strategy of having 2 players you can switch out has been extremely successful internationally and in Korea, as shown by SKT's 2 mid laners. Moreover, both of our ADCs have impeccable positioning in teamfights that lets them maximize their damage. Fnatic's Rekkless, on the other hand has none of those. Rekkless is not aggressive enough in team fights and as a result, his damage output is very low. I gaurentee you, even if you give Rekkless a whole BF sword up on Turtle, Turtle will still out damage him. The only redeeming factor for Rekkless is that he is very passive in lane which will be critical for Fnatic so that their bot lane doesn't get destroyed because reignover has to camp top.  Now on support, Lustboy completely outclasses Yellowstar. Lustboy has had an all-around more successful career than Yellowstar, having finaled at OGN with an enormous win streak. Like all the other TSM players, Lustboy is mechanically gifted. His thresh play rivals that of Madlife, whereas Yellowstar's only famous play is him whiffing every thresh spell and flash.   Finally in the team aspect of the game, TSM all round beats Fnatic. No Western team has the mechanical ability, perfect shot calling and team synergy and the draft phase of TSM, who were even able to outdraft SKT.   So next time you decide to say that we won't do well at worlds, think before you talk. You EU  fanboys are probably going to delete your Reddit accounts after Fnatic crashes and burns and see that we were right all along."

If any of his points were truthful, that would be one thing, but they were clearly one sided and extremely exaggerated. Not to mention he hides behind this ""journalism"" bullshit while any fucking journalist out there would tell you that a journalist doesn't report on shit they have direct involvement with.
