I usually find out about it through /r/buildapcsales or /r/buildapc. All you do is submit and edit an image, and they send you the mousepad in about 2-3 weeks! Ive already received a previous mousepad of me in my football gear that i gifted to my dad, and the quality is absolutely amazing!   This is where you can make one, but for $6 as no sale is going on! http://www.artscow.com/photo-gifts/mousepad/large-mousepad-160"

HouseOfCards,3drarb,talltexas,81,Sat Jul 18 18:24:01 2015 UTC,"Many of the encounters give insight into the emotion state of Claire.  Just for example, she ran into the older cashier lady just a bit after firing her friend, who had said that she wouldn't be able to find work at her age.  It's a way to show that she's feeling guilt, rather than saying it, which is something that more shows need to learn to do."
HouseOfCards,3drarb,DatClubbaLang96,14,Sat Jul 18 18:38:28 2015 UTC,"Yea you hit it on the head. While I agree more shows need to be better at showing things instead if telling it, this particular example here felt a little too on the nose."

Homeless man: money/power isn't everything/ amazing things come from unexpected places.

HouseOfCards,3dn9so,Dicethrower,8,Sat Jul 18 03:35:44 2015 UTC,"The product placement gets a bit annoying at times, but I feel it also lends an air of realism to the show, which makes it a lot more exciting/interesting to watch. I'd much rather they use the names of real people, stores (eg: Walmart), websites (eg: eBay), and games (eg: Monument Valley) than have fictional versions for each of those. Plus, of all the shows and movies that do product placement, House of Cards seems to pull it off a lot more tastefully."
HouseOfCards,3dn9so,madhavnarayan,0,Sat Jul 18 04:14:30 2015 UTC,"but I feel it also lends an air of realism to the show   It breaks the immersion for me, so it does the exact opposite imo. Also, you're making the assumption you'd need to mention any products at all. He could have just read a good book of the guy and then decided to hire him as a writer. No real journalist on that level would write game reviews anyway, at least not to the point where I'd want to hire someone like that to write an entire book, it just made no sense.     I agree HoC does it more tasteful than most shows, but then again, I don't watch any other shows for exactly that reason. Besides 20min advertisement an hour, there's the constant product placement/cameo on top of that. I quit TV and went full internet about a year ago because I was so sick of advertisements. Haven't looked back since."
HouseOfCards,3dn9so,Dicethrower,3,Sat Jul 18 04:46:33 2015 UTC,"To real journalist on that level would write game reviews anyway, at least not to the point where I'd want to hire someone like that to write an entire book, it just made no sense.   Fair point. I forget though; did Underwood hire him solely on the basis of his review for Monument Valley? I do remember that Doug had first approached him at a book signing for one of his new books.   Regarding the product placement, I guess I see what you're saying. I quite enjoy it when its subtle and tasteful, but the way they did it for things like Monument Valley (and to some extent, the PS Vita) was a little too blatant, and it seemed rather artificial/forced that Underwood would care so much about something so (seemingly) insignificant. Out of curiosity, do you feel the same way about having real journalists cameo in the show? That is definitely a better way to add authenticity than product placement."
HouseOfCards,3dn9so,madhavnarayan,2,Sat Jul 18 05:04:32 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I forget though; did Underwood hire him solely on the basis of his review for Monument Valley?     If I'm not mistaken, yes. He read the review and was so moved that he played the game, at least that's what he told him."

I wouldn't write a review for you because it might rather spoil not the plot, but your perspective and viewing of the show. It's better if you watch the show yourself and judge it yourself.

Season 4 revolves around a spiritual journey where Claire is undergoing a schizophrenic episode, battling with her inner demons to figure out her true identity. It would fit perfectly, too, considering her unusual performance in Season 3.  The season begins with Claire far from Washington. Her clothes are tattered and worn. She keeps muttering, "" ... Who am I? What am I? What have I done?"" She travels from place to place, changing her identity. Some meet her as Buttercup, a young woman waiting for the crown. Some know her as Erika, a smart, unconventional woman who knows how to get what she wants.  But only one man knows her true identity.  One day, she's finally made it to a city and is virtually unrecognizable. She's lost and confused, both philosophically and literally -- she took a wrong turn and ended up in the wrong part of town.  ""Hey buttercup, I've been waiting!""  She freezes. The world grinds to a halt, yet feels like it's spinning. She is too afraid to run, but can't think of how to stay. She does what she should have done before: She turns around to face her demons.  ""Lieutenant Dan?""  ""You're goddamned right it is, Jenny! In all this time, have you ever stopped to think about what you've done? How long you've been gone? What will Forrest think when he finds out you faked your death to live another life doing God knows what?""  Forrest. A name she hadn't heard in years.

He pauses after you are entitled to nothing for the listener to go ""Huh"" before revealing his massive federal jobs program.  Even FDR said things like    I regard reduction in Federal spending as one of the most important issues in this campaign. In my opinion it is the most direct and effective contribution that Government can make to business.   -Campaign Address on the Federal Budget at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, October 19, 1932.   I accuse the present Administration of being the greatest spending Administration in peacetime in all American history - one which piled bureau on bureau, commission on commission, and has failed to anticipate the dire needs or reduced earning power of the people. Bureaus and bureaucrats have been retained at the expense of the taxpayer. We are spending altogether too much money for government services which are neither practical nor necessary. In addition to this, we are attempting too many functions and we need a simplification of what the Federal government is giving the people.""   -Campaign Address on Agriculture and Tariffs at Sioux City, Iowa, September 29, 1932.  Frank channels FDR almost word for word from the late president's speech    The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.The millions who are in want will not stand by silently forever while the things to satisfy their needs are within easy reach. We need enthusiasm, imagination and the ability to face facts, even unpleasant ones, bravely. We need to correct, by drastic means if necessary, the faults in our economic system from which we now suffer. We need the courage of the young. Yours is not the task of making your way in the world, but the task of remaking the world which you will find before you. May every one of us be granted the courage, the faith and the vision to give the best that is in us to that remaking!   -Oglethorpe University Commencement Address"

Perhaps its the bias of me being introduced to House of Cards through Underwood, so Urquhart didn't get the chance to 'wow' me the Underwood did, but I prefer Underwood. He seems more trustworthy from an outsider's view compared to Urquhart (its the Southern accent that does it for me) and has humble origins making his rise to the top all the more sweeter. Underwood gets more characterization due to US HoC longer length, plus Urquhart loses some points for the Mattie and Sarah affairs."

HouseOfCards,3d989y,Acharai,7,Tue Jul 14 15:18:53 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking. I think living in the White House would be incredibly stifling, even without the issues the Underwoods have.   I toured the East Wing once and got to talking to one of the uniformed Secret Service agents on duty for the tours. He said one time Barbara Bush decided she wanted to walk to the drugstore and buy herself a pack of gum like a normal person. So the security detail dressed to blend in with the pedestrians, and also controlled the crosswalk lights near the White House so she would never have to stand still and be a sitting duck, and she bought her gum. What's more, only one person recognized her! A motorist, who watched her cross the street. Of course, who expects to see the First Lady walking to the corner store herself?   I think there would be some significant down sides to living in the White House."

I remember when Michelle Obama was asked on Ellen what she misses the most from the pre-White House life, the First Lady said that it was being able to open windows and feel the breeze. They cannot open a window in a car or in a house because of security, so she joked about how after the presidency she's going to stick her head out of a car like a dog and enjoy the wind."

I also remember watching Veep, and in one of the first episodes they had extreme heat but couldn't open the windows. They made a joke about them being anti-suicide windows, but I'm not that was a joke, lol. As far as I get it, presidents are protected by the Secret Service after the presidency, and the security is more strict when they visit places, talk shows and all that. However they should have a little bit more ""room"", I think, otherwise it really sucks."

Cutting them entirely is somewhat a move in the same vein.   Actually, though, AmWorks is sort of exchanging one entitlement for another. Instead of being entitled to state-funded pension and healthcare, you are entitled to a state-funded job. Terrible for seniors and blue-collar workers whose bodies can't endure the tough labor past age 65, but good for young people and the economy in the extreme short term."

I  won't give specifics because I don't want to give any spoilers, but there are many instances of the classic writing flaw ""telling, not showing"" - where plot is moved forward by mostly dialogue and not by character actions.  There are a lot of ""dead ends"" -  characters and events that go nowhere and serve almost no purpose. The whole Pussy Riot thing really bugged me...  so pointless and not consistent with Frank.   All of the old tropes are back... The breaking of the fourth wall,  intrepid journalists, quick and witty dialogue, but that alone isn't why HoC was fun to watch. Frank and Claire were at their best when they were clawing their way to the top. Now that they're there,  the writers don't know what to do with them."

IMO it's a means of paying respect to the intelligence of the viewer since a lot of mainstream shows have something called chekhovs gun (iirc) whereby anything in a scene has to directly relate to the plot (derived from if a gun is on the wall it has to be fired).   By showing things intimately that have nothing to do with the story itself, it allows us to be immersed in the world and not simply be walked down a path with blinkers on.   I think it also helps to manipulate is into feeling like things are unpredictable.   I love it.   Source: none"

I would additionally suggest that they sometimes act as red herrings, because they throw us off detecting real Chekov's guns and they mean that audiences cannot trust the significance of these scenes until their meanings materialize in the plot."

He will be miserable though. I can't figure out what her plotline would be--I think her running would be too cheesy and too unrealistic.

For 30 years she's hand-in-hand with Frank on their climb to the top, they finally get there and she can't keep her shit together long enough to use it to her advantage?  All season she made several huge mistakes and didn't own any of them - Frank held up every end of their deal, much to his/their expense.  Objectively her character should know she sucked as much as anyone can suck at being ambassador.  Acknowledge that and come up with something else.  She unbelievably has no alternative plan outside of dropping the season-ending bomb which is political suicide in reality?  Is ambassador the best she could come up with? It's BS and doesn't match her end-game of an eventual presidential run.  She's really going to let a few rallies go to her head that she should be running things?  Delusional.   The current story line is hard to believe and I don't get the desire to make Claire and Frank into vulnerable characters when that it not what attracted people to the show.  Private moments of weakness yes, but power people (who are this savvy/smart) don't lose their shit publicly like they have this season.  Frank was constantly behind and outsmarted, Claire let her emotions consume her and took these emotional cues from complete nobodies.  Ridiculous.     I hope Season 4 gets back on track with the writing.  Let the drama/problems come from outside factors, instead of the power couple.  No more Doug/Hooker/Hacker drama, it's a fine story, but lets move onto bigger things.  Besides, the best conflict comes when they're (Claire and Frank) backed into corners and have to find a way out.    I'd like to see more Presidential dealings and see the two of them go back to being the highly intelligent/manipulative sneaky plotters that they are."

HouseOfCards,3cuy3q,fightinscot,8,Sat Jul 11 01:25:19 2015 UTC,"This is really interesting. This article has some interesting insights into what the pear could represent, including anything from temptation for sin, justice, purity, and nobility. Interestingly, it says that ""There are a number of Korean legends which involve the pear as endowing fertility to women"", which might have something to do with them being in the doctor's office.   The difference in color you mentioned could be telling, too. Green is indicative of ripeness, life, and consequently could be interpreted as fertility of some sort, where white doesn't not feel as full of life, somehow. Empty. I might be grasping at straws with that one.  Also, I can't think of the term, but in some of my creative writing classes we went over a concept where a motif was intentionally placed as a recurring element, but not necessarily with meaning behind it, and the purpose was to let the viewer/reader draw their own unique conclusions. This might be a case of that? If I think of the term, I'll edit this."

She tries to distract herself from the reality that she is at the end of her best years by excercising and sleeping with that photographer, but has moments more and more often throughout the show where confrontation with the issue is unavoidable. This leads to feelings of anger and regret over how she's spent her youthful years, the former being directed towards Frank. The pear is just another reminder of the fat going to her hips, and ultimately weighing her down.  Edit:Spelling"

HouseOfCards,3ck617,zgrove,7,Thu Jul 9 02:24:58 2015 UTC,"I really disliked the way the writers handled the characters (among a lot of other things) this season. I had nothing but respect for Claire in seasons one and two. She is every bit as calculated (if not moreso) than Frank. It was refreshing seeing an uncompromising strong woman on television who was sure of herself and knew what she was doing. The unflinching pragmatist has become a very appealing archetype on television and lately men playing these roles have been getting acclaim and love from audiences. I thought it was so awesome and refreshing seeing a female playing this role.   Watching her repeatedly conduct herself like a spoiled, short-sighted, emotional child during season 3 was extremely frustrating to me. I get they were trying to make it seem like she was soul searching and she suddenly developed a concscience, but it felt poorly executed, cliché, and out of left field. Claire Underwood has spent over 25 years in politics. Either the writers forgot that, or they don't give a shit. Honestly the writing of this season was bad on so many levels. It's like they took the intrigue and intelligence of the show, tossed it out, and then settled for political soap opera."

HouseOfCards,3cndvo,howaboot,6,Tue Jul 14 21:00:56 2015 UTC,First let me start by saying Season 3 is not bad. Its not impossible to watch or unbearable. The reason that there is some hate is because of some minor flaws and complaints that kinda hinder the show. It won't completely ruin the watching experience. Some people also say that season 3 was the bad compared to the first 2.  Overall its a great season and yes you should absolutely watch the third season.
HouseOfCards,3cndvo,DavidSSD,5,Thu Jul 9 08:18:38 2015 UTC,It's because now Frank is Prez. Season three was 'bad' compared to the others because he simply can't do as much with all eyes on him. He can't get away with anything like he used to. It was a great season people are just hard to please. 4 will be awesome.

A lot of people complained that there wasn't as much fourth wall breaking by frank, but that's somewhat exaggerated and it actually makes sense given the context, its not like the producers just got lazy. When its appropriate frank does break the fourth wall.   Another complaint was that a certain b plot was too drawn out, but I would argue that while that was true to some degree, it was still worth being included, and payed off in the end. And I actually looked forward to the scenes with this plotline.  The biggest reason I say that this is my favorite however, is that    I understand why some people were less happy with the season, but I would say that you're definitely missing out if you don't watch it."

It's like walking out of the cinema and only then realizing how stupid the movie you enjoyed, was. I won't spoil anything but there are some really stupid scends where some of the main characters talk about % likelyhood of guilt and then restrict their own actions based on statistics pulled out of the proverbial asshole.  However in the same vein of morally ambiguous protagonist,  I really recommend my favourite anime Code geass. At least to me, it has all the strong points of Death note with added gr8 action scenes,  believable romance and progressing technology etc. However you may find quite a few holes in the plot after the experience wears off, just remember thatba lot of surprises in action scenes are foreshadowed in dialogue earlier."

HouseOfCards,3c9j74,FuzzyBacon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:19:52 2015 UTC,"You really do get bored because while it sounds awesome (gain 6 hours a day in one hellish trick!), you actually give up an awful lot to do it. Every 4 hours you pretty much absolutely have to take a nap, so things that take longer are often right out, and the hours you gain are between 1am and 7am, when absolutely fuck all is happening. If you lived in NYC or had a job like a server admin that can mostly be done alone it's not the worst, but for normal people it's not appropriate."
HouseOfCards,3c9j74,davidcu96,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:27:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds pretty negative:  ""Polyphasic sleep can bring many handicaps mainly caused by shorter total sleep duration (in my case 3-hours shorter), mainly lower physical regeneration and physical weakness, especially during transformation from one sleep schedule to another. During this period I could struggle with inferior activity in physical, cognitive and emotional dimensions, for example, lack of alertness, oversensitivity, and confusion. A phenomenon called Immunity fade is also reported: ‗A great deal of polyphasic attempts end up with a cold or influenza, which must reflect the impact of this sleep schedule3 on the immune system‘ (Wozniack, 2010, para. 4). This is one of the key elements during the adaptation, where I can fail a lot. From behavioural point of view, my resistance to various kinds of persuasion or frauds could lower due to a greater frankness to others, related to altruism mentioned in the previous section. Polyphasic sleep can also affect negatively my long-term memory, cause thinking in more chaotic structures, and inability to perform activities that last longer than 5 hours because of the a strict schedule; however rare such activities are, they still pose a failure risk. In that case, I would need either more energy to keep self-concept at same consistency level, or inevitably change self-concept."""
HouseOfCards,3c9j74,FuzzyBacon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:23:16 2015 UTC,"I wasn't advocating for it, just saying it's not bullshit and people can and do successfully do it (aka not Internet crackpot self-help). In fact I explicitly said that I wouldn't do it again because of how hard it is to start and how restrictive it is once you're on it (and also because the hours you gain are in the middle of the night), and I also mentioned how awful you feel during the twoish week transition period.   Once I get to a computer I'll see if I can find the long-term study I referenced, but off the top of my head, the subject (who was a male artist) reported that he felt more creative and testing suggested no significant cognitive deficits, along with slightly improved math skills.   Also, there are multiple ways to do it that each carry different difficulties that go along with transitioning to and maintaining the alternate schedule. The only one I've really done much reading on is the 'uberman' schedule that has you sleeping for 2-2.5 hours per day.  Basically, unless you have a job that benefits from you being around and accessible 24/7, or are doing something like extreme distance sailing (which is what it was first developed for) it's not a particularly useful thing. But it is possible."

No. And here's why.  House of Cards, like its protagonist, is crafty, light on its feet, and has quite the sleight of hand. Plotlines intertwine and conclude in ways that make you go ""OH MY GOD WHAT HOW DID I NOT NOTICE THAT"" and there's an abundance of red herrings that make it difficult to know characters' next move. The show is also unforgiving in its cynicism -- just pay attention to the Washington Times journalist character arcs to see what I mean.  The show is meant to be unpredictable. It's why repeat viewings are such a pleasure; not only is every scene so dense that you don't remember much of the dialogue, but with more context, a lot of the complex and spaghetti-like structure of motives and action becomes much clearer."

Other former presidents (Reagan, FDR, Truman) have been brought up, too. My guess is that the timeline splits after Bush in 2009. The fact he isn't mentioned doesn't tell anything about his existence in the series; a lot of former presidents are not mentioned. And I don't know why Bush shouldn't be in there.   George W. Bush: Jan 2001 - Jan 2009 President X (Obama/?): Jan 2009 - Jan 2013 Garrett Walker: Jan 2013 - Oct 2014 Francis Underwood: Oct 2014 - incumbent   I think we should keep our eyes open to the White House presidential portraits of Bush and Obama, so we can see this timeline as confirmed."
HouseOfCards,3c09bo,f0el0ix,3,Sat Jul 4 12:48:56 2015 UTC,I like it. The time line fits. But Walker is a Democrat. It's not likely he would interrupt Obama's second term. Did Walker challenge and defeat him in the primary or did Obama step down for another reason? Maybe president X was a democrat who beat Bush in 2005.
HouseOfCards,3c09bo,___Rusty,4,Sun Jul 5 13:40:06 2015 UTC,I think that Walker probably beat a single term republican president  who took over after bush. They never mention the bush family though so maybe it was just a bush-esc president like they did with Putin/Petrov

HouseOfCards,3br89k,Rambohunter16,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:34:12 2015 UTC,I liked season 3 more than 2 because I got to watch Frank be a failure.
HouseOfCards,3br89k,whiteonyx981,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:18:06 2015 UTC,I think a reason a lot of people didn't like it was it was different. Season 1 & 2 we see a calm and ruthless frank who does slip up but ultimately is on top. Season 3 we see Frank much more emotional and he's not succeeding in old ruthless ways anymore and people were disappointed with that.
HouseOfCards,3br89k,BurritoFueled,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:23:34 2015 UTC,"Season 3 was pretty great. It's ironic that the most powerful man on earth has even less power now than he did in earlier seasons, and it's interesting seeing Frank come to grips with that. The only problem is that we didn't get another threechum."

HouseOfCards,3bmbxs,windkirby,29,Tue Jun 30 11:16:19 2015 UTC,"remember, you as an audience member have an inside track into Frank's mind and his ideas. Frank telling Linda he wants VP, in her mind, is a just reward for his loyalty (or what she perceives as loyalty) after being denied SecState. They both realize that the only way that either of them, or matthews or walker remain in power is to hold PA and the only way to do that is for Matthews to take the gov spot and open up the VP job."
HouseOfCards,3bmbxs,jkovach89,3,Tue Jun 30 13:29:39 2015 UTC,wait--why do they need to hold PA? I thought Frank convinced Matthews and Walker that Matthews should take PA because he said both were talking shit about each other and that Matthews wasn't happy being VP--was there some reason the democrats really needed PA?
HouseOfCards,3bmbxs,anyhistoricalfigure,6,Tue Jun 30 21:36:23 2015 UTC,"It's a really important swing state, I think."
HouseOfCards,3bmbxs,jkovach89,2,Tue Jun 30 21:39:29 2015 UTC,"IIRC they had a majority only if they held PA. Otherwise the republicans would hold majority in the house. Getting Matthews to run in PA, and win as governor would help strengthen their hold on it for the upcoming midterm."
HouseOfCards,3bmbxs,fairly_quiet,10,Wed Jul 1 15:35:54 2015 UTC,"i may be remembering wrong, but didn't Frank have a plan to actually use Russo if he stayed on track and played along with the gameplan?  i thought Russo didn't become an issue until he started developing a conscience. *shrug*"
HouseOfCards,3bmbxs,Toke_n_Ride138,7,Tue Jun 30 16:28:31 2015 UTC,I would say it was a win-win
HouseOfCards,3bmbxs,razzliox,2,Tue Jun 30 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"When Russo threatens to reveal how he was let off his drunk driving charge, Frank says they have to ""accelerate things"" and asks Doug if he's ready, as if a plan had already been in place. Considering how perfectly everything plays out for Frank, I can't imagine he would have been content just controlling a PA governor rather than getting VP.  Also, in the season one finale, the journalist trio is trying to figure out Frank's angle, and they agree that simply pulling the strings of a PA governor is too small to be Frank's game."
HouseOfCards,3bmbxs,___Rusty,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:19:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the necro.   Considering how perfectly everything plays out for Frank, I can't imagine he would have been content just controlling a PA governor rather than getting VP.   Frank never planned on Doug getting PA, of course, but he didn't plan on killing him."
HouseOfCards,3bmbxs,___Rusty,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:10:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree, that was brought on by Russo's desire to spill the beans. Otherwise his relapse would have been more than enough for Frank to get what he wanted."
HouseOfCards,3bmbxs,billwood09,5,Mon Jul 13 05:07:50 2015 UTC,It's never clear how much Walker and Vaquez have pieced together. It's possible that Vasquez knew everything and was just being pragmatic. She did hide Frank's intentions from the president at first. It might be that she was in too deep once she worked out that Frank propped up a bad candidate.  And remember the punching bag scene at the end of season 2? I suspect Walker had everything put together at that point. He was either too blind or too busy or too trusting of Linda to figure it out sooner.
HouseOfCards,3bqy8m,squarepush3r,13,Wed Jul 1 12:59:49 2015 UTC,"I liked season 3 a lot. I thought it was fun to see Frank actually get outclassed by Petrov. The whole point of the season was that Frank is now in the White House, the eyes of the world are on him, he can't make moves in the shadows anymore like he could before. Without that he can't make offensive moves against political opponents like he used to, he's stuck playing defense now and losing control. I think it's refreshing to see him lose and lash out. Seeing Frank win all the time would get old fast."
HouseOfCards,3bqy8m,Judeisobscure,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:17:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess that's the point, I just think it doesn't make for an interesting TV show.  Also, so many of the subplots in S3 seemed like just filler imo, or wasting some actor who is on contract for S3 and forcing them into episodes (Doug, Remmy Jackie Sharp).  S1/2 every subplot was interesting and critical to the storyline, S3 could be boiled down to Petrov subplot, and Heather Dunbar running against him subplot."
HouseOfCards,3bqy8m,Judeisobscure,4,Wed Jul 1 22:58:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear you. To be honest I didn't really care about the Remy/Jackie subplot at all. I liked Doug's though. The guy has issues. I thought his episode with Rachel was pretty cool and tense. Overall, though I think the season would have been better if it just focused on the conflict with Petrov and later Dunbar like you said. I think season 3 was just build up to season 4 though, like, laying the foundations. But yeah, I hope shit hits the fan soon too."
HouseOfCards,3bqy8m,HipsterMonk,0,Thu Jul 2 02:37:10 2015 UTC,"yeah, S4 could have great potential for sure."
HouseOfCards,3bqy8m,kuestenjung,6,Thu Jul 2 03:45:00 2015 UTC,this was the conversation I had with someone before:  IMO the entire third season standing on its own could be omitted and nearly nothing would be lost.   But maybe the fourth season requires a lot of pieces from the third. who knows at the point.
HouseOfCards,3bqy8m,razzeldazle,0,Sat Jul 4 18:09:32 2015 UTC,"makes sense, this whole producing for Netflix directly is still a new concept, so I will give them some leeway on S3, as long as they realize they made some big mistakes and move forward from there!"
HouseOfCards,3bqy8m,mokoko__,4,Sun Jul 5 01:46:50 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly dumbfounded that so many people have such a strong dislike for season 3. For me it was the most intense season yet.

HouseOfCards,3bcj95,Alexa-the-hexa,2,Sun Jun 28 09:47:20 2015 UTC,"But the fact that she directly addresses him as George Bush SENIOR would imply that their was a Junior. So perhaps the deviations n the timeline (at least in the office of the presidency) occur either right before George W. Bush takes office (which is why Janine would reference Bush Sr. As Sr. To alleviate confusion since George W. Would've still been a politician, just never The President) OR the timeline switches to right AFTER George W Bush was President but replaces Obama's first term with a no name Republican insignificant (the new administration won't even acknowledge said republican) and Garrett Walker's Democratic Administration would immediately follow that."

HouseOfCards,3axrl4,superegz,9,Wed Jun 24 10:22:02 2015 UTC,"For those of you who aren't Australian, a quick rundown of the key players in this documentary  Context: Australia's executive government is comprised of elected representatives who sit in legislative institutions. This means that the Prime Minister isn't directly elected, rather the Prime Minister is just the leader of the party that forms Government.  Kevin Rudd: 26th Prime Minister of Australia, later the 28th. Elected as leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) towards the end of 2006. Led the ALP in 2007 to a landslide victory where they defeated the long-serving Howard Government led by John Howard, leader of the Liberal Party (who form a coalition with the National Party [rural based conservatives] to form the Liberal National Party [LNP]). Extremely charismatic and media-savvy.  Julia Gillard: 27th Prime Minister of Australia. Served as deputy leader of the ALP under Kevin Rudd which meant she served as Deputy Prime Minister of Australia during the first Rudd Government. Became the 27th PM when she was chosen as the Labor leader in 2010. Later elected in her own right as PM in 2010. She led a hung parliament which meant that the ALP had to rely upon independent members and members of minor parties in order to form Government.  Bill Shorten: Current leader of the Labor Party which means he is the leader of the Opposition. During the 2007-2013 period all this wacky stuff was going down he was a key player in the ALP as a factional leader. He is what the media and the then opposition referred to as a 'faceless man' of the ALP i.e. factional leaders. Note that the ALP has very heavy ties to the Union Movement, so Bill Shorten being the former national secretary of the Australian Workers Union (AWU) was a big deal and gave him a lot of power in the ALP.  Tony Abbott: 29th Prime Minister of Australia. Not that he was directly involved in the behind-the-scenes stuff during this period of time, he was a very effective opposition leader in the way that he was able to convey the obvious disunity in the ALP to the public. Led by Abbott, the LNP had only just lost the 2010 election so they were out for blood. They campaigned very heavily on the issue of the Carbon Tax (a law which forced the top 400(?) polluters in Australia to pay a fixed price for each tonne of carbon they emitted into the atmosphere). This was one of the factors which caused wavering public support in the Gillard Government, effectively causing the factional leaders of the ALP to panic and install Rudd again."

And then Frank says something to her about how it seems nothing is enough for her now, and she responds saying that HE isn't enough.  So, it seems like the talk with the writer did have an impact on her, but this feeling of disparity has been brewing from the start. First she was uncomfortable being the one making all the sacrifices, then not being able to participate in decision-making and finally ""realizing"" that Frank is ""beneath"" her."
HouseOfCards,3aw3tn,cojonathan,23,Tue Jun 23 23:44:45 2015 UTC,Everyone is saying power but it's honestly the control of it. Power and control do go hand in hand but they are very different beasts. Power accomplishes and holds weight but control establishes and needs to answer no questions. The show is based around the idea of an exceptional sociopath who struggles with the last bit of humanity left and deciding what costs are associated with the control he seeks. With his power comes his responsibility which is why season 3 has a few scenes coming to you that at least imposes his second thoughts on a grander scale.   Simply put he desires what we all desire which is to have unmistakable purpose but with his life heading where it's come from his purpose has always needed to be proved to all whereas most people you meet only need purpose and foundation with the ones they love and love them back.  Hope this helps.

HouseOfCards,3aw3tn,ABrandNewAngel,4,Wed Jun 24 02:55:07 2015 UTC,"Copypasted my own answer from a very similar question:   To build a legacy. His plan is (or at least was, before it devolved into ""damage control"") to change America so much - for the better - that his public approval will outlive him. He wants to be a household name even centuries after his death, like Washington or Lincoln. However, the 22nd amendment limits him to 6 years in the Oval Office, which he doesn't view as nearly enough time. It's briefly mentioned at some point around S3E3 or S3E4 that the Underwoods are planning for Claire to use the United Nations ambassadorship as a stepping stone to run for the White House herself, whether it be in 2020, 2024, or even 2028. Frank would be able to work with Claire behind the scenes to build the legacy even more. After Claire served for eight years (hopefully), Frank would build up a protege (Jackie Sharp, maybe?) that would run for President and do his bidding, adding to Frank's legacy by proxy."

HouseOfCards,3arra6,ReptarDick,8,Mon Jun 22 23:54:18 2015 UTC,"Well, we know from the episode with the civil war re-enactment that he has no love for the Confederacy despite his Southern roots: he considers it an embarrassment that his ancestor fought for the losing side, so I can't see how he wouldn't denounce the continued use of the Confederate flag. Aside from that, he would give a speech about how violence is never the answer, how we're all made equally, and how we need to put prejudice behind us. I don't know if he would want to wade too heavily into the gun control debate, though. He has too much on his plate as it is."
HouseOfCards,3arra6,Maplekey,-2,Wed Jun 24 21:43:18 2015 UTC,"Never let a crisis go wasted. Frank would probably go to church in his home town or in Charleston and invoke God. Something along those lines. I doubt he would use this tragedy to repeal of the 2nd amendment. If anything, he would ask for a national gun registry number for each individual gun owner. That way he can grow his power in the guise of national security."
HouseOfCards,3ao5nz,Ziricom_Networks,13,Mon Jun 22 03:03:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with you! After I finished season 3 I began watching Daredevil (BTW great show if you haven't watched), and in the intro where they showed the Netflix logo they had the knock and I thought I was watching HOC again! And so I recognized it and if I'm not mistaken I think it was the exact knock where he ends the season after getting the ""promotion."""
HouseOfCards,3ao5nz,wfarighi,7,Mon Jun 22 05:03:48 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it wasn't. The knocks that come before every Netflix original show sound more like a drum hit rather than the sound Frank makes when he taps his knuckles on the desk.

It makes sense that they would introduce all of their originals with a sound bite that has some meaning to the company and viewers.   I started season 3 the day it came out and I recapped on seasons 1 and 2 about a week prior (no new intro while watching these episodes). To me, it seems as though they planned the new intro to be introduced with the roll out of HoC season 3."

HouseOfCards,3aa9jj,Crayboff,153,Thu Jun 18 14:09:32 2015 UTC,"There's a theory that HoC's season/episode structure has been following that of a deck of cards. So far we have had 3 seasons of 13 episodes each and in a deck of cards there are 4 suits of 13 cards each, so only 4 seasons would make sense.  There was also speculation that each season would be associated with a specific suit (I.e. the one associated with hearts would be about love while the one about spades would be about covering things up, if I remember correctly).  Plus with what happened in season 3, a lot of it seems to look like the house of cards is going to fall down spectacularly soon, as houses made of cards do.  So a confirmed season 5 is a pretty big deal in destroying that fun fan theory, unless the 5th season is only 2 episodes long which would match up with the two jokers found in card decks. It'd also be neat if they were in black and white to go with the weird joker theme."

Until House of Cards she was filming at least 2 movies a year. Spacey is a case of his own because he slowed down after the Oscars and was focused on theatre.

But if you don’t, by all means try something else that you find interesting to watch. We can’t really convince you to continue watching it other than by telling you that it’s a good show if you can sit tight and take it all in."
HouseOfCards,3acqw3,liflon,4,Fri Jun 19 01:38:52 2015 UTC,"The end of season 1 has a big payoff for watching the entire thing. There are many ""power plays"" in the show that shows off how certain characters can be badass.   But the appeal of the show is: A Hardcore Political Modern Drama (I would personally add Noir in there as well but that's me).  But primarily this is a Drama. No not like a Gray's Anatomy Drama but like a Soprano's Drama.  And Drama I mean the characters will mostly talk to move along the plot, story, characterization, etc.   The second part of is that its a ""political"" drama. That means its all about politics which actually most Drama's are about. In this case its government politics and the interpersonal politics that are needed to run government.   This show is not for everyone. Its not really a romance of any kind, though it does have relationships. If you don't like talking and/or have a hard time following along, its a not a show for you. Don't think badly upon yourself if you don't want to follow along, I certainly don't. There is no reason to learn about politics or follow politics if you aren't involved in politics.   But if you have any interest in politics...this is the show to watch. Not only politics of a government scale but on a personal scale about how people use each other and how they go about doing it. Frank Underwood, is the true American politician if you cut away at the fake smile and personality and chosen words all decided to impress voters. Frank is what smart politicians are really thinking and dreaming about, and some if not many actually do. Claire is ultimate example of the ""power wife"" of a power couple as well. Two people who are wholly pragmatic in achieving power and are willing to sacrifice a lot to do so.   But I know why you aren't interested in this wholly: you were 12 when the last election took place. You didn't even get to vote and probably other things were on your mind. Obama got reelected pretty decisively and Obama is pretty much all you ever known. In a year a new president is going be elected and you are going to be part of that decision. You are going to have to make a decision on what party you want to vote for, you are  going to have to look at a lot of issues and so forth.   To put it very blunty, Frank Underwood is a like an evil bill clinton. A Southern Democrat with lots of homey charm. And claire? Thats hillary clinton. Practically married to a man only for power despite disagreeing with him and losing love. Hillary is going to be a front runner in the next election.   You probably won't understand it now. But when you get into college you will start thinking about politics as college level ideas are introduced to you. House of Cards is a great intro course for that."

HouseOfCards,3a1k53,seandan317,18,Tue Jun 16 17:02:51 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I have 'skin in the game' as I've spent two years developing a feature film that has a lot of chess in it. So I've become super aware of how chess is portrayed on screen; From Kubrick a chess playing fiend who always set the board up perfectly and copied significant Grand Master games as a thrown bone to film going fellow chess enthusiasts to work out, All the way to lazy / unaware set dressers who just see Chess the metaphor for power and strategy and then flunk it by having the board set up all willy-nilly      So my reading of this one:  His Black knight has somehow ended up trapping itself at H8  ('knights on the rim is dim') with his Rook on B7 directly in front guarding what exactly I don't know.  But probably way more significant is the Black King - which should pretty much always be the very last piece you move (and then by Castling if you can). Somehow Frank has moved it well out from all its protection of pawns and minor / major pieces and plonked it up on H or G 4, 5 absolutely exposed from all sides with just the Black Queen for company  Now granted maybe it is an extended metaphor and that they represent Mrs and Mrs U being alone and under attack but in that case who's he metaphoring for? Us? Maybe , he does like breaking the old fourth wall so that could be it. Can't be for himself as he's playing against himself, so he knows the metaphoric his head  so he doesn't have to show it to himself.  Ah the madness of chess, if you ever want to read a brilliant little novella on how chess can mess with your mind I can't recommend enough The Royal Game by Stephan Zweig"
HouseOfCards,3a1k53,You-Can-Quote-Me,7,Tue Jun 16 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's not playing against himself or doesn't want Black to win? Perhaps he's playing while assuming the roles of other people, the moves he thinks they would make; whether against him or something else?"
HouseOfCards,3a1k53,You-Can-Quote-Me,10,Tue Jun 16 19:53:48 2015 UTC,"Interesting point, and I I'm only countering because I've spent so long immersed in the whole Chess culture world - A book called the Immortal Game is a fascinating history of chess and its use in politics and world cultures.   One of the points it makes is that great strategic leaders such as Napoleon tend to be okay but not particularly brilliant at chess - the thought being that ultimately they find its structure and rules too limiting for genuine on-the-fly tactical strokes. Whereas less leaders but more 'back room' string pullers are often much better players: Ben Franklin was absolutely besotted by it and bemoaned not being able to find anyone in the entire colonies worthy of playing him!"
HouseOfCards,3a1k53,DoctorHUN,4,Tue Jun 16 20:19:58 2015 UTC,"That's pretty interesting, cool, thanks for the tidbits.  It also makes sense, a lot of 'great' military leaders not liking it due to structure. War is rarely ever such an even contest/battleground."

BTW maybe he uses chess alone to portray his situation and what moves he might need to do to win the situation.

HouseOfCards,39uvw9,MutantTeddyBear,3,Mon Jun 15 12:50:54 2015 UTC,"The fact that they're focusing on the campaign in Texas of all places likely means Texas is going to hold some sort of significance in the 4th season. Why would they focus on the race there unless it was going to be a close race? It's a huge win for a democrat on the primaries, and would be huge for a dem in the general. Unfortunately we don't know for sure how much time will have lapsed when season 4 starts, so we won't know if Texas is going to be important in the primaries or the general election. I'd say it's the primaries but I could be wrong.   Also, now we know that Claire is from Texas. Could the campaign office possibly be tied to her in some way?"

Probably utilize Battleground Texas and Turning Texas Blue to garner a few votes."
HouseOfCards,39uvw9,Shappie,3,Mon Jun 15 15:43:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, winning Texas as a Democrat would be hard.

I think it boils down that too few would realize when the text makes no sense, so people don't care. For me it's everytime a show uses german. Breaking Bad went so far to research the uniforms of german police, translate every kind of label in the scene to make it seem like it plays in german. Yet when they start talking I don't even understand what they are trying to say. Sometimes it feels like they just put the script in google translate and go with whatever comes up without checking for grammar."

And I can tell it because it’s been explained not only in the last episode by Claire herself but also by Beau Willimon in some interview.   SPOILER OF THE LAST EPISODE!           Claire explains to Frank that when she was forced by the events to ask for his help to get the UN Ambassadorship she felt disgusted, she wasn’t being herself, her usual independent and powerful nature was devastated by being forced to be submitted to her husband’s power and will. She felt like throwing up. She started realizing that they’ve never been on the same level and that just disgusted her."

So, it would appear that Frank's opposition is portrayed by the lighter pieces while Frank is the darker pieces. This kind of sets up a Frank/Dark Side pairing.

HouseOfCards,39e7u6,motherfuckincunt,11,Thu Jun 11 03:45:34 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I doubt the show would still be a show...   Frank wanted to use his nomination as Secretary of State as a stepping stone to the presidency, probably choosing to run as vice president before trying for the oval office himself. This has been done in the past by Thomas Jefferson, and other presidents have done something similar, with only using the executive cabinet or vice presidency. This is why it is such a setback when he is passed over for the nomination (S1E1 shows his disappointment well). Years of careful planning and scheming went down the drain in an instant. He even lost funding from Remy's energy group [for the life of me I cannot remember its name], which forces Claire to cut her staff.  HoC's first season is about revenge and finding ways to take back the power Frank was supposed to have. I'm sure he would have been able to find some people to piss off and screw over, but he'd have little motive beyond the normal climb to power. And without that drive, we'd have very little to be entertained with, unless you like docu-dramas... which can be great but that isn't what makes HoC amazing."

I agree with everything you said, I finished it not 20 minutes ago and my only real complaint is the Jackie/Remy subplot- Remy's change of character just felt really tacked on, it wasn't built up at all, and then he was pulled over towards the end of the season and suddenly became a different person and quit politics altogether.  Also, I think the series will end with Frank making enough enemies and eventually being killed. My wildest fantasies include a season that doesn't directly reveal the killer, but lays out many possibilities and relies on repeat viewings to pick up the subtle clues and breadcrumbs, something that will be debated for a long time, almost like JFK's assassination in real life."

The problem people have with it is that it wasn't exciting or as interesting as before.   We saw a new side of Doug, but it wasn't as good as where the screen time went in the first two seasons. We see a new side of Frank, but it wasn't as good as his parts in the first two seasons. We see Claire's character take a big step, but it was below the average set by the first two seasons.   Everything comes down to it being worse than expectations.  They took the story in a direction, and it just wasn't as good.  It felt like a completely different show.  Every main character was on an edge and not behaving like we've come to expect.  Was it good?  It was worth the watch, but definitely not at the standard set by the show."

It isn't necessarily predictable, but is definitely headed towards a different direction compared to Season 1 and 2. I hope you'll find it just as enjoyable."

HouseOfCards,38fgug,avickthur,5,Thu Jun 4 04:24:25 2015 UTC,"Don't speak for all of us. I liked seeing frank struggle but the amount of time focused on dogue doing nothing really dragged the season down, IMO."

HouseOfCards,38fgug,ma582,4,Thu Jun 4 08:01:47 2015 UTC,"That, and they felt Claire having a crisis made her 'weak'. I feel she responded pretty reasonably, considering that she just realized that her life goals she's been working toward for 20-30 years have fallen apart and she's trapped in a marriage to a man whom she feels isn't helping her."
HouseOfCards,38fgug,Nichase,2,Thu Jun 4 03:06:30 2015 UTC,"Season 3 was the most disappointing for me with how it played out, especially considering that it's centered around Frank's presidency. It's like he finally gets there, but the story just isn't as captivating. Season 1>season 2> season 3, for me, in that order. Which sucks, because the build up to his presidency was so intense for me, and then it's just meh. However, it is obvious that, as President, Frank doesn't have the same political freedom he used to, but still. The only part I enjoyed was one part towards the end of the season. I think you'll know what I'm referring to when you get there. Pretty much everything else was just, eh? Except Petrov."
HouseOfCards,38fgug,GaberhamTostito,6,Thu Jun 4 01:25:21 2015 UTC,"For me, it was the supreme lack of a plan.   We have Frank scheming and plotting his entire adult life to get into the position of REAL power.... At which point he promptly starts shitting the bed.   I wanted to see Frank really start accomplishing stuff. For me, I can't get over the huge difference between Frank before getting the Presidency and afterwards. He had so discernable plan beyond America Works and that really wasn't barely mentioned enough."

HouseOfCards,38fgug,Llim,-1,Thu Jun 4 02:36:32 2015 UTC,Season 3 is my favorite. The only thing I don't like about it is that (mild spoiler) but Claire kind of becomes bitchy about halfway through the season
HouseOfCards,38htfv,centani,11,Thu Jun 4 08:45:32 2015 UTC,"I just finished doing the same thing an hour or two ago (the binge-watching, not the hardcore fucking).  If you remember in season 1, Frank tells Zoe (may she rest in peace) that:    Everything is about sex... except sex. Sex is about power.   My best guess is that this is Claire's way of getting Frank to admit that they are no longer equals (if they ever were). If he goes through with it, she at least knows where they stand. She challenges him (verbally) many times on this, and maybe this was simply another strategy.  If he does it without looking at her, he is saying he's powerful, as Frank suggested to Zoe. But if he does it while looking at her, it makes it more personal, and he's therefore saying that he's superior. I guess that's the main difference, in my eyes.  ...either that or he couldn't get it up due to sleep deprivation.  tl;dr Frank either needs a Viagra or a better reason to pork his wife than establishing power/superiority."

Well getting some sleep really did change my perspective of this. It's a great show, I don't know why people hate season 3 so much it's not that bad, we see some nice development and some major decisions the characters made."
HouseOfCards,38htfv,windkirby,2,Thu Jun 4 10:47:35 2015 UTC,"I think he has somehow weakened over the course of season three. Somehow, the two of them got this rift of inequality, and, separated from her, he was weakened. In this weakness he fostered more shame about how much he needed Claire, and he also got nicer (or weaker depending on how you look at things) as a result. After having her step down from the position of ambassador, he just couldn't face her."
HouseOfCards,38htfv,camabron,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:09:28 2015 UTC,"This may sound weird, but at first I thought he didn't want to do it beacause of how much he loves her, I didn't see fear in his eyes in that scene what I saw was sadness, I don't know if it's intended to be like that or not, but my first thought was that he couldn't do it beacause he didn't want to humiliate her like that."
HouseOfCards,38htfv,matttrick,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:52:23 2015 UTC,"He didn't do it because it reminded him of the General that raped his wife back in college and he didn't want to be that guy. Also, his wife wanted to ""relive"" the trauma for some dark psychological reason."

HouseOfCards,38gsnc,albigiu,2,Thu Jun 4 04:54:57 2015 UTC,"TL:DR Season 3 finale. Claire is upset on always being in Frank's shadow.  Here's the transcript of my favourite scene evah.  Frank: And what is wrong with asking for my help when you need it?  Claire: The fact that I need it. I hate that feeling. It's not me. I don't recognize myself when I look in the mirror. I do things... like I did in the hotel in Iowa.  Frank: I can't even talk with you about it. Instead you want me to slap you around like some animal. That's what we are when we strip everything away. That I can understand! It was deranged, begging me to take you like that. And you couldn't even give that to me. If you wanted a husband who proved his manhood to you that way, you should've stayed back in Dallas with your mother and married the prom king. At least I would've known where I stood. No, you can't have it both ways. You want an equal partner when it suits you? You want a man to take charge when it suits you? And I'm supposed to what, just divine when you want which? Stop being so selfish. You're better than that.  Claire: I'm not being selfish.  Frank: You are. We're in the middle of an election, and look at us.  Claire: That's exactly it. Look at us, Francis. We used to make each other stronger. At least I thought so, but that was a lie. We were making you stronger. And now I'm just weak and small, and I can't stand that feeling any longer.   Frank (Best Part IMO): All right. What do you want? What is the goddamn alternative? Please, Claire, tell me, because I don't understand. All I am hearing is, it's not enough. That the White House is not enough. That being First Lady is not enough. Not enough! No. It's you that's not enough. When we lose... because of you... there will be nothing. No plan. No future. We will only be has-beens. And you want to amount to something? Well, here is the brutal fucking truth. And you can hate me, you can be disgusted, you can feel whatever it is you wanna feel because frankly, I'm beyond caring. But without me, you are nothing. You're right. This office has one chair. And you have always known that from the very beginning. And if you now can't stomach that, well, then I'm a fool for having married you in the first place. But I don't have time to be a fool. I have to run this country and win a nomination. I'm doing my job. Doug is out there doing his job. And it's time now for you to do yours. You want me to take charge? Fine. I will take charge. You will get on that plane tomorrow. You will come to New Hampshire. You will smile and shake hands and kiss babies. And you will stand with me on a stage. And you will be the First Lady! And you do all that. I don't give a damn if you vomit on your own time."

I thought that would be an appropriate conclusion to the Underwood's outsized ambition, and the real storyline of  ""just becoming President and then failing and flailing"" is not nearly as epic and widescope as it seemed they were gonna become."

HouseOfCards,38fkhu,LordPak,2,Wed Jun 3 21:52:48 2015 UTC,"Remember when Frank realized something was ""off"" about Doug during the last few episodes of the last season? They had a chat and then Frank says something along the lines of ""I never give second (or third) chances, but I'm giving you one now.""  When Doug got badly injured, that was basically him ""using up"" the chance that Frank had given him. What Frank wants is a man that will do everything he needs, successfully and without error. Doug had messed up by not covering his tracks well enough when he went to the casino to track down Tusk and then to Beijing and a large part of this was due to his growing obsession and fall for Rachel.  Frank can't have that. He was elected President while Doug lay in recovery and during that time, he appointed Remy instead. Doug was completely out of commission for far too long and Frank can't be sure that Doug would ever be the man he needed him to be or the person that Doug was the first season and halfway through the second.  As for your other question, I'll have to bring up Frank and Doug's relationship, which is something I find very odd and rather interesting to talk about. (Also, I think you meant to say ""Doug"", not ""Frank."") Frank is not a very sociable person and it has been shown that he lacks ""deep bonds"" with most characters while being unafraid of using others for his own benefit. In this manner, I can argue that he can sort of see Doug in this manner, however, he definitely does care for Doug much more than he would most others. But he also can't let Doug become a liability which he believes is what the man is now. His own ex-Chief of Staff went out, got himself badly injured without explanation, and screwed up several times along the way. So by providing a job for Doug, it is Frank's way of ""letting him go"" as the job offer is still pretty damn good. Of course, that's not what Doug wants at all."

HouseOfCards,38fkhu,Zyphemis,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:23:33 2015 UTC,"Well, one can argue that Doug is Frank's most trusted ""henchmen"". Being out of commission for nearly half a year as well as not being there for Frank when he became President is a pretty big deal. Besides, while Chief of Staffs may not be as well known as the bosses they serve, they still have a pretty large name in the Hill and it's not good for Frank to immediately rehire an injured, unstable man especially when he became the president.  The job offering was simply his way of hoping to get Doug away from the entire picture."
HouseOfCards,38fkhu,TishkoAhmed,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:56:35 2015 UTC,"But it wasn't Frank that set up that job for Doug. It was seth, Doug exposed him at his home.

And if you don't know who Tenaka is, there's no reason you should know who Brad Petite is, or that he's ambitious or a good guy."
HouseOfCards,38fkhu,Zyphemis,2,Thu Jun 4 12:44:20 2015 UTC,"No, there was a scene afterwards between Seth and Frank where Frank asks if Doug took the job or not.

They really should have communicated better as to what was going to work for the both of them, but also interesting was the reveal this season that they need one another. They are actually weak in themselves. For some reason this struck me as odd.  But yes, people didn't like Claire's character change, and I think they also felt the plotting of the season was weak in general. Characters were introduced who didn't end up doing much, like the female reporter who slept with the author.

HouseOfCards,37uk2i,f0el0ix,27,Sat May 30 14:52:39 2015 UTC,"No way. One redditor said it best on a long-ago thread entertaining a similar possibility: are you saying that the first lady, who's been accused of having an extramarital affair, screwed up royally as UN ambassador, and has a whole bunch of disgruntled former employees that she fired at CWI in season one is going to run for president against her husband?  This theory would also require the republicans to nominate a woman who left her husband, has publicly admitted that she had an abortion years ago, and accused a prominent general of rape with the result that he was eventually forced to resign. If it happens, I'm done with this show.  No offense, OP, but I can't see this happening. ""First lady"" approval ratings and ""candidate"" approval ratings are two very different things. As soon as Claire became a candidate, she would've ceased to be a strong role model for women and become the caricature of the ""power-hungry b**** scrambling up the greasy pole"" that has been used to typecast female political candidates for a long time, to say nothing of those that stab their husbands in the back in the process.  Imagine how the country would have reacted if Hilary Clinton had run against her husband as a republican in '96. She had sterling approval ratings as first lady, her husband had been tussling with a Republican congress to little effect, but she also had a host of scandals and pseudo-scandals (e.g. Whitewater) that would've made it implausible. I see this as a similar situation."
HouseOfCards,37uk2i,FrankUnderwood0602,10,Sat May 30 15:02:07 2015 UTC,"I think it is going to be Tom's book that is going to cause the House of Cards to fall.    In fact, I buy the theory that everything we've seen so far is a retelling of that book, and in this final season (13 episodes x 4 seasons = 52 (a full pack of cards)) we're going to be brought up to date and get to watch it all crumble. This theory stems from a conversation that Tom and Frank have in Season 3 while drinking at The White House. Frank says something like ""the last time I got this drunk was at the citadel"" (a reference to an episode in the first season where Frank returns to his old military school to have a library opened in his name). Tom replies to this buy saying ""that can be called Chapter 8: The President Blows Chunks"".  They laugh and the conversation moves on, but the episode in question where Frank opens the library is, in fact, entitled Chapter 8. This theory also explains why Frank breaks the fourth wall by speaking to the camera and allowing us to know what he is thinking, much like the narrator/protagonist in a book.   I think that Tom obviously has a grudge against Frank after his draft for the book was dismissed and he was told not to continue writing. So, he is going to team up with Kate (and possibly even Ayla, Janine and maybe Lucas) to uncover some things that Frank has tried to cover up - Peter Russo, Roy Kepeniak, Zoe, (which Janine knows about) Frank's involvement with Tusk, Feng and Lanegan (which Ayla knows about), the SEAL who was killed in the Jordan valley (which Kate knows about), amongst other things like Claire's abortion, the Adam Galloway cover-up or Rachel's murder. After they uncover one or more of those things, the book is released, telling the whole story of everything we've seen so far. It becomes a massive best-seller and brings the media spotlight on Frank, causing internal investigations and allegations aplenty.    Now, for this to be a retelling and to sync up with the whole Chapter 8: The President Blows Chunks theory, there's a lot of things which we've seen so far that Tom, Janine, Ayla, Kate or Lucas just wouldn't know about or be able to prove. This is where Claire comes into it. At the end of Season 3 she finally has a moment of clarity. From the build up that they gave here decision over the last couple episodes of the season and how her relationship with Frank had deteriorated, it was obvious that this is not just something she is going to go back on. She is done with Frank. But, could she help take Frank down with her by feeding this information to them? She seemed to develop a connection with Tom over the course of Season 3, perhaps she double crosses Frank and provides them with information. The idea of Frank's legacy is brought up a lot throughout the first 3 seasons, and it is made clear that (since they have no kids) that is what they are doing all this for - Claire knows this and has the potential to ruin Frank's legacy that he values so much.   Honestly, I'm not really sure how the whole Claire and Frank story-line is going to play out. If there is going to be any chance of Frank winning in 2016 then I think Claire has to die fairly early on in Season 4. Perhaps Stamper takes her out, making it look like an assassination attempt (which there is a history of as we see in Season 2) or even suicide. There is no way a president who's current wife has openly walked out on him or who has got divorced while in office is going to be re-elected, it has never happened and probably never will - and I think for the show to have any real substance that can last the course of another 13 episode season, Frank has to get elected. Ipso facto; bye, bye Claire.    It's all just a theory and perhaps the whole ""Chapter 8"" thing is just a coincidence or even a red herring thrown in by the writers. There has been a lot of setup for what is going to happen in Season 4 (which is partly why Season 3 was a bit slow at times), so I'm hoping that it is not going to disappoint. However, it would be almost typical of this show for Frank to somehow get away with everything that he's done by using his power to defeat all his enemies and get to walk off into the sunset with his legacy intact - after all ""money is the big mansion in Saratoga that starts falling apart after ten years. Power is that old stone building that stands for centuries."""
HouseOfCards,37uk2i,DoubleGuns,3,Sun May 31 14:56:42 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed your theory. I am trying to think of what ending would best fit the series AND not be cliche. There have been a spate of notable shows with antiheroes lately (vague spoilers ahead if you are intuitive). Two of them did not kill/imprison the main character, and people hate the ending.  I have been wracking my brain trying to think of possibilities. Killing Claire does not seem outside of the realm of possibility. They could reconcile, but then where is the big finish?  Killing her to win leaves him accomplished but no one to share it with, which is sure tragic enough. I actually hope they do something off the wall that infuriates people, so long as it is true to the character."
HouseOfCards,37uk2i,matttrick,7,Mon Jun 1 01:42:15 2015 UTC,"There's no way the Republicans would turn their back on Mendoza and accept Claire Underwood: the adulterer, baby-killer, failed diplomat, and wife of the hated president Frank Underwood.  The most I could see is her going over to Dunbar's side, and even that's shaky.  There's no way she'd run or switch parties.  EDIT: I forgot that Mendoza left.  Thanks /u/TiberiCorneli!  I still don't think Claire would have a chance at beating whoever the Republicans put out in the primaries, because the party switch would be a massive flip-flop."

HouseOfCards,37g87b,elbruce,14,Wed May 27 17:02:16 2015 UTC,People have a wrong perception of the lifestyle of an actor.  95% of the industry makes just enough to get by.  He was only in a couple of episode of HoC and being a guest star on a TV series only pays several thousand dollars per ep.  After taxes and commissions that's not much to live on until your next acting gig.

HouseOfCards,37f4y9,SrN95,15,Wed May 27 04:15:57 2015 UTC,I'm still upset about the end of this arc.
HouseOfCards,37f4y9,DinosaurPizza,13,Wed May 27 05:31:40 2015 UTC,I'm upset only because if this was how they knew it would end they shouldn't have dragged it out for essentially the entire season for no perceivable reason.  You could argue they dragged it out for 3 seasons...
HouseOfCards,37f4y9,BadBoyFTW,10,Wed May 27 07:33:13 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Rachel was set up to be Frank's downfall. Frank's lack of humanity was what made him so impossible to get to, but his weakness was that he relied on Doug and Doug was human, that's why we liked Doug. That's why we liked the weird relationship he had with Rachel and why we felt bad for him and his conflicted feelings toward her. Even though he treated her like dirt and it's at best Stockholm syndrome, it's his outlet to be a human being outside of the world of cut throat politics.  Rachel was the one who could implicate Frank in the worst crimes he's committed. She was the person that reminded you that Lucas isn't dead, he's just in prison. Or that Gavin isn't dead, he's just out of the country. Or that Janine isn't dead she's just teaching now. All of these people could come back to fuck Frank over, but that all goes away if Rachel is dead.  So what was the fucking point? Of any of it? I'm convinced these writers didn't realize how stupid this conclusion was until they had to sit down and write season four."
HouseOfCards,37f4y9,DinosaurPizza,2,Wed May 27 08:09:16 2015 UTC,People get so caught up in how they think something should play out. There isn't always some magical reasoning behind everything. Sometimes things just end ugly.
HouseOfCards,37f4y9,matttrick,2,Wed May 27 13:30:41 2015 UTC,"She was too far removed - and those parties now completely uninterested - for her to be any threat. The third season was very uneven, but it set up that our boy Doug was not in his prime and certainly wasn't making the best choices. If he was going to be redeemed by Frank (again) and not just snuffed out like Peter Russo (who IS definitely dead), he can't take even the slightest risk, he can't take the slightest chance.  So we related to Doug and we definitely related to Rachel, both marching toward inevitability when it seemed that Doug was capable of empathy and let her go. But she would still be out there, still be that liability, the source that fed all other sources and Doug had spent two seasons (admittedly, a season too long) letting her exist because his empathy had introduced a blind spot, one that he couldn't have if he was going to be Chief of Staff.  So, bam, done, she's gone. Their arc was easily the best part of Season 3 and I'm glad they kept it in one episode at the end. Just made it more satisfying."
HouseOfCards,37f4y9,NtheLegend,0,Wed May 27 12:59:28 2015 UTC,"Obviously we need to wait and see how the end of the story plays out, but at the moment I think it could've been better if Doug had actually died at the end of season two and Rachel had disappeared. She was there from the start, and knows enough to implicate Frank. With Doug's death Frank would have no idea about Rachel's disappearance or absence, and it'd leave him vulnerable potentially without him even realising it.   Instead they spent three seasons showing us her story and the stories of the people around her (Gavin, Lisa, Lucas) only for her to be killed off in order to show that Doug is back and committed to the Underwoods. She was the key to implicating Frank and was central to a bunch of storylines, and I think they squandered her.  Frank being undone by Rachel works thematically because she was there all along, right from the first episode. It also works because it would've meant that Frank's downfall would've been partly down to his misplaced trust in Doug.  The story starts to lose tension if all the threats to Frank are easily dealt with. Zoe's dead, Lucas is in jail, Janine is too afraid to speak out, and now Rachel is dead too. Claire and Doug are the only ones left who know what he's done, and neither have any reason to speak out against him. There's no real threat of his murders being discovered anymore."
HouseOfCards,37f4y9,Candidate88766,1 point,Wed May 27 14:16:14 2015 UTC,I think the show is written so well.  So many story lines and so much suspense. Out of all the story lines Rachel's was the one I was most interested in.  I was upset when it ended the way it did.

When she glances up at the sidewalk camera... that's the shot that they have of her later.  Didn't see that until coming back to this now.  The mirage of her imperfect yet perfect day, and how even then, it's not perfect... she's been seen, she's been caught.  That last breath of morning sunshine on her face...  It mimics that heartbreaking episode about Dee in BSG when she's singing the song...that was playing at the 'cantina' where they had their dinner date.  I'd read about that episode, how she'd been singing a random song (the actress) so the sound guys put together a melody that matched it for the previous date scene so the overall effect is much like that HoC sequence.    :) nice post."

HouseOfCards,37bhii,RichB93,11,Tue May 26 18:51:22 2015 UTC,It's like trying to compare Adam West's Batman to The Dark Knight. They both served entirely different audiences for entirely different periods in history.  It's impossible to compare them.
HouseOfCards,37bhii,too_long_didnt_read,6,Tue May 26 22:29:31 2015 UTC,"I, so far, prefer the UK's version b/c of 7 words: It's short, sweet, and to the point. 3 seasons, 12 episodes total. So far, the US is retelling that story in a (confirmed) span of 4 seasons and 52 episodes. And, theoretically, if Frank wins re-election, the show (while I personally believe it won't come to this) could go on until 2020, or Season 8, b/c he would be kicked out in early 2021, which would be shown in the 2020 season (like the 2016 primaries being shown at the end of the 2015 season). That means it could be a story that can be wonderfully told in 3 seasons and 12 episodes will have been retold in 8 seasons and 104 episodes. That just ain't right."
HouseOfCards,37bhii,brucejoel99,1 point,Tue May 26 21:04:55 2015 UTC,I think if Underwood gets re-elected (which I think he will) we wont see the whole term. I think it will end at about season 6 and something will bring him down- of course we all know this the title of the show tells us there is going to be a fall after his rise to power. But he has done a lot of... unsavoury things that would get him kicked out of office and I imagine he will do worse things next season.
HouseOfCards,37bhii,MisterPinkman,2,Tue May 26 23:47:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, but in the end it depends on us. If...   We keep watching it  If Netflix wants more of it  If the writers want to write more of it  And if the actors want to keep acting...   then the show could go on for 8 seasons. I personally believe that of those 4 items, the only hindrance would be #3, as all TV writers become tired after a while, & subsequently, the quality will go down."
HouseOfCards,37bhii,brucejoel99,2,Tue May 26 23:51:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely, but that can be said for any show- Breaking Bad for example was one that ticked all 4 boxes (Interchange Netflix for AMC, and I assume the writers wanted to continue as they eventually made BCS- saying that they may have just wanted a new but familiar venture) but the writers knew when to stop- and I think that is key for a TV show to succeed."

For just about all characters (possibly other than FU which is something of a draw, I think that Richardson's Urquhart is brilliant, but so is Spacey's Underwood).  First season and a half they're similar, but there's a definite diversion in plot. I don't think we've gotten to the equivalent of BBC's season 3 yet if we will at all. I certainly doubt the same ending for reasons that I can't get into without giving spoilers.  I also very much like the role of Mrs. U being a bigger role in the American version. It gives an added dynamic for Underwood,"

HouseOfCards,37bhii,messengerofevil,7,Tue May 26 22:31:29 2015 UTC,Season 1=they were both great at setting up the characters only the six episodes per season were definetly a disadvantage so the american one wins  Season 2= the english one without a doubt the king was a great character and francis urquhart was at his most despicable noteworthy moments the abdicating of the king and how francis said that the king was now a nobody and how evil francis was to the gay guy and basically forcing him to resign (but the gay guy had the happiest ending in the entire hoc universe he left happy and had a partner  )  Season 3=the american one even though a lot of people said that the american season 3 was bad the english season 3 was worse the only good episode was the finale   So the american one is better imo

Previously he was Prime Minister of Poland from 2007 to 2014, having also been co-founder and chairman of the Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) party.   Tusk was officially designated as Prime Minister on 9 November 2007 and took office on 16 November. His cabinet won a vote of confidence in the Sejm on 24 November 2007. He was the longest serving Prime Minister of the Third Republic of Poland. In October 2011, Tusk's Civic Platform won a plurality of seats in the Polish parliamentary election, meaning that Tusk became the first Prime Minister to be re-elected since the fall of communism in Poland.   Tusk began his public career as an activist in his home town of Gdańsk, supporting Solidarity and organizing his fellow university students. With the exception of one four-year stretch, Tusk has served in the Third Republic parliament continuously since its first elections in 1991. He was Vice Marshal (deputy speaker) of the Senate from 1997 to 2001 and Vice Marshal of the Sejm from 2001 to 2005.

The term originally referred to a condition following acute brain damage (acquired prosopagnosia), but a congenital or developmental form of the disorder also exists, which may affect up to 2.5% of the population.  The specific brain area usually associated with prosopagnosia is the fusiform gyrus,  which activates specifically in response to faces. The functionality of the fusiform gyrus allows most people to recognize faces in more detail than they do similarly complex inanimate objects. For those with prosopagnosia, the new method for recognizing faces depends on the less-sensitive object recognition system. The right hemisphere fusiform gyrus is more often involved in familiar face recognition than the left. It remains unclear whether the fusiform gyrus is only specific for the recognition of human faces or if it is also involved in highly trained visual stimuli.

In t be US there's non of that ambiguity and there's no notional head above the president. You could see them sort of trying to do that with the Attorney General sort of claiming to represent the constitution which is sort of a higher power, but it's not the same. They really could have gone a lot further with fighting against the constitution, I feel.

HouseOfCards,371fdt,DinosaurPizza,81,Sun May 24 00:07:08 2015 UTC,"Back Channel: A method of doing diplomacy that is not known to the public. The president's schedule is known to the public in broad strokes, like if he's going to be in China for example. Walker talking to China by visiting China would be a normal channel of diplomacy. Frank sending Doug to speak to Feng in China on Frank's behalf is an example of ""back channeling.""  The Whip: Is a position in a political party that's supposed to convince members of the political party to vote with the party on particular issues. Why does this exist? There are some laws that can only be passed if 2/3s of congress agrees to them. If congress has 2/3s Democrats, then you would think all democrats would vote in favor of an issue that democrats agree with. But maybe there's ONE person, or ONE GROUP of people who decide they want to vote no because of XYZ. The Whip's job is to know who those people are and to convince those people otherwise. Frank did this by exchanging favors. He was the whip in Season 1. Jackie Sharp is the whip in season 2 and her approach is to tell people it's in their best interest to work with the party.  GOP Super PAC: Stands for ""Grand Old Party Super Political Action Committee.  Grand Old Party: Is a term for the Republican Party. This is the opposite party of Frank Underwood and Garrett Walker. Frank is a Democrat. There is a brief mention of ""the tea party"" in season 2, they are part of the Republican Party.  Super PAC: Political Action Committees are very confusing but basically it amounts to allowing corporations to send money to candidates that they want to run for office. This was previously illegal but was made legal under a ruling called Citizens United. This relates to Tusk because he is not a politician but he is a money man and he sends money to representatives. By being their funding (and having funding is intertwined with being elected) he has a lot of sway. Meaning if he says ""I need you to vote Yes/No on this or else you don't get my money"" then you can bet those representatives will do what he says.  Stacked Congress: If I remember correctly this is said in reference to Tusk and it's meant to imply that Tusk has ""stacked congress"" with people under his thumb. Meaning the majority of congress depends on Tusk's money so he has an incredible amount of sway on American politics.  Tusk's Connection to Feng is a major plot point of the season and will be revealed by the last episode. However, even after the last episode it's a little confusing but you should check back later and ask. Same with ""the casinos thing."""

That's what gives them the legal authority to raise as much money without campaign contribution or spending limits. Candidates get around this by making websites with really clear campaign points and rhetoric so that they can be copied easily. A Whip is part of Party Leadership in the Legislature. They are not an official part of the setup, as in they aren't in Constitution, and their job is to do exactly what you see Frank doing in S1, count votes and make sure everyone in the party is with the party line as espoused by the leadership, at least enough so that bills they want to pass will be passed or bills they want to block will be blocked."

Along with Doug, Jackie, the Underwoods and Meechum.   It's hard to place anyone suite to the seasons since they all involve a multitude of subjects.   I read the other thread where they thought S2 could be clubs because of the murders. I could find a plausible argument for S1 being the clubs since he got denied State secretary in the beginning and proceeded to destroy everything in his path until he ended up as the VP.

HouseOfCards,36wo04,rchaseio,2,Tue May 26 01:06:36 2015 UTC,"That is simply not true.  13 was pretty usual for cable shows in the late 90s and 2000s, but network shows in the US have usually had somewhere between 20-30 for prime time.  In the 60s it was higher, but has a been slowly decreasing in the last 10 years to about 22-24.  Look up any older show on IMDB or wikipedia.

HouseOfCards,36vyag,okwowok,14,Fri May 22 15:36:03 2015 UTC,"Well the old lady yells at her and then she sees kids making out. We know something that's important to Claire is legacy so when the OLD lady yells at her for running on top of a bunch of nameless dead people she was unsettled about whether she'd be important after she dies. Then she sees the YOUNG people being just as ""disrespectful"" as she was and she realizes she still has time to leave a mark. This is explored more with all the physical legacy (a child) vs. a historical legacy (power/name) stuff in seasons 2 and 3."
HouseOfCards,36vyag,windkirby,3,Fri May 22 17:34:17 2015 UTC,"WORST's explanation is really good. For me, the scenes were about power and taking things regardless of others. Claire runs to stay fit, and when the woman yells at her, it jolts her--is she a terrible person for exercising where dead people are trying to rest in peace?  When she sees the young couple making out, she is reassured. Disrespecting the dead is a twisted but vital part of the circle of life. The fit can't waste time catering to the weak.  This sentiment is also reflected when she sees the old cashier having trouble after firing the woman from her clean water initiative. The young person, much better with technology, has to come to the aid of the totally inept older person. Claire is pleased to see her choice to cut off obsolete people in favor of effectuality is indicated.  I'm not saying this is the moral thing of course--such disrespect and cruelty could be thought of as emotional murder. But it's a part of life and it's a part of House of Cards."
HouseOfCards,36vyag,whatsnewpussykat,8,Sun May 24 03:15:43 2015 UTC,I had completely different reaction to the cashier scene. I saw it as Clare feeling even guiltier for letting her staff go knowing that they would have so much trouble in the job market.

HouseOfCards,36vyag,whatsnewpussykat,3,Sun May 24 19:50:16 2015 UTC,"I've always read Clare as a willing participant in Team Underwood, but that she struggles with the darker deeds necessary to perpetuate their goals. She does not have the bulletproof veneer Frank's developed - we see this when she's shaken the old lady shouting at her in the cemetery, when she's desperate for the grant to save her staff, revealing the truth about her assault in the interview and again with Petrov and Corrigan. If you see her like this, her increased desperation and erratic behavior as more of her goals are cast aside in favour of Frank's ""greater good"" makes for a very satisfying character arc. I find her compelling."

My father was in the Navy when I was growing up, he went for 20 years, a good friend of his got out after 4 and enter the Secret Service, ended up on the White House detail, primarily protecting the President and first lady whom at that time were the Clintons.  Few years after that (about halfway through the Bush years) he left the detail, settled into a desk job.  One day he comes to a BBQ that we were hosting, gets a little too drunk, my Dad asks him if he has any interesting stories about the white house.  He says, one night when protecting the Clintons, he starts his shift late, first lady's already in bed, President is out of the country, takes over the shift from the previous agent.  Everything seems normal, first lady's in her bedroom.  About an hour later they hear screaming coming from the bedroom.  They burst in to find the first lady in bed, and another woman between her legs.  They quietly leave, close the door, and as always are never supposed to talk about it.  I don't know if its true, after he sobered up he refused to ever talk about it again, but it came from a source I trust even if he was drunk.  Ever since that day I remain convinced, because of the way he told it and the fact he won't even engage in conversation about it, that its likely true and explains a lot about the Clintons.  It would not surprise me in the least if the marriage was completely political and both their sexualities were flexible."

Making Frank the VP killed two big birds with one stone  One of my favorite episodes of season 1 was when Frank has to go back to his district to deal with petty local politics that, in a nutshell, is beneath him but still threatens his seat of power in a serious way. I'd think becoming a senator would be an enourmous step up simply for being freed from having to deal with that sort of nonsense"
HouseOfCards,366gk7,Gonzzzo,15,Sat May 16 23:08:16 2015 UTC,"Nah, Frank orchestrated the VP thing specifically to take over as president after he ruined the Pres.

Most times he described the move in private to friends he said versions of ""It was like getting my balls cut off.""  He actually tried to hold on to the Democratic Caucus Chair as VP, but the Senate laughed him out of the meeting where he had it proposed for it would have been a tremendous violation of the seperation between the Executive Branch and Legislative Branch."

For all Frank's skill and cunning, it would be very, very difficult for him to be elected statewide as governor or senator.

Underwood was in a very good position politically in season 1; as Majority Whip he was in the leadership and he could have represented the 5th Congressional District for life if he wanted to (in 2010, when Republican State Senator Mick Mulvaney defeated 14-term incumbent Democrat John Spratt in the 5th as part of the ""Republican Wave"", he became the first Republican to win the district since Reconstruction).

HouseOfCards,366gk7,svines,3,Sun May 17 02:59:48 2015 UTC,"The senate is a fast path to presidency.  Presidents typically come from one of two sources, State Governors and US Senate.  Eisenhower was the last US President not to be a Governor or Senator.  I think what many people confuse with politics is where power comes from.  They look at either big money or front facing offices like the president or governor, but the true players are behind the scene.  It makes perfect sense for Frank to sit in the House, he can build experience, learn Washington, build allies, establish a long term ground game, and build a meaningful image for himself.  Remember Frank is building a legacy.  He has much more time to work from the House than a president or governors seat."

I don't really care I just want to explain to you that it's kind of a rude thing to say.   Even if he isn't a virtuoso player it's still pretty impressive that he wrote that piece."

HouseOfCards,35vns4,Kahaq,3,Thu May 14 04:37:24 2015 UTC,"Constitutional experts are split on whether that's true. The intent of the 22nd Amendment was clearly to prevent someone from serving more than two full terms (or 2.5 terms in extreme circumstances). So I think that SCOTUS could very well rule that a former 2 term President could not be included in the line of succession, even though the Constitution doesn't explicitly prohibit it.  Not that the issue is likely to ever come up. There's very little chance a former President would want to serve as VP, and a Presidential nominee wouldn't want to appear to be skirting the Constitution. So SCOTUS will never rule on the issue."

The character development over the course of the show in particular is brilliant, my favourite character seem to change with every episode once you get into the show.     For me it definitely gets better and better. I'd say that the peak of the show is towards the end of Season 2. Season 3 is still good, but there's a lot of setup to things which I'm assuming will be the main plot-lines of Season 4 (coming early next year). It's definitely worth sticking with.  I'm partway through Season 2 doing a complete re-watch of the entire show. If you do like it and continue through the entire series, I would recommend going back to watch it again at some point. I wish I could go back now and watch certain moments for the first time again, but for me it's been so much better the second time around. It's a lot easier to follow and you can really just appreciate the brilliance of the show. The first time I watched it, at times I wasn't exactly sure what was going on in some plot lines, or why certain political battles where going on and what was being fought over (especially in the first half of Season 2) but once you have a better of understanding of things it's so much more enjoyable.    I'd also say don't frequent this place too much until you're caught up. Spoiler tags are not always used where they should be, particularly within threads, I had a couple of things spoiled for me but nothing major. Even now, a couple of the posts on the front of this sub are major spoilers if you're just starting to watch, so don't look there if you can avoid it. But, the chapter discussions on the sidebar can be great, they really help when there's an episode where there's a lot of things going on or it's a little hard to follow. There's a few really good fan theories I've found on here about the major plot-lines and what could be to come. Also, try not to read ahead on the Netflix episode summaries as you click on the next episode. I got a glimpse of one summary by accident as I was selecting an episode which gave away a massive spoiler in the first couple of words of the summary.  Also (as someone from the UK) researching the different, unfamiliar US political terminologies that I was unfamiliar with has made it so much more enjoyable to watch. I wasn't sure what certain job titles or positions within the lower levels of the US government actually meant or what people in particular positionis had to do, or the powers that they possessed within the government. You're probably more versed than me in US politics, which isn't hard. But, if you really want to enjoy it, a great bit of advice would be to research the things you don't understand as soon as they come up. I won't spoil anything but things get a bit more complicated politically as the show goes on and there's a lot of setup that you need to understand properly to get the pay-off as the show progresses.    I'd also recommend this podcast I found which has a discussion for each episode. They're only usually about 20-25 minutes long, but they really help consolidate each episode to make sure that you're on track with everything that's happening and offer good discussions about the key characters. They also offer an unbiased and honest review of the episode, and call the show out on anything that's unrealistic within the show, which is great because it's usually things that I didn't pick-up originally. It really helped the second time around to make it an even better experience.    I don't think this show is going to pull a ""Lost"" on you at all, you'll still be hooked after Season 3, and counting down til the next season arrives like the rest of us."

She targeted governments and organizations as well as individual females, as she opined that the issues facing women and girls are often either ignored or ""silenced"" and thus go unresolved. Elements brought up in the speech include dowry deaths and China's one-child policy. Clinton declared that ""that it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights"". Delegates from over 180 countries heard her say: ""If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all."" In making the speech, Clinton defied both internal administration pressure and external Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.The speech is considered to be influential in the women's rights movement and in 2013 Clinton led a review of how women's rights have changed since her 1995 speech."

HouseOfCards,35mq33,swedishfished,3,Wed May 13 01:09:05 2015 UTC,"Let me first agree whole-heartedly with your opinion on the overall quality of analysis. There are many commenters who cannot even spell the main female protagonist's first name right!!  However, this is not something peculiar to /r/HouseOfCards. Analyses and recaps of TV episodes elsewhere on the Internet, even on professional outlets, by people who actually do this for living, have been wrong and inaccurate, sometimes to the point when I wonder if we watched the same show.  And for example the /r/gameofthrones sub comment quality is not great, even though the show airs in weekly chunks.  This is not even limited to modern TV, but goes all the way back to printed stories, and probably further back than that. — See this story about AC Doyle getting harassed for having killed off Sherlock Holmes.  My personal opinion is that the crossection of people who care deeply enough about a literary work to get emotionally involved, and still have time to devote to expressing their involvement in public, tend not to be the sharpest tools in the box, but I digress.  The practical solution, for me, is to accept that the hardcore fans will watch the thing the first opportunity they get, and write about it while watching it, or shortly after. When it comes to the more casual viewer, there are always alternative sorting algorithms."
HouseOfCards,35mq33,rdancer,0,Mon May 11 20:34:32 2015 UTC,You're right. This probably isn't just limited to House of Cards. Plus it's the only show I've watched on Netflix so I have nothing to compare it to. I also don't watch Game of Thrones. I suppose I shouldn't expect quality discussion for really anything on an Internet forum simply because of how they need to work.
HouseOfCards,35mq33,Vermilion,0,Mon May 11 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"First off, spelling is an overrated metric of understanding things.  There are some highly intelligent people I know personally who can not read or write.  There are also genetic reasons people can not spell, it isn't the simplistic indication of effort that people make it out to be.  That said, the issue I am haring is people's level of listening and thought.  I think a lot of people are consuming and reviewing it like a fast-food meal - and it isn't just about the time spent waiting between episodes, it's the general amount of personal associate you make with the story.   Not the actors, the costumes, the voices, the lighting, but the actual story and being the character your self.   This is not even limited to modern TV, but goes all the way back to printed stories, and probably further back than that.    Sure, it was noted way back. I consider Plato's Allegory of the Cave as a criticism of people's ability to relate deeply to each other.  Joseph Campbell spent a lifetime trying to get people to recognize that Mythologies all say we come from the same biological grounds - and can be translated (just like English or Japanese spoken languages).

The whole of a US TV show will always be lesser than the sum of its parts; it will have great props, likable characters, tantalizing storylines, memorable catchphrases, some remarkable fan service, but if you want deeper meaning, this is simply the wrong medium. Go read a book.  P.S.: There was this lorry driver I knew in London, who would call people whose name he couldn't remember  ""John"". Now, he was highly intelligent, and lived an interesting life. He also didn't care very much about those people."

Now, he was highly intelligent, and lived an interesting life. He also didn't care very much about those people.   I really don't get the point. A driver is, by nature, a traveler.  Why is being honest that you are being bad with names, open to everyone and obvious, meaning you don't care about people?  I think it shows more what you see than what the driver does.  How carefully he drives on the public roads probably can tell more about how he cares about other people."

HouseOfCards,35ejdd,HeiBK,35,Sat May 9 17:42:39 2015 UTC,No doubt that if you love political shows the West Wing is top notch. But they are very different. I think the West Wing has an inherently positive view of government and the work they do while House of Cards is more cynical.

Or it could be used to say that evil is doing acts just to harm others, that isn't Franks view. He wants power yes, but he doesn't harm people unless it helps him, if helping someone is beneficial to him, he can do that too.   I would call Frank a true neutral, he does anything to help himself and doesn't care what but he doesn't intentionally cause harm unless it helps himself   Walt could be seen the same way as could Gus, but Tuco for instance could not"

HouseOfCards,358799,najlepsza,19,Thu May 7 22:32:35 2015 UTC,"I took it as the lady talking about how she has this baby and of course she would never ever do anything to get rid of it/kill it because that'd be terrible, but she wants too. Then Claire decides her marriage is the baby, but she's going to do the unthinkable and kill it."
HouseOfCards,358799,CunningLinguistt,16,Fri May 8 00:19:26 2015 UTC,"You're right. The scene planted the idea in Claire's mind that she was just like that women, trapped, and unhappy, and that her life would be so much better if she took drastic action."
HouseOfCards,358799,availableoregon,2,Fri May 8 15:53:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's more to highlight that the woman is tethered to her relationship by the child, while Claire has nothing holding her if she really wanted to leave. So it's a moment of realization that she is not trapped."
HouseOfCards,358799,Ovuus,11,Mon May 18 15:52:35 2015 UTC,"I viewed that scene as an extended metaphor continuing from the author's first chapter. In the chapter he wrote something about how Frank and Claire had no children, but their legacy was their ""child"". So in a way it was Claire realizing that if she wanted to leave Frank she would have to kill their child, their legacy."

HouseOfCards,358799,TheMightyFloorp,-6,Tue May 12 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"She talked about how she sometimes thinks about killing the baby, IIRC. And Frank & Claire allegedly had a baby years before that they killed because it would get in the way of Frank's career."
HouseOfCards,358799,willshmo258,4,Thu May 7 22:43:14 2015 UTC,"Ohh...I thought she had an abortion, or are you saying she had an actual born baby that they killed?"
HouseOfCards,358799,TheMightyFloorp,6,Thu May 7 23:21:30 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, no she has not given birth. She has had 4 abortions, all to keep focus Frank's career, but 4 nonetheless"
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,Gergs,185,Tue May 5 15:08:31 2015 UTC,"After Frank turned on Jackie, I felt like someone punched me in the stomach. Very good scene."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,the_onetwo,84,Tue May 5 16:54:25 2015 UTC,"I may have yelled at the screen.  ""WHAT ARE YOU THINKING FRANK?!""  It makes sense a bit more when you think about it. I really do think that Frank was going to offer her VP, and so her reputation isn't terribly important to him...but if I were Jackie I wouldn't think he was going to ask me anymore."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,mrcelophane,19,Tue May 5 17:23:19 2015 UTC,"...but if I were Jackie      and there's the rub.  we know that Frank is definitely keeping her on the short list, but she's been around Frank long enough to know that he could&would drop her in a heartbeat if he found it advantageous."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,fairly_quiet,29,Tue May 5 22:40:25 2015 UTC,I agree with what he said to her. He has to appear as her opponent while still running against each other.
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,MarixD,4,Tue May 5 20:57:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know. It was a dumb move on Frank's part, and Frank's not dumb, but it became a theme. Frank plays the master manipulator to get everyone on his side, then lashes out, treats them like shit, and surprise surprise, they turn on him.   Don't get me wrong, I hate Frank and want him to fail hard, but it just didn't make sense. Frank's too smart to think he can just bully and brow beat everyone into submission, even if he is President."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,TooSunny,5,Wed May 6 12:34:42 2015 UTC,"The point was that this allowed Frank to seem presidential, keeping the kids out of it, while STILL delivering the punch to dunbar through Jackie. so he basically took out dunbar while showing how he was above ""the new dogs"""
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,swedishfished,2,Fri May 8 18:52:25 2015 UTC,"i think this a mark of a turning point for frank. someone said season 3 is a transition from ruthless pragmatism to him just being plain ruthless. He's tightening his grip too much and the sands starting to fall through, or some other appropriate analogy. he's at the top now and his system has so many moving parts and variables, the stakes are so high that he's beginning to just fear people into doing what he needs right then and there instead of thinking about the consequences."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,lazrbeam,87,Sat May 30 23:35:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't blame Jackie for turning on him afterward. He completely threw her under the bus, and she had no way to redeem herself. They both had Dunbar in the crossfire, and everything was going perfectly."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,SackOfHellNo,65,Tue May 5 17:06:00 2015 UTC,"I wish Jackie would have seen that play coming though! Her character seems smarter than that. Never, ever attack an opponent for the exact same thing you're doing without a way to spin it..."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,lady_stone,48,Tue May 5 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"Except she had a way to spin it. All she had to say was ""I just recently remarried and I don't think I am or ever will be in a position to dictate where the children that I didn't concieve go to school"" or something to this extent."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,Draki1903,19,Tue May 5 19:45:12 2015 UTC,Yeah she didn't think on her feet there.
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,Bigfluffyltail,12,Tue May 5 20:48:22 2015 UTC,"The point is that Jackie is more human than Frank. As much as she probably likes Remy better, it seems like she indeed cared about the kids."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,Theutates,4,Wed May 6 05:26:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. That comes off as ""they're not my kids"", which really forfeits the enitre political benefit of marrying a father in the first place.   It was a stupid attack, given her stepkids, but if she did it, her best hope was to turn it back to the relative wealth issue. ""Yes, and we made sacrifices to afford private schools. What did you give up for your kids? That eighth mansion?"""
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,SilasX,1 point,Sat May 16 17:13:00 2015 UTC,Yup! That would've made him look like the fool.
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,wexiidexii,27,Fri May 8 16:52:52 2015 UTC,"She should have been better prepared for that. You're right. Frank should have helped her think through another strategy for that. But unfortunately, he wasn't as calculating as normal. Old Frank would have been a little more clever than that."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,SackOfHellNo,13,Tue May 5 17:29:44 2015 UTC,I think he was calculating there as well. Him being the one to deliver the punch probably helped him more in the polls then letting someone else swing the sucker punch.
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,mrcelophane,3,Tue May 5 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"That was so painful to watch. When she stated her concern of looking like a hypocrite bc of the private school thing, I thought ""ask Frank what to say if it comes up!"" And then... Yea. Felt so bad for Jackie. I really like her."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,AnorexicManatee,1 point,Wed May 6 14:49:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was facepalming there.   ""Is that really what you're worried about? Looking like a hypocrite?""  'Yes ...?'"
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,SilasX,1 point,Sat May 16 17:14:33 2015 UTC,"and she had no way to redeem herself.   not right then at that moment.  but real life has shown us that what is said in debates stays in debates.  hillary clinton walked back all the shit that she had talked on obama when it was time for her to be appointed as Secretary of State.  some people still try to hold her feet to the fire but she just brushes them off.  i picture Frank as thinking like the clintons... fuck 'em if they talk shit, i got elections to win."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,fairly_quiet,30,Tue May 5 22:42:36 2015 UTC,"Good writing and brilliant,y filmed as well. Also the performances: wow! The actors truly are top notch. And did they use different kinds of cameras to shoot the debate? It felt  TV-like and very real. One of the highlights of the season along with Petrov's scenes."

HouseOfCards,34y4zp,rphillip,1 point,Tue May 5 20:21:32 2015 UTC,I was really into it. Fucking House of Cards wizardry.
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,aprofondir,29,Sun May 31 13:08:34 2015 UTC,That scene was cringeworthy. Very well done in that aspect. But I felt that was completely un-Jackie like. It was almost juvenile or intermediate how she went after Dunbar. That has never seemed like Jackie.
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,theTXpanda,15,Tue May 5 21:09:47 2015 UTC,She addressed those issues when to talking to Frank privately. That's even when she gave him the ammunition to use against herself.
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,HardCorey23,-1,Wed May 6 00:01:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Jackie from season 2 would've never done that. She was way too smart. Unless she was just blinded by potential and impending power. But even then..."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,theTXpanda,9,Wed May 6 01:31:38 2015 UTC,Reminded me of the Vinnick-Santos debate from TWW.   I think people generally hate that episode but I loved it.
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,jinku2608,2,Tue May 5 17:26:45 2015 UTC,The best part of the season. Hopefully there's more of this in Season 4.
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,biglineman,2,Wed May 6 12:40:16 2015 UTC,One of my favorite scenes from Season 3. I loved how the dynamics kept shifting. Brilliantly filmed!
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,Grady_Tripp,2,Wed May 6 12:41:22 2015 UTC,"For me, it wasn't the debate itself, which looked normal, but the subtext. It has a different meaning once you know all the scheming that went on behind it."
HouseOfCards,34y4zp,SilasX,2,Sat May 16 17:15:59 2015 UTC,"The writing itself was great, I just wish they didn't use something SO played out like the wage gap. I suppose there isn't much else they could really do though."

HouseOfCards,34zxkp,arwMommy,8,Wed May 6 18:50:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure of the episode, but there is a scene where Frank is in his office speaking with the Supreme Court Justice (you know, the one with Alzheimer's) and when the conversation isn't going his way he starts pacing, breaks the fourth wall,  and says Something withering to camera. Jacobs - who appears to have overheard Frank says 'what?' and Frank, seemingly caught out, changes the subject. I'm pretty sure that's the one and only time that has happened. It's interesting as when Frank breaks the fourth wall you get a sense that he has some kind of omniscience because he is directly addressing the viewer, in this scene though he is just made to look like a bumbling madman, pacing around and talking to himself."
HouseOfCards,34zxkp,arwMommy,2,Wed May 6 09:04:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that'll be worth looking for. I remember that, thinking it was unique in doing so."

HouseOfCards,34zxkp,tfc324,4,Thu May 7 14:56:07 2015 UTC,It's half way through season 3 I believe when Dunbar threatens Frank by saying she has her journal. Frank then looks at us and says something like 'she can come after me all she likes but if she goes after Claire I'll slit her fucking throat in broad daylight'. One of my favorites.

HouseOfCards,34zxkp,nv_ertigo,1 point,Thu May 7 07:33:18 2015 UTC,"when he says this, it has me wondering about frank as a person quite a bit. he says this as if he truly cares for claire above himself, but then at the end of season 3, he accuses claire of being selfish and basically indicates that he no longer cares for her. did his feelings changes that fast? did he ever really care for her? or is it more of a thing where he views claire as a possession or tool?"

HouseOfCards,34zkh9,dhisum_dhisum,16,Tue May 5 21:31:55 2015 UTC,"I think part of why the show works is because Frank is so incredibly overt with his manipulation of others. It helps that he can break the fourth wall and tell us as well.  However, I think people would see Frank for what he is pretty quickly. He often gives people these ultimatums without them noticing, but in real life most people intelligent enough to be his peers would catch on with the quickness.   People even point it out in the show. I guess people do begin to catch on later, but in real life I think people would've figured out his plan a lot quicker. A lot of people too, not just Linda."
HouseOfCards,34zkh9,KidCasey,3,Tue May 5 23:20:03 2015 UTC,That's a very fair point. People would join the dots quick and his sinister planning might fall flat in real life.
HouseOfCards,34zkh9,jason_in_sd,5,Tue May 5 23:25:33 2015 UTC,And Donald Blythe. He wasnt having any of Frank's manipulation before the anthrax scare

HouseOfCards,34zkh9,Maplekey,5,Thu May 14 22:22:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think Frank Underwood would be stopped in his tracks at the Vice Presidency.  ((SPOILERS AHEAD))  Frank pretty much ran Walker's Presidency from behind the scene and he also ran it into the ground.  Making backroom deals, etc.  However, in real life the Vice Presidency only has as much power as The President gives it.  The show does show us that Walker is a weak man.  However, that's another fault that I find with the second season TBH.  Any person who becomes POTUS is not weak, I'm sorry he's just not.    Also, if you looked at some of our real life Veeps in the past, you'll notice that they're not exactly of Frank Underwood quality.  So I doubt Frank would even get the Veep position in real life."
HouseOfCards,34zkh9,anyhistoricalfigure,4,Thu May 7 05:35:49 2015 UTC,"Any person who becomes POTUS is not weak   I think it's implied that Raymond Tusk largely cleared the way for Walker to become President by taking care of most of the dirty & underhanded stuff. Walker isn't weak, just naive and sheltered."
HouseOfCards,34zkh9,aprofondir,3,Thu May 7 20:13:43 2015 UTC,I'd argue that Tusk picked him because he was weak and sheltered. It let Tusk manipulate him into doing whatever he wanted Walker to do.

HouseOfCards,34pyrw,Gonzzzo,2,Mon May 4 20:24:41 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, the writers just took Fisk in a totally different direction than what I (and a lot of Marvel fans) was/were expecting. I thought D'onofrio did a great job with the Kingpin he was given to play, but the idea of Kingpin being this shy, sensitive guy who's a perpetual 13-year-old is totally new & fairly radical (I actually really liked the way Kingpin was written)  Fat Kevin Spacey would have the ""regal vs. rageful"" aspect of the character nailed...lol all I'm saying is that in a perfect world the kingpin would be exactly how I want him to be, with Fat Kevin Spacey playing the part (Kinda just wanna see what Spacey would look like if he gained a lot of weight & shaved his head for that role...I just imagine him looking & sounding exactly the way I picture the kingpin in my mind)"

HouseOfCards,346zwp,JeddHampton,4,Wed Apr 29 09:10:10 2015 UTC,"It is a really good series.  It is a dark and gritty vigilante story with great fight scenes.  The guy behind the fight scenes in Spartacus is the same guy here.  The story isn't anything amazing, but it is good.  The flaws stem from it having to set up a new slice of the Marvel Cinematic Universe where AKA Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist will all take place.  It laid a good foundation.  It is a great telling of the Daredevil story.  At first, I was bummed that Fisk wasn't yet the Kingpin, but seeing him becoming the Kingpin is something I've never gotten to experience.  I don't know if there is a comic out there that explores this, but it is a good, new look for him.  The sets are dark at gritty.  It's a give and take thing.  It adds to the atmosphere, but it can make things difficult to see at times.  They handled it well.  The cast is what really shines in each episode.  The characters are great.  Every character's personality shines through, and it is a wonderful mix.  Foggy was the character that really grew throughout the show.  He went from the ""avacados"" guy in the flashback to the guy who has to accept that the world (and law) around him is fundamentally broken.  I don't know what your price point for content is, but if you know anyone with Netflix, watch the first two episodes and decide if it is worth it for you."

Hence to him, killing him seemed justified.   If you think Frank's run for Presidency as a war, Russo presents himself as an opposing soldier, given the circumstances and his inability to handle himself. So in the cold, black and white world of Francis Underwood, yes the killing was justified.  Its a similar logic to the one applied by any militant to kill an innocent civilian.

HouseOfCards,33s978,fairly_quiet,31,Sat Apr 25 15:11:59 2015 UTC,"It's to highlight the main distinction between their characters, I personally believe.  They're both ruthless, check. They're both very intelligent, check. They both know how to manipulate people and ruin them if need be, check. With all this in common, Doug needs a literary reason to be subservient to Frank. Why would a man of such equal skill, networks, and determination be so happily as undying a loyal servant instead of fighting for himself? The answer is that Doug prefers to work in a small-scale method while Frank is much more big picture. Chess is a game of strategy, of anticipating multiple moves ahead, and managing multiple individual pieces. Frank is adept at this work while Doug does not seek it out and remains one of Frank's chess pieces. The best reason I can give for why is just simply different personalities."

I think its a red herring and something bigger will happen to force them back together, my money is on Tom trying to finish his book and going back to interview the players from seasons 1 + 2. Kate will continue to piece together the current events and they will put both of their findings together probably in the book.

Isaiah 14:12 of article  Lucifer:       In ancient Canaanite mythology, the morning star is pictured as a god, Attar, who attempted to occupy the throne of Ba'al and, finding he was unable to do so, descended and ruled the underworld.   The original myth may have been about a lesser god Helel trying to dethrone the Canaanite high god El who lived on a mountain to the north.   Hermann Gunkel's reconstruction of the myth told of a mighty warrior called Hêlal, whose ambition it was to ascend higher than all the other stellar divinities, but who had to descend to the depths; it thus portrayed as a battle the process by which the bright morning star fails to reach the highest point in the sky before being faded out by the rising sun.

The biggest boom would be in jobs paying under $45,000, as the company would be both be making a profit on each job created and getting free labor.  However, this is a pretty crappy way to stimulate the economy. It creates jobs that will surely go away when the stimulus funds dry up and pays for them by gutting the social safety net or disaster relief money.  In the real Congress, the idea would have a snowball's chance of getting passed, but in my opinion the show isn't about the substance of policy, but about the drama that surrounds political process. Because of this, I give the show a pass on whatever policy they through at us for the most part even when it is monumentally stupid like AmWorks."

HouseOfCards,33qz1q,NicCageKillerBees,3,Fri Apr 24 22:28:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think it's mentioned during his press conference one episode and then you can confirm it in the episode where the mayor of DC declares an emergency on unemployment by dividing the FEMA funds by the number of unemployed.   At one point in the show they also mention how many people in the US are out of work and if you divide that number by the population of the US you get like 5-6% (but I'm on my phone and I don't remember when it was so don't quote me on that).  That's pretty close to the US average in most non-recessionary years so unemployment isn't that bad in House of Cards to begin with.

HouseOfCards,33qz1q,KMKtwo-four,2,Wed May 13 01:27:52 2015 UTC,He mentioned laying them off because of the threat of the funds drying up due to the incoming hurricane
HouseOfCards,33qz1q,elmarko44,2,Fri May 15 17:53:36 2015 UTC,"Demand increases.  Millions of people go from not being able to afford basic needs to buying, cars, houses, iphones, etc. with their new found salaries.  The price of labor drops drastically at the same time, so production can ramp up to meet the rising prices.  It's economic growth, or a bubble.  Unless you have a PhD in Econ then which ever of the two it is probably depends on your political perception.    What also happens is that social programs get cut.  So in order to benefit from the 'welfare' system you must contribute your labor.  Money that could have been spent on those who don't contribute to the GDP is now spent on those who do.  EDIT: I'm going to preempt the 'MARXIST!!!' comments here before they start.  Fank's plan alienates people from their labor -it's not Marxist.  It increases people's dependence on wages (wage slavery), the labor surplus, and perpetuates a class based economy."
HouseOfCards,33qz1q,redrobot5050,3,Fri Apr 24 22:58:00 2015 UTC,"I think the demand for labor, especially the low-wage labor generated by the AmWorks program, needs to precede the influx of available labor.  I guess the real question is, what is all of that new-found labor producing? It would need to be producing something like infrastructure wit a long-term benefit or locally-produced goods and services which keep the injection of money local and at the bottom of the economic scale.  FDR did something very similar with the New Deal programs, and they were mostly beneficial. We're still seeing the benefits from those programs 80 years later.   However, I think Frank's plan was to give the money to larger corporations (campaign donors) under the condition they hire people (which they'd do at the lowest wage possible) which means a lot of the money would NOT go to the lower class."
HouseOfCards,33qz1q,Suturn,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:00:09 2015 UTC,"I guess the real question is, what is all of that new-found labor producing?    The examples from the show: Groundskeepers, dish washers, day care workers. So D.C. residents got cleaner, safer parks, more affordable child care, and better service at their restaurants.    However, I think Frank's plan was to give the money to larger corporations (campaign donors) under the condition they hire people (which they'd do at the lowest wage possible) which means a lot of the money would NOT go to the lower class.

I think a Franks program would have a much bigger impact at first than Obamacare did. In the end it may work, it may not. Maybe it would be effective enough to stimulate the economy long enough that it could get itself back on track, but chances are slim. An economy needs to fix itself honestly. No government program has ever completely restored an economy, it only helps soften the blow. If AmWorks softens the blow enough, it may increase Franks popularity.   But what do I know, I got a C- in Eco last semester."
HouseOfCards,33qz1q,LV_Mises,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:18:42 2015 UTC,Well the New Deal really helped the economy post-depression. I think the government helping out with creating jobs (the New Deal and America Works) can really benefit an economy
HouseOfCards,33qz1q,Coffeecor25,4,Fri Apr 24 22:30:31 2015 UTC,"The New Deal and America Works created jobs but they did it in a completely different way. The New Deal provided people with government jobs in exchange for a lower than average wage, this then gave people some money which then boosted the economy due to an increase in consumer spending. America Works would only give a temporary increase in jobs due them being supplied by government payment to the companies.  The jobs in the New Deal were public works type things. The people rebuilt the country and also others documented the process. The America Works jobs would not be country improving and would be immediately wiped when the funds dried up."
HouseOfCards,33qz1q,gar-dena,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"Except, the funds would only dry up because AmWorks wasn't being fully funded. Frank funded it by executive order. He was cramming it down everyone's throat, hoping that success would justify it sticking around by the time things got back to the supreme court to decide which branch (Legislative or Executive) was in the right.   I think the real policy for AmWorks involved a permanent diversion of some of our social security payroll tax into AmWorks. We each pay about 6.2% of our wages (up to the max wage index, so its capped at $7-8k if you make over $118,000) into Social Security.   I think the idea was to create a new entitlement that did not directly benefit the elderly, but rather, people of all age brackets and education level, so long as you would be without a job or a job that paid less than $45k."

HouseOfCards,33dglr,Ramgolf12,4,Wed Apr 22 00:52:27 2015 UTC,"If caught early enough the 10 year survival rate can be as high as 90% according to some studies (vs. the average stage one diagnosis which only has a 5 year survival rate of 54%). Pretty sure that'd be before there were any symptoms like coughing though--more like the type that'd only show up on a CT scan (which is why some groups like I-ELCAP advocate for annual CT screenings). So not really applicable here, just throwing it out there."
HouseOfCards,33dglr,I_love_propofol,8,Wed Apr 22 06:56:00 2015 UTC,Hmm I would argue that it's too soon for a major network show to be having such a similar plot point as a recently concluded show.

I'm going to say either Frank already knows he has lung cancer and is hiding it from everyone including Claire, or the cough is indicative of something else and not lung cancer at all."
HouseOfCards,33dglr,Kumdogmillionaire,28,Tue Apr 21 22:53:55 2015 UTC,"Doubt it. Jackie's husband is a cardiologist, so he would have been looking at the heart, not lungs. I think the coughing was just symbolic of his weakened state, both politically and physically."
HouseOfCards,33dglr,norcon,12,Tue Apr 21 19:17:34 2015 UTC,"Chest x-rays are used by cardiologists all the time. Pulmonary oedema (one of the major complications of heart failure) is diagnosed via chest x-ray. Plus there are plenty of other cardiac conditions that warrant a chest x-ray, there's so much more to it than just the lungs."
HouseOfCards,33dglr,becd539,4,Tue Apr 21 19:31:01 2015 UTC,"Let me be more clear. The assumption of OP was that Jackie's husband would be looking at the lungs on the x-ray (possibly Frank). But by specifying that he is a cardiologist we can say that yes, he would be looking at a chest x-ray; he would not be looking at the lungs on the x-ray however.   I'm not arguing that he wasn't looking at a chest x-ray. I'm arguing that he wasn't looking at the lungs ON the chest x-ray."
HouseOfCards,33dglr,toneesh,4,Tue Apr 21 21:21:23 2015 UTC,"I get your point, but cardiologists do look at the lungs on x-ray all the time! Much more than the heart tbh, because that's a solid organ and is usually just a white blob with no significance other than its size, whereas the lungs are full of gas and show a lot more detail. The heart and lungs are very interconnected and a lot of cardiac pathology manifests via the lungs, which in turn shows up on x-ray.  I do agree with your point about it being insignificant though, but for an ever so slightly different reason. Although cardiologists do examine the lungs on xray, Jackie's husband is unlikely to be examining a chest x-ray for lung cancer."

I actually thought something would happen this season with the cough, but it didn't.   Alternatively, it could just be an example of Frank's ""weakness"" that was really shining through this season."
HouseOfCards,33dglr,mokoko__,2,Tue Apr 21 21:51:02 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing. The whole third season was showing his life is not sustainable. Something had to give and it did at the end of the season.

HouseOfCards,33eex2,FirstmateJibbs,4,Tue Apr 21 21:15:34 2015 UTC,"I can try, though others can certainly do better:   The bitterness comes from the inherent imbalance of power in their relationship.  The season focused on that imbalance because now Frank is president.  Power is inherently alienating, and there's no way they can be ""equals"" in the same way they arguably were before that.  Anytime this has come up in the past (Frank putting himself ahead of Claire's interests), Claire has similarly acted against Frank.  As an example within this season, Claire repeatedly tried to get Frank to do things for her (Secretary of State, not go to meet Petrov), and he continually ignored her input, often in ways that had detrimental effects on her.  If she's not an equal, then she's being disrespected by him, and she won't tolerate that (largely because it often hurt her own political goals as well).  The reference to the seven years refers, I believe, to an agreement the two of them have. Every 7 years, they have a conversation about whether their relationship is mutually beneficial.  Claire has always been sickened by Frank's weakness.  Even in the first episode, when she says, ""My husband does not apologize... even to me.""  Frank has had a lot of ups-and-downs this season, partly because he's playing on a larger scale, and partly because he's burnt a lot of bridges to achieve power.  That ultimately means he's showing weakness, and Claire doesn't find that helpful to her own goals."

Thus the whole scene in the bedroom where she demands to be f*cked and for Frank to look her in the eye while doing so. He lost her respect way long ago and that provocation in the bedroom was the final straw that proved her right in her speculations.

If the sex bothers you, you don't have to worry, it gets more downplayed in season 2 and 3, like many other shows (GOT) they hook you in with the sex and then use it more effectively in later seasons."

""Khan"" is also seen as a title in the Mongolic Xianbei confederation  for their chief between 283 and 289.  The Rourans were the first people who used the titles khagan and khan for their emperors, replacing the Chanyu of the Xiongnu, whom Grousset and others assume to be Turkic.  It was subsequently adopted by the Ashina before Mongols brought it to the rest of Asia. In the middle of the sixth century it was known as ""Kagan – King of the Turks"" to the Iranians.

I'd also argue that POTUS (whoever that may be and whatever he may do) and any random congressman has more skill than a bbq cook and a prostitute because the latter have no say in anything at all. If you want to keep Garreth and Peter where they are (which I'd disagree with, seeing where other characters are), Rachel and Freddy should be moved below everyone on both axis. Same with Lisa - she got tricked last season and hasn't shown any considerable skill, not the same amount as a presidential candidate or an actual president."

I'm not comparing between skills, just relative ability within each person's skill.   If you think of it that way, being the ""best"" at anything, AND having a large amount of social influence puts you in the powerbroker corner.  If the plan for Freddy's joint to turn into a national chain had worked out, he would have had a national audience, it would have moved him both up and to the right, maybe even into the power-broker quad if it was successful enough.   Think of it this way: everybody above the mid-line is famous. Everyone to the right of the midline is really good at what they do."

HouseOfCards,32zdco,chaspooley,6,Sat Apr 18 00:17:25 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, this is a Simpsons and House of Cards Masg-up piece I did a while back.  I thought that Mayor Quimby and Frank were just the perfect match up so i tried to adapt the first sea on poster with Quimby seated, blood running down his hands.  Then i tried to choose a quote that could have seemingly been said by both characters.    Lastly, I decide to include Jebadiah Springfield instead of the upside down flag, because as any true Simpsons fan should know, the founder of Springfield was actually the murderous fraud and pirate, Hans Sprungfeld.   I always look at the main theme of House of Cards to be dealing with legacy, and how myth, lies and falsifications can be used to manipulate images into being viewed in a different light.  The Underwoods are very concerned with the public perception of them, and the Legacy they will be leaving behind.  So in that regard I believe that Sprungfeld from the Simpsons embodies that idea supremely.  All comments welcome!

HouseOfCards,32xo64,champurrada,19,Sat Apr 18 05:42:33 2015 UTC,"This is the most interesting bit for me, a description of what the opening credits should look like:  ""Iconic shots of D.C. - the Capitol, the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, Reflecting Pool, etc. But we see them from odd angles, cast in dark shadows or beneath moody skies. The feeling should be ominous. We shift to interiors - dark hallways and restaurant booths where slow-motion, silhouetted figures conspire with one another. Interlaced with all of this are recurring shots of dextrous hands expertly shuffling a deck of cards and dealing them out. The FINAL IMAGE should be of the dealer unveiling his hand to the camera: not four, but FIVE one-eyed jacks.""  It's rather different to what we got, but I prefer the one we have now. The described one sounds very generic and clumsy with the ""cards"" motif (plus that final image sounds very cheesy the way I imagine it). The one we have is a lot more impersonal as there are no people, which creates a cold and distanced feeling to those in Washington."

But when Francis is talking with Linda she asks if it is his intent to use the Vice Presidency to spring board a campaign in 2016.  Although this isn't Francis' plan since he still was out for revenge it still rings true.  He would have likely used the Secretary of State position to launch a campaign in 2016.  It is also possible that he would have tried to be the Vice President in 2016 and launch a campaign in 2020 for the Presidency.
HouseOfCards,32wh2m,tjop92,11,Fri Apr 17 14:12:25 2015 UTC,This is the answer.  He would have ran for President later.  He only made big power moves out of revenge.

I feel Frank believes in God, as he's never explicitly said he doesn't, but he refuses to believe that God believes in him or does him any good. I guess you could call him a deist.

HouseOfCards,32ghf6,fcolella,20,Mon Apr 13 16:36:11 2015 UTC,When we are deciding who will represent each party in the general election we go state by state and see who each state likes best. Iowa and New Hampshire are just first. We usually have a wide field of candidates at this time because more people are able to afford campaigning in just one or two states. The political parties use it as a testing ground to see how their candidates stack up against each other. It's important because a lot of the time a front runner emerges and it gains them the support of their party. A lot of candidates end up only campaigning there and drop out after.
HouseOfCards,32ghf6,woahgeez,10,Mon Apr 13 18:02:37 2015 UTC,That's a lot more clear now.  So basically there is nothing very special about those states it's just a coincidence that they are the first states candidates go campaigning.   Is Clinton also going to go to Iowa and New Hampshire first?
HouseOfCards,32ghf6,woahgeez,12,Mon Apr 13 18:15:12 2015 UTC,"Yea, she will be there. It's the same thing every four years except the incumbent president usually doesn't have to do it.   It seems kind of messed up to me that Iowa and New Hampshire end up playing such a huge role in our presidential elections considering how unimportant they are compared to other states in the general election."
HouseOfCards,32ghf6,BrownBalls,3,Mon Apr 13 18:58:46 2015 UTC,You guys got a pretty strange voting system over there. Or is that just me
HouseOfCards,32ghf6,woahgeez,2,Tue Apr 14 17:01:34 2015 UTC,"A lot of states have a strong trend of voting for one party. For example california/new york are generally democrat while texas/georgia are generally republican. This leads to a few states end up being known as swing states where they can go either way, thus if a candidate has all of the states that would normally vote for their party and gets most of the swing states they'll win.   but overall yes it's weird and I don't like it."
HouseOfCards,32ghf6,SpongeboobNipplepant,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:24:28 2015 UTC,One of the worst things is if you live in a state that always votes one way your vote literally doesn't matter at all.
HouseOfCards,32ghf6,kevinnetter,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, the difference is between your vote being 0 and being 1/180 million, which are infinitesimally different. As an individual voter, you make the most difference in primaries, caucuses, and in smaller races (House of Representatives, Senate in smaller states, and especially more local races)."

In past years I have been to rallies for Obama, Clinton, Michelle Bachmann, and Ron Paul, I missed one for Rand Paul recently. Herman Cain also toured the state in 2012.   Iowa is our first caucus. It has different rules for determining who is ahead in primary elections, and a population that is somewhat balanced between democrats and republicans, and then again when mapping ideology.  Persuasive candidates really do well here, because most of the Iowan's I know aren't super die-hard with their opinions. On the other hand, they seem to give each candidate a chance to prove their worth."
HouseOfCards,32ghf6,kmofosho,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:41:02 2015 UTC,"So basically there is nothing very special about those states it's just a coincidence that they are the first states candidates go campaigning.    It is a little bit more than them just going first. Winning Iowa gives you momentum and legitimacy for the future. The media airtime is important as well (as shown in HoC). Iowa and NH basically sort out who is in contention and who is not. Something like the last 5 democratic candidates won Iowa first.   It also should be noted that usually there are many more candidates in the first primaries/caucuses. HoC shows a weird year because usually no one from the same party challenges a sitting President. Usually there will be around 10 candidates initially for each party in Iowa and NH. If they lose big in the initial rounds, they will slowly start to drop out. There will be just 2-3 in the last rounds."

HouseOfCards,32g2wv,proznac,23,Mon Apr 13 14:46:02 2015 UTC,"Well the system itself is fairly accurate, the political ideologies of characters not by a long shot.  For example, a democrat would never in a million years support a program like AmWorks. Eliminating all entitlements? That's any Tea-Party politician's wet dream.   And then you have the general evilness of politicians, especially FU, that's  exaggerated and (hopefully) not at all accurate."
HouseOfCards,32g2wv,NeutrinosFTW,7,Mon Apr 13 14:52:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, besides Underwood most politicians seem to be portrayed fairly well. Some, like Walker and Blythe, are well-meaning guys who genuinely want to do good, while other people like Sharp and Birch are more power-hungry and less ideological. No one besides Underwood is straight-up evil.   I agree with you about the system, the specific policies are pretty out there. A Democrat in conflict with the teachers' unions and pro-charter schools? Makes sense, there's a lot of Democrats like that today. A Democrat proposing to eliminate most of the social safety net? That's a bit out there."
HouseOfCards,32g2wv,Crook_Shank,3,Tue Apr 14 19:47:56 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, it's worth mentioning that many of the characters are quite realistic. I was really impressed with how Dunbar turned out. I didn't like the ""holier than though"" way she was presented at first, because I really doubt that's a thing. The ""I'm righteous, I value justice, I respect people, but I'm also willing to destroy someone who has never wronged me just to get what I want"" act is very representative of politicians, I believe.  I was mainly referring to Frank and Claire (she's as evil as it gets IMO, even if she hides it very well most of the time behind the classy lady act). My theory is that the writers try to kinda encompass all the worst in politicians in the two of them, which is why I referred to it as ""general evilness of politicians""."
HouseOfCards,32g2wv,NeutrinosFTW,5,Tue Apr 14 20:30:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Dunbar turned out really well. Frank and Claire are basically sociopathic wild cards dropped into a pool of ""regular"" politicians. They're pretty clearly portrayed as exceptions, and not meant to represent anything realistic, as opposed to people like Dunbar, Walker, and Birch, who could pass for real-world politicians fairly easily."
HouseOfCards,32g2wv,Crook_Shank,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:43:31 2015 UTC,"Well I'd rather have Underwood as President than Walker, at least Frank isn't horribly incompetent or just a straight-up idiot.

HouseOfCards,32g2wv,Prussicus,2,Sun Jun 7 00:00:37 2015 UTC,"I never got the vibe that Frank was really a democrat. Like to me it seems he doesn't care about the party or platform, just furthering his own goals and AmWorks was just a way to cement his legacy and win him another term."
HouseOfCards,32g2wv,InsertNameHere77,2,Wed Apr 15 00:36:44 2015 UTC,"Actually, a Tea Partier would not stand for a government sponsored jobs program like AmWorks either.  AmWorks is a liberal plan, it's just a very bold and different liberal plan that wouldn't fly in a million years."

Maybe they justify it as realism, where justice is not guaranteed but regardless it doesn't make for a satisfying watch. Even if Frank dies, its not really enough.  I think in trying to differentiate themselves from your average drama with a happy ending, they've just ended up with a cartoonish villain who wins all the time. Too many lows, very little highs, the plot just becomes tiresome."

HouseOfCards,3283gy,wordless_thinker,4,Sat Apr 11 16:00:53 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to the people who say you shouldn't try and be a little ruthless, OP. Of course, in actual politics, FU isn't an example one should follow, but a little cunning and tricks can really go a long way in MUN. The difference is, politics is long term: you need a sustainable strategy, and screwing people over isn't a great one. MUN is just over the course of one week-end, so dirty tactics can prevail over strategy.  Straight to the Bin: When an amendment is introduced to your resolution, let it be introduced, but not debated. In most ROPs, voting is more disruptive than a moderated/unmoderated caucus to discuss the amendment, so as soon as they put forward a motion to go into mod/unmod, propose a vote on the amendment itself. If you're lucky, it can be voted on even though no debate took place, which can make their case harder to argue.  The Turncoat: Some procedure matters require two delegates to speak for, and two delegates to argue against. You can volunteer for either, regardless of what you actually wish for. Use that to your advantage: volunteer as a speaker for (when you're actually against the motion), and make a poor case for it, or make the case for the opposite side. You can make it more sneaky, by making it look like you're trying. If asked, just say you were confused about what you were speaking for, that always does the trick for me.  The goal is to take up space where somebody would have made a better argument, and refrain your opponent from speaking his mind at all on that subject.   The Mole: You can pass notes to other delegates instead of talking to them. But you can also send messages  I once crashed a resolution thanks to this: I proposed on behalf of the UK to be a submitter alongside their three other submitters.  They sent it to the Chair, and it read that the UK, PRC, India and France were sponsors. Sure enough, the actual UK delegate spoke up, and backed out, the resolution proposal was made invalid (as the ROP requires three sponsors to display a resolution). While they were busy figuring out what happened with the UK, my own resolution was grinding along. They managed to get a new sponsor, but he had conditions, and they had to change their resolution, losing some of their support. By the time they'd started to catch up, mine was put to a vote and was adopted.   The Resolution and the Hare: So despite your best efforts your opponent manages to get a resolution on the table, and it's about to be voted. If the ROP allow for it, divide the question so that each clause will be voted on individually. Add a roll-call vote to that and the resolution could take an hour to vote. Dividing the question + roll-call vote = utter chaos. Some people might ultimately want to leave before voting is over. The reason it's risky is: you need some support of your own to back these proposals. You can sell that by talking to some countries who are hostile and/or undecided about the resolution, and tell them that dividing the question allows them to vote out some clauses they don't like. Convincing people of roll-call vote is more difficult, but you can tell those same delegates it'll slow down a resolution about which they're not on board.   None of what I've written will get you that ""Best delegate award"", but they'll get your resolution through, and in my experience they've been really fun to do."
HouseOfCards,3283gy,Formadivix,8,Sat Apr 11 19:28:17 2015 UTC,"MUN is more long-term than you realize, I think. I remember the names and faces of every schmuck who screwed me over in committee, over more than 5 years. And if I see one of them on the circuit, I will go out of my way to make sure they fail.  Also, dividing the question and roll-call vote may get you temporary results, but you will be shut out for the rest of committee, if even just because your chair will hate you."

If OP wants to focus on resolutions I was always fond of amending a resolution to death. MUN here has a rule where you need at least 4 operative clauses so I'd make an amendment to remove enough clauses to get it to under 4 and if it passes the resolution dies on its own, I try to make sure people don't understand that the consequences of their votes, I actually got a sponsor to consider it friendly once."

HouseOfCards,326fsz,alwinhimself,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:59:43 2015 UTC,"The point of the bill wasn't to help bring down Peter. It was supposed to help give Peter legitimacy (remember the interviewer pointed out he hadn't sponsored any legislation), to help Peter get enough support to be the Dems' candidate, and to get Peter to trust Frank."

Or at least a few hours  I also enjoy taking some time after each episode to read the reddit thread that relates to it... I found this season that the binge watchers were either not on their game, just missing bits or just plain exhausted...whole plot twists and WTF moments slipped by unremarked...  However I love this format of releasing it in one chunk - not forcing me to wait 7 days for each new installment - I may watch 3 over the weekend, then none for a week - love how they are giving the power to decide to the viewer."

Tried it again later and binged all the way through to the end of the third season and loved every minute of it. It really comes down to the person, and to me, the only advantage of not binging is that you'll probably finish the series closer to the Season 4 premiere than us who binged who are sitting here with a void in our daily entertainment."
HouseOfCards,326d2k,nclstudent,17,Fri Apr 10 23:24:25 2015 UTC,"If we are running with the 'loss of control' theme then maybe Frank ends up trying to kill himself in the last episode, maybe in the same way that Russo did. Bonus points if it fails and he's lost everything including control over his own life.   That would be super dark though."
HouseOfCards,326d2k,Spazit,6,Sat Apr 11 01:14:30 2015 UTC,"The scene opens with Francis J. Underwood seated at the Presidential Desk in the Oval Office. Frank is centered on the screen, and the camera is at eye level, just across the desk from him. We are close enough that we can't see items on his desk. Frank addresses the audience:  ""Here I sit, my vast empire, built over decades, piled high with the remains of my enemies. My life's work now on the precipice, and soon to fall into the hard ground below, and shatter, as I had done to the work of so many before me.""  Up until now, the President has been leaning back in his chair looking weary, even defeated. Now he leans forward and we see anger flash in his eyes, and we know the Frank of old still lingers, full of pride and rage. He continues speaking.  ""My defeat may have been inevitable from the very beginning of my climb, but the climb had to come, all the same. Those around me were incompetent, and from the first, I have known that power was my only calling.""  ""You may recall the story I once told you, of my father in the barn, with the shotgun he couldn't fire? The fool was always poor at planning, and that occasion was no different. His life was dreary, and he saw no prospect of improvement, so he sought to end it. But even that small victory was prevented by a stubborn child with a willingness to see him suffer.""  ""My wife has abandoned me, my empire crumbles, and those who once counted themselves my allies turn and bite their master. On all sides I face defeat.""  Here, Frank stands suddenly looking determined, and above all else, ancient. He leans on the desk for support, his shoulders hunched, in much the same way he claimed this very desk years ago. Again we see his left hand rise and fall twice in rapid succession, hear that solid ""thunk-thunk"" of a man declaring his preparedness for what is to come. For the final time Francis J. Underwood, President of the United States, addresses us.  ""In the face of it all, I claim my final victory.""  Frank picks up a revolver from his desk, and puts the muzzle in his mouth. The camera cuts to black. We hear a gunshot, the thud of a body hitting something hard, and then the sound of running feet and a scream."

Although, in the HoC-iverse, following Frank's inevitable downfall, it wouldn't be surprising to have him listed as a Hitler parallel (I seem to recall, or misrecall that Hitler came to power without actually winning any democratic elections) in terms of willingness to be a bad dude, and political tendencies for unilateral diplomacy."

Edit:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_federal_election,_March_1933  This is the event I was thinking of. Hitler's party did not have the majority vote required to obtain the power he needed, in spite of some fairly severe suppression tactics. So he made his own way around it.

The best I could figure was that the Oval office (in movies/cinema) rarely has Service members in it, and that maybe Meechum helped out in keeping them out for a few precious seconds? Frank is just enough of a strongarm leader that he could force the Service just out of action range for just long enough.  EDIT: I intentionally left his forward planning out of the matter for this reason specifically. It was a good scene, but hard to explain. It makes sense in my head as an ending though."

HouseOfCards,326d2k,Mata101,8,Sat Apr 11 06:23:40 2015 UTC,"U/LabRatsAteMyHomework said this about a month ago.   My guess is that frank has lung cancer. Hear me out. Occasionally smoking, coughing fit in front of the press, and at one point, Jackie's husband is looking at chest xrays on his computer (for a slight second). It was all very subtle but this show could go any direction. And to answer your question, yes. I thought so too. He seems so.. mean. Just flat out evil. I didn't even feel bad when Claire left. She was evil only in his presence but when she was not around frank, her demeanor was kind-hearted with a few exceptions."
HouseOfCards,326d2k,Feraligatre,3,Sat Apr 11 12:04:30 2015 UTC,That's a really convincing argument. Especially at the end when Claire reaches for the cigarettes in the bowl and Frank tells her he moved them to his desk

They vary as much in personality, ruthlessness and integrity as your average people on the street. What they all do usually have in common is the gift of gab and/or 'spin', as Frank does - that's how they get their job. Sounds obvious, but seeing real humans behave that disingenuously and smoothly on a day-to-day basis is jarring up close.  I have also been around politicians with psychotically bad tempers, ones who've explicitly offered to reverse their opinions on issues based on their major donors' desires, and ones who employ some of the most insane levels of nepotism imaginable. I've seen politicians cheat on their wives, alcoholic politicians, etc - and also some of the greatest and most morally sound leaders I've ever met. Like I said, it's a mixed bag.

HouseOfCards,32452n,SpongeboobNipplepant,-2,Fri Apr 10 21:49:50 2015 UTC,Frank Underwood is overwhelmingly charming to the general public. I don't know what you're talking about on that count.
HouseOfCards,32452n,ablebodiedmango,2,Sun Apr 19 01:44:32 2015 UTC,"There is no way you've actually seen the show if you believe that.  The knock on him for being just the VP candidate was that he was a stiff pragmatist without any wow factor and who relied almost entirely on Claire to humanize him and make him attractive. I think you might be blinded by your own preference for the character. In the show he is shown to be fairly unpopular, and that's intended since he became VP and President without having been elected to either office"
HouseOfCards,32452n,SpongeboobNipplepant,-1,Sun Apr 19 01:53:49 2015 UTC,"Of course I've seen the show. I'm talking about the scenes in Iowa -- you know, the ones where he gives rousing speeches to roaring crowds and laughs and jokes with people in townhall meetings? You've watched those, right? Keep in mind that the majority of the public is ignorant to Frank's back-room dealings and none of them know he's a murderer.   It seems as if the bulk of Underwood's unpopularity stems from the his accession to the office and his apparent connection to the Tusk/Walker/Feng controversy and the America Works fiasco and his unpopularity on Capitol Hill."
HouseOfCards,32452n,ablebodiedmango,2,Sun Apr 19 02:22:22 2015 UTC,Well he's the President and these rallies are always full of hardcore supporters. You'll never see a stump speech on the campaign trail with crowds of jeering haters. That's how campaigns work.

HouseOfCards,32452n,ablebodiedmango,2,Sun Apr 19 20:45:19 2015 UTC,I think your hard on for  a fictional character who was horribly written in the third season is clouding your reason and judgment. Even with the bad writing you still missed salient plot points in why Francis isn't a good President or people person.
HouseOfCards,32452n,KokiriEmerald,-1,Sun Apr 19 20:50:42 2015 UTC,"""Hard on for a fictional character""? Mkay, sure.   Disregard that I never asserted he was a good president nor a good person (rather, he merely acts personable throughout his campaign and the debate, which he won partially because of his conciliatory demeanor), and nevermind that we almost never see what the public thinks of him, only Congress. I'd assert that the distrust for Underwood fomented privately by people like Remy, Mendoza, Sharp, and Blythe has skewed your perception of Underwood. Political insiders' insight is not generally available for public consumption, and that's the case in HoC, too.  My point is this: with what evidence would you argue that, to the average, largely ignorant American voter, Frank Underwood is an Al Gore-type stiff?   I just wanted to point this out, by the way:   Even with the bad writing you still missed salient plot points in why Francis isn't a good President or people person   Learn to fucking write. Jeez."

HouseOfCards,32452n,Bigfluffyltail,4,Fri Apr 10 18:15:32 2015 UTC,"In short, very much so. Elaborating a little on that answer, it depends on your definition of insider. I´m not a US congress person but I know that world. I can assure you that there are plenty of similarities. gatonoir´s description is pretty much spot on. It will depend on the individual. Washington is like the wildest party where you will find every type. Some have admirable integrity, others are simply abominable. Some are great professionals and actually care about their jobs, responsibilities and constituents. Most of the people who are involved in politics, from politicians to lobbyists to executive assistants, are obsessed with appearances so one is always stepping on eggs. The series´accuracy is what initially caught my attention. As I followed, I also appreciated how well written and produced it was, with powerful performances. I believe Season 1 was, until now, the best in portraying how things work. One of the reasons is that they focused on more people and the dynamics of power in Washington --on all levels and in different places. It also shows how priorities easily change and are negotiable, depending on personal interests. The writers have also managed to portray well how narcissistic egos with so much power are highly complex and unwilling to lose in any way. The competitiveness is taken to extremes and can only be tolerated if one is on that level. That said, in all my years working and living in those circles, I never met of any cold blooded murder. However, I wouldn´t be surprised if I had. But I did meet people who, according to US law, were criminals and either had been or would be caught. Or not. As gatonoir pointed out, there is everything. Washington D.C. -and any other major political environment- is crazy. It´s sort of a human zoo and like any zoo you will find the beautiful and loyal animal as well as the most ruthless and cruel beast.  Many times I´ve been asked, how can people take it, how can you take it? Well, there is also a beauty to it all. Generally speaking, it is very exciting and, when things go well, can be extremely rewarding. The premise is to do good --for people, the community, your country-- and, for the most part, I believe much of that good is achieved. Problem is, the means used to reach a goal can often ruin the premise. So you can trust and enjoy the series. I´ve become a HoC fan."

HouseOfCards,32452n,DevilD0ge,4,Fri Apr 10 20:57:22 2015 UTC,It was written by a UK conservative MP so there's probably a bit of truth.
HouseOfCards,32452n,partytemple,3,Fri Apr 10 15:41:51 2015 UTC,"I've read a few accounts (from close associates and journalists) on the Clintons, on their personal behavior in comparison to their public faces, and I also see an eerie connection between the Underwoods and them. However, I don't think much of the show is inspired by the Clintons. It is inspired mainly by the original series, as HoC is indeed a remake of the original. Perhaps only the relationship between Claire and Frank is a portrayal of the real life Clintons. For example, Claire knows very well that Frank has an affair with Zoe and yet remains with him for the sake of political influence. The same could be said about Hilary after Bill's sex scandals. Hilary's chance at being NY's senator, and as well as the rest of her political career, was heavily influenced by Bill's connections. Both of these marriages are controlled by political agendas. In Season 3, Frank's personality became very much like Bill's during his post-presidential years, or some may even argue that Bill had always been like this. During Hilary's 2008 presidential campaign, Bill's outrageous remarks revealed the arrogant and unscrupulous side of him, and it made many of his closest followers and friends leave him. His behavior also cost Hilary's chance at the presidency. Frank's temperamental outbursts are reminiscent of this, that his personality is his biggest flaw. Bill Clinton, even during his presidency, had always been described as ""bad man, good president."" Those who left his side have come out to transform this title to ""bad man and bad president."" One of these most notable people is Al Gore. Once he left office he was glad to have stopped pretending as if Bill was a good leader.  Kevin Spacey is a close friend, and one of the few remaining ""friends,"" of Bill Clinton. It wouldn't surprise me if he in fact took some notes and put it on the show. Although, I think only a few elements of the show exhibits similarities with the Clintons. The plot-line and themes are just fantasies of power-hungry and nasty realpolitik. If you would like to understand more about politicians and politics, there are plenty of books to read about that. And no, HoC is not an accurate of real-life politics because Washington is such a large place with all kinds of politicians doing all sorts of things for all sorts of different reasons. HoC is an example of platitudes that are often assumptions made by the public.  Edit: I would also like to add that the most notable characteristic shared by both of couples is their effect on politics and their status in it. There has been no recent political couple that has received as much spotlight in politics as the Clintons. The Underwoods have emulated that element."
HouseOfCards,32452n,DevilD0ge,1 point,Sat Apr 11 06:41:31 2015 UTC,I think the reason Claire was ok with Zoe is because she and Frank obviously have a fairly liberal open approach to sexual relations - on both sides.

HouseOfCards,32452n,SwingingSalmon,2,Wed Apr 15 02:43:56 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to find old articles but I've found a few recent ones, and a few old ones, about Clinton's ridiculous attacks on Obama which cost Hillary's chance at winning.  Recent NYT article reporting on Hillary's new strategy by taming Bill.  A collection of Bill's comments on Obama published on Politico.  An old article about Bill's ""fairy tale"" comment on Obama.  The ""fairy tale"" comment on video.  A criticism of the Clintons' spotlight in American politics.  Recent Politico article on Bill's smaller influence in Hillary's 2016 campaign compared to 2008's.  One of Hillary Clinton's biggest weaknesses in the 2008 campaign was her husband playing the sidekick. His influence and the statements he made alienated a lot of Democratic voters away from Hillary. Obama had also pointed this out in several debates that he ""couldn't separate Hillary from Bill"" and turned Hillary's weakness into a winning argument for himself. Although many of the articles I provided are recent analyses of the past, those conclusions are definitely established during that time. In fact, the recent articles talk about Hillary not making that mistake again. Moreover, many personal accounts talk about Bill Clinton as very short-tempered and being quite vile and nasty.  Edit: Now that I think of it, this sort of reminds me about Peter Russo's campaign and the Vice President stepping in and taking over that campaign. This is similar to Hillary's 2008 campaign, but not exactly identical."

In her own way, Claire is ""smothering the baby"" by leaving Frank, if she follows through. Depending on how publicly they play it out, Frank's run as president could be dead, as well as him having to face an extreme uphill battle to recover politically from having his wife leave him in the middle of a presidential run (and likely speaking out against him).

This relationship does however portray a stereotypical traditional relationship with the man as a breadwinner and the woman supporting in the back end. End of Season 3, Claire mentions how she felt powerless and the fact she needed to ask help from Francis was the thing that bother her the most. In the presidential debate of Season 3, I think the producers intentionally mixed in the topic of gender equality with the issue of the pay gap with female counterparts. The fact that the presidential race was designed by Francis to have Sharpe counter weight Dunbar seems to me that he looked down at the two females candidates as nothing more than a child's play and some obstacle to his inevitable victory."

As does the end of the third act with the end of the third season.  So I think they will somehow stick to that pattern and make it as many seasons as Macbeth has acts. 5

HouseOfCards,3208bi,irie1972,7,Thu Apr 9 15:17:12 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen Furious 7 and doubt I will. I tried on multiple occasions to watch a Fast and Furious movie, because I think they have some sort of heist element to them, and I love heist movies, but I just can't care about any of the characters. I also find all the car stuff horribly boring. I don't think my dislike is snobbery, they just don't fit for me. Action movies like that have their place.  That is the root of why I think what you're saying the podcast hosts talked about bothered you. A mindless action film is held to a different standard than a character driven drama.   Just going from what you said they said, I think they have good points. Cut out the Doug storyline and what changes? Dunbar doesn't possibly have access to the journal and maybe drops out or takes the Supreme Court spot? I don't think so, but maybe. I didn't find the Doug story boring, but it did feel out of place in the story of Frank and Claire. I think that is what HoC was and should be, the story of a power couple's rise (and fall) in American politics. The Doug story was filler, with the first episode literally forcing the viewer to watch Doug and try to make us care about him, because the writers know Doug was just a creepy henchman, and sometimes comic relief, in S1 and S2 and the audience wouldn't otherwise care about his story of being addicted to work, then replacing that addiction when forced to go cold turkey, turning back to alcohol, then connecting with his brother and family, then finally killing the physical embodiment of his addiction: Doug triumphant.   If they wanted the Doug embedded movie, I think it would have been interesting to have a segment at the beginning or end of each episode with Doug, but physically separate from the main story to further make us feel how he is working to get his way back into the main story.  Claire's arc in Russia was unearned. Claire gave up her charity when moving to the White House, which left the impression that she only started it for political reasons, never really caring about the charity aspect. I get it, that the first time we see Claire undermine Frank in any way was to give them permission to vote against the watershed bill. That was supposed to give us the impression that she really cares about the charity, but it came off as she was mad that Frank was putting his wishes ahead of hers... which sounds good for setting up this season, but there wasn't enough of that in S1 and S2, it was too understated or left on the cutting room floor. The entire Claire in s3 was poorly set up in S1 and S2. I can't think of any evidence she cares about anyone but herself, or herself and Frank, until she loses her cool and says what she said in Russia. What was leading up to this? Feeling bad for the cashier at Starbucks that had been fired like she fired her office manager? Crying on the steps for how she had to manipulate her fellow rape victim? Where was the remorse for helping to make the First Lady doubt the President and damaging their marriage, or the remorse for helping get Christine fired due to the First Lady's jealousy, or remorse for her husband killing Zoe and Peter? She just cares about hurting others sometimes? I think they didn't highlight enough that Claire is struggling with her role in the rise. Give us a bit more than Claire is forced to change her hair color for the campaign, symbolizing she's lost her identity.   Gavin was wasted. I would have loved if he had tracked down Rachel for Doug, but instead of handing over the information he'd gone to meet her himself and do what he did to Rachel's ex-girlfriend, and find out what she knew. Then Gavin would have known that Russo had been the victim of a conspiracy, and maybe connected the same dots Zoe and Janine that it went all the way up to Frank. Gavin's redemption is he wants his hacker buddy to be saved? What is more interesting: Gavin has to decide whether or not to give up the information about a girl he's never met and knows little about to secure his freedom Vs. Gavin has to decide if he wants to work with Rachel to try and take down the President, while also shaking confidence in the system he has worked against his entire life, or sell Rachel, who he now cares about, out for his 30 pieces of freedom and go hang out in Ecuador? Gavin was wasted as a character and an opportunity.  That poor biographer must still have scars from being shoehorned in. Need a confidant? Here's the writer. Need someone for Meechum to hate/be jealous of to remind us he cares about Frank? Here's the writer. Need someone to give Frank, and more importantly Claire, perspective on their lives from the outside looking in? Here's the writer. Need someone to be a love interest for another character we want to include in the main story because she's probably going to have a bigger role in Frank's downfall but otherwise we can't fit her into the story now? Here's the writer!  Remember in S1 when Frank mentioned a couple of Zoe's stories when they first met, despite her being a beat reporter and he told her to not be flattered because he reads everything? I actually liked the idea that Frank reads game reviews and played the game because of it, that was fun and a great moment of characterization (oh, I forgot, it was product placement /s) that he is playing this game guiding a person through a puzzle to relax. I think it would have been more interesting to have the writer be a beginning journalist.   Instead of having a guy who is so famous that he is reminded every day by someone of the book that he wrote (I honestly forget if his friend actually wrote the beginning or if he later said that was a lie too). I realize the benefit in having this writer able to give perspective on Frank's life, but why not have a 24 year old journalist that has struggled getting into journalism and could only get work at times freelancing for gaming journalism, but his natural talent shone through in those reviews? They are trying to write a novel and struggling with that.  He's got nothing going for him, has no job, no family, nothing but his novel, his dream of telling a story that someone else will want to listen to. What is the writer's struggle, the writer we have now? He hangs out with the President and then doesn't get to finish the book he started? Otherwise he gets to spend time with an 'older and powerful man and listen to his stories', which is kind of his fetish. He gets to be friends with benefits with the most talented journalist that is following the President.   Now imagine the young writer, who actually gets some perspective on life from Frank. The young writer can still have the history of being a male prostitute, but now can get perspective on that from Frank (giving us a chance to learn more about Frank's philosophy), with some observation from Frank about how everyone is a prostitute, but some people do it for free (cynical) or how man will do anything it takes to survive and thrive (practical) or a person is shaped by their experiences, that he should be proud of himself for all the things he had to do, even if they were distasteful, and never be ashamed of what he did, shame is useless (Frank has no time for useless things... or does he? Maybe he starts to feel shame for some of his own actions). We can juxtapose a young impoverished prostitute forced to sell himself to survive to Frank as the young impoverished politician forced to sell himself to conquer the world, maybe even questioning if he married Claire for her money and starting to wonder if the compromises he made were all necessary. Frank's relationship with the young writer can be his chance at redemption for what happened with Zoe, a chance for him to start to realize how much he hurt her and used her, a chance for internal conflict, but then when he kills the writer's book about America Works (not the writer), he still has helped the author solve the problems he had writing the unrelated novel. (What! Frank has a relationship end that doesn't result in the person being completely screwed over? Is Frank changing as a character?) The writer could have also been a stand in for a son that Frank will never have. Meechum's jealousy would make more sense. He sees the affection Frank has for this young writer and misunderstands it as erotic attraction when it is really more of a love of a father for a son.  Speaking of the father/son thing, I realize that may seem cliched. A cliche is ok when it allows Frank to confront a physical representation of the legacy he craves but won't have.  Should I talk about how dumb the Jackie Sharpe is struggling with her love for Remy storyline is? Dumb isn't the right word, it is like the Claire storyline, there wasn't enough set up. Who doubts that a married woman sometimes questions her marriage and wonders if some guy she loved would have been better or feels like she is trapped in a boring, cookie cutter life and craves excitement. I think that is pretty common. We didn't see that represented. Why is Jackie so attached to Remy? He got her to open up about droning apartment buildings when she was in the military? He knows the secret of her tattoo? He was the only guy that ever really knew her and all her dark secrets? If that was the case, I'd buy it, but we didn't get that either, it's projecting that onto their relationship. Maybe they bonded over the time Remy was working for Tusk and found out information to blackmail her but didn't use it.  I think we can all agree the Petrov storyline was very entertaining. It was nice to see Frank have an antagonistic peer. I hate saying that I think it could have been done a bit differently and been even better, but it was still the best part of the season.   The season feels like it was written with the future viewer, the one who only has to wait 15 seconds between season 3 and season 4. Unsatisfying is the right word."

HouseOfCards,3208bi,DavidSSD,3,Fri Apr 10 17:49:58 2015 UTC,"Films such as Furious 7 is something I cant really take seriously. When I saw a trailer for the movie and saw the car in Dubai driving out of a building into another one (I suppose) while a grenade launcher fires at it I thought it was the last straw. I have never seen a more over-the-top Michael bay-esque thing in my life, its almost comedic. The fighting, driving, explosions, hand to hand combat, gun fights, jumping off a bus and grabbing the wing of a car I saw from the trailer looks is just so unrealistic and ridiculous. They seemed to take every intense scene from the film and just mash it in the trailer to leave you disappointed when your actually watching the film since you already saw it from the trailer.   House of Cards is a completely different kind of thing. For once their trailers don't show much of what is happening but gives you a general framework that leaves you hyped. That's the point of a trailer. They kept it like the Star Wars Episode 7 Trailer: a little desert, new characters, some lightsaber, a sweeping fly of the Millennium Falcon but don't say anything about the plot. I enjoy the character development, plot line, the politics, its all good for me and I enjoy that stuff. I suppose the people from the podcast prefer action over drama or something like that."
HouseOfCards,3208bi,LaserWolfTurbo36,2,Sat Apr 11 01:09:20 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS FOR SEASON 3  The reason everyone has been raving about F7 is because it's exactly what it set out to be and is fun. Beside that fact is the inherent nostalgia for the film because of the long franchise history and the death of its star. HoC season 3 on the other hand is coming off of 2 seasons of some of the best TV ever. I think that season 3 is good, but didn't reach the bar set by 1 and 2. The season is definitely about exploring the characters and relationships more than other seasons. The problem is that for the average viewer there isn't the driving force of a tangible goal (S1: Vice presidency, S2: presidency). Frank's at the top of the food chain and as such his manipulation of people can't be as self serving so the character changes to reflect that. We enjoyed the drive of Frank and Claire to get to the top together, but that falls apart this season and there's no resolution. They also focused on side characters more this season, which to some might be a disappointment (for instance I really couldn't care less for Remy's storyline, and while I appreciate Doug's I didn't like how it ended). So, why the love for F7 and the dislike for HoC S3? Simple: met and unmet expectation. Everyone knew what F7 was going to be and it executed that perfectly. OTOH HoC really had to switch gears once Frank got the office and that's going to shake up the fanbase."

During that episode, you can see Frank sort of questioning Claire's status, too. Her flinching during the photo, e.g.   Something about their relationship really appeals me for some reason. I think one of the things is the way they softly communicate  to each other and are very open with one another. They support each other's passions and tolerate when other person fucks up.

Indulging in OP a moment, their hair is styled and colored similarly, the facial hair is done in precisely the same style - Tom's is simply fuller, wardrobe wise they are portrayed similarly throughout the show (primarily button ups),  and narratively they are/were both privy to sensitive information regarding a non-public aspect of the government which, if revealed, would be very damaging to the administration.   Visual metaphor and allegory has done far more with far less - based on looks alone it's not implausible that a character who looked like Tom Yates could be an allegory for Snowden.  If you wanted to disagree with OPs point, the fact that their backgrounds are dissimilar and Tom's narrative role doesn't really resemble Snowden's actual impact are far more persuasive points than pretending like it was all about seeing a white guy and that was all it took for OP to draw this conclusion."

He had a chip on his shoulder, and I forget which scene it is, but instead of Claire saying ""Oh I'm sorry baby, how could they do that to you?"" she basically tells him to stop being a fuck up.  I feel like that really set the tone for the season, you realized just how driven they were.  It also felt like it had more ""I'm going to set this person up to fail for my personal gain,"" which was really enjoyable to watch."
HouseOfCards,31qri8,OnlyRadioheadLyrics,2,Tue Apr 7 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"That's the first episode, I think.    I love that woman, I love her more than sharks love blood.   Well, my favourite thing about season one was that Claire and Frank were the ultimate power couple. Each formidable by themselves and  unstoppable together.  After that Claire essentially got reduced to a ""monkey wrench"" character."

HouseOfCards,31qri8,AwesomeberryJam,7,Tue Apr 7 15:46:30 2015 UTC,"I thought that it was pretty brilliantly acted by Robin Wright in particular, but I thought she was doing the best she could with the material.  It didn't make a lot of sense for her character to suddenly be having this large, obtrusive conscience.  The Claire we knew before was as ruthless as Frank.  It's been quoted a lot, but the best we saw this was the ""I will let that child wither and die inside of you"" line.  This was also seen pretty well with Adam - she threw him away like a soggy tissue.  In season 3, there's just too many moments that don't align with that character.  The blow up at Petrov and the blind faith in the Russian ambassador are the things that come to mind for me at the moment.  I don't think it was impossible for her character to do this - but I really think there needed to be some acclimation for Claire, something that fundamentally changed her.  I just don't think that was in the script.  It felt like she changed to the obstacle the writers wanted her to be.  Overall, I still enjoyed the third season, but nowhere near as much as the first 2.  I think aspects of that may have been intentional by the writers, but overall it just wasn't as enjoyable of an experience to watch.  Instead of seeing Frank and Claire do awful things and still love them for it and want to see what fucked up thing they did next, this season was just kinda meh."
HouseOfCards,31qri8,Grimslayersem,3,Tue Apr 7 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"Very well put. Neither Claire nor Frank were in character in season 3, and we could no longer root for them as ruthless BAMFs because they keep fucking up, and because the power couple that we love are gone."
HouseOfCards,31qri8,AwesomeberryJam,8,Wed Apr 8 15:41:37 2015 UTC,"Season 2 all the way.   Fucking ruthlessness mixed with political maneuvering, to claim the ultimate victory."
HouseOfCards,31qri8,Grimslayersem,3,Tue Apr 7 18:32:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, season 2 was definitely the perfect amalgamation of stubborn ambition and realistic politics, something that was off in season 3. Also they managed to pull off the ""back from the brink of losing it all"" aspect of the story very well.  I have to agree, the Doug storyline in particular was utter crap.  Although I did enjoy the introduction of Jackie Sharp."
HouseOfCards,31qri8,JeddHampton,2,Wed Apr 8 01:01:04 2015 UTC,I enjoy the ending but not exactly the Doug storyline.

Season 2 even demonstrated that Frank had lost his way and had to find himself again.  He ""grew soft"", but the plotting was much more amazing in season 2.  Season 3 shows the character way over his head.  He got what he wanted, but didn't know what to do when he got there."
HouseOfCards,31qri8,itsyourdestini,4,Wed Apr 8 16:01:18 2015 UTC,"Season 1 was my favorite, his character actually made sense, he wasn't ruthless just for fun, but because he needed to be to get what he wanted.   Season 2, lost some of that and made him a little more cartoonish of a villain, but still not bad.   Was he actually in Season 3? From what I recall it was actually the Claire Underwood variety hour."
HouseOfCards,31qri8,aprofondir,3,Tue Apr 7 18:45:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed, season 3 seemed like someone chopped off Frank's balls and replaced them with Claire's earrings.  I honestly thought Petrov was a better embodiment of what season 1-2 Francis Underwood would've been as the President."

In Season 1, Frank had very clear motivations, his actions reflected his personality and he made compromises when required.   My annoyance with Season 2 was how the writers changed him more into a mustache twirling villain. His actions seemed to contradict his previous personality of restrain. He changed from a diplomat with loose morals to someone willing to chew his own leg off to spite someone else.   The less we talk about Season 3 the better, I still visit this subreddit sometimes, but it was so badly written that it just didn't make any sense. It was like a badly written fan fic by someone who's favorite character is Claire."

At first I was bummed out, but then it hit me that maybe the implication is that Frank is less able to show off that side of himself.  Obviously people around him don't see him talking to the audience, but early in the series he was just lurking around making plots and scheming.  But the more in the public eye he is, the less he can get away with it.  That's why alot of his monologues are just a phrase or two, stuck in hastily when he's got a moment alone.  It makes it even more tempting to see him as his persona and startlingly easy to forget the murdering psycho that he is in reality.  Brilliant stuff."
HouseOfCards,31mbyo,teamtywin,86,Tue Apr 7 04:44:40 2015 UTC,"If it wasn't for Frank breaking the 4th wall, the show would just be a more modern version of The West Wing for me.  Besides, who doesn't like Kevin Spacey talking to them?"

I'd love to know who's idea it was to include it as an element - I like the thought that it was Kevin Spacey's, from his experience at the Old Vic.  One of my friends arrived while I was watching an episode of season three. He hadn't seen the show before so tried to watch along but Frank did an eye roll or something to the camera and my friend just said 'I'm out. It's too Miranda'. Miranda is a super old-style sitcom on the BBC where she main character talks to the camera a LOT. And I have to admit, after he said that, I found it hard not to think it next time he did it. All he needs to do is a pratfall and it'll be cemented."

Also, the cost of doing another season increases each year, as you have to offer the existing casts additional money to continue to dedicate their time to the project. Or, you know, kill off the characters and bring in new ones. Unfortunately the samething happens to writers, directors, producers, etc. Too expensive to keep them on, so hire cheaper labor for future seasons."

For example, Game of Thrones is HBO's biggest hit, even more than The Sopranos, and they said they would like it to run for ten seasons, but if the showrunners insist on the original seven-season plan, they admitted they won't interfere.

It only had three seasons as it was based off of a trilogy of books. At the end of the series PM Francis Urquhart is losing polarity during a party leadership contest (similar to a primary if only members of that congressional delegation could vote). Francis' solution to that problem is to start a war in Cyprus, ""his Falklands"". I could see Frank starting a small war in the Jordan river valley to gain popular support in the event of almost losing the primaries or a close general election. American HOC has done everything on a much bigger scale than the British version. I could see it ending with a big war against Russia.   The true ending of the show came as a shock to me but some of you may have already guessed it. I'm not going to spoil it here. You can look it up or watch the BBC version on Netflix."

HouseOfCards,31jkbe,benzimo,2,Mon Apr 6 12:18:26 2015 UTC,"It gained him influence with Terry Womack, who he wanted to use as a replacement for the second highest position in party leadership (the first being Bob Birch). Furthermore he wanted Womack in to pressure Birch into getting the Education Bill through Congress as fast as possible; this was all a ploy to gain the respect and favor of President Walker. That helped him in his later plans to get the VP to leave office, allowing Frank to be selected as a replacement, and ultimately usurp Walker."

HouseOfCards,31jkbe,shiversdownmyspine,3,Mon Apr 6 15:37:05 2015 UTC,"Womack's district also had a military base that was competing with Russo's for funding. Keeping the base in his district meant his constituents would keep their jobs and would re-elect him. Frank needed Womack because he was the head of the Black Caucus (10 black Congressmen) and could provide swing votes to potentially replace Speaker of the House Bob Birch with someone (David Rasmussen, House Majority Leader and second highest in party leadership), who would be more amicable to Frank and the Education Bill.   What ended up happening was Rasmussen didn't want to be involved in the party coup, so Frank went to Birch and lied to him that Rasmussen was the one planning the coup in exchange for getting the Education Bill passed. Birch replaced Rasmussen with Womack to punish Rasmussen."

HouseOfCards,31jkbe,NickTay,2,Mon Apr 6 17:34:12 2015 UTC,"As for your second question, Frank's plan was always to have Russo implode. He wanted the Watershed bill to pass so that Russo would be more confident about his chances for Governor; ultimately, it wasn't that significant of a setback for Frank's plans.  For the third question, Frank & Stamper knew Russo would get drunk and have sex with Rachel (who Russo didn't remember) because Russo was an alcoholic, drug addict, and philanderer. Even people who are in remission can still fall off the wagon if they're presented with enough temptation. Frank & Stamper just made sure they aligned all three in front of Russo at once in a way that he couldn't resist."
HouseOfCards,31k4cx,ConstableBobrovsky,2,Sun Apr 5 21:30:08 2015 UTC,"Birch was at the top of the food chain as Speaker, Rasmusen just below as Majority Leader and then Underwood as Chief Whip. It's not mentioned how long each has had their position but probably a while since Frank's Been Whip for 10 years with no chance to move up. Birch won't play ball so he threatens to push him out with Rasmusen moving up, Rasmusen's reluctance means he's shoved out and replaced with Womack with Birch thinking he's been spared, sending through the education bill. When Underwood moves up to VP Sharp takes the position.  What interests me most is their S3 positions - since Democrats lost their majority The speaker is a republican, Birch becomes minority leader, Womack as Whip and Sharp as assistant Whip - no mention of who the new Speaker is and why Mendoza didn't move up himself"

That would have cost a chunk of change.  Politicians get 'speaking fees' from all sorts of places, universities, businesses and so on. and at least one multimillion dollar book deal, their salary is the least of their income. Bill Clinton made over $13 million dollars, yes over $13,000,000, in 2011 alone from giving speeches. I'm not sure how much of that he gave away to charity, but if Hillary wasn't going to run for president, he was just gonna hang out and be rich, he wouldn't have to give a dime of that money away. This isn't a statement about anyone, it is just to show that an ex-President can make tons of money after they were in office.  Also, ex-presidents get a lifetime pension. $200,000 a year(in 2013) plus nearly $100,000 for a staff. That article also mentions the ex-presidents cost nearly $3.7 million in the previous year, but I presume that factors in all the security they are provided.  edit: This link is from Washingont Post, Bill Clinton earned $104.9 million since 2001 from speeches.

Therefore in House of Cards, the Black Egg symbolizes Claire's abortions to further Frank's political career.  Frank keeping the Black Egg symbolizes the fact that he has total control over Claire and her secrets regarding the abortion, it symbolizes that he has power. Claire's abortions allow Frank to further his political career, but offer no benefit to Claire herself.  Claire was shocked that he kept the egg. As well all know, this show is big on symbolism and double-meanings, and Frank keeping the egg shows that he is not afraid to keep the abortion in his back pocket if Claire gets out of line."

HouseOfCards,31e563,Mershian,19,Sat Apr 4 05:08:43 2015 UTC,"In American presidential races, there are essentially two campaigns; primaries and caucuses, and the general election. Because there is often more than one candidate in each of the two major parties who wants to run for president, they have to be chosen by their party. This is where primaries and caucuses come in. All the candidates in a particular party (in Franks's case, the Democratic Party) run against each other for the nomination. Iowa and New Hampshire are important because they are states with early primaries and caucuses. They're the first test for any campaign. Whoever wins enough votes in each party gets to be that party's nominee for president and run against the other party. Frank is only running for the nomination at this point. He was celebrating his victory in the Iowa caucus. He'll still need to win a number of other states to get the nomination."

Whoever won in Iowa would have had to be the nominee, or else the Dems would have been in-fighting for too long and basically given the Republicans the White House.      I feel like that is part of what happened to Romney in '12.   The race goes on too long, and the Republicans tore each other down more than the incumbent president.

HouseOfCards,317k6s,notthepapa,2,Thu Apr 2 23:09:16 2015 UTC,Never heard about it! This is perfectly timed since i was about to cancel my subscription because i was a bit disappointed with what's on there here in Germany. I also felt kinda ripped of because they sold the broadcast rights for HoC over to Sky and that's the series i subscribed for in the first place. Last time i looked around  - when netflix hadn't been available around here - you needed a US credit card to access the service.

HouseOfCards,317k6s,b1eb,2,Thu Apr 2 23:06:02 2015 UTC,/u/kadwynn proposed the hola extention which is free. I think i'll use that for now and look into private internet access if i need something a bit more serious.

Then we'll grab the phone and post it on instagram!""

HouseOfCards,317k6s,SparkyWarEagle,5,Thu Apr 2 23:08:35 2015 UTC,Would you mind sharing some of the policies you disagree with?
HouseOfCards,317k6s,Reerhy1,7,Thu Apr 2 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"Sure man, although let me preface this by saying I am in no way a poly-sci major, and there's a whole lot of people who know more about politics, economics, and how to run a country, than me, our president included. I'm not saying I could do a better job by any means, and I believe that people should be able to have differing political opinions without being hostile to one another.  So, let's start.  I lean towards the right on most social issues, but not all. I'm pro-life, simply because I think babies shouldn't be killed. I am sympathetic to the fact that women have to carry children for 9 months, and that's a pain in the ass, but other than in instances of rape, pregnancy can be prevented rather than terminated. If you're not careful and you become pregnant because of either failed birth control or the lack of effort to acquire birth control, I get it, that sucks, but it's not the unborn baby's fault. In cases of rape resulting in pregnancy, of course I feel terribly for these women, but I don't think it gives an excuse to take a life. Two wrongs don't make a right, and if you don't want to keep your baby, there are a ton of loving couples who cannot conceive who would love to adopt. As far as possible health issues to the mother, I don't exactly see that as a viable excuse either. If I go to the same boxing gym as someone who has HIV, that may or may not be a health risk to me, because I may or may not contract the virus, but it certainly doesn't give me the right to kill someone. As far as absolute certain life threatening complications, I think doctors should be able to make judgement calls just like they do in any other situation where two lives hang in the balance. Such as deciding who is a more viable candidate for a heart transplant. I'm a firefighter, and one wreck call a few years ago called for some of my coworkers to make a hard decision. Two cars were crashed, one with 3 people inside critically injured, who would die if they weren't removed quickly, and another car with one 16 year old male who was already severely burned, with the car still burning. They only had enough people on scene to save one car. Had they put the burning vehicle out, and managed to remove the 16 year old male, there was slim chance of him living, while the other three would almost certainly die. They chose to cut the three out, sacrificing the one long shot to save the three that they could. Now, say I'm in a car wreck in a similar situation. I look up and see the other driver, and realize we're both critically injured, and both of our cars start to burn as the rescue crew pulls up. I may die because they can't save both of us, they may have to chose to work on him first and I may burn to death as a result. If I pull out a gun and shoot the other driver, giving them only one choice to make, people would be able to understand why I did it, but it wouldn't make it justifiable. Basically, when people use the term ""woman's right to choose"", they are correct. I just wish more people would realize that the ""choice"" is weather or not to take a life, and that no other single person in our society can legally just ""choose"" to take a life.  Moving on to gay marriage, I'll keep this one a whole lot shorter.  I have plenty of gay and lesbian friends, and I think if they want to live a life together, that's none of the government's business. I also think it's none of the government's business if a man and a woman choose to live a life together. I would like to see all marriage unrecognized by the government, not just homosexuals. If you want to visit someone in the hospital and an estranged family says you can't, I think that's wrong, weather you're a lover or just a friend.  Let's move on to non-social issues.  I think obamacare is a good sentiment, and I think anyone who needs health care should be afforded it, although I think there could've been a less radical way to make it happen. I believe the economic impact felt by business owners and your average tax paying citizen is too great, and that's largely in part to how many people don't have jobs, and don't want jobs, but still receive health care. I think that welfare should be drastically cut, and extremely more strict. Just in my own city and state I see people every day who are on welfare and do not want a job. Some of these people come from families who have been on welfare for generations. Do I think we should help people who are down on their luck and absolutely cannot find work? Of course. But as of right now there are way too many people who just take advantage of the system, and taxpayers are left to foot the bill.  Let's move on to foreign policy.  I think Benghazi was a huge clusterfuck, and I believe that anyone who attacks United States citizens should be dealt with swiftly. When it comes to foreign policy, I believe Obama has been far too weak. We know the rest of the world doesn't particularly like us, but they should at least respect us, if not fear us just a little. That goal cannot be achieved by apologizing for America all the time, and taking foreign attacks on American citizens lightly. Do I think we should stick our nose in every single conflict across the globe? Of course not. But at some point you have to fight back, specifically against ISIS.  On the media issues that started this entire post.  I believe a president has the right to have some fun every once in a while, and I don't think he should be serious and stoic 24/7. That being said, it looks really bad when a crisis happens and our president is photographed on a golf course. I understand the guy needs to unwind sometimes, but I think he tends to unwind a little too much and at inopportune moments. I think he should've stayed out of the Trayvon Martin case as it was an ongoing criminal investigation and trial, and I believe that the comments he made were inflammatory and caused more racial tension than there already was. On the other hand I think he should've deployed troops to help handle to mass rioting in Ferguson. Weather you agree with a grand jury decision or not, there's no excuse for the destruction of property and endangering of lives that took place. Police officers were executed in retaliation, and I honestly believe that they might be alive today if not for inflammatory and anti-law enforcement comments made by the president and Al Sharpton.  In summary, I'd just like to restate that I don't have all the answers, I'm not nearly as educated or informed on all of these topics as some others might be, and I may very well be wrong. Sorry it got a little long, and sorry if it's a little all over the place. I'm not the best writer in the world, and I did all of this from the toilet. I know that undoubtedly you have a different opinion than mine on most of these issues, probably, but I would just like to ask that you keep an open mind and take my opinions for what they are, simple opinions, and take them with a grain of salt.  Ps. We can both agree that Stannis is the fucking man."

Is it okay to kill them just because you believe they have no brain activity?? For no other reason, just because they're a burden on you? I'd like to point out that the party of equality and basic human decency is the one equating human lives with that of deer right now.  And yes, doctors and family members pulling the plug on a life that has no chance is my exact point. Is there any one single person who can just decide to end a life for no other reason than that they don't want it to live other than expectant mothers? No medical reasons at all, they're just inconvenienced, so they decide to kill a baby. Can anyone else do that? Not at all.  In conclusion, if you can conclusively prove that a fetus isn't a living thing yet just because it doesn't have memories, then be my guest. Go ahead man. Are we going to start killing Alzheimer's patients next because they don't have memories or emotions?? Go for it boss, see how well that goes over with the American people, see if you win another election if you take that stance."
HouseOfCards,317k6s,pnoozi,-2,Fri Apr 3 07:46:11 2015 UTC,"I am pretty liberal about most things, and I am pro-choice to an extent, but this argument bothers me.   Of course the fetus itself isn't sentient yet. Of course it's just a blob of cells. But it is well on the path to becoming sentient. Fertilization has occurred and, given a few months, that fetus will be a thinking organism. It's just a clump of cells now, but when it is aborted its future is being killed, not it.   I am half asleep, so I didn't argue that eloquently, but I hope you see the gist of what I mean."

HouseOfCards,317k6s,pnoozi,-1,Fri Apr 3 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"That's not at all in line with what I said, hombre. I only consider a fertilized, soon-to-be born human fetus to fall within that grey area. When the circumstances have led to that spark of reproduction to take shape is what I am talking about. My logic ends at the gestating human. Before that are merely the building blocks to potentially create a lifeform - nothing more."

I'm not talking about military intervention though we should have a response ready, not something from the cold war era, the sanctions need to be even stronger. Take it completely to the ground. To do that we should crack open the strategic oil reserve."
HouseOfCards,317k6s,CyberianSun,3,Fri Apr 3 02:10:50 2015 UTC,"But I am a firm believer that competition breeds excellence.   Competition is great but it is not practical in every scenario. For example, you don't have multiple water and sewage pipes going to your residence because the infrastructure redundancy simply wouldn't work. The history of competing firefighters is well documented.  Or in the case of healthcare, many rural residents don't have multiple hospitals to choose from (to create competition): http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/america_s_hospitals_our_system_lets_big_hospitals_charge_exorbitant_prices.html"

Rural health care is a truly interesting problem. But my point is classifying the internet as a utility puts it, at least by name, in the same category as water, sewage, and others it worries me that companies will view it as a non competitive and abandon any attempt to make the services better. Granted not that comcast was actually making their services good at all. And I would know I live in the shadow of the comcast tower."

We all know your time is precious, but having the POTUS step away from the house of cards that is DC politics and jumping into the scrum of the American public questioning is refreshing.  My question revolves around your recent publicity attempts. Your appearance on The Colbert Report was a nice twist in this day and age, but do you feel like Colbert might have gotten the best of you in this instance? Your typically stoic demeanor was flushed away at his satirical questioning at points.  Furthermore, it has been rumored that you have been working on an autobiography with an unnamed author. Care to disclose anything regarding this project, and will your lovely wife Claire be involved in this project in any way?

He did get many of his facts right, the unemployment, the approval ratings, the trade deficit, etc. However the point I was making was to not focus on the past, and to worry more of the future. And the future is AmWorks. The program can work, has already proven itself in Washington D.C., and will bring unemployment and deficit down significantly. That to me speaks for itself.  In response to your second question, I have been dabbling with the idea of an autobiography. However I have not put enough thought into it to even think about who I would hire for such a thing, nor has Claire formally pledged any of her time towards such a project."

There are many intricate details of how the United States could have responded differently that are classified, but what I can say is: we were not limited by our ability as a nation to respond, we were limited by a lack of communication between the United States and the Russian Federation, something I take personal responsibility for and have since taken great care to rebuild."

If you couldn't get 10 signatures, there was some penalty (I can't offhand recall what it was).  Problem was, people on welfare would figure out which businesses weren't hiring and go there for signatures.  Over time, they figured out which businesses would sign their papers month-after-month, no questions asked.  Most people who had been on welfare for a while could walk around town and have their whole sheet filled in a day.  I guess my point is, people will always figure out how to game the system, both the rich and the poor.

HouseOfCards,30xwxp,autowikibot,4,Tue Mar 31 22:35:58 2015 UTC,"Job guarantee:       A job guarantee (JG) is an economic policy proposal aimed at providing a sustainable solution to the dual problems of inflation and unemployment. Its aim is to create full employment and price stability. It is related to the concept of employer of last resort (ELR).   The economic policy stance currently dominant around the world uses unemployment as a policy tool to control inflation; when cost pressures rise, the standard monetary policy carried out by the monetary authority (central bank) tightens interest rates, creating a buffer stock of unemployed people, which reduces wage demands, and ultimately inflation. When inflationary expectations subside, these people will get their jobs back. In Marxian terms, the unemployed serve as a reserve army of labor. By contrast, in a job guarantee program, a buffer stock of employed people (employed in the job guarantee program) provides the same protection against inflation without the social costs of unemployment, hence (it is argued) fulfilling the dual mandate of full employment and price stability.

In songs one doesn't necessarily need to experience the exact same thing, but can interpret it for himself, and still feel a connection with the artist/song. I think same goes for other types of art. Sure maybe it's all a big coincidence(in the case of HoC S3 symbolism I don't think it is), but even if it's not what the artist meant, if it deepens our understanding for the character thus making us feel for the character where's the harm?

HouseOfCards,30u4xv,Dr_Toast,4,Tue Mar 31 05:02:58 2015 UTC,"But sometimes, like with the case of the black egg above and the monks art, there really is symbolism there. Especially in a show like this where everything is so meticulously planned and executed."

HouseOfCards,30u4xv,TheGruesomeTwosome,9,Mon Mar 30 20:26:39 2015 UTC,"I thought of the sand mandala was about legacy.  Frank and Claire realize their lives are only so long, and since they have no children their best chance to be remembered is to achieve something glorious and magnificent.  Just like how that mandala only existed for a few weeks or months, but it made such an impression on people that it ""lives on"" in their memories.    I like the other interpretations mentioned here as well though.  I think there is a lot of significance wrapped up in that piece.  Even the relentless grating sounds and chanting gave the whole episode a feeling like something was slipping away."
HouseOfCards,30u4xv,SJCrusader,7,Tue Mar 31 02:04:49 2015 UTC,"IIRC, it was Frank who wanted a photo of the mandala. Not only do I think this is incredibly congruent to his character as a whole, but if we're interpreting it as his legacy it could also be linked to Walker's inauguration speech ([paraphrased] ""And who will they see waving at the edge of the screen?""). Somebody smarter than me could run with this further. Blah blah not just legacy but an image of it which remains tangible."

I try to keep my Facebook comments short and sweet, because I know I don't go on Facebook to read huge chunks of text, and just assume most other people are in the same boat."
HouseOfCards,30u4xv,slaya45,4,Mon Mar 30 23:25:46 2015 UTC,"I had a similar thought after this scene. Frank has been pursuing the presidency this whole time, every detail is perfect, all of his hard work has gone to execution. Claire only sees the finished art because she's the only one who realizes there is an end to it. Once Frank leaves office, he will have hit his peak, and will have no other reason to exist. The art is to show that no matter how much detail, time, and hard work you put in, everything is temporary, hence why they just immediately wipe it up and cast it in to a river. Frank sees no end game, his scope ends at the presidency, and Claire wants more, she wants a real child, hence all of the egg symbolism."
HouseOfCards,30u4xv,TheGruesomeTwosome,3,Mon Mar 30 19:58:02 2015 UTC,and then you have it where frank was so busy he basically missed the whole process... also kinda alluding to their marriage

Without the relationship, there is no career (because they help each other climb the ladder) and without the career (Presidency) there is no relationship (because a big part of why Claire was with Frank in the first place was the promise of power.)"

Breaking Bad's odds for renewal weren't hot for its first several years, but that didn't stop the writers from designing cliffhangers.  It's actually the exception for shows to know ahead of time when they're going to end, at least historically.  That said, I doubt there's any reason to worry about House of Cards unless Spacey and Wright decide they don't want to do the show.  I'm sure Netflix is happy with the show's performance.

Just another example of a life that can be destroyed by getting mixed up with the wrong people at the wrong time.   A lot of people hate on the Rachel storyline, but I liked it. To me, she is also a symbol of the shit women around the world have to put up with, even though I am sure that was not the show's intentions. I actually cried real tears in the last episode. :("

I actually really cared about her character especially when she said she just wanted to go somewhere and be invisible. She got caught up in something so beyond her, it wasn't any of her own fault and I hated the fact that she was killed for it."
HouseOfCards,30xcy0,pewqokrsf,3,Thu Apr 2 15:29:11 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people are missing what Rachel meant in the third season specifically, beyond just ""Doug backstory"".  We see Doug flirt with betraying the Underwoods several times, starting pretty early when he doesn't destroy the journal.  The closure with Rachel was Doug destroying the last vestiges of traitorous thoughts.  It's all part of Frank's orchestra of waxing and waning loyalties; the same moment he lost Claire, he gained back Doug."

Everything about them is strange and unorthodox, so it reflects that into their sex lives. Here is the article where they talk a little about it: http://time.com/how-tv-sex-got-real/  It didn't contribute anything to their plots but like many of Claire's random scenes of the homeless man doing origami, running through the cemetery, etc., it's just more things that are telling to their characters.

HouseOfCards,30xo41,moremysterious,0,Tue Mar 31 20:51:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I do have a problem with sexual content. I usually fast forward when it comes up in HoC. Relative to the kind of stuff I usually watch, HoC is really dirty, so it made me wonder, GoT can't possibly be much worse than this, can it? Apparently it is. I'm sure GoT has a good story and production, but ehhh... I don't enjoy movies or tv with explicit sex scenes."
HouseOfCards,30xo41,moremysterious,13,Wed Apr 1 00:33:47 2015 UTC,"That's fair. Yeah they are a lot more casual about it in GOT, they will be discussing things while people are naked and whatnot, so unfortunately it might not be for you. Do you mind me asking why it bothers you so much? Not judging, just genuinely curious."
HouseOfCards,30xo41,Karlzone,4,Wed Apr 1 00:56:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for asking so respectfully. I'd be happy to share.  I view sex as an awesome, wonderful, truly profound thing. It's something deeper than just a physical sensation or an explosion of dopamine in the brain. I believe that sex reaches its greatest value when it's a manifestation of earnest commitment and self-sacrificing love, and anything less is cheaper and emptier than what a human being deserves to have. So when sex is used casually, selfishly, or for getting power over someone else, to me it's like playing football on a veteran's memorial. A poor analogy, I know, since sex is supposed to be extremely enjoyable while memorials are sombre places. Maybe a better analogy would be taking a kid to a theme park for a day, and believing that the short, fleeting fun was all there is to parenthood. My point is, I think sex should be treated with a great deal of respect and gentleness, as something pure rather than dirty, as something that flourishes when integrated and putrefies when isolated.   This view is not about proud prudishness; it's all about ascribing value to one of the most important parts of life. It's about saying, ""There's so much more to this that everyone is missing out on. This could be so much better.""  Now, I do understand that in places of power like Washington, crazy sexual intrigue happens all the time. HoC's story would be rather incomplete without showing this and its consequences on the characters. This is what real life is like on the Hill, and HoC's accuracy is one of its good attributes. Storytelling is important. However, I would much rather they always use implicit rather than explicit cinematography and sound to communicate those parts of the story to the audience, which is certainly possible to do.   If you've gotten this far, sorry for rambling on so long and getting philosophical on you. :) Thanks for reading."
HouseOfCards,30xo41,begintobeginagain,8,Wed Apr 1 04:11:49 2015 UTC,"I must admit I don't really understand your problem with it. It's not like a sex scene in a movie will ruin sex for you irl.   Anyhow many sex scenes in GoT are somewhat important, as they help explain the motivations of the characters well. As for other miscellaneous nudity, a lot of it is people just casually walking around like moremysterious said. The whores (profession) in the GoT universe wouldn't really feel embarrassed by nudity, so those scenes only make sense.  I find that the scenes aren't really anything that detract from the experience, rather they make the GoT universe feel more real."

That said, my theory is that once he became president, he felt he no longer needed to be stronger. And in the vein of ""knock on wood"" luck, he no longer needed the extra help. The whole theme of the season was that now that he was president, he had it all figured out, but this stoic solitude became his downfall, alienating those who got him there.  As for breaking the fourth wall, it's the same thing: he stood alone, alienating those who were with him on his rise to power.

HouseOfCards,30q30l,coz707,6,Sun Mar 29 22:00:47 2015 UTC,"One theory has been proposed is that the entire series is actually the acting out of the book that the author is writing in S3.  Some have suggested that the reason FU seems so different is because S3 is the part of the book from Claire's perspective.  This could be the reason that she knocks in S3 instead of Frank.  It could also be why Frank seemed so different, because S1 & S2 were from Frank's perspective but S3 is from Claire's.    It's not a perfect theory and has holes but I kinda like thinking about it like this."

HouseOfCards,30rd9v,brodog6393,7,Mon Mar 30 01:32:02 2015 UTC,The seasons should stand up on their own and shouldn't be excused as simple set-up for the next season. I don't agree that we should be content with a 'calmer' season just in hope for an even crazier next season. Nothing major happened in this season- especially in the investigative corner of the Zoe/Russo storylines. A lot that happened in this season was filler and it wasn't even subtle
HouseOfCards,30rd9v,janiqua,3,Mon Mar 30 14:13:34 2015 UTC,TV shows must also be released week after week and not all at once.

Since when is it protocol for shows to intentionally create ""calmer"" less intense seasons for the sake of ""setting up"" for crazier seasons?

HouseOfCards,30rd9v,DivinusVox,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:01:34 2015 UTC,"Season 3 might be my favorite.  The way Frank loses his edge, Claire loses her trust, the government gets so tight at the Underwoods, the lack of 4th wall breaking and knocks on wood, and the COMPLETE lack of appearances from Walker, Matthews, Tusk, Lucas, not even a MENTION of Zoe or Russo. I'm serious it's like they made 13 hour long teases. I love it.       It was nothing but let downs performed in a gorgeous, stunning way. It was a set up in a way, but what the hell yous guys the show is called HOUSE OF CARDS, it is fragile, it takes a lot of setting up. The way I see it in terms of the whole 'contextual season' vs. 'stand alone' is like in a song, this season is sort of the break down, the decrescendo or the part where it gets softer. Not only in itself is it beautiful in it's melancholy and desperation, but you can rest assured it's getting us just ready for season 4 to knock our frikking skulls out of our brains. Also, as for the whole, TV seasons should not be released at once thing, film is like water or air, it takes the volume of its container. Modern streaming allows for film to take this new approach, which I think is a good mix of compelling, consistent, deep and rewatchable."

This allowed Frank to make power plays and get himself selected as interim Vice President.  As for why Frank killed him, Peter drunkenly turned himself in for the whole Rachel Posner/DUI incident.

Always remember that it's fictionalized. There's a joke in our office - one that's also made the rounds in offices around the country and even in DC - that we like to think we're cast members in House of Cards but our lives are more similar to an episode of Veep.  The one thing I am happy with is that you recognize that these institutional politicians are actually people too. The one thing I hate about Reddit is the eagerness to paint all politicians with a broad brush - as liars, philanderers, sociopaths, cheats, thieves, sellouts, etc. It's quite eye-opening when you hear a sitting Congressperson open up to you on an individual level about the frustrations of their personal and family life and admit that they are just absolutely exhausted with it all. Many of us forget that we all live multiple lives and that the face we wear for the public and for our professional lives doesn't always represent who we are behind closed doors and who we are with our friends and families.  Anyway, sorry for my rant. Enjoy the rest of your HoC binge. It can be a doozy."

HouseOfCards,30dch6,paulbmccoy,7,Thu Mar 26 13:33:23 2015 UTC,House of Cards has a writing problem. It has nothing to do with Claire specifically or women in general.
HouseOfCards,30dch6,_sundry,4,Thu Mar 26 14:02:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed. They should have trimmed out some of the fat (Rachel story-line anybody?) and put more time around the turning point for Claire.   Was it when she woke up to the hanging? It was like all of a sudden she's changed as a person and now Frank and the viewers are left trying to wrap their heads around this. They did a good job of conveying her internal conflict, but I never understood how it started considering season two ended with her telling Frank to ""Seduce him. Give him your heart. Cut it out and put it in his fucking hands""."
HouseOfCards,30dch6,NeilMJ,11,Thu Mar 26 17:49:06 2015 UTC,"There was that moment when Claire broke down on the staircase after talking to Ms. Walker. But still.   Honestly my biggest problem with the show is that nothing is even the slightest bit realistic anymore... For example, there just isn't enough ""going on"" in the White House. Like, there should be a deluge of people coming and going, meeting after meeting with issue after issue. Bill on top of bill. There should always be a sense of urgency and clusterfuck that the President has to wrangle. I don't see that in HoC. There's just Frank, Claire, Cathy, and the Chief of Staff (now Doug)... where is all of Walker's old staff? Where are the idealists, the passionate staffers, the secretaries, the assistants-to-everyone? Shouldn't we see an army of people who are actually trying to achieve something? (Maybe some of them who don't trust Frank after what happened to Walker?)   More than that, the only issues we are exposed to are Russia, the Jordan Valley, AmWorks and the hurricane that never happened. (And none of those make any sense --- okay, the hurricane was plausible!)   Just really disappointing. When Frank went from the House of Representatives to the White House, we should have noticed that he went from a tiny, insular world of shadows and intrigue to something completely different. BANG! People everywhere! Gone is Frank's loyal staff of minions... now he has 4 secretaries, 2 personal assistants, a Chief of Staff, an Assistant Chief of Staff, a Communications Director (who himself has 3 assistants...) And all of these people should be pushing different agendas. Not to mention the rest of Frank's cabinet (which should be Walker's old cabinet.)  And Claire, as First Lady, should have had her own office, her own chief of staff, her own secretaries, her own gaggle of assistants, etc. She should have had a packed schedule before she even started.   It should have all fallen on them like a tsunami. Then, maybe, the friction between the President and First Lady would have been more believable. It's doesn't work to just TELL us that Frank and Claire are stressed out and tired. You have to SHOW us why!   Anyway. Instead we got that awful biographer following Frank around... and a bond-villain as the season's antagonist. (The fact that fake-Putin was actually one of my favorite parts of Season 3 really says something about the quality of everything else! )"
HouseOfCards,30dch6,_sundry,4,Thu Mar 26 18:00:39 2015 UTC,You're right. The decline in quality was pretty dramatic. Did the writing staff change this season or did they just lose their way?
HouseOfCards,30dch6,NeilMJ,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:33:14 2015 UTC,You bring up great points. Not sure why I never wondered where all of the people were.
HouseOfCards,30dch6,shiftybear,2,Fri Mar 27 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea that the UN ambassador fiasco was simply to make Claire look incompetent so as to seem inferior to Frank.  They made her look incompetent  because that's realistic when you put someone in a critical position when they lack the experience to do the job!  You don't hire someone to drive a semi truck just because they've driven a car before, and you think they're smart. People have been critical of the show for realism, but the Russians playing Claire was one of the realist parts of the show."
HouseOfCards,30dch6,HazMat68W,2,Thu Mar 26 19:15:26 2015 UTC,Seconded. It also was to move forward to tearing up their marriage. She's no use to sitting on the sidelines...and will lead her to fight back in the next season.
HouseOfCards,30dihe,theunicorn,4,Thu Mar 26 14:27:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, noticed that too. It sounded like he had a bad cold for the rest of the season, perhaps something foreboding."
HouseOfCards,30dihe,Sleepy_Fredde,5,Thu Mar 26 19:25:36 2015 UTC,"A lot of people think he has lung cancer because it cuts to an X-ray picture of a lung taken by Jackie's doctor-husband directly after that scene. I've also seen suggestions that Kevin Spacey had a bad cold during filming, or that Frank's voice is going hoarse from all the campaign speeches he's been doing."
HouseOfCards,30dihe,Maplekey,2,Thu Mar 26 20:13:49 2015 UTC,"I believe Claire was also sick towards the beginning of the season with some sort of cold, mild or whatever."
HouseOfCards,30dihe,artyfoul,2,Thu Mar 26 22:23:39 2015 UTC,"There are so many iconic scenes involving cigarettes throughout the first and second season, in the third its used as a reaction to stress rather than achievement.

Imho, she was a character who had believable moral crises in the White House... and she handled them the way a professional, intelligent, flawed human being would. Even when I disagreed with CJ, I always respected her for considering the moral implications of the Bartlet administration's policies, and for having the courage to voice dissent to her peers and sometimes even the President himself.   I wish the HoC writers had taken a similar approach with Claire. As much as I enjoy Claire's emotionally stunted journey through the highest echelons of power and privilege, she needs a bit of Claudia-Jean Cregg in her. (Don't we all?) And tbh, there were times when CJ could have used a bit of Claire's fashion sense... then again that might have just been the 90s in general needing a fashion miracle :/   http://i.imgur.com/Khi7TG0.jpg"

The full quote goes    I have always believed power is more important than money but when it comes to elections, money gives power, well, a run for its money.   And you can see that previously in the show he's always tried to have the leverage on people to make them do as he wishes, just look at how he dealt with Raymond Tusk.  But now he's out of power so his only real option is to try to get as much money to make it look like he's got the power because nobody is gonna elect a weak president."

However in Season 3, when it comes to any sort of election in the USA, money is an absolute necessity as deep pockets are required to run a campaign. Commercials, transport, venue rentals, robo calls, polls, focus groups, campaign headquarters and salaries etc etc.  Money is now on equal footing with power."
HouseOfCards,30a6yg,teems,3,Wed Mar 25 20:00:29 2015 UTC,Not really about money but who controls it. This is evident in Frank's Jobs Bill and executive actions. He even tells Tusk this.   Add up all your billions together and you get the GDP of Slovakia. I have the Federal Government of the United States of America. Your money doesn't intimidate me. The most that you can buy is influence. But I wield Constitutional authority.
HouseOfCards,30a6yg,bell37,2,Thu Mar 26 04:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, idioms are difficult for non-native speakers of any language, especially when they're further convoluted by clever wording.  The phrase ""to give [something] a run for its money"" refers to another ""thing"" sort of challenging the superiority or efficacy of that [something], to the extent that the [something's] ongoing superior status is not guaranteed and/or requires some exertion of effort to demonstrate its continued superiority.  In this case, Frank has told us before that having power is superior to having money, in terms of being a more effective and valuable tool. However, in American political elections, having and acquiring huge sums of money has become a basic requirement to even start or run an effective election campaign. So, even though he generally still favors having just power over having just money, he's admitting that money can actually be better to have than power, when it comes to running a successful election campaign that will allow him to maintain power.  And if you think that's a mindfuck, that's because it is a mindfuck."
HouseOfCards,30c6gr,Dougmartin22,2,Thu Mar 26 04:11:02 2015 UTC,"The original house of cards (the UK version) was heavily themed with macbeth in mind, the wife was more manipulative of francis and the whole betrayal and ""you should be king/prime minister/president"" thing was a bit more obvious. In the UK version, for example, Francis monologues how useless all of the members of his party are and his wife is actually the one who says ""What about you?""."

I noticed this in the very first scene, when he was signing a book.  He puts nothing into the character.  Nothing.  Every scene felt like a dry read of the script.  The absolute worst is when he gets into a fight with the Baldwin reporter.  What was that last thing he said before he slammed the door?  Gawd, it was awful.  Cheesy, cliche, awful."
HouseOfCards,307i5f,Styrophoams,8,Wed Mar 25 02:17:56 2015 UTC,Season 3 was underwhelming and a little too slow for my taste
HouseOfCards,307i5f,H2Oreo,4,Wed Mar 25 03:36:47 2015 UTC,"It was weird having Frank as President. It felt rushed, but then again I did binge watch the series. Either way, it still felt less believable and thus, less gripping for me."
HouseOfCards,307i5f,GaberhamTostito,2,Wed Mar 25 04:57:48 2015 UTC,"Just finished, I wouldn't dare come here until I did. I have to agree, season 3 focused far too much on personal relationships (Frank and Claire, Jackie and Remy, etc etc) but I suppose that was inevitable after Frank's hunger for power was satisfied. I'm sure that I'm late to the party and this sentiment has probably been expressed here plenty already, but season 3 just didn't have me on the edge of my seat the way the first two did."
HouseOfCards,307i5f,BanjoKaBOOM,2,Wed Mar 25 06:39:19 2015 UTC,Beau Willimon has stated that they chose to go this route for season 3. They wanted to focus more on the characters and their dilemmas this season. They also wanted Frank to struggle this season because they wanted to examine how a team that's so used to playing in the shadows is now in the world's biggest spotlight. It has a different feel and that was on purpose. They didn't want to replicate the past two seasons.
HouseOfCards,307i5f,thedonhudson01,2,Thu Mar 26 22:22:47 2015 UTC,"Yup.  It's like the writers lost their nerve, and felt they had to do the audience the charity of reminding us that ""Frank is the bad guy, and you shouldn't be rooting for him, mmmmkay?""  I don't think I'm alone in saying a lot of the appeal of HoC was enjoying Frank's battles and scheming as a kind of guilty pleasure."

HouseOfCards,307i5f,bitrollar,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:37:59 2015 UTC,"I hear this sentiment a lot, but I counter with this: the show is called House of Cards, implying that Frank will fall. In order to really set that up and have it hurt, I believe that additional intertwining relationships were necessary. I'm excited to see what Season 4 holds!"
HouseOfCards,30b7fr,ChemicallyBlind,7,Wed Mar 25 23:19:36 2015 UTC,"Frank championed this bill to raise the age of retirement to ""save"" Social Security. If this happened in real life, the Republicans would LOVE it. However, in this world, the Republicans don't want the President to gain any political capital, so they refuse to cooperate. Even though they like the bill, they want to take credit for it.  Frank has Mendoza and the mainstream Republicans ready to cooperate, but apparently this Tea Party leader is a huge hard-ass and everyone in the Tea Party listens to him. So Mendoza bends over and tells the rest of the Republicans to filibuster.  Frank says fuck that and gets enough Republicans to agree to allow the Senate to vote on the bill. (In the Senate, you have to vote to vote on something. You need 60 of 100 to allow a vote, but only 51 to pass something.) Mendoza and the Tea Party dude realize what's up, so they tell the rest of their party to bail so that the Democrats don't have a quorum. (In a legislative body, you have to have a certain number of people present in order to be able to do anything. That number is a quorum.)  Frank, as the Vice President, is the President of the Senate and presides over the Senate except when he doesn't need to, which is usually. He busts in there and tells the President Pro Tempore (President whenever Frank isn't there) to scram, and he tries to get the roll called quickly so that there is a quorum.  The Republicans manage to leave before they call enough names for a quorum, so Frank orders the Sergeant-at-Arms to arrest any Senator refusing to appear in the Senate. This is Frank's right to do so as President of the Senate, and though it's rare, it happened in 1941 when there was a filibuster of a civil-rights bill. So, the Republicans try to hide in their offices to avoid arrest, but eventually Frank gets enough of them to appear in the Senate ""under protest"" to get a quorum, vote the bill through, and avoid arresting anyone."

HouseOfCards,30b7fr,Dr_ChimRichalds,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:42:00 2015 UTC,"There was no official record of leadership telling them to skip. Also I might be mistaken but the warrant for arrests are only to collect the missing members back for roll call and vote. Once a quorum is met the warrants are dropped and arrested members are released. Plus I am sure if they got outside Washington DC, no local law enforcement entity outside DC would really want to devote man hours to find senators not present."

Recovering from an experience like that and being a former alcoholic, Frank knew Doug must've been in a bad place and didn't want to put any unnecessary pressure on him that could jeopardize his mental health even further. Remember when called up Heather Dunbar about her giving Doug a job? He threatened her for being a potential threat to Doug's successful recovery by doing so. Frank cares about Doug.

Frank Underwood's approval rating was somewhere in the high 50% range.  Obama's approval rating is somewhere in the mid 40% range.

HouseOfCards,305gkk,perdidaum,10,Tue Mar 24 17:14:01 2015 UTC,"As far as I know the whip is to help convince other members of their party to vote for or against legislation based on the party line.  Frank is trying to win the nomination for his party for the national election for president. Each state hold their own primary elections. So he is running against other members of his party and based on those results, the Democrats will select a candidate to run for president. The Republicans would be holding their own primary elections to select their own candidate."
HouseOfCards,305gkk,greenkey901,7,Tue Mar 24 17:30:36 2015 UTC,"It just happens to be tradition that Iowa and New Hampshire are the first two states to hold primary elections (or caucuses). Because they come first, the results in those states are extremely important to the selection of each party's national candidate.  However, Frank's nomination is not guaranteed until the party convention. He needs a majority of convention votes to be nominated, and without a majority, the door is open for all sorts of back room deal making (involving trading votes for favors) to select the candidate."
HouseOfCards,305gkk,ikefalcon,2,Tue Mar 24 22:38:57 2015 UTC,"And do they have primary elections in every state? but only a few, like iowa and new hampshire are important enough for they to go there?"
HouseOfCards,305gkk,ikefalcon,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:08:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, every state, and all of the US Territories (even though they can't vote in the general election). Usually the nominee will be clear after the first few states, though, so the last ones don't matter so much."
HouseOfCards,305gkk,ikefalcon,5,Thu Mar 26 23:12:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Whip's job is to gather votes.  The 2nd highest ranking representative from each party in each house of Congress is the Whip. The Majority and Minority Leaders are each the 1st highest ranking for their party in that house of Congress.  The exception is that the majority party in the House of Representatives (lower house) elects their leader to be the Speaker of the House (presiding officer). Then the 2nd moves up to Majority Leader and the 3rd moves up to Majority Whip. So, in Season 1, Frank is the 3rd highest ranking Democrat in the House.  This doesn't happen in the Senate (upper house) because the Vice President is the presiding officer there. We see Frank preside over the Senate in season 2. In practice, the Vice President rarely goes to the Senate unless he needs to cast a tiebreaking vote. The Senate elects a presiding officer (President Pro Tempore of the Senate), who presides whenever the Vice President isn't there.  Fun fact: The Speaker and President Pro Tempore are 2nd and 3rd behind the Vice President in terms of presidential succession, followed by the Secretary of State."
HouseOfCards,305gkk,partytemple,2,Tue Mar 24 22:49:02 2015 UTC,I would also like to add that whips are like maj/min leaders' assistants getting their agenda accomplished. The Vice President may be the most useless high-ranking official. The VP doesn't do much in Congress or in the executive branch.
HouseOfCards,305gkk,moose2332,1 point,Thu Mar 26 05:19:32 2015 UTC,The whip's job is to make sure people in his or her party vote for the bills drafted by their party and convise the other party to do the same.   Your other question can be answered in this video www.youtube.com/watch?v=_95I_1rZiIs

HouseOfCards,3060ar,great9rejects,4,Tue Mar 24 20:07:07 2015 UTC,Everyone was skeptical of Amworks at first. After he put Amworks into effect many Republicans changed sides on the issue. Frank says in I think episode 10 or 11 that many democrats and republicans have come out in support of Amworks.

HouseOfCards,3060ar,DavidSSD,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:42:13 2015 UTC,I would guess Republicans would see AmWorks as a welfare state initiative when implemented. The idea of taking money from the government/people and then giving it to other people would give a socialist vibe to it.
HouseOfCards,3060ar,Feuersturm-CA,1 point,Wed Mar 25 05:41:31 2015 UTC,"Give a socialist vibe? It is 100% socialism. You take tax money (from taxpayers, most the tax revenue from whom are in the higher tax brackets) and create non-necessary jobs for the unemployed. IIRC some people on the show were talking about how they were employing more grounds keepers and low-profile jobs than was actually needed (not explicitly said, just inferred.)  It is socialist. Now, depending on your societal views...this could be either a good thing or a bad thing."

HouseOfCards,304sjl,Ramady,6,Tue Mar 24 14:53:49 2015 UTC,Didn't Kevin spacey say in an interview that it was fairly accurate about how dirty politics are and that they(politicians) were terrible actors. In the interview they were asking him about his time shadowing actual politicians.
HouseOfCards,304sjl,smoothblueglue,2,Tue Mar 24 17:26:31 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen that interview. If you can link it, I'd certainly be interested in taking a look.  In my experience, most politicians are trying to strike some balance between leaving a legacy and doing good. It's not nearly as cutthroat as HoC tries to make it seem, because at the end of the day you're stuck with the same 535 elected officials for your entire term. You won't get very far by having a reputation of just fucking over everybody you come across."

Pulling some of the shit they do in this show would be political suicide, because (unlike Frank's foils) real opponents aren't completely inept."
HouseOfCards,304sjl,Ramady,4,Tue Mar 24 18:43:45 2015 UTC,"Watch House of Cards then watch The West Wing, you'll find your motivation somewhere in between.

I don't get it. I love both shows, and feel like between the two you get something that's not so overtly (and admittedly) idealized and yet not suicidally cynical. Not being a Washington insider, I can't comment on which one is closer to the objective reality...."

It is no accident that Viktor Petrov quotes Leo Tolstoy:  ""If you want to be happy, be.""  And that Claire is having a moral awakening, partly inspired by Corrigan's refusal to act like a politician.  About Leo Tolstoy, a man born into the upper class only to give it up for something of a life of asceticism. A pacifist, a Christian anarchist, etc. I am sure that the creators of HoC have read Tolstoy and his personality permeates its way through season three mainly in the idea that the quest for power is meaningless and the only thing worth doing in life is loving your fellow man."

Because he's the President, it's all but 30 seconds before she rips her clothes off and drops to her knees. All in all, it goes... okay.   The next morning, the impossible happens. Claire returns to him! But wait. She has a condition. Claire presents Frank with an 18-page letter (front and back!)   Before they can move forward as a couple, it's important that he read her letter and give her an answer to the question she asks at the end of it. ""Read it now, Francis,"" Claire says. ""I'll be in my bedroom.""   Frank is exhausted from his long night of debauchery (and, of course, the subsequent murder of the copy girl and disposal of her body), so he falls asleep and doesn't finish reading the whole letter.   ...  ""Well... does it, Francis?"" Claire asks hopefully.   ""Huh?"" Frank snorts and lifts his head from the kitchen table. One of the pages of Claire's letter is stuck to his forehead. He snatches it off and tries to seem alert. ""What?""   Claire slides into the seat next to him with a cup of hot coffee. She stares at him intently. ""We can't go to New Hampshire until you answer this very important question from my letter. You did read it, right?""   ""Of course.""   ""Because it seemed you might have fallen asleep.""   ""I wasn't asleep.""   ""I thought maybe you stayed up all night. Maybe with that xerox girl from the mail room?""   ""Don't be ridiculous, Claire. Nobody says xerox anymore.""   ""And I noticed that dirty shovel laying on the floor of your study...""  ""Just a little midnight gardening.""  ""Uh-huh.""  ""I missed you. And when I miss you, I feel like... gardening. It clears my head.""    ""I don't care that you killed her. But you shouldn't leave the shovel out like that.""  ""I'll have Doug take care of it.""   Claire looks like she might be getting a headache. She rubs her temples. ""So you read the letter?""   ""Of course I read the letter, my little peach. I love you so much, I read it twice.""   ""Then? Francis? ...Does it?""  Frank bites his lower lip. He really, really has to get to New Hampshire. ""Does it? Well. Uh... I would have to say... It... uhm... it does?""    Claire smiles. She knew he'd come around! ""Oh, Francis! That's wonderful! I'm so sorry about yesterday. I'll get dressed right away and we'll lock up the democratic ticket, together!""   Claire rushes off. The minute she's gone, Frank frantically pores through her letter. ""Does it?"" he mumbles... ""Does it?""... ""What? No...""      Francis, as long as you can accept full responsibility for the Jordan Valley crisis, and admit that you were completely wrong about Michael Corrigan, and make me your Vice Presidential candidate on the 2016 ticket... then I think we can move past this difficult stage in our marriage. But I have to know, Francis. Does this sound like something you can do? Well... does it?      White-knuckled, Frank crumples the paper in two tight fists and yells maniacally, ""IT. SO. DOES.

The Ukrainian leader decided to sign a trade agreement with Russia, Belarus and Kazhakstan instead of with the European Union. Now there's scarsely a Lenin state in Ukraine (Except for in the East) and the former Ukrainian president, Victor Yanukovych, has fled to Russia somewhere and it was announced today that his son has just died. Just because of a trade agreement.   Additionally, you have to look at all the other revolutions in recent Russian histori. In 1991 the entire Soviet Union collapsed dramatically and become capitalist because the leader (Gorbachev) decided to make a fear reforms (Glanost and Perestroika) at the peripheries. It led to the entire country falling apart and the the Soviet Union essentially losing the Cold War.   If you go back not even 100 years, you'll also see that the Tsar's (~King) reluctance to appease the masses led to an uprising of the Proletarian masses and the death of the Tsar's entire family and the transformation of Russia from the Russian Empire with a royal family, to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.   So yeah, I think Petrov is very accurate when he says that when a new person takes control, it's not a smooth transition like it is in the West, but instead blood flows and statues are toppled."
HouseOfCards,2zwkhc,dragonfangxl,4,Sun Mar 22 23:06:38 2015 UTC,There was a lot more at stake in Ukraine then just a trade agreement. That agreement was symbolic that the Ukrainian government was just a Russian pawn and wasn't seeking to become part of the European community. It was just the straw that broke the camel's back after years of increasing internal tension.

HouseOfCards,2zwkhc,xbettel,11,Sun Mar 22 18:51:13 2015 UTC,"Well thats a load of crap. A gay pride parade in new york is not only allowed but celebrated and encouraged by city officials. A gay pride parade in moscow results in massive protests, bomb threats, and knife wielding sociopaths. Russia has a total ban on gay marriage which is enforced nation wide.  This paper is interesting, mainly because it is so well formatted, but the numerous typos and there weird inconsistent use of citations makes me think its either a college student or a fake paper put out by russian PR. Either way, nearly every point in there executive summary is bogus. Denying gay people rights does nothing to protect children, they are just using the same BS statement that every religious fundamentalist uses when trying to cover there tracks. One non commital statement to the UN doesnt mean russia is expanding LGBT protections, if the only evidence they can find is from a random 2 year old speech, thats pretty sad. Im not suprised russias official rates of crimes against gay people are so low, in a guardian investigation they took looked at 20 incidents of hate crimes against LGBT in russia, of those 20 only 1 went to court. The only thing those numbers mean is that russia isnt interested in protecting its gay citizens. I actually laughed out loud at that seventh point, you can and probably will get fired in russia if you come out as being gay. A high profile case was when a tv presenter revealed on air that he was gay and was fired within hours."

The candlelight vigil from Gone Girl was at a gazebo, the Common Pleas Courthouse gazebo, listed here, along with other locations from the movie.  This site says the Gaffney scenes were filmed in the city Havre de Grace in Maryland. I can't find a listing for the specific church location, but considering the cost of the crew, actors etc. I'd wager it is somewhere near that city.  Edit: The reason I think they felt similar to you is that David Fincher set the visual style for the series, especially the first season. I think they got a bit away from that style in S3. David Fincher has a very distinctive style. Here is an excellent video that looks at the visual style of all his movies.

Hillary was the mastermind behind Bill, without her he would never had become a President, that’s without a doubt. But he betrayed her, in many ways, and she was always ambitious but when she understood that Bill played for himself, not for their team, she started to plan her own public office career, her own path, even if she wasn’t really qualified. She failed and made mistakes with the health care plan, and eventually was forced to come back to her First lady role, which made her miserable, but never let go in her mind the ambition she had for herself. She’s still there: trying.   I know sounds like a stretch....but if you think about it, no so much...the similarities between Claire and Hillary are really really riveting."
HouseOfCards,2zubex,Ostrololo,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:27:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's the parallel the show seems to be implying. However, I think the execution had some flaws:   Realistically, Claire's best chance at the Presidency is for Frank to be elected, then she gets a position as Senator or something. By leaving Frank, she's sabotaging herself. The show didn't really give enough reason to justify Claire's accusation that Frank only cares about his own career. I mean, ok, in the end he physically abuses her during the Oval Office scene, but I mean before that (after all, Claire had just verbally abused Frank so it's understandable he would break). In fact, it's quite the opposite: The show insisted over and over again on how much Frank loves Claire. Throughout the show it has always been Claire who has betrayed Frank (not only the diplomatic fiasco in Russia, but also stuff like the Watershed Act all the way in season 1). As far as I can remember, Frank has never betrayed Claire."

This is the current one Samantha Power has a J.D. from Harvard.  Madeleine Albright has a PhD from Columbia.  She currently teaches international relations at Georgetown.  Susan Rice has a PhD in international relations from Oxford.  Claire's is out of her league as her only experience is writing a little domestic policy and fundraising for a charity.  Oh and being a Dallas debutante.  She has an undergrad degree in something but I dont think they have ever told us what.---oh wait I found it.  She has an undergrad from Radcliffe in environmental science and chemistry, and a masters from Harvard in public health.  WHY is she not trying to work in her field is beyond me.  Despite her degrees she has no interest in the environment or public health.  Instead she thinks she can just jump in and solve the 2000 year old mideast crisis.  Ambitious! :-P  Even Hillary Clinton, the most ambitious of all first ladies, did not get such an important job right out of the gate.  She scandalized the nation by working as an adviser to Bill Clinton and then got to work on some new policy ideas for  healthcare.  It took nearly 20 years for her to become a credible candidate for Secretary of State.  Is this a rant? :-P  I am ranting because it was ridiculous to expect that a woman whose most well known accomplishment is being a Dallas Debutante and a ""great beauty"" would not spectacularly crash and burn.

There are valid complaints you could make about S3, like the irrationality of Claire's actions or the Dougcentricism (neither of which I mind or agree with), but the vast majority just want to see successful plot after successful plot.

He will do whatever it takes with regards for no one, including his wife. However, he conceded a lot of his True Frank in this season. He made concessions to the House leaders in the wake of the hurricane, he let his guard down with the author, and he did not control Claire. These are all very anti-Frank and now he is paying for it.   It was still an interesting season for myself. The character development is still blossoming, except for Doug (can we please get off his crazy adventures and return him to the efficient, near Frank level ruthlessness). The relationships between many characters was very intriguing. The story line itself is now in an odd spot.  I can see the complaints of the criticizers. I echo a lot of them as well. It's not so much that Frank couldn't overcome his enemies that were rightfully put in his way. It's that he didn't do it in an Underwood fashion."

HouseOfCards,2zvbl2,thisishorsepoop,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:31:12 2015 UTC,I think my biggest character gripe with this show is Garrett Walker. I don't know if it's the actor or the way he was written but he was the most unbelievable president I've ever seen on screen (that was meant to be taken seriously). He couldn't lead me across the street.
HouseOfCards,2zvbl2,Trair,1 point,Mon Mar 23 02:13:44 2015 UTC,"Really? I see him as one of the more believable presidents, maybe he just bases his act off of Obama or something but I felt nothing wrong with him."
HouseOfCards,2zvbl2,thisishorsepoop,1 point,Mon Mar 23 02:28:37 2015 UTC,"It seems more like he based it off Rick Santorum than Obama. I can't believe a guy with his lack of charisma and conviction would ever be electable, and he has a pretty punchable face to boot, which is obviously shallow but still matters. Even when he spoke to the public it sounded like he had a gun to his head.   And in private? He was the most limpdick excuse for a leader ever. Frank was able to talk him into literally anything and mouth off to him as much as he wanted. I get that the show wouldn't proceed without him being manipulated by Frank, but Frank didn't even need to try."
HouseOfCards,2zvbl2,ilm400,2,Mon Mar 23 03:08:54 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen many Rick Santorum speeches, he just seems to have similar mannerisms to Obama, who knows, I'm not an acting major. I just liked his portrayal more than the slew of cable West Wing rip offs that are plaguing the channels today.  Edit: Just thought of this, maybe he seems less charismatic on purpose, to allow Frank to seem more charismatic. I'm binging season 3 right now, and he just started campaigning and I'm like wow, he can do this."

HouseOfCards,2ztkqx,kikmeee,6,Sat Mar 21 17:18:36 2015 UTC,"I doubt seriously this would ever be a real ending to the show. . .but.  I'd like to see Frank get suicidal but decide to screw everyone over by starting a nuclear war with Russia.  I can see it now, he's in the oval office, about to press the button, when Meechum realizes how far Frank has fallen and uses his service weapon to dispatch the president.  That to me would be the ultimate in crazy twists."

HouseOfCards,2ztkqx,Mr_Skittles,0,Tue Mar 24 19:27:55 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the original House of Cards so I'm not sure if the house collapses there, but for the US version whatever house collapses won't be a big one. I don't believe there will be any consequences for the things he's done or what Doug Stamper has done for him. Even if it is discovered, no one will make it public because he's too powerful and no real solid evidence.  Whatever happens will probably be something in the 4th season unrelated to the bad things in the previous season. Worse I see happening is Claire goes off on her own and he gets a consulting or lobbying job (or starts his own firm) and works from behind to accomplish what he wants."
HouseOfCards,2ztkqx,deadline_zombie,0,Sat Mar 21 17:38:53 2015 UTC,Are you basing this on the trope of American television viewers not being able to handle a dark ending?
HouseOfCards,2ztkqx,jouest,6,Sat Mar 21 22:05:42 2015 UTC,"No, I believe it will be a dark ending in that he gets away with everything. Any punishment or loss of standing will still leave him with plenty of money, power, and freedom."
HouseOfCards,2ztkqx,deadline_zombie,3,Sat Mar 21 22:59:51 2015 UTC,I think that if he gets away with everything it will be far darker than what OP is suggesting.  I think that it's inevitable that he will go to prison or commit suicide. I agree with OP that suicide seems more likely. They can't call it House of Cards if the house doesn't fall.
HouseOfCards,2zvoob,Wxlson,7,Sun Mar 22 05:23:22 2015 UTC,Gavin set the bait for Lucas to take and lured him in and trapped him.. Lucas was posting on deep web forums i think and Gavin reached out to Lucas and not knowing Gavin was working with the FBI..
HouseOfCards,2zvoob,Simorebut,5,Sun Mar 22 06:08:28 2015 UTC,"Either the implication is that Tor is not 100% secure, or that the request attracted the FBI's attention and they used Gavin to lure him in, identifying him after he met with Gavin."

HouseOfCards,2zvoob,U5efull,0,Mon Mar 23 04:30:34 2015 UTC,"Tor was developed with help from the US govt, the US govt has known about holes in Tor since it's inception.  HOC hired Greg Housch to help them make sure the hacking was realistic (google him).  What happened in the show is pretty much what could happen in reality."
HouseOfCards,2zvoob,DemandsBattletoads,2,Sun Mar 22 19:32:00 2015 UTC,"Tor was developed with help from the US govt, the US govt has known about holes in Tor since it's inception.   According to the design papers, Tor was designed as an third-generation onion router and addressed many issues that plagued previous routers and mixnets. Tor has many civilian uses outside the government. It was also designed to be simple and well understood. The papers also analyse Tor, its weaknesses and threat model. There's no secrets, the code is open.  Your opinion seems speculative, do you have any sources?"
HouseOfCards,2zvoob,U5efull,1 point,Mon Mar 23 05:54:25 2015 UTC,"I have no clue as to why you would think this is speculative.  The TOR website states the government uses the software here:  https://www.torproject.org/about/overview   A branch of the U.S. Navy uses Tor for open source intelligence gathering, and one of its teams used Tor while deployed in the Middle East recently. Law enforcement uses Tor for visiting or surveilling web sites without leaving government IP addresses in their web logs, and for security during sting operations.   In addition, the release of information from Edward Snowden made it very clear TOR was compromised.  Here is just one easily found source that can be had in about two seconds using a google search.  http://rt.com/usa/tor-anonymity-easily-compromised-researcher-537/  Calling my statement speculative and an opinion seems rather silly when this information has been known in cryptographic circles for a very long time."
HouseOfCards,2zvoob,DemandsBattletoads,2,Mon Mar 23 06:12:18 2015 UTC,"The ""Tor Stink"" NSA presentation strongly shows that the NSA has had major trouble breaking Tor. Also, if Snowden knew that Tor was compromised, why did he use it to contact the Guardian? That doesn't make sense."
HouseOfCards,2zvoob,U5efull,1 point,Mon Mar 23 06:20:32 2015 UTC,"The compromise is that they can get the data if they know what to look for or where to look.   The government still has to spend considerable resources to snoop the traffic from a home, decrypt it and then read the contents.    So let's say Snowden uses TOR at a starbucks, connects through some custom ports into a already compromised windoze box and then routes through that?  I mean right there the government couldn't find him easily.  This would still protect the reporter because they can't bug every reporter, and they all have trusted sources they use so I figure encrypted communications are pretty regular for them.    You and I have no idea how he got around them being able to decrypt TOR, my moneys on the fact they don't watch every person, they watch people they already suspect.  They still have the ability to do it, especially if you just use TOR on your PC at home.    You can sit here and argue until you are blue in the face and your fingers don't feel, but it's a fact.  There is no encryption system that is foolproof, and the government having the ability to create specialized chips to crack RSA should scare the bejesus out of you, but feel free to keep spreading FUD about this.    I am seriously beginning to wonder what is your agenda here?  You can source this yourself any day of the week so why say I'm being untruthful?"
