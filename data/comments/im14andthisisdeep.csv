The Obama Administration actually might have ended bulk intake of data, which was what made the Patriot Act so scary to many people, within 180 days after the bill had been reinvigorated.

It's so boring, this picture took a lot of talent to draw and the message it sends is clear. I don't think the artist was trying to be subtle judging from the choice in palette and the fact that there is nothing else going on in the picture besides the main subject. Just because you personally consider the message to be overplayed or whatever doesn't make it any less valid, I believe a lot of us can still recognise this picture as somewhat accurate. I mean we DO live in a consumer based society where money and materialism is valued above almost everything. So what if this isn't the most original concept for a drawing ever conceived, it doesnt mean it doesnt have a right to exist, I guarantee almost all of the people that take place in the ""so edgy"" circlejerk are a bunch of keyboard warriors who spend all day criticizing but never actually contribute a single worthy idea or piece of art of their own. Ninja edit: If anyone comes to me with some weaksauce ""Just cuz I don't create content doesnt mean I cant criticise it"" bullshit, shut up. Sure, actual criticism can come from any source whether they are skilled in that area or not, it doesn't even have to be constructive if you have a valid point to make. Circlejerking is not real criticism though, its just saying the same fucking thing as everyone else who wants to appear to be smart says."

im14andthisisdeep,3ds2c4,VirunVIICrest,18,Sat Jul 18 22:27:22 2015 UTC,"Does evil exist? The university professor challenged his students with this question. Did God create everything that exists? A student bravely replied, ""Yes, he did!"" ""God created everything?"" The professor asked. ""Yes sir"", the student replied. The professor answered, ""If God created everything, then God created evil since evil exists, and according to the principle that our works define who we are then God is evil"". The student became quiet before such an answer. The professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth. Another student raised his hand and said, ""Can I ask you a question professor?"" ""Of course"", replied the professor. The student stood up and asked, ""Professor, does cold exist?"" ""What kind of question is this? Of course it exists. Have you never been cold?"" The students snickered at the young man's question. The young man replied, ""In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-460 degrees F) is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat."" The student continued, ""Professor, does darkness exist?"" The professor responded, ""Of course it does."" The student replied, ""Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton's prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is? You measure the amount of light present. Isn't this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present."" Finally the young man asked the professor, ""Sir, does evil exist?"" Now uncertain, the professor responded, ""Of course as I have already said. We see it every day. It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil."" To this the student replied, ""Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is not like faith, or love that exist just as does light and heat. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light."" The professor sat down. The young man's name? Albert Einstein!"

When I'm walking through my daily life, I take a look at the people around me and make baseless assumptions about their intelligence just to judge them.  When I surf the internet, I look at all the troll comments, and while I tell everyone not to feed the trolls as they are just attention seekers, I subconsciously believe that they are serious and represent 90% of the human population.  When I talk with people about my ideals, people generally seem uninterested and confused, and while this is due to my garbled mess of a vocabulary and my failure to understand what I'm talking about, I choose to believe it's because they are simply too unintelligent to converse with me, in order to fuel my ego.  That's what my entire existence is about, really. it's about fuelling my ego, and thanks to the internet I can do that with ease. I just post an image that says something I believe to be undoubtedly true, and watch the up-votes and positive comments come pouring in.  Sometimes it doesn't work, and I am shown for who I really am; a loser with a messiah complex.  But this subreddit assures that I am outed, and I cannot let that be, lest I am forced to admit my faults and be a decent human being.  ...  ^ Basically a description of 14-year-old me."

These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a deep ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.   I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy -- ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness -- that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it, finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what -- at last -- I have found.   With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.   Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.   This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me. üêüüêüüêüüêüüêüüêü"

The correct comparison is your vote with everyone else's vote; your vote is tied for first in the contest of whose vote counts more.

im14andthisisdeep,3cwbt1,Tobz_Smith,3,Sat Jul 11 18:33:59 2015 UTC,"""Ima poop"" Vs ""I have to poop""  ""My butt hole hurts from eating hot sauce"" Vs.  ""I am experiencing discomfort from poor food choices recently""  They both have different meanings!!!!!!!!! Wake up sheeple!!!!"
im14andthisisdeep,3cwbt1,Professor_Oedipus,4,Sun Jul 12 03:39:21 2015 UTC,There's no close-quote on the first sorry
im14andthisisdeep,3cwbt1,Leninator,2,Sat Jul 11 13:56:06 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this at all, can someone deeper than me please explain this?"
im14andthisisdeep,3cwbt1,mlpsla,10,Sat Jul 11 15:10:04 2015 UTC,"The comments in the left are generally used to reply to someone when you're mad at them.    For example, if I've messed up and upset my partner, she'll sometimes say ""love you"" instead of ""I love you"".   It's a way to convey tone over text based conversations - irl you can tell if sometimes upset, online you can not."
im14andthisisdeep,3cwbt1,QuinnsaneLol,3,Sat Jul 11 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"I would never post this on my wall or like this post but... They generally have different intent, not always. An example is k vs ok"

im14andthisisdeep,3cx78z,BootsMcCollins,16,Sat Jul 11 15:58:58 2015 UTC,What if your way of doing things equates 5+4=3? What if your way of doing things is horribly wrong.
im14andthisisdeep,3cx78z,IWishIWasATurnip,13,Sat Jul 11 19:15:43 2015 UTC,Respect other people's ways of thinking as long as you both come to the same conclusion.
im14andthisisdeep,3cx78z,Partoghimeos,3,Sat Jul 11 21:19:57 2015 UTC,Woah
im14andthisisdeep,3cx78z,mw69,2,Sat Jul 11 20:11:11 2015 UTC,What if you want to 4 + 1 = 5 instead? 9 is an ugly stupid outdated number anyway.
im14andthisisdeep,3cx78z,DownvoterAccount,11,Sun Jul 12 01:53:55 2015 UTC,And then there's the weird guy who does sqrt(81)

im14andthisisdeep,3cx78z,imma_reposter,2,Sat Jul 11 21:16:36 2015 UTC,But if you're subtracting or dividing there is only one way. I won't respect the wrong views of people who subtract and divide backwards damn it!
