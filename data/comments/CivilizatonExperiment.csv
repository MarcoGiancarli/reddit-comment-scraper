(EDIT: IGNORE THE THINGS IN THE BACKGROUND. Except for the Holy Hand Grenade.)    BONUS, if anyone is interested: my girlfriend and I worked really hard to make her an Ebola-chan costume for last Halloween. She was graduating from university (2 years older than I am), and she didn't like NY, so I wanted to take her to the Halloween Parade in NYC since it might be her only chance to do so. Alas, it didn't work out, but we went trick-or-treating in the wealthy, upper-class neighborhood where our university is situated.  Not trying to be a karma whore, but I just found that picture and I felt like sharing, since we put a lot of work into the costume. (I was an ebola victim- disposable clothes covered in blood, with blood streaming from every orifice.) Here it is."

CivilizatonExperiment,3e2204,mcWinton,9,Tue Jul 21 10:28:36 2015 UTC,"Too many Civ nations are started with lofty goals and dreams. Lack of manpower, organization, and dedication leave many of those unfinished and their lands sit as reminders of their hubris.  After getting a taste on another server of what a large dedicated nation can do when they set their minds to it, I joined Ironscale.  I want to see if that can be replicated at even a larger scale while dealing with the chaotic politics of CivEx.  I also wanted to see if a true feudal system can work effectively without growing bloated.    In the last few weeks of sitting in their chat, there's been plenty of talk of organizing, building, and structures.  I won't lie and say there's no talk about PvP.  However, it is from a standpoint that Ironscale knows it is looking like the biggest target.    That attracts a certain type of raider.  The kind that want to make the most noise and effect.  I also have personal experience with that exact feeling of being the largest target and dealing with the raiders that are drawn to it.  So there are plenty of defensive discussions.  PvP training, vaults, defenses, etc.   At no point was there talk of attacks or wars.  The biggest concerns seem to be how some certain banned people continue to try to weasel their way into things. There are members of Ironscale that are very dedicated in exposing them. And I can completely sympathize with that."

CivilizatonExperiment,3e2204,Senetrix,3,Tue Jul 21 17:27:04 2015 UTC,"Ironscale is big and scary looking. I totally get that. A new map does not necessarily imply a new crowd and there's always going to be some sort of grudges carrying over because we as thinking, feeling beings can't simply wipe ourselves clean by clicking our fingers; it takes time and effort.  I can tell you in full confidence however that the members of Ironscale are trying their hardest to achieve this blank slate. We have plans to build a nation and contribute to the server in a positive way. That's it. There's been no talk of pearlings, raiding, pursuing vendettas or anything of the like.  Those who know me know that I'm notoriously anti-war when it comes to server interactions and politics, and if there had been any indication that we were heading down that path I would have pulled out by now and tried to enact my grand plans under someone else's banner. But there hasn't been. Discussions have been civil, ideas have been threshed out by both citizens and the Council before making it into practice and the path that Ironscale has been heading down is a benign one.  Personally, I'm in it for the building and the politics. Redcliffe certainly has no intention of sacrificing newfriends to the Cubist gods or setting fire to cities to warm ourselves or anything similarly sinister. I just want to have my Tsarist micro-empire, dabble in Politics and generally have a great time with people across the server; and I know with the backing of the other members of Ironscale that can be a safe and achievable reality."
CivilizatonExperiment,3e2204,gohkamikaze,4,Wed Jul 22 03:05:21 2015 UTC,"There's not much I can add to the above, seeing how Winton has pretty much said how the entirity of Ironscale feels. I actually decided to join Ironscale because of the people in it and the experience of being in a 'supernation'. I didn't join to terrorize the server or to prevent smaller nations creating alliances and I can assure that no one in Ironscale thinks that way. I was shocked when I found out some people actually thought Ironscale was scheming some imminent attack. If you're worried about something or have any questions regarding Ironscale, feel free to PM me."

CivilizatonExperiment,3dz24n,bbgun09,5,Mon Jul 20 19:58:43 2015 UTC,That's a private matter according to dis post. And it should stay that way
CivilizatonExperiment,3dz24n,Devonmartino,2,Mon Jul 20 20:56:19 2015 UTC,"Tbh, even if she got threats, no one will believe her anymore She faked death threats before by photoshopping(*) a reddit message.  Trust is jot an infinite resource.  *: it wasn't photoshopping, but modification of the HTML source. I talked to the subreddit mods and gave them my password, who showed that it did not exist, I talked to the reddit admins in their AMA, who said that private messages are stored in one unique database, it's impossible that a message only shows up for the receiver, but not the sender."
CivilizatonExperiment,3dz24n,bbgun09,4,Tue Jul 21 01:33:24 2015 UTC,"So, are you condoning possible death threats and saying that she must be lying now? I think that in the current situation, death threats are more likely than they were previously.   Again, as you said, trust is not an infinite resource. You may have had plenty to give the current moderation team, but that does not mean that all of us do. Given her current social status, I think it'd be laughable to suggest that she give the moderation team her account information."
CivilizatonExperiment,3dz24n,Devonmartino,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:38:00 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying we have to be careful — we need a second person to confirm it, and we should make sure not to lynch the accused sender until we have more information."

CivilizatonExperiment,3dz24n,SuperWizard68,3,Tue Jul 21 06:39:23 2015 UTC,"What, does she have to turn over her account to let someone else see her inbox? (That was rhetorical; it's pretty clear that nobody is going to accept anything short of that.)  You can look at it from a ""don't lie, or nobody will believe you"" perspective. But I prefer to look at it from a ""Let's not have anyone die"" perspective. If you recall, the boy who cried wolf got eaten in the end.  My point is, if someone is being threatened, they should be able to confide in the moderators with proof and be secure in the fact that the moderators will take action.   To put it a different way: If I call 911 when there's no emergency, I don't lose my 911 privileges. Next time I call 911, the police will come, whether they want to or not, and whether the officers think I'm full of shit or not, because it's their job to do so. And if someone on this subreddit, regardless of social standing, is saying that they're receiving death threats and are able to provide a screenshot of such, it's the job of the moderation team to take those threats seriously.    I'm not trying to start shit here, but that's my official opinion. I don't like to take sides with these things, generally, but I tend to take death threats seriously, especially since I have received my fair share of them in the past (some guy I repeatedly killed in Dark Souls managed to get my home address last year).  Say what you will about anyone on this server, but we are all people- and I'd like to think that we're decent people. And death threats- or threats of any kind, as well as high-level shit-talking- are not the marks of decent people.    I've said my piece now. I wash my hands of the entire affair. Good night."

CivilizatonExperiment,3dz24n,EranVonBaron,6,Mon Jul 20 18:23:18 2015 UTC,Buzzfeeds latest news  DEFMORK LOVES A GOOD SHITpost
CivilizatonExperiment,3dz24n,HeyItsBliss,8,Mon Jul 20 18:26:25 2015 UTC,"There are three general kinds of shitposts.  Tier 1 shitposts are glorious. They require a lot of effort, and manage to make it absolutely worth it, simply by taking the piss out of everything and everyone in a humorous, yet intelligent way, by being accompanied by high-quality pictures and/or gifs specifically created or edited for the very purpose of the shitpost, or by a combination of the above and more methods.  Tier 2 shitposts are those that make you go ""meh"". Reading them causes no harm, yet you can't help but feel that these 37 seconds could have been spent better elsewhere. They usually do not require much effort, but are a guaranteed method to earn a bit of karma.  Tier 3 shitposts are the cancer of the world. They make you hate your and everyone's existence, they cause global warming, they are killing the whales and they killed Hank in Breaking Bad (RIP, you maginificent bastartd). Even though it was intended for the opposite purpose, it attracts negative karma like Florida attracts seniors and mentally instable people.  There is also a secret tier of shitposts, which has never been witnessed before and left few survivors sane enough to report about them.  The Tier 0 Divine Shitpost.  The only clue we have about its very existence, and its vague appearance has been documented by a sole fisherman, whose boat unexpectedly broke down in the year 2005 and left him stranded on an isolated island. Sort of distraught, but not any less keen on his original goal he travelled north, searching for dank memes.  The Tier 0 shitpost came sudden and rash. Fortunately the fisherman, who goes by the name ""Boris N. Igma"" had his notebook with him, and managed to write a few words for the outside world, before the divine light engulfed him and left him with the intelligence of a 2-year old. Here is what he wrote.  ""There is a white-yellowish sphere, hovering a few feet above the ground just before me. Wait, it is[UNDISCERNIBLE]g, now it's a good hundred feet above the ground. I'm seeing bright tentacles pullulating from its body. no they are moving towards me no it is th""  The text, barely decipherable (probably bleached by the light), cuts off at this position, but leading shitposterologists have a theory about what happened next: The sphere - holding Boris a few inches in front of itself - probably turned into a computer screen, which revealed a shitpost with presumably over 1450 shit points. It was so meticulously crafted, so brilliant yet so utterly fucking shitty that it incinerated a large part of Boris's synapses. Boris now being consciousless, the sphere laid Boris back on the ground, and proceeded to penetrate him anally. After it orgasmed, it went back to its native domain - the 5th layer of shitposts - where it is probably ruling over other shitposts to this day.  The Tier 0 Divine Shitpost remains a mystery to us all."

On the Ironscale leadership side, I can confirm that we were planning on large trade networks within Verrenteros and (at least Wit's End) were planing to work with Verrenteros to expand literature and culture. Additionally, the King and the Barons all harkened Bliss, Szaro, Zef and you as great leaders and people and were genuinely trying to build Verrenteros up as well as ourselves.  What was the late Verrenteros' leadership honest opinion of Ironscale?"
CivilizatonExperiment,3dzih6,ThePimpShrimp,5,Mon Jul 20 20:28:17 2015 UTC,"Originally, when I had read Ironscale's introduction post, I had planned in starting an alliance. It would garentee peace between us I believed and would mean no one would dare Attack. However for quite a number of reasons most people didn't really trust Ironscale. And of course as I wasn't foreign minister I couldn't even really disscus the possibility of an alliance with anyone from Ironscale. That was mostly the general thing with Ironscale, most people in the chat (total of 7 people) didn't trust Ironscale. It was assumed an attack was inevitable, likely to take place in about a month or so. I myself held doubts, as I know how risky it would be to attack someone unprovoked. Especially since most of you guys didn't want to countine your legacy of being ""the evil RoL"". Not quite sure how things would have played out."
CivilizatonExperiment,3dzih6,HeyItsBliss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:08:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation.  Clears up a lot of things and I can understand why some of our posts (having no bad intent) maybe felt provocative.

Wikia has little to no formatting and ediing features compared to other wiki platforms Wikia's navigation/top bar thingy is terrible to use in practise Wikia's very 'dumbed down' from a proper wiki A hosted wiki (rather than one created from free in 50 minutes) looks way more professional, and is ad-free.

I can find a place for anyone within the Order of Draconis, but it's still nice to know where I have to focus in order to sell you on my Order. Here's our main post btw: https://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/3bsa3f/new_nation_the_sovereign_military_order_of/  Well, as a Knightly Order focused on punishing bandits and other scum in the name of the Cubist God Draconis, we are pretty apolitical, if you're talking about political doctrines like communism and fascism. We're led by the Grandmaster, and are as knights, sworn to defend all of Civilization. We will still be involved in trade and such-esp in protecting trade. We have some interesting ideas for building, as well, and could certainly use a redstone expert for that or....more explosive inventions for our cannons. As said above, we follow Draconis and Cubism in general alongside the Ironscale Kingdom and Picarona.

But I get you-we are pretty militaristic. Have to be to be the organization that hunts bandits."
CivilizatonExperiment,3dzr9g,zombehking,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:30 2015 UTC,"Well, while I'm not a leader of a nation, I am a plotter in a organization, so I'll give it a shot!   While most of my other fine peers offer the ever dull 'peace, land to live off of, no drama..' etc.   I offer you the exact opposite.  The Keto Organization will be dealing with under handed tactics, fighting, stealing, spying, whatever you could wish for in excitement.  In roles that you choose, you could be tasked with protecting a VIP client from raiders or foreign nation armies!  or you could storm a castle, tasked with hunting down its members, such is the life of the offensive position in Keto!  In the spy role, you could go deep undercover, the enemies trusting you as a loyal friend, when suddenly you get tasked from Keto central to burn everything in their armory, leaving them open to attack. Or similarly you sell out information, always being a paid informant.   In the Scout role, you could be the most free! you explore the continents of the world, taking pictures and testing different biomes for their secrets! You also have the option of scouting out area's for Keto castles and networks to be built upon!   Or if you are more interested in a settled role, you can be an assistant, always gathering resources, but get the most benefits from Keto, in doing so, you would be able to build structures on different biomes, settling in them and making them fully functional for combat and safe-house using!    As for religion, Keto believes in any religion, while I myself pray to the mighty god of Sagmes, the god of change. I believe that most fitting since our goal is to use Keto as a mean of further developing and civilizing CivilEx through funding and partaking in public projects from time to time.   If any of these roles interest you,  don't hesitate to PM me :D   Keto membership for the cheap price of only 20.99$, call and order nowTM"
CivilizatonExperiment,3dzr9g,picklesane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:31:30 2015 UTC,"Hm, somewhat interesting, but im not really looking for a militaristic society, as I not prefer PvP anymore, due to it relying on a little bit of skill, and having better equipment than other people (like p2w games). I would consider joining, however, if there was a roll for fortifications/redstone engineering in the capital.  Nice sales pitch at the bottom, btw..."
CivilizatonExperiment,3dzr9g,allliiisonnn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:37:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, it does feel quite militaristic, I certainly won't lie and say it isn't, but the scout and Assistant roles are mostly peace orientated in the Organization.   As for the fortifications, I'm quite interested in your abilities if you think yourself proficient enough! I could make a position / department for redstone users and the like, gathering nothing but the best of them?  The role would be almost entirely non-combatant, though if the thought doesn't scare you, it would be a boon if you and any future redstone engineers would sell out their services across the world, building more of your machines for people? (This is of course up to the individual to decide whethere they accept the contract for it or not.)   And thank ya, I try to be make it all flow in there :D"

I mean, the image literally has me dead from your attack in it, with the castle on fire and being destroyed. Kind of harsh for a joke I think"
CivilizatonExperiment,3dwbgi,FaerFoxx,3,Mon Jul 20 14:30:54 2015 UTC,"So you're claiming Verrenteros imploded because of this one little image? Let's ignore the fact multiple people in V have been posting playful anti-Ironscale images for the last 2 weeks, all of which we've taken as the lighthearted jokes they are, and that this image comes in response to those. Let's also ignore the fact that there was never a threat of war, only a candid conversation with Bliss, Zef, and myself about how their playful mentions of a V vs Ironscale competition would only promote it (which clearly they did), and me wanting to make sure they didn't have any delusions about what real war was like (because Wyck was horribly unaware going into WWI and I didn't want them marching to their own doom).    Let's just deal with the fact that /u/heyitsbliss and /u/zefmiller have publicly stated that part of the reason they imploded was due to informants within V handing out sensitive information which they didn't want made public.    You're one of my informants, faerfoxx. Twice I went to zef and bliss with insider information and both times you were one of the contributing sources of intel. Your lips are loose as shit, and you helped sink a pretty awesome ship.    If bliss or zef want to know more they know how to reach me."

Secondly, wow Winton I knew you were an arse but calling me a spy? I've literally never talked to you once since you flipped out on me for leaving RoL instead of 'staying out of the way'. Nice to see you fully admit to spying on the senate chat room though and working for the destruction of the nation and such, that fits right in with your character."

I personally wasn't happy with the way we were going (big, scary war nation) and we were having issues with a few members and leadership. So we decided to crumple up the blueprints and start over. There was no single reason.   There was also the issue of the new resources not meshing well with our mountain top idea. So our castle most likely would have not worked as expected.   This was not Nathaniel's fault and he didn't want war. What Bliss's post was trying to day in a sort of convoluted way was that we were having issues over specific topics and we figured it'd be better for everyone if we spilt. This blew up to be bigger than it needed to be but the basics are that we're just changing our government and citizens around and a adopting new system for 2.0  Sorry this took up the subreddit waaay more than necessary.   Most likely, after this blows over, we'll join/make a new nation."

CivilizatonExperiment,3drd9f,FaerFoxx,5,Sun Jul 19 01:01:13 2015 UTC,"It does look like luni, though. The way the javascript is done looks exactly like luni (it’s copy-pasted from stackoverflow, but he knew not to use a publicly registered domain, etc).  My diagnosis: LUNI INCOMING, PREPARE FOR DRAMA"
CivilizatonExperiment,3drd9f,janne-bananne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:03:50 2015 UTC,It's not actually Luni.
CivilizatonExperiment,3drd9f,FaerFoxx,3,Sun Jul 19 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"Well, then it’s someone with the exact same knowledge and experience as him. And the amount of people who have enough knowledge to use a TLD without WHOIS service, who also happen to not be able to write proper javascript, and who happen to have influence the wars on CivEx 1.0 is veeeery small. It’s exactly 1, luni."
CivilizatonExperiment,3drd9f,janne-bananne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:07:50 2015 UTC,"The first one I don't think you could actually comment on, the second one Luni can do JavaScript enough that he wouldn't copy paste, and three I can think of more than a dozen people involved in the world wars."
CivilizatonExperiment,3drd9f,FaerFoxx,4,Sun Jul 19 03:10:11 2015 UTC,"I talked with luni about some of this stuff in Teamspeak and on IRC back then, he really knew almost nothing about JS.  And I now have proof it’s not luni: it contains a lot of stuff he wouldn’t be able to do, and which wouldn’t make economical sense for him."
CivilizatonExperiment,3drd9f,janne-bananne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:14:48 2015 UTC,"So in the past several months since then he hadn't learned anything new, and was being completely truthful in your conversation that time? There is literally nothing complex about that JavaScript, I've barely looked at anything in the language before and I could do it easy. Plus as you claim, it's just a copy paste code anyway, so what would it matter how 'advanced' the code is? Though you are correct, it's not Luni, just not for the reasons you are being an arse as usual about."
CivilizatonExperiment,3drd9f,FaerFoxx,5,Sun Jul 19 03:22:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the thing is:  This code is not good code. Or code that anyone experienced would write.  This code is literal uglyness, written by someone who has less than a few hours of JavaScript experience.  It uses techniques that have been deprecated since 1997, it uses code samples that are copy-pasted from stackoverflow questions, etc.  Then, again, at the same time, the backend authentication has a nice browser-independ key handler, which even works on IE5 (someone copy-pasted old stackoverflow code), but uses for the backend transfer nice json payloads, which haven’t been a thing for more than a few years.  It’s really interesting, because it means the person has knowledge in PHP, but no knowledge at all in JS."
CivilizatonExperiment,3drd9f,janne-bananne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:26:55 2015 UTC,"There you go then I guess??? It's literally 5 lines, copy pasted from elsewhere, it's hardly anything 'too advanced'. Perhaps your own level of skill is reflecting upon how difficult you think the code is?   Edit: In fact, another thing, if the person knew PHP, they would just use a tick scroller in PHP. This has all been grabbed literally from some sample page, probably by someone with no programming skill or one who didn't want to bother."
CivilizatonExperiment,3drd9f,FaerFoxx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:29:19 2015 UTC,"Hell, even I can claim to have influenced a few wars. And most people didn't even know where Triccam was."
CivilizatonExperiment,3drd9f,Nathanial_Jones,3,Sun Jul 19 03:14:31 2015 UTC,"Well, the combination of   just enough JS knowledge to copy-paste some shit together having influenced several world wars (we only had 3) being able to use a free, hidden domain    is not a common trait ;P"
CivilizatonExperiment,3drd9f,janne-bananne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:18:23 2015 UTC,"Well, first, I'm sure if I bothered I could figure out how to copy and paste stuff like this in a few hours.  Secondly, they never said any world wars, just wars.. Thirdly, I have no clue how easy or hard that is, so not going to debate that.  I do agree that its not a common list of traits, however there are other things that makes me doubt it is Luni. I suppose we'll simply have to wait and see."

You just destroyed one of your arguments back in the faked message debate, which was that you have no experience with programming or anything, too.  But, looking at it, it doesn’t seem to be luni. He already pays 8.95$ per month for his current shared hosting solution, it’d be stupid to pay another 4.95$ a month at a different shared hoster, especially when most people wouldn’t be able to track it back anyway.

CivilizatonExperiment,3dnlsn,Defmork,-6,Sat Jul 18 19:38:03 2015 UTC,There is absolutely no valid reason to use a VPN except for evading account bans.
CivilizatonExperiment,3dnlsn,trollbusted,10,Fri Jul 17 19:19:58 2015 UTC,"I think you may need to review the above information as you may not be able to enforce that. Here's why... If I login at a friends, it would appear that I was using a vpn due to a different ip.  Therefore a simple response of I was at a public hotspot or a friends house, would be an acceptable response to prevent the ban. Are you trying to block alts and writing vpn? How do you plan to enforce this rule? Clarification is needed. Does it mean you'll ban anyone who using a second location (ip) to connect and say it's a vpn?"
CivilizatonExperiment,3dnlsn,HeyItsBliss,8,Fri Jul 17 19:47:24 2015 UTC,"From what I'm reading, they're basically trying to keep Luni (and other perma-banned players, like Chopsy, who said he was coming back) from alt'ing back on, thus giving them a quick tool to remove any suspicious newfriends. This is a good idea in theory.  However in practice, this is nerfing all legit players who may have dynamic IPs or may connect through a VPN for more security because goddamn people get doxxed here, or may just connect through Starbucks one day. Just counting a different IP address as a VPN break and thus ban is a terrible idea.  Edit tl;dr: VPN bans will not stop alts. Just say you're banning alts... oh. Wait a sec...  VPN bans will stop everyone who connects to the server from a different location than home, and even then, if you have a dynamic IP, feel free to unban a ton of people on the hour. gg."

CivilizatonExperiment,3dnlsn,GetNGoingV-1,5,Sat Jul 18 10:42:02 2015 UTC,I'm a little bit confused how you would enforce this with a permanent ban? Doesn't a VPN allow you to avoid this situation entirely..?

CivilizatonExperiment,3dnlsn,FaerFoxx,2,Fri Jul 17 20:02:53 2015 UTC,Don't you already have a rule against using alt accounts anyway? What is this going to help anything besides needing to unban people like me every 30 minutes when my IP switches again? How could you even tell it was an alt account anyway if the IP is different? I'm not understanding the logic behind any of this.
CivilizatonExperiment,3dnlsn,Defmork,0,Fri Jul 17 20:05:19 2015 UTC,"The main reason why implemented this rule is because we don't want certain individuals that have been permanently banned to be able to play on the server. If we do get the inkling that we may have a banned player on the server under a new IP and account, we run their IP through an IP-checker, to check whether they are connecting with a VPN or not.  You are free to contact us regarding an exemption, we will try to be as  understanding as possible."

CivilizatonExperiment,3dnlsn,Defmork,2,Fri Jul 17 20:31:57 2015 UTC,"Instead of contacting for exemption, why not instead just allow players to have changing IPs except ones you think are owned by 'certain individuals'? How could you even check if two accounts with two different IPs are the same person?"
CivilizatonExperiment,3dnlsn,FaerFoxx,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:10:05 2015 UTC,"Imposing a general ban and adding exceptions before-hand poses a much smaller workload for us than individually analyzing every single suspect.  We can check a new player's IP-address if we get an inkling that it might be one of our banned players. If the player is using a VPN and has not contacted us about an exemption, we ban him.  Aside from that, a ban does not pose a lot of permanent damage and can be reverted anytime."
CivilizatonExperiment,3dnlsn,Defmork,2,Fri Jul 17 20:14:27 2015 UTC,"But how could you possibly determine a VPN from a normal address? It's not possible to do really, that's why you can VPN around the security of major international corporations to get at blocked content and such and they can't stop you from seeing USA Netflix whether they like it or not."
CivilizatonExperiment,3dnlsn,FaerFoxx,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:16:58 2015 UTC,IP checkers usually show whether a VPN-service is being used.

CivilizatonExperiment,3dnlsn,gotspade,3,Fri Jul 17 19:56:53 2015 UTC,Banning VPNs will not stop alts. You will have no idea what IP is using a VPN or what is a legit IP. That is the point of VPNs.  Simply stating you have the right to immediately remove any alt accounts would cause less chaos than this.

As a leader of a prospective 2.0 nation, I am required to post a recruitment message upon any reddit thread made by a new member introducing himself or herself. I shall now proceed with said recruitment message.  I am the Great Khat of the Khatate of Rhytzytopya, or the Ritzykhatate, a vassal of the Stonégasque Intergalactic Celestial Empire. We are a nomadic kingdom that drifts across the continent, leaving grandiose monuments and crafting a cultural legacy everywhere we go. We are as fleeting as the wind, disappearing behind the mountains, only to emerge from the oceans once more. As a vassal of the Stonégasque Intergalactic Celestial Empire, we pledge allegiance to Stonato, the Supreme Emperor of the Stonégasque Intergalactic Celestial Empire, who rules his massive time-space expanse from his throne on the planet of Kyoto, the capital of the M49 galaxy.  I encourage you to visit our website to learn more about our dankly intense nation!  http://ritzykhatate.weebly.com/  We are thus far the ONLY nation to have created their own weebly website.  Should you choose to join us, please send me a reddit message and we will take it from there. I am excited to see you drifting across the plains and tundras of CivEx, hopefully bonding spiritually with your fellow comrades in the Khatate."

I've watched /u/Nathanial_Jones display some political prowess and know-how in the past. I think he'll grow tired of being one of 4 Lords and he and his supporters will attempt a violent coup, which will turn into a few slain Verrenteros members, and Nathanial's group looting most of the valuables and fleeing the mountain to the nearest green biome, to lay low. The remaining leadership and membership of Verrenteros will attempt to reorganize and revitalize themselves, which will be delayed by another surprise attack by Nat & Co. Verrenteros will then hire PvPers to deal with Nat & Co., which will force them to flee further and eventually merge with another small nation which will close its borders and threaten to kill anyone who comes after Nat & Co. HeyItsBliss will want revenge, and blood, so Verrenteros and their new PvP allies will attack Nat's new nation. Alliances will spring to life, subreddit pvp will rage for 2 days, Ironscale will get PMs from both sides asking us to stay out of the fight, and eventually peace will be arrived at with Nat & Co. being banned from Verrenteros lands, defensive alliances being announced, and Verrenteros committing themselves to peace and neutrality. /s    Two small nations will have a land dispute. One side will be good at PvP, the other side will think they are but wont actually be. The latter side will get killed en masse, complain a lot on the sub, and other nations will start taking sides based on who they've had pleasant interactions with thus far. Yadda yadda yadda, WWI.    Who will be Chops 2.0? (Starts/changes nations often, and spreads drama) Some hyper active newfriend who burns too hot too fast.    Who will be Luni 2.0? (influential, rich, powerful individual who is involved in major wars and alliances) LivingPutin (/u/zeetip). Not sure how influential he is, but he'll be rich (if he plays 2.0) and involved in wars.      Who will dominate commerce and business? Underfoot will attempt to. Abusted (/u/trollbusted) will ruin it by giving everything away for free to his friends.    What will the first mega alliance be between? Meaningful alliances are wartime alliances, so we'll see the first mega alliance come from that.    Aside from the usual resources, what will be a valuable commodity? Lapis will be extremely valuable in 2.0 (it was worthless in 1.0) thanks to 1.8. Food should be. I'm hoping land is much more valuable this time around.    Who will build all the infrastructure?

That's hard to say. All the alliances from 1.0 have pretty much banded together into single nations for 2.0, so the political relationships for alliances between different nations aern't really there yet.   Aside from the usual resources, what will be a valuable commodity?   Food hopefully. The staff has hinted they've made changes to make growing food a lot more intensive and risky. Kind of hard to hoard resources or wage war when you're starving.   Who will build all the infrastructure?   Hopefully the individual nations will do that this time around. The organizations like CERA in 1.0 had nice intents but kind of flopped. They didn't work with nations local to where they wanted to build roads much at all.

However, I'm quite sick of people insinuating that Verrenteros will be the epicenter of some dramawave, directly or indirectly.   Who will be Chops 2.0?    Well, I'm obviously not going to answer that but I have joking suspicions. ;)   Who will be Luni 2.0?   Me.  that was a joke   Who will dominate commerce and business?   Good question. Too early to call, really. I doubt that we'll really know until we play. Resources may be completely different, and places that were once good to settle may not be anymore. Time will tell what we discover and who will use it.   What will the first mega alliance be between?   Same as /u/Frank_Wirz. It's so many 1.0 nations compressing down that the existing power structures and alliances have become moot. Looking forward to it, however. Some newfriend nation might be impressive and have to deal with some returning players.   Aside from the usual resources, what will be a valuable commodity?   At first, builders. The faster you get your stuff together, the faster you can explore and defend your claim.   Who will build all the infrastructure?   CERA 2.0 will likely have Ironscale covered, but I think the rest will be player made. Hopefully we'll see more styles than slab cobble/smoothstone CERA roads, but with the same standardization that made roads such an easy convenience. (Such as being four/six wide and three tall at all times.) I also hope that some type of subway-style map will be created and updated with all roads. It would be fantastic to be able to plan your way to cities, city locations are something I felt lacking on the 1.0 map."

Depending on how busy I am with Redcliffe, I'll be going through with that restructure.

CivilizatonExperiment,3d7lf0,kickboy9,7,Tue Jul 14 03:30:24 2015 UTC,The server is unfortunately not really operating right now. We're starting up a brand new server in about three weeks time. So it's a great time to start here as everyone is pretty much on equal footing.   As long as you have a nation you should be fine. I'd definitely recommend joining a preexisting nation if you're not very skilled at PvP. Having a nation protects you on this server (to a certain extent) because attacking members of another nation could escalate political conflicts.   If I were you I'd check out the available nations and find one you like.   My nation is Verrenteros. If you'd like to join we'd love to have you.   http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/3c7zru/announcing_verrenteros_a_new_20_nation_in_a_giant/
CivilizatonExperiment,3d7lf0,zefmiller,3,Tue Jul 14 03:50:51 2015 UTC,"As someone who joined two months into the map for 1.0, I felt the server didn't really have that problem with older players owning a huge advantage over newer players."
CivilizatonExperiment,3d7lf0,Sharpcastle33,3,Tue Jul 14 04:18:54 2015 UTC,"My best advice would be to get to know some people and join a nation. Most of the people on this server are pretty chill, and although PvP and warfare is a necessary evil around here there's not really much chance of you getting ganked by heavily-geared players at the drop of a hat.  If you're looking for a nation...   The Barony of Redcliffe in Ironscale is shaping up to be a pretty cool place. We have a unique architectural style that's a mix of Imperial Russian and Muscovite (so think onion domes, huge steep-roofed towers, yurts, and a couple of other surprises in the works ;) ).  As adherents to /u/Devonmartino and his Church of Cubism, we plan on worshipping either Hedonia as goddess of Humanity and working as an agrarian Barony, or Akira as Goddess of Intellect and work towards progress in both engineering and knowledge.  We're also one of the smaller Baronies in Ironscale with only a handful of members so far, which means there's more chance to distinguish yourself as a citizen and not be lost in the crowd so-to-speak."
CivilizatonExperiment,3d7lf0,gohkamikaze,3,Tue Jul 14 05:27:17 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the server! I suggest you find a nation to join.  I am the Great Khat of the Ritzykhatate. Learn more about us on our Official Website: http://ritzykhatate.weebly.com/  There are also many other nations that would love to have you. Good luck, and contact me personally for more information regarding anything at all!"
CivilizatonExperiment,3d7lf0,ritzycat,3,Tue Jul 14 05:48:25 2015 UTC,"You should get to know some people and then you can join a nation maybe. Or make one yourself. This is a friendlier community then those Kill-everything-that-moves servers. If you randomly start attacking and killing people, they will place a bounty on you. Bounty hunters will hunt you down and pearl you. They will give your pearl to the one who placed the bounty and he will keep you locked away. Forever. ahum sorry, I don't know what came over me. Just be nice and cool and you'll make friends guarenteed. Also, if you want a nation, consider joining Furalnir. Unlike most other nations, we had a two newfriends join us recently. Then you can get to learn to ropes together. Also, take a look at this"
CivilizatonExperiment,3d7lf0,lagiacrus2012,2,Tue Jul 14 06:18:49 2015 UTC,"No, this is not one of those pvp, no-community, die on-the-spot servers. We are more sophisticated as evident by the giant dicks Brandwine builds. If you want to join a nation, my friends and I would love to have you join the Grand Republic of Freimark.

CivilizatonExperiment,3d7lf0,Frank_Wirz,2,Tue Jul 14 11:26:06 2015 UTC,"The killing of new players isn't really the case on here. The goal of this server is nation building, and one of the best ways to do that is adding new players to your nation. People are way more likely to compete for your membership (as the comments here show) than kill you."
CivilizatonExperiment,3d7lf0,Devonmartino,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:33:03 2015 UTC,"As /u/zefmiller said, the server is kind of in limbo- the new map is going to be released in under 3 weeks' time.   Due to the new plugins being added, it's going to be difficult to start out alone- diversifying your food sources is going to be an issue. Might I suggest you join Picarona?

CivilizatonExperiment,3d0ky4,Devonmartino,2,Mon Jul 13 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"For the record (I got a couple of PMs on the subject), my comments on Verrenteros at the end were in no way derogatory, and I would hate for anyone to construe my words in that way.   I stand by what I said, however. I'm not going to stand here and say that no emotional baggage is going to be transferred from 1.0 to 2.0 with regards to the war Luni halted with his release of the map. There were a lot of harsh words and feelings on all sides being thrown around between the Feds, Komarni, Lakeheart, and other factions prior to that event, and I think I'm a good enough judge of human character to say that people aren't just going to forget about or abandon those sentiments. As I said in the podcast, if there is a violent conflict in the first few months of CivEx 2.0, I do think that Verrenteros is going to be involved either as (in part or in full) one side of the fight, or the site of a civil war. I didn't say ""I hope Verrenteros collapses on itself, die die die!"" or anything like that. I made a prediction- I even said I'd probably get flak for it, and I was apparently right- and I'm going to stand by it."

Unless specified otherwise, the borders of the Khatate are open to all.   ...aren't you guys nomads with no official borders or land? Certainly if you settle on another nation's claim, you have absolutely no jurisdiction to decide who or who does not get to be on their land. How do you plan to enforce this?"
CivilizatonExperiment,3cup0x,HeyItsBliss,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry it took me so long to respond, notification only recently came now for some reason. I do appreciate the nicely-worded message, though!  We have official borders. Our official borders move often, however. This will be easier logistically early on when there is plenty of unclaimed land. As the map fills we will obviously have to adapt our policy, however the same concept will remain. I think it would create an interesting political dynamic, the idea of organized kingdoms and republics ""pushing"" out a nomadic culture."
CivilizatonExperiment,3cup0x,HeyItsBliss,2,Fri Jul 17 20:32:01 2015 UTC,"You didn't answer my question, however. ;)  If you settle on somebody's claim with closed borders and no access, you obviously cannot operate as an independent nation. You would be on their land, and thus subject to their laws and rules. You could not set up anything, or use it as a base. Some could argue that you would be immediately pearled upon entry. Certainly posting you've been kicked out or pearled, the sub would explain this to you again. How would you plan to handle this?"

We are the only nation (I think) who have a religion that is not Cubism (except the ones with no religion of course). We worship Dragons. Not just normal dragons. No, The Divine Dragons. To normal people they're just really old and strong but to us they're Gods. Currently we have one Dragonlord (/u/spawn_point), one Governor (me) and no confirmed citizens. We do have 4 people who will probably join us but we will have to wait and see. When we have more members, a Secons Dragonlord and Second Governor will be chosen to found a second city. I would love it if you would join us. But, if you want an underground nation, Underfoot is underground. It's your choice ;)"
CivilizatonExperiment,3crm76,lagiacrus2012,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:49:59 2015 UTC,"That sounds good.   Dragon's lairs aren't always on mountain tops, for if they all lived on peaks, their treasure would roll down the sides to those who are unworthy of their gold. That is why we must dig to the most heated earthen places, traverse to the most distant lands and sail across the most vast seas, to find Dragons whom are the ones to lead us to being superlative to those who believe in the square and the rectangle."
CivilizatonExperiment,3crm76,lagiacrus2012,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:47:52 2015 UTC,"Does that mean you show interest in Furalnir and our beliefs? Dragons indeef prefer caves, towers and craters because it is much easier to store their treasure.

Something like this:    Trades (Red)   Trade   Images (Orange)   Build Map Flag   Meta (Green)   Suggestion Bug Hype   People (Turquoise)   Nation Government Propaganda   Crimes (Blue)   Crime Bounty Pearl   Announcements (Magenta)   Announcement Discussion Update   Other (Black)  Would cover both rows at the bottom for its categories button. The default color for flairs (i.e. just .flair) in the CSS   Spooky! Flairs not in the selector (legacy flairs, non-selectable ones)     As for looks, I'd suggest making the text bold, and  all-caps"

I'll be sure to put you in the story as well but only as a minor role. This is what I think the part with you will look like :         """"I heard people talking outside my house, at the port. I walked downstairs, expecting to see more locals or other people needing an explanation for the events that started yesterday. God, I am so tired of needing to explain and calm, over and over again. But I am the Wind Priest. It's my duty to be there in a time like this. But when I stepped outside, they weren't asking me anything. They weren't even looking at me! They were looking at the sea, at the boiling water, at the dead fishes and squids on the surface. Well, that's what I thought, atleast.         When I made my way through the crowd, I saw what they were really looking at. A fleet. ""Damnit!"" I thought, ""Who thinks of war at a time like this?!"". But when I looked closer, I saw it wasn't a military fleet. They were survivors. They were fleeing. Pah, won't do them much good. It didn't matter to me but it could easily scare the citizens and villagers. Then I noticed the group of soldiers standing close to me. They were muttering nervously. No, they weren't nervous. They were scared. ""What's the problem?"" I asked. ""You see that big ship over there? The Starfire?"" They said. ~""Yes, what is with it?"". -""That's the ship of Captain Ragnar Lethwin, one of the most fearsome and brave warriors that are out there"". ~""So what?"". -""If even he flees, then it's hopeless!"". ~""That's of no importance. What good is a soldier if there's nothing to fight? The Earth is dying, not attacking us. The Wind God will save us in time, we don't have to worry.""  It didn't matter what I said, the soldiers were almost panicking. I noticed people loading their stuff on boats. They were going to leave!""""  Pretty nice, huh? I'm in to this now.

Intel HD Graphics driver 15.33.29.64.3945+ can run without crash but it is still slow.    also, you cannot call integrated graphics a graphics card as it is not even a card"

An integrated graphics card shares memory with the main system using some crazy trick I'm not really up-to-date on, while a regular graphics card has its own memory.  I said I was having trouble with 1.8's shader system. 1.7 shaders work fine at a strong 30fps for me, which is what has me concerned.

The question is horribly manipulated to sound one-sided in the first poll, by making it sound like the admins are taking away from the players. In reality, max enchantments and max potions is terrible and it's something that they are going to fix for Minecraft 1.9 It is so extremely squishy that HCF doesn't even use it. You can take up to 3 hearts of damage per hit from other players, killing you in 4 hits. A kit like this not only has battles that last less than two minutes, but it hugely benefits players like me in that getting kills is so much easier. I had the ironscale guys try it out as well and it was terrible."
CivilizatonExperiment,3ch2cr,Derpyfish129,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:15:32 2015 UTC,"""Max potions and enchants are terrible"". Now that sounds one sided, and they DID take them away.

So it was a couple of weeks after the first /r/worldbuilding post and I was trying to set up my own nation when the leader of the co-op messages me (cant remember his name) and asks if I want to join his nation. I say no but tell him I'm dropping construction on my nation so he can have all my resources. Now this is the important bit-    He comes over to me and I give him his stuff and he heads back.

But, like I said, that was before he killed millions.   In terms of CivEx though, I'd say person. He kept so much of the server under an iron grip, and heavily influenced the server, whether we like it or not. There was a while where he was the best PvPer here. He really was a force to be reckoned with.    He really was influential. He made sure that he got his way. Ten thousand diamonds in the pit is nothing to scoff at. He was evil, and manipulative, but he sure was hell was influential. After all, until a few months back, he was the best PVPer on the server, and could easily control people that way.   I don't like person, for multiple reasons. I have zero evidence to support this, but one time, he did threaten a doxx on someone, and had said he did it before. He's called me many, many things. Chances are, if he's said something to me, I've recorded it, somewhere. But that just goes to show how fucking influential he was on people. The same way murderers have influence.

CivilizatonExperiment,3cbxs4,lagiacrus2012,2,Mon Jul 6 19:48:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm gonna pick /u/HeyItsBliss. I first met HeyItsBliss a while back in April when Tienedo had recently gotten out of a period of one-man-stateship. TheTarcin had just joined not long ago, and we met HeyItsBliss and took her into the nation, providing her a house, food etc... I think that Bliss was probably a better representative, and a better leader for Tienedo than I was, as when I took a 3-week break away from the server due to going on holiday, Tienedo was, at the time of leaving, still somewhat of a backwater state. We had a good few citizens, and a fair amount of resources, but the shifting power blocs and large megastates such as the Realm of Light, Moria, Lakeheart etc. overshadowed us really. We were alright, but we weren't anything major. A lot of our resources and aid came from other nations, mainly Komarni and in the packages from Omnitopia that were sent out to most nations on CivEx a while back. Back then, we had very few horses (if any), no library, no major legislative building and the President's house was basically a one-bedroom shack built from spare jungle materials.  I return back from my break, and Bliss had took control of the state at my request during my leave. I returned back to find a Tienedo that had far better relations with its neighbors, far larger supplies of all manner of resources, food and goods, and a MASSIVELY grown population from Wendatine and UCSM migrants and citizens that moved to Tienedo. Not only that, but the state also had a major influx of newfriends and old members of CivEx looking for a peaceful Tropical getaway. These people, with the guidance of citizens such as Bliss, TheTarcin, PoisonedPeace, Superp0ulet and many others built wonders such as the Cheicascus, the huge statue of Aktzin the First of the Old Tienedese Republic, the world-renowned Wild Ocelot Inn and many other great, wondrous constructions.  *Bliss was the one who pioneered the Union of Southern Nations, the largest (in terms of member-states) alliance on CivEx. *  Even when I returned, I left most of my duties as president to her, and while I feel that she was up to the task and willing, I feel rather guilty for leaving my duties as president to her. I wanted to host elections and let the public decide, but WW3 came, as well as the Nuclear Craze, so that never took off.  I really look forward to working with Bliss, as well as many other people from former USN nations such as FaerFoxx, Nathanial Jones, Szaro, Zef and a whole host of other people in creating the Republic of Verrenteros on CivEx 2.0, as I wanna say that:  You guys are not just great allies, you're great friends too, and that's pretty awesome.  So yeah, there you go. I'm not sure if ""best player"" is the phrase to describe Bliss, but she, and if you're reading this, you, did a pretty amazing job of raising our Nation into a CivEx-wide superpower, and I'm grateful for the memories of building the awesome structures, fending off countless dragons on Crethao Port and making Tienedo Tienedo.   TL;DR- Bliss, because Tienedo wouldn't be the same otherwise, and neither would CivEx."

CivilizatonExperiment,3cbhuz,GravekeepersGod,3,Mon Jul 6 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"Well then, what were you trying to do when you asked  ""Draconis 2.0 lead by chaseowen isn't tied to Draconis 1.0 lead by chaseowen they just happen to be the same name and have the same leader?""  I doubt it was just out of curiosity. You were insinuating that we were starting Draconis 2.0, which we're not. We're actually trying to do something good for this world."
CivilizatonExperiment,3cbhuz,FaerFoxx,2,Mon Jul 6 17:33:38 2015 UTC,"Well it is pretty obvious what I was saying there. Chaseowen had a nation before named Draconis. Now he has a nation again named Draconis. I was saying it is weird that it was completely unrelated name wise when they are the same name. Are you saying Draconis 1.0 didn't do any good for the world? I think some players might not like hearing you say all the work they did was not good. Rex did a lot of work with HIS Draconis protection service, I'm sure some people thought that was at least a little good for the server."

CivilizatonExperiment,3cad67,mcWinton,3,Mon Jul 6 12:31:01 2015 UTC,"For those who can't read the blog post  A different subject today: Staff interaction    The Civilization Experiment network requires maintenance, updates and moderation. As staff members, we are here to fulfill those duties. Today, we'd like to talk about moderation in general on the server.  Since the start of 1.0, we have been focussing on providing the fairest experience regarding banning players and such. While we tried our hardest to fulfill this goal, it's a very difficult thing. With the guidelines we had on CivEx 1.0, there were chances of us having prejudice against players. While we definitely don't have any prejudice, we would like to prevent any accusations of us being biased.  To prevent this from happening, we would like to tell the server about the new guidelines we'll be following on the launch of CivEx 2.0.  What is our plan?  Our current plan is the following:  The entire staff team will be founding a nation which will not be engaging in politics and will have little to no interaction with the rest of the community besides occasional trade. An admin has the choice to not be part of any nation or government, thus becoming a nomad. If an admin would want to live elsewhere and not become a nomad, he would sadly have to give up his right to decide on controversial matters that affect individual or several players.  We are still experimenting with this subject, and these guidelines might change in the future. This is also the reason why this post seem might a bit short; we need to discuss the smaller details more to make sure we're making the right decisions.  This post is being made on our blog and our subreddit, because this is not about the gameplay or the map but the way we handle the server and moderate it; something which is important and should be announced clearly to the entire community.  We would also like to show one of the latest images of our map before we end this post, since we felt it was a little short."

CivilizatonExperiment,3cad67,NotYetASaint,2,Mon Jul 6 13:44:55 2015 UTC,"My two cents about this.        This is a dangerous game, whenever you like it or not you could potentially be invaded by raiders backed by a nation or something like that. This could potentially lead to an event where the staff has to just give away their items or retaliate which could set off a chain reaction.       I propose these changes, first of all, get alts. This will keep the mods an ingame secrecy and further protect them against hate. Secondly, and this is a revolutionary idea, but have the mods rotate nations from a set period of time to a set period of time. Having mods in multiple nations will level out the balance between the mods. No bullshit should be called because there should be a mod on each side of the conflict. Thirdly, have the mods present evidence in each persons banning, publicly, this will put the community at rest. Lastly, give the mods a public spreadsheet that they will put what they are working on. And if it is a game changing element, wait till there is a time of peace before implementing it."

CivilizatonExperiment,3cad67,novov,2,Mon Jul 6 17:43:07 2015 UTC,"My thoughts:  I don't particularly like the fact that admins can trade with players, and that admins can join other nations but will give up their ""right to decide on controversial matters"". That seems a bit vague and I can easily see such a boundary being manipulated as to what constitutes controversial matters, so I think it's easiest for all of us if they can't interact at all physically in-game with the community."

Most admin tools included teleport.    Admins have different goals for players.  Players want your ""proper experience"" and admins want to create an awesome server full of awesome people.  Players make cities and nations.  Admins make servers.  They craft them, tend to them, and expand on them to make them thrive.  They get their own ""proper experience"" in their own way.    Sure, admins can also want to be players that are involved in things.  That's natural.  But being both can lead to temptation to use admin powers and knowledge in their role as a player.  It has been done before here.  And that's not only unfair to play with, but even the suspicion of such interference can cause upset feelings in others."

CivilizatonExperiment,3cbwbl,ritzycat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:58:56 2015 UTC,Thanks sharp :P
CivilizatonExperiment,3cbwbl,ritzycat,2,Mon Jul 6 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"In theory, all of your points are perfectly consistent with the goal of creating a realistic civ-style server. However, it wouldn't be very fun.  Enchantments are fine where they are. If we increase the efficacy of enchanting, we will further drive a divide between players who have recently joined and do not have such gear, and those who have been here longer and have been able to amass it all. In addition, to compensate for the reduced maximum enchantments on here, damage potions are disabled, along with others (I don't recall which ones).  I find Prot 4 and Sharp 2 and damage potions toxic and only goes to directly promote a straight pvp gameplay that isn't what this server is intending to create.   I also do not approve of your ideas on altering the rules on griefing. The premise that ""if a city ran out of room to grow"" is moot because I have never seen a city that has run out of room to grow, there is vast amount of space between settlements on CivEx 1.0, it would take years before these cities would run out of room. No need for libensraum on here. In addition, ""leveling"" a city has no positive benefits for anyone whatsoever. That is just not a productive action."
CivilizatonExperiment,3cbwbl,Sharpcastle33,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:46:03 2015 UTC,"I don't see what's wrong with having the players that have been on longer having an edge over someone who just joined, wouldn't it be a positive thing to have something to show for your time? Besides, making prot IV is a relative challenge at first, but as long as you have a decent supply of diamonds and xp a single person could hammer out a few sets on his first day with no sweat. If anything, the higher level enchantments would give players something to strive for over time, if they had trouble reaching them alone, then they would have to team up with others to get the best possible gear, which is a good thing in of itself. As for cities running out of room to grow, you're right, they won't ever do that even at the rate people are making towns for 2.0. But what will happen is that small towns will claim obscene amounts of land they'll never use, stretching themselves way too thin (The current map is a prime example). If their buildings get in the way of taking that land back, then there's nothing anyone can do to about it, since leveling cities is currently against the rules. That's why I want only towns that have declared war with each other to be able to grief, to allow for that possibility. This is also so they can sabotage their enemy's means of production by destroying mines, stables, etc."
CivilizatonExperiment,3cbwbl,ritzycat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"I don't see what's wrong with having the players that have been on longer having an edge over someone who just joined, wouldn't it be a positive thing to have something to show for your time?   True, but Prot 4 is not really necessary to have such an effect. You can have more to show for your time than just the quality of your armor and weapons. Most people do not like to sit around and grind for Prot 4 armor anyway, and it is much more sensible to keep it at Prot 2 so players do not have to grind as long and new players who are trying to start a nation are not immediately slammed into the ground by people wielding equipment much better than their own (if they have any)  I don't think I'm understanding this sentence:   If their buildings get in the way of taking that land back, then there's nothing anyone can do to about it, since leveling cities is currently against the rules.   Who's taking who's land back, and what buildings are ""in the way"" of that?"
CivilizatonExperiment,3cbwbl,Sharpcastle33,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"Even if most people don't like making prot IV, some do, and I don't see why they shouldn't be allowed to make it, I mean if they're willing to put in the time, they should be allowed to get the best armor the game has to offer. As for slamming new players in the ground, anyone rude enough to spend his time doing that is going to do so regardless of if he has prot IV or not, not to mention that the guys stopping him will also be able to make their own prot IV (or buy it). If anything, prot IV production would be a great way for new players to make a lot of cash in a short amount of time, they could sell to rich players who are too lazy/busy to make their own. What I mean about the buildings and land claims is that it's easy for any player, regardless of how many people are working with him, to claim all the land he wants because there's no rule against it, and if he builds along his borders or just in any good location, it doesn't matter if he only gets on once a month and lives alone, an army of 30 people couldn't take that land from him because they can't do a thing about his buildings."

One could even speculate that Luni did what he did in your defense. (I mean, it worked, didn't it?)  Point is, while I'm all for leaving 1.0 in the past, the fact that a war against you was literally put on hold can't really be brushed aside.  That said, even if there were no POS orders out on you, maaaybe it might be best if it was a staff member or admin who was put in charge of that. Even if there's no Luni scenario, letting someone get a perfect snapshot of all ores and secret chests is definitely a no-go."
CivilizatonExperiment,3cahot,HeyItsBliss,2,Mon Jul 6 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"Mapping the map != Luni's snapshot.  I'd imagine many people are trying to figure out ways to get the world mapped as quickly as possible.

CivilizatonExperiment,3c7zru,turtlechef,3,Mon Jul 6 00:27:20 2015 UTC,"The flag of Verrenteros is a three diagonal striped flag of light blue, white, and dark blue. Together they stand for the endless sky above us, the snowy lands that make our home, and the diamonds that are under the ground below.     Do you have insider information, or are you guys operating under the assumption that ore gen in 2.0 will be the same as 1.0?"
CivilizatonExperiment,3c7zru,zefmiller,2,Sun Jul 5 20:19:08 2015 UTC,"Yup, I bribed /u/GoldenAppleGuy again.  No, we're assuming that nothing too drastic will change in between releases. If it does, or we find something an obvious roadblock, we're flexible enough to be able to change or adapt our plans. Nobody's nation is final right now, and I think everyone will have to adapt for these changes in 2.0."
CivilizatonExperiment,3c7zru,AshGoSmash,3,Sun Jul 5 20:22:23 2015 UTC,"Which direction do you see yourselves adapting? Is the mountaintop castle more important, or being on top of the diamond field? I'm just being curious for the sake of conversation."
CivilizatonExperiment,3c7zru,RaxusAnode,7,Sun Jul 5 20:27:19 2015 UTC,"Likely we'll keep the idea of the castle. I don't think the plan of keeping a town entirely in a fortress castle has ever been done in CivEx. That was one of the unique things we're hoping to bring to 2.0 above anything else. There's also the logistics of building on a mountain to what will essentially be newfriends. But I think we have a large enough population and, of course, a way of quickly keeping in touch, that we can sort out these issues early or as they arise.  I'm also quite enjoying how a majority of new announced nations are swinging to medieval Europe styles and ideas, granted with a lot of creativity and variation in implementation. However, I think there's going to be a lot of hardship in store for everyone, both from finding old tricks won't work anyomore, adapting to new server mechanics, and the general mayhem of claims without a full map release. We all took the map for granted. :)"
CivilizatonExperiment,3c7zru,RaxusAnode,4,Sun Jul 5 20:36:19 2015 UTC,"Neither, we'll move the diamond field to us with silk touch picks"
CivilizatonExperiment,3c7zru,Devonmartino,3,Sun Jul 5 20:36:11 2015 UTC,Pretty much what Bliss said. We've discussed it a lot and we really like the castle idea. Having one structure that everyone is a part of building results in large builds being completed pretty quickly (as we proved with the Ohana Volcano).   Plus this fortress is designed to create a close nit community. No one will ever feel alone in our country because everyone will live so close together that there'll always be someone else near by. Our resources (whatever they end up being) will be shared by the community and the builds will all be cooperative. That's what's important to us.

CivilizatonExperiment,3c5l4c,Derpyfish129,3,Sun Jul 5 00:48:19 2015 UTC,The only real problem with that is timing and editing. I work a lot and don't have a huge amount of free time to do the interview. And if I do get the interview it'll be hard to edit it in the style I'm going for (a 1930's radio broadcast).  So I've been trying to figure out a way around both those problems. I think my solution might be to send people interview questions and then have them record their answers to those questions and send me the audio file.

CivilizatonExperiment,3c06op,Defmork,14,Fri Jul 3 16:22:37 2015 UTC,"""Hurr durr we need to make the staff more professional"", he said.  ""Hurr durr I will try to act more mature next time"", he said.  How old are you? 7? 14? Display? A person of your age should know better than this, for phax sake. Or it isn't your age that is to be blamed for this sun-dried shit, but your swamp-german-ness? The swamp definitely obfuscated your mind, usurped all rationality, erased all traces of noble Germanic pride and intelligence.  I had a friend once, who told me something I would never forget: ""In order to achieve what you love, you need to destroy what you hate."". This friend later went on to study arithmetics and establish a communist society in Australia, called ""The Red Dingos"" while simultaneously trying to ban chocolate milk sold without a straw attached to the box.  This doesn't have a single bit to do with the issue on hand, but it ought to remind you of the fact that there will always be at least two people living at the same time on the Earth that hate you, and want to annihilate you.  But, of course, this doesn't solve anything. The thing is, why would you write ""penis"" in a Weekly Discussion Thread? Is this what you're thinking about? Is this what you desire? Is this what you lack? Number 1 and 2 would be concerning, due to your age, number 3 wouldn't surprise me one bit.  Just think about it like this: There are hundreds, no thousands of people that wrote ""penis"" on a public discussion thread. Did you ever hear that any of them made it to something big? Did anyone land on the moon and say ""I wouldn't have been able to pull this off without having written 'penis' on my schooldesk""? Did anyone defeat ISIS and claim ""Writing 'penis' in my school book helped me acquire sick gainz and kill Suq ma-Diq.  You see, history repeats itself. It repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats itself. Over and over again. Resisting it is futile, your life has been decided upon before you were even born.  You know, this is funny. Just yesterday I was hunting sharks in the Ukrainian steppe and thought to myself ""Huh, imagine if Phaxar wrote ""penis"" on the discussion thread tomorrow. This would be so silly, haha!"". 17 shark teeth, two torn cervices and a mildly confused Mexican immigrant later I have to return to this abomination of a reply, and am wondering ""what in the everloving fuck phaxar why would you even do this I mean like what the fuck dude no shit what are you doing why for gods sake no dont do this haha you idiot"".  Long story short, fuck you and fuck socialism.  edit: spelling"

CivilizatonExperiment,3bxgvg,Prisinorzero,3,Thu Jul 2 23:35:07 2015 UTC,"Quick question.  How will the Demeter plugin work exactly? By that, I mean, will I be able to survive a long journey by alternating between bread and steak, or will I have to carry an entire row of different foods?     Alternatively Additionally, might I suggest that you add a crafting recipe for something along the lines of ""Hardtack?""- perhaps a ""Lunchbox?""- which would be crafted from, say, steak, bread, and a carrot, and could be eaten repeatedly with no penalty?   Just spitballing here."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bxgvg,Devonmartino,5,Fri Jul 3 01:14:51 2015 UTC,"How will the Demeter plugin work exactly? By that, I mean, will I be able to survive a long journey by alternating between bread and steak, or will I have to carry an entire row of different foods?     Here's how it works.    At the moment, we have two configurable values; the max amount of food you can consume before it's worthless (MAX), and the amount of minutes per update cycle (T).    Every time you consume some food, it's added to your history. The amount of hunger restoration you restore (RESTORE) is dependent on the amount of the food type you have in your food history (HISTORY), the normal amount of hunger restoration the food performs (NORM) and MAX. The function is:    RESTORE = NORM * (MAX - HISTORY) / MAX    Note that RESTORE must always be an integer, so because of this, we round to the nearest integer.    Every T minutes, all foods in your history are reduced by 1. This means if you want to be get full hunger restoration from foods again, just wait a while. Note that your food history will only be reduced if you are online.    So for an example. Let's say we set our MAX to 100, and then we give you 100 cook steaks. You haven't eaten it before, so your HISTORY is 0. Cooked steak by default restores 8 hunger. The first time you have a steak, it'll restore:    8 * (100 - 0) / 100 = 8. You get the full effects from it since this is your first time.    Next time:    8 * (100 - 1) / 100 = 8 * 0.99 = 7.92 ~ 8. The calculated value was 7.92, but since we round to the nearest integer, you restore 8. Again, the full restoration.    Let's say, now, you've consumed 50:    8 * (100 - 50) / 100 = 8 * 0.5 = 4. You've consumed half the MAX amount of cooked steaks. As such, you receive half the restoration.     Additionally, might I suggest that you add a crafting recipe for something along the lines of ""Hardtack?""- perhaps a ""Lunchbox?""- which would be crafted from, say, steak, bread, and a carrot, and could be eaten repeatedly with no penalty?     Interesting idea. I don't think it's something we're interested in adding at the moment, but we'll reevaluate in the future after we've seen how you guys are handling the effects this plugin will have."

One more thing, though- not to nag, but could you give a ballpark for how you're planning to implement the MAX integer? In other words, will certain foods have higher MAX values? Also, can you give a ballpark estimate of what the MAX will be? (10, 50, 64, 100?) Last thing- can you give a ballpark estimate for TIME?

CivilizatonExperiment,3bxgvg,tylertoon2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:32:16 2015 UTC,"Otherwise people would just make stacks and stacks of those.   If they required steak, bread, and a carrot, I agree that it would be a bit easy to make. However, if we added, say, a melon to the mix, it would require foods from multiple different biomes in order to make one lunchbox. Thus, it would require trade and careful food-production planning.  This is besides the fact that seasons will make it tougher to farm stuff. It's not supposed to be that hard."

They will be up for election every three months, so there can always be a constant flow of ideas.   Currently I plan on building in a spruce forest with stone and nether bricks as the main blocks.

CivilizatonExperiment,3bupn1,novov,8,Thu Jul 2 08:34:35 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, there shouldn't be one meganation.   We actually discussed if we would wait with our announcement untill the launch of the server or instead post it before that. Obviously, we decided to post it in advance. We wanted to make people aware of our nation so they could re-think their plans and perhaps even merge with other nations to form a meganation aswell."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bupn1,ThePimpShrimp,4,Thu Jul 2 08:54:48 2015 UTC,"Actually, I feel like a meganation would pressure smaller nations to confederate against a common threat, leaving the world with 2 or 3 big powers."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bupn1,flameoguy,6,Thu Jul 2 12:11:03 2015 UTC,I hope such a thing will happen
CivilizatonExperiment,3bupn1,ThePimpShrimp,2,Thu Jul 2 12:30:33 2015 UTC,"That would likely suck actually. There will be no conflict because any conflict results in a massive war, and especially if there are alliances between the few giant powers. No one could even realistically set up a new nation with any vague amount of power. Overall it would basicly remove all diplomacy and stuff between most nations, because all you have to do is make an alliance between the 2-3 mega nations and you've basicly won the game and it's smooth sailing from there."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bupn1,Nathanial_Jones,3,Thu Jul 2 14:20:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  Noone has an idea what will happen if there will be 2-3 meganations, but you're claiming you have perfect insight on what will happen. I expect politics for example to become a major aspect on the server.    No one could even realistically set up a new nation with any vague amount of power   That sounds logical. I don't see why a newly made nation should have any power."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bupn1,ThePimpShrimp,3,Thu Jul 2 14:32:30 2015 UTC,"But I doubt any new nations will even have the kind of power of these mega nations that are forming now. It would be very unlikely that they'll be able to grow to such a size as 30 people and even if they do they'll still have to catch up in terms of resources and infrastructure.  Here's my reasoning why there won't be much diplomacy:  You have 2-3 mega nations, and the rest of the nation's are fairly small in comparison. At least two of the mega nations ally. Now they have a good 1/4-1/3 (if not more) of the servers population combined. They don't have to worry about war, period. I highly doubt sanctions would matter either. Now what? What diplomacy do you do? If all the smaller nations just make a big alliance, now all you've done is make it so that every war is a world war, which no one will want."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bupn1,Nathanial_Jones,4,Thu Jul 2 14:42:21 2015 UTC,"Wyck had 6 active members, joined the server after 4 months of it existing, and became an integral part of RoL. Any nation that wants to can become a superpower."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bupn1,mcWinton,2,Thu Jul 2 15:12:15 2015 UTC,There wasn't the kind of super powers that are forming now back then.
CivilizatonExperiment,3bupn1,Nathanial_Jones,3,Thu Jul 2 15:14:27 2015 UTC,"It's not like mega-nations are going to be crushing every little nation out there. New small nations might start behind but there is a very real tech cap that any nation can reach quickly, merge, and just like that you have a new mega-nation. Not every nation wants to be a super power, but if you do there's literally nothing stopping you."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bupn1,mcWinton,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:59:32 2015 UTC,I very much still have my doubts on how likely that will happen. I think you underestimate the difficulty of recruiting as a small nation.

CivilizatonExperiment,3bupn1,Nathanial_Jones,2,Thu Jul 2 14:33:07 2015 UTC,"CivEx still has plenty of differences to the real world. One is that fact that smaller nations matter less in CivEx. You don't need an ally do you can have a base on the other side of the world, because you can ride across the world in 20 minutes anyway.

CivilizatonExperiment,3btk2f,hthor35,10,Thu Jul 2 01:02:54 2015 UTC,"Hi!  Right now we're actually in between map resets, likely why things are so confusing. :) While the old map (1.0) is still up, it's essentially dead. The new map (2.0), which will run 1.8, is due sometime between this July-August. I would check back in a couple of weeks. Custom maps don't make themselves.  We're a civilization server with a few plugins that help it make it easier to play the game. You can join or start a new nation, claim land, trade, and essentially try to survive and make alliances and not die. Because if you tick people off, it's a world war. It's incredibly fun. For example, CivEx uses a plugin called RealisticBiomes that makes biomes only produce certain food/mobs, and also make it so that it's harder to live in colder or hotter biomes without dying. We also bounty criminals, griefers, and thieves, and can punish them with an unwanted vacation to the End. There's a lot of slang, but most people will explain if you don't understand.  Because we're, again, between map resets, you can of course participate in the sub and get a feel for the community as well as getting updates on the status of the map. Hopefully you'll stay for the wait, because it's worth it."

Thank you so much for this, have there been many world wars? and also how is the independant nation thing, like if i were to make a nation/faction/whatever would people recognise me as a sovereign ruler even if i only had a small tract of land and maybe one follower? or would they just ignore me like sealand and europe  Thanks again"
CivilizatonExperiment,3btk2f,gohkamikaze,4,Thu Jul 2 01:19:45 2015 UTC,"There's been three world wars, the most recent came to a close because of the map reset.  In terms of nations, most people complain about people having one-man fiefdoms but generally you'll be left to your own devices. I lived on my own for a while, and while there was a fair bit of regional instability in my neck of the woods I was left alone. Why that was I never really understood tbh, /u/1234Fireball why didn't you attack Twin Peaks?  It's generally more advantageous to join a civ though. Having your independence and freedom is pretty cool but in order to get a serious foothold anywhere you need other people to back you up and support you."
CivilizatonExperiment,3btk2f,HeyItsBliss,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:33:27 2015 UTC,"Like in real life and sealand, one man fiefdoms dont get to much power right? because thats seems realistic and all also side note is Icelandic Republic a real thing?  Edit: also how do the world wars work"
CivilizatonExperiment,3btk2f,HeyItsBliss,3,Thu Jul 2 01:36:56 2015 UTC,"The Icelandic Republic formed up with its neighbors into the Northlands. One man claims generally don't get much power, yes, but it's often accepted that one player is generally equal around a million actual people IRL. Nations average around five-twenty players, so around twenty million people could exist in one city.  Triccam was a one-man nation for a bit due to some people deciding to just raid and cause chaos, but alliances saved him from losing his claim and it grew back again.  World wars work by ticking off another nation, and then said nation comes in with swords and raid your land/pop chests. Then hopefully your alliances come through and help you. :)"

CivilizatonExperiment,3btk2f,DisarmingBaton5,3,Thu Jul 2 22:07:29 2015 UTC,"No, people would recognize you as a ruler, even if you have a one person claim. It's generally frowned upon, and most people choose to live nomadically for a short time and join already established nations instead and then start their own later. But everyone has to start somewhere, and a lot of nations actually started with one person.  If you kept building, trading, being active, etc, nobody would take your claim. Still, while people don't often invade claims, if you don't make friends you might find your neighbors casually vassaling you. :P  We've had two official world wars, and a lot of smaller wars and I suppose the USN War was nicknamed WWIII. But WWIII didn't get to involve many nations due to the fact that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named ""nuked"" the map and forced a reset. This is also frowned upon on CivEx."

CivilizatonExperiment,3btk2f,SuperWizard68,3,Thu Jul 2 02:22:55 2015 UTC,"WOOOOOW WHAT!!! he nuked the map isnt this vanilla minecraft?   ""Nuke"" is just a nickname to explain what Luni did. He released the entire map, with all of the ores and secret bases, thus ""nuking"" or making the map unfair to play on. We like slang here, and explaining out-of-game events with in-game terms.   do they randomly take and give back my indipendence when useful to them or what?   That's about it! Often you'll end up pearled (trapped in the End) in somebody's vault, too, if you're too annoying. Sometimes you'll just be absorbed into that nation, sometimes you'll lose everything and they'll make you work for your freedom.   do i swear faulty to them?   That depends on how role-playing they are, or how much of an asshole they are. Really swings either way.   cuz i dont mind, i can be a lord or a duke or something   Fair enough, but I'd imagine the politics in that would be amazing. :)"

CivilizatonExperiment,3btk2f,mossfire,2,Thu Jul 2 04:11:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, thank you for catching that mistake :P Fixed  I'm not a super large expert on the first, at the time I was busy with irl stuff, so I didn't have a chance to fulfill my army duties sadly. I only really know that Moria and the Federation were largely involved. I summon /u/GetNGoingV-1 to explain this, I'm not an expert on it.  As for WWII, it was mainly Moria and Realm of Light. (Realm on Light is a large nation as well as Moria. RoL actually contains the Federation during this time as well) It's a bit of a long story as to how it started, so if I make a confusing point somewhere, point it out to me and I'll explain it better!  I'd say maybe a month before WWII, Luni was mistakenly banned from the server for was appeared to be botting. (See server rule number 4) It was cleared up, and he was unbanned, and it was issued a mistaken mess. Everything went back to the way it was, except for one thing. Everyone was super on edge. WWII almost started when he was banned, and then now that he's unbanned we all tried to forget this, but everything remained super tense between everyone and their alliances.  A month later, a bounty hunter comes into Moria and informs us about plans that RoL has to attack us. I believe the word Annex was tossed around. Lionheart, the second King of Moria at the time, decided to just prepare and wait for it. He did not publicly authorize a movement against RoL first. In Moria, we had a citizen named Personthatisreal. He's likely the most skilled PvPer on the server, and he had a large bunker underway. He was present when Moria received word of this, and despite no authorized strike against RoL, he decided to go and start attacking them. Numerous raids happened, and while the first few were unplanned and not official, Moria eventually made it official and thus WWII started taking place. I believe most nations decided to sit out on it, and I'm not an expert anymore on who was exactly aiding RoL, but on the Morian side, there was mainly Moria, and the Kuren Empire. (We're great allies with Kuren, GetNGoing was our first military Head General, and he left to found it, but we maintained splendid relations.)  WWII ended when Person had enough fighting, and quit/was banned from the server. King Lionheart and Shogun GetNGoing both quit the server, and left. Quite a sad time for me, they are both very dear friends of mine. GetN was also pearled when he left. Moria was in shambles, our roughly 20-25 population reduced to maybe 6. Our diplomatic situation was not in the greatest shape either. During WWII I was not a soldier of the Morian Army anymore, I was the Official Diplomat of Moria, trying to stop RoL and several other nations from breaking into us and pearling us all using the weapon of words. Lionheart left, and crowned myself as the new King of Moria right before he left.  After another small conflict at Person's own bunker deep into Moria, both RoL and us were tired of fighting. We made peace, and put down our differences for a while. I still take 50% of the credit for ending WWII though.  That's the nice version, I didn't want to bring up some stuff that would bring a bit of nasty feelings again. :P"

We're working very hard on getting 2.0 done, but we also don't want to deliver a half-finished project. Once we have an ETA, we will immediately notify you about it. Stay tuned.   Vs.   As you know, we have had plans for 2.0 and had been working on it for months when the incident regarding the map upload occured. This forced us to announce 2.0 ahead of schedule, and to drastically tighten our time schedule in order to have a chance on releasing it timely, and to keep CivEx alive.

CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,ritzycat,6,Wed Jul 1 11:20:26 2015 UTC,Welcome to CivEx arguments.
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,Dnessen,5,Wed Jul 1 13:59:33 2015 UTC,"This isn't true, bearcat is just starting drama again. We started the war against Komarni for the reasons in FaerFoxx's out-of-context images as well as the additional reasons I had posted on several other threads (which I can repost here if the judgmental, dismissive, rude players of the server so demand, since everyone on this reddit is perpetually seeking an argument). It would be appreciated if all of you others stop trying to find absurd reasons to hate me even more.  Although I distrusted Luni from the beginning from the first time my friends and I entered TeamSpeak and were greeted with the comment ""Here's the ROM circlejerk"", succeeded by several "" ^ "" in the TeamSpeak chat, before many of them promptly left the channel. Rude as fuck and did not give me a good first impression of the server's most influential players. Note this is a long time before any type of drama spawned between ROM-C and FaerFoxx's Furry Pact Of Players That Agree With FaerFoxx And Support FaerFoxx No Matter What.  That being said it was Luni's unfounded dislike of me & my group that started the tensions, and in all honesty based on his personality I was not surprised when he did this. However, I did not completely predict that he was planning to release the server map, and I wouldn't have thought attacking Komarni would have been an appropriate resolution to such a problem.  I also find it a bit hilarious that FaerFoxx is dubbing Lakeheart ""evil"". Is it a coincidence they were the only friends that ROM-C had? Clearly everyone who ever showed any type of sympathy for our group deserves to die and thrown in the graveyard with the rest of the Ritzies. I don't think using terms like that is going to get us anywhere.  A new server is coming, and its time for you all to throw your bizarre grudges and prejudices in the trash. I have announced plans for a new nation for 2.0 yet we are still called ""crazy"" before we dared to overthrow the oppressive circlejerk that FaerFoxx had assembled, with half the server coming to defend everything she does or says without any forethought."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,ritzycat,2,Wed Jul 1 08:14:05 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that all of the above behaviour is wrong. Pretending that you own side did not do anything similar is also totally wrong however.  For example you just decided to go into an unnecessary rant and detail that could have easily been avoided in the name of cooperation, despite saying that everyone should 'throw your bizarre grudges and prejudices in the trash'"
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,novov,3,Wed Jul 1 08:47:53 2015 UTC,"I am not going to argue that I am completely free of sin and a righteous child of God, but the type of behavior that I've experienced here is of a different sort than what I've inflicted upon this group of players. Here we have FaerFoxx calling players ""evil"", others have wished me bad omens outside of CivEx for knocking down their e-legos, many players find themselves content with being an asshole to me whenever possible. My dislike for Komarni & FaerFoxx was borne out of a belief that Komarni was spearheading an oppressive, coercive circlejerk among most of the veteran players on the server (with the exception of Lakeheart, who she now calls ""evil""). My reasons for attacking Komarni & FaerFoxx were politically motivated. I never reverted to personal attacks and name-calling as has been the habit of many players, and I still hold my half-joking out-of-context messages to FaerFoxx to be reasoning for why I dislike her personality.  Some people are simply unwilling to grant me any degree of pride, accomplishment, etc. appearing on all of my posts to post rude comments or to downvote them. This is all over, and I am exhausted of 100-post Reddit arguments over junk as redundant as pseudo-claiming the End."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,ritzycat,2,Wed Jul 1 11:14:26 2015 UTC,"You do realize that Komarni wasn't actually very imperialistic right? Like basicly all of their land were given to them voluntarily by others. And then they later gave away land they weren't using, which was quite a sizable part of their country. Your country has been way more imperialistic, trying to claim vast tracks of land in the desert, and trying to claim the entire end to yourselves (Luni tried to do the same by the way, and there was just as much backlash, so once again disproving you idea that there is a secret Illuninati of all the powerful countries).  As well I think you are extremely hipocritical talking about the ""ROM hate circle jerk"" considering that you guys were the one hating basicly every nation that has ties to Komarni."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,Nathanial_Jones,2,Wed Jul 1 11:34:14 2015 UTC,"not throwing the dead horse in the furnace and eating its cooked meat anymore about Komarni imperialism. our desert claims were a joke, we were never planning to keep them for any length of time hence why we got rid of them. Our end claim was partially a joke as well, since we simply named it ""Heaven"" and said that anyone could use it for whatever they wanted to. Ironically next to no one ever willingly came to use it after our claim despite the 100+ posts made in an attempt to keep it "" free"" .  i don't hate anyone on here lol. No idea why you think we were hating ""basicly every nation that has ties to Komarni"", no, I dislike them because they dislike us because they are required to if they are to be friends of FaerFoxx. After we attacked Komarni nobody cared to know why and jumped on the anti-ROM hate train (if they weren't already) because that's the socially acceptable thing to do here on CivEx."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,ritzycat,2,Wed Jul 1 16:34:47 2015 UTC,"When you attack a nation for no reason, suprise surprise their freinds might not like you. Everyone knows why, and they still don't like you for it.  The claims hardly looked like a joke, especially since you tried defending them quite a bit in the comments. And you said anyone could use it, except for anyone you decided couldn't. See the issue?"
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,Nathanial_Jones,2,Wed Jul 1 16:57:47 2015 UTC,"The dislike the FaerFoxx Coalition had against my group went as far back as when we first joined the server. It was only put on full display when we dared to attack the Queen of CivEx.  I'm telling you here right now the claims were a joke. I don't care what they ""looked"" like to you. It was a huge ass flippin' cross in the desert."

CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,janne-bananne,5,Wed Jul 1 18:44:05 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, the war with Komarni was obviously 100% about stopping Luni from releasing the map weeks in advance of even Luni thinking about doing it.   It was completely not even a little bit related to the reasons that you guys made very clearly outlined multiple times in game and over TS every time when asked prior to this, you know, that it was because I was a girl, used emotes, have the name FaerFoxx, have a fox girl Minecraft skin, etc...  The war was totally about saving the server! How else would we all be safe if the farm animals were not killed and the chests raided? If only we didn't spend days getting its sheep farms back, the map never would have been released... :|  /s"
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,FaerFoxx,2,Wed Jul 1 06:36:24 2015 UTC,I'm glad WWIII didn't happen though :P  I was literally about to make Moria get involved like a day after the day that Luni messed up and released the map. Saved us some unnecessary trouble.

It does not say the Lakeheart Dominion is going to war.  Besides, they would not have the authority to declare war for the Dominion, as there was not a vote on the matter."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,bbgun09,5,Wed Jul 1 14:19:34 2015 UTC,"When people make a statement like that in the name of Lakeheart and come in swinging swords and pearling, you can't just come back two weeks later and pretend that it wasn't really an attack.  Unfortunately we're having to live with everything Lakeheart has done to the USN, even if you want to pass it off as it didn't happen because there wasn't a vote. The fact that pisses me, pisses me off the most is that I trusted you and your word and Lakeheart not to absolutely stab me in the back.  Lesson fucking learned."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,HeyItsBliss,4,Wed Jul 1 14:36:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry that I can't control members of a nation in not even the leader of.  This is exactly why I am not joining the nation they are founding in the new map. Clearly their word is meaningless. I intend to create a nation with some of the ideals of Lakeheart, but have them enforced and bound by law.  What you don't understand is that I spent the entirety of the week leading up to the war trying to stop it. A war that would probably have been declared a week before it was with the full support of the active citizenry of the suspect nations had I not done so. You forget that the only real reason I wasn't able to stop the war, admittedly with major help from others, was that one of the USN uploaded the map effectively destroying the playability of the server.  All I want is to create civilization. Then, if fate requires, defend it."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,bbgun09,5,Wed Jul 1 15:04:21 2015 UTC,"Your ""suspect"" USN nations had no war planned, never did. The fact that you claim they could attack isn't even funny. Faer and what army? Luni?  I tried to defend Tienedo, and your friends came and pearled my citizens and had the Federation hunting me and my friends and my allies down. Members of a trade alliance which you all turned into the monster under CivEx's bed.   Then, if fate requires, defend it.   I suppose you'll doing the same thing as I was now."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,HeyItsBliss,2,Wed Jul 1 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you are attacking me in this conversation.

CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,bbgun09,2,Wed Jul 1 21:13:00 2015 UTC,"I mean, basicly your entire leadership attacked. That's pretty much means Lakeheart attacked. Of course there's technicalities, but either way it was pretty obvious what happened."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,Nathanial_Jones,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:17:31 2015 UTC,2 members of our 20 member country attacked. You cannot equate that to the entire country.
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,bbgun09,2,Wed Jul 1 14:20:21 2015 UTC,"Your country apperently joined an alliance, the alliance attacked, which apperently includes your nation. Weather this was legal or not is the real question, however weather Lakeheart was at war or not isn't."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bq0yz,Nathanial_Jones,2,Wed Jul 1 14:28:14 2015 UTC,"So if Nightfall declared war on the Federation, does that mean the while alliance went to war?  AFAIAC Lakeheart did not go to war. If any attack had been made against us on our soil it would have been a major violation of sovereignty and we would be completely justified in the permanent pearling of the attacking force.  Legality absolutely the question."

Littoral built a huge, man-made island. Triccam, which was actually finally picking up. Poor NatJones.  Any old players that remember me? I didn't even know there was a old Riveria. :/ But hi!  When is the new server going to come out? I'd be looking at around late July, early August. So way too friggin long. Server's still up, but dead. Something something creative server being put up for the wait.  New 2.0 stuff? Brandywine's rebuilding, subtle dongers everywhere ofc. Flameo's doing a underground city. RoL: Electric Boogaloo likely happening. Zombeh is going a Litch thing, Ritzies have lost their minds as usual and who knows what the hell they're doing anymore. DMartin's doing a religion that wasn't created by a bunch of loonies. Leetard's doing Druid things.

It would be wise to not ask about it, it's a messy story.  But other than that pretty much everything from the Jersey Boys broadway play. :P And some ELO"

CivilizatonExperiment,3bf05a,tacticalpie,8,Mon Jun 29 04:03:46 2015 UTC,"I think the main ""problem"" is that we both play the experiment in a different type of way. CivCraft is very economic based, where everyone is in the capitalistic fight to make the most diamonds. On the other side, CivEx is very political, with a greater focus on nations rather than individuals. Now is this a problem? Not at all, this shows how two different groups of people react in almost the same situation.  That's just IMHO."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bf05a,janne-bananne,2,Sun Jun 28 18:28:27 2015 UTC,"Well, not completely. CivEx is even more focused on worldbuilding than on real politics or real economy."

Civcraft is hugely socialist, with only one or two individuals trying to uphold Ancap ideals. But I understand what you roughly mean, capital wealth is seen as a high priority more so there than here."

CivilizatonExperiment,3bf05a,flameoguy,2,Mon Jun 29 08:54:28 2015 UTC,"I like civcraft, but it's a completely different type of server then this. The primary differences between the two servers is that Civcraft admins do not enforce any anti-griefing or anti-raiding rules, and that CivCraft is not focused on the conflicts of civs, but more or less the rise and fall of civilizations. Not to say there aren't civs that conflict there, but it's a different game.   The community is also slightly different, but a lot of slang, culture, and ideas have been borrowed from the CivCraft community. We still bounty people, just like CivCraft, and when we fulfill a bounty we 'pearl' and 'vault' the criminal, two words common on /r/civcraft. I dunno, it's really just a different type of server, with a different community.    Most of the hate comes from the some people that come over from CivCraft because they got banned or pearled to grief here, or the small, cancerous part of CivCraft that can act very... rude. I suppose that's more of an 'us vs them' scenario, although there really is no problem with the server."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bf05a,ritzycat,2,Sun Jun 28 20:22:56 2015 UTC,I don't specifically like CivCraft because there's too many players and it is literally impossible to get a foodhold or make a name for yourself. Senseless raiders are so commonplace they don't even get their moment of infamy. At least on a server like this you have a chance of overthrowing oppressive server circlejerks.

It's weird to think of a newborn beginning, perhaps replace ""newborn"" with ""new life"". Your syllable count breaks down in the last 3 lines. The poem is 5,5,7,7,5,6,12.

CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,Defmork,12,Sat Jun 27 13:08:29 2015 UTC,"Span of each season should be one week in my opinion, meaning a year in real life will equal a month in minecraft.  Spring: Best period to grow crops. Every crop can be farmed at the fastest speed.   Summer: Still able to grow all crops, but reduced speed.  Autumn: Limited crops available and same speed as summer.  Winter: Only a handful crops available for farming in the best biomes (forest/plains), but they grow super slow. Desert/snow biomes unable to grow anything.   Not taking into consideration what biome excels at what."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,ThePimpShrimp,9,Sat Jun 27 13:41:14 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it be a month in real life will equal a year in Minecraft?
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,Koala_With_The_Karma,2,Sat Jun 27 14:40:51 2015 UTC,"Uhh... I guess you can say either. The more I think about it, the more confusing it gets."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,ThePimpShrimp,5,Sat Jun 27 14:45:08 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it take 12 years for one year in Minecraft?
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,Xavienth,2,Sat Jun 27 14:51:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I like the idea of seasons being a week long as opposed to half a week long. Makes it more realistic?
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,IvetteAramis,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:50:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I prefer 1 week aswell?
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,Koala_With_The_Karma,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:38:46 2015 UTC,same
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,roboticmumbleman,5,Sat Jun 27 19:10:02 2015 UTC,"I'd like if seasons lasted half a week each, and during winter nothing should grow and during fall growth should be heavily reduced. Maybe make jungles unaffected by seasons would be a nice idea."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,Freddo3000,5,Sat Jun 27 13:14:01 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea of nothing growing or breeding in winter. Winter is coming, prepare!"
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,mcWinton,2,Sat Jun 27 13:37:12 2015 UTC,"RIP New Moria, we're screwed on crops"
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,SuperWizard68,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:29:49 2015 UTC,This would probably go hand in hand with the idea of crops taking around 24 hours to grow and that crops could die cause of disease.
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,Freddo3000,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:09:41 2015 UTC,Could you imagine a possible war just over food? Yes pls Realistically though it would still be cool for the price of food to change according to the season.
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,IvetteAramis,2,Sat Jun 27 20:56:55 2015 UTC,"Jungles (and other warm biomes) wouldn't be unaffected, it would just be a reduced or different effect. Think rainy/sunny seasons etc."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,flameoguy,3,Sat Jun 27 13:20:14 2015 UTC,"The seasons are half a week, so a year is a 2 week cycle. Precipitation is boosted in Spring and Winter, but nerfed in Summer and Fall. Summer is warmer, winter is cooler, and the Spring and Fall periods have typical temperature. Snow now melts automatically in all biomes but Tundra, and melting is instant in the summer. Crops grow faster in Summer and halt in Winter, Jungle exempt."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,flameoguy,5,Sat Jun 27 13:37:13 2015 UTC,I think half a week is too short to even worry about seasons. 'Winter is coming?'  'Oh its only 3 days so dont even worry about it'.  Would be cool if you need to plan ahead to survive winter.
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,ThePimpShrimp,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:47:04 2015 UTC,"Well, you only have 6 days to prepare. Doubling everything doesn't really balance it."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,flameoguy,4,Sat Jun 27 13:49:34 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really talking about balance, because that's decided by how we configure the growth rates. I just feel 3 days per season is so short that noone will even worry about it."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,ThePimpShrimp,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:54:48 2015 UTC,"I guess that makes sense, but I feel like events go by so fast on this server a week would be a bit long."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,flameoguy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:37:46 2015 UTC,"Think about what can happen in three days on this server, though."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,kielbasabruh,3,Sun Jun 28 02:43:00 2015 UTC,I think it would be cool if every 2 weeks or something a long winter started. It would be about a 1 week spanned where nothing would grow.  Add flame to the pvp kit
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,tristanino,3,Sat Jun 27 14:48:59 2015 UTC,"IMO go the 2 season route. Less confusing, simpler, and makes more sense to me."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,rohishimoto,3,Sat Jun 27 15:11:37 2015 UTC,Found this plugin called Skyoseasons that could be used for this.
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,Freddo3000,3,Sat Jun 27 15:34:30 2015 UTC,"1.8.x is currently unstable   We have developed our own plugin for this, but nevertheless: Take a look at this, /u/mbach231."

CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,Freddo3000,2,Sat Jun 27 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"And if needed, I could try and make a config for this to work well between realistic biomes and skyoseasons that we could use on the test server."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,Freddo3000,2,Sat Jun 27 15:48:04 2015 UTC,I have already created a config for our own plugin.
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,conman577,2,Sat Jun 27 15:57:27 2015 UTC,Alright.
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,Wyrd-One,2,Sat Jun 27 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"Eh, two seasons, each being half a month. Spring/Summer months would be the same, Fall being at max a week so you know when to start spouting dank memes. Snow needs to be able to fall everywhere except for Jungles, and if possible melt in the warmer periods, because it would be silly to have snow in summer."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,Freddo3000,2,Sat Jun 27 16:49:58 2015 UTC,"Day length should shift, long nights and short days in winter, short nights and long days in summer.  I would go for the full 4 seasons rather than a sudden shift from summer to winter.  More rain in spring, more severe storms in summer, dry in fall, snow in winter would be nice, but that would require changing biomes.  Crop growth should be effected."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,SuperWizard68,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:36:39 2015 UTC,"For changing biomes, just use snow plains, doubt it will be used and set it so barely anything grows in that biome. It wont affect anything since nobody will probably use it, or you could use one of the ""edge"" biomes. Then switch back to normal when it is summer/spring/fall."
CivilizatonExperiment,3bau3z,zombehking,2,Sat Jun 27 19:38:20 2015 UTC,"I would actually prefer something like:  Spring: Maybe 3 days  Summer: One week  Fall: 3 days  Winter: One week  A bit of a faster cycle, and for what each season does, I vote for /u/ThePimpShrimp's comment, I like those rules."

Making a server cracked lets in two kinds of people: poor people and dicks (i.e., violators of any and all Server Rules, as listed in the sidebar). I don't have anything against poor people, but the possible benefits are outweighed by the risk.    Plus, I'm pretty sure the whitelist idea has been thrown around and rejected already."
CivilizatonExperiment,3b91lg,Nathanial_Jones,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:39:17 2015 UTC,What is a crack server exactly?
CivilizatonExperiment,3b91lg,Devonmartino,3,Sat Jun 27 01:28:18 2015 UTC,"A ""cracked"" server is a Minecraft server that allows pirated copies of the game to connect, rather than kicking them out as would normally happen if you tried to connect.  IIRC, you can create a Minecraft account and play offline as much as you want (I could be wrong, I'm recalling this from MC 1.0.0). However, these free accounts are offline-only. Thus, they can only connect to ""cracked"" servers, since those don't go through the Mojang authentication servers.  Or something like that."

This is what people will see when they enter your city. They'll be facing into the ravine, so any houses in the sides will be less visible. Name it Clifford. It sounds English, doesn't it?

CivilizatonExperiment,3b8yow,Devonmartino,2,Sat Jun 27 17:08:59 2015 UTC,"I made a diagram in Paint to demonstrate.  When people enter your city, they won't really be entering it from above. They'll be entering it by walking into the ravine, and will continue through your city by walking straight, through the length of the ravine (as shown). The houses (red) will be visible peripherally (I'm assuming they won't be jutting ten blocks out), whereas the bridges (green) will be directly overhead.  Again, that's just my two cents."

CivilizatonExperiment,3b8yow,BlobRoss,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:06:58 2015 UTC,"Hanging Temple:       The Hanging Temple, also Hanging Monastery or Xuankong Temple (simplified Chinese: 悬空寺; traditional Chinese: 懸空寺; pinyin: Xuánkōng Sì) is a temple built into a cliff (75 m or 246 ft above the ground) near Mount Heng in Hunyuan County, Datong City, Shanxi province, China. The closest city is Datong, 64.23 kilometers to the northwest. Along with the Yungang Grottoes, the Hanging Temple is one of the main tourist attractions and historical sites in the Datong area. Built more than 1,500 years ago, this temple is notable not only for its location on a sheer precipice but also because it is the only existing temple with the combination of three Chinese traditional religions: Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. The structure is kept in place with oak crossbeams fitted into holes chiseled into the cliffs. The main supportive structure is hidden inside the bedrock.  The monastery is located in the small canyon basin, and the body of the building hangs from the middle of the cliff under the prominent summit, protecting the temple from rain erosion and sunlight. Coupled with the repair of the dynasties, the color tattoo in the temple is relatively well preserved. On December 2010, it was listed in the “Time” magazine as the world's top ten most odd dangerous buildings.
