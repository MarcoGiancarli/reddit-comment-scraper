His doctor encouraged him to embrace it as a creative constraint, and that advice became a huge source of inspiration in his art. It may not be quite what you're looking for, but it's a wonderful artist talk that may inspire some creative ideas."

ted,3ccnyz,chevelle216,16,Mon Jul 6 21:47:11 2015 UTC,It's nice to see someone on the other end of the wealth gap arguing for equality.
ted,3ccnyz,KingMooseMan,6,Mon Jul 6 21:49:48 2015 UTC,"There was a John Green (bleh, I know) tweet some time ago which said ""What the rich should want is to lessen inequality to prevent a Marxist uprising"". I think he's spot on."

ted,3ccnyz,KingMooseMan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:19:11 2015 UTC,"I don't. I used to be a big fan, but I just got tired of it. Maybe I grew out of it, idk, but I could not care less about nerdfighters or his books anymore."
ted,3ccnyz,Micp,2,Tue Jul 7 16:59:48 2015 UTC,"I never liked that argument. It's essentially saying ""you should give us your money or some of us might kill you"".  To me it seems like thinly veiled extortion. There are good arguments for equality but that isn't one of them imo."
ted,3ccnyz,KingMooseMan,2,Tue Jul 7 15:20:29 2015 UTC,Such is the nature of revolution I suppose.
ted,3ccnyz,Micp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:29:03 2015 UTC,Yes. Which is why I'm against revolution. I live in one of the most equal countries in the world and yet we have a party that believes in the revolution (though when the press inquires about it they say they believe it will be a peaceful revolution - it seems clear that not all of them actually believe that). In the capital they got about 20% of the vote. Now that scares me.
ted,3ccnyz,KingMooseMan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:37:10 2015 UTC,"If they're getting votes, it'll be more peaceful than most revolutions in history. Whereabouts are you living if you don't mind my asking? I'm assuming somewhere in Europe."
ted,3ccnyz,Micp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:45:11 2015 UTC,Denmark.
ted,3ccnyz,KingMooseMan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:47:26 2015 UTC,"I see. Which party would that be? I'm having some trouble finding it after an admittedly cursory search. Besides, I'm always interested in learning more about my comrades from all over the world."
ted,3ccnyz,Micp,2,Tue Jul 7 17:03:06 2015 UTC,"the red-green party. it's created from the remnants of a bunch of older leftist parties such as the left-socialists, the communists, and some others (before the red-green party - which in danish is called the unity list - there was a bunch of far left parties squabbling over their individual interpretation of what far leftism should be, but because they were so splintered they got in each others way. the unity list was created in order to unite them, set the differences aside and gain some actual political power.  This was some time ago, but in the older members you can still see some fractures and disagreements concerning some issues, such as how a revolution should actually take form and how society afterwards should actually take form (one quote from them for example was that you would of course still get to keep some things after the revolution - such as a toothbrush. the rest of them quickly went out to say this wasn't the official view of the party, but at the same time remained vague on what you actually would get to keep)."
ted,3ccnyz,KingMooseMan,2,Tue Jul 7 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"Oh lord. Political squabbling like that is so ridiculous. Of course you'd be allowed to keep your toothbrush! The only property Communists are interested in confiscating is private property (not to be confused with personal property) that is used to generate profit and therefore oppress the proletariat. So, yeah, any Marxist worth his salt will tell you that you are perfectly entitled to your toothbrush."

ted,3ccnyz,sdguero,2,Tue Jul 7 12:01:51 2015 UTC,"What sets me apart, I think, is a tolerance for risk and an intuition about what will happen in the future.   It cracks me up when someone who basically hit the lottery chalks it up to being special, or having some special skill that nobody else has, and then they think they can runa round and preach to the rest of us.   He just just can't admit to himself that it was pure luck that he happened to be the first investor (which means he had some money to begin with) in Amazon.com   To me, this guy is an ideal target for a con.  Edit: The only thing I'll add, as far as his argument, is that 49% of the populous of France prior to the revolution were not on some kinda of government subsidy or payroll from the government like the United States today. They also were not nearly as scared of violence, or enjoy the long life spans that we have today. I don't think we are anywhere near to a rebellion."
ted,3ccnyz,KingMooseMan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:49:16 2015 UTC,"If things keep going the way they're going, I wouldn't be surprised to get a revolution in 40 to 50 years. Two more generations; if wealth disparity keeps growing, it could happen. It's far more likely that the inequality will be corrected through government means before that time, however.  It's kind of a shame, really. That the revolution would be so far in the future I mean. I've always been in the ""If there must be trouble, let it be in my day"" camp when it comes to stuff like this."

ted,3ccnyz,Salemosophy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:01:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with Hanauer's argument for including everyone in Capitalism, but my concern is that either 1) we'll automate more of our production eliminating opportunities for earning wages or 2) we will forego automation to make opportunities available for earning wages and further stagnate innovation. The problem isn't just inequality. We are entering a new state of social conditions and need to adapt to it! Capitalism very well might facilitate the transition, but I don't believe it will prove to be as reliable as Mr. Hanauer appears to believe."
ted,3ccnyz,AvgRedditJ03,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:03:58 2015 UTC,"I think he hits your points right on the head. When people have more money, they will be more educated, and capable of doing more advanced jobs. Automation, will take over jobs in any case, it is simply cheaper and better."

ted,3as377,emilyatted,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:34:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I was searching last night, I was trying to figure out if one was a dysphemism or was more commonly used by Global Warming Deniers.

I don't know, what the hell was his point?  It honestly did start out strong, but seemed like he didn't really know where he was going with the talk.

ted,34gpcp,L3ft,6,Fri May 1 00:21:55 2015 UTC,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S0FDjFBj8o&feature=youtube_gdata_player  I think this talk is great for a number of reasons.  He shows how to effectivly engage an audience with litterally any content.  He shows some facinating aspects of how people pay attention to things.  It reminds me a bit of the misdirection a magician does, yet he is pointing directly at the fraud not away feom it, creating an interesting irony.  Fun a light hearted at the very least."
ted,34gpcp,Heliocentaur,2,Fri May 1 08:31:54 2015 UTC,I hear it's amazing when the famous purple stuffed worm in flap-jaw space with a tuning fork does a raw blink on Hara-Kiri Rock. I need scissors! 61!
ted,34gpcp,jjness,2,Fri May 1 13:30:42 2015 UTC,Alternatively...
ted,33wb9i,ilovemonkeys1000,2,Sun Apr 26 06:21:43 2015 UTC,"Quite badly filmed and annoying audio quality.    ""Here's a photo and I would like to ask if you think he's successful"" — aaand viewer is never shown the photo… etc.  Here's the photo he talks about btw"
ted,33wb9i,matude,1 point,Sun Apr 26 08:58:20 2015 UTC,"TL,DR please"
ted,33wb9i,log_ladys_log,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:23:01 2015 UTC,6m in and still nothing... I was not successful at viewing this video.

ted,33qc5a,aeekay,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:13:50 2015 UTC,I hope we can realize this someday.
ted,33on13,CrocodileWoman,3,Fri Apr 24 06:03:12 2015 UTC,Don't stop sharing :)
ted,33on13,Jehstix,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:01:17 2015 UTC,I won't :D
ted,33on13,ersankocabyk,3,Sat Apr 25 07:32:35 2015 UTC,Making business at that ages is very valuable thing. It can be seen like a little step but it is a big step for little foots. This world needs more entrepreneurs like you. Just keep going and share your video with proud.
ted,33ler5,kingbobofyourhouse,5,Thu Apr 23 13:57:07 2015 UTC,might be nice if you also linked to the talk:  https://www.ted.com/talks/monica_lewinsky_the_price_of_shame
ted,33b0j1,Jonstewart4851,6,Tue Apr 21 01:36:59 2015 UTC,"The power of introverts.  Not so much about coming out of your shell, but you might like it."
ted,33b0j1,gyromagnetic,8,Tue Apr 21 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"Not a TED talk, but the book How to Win Friends and Influence People is a standard for a good reason."
ted,33b0j1,JamGrooveSoul,4,Tue Apr 21 08:18:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think this book helps you be more social and outgoing. More aimed at being a better business person. It wouldn't hurt, as it does naturally give some insight into how people think, but there must be better things."
ted,33b0j1,grounderror,5,Tue Apr 21 12:54:38 2015 UTC,I'll have to disagree with you there. It makes you more social and outgoing by telling you to stop thinking about yourself and start thinking about others. Even the simple suggestion to smile at others will put most people leaps and bounds ahead of where they are socially today.

ted,33b0j1,Biermoese,3,Tue Apr 21 10:52:51 2015 UTC,This is the one I thought of. Amazing talk that I remember before every interview.
ted,33b0j1,betweentwosuns,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:06:45 2015 UTC,Fake it until you become it :) touching story near the end and incredibly relateable to this topic

ted,33b0j1,akeryw,1 point,Tue Apr 21 09:44:54 2015 UTC,"Not exactly what you're looking for, and you may have already seen it, but this one is great for learning about how posture influences interactions."
ted,33b0j1,daysaway,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:17:57 2015 UTC,There's one about body language influencing your self-confidence and outgoingness. I can't recall the name though
ted,33b0j1,skepticscorner,1 point,Tue Apr 21 09:29:02 2015 UTC,"You won't become more outgoing by watching an instruction video or reading a self help book. You become more outgoing by going out and grabbing every opportunity to socialize. At first it might be awkward, but social skills are like any other skill - the more you do it, the better you become, so close your computer and go outside. Find a hobby / part time job where you'd have to constantly deal with people."
ted,338vyf,canyouspareadime,3,Mon Apr 20 16:09:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know what this says about me but...  When he was outlining the details of suffering women around the world, my sympathy level was around a 6 or a 7 - but when he played the 911 recording of the Oregon woman it elevated to a 9 (I reserve 10 for those personally close to me)."
ted,338vyf,AdolphManson,6,Mon Apr 20 20:55:52 2015 UTC,"...That you're human?  A line from Interstellar comes to mind: “We can care deeply, selflessly, about the ones we know but that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight”."
ted,338vyf,hisrealface,2,Mon Apr 20 21:58:53 2015 UTC,"I bawled like a baby while watching this. The speaker's genuine emotion choked me up a bit more but this talk made me realize how easily it can be put out of sight and out of mind. I'm inspired to want to do something to help but as one person who's city has its own corrupt issues that allow violence and injustices against its people, where do you even begin? Writing a check that will only put a bandaid on the wound rather than correct the problem seems so uninvolved and pointless. Sending them money this week for food and water doesn't help them next week. What can be done?"
ted,338vyf,ScienceNerdGirl,2,Mon Apr 20 22:12:37 2015 UTC,"There are lots of ways to begin. Check out ijm.org, or google other speeches that Gary has made. It all starts with awareness."
