Top performers deserve to be rewarded.  And one can make a decent case for the current format too – except for forcing people into the bottom 10% just to make the curve.  Especially if the company wants to continue to grow so much – why basically try to push out 10% of your people even if they are doing a good job?

Or a good resource gets a mediocre rating on a three month assignment because of a personality conflict with her manager, sinking her rating for that year.  Yes, sometimes the popular employee is the most deserving of promotion, no question.  But it's just as often that  that is not the case.  This is BAD news for the folks who have built (or started to build) careers upon their ability to play the game, and game the system. These are the people who have the right executives on laddering calls to tell their ""story"" for them, even when their performance is mediocre at best.  (If you come across someone at Accenture and you wonder why they are in a manager role when they are operating at analyst level tops, check their org tree in Outlook for who their career counselor is.

After that, we'll try to sort out what exactly it is that you're doing here, since the partner who's selling this project will skedaddle as soon as one of you morons signs on the dotted line. We also have no idea what we're doing, since we put a single old, bitter fuck who used to be a COBOL72 programmer on this project with a bunch of kids who have just graduated. Probably somewhere in month 3 (so, about $750k into the project) we'll figure out what we're doing, and at that point we can begin the actual work.

Also, the bonus carrot is pure shit. You will unlike get the max ""potential performance bonus"" in your first year, it's based on rating system, and there's some convoluted non-standard fuckup between practices and groups in the same company - some will stack all senior associates equally into one pool (meaning you're competing against others who have 3+ yrs of relationships and are on the cusp of manager), some break it down into arbitrary categories.

Yes, for two reasons:  1)  They are often more experienced.  An internal promote from Consultant to Senior Consultant will typically have only an undergraduate degree with 2-4 years of experience while an MBA hire will have a graduate degree with 5+ years of experience.  2)  MBA's have to be bought.  Especially at good schools, competition for top graduates is very intense between IBanking and Consulting.  Both have to offer higher than average salaries to attract those top candidates.  That said, raises are pretty sparse for MBA hires as compared to internal promotes IME; the goal is to normalize salaries by the time you reach the next level."

consulting,3e22ze,347ninja,8,Tue Jul 21 10:42:19 2015 UTC,"Funny you ask this as i was in the same boat 3 years back. I knew few people who did it and their experiences and stories made Tech Consulting very lucrative. Well luckily i did get recruited from campus to Big 4 tech consulting. Here is what its like ..  The Good: The experience is unparalleled. Getting to dive straight into Fortune 500 client projects, seeing how each of these giants operate so differently without actually having to change jobs. Its like drinking from a firehose, no one wants to pay ridiculous consulting fees unless something is difficult or messed up. This pretty much means you will always be doing someone's dirty laundry and over a period of time get really good at it. You will develop really good people skills dealing so many varieties of clients, this skill is by no means easy to learn but consulting will give you that opportunity. Oh yeah the pay is good with upto 15 percent raises every year based on your performance and as long as you do good you kind of have a set career path.   The Bad: Travel, its pretty amazing when you are single, out of college. Live in fancy hotels every week, go to new cities, try out good restaurants with your expense budget. Hoard up on miles and take free vacations with hotel points. This got old for me soon, its hard to maintain your health. Once you are married, you no longer want to be on the road 4 days of the week. When you are travelling,  project assumes you have no family to get back to, just your hotel, so why not just make you work long hours. When you dont travel, they assume oh you will atleast get back to your family at end of the day, so take that as a bonus and keep working while you see them. Performance reviews in organizations of this size are sometimes pretty vauge and make no sense. You are compared to peer based on numbers, utilization, etc. There is a lot of politics involved too.   The ugly: Yeah great salary and hotel+flight perks. They dont add up though, at best your points earned in the year might be worth an addtional $5000-8000 of travel benefits. Personally i would rather live a stable life. The good-  salary, eventually over your career the industry will be able to match it with a much better work life balance. As a parent when i am mid 30s, i for sure will not want to be away  from home for long stretches and dump every responsibility on your partner. Long hours and no time to spend with family is not appealing either. But of all things, for me the ugliest part has been the fact that i have done so many project in different industries with a different role / technology each time that by now i feel just as confused as before. I have little knowledge of all things depth of none. This however could be different for different people. Today, i feel like i want to make a move but when i go to  a job portal, i dont know what to look for, a tester, a project manager,  strategy, functional role, coder, etc. Ive done all those role and now i cant market myself in one domain as a strong person. Ive become a quick learner and highly adapatable and that is definately a good skill i will tell you that."

I feel i should have rather built a strong profile in an industry for 3 years and then moved to consulting. I feel it would have given me a much better grip on my career.   Again dont get me wrong, if you are a computer engineering guy you will be able to bag more technical skills based projects and build expertise.

Rather than managing all aspects of the sales cycle, this app would target people who are specifically looking to reach out to potential leads and establish a relationship with them quickly and easy, without sacrificing making a personal connection. The focus would be on extremely quick, easy setup, so that from the moment they sign up, they are sending out emails as quickly as possible.

Then roll through whatever is on the page and improve it, adding segments as necessary.

Peer review is great for this too, even if they barely know whats going on they can catch brain farts and weird syntax.

You get some that are super nice (Westin Atlanta Perimeter comes to mind) and some that are super terrible (W Silicon Valley).    In the case of super terrible, I check around.  Sometimes if you're at a client campus, you can use their gym for free / discount (places like Google, Comcast, Best Buy all have in-house gyms for instance).  Otherwise I just see if there's anything good around the hotel or client site.  A while back, I was on a project with a bunch of ex-military guys and we did Cross Fit together two days a week instead of dinner out (subject to work flow).  Obviously this was an exception, not a norm.  While there's no official rule at my firm, its a generally accepted reimburseable expense.  I guess somewhere in the firm there's a Manager or two who'd decline you, but I personally let it go, and all my peers would too.  Small price to pay for the sanity of a team."

I wish the company would just make it standard when traveling but our company isn't huge on physical culture so I doubt it would ever have the support.   For food: eat salads and some meat. Stay away From the various grains and sweets. Try at minimum to do like 10 minutes or something per day. There are many apps that will auto generate  a nice HITT workout.

consulting,3dnhhp,VonCuddles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:46:23 2015 UTC,"So I read through this and hopefully will provide some unique insight. I do amateur bodybuilding/physique, workout 4-6 times a week, etc.    Since you emphasized that you're interested in heavier lifts, I'll gear my comments towards that arena.     You either do get a car, or you don't. If you don't, maybe you can Lyft/Taxi, or your hotel has an agreement with a local gym.   Always ask the hotel if they have a gym referral agreement. Lots of hotels send all their guests to a local gym for a reduced cost or free. If not, then they'll just tell you to use their hotel gym, which is almost always underwhelming at best.     You may go to the same types of cities (aka not the middle of nowhere) regularly. If so, try to see if your company has an incentive/reduced price to join a very large national brand (typically Gold's or LA Fitness). The price to go to a gym for a day (over time) will be more than traveling (up to an hour even) in your Avis vehicle and expensing the gas, to go to a gym where you have a membership.   2a. Check out the local spots. You can meet a lot of interesting people, and work out in some really cool looking gyms. Often they're pretty cheap for the day or week.    2b. Always travel with two resistance bands. One with lighter resistance, one with heavier. You can use them in your workouts and to stretch, but when you're absolutely desperate, you can workout with them. Plenty of resistance-band exercises that will hit all your muscle groups. The worst I've ever done, was to run into woods and use branches as anchors for resistance bands, and do pullups on branches. You look crazy, but who cares in the name of gains?     Use your food per diem on protein and put it in your checked luggage on your way back home!! Ran out of space? Buy as many quest bars as you can expense! By the time my travel ended, I had so much protein at home that it lasted for almost a year after I stopped travel-work. (I still travel, but local/regional travel with no hotels).   Lastly, finding gyms isn't hard. You'll figure this stuff out really soon and have your system down in no time. What is hard, will be eating correctly. Eating healthy while traveling is extremely difficult. Stay at the Homewood suites so you have access to a kitchen. Eat your protein bars when you're craving a snack. Find out what dishes at restaurants you can get steamed and without sauces. Usually go for the salmon and veggies, it's super common and tell them to hold all sauces. In some states, people will look at you like you're insane. I worked in Shreveport, LA for 5 weeks, and once ordered a crab salad. The crab was battered and deepfried and put on a fucking bed of bacon and lettuce in ranch dressing. So, finally, never assume that it's healthy without telling them how to make it.      Good luck!    edit: formatting fail."

A protein like smoked salmon and whitefish salad is still a spread, provided its not layered with anything else.  In terms of spreads, there's the basic butter or cream cheese. More advanced proteins include whitefish salad, smoked salmon, bacon, and prosciutto. Vegetable wise, the only real option is a slice of tomato.

If you want a job that makes you feel like you are saving the world, then you need to go find a job that actually benefits society. Corporate finance is important for businesses, but its not that exciting. Its just something someone needs to do - and do well - for the benefit of a company. And you are 19 and an intern, its not like you are doing anything of note. You are just there to help as you can and see what its like to work in corporate america.  What were you expecting? one day you'll be happy the job isn't challenging and yet pays all the bills and you can spend time with your family and on your hobbies. when I first started consulting I was frustrated at the lack of urgency or enthusiasm the clients showed - then I realized that they have entire amazing lives outside of work. Now I'm appreciative of any effort by any of my clients.  I've been in management consulting for 15+ years. I've had moments of glory (e.g. strategy projects that actually led to something happening) and many moments of drudgery.   Existential satisfaction from this line of work is mostly from using your frequent flier points and somehow getting upgraded to international business class and then staying somewhere lovely with someone you love and actually getting upgraded to a suite based on your travel status. Unless you are willing to make not much money, seeking existential satisfaction from any job is going to be difficult.   Sounds like your internship is a good one - showing you something of life. Maybe med school is the right path. I am in my 40's and know a fair number of doctors (from general practice to an actual nurosurgeon) and they are financially sound and seem to enjoy the part of their jobs they help people, but they endlessly complain about insurance, bureaucracy, hospital politics, etc.   Make the most of your internship."

You need to focus on your perspective and only worrying about the things you can control.  Perspective More often than not things are what you make of them. Here it seems like you have had a tough time. Good. You got that out of the way early and now you can reflect on what you really want (or don't) with some experience to draw on. You're lucky to have this experience early.  Things you can control  In corporate life, some people are doers and some are thinkers. Doers have repetitive jobs where they clock in, clock out and do the same thing every day. On the other hand, thinkers I know in corp fin have found roles they like, continue to move up, have lead financing of mergers, IPOs, bond issuance, currency trading, etc. yet get flexible schedules and relatively good hours. Which one you are in the future is in your control at age 19. What do you want? What do you have to do now to get it later?

consulting,3diyq3,klemmon05,2,Thu Jul 16 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"I always wanted to do something useful as a job - doing something that helps people. I didn't want to help people on an individual level like a doctor or a social worker does, instead I wanted to work on technologies that allow me to do something useful for many people at once. When you think about it - the biggest changes and improvements during the past century came through science and technology (the aeroplane, washing machines, cars, bicycles, the internet, wikipedia) - I wanted to do something like that. That's how I chose I wanted to study computer science.  Computer science turned out to be very hard and also I had the feeling that the industry was getting more and more ""commoditized"" (am I using the correct term here?) - meaning that people with ideas hire programmers to implement their ideas, but the programmers get less and less power to influence that process. So I switched over to business computer science thinking I could become to one to decide what to implement.   Later in my studies I started thinking about career. Since there was no company doing anything really groundbreaking located anywhere close to where I lived I decided to aim for consulting. After all, as a consultant you get to help many companies which help many people, right? The recruiting posters of consulting companies always talk about the smart grids they operate, how they help companies grow and how they help develop new products and ideas. That sounded great to me.  Then I joined a technology consulting company. I started with a few banking projects. My role was interesting but I was disappointed as our projects were not really helping anyone but just allowed banks to fulfill regulatory requirements. None of the posters said that half of the projects are about implementing software against strict requirements without any creativity or tangible benefit to people.  I later switched industries to consumer goods. I feel better about myself now. I am not inventing the next-generation electric self-driving car but I can support projects that allow my clients to get a tiny bit better and provide a bit better service to consumers.   tl;dr: In big corporations and consulting if you are at the right place at the right time you can get satisfaction out of improving things for very many people a tiny little bit."

Regardless of how hard I pushed back, the client would not let us off the hook.  The final straw was when the client team orders lunch and sat there eating as if we weren't going to go find food. As soon as they took their first bite, I said, ""well, we'll be back after lunch. please put together a list of what you'd like done and John Smith and I will work on those after lunch.""  I immediately called my EM and was like, this is absolute torture. This isn't a sweat shop. EM spoke with the client sponsor and client sponsor that was in the room with us, making us do this, denied it all. ""Oh, I was only in there about 20 minutes.""  When we got back, the client said ""we aren't the client from hell. we just want to know what you're doing."" I assertively said, ""This isn't productive for anyone. We are wasting time justifying every mouse click we make when the only thing that matters is that we're doing it as close to best practices as possible and that we're meeting the requirements.""

Notts is a plenty good university to get into any of the firms you mention. An audit internship wont be particularly impressive on its own though. Many of the people you will be competing against will have done some impressive stuff like founding their own business or have had varied and challenging internships and placements pretty much throughout university.

Cockroaches provide a great service in ridding environments of organic litter and killing a bedbug colony, but cockroaches can cause much contamination themselves. They may be potential carriers of germs that cause disease in human, such as dysentery and gastro-enteritis. They are also known carriers of salmonella and other diseases that may cause stomach problems.

While few large consulting firms focus solely on marketing, Copernicus Marketing Consulting and Simon-Kucher & Partners are two examples of companies whose revenues are earned in large part from marketing consulting. Large management consulting firms such as McKinsey, A.T. Kearney, Bain & Company, and the Boston Consulting Group* also have marketing consulting practices. Government agencies, corporations, and nonprofit organizations employ consultants. Approximately 23 percent of management consultants are self-employed.  Although competition for consulting jobs is fierce, there are a variety of ways to launch a career in the field. Joining marketing and consulting associations is a good way to network and to learn about job openings. Contact consulting firms directly to learn if they are hiring You can also network with hiring managers and recruiters at social-media sites such as LinkedIn or at networking events held by associations. Many large consulting firms recruit on campus, and your college’s career services office can provide you with information on recruiting events, advice on crafting a strong cover letter and resume, and tips on prepping for interviews.  New hires (known as associates, consultants, business analysts, fellows, and various other titles, depending on the consulting firm) at large management consulting firms begin as generalists before obtaining experience in marketing consulting.

Here's how one might break it down:  Customer Base Model   Customer growth from market growth Customer growth from share growth Customer decline from churn   Revenue Model   Recurring revenue streams One-time revenue streams Synergy impact   Cost Model   Recurring cost streams One-time cost streams Cannibalization impact   Investment Model   Profit calculation Net present value analysis   Scenario Model   Solver model to maximize NPV given different combinations of assumptions and constraints   Then run it all in parallel assuming multiple devices, multiple services, and multiple geographies.  And also make it flexible enough so that you can change any of the assumptions that feed into it.  This is just one example.  Models end up being complicated and you never really know what you're going to walk into.  One client might want something like the above, the next might want a price elasticity analysis for vegetables, and the next might want to know the optimal number of sales associates in stores.  It ends up being complicated and custom stuff, and so this means you want absolute grasp of the building blocks (formulas) and the mortar (structure).

I am trying to leverage the knowledge that I've learned, the prestige of the degree and my current job right now to transition into consulting.  If you can get a job that you want without the MiM, do that. Otherwise, make sure you really utilize the career services department at Imperial, so you can set yourself up for job placement.   Most companies start recruiting in late summer, which is before your program even begins! This does not give you much time to prepare, nor does it give you time to leverage the knowledge that you may acquire from classes. And, given that this is a one year program, this is your only shot to apply to jobs as a student.  Given the tight time constraints and recruiting deadlines, you do not have a chance to explore different options, build business skills or really have much time to develop your resume for summer recruiting.

consulting,3cykoq,carnitasburritoking,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:28:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response.  It seems that the 'pure' data science field is highly esoteric and a little detached from the 'business analyst' side of things. My initial enquiry was actually with reference to the 'pure' side of things, but it appears that getting the right qualifications for this type of work would require at least a Master's.  I'm working on the 'business analyst' skillset at the moment (VBA/Excel focus, with some SQL), but there is also scope to move into a more 'digital' role at my firm, given the right circumstances.  Do you happen to know if 'digital' practices at the big firms are just glorified system integration shops, or if they are actually concerned with more 'data sciencey' work?"

The skills aren't rare but having someone trust you enough to let you take on a data scientist role without prior experience is difficult. Even large programs will have at most 1 or 2 and the role is very visible, as the statistical model you produce might be the driver (or indeed the whole business case) for why the program is being done.   Skills wise: R and SAS first and foremost. Base SAS is pretty much an industry standard now. SQL obviously as data manipulation in SAS is tedious. Lastly, pick a data visualisation tool of your choice.   The top data scientists however are good specifically because they understand their client's business and market and can generate good hypothesis to model against. A strong intuition is not something you can learn however."

consulting,3cuw2w,Crash_Coredump,2,Sat Jul 11 00:18:21 2015 UTC,"At my firm, PTO is not included in the ""bank"" of hours that is used to determine chargeability.  Oftentimes, people who are concerned about their chargeability will burn through PTO when they go onto the bench, rather than charge their time to an unbillable cost center.  They do this because their chargeability ratio coming out of PTO will be the same as it was going into it.  I think the most likely explanation is that your manager wants to keep you off the open demand list."

You on PTO removes him of all responsibility.   Everyone wants to point fingers at everyone else for not pulling money into the firm.   Taking PTO right now doesn't benefit you at all.   They cant force you into PTO. What he's doing is shady at best but can be taken as ""well I was just suggesting / giving permission"".   Just show up next week and see what happens. Don't take your precious vacation days when you have nothing awesome planned.   Also be careful with your abbreviations.

When you are on the bench you are in the office networking, working on internal projects and initiatives or helping on pursuit or you are out in your external network doing BD.   EDIT: Sorry, misinterpreted your post. The SM pushing for partner will spend extra time with the client and ""repurposed"" their time ""just to add value"" for the client. This means extra work for free. He will delegate it all to OP while on leave. That way the expenses to the firm and client are minimized and when the SM pulls new work in the future he has that resource available again.

You don't have an understanding of how your new firm really works yet, so at first you will be less efficient and more difficult to work with than other consultants.  You also have very little power over staffing. No choice except be nice to them and gracefully accept what's offered. Trying to exercise control over staffing as a new hire is futile and will just upset everyone.  A better way is to get partners to request you for their teams. Do this by doing good work when assigned to them, and letting the partners know what experience you bring (which they can sell to clients) and what kind of cases you want to do. If you make a good impression they will control staffing for you.  This all takes time; at first you probably have to accept you have no control over staffing, at least for a few months."

consulting,3ct3ul,overcannon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:22:12 2015 UTC,"MSc is a specialisation in knowledge. Whereas an MBA is a general degree built to move you away from technical and into management. MSc is generally not comparable to an MBA, just because of the nature of the work you are signalling to the market you are looking to do.   In practice, especially in Tech, you can definitely make it into upper ranks with either degree. MBA is much more suited for this, but a good worker with a different masters does well.   Edit: MSc is usually gotten directly out of undergrad - you won't be taken as an experienced hire or at an MBA level, you'll be with undergrads ~most, if not all, of the time."
consulting,3ct3ul,ddlbb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:09:40 2015 UTC,"I was recruited into consulting from my M.Sc. program and I came in at the experienced Consultant level, which is between entry-level and the level MBAs come in at. Most of my classmates were in the same boat... the few who received offers at the Senior Consultant level had at least 4 years of experience, so about what a candidate from a strong MBA program would have before going back to school, although some with that much experience weren't hired as Seniors because their previous experience wasn't relevant to the degree they'd just earned. I know some M.Sc. grads from other programs who went straight from undergrad to grad school and were hired at the entry-level (Analyst) level because they lacked job experience and their M.Sc. wasn't respected enough to overcome that. Overall it probably depends on the subject of your M.Sc. -- is it a high demand field and do you come from a highly respected program -- but the vast majority will come in one level below where MBAs come in.  All of that said, do some research before getting an M.Sc. There are a lot of new programs popping up in the last few years to capitalize on the number of people returning to school to improve their resume because of the poor economy. Many of these degrees aren't respected professionally and you'd be better off working during that time instead of racking up grad school debt. Few exceptions would be those that have major consulting firms on-campus recruiting their grads. If you can't find this info out from the school or its website, use LinkedIn to see what grads from that program are now doing to get a sense for how much consulting and other industries respect that degree."

consulting,3ct3ul,sdgwrh2d,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:00:12 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, it's usually fresh or middle senior since MBAs enter at the ""soon to be manager"" level and an MSc is seen as one level below an MBA.  With 3.5 years work experience you'd probably have enough to at least get a consulting firm to listen to your case for a Senior level position, but I think it will still be a tough sell unless you have professional managerial/project management experience."

If you're talking from a developmental perspective, then the only person who can answer is you - is each project helping you move closer to your own personal goals?  And don't worry about other people doing crazy stuff like consulting for the Pope or what not.  Those are unicorn clients that happen but once in a while.  Work-wise its no different.  What I have found is that most firms in a consulting niche go through the same day-to-day - just for different tiers of competitors.

I support the decision to bring the hammer down on subs that bring harassment to others in their everyday lives.  It's okay to call someone fat on the internet, but it's not okay to call someone fat and start emailing their employers asking why they hired that fat person.  (That was a hypothetical, by the way.)  It Pao was responsible for the decision to shut down those subs, then assuming the ban remains in place, it can only help Reddit become a better place.  In truth, I think they should go further than they have, and take down all of these openly racist subs.  They are an outrage and there is no excuse for it. Free speech does not apply to a privately held and controlled corporation.  I think mods are entitled to better, and more bilateral, communications with the administrators of the site.  To the extent that Pao has encouraged or tolerated the ""my way or the highway"" attitude that some of these admins (including the founders) seem to exhibit, then that's a strike against her and her credibility.  Regarding the firing of the AMA admin and the subsequent revolt by the flagship subs... well, that pissed me off.  I thought it was a childish response to an internal issue that the mods had no rightful say in.  This was supposedly done in the name, and best interests, of Reddit users, but users were the only ones who paid a negative price for it.  The truth is, the AMA admin had nothing to do with the protest, she was simply a useful means for the cliquish community of mods at Reddit to force Pao's ouster.  And yes, I think the main reason the mods and the user base don't like Pao was her sex discrimination lawsuit.  In the end, while I don't think Pao was the best person for the job, the bad behavior of others' involved in these dramas left me sort of rooting for her in a passive, ambivalent way.  Say what you will about her, but the woman has certainly led an interesting, and unexpected life:  http://fortune.com/2012/10/25/ellen-pao-buddy-fletcher/"

Unfortunately (for her), a social media ""news"" site with a community isn't the same as a strictly hierarchical company structure.  There are areas where employees (part of the corporate hierarchy) interface with the community (not part of the hierarchy).  The fact that she was a horrible person (and married to another horrible person) with issues that were easy to document and with opponents who have lots and lots of money means that this outcome was inevitable.  Personally, I think the community should now concentrate on getting Virgina re-hired.  This entire episode is a metaphor for something much deeper and significantly more dysfunctional in the American work place.  You should count on seeing this happen more often.  Think of it as ""Labor Union v2.0"" except that it works from the top down instead of the bottom up.  My sincerest hope is that the take-away will be that communities need to be separate from corporate hierarchies via a decentralized, non-controllable mechanisms that will allow the masses to act democratically and remove their support when it becomes necessary (as defined by the community majority)."

consulting,3cpww2,non-consult_consult,2,Thu Jul 9 20:46:51 2015 UTC,"I am not a consultant but I work at a top tier firm on the ""corporate"" side of things. Generally the consultants are doing much of what it appears you do now (project management, etc.) but farm out the data cleaning, modeling, analysis, to one of the knowledge centers. The pay will most certainly not be as good as a consultant. But you can also have a life and that's the trade off. I don't work at one of these centers so this is largely based on my general knowledge of how our firm works and the interactions I have had with some of the analysts."

consulting,3coxg7,BaingBro,35,Thu Jul 9 16:29:10 2015 UTC,"Not in corporate strategy / M&A, but I made the jump from a tier 2 Financial Services consultancy to a risk/compliance role at a big bank.  Also, some of these observations may be specific to my company.  Here are some of my observations:   Consulting has mostly the same kind of folks: newly grads full of promise and ambition, seasoned veterans who always prioritize client commitment... sharply dressed and jet setting business people.  Industry seems to have more family-oriented folks.  Typical 9-5ers with 2 kids who  duck out of work early twice a week to take them to doctor appointments or swim meets.  Doesn't mean they don't work hard, but their priorities are different. Consulting (for me) was not ""true consulting""; it was executing on a well-defined scope and working long and/or stressful hours to get it done.  I never truly felt ""strategic"" until I got into industry, where I would work with my business stakeholders to genuinely try to improve processes and be empowered to do so. At the same time, although decisions seem to have more impact, they take longer to implement.  For instance, in a system integration project in consulting, folks try to be low touch, minimally invasive, and hit the decisions hard and fast.  In industry, folks don't seem to mind taking their time mulling over decisions, socializing it with everyone and their moms, and pushing back deadlines so long as there is no regulatory requirement for a faster delivery. Got a small pay bump, but will likely see 1-3% raises until I get promoted.  Won't see those ridiculous 15% raises no more.  Also, promotions aren't automatic and they aren't required (move up or out).  You can certainly stay at a role if you want, although my company tends to encouraging moving around every few years to keep you on your toes. Feels different having my own cubicle.  Miss the travel perks, but don't miss being cramped in a client conference room all the day long, smelling the stink of my senior manager.  Its nice to have my own mug, family photos, and a dual monitor set up at my desk. Budget is tigher and expenses are scrutinized more. Monotony exists here aplenty, but only if you let it.  Consulting forces you to branch out, put out fires, and adapt.  You can do that too in industry, but you have to pave your own way since your manager won't necessarily do it for you.  Its like being in the military.  They force you to work out and train with your cohorts.  Everyday you bitch and moan about the job.  Once you're out, you're at liberty to continue working out or get fat... it's up to you.  Maybe you'll suffer PTSD and constantly feel like you're not doing enough, or that a major fire can come at any second.  However, there are tons of ad-hoc weirdo initiatives going around here.  Alls you gotta do is ask to get plugged in.   Good luck with your journey.  I definitely miss consulting sometimes.  Feel free to ask my more questions.  EDIT: In consulting, a senior manager told me, ""You gotta dress for the job you WANT, not the job you HAVE"".  Week 1 in industry, my manager told me, ""Don't feel compelled to wear a suit jacket... folks will think you're having an interview or something.  If you're doing it for the fashion, then do you... but around here people wear khakis and chinos"".  Definitely a bit of a culture shock."

consulting,3coxg7,AzIdCoWa,3,Thu Jul 9 18:22:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the in-depth response, u/jabokeysticks. Fortunately, I've been lucky enough to be staffed exclusively on less rote strategy cases, which is part of the reason why making a transition has been a tough decision. Your point on upward mobility in the corporate world is also important, since the year-over-year salary increase in consulting is hard to match in other industries. If you don't mind me asking, how big of an initial bump can one expect from the transition into corporate?"
consulting,3coxg7,jabokeysticks,3,Thu Jul 9 19:20:56 2015 UTC,"Ahh, then you're one of the lucky ones, I guess!  Personally, my bump was about how much I expected my raise would've been this year in consulting. So in two short years, I would've seen better salary increases in consulting.  Oh, they also threw in a signing bonus so that sweetened the pot.  Most of my other colleagues jumped at least 2 years of expected salary gain (15-25%) when they made the move.   Outside of pure salary, benefits are better or equal in all categories, and my commute went from highly variable local projects / weekly domestic travel to a 5 minute drive. Though not so relevant for you perhaps, these were additional considerations for me.   By the time I made the move, I've made the personal and career decision that money wasn't the end goal for me. I've heard it say that money is the best yardstick for success, but I prefer to have more time to spend with family and friends.  I've always had the notion that as long as I had food in my belly and a roof over my head, everything else is just a cherry on top.   But maybe I'm a weirdo in that way, and maybe that's why I was never really a fit for consulting.  #realtalk"
consulting,3coxg7,skaray,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:58:10 2015 UTC,"Kind of a random question, what sort of position titles should I look out for, for consulting -> industry transition?"
consulting,3coxg7,jabokeysticks,3,Thu Jul 9 21:12:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on sooooo many factors:   How long you've been in consulting and your current rank What type of consulting you've been doing How many years of experience you have overall What you're looking for What industry you've been in, and whether you'll be staying in your native field    Some examples I can think of off the top of my head: Analyst, Business Analyst, Strategy Analyst, Business Optimization Analyst, Process Analyst, Process Engineer, Systems Analyst, IT Analyst, Technology Analyst, Data Scientist, Requirements Analyst, Project Manager, SCRUM Master, Business Manager, Vice President, Chief Executive Officer.  You can also add a ""Senior"" to each of these titles, or replace ""Analyst"" with ""Associate"", ""Professional"", or ""Specialist"".  I feel like the title doesn't matter as much as the fulfillment of the list of responsibilities.  The title may say ""Requirements Analyst"" but require 7 years of requirements experience and pay 120k.  Another title may say ""Senior Project Manager"" but require only 3 years of experience and pays 65k.  A total crapshoot.  You should look at the job description and determine whether you feel you have the proper experience and more importantly, desire to fill the role.  Talking with Hiring Manager during the interview process will give you a better feel for the role.  Make sure the salary requirements for that role is in line with what you want (via glassdoor, payscale, etc).  Its not the most straightforward answer, but its the correct answer."

consulting,3coxg7,jabokeysticks,2,Fri Jul 10 03:43:58 2015 UTC,"If you're early in your career (2-4 years), I don't feel like that's too much of a concern. More so than knowledge of a specific software, framework, or methodology, hiring managers are looking for intelligent people they can get along with, who can reasonably learn to do the job, and will likely be a good corporate fit. But yes, it's helpful to have ""relevant experience"" so that your resume passes the initial screening. That's why it's so important to phrase your experiences in a way that seems applicable to the job description. Within reason, spin and tailor that shit so that on paper, you look like a great fit  Likely, that specific software isn't the only thing you've learned throughout the years. You've probably picked up loads of other skills, like project management, process improvement, data analysis, etc. Your marketability isn't about the inventory of your career achievements. Your marketability is all about how you MARKET yourself and convince the interviewers how much passion you have for the company, how good of a fit you could be for the team, and how much value and insight you can bring to the table, even if it's not a one to one match of the job description.   Hope this gives you some reassurance!"

I never felt like I had a seat at the table, whereas my other colleagues were better able to wheel and deal.  I was the runt of the litter without a teat to suck on.    I have reservations in saying that consulting is a meritocracy, but at least in consulting the promotions are scheduled and are approved democratically by a committee of senior management.  In corporate, I suppose you're really at the mercy of your manager and how much they like/dislike you.    In any case, you still have to play the game."

Miami has a bunch of weirdos, knuckleheads and tools in a disproportionate amount. San Diego is more relaxed and friendlier. b) things to do - Miami has the beach and bars, the NBA team and baseball. SD has all that plus more varied music, NFL and is really close to Anaheim and LA for hockey. SD is also near the border so you get the country's best Mexican food and you can holiday there easily for short getaways (think long weekends).

E.g. if you are hard tied to tech or entertainment, you need to be on the west coast. If you are media or finance focussed, you need to be on the east coast. If you are oil and gas you basically need to be central/south east (with a couple exceptions). If you are a P&U specialist, the east coast is the better option due to population density, and number of States and cities.  That's all I can think of for now. Hope it helps."

Last time I taught the New Analyst class all the teachers were pissed that none of the analysts were going to the bar to hang out.  Just don't do anything too stupid or be a super suck up to the Mgr, SMgr, MD or try to do shots with the Executives who clearly don’t want to do them.  Unless you do something beyond dumb, what happens in St Charles stays in St Charles.  I remember the first time I went to the bar there.  It was back in the Andersen days and I was expecting a stately oak bar with brandy snifters.  I walk in to see neon light on the walls, a fog machine running, girls dancing on the tables, and somebody had puked all over the bathroom.  My teacher was literally forcing tequila shots down my throat.  And everybody hooked up with everybody.  Crazy times at St Charles is a rite of passage.  Welcome!"

A few years later, her firm (now consulting) yanked an offer from a full-time hire who used a fake at a sell event... and bragged about it in the restroom within earshot of the catering manager. When I was an MBA consulting intern, one of the undergrad interns caught some serious side eye from a Partner for trying to use a fake to get into a club. He ended up aborting mission, and it seems to have worked out ok. Dicey though.   If there's an open bar and you haven't been carded, use your own discretion.

consulting,3cmar1,soumyadeepsam,8,Thu Jul 9 00:41:19 2015 UTC,"No. 2 for sure.  Reasons:   Minimum wage in a big city is going to be miserable living. It will be hard to find time to job search while trying to pull down commission and commuting an hour+ out to the affordable 'burbs.  Consulting firms don't care where you live now. You might have to travel for interviews, and I wouldn't lead with ""I need money to relocate."" Supply chain for F500 sounds wayyy better than no-name firm with a weird bunch of niche practices.   Tips:   Forget about building your network gradually. Figure out a chain of people that leads to each of the consulting firms you're interested in... and be deliberate and relentless about connecting the dots. Easier said than done, I realize, but if the connections exist why take your time? The consulting job market is phenomenal right now. If you're really set on MBB or a generalist role, consider an /r/MBA. Otherwise, maybe focus on firms with healthy supply chain practices (ATKearney comes to mind.)"

I believe in face to face networking and Meet up groups and the fact that that is only possible in a big city is what bothers me.

The pay increase from Senior Consultant to Manager does depend. Given that you were hired fresh out of b-school, I would guess you are in the $100 - 110 range now, give or take depending on the firm and group.  I'd expect to be at about $120 or so at the manager level. That's where I was when I came back to consulting after b-school. You are probably at the extreme top range for senior consultants right now, so your increase won't be as much as if you were promoted internally.   Pay for different positions usually works in bands, so you should expect to be at the low end of the range once you're promoted and at the high end of the range now.  With that said, everything everyone says about the group you're in definitely affects it, too. For reference, I was in a strategic operations group for medium to large clients (generally $750M - $2 or $3 billion revenue).

You don't see much in terms of raises until you get a few years into the next level.  To put hard numbers to it, I've seen anywhere from 2 -8% on initial promotion."

consulting,3cggwe,poodl3IsMe,6,Tue Jul 7 18:48:49 2015 UTC,"MBB is the gold standard.  They open more doors, have better alumni networks, and a recruiter will likely pick the person from MBB if all else is equal.  That said, rare is the case where ""all else is equal"".  I think most are aware that many MBBers would have been a PWCer if he/she had gotten a harder case that interview day.  Or that many S&Os would have been MBB if they had an interviewer that just didn't happen to have a bad day.    Ultimately it'll come down to how you perform at ATK.  If you're a rockstar who ends up working on the firm's top projects, you'll beat out the run of the mill MBBers, not even to speak of those who get CTL'd and just did projecct management.  If you're charismatic, you'll beat out the many MBBers who end up focusing on models and have a hard time managing clients.  If you take on leadership activities outside of work, that'll set you apart from any who don't.  This'll be true for both MBA and future prospects.    I will say that ATK, because of its specialty in sourcing, procurement, may end up pushing you towards this bucket.  I would tell you to go on LinkedIn, look at the companies that you want to work for in the future, and see where those people worked prior.  Regardless, ATK is a great firm - if you accept there, just focus on doing your best, learning how to excel at the position above you, and positioning yourself for the future."

I think that one or two of MBB have a recruiting presence at my school, though I'm sure the amount of students they take is very limited. However, there are opportunities with other firms as well.  For the past few weeks I've been mulling the possibility of getting into consulting (for a variety of reasons). The problem is that everything I've done up to this point has been geared toward a career in public accounting. I've attended summer programs at Big 4 firms (for tax), and early internship offers (for Summer 2016) will come out later this summer. I also have a scheduled interview coming up later this summer for a full year tax internship at a local firm.   I'm wondering if its worth the risk to reject internship offers that come my way, cancel the interview, and focus on a building a consulting oriented resume? Based on what I've read on this sub, there's no way I'll get internship offers from top firms without any prior experience. Would the path then be to try to get an internship during the school year at a recognizable name, then go for the top tier firms?  I currently have a 3.75 GPA. I'm also considering studying for and taking the GMAT before school starts just to show firms that I have what it takes. What I'm worried about is that I have no prior actual internship experience, or anything really relevant for that matter. If I get internship offers from Big 4 firms, I'm practically set for a full-time offer later on. Is it worth it to leave that behind to pursue a job at a top consulting firm? Or should I stick with what I have going right now? Would it also be feasible to commit to a Big 4 summer internship for next year, and then try to get a consulting internship during the upcoming school year to see which field of work I enjoy more?   Apologies for the wall of text! It's hard to find people to talk about my specific situation with irl, so I appreciate any advice I can get from here."

Some people on this sub would advise you to take the tax internship then still recruit for other consulting internships. That's a question of ethics on your part. It's also picking the right people to burn who won't bite you in the ass in the future...  It's harder coming from a state / non target school, hence why taking a Big 4 tax is probably your best route if your background screams accountant.

consulting,3cd3eq,18brumaire,2,Tue Jul 7 14:51:14 2015 UTC,Double majors and multiple degrees are relatively normal. Especially outside the U.S. where a BA is generally only three years and also free/almost free.
consulting,3cd3eq,QiuYiDio,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:21:42 2015 UTC,"Not in UK/Europe. Having two BAs is a hallmark of the perennially indecisive or privately wealthy. Although worth mentioning that 'dual honours' (which is broadly the equivalent of double major here) is still just one degree.  Also, after your first undergraduate degree which may be 'free' or publically subsidised (tuition), the tap is turned off. If you want a second undergraduate degree, most EU countries will charge you the 'real cost' price - usually the same sticker price they bill internationals. You'll also, usually, no longer qualify for student aid/bursaries. Hence why they are uncommon, and where found, raise eyebrows."

I'm sick of academia, disillusioned with the nonprofit sector, and am considering consulting post PhD (also have a BA/MSc from decent schools).

I have decent leadership, writing, and (qualitative) research skills and some work experience in the nonprofit and government sectors.  I'm still trying to figure out whether I'd want to be a consultant; as such I have a few questions:  1) Given my background, am I qualified for any of the Big 4 firms?  If so, what job level (intern, entry, mid etc.)?  2) are qualitative research skills valued or only quant?  (only have basic quant)  Are there other firms outside the big 4 with a qualitative emphasis that might be interesting?  3) Are there any firms that are known for having an uncompetitive / congenial culture or a culture that values creativity?  How about somewhat of a focus on CSR?  4) Do any firms engage in particularly interesting work, or is it all about the same?    5) [I'm just interested in this]  What do you like about being a consultant?

Yes, and levels are tricky.  At an organization that goes Analyst > Consultant > Senior Consultant > Manger ..., you'd be coming in at a Consultant (soon to be promoted to SC), or Senior Consultant (this is where most MBA's come in at).   2) are qualitative research skills valued or only quant? (only have basic quant) Are there other firms outside the big 4 with a qualitative emphasis that might be interesting?   I do HR Strategy, and about 80% of my work is more qualitative than quantitative.  But, you need to be well balanced in both (for example, you might not be able to pass a quant heavy case if you're deficient there).   3) Are there any firms that are known for having an uncompetitive / congenial culture or a culture that values creativity?    Few and far between, but they exist.  Consulting in nature is an up or out culture.     4) Do any firms engage in particularly interesting work, or is it all about the same?

consulting,3cd3eq,YepThatsRight,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:45:31 2015 UTC,"The study abroad period will hurt you substantially. All large firms and many boutiques will have interviewed and selected all their new hires prior to the year end. The typical cycle is on campus recruiting Aug-Oct, interviews Sep-Nov, offer Nov-Dec to start the following summer or fall.   Additionally, most companies won't care about individual classes you took, or really even what major you had, as long as you can demonstrate quantitative skills. Real econometrics may be used at more specialized firms, and typically used by PhDs or specialists. Generalist undergrads would unlikely use it.  Most big MC firms have energy or basic industry groups. You'd have to do a lot of internal networking and demonstrate your skills after being hired to begin specializing, but it's very possible.

Frankly, this version probably wouldn't make my ""maybe"" pile, assuming other strong candidates suggest IB/MC isn't a last minute thought. I see this issue a lot with premeds / science academics. Reframe the entire resume about how you have wanted to do consulting or business or quantitative thinking/solving and it will be much stronger.  Example: First government job. Talk less about using tools (yes, important, but most people will assume you know the basics of Microsoft products).

This could be through a club.  Stop thinking of your resume from a student/academic perspective. Companies do not care about major, classes, programming languages (unless a specific job requirement). They care if you seem like the kind of person who can be trusted with big name clients and will act as a representative to the firm.

Consulting does solve real problems. The best definition I have is that:  Consulting is the art and science of solving business problems.  A consultant is someone employed to do this. At the top there are management consultants with directives like: Tell us how we can increase revenue?"" At the more mid-tier it tends to be: ""Help us implement Oracle."" or ""Evaluate our sales compensation process.""  Really though a consultant or a firm is anyone hired to solve any business problem for money. Because of the nature of human relations, much if not most of the solutions come down to more communication skills than raw brainpower. Firms, because they tend to be able to measure it better, can hire pretty easily for business brainpower. It's the soft skills, the ""art"" of communicating that takes all the time and everyone complains about. It means that many miss the forest for the trees and think it's all bullshit. It's not.

Things like the school tier, GPA, extracurriculars, etc.  If you don't already have friends at the firms you are interested in, then two major ways to network:  1) Alumni Network - your best option. Go to www.linkedin.com/alumni and see if you can 'warm call' fellow alumni who are at firms you want to join  2) LinkedIn - your other good option. Just connect with people who seem like they might be favorable to having a chat. You'd be surprised at how willing people will say yes. And, if they are busy, worst case scenario is they click 'delete' and forget about it entirely. Once you do get someone to chat with, obviously don't just jump off with, ""CAN YOU GIVE ME AN INTERVIEW"". Start off telling them that you are really interested in consulting and wanted to learn more from an actual practitioner. Through the course of conversation, try to seamlessly work in a request to connect with someone else. For instance, if they mention that a colleague did something you are really interested in, see if they would be willing to set up an introduction. Then do the same thing with the new person. You'll learn a lot about consulting, the firm, and even build a little network. With each conversation you grow more knowledgeable and you'll even start speaking like you already work there. Each person you speak with becomes more and more impressed. At some point, when you feel comfortable, start asking what they think the best 'next step' is for someone given your position.

Outside of access to on campus recruiting events, the advice about networking is right on and has worked for many people.  One key is to shake off rejection.  Batting 3/10 in baseball is awesome, batting 1/10 in networking is actually pretty solid.  One positive connection can turn into 1 or 2 introductions.

I would like to begin a career path geared towards consulting starting with an internship next summer. I'm currently doing a summer internship at a financial institution, and have just over 4 years of work experience.   I was hoping someone could help critique my resume and cover letter and help me cater it towards landing a consulting internship for the next summer. I'm open to chatting on the phone or exchanging emails, either way I want to get a head start so I can be as well prepared as possible for recruiting season.   I'm most interested in management consulting, however the bulk of my work experience comes from IT which I use to pay for school, and I feel like it would be difficult to leverage that towards management.   I hope this is the right place to post this, and I appreciate any advice you all can give me."

Went to a target undergrad, majored in bio, master's in bio-engineering.  Anyway, I'm considering leaving after getting my PhD (not finishing the MD), and I think consulting would be a great fit for my personality and skills. What should I do to prepare myself for interviewing and transitioning from PhD to consulting? Most of the consulting career prep advice online is for business students, and the few sites/articles that are geared to MD & PhD students seem to be very vague.

I've posted this before, but here is the dirty little secret that no one in consulting likes to talk about:  just about everyone at Big 4 (or lower tiers) would jump ship to MBB in half a heartbeat.  The pay is better, it has more prestige and the exit options are more impressive; why wouldn't you?!?  So, given that fact, getting in from Big 4 is super, super hard.  You have to literally be better than every other consultant you work with and be able to convince MBB that they would be better off hiring you - despite the fact that you have been trained differently and grew up on another culture.

I would expect you could move within the big 4, but typically the only reason to do that is if you're unhappy and want a salary bump...keep in mind this is basically starting over in terms of your internal network.

Who in their right mind would want to go to France. At that salary bracket, you will be paying 3 times more tax in France than in Switzerland.   Also think ahead in the future, even though Switzerland is more expensive to live in. You can still put more money away a month than you could in any country outside of Switzerland.  If money is no none of your concern, then go to Paris. With 100k you will live quite nice there depending where you live in the city. In some areas rent is just as high as in Switzerland."
consulting,3c80pp,ghstw,3,Sun Jul 5 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right for a post-MBA European salary. Some places like London (and possibly Switzerland?) pay 20-30% higher, and the US is sometimes more again. You should also expect a ~20% bonus on top of this, and possibly a ~10% sign-on.  Salary progression should average about 10-20% a year, although bonuses can grow more quickly if you're part of a team that is selling lots of work.  Consulting pays quite well but there are many careers which can pay more. As you get more senior industry jobs often pay more. This is off-set by the career boost you can get by doing a few years consulting and then returning to industry.  Paris is not that expensive, you'd probably manage fine on 100k + 20k + 10k."

It tests more of your ability to understand what are the numbers being asked for and how to go around getting the result i.e. translating words/phrases into numbers and vice versa. Getting faster at mental math and at doing operations may not necessarily increase your speed significantly if that is the problem.
consulting,3c59i7,anonypanda,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:40:32 2015 UTC,The maths is simple but they try to twist words in every way they can in order to make it difficult and combine that with the time pressure of 1 minute per question.
consulting,3c59i7,anonypanda,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:59:33 2015 UTC,"I'm a uni grad who is starting at a Big 4 consultancy in London, and as someone who has gone from 72 percentile to 99-100 percentile on these tests, here are some tips.   First things first: it seems like the time pressure is getting to you. Don't think of it as you having to complete all 20 questions within the time limit. It is used to increase the difficulty of the tests so that you can get a nice normal distribution of the applicants. Just do your best and over time you'll get the hang of it. Do practice tests. You can get them online for free all over the web with some searching. Books are great but they aren't the same as using your calculator and your computer. Try to replicate the test setting every time you do it, e.g. with mouse and calculator positioned in the same place so you cut time on picking it up/looking for it. You can start with SHL themselves, they have timed practice tests and even tell you what percentile you're at. Read the question properly. The problem with these tests is that they are designed to trick you if you aren't paying close attention. Sometimes they may give you a few lines on X company but ask for the information on Y company. Like you said, the math is simple but it's just understanding what the question really wants.  At the AC the tests are going to be significantly harder than those online, but the good thing is that you just have to get a 50% to pass the written tests. Remember that the psychometric tests are just one small aspect of the whole application process. There is only a cut-off to weed out the poorer applicants, and there's no difference between a 75% and an 85% applicant when they're considering you (unless its literally down to 1 spot left)   Most importantly, apply early. EY opened their 2016 applications on the 1st of July, and Deloitte/PwC opens on the 1st of Sept. Make a note of these dates and make sure you get your application sent in as soon as possible. ACs and Partner interviews are scheduled on a first-come-first-served basis and you may be good enough to get them but not be given one due to a lack of availability. That's pretty much what happened for me for one of my choices.  Good luck!"

I'd recommend leveraging your machine learning background to pursue consulting opportunities in the data science/analytics space. MBB, Deloitte, PwC, and EY all have practices or teams that do this kind of work, and there are a number of niche firms that do as well.  As someone with a similar background currently working for one of the aforementioned companies in this space, I can tell you that most interviews will include at least one case study with a data analysis component. You'll get a vague problem to solve, an idea of how the data is stored/accessed within the organization, and asked to devise a strategy for using the data to solve that problem.  The way to stand out in interviews, though, is to show that you can communicate technical concepts to clients or colleagues who don't have a technical background. Discuss some of the projects you have worked on but tell a story and frame that story within the business context. ""I created a classification algorithm with an error of x"" isn't nearly as impactful as ""my classification algorithm saves the client $xx,xxx each month.""  Hope that helps."

Kaggle competitions might be one way I guess,any thoughts?"
consulting,3c45yf,sdgwrh2d,0,Sun Jul 5 09:05:20 2015 UTC,"Hard for me to give any kind of recommendation on courses without knowing more about your background and the school you're currently attending. When trying to consult in a niche field, I don't know that business classes on your resume necessarily help you as much as just being able to position yourself as a subject matter expert within your field. If you're looking at business classes, look for courses that give you experience with case studies, working in groups, business analysis, and consulting-type projects over generic accounting and finance courses. As far as statistics classes, I would assume that you've already taken enough pre-requisites for your master's to not make that a necessity but if not, focus on regression, data mining, and linear algebra topics.  As far as expanding your resume, Kaggle will help if you haven't worked on any projects during your Master's or time as a developer. If you have then I think it makes more sense to work at improving your communication abilities. As I said before, you need to be able to tell a story about some of the most impactful projects you've worked on: ""The business/professor/client wanted to know A because of B, so I decided to use C to solve this problem. This didn't work because D, so I changed gears and used E instead. I sold the client on this solution using F. In the end, my solution saved the client $G.""   If this method of describing your results, thought process, and problem solving abilities doesn't come naturally then try asking a friend/family member/significant other for help. Sit them down, walk them through a project you worked on using the framework above, and ask them to interrupt you whenever they get confused or bored. This will help you tighten your ""success stories"" and keep them from being too technical.  This process should help prepare you for the behavioral-style questions you'll encounter during the interview process, and once you feel comfortable with that, you can move to standard case study practice."

You enable both of you to have a quorum in regular intervals and hold each other accountable. Now while your client may flake, all these are billable hours, so you're still charging time for meetings that they miss (and which you've included upfront in the contract).     The problem is that this is usually scheduled and discussed during the project kickoff, and/or is included in the Statement of Work and contract. To be honest, I would really encourage you to review some of these business and client management practices prior to going out on your own. If you're already dealing with issues like this, it might be the client, but it might also be that you've still a few things to learn in running your own ops. Also, hope this isn't sounding critical, I mean to encourage you. It seems that you have quite the skillset and are talented if you have valuable clientele reaching out to you. At the same time, this might be indicative of why the client is reaching out to you and has been unable to complete work in the past.    In sum, don't fire your client yet.

Unless they have a need for you in their healthcare tech consultant group, you will be probably shit out of luck. Also just depends on how closely your skills matched with the job description. It may be worth sending a quick note to someone in recruitment in the city you applied for. Maybe they want to bring on some new talent since they oversold.   If they don't have a need for your skill set at the current time you could look into specialized health care consulting firms. I don't know any off the top of my head, but I'm sure the Big4 dabble in it a bit. A quick google or taking a look at Vault would be a good bet.  If that doesn't work, a MBA would be the way into consulting. The reasons why is two fold. It allows you to reset your career by getting on the radar for recruiting for a number of companies who in between your undergrad and MBA didn't care about you.

consulting,3bvtlw,consultingresumeQ,19,Thu Jul 2 15:48:07 2015 UTC,You have the skills and knowledge to advance science and make a real impact on the world.  You sure you want to do consulting and have essentially zero impact on society?
consulting,3bvtlw,ChiGuy50,14,Thu Jul 2 16:23:20 2015 UTC,"This is a common sentiment, and often one used (either intentionally or not) to keep students on the ""straight and narrow"" to go into academia. I know the general consensus is that consulting has no impact on society, but--as another student about to get their PhD in a STEM field--allow me to offer a different perspective.  Following four years of undergrad and an average of 5.5 years of grueling doctoral work, most students do not go directly into a faculty position but--instead--go on to a position called a post-doc. The average salary for these positions is ~$38,000 a year with almost no raise in salary year over year. Originally designed to be a 'skill-building' position before becoming a research professor, these are becoming a ""holding tank"" for graduates. There aren't enough research professor jobs (due to reductions in science funding), so--despite >50% of students wanting to be a professor coming into graduate school--less than 8% succeed. Whether you get the chops to succeed is, to a degree, luck: you can be the most awesome scientist in the world, but if you don't find something (usually several somethings) that make a decently large impact, you're not going to be doing much.  The post-doc typically lasts 2-4 years, after which you can try for a faculty position. 2-4 years of making ~$40k/year after 9+ years of post-secondary education. If you DO somehow land a faculty position (again, this is a minority of positions; some , you have 6 years before being reviewed for tenure. If you're not consistently amazing (again, ""amazing"" being ""high-impact studies"", something that is often out of your control whether it yields incredible data), you may not achieve tenure; in which case, you're asked to leave. So you can spend over ten years, earning a shit wage, after your PhD only to be told you're not good enough to keep doing academic research (outside of even more poorly-paid positions).  This isn't limited to only shitty scientists, either. I have seen amazing researchers continually get shot down, over and over again, and barely have enough funding to keep the lights on.   So there's a reason some of us desperately want to leave academia: if we're not going to be able to change the world, we may as well make decent money while we're at it and have more control over our lives. For a lot of us--myself included--it's a very difficult decision.

They pay you around 48K+ for no experience. You're stuck there for many years. You can't switch projects to another Federal project because the Program Manager has the power to deny the transition. The only way you can then get out is if you quit or try to go Commercial ( Accenture LLP).   Consultants (Level 9) have a year long engagement and can switch projects after contract is finished.   I am transitioning to another firm because AFS is where you go if you want your career to die. A lot of people here want to get out. Some are lucky enough to get into LLP.

Ones that currently come to mind are:   I need to determine what rate to charge. I live in the middle of the country, so cost of living isn't on the high end. The plan is to help small businesses with IT issues using cloud based solutions. I currently have two jobs lined up with previous contacts of mine. One I have a previous set rate from years ago I'm using, the other is a friend that owns a plumbing business that I'm going to charge a low rate anyway because 1. he's a friend and he's fixed my busted plumbing at a cheap rate and 2. Hoping to start a base of word of mouth referrals with his business.   So outside of the two above, I was thinking of charging $65/hr for my work. The tricky part is that most of my time will be spent researching how to best implement their solution vs. actually implementing it on site. Is it kosher to charge time for researching a solution even if they can't see you doing it?   besides perusing tech sites, what are some good resources for doing research on the various cloud based solutions out there. The idea is to be able to implement technology solutions for small businesses (we're talking 1-50 people) without having to set up and maintain internal IT infrastructure. I'm aware of the big ones like Azure, Office 365, AWS, etc. I've been discovering new ones like Shoeboxed, which I'm actually helping my plumber friend implement to digitize all his backed up paper invoices.

How long would it take them to have someone come out to the customer premises? Would they stay there until the problem was sorted out, or only for a fixed maximum length of time?  Do they offer flexible billing options? (Established practices may not, preferring to trade off slightly fewer customers for significantly reduced administrative costs/complexity.)  Do they treat smaller customers as if they're honestly important to the consultant company's bottom line? You're able to provide better service because, to you, customers which the big names might consider piddly small fry are the ones which pay your rent. Some people just don't like being the little dog in any business relationship.  Have you checked online to see if anyone has written about their experience with your competition, or could be persuaded to, and if so, what were some of the more common problems your competitors' customers complained about? Could you offer a service which addresses these problems?  Are you able to provide a much more personalized service?

Does the client get actuals or aggregate expenses?   Basically, if the answer both of those is no (under budget and client gets aggregate) then you could rent a penthouse at the Waldorf and I probably wouldn't care (not really but you get my point).  If the answer to either of those questions is yes, then I will dig into it a little bit.  If you are on a large enough project, everyone's expenses should be more or less the same, even accounting for differences in airfare.  My goal is not to deny you any of the creature comforts we need, nor is it to bust your ass for using your defined expense maximums; rather, its just to make sure that everything looks kosher and I can justify everything in the expense report.  Unless you are doing something that makes you a real outlier - booking a $300/night hotel when the going rate is $180 or charging $5,000 a week for airfare - I won't bother you about it.

You could put out hail mary applications to the likes of OW or S& etc. but in general just because a firm is ""mid-tier"" or ""2nd tier"" doesn't make it much easier to get in. Some boutiques can be easier to get in because they don't look at GPA as much as they look for people with skills in the specialist areas they serve.

Tough to say.  The fact that you have run your own firm will certainly look good on your resume and it is possible that some mid to low tier firms would be interested in hiring you based on that.  That said, you do have a low GPA for even Big 4 firms and only 2 years of post undergrad work experience; this would put you in the lower tier of experienced hire candidates that apply.  Odds are you will need to get your MBA if MC is a career goal for you.  MBAs serve as a sort of ""career reset"" button that allow you to refocus on learning modern business and get you back in the campus recruiting cycle for MC firms.  My advice would be to pursue both right now - reach out to your personal network and see if you know anyone who works at MC firms that can drop your resume internally (much higher probability of successes than just applying online).  Take interviews as the come and see if you can get in the door that way.  At the same time, start studying for the GMAT and scouting MBA programs that would position you well for MC; not every firm recruits at every school and it is very difficult to get in if you are from a non target school.  Hedge your bets by doing both and see which one looks like it will work out.  Best of luck."

Are there exceptions - sure.  However it is very uncommon.

Among the reasons I'm exploring consulting, some of them may apply to many PhDs and they are as follows:   While many of us start PhDs dreaming to be a professor one day, the reality is that there's only 1 tenure track position for 10 of us. Additionally we see professors who already passed that bar suffer greatly with increasing demands: mainly, the increasing competitiveness of getting grants to keep the lab going(recent data show funding rate at <15% for most sizable grants) Doesn't help that we see many labs shutting down in the past few years. This gets many of us to start looking elsewhere. PhDs are all about solving all sorts of problems, but many feel trapped by the narrow focus that comes with the PhD training while genuinely enjoying problem solving. Enter consulting. You are telling me that I get to quickly design experiments, quickly gather data, quickly make decisions that have immediate, real life impact? (Vs slow translation of academic research) also gotta tell you how surprised I was when I learned how consulting works is very similar to how research works.    On the other hand, from mba's point of view, I suppose there are more attractive options nowadays, such as joining a start up, vc, pe, other innovative firms etc etc. I don't have the concrete stats to back this up though.  I have been told in one of mck info session that other advanced degree holders made 40% of 2015 class. I think the recent expansion and rapid growths in certain high tech areas must have created the need for PhDs as well. Also the tools and analyses used in consulting are getting more and more refined and granular that PhD training in stem fields may be especially relevant.   Those are my random late night thoughts."

consulting,3bpuld,consultingresumeQ,6,Wed Jul 1 05:47:23 2015 UTC,"Hi, PhD-to-MBBer here.  There's a couple of ""macro"" reasons:   MBB are all growing (very) quickly over the last ~10 years. They used to be able to fill up for the most part with MBAs, but that isn't a big enough pipeline. Going after PhDs (esp. STEM) is a natural alternative. Consulting is still reasonably popular among MBAs, but declining a bit due to competition with prestige tech firms. The other alternatives for PhDs are terrible. The academic path involves similar hours to MBB for 1/3 pay or worse throughout your career. Industry options pigeonhole PhDs into technical / R&D functions with limited advancement opportunities.   These aren't the whole story, but they cover about 80% of it :)"
consulting,3bpuld,SpicyTunaPirate,4,Wed Jul 1 10:40:52 2015 UTC,"My impression is that it is a combination of two main factors:  1) MBB have grown large enough that they can no longer recruit just MBAs from the top business schools. They can either go to lesser schools or take the top candidates from other fields (PhD, JD, MD, etc.)  2) The academic job market is not growing appreciably yet the number of PhDs graduating each year continues to rise. Consulting is an attractive alternative to an industry job for many. http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n10/fig_tab/nbt.2706_F1.html"

consulting,3bpuld,EkmanSpiral,2,Wed Jul 1 18:53:40 2015 UTC,"These are two different questions.  Why do PhDs desire to work at MBB?   More money than academia Faster pace. In academia, you could spend years working on a single paperwork. And you'd be lucky to have 1-2 seminal works. More exit opps. Some PhD fields might offer many (econ, biopharma). Others might be pretty limited (philosophy). Burnt out on research, want to be closer to real-world impact.   Why do MBB hire PhDs?   It's certainly not a lack of interested MBA candidates. Many MBA students would pledge their first born for the opportunity. Better question is: Why not? If MBB can skim top talent from two giant pools of really smart folks (MBAs and PhDs), why wouldn't they? Diverse perspectives. PhDs are steeped in empirical evidence and rigorous inquiry. MBAs might get a dose of that, but not to the same degree. Knowledge transfer. It's a great way to get the best thinking from academia into MBB's consulting practice."

consulting,3bqby2,NEED_MORE_SMART,9,Wed Jul 1 08:02:23 2015 UTC,my brief research seems to show that Access is the way to go for constructing databases.   You need to throw out that research.   Employee information databases are such a common and well understood problem that it is best you get something off the shelf instead of building custom on any platform.  If what you're looking to do is track what skills employees have then what you need to start with is defining what skills are valuable to the organization. From there you'd need the employees to rate themselves against your skills matrix. Creating a data model to then describe that skills matrix is really not rocket science from there.  ...or seriously buy one of the >1million+ products which do exactly this.
consulting,3bqby2,anonypanda,3,Wed Jul 1 08:25:32 2015 UTC,"I've seen so many firms try to do this. They get the database looking good, in terms of the shell of it. Then they make a big effort to get people to enter their skills to it. This is shaky, because not everyone has the same feel for the levels they enter - one person might think they are an expert in 10 skills, when they are just competent. Another person will under-egg their skills.  Then, in a years time when nobody has bothered updating their skills in the database you are back to square one and it's all about who you know in the company, and who can tell you who knows what.   They fail, every single time."
consulting,3bqby2,sionnach,4,Wed Jul 1 09:25:16 2015 UTC,"Ok so first of all, WHY do you need an employee skills database? What is the objective behind having this database? What benefits will it bring to the business? What will it actually be used for?  The answers to these questions will shape the approach you take. And if this database isn't going to either drive an important process or provide some other sort of benefit to the organisation, then there's very little point.   Hard to say why size of organisation needs a skills database as another factor will be the type / breadth of services your company provides. For example, if you do one specific thing, most of your employees will have the same skills profile meaning a database might not be a worthwhile investment.   In terms of tooling, I'd only recommend using access if it really is only a handful of users, eg <50. Anything more you probably want something more robust and extensible like a SQL database.  For the skills themselves, you could construct a taxonomy of skills. This is a logical hierarchy of skills that you define up front. The alternative is a folksonomy arrangement whereby you let users specify skills in a tag-style format, but provide them with type ahead functionality on the form to try and avoid separate entries for things like ""dev"" and ""development"".   But generally it's very hard to answer any of your questions without a lot more information."
consulting,3bqby2,hairy_hat_man,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:23:37 2015 UTC,"Ok so first of all, WHY do you need an employee skills database? What is the objective behind having this database? What benefits will it bring to the business? What will it actually be used for?   Currently we're still a smaller firm of 50+ people working in import/export. While we've been focusing on a single product before, we thought we'd branch out not only into other product markets, but also by trying to create a new product ourselves.  The first goal doesn't really require any additional skills, since it's in essence the same work. Employees will only need some time to catch up on the product knowledge of whichever new item we're considering.   The second goal however, will need our firm to restructure/redistribute/acquire some new talent to fill needs we never had before. Product development requires a wide range of skills, and the database could help us 1) get to know personnel and skills we weren't utilizing fully before, and 2) set up an employee management system to account for the (hopeful) eventual growth of the company.   We're hoping such a database will not be too difficult to construct, which is why we're even considering it. And the reward will be that in the future, instead of finding a new graphic design firm, we'd just check to see if any of our current employees know CAD or 3D rendering.   You're probably right that the short-term payoffs are low. But if the costs are low as well, we may as well start one. Unless of course the time isn't right, which is why I asked the question in the first place haha.  What are some good ways that an employee/skills database can be utilized?

Currently we're still a smaller firm of 50+ people working in import/export. While we've been focusing on a single product before, we thought we'd branch out not only into other product markets, but also by trying to create a new product ourselves.   Not something you need to rush then?  Honestly, if I were you, I would see if it's possible to have you and maybe a few of your leadership team just sit down and interview with 2-3 people a week, each, if you can make the time. During the interviews, you all ask an agreed upon set of questions and take an agreed-upon set/style of notes, and then you can have someone junior take care of organizing it into a database (if you think that is necessary at the end).  A few reasons why:   If you send out some computer form about ""skills"" and tell everyone to fill it out, it's probably going to freak some people out - even though it will probably cost more it might be worth it to spend the time to do a personal 30 min interview with everyone and explain what it's for, be transparent, it's not to fire anybody (unless it is), etc etc. You could try to convey this in e-mail as well and it may work, but it will never work as well as in-person. You'll get more genuine data. If people get skittish they will exaggerate their self-reported skill levels and your data will be shitty. There's an issue if someone is checking the Python skill box on a form when they've only played around with it for 10 hours or so. Even if nobody exaggerates, it's hard to truly understand the legitimacy of the skills just from a quick questionnaire, unless you spent a lot of time developing your extensive and targeted questionnaire, in which case you may as well have interviewed the guy in person anyway since the time cost would be the same most likely (or potentially more - 30 minute interviews with 60 people is only 30 hours, how long would it take to develop an actual legitimate, usefully written survey?).   You don't even have to interview everyone - if you have junior people that you generally know about already, skip 'em.   That way you'll accomplish your actual goal of understanding skill levels without the overhead of some database you might not even need. And if you decide you actually do need it, it can always be built later - you have the notes.  Just how I would do it, without knowing the full situation"

Don't listen to me)   The IRS has a definition of who is and who isn't an independent contractor... but they don't care which you are. They get paid the same either way. Challenges typically arise when the employee/contractor and the employer/client don't see eye to eye on the correct status. This also has nothing to do with any contract. If you and your client decide you fit the definition of a contractor, you will pay quarterly taxes instead of having them withheld (state, federal, and SS/Medicare). Note that you'll owe both halves of SS/medicare (7.65% x 2 = 15.3%), whereas employees only owe 7.65%, with the employer paying the other half. Don't know. There must be contracts that exist; it's a pretty common obstacle. Perhaps your company has a simple boilerplate they use with other consultants/contractors? You should still have it reviewed by a lawyer, but that's cheaper that writing on from scratch. From years working in the construction industry, I can tell you this: ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, DO NOT try to draft a contract yourself. I can also guarantee that half of it will be unenforceable or will contradict other parts of it.

The idea is that you might start with that, go on to some other sites, and get an idea if what you want to do is relatively basic that you can handle on your own, or a special case for which you might want to seek help.  From reading over what you posted, it seemed like you should spend a good amount of time, to read over a lot of the basics for small biz, & contracts, etc., and I think you should start with (you could say), Small Biz Legal 101, from that website and/or wikipedia, etc. etc.  Here's another specific item or two to help get going:  As a new freelancer, you're essentially a Sole Proprietor and you'd expect to receive a Form 1099 at end-of-year (if you make more than $600).  You should provide them with an ID record form W-9 with either your SSN or preferably a business tax ID number (EIN) that you register for from IRS.gov.  This number is how they'd report your earnings as a contractor.  Go here for that:  http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-(EIN)-Online  Perhaps your next thing is to think of an looking for an independent contractor agreement template (Nolo might have one, but easy to find a starter), that spells out some basic terms both you & the client agree on, such as the fact that you're working exclusively as a contractor, etc.  Don't have to worry too much about IRS calling you an employee, out of the gate.  ...After you get this new client organized, and you're logging in 40+ hrs / week for months & months, and only working for them, well, by that time you'll have enough billings to go ahead and hire a pro.  As far as finding a good one to help, you can start with www.freelancersunion.org and search in your city/locale, and also don't forget to look up your local small biz development center or chamber of commerce.  Now that you're going this way, you have to start learning how to get info & answers in general case for your ""new, exciting lifestyle"", which you should start thinking of pretty sobering, because while it has its rewards, you have to take responsibility for a lot of stuff, including learning a lot of these basics."

consulting,3bkzty,Brandon432,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:16:48 2015 UTC,"Its not questionable at all, normally.    However, in my experience, when you are going through an expense audit everything becomes questionable.  For example, I've seen them ask what time you put that breakfast expense in because they want to make sure you weren't trying to expense lunch as breakfast (which we don't reimburse for).  Going back 6 months and trying to align your personal CC billing statements against what you charged to the firm is very time consuming.  If you have done nothing wrong then you should come out the other side clean but I've known people who have gone through it and it is a giant pain in the ass.  Putting it all on the firm card just makes the process cleaner and less subject to scrutiny.  For me, at least, it isn't worth running the risk for the extra points.  *Edit:  My only point was that if your firm has a policy that you should use your firm credit card for expenses then that is the policy and it should be followed.  Even if there is some leeway with that (I've charged firm expenses to my personal card in the past for a variety of reasons) you open yourself up to a good deal of scrutiny that you just don't want - lets be perfectly honest, who here hasn't taken a liberty or two on the fringes of our expense policy?"
consulting,3bkzty,Ansuz07,2,Tue Jun 30 15:23:09 2015 UTC,"First thing to do is sign up for all the possible loyalty programs (Skymiles, AAdvantage, United MileagePlus, Hilton Honors, SPG, Marriott, Avis, Hertz, etc.). You never know when circumstances make you stay at a hotel or rent a car outside of your norm. Accelerate your way to the highest membership status. Most hotels and car rental places will have a program to expedite matching your status at a competing hotel chain or car rental chain. So for example if you end up choosing SPG as your hotels of choice, but want Marriott status you can just call and get the status matched through fewer stays Similar to the point above, many firms tend to have relationships with airlines and often have promotions where if you travel a certain number of segments (lower than the normal) within a short period of time they expedite your status. Ask around your firm and see how you can sign up for this. Get your firm credit card and make sure you sign up for the rewards membership (most likely Amex Membership Rewards for around $80-$100). It will pay for itself very quickly. Don't be afraid of getting multiple credit cards so long as you are responsible in spending, managing the cards, and paying off your bills on time. You can find a way to maximize the points you earn by using certain cards for certain purchases. Many rewards programs have the ability to transfer points from one to another. Check out https://www.flightfishing.com/tools/pointcalc and see how your points can transfer between loyalty and reward programs. I recommend going with something like Chase Ultimate Rewards (Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Ink Plus - if you can pull off having a business) as it is the most flexible in transferring points to airlines and hotels.    Have fun and good luck. /r/personalfinance and /r/churning are great resources for learning more about these things."
consulting,3bkzty,siddharthd,2,Tue Jun 30 16:33:37 2015 UTC,"I'll break it down individually:  Airlines:  Sign up for each loyalty program; they are free to join and even when you are loyal to one airline you still may have to take a flight on a different airline based on client location.  After a month or so, you'll know which airline you are going to be loyal to and you can go from there; more than likely, it will be whichever airline uses your airport as a hub.  Hotels:  Such a bitterly divided topic.  The ones worth discussing are Marriott, Starwood and Hilton.  Marriott has by far the most properties but  they are not always the nicest; conversely, Starwood and Hilton have nicer properties but not every smaller city will have one.  I personally go with Starwood because I feel their points are more valuable and I like their hotels.  Credit Cards:  More than likely, you will need to use your firm card for most major purposes.  This will be an Amex and, depending on how much you travel, they may upgrade you to the Platinum for free.  That said, the Plat card is nearly worthless these days, IMO.  It gets you into very few domestic lounges and you can enroll the Green card to get you points for like $80/year.  If you travel internationally a good deal this equation may change, but for domestic I don't see the value.  As we venture into personal opinions, I prefer airline credit cards to hotel ones; when I vacation I am almost always short flight miles and have hotel points to spare.  I have the United Club card and put all my personal purchases on it; you get 1.5 miles/$ for purchases and it gets you into all the United/Star Alliance lounges.  Since I am a United guy, this makes sense for me; YMMV based on your airline but I highly recommend a card that gets you lounge access."

SPG Amex: Great for accelerating status on SPG and SPG redemptions... not much else. I was already SPG Gold when I started (and will make platinum easily), so skipped it. Chase Sapphire/Freedom is a great combo, since they have different bonus categories and Sapphire lets you upgrade your Freedom points to full-value Ultimate Rewards Points. Great sign-up bonus, travel partners, and redemption value. Citi Premier: Revamped program gives Chase a run for its money. Sign-up and redemption value is almost-as-good. If their travel partners are more appealing (1.6x on AA), then go for it. Amex Platinum/Citi Prestige: Great signup and access to ""things.'

I've watched firms piss away thousands of dollars in social media campaigns with very dubious ROI.   I'm seeing the same thing. One web marketing or SEO firm after another uses themselves as a success story for their product, but when you use them or try to use their techniques on a business that's in a different field, it just plain doesn't work.  Ultimately, you need a well-maintained social media presence as part of an overall brand image, but I think the idea that any business can just get some social media expert to do some Twitter or Facebook campaign and end up with enough customers to have paid for your time and trouble is flawed.  I've been working on a theory that the secret to any of this is to use social media and on-line assets in a way that makes you look bigger than you are. That's particularly what I'm seeing with small business web marketing experts. They post at a rate that makes them look like they've got 10 times more staff. It doesn't help businesses outside the marketing field because it doesn't make them look bigger, it just makes them look like they're not doing any real work.  My suggestion is to see what the bigger players in your industry with a good social media rating look like. Is their customer service via Twitter outstanding? Is their Facebook page like a dynamic FAQ mixed with a press release site? Are people liking all their Instagram posts of behind-the-scenes moments and cool-looking prototypes? Does their business of 100 people feel like a business of 100 people, all busily doing a good job? How can you make your business of 10 people feel the same?  And if you can't find any big players in your industry with active social media activity that's getting a lot of positive response, it could be that you customers are somewhere else."

We are concentrating on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn at the moment. I think LinkedIn has the most potential for a firm such as ours, as the professional content required doesn't flow well into the two other less formal domains.   When we acquire business relations with new firms, we plan to simply ask how they found us. Increased business solicitation and increased solicitation as a result of social media marketing are two worthwhile KPI's to pursue.   Making ourselves look bigger, as another has mentioned, may be another overarching strategy. How we achieve that though is what I'm working on right now."

I'd reccomend some type of MIS background to break into Big 4 in their IT Advisory groups. With an accounting background your most likely entrance can be in Risk Advisory where you're doing IT general controls testing.

But knowing how to program, in any language, is an invaluable skill.  A large chunk of the IT consulting work (at least at my big 4) is in the form of erp implementations, mainly SAP and Oracle. There are emerging groups like analytics and Cyber security you can also get in to. Sounds like you'd be a good candidate for any of these as long as you tack on an MIS major/minor."

Relocating to SF/ Silicon Valley really isn't part of the package, most shops don't have their consultant or development large offices in that area for a reason.

The interviewer will give you the necessary information to get to the target solution so long as you are using the right frameworks and asking the right questions to elicit that information.  If you are unfamiliar with the case interview process, you really need to get familiar quick.

I was once trying to building this two-sided area chart (imagine cumulative revenues on top, cumulative expenses on the bottom, and cumulative net profits in the middle).  On the first try, they literally DREW out the graph.  Unacceptable because the numbers were still changing.  On the second try, they made three separate graphs, overlaid them, and flipped one upside down to create the bottom.  So I could edit it, but super cumbersome and inelegant.  At that point, it was just more efficient for me to do it myself.  I will note that we also have a design team whose job is to think.

You could be an auditor, staff-aug admin or part of a build team.  Understanding your baseline security frameworks is pretty key (read NIST SP 800-53 for federal, 800-82 for industrial controls). Start there, get client buy-in on the frameworks. From there you can find continued justification for your work by referring back to the framework.   I worked my client projects and wrote white papers for the strategy/sales groups based on the NIST frameworks and the state of the industry. Get your contacts in those groups, they're good to know.   I started out as an industry generalist. I got my first crack at security from the sales folks, they knew my name from the BD work I'd done for them and passed it along to the SI (systems integration) folks. From there I was able to voice the preference to go the technical route which is where I wanted to be all along.

Emerging and disruptive technologies don't sit in a vacuum, in reality they have to fit in/replace/draw together existing infrastructure assets. If you look at a HLD - that cool disruptive technology doesn't sit in a bubble on the side, it needs support/resilience/administration/backup/security/fallover/DR/connectivity etc etc. You may not get involved in even the impacting stage of a project, let alone the implementation, but you sure as fuck need to know about that stuff.  What I am saying is - don't go in to this exploration period thinking that all infrastructure is the same as some nightmare SAP implementation that you've had experience of.

If by ""1 year"" you meant 9-10 months then even more so.  If it's actually 15 or so months that's a different story then.  However, if this was your first official review then I'm thinking you've probably been there less than a year.  Maybe a false expectation was set up front but I highly doubt many people get promoted in 9-12 months, why not just give you the manager title up front then? Changing firms could actually make your eventual promotion to the next level a longer path.  People don't promote strangers that they don't trust / haven't worked with (gets back to point #1).  By changing firms you are having to re-start the process of getting the ""buy in"" from people above you over again.  You can call it politics if you want but that's the reality, the people who get promoted are the people that the partners believe in.  You need to think if you want to re-start that process.  Also, you could get labeled a firm jumper (looking at your background, it sounds like you've been with 3-4 companies in 8 years), why would your new company be quick to promote you to a more senior (post-manager) level over someone who has been there their entire career? This is more subjective and may or may not matter to you, but there's no doubt PwC is a ""better"" firm/brand than KPMG.  Their practice is more built out / established than KPMG's.     So, I don't mean to say you definitely shouldn't hop firms, I just think it's a bit short sighted to just be looking at the title and salary.  There's obviously the risk then that you don't get promoted at PwC next year though, so you gotta weigh that."

I am currently at the Associate level and came in with 2 years industry experience. Am I expecting too much by thinking I deserve a promotion?

I transitioned from industry to consulting after two years and came in above the associate level.  That said, you got in which is significantly more important that the level, you can always work your way up.    Now, the fact that you've had industry experience and have been there two years and not been promoted is definitely suspect.  There may be something larger going on if you didn't get promoted after your 2+2 experience.  I'd start looking elsewhere and see what's out there.  At least talk to your supervising career guidance person / coach and get their candid thoughts."

consulting,3b9eso,PooFactory1,4,Sat Jun 27 01:34:53 2015 UTC,"I went the other way from industry to consulting, and things are different.  From what I've seen, industry has a longer horizon. When you launch the new project, you need it to work because it impacts your business. In consulting the launch of the project tends to be and end point.  If it works, you're done, there's less focus on impact.  That's not all bad, there is a different sense of ownership in industry, because you live with what you launched for longer.   The big drawback is talent. There aren't too many positions in consulting where a person is running the same report for 30 years.  It competitive, challenging, up or out. So it attracts people who want to excel and then reinforces that drive. So you'll come across Mabel in accounting who spends her free time on free cell and coasts through her day.

Depending on where you currently live, it could end up not being much of a raise at all.  Besides the comp increase, it sounds like the only draws for you are the brand and perception of ""impact"" - just my opinion, but both are overrated.  Also: my experience has been that people don't really go to industry unless they really hate consulting, need a lifestyle change (e.g. have kids), or they are not on partner track.

In consulting, banking, PE, marketing, or pretty much any other industry, I'd say elite/""fancy"" boutiques are usually distinguished by having founder/leaders drawn from the highest echelons of the industry (e.g. MBB partners, BBB MDs, megafund GPs, mega-CPG CMOs)."

I'm not talking about 10-20 schools like MBB go to. I'm talking 3-4 schools like Bridgewater. Or eschewing MBA recruiting in favor of poaching top talent from other firms/outside of the industry (e.g. traditional PE model, IDEO hiring top engineers and psychologists, small consultancies hiring away top-MBB talent). Niche focused. It's hard to be elite in everything. ""Elite"" status is probably limited to a specific industry or competency. High compensation maybe be an indicator, but is neither necessary nor sufficient. Outrageous fees are probably a better indicator, especially if they're persistent (clients wouldn't continue to pay $0.5M/month for EM+2 if it wasn't worth it right?).

What you've learned hasn't fallen away, it's more that what most people learn in university is mainly useless in work - but that affects everyone equally.  You wont find many work environments that don't frequently measure performance and review what their people do, so this is going to be a fact of life which you need to learn to deal with.  If you're worried about failure, just ask for help. Nobody wants to see their junior team members fucking up. I'd rather spend 15min showing someone who asked for help how to do something right than wait a week and realise they had no idea what they are doing - and I think most managers will be the same.

I now expect failure and often find it.   This is the part that worries me the most here.  Some here have said that it gets better and that is true in the sense that the work gets more interesting and your responsibilities become more impactful.  On the other hand, many of the things you are describing actually get worse over time; the deadlines get tighter, the fire drills get more frequent, the cost of failure gets higher and the review cycles get more stringent.  We all burn out after a time and have to pull back to recharge.  The issue is that it typically happens after 2-3 years, not at 9 months.  If you are really feeling this way, you may want to have a serious conversation with someone you trust that the firm about whether or not this is the right career for you.

The opportunity cost of these people's time is probably much higher than the amount you could put in your gift cards, so in a sense it can be kind of insulting. A consultant is billed to clients at $500-2000/day, so a few tens of dollars in a gift card is laughable in that regard. It can look like you're trying to ""buy"" them, or get out of a moral debt toward them.  It's much better to go for an actual gift, with a less direct value, such as buying them dinner. You're not implying it's the exact value of their help, you're just returning their niceness.

consulting,3b2286,minhthemaster,3,Thu Jun 25 15:12:28 2015 UTC,"Usually when a client is asking you to look at their change management process, it's generally because either:  1) the process has been overengineered leading to too many change controls and slow approval usually leading to a lot of emergency changes to skirt the system  2) the process is too loose or not followed allowing unauthorized changes to be snuck into the system with no consequence to the instigating party  Change management is one of those areas where executive/ managerial sponsorship makes or break the execution of the process. And that sponsorship lies with the CAB and how they want to streamline the process and what they want to enforce.

Those clients will test for everything that you can test for - yes, even weed.  Its rare - I have never been tested in my entire career - but that is just luck of the draw.  If you get staffed on one of those, it is a very awkward conversation to explain why you can't take the drug test.  My advice would be to go on a full detox and hope that you don't get staffed on a project that requires testing during that time."

Rent is ridiculous over there too so my friends (and people there in general) share houses (which sort of helps with rent).   If you're gonna do long-distance relationship (which I did before), look into round trip costs and stuff.

It's a young liberal city that is centrally located; it's also a United Hub (I believe). Do you want a big city? Try Chicago; it's not super cheap but cheaper than NYC/SF.  I think the main factor is going to be what you want to get out of the city you choose. I would stay away from the south (except maybe Atlanta, although it gets ridiculously hot/humid), but that's just my preference.  Stay far, far away from STL. Austin is cool and although it's not cheap (I wouldn't call it expensive either, but I live in NYC), like anywhere you are going to have to pay a little bit of a premium to live somewhere cool.

Nobody is flocking to STL - that could make it hard to make friends (as if being on the road 4 days a week isn't hard enough). I think you are on the right track with Austin.  Like most people are saying, if warm weather is a priority ATL could be a decent choice. There are places/neighborhoods where young people congregate. Just be prepared for the humidity.   Last thing. Are your projects going to be all over the US, or regional based on where you live? That could open you up to a place like San Diego if you will be working regionally.

I may not know this half of what you are looking for, but I know the other half.    If you want to build a specialty then I would let it be known to your group – your HR person, your supervisors, career mentor, etc.  And keep an eye out in the staffing reports and an ear out for word of mouth.  Find the role early and you can usually do a smooth enough transition to the thing you want.  Once in there, it gets easier.  As for the downside to specialty...maybe that specialty I picked dries up or the Partner/Managing Director I get super close leaves the company.

Their technology stacks are ancient even by FS standards which makes them pretty odd places to do technical work sometimes.   Anything specific you'd like to know?
consulting,3ar4yn,anonypanda,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:32:47 2015 UTC,I'm curious about the insurance specific teams.

consulting,3ar4yn,anonypanda,3,Tue Jun 23 00:33:09 2015 UTC,"Insurance companies, like most other FS firms buy very little strategy consulting. They will however buy a lot of actuaries to develop new products or (mathematically) pilot new business models.  The mix of services depends on what kind of relationship the partners have. There'll likely be a fair bit of regulatory work to do, many are still struggling with the basics of solvency2 let alone the stuff that's on the horizon.   Work depends hugely on the firm. Many of them are starting to look at how to turn their business ""digital"" and reach more mobile consumers who can shop around easier. The traditional insurance contact model of selling a policy then having no customer contact until renewal or claim is hardly fit for purpose in the 21st century. Most of the thought work in the industry is around this theme."

That being said you could try doing some pro-bono non profit consulting. Usually there are student organizations that do this - and from there try and network into a true consulting firm. At a firm, non-profit consulting isn't big bucks and as such usually isn't an entire service line. I did work for one non-profit back in the day and it was much like any other client.   History degree is a hard sell and unfortunately ""the lack of any quantitative and qualitative analysis coursework or professional experience"", as you put it is really difficult to overcome. There is no reason why a firm may hire you over a business or technical graduate.  Don't pursue an MA in history unless you want to do academia. An MBA is useless without usually 3 years of professional experience.  My recommendation is get a fortunate 500 position if you can, network, MBA and then try and enter consulting. That sounds pretty daunting but maybe there are some other options you can explore."

The reason I'm looking into non profit consulting is because I'd love to work for a non profit...but I strongly dislike many of the non technical roles available (Fundraising..or menial tasks and fundraising...or managing volunteers and fundraising).

You'd be called in to organize their documentation, onboard individuals, or maintain a technical asset or something of equal level. Not much is trusted to first year analysts. Your job is literally not to vomit on the client.  If you want those sorts of roles in a non-profit the best way is to make it to a senior managerial position in consulting and then laterally move. Or... start from the bottom on a non-profit. It is tough to hate a business' bread and butter and want to work for them. The planning and analysis really comes in after you've done a few years and understand what it is consultants do and how to deliver.  I enjoyed working for my non-profit clients in the past, I truly did but there are some real dead weights that are frustrating to work with.

You're not applying to State.    2) I have the opportunity to work in the US for much more than a Lebanese citizen can in Lebanon. In Lebanon for someone with a BA degree the monthly salary would be 850$ , but in the US I could easily make 2500-3000$ a month. So... Do I get 2500$ + Danger pay (25%) + Payment for a US citizen working outside the US ?   If you're applying for a job in Lebanon, be prepared to get a job offer aimed at a Lebanese standard of living, because you're competing against other Lebanese for the position. Nobody gives a donkey dick what you ""could"" be making in the states.    3) I have no house or cars in Lebanon (Neither do I in the US).

Am I wrong ?   2) I am applying for a Job in Lebanon, but they really want a US Citizen. half the employees of Booz allen have top secret clearance and 99% of it's income is from the federal government. so my question is , why do they not care what ""I could be making"" in the US , if they want to persuade me to take the job. I was also told from the inside they Do pay higher wages for US citizens so I know that for a fact.   3) I am not applying for the money I will receive, i am trying to figure out what a fair deal on my side would be.

consulting,3anc84,Crash_Coredump,3,Mon Jun 22 17:04:21 2015 UTC,"Depends on if you are hired on local or expat terms. Based on what you've described here, it sounds you are being hired on Local (Lebanese) terms, so it's unlikely you'll get more.  Simply by virtue of being American you aren't suddenly more valuable to a company (even a big name company). Generally, you can keep your US/EU pay package if you are sent by your employer to another country as an expat and are therefore not on a local contract. When you are sent as an expat you are still subject to your original contract + an extra supplement relating to living on the new country. Usually the supplement specifies things like relocation budget or ""hardship"" pay or whatever.   However if you are being hired directly by local partners in that country then you are almost 100% certainly going to be hired under local terms and conditions and can therefore expect local pay levels - especially since you have a local passport!"

Depending on the firm, local wages can be shitty, or more standardized across the globe.  Corporate HR is wise to the fact that you don't need to pay an expat package to a citizen of Lebanon to convince him/her to move to Lebanon.  If you reach a level where a company is willing to move you to Lebanon on a US wage, don't reveal your Lebanese passport until the ink is dry on the employment contract."

consulting,3aflv5,minhthemaster,6,Sat Jun 20 14:54:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like you are too stuck in the cookie cutter way of doing cases. The first two steps of this cookie cutter method are:  1) interviewer poses question 2) repeat question back  For any case, interviewer or interviewee led, you want to clarify if you don't understand something, but just repeating it back verbatim has got to annoy the hell out of an interviewer. Think about being the interviewer: wouldn't you be annoyed if several people that day just repeated the question back to you verbatim?  Personally, I think step 2 would be better phrased as clarify and contextualize. Clarify generally means defining things: the CEO thinks the business could be performing better -> define ""performing better"". Contextualize, I think, gets you more points: Hotel chain with branches in Bolivia and Finland is struggling with costs -> before we jump in, what is the story behind having branches only in two countries so separated geographically. I find that most of the time these contextualizing questions turn out to be important to solving the case, but more importantly, they can show the interviewer that you are thinking about this case and not regurgitating a framework.  For interviewer-led cases, where you get little questions, much of this clairify/contextualize step is probably not necessary, and repeating verbatim, as you point out, sounds especially dumb. However, you still absolutely need to be structured. If the question is, ""who are the stakeholders"", don't rattle off a list. Your response should probably be something along the lines of: the stakeholders are all going to fall into three categories.... x, y, and z. These can each be broken down into x1, x2, x3, y1, y2... etc. A list sounds like something you can always add more to. Categories can appear like you've really thought of everything, which is what you want your interviewer to think. Then, in these interviewer-led cases, its very important to end with something like: of these categories, I expect x2 to have the largest impact on the project/client because ___, so that's where I'd like to look further. Again, this shows the interviewer that if this were a real case, you'd have it covered. Sitting quietly with a face that says, next question please, is not a way to demonstrate that you can work at an appropriately autonomous level."
consulting,3aflv5,aqent_smith,2,Sat Jun 20 16:08:48 2015 UTC,"To add on to these... basically verbalize your thought process on how you're determining your answer. Practice doing this beforehand so it doesn't seem like your thought process is scatterbrained.   If you haven't realized it, it's more useful for the interviewer to understand that you have the capacity to analyze the question for better understand it rather than you giving a concrete response without the supporting reasoning."
consulting,3aflv5,vercing3torix,2,Sat Jun 20 22:41:26 2015 UTC,"First I'll start off by saying wow, that was quite the ramble.  Second, I would recommend when answering a multi question style case, to try to use a ""mini"" framework or structure within each question. For example, if one of the questions is about revenues, breaking it out into units, cost per unit etc. etc. Being able to scratch down a quick gameplan before answering a questioning or brainstorming helps your interviewer follow along with your thinking.  I doubt you will encounter redundant questioning. Firms typically are not in the business of wasting time and asking you things that are pointless.  Every question will be purposeful, and oftentimes a question that seems redundant has some connections to another part of the case. (Ex. stakeholders are all family members, information which could have considerations if you're looking to sell the business or fire senior management)  Last, I don't think you would be so frantic in your line of questioning if you had a substantial amount of cases under your belt before your interview.  Interviewer lead or interviewee led, most cases are similar and follow similar structure.  Having practice in one will prepare you for the others."

The brand recognition got me an automatic pass to any appropriate industry role I applied for. When I thought about doing a start-up VCs would talk to me primarily because of BCG on my LinkedIn. In the industry role I took people would assume competence because of where I had worked previously. When I wanted to return to consulting doors opened for me like magic.  There is a big degree of variation within the mid-tier. Places like Oliver Wyman, Roland Berger, LEK (and a few others) carry almost the same brand cache as MBB. Within some industries they may even be better regarded.  Deloitte and other large firms suffer from their size. There are some excellent consultants (and people know this), but there are lots of 'okay at best' consultants as well. You need to prove you are one of the stars.  You will have to work a little harder to get the same opportunities as MBB.

Is he your peer just in terms of position/title or is he also within a similar age range (i.e. it'd be different if you're 23 and he's 33)?  Regardless if he's your peer or subordinate, you should still be able to (and should, whether positive or negative) provide feedback. Maybe he had an off day or was super busy with other things but didn't want to let you down.  I'd approach it by asking him if everything's alright the next time you see him...to which you'll either get the reply ""yeah, why?"" or you'll find out that there's an issue. If the latter, you know it's a one-time issue and can show him you recognized when something was off and maybe offer him assistance with his stuff. If it's the former, you can just be blunt without being condescending/degrading: ""Well I was just wondering because of the slides you sent me last night...I mean for one the client name wasn't even correct.""  That should jumpstart the convo. Just be careful about the way you word things and always make sure to include some positives of the work or at least end things on a positive note (i.e. ""I know you don't usually submit stuff like this but I was just on a tough deadline and was depending on you...just let me know next time if I ask for help, if you really can't do it I understand and I'll work something else out."")  In the worst case scenario you definitely don't want to make an enemy out of someone on your team. If he gives you a ton of pushback upfront, back off and mend things quickly. You can either talk privately to a superior on your team about it or just let it go and not rely on this guy for things in the future.

But picking Netflix specifically as a target for throttling, rather than some more neutral measure, would seem to be a fairly difficult choice to defend if the FCC did decide to look into it.  I doubt very much that as a matter of corporate policy, Marriott would decide to go there.  The FCC enforcement action (bigass fine) that a lot of people are referring to isn't about internet access though, it was about Marriott using a WiFi blocking system to prevent people from using their own cellular hotspots in a convention center.  That fell squarely in the FCC's purview because it was preventing people from using the cellular-data service that they had paid for; it wasn't a net neutrality issue as much as it was a don't-fuck-around-with-the-radio-spectrum interference issue."

My guess is that they do have some sort of really aggressive connection shaping crap running, and it sees your Netflix connection as a really big download and throttles you accordingly.  (And does so in a stupid way.)  My guess is that if you used Hulu or Amazon Prime or some other service, it'd probably do the same thing, but that'd be an interesting test if you haven't done it already.  If this is a hotel that you're going to be at a lot, I'd complain a few times to a few different people (don't complain to the same person over and over, mention it to a bunch of different people, you have better luck of the message getting passed on that way).  They might be able to get someone to reconfigure the offending appliance, but it'll probably take months.  You could also ask Marriott corporate if they have a Netflix-throttling policy (which, of course, they won't, and after their FCC fine I'm sure they'll be pretty clear about it) and then see if you can get them to push the franchisee who owns the particular hotel to fix their shit, but again it'll probably take a long time to have anything happen.

I think you need to consider everything in context. Talking about interactions between you and your colleagues is probably fine, but as others have mentioned, talking about items that may be considered sensitive could be problematic.   For most people, the level of standard daily corporate minutia is such that it would hardly be interesting enough for others to care about.   However there are plenty of ""standard"" corporate activity that could be an issue in matters of sensitivity, Intellectual Property, and fiscal impact. From product launches, to new marketing campaigns, from acquisitions to divestitures, tender submissions, and management changes. This is prior to those that are then highlighted above these scenarios such as Non-Disclosure Agreements. All of these scale up to far more serious business when working with arenas where clearance levels are concerned - especially in dealing with the government and military sectors.  Essentially, when thinking about any work based content you wish to share, it's best to ask yourself two questions -  * Would I be comfortable sharing this information if they were not my SO or relation? * Would someone overhearing this conversation gain [commercially] sensitive information they wouldn't normally be exposed to?"

consulting,3a2yg1,MakeItWayne,5,Tue Jun 16 20:35:39 2015 UTC,"Since I started consulting in the late '80s/Early 90s, I've moved around in area of expertise a few times, Here's my story.  When I started out, I was an Access/personal database consultant. Developing database solutions for companies in Access/dBase/Clipper etc... The old personal databases of that time. I then got a chance to learn a new language/database called Pick. It had a PC counterpart called Revelation (and a later version called Advanced Revelation) so I added that to my tool box and wound up in a couple of full time and consulting jobs doing development in Pick/Revelation/AREV.  Then I moved to VB6/Acess development for a few years and made my biggest jump at the time to SAP and SAP BW consulting. This kept me flying around the country for about 8 years doing implementations for various clients.  I then decided it was time for a major change and joined KPMG as an I.T. Audit Senior. I did this for a couple of years, but it never felt right for me. I was a database/Business Intelligence developer (I really took to SAP's Business warehouse product). But I was noticing a dearth of local SAP BW based openings. So I took a couple of  FT jobs that gave me the opportunity to learn and use the Microsoft BI stack.   So I made the jump back to BI consultant (where I've been very busy for the last three years).  So yes you can do it. Joining a big firm like KPMG, Delloitte etc... is a good way to learn new technologies/areas for free.  I'v e done it and found it very worthwhile."

So there is ample opportunity to branch out. What drives me (and many other consultants I know) is the opportunity to learn new things be it business process, technology, areas of the business, etc...  Since you're currently doing EMR, are you involved with pre-sales, configuration, support? If you do config and implementation, ask to go on pre-sales calls, this will give you a good idea of what the sales guys are doing and how they are setting up customer expectations for the product/service you're company is providing. When I was involved in pre-sales config for SAP, it really opened my eyes and gave me insight into why some of our customers were unhappy with the implementations.   Look to try and learn the base technologies behind the scenes of the product be it Oracle/Informix/MS SQL etc... See if your boss wil let you take some classes so you can better understand serve your clients better.  Then leverage what you've learned to move up or transfer to another company. Rinse Repeat Profit...  Good luck."

Usually that's about a year or so.  That's great insight about speaking with sales guys and listening to some of those items I'm not involved in. I'd love to hear what a potential client is saying during those talks and what goes into the contract phase. I've never really thought of it from this angle so thank you for that.

What it will help you with is winning investor confidence come fundraising time (which, unless you a. are independently wealthy b. have a very strong friends and family network or c. one of the very, very, very few start-ups that explodes, you will need). There are literally hundreds of start ups run by 22 year olds that can show the hockey-stick user growth, good return rates, etc. etc. etc. that don't get the funding they ask for because angel investing is a high risk business.

As you noted, most management consulting clients are very mature organizations--most are over $1B in revenue and have been around for decades if not centuries. The problems you will be solving are often quite different from those faced by start-ups.   Consulting is also not a particularly innovative profession. It involves the application of tried and true business maxims and strategies. The value proposition of many consultancies is that ""we've solved this problem 100 times before and can do it for you, too."" Some of the core ideas are over 50 years old.  You should look into learning to code before you go the MC route."

You will build a great network of people in high positions at different companies. If you plan on starting a b2b startup you already have potential leads.   A good idea is one that solves an existing problem, what better field to be in than consulting to learn about the problems in different industries. You get to learn about different markets, industries and business model and apply best practices. It also helps when raising money with investors. Investors focus more on the team than the idea and have a solid consulting experience is always a plus.  You also need to consider if you want to be a technical co-founder or a business co-founder. If you want the latter, MC is a good choice."

consulting,3a3k3j,JJR5330,0,Wed Jun 17 00:46:18 2015 UTC,I think your best bet is just starting something on your own. When looking at many successful entrepreneurs most don't have any significant experience rather they just had the drive and ambition to stop at nothing to get their venture off the ground. Your in a good spot you're a sophomore in college probably living on your parents dime. Might be a good time to start something small whatever it may be and learn from that and just take what you've learned from that to the next level. It may also be beneficial to partner with someone who has experience and be a mentor of sorts. There is no secret sauce to entrepreneurship and although some may disagree a bit of luck comes into play as well. My advice to you is to not attack the red shiny ball of apps such as Instagram Facebook etc. Cater towards niche markets that nobody thinks about. That's where the real easy money is. And if you're doing it just for money then entrepreneurship probably isn't your thing as you'll find yourself working long hours and going through many trials and tribulations before you're successful. Also people think being an entrepreneur means you can be your own boss which isn't quite right. Your boss is now your customer base and customers can be a handful. Anyways good luck! :)
consulting,3a3k3j,tergiversator,6,Wed Jun 17 00:44:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but most of this is not really good advice. Saying that experience doesn't matter and telling someone just to start something, especially if that person is specifically interested in tech is just plain wrong and extensive research tells us otherwise.   Experience matters. Training matters. Network matters. Sure, ideas matter but so does timing and execution. Industry experience, network, management and leadership experience are all important factors in startup success and survival rates.   To the original poster: MC wouldn't be bad, especially if it gets you the right experience, contacts, etc. But it really depends. Big tech experience in a firm that will train you well and give you a network of contacts (Google, FB, Intel, whatever, depending on your preferences and interests) might be even better. Hope that helps."

It all depends on how you deal with your notes once they are taken.

Add-on to that the fact that the duration of your studies may be a few months at most, sometimes even only a few weeks, you might have several confidential notes in your notepad companion.

So the best short answer I have been able to build is this:  I'm an opportunity junkie.  I love seeking the opportunity to just do something that I am not presently doing.  I'm not terribly interested in doing it once there but I want to find it.  Sure I'll get things done, I'm never worried about execution but it's mundane.  I am in a different client's office generally twice a week (NYC and SLC this week) and the one prevailing thought I have for every company I have ever done business with is ""oh my, you have to come here every day?""  The pace of industry is really never enough to satisfy my want for the next thing, no matter what it is."

consulting,39zy57,Ansuz07,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:24:19 2015 UTC,It sounds like you have a decent HC resume.  So long as HA takes entry level consultants (not all boutiques do) then you should have a decent shot at getting a job there.  The only real question to answer is - do you want to do healthcare for your career?

The only real question to answer is - do you want to do healthcare for your career?   lol dunno. That's one fear I have with pursuing a niche HC firm. The advantage to a company like DC or Accenture is that I would have the opportunity to work in different industries before I'm pigeon-holed into something

Unless you are sure that you want to do HC, then you should look for a more diverse firm.  Sure, there will be exit opportunities from HA, but they will all be HC related.  You can always re-apply to them in a few years if you do decide that HC is where you want to go."

consulting,39xuie,Charlotte2NYC,6,Mon Jun 15 18:02:13 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would not reach out to headhunters.  Unless they are firm specific, they are less concerned about finding good role for you and more concerned with getting you placed anywhere so they can get their cut.  LinkedIn is your friend - find people you know that work at the firms you are interested in and ask them if they know people in the NYC office you can talk to.  Get a few phone calls set up and go from there."
consulting,39xuie,Ansuz07,2,Mon Jun 15 18:22:42 2015 UTC,"This is good advice, with the proviso that a lot of headhunters DO have an interest in finding a good fit between candidate and role IF they expect repeat business with their clients.  That is, if they want to maintain a good relationship with their client then they aren't going to want to shove any old sod into the role if they're just going to leave after a year. Also, it's not unheard of for compensation to be structured in such a way so as to incentivise finding candidates who will stick with it for the longer term.  That said, you if you will always know better what kind of role is right for you, so take Ansuz07's advice and reach out to contacts in the first instance."

consulting,39ydgn,throw20150615,2,Mon Jun 15 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"I don't believe from the numbers that I have seen that BCG hires the most PhDs.  McKinsey is about twice the size of BCG and during recruiting they said that about 35% of their consultants come from an APD background (PhD, MD, JD).    It should be possible to apply for a 2016 start date.  Advanced Degree Candidates usually have their own application deadline and track.  That April date might have been for another track. McKinsey's application deadline is usually around mid July, BCG's the end of July/beginning of August, and Bain's the beginning of Sept. It is worth a call to the recruiter because the dates seem to move up by a week or two every year.  Your first interview is usually a couple of weeks after the application deadline and you will need to practice for the consulting interviews (case studies and the PST).  You should seek out the consulting club on campus for help with your CV.  Some companies accept a CV and some want a resume but they are all looking for very different things than your academic jobs were.  To answer your other questions.  Your age shouldn't be a big factor.  I successfully navigated the same process last year and am 5 years older than you are.  You should mention your start up/business experience.  Interviewers seem to like that I had tried my hand at entrepreneurship.   The MBBs all hire PhDs, McKinsey, BCG and Bain.  There are definitely some others out there like LEK and Oliver Wymen that hire PhDs but they didn't recruit at my campus like the MBBs did so there was a lot less information to help navigate the application process."

consulting,39ydgn,Brandon432,2,Wed Jun 17 13:27:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry this is a late response.  There isn't a single book that I used.  I bought one, Case in Point, and checked one, Crack the Case, out from the library.  I skimmed through the Crack the Case and never opened Case in Point.  Almost any case study book will give you the same advice (develop a framework you are comfortable with, ""drive the case"", etc) and a handful of very similar canned frameworks to get you started with.    I started reading the advice in those books but a lot of it didn't correspond with what I was hearing in the interview, e.g. the books said each interviewer will only be able to pass on one or two candidates to the next round while everyone from the companies was saying they wanted to hire as many candidates as met the standard.  I ended up focusing on the example cases in the back of the book, seeing how the author implemented the frameworks or working a case and then check my framework against a stock solution.  The book exercises were a good first step but I also worked a 10 to 20 cases with a partner from the school consulting club.  These were much more helpful in developing my case style than reading out of a book.  Essentially once I got to the interviews, I had a framework that I liked using and could apply to almost any case and I was very comfortable doing the back of the envelope calculations in my head.  I haven't yet sat in the other chair so I can't tell you why I was successful.  The only word of warning I will give you is that McKinsey's interview style is ever so slightly different than Bain and BCG.  McKinsey uses an ""interviewer lead"" style where the interviewer doles out the information a piece at a time and then you discuss the information that they just presented and the case.  BCG and Bain use an ""interviewee lead"" style where you are expected to always be asking for the next piece of information you need to take the next step in the case.  It can be difficult because you will interview with McKinsey once or twice before your first interview with Bain or BCG so you can fall into the habit of waiting for the interviewer to led."

BCG tends to have a more academic working style so might be a better fit?  Closing dates for applications are when the selection process starts, so it is hard to apply afterwards. That said, business is booming this year so off-cycle recruitment or a second set of interviews might be happening in some offices. Worth asking some recruiters at least.  For a PhD applicant age + startup experience are both positives. We're looking for mature and smart people with a mix of academic and commercial experience."

Salary is the only really quantifiable dimension you listed; when you ask which track has ""better"" exit opportunities do you mean the most senior positions?  Or the highest likelihood of receiving specific positions?  What constitutes the ""best"" skills for you?  How are you measuring prestige?  At the end of the day, ""better"" or ""best"" is going to be defined by the work you want to be doing and the life that you want to have.  You could take an opportunity in strategy, become a VP in 5-10 years, have excellent leadership/management skills, clear mid-six figures, and be well-regarded within your professional community, but if you hate what you're doing, is that really the best outcome?  If you're a world-renowned analytics expert but people don't recognize the name of your firm, is that considered less prestigious?

consulting,39x3kq,mercury_hermes,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:11:15 2015 UTC,"This may not be exactly what you want, but the line:   defense most likely but wouldn't mind healthcare   Indicates to me that you are either very early in the process or potentially not in the actual application/hiring process at all (maybe a student)?  Someone who was already in industry wouldn't be so ambivalent.  That's fine.  It's great to think through your interests early on.  The advice I will give you is this - whatever it is you hypothetically end up doing in consulting (federal or otherwise), do the HELL out of that thing.  Do the hell out of your assignments from your manager/supervisor.  When other folks shut down and head out, get ahead on the next 10 items.  When you finish those, ask other people if you can help them out with something.  Learn everything you can.  Learn who is the best at what they do and (in a friendly way) learn how you can match or outpace them.  Make friends.  Make friends with your team, with your boss, even with your clients.  Be that person - the person who people start reaching out to on completely unrelated issues because they know you are smart, eager, and capable.  Be the person everyone likes to be around because you are a clear thinker, you are respectful but assertive, you are always viewed positively.  Why are these things important?  Because your future-future employer who is thinking, ""Wow, this person has transferable, future-relevant skills, and I want him/her over other candidates"" - he/she is not thinking that because of some abstract and virtually uninformed decision you made on MC/IT/Tech several years prior.  He/she is making that decision because you are a candidate that walked into the room and just exploded with demonstrated performance and potential.  Because you had an incredible resume and even better references.  Because you fucking stood and delivered and then saved orphans on the weekend.  Be EXCELLENT, pick something that excites you (that you will just throw yourself into for a few years), and stop worrying about this otherwise trivial decision.  Tl;dr - stop worrying about the MC/IT/Tech decision; it isn't the primary driver for the results you're looking for.  Be the best and the rest will come naturally."

consulting,39x8jc,Ansuz07,5,Mon Jun 15 15:29:48 2015 UTC,"Again, the best answer is the actual set of reasons that you want to be an analyst rather than a lawyer.  People in consulting jump ship all the time - to other firms, to industry, to other careers.  Its something we factor into hiring decisions; when I hire an analyst I expect to get 2-3 years out of them before they leave.  As long as your reasons for Consulting over Law are solid, they employer won't worry too much about you jumping ship before you are expected too."

If its the former, then just tell me the actual reasons - a candid, passionate response is pretty clear to those of us who have been interviewing for a while.

Basically I'm trying to work out the best narrative/spin to put on the answer to the question.

I must've been in need of some tea, for I now see that your true problem is how to convince those interviewers, if you can, that it is they who are worthy of your talents and pedigree.   ""A master linguist, at our firm?"" the interviewer will muse out loud. ""But why would such an individual lower themselves in such a way? Consulting is an honorable role, but surely this man or woman has a hundred law firms at their feet.""   And oh the scandal! As Mummy and Pater are lunching at Lord and Lady Blackwater's summer home in Cardiff their cheeks will blush as they admit that their beloved has spurned (if only for a time) the grandeur of the practice of law, only to blend into the merchant class, to attempt to solve the banal problems of a commoner's business. ""Why the years at Westingshire? Why the fencing lessons?"" Mummy will quietly sob, as Pater gathers her into the waiting car.

I don't see how people interpreted this as arrogant or manipulative. Consulting is super competitive, but the legal market is doing a lot worse than consulting is at the moment. On top of that I'd have to do another year at school, which I don't think I can hack again while working part-time to fund it.   I am quite keen on both or either careers, so I'm pursuing both.

They aren't completely different companies but their recruiting structures are completely separate and even the head recruiter for your college can't promise you a job in another service line any more than they can promise you a job at another firm.   There's no way to sneak around the process without networking though. Your only other option is to apply directly for Advisory positions. A lot of people think that you can take an audit job solely for the purpose of transitioning into Advisory or consulting positions at that firm. It's not impossible or overly difficult to do so but it does take more time than applying directly for those positions. If you do want to start in Audit, the best way to transfer is to position yourself as a top performer. This will give you the leverage you want to be able to transfer to another service line internally or seek out a position at another firm."
consulting,39tva7,JoeClarksville,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:31:26 2015 UTC,Thank you for your detailed response. One follow-up question I meant to ask initially - is an accounting background without any other minor or concentration going to hinder me if I want to pursue a MC position? What types of educational backgrounds do those pursuing positions coming out of undergrad or similar non-mba positions?
consulting,39tva7,JoeClarksville,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:57:42 2015 UTC,"No problem!  My background is actually accounting as well. I got my CPA first before starting in Big 4 consulting. Based on my observation, there are a variety of different majors which depend on the schools where your office recruits at. Mine recruited at a number of state universities with solid business programs so we had a good mix of MIS/CIS, accounting, and finance majors. Another office that supported us recruited a lot from the Ivy League schools like Cornell so you saw a higher proportion of liberal arts degrees like History, economics, and political science. As you hinted, the MBA does wipe the slate clean as far as your background goes that could be an option later in life if you feel like your current opportunities are unsatisfactory.   Rereading your post, keep in mind that you don't have to accept your audit full-time offer. Since you're going back for your MSA, you have the opportunity to do a whole second round of applying for full-time positions through the on-campus recruiting system. One of my good friends from college did something similar; he interned at Ernst & Young in audit in the summer between his senior year and his MSA year and hated it, so he declined their offer and continued interviewing for other jobs while getting his MSA. He ended up landing an offer with Deloitte Consulting during the fall of his grad year and accepted that. Nothing's set in stone, especially not this early in your career."

In my firm, people have to decline the audit position and go through the whole interview/case interview process with consulting including the superday. Some get it; others don't get any offers. Treat it as a completely different firm. Take advantage of being in the same building as (hopefully) your future colleagues. In that sense, you're better off than other candidates. Don't underestimate Linkedin. You can find alumni who were in your same position during college and jumped to consulting. They're the ones who can help you."

If your partners have no idea who you are they are fairly unlikely to promote you no matter what your performance is. If you're stuck on some far off project a million km away though, don't despair. Those opportunities that you DO get to meet your leadership really count - which is why I tell my counselees that they should consider drinks and other informal social stuff after work as part of their job. This is fundamentally a business of relationships, and you need to be creating those relationships everywhere you go ...but please discard everything you've read in every book on 'networking'. Just make friends and accept not everyone will love you.  As you become more senior sales start to be the #1 reason you move up in the world. But sales come from relationships and mostly from those relationships you built when you were more junior. Start cultivating non-work relationships with your clients. I mean actually get to know them and become friends with some of them. Probably 80% of what I've ever sold was not through some tendering process, but rather to people who knew me and trusted me to be able to build a team to deliver what they wanted. It helped that we occasionally went out for drinks or happened to meet up at the same conferences."

I volunteered and organized events such as BBQ's and parties for my local office I hosted various trainings for my firm in my area of expertise    With these actions, I was able to meet many senior managers/MDs and they got to know who I am.

consulting,39r0th,ghstw,2,Sun Jun 14 00:11:39 2015 UTC,"I think these are all good points.  It's interesting to see how much advice in this thread is about visibility, networking, relationship development, etc. - all of which is incredibly important.  Something I see a lot of, which isn't necessarily discussed as much, is the fact that anyone can learn how to network and get better visibility - but turning networking into real relationships takes additional skills:   Empathy: you actually have to know and understand what the other person cares about in order to make a real connection with them. Maturity: understanding social basics (how to start, hold, and leave a conversation; knowing the right levels and forms of self-introduction) and more skillful relationship building (steering discussion, hosting/navigating groups, tracking conversations and topics over time, keeping in touch with old contacts). Ability: this is covered in folks' comments on knowing your shit, but the key is that the people you connect with (internal or external) should develop the belief that you have valuable knowledge/experience, and/or can get the job done.   It's not to say that this isn't implied or touched on in many of the other comments, just something worth noting.  I see a lot of junior resources, especially at office/team events, who just cruise the whole event trying to meet as many senior people as they can, essentially using canned material, and awkwardly moving on.  They leave feeling like they've done a great job networking, but in reality they've only made the most superficial possible connection.  Tl;dr - visibility and networking are meaningless unless you have the tools to do something more substantial with that exposure."

Many times issues will come up in conversation with the client that aren't related to your area but if you are able to identify those, and you have a working relationship with someone in another practice area, you can let that other team know of a sales opportunity they may not have otherwise known about; that practice group will do the same for you.  You're also displaying to the client that you're taking care of them on a wholistic basis. This is invaluable to the the firm AND the client as it allows you to provide services on a unified front, leading to the best possible outcome. They feel like you are taking care of them, which is huge.   Additionally, knowing those in other practice areas can lead to special/unique projects that may require teaming up with other practice areas. They may be few and far between, but special projects have incredible visibility within the firm and put you on a  totally different level than all of your peers.   In terms of visibility within your team, make sure you communicate to your manager what it is exactly you are working on if (s)he is too high level to see it.  A lot of the time people assume we know all the great things they have done, but we have no idea simply because we're not in the weeds.  Back in the day, I used to do a quick log at the end of the week for myself of any out of the ordinary items I worked on.  This will also come in handy when it comes time for self reviews.  LASTLY, and most importantly....YOU NEED TO KNOW YOUR SHIT and perfect it. So many people waste their time with all this networking shit and suck at doing the actual work/don't fully grasp it. They think that since what they are doing is low level totem pole work it's not that important/they are above it.  They want to move on to ""bigger"" things, so start trying to work on all sorts of other BS or waste time networking instead of perfecting.  It is going to come back and bite you in the ass down the line. HARD.   No director gets to that position without knowing his shit first. You can't BS your way around project scoping and sales when you aren't a subject matter expert. (Well you can...but the project is likely to be a failure)"

Unfortunately visibility and mediocre quality work looks awful. It's rather skewing.  For a promotion, especially at the junior levels, find one single sponsor who will help you through the process (and who is senior enough to influence). At more senior levels, you'll need more than one person! In my experience, in promotion meetings you need advocates, and you need to actively build those people into advocates not just rely on the fact that they think you're doing a good job and probably supportive."

When I asked him about the path people take to become partners, he gave feedback pretty similar to what you said. Sales and client management are musts, as well as having your advocates in the room as the discussions are intense.   He pointed out that the problem a lot of people have is that they think that if they do X and Y, they should be at Z in A years, when really the path to becoming a partner is pretty subjective in the sense that while sales and advocates are probably the top 2 considerations, there are other factors that come in to play (his opinion). Just like in life, timing can be everything and sometimes there are things that out there that we can't prepare for.  Basically, he said that the road to becoming a partner is made by walking. Be undeniable in your work, build genuine relationships with good people, don't shy away from taking risks (sometimes failure can be more valuable than success), be confident in yourself to recognize your strengths and limitations, and know that 90% of success is just showing up.  Also if you go out until 4AM, you are expected to be at work at the regular reporting time and on the ball. Under no circumstances are you to show up late and drag ass all day.   He died last month at 55. He was a pretty private guy; he'd shoot my questions down much more frequently than answer them.

consulting,39r0th,beer_warriors_ghost,9,Sat Jun 13 23:45:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not a partner but I'm an engagement manager, so maybe I can offer some insight.  Compared to being an analyst, my role is much more focussed on both big picture stuff and project admin. I spend quite a lot of time dealing with staffing, accounts, IT, KM, production etc. It's my job to ensure my projects are resourced and supported. I also spend more time in meetings. I attend almost every internal and external meeting regarding my project, and this takes up a lot of time.  I'm also responsible for shaping the format and content of our output. This role can vary a lot dependant on projects, but I like to work with fairly hands-off partners who are happy to leave me to crack the case. As long as I can control the messaging I try to delegate analysis and story to my team.  I also have a client relationship element to my role. This can vary from ensuring we work in a collaborative way on a day to day basis, to getting buy-in on the run up to important meetings, and thinking about how we can deepen our relationship and sell more work. The partner usually takes the lead on all of this when they are around.  If you want to start taking on more responsibility then the best place to start is with your own module. Instead of expecting to be told what to do, propose a workplan to your manager, sketch out your own storyboards, take responsibility for ensuring your work is always client ready and mistake-free.   An ideal analyst is one who can be trusted to produce great on-message content with minimal instruction.  There are also other things you can do. Getting involved in organising other ares (eg social stuff, training, recruiting) lets you show you can do the admin side of project management. There's also a political angle to getting promoted. Doing great work for the wrong partner is sometimes unrewarded."
consulting,39r0th,doctorbadidea,10,Sun Jun 14 09:51:56 2015 UTC,"For context, I'm a manager on the cusp of the next level managing 1 major project and 2 programs.  This is going to be long, but getting promoted in a hyper-competitive environment isn't a small thing.    For every group:     There's a lot of talk here about impressing partners, and while you want them to know you, the ability to make an impression on a partner as an Analyst is difficult so don't obsess over it.  They're likely looking big picture, while you're focused on a small detail.  Be tight, but succinct on your interactions with them.  Don't live and die with their interactions with you. Work closely and try to impress those 1-2 levels above you.  Your partner won't have much to say in the Analyst ranking call, your managers will. Keep this in mind as you move up, Consultants need the blessing of Managers and Sr. Managers, Managers need Sr. Managers / Principals and Partners and so on. Visibility is important.  Get involved in extra circulars be it People's Initiatives, account planning or new opportunities.  Just like your actual role, you need to be more of a leader as you progress. Alignment:  When you're getting promoted, you'll need the OK of your lead, Career Councilor and possibly client.  Make sure they all know your aspirations for this year.   Things we look for at any given level:     Note 1:  I can only go so far because of my career level. Note 2:  Assuming here that you've mastered the level below an can do the minimum required for your job, this is to get PROMOTED, not day to day delivery. Note 3:  I'm assuming titles, YMMV based on your firm.       Level 1 (Analyst --> Consultant / Associate Manager )     Thoroughness:  You check all the details of your work, and can speak in detail to the thing you've delivered.   If I've asked for a report on water, your analysis states that it's wet and I can drink it.  You tell me that it can turn into ice, and ask me if you want to expand into that space as well. Taking the next step:  I told you to speak to Mr. X about the water report.  He says there's an old analysis that may help.   Don't come to me with this info, try to find it yourself if you can. Not just problems, solutions:  Having an issue.  Don't just give me a problem statement, tell me what you think you should do.  That report is owned by an SVP, you come to me and say ""I don't feel comfortable going to that person, do you have a contact I can speak to, or should we speak to a Partner?""  It gives me more context, and shows you've thought through the issue.  This continues through the levels though with more depth at each stage.   Level 2 (Consultant / Associate Manager --> Manager)   Increasingly work on your own:  Fewer questions, more updates to you leadership. Own something:  Now instead of providing me a report on water, you own the ""What is water? Initiative.""  From a statement at the beginning to the answers at the end.  You plan the work and execute it with minimal supervision Lead a team:  You have staff whose work you direct and who you are responsible for (even if you're not doing their reviews)  They need to report into you.  Don't pass every one of their questions to your manager. Working outside your team:  You need help from another team, you need to work across towers to get them marching in step.   Level 3 (Manager --> Sr. Manager / Principal)     Big picture:  You own the Natural fluids program inclusive of H20, Oil, Aloe and Molten Lava. Directing Traffic:  Dealing with all areas of delivery; odds are you don't do much anymore.  You direct, instruct and work with multiple teams.  You're absorbing information, using your knowledge to move things forward. It's now your problem:  Most of your interactions are escalations, you need to be able to solve them and be seen as that person people come to for resolutions. Budget:  You may have seen it before, but now you need to budget.  How many resources are on your program, and how do you deliver within budget. Sales / Account growth:  Sales at this stage adding resources based on client sign off, or bringing in a Partner to help your client counterpart do ""X"".  You're leveraging your existing network, not starting a new one.   If you have specifics you want to ask, go ahead and best of luck to you all."

But since you are not much under time pressure take this opportunity to learn a useful skill. Go to the places those guys from those companies go to lunch or hang out after work. And then get in casual conversations with them. After you ran into them a few times ask them about their jobs. As soon as you find someone who does something that doesn't seem to bore you to death show an appropriate amount of enthusiasm for the subject. And then just ask if you could intern with them. If you are able to get an internship via that road you should have gained more valuable life and consulting relevant skills than all the interning in the world.

To each his own regarding working for Gov or not.  I find they are often slower and bigger and help me improve my patience and attention to detail.  Commercial projects are usually faster paced and less ‘caring’ about quality/feelings/anything.

Tell them you will help identify and train your backfill so it will be a seamless transition.  Give everyone plenty of advance notice so they can plan accordingly.  As others have noted, this is YOUR career and you are responsible for making things happen for YOU.  With that said, don’t be some douche that throws a temper tantrum and springs it all at the last minute.  Follow my advince and you should be golden.  Having your next role already lined up is a good idea because (a) HR doesn’t want some previously billable person sitting on the bench, (b) HR doesn’t want to add to their workload by now having to staff you, (c) it is easier to tell your boss you want to go to this new place rather than just saying you want to leave them, and (d) you care about your next role/location/etc. a whole lot more than HR cares about your next role/location/etc.  Or if you want to stay and get better roles than prove to your boss that you can deliver quality results with minimal oversight.  Gain the boss’s trust and they will give you more and more stuff and more and more important stuff.  Plus, they will spread the word to their bosses and peers.

In theory, you will know how to run your own projects with enough experience, which is a valuable skill.  Good planning, resource management, project financials - all important skills in consulting. Probably the most consistent way as a junior resource to get senior client exposure since you'll be around for major status meetings, steering committees, stakeholder updates, etc.   Cons:   The work is usually tedious, thankless, and extremely detail oriented. A lot of the job tends to be chasing people down and busting their balls for being behind.  People will not love you for this. You are unlikely to develop deep skills outside of pure project management - it's not impossible, but since your full-time job will be making sure the trains are running on time and sifting through rows after rows of tasks and deliverables, it's harder to get deep on a particular area of knowledge.   If you are really passionate about project/program management - which is being the person that knows a little about everything, but primarily about exactly where the project is and whether or not it's on track, on scope, on budget -   If you aren't, it's not the worst place in the world to start, but it's good to think about how you'll want to move on once you've punched your ticket."

Sometimes patients come and know that they have health problems: they complain about aches and pains and the doctor finds out what the problem is and prescribes the medicine. In the same way, consultants find out what exactly is plaguing the business and come up with solutions to cure them of the ailment.  Sometimes, however, people don't go to the doctor until it is too late and the damage is irreversible; in this case, it is probably better for the patient to go to a doctor when they feel that something is wrong but they can't put their finger on it. The doctor can discover potential issues that might blow up into big problems in the future. For businesses, this might be like the company looks profitable on paper but seems to always run short of cash.  In other cases, overweight people might have a goal to lose weight and go to a doctor to help achieve their goals by telling them what they're eating wrong, what habits need to be changed, and how to find the motivation to keep going with the regimen. These people have goals and go to professionals to help achieve their goals. For businesses, this might be faster processing, generating more profit, etc.  Hiring a bookkeeper is akin to having someone come over to take measurements like blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc. But they're not curing the ailment and you still need someone to properly act on those numbers."

One thing that helped me at least is to describe specific things that you have done for clients in the past. Obviously you can't name the client, but if you can say that you helped improve a POS system to increase revenues at a client by X% that might be clearer. Additionally, if you're pitching to businesses that you already know something about, hel  For example, that client who reached out to you is saying that they are having a hard time with their finance and accounting function of their business.

I like a regular Monday night spot because I'm too tired to think, so its usually salmon at the westin bar or another dish at a Mexican restaurant.  Tuesday Up at 5:30. Straight to hotel gym. Weights and conditioning till 6:30. Shower, shave, dress.  Leave at 7:30 latest. Client site for 8am. Initial hour of work (emails, checkin meet) 9am - 2 boiled eggs, an apple or banana and 20oz green tea. 12 (depending on meetings) - salad from client site or near by. Dinner - whatever I want. Wednesday - repeat Tuesday. Thursday - repeat Tuesday but dinner will be at home or on flight, I try to eat fish and salad. Friday - same breakfast. Lunch with team near office. Friday night and Saturday night I eat whatever. Try to be healthy during day. Sunday - an active outing (hiking, beach, soccer)  It takes discipline, especially if you want to network at night and drink beers and spirits like I do. But you have to try and keep your sanity.  Also - don't be afraid of ditching the team to crash early once a week, sleep is important.  Lastly as for exercise I do push, pull, legs days. 10 minutes running to warm up. Conditioning is hiit  or tabata style rower/kettlebell routine/bear complexes/cleans etc depending on how I feel."

Check out /r/bodyweightfitness for ideas if you want something beyond regular pushups and situps.  If you're in a client site where there's a grocery store (and your hotel room has a fridge), consider picking up stuff to eat that is marginally healthier than what you're going to get at the hotel or nearby.  I don't always do this, but it's better when I do.  Other than that it's really down to individual discipline - the biggest killer for me is drinking; I'm lousy about heading to the lobby bar/restaurant post-workout...start working and next thing you know you're a half-dozen drinks in, a huge plate of shitty pasta down, and it's 2 AM."

consulting,39h7nt,NumenSD,7,Fri Jun 12 02:21:50 2015 UTC,"As of right now, it's pretty clear that Reddit is not banning subs for content, as subs like /r/whiterights, /r/mensrights, /r/fatpeoplestories, /r/theredpill, /r/coontown, and /r/picsofdeadkids are still up and are arguably just as offensive.   If the goal is setting up an advertising platform, why leave subs that are more mainstream offensive (racism, sexism, photos of dead children) and attack something that most of the public would probably tolerate. You wouldn't get fired automatically for commenting on someone's weight, but you'd be out the door instantly for using the word coon or proclaiming your dislike of gold digging American bitches.   The reason for banning /r/fatpeoplehate is because the mods participated and encouraged the subscribers to harass people outside of the sub. A fat woman should be able to post a selfie to 2x without getting hundreds of hateful inbox replies from a totally different sub that linked to her post. In other subs where individuals are mocked, the photos are linked to imgur and the comments stay in the sub. The person being mocked is not bombarded with those hateful comments unless they go looking for them. While I find that still pretty distasteful, it's something I tolerate because I respect the freedom in Reddit's platform.  I think that the admins should probably crack down a bit more on the harassment--there are a lot more subs who are just as bad or worse than those five in regards to harassing individuals or forming downvote brigades. Roving packs of people like that are not contributing anything to the site.   And finally, something to remember."

consulting,39h7nt,Kazi1776,2,Thu Jun 11 23:34:32 2015 UTC,"The decision to start banning certain subreddits is a good idea in terms of risk. What happens if somebody gets bullied, moderators take part in it, and the victim commits suicide for example? Huge potential lawsuit whether or not they win it's still costly.  On the note of the new CEO though, she's made a handful of moves that seems unfavorable. Most notably banning the practice of salary negotiation for employees.   Part of what makes reddit is freedom of content people enjoy, but there's a certain point where the line needs to be drawn and this is a good start."
consulting,39h7nt,JoeClarksville,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:23:32 2015 UTC,"IIRC, banning salary negotiations was intended to give women a more level playing field as they are disadvantaged (or less successful historically) in salary negotiations.

Somehow they felt like it was their right to have access via Reddit to these stolen pictures.   I think a lot of people have a strange idea of rights and liberties.   Edit: Also I don't think it's a nail in the coffin. A lot of folks, including myself, curate subreddits so that our front page is not filled with a lot of the bullshit that goes on around reddit. If you use reddit for higher quality material, then I highly doubt the migration of these folks to Voat is going to have a noticeable effect."

I don't really look at other subreddits but I'm having a hard time believing that there is that much value in the subreddits you mention above.

consulting,39h7nt,Ansuz07,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:24:23 2015 UTC,"What you might call harassment, I might call spirited discourse.  Censoring subreddits (beyond ones that are engaging in illegal behavior) is a very quick way to kill the community.  As a user, if you don't like what is being said, best to just not go to the subreddit that is saying it.  Beyond the ideological, I just don't practically think it will work.  How many new fat people hate subreddits popped up in the wake of the censorship?  When those get banned, how many more will pop up?  How long do you want to play whack-a-mole before your arm gets tired?  There is also some merit in keeping offensive subs around, if for no other reason than to keep the jackasses contained in their own little pen.  I remember a season of the Wire where the captain of a precinct told the dealers that they wouldn't bust them so long as they sold drugs inside this 3 or 4 block area; sell outside of that and they will call down the thunder but inside they were safe.  It served to clean up the streets for everyone else in the neighborhood because you knew the dealers would only be in that one area.  Same logic for the subs - if you have a negatively based sub, let people say what they want inside it and call down the ban hammer if they venture out in to the rest of Reddit.  If you want hate speech, you know where to go and if you don't, you know where to avoid."

They're young and have no spendable income, and are useless to advertisers, yet they take up bandwidth and resources. I think reddit is happy to alienate them, and hopes they move to a different platform.  Are there people who will raise hell in solidarity? Will they also leave, in the name of free speech? Maybe. Maybe they will come back.  I think it's like the smoking bans at bars. I (a nonsmoker) was against the ban on a personal freedom level. But I didn't stop going to bars, most bars survived in the end, and damn if it isn't nice coming home not smelling like an ashtray every Saturday night."

My clients are within the city, so I commute to and from their offices daily instead of flying out and spending the week elsewhere. Your mileage may vary but the following might be useful.  Personally, location to me is incredibly important. If you have some time, spend some time in the city you would be relocating to. See if you enjoy it. Consulting will be your career, not your life - Will you need to travel far to spend your leisure time somewhere you enjoy? Will you have any friends or family around to visit? If not, are there opportunities to meet new people where you'll be relocating or are you not fond of the new area's residents? How will you be spending your weekends?  Not sure about the job landscape in Canada, but you might want to check if you have the ability to relocate to a city you'd prefer. Did they ask before offering you the position where you'd prefer to work? Were you honest? Or did you just say ""anywhere is fine""? If you said the latter, then you've done yourself a disservice - recruiters want you to be happy.  If you're willing to make the location sacrifice for the next year or two in hopes that you can relocate in the future, then go for it. But keep the above in mind. It may be in your best interest to talk to your recruiter though. They obviously want you for the position, asking for an alternative may pay off for you. Worst case they say it's not possible and you're in the same position as you are now."

Then, I start the horse trading with the maybe's to fill all my interview spots.  Networking may give you the bump you need to get one of those spots.

Those of us who are active in recruiting - aka the ones who ""influence the process"" make time to meet with candidates; after all, I have to have SOME way of differentiating the giant ""maybe"" pile.  We also communicate with our internal HR departments about which candidates we meet with and our impressions; those interactions are forwarded to the recruiting teams when decision making time comes.    TL;DR - We know when you are networking, We know who you are talking to. We know if you've been bad or good so be good for goodness sake.  On target majors are ones that are more focused on whatever type of consultant you want to be:  finance - finance/economics degree; supply chain - logistics degree; life sciences - biology degree.  Those are the ones that will really help.  Now, can you do well as a consultant without such a degree?  Sure you can - my undergrad is in Psychology.  Same way you could be a good doctor and get into med school without a B.S. degree.  Doesn't mean its easy and it doesn't mean that you'd be the best candidate, but it can be done."

I am a rising senior at a lower Ivy, and my dream is to work in the arena of international politics (international organizations). I know this kind of opportunities is really far away for an undergrad, which is why I plan on working my way up in the business world first, hence my interest in consulting. Despite the level of competition, I am only applying for MBB this fall, because it seems to me the big four (or other ""2nd tier"" consulting firms) are not good enough footings to start things off on to help me get to where I want to be ten years down the road; and so I might as well go to grad school if I couldn't get into MBB.

You are more or less right in your initial thoughts - MBB is better than any other firm in terms of reputation.  Ex McKinsey/HBS people run the business world and that's just a fact.  That said, if your long term goal is international politics, why are you looking at business consulting?  MBB/Big 4 does work with international firms, but even that doesn't typically broach into political consulting.  If you are really serious about being political, you should look at jobs/internships in that arena - like working for NGO's in Washington or getting on a Congressman's staff - rather than business consulting."

Are you looking for a specific role that is tied to cross-country trade, shipping, etc., and is that not in any way industry specific?

If you've done work which is more in the data science space you'd probably have a better shot I think: I'd be looking to see if you've used that Math BS to (for example) model customer wait times and (mathematically) optimise shift design or queue management (or whatever is relevant to your industry) and that it reduced wait times by X% and costs by $Y.   As it reads currently, ""wait time analysis"" to me says you just did ""select <some params>, avg(wait_time) from service_centre_stats group by <your params>"" -> come up with recommendations. What was the outcome of that analysis? Knowing some VBA, SQL and a few BI tools is not going to get your foot in the door - using your skills to build tangible value for the business however can.

consulting,394p2g,klemmon05,3,Wed Jun 10 10:37:04 2015 UTC,Haha.  No problem.  Disagreeing with a practice or a norm doesn't mean we can pretend it doesn't exist.  Relationships between men and women in business are tricky; I am personally much more cautious interacting with my female coworkers than I am with my male ones.  People will assume the worst with inter-sex relationships and assume the best with same-sex ones.  It sucks (and it makes things much harder for women IMO) but it the reality of the world today.

Bottle of wine is ideal (because you know he's not an alcoholic, he has interest in it and the fact that it's from abroad is that much more thoughtful) and not over the top (plus it's not immediately obvious how valuable it is, unlike a gift card or the like).

Half the battle of building networks and relationships (among colleagues and clients) is being a regular person and sometimes blurring the boundary between transactions and interactions.

It exists for a reason, primary among which is that exchanging tokens of appreciation or recognition is polite and normal."

Yes, but you have to do that in a way that makes the other person feel at ease.  You may have had different experiences, but from everything I have seen Americans get uncomfortable bringing gifts outside of socially determined events:  Housewarming - bring some wine; dinner/Christmas party - bring some wine;  Birthday - bring some wine!  Outside of those events, many people - myself included - get uncomfortable with excessive gift giving because its just not common.  I would never want to receive a gift for doing someone a favor or giving them advice - if they want to buy me lunch or a coffee ok but never a physical time.  OP wants to give the gift, so she is going to take your advice.  Just worth saying that, depending on the partner, it may make them uncomfortable.  A simple thank you note is always a safe bet."

If a client feels you are rude, insensitive or you just make them uncomfortable, its going to be a lot harder to win work.    Have you ever been greeted by a colleague, or candidate with an unexpected hug? Been kissed on both cheeks by a European colleague? Been bowed at, at length by an Asian client?    I have, and I went along with the behaviors because my goal was to make them feel comfortable - which is exactly my point.  If my goal is to make other people feel comfortable - which is the approach this woman should take to the Partner - then you abide by the traditions and customs of that culture.     If so it was probably out of your comfort zone but do you think any of those people did anything wrong or should be judged negatively for those actions?   Depends.  If someone comes to me for my help and doesn't abide by my cultural norms, I might judge them negatively for it, depending on how big the slight.  Even if there is no judgement, I am still uncomfortable, which can't possibly help you achieve whatever goal you were after.   Id rather know a person (and be known) for their genuine values and characteristics than hope that everyone is tiptoing around what they presume I am sensitive to.   Yes, but again we are consultants.  I need to know that my people are socially aware enough to be aware what people are sensitive too because that awareness could be the difference between winning or losing the work.    Edit:  Going by your earlier examples, if I brought a European consultant to my team and they were kissing clients on the cheek hello or goodbye, I would ask them to stop; its not normal in our culture, it will make the clients uncomfortable and we have to respect that.

That line is very blurry, and everyone sets it differently.   It is, which is why you have to rely on heuristics and general social norms until you are able to learn what you can and cannot do with any individual person.

A thank you note is more than enough but a well selected bottle of wine (as long as it's not obscenely expensive) is also not over the line (especially since you spoke at length about how much he likes wine). It will seem to him as this person isn't just using me to get a job. At the end of the day consulting is a person to person sales business and a partner at a big 4 firm has tons of people underneath him (and has probably provided this same type of assistance to many other people) anything you can do to make yourself more memorable (within reason) is to your advantage. A similar situation happened with me and every time I was at a networking event with the partner he would say 'hi so and so this is Leon Black he brought me xyz from xyz place and it was awesome'  But as a woman things might be a little bit more complicated but frankly it's a complication that could work in your favor (this is not a very PC answer btw just being honest)

For an entry-level position, I don't think there is a big expectation that you know exactly how to use SAP (set up config, etc.) but I would be prepared to answer a few fundamental (and easily researched questions):   What is SAP? What are some of the typical/common modules and their basic business uses? Why do companies implement SAP? Who are SAP's primary competitors? What kind of work does our firm do in the SAP space; what are some public examples of work we've done? Who are our (firm's) primary competitors in the SAP implementation space? (BONUS) What are the high level trends in the SAP (or broader ERP) landscape/space, and what kinds of public acquisitions or strategic decisions has SAP made in the last couple years to address changing market demands?   Talking with anyone who currently works at the firm in that space that can give you some anecdotal thoughts on what it's really like to work in their SAP practice is also a good idea if you have the contact(s).  Basically, be ready to have a conversation that indicates that you've done your homework to the best of your ability, that you've thought about what a career in their SAP practice might look like (and have legitimate interest), and that you have the raw capability to land on the ground and start knocking out low level tasks on Day 1.

consulting,393fsn,Brandon432,15,Tue Jun 9 03:27:12 2015 UTC,"When you're starting out and building trust, it's pretty hard to communicate too much. Some examples:   If you don't understand a request from a client, EM/PL, or a partner... ask! No point wasting time if you can just get it clarified. If you think you're just missing context or don't understand some jargon, ask an experienced BA/A/AC first. If you have no idea where to start on a particular workstream (which happens often) and can't find anything pertinent in the background deck or intranet/knowledge resources, pull together your best thinking/suggested course of action and run it by your EM/PL. Ideally, you'll find resources to help you pull together a coherent hypothesis, but if you can't, it's much better to flag it after an hour than after a day and a half. When you're starting, everyone can do everything faster than you... and no one expects you to know everything (anything?). Be crystal clear about timelines and the form of deliverable. Make sure to build in time for client/partner review. If something comes up in a team meeting, say ""That looks like 5-6 hours of work and I will email you draft slides by noon, so Molly can have the afternoon with it before we send to the client at EOD."" This is where you'll get feedback like, ""Just spend an hour and let's look at a bulleted list of the highlights before you spend a day on it. Molly just needs some talking points."" People get frustrated when their work gets scrapped, but usually it's because they simply went too far down a rabbit hole when that's not what their boss needed/wanted. A word on pronouns: don't use them. With a consulting team, client team, and support staff, ""he,"" ""she,"" and ""that"" can be terribly confusing. Instead of ""I'll have it for him this week,"" say ""I'll email Fred the final draft of the agenda on Thursday."" If something comes up and you won't be able to get to something else that you committed to have today, don't assume you have to stay up until 2am to finish. There will be plenty of times when that's the case, but most good managers will want you to reserve that energy for real client emergencies. Your best bet is to flag it in advance: ""Yup, I can jump on that right now, but it means that the TPS reports will push to after tomorrow's team meeting."""

That all said, you can still make it work.  Just go to the store, buy your basic groceries and expense them as one of your dinners.  I know a number of people at EY that go to various grocery stores (like Whole Foods) for lunches/dinners and their expenses are approved just fine.  *Edit:  Called a buddy at EY and confirmed - they bill actuals with the following guidance  $20 per day maximum for breakfast $40-$50 per day maximum for dinner, depending on the city.  Now once per week you can do what they call cost averaging you dinner meal.  This means that you can have one dinner per week that goes over the $40-$50 cap and use some of the money you didn't spend on other dinners to cover that; if you drop $100 one night and $25 the other two nights on a three night trip you are good.  Given all that, you can go buy up to $150 worth of groceries one night and use that to cook all three nights.

No one wants to hear that their company is in serious trouble, and depending on the messaging coming from the other vendors (""we're just a few releases away from seeing a big uptick in sales,"" etc.) you may be in for a bit of reality setting, which is never a good time even when you have the relationship.  Based on some of the figures you are citing, there is a material risk that this company is ready to fold rapidly (unless they have a material amount of capital in the hangar to support themselves indefinitely).  Assuming you have the relationship / position of authority to come in guns blazing, the simplest way to convince them that they need to make a change in course should be a relatively straightforward projection of their balance sheet over the next 12-24 months.  Relative decline in sales, increase in overall costs and overhead should paint a pretty bleak picture and inspire action.  Sadly, it's not that surprising that a relatively small business (sub-$1MM annual sales) is inexperienced with vendor management and hesitant to take a stand.

If a company isnt contacting me, and I'm not on the hook to deliver something by X date, I'm not going to be 100% proactive and reach out.  I unfortunately have other clients who are more responsive, and they get my attention.  My first goal is to stop the bleeding of cash. Credit Card Payments and Shipping Fees. Then evaluate the inventory controls, find a way to get that tighter for 6 months until they can figure out what to do there.  I would present my findings, give some data, and some concrete steps to resolve things, then wait. Its up to them to put the fire under their ass and be motivated to change.  As mercury_hermes said, there is not a lot you can do at the $sub-1mln range. Its going to be even more tough if you have no budget/cash to work with."

Yeah, but there's a definite difference between being a bit busy with something else and allowing a problem to metastasize over 2.5 years.  Today I was looking at it from a technical perspective, while trying to keep an eye on specific business problems.  What I intend to do is to propose cannibalizing as much of the existing technical infrastructure as possible. For example, their postage printer implementation actually nets them a really good rate, so simply fixing that flat-rate shipping garbage nets them easily pocketable money.  That's how I think I'm going to address the problem to them: here's Tech Solution X, and here's how it solves Business Problem Y.  Essentially, do the tech consult, and then just explain that there are business process benefits that will instantly come from those implementations.  With a minimally invasive approach, I think I can amputate the transaction hub entirely, refurb the website quickly and tie everything together into something that works and isn't a hair-pulling nightmare.  Culturally, I can tell you now that they're not inclined toward a techie taking up residence in the middle of their structure.  With that in mind, I figure the best idea is to leave them something highly maintainable. Right now, they have to pay for any on-page alterations -- again, a simple admin interface provides them with money that they can pocket.  That's my entire pitch: technical improvements at every step will yield business process improvements and, more importantly, instant savings."

Some projects will have me working till 10/11pm a couple of nights a week, and once or twice a year I'll have to work past midnight.   A lot of it comes down to your relationship with your manager and the client expectations. I've worked along side managers who were killing their teams, while my guys were wrapping up at 8/9pm and heading home. It was simple things like how they approached problems. My approach has always been, ""whats the minimum amount of analysis we need to do to convince the client/prove this is the right idea?""... vs. the other manager in that situation was always asking, ""what additional analysis can we provide? how can we make this more detailed?""

consulting,38zspd,mercury_hermes,6,Mon Jun 8 13:03:48 2015 UTC,"A few people are hitting on this directly or indirectly; I think the key is: * Figuring out what your personal limits are * Communicating them as clearly as possible to the right people (supervisors, mentors, etc.) * Recognizing there can be trade-offs and compromises * Understanding that your view of acceptable working standards may change over time  I remember starting out and feeling like I couldn't say ""no"" to anything; I got a sense of exhilaration and professional fulfillment out of being someone that could get almost any amount of work done under almost any circumstances.  In many ways I think this time was valuable, and it helped me to develop a level of credibility with future bosses, mentors, etc.  Over time, that kind of working style grew less attractive to me, and I started wanting more balance - I stopped waking up to answer emails overnight, started pushing back on weekend calls and off-hours fire drills.  I am certain there are any number of small opportunities and advantages I passed along over the years by drawing these lines; I'm also certain that sticking to my guns at times was essential to keeping my sanity and avoiding burn-out.  And longer term, I think finding this balance (and managing its changing nature over time) will continue to be essential in creating a sustainable career - whether that is in consulting or elsewhere.  My personal take is that consulting companies/projects take anything you are willing to give them - all of your time, energy, and attention - and only in rare circumstances will someone else step in and say on your behalf, ""Hey, maybe that's too much"".  Good luck finding that balance; it's something I'm sure many people here struggle with, but there are definitely ways to find it (or move on successfully if there just isn't a way to make it work)."

consulting,38zspd,mercury_hermes,3,Tue Jun 9 00:41:57 2015 UTC,"I think in general it's up to the individual, and for me personally there were times where I talked with a supervisor about dialing things back, they asked me to stick it out for a bit longer, and we found a compromise - there is always going to be a natural tension between what the project needs and the boundaries that you feel are important at the time.  I've also had junior resources come to me and tell me - no details offered or required - that they really needed to take things a notch down, and I've tried really hard to work with them to make the necessary changes.  Sometimes something as simple as getting a week or two off the road (even still working) or small adjustments made in agreement with the client can make a huge difference for people's state of mind and motivation.  I have had conversations with clients to let them know my people need breathing room - and the vast majority of those discussions have worked out pretty well (it helps that in most cases my teams' effort was recognized and valued, regardless of the state of the project overall).  All of this being said, I think the most important thing in starting this kind of conversation is understanding the demonstrated worth/value you have to work with, so that you can negotiate from a reasonable position of strength.  People that have seen your work product, know you are reliable, and recognize that you have been going to extreme lengths are much more receptive to a discussion on how to find balance.  If you have a real reputation as someone that slays the dragon every week, and you ask for a more flexible work schedule - with a commitment to getting the big deliverables done on-time and at quality - there's a pretty good chance of making that happen (even mid-role or mid-project).  If it's your third week on the project and you need to take every Friday off (recognizing there will always be personal exceptions that come into play) - probably a bit harder to work out.  One final thought on this: this may be a bit older-school, but I very much believe that the period of super hardcore work that tends to happen when you're a new consultant has an intrinsic value - you learn valuable information about your limits and boundaries, you build very rapid relationships (positive and negative), you get to show off a bit if you have the chops, and you typically acquire a ton of experience very rapidly.  I was clearing 100-110 hours a week easy on my first role because I absolutely felt like I had something to prove - destroying that role earned me some props which led to my second role, which led to my first promotion, which motivated me to obliterate the next role, which led to my third and fourth roles, which led to an early promotion, etc.  All of that being said, to return to the original point - at the end of the day it's a personal decision about boundaries, and clear communication to set them in a meaningful way, that helps make things work out in the end.  No rocket science here, but hope that helps answer your question."

Go to www.linkedin.com/alumni and see if you can 'warm call' fellow alumni who are at firms you want to join  2) LinkedIn - your other good option. Just connect with people who seem like they might be favorable to having a chat. You'd be surprised at how willing people will say yes. And, if they are busy, worst case scenario is they click 'delete' and forget about it entirely. Once you do get someone to chat with, obviously don't just jump off with, ""CAN YOU GIVE ME AN INTERVIEW"". Start off telling them that you are really interested in consulting and wanted to learn more from an actual practitioner. Through the course of conversation, try to seamlessly work in a request to connect with someone else. For instance, if they mention that a colleague did something you are really interested in, see if they would be willing to set up an introduction. Then do the same thing with the new person. You'll learn a lot about consulting, the firm, and even build a little network. With each conversation you grow more knowledgeable and you'll even start speaking like you already work there. Each person you speak with becomes more and more impressed. At some point, when you feel comfortable, start asking what they think the best 'next step' is for someone given your position.

From my research, roughly 2-3 students per year break into MBB. Your resume looks good, but without any previous consulting internships, it's going to be extremely difficult to even get an interview. My advice would be to try getting a Deloitte/Accenture position, work your ass off, M7 MBA, and then MBB.   Edit: After taking a closer look at your resume, I would like to add a second piece of advice. I assumed that you were a male when I wrote the piece above. Anyways, try looking into the special programs that MBB has for women in business. I met a woman who was able to leverage an interview after attending one of those events. Otherwise, you could also try staying in your current industry, attempt to climb the corporate ladder for a few years, and then try for business school/MBB. Good luck!"

Your SAT scores are useless space filler on your resume. Yes MBB will ask for them, but that's on the actual application itself. Put a line between the sections. For example, Experience should have a line on top of it to separate it from Education. Otherwise everything looks the same.  Large midwestern city for education should be on top of graduation date and your GPA should be right next to your BS degree. Flip your titles and your locations under experience. Dean's List and UHP don't really matter. Recruiters will be able to tell where your standing is just by your GPA. No one cares what courses you took abroad. What we care about is diversity of experience. Your bullet points for experience start well, but you need to add in how your value added contribution was able to impact the company. For example, you stated maintained waste collection programs. That's good. However, even better would be maintained waste collection programs and streamlined processes to allow for 40% reduction in redundancies. Your extracurriculars are interesting; however, they lack sustenance. Flesh those out more.    Don't be afraid to make the margins smaller. Also please seriously take this advice: DO NOT USE Garamond. Who do you think you are an elementary school teacher trying to tell parents what they're kids will be doing for the next month?

I was brought on because they were starting an SAP central practice, and needed people with SAP development experience. It was one of the worst jobs I ever had.   Some BG on me so you understand where I'm coming from. I'd been a database developer for about 18 years working in SQL server, Access, SAP BW, etc... when I was approached and asked to apply.  I got the job easily.  One there I was sent to a class for about a week in San Francisco to learn about IT Audit. It is a lot of common sense and following certain guidelines that seem to change year to year.  It's also a lot of paperwork. This I was not prepared for.  I wound up flying all over the place for various clients, Hanford Washington, Scottsdale Az, and a lot I just don't remember right now. One fun thing I did get to do, was get to be involved in the internal audit of a client where I helped implement their datawarehouse a few years before. Got to see some old friends and had a ball on that engagement. It was a bit weird revisiting code and configurations I'd had a hand in crafting.  Pay will be based on experience, at the time I made around 85k - 90k + bonuses, but as a relative noob you'll make a lot less.  I hope you enjoy travel, because you'll be doing a lot of it.  One of the more frustrating things for me was seeing obvious problems with a system and not being allowed to fix them. As I said I'm a developer at heart, so this was not a good fit for me.  One thing I did not like, is there was a big push to advance to Partner, do some selling, etc.... That is  something I've never been comfortable doing. There are some long hours, and a lot of pressure. The various KPMG offices I visited all had a quiet room where you could get away for a few minutes during busy season.

If you put together some great anecdotes and experiences then you'll have a leg up.   You could certainly go IBD as a junior though a good brand is better. It'll put your quant beyond reproach and you'll get to try another industry. Also consulting internships are somewhat harder to get than full time.

Depending on your health insurance provider, being covered even one day of them month requires them to keep you on for the entire month. However, if you aren't employed to pay for your contribution, your company won't deduct your contribution from payroll, and the insurance company won't get paid either (*edit, they sometimes get paid for the month, and sometimes don't). It's part of a system they call ""Wash Basis"", where some people come out ahead and some people come out behind, but in the end it's a wash, because it's too complicated to write procedures for edge cases like this.

Right or wrong, older generations view the younger one as having a sense of entitlement.  You may disagree, but you need to take that into account when you interact with us.  Perception is reality in the mind of the perceiver, so if you are interviewing with us and we percieve you as having a sense of entitlement that is going to hurt you.

As I mentioned before, the goal here is not to make a judgement call - its just to make people aware that the stereotype exists.

consulting,38h20n,mtheory523,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:29:17 2015 UTC,"overall very young average age characterizing this kind of industry   Consulting is NOT a young industry.  The average worker may be, but the average worker doesn't really matter - only the Partners matter as they are the only ones who have any real decision making power.  When was the last time you saw a partner under 40?   less prone to stereotype   Yes and no.  I do think we are better about some (race, gender, sexual orientation) than other industries since so much of our business is results driven; I personally don't care if you are only attracted to rocks so long as my deck gets done on time.    That said, I do think there is still agism, though that is more firm dependent.  I'm at a Big 4, which is really the stereotypical ""grey hair"" firm.  Here your age and tenure really do make a difference as our clients expect recommendations that are derived from experience rather than models or blue sky.  That has been internalized in the fact that we expect a bit of humility from our younger resources; you can put out an opinion or good idea when you have one but you should really spend more time listening than talking.  The issue with the stereotype is that it does have some validity to it.  It is a popular opinion.  I have personally seen some of it first hand (I had a 6 week old new hire that was angry I didn't take him into a meeting with the CFO) and my collegues have shared similar experiences with me.  The real point of it all is this:  there are people that feel this way and that is something you need to factor into your behavior.

consulting,38h20n,mtheory523,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:04:11 2015 UTC,"So, I hate to do this because the two of you have resolved this pretty amicably in the thread below, but it's worth saying, /u/mtheory523: you aren't listening (or reading) closely enough.  /u/ansuz07's point was that generation perception exists whether or not you have directly experienced it and your response was, ""that's not true in my experience/opinion"".  Further down you suggest that the current older generation of consulting is not only not age- or generation-discrimination free, but that they have in fact transcended discrimination of any kind:   I still believe that their objectivity doesn't stop at race, gender, religions...   Is your position really that racism, sexism, and other cultural stereotyping simply doesn't exist at the upper echelons of (typically incredibly homogenized) consulting leadership?  I know this is really hard feedback to accept, but I think it's critical development when you're younger and newer in your career.  People have stereotypes about other people.  This is real, and true, and not just limited to cross-generational perception.  It may not be right, but it exists and you should understand that it exists.  You should also understand that discrimination/stereotypes aren't always things you can easily see, perceive, or experience - they can exist subtly, or only be exhibited when you aren't around.  They can take the form of very slight actions that happen gradually over a very long period of time.  If this were untrue, we wouldn't all have to take those hysterical anti-discrimination/sexual harassment trainings/seminars, all leadership and project teams would be a veritable rainbow of diversity, and no one would ever be surprised at who got promoted and who got rated the best and we wouldn't gossip in our cubes and offices about who deserved it and who didn't, and ohmygod-can-you-believe-that-jackass-made-partner-who-is-s/he-fucking-and-how-do-I-get-in-line.  I love that you feel that you can talk with partners casually about a range of topics (including what music you like), and that you don't perceive any kind of stereotype about your age, but when you leave the room you have literally no idea what they are saying about you behind literally or figuratively closed doors.  Take a minute to soak that in.  You have no idea if they roll their eyes as soon as you leave the room, or if they were texting someone else about how annoying you are while you were talking, or if you've become a topic of after-work discussion (""can you believe /u/mtheory523?  s/he spent 30 min talking to me about Taylor Swift today and I couldn't get him/her to shut up so I had to pretend I had a call just to get some work done."")  You don't know.  Not in your opinion you do/don't know.  You simply don't know.  ALL OF THIS IS NOT TO SAY, ""LIVE IN FEAR OF THE OLDER GENERATION"".  Confidence is great; developing a comfort level with all levels of your organization - and feeling a sense of belonging - is great.  All people are trying to say here is that in your career you are likely to encounter leaders who may judge you because you are younger (or of a different gender, race, religion, birthplace, cultural background - take your pick, it's a multi-select option) and that it is only to your advantage to recognize that discrimination exists.  How you use this understanding is personal and specific to your situation, but it is almost never advantageous to insist that we live in discrimination-less society when that is very patently untrue (you young, idealistic, Millennial whippersnapper).  Best of luck."
consulting,38h20n,mercury_hermes,0,Fri Jun 5 14:27:59 2015 UTC,"Alright Buddy. I wasn't sure if I should respond to your comment, but what the hell.   For you, stereotypes on age is fact. It is not. That's why we have policy, training about the behaviour to adopt in the work place, etc.  However, does that mean that I think that discrimination does not exist ? Does that mean that I think that some people in MC are not racist, or sexist ? No.   The only way this kind of behaviour can express itself is, as you brilliantly stated, subtly through comments, feelings, the ""je-ne-sais-quoi"" that an interviewer didn't perceive. And when you touch this kind of subject my friend, you are on the territory of perceptions and opinions. Not facts.  And this is why stereotypes perceptions vary greatly from one person to the other, from one firm to the other, from one region to the other. If it was a fact, I should have experienced it very well believe me (but I won't talk about my background).   Furthermore, when you touch interviewing process especially (which is kinda part of the subject of discussion), you have a very regulated and ""as-objective-as-possible"" process. WAY MORE, than in any other industry. Interviewer are trained to be as objective as possible and if even a suspicion of sexism, racism, etc. is felt, then believe me the interviewer is going to have a bad ride out of this. This is why I said that their objectivity was beyond that.   Now I love how you explain your paranoia about what the hell people are saying behind ones back and just after say that ""we should not live in fear of older generation"". That is just pure gold, thank you.   If people want to criticise my age or music taste behind my back, so be it. But it becomes a problem when their stereotypes interfere with the work (which is the subject of discussion, remember ?), and that really can almost never happen because of all the existing policies and regulation.   Again, don't want to talk about my background but stereotypes are something that I experienced throughout my whole life. Every week I experience some mean comments in the bakery or on the street. But it's just absent in the workplace. And this makes SENSE."

Our experiences have differed; and that is perfectly reasonable.  I will say that I think the processes you are describing that attempt to limit discrimination (e.g. HR, review/audit/restrictions on the interview process) can have an interesting effect where overt discrimination (asking questions about people's race, background, etc.) is pushed even further into the background and in response we develop a new set of even subtler behaviors to encapsulate our preconceptions and internal stereotypes.  This is only human, if perhaps besides the point.  I meant it when I said we don't need to live in fear of the older generation (or more generally, people who are different from us).  My point was not that we should be paranoid about what other people think about us, but that we should value mindfulness about the way that we can be (and are) perceived.  I've worked with a lot of junior resources who thought they were absolutely bulletproof and end up rubbing people the wrong way - and didn't realize it until much further down the road, when the impression had already been made.  It's something that I have done myself, and received good coaching on over the years; it's become an important part of my working style, this consciousness about perception.  Take this in the spirit in which it was given - from an old, salty consultant to a (presumably) younger and growing one - solely with the interest of passing on some of the lessons I've learned the hard way in my own career.

I was on my third and final interview with McKinsey and second interview with BCG prior to the Bain application deadline.  FWIW, among the people I practiced with results were highly correlated between MBB, either you got offers from all the companies or none of them.

I would agree that they all focus on problem solving and deriving insights, but how to actually do well in them is quite different.  For starters, there's the format: McKinsey employs the ""Interviewer Led"" format, while BCG and Bain employs the ""Interviewee Led"" format.  As just one example of how this matters, take the initial framework.  For McKinsey's interviewer led format, it is critical to be super thorough in your initial framework because its your only opportunity to show the breadth and depth of how you might solve a problem.  After the initial framework, the interviewer pretty much takes over the 'driving'.  On the other hand, you can be more sparse with Bain cases since they are so focused on being ""hypothesis-driven"".  Here, you don't want to 'boil the ocean' since it runs counter to their philosophy - not to mention the freeflowing format allows you to go back and add spokes to your framework later if need be.  There's lots of other nuances too - for instance, PE cases for Bain, different terminologies, when you can take time to collect yourself, the types of charts to expect, etc.  And also, there's the matter of the McKinsey PEI, which no other firm has.  While Bain and BCG might do a few behavioral questions, nothing comes close to the 20 minute grill session that is the Personal Experience Interview.

All the while, the vast majority of hospitals operate at a loss and are unable to buy the proper equipment.

consulting,385006,cliffg,4,Mon Jun 1 22:29:28 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't ask for a formal reference letter from a client while at the firm, for two reasons:   1. What does it suggest to your employer?  They should be the ones collating feedback from a number of sources (internal, external, self) to evaluate you.  If I found out somebody was canvassing clients for letters of reference, it would look like you're shaping up to move on.  2. What benefit does it do you?  Per above, your employer should already know whether you are doing good work for your client which will factor into your performance reviews.  Also, you are likely bound by confidentiality, so you couldn't share it with future clients to try to win additional work.  Finally, if you are planning to leave, what is stopping you from asking for the letter of reference from the client then, avoiding any unintended blowback?    But that said, if you are on particularly good terms with them, then here's a couple of things I could suggest instead:   Store any emails with positive feedback in a separate folder, so you can reference them when doing your performance reviews. If you are chummy with a client, there's no harm in adding them on LinkedIn, so you can keep in touch if you're planning to move on. If you are extremely chummy with them, then perhaps you could ask them to give you a brief recommendation on LinkedIn - because they can post it on your behalf, it certainly looks a lot more unsolicited than asking for a formal reference."

You will be able to see their full range of services and often times, they include case studies on work that they have done.  You can start with firms like McKinsey, BCG, Bain, Deloitte, AT Kearney, or Strategy&.  Generally, here's a description from Vault:  Management/strategy consultants solve a multitude of organizational problems. All management/strategy consultants require knowledge of management science, strategy, operations, marketing, logistics, mergers and acquisitions, manufacturing, government relations, environmental issues (including compliance), materials management and physical distribution, finance and accounting, human resources/staffing, and electronic data processing and systems.  Examples of typical management/strategy consulting tasks include (note: these are definitely realistic projects):   recommending a new strategic direction for a growing wireless company determining why a Hollywood studio keeps losing money and how the studio can reposition itself to profit maximize from new markets analyzing the auto bailout for a presidential task force studying why an online retailer is losing market share to a competitor helping a major telecommunication service provider transition from outdated equipment to next-generation networks developing a strategy for a consumer products company to revive a 50-year-old brand and relaunch it worldwide valuing a computer hardware manufacturer on a stand-alone basis, or suggesting possible buyers to help it divest some of its non-core businesses evaluating investment opportunities in a variety of industry sectors to support the growth aspirations of a multinational company streamlining the equipment purchasing process of a major steel manufacturer determining how a restaurant chain can spend less on ingredients without changing its menu increasing the efficiency of customer response at a newly merged commercial bank creating a new logistical database for a smartphone manufacturer   Hope this helps!"

So, the question you have to ask yourself is:  what about you makes you better than everyone else you work with, so much so that MBB would hire you over them?  What skill set do you bring to the table that will make you stand above everyone else you work with?  If you have a really good answer to that question, then you have a chance.

Finding a job out of IT took me over a year, it was NOT an easy transition, but I did finally get into healthcare management, and that job was a dream. I loved it, but the pay wasn't great. I had six figures of debt, and while I was making do, and probably could have pinched, I wanted more and knew I was worth more.  My current job is for a smaller firm, but I've put accenture, deloitte, and KPMG consultants out of work, quickly, because we're a small firm with far less overhead and great strategic guidance...plus you know, my boss has all the right connections. I'm now in management consulting for an unnamed pharmaceutical company that does quite a bit of its part to carry the world economy, and because of the wide breadth of experience I have, I can speak to a granular level of IT, healthcare, and management consulting. It took me a while to get here, and it was not easy, but it was worthwhile.  Getting out of IT was easily the hardest part of all of it, being that ingrained that I had the opportunities I did and being able to get out of it do not go hand-in-hand. Be prepared to switch companies if you have to, if they're not offering you the right opportunities. That's my only advice, know your worth, and be willing to get it.

consulting,3805s3,TomRizzle,4,Sun May 31 21:38:08 2015 UTC,"The way I would look at it:  What is Cloud Drive?  Cloud storage service for users who have a gmail account to store almost any file.  Solution  I would break this out as:  #of users x storage cost x activity cost = annual cost  I would then apply some sort of churn rate to this to determine the life time cost (explained below).  Users   Assume 1 Billion Drive Users 10% are power users = 100M 80% are mid users = 800M 10% are lite users = 100M   Storage Cost  I recently read that 1GB of storage costs about $0.04 so:   Power user = $0.60 per year Mid user = $0.20 per year lite user = $0.04 per year   Activity  I am assuming that uploading/downloading and updating files costs money. Wild assumption here, but I'll say an average of $0.0001 per operation (1/100 of 1 cent).   Power user = 60 operations/day = $0.006/day = $2.19 per year Mid user =  20 operations/day = $0.002/day = $0.73 per year lite user = 1 operation/day = $0.0001/day = $0.037 per year   Total Annual Cost   Power user = $0.60 + $2.19 = $2.79  Mid user = $0.20 + $0.73 = $0.93 Lite = $0.04 + $0.037 = $0.077   Lifetime Cost  When a user leaves the cloud platform my assumption is that they leave their data there and simply stop using the service. As such, storage costs persist while activity costs drop to zero.  The best way to account for this would actually be to chart out the declining cost of storage (every 18 months it will halve) so after about 3 years the 0.04 per GB will become immaterial. But since my assumptions make activity cost the bulk of the annual cost, a simple churn rate can be used to determine the life time cost.  I am assuming the following annual churn rates:   Power 10% annual = $27.90 LTC Mid 20% annual = $4.65 LTC Lite 30% annual = $0.12 LTC   So if I were to calculate the lifetime cost of the total user base today it would look like:   Power = $2.79B Mid = $3.62B Lite = $12M   Total Cost = $6.42B Lifetime cost of 100B users  I'm sure a bunch of these assumptions are way off base (especially the cost per operations). One question, is it fair to use the LTV calculation for lifetime cost? Basic LTV = Profit / churn% in this case I substitute profit with cost. Would love to hear other perspectives."
consulting,3805s3,beer_warriors_ghost,8,Sun May 31 22:08:52 2015 UTC,"From the perspective of a computer engineer:  - 1bil is way more than the amount of Google Drive users - there were about 250mil who used the service monthly as of last fall.  - When estimating 'lite' vs 'mid' vs 'power' users - usually the distribution is not a bell curve but more like a 'reverse exponential' - i.e. most users will be 'lite' users, then the next biggest group will be 'mid' users, and after that maybe 1% would be 'power' users. Not that it matters because...  - Bandwidth is cheap. Magnitudes cheaper than storage space, for example the cost of storing one gigabyte might be 10-100 times the cost of transferring that gigabyte.  - How much does storage cost then? That's also pretty cheap - maybe a a tenth of a penny or less / GB / month. Google charges to buy additional storage but it's hard to tell whether that covers the cost of the additional space because they could possibly also cover the cost from ad revenue. A better indicator of storage costs would be Amazon. So assuming $0.001 / month / GB, 250mil users at the free tier (15GB space, less than 1% upgrade so paid tiers are negligible):  250,000,000 * 15 * 0.001 * 12 = $45mil / year, or $3.6bil over eighty years (assuming that storage costs stay the same and number of users stay the same).  Also a quick note, Moore's law (""every eighteen months it will halve"") doesn't necessarily apply to storage."

How do they intend to store their data? Shared or individually?   I believe $50 a year gets you 15gb of total data per user.   if they're storing data on a per-user basis, each user would just share the appropriate folders.  If they're storing data on a team basis, you'd probably have to add an extra account per team; to better keep that data separated.  In this scenario the cost per user increases.   And since you're doing lifetime, they're asking for the period of time which the employee will work there - and the answer to that is generated from what type of business, employee functions.   Basically, just pin down some variables so you can give an estimate in the form of a short range or simple formula - people love line graphs."

consulting,380fu0,ddlbb,3,Mon Jun 1 01:02:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, PE/VC chance is virtually zero unless you have the network for it. It is the most in demand, with the least supply. None of the work you currently do is relevant, so you're fighting uphill... I should qualify this by saying that you'll understand technology a little bit for VC type of stuff, but no more than someone who is a CS major and so on. VC work is even harder to get than PE.    If you have an excellent story for why, you can try banking -> PE type of route (assuming you have banking internships or something). Otherwise, the MBA is probably a transition into finance.   It looks like you don't like what you're doing. If you have a specific goal in mind that is a massive shift as tech consulting to PE, I'd really consider an MBA in your position (apply in 1-2 years)."
consulting,380fu0,mudiverse,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:29:48 2015 UTC,"I can attest to this as it looks like I am in between both of you in experience (~2 yrs). The ""Tech/IT"" label is scary and is quickly becoming how people perceive me and my resume. If you come from the classic tech consulting groups (Accenture, PWC, IBM, Deloitte, etc) it will be nearly impossible to touch PE/VC without an mba. I don't know of a single person who has succeeded in moving straight out of these practice groups into the banking route (this includes extensive LinkedIn trolling). If you are an MBB with strategy experience and the vaunted prestige, you may have better luck. I wouldn't count on the top 20 school helping you as your name will now be more closely associated with your consulting firm then anytime else.   I'm in a similar position where I dislike my work in tech and am looking for an out.

I can't tell you if you will be prepared to do that in 6 to 10 years. Would you feel comfortable starting your own business in a very complex industry in 6 to 10 years? Some people would be and some people wouldn't be. Your best bet is to work for a while and try to learn what you're doing, and keep in mind that if you want clients and money you will have to both keep up with the work and do all of the background/coordination stuff that employed consultants don't even have to think about."

Regardless, your absolute best option is to network to get an in. If you don't already have friends at the firms you are interested in, then two major ways to do this:  1) Alumni Network - your best option. Go to www.linkedin.com/alumni and see if you can 'warm call' fellow alumni who are at firms you want to join  2) LinkedIn - your other good option. Just connect with people who seem like they might be favorable to having a chat. You'd be surprised at how willing people will say yes. And, if they are busy, worst case scenario is they click 'delete' and forget about it entirely. Once you do get someone to chat with, obviously don't just jump off with, ""CAN YOU GIVE ME AN INTERVIEW"". Start off telling them that you are really interested in consulting and wanted to learn more from an actual practitioner. Through the course of conversation, try to seamlessly work in a request to connect with someone else. For instance, if they mention that a colleague did something you are really interested in, see if they would be willing to set up an introduction. Then do the same thing with the new person. You'll learn a lot about consulting, the firm, and even build a little network. With each conversation you grow more knowledgeable and you'll even start speaking like you already work there. Each person you speak with becomes more and more impressed. At some point, when you feel comfortable, start asking what they think the best 'next step' is for someone given your position. Hopefully they will pass your resume to HR directly."

consulting,37te1u,Floridar,2,Sat May 30 15:11:20 2015 UTC,"For many reasons, its hard to find people who have done this. Top 3 being that the pool is already going to be small because there are a lot of schools that don't let PTMBA recruit with FT. Even if they do, they had better be a target (Booth, Kellogg, etc) because while its hard but possible to get in from a state school (like I did), its damn near impossible to get in from a state schools PTMBA program, even IF they let you apply. Cut that again for self selection (assuming top candidates targeting consulting overwhelmingly choose FT, because why would you put yourself at any possible disadvantage with the $$$ on the line?), cut that AGAIN when you realize that many who go into consulting post-MBA also did consulting at a firm before their MBA. These firms don't sponsor or reimburse for PTMBA programs.   All that said, these firms didn't get to where they are by blindly refusing to snatch up talented people, no matter where they find them. You won't see MBB recruiting say ""I've got the resume of a candidate with great work experience, high GMAT, former Olympic athlete and made a great impression at our recruiting event.

consulting,37rr24,dDelts,6,Fri May 29 21:25:18 2015 UTC,"Assuming you mean travel, then yes, the default for consultants is travel. There are definitely exceptions, usually in the 'consulting support' category - I'd classify these people as the data analysts, the science specialists ( like at LEK) and others. For the typical consultant, when it comes to project control (based on my MBB experiences), there are basically three levers: team, location, industry. A few nuances:  a) Your firm has an impact on this. Bain is somewhat more locally focused, BCG is somewhat more regionally focused, and McKinsey is somewhat more globally focused. I say somewhat because it's relatively easy to do whatever you want after the first year.  b) Location and Industry Interplay. If you live in DC and want to only do Tech, then you will probably be traveling a lot. That said, if you live in Houston and want to do Oil and Gas, you probably get to sleep in your own bed.  c) At my MBB I feel like there's an equal mix of consultants who prefer one of the three levers. Slight outliers are the younger people like to travel and stick to a team they enjoying working with and the parents who want to stay local.   d) Seniority matters. At the entry level to the Manager level, you can do pretty much whatever. Once you get to the level right below Partner, your life pretty much goes to shit in terms of hours, travel, everything. Before my old boss hit Partner, he was doing NYC -> Tokyo -> Charlotte weekly.   e) At the end of the day you will travel at MBB. Even my financial services colleagues in NYC will be on at least one travel project a year which comes out to about 2-3 months. This is not including flying to visit a random manufacturing plant or retail store in Podunk, Nowheresville.  f) One except is Private Equity Group (PEG) at Bain. The upside is that those guys don't travel, but the downside is that they sleep under their office cubicles."
consulting,37rr24,QiuYiDio,7,Fri May 29 21:43:14 2015 UTC,"My old boss quit after someone asked his daughter, ""Where does Daddy work?"" Her answer... ""The airport!""  Travel is a slow wear and tear. At first its awesome. When I first started at 21, I would flex-fly every weekend... Vegas, Puerto Rico, SF, lots of fun places. That said, the novelty wears off quickly. I did six years of NYC <-> SF and it's exhausting. Partially my fault because I wanted to live in NYC but work with tech companies. You wake up at 5A on Monday, cram into a tiny plane, pass out exhausted, then get to the client site at 10A and slog through the day until 7P. Then on Thursday, you loiter around until 11P to take a red-eye which gets you back home bright and early at 6A and then you slog through the day. You might be tempted to sleep early that day, but given you are only home on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (really only half of Sunday because you need to prep for the work week and sleep early), you push through to make the most of it. That comes out to nearly 33% of your week being shit.  Relationship-wise its also tough. You basically only see your significant other for three days. You miss out on a lot of stuff. Birthday parties, a random event in town like a food festival, holidays like Valentine's Day, etc. You need to make sure that your significant other is ready for this commitment. Phone calls can also be tough if you're in different time zones. When I was in SF, I'd get off work at around 7P, but would often go to team or client dinners; I wouldn't get home until 10P, which is 1A where my girlfriend lived.  In summary, you need to be a specific type to hit Partner. Most of the consultants I know who have families try to stay local as much as possible (easier to do in NYC than a place like Philly or LA). Many people just decide that consulting is an investment with a strict timeline so that they can cash out to industry after 3-4 years to work 9-5 and make $200K."

Now in my old age and with a fiancee, I have become much more amenable to projects in the NYC area regardless of sexiness.  Luckily, the city has been growing as a tech hub, especially in fintech and even consumer tech so that keeps me interested.  At the same time, I've branched out to things like healthcare and education which are much more plentiful in the Northeast Corridor.  I've been able to keep travel to about 25 - 33%, and even when I do travel, it's been train and not plane.  So still away from home, but at least in emergencies, I can catch an Amtrak at 6P to go home and then be back at the client at 9A the next day."

consulting,37rr24,shemp33,2,Fri May 29 21:57:12 2015 UTC,"You have a lot of good answers, but in my group, we tend to focus on our ""side"" of the country.  We have team members all over the US. When a project comes up, we try to staff it with a team that is only +/- one time zone away, to avoid killing people. Before putting this plan in place, we realized how bad it could be for someone when we had a project in Seattle, where one of the team members was flying there each week from Miami. That's one city pair flight combination that I would absolutely hate. He did it, but fortunately, it was only a short project.  At any rate, for us, projects on the east cost, for example, will not be staffed by team members coming out of Denver. They'd come off the east coast, and as far away as possibly Dallas, Kansas City, or Chicago. A project on the west coast would be staffed by team members from local plus as far away as Las Vegas, Denver, that sort of thing.  TL;DR, we actually try to keep a sane travel distance for our team members traveling.  Our consultants' job descriptions read as travel ""up to 75%"" which basically means always on the go. It normally works out as every week in/out of a client site during a project (3-6-9 months, maybe more) then maybe a break of a week or two until the next project starts. My current project is working on a team that is entirely virtual, so there's no client site - we're all working by WebEx and boy does that stink..."

consulting,37rr24,Brandon432,1 point,Sat May 30 09:34:19 2015 UTC,"But you can settle down in one place. As long as it's a city with an airport with actual jet service from more than one major carrier.  Figure out what's important to you. Are your parents still alive? Stay close to them, because they won't always be. Have a girlfriend or boyfriend? Keep your home city and go where you gotta go. Don't ever feel like you have to live in a certain city to be in this business. Most of us types have offices at home and only show up to the company office a few times a year. (Might vary for some people though)   And if none of the above applies, consider how you book your flights. Let me explain. Let's say you are based in Boston and your client is in Raleigh.  You fly Boston to Raleigh for the week but you book your trip home as Raleigh to Miami and then the next week, you fly in from Miami, and then home to Boston at the end of week 2.   As long as the cost of RDU-MIA-RDU is similar to BOS, no one even blinks. As you build up hotel and car rental points, that stay in Miami could be super cheap, maybe even completely free except your food and other consumables."

It's more that many consultants basically don't spend much time at ""home"".  That makes it hard to be attached to any particular place where your permanent residence is.  My brother moved three times (to three different cities) in less than two years as a consultant.  He then quit to found a startup in a fourth city, and after a little over a year moved to a fifth city, so you could definitely say that he wasn't able to settle down.

Are you going in at BA or ASC?  There's slightly different focuses on skills depending on which (quant as a BA versus leadership as a ASC)  b).  Structure: BTO interviews are almost exactly the same as generalist interviews.   Problem Solving Test - 60 minutes (depends on region) multiple-choice quantitative test First Round: 2 interviews with Associate / Engagement Managers Second Round: 3 interviews with Engagement Managers / Associate Principals and at least one Principal / Director   c).  Interview Content: for every interview in the first and second round, you have both:   Case Interview - 30 minutes to solve a business problem Personal Experience Interview - 20 minutes to discuss one experience from your life   Check out the Wiki on this site for more information on the interview.  Was there anything specific you wanted to know about?  People have written whole books on this topic (see: The Case Interview, Case Interview Secrets, Case In Point, etc.) so it'd be better if you had targeted questions.  When is it and how much prep have you done already?  Depending on your answer, you may want to consider professional case prep."
consulting,37q4us,QiuYiDio,2,Fri May 29 17:10:58 2015 UTC,"McKinsey doesn't do implementation in general. The BTO team works on projects from a CIO's perspective. So it is strategy, but related to technology directly. Moreover, you'll still work on other strategy cases with the rest of the firm.   Now, the interviews for BTO are the same as for the regular consulting position - except for I've found that the cases can be specific to technology. For example, the cases I had were not your regular CEO level strategy cases (entering a new market for a consumer product or whatever), but they were cases from a CIO's perspective on how to merge two different ERP systems, or what you would look at when developing a new software, etc. This caught me by surprise, but it makes sense given what BTO is."

While I didn't follow your planned path exactly, it's pretty close. I did the Peace Corps straight out of undergrad, then worked for a couple years at a multilateral organization (think UN or World Bank), now I'm a first year at a M7 MBA program and interning in consulting this summer. First, let me say don't do Peace Corps because you think it will help you differentiate yourself on a b-school app. It is by far the best, most meaningful thing I've ever done, but it's not for everybody. Most of the people that served with me who did it as a resume booster ended up quitting early--which doesn't look good down the road for anyone (Peace Corps or you). Do it because this is something you want to do. It's a great opportunity to see the world, do some self-exploration, and do some really great work while you're at it.   As @dontquixote pointed out, it makes way more sense to do Peace Corps first, then transition to an analyst role in consulting. I wish I had done this instead of going back into public sector work. The only caveat is that it will be wayyy harder to break into these firms 2 years out of undergrad and when you don't have on-campus recruiting. You're gonna have to really network to get interviews (but since your at a T20 school, you'll know quite a few of your classmates who go to these firms). Plenty of people work first, then do Peace Corps, but you may just seem a little less focused on a b-school app. Additionally your most recent experience won't be as relevant in the classroom.  Feel free to let me know if you have any questions. Great that you're planning early, but a lot can change between now and when you graduate college in a few years."
consulting,37m0wx,anonypanda,1 point,Sun May 31 04:15:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the super relevant advice. I like the idea of living simply abroad. I want to become fluent in Spanish. I think it would be fun to help other people, especially in a business capacity. I'm definitely not looking for a resume booster just exploring what my situation would be after this adventure.  The 1st reason why I was thinking analyst then PC was because I heard it was very difficult to get an analyst job if you are not currently in college. As in there are three recruiting routes: one for current undergraduates, one for current MBAs and one for people with experience at another firm or in another closely related field. I didn't want to ""get stuck"" between those roles.   The 2nd reason is because I thought I would be able to have a greater impact on the people I would teach/consult/advise if I had a little professional experience. It's one thing to get business advice from a smart kid who took a half dozen business classes. It's quite another to get advice from a professional management consultant who worked 50-70 hours a week in the field. Yes, I'm aware of the irony that I think I'd be prepared to work for a top 10 firm right out of college, but would want extra training before doing much simpler work with the PC. Tell me if you think I'm outright wrong here. I guess this idea sort of comes out of a slightly irrational fear of potentially being a young, cocky ""white savior"" from the developed world who isn't actually helping anyone.  A few questions:  1) Do you know of any example of what the business advising volunteers do with the PC? The info on the website is sort of vague.   2) Can I ensure that I'd be doing business advising work (aka I don't want to land in El Salvador and find out I'm actually teaching first grade English... although I wouldn't really be against that. It would just be nice to know what I'm doing before hand).  3) Would b-schools and employers care that my service was somewhat business related? Does it matter to them that I'd be ""developing marketing campaigns, conducting market research, improving packaging, processing and pricing and teaching entrepreneurship/personal finance*""? Or is it all the same to them?  *rough summary of job description on PC website"
consulting,37m0wx,QiuYiDio,2,Mon Jun 1 02:43:28 2015 UTC,"Not a problem, happy to help. Despite some of its drawbacks, I'm still a huge Peace Corps advocate. I'll try to answer point-by-point.  You're right. It will be harder to break into consulting 2 years out. That said, I had plenty of friends from undergrad who worked at Big 4 and MBB who offered to drop my resume, I just wanted to pursue public sector stuff instead.  You're right. You will be a more effective volunteer if you have a couple years work experience. Most people come straight from undergrad though because it's just a good time for it. It's also pretty hard to quit the working world and drop out for 2 years once you've been working for 2 years already, you're making good money, and you can see your career track in front of you. Also, I don't think a consulting firm will be as likely to sponsor your MBA if you take a 2 year break between working for the firm and going to b-school. Doing Peace Corps after 2 years of working may also confuse an admissions committee (this is secondary though and not a hard fact).  I was a business volunteer so I can tell you what I was doing. I worked with an agribusiness in Africa on growth strategy and building international partnerships with foreign buyers, which sounds much sexier than it actually felt while I was there. While there I pretty much did everything you mentioned from the website.  You can ensure that you'll be doing business advising work. Peace Corps allows you to now pick your country and role (this didn't use to be the case 2 years ago).  B-school and employers will very much care that your service was business related. I don't think I'd be where I am now if I had done Agriculture, Health, Education, etc.  Hope that's helpful!"
consulting,37l0mj,PPS1122,2,Thu May 28 12:02:05 2015 UTC,There is a difference. Technology Strategy is essentially (and formerly called) IT Strategy.

Business Strategy consultants typically work on cross-functional strategy roles but are usually industry aligned.  Think of it as being functionally aligned (to tech) vs industry aligned.

consulting,37khe4,QiuYiDio,2,Thu May 28 17:04:49 2015 UTC,"Three things come top of mind:  Client champions - These guys make or break.  Find the influencers in the organization and win them over to your side.  For some people it'll be showing them the data, for others its how much they like you, and for others it could be anything in between.  Change happens best when people think it came from within.  Co-creation - Not sure if its too late already, but the best way of creating client champions is to co-create the strategy.  Or well, more realistically, make the other people feel like they co-created the strategy... even if they didn't do anything...  Leading with benefits - you need to make a clear, unequivocal declaration of how the changes will benefit them personally.  Too many times I have seen decks that lead off with either:   how much the old process sucked <- this one is especially bad... you're basically saying, ""hey you guys are stupid!"" a detailed explanation of how we came up with the new process <- this one is basically consultants telling clients, ""look at how smart we are!"" - no one cares just diving into the guts of the new process itself.  <- who will want to listen to this without knowing what they get out of it?   This stuff matters, but it matters less.  If you want buy-in, you have to earn it ASAP and you do that by showing them how their lives get better and stay better.  Once you get their attention, then you have your in.  But even as you explain the guts of the new process, it continues to be important to consistently revisit how each piece contributes to their lives getting better.   Good luck!  Org change is hard."

I think my current deck is a little too focused on the guts of the new process. I got some testimonals from my client champions in the proposal on the needs for change, but I can still shift to focus towards the benefits and the org change my client will notice when they implement this plan.

Some firms asked for transcripts/GMAT report before final rounds. Not sure they even looked at them though...   I eventually got a 760   So put it on your resume. End of story.

consulting,37gd3z,maxzl,8,Wed May 27 12:50:11 2015 UTC,"Hi - Directly involved with this sort of thing - I manage a team in what we calla 'New Business Office'. We have teams of Architects and Solution Managers aligned with clients / sectors purely with the job of writing proposals and responding to demands for incremental or new business.  In effect, we go for the standard template approach. The whole department is very, very process driven via numerous methodologies, proposal production process, review process, technology standard processes etc. There are mandated timescales and we aim to issue proposals for incremental business in 5 days or less.  Bottom line: there are pros and cons. You can tackle the factory approach and make it work well IF you are hot on your processes, and IF you have the buy in to do so from the guys who are managing the clients, and those who will be delivering the work. As long as everyone is aligned, it can work very very well. Especially if you're dealing with multiple, repeatable, common solutions.  In my experience this approach leads to quicker turnaround times, a good amount of governance and - kicker - a reduced cost of sale. The minute you approach bespoke proposals for every demand or opportunity, your cost of sale goes through the roof, overhead increases, and the effort required on every single item is silly.  Last comment might be a harsh one, but has to be said: although increased process may mean that c. 3 hours prior to deadline submission is managable, if 3 hours before the deadline is a problem, set the team an earlier deadline to allow you to review.

It's okay to use that stuff for questions that do not vary from one proposal to the next, but if the question is unique to that particular proposal, the answer should be as well.  Doesn't mean you can't crib off of a previous effort but don't just copy it, that looks lazy.

consulting,37f5zf,Sikes153,2,Wed May 27 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"I don't for a number of reasons. My PhD was free, having a b.s. in psych it raised my earning potential tremendously. I really value the science behind my work and enjoy it. The PhD allows be to focus on measurement and the psychometrics involved. I dont do what many would consider traditional mgmt consulting, I use advanced analysis to measure and make recommendations in the employement selection and assessment domain that are fair and legally defensible.

consulting,37f5zf,IOnceWasLegend,1 point,Wed May 27 12:56:01 2015 UTC,"It depends on why you are getting a PhD and what in.  Are you considering switching to academic career?  Is it just for the skills and enrichment?  My opinion is a decent PhD is a ""hard"" field like science will teach you a much more rigorous way of thinking and analysis than an MBA but most employers don't care.  In many fields consulting would't be considered relevant experience for graduate school so your BS/BA would start to look stale.  Getting into a good grad school in many fields is dominated by networking and recommendations.  You tech for someone well known, or have a notable ungrad advisor, who writes you a strong letter of recommendation, which gets you accepted to a good grad school.  It can be very difficult if you are off the academic track.  Phds are getting longer too, although they can be significantly shorter if you do them in Europe.  Unless you are in a very math heavy field, you can expect to spend 6 years getting your PhD.  Many fields also require 3 to 5 year post-doctoral fellowships after you get your PhD so you can be 10 to 12 years into a degree before you are fully ""qualified"".  I just made the opposite move from PhD to consulting.  If you have any specific questions, pm me."
consulting,37f5zf,kerneldukelacross,1 point,Wed May 27 14:32:24 2015 UTC,"It's not that employers don't care, it's that the type of analysis done by a PhD is not suited to the decision sets that a business organization faces.  Academics gather data from specific situations and try to come up with general principles.  Practitioners need to take general principles and come up with specific recommendations/actions for specific situations (on a regular basis)."
consulting,37f5zf,mitrandimotor,2,Wed May 27 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"Academics gather data from specific situations and try to come up with general principles.    I find the difference more that academics are trained to be exhaustive.  There is no ""point of diminishing returns"" where an additional control to rule out a relatively unlikely cause or correlation isn't warranted in academia.  In most business cases, you just want to get to good enough, not spend an extra 200 hours ruling out a hypothesis that has a 0.1% chance of being causal.  Your specific data -> general principles is true for academic papers but isn't really true for the academic process.  The first 1-2 years of graduate school isn't very different than a case study or engagement.  A graduate student should be reading the literature (i.e. learning general principles) and then creating a hypothesis and a plan to test that hypothesis to generate a new piece of knowledge in his field (i.e. specific recommendations and a plan of action).  The next 2-4 years is generating data and circling back to the general principles from the literature and refining the hypothesis and plan of action.  I grant you, many consultants don't hand around for the implementation of the plan but it is a good exercise in adapting to new data and requests.  It isn't just the start of grad school where this exercise occurs in academia.  There are many career transitions where you switch specialities or sub fields and start new projects using this methodology.  Consulting companies tend to hire young, early career Ph.Ds who are practiced at this process instead of the stuffy tenured Professors that most people think of as Ph.Ds or academics."

consulting,37d7z3,FaeLLe,2,Wed May 27 04:05:19 2015 UTC,At a point in time your CV gets too long to mention details such as client location. Also if y you wanted to put locations most people compartmentalize the information by specifying the scale of the problems e.g. Across 4 countries in Europe or across EMEA etc
consulting,37d7z3,QiuYiDio,2,Wed May 27 05:49:33 2015 UTC,"If in the combination thereof it becomes abundantly clear who the client is, then 100% you should not disclose that information.  ""Bentonville-based Major Retailer""; ""Armonk, NY Technology Services Provider""; etc.  This kind of description means one of two things: a) you are bad at confidentiality or b) you are oblivious to confidentiality.  Neither are good.  If you need to rely on the crutch of a toxic resume tactic just to come up with a chatting point, then you need to reexamine your interview skills.  Generating small-talk items is what the ""Community"" or ""Interest"" areas are for.  Furthermore, there are a million ways to show off your personality that don't require you to reveal potentially sensitive data.  Why would you take that risk?  Nevermind the fact that doing something like this flies in the face of what is pretty much established practice for consultants.  Also, when someone asks me in an interview where I am located, I tell them the city of my home office.  And if they asked me who my client was, or where my client is, I would 100% decline to answer.  Either they respect that or they lose my respect.  At my MBB, we don't even talk about client information on the plane or train.  It's just good business practice."

Go to www.linkedin.com/alumni and see if you can 'warm call' fellow alumni who are at firms you want to join  2)  LinkedIn - your other good option.  Just connect with people who seem like they might be favorable to having a chat.  You'd be surprised at how willing people will say yes.  And, if they are busy, worst case scenario is they click 'delete' and forget about it entirely.    Once you do get someone to chat with, obviously don't just jump off with, ""CAN YOU GIVE ME AN INTERVIEW"".  Start off telling them that you are really interested in consulting and wanted to learn more from an actual practitioner.  Through the course of conversation, try to seamlessly work in a request to connect with someone else.  For instance, if they mention that a colleague did something you are really interested in, see if they would be willing to set up an introduction.  Then do the same thing with the new person.  You'll learn a lot about consulting, the firm, and even build a little network.  With each conversation you grow more knowledgeable and you'll even start speaking like you already work there.  Each person you speak with becomes more and more impressed.  At some point, when you feel comfortable, start asking what they think the best 'next step' is for someone given your position.

I don't think it's harmful; in fact, it may be even easier for you to stand out if you do well with cases.  Most of the APDs I've mock cased were awful.  Given your background LEK Consulting comes to mind.  A good friend of mine now works there as a Life Science Specialist Consultant.  There's no travel involved and she really enjoys it.  Check it out here:  http://www.lek.com/join-lek/career-paths/advanced-degree.    When it comes to MBB project control, there are basically three levels: team, location, industry.  A few nuances:  a) Your firm has an impact on this.  Bain is somewhat more locally focused, BCG is somewhat more regionally focused, and McKinsey is somewhat more globally focused.  I say somewhat because it's relatively easy to do whatever you want after the first year.  b) Location and Industry Interplay.  If you live in DC and want to only do Tech, then you will probably be traveling a lot.  That said, if you live in Houston and want to do Oil and Gas, you probably get to sleep in your own bed.  c) At my MBB I feel like there's an equal mix of consultants who prefer one of the three.  Slight outliers are the younger people like to stick to a team they enjoying working with and the parents who want to stay local.    d) Seniority matters.  At the entry level to the Manager level, you can do pretty much whatever.  Once you get to the level right below Partner, your life pretty much goes to shit in terms of hours, travel, everything.  e) At the end of the day you will travel at MBB.  Even my financial services colleagues in NYC will be on at least one travel project a year which comes out to about 2-3 months.  This is not including flying to visit a random manufacturing plant or retail stock in Podunk, Nowheresville.  f) One except is Private Equity Group (PEG) at Bain.

I was also wondering how public holidays work, given that they vary from country to country and you are likely to be on a project during many of them (especially during the occasional bank holiday, etc.)?

consulting,37dipv,darksyn17,2,Wed May 27 05:08:59 2015 UTC,"Well there's a few combinations of whether or not the firm celebrates the holiday and whether or not the client celebrates the holiday  a) Firm Celebrates / Client Celebrates - Yay, day off  b) Firm Does Not Celebrate / Client Celebrates - Yay, day off or easy day or work from home  c) Firm Celebrates / Client Does Not Celebrate - Werk werk.  Luckily this does not happen very often.  Except when you're working with a bank or a PE.  My firm will usually give an unofficial make-up day.  d) Firm Does Not Celebrate / Client Does Not Celebrate - I guess something like Earth Day falls here.  Werk werk.  As you hinted at, the exception is the winter holidays.  Most real work stops around middle of December to beginning of January.  If you're on a project, then you do a lot of working from home these weeks.  If you're not on a project this could go a few ways.  a) Paid Holiday  b) REAL Beach Time - easier to pull off at lower levels  c) Professional Development Time - if HR catches you on the beach then you'll be doing trainings and proposals; or if you're on the cusp of a promotion you'll be doing this anyway and desperately trying to find a project  The other scary thing is that projects don't really sell in the November to February time frame.

consulting,378v3q,strnd,1 point,Tue May 26 18:57:54 2015 UTC,"Political risk:       Political risk is a type of risk faced by investors, corporations, and governments. It is a risk that can be understood and managed with reasoned foresight and investment.  Political risk analysis is rooted in the intersection between politics and business, and it deals with the probability that political decisions, events, or conditions will significantly affect the profitability of a business actor or the expected value of a given economic action   Many different meanings have been attached to the term political risk over time. Broadly speaking, however, political risk refers to the complications businesses and governments may face as a result of what are commonly referred to as political decisions—or “any political change that alters the expected outcome and value of a given economic action by changing the probability of achieving business objectives”.  Political risk faced by firms can be defined as “the risk of a strategic, financial, or personnel loss for a firm because of such nonmarket factors as macroeconomic and social policies (fiscal, monetary, trade, investment, industrial, income, labour, and developmental), or events related to political instability (terrorism, riots, coups, civil war, and insurrection).”  Portfolio investors may face similar financial losses. Moreover, governments may face complications in their ability to execute diplomatic, military or other initiatives as a result of political risk.  A low level of political risk in a given country does not necessarily correspond to a high degree of political freedom. Indeed, some of the more stable states are also the most authoritarian. Long-term assessments of political risk must account for the danger that a politically oppressive environment is only stable as long as top-down control is maintained and citizens prevented from a free exchange of ideas and goods with the outside world.   Understanding risk partly as probability and partly as impact provides insight into political risk. For a business, the implication for political risk is that there is a measure of likelihood that political events may complicate its pursuit of earnings through direct impacts (such as taxes or fees) or indirect impacts (such as opportunity cost forgone). As a result, political risk is similar to an expected value such that the likelihood of a political event occurring may reduce the desirability of that investment by reducing its anticipated returns.  There are both macro- and micro-level political risks. Macro-level political risks have similar impacts across all foreign actors in a given location. While these are included in country risk analysis, it would be incorrect to equate macro-level political risk analysis with country risk as country risk only looks at national-level risks and also includes financial and economic risks. Micro-level risks focus on sector, firm, or project specific risk.

Deloitte is also currently at 30%...MBB building out Ops, Tech, implementation, etc is in direct response to the decline of the strategy market. (decline is mostly due to market conditions, not Deloitte stealing work).   I'm not trying to argue that Deloitte is equal to MBB at all, and MBB certainly still gets the ""pie in the sky"" strategy work with CEO's....but the strategy market is changing, and Deloitte has been winning pure strategy contracts from McKinsey (according to a McK partner who is a family friend) -albeit, not the super sexy work.

Just make sure you seem excited to be a consultant; the majority of people who don't get a return are those who are miserable in the role.  We almost see it as putting them out of their misery.  Assuming you did on campus recruiting, your career management center often institutes rules that force recruiters to hold roles open until a certain date.  I would explicitly ask your career office if there is such a constraint on your company.

Most people have 3+ years experience and therefore end up in the post-MBA role.   I am relatively sure I know which program you are attending.

consulting,3748ls,ddlbb,1 point,Sun May 24 19:45:23 2015 UTC,"A couple of things:  a) Role - seems to depend a bit on your program, school, and years of previous work experience; MBAs, JDs, MDs, PhDs, generally go in at an Associate-level.  For other Masters, there is a bit of variation; I have a friend from Harvard Kennedy School who came in at the Post-MBA position, but friends with Masters in Computer Science and Masters in Statistics who are BAs.  b) Does MBB recruit from the program that you are attending?  It makes a difference; for instance, McK recruits BAs from Georgetown, but not ASCs from their b-school.  It doesn't help much if they recruit at your university but not from your program  c) If they do recruit at your program, then the quality of your undergrad is lessened a bit.  Plenty of MBAs went to mediocre schools and go on to MBB so long as they do well in the networking, case, and fit.   Frankly, the best way to address the points above and see if you can get in, is to see if other people like you from this program also got in.  So, check out www.linkedin.com/alumni and see if you have any alumni that you can reach out to.  Then, ask what their process was like.  If no such people exist, then your road becomes a bit more fraught.  You'll have to be stellar in your program (both academically and with leadership rols) and then bend over backwards on cold calls and networking."

consulting,36zqek,a1j9o94,9,Sat May 23 14:49:25 2015 UTC,"A lot of good content for someone who just finished soph year, props OP. Word of advice: even though you omitted your name (for anonymity reasons I assume) it's pretty easy to find out who you are on linkedin by just searching your school and the companies you worked for. If you want to remain completely anonymous you have to replace all the content with some sort of placeholder.  As for your resume:   I think you have enough experience that you can take out relevant coursework.  Scholarships I would take out the $ amounts, maybe keep the full-tuition amount though Potentially combine leadership and extracurriculars into 1 section called ""Leadership & Involvement"" something along those lines. It'll save space and they're all related for the most part For ZBT list them together as Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity. Recruiters will treat nationals and the chapter as essentially the same thing, not separate. Then list all the fraternity positions you held under that 1 section You seem to have done a lot of case competitions and leadership programs.  In order to condense it I'd recommend relabeling your last section as Skills, Activities, and Interests.  Then for activities list only the names of your competitions and such.  Keep the very prominent/most impressive ones in the leadership and involvement section I suggested   Don't go to 2 pages, though.  An undergrad should never have a 2-page resume.

Content Content   I personally like to divide up the positions under each organization but if you change where you put the positions in relation to the organization/company title you have to change it for everything on your resume for uniformity and that takes up more space.

consulting,36zqek,Bangkok_Dangeresque,2,Sat May 23 23:38:47 2015 UTC,Leave the SAT score on for applications you submit to MBB and other firms that mention it
consulting,36zqek,Bangkok_Dangeresque,3,Sun May 24 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, it looks like you have good experience to share, but you're:   a) jumping the gun on trying to add things that won't be started until the summer or weren't significant for the sake of namedropping, which is dubious and transparent, b) trying to cram in too much content, which drowns out your significant achievements, c) disorganized in presentation, which makes it a chore to interpret your fit from the perspective of a hiring manager   So taking each of those in turn:  a) Name-dropping and front-running   Just don't do it. You think that it lends credibility, but it really doesn't. Bain isn't going to care that you went to a two-day workshop at BCG. BCG, meanwhile, almost certainly already knows you went (yes, they have a file on you) and will wonder why on earth you have it on your resume. That's the sort of thing that is IDEAL for a cover letter to BCG. It doesn't belong on your resume.  As for front-running, this is also very dubious. The guiding principle should be that any given thing on your resume should be worth at least 5 minutes of discussion in an interview. If you can't meet that bar (which no doubt applies to things you haven't done yet) take them out. The nightmare scenario is that you're in a interview (informational or recruiting) and get asked about it, and you have absolutely nothing to say other than you applied and got it. That will be a full stop. Don't expose yourself to this kind of risk.  As a general rule, any item where the most substantive thing you can say is that you ""participated"" should not be on your resume at all. The exception to this is coursework, though as another rule you should only include courses that you did well in.  b) Cramming  There's just way too much stuff. Period. Take the time to apply the 5 minute test to every single item after the education section. Seriously. Find a quiet place, start the stopwatch function on your phone, and speak out loud about each item until you hit the 5 minute mark. Feel free to do this with a patient and willing friend, or even record it for bonus points. If you find that you can't fill the 5 minutes, or you can but only by repetition or by describing a situation rather than your actions or results, then get rid of it. There's a few items on your resume I'm suspicious won't pass this test, but I'm not in a good position to interpret.  1000% do not make this two pages. I don't know why your career services would tell you to do that. Two page resumes are appropriate for 1) mid-career professionals with significant accomplishments that don't fit neatly onto one page, 2) people making academic-style resumes for medical or academic faculty positions that need the space to list publications, 3) engineers or technical professions that need the space to describe certifications or contract work, 4) Europeans who still use a CV format, and 5) rare exceptions.  If I saw a resume of an undergrad go over the one page mark because he had 6 lines for his fraternity posts and another 5 for networking and professional development programs that he hadn't actually begun yet, I'd likely dismiss it immediately. Keep it under one page. And a breezy one page at that. White space is your friend.   c) Organization and presentation of content  I can't figure out the distinction between your work experience, leadership, and other extracurricular activities. Some appear very similar across sections. You have a volunteer position in your work section, case competitions in your leadership section, and honors classes in your other section. It doesn't seem like there was a lot of forethought put into how you want this to be read. Figure out a a real organizational philosophy, and adjust your content to match.  What I mean by that is, organize such that you're presenting a coherent case from the top to the bottom of this resume. How would you explain yourself in a paragraph, or a conversation? What are the broad strokes you'd want to hit? I imagine it's something like:  Education: ""I am an exceptionally successful student taking courses, seminars, and competing in events that prepare me well for a career in consulting""  *I study Business and Management Information Systems with a Minor in Computer Science at UGA, where I have a strong GPA  *I have earned a spot on the dean's list and a number of significant merit scholarships *I have unique specialized coursework in X, have taken honors seminars in Y, and have also been a finalist or placed well in a number of school, regional, and national case competitions in subjects 1, 2, and 3  Experience: ""I have engaged in a number of practical pursuits that have prepared me well for a career in consulting""   As an intern at a software company, I encountered X problem, did Y action alongside the CXO, which resulted in significant improvement Z At that same company, I encountered a situation A, proposed opportunity B, which resulted in success C As an technical intern at a financial firm, I encountered project A, guided a team of 7 to do action B, which resulted in success C...   Other Activities: ""I have sought out and succeeded at a number of other opportunities to round out my skills in leadership and exercise my passions for X, which demonstrate that I am a well-rounded person who is prepared for a career in consulting and life in general""   As a national officer for ZBT... I accomplished X As a Management Leadership for Tomorrow Fellow... I accomplished Y As a Leonard Leadership Scholar... I accomplished Z   My main point is, you shouldn't be bucketing things just for the sake of bucketing them. Figure out the important things that you want to say with your resume with regard to your skills, desire, and readiness for consulting. Organize around the intention of conveying those important things. And then CUT OUT anything perfunctory to telling that story. However impressive it might be, if it's a distraction to the story you want to tell, exclude it, or include it only as a reference that you can talk about if asked.  Lastly, here's some formatting advice:   eliminate hanging bullets (i.e. lines with one-three words) by reducing sentence length set a column/table divide between the bullet points and the dates/duration of activities. The overlapping of the text and timelines is ugly consider changing the font. Times New Roman, Calibri, and Arial are the business standards. Garamond looks very dated increase the font size. Your career services is right. You made it smaller so that you can fit more in, when what you should have done was leave the font alone and cut content out. Restore it to 11-12"
consulting,36zqek,LazySamurai,1 point,Sun May 24 04:06:26 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate the feedback.  For a), the main reason I put the future stuff on there was because there where a few programs I applied to recently and I wanted to make sure it included what I would be doing this summer. I was worried that it would seem like I hadn't done anything new since spring started. Since I will mostly be using this in the fall, those things should be fleshed out. I did not realize the BCG program would not be helpful for McKinsey and Bain. I thought since I was from a non target it would help to have it, but I can see your point. I would not have included it for an application to BCG. This is my general resume but I would edit slightly if necessay.  For b) and c), I definitely agree that there is to much going on here. I hadn't thought about organizing my resume based on the story I tell people when we talk face to face. I have to take some time and think about what the most important things are. I was including stuff because I thought it was impressive and not based on an overall narrative.  I do have one question in relation to your comment about the fraternity experiences. Is the national role not that big of a deal and does the local stuff not seem important. I thought that was some of my strongest leadership experience."
consulting,36zqek,doctorbadidea,2,Sun May 24 04:52:11 2015 UTC,"Nothing's wrong with your fraternity experiences per se. It does sound meaningful in substance. My point was on overall balance of content, and how your resume would appear to a recruiter in that context.   If you have a crammed resume, and 1/10th of it looks like it's under the heading of your fraternity, the details of that substance will get lost. The recruiter who reads 10 resumes in as many minutes will think it's like every other undergrad's resume that has too little to say about their work experience and too much to say about their officer position in their frat, which is often overstated (""yes, yes, it must have been very hard getting 40 dudebros to participate in that service event, good job being such a promising leader""). Play up the national angle.  I might also recommend that you lead with the position title, rather than the organization, in that section. ""National Undergraduate Supreme Councilor, Zeta Beta Tau Inc"" conveys the depth and prestige of your involvement far better than the reverse."

People don't want to read a wall of text, it should only include the important stuff. Details can be discussed later.

consulting,36uzur,Bangkok_Dangeresque,1 point,Fri May 22 19:23:09 2015 UTC,"I would assume so - you'd probably have to pay the interest yourself (if you took out loans), the company covering the advertised cost of tuition as long as you work 2-3 years with them.   However I'm sure this is something you can negotiate."
consulting,36uzur,blahblahdeloitte,1 point,Fri May 22 17:44:58 2015 UTC,"How you pay makes no difference, with the exception that if you have scholarships you just get to pocket any excess of the reimbursement over your cost of attendance as bonus.

While there are contractual clauses that are supposed to make this difficult, in reality they're just empty threats.  You should have the client who wants to hire you sit down with your engagement manager and make them aware of the offer and intentions.  Your consulting company could theoretically stop you from taking the job.  But generally the consulting firm doesn't want to piss off a client, so they won't stop you (a potential new client) from taking the job.  It'll all work out in the end.  :)"
consulting,36wy04,ederemer,1 point,Fri May 22 20:21:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding.  Yes I've seen it happen a couple of times during my time with the company and it's not been an issue at all. But my only concern is that I got promoted and received a big salary hike at the start of the year that my manager had to bend over backwards to get me. And they're really struggling to hire people to do the same role as me recently (90 interviews in the past 6 months, 2 hires). My boss can be quite an awkward man sometimes too, and quite petty/spiteful. He didn't treat a guy who left to join a competitor recently very well at all, despite the fact he had worked with him for almost 8 years.   But hey ho, I'll just be above board and honest about it and hopefully it will be ok. I'll be controlling some budget in my new role and a major influencer over where some serious money gets spent over the next few years, so it's in their interest to keep me on side.   I have another question around the process for being hired by my (current) client. Would it be the norm for me to have a contract in place with them and then resign, or would I hand in my notice and then sign a contract after that? Sorry if this is a daft question, but I've never contracted before, and I don't know if the protocol is any different than it is with perm roles. Plus the fact they're a client might complicate things as they may have a clause in the master agreement with my employer that prevents them poaching staff."

consulting,36wy04,minhthemaster,2,Sat May 23 06:45:37 2015 UTC,"I would be a little more cautious then.   If the role you're in now is part of a project that's within scope of your new role, then your consulting firm could block you from taking that role. They would essentially be giving up revenue by having that role staffed by an independent.   Maybe that's not the case...and the role is controlled by the client.  But given how you think your manager is a bit crazy, they could still make your life hell as an independent consultant."
consulting,36wy04,anonypanda,1 point,Sun May 24 00:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yes that is true. From the client's perspective, they're keeping the same resource but paying the resource direct as a contractor at c.£650 pd as opposed to through a consultancy at c.£1600 pd. Win win for them and me, the party that loses out is my current employer. My hope is that they will see the bigger picture and realise that even though they're losing £1600 pd in the short term, having me there on client side could make them a lot more in the future."

The boutique I was at would say things like when we get X big in Y years you will get Z title, which would be a crazy at a big 4 (i.e. analyst to director in 3 years) - however I noticed that in the less than 10 years the boutique has been operating, no one had ever been promoted to director - they always brought in someone else who had a different vertical that would expand the company.  I'm at big co now and I do miss consulting, but everything in general got better when I left (package nearly doubled, a lot less work, nicer people.)"

If you have a 5 year goal for example in another firm, then I would kick ass for 2 more years, apply for an MBA, and switch to whatever you want. It is not as easy as I make it sound, but that is the strongest way which generates the most options.   Can you hop from a boutique to whatever goal you have? Maybe yes, maybe no. At very senior levels it tends to be somewhat easier, but it really depends on your experience/ brand. Going into corporate makes it quite hard to exit into consulting. Not impossible, but going corp -> consulting is MUCH harder than consulting -> corp."

In some states, like CA, they are basically worthless.  I don't recommend treating this as loosely as the thread suggests unless of course you don't care and then just sign it.  Just look into it, make sure you understand your state's regulations.

consulting,36vb9b,ddlbb,6,Fri May 22 12:38:13 2015 UTC,"Just to offer a different perspective, I wouldn't bundle Deloitte S&O with the other Big4 based on my experience.  When I was going through recruiting at my college (not Ivy but similar caliber Top 20 school), I interviewed with 2 of the 3 MBB and Deloitte S&O. All of them had hard GPA cutoffs at 3.5 and most interviewees had 3.7+.   The reality is that these firms get bundles of resumes from highly qualified candidates so it gets competitive and one of the easiest ways to weed candidates is low GPAs. You have an interesting background so I would try to play up the military / student athlete angle. I would also definitely try to network hard. Best of luck!"

I actually spoke with a friend of mine from our business school yesterday who came from Deloitte and is going back after finishing up. She seemed to think Deloitte would take a more holistic approach given my background and thought their cutoff was somewhere around 3.3. It sounded like even that wasn't a hard and fast rule.  Based on my future goals and what I know about the firms I'm really targeting Deloitte, Oliver Wyman, BCG, and Bain. I definitely see that this is going to be an uphill battle, but I'd like to think it's not a done deal. I'm meeting with my Dean today to discuss my appeal of the grade. Even if it's a marginal improvement I think there's a noticeable difference between 3.0 / 3.1 and 3.3 / 3.4 but I could be wrong.  Edit: to clarify, I'm trying to achieve a certain level of branding while still going somewhere I'll be somewhat competitive with my situation. I threw Oliver Wyman up there because they've been recruiting a lot of veterans from our campus recently. They've mentioned they'll consider us earlier for promotions depending on our specific background in the military."

I'm doing an independent study over the summer which, if I do well, should bring me back to the 3.2 range. If I can get the appeal through, or get the grade changed, I may be back in the 3.3 or 3.4 range. Would this help with MBB or be a waste of time and energy? It wouldn't be easy to do, but I would certainly exhaust all of these options if that puts me back in the ring with the bigger firms."

Even if you're not all that into the program, muscle through it, deal with your first few projects, and then network to find a manager that has the work you do want to do. I know a few people who have done this. We don't all get lucky and figure it out the first time around. If you have good circumstances and can go back to school it might really help.   You could also try to get a business analyst position with a local company, work there for a few years and then apply. This happens too.

consulting,36miw7,psydoc5,14,Wed May 20 13:59:54 2015 UTC,"VCs cases on LOMS are pretty close to what you'll find in an actual interview setting. Make sure you pay attention to the last 2 cases in LOMS which are interviewer lead rather than candidate lead case interviews.  I found VC most useful for 1) how to talk, 2) how to structure your math. I also really likes the business situation framework compared to others that were offered in case in point.  Real McK interviews tend to have 4 distinct questions and I don't think Cheng follow that well on LOMS. The first question will just ask you to structure the case. Since in an interviewer lead style interview, you won't be able to jump back and modify your structure, I suggest spending a lot of time walking through your structure, making it several layers deep, and why you think each piece of requested data would be interesting/necessary.  The second and third questions tend to be so mix of business intuition and calculation questions. LOMS prepares you well for this.  Often the last question is sort of a brainstorming task which I don't recall VC discussing. For example, what are some ways XYZ might improve labor productivity? Here you can rattle off tons of ideas. You get points for creativity. Try to structure your suggestions into buckets to keep organized.  And then of course you'll be asked to summarize the case for the CEO who just walked into the room."

I will be applying for MBB later this year and am currently reading Victor Cheng's book.. it seems to be really basic and that's why I'm not sure what's the best way to prepare for these interviews..  So I would also love to hear some feedback on LOMS since I don't want to waste 300 bucks on it if it isn't any good.   Got 2 acquaintances working at MBB and both of them told me that one should first read up on the different frameworks etc. (Victor Cheng, Case in Point etc.) and then apply these techniques in partner case interviews. However, most of my friends prefer banking over consulting, which makes it hard to practice case interviews with them. Furthermore, I'm not sure whether it even makes sense to practice interviews with good friends because they simply cannot provide the same feedback a consultant from one of the top tier firms can give me.. (the problem is that I'd have to pay even more if I wanted to practice interviews with professionals.. :/ )   Hopefully someone here can give some insights and recommend the best way for practicing case interviews.."

Practicing with friends in consulting is absolutely a good idea.   Don't stress too much about how similar example cases you encounter are to McK cases. Use the broader array of case prep materials you can find, in order to master the fundamentals of case studies. McK website then has some example cases which I would say are highly representative of their interviews."

consulting,36miw7,mtheory523,2,Wed May 20 22:57:46 2015 UTC,"As a lot of people said, VC is good to get the basic ideas and frameworks. The way I prepared my interviews was to first take a look at VC then NOT use his frameworks to solve cases with friends and acquaintances. If you force yourself to not use them, you tend to focus logically at the problem at hand and end up including some of the points from VC framework.  After some time, you tend to use your own approach (not framework, but approach) to cases.   So the best advice I can give you is to take a look at VC then go buy some good notepads and do cases with friends. Carefully take note of all cases you did, what you missed, what you learned.   I did that for a couple of weeks before my interviews and ended up receiving offers from all MBB firms."

At best they can recommend you (which may not even have an impact) but personally I'd never recommend someone who I didn't know personally as a friend. A partner might be able to nudge your application along but even they are not all powerful either.   So really the recruiter is the gatekeeper.

There are more people, and therefore more potential customers, outside the first world than there are in it.  Google's search market share is sky high in many developed countries, so these other markets are where they can find growth.  In the U.S., we wired the country with telephone lines and then added wireless when that technology came along.  In many less-developed countries, they're skipping landlines and building only wireless infrastructure.    Google may be betting that the same will happen with computing devices; in which many users in emerging markets will go straight to tablet/mobile without first going through the evolution of the desktop PC.

If someone owns a Windows OS-based PC/laptop, buys a Xbox, and finds out about integration advantages of getting a Windows phone, that will surely be a highlight in getting a Windows phone. That was one reason why I got a Windows phone a few years ago.  Same can be said for Google, as they get more into the hardware business. If someone already uses their software services, like Google Cloud, Gmail, and etc., and the phones have some nice integration service or connection to those platforms, then consumers might sway to more and more Google products.

Today, Google is poised to fill in that blank.  Search: know what individuals are thinking and the trends of entire groups (cities, nations, cultures).  Gmail: with nearly 1B users this is the ""last point of data"" Google can mine what people are buying from Amazon, e-mail lists/interest they have joined.

Because of its emphasis on statistics, non-specialized liberal arts majors who likely learned about surveys, learning and applying critical thinking frameworks, and stat are primed to learn this.    Six Sigma is a methodology for analyzing processes statistically and improving them. This can be leveraged to become a project manager, process engineer, and is used by every major services corporation, but is most famous for its use in manufacturing. It's a great way to get started and provide huge value to the company you're part of. With that said, it's a little older and probably less cool at this point. Getting organizations to sponsor you is not always easy, but it's a great early differentiator from an MC standpoint."

Since IMO a good portion of the economic recovery we've seen these past few years and been through cost cutting, Lean in particular has been becoming fashionable.   IMO almost any kind of statistical experience helps. R programming, SPSS, Minitab, or experience in advanced regression/time series stuff,  can all make themselves very useful in the data portion of strategy development.

consulting,36fpfl,Gimli_the_White,2,Fri May 22 17:53:10 2015 UTC,"If you would rather work in commercial IT consulting, I would highly recommend you target that instead. I work for one of the firms you listed in your post and also live in DC. I can tell you with a lot of certainty that you'll not be allowed to do commercial projects, if we hire you into our federal division, you'd be limited to only those projects. This is due to how federal contracting works, and requires the firms to be HQ'd in the US. Deloitte is HQ'd in UK, and Accenture in Ireland. So the Federal divisions are actually completely separate subsidiaries, and by law run their own operations. This is a big obstacle for you being able to do commercial work after being hired in for federal work. Because the parent company will be the one doing the commercial work. It's all ""one company"", sure, but your options will be limited from that standpoint.    I'd also like to mention that unless you are involved in software development with a DOD-style client, you'll likely be working with older technologies or platforms. Federal acquisition regulations highly limit the feds in how they can get access to cloud, big data programs, newer (sometimes open source) platforms. So, from a personal development perspective, your MC skills are used more than your TC. TC stuff is usually limited to support and implementation of long-existing softwares, so your opportunity to fail is quite low imo.    I would recommend you apply to Accenture (anything TC), PwC (IT security) or Deloitte (cloud). Only apply to their commercial programs. You can fail safely in these large organizations, network, pick up many many skills, and take part in services like communities of practice that you couldn't find in smaller firms. Once you've developed your skillset, you can go for a boutique firm with higher salaries, but you will be less useful to them the greener you are, and any unintentional failures you have will be felt more deeply in smaller firms.     Just my two cents, let me know if you have questions. I'm a cloud IT PM and do process consulting for the federal government for one of the big firms you mentioned."

I think my only chance would be through the firms who recruit through my school. I'd like your input for this next question.  Say hypothetically I am offered a job by Deloitte Federal or Accenture Federal with a salary of 70k and Cognizant (commercial) or Infosys (commercial) with a salary of 60k. I'd want to travel in the future and not be confined to federal consulting in DC for an extended period of time. Which option would you choose to launch your career if you were in my position?"
consulting,36fpfl,SpontaneousLightBulb,1 point,Tue May 19 20:42:40 2015 UTC,"So, it's almost summer. All firms are going to be on a MASSIVE recruitment streak for their entry-level roles. I would go to whatever career fairs have your ideal companies over this summer, even if they're at other schools and you're still allowed in. Most of the time they do interviews at the fairs.    I also think your salary expectations might be a little high, but more power to you if you can swing it. At a lot of places you are allowed to apply to other open permanent positions in the company after you've been with them a year or more, but there's no guarantee they'll let you go.    I will say if you get a role where you travel weekly, you'll save huge amounts of money. And if you get to keep points (airfare, hotel, rental vehicle) it'll help your wallet out a lot.    No matter what, I'd encourage you to apply to all 4 and try to get a feel for what the roles would be like in the interview process (interview the interviewer). Unfortunately some consulting is just hiring you, then you have to find a role when you get hired (so they don't have an actual specified project role for you).    In my case, my director lied to me when I was interviewed. He just wanted me for a specific project of his because of my skillset. He explained I could do private and federal projects, but in the 1.5 years I've been here (not my first job) I've been tied to federal clients. I've been planning to leave to our parent company or the company altogether for some time now. Federal is cool if you want something stable, but when you're young it's important to grow your skillset, and I'm only able to do that in federal on my spare time. Our portfolio doesn't have particularly cutting edge IT projects for federal at this time. Just SharePoint, some cloud, COTS enterprise software, support, ServiceNow, and various types of MC work, etc.    One last point, having a security clearance is a huge draw for your resume, and remain active for years after you earn it. If you ever lost your job, you could easily get another just by having an active clearance.    On the other hand, IT is exploding, and there's plenty of cash and demand for skilled people."

Would the skills I gained from, say 3 years, in a federal IT consulting position with a well-known firm be appealing enough to a commercial firm, along with the security clearance you mentioned?

I understand that family emergencies are sometimes more important than career progression, but you want to avoid presenting a sob story to recruiters. Do some volunteer work, work in a family business etc. Have something to put on your resume since graduation, and a well thought out reason why you want to change.  From your description you should be a good big four candidate and a borderline MBB candidate. Apply to all of them? The only cost is the time taken to write an application.

Let me answer your question with another question - what type of experience would show that you're angling towards consulting? Realistically, a MBA would reset everything you've done before and give you a fresh plate to start on and a lot of consulting firms are looking for.   I'm not too sure about your interview, but the top consulting firms (MBB/Big 4) have a pretty structured way of taking applicants and they don't really deviate from it.

consulting,36d71z,thumbtack0,10,Mon May 18 13:21:34 2015 UTC,"IT Consultant here, I've spent the last 10 years or so working on large transformational ERP implementations.  I'll give you my perspective, but the actual work required fluctuates massively depending on the size of the implementation and the type of business a company engages in.    So, let's look at 1 flow when placing orders.    The software maker has decided on the best process flow when a customer places an order.  If you open the box and just install it, orders will flow like this:      Customer calls order desk  Order desk places order  Order approved by credit  DC picks, packs and ships the order  Customer receives goods and bill  Customer pays and account is updated   Simple, and a perfectly good way to run the business.  Now you speak to the business and ask them how they process orders.  They come back with:      Customer calls sales rep  Sales rep takes down order  Sales rep calls order desk  Order desk creates order, sends to sales rep for confirmation.  Sales rep confirms, and order is placed.  Order approved by credit  DC picks, packs and ships the order  Customer receives bill  Customer pays and account is updated   So, as a consultant, you notice that steps 2-5 are different than how the software works.  Now you have work to do.  You need to get specifics on this and get these questions answered:      Does the process need to run this way (it seems inefficient,) or can it be changed?  If it DOES need to run this way, how do we set up the system to do that?   In my experience, the business will start by holding fast to these requirements, and will insist that the software be configured to meet the existing requirements, and you'll start there.  You add a step in the order called ""quote"" where all the order and pricing info is available, but it doesn't go down to the DC until the sales rep confirms it.    However, as time goes on, you'll build credibility and they'll take more of your input.  At some point they'll get rid of step 5 which means you'll need to make a change.  The quote step is optional, and can be bypassed based on sales rep direction.  If the change comes early in the implementation, it's no problem.  Close to go live and it'll be deployed in phase 2.    Here we've talked about just 1 order type.  Added to this there can be ecomm orders, EDI, standing orders filled monthly and a whole host I can't add in right now.  AND there are other areas of the business that also need to be addressed.  So you start to get an idea of how massive a job this can be.    If we take this back to your original question:     Gathering requirements:  Is the process of how the business wants things to work. Configuring the system:  Is making things work that way.   In a perfect world, requirements are closed before you start config; in reality they'll overlap as the business gets more clarity on how their own processes work, and what they can change to be more efficient."
consulting,36d71z,Kayge,5,Mon May 18 16:02:46 2015 UTC,"I'm a Business Tech Mgmt grad who specialized in an ERP stream (worked with SAP) and currently work as a Technical Account Manager for a large ERP software company. What you typically will do as an ERP Consultant:   Managing the project life cycle, usually follow some waterfall methodology based off of SDLC (systems/software development life cycle) Defining as-is system (current system) and the to-be (the new system) Gathering requirements means sitting down with the client and documenting what they need, how they need it to work, review data to be imported and current business processes. Our consultants also sit down to do a business process review (i.e. how they may have their accounting functions setup or process an order). Expanding on what requirements gathering is, usually various tools are used as simple as note taking, but could be tons of Excel sheets, DB schemas, workflow diagrams, DFD, Data-Entity diagrams etc. Configuring means how they want the system work and feel (maybe they want input fields to show or be hidden or a customized workflow). Sales guys will typically sell the software to do anything and the Consultant needs to be able to manage the expectations that it really always can't. Consultants may also be responsible for training of the new system and even staying on site to give support.   There's tons of other things involved. SAP will typically make you adapt as many of your business processes to how they work (i.e oh that order process on the old system that took 3 steps? It now takes 5 steps... because SAP is ALWAYS right). Tons of documentation, coding, infrastructure issues such as network and permissions can be apart of your job. Also appropriately ""selling"" more hours is an expectation at many places.  The biggest thing most software companies who do this on their own tell me is to understand the client industry and the rest comes naturally. I believe that is true to a large extent.  GL!"

Assuming the client has bought an off the shelf solution. It doesn't take much time to do a fresh install. Trying to get an off the shelf solution to align with a client's business processes and requirements takes an inordinate amount of effort and time. When customizing you need to determine what the client wants, whether it's technically feasible, build the damned thing, pray to God that they don't change scope (they will), test it, train client to use it and so on.   I suppose one of the key reasons why cloud implementations take significantly less time is because the ability to customize is much more limited."

I'm sure a IT specialist will be able to do this better, but I'll try for you.  ERPs, in my experience are a lengthy process due to the number of moving parts.   You have to make sure that whatever is implemented meets the current and future needs of the business and the user/staff actually using it, it needs to align with business processes (what people actually do). This means you need to speak to people in the business (and sometimes external) who will use it or are impacted by it, understand their needs and how they will be impacted.    It has to be compatible with other business and IT systems so you need to make sure the data quality of those systems meets your requirements.   If there are multiple sources of the same data (which there usually is if the client is implementing and ERP) you need to make sure the data in these different sources/systems match.   You have to determine logically and politically where the single source of truth will come from.   You also have a large people component I.e. change, culture, comms, training and development, org design, capability mapping.   These are all demanding tasks and it has to be done ON TOP of the normal, day-to-day business.  There is more to it, but does that help at all?"

It's a good signal that you're a serious person and respect people you're with.  3) If you feel  overdressed for a situation, take off the jacket and roll up your sleeves.

What is your income if you get in, versus outside options? Multiply and calculate expected value.  You can also calculate the break-even ""lift"", i.e. the increase in probability the bundle would need to have to be worth it. Most likely, you'll find that even if it increases your chance of success by only a few percents, it's worth it (You'd make a lot of money over the next few years as MBB, not to mention the increase in further prospects). But then the question is whether you have that kind of liquidity at hand and how much risk-averse or risk-loving you are.   Also, how much practice do you have at this point? If it's none, your chances of success are slim even with the bundle, and very slim without it. In my experience, the beginning of the learning curve is very steep, but then it flatten fairly quickly, i.e. I'm not sure the bundle would be worth it if you already have say 10 hours of solid training behind you. If you want, you can PM me with your specifics to have a more precise opinion (I work in a boutique, but I trained with many advanced degree holders, several of which ended up in MBB).

MBA recruitment though can a bit funny and will depend largely on your school (if you are doing on campus recruitment for an MBA entry role). Experienced hire recruitment has no cycle.  Your school's career office will know when the recruitment events for each of those at your school are.   You can also check their websites. A few of the firms you mention do publish their recruitment schedules (certainly here in the UK!)

MBA recruiting will follow the same schedule for consulting. Most of the activity will be in September and October for the Big Four. Some of the smaller firms might come in late October and early November.   Short answer: plan on graduating December 2016, but get as much of your classwork done before so you have a really small class load in the Fall. If you are still working, save up as much vacation time as possible. If you can swing it, have a safety net, and a good backup plan - think about not working and committing your time to recruiting full-time."

Speaking also as a Chinese speaker, you need to figure out what does speaking Chinese bring to the table? You can communicate with businesses that operate in China.   However, how does that help a consulting company? If I'm in a large consultancy, like a MBB or Big 4, why would I need someone that speaks Chinese in the United States to advise companies based in China when I have offices in China? Especially one that doesn't have the specific knowledge about some industries, market factors, and connections that people native to the country would know.   If it's a boutique, you come across the same issue - how much of the client base are actually Chinese clients that speak only Chinese and want someone who can speak Chinese to communicate?  So the question you should be asking is, what value do you bring to a consulting firm with your Chinese ability?"

The reason I bring this up is that two of your statements about income were approximately (current salary is about $130,000; figures to about $90 an hour).  If you're going to go in to a negotiation; then you'll want to be exact.  Currently I make $xxxxxx, which is $xxxx/hour.  What I've done is figured out a rate that factors in these numbers, adds on the difference for paying for newly found expenses, management of finances (accountant, whether or not you're using one), etc, etc.  The rate that I have come up with lies in the range of $175 - $225 / hour.  The break down from there is that $225 / hour will be for xx amount of time, and of course, the more that you use my services, the more I can drop that rate closer to the $175 range.  We can work on a scale if this seems appropriate for you.  I wouldn't say things up front that lead them to believe you're unsure of your math, or rates.  But, if it becomes a question later and you aren't looking to burn any bridges, then you can fall back on statements like ""I completely understand that this may have seemed out in left field, I just wanted to be fair to both of us.  That's why I came up with the scale, etc.  If I'm to impact my current plans with school and things like that, I wanted to make sure it was worth it for both of us"".

I always thought that the firm demonstrated some of the value to the client by showing off its consultants and the fantastic backgrounds that they come from.  You may want to consider how a no-name program will look to the firm's customers and how this may potentially limit your growth.  You should also consider whether you plan to stay at that firm.  If the firm will promote you just for ticking off that check box, and you plan to stay there forever, it may be worth it as long as my first point isn't a limiting factor.  If you plan to leave the firm, you may want to consider how your MBA will provide almost zero brand value and very few networking opportunities with key professionals.  Also consider the fact that you only get your MBA once. I, personally, wouldn't want to waste my time on a no-name program that will provide less future return for my investment.

Unfortunately, as you've noticed, it means that the focus for execution comes less naturally to you.  Part of developing as a person is to not only utilize our natural cognitive functions, but to develop those that we aren't comfortable with so that we can use them day-to-day without it being so difficult. Practice staying focused on single projects and deliverables. While you will hate it at first, it will become easier as you flex it, like a muscle.  It will always be easiest for you to make use of Extroverted Intuiting (your ideation) and Introverted Thinking (your internal logic and analysis) because they are your dominant and auxiliary processes, but just as practicing presenting out loud gets you more comfortable with that skill, so will being more focused.

The 15,000 MQMs have jumped me 55,000 of 'the important miles' since last September (10+15+15+15).  Some friends have multiple cards, so they see 60,000 MQMs yearly.  ""If you're in LAX and traveling a lot, I would get the Delta Reserve Amex. It's got a hefty price tag ~ $495, but it has great benefits:  • Unlimited sky-lounge access, so free beer/food while you wait.  • Free companion ticket. If you book 1st class, the companion is 1st class as well.  • 10,000 MQMs for signing up (Delta's miles that matter.)  • 15,000 MQMs for every 30k spent up to 60k.  • Priority upgrades over people with your status level. (Ex: if you're gold, you'll be upgraded before all other gold members without the Reserve)  • Plus all the benefits of other cards (double miles, etc.)  The only few questions that would dissuade me from recommending this card are related to your company's policies:  Do they pay for your lounge access? Many consulting firms will buy your yearly membership, or reimburse each visit. Does your company offer a 'status jump'? Ex: Some friends at the big four were offered Platinum by Delta as part of their onboarding package. They had to fly 3 round trips in a month or something minimal, but the Platinum status jump is huge.  If either of the above is applicable, the Bronze card may make more sense. Typically the free companion ticket is the justification for the card itself. If you're saving money the $500 plane ticket may not be worth it. It all depends what you're looking to get out of a card."""

For example, every candidate I interview says they know JavaScript or at least jQuery (it's a flag for our HR dept).

Not so with the BRs. BR is cheaper than Tumi. Although, I found out later my firm gets a deep discount on Tumi, which would have leveled it out. BR has a better warranty. Even better, they'll just ship you any replacement parts so you don't have to ship your whole bag to a service center (except for zippers and fabric). That said, the handle assembly feels lighter-duty than the Tumi version. Really like the expandable feature on the BR. Great for long road trips or if I don't want to check, but not a big bag. U175 having half the space devoted to the suiter seemed very impractical/inflexible. The U122 fits 2 jackets and four shirts easy. Pants should go in main compartment (lay top half in first, pack other stuff, then fold pant legs over top of everything, no creases).   I went with the non-spinner.

consulting,35vzxg,mbbthrowawayyyyyy,19,Wed May 13 23:44:37 2015 UTC,"IT consultant manager level at one of the big boys checking in.  So here’s the truth as I see it.  It gets better, then it gets worse, wash, rinse, repeat.    Generally speaking, you’re at your best when you’re not really all that comfortable.  As consultants we find ourselves in one of 2 areas:  overwhelmed or bored.  The only thing worse than being in the first group is being in the second one.  We tend to rarely stop and look at where we were and how much we’ve grown, but you do.  I’ll try to illustrate with a current example:    For the past 4 years I’ve been at one client.  They’ve done a massive multi year implementation and I’ve had the opportunity to move around quite a bit, moving up as I’ve done so.  Recently, there’s been a situation where I’ve been covering for a junior resource who has been out of the office.  He is in a role that I held about 2 years ago.  So on top of the full time role I already have, I’ve been doing this job.    After about 2 weeks of coverage, I’m delivering all my scope, all his and making improvements to his delivery plans by digging into his fundamentals.  Now here’s the thing, the role was really challenging for me 2 years ago.  Fundamentally, it’s the same role, but it’s far easier now.  The only thing that’s changed is me, I’ve grown significantly but I don’t usually see it because I’m always pushing, or being pushed.    So you’re getting better, even if it may not feel like it.  I know who my best resources are, and when I see them start to get complacent or coast I give them more to do.  Those that are super-excellent at their job are usually that way because their managers know they can’t handle anymore and don’t push them.    Odds are you're performing well.  If you weren't after 6 months your lead would have had a heart to heart with you, and asked you about your workload."

Should I be? I have my first official review coming up and how happy I am at the firm is a big part of it.
consulting,35vzxg,fitzgeraldthisside,10,Thu May 14 02:20:09 2015 UTC,"I never worked at top-tier consulting firms, but I've had big enough jobs in top firms in industry to say this: never tell anyone what you're thinking. Instead, find out what THEY are thinking. Suck up. Ask senior people about the subjects, roles, or fields you want to learn. Instead of saying that you're frustrated or uncertain, talk about how you're curious and would be so grateful for their wisdom.  This is a great client facing skill to develop too. Someday, someone is going to say something so breathtakingly stupid or offensive to you that you will want to punch them in the throat. But if you can say to them with a warm smile, ""that is really interesting. Can you talk me through your reasoning so I can understand better?"" They will keep throwing cash at you or your firm and everyone will be happy."
consulting,35vzxg,Kayge,1 point,Thu May 14 03:53:26 2015 UTC,"I know this is pretty much exactly opposite what the other response says so take it with a grain of salt. But my approach - as a new consultant also some 4 months in, where there have been some tough days - is to just be honest. If someone asks me how I'm feeling about work at the moment and I'm not feeling too good, I'll say not too good.  Maybe there is some bad ""corporate politics"" in this. Maybe that means I will get less promotions and not viewed as a super stellar new hire. I just don't have the mental energy to give a damn about this. I give a damn about doing my job as well as I possibly can, but all the politics, I just don't know and care about it. Point is, it helps me to stay afloat to stay honest. If I do my job as good as I can, what more can I do? Maybe I don't have the right skills for this job, and that's okay. The vast majority of people don't. I don't go into every day thinking I'm a perfect management consultant and try to give that impression. I do my best and as long as that works out, I'm happy. If at one point it doesn't work out, I go find another job. It's just a job.  I also try to remember that at any point, any time, I can walk out the door and never see anyone at my firm again. I don't do that, because it wouldn't make me more happy. But no matter what mistakes you make or whatever shit is going on on a project, once you walk out that door, it does not matter any more.  As a final note, my impression has been that once you get people talking, almost everyone has a rough time in the beginning. For reasons that probably have to do with politics, people are reluctant to talk about this. But under the right circumstances, I've heard lots of people talk about how hard they thought it was to begin with."

I've got some senior people I can commiserate with, but I know who they are and when I can and when I can't.  If you're really having an issue, bring it to them.  If you give them feedback on issues only when THEY ask YOU, all you've done is shoot yourself in the foot by making yourself the unhappy consultant (no one remembers all the ""I'm doing fine"" answers.).   The last thing I'll say is to give specifics and ask for specifics.  If you say you're miserable, that's all people will hear.  If you're having a problem with client X because she does Y, ask for advice.  You may get something that will make your life better AND you're telling your manager that things are shitty."
consulting,35vzxg,Benjithedoge,3,Thu May 14 11:33:46 2015 UTC,"Almost every single person I've talked to in my firm (MBB) went through that case that tore them apart - usually first or second case. I went through it on my second case - it felt like I couldn't do anything right, was letting down my manager, and was told very directly that I needed to improve or life was going to get hard for me. Not doing good at the work means not enjoying the work and it cycled to mean a very stressful 3 month project.  But, at the end of the project, when I started my next case, I realized that I had finally figured out how to do my job, and I made some really good impressions with my next team. As long as you keep learning along the way you'll end up in a place where you have higher quality work, which means more control of the work (both hours and type of project). You may not end up loving consulting in the end, but things get a lot better after the first 6 months"

It's just not a supportive place. It's cutthroat competitive by nature. You're doing the right thing by not going to your coworkers but finding help here is also going to be tough. Secondly, you don't have to do it forever. Most people don't. Try to find your niche, ride it out as long as you can take the pressure, and by then you should have your pick of cushy industry jobs.

She made it to the final interviews but would be working in research instead.   A gloom was about her, but she worked hard in her new task. The days went by slowly as she feebly  hoped that one day she would have a chance to shine.   One day, Elle's fruitphone chimed. The lead of an overstretched team asked Elle to present her research at a big, important meeting to a big, important client. She finally had her chance, and she impressed everyone at the big, important meeting. Soon, she found herself in more meetings and working more closely with the consultants. After many more months, she finally was offered a chance to join the consultants.  However, Elle's story did not end there. Soon after becoming a consultant, her benefactor left and she was put on project in industries far out of her comfort zone. Elle stumbled frequently and lost her confidence.  Her new consultant colleagues started to wonder if it was a good to ever let her leave research. At home, Elle cried frequently to her mother. Her masters gave her an unsatisfactory rating. The gloom was about her again.  Blah, blah, too lazy.

It's a challenging field; you often have to teach yourself new concepts you know nothing about.  It's not easy.  There are times (hopefully, only occasionally) that you make personal sacrifices for professional gains.    You do need a certain tenacity to break though in this profession.  a 'Fall down 7 times, get up 8 times' attitude is definitely a must.  But when you finally figure something out, and finally take control of project, it feels so good.  I've also found/seen that once you make your 'break through', things kind of snowball.  Once you figure out how item 1 works, you figure out item 2 in half the time of item 1, then item 3 in half the time of item 2.    The major thing that has helped me was my social support system.  I've met some of my best friends at work. Whenever I'm down on work, I can always talk to them.  If I need a break, I'll swing by and say hi to one of them. It makes life much better."

Family friend works at the Boston office of this firm, and he knows the head of the Madrid office, so he put us in contact. I met with the director and he said why not, we'll give you an interview. Up to that point I figured my ""success"" was just as a favor to this family friend, but then I was invited to the second (and final!) round of interviews. That, plus the little things, like being given a younger contact at the firm to ask questions (some firms call it a ""buddy,"" I've read), and the many conversations with their head of human resources about how to handle extending my legal residency in Spain, made me feel that they were actually taking me seriously. What a relief that was!  So now I'm of the mindset that it'll be significantly harder to get the first interview than the second (though the latter will be quite a challenge in its own right).

That's why this is a networking game. If you're not currently graduating from a target school, or have a stellar resume with industry experience, networking is really the only way to get your foot in the door.  FWIW if you're not an EU resident and your work visa is tied to teaching English then there are many hoops for them to jump through to hire you in Madrid. So you figured out you're competitive, just not in a foreign market. You might have to start out stateside (assuming you're American) and then transfer to Europe after a year or two."

consulting,35w5ol,cliffg,2,Thu May 14 02:13:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this question. I believe my function makes/saves money because it automates manual reporting, freeing man hours for more useful tasks that are more productive for growth than reporting.  The data background drives my desire to analyze clean data. Automation via databases is not only more powerful than excel, it creates standardization in reporting  which creates better visibility to opportunities. This gives leadership more clear and consistent reporting to make better business decisions which increases the bottom line.   Real life example:  In one of my roles as a pricing analyst  I inherited a pricing model that was completely offline. There was no consistency in how often data was updated and sometimes modes were created with commodity costs that were months out of date. The ERP was SQL based.  I created a reporting server then extracted pricing data (avg cost and standard cost)  that I linked via an ODBC cube. Now all models have live pricing at all times and with better line of sight to standard costs that are now being updated more consistently. (Quarterly.)  Using the reporting table I'm also able to query transactions by commodity code and compare them to standard costs and send supply chain volatility reports to make them aware of costs outside a set threshold.   In another role I worked directly alongside client teams to build pricing and budgets for marketing projects. I worked with the business leaders to create their budget, and build their margin into their pricing.   I've built budgets, forecasts, and I use data to create scenarios and support my hypotheses.   My biggest problem tends to be how broad I make my role. I struggle to focus on just one thing and therefore when it comes to explaining it, I come off as all over the board.   Edit: my ability to manipulate data scales fairly well. When I worked in the mortgage industry I created a cost to service model that drove bidding on MSRs for FNMA/ABS loans. I was able to break down servicing costs by delinquency, and type of loan. (ABS/MBS)."

In my opinion, between MS Outlook, OneNote, and Excel, there should more than enough to keep you organized.  Depending on the number of projects you take on, meetings you have scheduled for the week etc. most of it should be able to organized with Outlook using email folders, task notifications and the built in calendar.  Since you can't access cloud based solutions, this will probably be the  best solution without having to purchase and test new software.  Using excel, you should be able to easily setup a Gantt Chart to track project timelines and actionables. There are a lot of resources online that'll show you how. Ex/ http://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Gantt-Chart  Once you setup a timeline, you can then build in a status and notes column to keep you updated on the tasks.   If you have multiple projects running at the same time, you can easily setup something in OneNote to keep track of key dates, meeting notes, etc.  I know you mentioned OS X, i'm sure you can find simliar software if you dont have access to the Office suite."

Although the interview process is probably different in other countries, I will try to describe my phone interview as detailed as possible:  First of all, I had to guide the two interviewers through my CV in English (since I am from Germany, the rest of the interview was in German).   Afterwards, they asked me the basic motivational questions: Why CC and not another consultancy?? Why Finance Transformation/ (the field you are applying for)? Why consulting?  Other questions were: Please structure the process of a consultancy project in different phases and explain these different phases.  Furthermore, I was asked to explain some basic accounting stuff (e.g. difference between accruals and reserve assets, etc.) and they tested my knowledge on current news..   Finally, my interviewers read out a mini case to me, which I had to solve in 5-10 minutes.. it was a guesstimate question and the best way to prepare for these mini-cases (imo) is to read up on some brain teasers and learn methods on how to approach estimation questions.   However, I also heard that the interview process differs a lot based on your current education level. Since I am only a second semester undergrad student, the questions were probably different from the ones a master student gets asked (if you are a master student be prepared to be asked questions on your master thesis for example).  All in all, the interview was about 1 hr long and was a really pleasant experience because the interviewers were extremely friendly and managed to create an enjoyable atmosphere.

At least where I work, it is absolutely nothing to do with internal audit as some people here suggest.  I think where people are getting confused is that many Big4 firms have an ""Enterprise Risk Services"" division, which does things like IT security, penetration testing and other services which look a bit like internal audit. ERS usually fits within the audit part of the firm.  However, each of those Big4 firms will also have a Risk & Regulation (or similarly names) department in their consulting division. Completely separate to ERS - nothing to do with each other. This, to me, is what risk consulting is. It focusses mainly on financial institutions and how they measure and manage their risk - things like credit, counterparty and market risk. In recent years, though Basel 2.5 and 3, and in upcoming regs like FRTB risk and regulation are highly joined. Then you can have things like BCBS239 which is very data led, but still very much about risk reporting, data and aggregation."

consulting,35qryz,shemp33,3,Wed May 13 00:44:15 2015 UTC,"I currently work at the Big Gay Magazine and I'm in their Adivsory group. It's very rare that they hire recent grads for a Staff 1 position in the consulting groups. A lot of the time what happens is you come in and do Regional Advisory work for 2 years which is internal audit co-sourcing, IT audits, SOC reporting, and occasionally you might have the opportunity to do an SDLC review.   Then once you're a Senior 1 you can transfer to the National Advisory practice which is where all the ""real"" consulting happens, Systems Implementations and Process Improvement type work. But there is a caveat, you need to network with the right people to get the opportunity to transfer. You need to find the right people, attempt to roll off of your current clients and make a case for why you should be allowed to transfer.   It's a lot of work and I'm finishing the process now. If I didn't start networking from Day 1 I'd probably be stuck doing IT Audits and SOC reports for the remainder of my career there. Don't buy into their bullshit about how easy it is to switch groups or do rotations in other practices. I believe someone else already said it, they're not going to let their high performers leave and the other groups aren't going to take mediocre people in.  Frankly, it's been more trouble than it's worth and I've been looking to make my way out, but it is an excellent place to start your career. A lot of exposure to Fortune 500 companies, a lot of team projects, and a lot of future opportunity by having the name on your resume."

I understand that the brand is excellent to have on my resume, but even my mentor (who is a senior manager in the Audit group at Gay Magazine) has told me that I wouldn't be missing out on too much work wise if my interests are in consulting. I feel as if I focus hard this Summer on networking and case studies, I could really lock in a fulltime position come Fall recruitment, but as others have said in this thread, it might be a bad idea since I'm giving up an offer for technically nothing. I do have enough projects/work to do until the Fall to keep myself busy though. Would love your opinion!

I'd tend to agree with him. My understanding of what the Financial Audit team does is that they work closely with the Business Process owners and have excellent understandings of business process, but that's about it as far as transferable skills go. I myself am on the IT side of audits so I have both a technical knowledge and business process knowledge through application control testing. In your position I don't think that it's worthwhile knowledge if you goal is ultimately to be in consulting. If your concern is having a job when you graduate then there's a lot to weigh, but at the end of the day it's your decision and you have to do what you feel is right.   how feasible is transferring into the PI group   So the PI group does actually hire staff right out of college. The particular group I've transferred to is IT Risk Transformation, which also falls under National Advisory, but they don't hire direct from school. Gay Magazine doesn't do a good job of describing the way service lines are broken out so be very careful to read what you are signing up for. Is it National Advisory (i.e. PI, IT Risk Transformation, Cyber) or is it Regional Advisory (i.e. Risk Assurance)?   My biggest fear is to pidgeon hole myself into Audit.   This was my exact same fear. Audit is boring, the only thing that changes is the client, but they all follow the same SOX 404 guidelines, so it's literally the same shit different day. And if you're an unfortunate soul in Financial Audit you may be on one big client and you never get to experience anything else. I don't know how easy it is for people in Financial Audit to transfer to PI Finance, but when I was brought in this year as a Staff 2 experienced hire, a lot of the experienced hires I met in PI came from financial institutions or other consulting firms.   I wish you the best of luck!   Thank you! If you have any other questions feel free to ask."

consulting,35qryz,Kazi1776,1 point,Wed May 13 16:25:45 2015 UTC,"How difficult would it be to get into a tier 2 firm as a graduate? Would I still be considered a campus hire?   I think most of them look for GPAs above a 3.2 so you're probably in good shape in that regard, but a lot of what they look for is how well you fit into the culture and your GPA is just a qualifier. I think you would still be considered a campus hire. They're interviews are pretty standard too, you have the HR sanity check, a technical interview over the phone, and then the final round is typically with 2 or 3 Sr. Managers/Partners where they test your technical skills, sometimes there is a case study and there is definitely a personality screening by a Sr. Manager/Partner.    Is it just unwise to give up a concrete offer for a chance?   I can't make that decision for you. I think a lot of people consider their amount of student loan debt, how much Mom & Dad can help them, will you be living at home or on your own, and other expenses. If you're gonna live at home and have no expenses then I might consider reapplying in the Fall, but if you take a job AND live at home then that's a lot of money you're saving or putting towards paying down loans.   would they look down on me if I reapplied in the Fall for the PI group?   The short answer is no. The people looking at your application would be completely different. Each service line has their own HR support so the people who saw your application for Audit more than likely would never see your application for Advisory/PI. Although if you were made an offer for Audit, it might help you to mention that you've applied once before because then they know that someone has already vouched for you."

What are you doing now/plans for the future?  2) What's a mid-sized office like in terms of lifestyle/travel vs. an office in a major city?  3) What do you know about McKinsey's BTO practice? How are hires typically sourced? Is career progression similar to traditional business analysts?
consulting,35nl2n,SurfTacoEnthusiast,11,Mon May 11 23:50:18 2015 UTC,"1) Why did you decide to leave? What are you doing now/plans for the future?   A wide variety of reasons. Part of it was disillusionment/burn-out. Part of it was that my young age was making my life in consulting harder than it needed to be. I also wanted to get out and try something else out for a change.  I actually left because I had achieved DTA (a big objective for me) and I'd finally come up with a fantastic idea for a business. I started that business summer last year and I've been running it since. It's starting to wind down now; afterward I'm going to see if I can get into venture capital, preferably seed/early-stage.   2) What's a mid-sized office like in terms of lifestyle/travel vs. an office in a major city?   Hard to compare it to other cities since I didn't spend much time at other offices. Personally, I didn't get involved in my office culture. I actually didn't step foot in the office for about 6 months before I left. Culture was better when I joined, but for some reason died off ~1 yr. Toward the end, there was probably <25% occupancy on a given Friday.  I know some offices have no real community. Manhattan, for instance, does not have assigned desks below the partner level. You're not really expected to show up. Other offices have much stronger cultures with 50-75% attendance on an average Friday. It depends a lot on the office.  The one really strong community at my office was the BAs. I didn't end up getting involved for a variety of reasons, but they did stuff together just about every weekend and went on trips together.   3) What do you know about McKinsey's BTO practice? How are hires typically sourced? Is career progression similar to traditional business analysts?   As I expect you know, BTO focuses on technology work. I'd struggle to define their work much better than that (and I'm sure the McKinsey website can do better). I can tell you that as a practice it is fairly isolated from the rest of the firm. I only met BTO folks (of which there were quite a few) a couple of times in my office.  The plus side to that is that you end up with a smaller, tight-knit community that you're a part of. Also, you focus pretty much solely on BTO work. So if that's what you want to do (and/or you have a background it int), it's a terrific opportunity.  Because BTO's recruiting team is proportionally smaller, they focus in on a smaller set of target universities. They still have their fingers in the rest of McK's targets, but a lot of people can slip through the cracks. I helped with general recruiting from my school and we were supposed to pass on likely candidates to the BTO recruiter, but we didn't always remember to.  Career progression is the same. Also, people tend to say that BTO is not as respected from a prestige standpoint. Horse shit. You don't even have to tell people that you're part of BTO when you're leaving and applying for other jobs. You'll still be doing plenty of strategy work."

Not OP on this but wanted get some feedback regarding tech in consulting.   Background: Just graduated w/ a public policy degree from a target school but dicked around so have a low GPA. Good public policy internships in my junior summer. Will start working at ACN in systems implementation (SI) in the fall.   The ACN role sounds similar to McK BTO but my impression from /r/consulting and school friends is that there will be no strategy work done in SI. Also from /r/consulting, it would be difficult to make the jump internally from ACN's SI to strategy team. I'm still very unsure of my 5 year plan and haven't really narrowed down my interests yet. Long term, here a couple of paths that I'm interested in:   strategy work in consulting or industry public policy work; more interested in regulation, gov't relations, communications consulting than non-profit/Capitol Hill stuff working in something more creative but on the business side (e.g. marketing) grad school: MBA, JD, or Masters of Public Policy (MPP) - MBA would be to career pivot, JD and MPP - both would help in policy work   To be honest, I've never been super great at quant stuff and that makes me question how well I'd do in strategy or just even getting into a MBA school. Although I am thankfully not an unemployed recent grad, I feel anxious about what direction to take, how to end up along those pathways, and knowing myself enough to make big decisions like you did (e.g. leaving McK and starting your own business). Any advice?"
consulting,35nl2n,beer_warriors_ghost,2,Tue May 12 13:57:31 2015 UTC,"You're a little all over the place. Try to structure and simplify your thinking a bit. It's okay to not know what you want to do, but not even being able to structure it into clear options doesn't help.  If you do want to get into top tier consulting then business school is definitely your best route. Kick ass for a couple of years in your current job and get into a top b-school. That opens up all kinds of doors.  I will say that McKinsey is a great place to be if you're not sure what you want to do. They do plenty of public policy and ""creative"" business work. If you push for it then you'll be able to have those experiences without committing to something like a 2 year masters or a 3 year JDA.  It's hard to give you advice to go one way or another because it just depends entirely on you. Business school is nice because it gives you more options. A JD is pretty limiting in that regard. The MPP doesn't really close any doors, but it's a complete waste of time and money if you don't end up in public policy.  I will say that you don't have to be super quant focused to be successful in business school or in business. There are plenty of people who get by on their people skills or other non-quant problem solving skills."

Recruiting is done on a by-school basis. The business school at my university isn't top tier, so most of the other folks applying were also engineers.  I'm biased here, but I'd say engineering undergrad just makes you generally much sharper than a comparable business major. You should be better at the math and more complex problems. Of course the downside is that you may be less familiar with business terminology and issues. You have to make up for that with internship experience and practice.   What do you think it was that set you apart from other candidates during the hiring process which got you the job?   There's an implied question there that I ""beat"" the rest of the candidates. That's not really how recruiting works at McKinsey. There's a threshold that you have to exceed. If 20 candidates exceed that threshold then they'll hire all 20. If 0 do then they hire 0.  That being said, I just had a very balanced profile. Good school, great major, good GPA, great test scores, good work experience, entrepreneurship experience, founded a club at my university, into sports, exec in another club.  Of course, all of that is just enough to get you an interview. At that point, the stuff on your resume pretty much doesn't matter at all."

The exposure to incredible business problems and senior executives.   I'm surprised to see your comments on your age limiting your ability to work with senior clients? Do you think this was driven by the industries you served? Or specific to the client?   It was too prevalent to be industry or client-specific, unfortunately. I'd say the 50+ year old executive willing to engage with a 20 something on equal footing is the exception, not the rule.   Why not do your year as a sr. asc and get designated EM before leaving?   Slippery slope and burn out. It's easy to then justify another 2 years to hit AP. And I'm honestly not sure that I could've done another 12 months without blowing up.  Also, strangely, EM is not a ""hard"" transition. You actually start EMing well before you're designated in any official capacity. There's also no pay bump. EM's are paid on the same pay scale as associates."
consulting,35nl2n,IMNOTJEWISH,4,Tue May 12 01:38:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for doing the AMA. I am a PhD candidate at a top ten engineering school and would be applying to McKinsey next year. My questions are:   What are some things I can do in graduate school that could help me get to an interview? I was very active in student organizations during undergrad and held leadership positions. Not so much in grad school.  What are the most common weaknesses that you see in APD candidates who interview with McKinsey? What strategies did you try to avoid burn-out? What worked? What did not?
consulting,35nl2n,IMNOTJEWISH,5,Tue May 12 02:42:08 2015 UTC,"What are some things I can do in graduate school that could help me get to an interview? I was very active in student organizations during undergrad and held leadership positions. Not so much in grad school.   While being less involved in club leadership in grad school is understandable, it's not going to win you any points. You've just got to look for opportunities to step up. Clubs are obviously an opportunity. Maybe a lab in your school (depending on major)? Internships, if you're doing them. Maybe organize a small conference in your discipline? Unfortunately there's no magic answer here.   What are the most common weaknesses that you see in APD candidates who interview with McKinsey?   I never did APD resume screening or interviews, so I can only speak to it indirectly. Lack of understanding is the #1 problem. Academic-minded PhD's can find themselves in the process without a clue to what's going on. They'll treat McKinsey (or Bain/BCG) as just another job. Fair or not, you can't go to a McKinsey recruiting event and ask a consultant what it is their company does.  A lot of PhD candidates are, unsurprisingly, single dimensional. They have very impressive academics and research work within their discipline, but haven't taken the opportunity to branch out in their experience or step up into leadership roles. While that is typical and expected of PhDs, McKinsey isn't looking to hire ""typical"".   What strategies did you try to avoid burn-out? What worked? What did not?   Minimizing/eliminating weekend work was probably #1. There were probably 2-3 instances in my 3 years where I had to do more than 1-2 hours of pre-week prep work on Sunday night.  Fridays are a great opportunity to cut back on unnecessary stress/work. Since you're back in your home city, expectations (depending on project) are generally less. Don't kill yourself just because you feel you should.  Getting enough sleep and getting to the gym regularly are both really important. They can be tough to do, but in general people will be understanding.  Really, the most important thing is finding people you like working with and projects that you'll enjoy. Once you get those two things right, the rest kind of falls into place."
consulting,35nl2n,stuckinhyperdrive,3,Tue May 12 04:17:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for your detailed answers. Great to hear that you were able to minimize weekend work. You mentioned in another answer that you are very efficient. How did you get there? Was this from before you joined McKinsey or is this something you focused on there?
consulting,35nl2n,bmethrowaway11,2,Tue May 12 05:22:42 2015 UTC,I think it's a personality trait of mine more than anything else. I'm exceptionally lazy. I can't stand doing unnecessary work. Combine that with ambition and a drive to succeed and you end up with remarkable efficiency.  The skills I developed while at McKinsey were just specific to how to do the most impactful work in the least amount of time. A lot of that is the soft skills of being able to identify what's important and being able to tell people that what they want is not important (much easier said than done). But being able to work quickly in Excel and Powerpoint helps a lot.
consulting,35nl2n,bioscientist,1 point,Tue May 12 05:45:25 2015 UTC,"I'll add my question here, since I'm an APD as well.  I'm a JD at a T14 school that has a M7 B school. I had an interview for a summer position this past winter cycle, but got rejected after 2nd round ( passed the group interview and PST). They told me I lacked entrepreneurship experience in my PEI and I messed up on a brainstorming portion of my interview. Three questions: 1) is the full-time interview cycle any different than the summer associate interview cycle?  2) I'm starting a company this summer, but I'm not sure I'll have results to talk about during an interview In the fall, as that only gives me a couple months. Should I rather mention a previous entrepreneurial venture I had, which I mentioned during my interviews, but just try to portray a much stronger entrepreneurial feel? If so, do you have any guidance for how to emphasize entrepreneurship in a PEI?  3) if you know any pure JDs at mck, do you know how they fare in terms of performance and promotion?

consulting,35nl2n,candidate1611,1 point,Tue May 12 20:44:56 2015 UTC,"1) is the full-time interview cycle any different than the summer associate interview cycle?   I only did BA recruiting, so I'll have to answer to that and hope that it's similar. Summer BA recruiting is slightly more rigorous than full-time. This is because the students don't have as long to develop their resumes/experience and because the vast majority of summers end up with offers. We'd often ask candidates who didn't get through the final round of summer interviews to reapply for full time the next year.   2) I'm starting a company this summer, but I'm not sure I'll have results to talk about during an interview In the fall, as that only gives me a couple months. Should I rather mention a previous entrepreneurial venture I had, which I mentioned during my interviews, but just try to portray a much stronger entrepreneurial feel? If so, do you have any guidance for how to emphasize entrepreneurship in a PEI?   ""Entrepreneurship"" as such is not what they're looking for in the interview. Try to distill that into a more concrete value: leadership, initiative, risk-taking, etc. Figure out where your last story was lacking and figure out the best way to supplement. It's impossible to say which story you should go with because (1) I don't know the stories and (2) the answer will depend on exactly what you're asked. At least let your venture this summer play out before trying to decide between the two.   3) if you know any pure JDs at mck, do you know how they fare in terms of performance and promotion?   I know several and they do just fine. Pre-McKinsey experience matters much less than at-McKinsey performance. In general, JD's have good client skills and abstract problem solving, but struggle with the quantitative analytics."

McKinsey is hard to get into. Like less than 1% of applicants are hired hard. Even if you have the remarkable resume to get yourself an interview, you're still only looking at something like 10% odds. People rightfully take pride in having landed such a coveted position.  Once you're at the Firm, everything just reinforces the elitism. I was being billed out at over $400 an hour when I left and I was worth it. Yes, this has more to do with the training and support structure of McKinsey than it does with my intrinsic value, but it's hard not to let something like that go to your head.  As a McKinsey consultant your days are filled with meetings with senior corporate executives, working on problems that relatively few other people in the world are capable of understanding, much less solving. Your evenings are then filled with team and client dinners that can easily exceed $100 a head (or well more). Again, it's hard not to let those things go to your head.   any fun stories to tell about particular characters or personalities you met there?   Unfortunately, elitism/snobbishness isn't that fun =\. This one douche bag at a recruiting event made fun of the Deloitte representative because he was fat. In general, we'd all make fun of lower tier consultants who operated on a per diem instead of reimbursement. There's a lot of looking down on travelers without status on airlines or at hotels.  One of the most nefarious forms of elitism is the general feeling toward sub-executive clients. These folks have spent years and years doing honest work to get to where they are, but there's always the nagging thought in the back of the consultant's mind that he/she would never settle for a role like that.  On the personal side of things, I really miss being able to order 2-3 $10+ scotches with dinner every night."

consulting,35nl2n,ZeGoldenLlama,6,Tue May 12 13:43:23 2015 UTC,"There's no simple answer. It might be better to think of it as ""speaking the truth as you see it"" is important. In a way, disagreeing with someone and not speaking up is lying. As a top tier consultant, there is an obligation to give your clients the best advice you can. Avoiding doing so in order to not hurt their feelings is an ethical violation.  It's not uncommon to enter a client situation in which a majority of the organization's problems stem from bad leadership. A hallmark of bad leadership is silencing dissent. In these situations, McKinsey can blow through a decade-old roadblock simply by speaking the truth. If done improperly (or even not), this can result in that study being the last for McKinsey at that client. You can imagine that prospect is very intimidating for anyone, let alone a BA six months out of undergrad. That is why McKinsey makes it clear that you have to speak up if you feel it's appropriate."

People get mad at consultants for not speaking directly, but I can speak from experience: I got torn apart for the way I spoke for the first few months. Frank speech has its place, but it's a nuance that has to be learned after a general reserve is cultivated.  Of course you're going to learn Excel. It's impossible to get 12 months in without becoming an Excel master (short of array formulas and VBA, which there is a support group for). Similar story for Powerpoint.

I am a rising senior at a target business school with a 3.7 and more specialized consulting internship this Summer. I wasn't able to get an interview this past year and was wondering how to up my game for Senior year, especially since I have heard that it is a different ball game. Specifically:   When is the best time to start networking? Roughly how many practice cases did you do before going in to your interviews? Any tips to make these more effective? I know you mentioned doing them with current consultants, is it acceptable to ask them to do a case with you while networking?"
consulting,35nl2n,dgmna,7,Tue May 12 04:35:06 2015 UTC,"When is the best time to start networking?   Honestly, it's very unlikely to help you at networking. I mentioned this somewhere else, but networking can only help you get an interview. At a target, it's unlikely to even do that. Just show up to the recruiting events and leave a positive impression.  If you just really want to get to know some consultants, then just hit them up around recruiting season (early fall semester).   Roughly how many practice cases did you do before going in to your interviews? Any tips to make these more effective? I know you mentioned doing them with current consultants, is it acceptable to ask them to do a case with you while networking?   I probably did around 20. I at least read through all of Case in Point and did the cases on the McKinsey website. I definitely didn't overdo it. I was actually planning on going to grad school and kind of just stumbled upon McKinsey. Didn't even apply to Bain/BCG.  Yeah, the biggest thing is just doing the cases with folks who know what they're talking about. The feedback they'll give you is just so much more valuable. Asking people you're networking with is somewhat borderline. If you know them personally, generally they won't mind. If you're reaching out with a cold contact then they may be annoyed.  Beyond that, they're technically not supposed to give you any practice cases around the actual recruiting season, so convincing them to do so will be an uphill battle."

I can tell you that consulting was 100% the right way to go for me. I would have killed myself in the bureaucracy of a typical fortune 500 (I learned this quickly in my internships).  Assuming the industry you're interested in as a major one, all of the big consulting firms will be active in it. It'll take about 12 months, but you can align yourself so that you're doing 80%+ of your work in that industry.  What are your long term plans? What are you looking for in a job?"

Would you recommend specializing on an industry (Financial Services, Government, Consumer Goods) or a functional practice (M&A, Marketing, etc.)?   That's the secret... most people end up at McKinsey because they don't know what they want to do. You don't have to worry about seeming directionless because the assumption is that you are. If you're 100% certain of what you want to do in life, there's a good chance that consulting is not the absolute best way to get there.   What are some of the key differentiators (aside from slight geography biases) between different industries?   Tough question, since they're all different. I loved petrochemicals for the complexity and logic of the feed stocks (the ""ingredients"" for the product) and their respective markets. I really like high tech since it has the potential (and repeatedly does) change the world almost over night.  I know other people who were incredibly passionate about agriculture and retail apparel. I have no idea why. It's the kind of thing that everyone has favorites of, and the reasons don't really matter that much.   Do you think that people who spend their time in certain industries are looked on more favorably for promotions (or perhaps those industries allow those people to perform better/be promoted easier/faster), etc. than people in another industry or functional practice?   Specializing in an industry as a BA makes you the very rare exception. You can become a director at McKinsey without ever doing so. Senior EMs have to begin to develop a ""platform"" (basically their value proposition to McKinsey and the clients), which can be an industry focus. But it can also be a practice (finance, operations, technology, etc.) or something else entirely.   The 3rd year specialized programs sound very interesting. Do they predominantly feed into any of the ""next steps"" for BAs (grad school, exit, direct promotion)? What are some big benefits of the programs? Any drawbacks?   Staying longer than 2 years is contingent on being in good standing (AKA getting an offer for grad school funding), so the BA can go do that at the end of it. It's actually a great way to stick around for another couple of review cycles if you're gunning for DTA but couldn't quite hit it at 2 years.  A lot of people use the 3rd year fellowship to either move to another country (Japan was popular for some reason) or specialize in something they're interested in (again, either industry or practice focused). There's even a small number of fellowships for really interesting internal programs: assistant to the Managing Director, a position at McKinsey Global Institute (MGI - the internal research arm), etc."

From there, things get much easier.  Beyond that, very rarely a senior partner (head of a practice) at a lower-tier firm will get hired in straight as a partner. That's only done for very specific skills and networks though.  More applicably, it is theoretically possible to get 1-2 years of consulting experience and reapply as a BA to a top tier firm.

How would one be perceived if she/he is 100% honest about leaving the firm after a few years?   Just to clarify, the high attrition rate has more to do with self-selection than ""up or out"".  Anyway, candidates are not generally asked the ""where do you see yourself in 5 years"" question in the McKinsey interview process. Part of it is that they understand a lot of people don't want to be at McKinsey in 10-20 years. A lot of it is that the type of candidates they're looking at are going to be achieving in 5 years regardless of what they choose to do.  100% honesty probably isn't the exact right tact. It makes a lot more sense to frame it as ""I'm not sure exactly what I'll be doing, but I don't see myself as a partner at the Firm"" or something like that. If you definitely know you want to be doing something else, make it about that other thing and tell the story of how McKinsey is helping make that happen for you.

Also, could you comment on what the passing rate or the threshold % score is depending on whether PST is used for relative/absolute evaluation?   I was not aware that they had, so clearly I can't speak very intelligently to that :).  From my time, there was no passing score or threshold. It's just one variable in the equation. If I remember right, anything above a 20 out of 30 was a good score. Anything below a 15 was pretty bad.  Anecdotally, I know that I got a terrific score on my PST. I strongly believe that helped my interviewers ignore some less-than-stellar answers.   Could you comment on the dress code for female consultants?   Depends a little on the client, but business casual is typical. Business skirt or pants. Nice blouse. Jacket is optional (unless the blouse is sleeveless). Business-y dresses can work well if you accessorize properly.  Shoes should be relatively boring... flats or heels (less than 3""). Black, grey, tan, whatever matches your outfit. Purse should be business-y.  If you really want an in-depth conversation, PM me and I'll figure out how to put you in touch with my fiancee.   Does your earlier description of work hours (40-80hr/wk) include traveling or not?   Um... kind of? Here's a typical week:  Monday: Wake up 5-5:30 am, in cab at 6. Flight at 7:30. Hit client site at 10:30. 30-45 minute lunch. Leave client site at 7, grab dinner. 2-3 hours of work in the evening.  Tuesday/Wednesday: Hit client site by 8. Rest of the day is the same.  Thursday: Leave client site at 4. Flight at 6:30. Home by 10.  Friday: Hugely variable. Sometimes 0 work. Sometimes 8 hours. Rarely more.

consulting,35nl2n,statman_robin,6,Tue May 12 22:58:20 2015 UTC,"In more or less her words:  Hair  I mean, you can pretty much do anything here. It just needs to be professional and tidy (out of your face). One of the worst things is when girls cut their bangs too short and constantly have to move them out of their eyes.  I have long, straight, black hair and every day I would wear it down (blow dried and straightened). A lot of girls wore their hair in buns or in professional, tidy pony tails.  Clothes  I generally shopped at Banana Republic, Club Monaco, and Anthropologie. One of the biggest problems with clothes was that a lot of the other girls on my studies also shopped at Banana Republic. One week my manager actually packed the exact same outfit I had.  I served a lot of retail clients, so clothing was pretty important. We typically tried to dress slightly more professionally than the average client we were working with. My typical outfit was a sheath dress with a blazer over it (I have about 10 blazers total in different colors; black is essential). What I would do is pack a different dress for each day and pack 2 blazers that I would alternate.  I also wore a lot of skirt/blouse combos. When I was a lazy I would just wear a skirt and tucked-in button down. With girls, clothing is much more distinctive. People will start to notice if you're wearing the same outfits over and over. When I started I think I was being really creative with mixing/matching, but one of my colleagues pointed out that I would ""always wear the same dress"".  My preference for dresses was largely just based on the lower space requirement in my suitcase. Every week I would pack an extra black dress as a ""back up"" outfit. It helped out a ton. Every now and then I would get an outfit on and just decided that it looked really weird on. It was huge having another option to fall back on. I once wore a dress that ended up being a lot more low cut then I realized; it was great being able to change at the office (luckily it was a Thursday) when I realized.  Personally, I never wore pants (even when I was working in Toronto and Chicago in the winter). I just don't like how they look. That being said, plenty of other girls wore pants and pulled them off well. A lot of older clients would wear ill-fitting black pants and like a loose sweater over them. It just ended up looking really frumpy. A lot of people think that black pants with any top is a pass for looking professional. It's not.  Shoes  I wore heels every day because I'm not a quitter (yes, even on travel days!). Most of the girls I worked with did wear heels because it makes you look more commanding and professional, not to mention the confidence boost. However, if you feel uncomfortable in heels it's much better to wear flats than to almost fall on your face. Not to mention sprinting down the terminal for the closing boarding door is a lot harder in heels :)  Shoes are a good opportunity to express yourself a little bit. My dresses/skirts/blouses were always a little more conservative so I had a little more little more wiggle room. One pair of solid black and one pair of solid nude heels are both a must. I had a pair of snakeskin heels that were awesome. I would pack two pairs of shoes every week in addition to my workout sneakers.  Make-up  Most girls I worked with (including myself) wore makeup every day. In fact, I don't know a single girl that didn't. I would wear light foundation, mascara, eyeliner, and blush on the days I looked tired. But that's just me, do what works for you. It should look professional.  Jewelry  This is another good place to express your personality. I wore a lot of statement necklaces and usually packed a set of pearls since they look nice with anything. Also, every day I wore a professional, elegant silver watch, a small ring on my right hand, and usually a diamond tennis bracelet. I often wore glasses as well because who wants to wear contacts on a plane? They also look a little more professional.  Conclusion  Overall, dress was very important and really did affect how people viewed me. It could be coincidence, but better dressed girls really did seem to do better at the firm. I would wake up about an hour before I had to leave the hotel every day and it was definitely worth it.  Also, don't forget to pack workout clothes! Usually if there are multiple girls on your project they will want to go to the gym together.  Happy to answer any other specific questions you have :)"
consulting,35nl2n,elev57,3,Wed May 13 04:28:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, how did you pack all of that stuff in your suitcase (I assume hand luggage)?  As a guy, I mostly bring 1 suit + 2 shirts with me, which I alternate. Add gym clothing, necessaire and underwear and my hand luggage is packed."
consulting,35nl2n,elev57,2,Wed May 13 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"From her:  it was a miracle and always a struggle. Be prepared to iron clothes almost every morning, because squeezing things in makes everything wrinkly.   I would have the bottom layer be work out clothes (3 sets), I would pack shorts a lot because they took up a lot less room- this does suck in the winter. I actually heard of girls who re-used work out clothes, but I thought that was pretty gross. The next layer would be my four outfits (one back up dress), on top of that laid flat would be a blazer or a cardigan or two if I was really tight on room that week. I would typically wear a blazer on the plane to make life easier. Also, in fall and spring, trench coats are great and fold very small. I have an oxblood colored one that I would wear a lot. I felt it really spiced up a plain black or tan dress.  On top of that, I would actually lay a huge drawstring bag flat (think of the thickness of a bed sheet), I would use that to keep my clean clothes separate from my shoes and then use it as a dirty clothes bag on the way back. I would just lay my shoes on top of the bag on the way there.   Then I would somehow squeeze a little toiletries bag in there for my toothbrush, contact solution, floss, and everything else under the sun. I don't know if you can tell by now, but I am fairly particular, so I would also pack my own shampoo, conditioner, and lotion in mini bottles. If you are going to be at the same location for multiple weeks, the easiest thing to do is leave a bag at the hotel with your big toiletries. I knew that I was going to be in the same spot for a while, so I just bought stuff at my project location and picked it up every time I checked in.   My suitcase had awesome little pockets for socks and other under things. I also used to keep a slim toiletries bag with shark week things (pack this every week, just in case) in the front pocket. My sneakers were the super light and flexible nikes that could fit in the front pocket of my suitcase (which is impressive, because I have huge size 11 feet).   Also, if you are curious, I used a black Tumi Voyageur suitcase (the two wheeled one). It was a spur of the moment purchase which turned out to be great for me. Even though it was fabric, it held up incredibly well. I also felt it was a little more feminine than the typical Alpha. For a purse I used a Lo & Sons bag. I cannot recommend their bags more. I used The TT and it was great. It stacked well with my suitcase and fit everything under the sun. Also, I was on a project in Chicago and it kept everything dry and safe during the rain and snow. It was also big enough to fit a smaller clutch/ wristlet that I could take out and use when I didn't feel like carrying everything."

I actually really wanted to add something about nails, but my fiance said I had already written way too much! I would definitely recommend having manicured nails. Sounds weird and a little prissy, but most people spring for gel nails. On one study my EM and I would get our nails done every two weeks or even every week together, it was a great way to bond. I typically stayed with very neutral colors. I personally like a color vs french, but I think as long as they are neat, either is fine. I would stick to colors that wouldn't draw too much attention- light pink, neutral shades, gray, lavender. I actually wore gray a lot, to me it felt a little more fashionable, but also pretty professional. I also kept my nails super short...nothing worse than nails clicking on a keyboard in a quiet team room. Also, I think anything is fine as long as you don't have chipping nails. I got these really nice travel sized nail polish remover pads from Target (e.l.f. brand) and they were great to keep around, just in case I had non-gel nails and things were looking gross."

Concentrations? Ugh, you're going to Harvard, aren't you? Please call them majors when you're talking to anyone outside of your school. Also, if I ever run into you and ask you where you went to school only for you to respond ""a school in Boston"", I will punch you in the face.  Yes, major matters. Getting a 3.8 in a rigorous math-based major is much better than a 3.8 (or even a 3.9) in a liberal arts degree. That being said, it's only one data point. Do whatever you're going to be most successful at. Statistics/CS are great options.   another thing you talked about in your AMA is the importance of extra-curriculars. how do recruiters look upon organizations like the harvard consulting club, harvard student agencies (big student-run non-profit), or even seemingly unrelated activities like international relations, cultural, and club athletics? do pre-professional clubs like consulting clubs accurately simulate what a job consulting would entail?   I can't speak to any of Harvard's specific organizations as I'm not familiar with them. Again, the more rigorous and enriching the organization, the better. Unless it is very rigorous, the experience matters less than the leadership opportunities you find there. Extracurricular organizations are the single best way for undergrads to cultivate much-needed leadership experience.  Consulting clubs are pretty variable. I imagine Harvard's is fantastic. The one at my school was garbage.   lastly, i know that oftentimes the recruitment process starts earlier than senior year, through sophomore and junior year internships. what helps differentiate applicants, especially for internships that occur relatively early in one's undergrad?   McKinsey only does a pre-senior year internship, so your process for them specifically starts your junior year. The things that distinguish good candidates are the same things that distinguish them whenever they apply: a good school, a good major, great GPA, great test scores, great work experience, undergrad research, volunteering, entrepreneurship, leadership, etc. It's just a little tougher to get all of that in by year 2.5 instead of year 3.5."

SFO/SVO do plenty of healthcare and other general work. NYC does tons of marketing, sales, etc. I'm not as familiar with Houston, but I imagine it's the same story.

You'll have to spend your first 12 months networking into your desired practice/industry.  My opinion is that you're better off just designating the office where your wife lives. Your interviewers will be very confused if you're applying to an office without your wife intending to move there. As long as you're not really far away (and maybe even then), it won't be that hard to get staffed onto energy studies regardless of your office.  Personally, I did a petrochemical study in New England and I talked with several studies staffing both oil and gas in New Jersey. Energy's everywhere, it's just centered in Houston."

The only feedback I got was very vague, suggesting that my stories and cases were good, but not necessarily the best.   Tough to answer without knowing your specific feedback. Do you remember anything else? Consultants actually develop a jargon that has meaning to them but not to someone outside the field. Annoying as hell, but I might be able to help.  The most common issue with undergrads is abandoning their framework (or any kind of structure at all) after the initial question in a case. It's important to remember the context throughout the entire case. You get huge bonus points for being able to connect the dots between questions in a case.   On a similar note, what can you recommend regarding practicing cases and behavioral components of interviews? What is the best way or resources to use in order to improve?   Cases take a lot more practice than behavioral for most people. It's really important to practice with folks who actually know what they're talking about. Those people are harder to find, but their advice will be 10x more valuable. Current consultants are ideal.  I'm assuming you're familiar with Case in Point, managementconsulted.com, and the forums at wallstreetoasis.com.   What makes a good BA?   You have to be smart. Excel/general analysis are absolutely essential. Developing an organized way of thinking is probably the most important skill to develop quickly on the job. It's incredible how quickly your fundamental process of thinking/structuring changes. Senior BAs focus on developing client relationship skills.  So:  1) Analyze the data to understand a problem  2) Organize the problem in a meaningful way to draw insights  3) Deliver those insights to the client   Why did you choose to do the DTA promotion? What made it a goal? Why might someone be interested in that vs an MBA, JD, or something similar?   I've never been interested in business school. The actual content you learn is pretty small considering the time and money investment. It should be considered (1) an opportunity to network and (2) a long (and expensive) vacation. Neither of those benefits appealed to me given the opportunity cost.  If you're interested in law school just do it out of undergrad. Absolutely no reason not to.  Other options are (1) leave the firm, (2) externship, (3) 3rd year fellowship. I ended up doing (1), so that's obviously a good one for me. An externship could be really interesting for diversity of experience, but I'm less interested in that. Similar for a 3rd year fellowship, but I just view it as delaying my professional progress by a year.   What's the biggest differences between being an undergrad interested in consulting to being on the job? What were perks, hassles, or aspects of being a consultant do undergrads not know about or really consider before they decide to join McKinsey?   That's a tough question to answer. There's more that's different than there is that's similar.  Perks: money, travel, travel points, alternative travel, exposure to senior business executives, exposure to really interesting business problems, really intelligent and driven co-workers  Hassles: top-down/authoritative/tactical managers (though this is no worse than anywhere else), being away from home, waking up at 5 AM on Mondays (cannot overstate this), dealing with clients that just don't want you there  Surprises: There are a lot, but I'll focus on one of the biggest: consultants literally think differently than other people. The most superficial symptom is language. You may think jargon is silly, but it has very real meaning to consultants. If you don't use it then you won't be able to communicate as effectively with them. The single worst example at McKinsey is ""problem solving"". In the abtract, a simple concept. But the way folks at the Firm treat it is semi-religious in terms of its ceremony and seriousness."

First, there's The McKinsey Way. It certainly won't get you to think the same way as a McKinsey consultant, but it will at least help you understand some of the context.  The best way I can put it is that the case interview is a fantastic test of this way of thinking. I remember watching a co-worker give a practice case after I'd been at the Firm for about 18 months. The ""solution"" to the case was painfully obvious to me, but here was this intelligent and well-qualified candidate who was genuinely struggling to work toward it.  A consultant at the top of their game wouldn't need to rely on case frameworks for case interviews because they would literally be inventing those frameworks, custom-fit to each case. More than anything else, that's what a consultant does: invents frameworks to simplify complex problems for easy understanding."

Don't worry, getting feedback on your framework out of undergrad only narrows you down to about 95% of applicants.  Framework  In the case interview, just try to make connections between each question. You should be keeping well-organized note throughout the case. At each question, just briefly skim over the previous ones to see if any obvious connections jump out. When you're given charts and numbers, fit them into the broader context of the case. A great way to manage all of these connections in your head is with a well-developed framework.  Tactically, most candidates (myself included) will come up with a good framework/structure at the start of the case. Then they'll never mention it again. It's easy to get lost in the weeds; poke your head up every now and then and figure out where you stand in relation to your framework.  Behavioral  The trick here is to be prepared to the extent that you're just never surprised by a question. Have ~10 stories from your past 4 years of experience to draw on. Know what values each of those stories can hit effectively. Case in Point has a good section on these types of questions.

I'd actually been shooting for DTA at the 2 year mark and missed it, having to wait until the next cycle.  Promotion and development isn't really competitive. There are some firms that actually rank all of their BA's/Associates. McKinsey is not one of them. Everyone is encouraged to focus on their own development. If they follow a certain track then they'll do well, regardless of how others are doing.  I'm a smart guy (even for MBB) and work very efficiently. I would use that to my advantage at the beginning of studies to get up to speed very quickly and generate a lot of early content. It was a great way to impress (and establish credibility with) the team's leadership and the client. That makes everything else on the project just a bit smoother.  I'd also look for opportunities to do work outside of the typical BA expectations.

As a BA/Associate, I was staffed onto a team of 2-6 people (potentially part of a broader team) to solve that problem. As generally the most junior and the smartest, I was often put in charge of analysis and Excel modeling. I also ended up making a lot of Powerpoint slides.  Ultimately, my job as a consultant is to work with the client to understand their problem, structure their problem, solve their problem (preferably in collaboration with them), then help them understand and implement the solution.

Spent time with my dog, went hiking, and generally got in great shape. I'd recommend doing whatever you love doing and won't be able to once you're traveling most of the week. Starting up a fitness regimen that can be maintained while traveling is a great idea; a lot of people put on weight.   Degree is completely non-technical (social anthropology) so I was contemplating brushing up on some statistics.   Eh. I mean, you should probably familiarize yourself with the concept of standard deviations and a normal distribution. Beyond that it's probably not going to be worth your time.   Would learning some VBA/R/SQL be useful? Did anyone visualise data using tools other than Excel and plugins like Mekko?   R and SQL are non-existent, so don't bother. Doing your own VBA would put you in the top 10% of the BA class (for Excel work), so only bother if that's important to you. There's a group within the Firm specifically to help consultants with things like that when you need it.  You will exclusively be using the Think-cell add-in to Powerpoint for your data visualization. Don't worry, you'll learn it on the job.

From doing a traveling internship over the summer, it seemed like the dumbbell stopgap was the only consistently available program, which felt like a big step down from the barbell-centric workouts I'm used to.   In terms of strength training, bodyweight fitness is probably preferable to a dumbbell program since most hotel gyms don't have sufficiently heavy dumbbells. I actually wouldn't be as worried about strength training though. You can do barbell workouts on Friday and Sunday with one bodyweight workout thrown in during the week.  Cardio is much more important for consultants. It's a very sedentary lifestyle with a lot of eating (team dinners every night on some studies). It's basically running or stationary cycling. If you can convince yourself that running isn't the worst thing ever thought up by mankind, it's actually kind of fun to run around the cities you're traveling to.   Thoughts on learning tableau for visualization, as a supplement to ThinkCell? Worth it/not really?   You're required to do all of your visualization in ThinkCell, so definitely not worth it to learn tableau.

We hire engineers all the time and experience hiring happens year round.  The issue you may run into if you get hired is level you come in as, my guess would be essentially an entry level position.  Just build our your resume and submit it online to the firms you are interested in, the worst case is you don't hear anything.  The sweet spot to come in as an experienced hire, would be 2-4 years of out of school experience.  My 2 cents."

My situation isn't the same as yours, but I think it's pretty close.   FYI Background: I went to a MBB target school, went to Korea to work at a F500 company there instead of in the United States, then did a Masters in Korea and ended up teaching at some schools for 2.5 years while I did my Masters. Came back, am now working at a boutique firm that specializes in healthcare.  The truth of the matter is, it doesn't really help. You can spin your experience in many different ways, but unless you're looking to consult foreigners on what Japan is like (and realistically, there's more experienced people for that anyways) you're not going to get anywhere. You may think that working with parents, and working on your communication skills is a selling point, but again, it's really not that unique and your time is better spent elsewhere.  Think about it this way, you're essentially taking a year off to travel around. You're basically in the same position as someone who asks that question. A lot of younger people think and talk like you (I did when I was that age), and think that going abroad will give some unique insights, but you really have to be there for a long time to do so and by that time, going into management consulting without a MBA is pretty hard. I'd even challenge you to figure out what unique insight you might be able to give.   Now that I've completely crushed your dreams, that doesn't mean don't do JET. I thought my time in Korea was really worthwhile and while I would've applied to a consulting company right after college and probably made my way up to some type of manager at my age, being in a foreign country really toughens you up. You learn how to adapt well, learn things faster (hopefully), and you probably will have a more defined idea of who you are as a person. None of this really jumps out on a resume, but you can spin these into strengths (those alone won't get you jobs).    With that being said, I managed to do it but it was primarily because of luck. I leveraged all my resources that I had, an extensive network of people I knew from college, and I started my own ""consulting"" company in Korea that focused on helping kids get into top tier universities. I also did some internships with some well known NGO's and went out of my way to work in hospitals in Asia. Even with all that, I got lucky because the current firm that I worked at, I cold called, and somehow got to talk with the HR director before she looked at my resume.   So, not impossible, but really really damn hard.   tldr: JET won't help, get a MBA"

Mentor someone on your project(s) to make sure they have the background and abilities that up until now have been unique to you - Building on that, groom someone to take your place both internally and on your project(s);  when you resign you should be able to say: ""Judy will assume x responsibility in the firm, Doug will assume Y responsibility on my clients etc.""  This can be tricky because if you're trying to minimize the impact of your departure you may be tempted to give some leeway like resigning with more notice than you're required to give, or adversely changing your own travel plans.    Avoid that. Simply figure out when you'll leave and commit to yourself you'll do it.  Then take some of the steps above, give notice when required and commit then to minimizing the impact of your departure.  When you resign, be clear and constructive about the reasons and don't be tempted by retention offers.  You'll have already poisoned the well.

Your exposure will be limited to enterprise-type technology (Java EE, SAP, Oracle, etc.) which will drive you nuts since you're a CompSci major. You're knowledge base will not be very dynamic upon exiting Big4.  Getting the broad knowledge and experience as a software developer will be much more valuable IMO - that is what I wish someone would have told me. Coming out of undergrad I really did not fully comprehend how bloated the clients are that Big4 serve. The Big4 do the broad, stable, boring projects like ERP development. They also make claims that they do 'analytics', but in actuality, their 'analytics' is throwing some shit into Tableau and calling it a day - nothing that would require anything beyond high school math.  Also, the people who are hiring you probably don't really know what it means to be a CompSci major and therefore you will most likely be place on projects that really aren't a good fit for you both intellectually and professionally.  If it is between Big4 and software development (w/o knowing anything else about the SD opportunity) then I would do software development - I think SD sets a CompSci major up for better opportunities down the road.   Not to sound conceited, but I think this is a good analogy: in undergrad it was generally known by everyone that InfoSystem majors were ex-CompSci majors that got weeded out. The level of knowledge and skill of InfoSystem majors is a better fit at Big4. CompSci majors typically go on to more 'challenging' fields.

I had a talk with a consultant from my university who was working there (Paris office; may not be the same in the US), a year or so ago. He said the founder and his closest lieutenants were keeping everyone on a tight leash, but apart from that the ambiance was nice.   As they have only one client per industry, the logic of consultant specialization means that you are most likely to do many missions for the same client, so you don't get the  same breadth of experience as in other consultancies.  On the other hand, they have a fairly good balance of strategy missions vs. lower level stuff.  If you speak french, there is a speech from Mars at his engineering school in Paris, where he talks about his life. You can find it on their website or on youtube.  Again, it's second hand information about the french office, so better than nothing, but rely on first hand accounts if you can.   Hope it helped."

consulting,35a0ko,HokieSunshine,3,Fri May 8 13:00:46 2015 UTC,"I'd go with something along the lines of : ""I'd really appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further. Are you interested in meeting [""next week"" / ""some time before the end of the month"" / ""as soon as is convenient for you""]?""  This lets them dictate the meeting time. After they've set a time, if they haven't also proposed an activity (lunch, coffee, dinner), infer from their proposed time.   I know your question just wants to know how to ask, but I can go into detail in case anyone reading this is new to setting up professional meetings. I'm not really an expert, but used to be mystified by the whole process, so hopefully some newbies can benefit from this advice...I would usually follow up their response by giving an option:  ""Great, 10:30 on Thursday works well for me. Since we both work downtown, we could meet at [coffee shop], but I'm always looking for an excuse to go to [cafe] for brunch, if you'd prefer that.""  BE SPECIFIC. State two exact locations, but give them the option between the two. Saying ""yeah maybe we'll drink some coffee or we can get brunch?"" leaves a lot of planning to be done. It's a pain in the butt when someone asks for a meeting with you, but expects you to figure out all the details. Also, as a general rule, I never offer to take people out to dinner unless it's a serious time crunch, or we've worked together a lot in the past. It just seems too intimate to me, I eat late, and I try to keep meetings to strictly during work hours, or at least near them.  That response can give you an idea of how much time they're willing to give you as well. Coffee is a less committed, and generally shorter engagement. I may be over-thinking it, but I tend to gauge their time even when we're doing a coffee meeting. If they order a muffin and have a ""for here"" cup, they're planning to sit for a while and discuss things. If they've just got a ""to go"" cup, I assume I have about 15 minutes to hit my main points, and we can expand on whatever they're interested in afterward.  I always show up 10-15 minutes before the scheduled time, but that's because it helps me deal with nerves, and plan/organize my thoughts. It also avoids the whole ""Should I offer to buy?"" predicament. If they go to the counter and order before sitting, problem solved. If they approach me, I offer to buy. They can cordially accept or decline, but at least I'm not standing in line with them trying to figure out whether or not I'm expected to. Also, if you're meeting in a popular place during business hours, showing up a few minutes early can ensure a decent place to sit.  If they come and sit down with a ""to go"" cup, and I have a lot of points to cover, I'll hit the main point first. After that, simply ask ""I have a few other ideas/questions, how are you doing on time?""   I know this might seem like a lot of detail, but meetings used to be this mysterious world for me. They actually take a good deal of tact which some people have naturally. I didn't, and made some slip-ups that I regret. I started being really calculated after one instance during my undergrad.  I met a professional in my industry for coffee and spent 20 minutes doing (very interesting) small talk and sharing our stories. I had a pretty big set of serious career-oriented things I wanted to get to, but didn't manage my time, and he had to leave before I even asked him any of them. The guy ended up being an amazing mentor for me, though... so don't scoff 20 minutes while someone's on break."

What makes you so sure there is work there?  One of the defining attributes of the consulting industry is that we go to where the work is.  Most of us are road-warriors who fly in and out to our clients every week; geography is never a barrier to getting a consultant to a client.  If there are no firms and no firms are going out there, then is there really any work?  Sure, some companies have needs for consulting work, but are they really prepared to start cutting five and six figure cheques to get it done?   As a general rule, there are few untapped markets.

I was initially worried about being pigeonholed in accounting, but most Big 4 firms recruit separately (and I actually used my contacts in audit to arrange my interviews on the consulting side). I leveraged my major in accounting to intern in corporate strategy at a F500 company, which got me into the door at the firm I am at now.   I will say this: Accounting is definitely one of the hardest majors you can study in undergrad. I've taken high-level classes in Finance, OM, Stats, but have always struggled to get a good grade in my accounting classes. Bankers and consultants typically look down on accountants, but one thing they cant do is neglect the importance of a solid understanding of business that studying accounting often provides.

I am not familiar with imcusa.org and cannot advise on that. Lastly, (2) above gives you general skills in using Frameworks to solve consulting problems, while (3) gives you the consulting experience to answer questions like ""why consulting? why management consulting?"" while (4) helps you answer  ""why our firm specifically?"".  (1) will help you get interviews, without which the whole question is moot anyway. (5) will help the firm value you, and place you on a project in your area of expertise to start with to see how well you fit, if they want to try you out before using you as a generalist in other projects/sectors.  Now regarding SQL. I do not know of (doesn't mean it doesn't exist, I do not know of any in my experience, that's all) management consulting role in a big firm with analysts consulting with C-level executives where knowledge of SQL is a pre-requisite. Of course it can help you with data-wrangling and give more punch to your resume', but I do not think it is a pre-requisite for a management consultant role. Now, on the other hand if you are joining either the technical staff or the in-house expert benches that all management consulting firms have, of course things are very different, and SQL might become critical.  [*] I am not affiliated with this author and get nothing from referring to this book here. I like this book, it helped me ace several management consulting interviews.

Once the project is done, the company will have to pay to keep those full-timers on indefinitely.  There will always be large projects, or projects that involve a lot of office politics, that simply cannot be absorbed or handled by their full-time workforce.  If a company has the resources to handle large and specialized projects on its own without hiring external help, then it's more than likely that they are carrying around a lot of deadweight when those specialized resources have nothing to work on or are overcompensated for the work they're doing.  Getting a fresh perspective from people who have worked across many different companies in the industry or across industries can be very valuable in its own right.  Also, assuming that talent of the caliber that consultants offer can be easily sourced and hired at-will is a mistake.  You may have world-class pools of talent in certain cities, but even then it's not easy to find outstanding recruits.

Second, there can be multiple reasons why consulting firms continue to drum up business, and net positive outcome is just one of them. Whole other industries of questionable value exist - look at weight loss and other health supplements.  Third, there is an important difference between value created and value captured. When it's hard to understand causality and path dependence with regards to how companies succeed over time, building a convincing story is more likely to lead to a perceived success. But when things can really be done better, real value may be created and shared fairly between the client and the firm.

Once you have the basic frameworks, methodologies and techniques down they get much easier.  What ""crack the case"" courses (like Case in Point) have you done?  The only way to learn how to do a case interview is to read/study the techniques for doing it.  Its like any skill:  if you want to play golf, you need someone to first show you how to swing a club.  How many cases do you practice a week?  Practice, in this sense, literally makes perfect.  I was doing at least 20 cases a week prior to recruiting season with partners and another 20-30 ""case starts"" (where I would decide on my framework/methodology from the case introduction and see if that would have lead me to the answer).

As a really simple example: perpetuity value. Someone offers to give me $100 a year forever. At 10% discount rate, what is that worth?  Well, I know I've got to combine those numbers. Adding or subtracting doesn't really make sense. Do I multiply or divide? $100*0.1 is $10, nope thats not it. $100/0.1 = $1000.0. That fits. $100/year forever at some discount rate is definitely worth a finite value more than $100.  Now say I've 5% growth on that perpetuity. Good for me, but I can't ever remember where the growth rate goes in the equation! Numerator or denominator? Denominator. Growth, mathematically, modifies that $100 just like a discount rate does. Now again, I can't remember if I add or subtract the growth from the discount rate. Well, I know growth is going to make it more valuable. Smaller denominator means bigger value, so I'm going to subtract growth from discount rate.  Bottom line: Learn what the equations are actually doing, then it becomes pretty easy to derive them on the fly."

It's easy to get sidetracked when you're nervous. And then I'd write out the general flow of the equation (in words) before I started calculating anything.  Are you able to do the problems without time pressure or do they feel ""hard"" to you even when you're not trying to do them interview with a case partner? If the problems themselves feel difficult, it might be helpful to go through all the cases you've already done until you understand conceptually why the you're doing what you're doing. If you're not finding the problems hard in solo practice but are having trouble performing the calculations when you're in front of someone else, find some partners that you don't mind embarrassing yourself in front of and just go through it slooooowly, even if it's super awkward. With practice, you'll figure out how to balance talking through the equation and actually calculating without it seeming awkward.  BTW, I sucked until I was about 15 cases in, and then I sucked less.

You're going to feel super self conscious, but it's worth it just trust me. Take the recording and listen to all of the cringe inducing times that you say the word ""Actually"" (nah, that's just me. I was saying ""actually"" in front of almost every single sentence as a nervous habit, which I immediately broke, lol). And thennn, ""fix"" yourself. Go through the same case and think through how you would say it in hindsight. Say it outloud. Walk around doing the same case in your head over and over.  This isn't going to help directly with the math, but the reason this is really helpful is that your brain ends up taking much less ""space"" thinking about sentence patterns and vocal ticks and you can actually focus a lot more on the math.

You can never practice enough cases.   I've forgotten a lot of the equations I've learned.   You don't need to know that many equations.  Most of the math is simple arithmetic; we don't expect people to be able to compute the value of an American option using pen and paper.  Know basic stuff, like NPV, IRR, DCF.  As far as the math goes, heuristics are your friend.  Use simple approximations to make the math easier.  For example, the population of the US is 318.9 million people.  If I need to do an equation, I say the US has 300 million - that number is easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 10 so I can do the math quickly and in my head.

His closing remarks were ""Well, your recommendation is what we were looking for, but I have no idea how you got there without solving the math all the way through.

Are you sure you haven't seen this case before?""   THAT is a critical piece of information as to why you may be struggling!  Case interviews are meant to be collaborative exercises.  You need to walk the interviewer through your entire thought process, including the framework selection, rational behind questions, calculations and experiences all leading up to your end decisions.  As a simple example, if I am asked, ""How many bottles of nail polish are sold in the US every year?""  I could say ""250m bottles"" and be right, or I could say:  Well, there are about 300m people in the US.  Generally speaking, only women wear nail polish, so that cuts it down to 150M.  Taking into account young girls and women who have jobs that would make nail polish difficult, the number is probably closer to 100m.  So that is our total market of buyers.  From what I've seen from my family, a bottle of nail polish lasts for about 20 manicures and nails are done about once a week.  So that would be about 2.5 bottles per year per woman, or 250 million bottles.    Now, maybe I got the number right or maybe I got it wrong.  In the first scenario, there is know way to know why I was right/wrong.  In the second, the interviewer can at least see my methodology and determine if my answer was due to correct/incorrect methods or correct/incorrect assumptions.  If it turns out that women actually paint their nails every two weeks and my number was 2x too high, that is a much more forgivable error."

Do you have work experience that might land you a role as an experienced hire?  I've generally thought of volunteering as on-par with any other ""extra-curricular"". It's not a necessity but if you can show you've gained something from the experience it may help differentiate you a little bit. I can't however name a single time when one person was chosen over another over their volunteering to be honest..."

Perhaps I should have mentioned that 2/3 of MBB are listed as 'recruiting partners' at this school, whatever that means.

MBB hires into general practices, so if you can land an interview, you won't end up in some specific sector (mckinsey has started specific hiring, but you don't have to apply for the specific sectors/ functions if you don't want to).   Now volunteering is what you make of it. If you can come up with a solid story it may help once you're in the interview room (perhaps it helps slightly in getting the interview - I'd say possible but meh)   If you're set on doing volunteer work: sign up for ""Escape the City"" - they have some cool stuff all over the world.

consulting,34yt1i,ederemer,3,Tue May 5 21:11:17 2015 UTC,"No worries :)   Charlotte is big into Energy/Utilities and Financial Services.  Since North Highland operates on a local model (kinda/sorta changing, but for now it's pretty safe to assume you'd be in Charlotte local market), the first thing to consider is if those industries interest you.  If they are definite NO's, then I'd say you probably want to stop now. :)  If you don't have an industry preference... then the interview process is pretty close to what to be expected at Big 4s:  a couple of behavioral interviews, with special emphasis on cultural fit (we take that extremely seriously), and then an interview with a Principal/VP and then MAYBE an interview with the market VP.  Overall, I found the interview process to be pretty simple.  We're nice people and we like to hire nice people, so it won't feel or be intimidating.  Generally we hire experienced folks, so having the base consulting skills is usually a given.  For non-experienced hires, its a hiring decision based on culture fit and potential.

consulting,34wkqi,anonypanda,3,Tue May 5 08:46:10 2015 UTC,"You are in a tough spot.  As others have said, your GPA is going to be a big issue with the automated screenings.  Personally, when I evaluate resumes my first cut is always on GPA; if you are below a 3.4 I put you in my automatic ""no"" pile.  I know that sounds harsh, but when I have 200 applicants for 20 first round interview slots, I have to make my first cut on something and GPA is a quick, easy and lawsuit-proof way to do that.  Graduate degrees are going to be tough as well.  For consulting, one of the few business related graduate degrees we care about is an MBA; MFA and MA are not going to turn many heads.  Your problem is that you will not get into an MBA program right now.  It is very rare that candidates get accepted fresh out of undergrad (they have to be exceptional) as MBA programs prefer people with work experience.  You are going to need to start networking like hell and get your grades up.  Consulting firms are going to be doing their full time hiring in the fall; you only have a couple of months to get on people's radars for interview season while some of your fellow students have been on the radar for years.  Reach out to your personal network and set up as many coffees/lunches/drinks as you can with people who work at the firms you want.  Your ONLY job right now is to network.  Now, all that said, you are probably still not going to get in.  I'm sorry, but its a pretty big hill to overcome and, from what I have read, there isn't much in your bio that would convince me as a recruiter to look at you over your 4.0 BBA competition.  If that does happen, you need to decide if consulting really is your end career goal.  If so, get a good job with a Fortune 500 company for 3-4 years and get  a few promotions under your belt.

While you can get good at following those standards, running a business is very much more than just a set rules.  It requires melding various disciplines and schools of thought; moving a factory to China certainly has tax implications, but it also affects supply chain, finance, HR, sales, customer service, etc.  As an accountant, you will always have a job.  It just won't be CEO."

The problem is that it is, for the most part, too early to use the reset button.  You are going to struggle to get into a graduate program with a 3.0 GPA, regardless of what type of program it is.  Moreover, you are going to get substantially less value out of some graduate programs in business trying to go straight out of undergrad.  You are also, at some point, going to need to decide between accounting and finance/business.  If your end goal is consulting, then accounting is a bad road to take.

Realistically, if you haven't gotten the work done in that amount of time, then it either doesn't really need to get done or you're not the person to do it.   Picture a steam locomotive - the old coal-fired kind. You get hired to build a feed to carry coal from the tender to the firebox.   So you build it. As you're building it, you notice that stokers just seem to show up when they want to, and if the train slows down then someone calls the stokers to send someone up. You also notice that there doesn't seem to be anyone actually driving the train.   So you start out giving some basic instructions about how to slow down on entering a station, and come to a stop, then how to speed up again to leave. You try to build a system to remind them when to stop for water and coal, except nobody actually does it, so you have to run the stokers to take care of refueling. There are other little efficiencies you create as projects, but for the most part your job is driving the train.   You keep telling the owners of the railroad they need to hire a Train Engineer, but they don't pay enough for any of the engineers on the market to put up with their BS. And the stokers keep coming to you for help with things like ""We can't get coal into the firebox"" (because the door's not open) and ""Where does the water go?""

Marriott Silver is 10 nights, Gold is 50 nights, and Platinum is 75 nights.

Take this opportunity to try different airlines and hotel chains and see which one you like the most. See who's most on time, who has nicer planes, which hotel amenities you want, that kind of thing.

They pick up your bag Thursday, it arrives at the warehouse Sunday, and then gets to your next hotel by Wednesday?  You'd have to fork out for next day delivery, or have two sets of clothes stored with them.   Most frequent business travellers have the packing process down to an art. It is always just a carry-on, and you just throw your clothes straight in from the dry cleaner.   Packing really wasn't a problem for the people who this is targeting. This would cost someone $400/mo to save maybe 40 minutes a week."

Any longer than that and it is more convenient to just do it myself.

(Presumably, at least initially, just within the US mainland.)  Its main product would be avoiding shopping for things you already know you like - just re-order your already-selected item from your account. It would also offer periodic packs - socks and underwear delivered on a schedule, possibly an entire duplicate outfit once a year (or on your preferred schedule).  The suitcase product/service would then simply be a spinoff of that - a standard pack, with fast delivery.  Dufl's offering is OK for those wanting to travel light and not too often (although possibly you could have two or three sets of luggage circulating at any given time), but I'd want to know how they deal with clothing and other items being in storage for weeks or months without deteriorating. Do they vacuum-pack the clothing? Store the cases in extremely low humidity environments? Something else?"
consulting,34spb4,liquidpig,1 point,Mon May 4 08:43:00 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea for something that might be useful for consultants: Keep it local.  This would be for when you know you'll be on a case for >3 weeks. It'd be awesome for longer cases. Pick a few hub cities (NYC, Houston, Chicago, SF...) and just offer the service there. The traveler would fly in on Monday with their own packed bag, leave their shirts with the service on Thursday and fly out without the extra clothes. The service would wash and press them, and then have them in the hotel on Monday again.  Benefit to the traveler: Save packing/unpacking. Save having to hang/steam your clothes in the hotel room. Save the trip to the drycleaner.  Why it's a better business: You are essentially operating a drycleaner, not a storage and packing service. Way lower costs to cover - no cases, no shipping. The trucks would probably just do one tour of the city on Thursday evening, stopping at the ~10 or so hotels in each city that are full of consultants, and then drop everything off again on Monday. The cleaning/pressing service operates on Friday/Saturday/Sunday.  It could probably be done for only marginally more than your own costs of doing it."

Every firm has some sort of quality dimension to its reviews and for new hires this is the most important one. We expect you to learn business principles as you go but the quality of your work must always be above average  2) Don't be particular about projects. Some people I started with felt that certain projects or companies were ""beneath"" them and it really hurt them in their reviews; they were branded as selfish.  3) Be proactive. Try to take on roles that push you out of your comfort zone. When you encounter problems take the time to proactivly reach out for help or guideance. Always ask for help in how you think rather than just saying you don't know how to do something.  4) Be selective about the internal work you do. Some people get too involved and never make a big impact, despite being a part of several key initiatives. Pick one or two that you really care about and take roles that really make an impression on people. As Ron Swanson said, ""Don't half ass two things; whole ass one thing."""

So far I have come to the conclusion that this is more of an issue with the risk of exposure of different data to different parties inside a company, which leads to the question of Who owns the data, who could see/use the data and who shouldn't, which is, again, a question that might start a debate, how do you identify the risk of exposing certain data to certain people? how risky is it to put the cost of the product in a report used by the Sales dept.? and what is the risk? and who says it is a risk?  I have done some research, SOX (the Sarbanes Oxley Act) is more centered on fraud prevention in Financial reporting and doesn't really get into these technicalities, different Risk Management Standards, address the issue of risk management in its very broad definition and would guide you on how to identify, and assess, a risk, which is a problem by itself.

It can be technical advisory work but usually it tends to be more user centered design work, so creating user stories, wireframes, high fidelity mock ups. Sometimes you might do a clickable prototype so a client can secure more budget. Occasionally you can get clients to pay for full out ethnography but that tends to be rare in FS.  If you're in NY general assembly do a bunch of UX courses which are a good start."

They will take a look at requirements that state we need 6 sites and start working with the client on things like:     Do you need all 6, or should we have 1 site that everyone lands on.  how should the site flow from one piece of functionality to another.  How should it look.  what are common functions, what are uncommon and how will that reflect in the layout.  How should it be branded and does it need to keep to a corporate standard.   The work they do seems ""fluffy"" to a lot of people, but a good one will make all the other work shine through and can be a key to your projects success.

If there is demand in the US for your skillset (unlikely seeing as you're an analyst, but maybe you can get super specialized and sell yourself that way) then you'll actually be asked to re-interview for the position. Basically you'll re ""apply"" for the role, get accepted, quit your role in Europe, then move to the US and start.   Your best shot would be to find an international role (or one on a global project), make your way to the US a few times, make a few connections and try your luck that way.

consulting,34g3tb,cliffg,6,Thu Apr 30 21:21:28 2015 UTC,"It's all right, depending on your organization of course.   Pay may start low but my experience has been that your salary will jump quickly as you prove your value. This however does not last forever, understandably. In these organizations you are an expense, a resource to be used in order to get a job done within a certain budget. In consulting, sales is always the focus.   The experience is invaluable. You're  exposed to various platforms, languages, methodologies, and of course people as you go from project to project. All of these experiences are potential assets as you add them to your repertoire. If you're confident enough in what you've learned, you'll add them to your resume.   The job usually requires that you are independent and capable of deciding and executing on a solution that will satisfy your client. You may find support from other consultants who've gone through similar experiences, but if you're serious about the technology you may find yourself breaking new ground every project. This can be great but can result in becoming decent at many facets of technology but never a true professional in any. It'll help you find what you like though.   Also understand that you'll likely be locked in to a certain set of products. People have made careers administering, managing, and developing for these products but in the end if you're not careful you'll find yourself pigeonholed as a ""Salesforce"" or ""Remedy"" guy, and depending on your aspirations that can be detrimental.   After a few years you'll be faced with the choice of pursuing a more managerial role, taking another job somewhere else (perhaps at a client), or just staying put and collecting the now stagnated salary they're offering.   Overall I would do things the same way if I had to over again."

More commonly at the critical junctures is where you're going to find people being knocked down (Analyst to Consultant, Senior Consultant to Manager, Sr. Manager to P/D).  If you can get them to agree to keep you at a Consultant level, then great. Just realize that a level ""demotion"" isn't uncommon.  It's not really a demotion because work done at the junior levels is usually pretty similar, especially between Analysts and Consultants. Furthermore, you can always ask for Consultant roles as an Analyst and still get the experience.  On the other hand, I know of the argument that you're ""losing"" a year getting back to the title you had before. That your lower level doesn't afford you the organizational clout or level of responsibility you would want.  Just different experiences I know of."

consulting,34enxq,lx468,6,Thu Apr 30 17:12:05 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. Manhattan isn't a consulting firm, it is a software vendor that has a professional services arm to help implement the software. Having worked as both a software consultant at a competitor of Manhattan Associates and in a more traditional consulting firm, I'll say that they are different.  When working in a  technology division of a consulting firm, you'll notice that your client often does not know what technology solution they'll need and your firm will be responsible for identifying that solution as well as helping to integrate it.  On the vendor side, you'll come in after the specific product has already been chosen and your job will be to help implement it. As far as the actual systems integration goes, think of the whole process as several back-and-forth interactions between the software vendor and the client. At the consulting firm, you'll most often be on the client side of things, representing the clients in meeting with the vendors and managing the project for the client.  On the vendor side, you'll likely be ""in the weeds"" with the product to configure it perfectly for the customer. When it comes down to it, from the customer's perspective, you won't be seen as ""true consultants"", whose expertise falls anywhere outside of the product you are selling."

(working for your full time empeloyer's competitor, for example)  100/hr in a lump of hours, with half down is still 100/hr. You should consider if the work is more of a project that has a definitive deliverable or if you are truly dong hourly work.  In hourly scenarios, you benefit if he keeps changing his mind, but lose money if you are efficient at your work. The flip side of that is if you do a fixed fee, you are on the hook to deliver the final product no matter how long it takes (thus you should build in a certain number of revisions/edits into your language).  The last consideration is if $100/hour is the right amount for you. Will that cover you once you get the 1099 and file the taxes you will incur?

I'd go above what I needed to do on my project but didn't do many extra curriculars outside of project work.

If you are on the verge of a promotion or are trying to land a cherry project, you put in the extra work and get the better rating.  If you are in a ""coast year"" then you pull back and accept average.  Like anything else, when you push is a tactical decision.  I always take an easy year right after a promotion.  It is tough enough to stand out as a newly minted manager against people who have been in the role for 3+ years; better to take an average rating (which you were probably going to get anyway) and spend the time/effort learning how to operate in your new position."

consulting,3487xl,Benjithedoge,2,Thu Apr 30 01:03:25 2015 UTC,"Quite the opposite.  When you first get hired you are just another new face in a sea of new faces.  You need to work hard right at the beginning to establish your reputation so you are seen as an up-and-comer.  Project work should be #1.  All of the other items are just icing on the cake of your review - you need the substance of project work or the other items just don't matter.  That said, the non-billable work will serve as a differentiator between you and your peers when it comes time for the final review - I've seen promotions and high ratings won or lost because one person got an edge from their internal efforts."

consulting,3487xl,Benjithedoge,3,Thu Apr 30 18:24:00 2015 UTC,"Most of the items you mentioned are more important later in your career.  For new hires, there are a few key things to focus on:  1)  Make your work technically flawless.  Every firm has some sort of quality dimension to its reviews and for new hires this is the most important one.  We expect you to learn business principles as you go but the quality of your work must always be above average  2)  Don't be particular about projects.  Some people I started with felt that certain projects or companies were ""beneath"" them and it really hurt them in their reviews; they were branded as selfish.  3)  Be proactive.  Try to take on roles that push you out of your comfort zone.  When you encounter problems take the time to proactivly reach out for help or guideance.  Always ask for help in how you think rather than just saying you don't know how to do something.  4)  Be selective about the internal work you do.  Some people get too involved and never make a big impact, despite being a part of several key initiatives.  Pick one or two that you really care about and take roles that really make an impression on people.  As Ron Swanson said, ""Don't half ass two things; whole ass one thing."""

consulting,345xuv,TD-,2,Tue Apr 28 22:47:58 2015 UTC,"Serious question - do you guys (/u/crash_coredump, /u/chi_guy_49) really believe this is what consulting is / is supposed to be?  I will be the first to say that there is a level of finesse and bullshit that comes with popping into clients and selling or telling them what we think they need to hear, but do you really believe that all of consulting is essentially just smoke and mirrors, lying and high bill rates?"
consulting,345xuv,Crash_Coredump,6,Wed Apr 29 01:08:12 2015 UTC,"This is actually one of very few good questions/posts in this sub, so I'll actually respond to it with little to none of my typical shitposting.  I believe that this is largely what consulting IS -- and that it absolutely should NOT be like this. This is NOT what consulting should be at all.  I think that there are definitely a few, very few consultants who are actually experts in their subject matter/industries and who do really outstanding work. I know some. I suspect that they may be concentrated at the top tier places -- for example, I know a couple of people from McKinsey and they seem very sharp and really seem to know what they are talking about. I think that when companies have problems that truly require specialized knowledge and skills, and you hire people with that knowledge and those skills FOR THAT SPECIFIC SCOPE, then you'll do really well with consultants.   What I observe, however, is that people abuse their positions as ""experts"" and do things that are uninformed and yet can have huge impacts on their clients. We're like people purporting to be doctors without any medical training. It's pretty openly spoken about, at least where I've been. Some examples:   One time I've been put in front of prospects and was told to act as though I'm a SME on something that I know nothing about -- however, there's a deck that someone wrote a couple of  years ago that I could read. There, TA DAAAAA, I'm now the ""global subject matter expert on X -- HUR HUR HURRRRRrrrr..."" That just disgusts me. Guess what though -- since I'm a Consultant and I delivered my obvious, fundamental facts in a confident manner, I sure as hell looked like an SME! What a bunch of rubes, right guise? Right? Bueller? I've been on projects where we are there to help a client do some sort of selection of one kind or another, and after going through this huge ""methodology"" (i.e.: what garbage can we cobble together from other clients and change the logo), behind closed doors it's: ""OK, $client needs to pick X, so we just need to make sure that this project ends up with that result."" O RLY? Why is that? How do we know that they need X? We know NOTHING about them. Why do we have this preconceived notion about what they should pick without knowing anything?  I've also been on projects where we've been asked to do something for which we are completely unqualified and yet internally our attitude is -- we're the experts, we need to just come up with whatever we pull out of our ass and tell them they need to do this. Really? We're going to, say, do planning without knowing even basic facts about their systems, their ops, their volumes, bandwidth, platforms, hardware, existing agreements, or ANYTHING that would be pertinent? Because ""we're the experts""??? Are you fucking kidding me? We're going to tell these people things that are going to frame their supply chain/ops/IT/whatever for the next several years and we're not even going to do the most BASIC research?   Sometimes I've been on engagements where one of the client sponsors is a former consultant -- and when this is discovered, it's spoken about in horror -- especially when they were former employees at my place. I suspect this is because they know what's up -- we can't bullshit them. We can't abuse expense policies because they will know to look for that. We can't pull shit out of our asses because they were probably in that position themselves a few years prior and will look for us to actually produce things. Dr. Stantz summed it up best.  I think that most clients hold themselves back through their own attitudes. Often, I find that the only difference between us and them is that we're going in with the mindset of ""we can figure this out"" while the clients sit there and think ""oh no, we can't figure this out"" -- we typically don't know more than they do, we just think about it for 3-60 minutes and then start doing it, learning how to do our jobs on their dimes. Hire consultants when you need true expertise -- don't hire them to do shitty staff aug work. Don't hire them because you don't trust your own employees or because you're mentally lazy, otherwise you're going to get ripped off. Or, if you DO hire them for this, hire the right firm -- go to a place known for staff aug, vet the resumes, and get in a strong PM or whatever it is that you need for that role, and then pay a slight premium -- don't pay me 7-10 times local salaries to make copies, for example...  I guess my final thought on this is that I encounter a lot of disdain for clients in my few years doing this -- they are marks, they are morons, they exist to be billed, to be ripped off, hur hur hur guys they haven't figured out that we are actually buying first class tickets, etc. etc. That just really bothers me. They hire us because we're supposedly experts, because they need HELP, and we're barely more qualified than they are (and sometimes less) to figure out their problems and how to solve them, and they are spending money on us that could be better used in their own organizations."

""I want to leave in a year with your brand name on my resume"" is bad too.  Between those extremes, a lot will depend on the firm. Some firms look for candidates they can develop and who will stick around. Talking about leaving, even 5 years down the road, is probably bad in that case. At other firms (e.g. MBB), 2-4 years stints are the norm, so you can be pretty transparent about where you want to be in the long-term. You need to understand your audience and each firm's norms around exiting.  I think I'd like to be around for a while, so my answer was along the lines of ""I relish the opportunity to work on high-impact projects for sweet clients and think consulting holds the potential to be rewarding for me in the mid- to long-term"" with some different word choices."

At the consulting firm, both business analysts and consultants did this."
consulting,340oup,brainmydamage,2,Mon Apr 27 16:05:39 2015 UTC,"I am a consultant who frequently wears the ""business analyst"" or just ""analyst"" hat.   Most of my analyst work is looking for practical solutions for issues and performing analysis to assist management make better decisions. For example, as an analyst, I built an excel based audit tool to evaluate whether or not customers were in compliance with their contracts. I also performed regular sales forecasting and did demand planning. Then, I worked with manufacturing and fulfillment to align production to demand. However, most of the work that I did was less interesting than this sounds.   As a consultant, I mostly do what ever I am told to do. I would say that I split my time about 60/40 between doing staff augmentation work and real consulting. The real consulting involves system and process overhauls, organizational change management, and strategic planning. The system/strategy component is generally more fun but much more stress. The analyst staff aug is generally remarkably easy but seriously tedious."
consulting,340oup,rino86,0,Mon Apr 27 17:03:30 2015 UTC,"I would personally argue that someone who just does what they are told to do is a contractor rather than a consultant. I'm not trying to be pedantic - I believe that there is a firm distinction between the two that needs to be respected and considered.  Consultants are there to offer their opinion on how best to proceed, guide the customer along the right path, and sometimes perform the actual work.  Contractors are people who are there to perform work as instructed.  I do most of my work in the public sector. Contractors are told ""set up server X with specs A, B, C, and software L, M, N, using template Q"" and they yes-sir and run off and do it. They are not expected to argue or have opinions.  A consultant would be told ""we want to do X, we were thinking of doing A, but we wanted your thoughts"" and their job would be to agree, agree with modifications, or disagree and offer better alternatives.  The short view is that contractors are paid for their labor, while consultants are paid for their opinion. This may not be true everywhere, but it's certainly true in the areas of PubSec I've worked in."
consulting,340oup,brainmydamage,2,Tue Apr 28 16:45:06 2015 UTC,"you cannot compare contrast because its not of the same type. You could be a consultant working as a business analyst on a project for an example. Also ""analyst"" is often a title, the big 4 for example use it as their entry level position but thats not the same as a business analyst.  Business Analyst is also such a vague title that its almost useless. It even spans functions since you could be a business analyst working in finance or technology which are entirely different jobs. The business analyst in technology role is the most well known and usually what people mean when they talk about the position but even if you narrow it down to that sphere you have a pretty wide range.  For example, a BA could be an experienced technical person who is now working more abstractly at the architecture / organizational level. At the other end of the spectrum, it could be someone with almost no technical background but some amount of business or field knowledge thats useful in designing / building a product."

I've been in this and similar roles for the past 10+ years.  I work for the services division of a major software company.  In my opinion, the best consultants are those who are able to perform in all of these roles simultaneously.  The basic premise here is ""how do I know whether I'm crafting the best solution for a customer"" if:   I'm unable to manage the plan, customer relationships, write documentation, etc. I can only consider the technical aspects of a solution and cannot understand the needs and drivers of the business? I only understand the business aspects of a solution without any clue how to actually translate them into a solution? I can only make solutions using OOTB features (in the case of solutions built on COTS products) without any understanding as to what is possible in the realm of custom development   There are certainly people who slot into these individual roles and do their jobs very well, but in a consulting organization, the most valuable people are those who can do all of the above."

They won't talk to you unless you have co-op experience for the most part and a 3.5 GPA I find. Lots of smaller firms however will. My program actually gave a very good overview of the world in consulting I will say, which had a lot of classes in entrepreneurship, BA, project management and marketing which other programs do not. Unfortunately, many of us still get overlooked because of Rye-high in the beginning.  In addition, a lot of consulting firms even will pull computer engineering grads out of U of T simply under the impression they are star performers and groom them. I've seen a few instances of engineers ending up into financial management firms as well.  I say this because I am ERP software consultant and can see my weaknesses compared to the other IT grads from my year who are already consulting managers under 3 years of graduating.

Taking leave from a consulting firm (while getting paid and having insurance) sounds much better.   how busy is the coursework   Moderately busy to incredibly busy, if you choose. Although, if you've survived a PhD program, I'm sure you'll be fine.   how lenient is it for someone taking a leave   Very. Typically, you have 5 years to finish.

Unfortunately, MBB in my home country are not as established and don't garner as high of a reputation they do here, so another brand name from a top MBA would carry some value, though I could also get that by joining a top lab in my research area.

MBB (at consultant level) is basically a self selected top-of-the-class cross section of students that work together for a few years after the MBA. You can take maternity leave, and you can work on pro bono projects if you want.   At some of the MBB, you can just take off 6 months and do whatever you want (work somewhere else if you want to...)

Unless you really want to be in NY, you'll hate being there (and paying rent) just because it has a favorable industry mix. Competitiveness - Some offices may or may not be easier to get into, but it's almost impossible to predict which in any year. Offices like NYC and Chicago have lots of spots... and lots of interest. Southern offices have much more variable needs year-to-year and interest can fluctuate wildly. Hard to optimize around this.

I've been up for a replacement for a while now, but since the only thing on offer is a fairly crummy, equally-large T-series Lenovo (last time I asked it was the 440 that was offered, and it felt like a plastic piece of shit compared to the metal Latitude, and I didn't like the display much either), I've just held off on upgrading.  I also have a bunch of docking stations for the Latitude that I wouldn't have with a new machine (for some reason it's always easy to get people to pay for laptops, but obtaining docking stations requires a deal with the Devil) which makes moving to anything else painful.  If you could swing an X-series from Lenovo, I might consider that trade if I were you.  Honestly though, it would depend how much time you actually spend working on airplanes and other places where space is really tight.  Personally, I think I might miss the display area when I was just sitting in a conference room or in my hotel more than I'd enjoy the small size on a plane.

Knowing that Acme Corp is implementing SAP  or knowing that Beta Inc. is doing a headcount reduction will have an effect on their stock price.  For this reason, we just mention industries.

Consulting firms hire people without consulting experience all the time, so it's likely another part of your interviewing technique/approach that you should focus on.  Also wouldn't hurt to spend some time learning more about the industry.  May be wrong since you're applying in Europe, but ""Assistant Manager"" isn't a level in consulting.  If I was interviewing you (granted, in the US so may be wrong), and you said that you were applying for an Assistant Manager role I'd know immediately you didn't do your homework.

We post job openings on our website from time to time, but those are usually a resume black hole for candidates.  Most experienced hires get their job by knowing people within the firm.  Those relationships allow us to use our internal resume drop service (which actually gets paid attention to) to forward the candidate to HR for screening.  After that its a pretty normal process - phone screenings, initial interview, on-site follow up interviews, etc.  The only major difference is that, depending on our current staffing, we may require that the candidate have a specific role on a specific project that they will fill upon hiring.  This prevents us from hiring people and having them on the beach.  This puts a bit of extra pressure on the candidate, as they need to have a special skill-set that we don't currently have available internally.  2)  Just like normal networking.  This forum is littered with people asking for the ""secret sauce"" for professional networking; there simply isn't one.  You need to comb your private and professional networks for people who know people at the firm that you want.  You need to work to build relationships with these people so they are comfortable submitting your resume to the firm.  You need to demonstrate that you have the chops to operate at the level MCs operate at.  That all said, this can be hit or miss - I personally do not refer people unless I have worked with them in a professional capacity and can speak to their quality of work (I have my own reputation to maintain when it comes to refers).  This illustrates why it is important to network with several individuals - some won't feel comfortable passing you on without direct knowledge of your work.  Tenacity is key here.  It may take you months or even years to get your foot in the door for experienced hire recruiting.  You have to work hard to maintain the relationships and build enough of a relationship with someone to get them to drop your resume.  3)  You need to develop a skill set that will be valuable to the firm.  Do you want tech consulting?  Find a job that will get you specialized in an in-demand software platform (SAP, SFDC, Oracle, etc).  Do you want sales force effectiveness consulting?  Get a managerial role in a sales or sales support organization.  As a general rule, campus hires are brought in for potential, experienced hires are brought in for skills.  That all said, the best strategy is to work your ass off for a few years and get your MBA.  This will put you back in the OCR cycle."

Companies can't force you to sign anything when you leave. Any contract requires consideration (i.e. they could offer to compensate you to sign something).  Note: At some point you probably signed a company policy or handbook acknowledgement. Might be a good time to brush up on that.

consulting,33jsbt,elus,2,Thu Apr 23 22:15:16 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, no agreements are acceptable when you are resigning.  Anything the company wanted you to sign should have been done so up front.  If you are asked to sign a non-compete (in the start or end of a job), ask what compensation they are offering to do so.  Non-competes have been struck down in most districts if they do not offer the employee some compensation (employment alone isn't enough).  If they do not offer anything, simply decline to sign."

Generally, states require the non compete to meet a certain set of criteria. Radius of a specific geographic area, practice area, amount of time, etc...also, you have to think about what's competition. Is that little boutique firm that only consults locally really a competitor of a Big 4 just because they consult on the same software stack? No. Not really.

The specialist shops however mainly serve governments and are very prestigious (and well paid). Another side of it is shops advising companies in developing economies (like china) on how to expand in the west - I'm not familiar enough with that market to name any key players, but I do know that many of the Big3, Tier 2 and Big4 firms do some of that kind of advisory as well."

consulting,33gxiw,tian17,7,Wed Apr 22 13:03:28 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, neither. I'm assuming you're choosing between Tax/Audit with KPMG. Take whichever and just network the hell out of that firm. It's possible to transfer within the firm when/if you get a FT offer. That's what I was able to do with another Big4. Applying for MC with an internship in audit or tax isn't really going to be too beneficial in all honesty."
consulting,33gxiw,litecoinminer123,2,Wed Apr 22 13:36:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that seems to be the response I got from the employees there also.  Do you think it would have any negative effect for pursuing a full-time consulting position with other consulting firms (Big 4 or Big 3 or other) that I didn't do something in the summer preceding that directly relates/builds skills relating to strategy/consulting?  Or should I just try to make what I did sound relevant to the position and get good as hell at case studies?"
consulting,33gxiw,anonypanda,2,Wed Apr 22 13:54:05 2015 UTC,"It will be beneficial. Not to say there aren't better opportunities within Big 4 if your career goal is consulting - but to say it would harm your career or be an issue is silly.   Its what you do with that internship that counts. Get some achievements, get in front of clients and prove you can bring value to them. It helps to have done that in something which is closely aligned with your career goals, but it's not to your detriment to have done it in tax/audit.  Have you tried looking for internships which are better aligned to your actual career goals on the side? You can always do more than one internship in the summer."
consulting,33gxiw,litecoinminer123,-7,Wed Apr 22 14:26:51 2015 UTC,"It definitely hurts you. No doubt there. Realistically this all tends to boil down to if MC firms recruit from your school.

consulting,33gxiw,extremedonkey,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:56:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the tax/audit positions are not the only positions I'm going for, and I'd definitely prefer the strategy positions I'm going for.  My gripe against tax is that while I'm not by any means just a ""numbers"" person, I don't want to spend my summer poring over legal documents.  Would you say there's a big reason besides tech savviness why I should do tax? (I'd also probably prefer strategy/management consulting to tech consulting)"
consulting,33gxiw,d3athstarr,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:38:09 2015 UTC,"Tax is doing a bit of a push toward more consulting-like work where they actually proactively help the correct correct client find $'s - a lot more client engagement and closer to some of the finance management consulting services.  I think this is less the case for audit.  Regardless, all consulting positions will look better than tax or audit, I was just answering your original question."
consulting,33gxiw,mrwobblez,2,Wed Apr 22 23:29:42 2015 UTC,I work at EY now in their Advisory practice and in my opinion you're better off doing Audit if your ultimate goal is consulting. Our Assurance teams get to know the ins and outs of all our clients' business processes which I think is more beneficial than learning tax code and balancing corporate returns. If you were creative enough you could spin it to seem like you're more in touch with the business by understanding their processes.  I'm fortunate enough to have started with an IT Audit background and have an understanding of both business process and technology. But it is ALL about networking because I started by doing audit work and networked my way into their consulting practice.

Hopefully this helps out you and anyone else interested because there really is not a lot of useful info about advisory internships available. This will be lengthy.  Speaking solely from my experience: first week will be training at the largest office in your region (for my Western region office it was in LA with interns from LA/Southern California/Las Vegas/Hawaii and my office) and I would expect you to be grouped with all the interns in your region, not just MBA interns. I was flown out to the training, put up in a nice hotel, and was given a solid per diem for food as well as a pretty lenient policy when it came to car rides and entertainment (I received a company credit card about a week before training) and I didn't spend a single dollar of my own money that whole week. I spent the week with about 15 other interns, each night we would usually go to happy hour or dinner that we were allowed to expense - training is a good time. After your first week you'll fly back to your home office and spend 1 day doing compliance and HR type work (sexual harassment, non-disclosure, etc.) and getting your necessary badges/ID cards. This will probably be the only day you'll ever spend at the actual Big4 office until your exit interview.  The rest of the internship goes as follows: spend every day at the client site (if you're on an exceptionally large client expect to spend the whole summer on that same client) doing the same work that a first/second year consultant would do, on my 4th day I was already sitting in front of the client stumbling through a walk-through. You'll also be expected to work the same hours as a first/second year consultant, I personally worked at least 8-5 or 9-6 every day and sometimes a little longer. Anything over 40 hours will put you into overtime (1.5x hourly pay) and you can't really beat that, but if you're on a smaller client they'll probably make you go home before you go over 40. You'll work closely with Senior Consultants and Managers to learn and perfect your work, after the first few weeks they're going to expect you to have learned from your mistakes and know how to do your job. You'll be spending the majority of your time doing actual work, but you'll always be the first one chosen to run errands/make copies/reserve rooms/staple/order food/do anything that more senior team members don't feel like doing. They're going to throw you into the fire on day one and expect you to learn quickly on the go while doing real work, but you're still the office whipping boy when the time comes. I once spent an entire 9 hour day shredding paper, I found it oddly soothing.   Travel: I did travel a lot more than I had expected, 4 of the 8 weeks I was outside of my home state. I usually traveled with 2-4 members of my team and worked with them throughout the week. Again, everything before/during/after was covered by the firm and the only personal money I spent was for drinks if our team went out at night. Traveling as an intern is fun if you're with a good group and shitty if you're with a bad group, but I'm sure you could've guessed that.  Wine and dine: Yes but it doesn't necessarily stop as soon as you sign full time. For example, I went out to lunch every day with older members of my team. My firms policy was that the most senior member present (usually a Senior Consultant or older) would pay for the lunch if it was at an actual sit down type restaraunt. As an intern you're always the youngest there, almost guaranteeing that every lunch you go on is free. This also meant that the First/Second year Consultants rarely paid for their own lunch if they played their cards right. There were a bunch of happy hours held throughout the summer that my team and others went to but none of them really had anything to do with trying to impress the interns. Given the fact that the summer is generally busy season for Advisory, I think a lot of the events were just to reward the team for their work.  That was long. Again, this is only my personal experience at my firm and I can't guarantee yours will be the same. I hope I answered at least most of your questions. Shoot me a message if you have anything else specific, good luck this summer."

Personally, that would be a great one day experience! I would find it soothing as well.  Thank you so so so much for this insight. I'm now so much more excited to get started. I honestly haven't found a better source of first hand information - again, thank you for the candor.   The main office will be in Los Angeles so I guess other interns will be flying in from around. That being said, am I in a fortunate ""travel"" position in terms of locations they will send LA office consultants to? (e.g. LA/vegas/portland/SF/San Diego/Seattle, etc)  I will have the option for over time, but as you said, my guess is that they will want to limit those kinds of hours. Indeed, I am fairly free for the summer so some travel around will be quite welcome before heading back for my final year as an MBA student.   As for wine and dine: I've heard that drinking with co-workers is a very common practice in the industry (as well as in i-banking/trading vis a vi Wolf of Wall Street but I'm sure not to the same extent). Am I expected to keep up with superiors/teammates? Is drinking to a ""fun"" state (not sloppy) accepted or is it more conservative?

consulting,33aavg,EricFrattonRushChair,2,Tue Apr 21 04:49:09 2015 UTC,"Travel: it completely depends on what client/clients you'll be staffed on for the summer. Most of the interns that were at my firms LA/Southern California office were either at a very large client for the entire summer and traveling very little or were on a few midsize clients doing a bit more traveling, but I think only a couple traveled more than hour or so. My travel situation was pretty unique in that I was staffed on a huge client that was based in my home office city but has sizeable branches all over the globe, so I would end up traveling to those branches. From what I was told most of the LA clients were large clients based in LA and they did the majority of their business in the area, getting rid of the need for much travel at the intern level. No harm in expressing your interest in traveling to your recruiter/supervisor, they might be able to find something really cool for you to do for a week or so.  Overtime: from what I remember, the interns from the LA office would occasionally get overtime but not very much individually because there were a lot of them (2-4 on a client) as compared to myself being the only intern on a 20+ person team.  Drinking: totally depends on the team you're with. Happy hours were very relaxed and gave people a chance to have a couple drinks and socialize about things not related to work; people drove home after these. One of the weeks I traveled with a team to a really really small town (I'm talking like 4 stop lights), at night we would head to one of the 4 bars in town and have a couple drinks and play pool and then head over to dinner and have a couple more drinks, nothing crazy but just enough to make being there interesting. Another weekend I was in a very well known party city with an awesome team made up of a couple guys just a few years older than myself. Went out and got pretty rowdy a couple of the nights to the point we were all definitely feeling it the next morning. It all depends, but I would always recommend airing on the side of the caution especially at the beginning and let your seniors determine the mood when it comes to drinking. They definitely wont force you to drink if that's what you're worried about, removing staples in order to scan and then re-staple stacks of paper for hours on end is enough hazing as it is."
consulting,33aavg,lakjak,1 point,Tue Apr 21 06:32:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks again!  Coming from the internship, were you pretty secure in terms of post-graduation employment? Do partners/recruiters give good feedback in terms of what they are looking for in a FTE? Essentially, when you leave the internship are you basically given the offer if they want you, or do you wait into the fall/spring to hear back about their intentions moving forward?"
consulting,33aavg,lakjak,2,Tue Apr 21 16:39:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely felt pretty secure overall, a B4 Advisory internship opens a lot of doors both within the B4 and outside. At the point you get offered an internship they've determined that you're competent enough to handle entry level work, the internship is really no different than being a first year for 6-8 weeks so you'll definitely know what management expects by the time you're done. I received a full time offer during my exit meeting on the last day of my internship and they let me know what their full offer was including signing bonuses and what not. That meeting is normally with a partner and they basically summarize what they/others saw in you that they liked as well as where they see you fitting in when you join. It also gives you a pretty rare opportunity to let them know what your wishes are if you do end up joining full time (clients, sectors, job function, etc.). I got a lot of good feedback from the partner regarding where I saw myself going within Advisory and they made it seem like my goals were attainable. I was emailed my official offer contract a few days later and took about a week to think it over before signing. From my intern groups experience: if they want you, you'll most likely know well before the exit meeting. If they don't want you, you'll absolutely know well before the exit meeting."
consulting,339aum,yertles,5,Mon Apr 20 17:56:50 2015 UTC,"I run what is essentially a consultancy (professional services firm in the digital marketing and analytics space).  We used to budget and recognize revenue with grossed-up hours but it didn't work, it's just not effective or necessary (we mostly do value-based prices and retainers instead of hourly T&M). We look at committed contract value vs. labor expense as a P&L.   Then I adjust resources based on client demand and need.  We separately look at the cost of services per client based on grossed-up labor, I look at that every month, it is more of an operational report vs. budget and forecast which is about overall margin.  Generally speaking professional service businesses have low barrier to entry and are easy to manage financially for even a novice businessperson. The downside is they are incredibly hard to scale and grow even when successful.  Hope that helps!"
consulting,339aum,Sassberto,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:40:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is helpful, thanks. So when/if you do a longer term forecast (multi-year), what is the driver metric for revenue? Is it just extrapolating top-line growth into the future, or is there some other approach?  The reason I am asking is because I am calling on a customer that is a large, publicly traded consultancy and I am trying to understand how the budget/planning/forecasting process works because I am not intimately familiar operational details of how that process is managed. Every industry has a degree of uniqueness in how you plan revenue, I'm just trying to pick up on any of the major practices."
consulting,339aum,Sassberto,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:13:46 2015 UTC,"Revenue forecasting is based on a retention / growth model (i.e. 90/10) plus some allocation for new business (usually anywhere from 10-20% of revenue).    Professional Service firms generally don't do much fixed budgeting outside of things like opex that don't need to scale.  Generally it's more about managing to a margin target and scaling expenses as appropriate.  This is why it's often hard for consulting firms to make capital investments that will growth their businesses - revenue is largely unpredictable and fluctuates heavily, resulting in periods of expense growth or contraction, making it hard to budget in big fixed costs unless you have the long-term contracts to support them.  edit:typos"

The other caveat is that you already have a full-time offer so the employer doesn't really get a much out of offering you a short term job. Few companies will be willing to hire you. You don't add a lot of value in such a short term since essentially you have 3 weeks ramp up and then what 7 weeks of work? Unless you want to work for free I don't see how it is in their interest. You could lie, but I'd suggest against it. It is draining to simply hire to have someone go.  Some options    you could do ask the firm to move up your start date so you can grind away your life sooner. If they have interns starting in the fall it is totally possible. You join up for 3 months and then get December off and start again full time in January. volunteer in a hospital or healthcare non-profit, do some soul enriching work.  what kind of grad school are you interested in, maybe roadtrip and visit some campuses if you're thinking MBA you could study and take the GMAT since your scores are good for 3 years I think work retail, coffee, or etc take a massively offered online course, coursera.org travel more   Unfortunately you can't do anything that requires much of a commitment like teaching english or peace corps since you start work so soon."

Now here’s the problem: if you’re bringing in consultants on something, aren’t you essentially admitting that you don’t have the resources in-house to work on or deal with it?   Yes, that's exactly it.  But it's not a problem or issue.  You can bring in consultants for a variety of reasons, but the main two are:   Your employees don't have the skills for a certain project. Your employees don't have the bandwidth for a certain project.   Let's start with the first.  If you're a management consultant, you're working on complex issues that a company only faces every 5-10 years.  Big merger?  Divesting a product line?  You would never be looking for those skills from your potential employees in the interview process because they're just not needed day to day.  And Jane in HR may have some really good ideas on recruiting and process payroll with the best of them, but probably can't redesign an HR organization.  Next, companies don't have 20 bodies just sitting around waiting to start on some new project.  But that's okay!  Again, these projects aren't performing every day activities and pretty infrequent.  Hiring 20 new full-time people, and then firing them after the three month project is over is even more expensive than hiring consultants.

consulting,331hdl,Packkus,4,Sat Apr 18 16:31:09 2015 UTC,"I assume you're an undergrad based on your comment. Regardless, I will suggest you recruit for both IT and MC anyway. You will likely have a greater chance at receiving an offer from a Tech Consulting firm, however, and I'll mainly speak to it as a current Tech Consultant (at Capgemini):   Yes, you will have opportunities to handle the Financial aspect of projects and, depending on the project and tenacity, you'll likely have exposure even as a junior consultant (as a PMO or supporting the Team Leads/Account PMO). The other comment is spot on that the higher up you get, the less you deal with any day-to-days of project work. You mainly work on staffing logistics, SOW/WO, budgeting/financing/invoicing, sales/pursuits, etc. and become the point of escalation for your team/""guide the ship"".  The IT to MC jump is a frequent question and you can  find answers elsewhere. My personal opinion is that it is possible, but usually after you go for an MBA or have a intermediary job that is more in line with MC. Ironically, it sometimes seems harder to move to the MC arm within the same company (ex. Deloitte Tech Consulting to Deloitte S&O or Capgemini to Capgemini Consulting) than to jump ship to a different company.  Hard to categorize since it varies a lot, but here's a really short description as you move up in Tech Consulting (YMMV):  Junior Consultants: Mostly doing ""hands-on"" work as a junior resource - BA, Testing, Data Analyst, Dev, PMO, etc. Also,  pitching in on sales/pursuits by reviewing decks and gathering data.  Senior Consultants: Still doing the ""hands-on"" work, but likely leading a team at this point and having more responsibilities towards the project/account.  Managers/Senior Managers: Now you're moving into a project lead position and doing more of the hands-off work I touched on before.  Principals/Partners/Directors: Most likely either running Accounts or becoming a ""Practice Lead"" for the company in some facet. A lot of sales/pursuit work.  Feel free to ask me any other questions or PM."

How would you rate Capgemini in comparison to the Big 4 for a job as Junior IT Consultant? Do you think Capgemini is very close to the Big 4 and offers the same growth potential or are there some differences between them?"
consulting,331hdl,ddlbb,2,Sun Apr 19 07:00:14 2015 UTC,"Capgemini/ ACN work in the same arena as Big 4. The tech consulting practices are pretty much the same, with some of the big 4 ""worse"" and some of the big 4 ""better"" than Capgemini/ ACN. It also depends on region.   In general, you'll see a lot of consultants hopping around in all ""6"" of these companies (and some of the smaller boutiques such as Slalom etc) to get an increase in pay. That seems to be how you ""grow"" your career at this point in time.   Of the firms, I'd say Deloitte probably has the best momentum right now. PWC is fine as well. ACN is the most dry/ cutthroat and Capgemini has a lesser reputation in the US, but nice people in general."
consulting,331hdl,THElakeshow,2,Mon Apr 20 00:26:47 2015 UTC,"/u/ddlbb is pretty spot-on - although I will say that for the Big 4 in terms of Tech Consulting, Deloitte is currently by far a larger player than EY/PwC/KPMG because they've actually kept their practice as opposed to having to build out a new practice. And I think Cognizant and some of the Indian firms (TCS, Infosys, WiPro) should be in the picture depending on region/sector.   From the perspective of a junior consultant, there are only negligible differences between the firms themselves. However, the the Big 4 + Accenture have a much better general brand perception in the US market (within the industry Cap is well-recognized) and that could, maybe potentially have ramifications down the line if you choose to leave Tech Consulting or the IT side of business. But where you start is really not a factor in the grand scheme of things - it's what you do with the opportunity that drives your future. And the industry is an incestuous group..everyone leaves for the other firms and changes for career advantages, you could argue we're all sub-contractors for these firms masquerading as employees!  Anyway rambling thoughts, I do think Deloitte and ACN are the top players in terms of size/perception/pay, Cap is right there too but is lacking the perception in the North America market, IBM GTS/GBS is going downhill, EY is mostly public sector work it seems, PwC bad to admit but all I hear about them right now is the LADWP scandal, KPMG not sure how much is being invested into tech consulting, Indian IT firms are growing in sheer size but can be a ""bodyshop""..but hell, so can Deloitte/ACN/CAP.   tl;dr - Yes, Capgemini is competitive with the Big 4 and Accenture. Yes, there are slight differences. But as is true with consulting in general, it depends on so many factors to the point that it's arbitrary to compare from a high-level."

I see this happen and notice that people there in the bulkhead who have to stow everything above them end up short on space.   I digress. I believe Southwest does a great job. You have to know the system and be A List or A Preferred with them to routinely get good seats though. Checking in at flight time -24 is a crap shoot because at T-36, they check in all the A+ and A passengers, followed by the people that bought ""early bird check in"".

I came up with this ridiculous idea a while back (and yes, some tech would need to get built to support this).  1) You time travelers from the moment TSA scans a passenger's boarding pass to the time they exit the security area. Do this with facial recognition software or something. 2) The time it takes a person to get through security becomes their boarding score. You could adjust the time/score using an algorithm if the lines are held up through no fault of the passenger (e.g., senior citizen directly in front). 3) Passengers on a given flight are ranked according to their boarding score and they get a text message saying which zone they are eligible to board in. There are also monitors that show this info.  If you're traveling with a companion, your rank is determined by the worst performer in your group.  Yes...this is a crazy idea.  I just have a hypothesis that the people who hustle through security, likely know how to board a plane quick.  Put the fast people at the front of the line and the stragglers at the back and boarding is more efficient. Also, we've now aligned incentives so that people are trying to get through security efficiently."

If everyone packed their shit well enough to get through quicker, then you'd be down to like seconds of difference that aren't distinguishable by chance. It's actually not all that strong of an incentive then because you'd stand a decent chance (50%+) of being punished for being slow, even if you were just 10 seconds slower than some other guy. Then the airline would have to budget for additional customer service reps to deal with all the people bitching about how efficient they are in security but they're still in some scum class boarding order. Bottom line is, I don't see how this system would benefit the client (the airline).  As for the technology build, why not just integrate TSA's boarding pass scanner somehow? Or have an agent of the airline also scanning people's boarding passes before and after security? (Or automate that with self-serve scanners?) Or, instead of giving people their boarding order based on how quickly they get through security, why not just give Precheck passengers automatic boarding priority?"

Think of it this way: You can get your MBA now, and come out making exactly the same amount that you would if you didn't get it at all, and then you're stuck with an MBA with no benefit. Or you could wait, get 3-5 years of work experience (by this time you're making $90k+ a year), then go back and get your MBA and come out with work experience, connections, a great summer internship (another reason not to do a 1 year MBA), and plenty of offers for $135k+.   Seriously man, don't do the MBA. It'll do you no good in the short run, and it'll take away A LOT of benefit in the long run. Why not do a different Masters degree and defer your offer for 1 year?  EDIT: Also, did you take the GMAT? And did you already get into the business school? This is a weird situation so I'm just wondering how admissions would work..."

That said, when it comes to exit opportunities you will be compared against your peers who have the same MBA but also, most likely, a number of years of experience in good jobs.  So, having the MBA is nice but the positive impact it has will be less than it normally would be.  Also, as someone else mentioned, a lot of people get their MBA because they realize they want to do something other than what they currently are.  So, you won't have that card to play in the future.

Issues in the traditional model tend to arise when your managers are the wrong kind of people and with the wrong incentives & responsibilities.   But this could could work fine for a small firm with a single business line.

I saw Tony Hsieh speak at a conference in Vegas around 4-5 years back, and was absolutely captivated.  Made me go out and read ""Delivering Happiness.""    While he's brilliant, I think a lot of his statements and actions are more for just the PR aspect (why else would he have the desk of a call center employee?).  ""Look, we're a cool and progressive firm!  Come work for us!""  Or, ""our customer service agents are SO MUCH FUN!!!  Buy from us, so you can interact with them.""  Holacracy makes sense theoretically, but in practice wouldn't it just look like the organizational structure of a consulting firm? You have these different pools (""circles"" as they call it) of resources, all with differing skill levels and backgrounds.  You hop on some project interacting with others in the firm.  Sure, the initiative might have a ""leader"" but MANAGEMENT is gone.  You may never see this ""leader"" again after the project is over.

Running a team that adapts to this style could be great... Or disastrous. It'd be interesting either way."
consulting,32rb05,silverfreeze936,2,Thu Apr 16 02:08:48 2015 UTC,"Friends from grad school or even undergrad that have made the transition is probably the best place to start. Give them a week to respond, they may just be swamped right now. Other almuni from your schools are probably the second best place. If you do manage to get to sit down or talk over the phone with them, see if they are willing to introduce you to anyone else at the firm: someone with a similar background, someone in an office or area you think you might want to work in. Keep doing that, and eventually, you will have a set of contacts at the firm.  Application process for PhDs and postdocs at MBB (McKinsey/Boston Consulting Group/Bain) involves submitting an application online, followed by interviews. Networking will help get you through the resume screen and should be considered necessary. You don't want your online application to be the first time anyone at the firm as seen your name. In the US there are typically two rounds of interviews. First is at the office closest to you, second at the office where you would work. Both rounds consist of multiple interviews each composed of a ""fit"" portion and a case. McKinsey has a ""round 0"" interview where they administer a multiple choice logic test called the PST. Post-docs are grouped with PhDs/MDs/JDs and recruit through the Advanced Professional Degree (APD at McKinsey) or Advance Degree Candidate (ADC at BCG) channels. (Not sure about Bain's acronym, they seem to have started non-MBA recruiting in earnest more recently). I should also note: there are a lot of opportunities as smaller boutique firms focused on healthcare that people with life science backgrounds pursue, but I'm not familiar with them. My impression is that other firms (Big4, ATK, OW, Accenture, etc) focus less on recruiting PhDs, but others can correct me if I'm wrong.  Also, spanning the networking and application subjects: look up McKinsey Insight and Bridge to BCG. These are 3-day summer programs for APDs/ADCs looking to learn about consulting. However, I think the application deadline for this summer has passed, so it may depend on your time frame.  As far as an intro to case interviews, Case in Point/Victor Cheng are good places to start. When you are actually preparing, though, you want to practice with real people.  Finally, think hard about anonypanda's question: why switch to consulting. It will come up a lot.  Feel free to PM me if you've got other questions. I went though the science to consulting switch over the last year."

I just started my current job and I have a 1 year contract so I couldn't do anything until next winter.  I just wanted to get a headstart.  I think the case studies are going to be the toughest part and that is what I am going to be practicing.  In terms of networking, I am going to contact a lot of my family friends and their friends to get a better feel for consulting. Once again thanks for the response.  I will definitely keep in touch if I have any more questions"
consulting,32rb05,monkfisherr,2,Thu Apr 16 23:56:29 2015 UTC,"I did exactly what you are thinking about last year.  It was surprisingly easy.  All the MBB's seem to recruit decent numbers of what they call APDs (Advanced Professional Degrees).  The good news is that as a Post-Doc you are still considered an ""on campus"" recruits so they have a relatively well documented system for applying, as well as answering your questions about making the switch.  I found that McKinsey provided the most information/support during the application and recruiting process but their info translated well to the others.  This is what worked for me.  First, I joined the consulting club on campus at the University where I was doing the post-doc.  There probably won't be one at the NIH but there are target schools in the DC area.  I met a bunch of applicants from Johns Hopkins.  A little googling will tell you whether a school as a consulting club, and even better, whether they have a APD specific consulting club.  Email them and see if you can get on their mailing list.  The club usually maintains a list serve where recruiters can announce events and web presentations.  You will be able to get a better idea of how to prepare for interviews through the club, list serve, and web presentations.    If you can get associated with a target school like Johns Hopkins and their consulting club you will also have access to much more support during the application process.  McKinsey flew in a couple of consultants to answer our questions about the job and the case study interviews between the 1st interview and the 2nd.  Second, just prepare for the case study questions.  They aren't hard but there is a certain ""way"" of solving them that each company is looking for.  Buy one of the popular case study books.  Every book has its own system.  Learn that system but don't slavishly apply it in the interview.  Find a couple of people to practice with from the consulting club and run through cases until you are comfortable.  Third, rewrite your CV as a resume emphasizing what consulting companies are looking for.  MBBs aren't going to care about how innovative and numerous your publication record is.  They care that it is adequate for the stage of your career but not much more.  The evaluators won't be from your field and probably don't know the impact factor of any journal.  Read around on the companies career sites to figure out what they are looking for, someone who is competitive (excels), able to collaborate, and that you have some interest in business.  Make sure you have something on your resume that addresses each.  They like awards.  List all the fellowships you have won.  Third, keep in mind that the application process for MBB is similar to academic positions in length.  McKinsey has already had their recruiting presentations at my school.  Their summer program application deadline just passed.  McKinsey's full time application deadline is mid July 2015 for start dates in the summer of 2016.  If you miss that July date, you have to wait another year for the ""on-campus"" cycle.  Boston's and Bain's application deadlines are about a month after McKinsey's.  Once you drop below MBB, to companies like LEK and Oliver Wyman, the process is more opaque and harder to navigate.  They do hire some Ph.D.s but don't document the application process well.  They also recruit from fewer target schools, or at least my school wasn't an APD target for them.  If you are interested in a boutique firm, you really have to get out their and network in your scientific community and the local consulting club.  Those jobs seem to be a lot more word of mouth and dependent on your specific research expertise."
consulting,32rb05,bioscientist,2,Thu Apr 16 15:11:27 2015 UTC,"You gave a great answer, but I wanted to just add something to clarify for OP.        For the MBB application process, for advanced degree backgrounds, they often have two sets of full time recruitment. One is now/summer, with interviews in the fall. McKinsey and BCG also recruit in the spring (Approximately March deadline?) for PhD candidates. LEK has a Life Science Specialist position that's meant for PhDs.     Also, OP, if you don't think you can set aside the time to properly prep for case interviews before late August/September, I'd strongly consider waiting for next cycle. The interviews aren't impossible, but they have very little overlap with what we do as scientists on a day-to-day basis. You don't want to waste any interview opportunities!"
consulting,32rb05,monkfisherr,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:05:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  McKinsey et al only wanted to talk to APDs at my school between February and April for the summer application, fall interview cycle.  I was totally unaware that they also had an application round for APDs due during that time.  The recruiters came to campus for the undergrads and MBAs at a different time of the year but those were handled by other consulting clubs."

Usually the first part of the project has easy hours - most people get in around 9:15 or so and out before 6. Data modelling you usually leave a bit later - 6:30? Really depends on how much progress you've made for the day and who the project manager is.  Typically the manager is drafting up loops in the deck and will leave an experienced analyst with the model. If you're really new you'll be doing more basic tasks under the supervision of a senior analyst or an associate. When I started, for the first few months I didn't build the overall model - just did research and analysis that supported it.  Hours tend to rack up in the modelling phase when you start having doubts about model assumptions or something goes weird during testing the model (e.g. you find a report in conflict with your analysis). I've had a couple days where I have been in the office till 10 fixing a model, and one or two around midnight - these were all times VERY close to deadlines though.  Doing the deck/presentation is pretty easy - bigger shops will outsource this to a production department, but in the smaller shops you will typically do powerpoint. Most often, you will simply be filling out loops a manager or associate has put together with your analysis. Hours here are probably the best as there is not much that can go wrong.

I've done projects in which the focus is internal, where you're looking internally at the business for a myriad of reasons. In these projects, which are more typical of management consulting the first few weeks is spent getting data from the client (you'd be amazed how long something as simple as historical sales can take to retrieve) and cleaning the data up so it is suitable for the required analysis."

consulting,32mj1w,swimming-bird,11,Wed Apr 15 01:57:50 2015 UTC,"So in a bottom up market model you build the market size by looking at very high level and macro factors and working your way to a market size. A very crude example might be, what is the market size for refrigerators? Well assuming 100% of households own one, and the replacement cycle is once every 7 years, (100%/7 of the population will buy one each year) - multiply that by an average price point and there's your market size.  A bottom up approach on the other hand would be to look at all the relevant revenue of fridge manufacturers and estimate their market share then scale up accordingly e.g. top 5 firms generate $500m in revenue and account for 50% market share, therefore, market = $500M /50%.  Typically you will build your forecast section using the top down approach and sense check sizing with a bottom up approach"

Or another way of putting it, assuming you went directly into consulting from university: is there anything you did in uni that particularly helped you to launch your career? Conversely, is there anything you would have done differently now that you know what it is really like 'out there?'  I'm sure you have been asked this multiple times over the years, but I seriously appreciate any advice you may be able to offer."
consulting,32mj1w,swimming-bird,6,Wed Apr 15 01:55:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on the type of consulting you want to go into but I probably would have done more finance courses just to get used to the maths you use on a daily basis but its not that necessary.  The big firms will come to recruiting events so you should go and talk to them when they come around. Extra curricular is good - especially if you can get into some sort of leadership role  Join a university consulting club or do pro bono work. Take as many strategy courses as you can, do well in them and write them up well in your resume - this alone probably got me my job"

I would suggest going into your client as a Director level, so that you have an opportunity to get to know that client's internals in depth before moving up to VP, which requires more breadth than depth.

Generally speaking, consultants are not seen by businesspeople as being good managers, they are generally seen as advisory and most Director, VP and C-level roles are management roles.  So the most natural fit is an industry that depends on advisory roles, i.e. Finance, Law, Accounting, professional services.  Marketing is another, but senior marketers need a track record of taking products to market, which few consultants would have.

It sucks to turn people down from a job they clearly want.  Sometimes being too 'quick' to arrive at an answer can be a bad thing. Since you introduced errors it was could seem to the interviewer that you didn't take your time in 'carefully considering and weighing your options' which can be a major red flag.  You do have to be concise, it sounds like you could have been rambling a tad. Consultants need to be able to cut through the shit and get to the point.  Overall seems to be a lack of structure that you went in with, almost as if you tried to wing it - not saying you did of course - but you didn't leverage a suitable structure for your case as best as you could have, missing hypothesis, extraneous factors, math error. You should check your answers as you work through the case and see if they make sense. Better you catch your error than the interviewer.

Partners like the energy of the ""new / young kids"".  check in with your staffing person a lot. Hopefully she / he sits in the office with you.  have a stellar internal resume do the small bullshit tasks that partners will want - but be smart - don't get sucked into becoming the partners office bitch (this WILL and CAN happen to the best of us - someone I know turned into the partner's data entry personal assistant keeping track of sales etc for months.) Be nice to all of the office support staff - they know the partners better than anyone. If they like you, it rubs off (think aura).    That's all I have for now. A positive attitude and constant reminder that you're available will get you staffed."

But if its like my team, we are all on client site mon-thurs and work remotely on Fridays. Turning up wouldnt help you in this case.  I would recommend booking 30 minute phone conversations with the partners, snr mgrs and mgrs. Ask what they are working on, who they recommend you chat to and mention where you think you can help out. Apart from that, smash the internal training. If you jump on an engagement and know the tools better than the others, you will stand out quickly.  Training recommended: the processes and methodology for engagement and project management, some industry 101s and some presentation courses. Your internal learning program will have all of those.  You could also start another language if you have the time."

Big 4 will take care of you with money, benefits, a great name on the resume for future opportunities, and possible future opportunities within the company if you wanted to move into a new area without having to quit and find another job. If you're there for 3-5+ years, I believe it will open future doors and you'll work hard but learn best practices that work. Another consideration is likely if you leave on good terms you could come back in a higher role if you spend some time in Big 4 and go back to a smaller company. If gives you more leverage than peers who stay and climb ladder. I think the Big 4 ride is exciting for a few years, even if you might get some crap projects or roles. You get to see a lot, good training, good leadership examples, ""best in class"" delivery approaches, etc.   Okay, but all that aside, if you're in a stage in life where you like what you do (enough), the pay you're being offered at your current place, and the role is a reasonable promotion, it might be better to stay at your current company. If you have a family at home, it's harder when you're having to work longer hours and travel a lot.

When the day comes and the interviewer asks how you'll handle ""just doing excel and ppt work"" you'll smile and tell him you'd love it - you used to handle tickets at your university dealing with tough/ entitled customers.

Yes it'll help that you'll have been ""in the trenches"" of IT support but that is barely a step up for most other work experience. Take the IT support role because it could offer to better exposure to more challenging work. Yes you'll deal with morons that just need to reboot their PC, but you'll also become familiar with the campus' internal ticketing system. You'll get used to the daily grind and might find a way to improve a process or maybe educate end users that will better correlate into standard IT jobs. If you stick around long enough you could be brought into larger IT projects, possibly the roll out of new campus wide software, or a new student portal.

The soft skills you would pick up at KPMG IT advisory are IMHO more valuable to MC than ones gained from FADP which is a back office role from what I understand.  While JPM's IB Analyst program would allow you to transition to MC, FADP just isn't on the same level as it's not a front office / client facing role and I don't think it's a clear cut choice above KPMG IT advisory. Frankly, it will be a tough transition from either to MC without an MBA, but I think Post-MBA being a consultant previously even if in IT would be more valuable than a financial analyst in a non-client facing role."

Consulting firms are generally more lax about this sort of things than in industry--for example, they generally don't drug test.  I wouldn't sweat it too much, especially since it didn't result in a charge.  I didn't think arrests come up in a background check, only convictions, as being arrested doesn't necessarily mean you committed a crime (due process and what have you).  If it does come up the only concern would be how recent it was--as others have said, don't offer anything up but if asked, give an explanation.

I can only speak for my firm's culture (big 4), but short answer is that, depending on how you handle it, alt travel can but doesn't have to affect your reputation.  I have taken advantage of alt travel often over my three years and in general it is not seen as a big deal as long as it doesn't get in the way of client work or other commitments. Some best practices:   Establish yourself in your local office and on your project teams before doing too much alt travel. Understand and adhere to project norms -- does the client allow alt travel? what is the project budget and how does your trip fit into that? does the team expect 9 hours of work on a Friday or can you sneak away early? Try to understand what will be going on that week before scheduling alt travel -- will a client deliverable be due?, is there an important meeting in the office on Friday? will it affect your typical flight schedule on Thursday evening or Monday morning?"

If so - you're just a regular undergrad student... with a shit-ton of life experience that no 21 year old can match. This can be a huge asset, especially when you're sitting across from a partner one day doing the final round of interviews.   Don't let the comments about GMAT etc mess with you - those are for MBAs.  My colleague and former flatmate was about 29 when he finished undergrad, and we both went into consulting (this is in the US). Your age should not matter at all, just be willing (and able) to show your work and your willingness to start at the analyst level again.   Second, make sure the undergrad university is a target for whatever consulting gig you want.   IF you can't get into a target undergrad - then I would say the consulting dream will be a bit hard. The risk becomes larger, and I would honestly focus on my own business. To be very blunt, you can go to a non-target when you're 18 years old and screw up, and make your way into consulting.

There are many players in that space, your clients could achieve the same organizational aims through other operating models and many of your own suppliers have vertically integrated to provide those services in competition to you.  Why would any small business choose your offering over just using a cloud provider + just buying standard laptops from OEMs? (Lenovo, for example) - you can even get desktop apps in the cloud now.  So, what will be your selling point? Lowest prices? The best customer service? Have you done any research on what makes companies switch between managed services providers in IT or what the buying decisions are that a new company makes as part of that process?

One approach I've seen interest smaller firms is 'turnkey' IT (ITAAS). Instead of selling boxes and servicing them, you offer all their IT needs as a monthly fee, based on the amount of end users.    This way, you move their IT costs from capital expenses to operating expenses. If the client downsizes, their IT costs go down- you recover those systems and repurpose them.     The advantage in the long run is that your business is 'sticky'- you're hard to replace. Doing this profitably requires standardization to reduce support costs."

My initial phone interview was like 10 minutes long. Some guy called me and didn't even give me his name - wasn't the same person who I had been emailing with previously so I had no way of knowing who he was - and basically just ran down a list of really stupid questions. ""Why consulting? Why financial services?"" I don't think there are any wrong answers to those questions. Then after about 10 minutes of talking about useless shit, he invited me to an ""Assessment Day"" in NYC. Cool, great, might as well go, right?  So then I waited for an email to schedule my interview day. And waited. And waited. Email never came, so I called all the Capco numbers I had (2 or 3 people) and nobody answered, so I left voicemails and nobody responded. I sent 2 or 3 emails to each person I knew politely asking wtf was going on. Then I got a mass email from one of their recruiters basically saying they ""overestimated demand"" for new hires and cancelled everyone's interviews. (Even though they never actually scheduled those interviews.)  I would stay away from these guys unless you know something I don't. Seems like a great chance to get laid off after a couple of months of uninspiring staff aug work. They're owned by a huge payments processing company, so basically as far as I can tell, all they do is implementation work for the parent company's products (correct me if I'm wrong, anyone).   That all being said, though, I did talk to a few guys who were former employees and current employees, and guys who knew other guys who work there or something, and people seemed relatively positive about the firm. So I have no idea what to make of that. But yeah, unless you have some undying desire to basically do Peter's job from office space (updating bank software), I wouldn't see this as a great opportunity in MC.  Go as far as you can in the process, but keep in mind, these guys are basically a glorified temp staffing firm. At least in their U.S. businesses."

I have no idea what their UK business is like. It's gotta be up to you to figure out if it's a good fit for your goals or not. Look people up on LinkedIn who used to be Capco employees, and see where they went from Capco. Personally, I wasn't able to find anyone who went on to do anything particularly impressive (Big 4, MBA, etc.) but they might be out there. I knew Capco wasn't going to be a good fit for me based on the extremely lax phone interview - why would they want to bring me in for an in-person interview without even going over my professional experience and interests?? Seems to me like they're just hiring warm bodies (in the U.S. offices at least).  Also, their San Francisco ""office"" is non-existent. Look up that address on Google Maps.

consulting,321jh8,chaser1021,2,Thu Apr 9 22:57:38 2015 UTC,"Well, in general you would not be doing internship and FT recruiting at the same time...  What generally happens is that you get a FT offer from the firm you interned with (firm a). If it was through university recruitment, you typically have a certain time period to ACCEPT that offer. Until you accept you can do whatever you want - recruit with other firms etc and see if you can find another FT offer (from firm B).   Does that answer your question?"
consulting,321jh8,ddlbb,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:00:56 2015 UTC,I came to know that you have to immediately accept the offer (from A) after internship which gives me no time to recruit with other firms (for FT like B).

Is this recruitment done via your school's recruitment? If so, I would speak with the corporate recruitment team at your school about this directly. You won't be the first one to have this problem.   If none of the above applies... then I would do this: First,   Is Firm B really that much better? As in, a solid tier or 2 tiers above? If so - recruit for firm B (during the summer?!? thats weird..) while doing the internship. As long as you are meeting all of your work/ deadlines, there should be nothing stopping you from interviewing somewhere else.

Your post comes across like you heard that management consulting was a cool job, then only applied at PWC and only got an interview because your friend pushed you through. ""Because your case interview"" is incredibly broad, unhelpful feedback. Did they get any more specific? How much research/practice did you do to prepare for case interviews? Honestly, ""it was your case interview"", to me, sounds like you bombed because you just winged it and the interviewer put as much effort into feedback as he/she thought you put into prep.  Sorry for the harsh feedback, but your next step from here would be to find out if anyone else is still recruiting this cycle (Sinister_Yogurt brings up a good point that smaller firms may be your best bet as MBB/B4 have pretty rigid recruitment schedules). If not, start thinking MBA?  Edit: formatting"

I was only give a few days to prepare for the case since I was fast tracked through the entire recruitment process. As for the case specific feedback, they said my presentation skills may have been the place where I need improvement. This was the first time I was exposed to case interviews. I bought the ""case in point"" book a few days before my interview and read through the frameworks. However, PWC's case interview is entirely different from the traditional case interview method.  As for my passion for Management Consulting, it is very new found. I've had the golden opportunity to work with consultants from Strategy & and they really shed some light onto me regarding consulting. You are absolutely right that I was under-prepared, but I only had a few days to prepare due to the fact I was fast tracked. I am not in a dire need for a job at the moment, and I am looking for help on the steps I should take for the next hiring period. Should I go for the MBA? Do you think my profile is a good fit?

consulting,320fvf,LookOutHats,2,Thu Apr 9 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"Great to hear this more detailed background because it communicates that you were under a time crunch rather than just not putting in the effort. In fact, if your feedback was presentation skills, my read on that is actually pretty positive. I obviously don't have all of the information, but it suggests to me that you ""get"" the logic of how to do a case interview; the nuts and bolts are largely there, which is great with only a few days practice. What ""communication skills"" means to me is that you need more practice presenting your ideas in real time, stepping through your framework, analysis, syntheses and recommendations seamlessly.   In my opinion, the best way to get there is to find people willing to practice cases with you. I'd suggest starting with peers that are also interested in working in consulting. You can google ""insert business school name here case book"" to find a huge number of practice cases. You interview them, then switch, and they interview you. You'll learn a lot by being in the interviewer's chair. After you do enough to be comfortable with the format and aren't using ""canned"" frameworks right out of Case in Point or from Victor Cheng, then start looking for opportunities to practice with people who actually work at firms. They can give you targeted feedback, but you want it to be detailed polishing things at that point.  As far as how to actually get back into an interview, MBA is probably the biggest pipeline. I'd talk to your friend at PWC or the people from Strategy& that you've worked with to see if they do any off-cycle recruiting (not likely...) or if they interview people 1 year out of school and for what position."

You've missed the boat on most of the consulting hiring.   Second, it shows from your post that you don't really know consulting and that comes through in your interview. People practice for 2-3 months for case interviews (at the MBA level), and probably 1-2 months at best at undergrad level for MBB. Doesn't hurt to think of that as your benchmark.

A lot of times technical interviews are just about providing a detailed account of your background and what you have done specifically with those regulations you mentioned. For example if you have worked on lookbacks of a bank's consumer lending clients, you should be able to speak to -- at the least-- the relevant templates and forms. I'd recommend reviewing the forms more so the regulations themselves as on these types of consulting projects, you will end up working towards the form more so than the language found in the regs.   I'd also recommend going through the CFPB website and checking their Law & Regulation dropdown. Skim it-- you won't have to recite the bank examination manual by heart or anything.   Additionally, keep some big picture answers in mind if they want to end the interview with an open ended question like ""in your opinion, what is the biggest risk facing multinational banks"". Skim the NYTimes for some ammunition for this question.   Mostly though just speak to the details of what you have done-- specifically if you have worked with any models that relate to mortgage banking.   Most importantly be yourself and show that you can think through a problem. Good luck! It's a great field to be in and i've seen dozens of folks at my firm coming in with an industry background.

We won't worry about real slidecraft here; we just want to get the content right.  Once all the content is there and the slide basically looks like what we want, we'll ship it off to our support services offshore (we call them slidemonkeys, which I know is mean).  Normal project work:  We make the slides in house.  The are expected to be at about 80% of the quality we'd expect from support services.  The main difference here is that these aren't 100 slide decks or anything; they are much smaller but have a much faster turn around time between crafting and delivery.  There isn't any time (or reason) to ship them off.  To answer your question directly, you will be makes TONS of slides.  You will be ""up into the wee hours of the night hammering out iteration after iteration of slides before presenting to my manager"" as you put it.  Fresh BA's are PPT/XLS/meeting notes monkeys.

Reality check: you don't know sh*t about how the business world works.  Over the next 3 years of your life as a BA, we are going to pile work on you in every conceivable discipline and industry sector.  You are going to learn more about business than you could ever imagine.  Every slide you create will teach you a new business idea or way of presenting information.  Every worksheet you build will teach you a new analysis technique.  Every meeting you scribe will teach you a new facilitation technique or though process.  Now, you should make effort to minimize the work you do for that slide craft without minimizing quality.  Find templates or other slides you like and save them; I have a deck with over 500 templates I scan through whenever I need to make a new slide.  It cuts the work down by at least 50%.

I've had some interaction with MckD (as we affectionately know them).  ""Digital"" practices are quite different from traditional IT consulting. Most don't do implementation for starters. Their core services focus on questions like how can your business establish an effective presence online or better deliver its services via online/mobile channels as self-service?  So, in my area (FS) this is things like defining a customer's integrated treasury offering in commercial banking, payments API offerings (think paypal, but offered by a bank), mobile/online product and customer engagement strategy, customer insight capabilities and more niche things like real time per customer product pricing (think pricing a loan on the fly based on a customer's spending behaviour and then serving them an ad for that loan on facebook - all in the time it takes for the page to load).

Content follows. Outcomes & takeaways: start with the 3-5 clear, unambiguous messages the audience needs to walk away with and work your way back from there. Who Then What: start with the audience, and develop content catered to the attendees.  Detail-oriented VP from finance?  Charts and data.  Busy CMO?  Lots of sizzle, light on text.

Yes, and no - yes I definitely tackle clinical questions, both in terms of drug development and product launch, but that's not the extent of what I do.  Some firms focus on a niche, some will try to have you develop a niche within their broader focus, but some will let you cast a wide net and learn skills and content broadly.  In my company, we don't make teams with a ""clinical"" guy and a ""commercial' guy and a ""forecasting"" guy - rather, you get to wear all of those hats, and those who can excel across multiple dimensions are very fast risers.  YMMV significantly at other firms.  In terms of who firms like us recruit, yes we hire UG at the Analyst level.

Thus my initial comment on your background - we're looking for Mol Bio, Biochem, Chem E, BioE, BiomedE, Pre-Med.

You miss your family and your friends learn that you don't exist during the week.  You drink because there is nothing better to do other than work.  The trick is finding out how YOU will personally survive it.  I get to the office early (7am) and rarely stay past 6.  I go out with my team at least twice a week for dinner.

consulting,31kwdk,Kenneth_Parcel,2,Thu Apr 9 02:53:44 2015 UTC,"So I'm a bit confused about what you're hoping for, given this line:   consulting firms with a stronger emphasis [...] on the sciences [...] I'd appreciate suggestions.   I don't think you're likely to find any strategic consulting firms that specialize in 'science'. I think for that you would probably want a consulting firm that deals with an aspect of applied sciences (geotechnical, chemical process etc), but those are all sort of engineering firms (think SNC-Lavalin).   That said, if you've drank the consulting Kool-Aid, there's nothing about a science background that should limit you from pursuing consulting. Analytical thinking, problem solving, reasonable quant skills are all going to help in consulting firms, and a degree in a technical field might (depending on the firm and geography) give you some credibility compared to underwater basket weaving.   Finally, it's always a recruitment event. Even if they're not recruiting, there is only one reason consulting firms do on-campus events (hint: it's not to fulfill feelings of nostalgia). In every interaction you have with someone from MBB, put your best foot forward, look to learn what they love about their job/company, and get a feel of if you'd like to live that day-to-day. It's not for everyone, but it could be great for you. Sticking your foot in your mouth won't help you - if someone from the firm meets you at a 'not a recruitment event' and you embarrass yourself, it'll be noted. Buuuut .. If you're friendly, interested and interesting, that might be a point in your favour later on.   Just my 2¢ - I'm not a consultant, but have had enough interviews that I think I've got a decent network sense. Just no finish :-( lol"

It makes us feel important. Which is the second thing. You have to be ready to be working with very type A people. Very few people actually work in the office 8-8 when off the road. However you have to be prepared for everyone acting like they work 12 hour days when they work 8 and acting like they work 16 hour days when they work 10-12.   Don't believe the BS.

I just left a firm where I was on fast track to partner because I didn't want to spend the rest of my career building their kind of practice. I know I can succeed in what I'll be happy at because I'm a strong candidate.  Here's a good exercise- Start on the Fortune 500 at the top and find the first 10 firms from the top down working on ""big"" healthcare problems. Then go to AngelList or similar and find another 10 startups working on the most exciting problems you can  find. Then think about the 10 firms whose research or products you've seen be the most transformational. Get another 10 by talking to a peer that you think is super smart. Get another 10 by talking to the person whose career path you most want to follow. Now take each unique firm on the list and spend 5-10 min looking at the most interesting thing you can think they work on. (Or places that aren't in your area) Now cross off the least interesting ones until you're down to 15-25 firms. (Run out of firms? Go back and just solicit places from one of those lists or people you respect.) Now- Take those 15-25 and look at your LinkedIn network or career center. Take someone out to coffee from at least 10 of them. Try and take a high level executive or someone in an area you would like to work in. You have a simple proposition: You're interested in pursuing interesting and challenging problems and respect their firm. You want to hear about what and how their firms work on them. You want to see if the firm is the right place to build a career. Now- Take the most interesting 3-5. Those are the firms you want to look at.  Entry level private equity on wall street looks like 200k-500k with a masters. As an exiting PhD you could easily see somewhere between 100k-150k in most industries.

consulting,31kwdk,MolBioPhD,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:41:51 2015 UTC,"The only true answer you'll get is from (possibly multiple) face-to-face direct conversations with the people who are doing the work. It will have to be pointed questions- How many hours did you work this week? How many hours do you work on a typical week? Almost everything else will get you some sort of ego-covering or ego-enhancing BS. Even with these filters, have a critical eye and correlate. (Read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie"". Then practice the skills and read it again. It is arguably the most valuable business book out there in terms of overall long term payoff and understanding people's motivation.)  My second thought is that hours worked and work-life balance aren't the same thing. For example- I'm sure at some times your grad school experience felt overwhelming because there wasn't a clear line between ""home"" and work"". On the flip side I bet there were times it felt liberating because you could take a Tuesday or Wednesday from home without any oversight. Google or Facebook expect much/most of your time, but you'll get fed amazingly for free, have the opportunity to sleep whenever you want, spend some time working on passion projects, have your laundry handled in-house, and your commute consists of a luxury bus with wifi once you get to the bus stop. Both impossible hours and balance. Here's the truth though. Only you will be able to judge what makes your worklife ""fun"" enough to invest 10, 12, 14 hours a day in without being miserable.  The places to absolutely avoid will make you feel miserable every hour you're there and ask you for 12 hours a day. IMO no amount of money is makes it worthwhile."

The simplest example of what you are describing is something like a computer company (e.g. Dell) that purchases OEM components from different manufacturers, assembles them into a complete saleable unit that people can purchase, occasionally bundling in services (e.g. warranty).  More generally though, virtually any retailer in theory is adding some kind of incremental to the value chain - when you go to a large grocery store, they have the distribution to offer a wider variety of products than you could purchase direct from 'manufacturers' and/or they purchase at sufficient scale to offer you competitive pricing.

consulting,31ldci,mercury_hermes,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:28:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you. It's similar to Dell purchasing from different manufacturers, but in this case, the product is not an actual physical component of a device, e.g. hardware, it's software being sold virtually - not an actual retail storefront. Also, the business does not modify the original software and sell it under its own name and warranty, it simply offers a wider variety of product to customers at a much more competitive price - similar to the grocery store example you provided. In this case, is it still a VAR?"

As for consulting with ADD/ADHD, the good news is that it's one of the careers well tailored to ADD, since you're always doing something different.

consulting,31feva,doctordontdothat,12,Sat Apr 4 15:51:18 2015 UTC,"My counsel would be that you need to provide earlier and more consistent feedback. To not engage with one of your team members and let them know your expectations while also providing examples of it, is just being unfair to them.  How would you feel if you were on a project and received no feedback to then be given a bad review at the end.  You can't improve without feedback. Tell him what you want from him, when you want it and to what level/quality.  If he doesn't meet those expectations, sit him down and have a discussion about how you were looking for ""x"" but currently feel like you are receiving ""y"" and ask him ""how can we address this?"". This might require you putting some suggestions out there, like giving less critical work, giving him different work, or rolling him off the project."
consulting,31feva,HommyTearns,3,Sat Apr 4 16:29:56 2015 UTC,"I agree I need to provide earlier feedback - this associate only started working my part of the case this week, and I've been flat out all week so am only now reflecting on how to handle him.  A bad review would not be a surprise - he know he's under-performed this week.  Next week again is going to be hugely time pressured. I'm weighing up the benefits of micro-managing him more and just making him less critical. Rolling off is not up to me and would not be a good idea due to handover time etc.  I'll take your point about being clearer with exactly what and when he has to do. So far I've been giving him the sub-problem to solve, some hypotheses, some potential data sources, and sketched out slides + a check point and deadline. An experienced associate should be able to deal with that - maybe i need to treat him more like a new joiner :/"
consulting,31feva,HommyTearns,3,Sat Apr 4 18:21:13 2015 UTC,"The issue is you don't know what his background is right? So maybe he's had bad leads before that haven't helped him develop properly.  The second issue is, his failure is your failure in this case. Maybe its just a case of learning to work with each other more or maybe he's had something outside of work to deal with. But the expectation needs to be clear from the beginning, which no offense, sounds like you understand clearly in your head but didn't lay it on the table for him - I could be wrong though, there is some info missing.

That said, it needs to be prefaced with a frank and direct conversation:  ""We have a high pressure week ahead of us, and I am concerned we'll both burn out because of how last week went.  You have development needs that we don't have time to fine tune this week, so I will be as prescriptive as I can to help us both get through it.  I'm committed to helping you improve over the longer term but we'll talk about a development plan during our project review.""... or something like that.

Your job is to make the more junior consultants stronger when they leave the project than when they joined.  It saddens me that you do not think of your job as engagement manager to do that.  Second, it is okay to give someone a choice.  You are well within your right to say ""i am going to give you a choice, you can either A) work harder to ensure what product you give me is perfect or B) I will take this on it give to one of your teammates.""  If he chooses A.  Tell him the expectation will be that he works 90 hours to complete it if necessary.  And you will have regular checkpoints to make sure he is on track.  Manage him tighter but give him a choice.  He will choose A, if he does not... that is what you put on his review.  Otherwise if he does choose A, and works his tail off, you have no business giving him a negative review, the only person who deserves to get a negative review is you."

If you dont have an existing network then I suggest cold reachout to people on Linkedin, email, or even calls. But, be prepared to face lots of rejection. As an independent consultant, you should expect to spend a lot of time on sales, so this is a good training imo. You can try investing in PPC too if you think localized ads can work.

You are in what I think of as the ""recruiting donut hole"" right now - too much experience to be a campus hire and too little to be an experienced hire.  What you have put forward isn't going to be enough to turn any heads at a Big 4, much less a Big 3.  To get into detail, lets take each of your thoughts one by one:  1)  GMAT only matters to Bschool - it won't matter for exp hire recruiting.  A high GMAT is what you need to get into a top Bschool considering your undergrad GPA and weak work exp.  2)  It may help a little but you have to understand what it means to be an exp hire; you are bringing in either strong consulting or strong industry skills as proven by your track records.  While various certs may help, I can't sell your time based solely on a couple of certs.  3)  There are a million people with introductory accounting courses - I had them as a psych undergrad.  Means nothing.  4)  That will help you with the interview to be sure. The problem is that right now you won't get that far - no firm I know of would bring in someone with your skillset for an interview.  5)  Again, this is table stakes.  You need that stuff but it won't get a foot in the door.  6)  We've all read them so you should too.  Doesn't make up for a weak resume; anyone can read a book.  The tough love answer here is you need to get another year or two of work under your belt and then go get your MBA.

This means you have to go through the same recruitment process and filters as any other analyst.  For this your 3.0 GPA will be a problem. Consultancies hire raw talent not business skills. Your lack of finance etc. knowledge is not important, but your achievements so far in life are.  For now you need to really improve your academic qualifications.

Not sure if KPMG does this but in many companies they might have to interview a competitive interview to another candidate before they can make an offer.  For very specialized roles I've heard of instances where this takes months to find comparable candidates.  I would give it a week before badgering the recruiter, generally if you've made it that far in the interview process the recruiter is just as anxious to get things complete as you are.  Recruiters get badgered all the time by candidates so it's all just 'noise'.  The fact that you got a final interview means they will likely prioritize you higher than most who are in earlier stages.  But at the same time you don't want to come off as desperate, as it would likely hurt your negotiating stance.  Also rule of thumb always counteroffer, even if it's just 2-3% in most cases offers are more negotiable than people think, and if they are not able to negotiate they will tell you.

That could potentially be the source of your poor review.  If it is an issue of hours, you might want to think about going to an industry job.

consulting,3194o3,Ansuz07,2,Fri Apr 3 12:04:59 2015 UTC,"What's your role? You just said you were hired as a ""senior"" -- are you in a managerial position, just a more senior individual consultant?"
consulting,3194o3,theflyingcockroach,2,Fri Apr 3 13:31:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, welcome to being a grunt.  Tough love answer here - consultants work 12-16 hour days on projects during crunch time (about half the project).  If you can't commit to that, especially in your more junior years when you need to build your reputation then consulting isn't for you.  As others have said time and time again, consulting isn't a job - its a way of life.  You get good $$$ and great experience but it is at the cost of many other things in your life.  You can certainly be a good father/mother and a good provider as a consultant, but you need to understand that you won't be home for dinner most nights and you won't be reading your kids bed time stories.  Most days, you are a consultant first and an ""everything else"" later.  It sucks, but its the job.  Only you can tell yourself if its worth the sacrifices."
consulting,3194o3,Ansuz07,2,Fri Apr 3 15:46:42 2015 UTC,"So the first thing I'll say is that you should definitely get more detail on your review. If the review came from a PM or a lead, he/she should  be able to give you a clear indication of exactly what you should be doing versus just ""not performing at level"".  I also think your perception of adding value is a bit skewed. It's easy to think of consulting as this dream gig where you think about how to solve sexy problems and get to pitch your ideas. In reality (especially in tech consulting which it seems is where you are) you're contracted to deliver a specific set of deliverables and the value add from a consulting perspective comes at partner level, and less so from someone who is responsible for day-to-day. I'm also intrigued by what you said in another comment about your desire to offload work. It reads as if you ""can't be bothered"" to do the work yourself. Especially if you're new to the firm or the project, demonstrating that you can execute and get stuff done is critical.  Finally you need to think about what's important to you. As someone else said, the consulting mentality is very hustle-oriented, i.e., people working A LOT during the week. Leaving before the rest of your team does, while maybe important to you, will give off the sign that you're not hustling as much as others, regardless of how true that is. Plus, keep in mind that if everyone else at your level is putting in time for extra work, proposal responses, etc. then you stand out by not doing those things. It's all about perception."

At the very least you can keep the slides as templates and study them a bit to see the characteristics that make them good.

consulting,30z9lg,Kadin2048,2,Wed Apr 1 01:19:53 2015 UTC,"While there are many good answers in this thread, this one is the best.   You can accomplish three objectives here:  1. Get better at making slides (this is the easiest and least important objective) 2. Begin building a reputation as someone who seeks out opportunities to learn and improve. This is a key objective for you - you want and need leaders to see you in this light. Even something simple like ""I want to get better at building a great deck"" gives you the opportunity to plant the seed with leaders that you are eager, engaged, and ambitious. 3. This approach can connect you to other people in the firm who may be of value to you beyond teaching you good presentation tricks. The real capital of leadership is social capital; if you've built a large network and you have a high degree of ""betweenness,"" in other words, you're the connection point between networks that otherwise have few links, you're going to be in an extremely advantageous position. As cynical as it may sound, flattery is a hugely effective method to begin building a connection. Finding someone two or three levels up from you and in another practice or business unit and telling them, ""teach me your presentation-making secrets"" is going to open that door for you.

consulting,30z9lg,AzIdCoWa,12,Wed Apr 1 02:55:15 2015 UTC,"This is sort of a pet peeve of mine, so here are some thoughts.  The best book is Tufte's Display of Quantitative Information, but bear in mind when reading it that for better or worse, sometimes as a consultant what you will be required to do is the exact opposite of best practice as Tufte defines it.  (Bluntly: sometimes you will need to lie with statistics, sell a particular argument rather than just present it, or some unholy combination of the two.)  Most corporate PP templates are utter garbage.  Avoid using them if you possibly can.  The typical one will waste a fifth of the fucking slide on a shitty logo and banner running the length of the screen at the bottom, more at the top for a header, etc.  Just the. goddamn. worst.  Make your own, keep it minimal, put the company logo on it if you need to, and tell nobody what you did.  Just shrug and pretend you found it on some dusty share drive somewhere.  Making a slide deck that you will present yourself is very different for making slides for someone else to present.  If you are making slides for someone else to present (i.e. ""give me 10 slides on xyz to put in this deck...""), well, they are probably going to kinda suck.  Slides shouldn't be standalone documents; they're supposed to be visual aids that accompany a presentation which a human being delivers.  If you have to create the slides to be self-supporting, and in particular if you are working with morons who don't understand the purpose of the 'Notes' section or are too lazy to write a separate handout in Word, they're going to be wordy as fuck.  It's basically unavoidable.  Embrace the suck, let it flow through you, get yourself an extra drink at happy hour later.  Such is life.  However: if you are going to be doing the presentation that you are making the slides for yourself, congrats! You can make a deck that might actually not suck.  You will have to do your best to keep the deck out of the hands of people who are so used to shitty slide decks that they will fuck it up, though, by ""reviewing"" it out of context of the accompanying presentation and sticking a bunch of garbage on the slides that actually belongs in the 'Notes' section, or in an accompanying handout.    The ""three words * five bullets"" (or is it five words, three bullets? whatever) is shit.  I can always tell when someone has heard this and made a slide deck, because it'll be terrible. SO. MANY. BULLETS.  Don't be that person.  Most people, as much as they might claim to the contrary, can't read and listen at the same time.  So if they are reading the words on the deck, they are not listening to you.  You do want to minimize text on slides, but not just by creating hundreds of bullet points and dozens of slides to hold it all.  The slide deck should be for the people who are there seeing the presentation, not for the asshats who missed it and want to make it up later.  Again, the deck is not the presentation.  The deck is just the visuals; for someone to get the whole picture, they need a recording of the presentation.  So, if necessary, make sure you can get that.  (Easy solution: set up a web meeting with an extra laptop, point its webcam at the presenter -- not the screen! -- and have it record both the presenter video and the slide deck.  That is now your recording for posterity, and it will have both the slide deck and the presentation itself.)  Write your presentation first, not the slide deck.  If you write the deck first, you will end up presenting from the deck.  This is terrible.  Lots of people do it, but it doesn't mean it's not terrible.  (Actually, it's great, because it means you only have to be slightly better to in the top 10% of presenters.)  Instead, write your presentation outline first.  Nobody sees the outline but you.  In fact, you don't really even need to tell anyone that the outline exists.  Print it.  If anyone asks, it's just ""notes"".  This is the part of the magic trick that nobody else gets to see.   Then, using the outline, think ""if I were watching this presentation, what would make sense to be looking at?  What would I be writing down on my notes?  What wouldn't make sense?"" put that on the slides.  If something you're saying wouldn't make sense without a visual, add the visual.  If you want someone to write something down, put that on there.  And not much else.  Resist the temptation to put the outline of your entire presentation there.  Major takeaways, key stats, and supporting visuals only.  Go through your presentation and make the slides, noting (on your outline/private notes) where during the presentation you want to change slides.  There are two competing theories to slides.  One holds that it is better to have a single, fairly complicated slide (not wordy, but complex, information-heavy: think of an arch diagram for a big enterprise system showing the full stack, or a big org chart) and talk off of it for a while, referring to different parts of it with a laser or whatever.  This is the old-school, traditional way.  Nothing wrong with it, really, and I do it most of the time.  Back in the day when people had to make up each 'slide' as an actual 35mm slide, you didn't make up that many of them if you didn't have to.  This leads to a restrained, controlled, traditional style.  It's good if you want to be able to pause and answer questions.  The other theory is that it's better to have less-complex slides (again, most slides aren't words, they're visuals; so think of the same arch diagram or org chart but cut up into sections, maybe with a high-level summary at either end) and then you run through the slides quickly as you are talking.  This is a more modern style; it's what a lot of people try to do but do very poorly.  The key to doing it well is you flip through the slides seamlessly as you are talking.  You don't do ""uhhh, well on this slide..."" bullshit.  No, you cue the slides so they support whatever you are talking about, and you hit them every sentence or two.  It's very hard to get right and takes rehearsal, usually, but very effective when it is.  Google ""Lessig style"" and look at some of Lawrence Lessig's TED talks or other presentations if you want to see the general concept.  N.B.: It can come off as very hyperactive and ADD-ish.  Know your audience and if they're going to like that style.  If people are going to stop you and ask questions, this style is a hot mess.  Buy a presentation remote.  (No, your wireless mouse is not a presentation remote.  They're like $20, just get one.  This is your job, right?)  You can get one with a laser pointer if you want to; your cat will appreciate it.  This is another part of the magic trick to giving a good presentation.  The idea here is that with your notes, you don't have to be looking at a computer screen while giving the presentation.  Even if it's just in a meeting/conf room and not standing in front of a bunch of people, I still use the remote, just so that I don't have my hands on the keyboard.  Hands on keyboard = looking at screen = everyone else looks at their screens = not paying attention.  If you don't look at your screen, and instead you look at the other people, they are less likely to start looking at their screens, and more likely to remain engaged.  You refer only to the printed notes, click the remote with your hand, never looking at the monitor (look at the screen once in a while to make sure you're on the right slide, of course).  This is like a goddamn Jedi mind trick, and it only gets better as other people get lazier and lazier with presenting off their screens.  You're welcome.  In fairness, a lot of this might seem like ""Presenting 101"" and not ""Making Slides 101"", but that's because the entire purpose of making slides is to facilitate presentations.  If you are making slides for some other purpose, then really you are just using PowerPoint as world's most annoying drawing program.  Use Visio instead."

If you need a self-contained package of the presentation to leave behind, create a PDF. If you accept and adopt this approach, you will find yourself often getting frustrated with other team members who don't get it and keep whining that your slides don't have the words on them."

Find examples of powerpoint presentations or other displays like it that you really like, and try to create your own slides just like them. Then, over time, modify your slides so they're your own and not just a copy of someone else's (or don't, if they look good then they look good)  Also, a couple of random thoughts:   use words very sparingly assume that 90% of the audience has a very short attention span assume that 90% of people don't care about what you're talking about unless you make them care."

The approach of focusing on solutions generally leads to people not tackling the root cause of a problem and they end up putting new paint on a rusting car.

Your bullet points are missing quantifiable results.  Good resumes say what you did and what the results were.

Also, it may be a worthwhile investment for you to get an MBA, as long as you use that as a means to network, and get internships.

Make sure that you frame it in such a way that your new employer has a heavy focus in Y type work to the move seems to be a more natural transition based on your interests.  Downplay the fact that you want to travel more or don't like the local offices.  Do NOT mention the grad school thing.  No one will hire you if you put on the table that you are looking to leave in <2 years.  Keep in mind that you get to pull the trigger on this once at your current level.  If you join another firm and decide you want to leave again, you will look flakey to the market and that severely limits your desirability.    Now, that all said, my recommendation would be to not move.  You are only looking to stick around for another 1-2 years and then go to grad school, so I would tough it out at your current firm."

Nothing is worth being miserable for 12-24 months just to get a leg up; I've done it and I don't recommend it.  That said, explore all of your options first.  You've mentioned that you have ben staffed locally lately - have you talked to anyone about getting staffed on more traveling engagements?  If people know you are unhappy, they may be willing to work with you to get you on the road more.  Same goes with moving offices - have you talked to anyone about the fact you are unhappy and want to move?  You'd be surprised what most firms are willing to do to keep you happy if you are just willing to ask.  If someone in my group came to me and told me they were unhappy living in my city, I'd make a few calls to see what offices were options for them.

I'll say again, only you can tell us if you are unhappy enough to take a career hit on this one.  Its just a job and you should never be miserable doing what you do where you do it.  At the same time, every job has times where you have to just suck it up and push through for the good of your career (wait until you do start traveling; you'll end up in BF nowhere for 12 months working for a terrible client at some point in your career).  You have to tell us which scenario this is.  For now, try finding something that you like about your city or your team.  Really push yourself to get out there and make new friends.  If anyone on your team is traveling, they won't have anything going on in the evenings so try to get some happy hours or dinners set up.

I can tell you that even coming from a target school, it is SO very difficult to get entry-level positions in consulting w/o OCR, and I only got the interviews I did through intense alumni networking. So either try that, and/or wait until MBA to try to catch OCR again. I don't think R, MatLab, and the like really matter when it comes to analyst applications, as those are more pertinent to industry roles (I also have those programming skills and have never once been asked about them at an interview).

I had ~4 years post undergrad experience, 2 years in an unrelated industry and ~2 years with tangentially-related consulting experience. I don't have an MBA/masters and am still very much on the fence about going for one because it's pretty expensive.   I networked my arse off and then used my experience to sell a higher-level narrative that can be applicable to basically anything. I ended up taking a spot at one of the Big 4. I had 3 phone interviews (never had to go in person) and changed my interview approach after I said the word ""no"" a lot more times than I like in my first interview.   I focused on things like my approach to issues/situations, project management, client management, co-worker management, and a story about a time where I thought I knew everything, argued my point-of-view mercilessly, found out I was being arrogant, stubborn and way off base, and then finally acknowledged I was wrong and referred to it as ""one of my biggest learning experiences,"" which it was.    I made an effort to address their high level concerns and sold my diverse experience as a testament to my passion/ability/inclination towards learning new things and stepping up to challenges (also true).   When you network, make sure you research the industry (so you have a conversation), and convey the idea that you're interested in learning more about the industry. DO NOT reach out and say ""I'm reaching out to you because I want you to help me get a job."" Focus on showing your interest and having a good conversation.  At the end, I usually said something along the lines of ""The reason I reached out to you is because I'm looking to make a transition and wanted to learn more about what's going on in the industry so I can position myself as the best possible candidate.""   Sometimes this approach works, sometimes it doesn't."

I'm going to be the downer here; odds are you are not going to get time with any of the respected consultancies quite yet.  You are not at a point where you are in our OCR pipeline and your experience is too little to make you a qualified exp. hire.  While I am not saying that you should give up on the networking, I would suggest that you work your backup plan as well.  Try to get some exp over the next 2-3 years that will put you in a good position to get into a top notch MBA program.  If you are unable to get into consulting during those 2-3 years, take the time off and get your MBA; that will serve as a career ""reset"" button and get you back into our recruiting pipeline again."

consulting,30pbdo,conthrow31,2,Sun Mar 29 16:35:42 2015 UTC,"First the mandatory ""Europe =/= US"" comment. You're talking about a lot of nations with very, very different cultures. So of course you'll have different office hours etc, depending on the nation it is in.   However, the US has regional differences, and this is mainly because the type of work and the type of clients. NY offices/ SF offices are notoriously difficult, for example.   Specifically for Germany, it is just a cultural thing. Face time is important, and hierarchy (even if MBB tries to be flat) is an important factor. You'll be sitting in the office until 12 for no reason. I'd also say that the type of people that work in Consulting in Germany are just mega Type A (more-so than US), and its a bit of a self selection problem that leads to this."
consulting,30pbdo,ddlbb,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:44:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, sorry, I should have specified that I meant different reputations as to the ""quality"" of the consultants and their work.

consulting,30pbdo,conthrow31,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:00:34 2015 UTC,"Ah yes. I see what you mean -   There are definitely reputations - but I think a lot stem from culture again. For example, Germans are really good at what they do (probably some of the best consultants), but working on a team can be really frustrating with them at times (I am German by the way).   I think you might also be hinting at that some offices are ""weaker"" than others etc. I try to stay away from this, as there is always a minimum bar you have to meet to get into MBB. However, competition ""to get in"" is fierce in certain offices... so take that as you will.

I have installed on my phone at this moment:   United SPG Marriot Uber Carey National Rental Car   Having quick access to those when you need to find reservation info is useful.  Tip 2 - TripIt.  Pay them the $50/year for premium.  I just forward them all my reservation confirmations (plans@tripit.com) and it automatically add them to my account.  Subscribe to your trip calendar in Outlook and you'll always have all your travel on your schedule.  Tip 3 - Some sort of scanner.  I use OfficeLens for my WP but there are a lot of great scanner apps out there for IOS and Android.  The goal here is to scan as much as you can - paper is your enemy as it is heavy and gets lost easily.  Tip 4 - Cloud Storage.  This one is a little tricky as your firm may have rules against storing client or firm documents in the cloud.  If they are alright with it, look into a good cloud storage service like Box.com, DropBox.com or Onedrive.com.  Store EVERYTHING there.  Nothing is as useful as being able to quickly send a document out or find meeting notes when you are sitting waiting for your flight to take off.  Tip 5 - OneNote.  Even if your firm has rules against cloud storage, OneNote should be alright for your personal notes (YMMV).  I use it to store all my meeting and project notes so, again, I can access them anywhere.  With Office 2010 and later, you can even integrate with Outlook so you know the exact date/time/attendance of the meeting as well as directly store emails for reference.  Powerful thing when someone calls bullshit on something you heard in a meeting and you can pull out the exact meeting it was discussed.  That's all I can think of for now.

You should also attend careers events at target schools and apply for any 'meet with us' type events posted on recruiting websites. Also worth emailing the recruitment teams to ask how someone from a non-target school can find out more about the company and meet with some consultants.  The target-schools approach is not a hard and fast rule, it's more a way to stop recruitment costs spiralling out of control.

That is pretentious at best and not supported by your education and skills.  You state what you did - but nothing in a way that would have me call you. Resumes are door openers and as such need to tell me what you can do for me! Normally in the faster better cheaper kind of thing, with more powerful action verbs.  Sadly it's a wall of text that would hit the shredder back in my days of reading resumes.   You need a more active resume, one that grabs my interest and is focused toward a specific skill set or job description.  As said in the link below:  A great resume doesn’t just tell them what you have done but makes the same assertion that all good ads do: If you buy this product, you will get these specific, direct benefits. It presents you in the best light. It convinces the employer that you have what it takes to be successful in this new position or career.  http://rockportinstitute.com/resumes/  Google powerful resumes and find more plus words to use and words to avoid as well as phrasing help and more.

If someone pulled an offer from me over an attempt to reasonably negotiate I would assess that as not a place or a person worth working for.  There is nothing wrong with negotiating, done reasonably.

Exp hires have more latitude to ask for more because they have a) a better skill set and b) more options available.  Both provide negotiation leverage.

You have 10 people for 2 positions and you picked me, I would imagine there is a reason and I should make sure your selection of my expertise is fairly negotiated.  There is a reason people who job hop have so much more salary growth.  I agree everyone should be aware that it* does happen, but they should also reflect on whether pulling an offer over negotiation is appropriate instead of simply saying no to the negotiation.  From the company side there is no risk in saying no to negotiation when you would have pulled the offer.  If you pull the offer, no chance you are getting the person you want.  If you say no to negotiating, you still might get the person you wanted.

I'm certainly not saying I agree with the practice; I do think that simply saying the offer is non-negotiable and letting the candidate decide is a more rational play.  The original statement was just a warning. One thing you learn quickly as a consultant is that not everyone - even consultants - is rational.  OP was stating that, as a brand new hire, you should feel free to negotiate.  I was merely offing a counter that that strategy does have risk and some downsides. Any candidate, especially one that has an offer from a prestigious firm like MBB, should weigh those risks against the rewards.

That has put a glut of JDs in the market for other positions that traditionally have only been sought by MBAs and the like.  I get that you may not like the idea of being a Jr analyst (which you probably wouldn't get - I'd expect you to come in at a Sr analyst level like the MBA hires) you may have to accept that.  We hire based on what your experience says you qualify for rather than the level you feel you deserve.  If you are applying for a job where your law degree will be a boon and you can clearly articulate why you are a better choice than the competition (in a way that will resonate with the firm) then yes, you should try and negotiate.

Remember, negotiation is about what you bring to the table and how it benefits THEM.  That is how you extract greater titles and money."

The core of what we do is walking into our clients and trying to explain to them why our experiences and knowledge are important enough to justify our bill rates, especially to people who have 20+ years of experience in an industry.  If you are really interested in PP consulting, I would stress that an understanding of the law is inexorably linked to any public policy discussion.  You have a natural advantaged in that you understand the law - its wording, its development, its nuance, etc.  This gives you a leg up in that you will be able to get up to speed on whatever aspect of the law your clients are dealing with, even if it is an area that you were previously unfamiliar with.  If I were interviewing you for a PP consulting position, that would probably get my interest."

Other general ideas: have you gone to job fairs?  Go to them.  Go to job fairs at other colleges, if your college doesn't do them or you don't like the selection.

Are you near a big city where you can go to one of those free-floating career fairs that sometimes pop up in hotel ballrooms and the like?  Again, they can be useful.  I would question the wisdom of going directly from undergrad to an MBA program.  Although you can always find people who have been successful taking basically any path, if you are from an undergrad program that's really unknown, to the point where you're not getting any decent job offers, I ... question what sort of MBA programs you are going to be able to get into.

They have job fairs that are open only to members.  It is not a requirement to be a supply chain student at ASU to be a member.  Look into that sort of thing.

You can also just go on websites and apply--you don't need to go through a career fair to get an interview/job, but it may increase your chances of landing an interview as you can get a little face time and make sure they actually review your resume.  I agree with Kaden that you should expand your search.  If you want to get into consulting, get into consulting--the prestigious firms are all anyone talks about online, but if it's the work that interests you rather than the internet cool guy points, you can probably find a consulting job.  At the very least include Accenture and Deloitte in your search, but you can also look into IBM or boutique firms.

For me, the merger has a few interesting aspects:   This is a signal that 3G still believes there is value to be realized in the CPG foods category.  This is interesting, considering relatively flat growth (and even decline in some lines) due largely to shelf food brands being perceived as less natural and less healthy.  We know 3G has a proud history of ripping excess and costs out of the companies that they acquire, so we are sure to see some of those things happen as a part of the merger. Remember that Kraft spun off its snacks and international business into Mondelez back in 2012; this is an interesting opportunity to double down on the foods brand lineup and get to the kind of share that will lead to a shift in influence with major retailers (note that this now makes the combined company the third largest food company in NA, which means something when you are negotiating with partners like Kroger, Costco, 7-Eleven, etc.) I personally think both Heinz and Kraft have been slow on the uptake in transitioning their portfolios to take advantage of two modern CPG trends - health/nutrition product lines and digital channels for advertising and marketing.  While the next year or so is likely focused on merger-related activities and realizing cost efficiencies, I think it will be interesting to see how they choose to massage their brand portfolios (maybe phase a few of the underperforming brands out and bring in a few new ones) and how they will take the category in total to market.

For example, if Kraft has a factory that makes a huge product but has the capability to be portioned off and make a second product that Heinz currently offers, they can shut down Heinz's factory and save on those operating costs. Multiply this times the number of related products the two companies currently offer.   I feel sorry for the people that are gonna lose their jobs to this merger, but that's business."

consulting,30ai65,bigbee101,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:24:34 2015 UTC,"Right.  As a general rule, you need to report your entire income to your home state and then claim credits for income (and taxes) paid in other states.

But they hire the best and brightest out of the best and brightest schools. they can be more picky about which schools (and especially gpa, extracurriculars etc.) they recruit from. i'm not sure how prevalent they are in the typical state school though. one thing i've read about is that knowing your numbers is always important. i've heard some people stress that to the point of even suggesting an accounting/finance degree to help form one's foundation. i think business adm would fall into this as well.  overall, i don't think there is ""one"" major like you would typically see with lots of other professions. /u/1avi makes a good point in that knowing how to talk and act like a consultant are big skills to possess. some of the soft skills like this are more general and i wouldn't really say fit into a particular major, for the most part.  hope that info helps.  edit:  just some good tidbits here if you are just looking for general knowledge. keep in mind, this is the highest level to work at in management consulting. there are other places too.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(management_consultancies)#Recruitment http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_%26_Company#Recruiting_and_compensation   Many of its recruits are Baker Scholars, Rhodes scholars, Marshall Scholars or White House Fellows.

Given that you are still in school and willing to learn is a good thing. Now there some prerequisites in your resume which I think are necessary and will be taken into account if you apply for a consultant position.  1) Good debate or public speaking related certificate.  2) CGPA on a higher scale.  3) A nice Intern,  In which you can show that you were kind of project manager or were responsible for something important( if you dont get this kind of Intern, just write the work in such a way)  4) You must be kind of likable douche.  5) you must have a vibe around you that you know everything and can do any task given if you have the resources.  6) Make sure your resume highlights the results you have achieved. It should not be plain text about what you have done.   I know these things because every year around 40-50 students gets placed from my college in top consulting companies (BCG, McKingsly, Booz, Bain) and all my friends and seniors who were place in these companies had the above features.   I will try and get their resume and mail it to you if you are interested. Also you should go on LinkedIn instead of Reddit if you want to know about career options. Get off Reddit go to LinkedIn and see the profiles of consultant see their qualifications, intern, projects and experiences and evaluate your current state and make a road-map of what you need to do to get to their level, make a time-frame in which you want to achieve that state and work upon it."

I thought that you were a complete newbie who knew nothing about consulting asking basic questions. A consultant always asks question reflecting his own knowledge and pretend he know more than the one he is expecting to answer.I know it sounds pretentious but a good management consultant generally needs that quality(or he must be outright brilliant, which sadly very few people are).

With regard to travel, in most cases you either have to specifically seek out travel if you want it, or go into a firmwide Principal role where travel is expected but far from constant.  You are never forced to travel, or even take a role you don't want.  I have never had to work on a weekend, though I have chosen to put a few hours in on a few occasions (mostly operational stuff, not project-related).  I think I've spent more time attending social/philanthropic events on weekends than I have working (should I admit that? :) ).  Most people at Point B are generalists.  There are people who are dedicated to specific industries or practices, but most of us work across all of them to some degree.  With that said, the majority of our work is in Project Leadership Services, so that's where you'll spend most of your time by default.  It's very easy to move into one area or another, but there is no clearly defined path into specialization.  My Director (and I think this applies generally) is very supportive of my career development goals, but it's up to me to define and take the initiative to achieve them.

consulting,305y6b,Crash_Coredump,8,Tue Mar 24 21:19:52 2015 UTC,"As someone who has both been on and led their share of less-than-successful projects, I think there are a few simple things you can think through:   What went well?  It's especially hard on unsuccessful projects to recognize the things that went well, and recognize folks' positive contributions.  As a lead, it's your job to do this for your people so they understand what they did well and that you value their contributions. What went poorly?  If it was your team, what did you do wrong and what decisions did you make?  If it was your client, what risks and issues didn't get fully mitigated? Why is it going to be different next time?  If the issue was on your team's side (it doesn't sound like it, but pretend), are you going to build in more contingency, staff different skilled/level resources, recommend a different approach?  If the issue was entirely on the client's side, what red flags are you going to look out for in the future that you can use to trigger corrective action, or - most dramatically - even back off of the work altogether?  In my experience, the nature of consulting is such that it's often rarely the case that we're 100% in the right and the client is just a shambles, but everyone's mileage will vary.   Write all of these down.  For the positive things, find time to tell your team that they're doing the right thing, but sometimes you don't always get a win.  For the remaining negative things, line up your contingency and/or exit plans and find the right balance of bridges to cross and (hopefully not) burn.  For the lessons learned, think really fucking hard and get a tight list that you can share with your own leadership and your peers on other, similar projects.  Get feedback on the list, make it great.  Make it teachable and something you can conjure up in your mind at will.  And sit on it.  At the end of the day you are presumably going on to another project, and presumably leading other teams.  Do the right thing here, and finish the play as well as you can.  And when you get another crack, go back to that last list and know that even if this new gig is another clusterfuck, you will be taking steps to learn from your own experience and become a better leader."

I'm coming in as an experienced hire, so I'm wondering how invasive/comprehensive this check will be. I have nothing to worry about in regards to legal troubles, but my GPA isn't the best and my employment dates are not exact (as my most recent experience was at a startup and the start and end months were a little blurry - I continued to be a consultant for the company months after quitting the job, to ensure all work was handed off appropriately).

Many of the people they hire  they hire because they think they will make good consulates not necessarily for their strong tech/Mgmt background.

While management consulting can serve as a springboard to something like that, I don't believe a short stint at a MBB is sufficient to transition into venture capital in the absence of the above, unless you're a top performer at one of the top three as an analyst and are recruited right out of your class during your first two years.  If you want to work ""in startups"" you should work for a startup.

If you can find a ""genuine"" startup -- meaning, we have this idea and we really intend to execute, NOT we found some schmuck who gave us $3mm so let's act like children, then go for it.   Having worked in a startup-like environment (startup funds), I could also tell you that it would be important for you to try to pick something that you REALLY believe in, because you're likely going to work really hard for little (or no) compensation. You're going to really burn out and get bitter if you aren't really that into the website that allows you to download wall paper patterns for your doghouse that you can print at home.... Whatever it is, if you go to one, make sure it's something that you can really get into because it's going to take up a lot of your time and energy (if not most/all of it) and it's also going to somewhat form a big part of your identity going forward, so don't just pick any random thing just because you're dying to get into a startup."

I've only been in consulting generally it should be fine.  I'm also out of New York, although I'm 27 so my view may be skewed.  Interestingly from what I've seen depending on the teams / client you work with typically there's two groups regardless of age, the group that will go out have a good time who often times are single (although not always) and the group that are in relationships/married with kids who will maybe have drinks occasionally but aren't going to go wild. There are also quite a few people who are in their 30's in consulting who are single, due to a variety of factors.  The industry generally seems to lend itself to people getting married / seriously dating later.    Social life is entirely dependent on projects, although for the vast majority of my career I've been local and work around 45 - 50hrs on average a week, which has allowed me to cultivate a regular social life.

Staying local? Depends on your firm, but I wouldn't count on it at all. Even if you're local, you probably won't have time anyway.

consulting,303k7x,Crash_Coredump,6,Tue Mar 24 16:20:52 2015 UTC,"They are likely to find out. They are unlikely to care, but they might ask you about it. No sense worrying since it's beyond your control"
consulting,303k7x,overcannon,2,Tue Mar 24 05:03:54 2015 UTC,"They care if their clients care.  If someone clients may care and others do not, well it could be something they simply do not want to deal with in the future."
consulting,303k7x,Uilamin,0,Tue Mar 24 17:53:57 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate your comment, more than you might think. They did not ask about criminal convictions in the application process so should I contact the HR/Recruiting officer and let them know beforehand or just wait? Technically, it should be dismissed in about two months and I would then consider expunging or non-disclosure."
consulting,303k7x,Crash_Coredump,4,Tue Mar 24 05:20:32 2015 UTC,"OK, first -- the fuck is wrong with you? Who the fuck does this stupid shit?  Next -- were you actually convicted? Chances are the HR types are interested in convictions only (at least in my experience). It sounds like you got some sort of conviction-like status since you paid the fine, but I don't understand how it works in your case.   They will likely find out about it in any case. Even after May 30, this will probably stay in a bunch of databases anyway since they probably go to a third party to get this kind of info, not directly to the authorities."
consulting,303k7x,Crash_Coredump,3,Tue Mar 24 15:52:34 2015 UTC,"I'm very stressed out.   Kind of like that helicopter you painted with a laser? How did they even find you if you weren't doing it repeatedly? Dumb fuck.   Anyway, a deferred judgement is not technically a conviction. You can argue that if it comes up, after you're done arguing about how your personal judgement has dramatically improved since the incident. My advice is to take responsibility and not use the word 'accidentally' because nobody believes that shit."

consulting,303hre,cuddlezMeh,2,Tue Mar 24 04:02:24 2015 UTC,"I know EI rather well. I see them on the other side of RFPs pretty often. Like the rest of EY PI, its a pretty ""wide net"" practice and I don't think they focus on just analytics. They pretty much do anything with the word ""data"" involved except systems integration, from what I've seen. They're a pretty good practice.   My guess is they are looking to bring you on board for your quantitative background - but I doubt they'll ask you about math, rather what your ideas are for applying math to interesting problems within your industry vertical."
consulting,303hre,anonypanda,1 point,Tue Mar 24 11:12:48 2015 UTC,"They pretty much do anything with the word ""data"" involved except systems integration   I don't know why but this made me laugh...a lot.  Based on your feedback, do you think they will expect me to have a good amount of industry knowledge?"
consulting,303hre,anonypanda,2,Tue Mar 24 15:09:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that is true for any experienced hire role in consulting."
consulting,303hre,lsd3dgh24lkg3,0,Tue Mar 24 15:14:30 2015 UTC,"Oooh man...  I was only recently begun to show interest in the business understanding of data. So far, I only looked at data through a statistician's lens, trying to understand its distributions and properties than their business value.   Of course, I learned the business context around the problems I was trying to solve but only so far as was necessary to not make silly decisions when modelling.  Thank you for responding, /u/anonypanda!"
consulting,303hre,lsd3dgh24lkg3,2,Tue Mar 24 15:23:12 2015 UTC,"I interviewed for this group about a month ago and have a similar background. Really likable team working on some interesting projects.  My interviews weren't very technical (nothing about programming) and I think the only statistics questions were about how to compare and assess models. You will probably be asked to speak to any specific projects you've included on your resume. Most of the questions were behavioral: they want to get a good feel for how you'll fit into a team, whether they can trust you in front of a client, can you communicate well, are you someone the interviewer would want to spend time with while traveling or while ""on the road"". I also had a group case study but it doesn't like you will have one of those."
consulting,303hre,HommyTearns,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:37:52 2015 UTC,"Nice. It seems like you were extended and offer and accepted? I think I can do well with behavioral questions. At the very least, I can be honest and clear in my communication.  How was the group case study? Any details would be much appreciated!"
consulting,303hre,HommyTearns,2,Tue Mar 24 15:08:33 2015 UTC,I received an offer but took another offer instead.  The group case just came down to whether or not you knew the software development lifecycle.  Good luck!

consulting,301afh,WildlingTyrion,7,Mon Mar 23 17:56:54 2015 UTC,I don't believe Deloitte have the sub-levels you're looking for.
consulting,301afh,m1sta,2,Mon Mar 23 19:40:41 2015 UTC,"True, but they do have the concept of ""time at level"" which you can negotiate on the way in, so when you join you appear on a HR record as an SC with 2 years at that level, etc."
consulting,301afh,sionnach,3,Mon Mar 23 19:53:10 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, most of the Big 4 firms have formal levels and informal sublevels.  Levels are your specific rank - e.g. consultant, senior consultant, manager, etc.  Sublevels are your time in level (in years).  So a third year manager would be an M3.  From what I've seen, sublevels don't factor into promotions too much once you get beyond consultant or senior consultant levels; low level promotions are perfunctory while higher level promotions are merit based.  I've personally worked with SC2's who where promoted and SC5's that were held back."
consulting,301afh,Ansuz07,2,Mon Mar 23 20:36:36 2015 UTC,"Negotiate on salary. If there are levels and your salary request means that you need to be bumped up a level, then pursue it. Otherwise, there is no benefit from a promotion standpoint---you get promoted when you demonstrate that you deserve the promotion, regardless of whether you are a first year SC or a third year SC.   Additionally, being brought in as a newer SC has certain advantages. For instance, it gives you a little more time to figure out how things work and to ensure that your skills are on par or better."
consulting,301afh,Syncretistic,2,Mon Mar 23 18:50:52 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's part of the negotiation process. I'm not sure whether Deloitte has tiers or not but my firm has them for each level (3 for Consultant, 4 for Senior, 4 for Managing)."
