EA Access was a decent enough value at the time of its launch considering DA: Inquisition was on the list. It's only going to get better and really justify the price.   As for Xbox One getting it first, meh. Isn't it only like five days early? I don't really care as long as the PC version actually works.  (PS: Phil let Phil do his job FFS)"

InsideGaming,3ch73d,Montezum,2,Wed Jul 8 00:40:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure about that one. There are still people who whine about Sark, despite the fact that we get more of him now than ever.   I actually think the references are funny. They all get along, and honestly that's all that matters to them. I just feel bad because the Funhaus fans go out of their way to insult the current IG crew on the IG and Machinima channels it seems like. Now I know that it's only a few outspoken people but they are giving FH fans a bad name. I stay clear of even the FH subreddit because the outspoken few fans create such a toxic environment.

InsideGaming,3cczr6,brealytrent,3,Tue Jul 7 14:11:32 2015 UTC,"That is not the part that is bothersome. Besides most people pick careers that they think they would enjoy doing. Why should he have to stop making videos because of something that has literally nothing to do with the actual job?  Getting paid is important but it is not all important, and Pewds has a point: He raised TONS of money for charity and it was hardly picked up by any news outlets, but instead here we are talking about how much money he made; instead of money that he donated or something else that actually matters and changed lives."
InsideGaming,3cczr6,Azure_Jet,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:39:40 2015 UTC,First off he loves his job and his fans. But he just doesn't want the whole world talking about how much he makes and that he doesn't deserve it. Would you want people saying that about you? Secondly. You really think with twice as many fans as north Korea has people he could just up and stop. Right.

InsideGaming,3azuuc,Black_Nerd,2,Wed Jun 24 23:07:43 2015 UTC,"I don't really think they're screwing over the hardcore fans by giving them exclusive content, and there's year one content that's still to be announced   Edit: Also to my understanding, Year one players do NOT have to buy the DLC in order to get the Year One benefits   Edit, Edit : Also, the benefits that new players get are purely cosmetic. They get class items that help them level up faster to 20, the weapons they get aren't god tier raid weapons or anything either. This is really just a case of Hardcore fans feeling more entitled then anyone else who wants to play the game casually or get into it"
InsideGaming,3azuuc,ryswag123,2,Wed Jun 24 23:11:10 2015 UTC,"I dont think anyone is being fucked over, destiny is just rewarding the players who have been playing the game for a long time"
InsideGaming,3azuuc,strategicluck,2,Thu Jun 25 01:26:27 2015 UTC,"I'm completely out of the loop on destiny now a days, but let me say this  That amount of money for a dlc wouldn't be such a big deal IMO if the content supports the price tag. Sure when WoW release a new expansion for 30 no one cares because the amount of shit they add, story, location, enemies, etc... the difference  is that expansion can hold it owns for awhile.  Destiny isn't an mmo, and it lacks a story, and if it's anything like past dlc, you'll be done with it in a week.  There is NO reason the price should be that high unless they can guarantee an arm and a leg.   Like I said, I got destiny at midnight and put it down not to long after. No story, no challenge to max level (it's still not hard, just a little more time consuming)"
InsideGaming,3azuuc,sagertooth,2,Thu Jun 25 04:02:16 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, House of Wolves has had me hooked for about two weeks now. The story attached to it is really well done and I hope that The Taken King shares similar qualities to House of Wolves...just...do it bigger. Each Week there's a different Game Type tied to the House of Wolves in the Crucible which let's you play the DLC version of popular game types. The Trials of Osiris are very competitive, as well as the scrub dumbed down version for casual players. The Prison of Elders is what's got me so hooked. It's pretty much Destiny's version of a WoW/Diablo dungeon. You go in, go through rooms of enemies, fight a random boss at the end, then get amazing loot at the end and you get weapon/armor cores that help you get better loot. So, if The Taken King can provide more then that then I'll be happy with buying JUST the DLC and MAYBE the 20$ Special edition content...If I didn't have the game and wanted to get into Destiny, I would buy the 80$ Three DLC+Free Shit+Base game version."
InsideGaming,3azuuc,sagertooth,2,Thu Jun 25 05:01:15 2015 UTC,"Well, Bungie has put the special edition shaders and emotes in as a 20 dollar DLC. So long story short, old players are paying 60 dollars for 1 expansion and some in game cosmetics, while new players are paying 80 for a game, 3 DLCs, and the cosmetics. Doesn't sound super fair to me."
InsideGaming,3azuuc,djmattyd,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:03:54 2015 UTC,"It's not about being fair, it's about making profit. The Special edition Shader and Emotes don't change game play at all, Also have you seen the Sparrow and Shader that Year 1 players get for free...looks pretty hype."
InsideGaming,3az1t0,_Dorkus_Prime_,14,Wed Jun 24 17:23:33 2015 UTC,Potentially. Its tough since its on Origin and unlike Steam its hard to get numbers for concurrents. But Ill see what I can dig up.
InsideGaming,3az1t0,djmattyd,6,Wed Jun 24 17:57:30 2015 UTC,There are websites that have a player tracker for each of their games that shows the number of concurrent for each platform.  Edit:  http://bf4stats.com/ http://bfhstats.com/
InsideGaming,3az1t0,Valetorix,8,Wed Jun 24 18:33:39 2015 UTC,woah that is a crazy disparity in players
InsideGaming,3az1t0,djmattyd,4,Wed Jun 24 19:11:48 2015 UTC,Yeah when I first saw the sites it was when it was more on Hardline (around release time). Then slowly dwindled and now everyone is back to BF4 on PC.  Edit: not only pc but last gen too. Of course current gen is high because they don't have much else to play in the fps genre.
InsideGaming,3az1t0,Valetorix,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:07:32 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I'm talking aboot! The game started great at launch because of how fresh it felt, but now it's stale and with all the free Bf4 DLC coming out a lot of people are migrating over to Bf4.   Edit: That's the biggest issue with Current and Next gen consoles, there are barely any big budget FPS games coming out, and even though Hardline is more CoD themed, Bf4 keeps getting hella dope free DLC's and the new Dragon Valley and Forrest Temple Maps look beautiful, along with the Nightfall/Blackout versions of Year 1 Bf4 maps. Hardline has like...6 maps and only about 3 of the weapons are considered usable or ""competitive"" in the community..every other gun and gadget and side arm is just ""there"" to add some choice for players...and since you buy your guns with in game currency and not by ranking up weapon classes like in Bf4, there's no incentive for players to learn how to use guns or actually work hard. You just farm in Hotwire until you have like 90k, then buy one of the Competitive guns and never have to worry about using any other gun in the game."
InsideGaming,3az1t0,IGMilkSteak,2,Wed Jun 24 20:16:48 2015 UTC,"Awesome dude! LevelCap Gaming did a video on it. He's some what of the ""Leading Expert"" In Battlefield and it's community, lol. His video is kind of what got me thinking about it. The game DID sell well on both PC and console, but barely anyone plays it on PC because it doesn't offer anything that BF4 doesn't already offer. I think the biggest issue is lack of content at launch. It tried to be a BIT to much like Counter-Strike by having heavy objective focused game types, but they stuck to the BF4 map/Gameplay structure and ended up having awkwardly paced game types. Hotwire went from being an amazing game type to being unplayable because of how many people used the game type to farm Exp with RPG kills. TDM went to shit because they adopted CoD AW spawn style without realizing CoD AW has Zero laneing like most other Modern FPS games. Laneing being the structure of spawns and Spawn to combat ratio. A game like BF4 gives you specific spawns which give you two or more potential lanes(sections of the map) to go to right off your spawn. Hardline decide to adopt the ""Spawn anywhere"" CoD:AW style without realizing CoD:AW gave players huge freedoms the move about the map ANY way they wanted with it's double jump and parkour style game play. Conquest doesn't feel like traditional Battlefield conquest. It doesn't really offer players the massive destruction and Mil-Sim(Military Simulator) Type of gameplay that Bf3, Bf4, and Bad Company 2, all offered. There's no tactical play, no destruction, virtually no reason to work as a team. I've been into the Bf franchise since Bf2 and I thought Bf4 was going to be what bought the franchise above CoD in terms of Console shooters. Sadly Hardline might have just KILLED the franchise on the PC. I know I typed up a fucking novel about it and this is all just my opinion and perspective as a long time Battlefield player, but I think it's pretty note worthy news. Battlefield might have potentially been killed on the PC thanks to Hardline, meanwhile Battlefield 4 just got a Free DLC, and is getting something close to 6 new maps in a future free DLC, along with the rumored return of the legendary 10/10 Scavenger game type from Bf3's Aftermath DLC. They already bought back the Gun Master gametype and it seems like all they've finished providing premium content for premium/year 1 players and are now focusing on keeping the game alive on PC and Console by providing top quality free DLC. Hardline should adopt a similar method of DLC...and focus more on putting out small free expansions like Bf4's weapon create and Nightfall DLC packs."

After a while, the server browser failed to show any servers on multiple computers and now it just won't connect via Battlefields version of quick play matches [Play Now].

InsideGaming,3ardwl,ryswag123,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:19:47 2015 UTC,"Battle Toads hype exist purely because of the Game Stop prank call hype. It's a really challenging game but mainly because it's old and not developed well. The Last of Us is just over hyped beyond repair. I thought it was okay when I first played it. I thought to plot was really generic and some of the dialog and shit was laughable I kind of laughed when SPOILER ALERT Sarah died and I think the ending is awful. A lot of people try to justify the ending but I think it was just an attempt to twist the plot and ended up making the entire struggle through the game feel pointless. Oh, you want to cure the ""Not Zombie"" Virus, well go on this cool mission across I Am Legend and when you finally finish watching 20 hours of cut scenes how about we don't reward you for your efforts and turn a likable character into an asshole and polar opposite of who he was prior to this scene."
InsideGaming,3ardwl,_Dorkus_Prime_,0,Tue Jun 23 18:44:47 2015 UTC,"First off I dont know if you actually have ever played battle toads but for me at least it was a lot of fun, the gamer is in no way poorly developed just incredibly hard.

InsideGaming,3ardwl,ryswag123,0,Tue Jun 23 21:55:57 2015 UTC,"For the story. Diablo has had relatively the same gameplay since the first game, and while I enjoy the Dungeon crawling RPG aspects of it, what brings me back with each expansion of the franchise is the lore and development of Said lore. I like how Diablo returning in each game hasn't been some gimmick. The continuity in the franchise is very well done. That's also part of what I like Destiny, while the game is absent of lore and story, you can still go on Bungie net and read the entire history of pretty much everything in the Destiny Universe. And everything in those little lore cards and what not is really consistent and great, it's really great to know that someone at Bungie took time to write out thousands of years of history and lore for specific races and factions and characters and gamers claim there's ""no story"" to Destiny and that it's just "" space shooting stuff ""."

Also thanks for including me in your post.... wait you didnt. There is only so much that we can do. We are not here to create discussions and comment on everything. The job of a moderator is to enforce rules and keep order. You have now gotten me sick of seeing this time and time again.

InsideGaming,3avajw,_Dorkus_Prime_,3,Wed Jun 24 16:36:23 2015 UTC,You brilliantly summed it up. It's not my job to create conversation its my job to enforce rules. According to this other guy he thinks he could do a better job but hey.
InsideGaming,3avajw,_Dorkus_Prime_,3,Wed Jun 24 16:55:53 2015 UTC,"I work for GamezForums and I haven't posted a review or any sort of article in about 2 months. But I've removed well close to 100 post. It's not about HOW Active you are, it's about how committed you are to the website/reddit/whatever you work for.  On the Facebook groups I run it's the SAME way. I've written mobile wiki's for all of the Dark Souls games, including Bloodborne. But in my Dark Souls group despite being one of the main admins I barely post because I'd rather be outside skating or reading a book or something productive. So when people see me do my daily run of the group and see me telling people to behave and follow our rules and what not, they think I'm just being a dick. Sometimes you HAVE to be a dick to do your job, there are always going to be people who dislike you in life.  Anyways, I pretty much rambled off here. I don't think Ryswag implied he could do a better job, I think he's just upset that very little mods and IG staff actually post here....but like, it's not their job...they don't get paid to post on reddit, they get paid to give us shit to argue about over the internet."

InsideGaming,3ac8xy,Quickob,-7,Thu Jun 18 23:33:37 2015 UTC,"dang that is really harsh, personally I really like ali, hundar, lyle and phil, but just out of curisoty what are you suggesting? because to me it sounds like you want machinima to fire all of the new crew besides matt which would be more than a bit crazy ."
InsideGaming,3ac8xy,Quickob,11,Thu Jun 18 23:37:54 2015 UTC,"No not at all ! I LIKE THE GUYS ! But I just feel that they haven't got a real strong presence like for example Bruce did, maybe that's because they haven't had time to jell and let the audience get to know them much as the old crew did. I know the new IG are different obviously but they aren't as good yet because they haven't spent too long together working as a team."
InsideGaming,3ac8xy,fatbackwards,2,Thu Jun 18 23:57:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. They haven't found their 'voice', if I/you could put it like that. I posted in a long thread about IG when Phil posted about the shortcomings of the current IG staff, and I think that when they find their voice, it will work out better. At the moment, we're looking at what would be the 'shakedown' of the IG crew.  Personally, I have nothing against the IG crew. I just think they need to find the proper flow/jell in their lineup. Kinda have the feeling that the new IG crew doesn't have the experience in this 'specific' kind of comedy; and that, with practice and selection, they'll 'jell' together in a bit.  It's, honestly, just a matter of if the user base actually like what the final product would be from that 'jelling'. Frankly, what we need is to see how the full IG crew would work in gameplay videos. I, personally, don't watch the daily... so I'll be more skeptical of how they'll perform on gameplay vids; but giving them time to grow... I'm all for.  Long story short, I agree; and I hope they find a voice I like. :)"

InsideGaming,3a8bdy,tigrn914,-2,Thu Jun 18 03:12:07 2015 UTC,I think they were kidding but I agree with you Sony definitely won

Would anyone on /r/gaming go crazy about?  I understand people are sentimental, for loads of people that game is the pinnacle of RPGs. But come on! Its a fucking remake...

InsideGaming,3a8bdy,FEEL_THE_BAYERN,4,Thu Jun 18 02:45:57 2015 UTC,"The Last Guardian: while it does look cool was announced almost 8 years ago, it has lost a lot of hype and excitement over the years and can easily get delayed again, FF7 is a remake, they didn't have much faith in Shenmue 3 hence why they announced a Kickstarter for it, a kickstarter at E3 just to see if people still cared, No Mans Sky still looks amazing but no word of the release date could easily be delayed, Arkham Knight is multiplatform, blop3 is multiplatform, star wars is multiplatform, and Horizon Zero Dawn was the best thing they showed at the press conference.  Sony is doing the same thing Microsoft did a few years ago and put all their money into bonus exclusives instead of new exclusive IPs  Edit: Also they barely mentioned Project Morpheus, the Uncharted 4 gameplay was a meh, and no word on God of War 4."

My one sorta idea/comment would be to play games other youtubers dont typically play, that was something I always loved about the old ig crew. Im not saying the games have to be ""broken"", I just dont want to see the same games every other gaming youtube channel plays."
InsideGaming,3a8a6g,ryswag123,2,Thu Jun 18 00:49:31 2015 UTC,"I get what you mean, like some vastly unknown games on Steam and whatnot. That could be cool."

InsideGaming,3a8a6g,fatbackwards,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:10:38 2015 UTC,"Seriously, this is a tough answer. I kinda want them to do more of the old IG/Funhaus humor with steam roulette/broken games sthick; but, I don't want the inevitable comparison to Funhause/old IG. Given what I saw in their new videos, it wasn't my humor; and, again, I think the Funhaus way would be nicer...  I just really hope they don't have single person streams of games where one person comments, ala everyone else on youtube. Those are very boring for me, I like the whole 'Stanley and Waldorf'/MST3K style a hell of a lot more. They seem to want to keep it that way, but I hope people won't slam them for being like FH; even though I kinda want them to be. (@_@)  I guess what I'm saying is that I like the old IG/FH humor; and their humor, at present, isn't what is going to keep me subscribed if they keep on that.  But I totally would agree on them playing lesser known games. We really don't have many YTers doing that nowadays. If I have to see more GTA or Minecraft, my eyes will roll out (Unless the GTA ones have a specific 'function', like obscure challenges)."

Well, we'll see what they'll do in the coming weeks now. :)  Edit: To expand upon that, maybe they should try. If it doesn't work out, they can see where the positives on and build upon that. They've already done that with the previous gameplays, and the old Q&A sessions. I just hope that they take feedback from reddit/other forums to heart. The Dane Cook GTA video wasn't my cup of tea, but the Wolfensten video had me laughing... well, twice. That's two more than the GTA one. :)"

InsideGaming,39a8hq,_Dorkus_Prime_,2,Wed Jun 10 11:03:57 2015 UTC,They said that they don't have the man power to be doing more of those yet but they will in the future.
InsideGaming,398zmc,ryswag123,7,Wed Jun 10 03:02:34 2015 UTC,"To be honest the majority of the activity on the Funhaus subreddit is mainly comments on videos and fan art based on videos, something that IG doesn't have at the moment. So I'm hoping that when IG start to upload videos again (I think they said after E3) then the activity will go back up."
InsideGaming,398zmc,TriggerHappyHands,-1,Wed Jun 10 04:22:54 2015 UTC,"IG has daily videos which is a lot more than other youtubers who have more active sub reddits, and I think the issue does not stem from the lack of content but from the lack of active mods on this sub reddit."
InsideGaming,398zmc,TriggerHappyHands,5,Wed Jun 10 04:25:12 2015 UTC,"Their daily videos is Inside Gaming Daily which are news shows, I'm more referring to game play videos of which they have only done two I think. When IG started back up again I think most of the mods were pretty active but now there is nothing really much to talk about.   I'm not saying bringing in new mods is a bad thing, I'm more saying lets wait until they start uploading more content and then we can make a better judgement"
InsideGaming,398zmc,Aroused-dentist,0,Wed Jun 10 04:34:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with the logic that waiting until there are more gameplays before getting new mods is nice in theory, but there are 3 mods that have not posted on this sub reddit in 4 months thats ridiculous there are 4 mods that have not posted on this sub reddit in 1 month and as a fan of IG I just believe thats unaccepetable."

Do you have anything against new mods?"
InsideGaming,398zmc,Montezum,3,Thu Jun 11 05:03:56 2015 UTC,It's nothing to do with new mods. It's the way you have approached this situation. We do a lot of work without posting comments that you cant physically see because you are not a mod. Assuming that we do nothing is incredibly rude. It is not a moderators job to comment on posts instead it is their job to enforce the rules.

InsideGaming,398zmc,alibakes,0,Wed Jun 10 17:34:10 2015 UTC,"I honestly couldn't tell you the last time any of the aforementioned have even posted a comment here, let alone a whole thread. I think new mods would be a step in the right direction, but that's kind of an IG choice, not community."
InsideGaming,398zmc,Azure_Jet,3,Wed Jun 10 04:08:01 2015 UTC,"You should pay attention more because I'm here every day, friend. We did the Q&A thread every week but since they don't have the time to record and edit that anymore, we don't do it. I personally try to give my feedback to the content creators as much as I can but there isn't much that we, mods, can do at this point. The conversation doesn't have to begin from us and you guys can create any discussion thread as you want the same way that we do on /r/funhaus. We changed the look of the sub since the other guys left and since they are mostly only doing the daily show, this is all we can talk about. It's either that or posts of people talking about old videos from the other guys."
InsideGaming,398zmc,alibakes,-3,Wed Jun 10 11:57:48 2015 UTC,"As I stated earlier in this post you are actually doing a good job, but the other mods have not posted in months. I really think new mods would be very beneficial to this subreddit, but you are doing a very good job keep it up."

Not only are the current gen ones cheaper than ever, but GameStop (and a bunch of other retailers) are offering deals like $100 - $150 USD for trade-in value as long as it's towards a current gen system. That makes both of them much less than $200. PLUS Xbox regularly runs deals where you can get stuff like two AC games plus some other goodie, so minus the cost of the games themselves you're basically getting the console for free.  The only thing I can think of is that younger kids probably don't have the cash required to purchase even severely discounted systems. But still, most of the 18-25 year old people can probably swing $150-200 for a new console whenever they want."

InsideGaming,38slev,IGPhil,25,Sat Jun 6 13:30:17 2015 UTC,"I like that the daily have more than one piece of news and there's some bit of analysis here and there like the last Day-Z one, that was cool. If you focus on the quality of your content, people will come and will stop hating eventually. The gameplays weren't very exciting, but I'm used to a more frantic behavior in those, so maybe that's why. The more you guys get used to each other, the better this and the daily will get. I ain't a big fan of the Lyle guy mainly because he calls himself a ""douchebag"" but that's okay, I didn't like Joel back in the day either but I learned how to enjoy him now.  The big problems that I see are with the company and not with IG. It's strange to watch you guys rebuild for the third or fourth time again, so it doesn't surprise me that the fans will always expect the worse to happen and don't want to get attached to a group of people again. It's been years and years and people still talk about Sark and Sodagod. I really enjoyed that Hundar and the etc guys talked about the company's mistakes on that podcast. Put Funhaus behind you and try to do your thing.  Also, always be honest. Don't bullshit your fans because you're probably not the only channel that we watch."

The shows have been a good length, the jokes are funny, and, most importantly, the coverage has been pretty spot on. The length of videos are cool and I wouldn't mind longer reviews from Shibby (who is also totally fun to watch). I love Matt and Lyle and you, Phil, hosting! Very cool. In my humble, not-important, and probably not-helpful opinion keep doing what you're doing. Sorry if this isn't helpful or you wanted more critisism. I've been watching since Matt was hosting before and while the old crew is good and I watch them as well, this channel is better than stock TV and I don't feel stupid at the end, just entertained and informed. Are you guys going to do convention coverage like PAX and such? Just curious. Now I await the down votes."

I like the idea of a rotating co-host, but should you decide to go with a more permanent duo, I would like to see Matt and ali, or Matt and Hundar. Lyle I could take or leave, maybe leaning more to the side of leave.   All and all I think the show is starting to find its own direction, which is what it should do. Forget about emulating the past.

That said I don't have alot to improve just focusing on the daily. It was the gameplays of gta with mods, the diferent show formats and the funny comentary that did the trick for the old IG crew. I would love to see your take on that on the inside gaming channel. It's not gonna be the same but i don't want the same.

InsideGaming,38slev,Shaunwithau,2,Sat Jun 6 18:16:23 2015 UTC,"Content wise, pretty you're spot much on as far as i'm concerned, it's all been really good stuff. However; I really do feel there's a few things letting you down big time.  The audio comes across as quite shrill and echoey, and the set in my opinion is a bit drab, dark and dingy. I gather it'd be a ball ache to move everything somewhere else now, so maybe stick some sound insulation in that corner and get a few more spot lamps in on the action  I don't like the cheering much at the start of the show, especially when it's just Phil (bless him) and he's miles away it comes across as a bit... naff. In fact, you could try and step away slightly from the energetic ECT kind of style, and go for something more 'cozy'?  Matt does seem to have to shout everything; and his voice doesn't seem to do shouting particularly well - perhaps you could break away from the norm and do a gaming news show from behind a desk? Might be worth a try, after all every other show seems to make their hosts stand up and jump about. Perhaps you could host more chilled, friendly relaxed gaming show; with step daddy Matt and Uncle Hundar - and crazy uncle Lyle, and Ali the cute girl from next door.. Just a thought guys, cheers, and keep up the good work <3"
InsideGaming,38slev,MethBear,2,Sat Jun 6 18:37:28 2015 UTC,"I would say go back to your roots. The inside halo series was fun to watch when sodagod and deadpixed would banter back and forth. Then when it became inside gaming there was a lot of random things that made the show funny, those clips that came out of nowhere I'll go back every now and again and watch a few for a good laugh. The show is good now, the cast has a good rapport and all but there isn't anything that gives it that edge over other channels."
InsideGaming,38slev,Kidburman,2,Sat Jun 6 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"You Guys are doing Great,I'm hoping there will be more uploads to the Inside Gaming channel soon."
InsideGaming,38slev,fatbackwards,2,Sun Jun 7 00:33:23 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna toss my two cents into the pool. It's biased, but then again... opinions are. (Incoming Long Post)  I started following the old IG because they were different from regular LPers and PiewDiePie-like streamers. I wasn't here from the beginning, but I stayed on because of the content. It felt like I was watching either 'Stanley and Waldorf' from the Muppets, or 'Mystery Science Theatre 3000'; which was great, because many LPers don't cater have that kind of joke dynamic.  Viewing your films, the two that are gameplay videos (not including the daily)... I can see your program wants to (kind-of) emulate that. It's not just Mike or Lyle playing something by themselves, it's both of you sitting and talking, while playing. Great! I'm glad you guys kept to that dynamic... not as many LPers stick to that.  But, here's where the critical part hits: A lot of the jokes fell flat to me. In the Old Blood video, I laughed twice... and both times it wasn't the monologue, it was the quick ad-lib that was mentioned when something happened: -""Now who's the na----- zi....."" and the second part with the ladder.  The monologue between you two was alright, but not funny to me. I really had to struggle to not shut off the video and keep on listening. It seemed like there was more jokes coming from the outside world/pop culture sphere, and that constrained the ability to laugh at the situation at hand. Those parts I found funny was because it broke away from the monologue and showed some raw emotion/comedy.    It also seemed like both of you were really tense during the gameplays, especially during the Dane Cook GTA V gameplay... Lyle seemed like he was either going full-out, no stops Dane Cook blasting; while Mike, he didn't really get a word in. I didn't find the whole thing funny, because I'm in Europe, and Dane Cook isn't popular here... I know of him, but... even if we had to have jokes about him, it's not something I want to focus on. Dane Cook exists, and it's funny to make fun of him.. but to dedicate a whole episode about one bit; I don't know... that would be like me laughing about Urkel from 'Family Matters' and doing an impression of me doing Urkel campaigning for president, with copious photoshops of the Urkel-o's cereal box placed in the video... And, since the gameplay was just driving around in a car, there was really nothing else to catch my attention... and because of that, the video fell flat. I didn't find Dane Cook funny, and the spot-on impression didn't help make it funnier; simply because there was nothing done with it, it was just 'DaneCook' driving around spouting Dane Cook-like lines. If I had done the GTA V video... I would have set a major theme of 'trying to do something', or 'specific challange'; then, slapping on Dane Cook would have been a funnier situation, because ""oh look, Dane Cook is telling awful jokes while attempting to light a boat on fire, and all his jokes are fire-related!"" (Not that I would condone Dane Cook, good lord)  Look, I really don't want to come off as negative. I want to have IG be a channel that I watch daily, especially since you guys are talented...   But I'd recommend trying new delivery methods. Have Phil sit in on games, and offer two cents... and really don't be afraid to have some air linger in-between pauses. Sometimes, it's a lot funnier when someone just shows their reaction amid silence. Maybe keep the monologue to a minimum 'right now', and keep it more reactionary. Then, when you feel more comfortable, insert quips from current culture and whatnot. It's kind of the same reason why I don't really watch Q&A's... because, simply put, I know it's just going to be funny banter about nothing... and I really don't care. I hated old IG's Q&A sessions, and they had to earn my fandom for me to care.  It seems like no one has found their right voice in videos yet. Matt, you seem to be more reserved and allow Lyle to speak. Phil, I've seen you in previous IG videos, and know that you are reserved as Matt... but can blossom when push comes to shove. I've always wanted to see your take on someone completely blundering through Agatha Christie games. :) A lot of the time, the charm isn't about the shock value from Nazi jokes or Old Women 'book-smell' sex (like in the old blood video) or from impressionist jokes (like GTA V)... it's the soul you give to your videos. Try to allow your own personalities to flow into the videos, and practice off-screen to see who has a better comedic/content flow together. Part of the reason I kept with Funhaus/old IG was because the dynamic of Bruce/James vs Adam... where Adam would get bored real quickly and Bruce/James would get upset and team-up to try and take control of the situation, only to find out when they got control... they were doing things that would have been what Adam did. It's something you don't analyze directly while watching, but your brain noticed. :)   EDIT: And this as an aside in the Long Post, I... don't watch the Daily. I don't really care about gaming news as much, but that's just me... However, I don't know the other people that are referenced in the post like Ali and Hundar. Maybe they appeared in the Q&A, but... for the life of me, I don't know who they are. Maybe have a rotating cast do gameplay videos at the moment, and then go back after a few weeks to see who seems to play off of one another better. The Daily, while fine, isn't what attracts me to channels like this... it's the gameplays and humor.   Yes, I'm a big Funhaus fan... and I'd be the first to admit that. Simply because, I haven't found anyone who is similar. They have their own faults, as well... as many projects have... but, at the end of the day, it seems like they are having fun. And if you are having fun, then we are. Also, it seems like new IG is trying to range into the young, reactionary crowd with the style of humor... and while that's fine, it's not mine (example would be that battlefront video which Matt even mentioned in a Q&A session was a failure). We've got plenty of youtuber LPers who do that. I like jokes which are kept on merit of their own, not 'know this and this? Well, here's this in this (style of Family Guy, I guess. It's hard to describe... but I could use the GTA V video as an example 'Here's Dane Cook in GTA V')!' Don't try to force humor... often times the fact that you don't force it is 'why' it makes it all the more funnier.    TL-DR: (Jesus Christ that's a mountain of text): Calm down, less forced jokes and monologue, more reactionary jokes, allow for pauses, and try to make your videos (especially game that don't have a target, like GTA V) have a main subject which you can build upon, and don't try any more battlefront video-style videos... that was just /r/cringe worthy.  Sorry to pour salt on wounds, but sometimes it's necessary; and with videos that aggregate 1/3rd 'thumbs-down' on youtube, it should be a pointer that 'Hey, uh... lets try this again.'. I believe you guys have the foundation and framework to really make a good channel. The question is... who do you want as a demographic, and what style? IG always felt like it was dealing to my generation's age range (25-40), but the jokes and the style you have set up at the moment feels like more PiewDiePie's generation. But hey, if they like it... keep on it. I'm just suggesting like /u/IGPhil said. :)"

I honestly didn't expect anyone would read such a wall of text... but it was written out of a passion. I've had these frustrations while hanging around with the new IG, and just never mentioned it. To be honest, you and the cast work in media; and basically know what we're talking about. You've all worked in the environment for a while now; so I'm not about trying to tell you all how to do your jobs.  But, I mean, you search up Inside Gaming on youtube, and you get the channel, and then following the playlists for their most popular series (Chaser, Ride to Hell, Sims 3, Ubersoldier). They still work, despite the fact that most of them are more than a year old. The humor was timeless and it's still funny to this day. I occasionally jump back and watch one playlist all the way through. The game doesn't matter, none of those game were top sellers or current; the content made the game be remembered. Hell, I BOUGHT Chaser because of IG to attempt to beat it faster than they did, and so that I could anticipate jokes they'd maybe do.  Anyways, I'm really looking forward to seeing the new content now! I've been wanting another game channel to hound over. I think you guys will do well once you build up steam. All the best, I mean it!"
InsideGaming,38slev,weirdeyedkid,2,Sun Jun 7 15:03:19 2015 UTC,Your doing okay.   Try to make the show your own.  No pity claps to start the show.  Agree back the camera up about a foot.  And Matt speak with a bit more energy.  Sounds like your falling asleep most of the time.    Try and get some gameplay vids up with community members so we get to know you all more too.
InsideGaming,38slev,_Dorkus_Prime_,2,Sun Jun 7 12:04:32 2015 UTC,"More, just more. I like the last two gameplay videos with Matt and Lyle they rocked and the couch makes it seem really cozy. The gameplay videos of games that don't get to much time in the spotlight would be nice. We always see from channels GTA V, or some general FPS or GTA V so mixing it up would be cool. A regular podcast would be the best."

InsideGaming,38slev,ByTheBeardOfBruce,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:24:43 2015 UTC,"So I really like that the IGDs are back. The cast is stellar as is the content with special emphasis on that intro video from a couple days ago (sadly had to go back from wince it came). I know you guys hear this all the time but all I really want is more. As soon as gameplays drop, I'll pretty much be content.  What I don't particularly like the sometimes less than reliable upload schedule. Sometimes the IGD is up at 4-6 pm EST, others its honestly like 9pm EST. But lately (pretty much this week) it has been pretty consistent.  Side note: why is there no ""ding ding ding!"" for a Phil's pick anymore? Did Adam and Bruce steal that sound effect when the jumped ship? Or is it just locked away as future DLC?  Honestly though guys, I do appreciate everything you do. It's been a heck of a year just being a fan of IG, I can't imagine how much moreso it has been being an actual PART of IG. I look forward to all your future videos. salute"

If i search their channel from newest-oldest it only brings me as far back as February 2014. And if i search oldest to newest, i can only get to about 2007. I can't seem to find a way to access those middle videos, and i know the IG crew started their weekly gameplays on Machinima sometime in 2013."

InsideGaming,38q1ea,maggosh,-1,Fri Jun 5 23:48:32 2015 UTC,also there is not a lot of news right now with e3 coming soon

InsideGaming,38qcrw,romeozor,2,Fri Jun 5 23:06:14 2015 UTC,"Doom was really weird. I had this demo disk that included Doom and played the 9 or however many levels and thought that was the full game. It never occurred to me that there would be more to it. Maybe it wrote something in english about it, but I didn't know english back then.  Also, in Wolfenstein 3D's difficulty selection screen where BJ's head matched the difficutly level, me and my buddy thought the baby head looked like a robot so we always went with the cool robot thing."

InsideGaming,38qcrw,IGPhil,3,Sat Jun 6 12:21:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Machinima is not really involved.  IG is pretty much free to produce whatever content we see fit.  And you're right, Matt, Hundar, Ali, and Lyle are going to pretty much be the team.  With me in there every once in a while."

InsideGaming,38mr5r,Jeff_Dwyer,5,Fri Jun 5 06:18:47 2015 UTC,I just finished watching today's IGD and was heading over here to say something about keeping Ali as a permanent host. So it's pretty funny to see this thread. But agreed! I think the two of them make a dope ass team. Keep up the good work ya'll!
InsideGaming,38mr5r,DefenderCone97,3,Fri Jun 5 19:11:13 2015 UTC,I've liked her since she was at RT. Really has a charm. Maybe the pink hair
InsideGaming,38mr5r,swagenshit,-5,Fri Jun 5 16:36:26 2015 UTC,lel thats why me and my homies don't like her.
InsideGaming,38mr5r,swagenshit,3,Fri Jun 5 17:47:15 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty stupid reason not to like somebody, just saying"
InsideGaming,38mr5r,dmills819,-1,Fri Jun 5 20:59:36 2015 UTC,"Idk about you, but when people color their hair an unnatural color I almost always don't like it, I just think it looks weird. I feel the same way about the girl on The Know (can't think of her name atm), but almost every day her hair is a different color and it is weird. I mean I like the rotation of host a lot because it gives everyone a co-host that they like from time to time. If they give ali a full time co-host it would be unfair to the thousands of other fans who like another host more. If ali is your favorite that fine, but it would really be unfair to everyone else if she was on every day."
InsideGaming,38mr5r,Kidburman,4,Fri Jun 5 21:28:03 2015 UTC,"Im not asking for Ali to be the sole co-host of IG, I just would like to see her have a more permanent position as opposed to her just sometimes being in videos."
InsideGaming,38mr5r,swagenshit,5,Fri Jun 5 21:32:23 2015 UTC,"She is Freaking amazing, Ali would make the perfect co-host in my opinion, and it would diversify the history of inside gaming..."

InsideGaming,38mr5r,djmattyd,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:37:00 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, we don't have to choose one. I was just stating that I would like to see Ali become an official member of IG, I would also like to see that for Lyle."
InsideGaming,38mr5r,swagenshit,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:53:29 2015 UTC,"I just want to point out that this thread should not decide who is the co host of ig. Think about it, over 100,000 people watch the show most days, and it would be unfair to the thousands of fans who just missed this thread to pick ali for co host. If machinima picks the ali for a full time co host, to me that shows that the company need some people on a reddit thread to make its decisions."
InsideGaming,38mr5r,swagenshit,2,Fri Jun 5 17:52:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, it would be strange for machinima to take what well under 50 people are saying as gospel. It wouldn't make sense for them as a company to disregard what tens if not hundreds of thousands of daily viewers think."

InsideGaming,37nqiu,Azure_Jet,4,Fri May 29 00:12:34 2015 UTC,I don't think it's a good idea to invoke a Phil's pick before showing the trailers. Also the description ran for a bit too long.
InsideGaming,37nt9k,ClovieKay,5,Fri May 29 00:24:34 2015 UTC,Should turn this in to a straw poll instead of whatever this thread would end up looking like.

InsideGaming,37itmq,maggosh,3,Wed May 27 23:06:38 2015 UTC,My only complaint is that Gears is only remastering one game at a time instead of doing what halo did and giving us a Marcus Fenix collection
InsideGaming,37itmq,Dirt_Cobain,2,Thu May 28 04:59:28 2015 UTC,mine would be that gears is boring....oh snap... boring single player..if you have played it already
InsideGaming,37itmq,djmattyd,1 point,Thu May 28 05:26:05 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty decent campaign the first is the best, but any single player campaign can only be played so much before its boring. But I'm giving them my money for feelings of nostalgia and multiplayer"
InsideGaming,37itmq,Dirt_Cobain,1 point,Thu May 28 16:33:58 2015 UTC,"True, but for a lot of people Gears 1 was the first game they played on 360, so it holds a SPECIAL PLACE IN THEIR HEART MATT."

InsideGaming,37itmq,Azure_Jet,3,Thu May 28 18:35:39 2015 UTC,"Yes! I think that if it is from last generation then it's definitely too early for a remake/remaster. Pre-HD era stuff makes more sense, but still in general I'd rather see new IPs. Nostalgia is great but I didn't start playing games to continue to play the exact same games over and over again."
InsideGaming,37itmq,Azure_Jet,2,Thu May 28 00:53:45 2015 UTC,multiplayer stuff I can sort of understand but IMO the borderlands stuff is a pretty ridiculous cash grab
InsideGaming,37itmq,djmattyd,2,Thu May 28 05:26:44 2015 UTC,"I really like HD remakes for older games that you can't buy any more.  The most recent purchase for me was Grim Fandango. I only got to play that on a demo disk a long long time ago. Was also very pleased with the Monkey Island (1, 2) remakes too a few years ago. And when God of War 3 was coming out, they re-released the first two so I could experience the whole story."
InsideGaming,37itmq,romeozor,1 point,Thu May 28 16:31:30 2015 UTC,I agree. Personally I'm waiting for .hack to be re-released or remastered since I sold my copies like an idiot.
InsideGaming,37itmq,Azure_Jet,1 point,Thu May 28 16:37:57 2015 UTC,Which ones? Honestly I liked both major American releases.

InsideGaming,37itmq,WombRaid3r,1 point,Thu May 28 18:45:40 2015 UTC,"l just want to see a remake of Spyro the Dragon and Croc 2. Also Midnight Club but I'm pretty sure I'm the only one thinking that. Nostalgia called, they want their childhood back."
InsideGaming,37is0a,ojb99,2,Wed May 27 22:55:51 2015 UTC,"I REALLY hope so. But as it stands they're still building up a staff to just put out videos (I mean Matt puts out, but not in the volume we demand lol). I imagine once they get a good staff and are able to get gameplays out routinely, plus at least come close to getting out of the red, that podcasts will probably be back in some form."
InsideGaming,37is0a,Azure_Jet,1 point,Thu May 28 00:51:49 2015 UTC,"Assuming this means you want it to come back, I agree! Would help us get more attuned to Matt's personality and maybe he could even bring on some gaming YouTubers?  and I guess Ali. If he HAS to. ;)"

InsideGaming,36tn6i,djmattyd,2,Fri May 22 17:12:26 2015 UTC,yeah hopefully this will get better as they learn to optimize better for the consoles. Also who knows we may see the return of modular upgrades to consoles to keep them current

I'm actually using this mac as more than just a Facebook machine and enjoying it. I have no money so I'm renting it as my course requires it. Sorry about that?   Its never a good thing if the 12 years olds in the YouTube comments line up with your opinion but in real life no one gives a shit.
InsideGaming,36fpvk,aerospacenut,2,Tue May 19 03:07:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I have both as my university required I get a Mac (basically), and I already had my gaming rig. I use both for what I intended and feel like both have earned their place. My Windows PC can play anything I throw at it, no contest between the Mac and it.  That said, my Mac cannot be beaten when it comes to music production. I haven't found any Windows program that compares to Logic. I've heard all the ""Oh you just have to use program X, and find obscure setting Y and it'll work better on Windows"" and that is garbage. Mac is just plug and play AND the depth of settings is unmatched by virtually anything Windows has to offer.  Each has its place, and I honestly don't get the hate by either group.

As a matter of fact, TUGS was accomplished inasmuch as it brought in some news whilst being moreover a bunch of guys simply goofing around. That's what made Inside Gaming unique - they took games journalism to a level as low as possible whilst mostly just goofing around, which is what the show seems to be turning from now. In reality, however, the prime demographic viewership of the show will continue to consist of immature teens, and that seems to have been what they enjoyed. Therefore, I believe from simply watching TUGS and ETC, where Elliot too does shine in his own sort of humor (however, he would never host IG), that the cast of ETC (and Hundar for that matter) would fare VERY well in IG."

The part we're used to is the rebel developer that gives us controversial masterpiece games like GTA or Red Dead Redemption, and they seem cool with everything. But on the other hand next week we get the shaft from the legal dept. (rightly trying to protect their own interests) and seemingly out of touch with the fanbase that has given them such success.  I just hope they get it sorted out. A way to limit mods to just single player, or maybe even a better microtransaction system."

How braindead can they be to not know that the people they are looking for have a new channel, and they are the same awesome guys as before. You don't like Matt and the old&new Insidegaming crew? Fuck off then, don't watch. It's that simple.  Don't worry Matt, the dust will settle and thing will start to get better and better."
InsideGaming,34j36s,taoofthemachine,3,Fri May 1 17:01:32 2015 UTC,I'm still don't understand why the daily never gets the hate but when they upload anything else the hate train starts going.
InsideGaming,34j36s,taintedviper,5,Fri May 1 17:14:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I can only guess too, of course, but maybe because the daily is interesting and has ""content"".   Maybe it isn't the best word, but I don't know what else to call it.  See, look at what they uploaded on IG so far : An announcement, a nostalgia thing no one aside from older fans gets and two Q&As.  As I and a lot of other ""fans"", are newer, we don't know these guys. So I don't get the battlefront thing and it was, honestly, a bit alienating to me.   The first Q&A, I got, because I was interested in what direction the channel would go.  This second one however... as I said, I don't know these guys, I've not yet formed any sort of connection, like the one older fans have because they know them, why would I be interested in knowing who'd they'd like to be for a day ?  It feels a bit like a tell don't show sort of thing.   I'd much rather see who they are and what they're like through a fun game play first instead of them jumping in and trying to tell me already what they like and don't like.  I get that there's always you older fans and that it's nice of them to aknowledge you and make content you are interested in, too.  I find it all a bit ill timed, is all.  That being said, I still think they seem like nice dudes and I'll be giving them a chance for sure."

InsideGaming,34c7uj,djmattyd,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:21:02 2015 UTC,I agree with you.
InsideGaming,34c7uj,internet_man_415,2,Thu Apr 30 13:44:30 2015 UTC,"Sticking with the shifty titles. Cool. I mean, it got an adult fucking rating so of course kids can't play what's the point."
InsideGaming,34c7uj,internet_man_415,2,Thu Apr 30 13:45:29 2015 UTC,HUNDAR HUNDAR HUNDAR
InsideGaming,34c7uj,Montezum,2,Thu Apr 30 13:57:14 2015 UTC,lol Kootra @ 0:45 next to that ghost costume
InsideGaming,34c7uj,c00n13z,4,Thu Apr 30 18:54:12 2015 UTC,"Good to see it got an Adult rating at least. This game is probably just shock value garbage, not worth a strong opinion either way until it offers more than just shock value."
InsideGaming,34c7uj,Azure_Jet,5,Thu Apr 30 00:17:06 2015 UTC,Or it might just be the most fun top down shooter in a long time. Ya never know but honestly an M rating was all this needed from what I've seen.
InsideGaming,34c7uj,tigrn914,2,Thu Apr 30 00:30:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Wouldn't that be the surprise if it actually was? XD I was just saying that the way they've structured the marketing so far makes it SEEM like it's all for shock value. If it's not the case then I'll be happy to give it another look.   I remember when GTA III came out and it caused a similar controversy since it ""romanticized violence, gangs, drugs"" and had the potential to just be another one of those shock value games. Didn't really turn out that way in the long run though, and I'm super glad about that one."
InsideGaming,34c7uj,Azure_Jet,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:03:01 2015 UTC,"i love how you just shit all over the game, when you've had no hands on experience with it and assume it's just a ""grim-dark"" edgy edge fest. just because this isn't something you prefer doesn't necessarily mean you need to belittle it as much as possible. You did the same thing with the Mad Max game. watching you come back into IG i thought ""he'll probably do it justice, he's one of the original guys."" nup. you give YOUR side and opinion. not just putting out the info and letting people decide for themselves. You've lost me. I'll send you some screenshots when the game comes out."
InsideGaming,34c7uj,Soadrok,2,Thu Apr 30 10:34:41 2015 UTC,Im sorry Ive lost you but this show isnt going to be a non opinionated info dump. You can get straight facts about the game anywhere. What have you seen from the gameplay that makes you think its going to be good? I have a video coming out where I go over in a little more detail about what I think of Hatred.
InsideGaming,34c7uj,djmattyd,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"I've been following the game from its beginning. Top-down twin stick shooters aren't for everyone, my reason for thinking its going to be good? It's going to be a game where I can turn off, and ""go a little mad"". It's a stress buster kind of game, filled with executions, they aren't trying to make like ""oh this game is gonna revolutionise the industry"", they're just making something that they wanted to make, they went this extreme with its context as a ""fuck you censors, games don't have to always be politically correct. People can play what they want to play"". I will most likely give your upcoming video a watch. Hopefully you give it somewhat of a chance. If its not your thing, fine. But try not to shit on it for everyone else. That magic game you're looking forward too isn't my thing, but I'm not gonna go shit on it just because I have no interest in it whatsoever."
InsideGaming,34c7uj,Soadrok,1 point,Fri May 1 01:59:26 2015 UTC,"In terms of making a game to challenge norms of what is acceptable the way they are doing it is not very original (Postal, State of Emergency before it was changed) and frankly the premise is just lazy writing. Really the whole ""hey were going to try to  push the envelope of what is acceptable"" just seems like a cop out especially when the writing that they have shown has been so lazy.  As for mtg I dont mind if people shit on it. However I will point out from a game mechanics perspective it is a genre defining game and so probably not the best comparison.  That being said I am for sure going to be playing hatred mostly because people are curious. I am going to try to go in with an open mind, but I am still pretty skeptical."
InsideGaming,34c7uj,djmattyd,2,Fri May 1 18:10:40 2015 UTC,All fair points. I guess we'll all just have to wait until its released to see if they've done a good job or not.
InsideGaming,34c7uj,Soadrok,1 point,Fri May 1 22:52:11 2015 UTC,"It's just Hundar doing his thing, he likes to melt faces. However, I'm liking Matt less and less. So far he's been the actual co-host, echoing or playing along with whatever the person next to him says or does. Even Spool had more character while on camera."
InsideGaming,34c7uj,romeozor,3,Thu Apr 30 11:41:32 2015 UTC,I dont echo anything seeing how as I am the one who writes the episodes.
InsideGaming,34c7uj,djmattyd,0,Thu Apr 30 16:25:49 2015 UTC,"hundar i'm okay with.. to a degree. but yeah. i thought matt was gonna do it justice. i tried to give IG the benefit of the doubt but shitting on mad max pushed it. even though as an aussie i'm skeptical whether or not they're gonna fuck up the Max accent or not, but that's the same for Fury Road. He bitched about it being a shitty movie tie-in. It's NOT a movie tie in. it's a game based off of the franchise. Then he pulls this shit out of his ass. i'm done with IG, i'll stick around for ETC but that's about it."
InsideGaming,34c7uj,Soadrok,2,Thu Apr 30 11:56:25 2015 UTC,"FWIW I said I am skeptical about the game and said the last trailer made me more hopeful. As for ""pulling stuff out of my ass"", Ive been covering games for about a decade now so I'd like to think I draw from my experience and not my ass."
InsideGaming,34c7uj,djmattyd,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:28:00 2015 UTC,"From your videos, I CAN tell that you've had a lot of experience in the industry, I think most people can see that."
InsideGaming,347xq1,insidegamingbot,9,Wed Apr 29 00:37:16 2015 UTC,"Good, I'm glad it was scrapped. I liked the idea but hated the execution especially the measly 25% modders got from revenue. Chances are, this will come back in some form, let's just hope it's nowhere near as bad as this was."

InsideGaming,347xq1,Swinns,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:03:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly! If Valve were to keep it relatively cheap and available to everyone, while allowing the creators to profit, I think that'd be a decent enough idea."
InsideGaming,347xq1,Jeff_Dwyer,2,Wed Apr 29 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"i know ill be getting a lot of hate on the internet but i don't care it just has to be said. I'm on the same level with Colin Cowherd i don't see Competitive gaming as a legit Sport that should be broadcasted on ESPN or any other traditional Sports Network. Now before you all start writing me negative comments and sending me to karma hell, i too am a big time gamer, i'm also a big time sports fan (Go 49ers, Go Lakers, Go Angels). I've played in both Traditional Sports and Gaming tournaments in my life, from baseball soccer football and basketball, to LoL tournaments, Smash Bros tournaments, hell even Pokemon tournaments. but i just don't see competitive video gaming as a ""Sport"" that should be covered on ESPN. Bottom line I think ESports isn't a real thing, and should not be covered on ESPN, maybe  eventually Competitive Gaming will get it's own network"
InsideGaming,347xq1,FoolishSilvas,5,Wed Apr 29 02:36:22 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree. I understand why people don't consider E-sports a sport and shouldn't be on ESPN and I do agree that there should be a network specifically for that. However, I also think that the network that broadcasted a competitive spelling bee, billiards, and poker is frankly silly that gaming is too ridiculous to be shown."
InsideGaming,347xq1,Dark5tar1,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:01:06 2015 UTC,"Thats another thing too.. Stuff like this is for spike tv or oprah's network.. But ESPN.. Nahh.. Hopefully the ""E-Sport"" crowd can get their own network soon"
InsideGaming,347xq1,FoolishSilvas,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:26:04 2015 UTC,"I don't see why we need a network though. All gaming tournaments I've ever seen are live streamed for free via the internet. Why create a network which will no doubt cost in subscription fees, (cable, satellite etc.) when it's readily available to everyone now for free?"
InsideGaming,347xq1,vakda,4,Wed Apr 29 09:42:40 2015 UTC,"While i dont necesarily agree with your opinion, I dont think you should be getting these downvotes for expressing it."
InsideGaming,347xq1,djmattyd,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:56:41 2015 UTC,"For one I agree with you. In modern America (and even other parts of the world) EVERYTHING is a sport or has to be seen as a sport. ESPN even broadcasts the spelling bee as a sport. I agree with your reasons as well. Not all things that are competitive by nature are sports.  I love my games, and I love playing tournaments, but I just don't see it as a sport. I also don't look down on those who do, it's just my opinion. Glad to see I'm not completely alone."
InsideGaming,347xq1,Azure_Jet,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:41:31 2015 UTC,As I said earlier (not sure if it was here or twitter): I wasn't worried in the slightest. Valve has a great track record with gamers and usually tries to fix things like this ASAP. We value their service and don't think that they take that for granted. They know they are the darling of digital downloads and will fight to keep it that way.

InsideGaming,343i51,Dark5tar1,2,Tue Apr 28 14:32:30 2015 UTC,I will definitely take a game like Titanfall with more depth. Plus we have the already huge player base of CoD? Damn if they nail this launch then RIP Titanfall.

InsideGaming,343i51,Dark5tar1,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:22:23 2015 UTC,It was more aimed at the whole series. Titamfall died within the first few months.

I don't know what it is but it feels like it's just being read from a teleprompter, with not much personality behind it. And in such a competing industry thats what makes truly great shows, obviously.   But I'll put that down to finding the feet this new IG has to find. I hope it doesn't  try and be what it was. It needs to be new and fresh. I'm sure we could cope of there wasn't a daily for the sake of finding the foundations to base this new look IG on.   I like Matt. And I want to love IG. So i'll definitely be watching everything put out. But I felt like voicing my opinions, as I haven't as of the 'reboot' if you will. That and the whiskey (on a Sunday I know crazy life).

InsideGaming,33f7z8,insidegamingbot,11,Wed Apr 22 01:06:07 2015 UTC,"The whole ""not authentic to Star Wars"" thing in relation to destructible terrain is bizarre. Star Wars was one of the first sci-fi properties to really embrace the dirty, lived-in future aesthetic, where buildings are in disrepair and technology is held together with duct tape (eg the Millennium Falcon). I would have thought that destructible buildings and terrain would enhance that feeling and really set it apart from, say, a Trek game or other properties like Halo or COD:AW."

That being said though, I do think you need to find some other people to host with you pretty fast, guests are fine, but the dynamic just doesn't feel as comfortable as it would be if you had a regular team."

InsideGaming,33f7z8,swagandtag,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:09:05 2015 UTC,Taking out the bots games where you can set the parameters is such a bad idea. That was such a large part of not only Battlefront but Battlefield also. Just because these companies want to innovate and add new features doesn't mean they need to take out the old fun ones. I'm bummed.
InsideGaming,33f7z8,MrTTom,1 point,Thu Apr 23 07:26:07 2015 UTC,I think you need a co-host who can bounce off you a lot more than Shibby did on this episode but that's not a dig at him though

InsideGaming,33eqea,kel89,4,Wed Apr 22 10:01:01 2015 UTC,"But isn't that the beauty of it? That Bruce and Adam combo became so great that no one remembers anyone before that. I never really watched Inside Gaming Daily because of ""omg i really wantz teh gaming newz,"" I came back every couple of days because the two hosts were really entertaining without being cringy and it was mixed in with video games.  EDIT - And for an example on this, we can compare it to Top Gear.  Everyone knows Top Gear as Clarkson, Hammond and May. If the BBC brings back Top Gear, after firing all 3, with Jason Dawe.. there is no way that Jason Dawe deserves the same respect as the other 3 just because he was there since Day 1."

InsideGaming,33eqea,123noodle,6,Wed Apr 22 07:25:00 2015 UTC,Honestly I think the best idea is for IG to just make interesting new videos and not keep addressing it in big ways. Take a look at the brouhaha that happened when the Funhaus guys first joined Roosterteeth. Both fanbases complained about each other. But it just took a few weeks to settle down. And same here - when Matt etc find their groove the community will too.

InsideGaming,33g097,OfficialGarwood,9,Wed Apr 22 05:27:18 2015 UTC,I unno Black Hole perhaps?
InsideGaming,33g097,djmattyd,6,Wed Apr 22 06:54:17 2015 UTC,"It was previously mentioned that Matt has a rotating cast of support people until the new team is put together and finalized. So we'll probably see a lot of people on IGD and during the streams that won't necessarily be the ""final"" IG team for a while."
InsideGaming,33g097,Azure_Jet,8,Wed Apr 22 13:22:56 2015 UTC,this is accurate information
InsideGaming,33g09m,UnluckyRaven,2,Wed Apr 22 05:27:32 2015 UTC,I'm glad this was made. Makes me smile. :)
InsideGaming,33g09m,Azure_Jet,2,Wed Apr 22 13:23:54 2015 UTC,i miss the IG DAILY soo im looking for more awesome moments to recreate them :D

InsideGaming,33b1px,Azure_Jet,8,Tue Apr 21 01:59:48 2015 UTC,A totally new editor..still working on how he tackles these
InsideGaming,33b1px,djmattyd,8,Tue Apr 21 02:03:36 2015 UTC,"With the old editors gone, will the ""Phil's seal of approval"" still play on Phil's picks?"

InsideGaming,33b1px,djmattyd,8,Tue Apr 21 04:18:15 2015 UTC,I'm glad they are doing gaming news because it seems Funhaus isn't.
InsideGaming,33b1px,swagandtag,12,Tue Apr 21 04:31:40 2015 UTC,They have a segment in The Know. Not really the same.
InsideGaming,33b1px,Drdres,5,Tue Apr 21 04:41:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really don't like how The Know handles videos. I really only need one a day, and one giant one a week is too long. That being said, I think IGD and FH have the best structures for their personalities.   I guess this is also a good time to ask: can you still sub just the IGD show without subbing Machinima? I like to keep my sub box tidy."
InsideGaming,33b1px,Ceedog48,2,Tue Apr 21 07:54:20 2015 UTC,You could just check the subreddit everyday. You know it'll get posted here.
InsideGaming,33b1px,roxastheman,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:25:38 2015 UTC,Haven't the IGD videos always been on the main Machinima channel?
InsideGaming,33b1px,hoolio-p,1 point,Tue Apr 21 12:49:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, but they were a ""show"" you could subscribe to, on its own, for a while. That is, they'd be hosted on the same channel, but your inbox wouldn't be flooded with the other Machinima stuff. This is back when montages were still being posted on the main channel, though...  From what I can tell, they stopped the ""show"" system for IGD, and it may actually have been discontinued from YouTube as a whole."
InsideGaming,33b1px,Ceedog48,7,Tue Apr 21 12:52:23 2015 UTC,"Steve is kind of a dilf (I'm sorry).  Edit: Well, that's a big change, the older show never ever talked about MOBAs so I think this is a good start."

InsideGaming,33b1px,maggosh,14,Tue Apr 21 02:38:50 2015 UTC,"What actually happened:    You posts video IG bot posts the video Matt sees the duplicate, deletes IG bots video. At the same time, you delete your video, thinking yours is the duplicate. Matt messages me asking about the bot for future posts, I tell him I'll repost the video for today.

InsideGaming,33b1px,Aroused-dentist,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:19:08 2015 UTC,Good first episode. As much as I love Steve and Larson they belong as a duo. Matt seemed to be the third wheel of the bromance.
InsideGaming,33b1px,ForgottenSock,1 point,Tue Apr 21 09:34:05 2015 UTC,I'm surprised at how positive things were in terms of peoples reactions. A lot of the comments are positive and constructive.

InsideGaming,3372md,dryarmor,14,Mon Apr 20 03:57:55 2015 UTC,I hope you never lose faith Matt! Those of us here in the beginning have been calling for your return for many years... I don't think its possible to disappoint us
InsideGaming,3372md,rRue,2,Mon Apr 20 05:51:32 2015 UTC,Amen to that. There was nothing wrong with watching Matt D exclusive Inside Gaming episodes in the past! This will be awesome!
InsideGaming,3372md,Arkivek,7,Mon Apr 20 20:05:21 2015 UTC,Loved the Battlehoug skid dude. Thanks so much for coming back and getting the show going again. You were a real performer then and I bet you're just as good if not better now.

Dont give up just because people dont understand the way you are, just keep doing what you do the best :D !"
InsideGaming,3372md,FloodedDistrict,2,Mon Apr 20 21:04:36 2015 UTC,I look forward to the new videos. Good luck!
InsideGaming,3372md,adamkovicsnipple,2,Mon Apr 20 05:27:24 2015 UTC,I think your persona and timing is what makes you so entertaining. You're hilarious so don't drown yourself with over the top MS Paint SFX skits and what not. You and Adam would kill it on the daily just with your script. Pretty stoked you're back in the IG game.
InsideGaming,3372md,samwise_the_grey,2,Mon Apr 20 13:32:04 2015 UTC,"I really liked the Battlehoug video. I didn't see the point of continuing to follow IG if it still doing the same content. Not saying that a Daily wouldn't be welcome, but being different is everything IG is about.  Good Luck, Matt!"
InsideGaming,3372md,RzPGO,2,Mon Apr 20 18:18:02 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed both the announcement and the style in which it was done. I can understand how it bothers some though, that may not be used to that type of thing on the IG main channel.   I feel bad though that the blowback from comments and likes/dislikes in that video would influence anything done in the future. They're (comments) obviously going to be close to the height of rejection of any new format near the beginning so it really sucks that we might not get more stuff like this simply because of the poor comments/likes near the onset."
InsideGaming,3372md,Azure_Jet,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:44:32 2015 UTC,"It's strange. I understand people's feelings like ""why am I gonna fall in love with these people again if machinima kills everyone that I love?"" but then you think and A LOT of great stuff came from Machinima, even if they are not there anymore.  I just hope you find the right tone, Matt, and good luck!"
InsideGaming,3372md,Montezum,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:19:12 2015 UTC,Don't listen to people flaming you Matt. They just weren't around when the greatness that was Adam Kovic and Matt Dannevik hosting IGD was still a thing. I'm so glad that you're back!
InsideGaming,333m0b,FloodedDistrict,11,Sun Apr 19 05:00:24 2015 UTC,"I think Matt needs a team. Part of the reason the Funhaus crew gained so many subscribers is because James and Bruce became regulars on commenting. Matt is a lonely soldier, and I think if he just is himself and surrounds himself with good people his audience will adjust. And he's not doing a very good job with click bait for dumb comedy. The inside gaming channel finds more success in just gameplay commentary than anything else and being upfront with its audience. Look at the first couple videos of Funhaus. It's practically nothing but quick clips of them doing nothing but moving into their new environment. And constantly apologizing that they are moving fast enough. I'm not saying Matt needs to copy what they are doing, but he needs to be very real with his audience like he was in the ama. In fact, that might not be a bad thing to put on the IG channel to really make sure everyone warms up to him."
InsideGaming,333m0b,KissoffKid,2,Sun Apr 19 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, back in 2012 when Adam and Matt where the hosts of IG, there was a point where there where so many poeple working for IG, that Machinima started to dismiss half of the old team (because Machinima wasnt earning nothing) SO. POSSIBLY, Machinima could hire them back..."
InsideGaming,333m0b,KissoffKid,2,Sun Apr 19 15:05:12 2015 UTC,I don't think that Adam is coming back...
InsideGaming,333m0b,KissoffKid,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:33:46 2015 UTC,"I was talking about all the people who got fired in the process, like John A. or Phil. Its more that obvious that Adam will stay at Funhaus, also...where did you get the idea of Adam coming back ._. ?"

InsideGaming,333m0b,omegacluster,4,Sat Apr 25 04:30:48 2015 UTC,"The community also just needs time. IG Is going to be touch and go for a little bit while Matt gets into the groove of things and finds a way to do what he wants that calls back to his IG, but doesnt alienate newer fans. Give them a month to figure it out and the strong community we know will come back."
InsideGaming,333m0b,Aroused-dentist,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:58:56 2015 UTC,"The only reason people will comeback is if Funhaus doesn't create a show similar to the old Inside Gaming Daily.  The new videos are cool and I'm glad they are back, but I still want the Adam+Bruce IG Daily type of videos."
InsideGaming,333m0b,Riffol,2,Wed Apr 22 16:36:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a quite long time fan of IG, but I never saw Matt before, so I'm quite new too.

InsideGaming,333m0b,seveenti9,2,Sun Apr 19 15:59:05 2015 UTC,It's going to be a long time from when people who don't want to see the new IG decide to stop commenting on every video. These people just hate change. I'm certain that once things settle down IG is going to do well and will have a dedicated fanbase. It will just take some time.

InsideGaming,32zame,nonplayer,17,Fri Apr 17 23:52:16 2015 UTC,"I saw the podcast on ETC with him, that was great and he seems like an awesome guy. I sincerely wish he'll do well on the new IG.    But that battlefront video was just bad. Not ""omg kill yourself"" bad, but bad.    As a viewer, it doesnt take too much to ""entertain"" me... basically I just wanna come back from work, go to youtube and see what games are being released this month, or if my pc can run the new gta, or stuff like that. I honestly miss that from IG. But now its like everyone is trying to be funny... like being ""lolsorandom"" is the only accepted language to be used in entertainment news these days. This isnt directed at Matt specifically, but to most people talking about gaming on yt.    Having said that, its just one video. Moving on."
InsideGaming,32zame,apav,8,Sat Apr 18 04:39:54 2015 UTC,"I'll admit, it was a bad first video for the new channel, but if you are an older Inside Gaming viewer (back to when it was Adam and Matt co-hosting), you would have realized his jokes were from a previous video. I guess Matt seriously underestimated the amount of new viewers the old crew brought in, or how many people would get the joke. But to his defense, a lot of the time the old IG crew liked to re-use their jokes, and that's one of the reasons why they are so funny. Matt knows that and is doing the exact same thing here, and he gets shit on because 1.) people don't like change 2.) people don't understand this is a running joke from serveral years ago 3.) the amount of people that still don't know about Funhaus and think the old crew is gone forever is just astounding. With his first real content video he should've tried something else to bridge the gap, help people understand his personality and humor and that this is going to be something new and different, while taking some ideas from the old IG crew and implementing them so it doesn't feel so foreign."
InsideGaming,32zame,Rinychib,12,Sun Apr 19 20:43:13 2015 UTC,I wish them luck! I started watching IG when they were still in that room with the big wooden beam so I never got to see Matt. Excited to see what they do
InsideGaming,32zame,regeneratex,6,Sat Apr 18 03:04:45 2015 UTC,Good ol' Pillar!
InsideGaming,32zame,MReyesG,8,Sat Apr 18 04:05:27 2015 UTC,Anyone bitching about the old IG can go watch Funhaus. I personally watch and enjoy both.
InsideGaming,32zame,ByTheBeardOfBruce,4,Mon Apr 20 02:54:01 2015 UTC,Loved that battlefront video
InsideGaming,32zame,IIAPandaII,2,Sun Apr 19 00:47:17 2015 UTC,"In all honesty if Matt was to try and mimic their style of videos then I think the show would suffer but I watched it when we co hosted IG with Adam a few years ago and always found the sketches (much like the Battlefront video he uploaded) that he'd do before the videos hilarious and I look forward to more of that. He's certainly got his own style, lot of viewers will get used to it but if you're wanting to watch the old IG guys then go to Funhaus. They have their formula stuck to it and have re marketed it there. IG will change with Matt and I don't think he'll let it go down hill but it will be different to how it was before."
InsideGaming,32zame,DickPepperfield,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"Guys... Let the guy post a video first. He's been a ""guest"" on these other videos, which mean they haven't been part of his ""vision."" Let's start the non sensical hating once he starts uploading, shall we?"

InsideGaming,32yfgz,Kincan,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:15:03 2015 UTC,"I think that's a bit of an excuse really. If it was good quality humour, then there wouldn't be over 50% of people disliking the video.

InsideGaming,32yfgz,SaintJason,3,Fri Apr 17 19:36:33 2015 UTC,I thought it was just Adam who created IG. He said he wanted Inside Halo to be a gaming show because there wasn't much Halo news and then Inside Gaming was born.
InsideGaming,32yfgz,ZachGuy00,3,Sun Apr 19 00:26:06 2015 UTC,"I was really surprised by the downvotes, don't know why he got so many"
InsideGaming,32yfgz,Riffol,-12,Fri Apr 17 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the downvotes are because this video was terrible, offensive and downright a shit ""first"" impression of the new IG."

InsideGaming,32yfgz,IGPhil,8,Fri Apr 17 20:04:16 2015 UTC,I liked it but like /u/SecretaryOf  said maybe just needed to get people warmed up to Matt first before posting a video skit like this. Edit: detail

InsideGaming,32yfgz,SaintJason,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:07:31 2015 UTC,"Well technically it is old IG, and I thought it was a great call back to the original content Matt and Adam made. Now from a welcome to the new channel stand point sure it could have been some generic news cast we have seen 100 times but even then people would hate it simple because is not Adam, Bruce and James."

InsideGaming,32yzpe,stratofarius,3,Sat Apr 18 01:55:50 2015 UTC,"Matt, I still remember how you and Adam were integral to introducing me to the wide world of games. I will never forget how my eyes were glued to my shitty iPod Touch, consuming the latest IGDaily on the wait for school. Which is why I need to ask: do you think that it is possible to talk games and entertain a rather young audience without being forced to double down on Youtube personality cliches like, say, what you see with PewDiePie and so forth?"
InsideGaming,32yzpe,PcMasturRaceHurrDurr,3,Sat Apr 18 12:05:59 2015 UTC,Will Funhaus be guests or whatever in the future.
InsideGaming,32yzpe,Arkivek,3,Sat Apr 18 04:16:09 2015 UTC,"So this might be too late, as stated on the first IGD. Great episode by the way.  The answer is simple. Inside gaming has always been the personalities within it. We've seen countless people come and go, but that didn't necessarily diminish the quality. I even consider you, Phil, quite ""new"" as a persona in the IG era. Although you've been behind the camera for a long time.  What I'm trying to say, is that I don't think you have to worry to much. With Matt at the helm (seriously, no pressure! It's fine!) it should let the rest of the crew define themselves and help us, as a community get to know you.  What shook the ground so hard when Adam and co left, was that it was so many at once. So you have to give yourself time to set up shop and start making videos."

InsideGaming,32yzpe,adireflex,2,Sat Apr 18 21:36:04 2015 UTC,Q1: Do yo find returning to an established IG more challenging than when you and Adam were at the beginning with IG and with a smaller number of fans?  Q2: Will you continue placing the IG fanart on the wall where you host the show?  Q3: Will Steve and Larson and or the ETC crew have a larger part in IG (be part of future skits or other planned stuff) or just as guest hosts?   Q4: Will you someday host the show with dreadlocks? (dunno why i asked that)
InsideGaming,32yzpe,PixelPolish,2,Sun Apr 19 07:49:10 2015 UTC,"Q1: I'm curious about the schedule and programming of the new IG. What sort of videos and how often we can expect? Q2: How do you feel about being ""re-hired"" after you've been laid-off by Machinima while you were still a KEY member of IG? Q3: How do you plan to fulfill the (quite astronomical) fan expectations now that the IG legacy rests on your shoulders? Many smart-ass newbies don't even know you and they already judge you based on two short clips. What's your approach to the whole situation?  Not a question, but stay strong Matty, you know that the old guard loves you. Don't feel pressured, just go with the flow ;)"

InsideGaming,32yi92,mirazsyed,9,Fri Apr 17 19:41:45 2015 UTC,"It's the internet. The reaction to something changing is always the default hate attack. Honestly if Adam and the others did something similar (like the ghost episode) on IG it wouldn't have as many dislikes. Sooner or later the ""hate train"" will stop and they'll start watching and enjoy the videos provided by our new king of IGlandia.  ps: can't wait for new stuff from the new/old IG team :)"
InsideGaming,32yi92,adireflex,3,Fri Apr 17 19:52:52 2015 UTC,Funhaus even had a little backlash when they moved. People hated on their channel simply because it wasn't named IG. Comments like that will pass. I just hope all the negativity doesn't make Matt and Phil feel unwelcome or anything like that. The vocal minority doesn't speak for the masses of happy people.
InsideGaming,32yi92,Azure_Jet,2,Sat Apr 18 02:44:36 2015 UTC,"It was a double whammy - the old IG fans hating on Roosterteeth/The Know, and Roosterteeth fans hating on the way Funhaus was doing things. It's evening out though.  I mean I wasn't a big fan of this first IG video, but I'd much rather they play around with a whole bunch of different ideas (some of which may not work) than just settle into the same shit everyone else is doing."
InsideGaming,32yi92,Pete_Venkman,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:56:23 2015 UTC,"For sure! I'm perfectly fine sitting through what I think is a bad video once in a while because I know both Funhaus and IG will put out many more good ones than bad. Plus I love(d) all the stuff Adam and Matt did together. Adam continued to do great with IG, so I see no reason at all why Matt wouldn't as well."
InsideGaming,32yi92,Azure_Jet,2,Sun Apr 19 03:35:41 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Matt hasn't been relevant to Inside Gaming for a while now (whilst I totally respect everything he's done for it) and has to prove just like anyone else would that he can make the funny videos the fans have come to expect."
InsideGaming,32yi92,invertedpiano,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:28:24 2015 UTC,"Well over the next few weeks we are going to see a big shift, the young guys who joined with the Funhaus team are probably going to unsub and only the old guard/hardcore will stay and weather the storm."

The channel will probably loose a couple of subscribers in the beginning but all the old fans of IG knows that Matt will do a great job and put out great content with the good old IG feel to it.

InsideGaming,320opg,djmattyd,2,Fri Apr 10 13:03:16 2015 UTC,"THE ORIGINS OF BLOODY BABY:  Today, you bore witness to a rebirth of sorts, a second coming of Inside Gaming. And with all this coming going down, your eyes have been opened to the Truth of Bloody Baby.  http://i.imgur.com/LfP7gg6.jpg  Behold, Matthew bears with him a small doll, an i-doll, the semblance of which is none other than a baby with blood smeared across its face. Mysteriousnesses, you might think, many mysteriousnesses shrouding who the baby is, what the baby emblemizes. Let the light of Bloody Baby be therefore shed unto you.  I worked at Machinima many years ago and during my time there, I witnessed the birthing of Bloody Baby. On the way back from a local pizza place (that doesn't have pineapple because of ""authenticity"" and therefore is complete horseshit), a coworker of mine spotted eyes in a local bush. He leaned forward and out of the shrubbage pulled the Bearer of Eyes - a baby doll, caked in blood.   We hailed the Bloody Baby, marched up San Vincente Blvd holding him much in the same manner Simba was held up by Rafiki in that flashback in ""Lion King II: Simba's Pride"". But Bloody Baby was more than just a salvaged toy, he became one of us. Also, my coworker licked him. And he tasted like lavender apparently. That's weird.  Bloody Baby has had many phases. He wore a Native American medallion found in a ditch, a small flamingo floaty toy (""He'd drown in a pool of blood otherwise""), many hats and sunglasses. But Bloody Baby stood true and tall, Bloody Baby kept us safe.  One fateful day, our time at Machinima came to an end. Packing our bags, we were forced to abandon Bloody Baby in the skeletal remains of our old office. Alone, bewildered, lost, Bloody Baby camped out and waited for someone to come find him. To be his Bloody Patriarch.  May Matt Dannevik be his Patriarch. May Inside Gaming be his Eternal Womb. May someone else taste his skin to confirm that it really does in fact taste like lavender without really thinking about the fact that we found this stupid fucking doll on the street and that licking it probably gave everyone weird baby transmitted diseases.  LONG LIVE BLOODY BABY."

If people like longer videos they can watch the entire stream instead. I think it was Yogscast Sips that said the sweet spot of videos is about 10 minutes long, if its any longer than that people are less likely to finish watching it and lose attention or interest."
InsideGaming,2v779n,ElCreator,22,Sun Feb 8 17:37:31 2015 UTC,I have never heard of RT before their acquisition of IG.
InsideGaming,2v779n,omegacluster,7,Sun Feb 8 19:23:27 2015 UTC,Really? IG talked about them a few times every year....

InsideGaming,2v779n,omegacluster,0,Mon Feb 9 16:36:24 2015 UTC,You shouldn't be disappointed with the videos RT does.
InsideGaming,2v779n,TanFlo1997,12,Sun Feb 22 23:20:43 2015 UTC,Me and my girlfriend feel the exact same way.  I don't know why an RT let's play is only 20 minutes long now. I watched their dying light let's play the other day and they got through one mission spent the rest trying to make a jump. nothing against the RT guys I still find them funny for sure but their content has seemed to shorten over the past few months. and VS I can't even watch anymore
InsideGaming,2v779n,Peezer3,5,Sun Feb 8 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but I feel that regardless of the length of their videos, there's a significant decline in the quality of content. It just seems to me that the AH guys are struggling to entertain themselves sometimes, which makes for some forgetful videos."
InsideGaming,2v779n,domtransformer,2,Mon Feb 9 11:14:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Achievement Hunter formula is a bit stale and tired. I really like their Podcasts though. Mainly because Burnie has my exact mindset so whenever he's on I feel like I'm a part of it somehow."

InsideGaming,2v779n,moon_monster,7,Sun Feb 8 17:55:29 2015 UTC,"Stoked for you that you discovered their old channel!!!   Must say I have TRIED REALLY HARD to get into RT, but for me there is just something missing....currently browsing through their channel and (like you said) i do find their videos a little boring. I thought that was because perhaps I didn't know the RT crew but from what you are saying it sounds like they actually are boring!?  I've been watching the (now) Funhaus guys since it was just Adam and for me there is no other content creator that matches their awesomeness. They just always have me in fits of laughter from (as you said) the guys themselves to the editing.  Also if they truly integrate their daily news show into 'The Know' (aka the most soulless and boring game news show ever...even ign does a better daily!), I think I might go jump off a bridge.  Hope you enjoy their back catalogue, I still do!"

InsideGaming,2ux0z0,Dabugar,16,Thu Feb 5 22:47:23 2015 UTC,"Rooster Teeth is pretty good about this. Most of their content is available for free off of their YouTube channel or website and you don't need to join the site to watch it.  You may be worried about RT's sponsorship model. Sponsor (RT paying member) content is mostly just timed exclusivity for the more popular shows/streams and small extra videos. For example the RT podcast is streamed for sponsors only but the audio is available the next day and the video is available the next week.  I doubt any of Funhaus' content will be sponsor exclusive so you wont have to worry about any of that. Just subscribe to Funhaus on Youtube and you will get most of the same stuff you got at IG.   We will have to see what they do with ""The Know"" (RT's news YouTube channel), because supposedly the guys are gonna be doing stuff on there in addition to on Funhaus."
InsideGaming,2ux0z0,IDL3_Shooter,3,Thu Feb 5 22:46:11 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. I think they'll upload everything to their channel. Just keep an eye on the subreddit, and they'll point you in the right direction."

InsideGaming,2uumuh,Kage_Oni,18,Thu Feb 5 17:19:20 2015 UTC,Plot Twist: RT joins Inside Gaming.
InsideGaming,2uumuh,JoseGMendez,28,Thu Feb 5 20:13:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they've been checking this subreddit out to see what we know, and a lot of people that don't use reddit and only watch them on youtube have no fucking idea any of this is going on, so I'm sure they'll be surprised."
InsideGaming,2uumuh,dat_username_tho,27,Thu Feb 5 07:27:27 2015 UTC,Those that only watch them on YouTube will probably never know since they don't know how to find them.
InsideGaming,2uumuh,kulapik,5,Thu Feb 5 11:45:21 2015 UTC,"They'll probably be making an announcement there too, so RT viewers will be surprised at least."
InsideGaming,2uumuh,MoHiaz,5,Thu Feb 5 17:10:11 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about people who follow Inside Gaming, there's no way Machinima lets the guys upload a video on the IG channel."
InsideGaming,2uumuh,kulapik,4,Thu Feb 5 17:33:00 2015 UTC,That's why when we get the info we spam the recent IG and IGD videos with info and the ETC. Machinima can't really do anything about that and youtube comments are shit anyway so it's not like we'd be affecting the quality of the comment section.
InsideGaming,2uumuh,dat_username_tho,-5,Thu Feb 5 20:24:13 2015 UTC,So what are the RT premium tiers? I assume we are going to have to start paying to see these guys....

InsideGaming,2uumuh,kulapik,3,Thu Feb 5 18:54:09 2015 UTC,"RT has some (not much) sponsor-only stuff, but to become a sponsor on the site is only $15 for 6 months.  Everything else, which is probably 95% of it, is available free on the site and on youtube."
InsideGaming,2uumuh,komacki,3,Thu Feb 5 19:19:35 2015 UTC,"That is a pretty reasonable price, and for the record, I am willing to pay for their content."
InsideGaming,2uumuh,Say_GoodKnight_Kevin,2,Thu Feb 5 19:27:37 2015 UTC,Most of RT stuff is free though like 90-80%

InsideGaming,2uvkg2,OfficialGarwood,19,Thu Feb 5 15:22:58 2015 UTC,"First of all he posted a video with personal information of the guys in. Secondly saying a ""emergency call"" could be anything and should NEVER be misused simply to get information about people they dont even know."
InsideGaming,2uvkg2,Black_Nerd,16,Thu Feb 5 15:28:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also, it took the fun out of it. It's fun scanning through tweets and pictures and figuring it all out. That way it doesn't involve invading someone's personal privacy at their own workplace.   I thought the phone call was too far, especially since he made it out like it's an emergency. Adam could have thought it was about his family or wife etc. That's just not cool."

InsideGaming,2uvkg2,Shinzumano,-2,Thu Feb 5 16:33:23 2015 UTC,Its almost like they are asking to be stalked though. They are putting out dozens of images and clues for people to figure out what they are doing. How can they not expect someone to go too far with it and ACTUALLY find out where they are. People have done it with less. This could've been avoided if they just didnt hype anything up to begin with and just told us what they were doing. Aren't they against the hyping of games anyway?
InsideGaming,2uvkg2,radkickflips,4,Fri Feb 6 09:41:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, but there is a line of course."
InsideGaming,2uvkg2,Shinzumano,-1,Fri Feb 6 10:37:06 2015 UTC,"For sane people, of course. They dont know all of their fans however, and I'm sure that line is nonexistant for some. When they IG posts all of these clues and says come and find us, they shouldn't be suprised if someone actually takes up the challenge."
InsideGaming,2uvkg2,kaizervonmaanen,-1,Thu Feb 5 18:17:07 2015 UTC,"You have fans all over the world. The ""line"" is something completely different is different cultures. Maybe you have fans that live in places where people get killed all the time and emergency phone calls is pretty normal. They probably do not have the same WEIGHT put on the concept as someone who rarely experience emergencies. Also on the internet there are several creeps and when you are entertaining then you probably invite those as well.  Sneaking around outside your window with the penis hanging out"

InsideGaming,2uvkg2,Aroused-dentist,0,Thu Feb 5 21:54:44 2015 UTC,"Especially since ""Hoys"" is how you would pronounce häus.   What? ä is pronounced like the a in bad or the a in sad so it would have been  haeus, why ""hoys""? there is no ä sound in ""hoys"" it makes no sense.  the a in haüs would probably be pronounced in a more germanic way and that would be pretty much like a english a."

InsideGaming,2utwqw,xXDragonKillKingXx,5,Thu Feb 5 06:50:19 2015 UTC,"So I've got a question. Does this mean the IG crew will now be doing those Minecraft lets plays and shit where it cuts between everybody's own perspectives of what's going on like RT does it, or are they doing their own thing just under RT's channel?  I mean, whatever they do I'll support, but I'd hate to see them just turn into something they weren't."

InsideGaming,2utwqw,theycallmedug,3,Thu Feb 5 13:56:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. I was a fan of RT before following IG, and I can say that I like IG's content better. I think Burnie and Matt are intelligent enough to respect the fact that IG's content is what got them their following, and to change that could have a negative impact. However, the same could be said about changing their content to attract a whole new audience...  TL;DR - I'm in the same boat as you."
InsideGaming,2utwqw,SilentlyAmazing,1 point,Thu Feb 5 14:05:51 2015 UTC,Rooster Teeth has been great at letting people do what they do best and leaving it at that. I doubt much will change.
InsideGaming,2utwqw,wolfej4,2,Thu Feb 5 17:37:19 2015 UTC,"Rooster Teeth seems happy enough to have their own 'silos' of content. The closest analogy to this situation was when they absorbed the Slo Mo Guys channel. It's not really comparable since Gavin was already an employee, but they've let the Slo Mo Guys do their own thing and haven't tried to alter the successful formula. I'm confident they'll do the same with IG."
InsideGaming,2utwqw,OrzBlueFog,1 point,Thu Feb 5 16:54:08 2015 UTC,I would think not. Most likely they will continue to do their own thing. I would bet you that IG and RT are reading through the sub reddits and seeing what we the people want.
InsideGaming,2utwqw,Wess_is_Bestin,4,Thu Feb 5 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"If they do move to rooster teeth, I hope they still stick to playing mainly pc games."
InsideGaming,2utwqw,Cheesy-potato,7,Thu Feb 5 05:35:16 2015 UTC,"RT fan here. I'm not familiar with IG, just looking at the subreddit with the news. I wouldn't worry about IG changing at all. RT hasn't changed with the fullscreen acquisition, except now they can afford to hire more people and do more things. IG will probably get the same deal: same stuff, more resources. Maybe some crossovers, but I doubt it since it's the West office."
InsideGaming,2utwqw,CashewGuy,1 point,Thu Feb 5 17:16:27 2015 UTC,"I expect there to be some crossovers with Burnie, seeing as he said he spends his time evenly between LA and Austin several months ago."

InsideGaming,2utwqw,Wess_is_Bestin,3,Thu Feb 5 14:05:11 2015 UTC,Gosh I hope they keep playing pc games. I feel like RT does a bit to much console gaming for my likings.
InsideGaming,2utwqw,TheNamesRolanQuarn,2,Thu Feb 5 14:47:19 2015 UTC,"Which is kinda odd when you consider they all have monstrous PC's. I remember in one episode of GO!

InsideGaming,2utwqw,wolfej4,1 point,Thu Feb 5 15:24:25 2015 UTC,"They've mentioned that $8000 computer several times. But to be fair, they are known as the Achievement Hunters, as in Xbox achievements. They do play PC games every once in a while, though. They played the Evolve alpha, 7 Days to Die, Speedrunners, etc. They have PS4s, too, but they rarely use those.  I'll be honest, I don't know much about IG, but from what I do know, they might do Let's Plays or things for The Know, Rooster Teeth's news series. But I'm just speculating. Time will tell."
InsideGaming,2utwqw,Wess_is_Bestin,1 point,Thu Feb 5 17:34:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I dont know. Gavin also said he had a $5k Mac...

InsideGaming,2utplv,Kincan,7,Thu Feb 5 06:11:36 2015 UTC,"I mean that's a fair question. The most likely answer, would be security. I was wondering why the inside gaming crew is all pining to leave from Machinima, and the answer, is that them trying to make it on their own would be way too risky. Not all of them would leave to do that. But if they got a job offer from another company... That's a different thing.  We have no clue what shifts will be announced in the next day or so, but it safe to assume that if rooster teeth hired to them all, most likely, they want them to make a very similar show to their existing one."

InsideGaming,2utn87,n0rum,261,Thu Feb 5 01:42:44 2015 UTC,"This man is either Burnie Burns, Creative Director / founder of Rooster Teeth or George Strompolos, CEO of Fullscreen. I'm going to have to go with the former based on clothing and body type. It's Burnie.  We've figured out the location of this office. It's The Culver Studios, which Fullscreen are based at. Rooster Teeth is owned by Fullscreen.   What does this mean? Simple. IG/Funhaus is owned by Rooster Teeth (which is owned by Fullscreen). The reason they're not at the building Burnie shared on his twitter is because it's not bloody finished yet. They need a place to stay in the mean time so they've been put up in The Culver Studios for a while. This explains the tiny-ass room with everyone huddled together.   Once the RT building is complete, they'll move away from the culver studios building, down a couple of blocks to the new RT building.   SUPER EDIT: IT'S FUCKING BURNIE!!!! https://twitter.com/JonRisinger/status/562693139027468288 Same jacket as he had on the plane going to LA!!!!! That's it lads, IG IS OFFICIALLY PART OF RT!!! :') HALLELUJAH WE'VE DONE IT!!!   BOOM!   SUPER EDIT 2: Here's an image I compiled showing the jacket is INDEED Burnie's. http://i.imgur.com/c97rlYi.png  SUPER EDIT 3: /u/Purplehaze2112 pointed out this other picture from Jon's twitter: http://pbs.twimg.com/media/B9DHCSsCAAA8Xim.jpg  Burnie wearing Jeans just like the man in the photo, check.

InsideGaming,2utn87,paeoco,0,Thu Feb 5 19:47:06 2015 UTC,WE DID IT
InsideGaming,2utn87,Tostificer,22,Thu Feb 5 20:11:52 2015 UTC,"The main reason I believe it is RT is the fact that neither side has denounced that idea. It has been the most popular guess the last day or so and I am sure people have been tweeting their hopes and dreams of it being RT at them and they haven't said it isn't. It's like buying a book for someones birthday and they keep guessing that its a brand new car, are you really gonna let them get their hopes up just to give them something completely different and hope they don't get mad? Also there might be a reason for IG not to say anything is off the table to keep up the suspense, there is no reason for RT to do that if they are gonna remain a separate entity."
InsideGaming,2utn87,Finnalian,7,Thu Feb 5 01:54:40 2015 UTC,"While signs are very much in the ""Hot RT/FH mansex"" direction (especially with Burnie and Jon having fallen off the face of the earth after when it looks like this was originally going to be announced), keep in mind that Adam/IG may not actually be able to confirm or deny anything as per the stipulations of whatever, and RT/Burnie may be in a similar position with Fullscreen. At the corporate level, negotiations and contracts are more important than hype and hurt feelings.  To use the gift metaphor: Imagine if a little kid is trying to guess what their gift is. They can very well go through the entire toy catalogue waiting for you to not say ""no"". So you just have a blanket ""I am not going to tell you if you are correct or not""  But yeah, it definitely is looking like a full on incesty Brady family situation, so yay."
InsideGaming,2utn87,Gundato,4,Thu Feb 5 02:24:43 2015 UTC,"True. While I am a big RT fan, the simple fact that wherever the IG guys are going, the fact that they are going somewhere as a group and not separating is what makes me the most excited."
InsideGaming,2utn87,Finnalian,6,Thu Feb 5 02:39:24 2015 UTC,"Same. I definitely come more from the RT side of the tracks, but I've been watching youtubes of the IG streams for months now and find them to be quite enjoyable. Great dynamic they have, and I look forward to being able to identify more than just Adam."
InsideGaming,2utn87,Gundato,12,Thu Feb 5 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"Garwood, I know you're a big name in the RT community. This should make you a fucking legend. I love you, man."

I have been watching their YouTube channel all day thinking that I had been missing something, but after several hours of viewing the only thing I chuckled at was a Bayonetta 2 let's play with Joel and Adam from RT.  So now I've got this feeling that IG is gonna be a part of something I otherwise don't care for (which Machinima kinda was anyway). It's almost like when your parents get divorced and your Mom gets remarried to an even uglier/fatter/meaner guy.  Can somebody point me in the right direction? Where can I see what the millions of people who love Rooster Teeth see? Because so far I'm not getting it."

I'm glad to see someone with a similar viewpoint, as expressing a ""dislike"" for rooster teeth is not a popular opinion. My only hope for IG is that they keep doing what they've been doing and that the personalities I have gotten to love over the past few years are not altered due to their new partnership with rooster teeth."

In my opinion, one of the biggest parts of their charm and humor is the massive amount of in-jokes and self reference, which is weird to get at first. If you really want to give their stuff a try, I'd check out the podcast, its definitely where you can pick up on most of the running jokes quickly. Also this live action short is great, you should check it out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRRYcQScnHY"

GameGrumps is a part of Polaris, but their content is still very different from other parts of Polaris. Whilst they do sometimes appear on the main channel, they maintain their own comedic styling but also have the security and funding of being with a larger network.  TL;DR Shit's kay."

InsideGaming,2uvlu7,Crousanator420,3,Thu Feb 5 15:29:03 2015 UTC,Seems like the signs are pointing to Rooster Teeth right now with all the 'proof' of a certain RT exec wearing 'that jacket' in 'that studio'.  From what I've read briefly however it seems RT are opening offices in LA? So perhaps the IG boys would have their own channel as 'Rooster Teeth West Coast' or something?? That I could get my head around a little more... :]
InsideGaming,2uvlu7,Tuddish,2,Thu Feb 5 15:36:09 2015 UTC,"Which is why they are basing out of LA and not being shipped via UPS one day air to Austin, TX.   However I think some people at Roosterteeth and achievement hunter could make some great collaboration projects with each other."
InsideGaming,2uvlu7,lostmau5,2,Thu Feb 5 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"Regardless it will be all the same people who edited the IG stuff before back together and the content shouldn't differ far off. I like the merger, it brings lots of new fans to both sides."
InsideGaming,2uvlu7,dawnporter,2,Thu Feb 5 15:34:50 2015 UTC,RT isn't my cup of tea neither. However I think new format will be more or less the same. They upload random game videos to their own channel and make 2 or more for RT channel every week. Flying solo would mean less money specially since all 7 left. RT will provide steady paycheck and boost in views. Just like Machinima but more freedom to mock Xbob One.

Just look at Michael Jones and Rage Quit, he's now an integral part of Rooster Teeth's biggest show and has been for a few years now, they've never made him change his original show."
InsideGaming,2uvlu7,larrydavids,1 point,Thu Feb 5 15:47:31 2015 UTC,I was thinking why don't they do there own thing?
InsideGaming,2uvlu7,SpoolesArmpit,1 point,Thu Feb 5 15:51:26 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't make the move to Roosterteeth if it limited their content in any way. If anything, Machinima was holding them back. They will probably have completely new series on this channel, but their comedy and style will largely stay the same."
InsideGaming,2uvlu7,SouLxTRaPPeR,1 point,Thu Feb 5 16:36:37 2015 UTC,"they will be allowed do what they want to do. Im guessing RT are going to give them a huge degree of freedom (them being on the other side of the country and all that) to do what they want. they had a lot of freedom at machinima and would no have left if they weren't getting the same or more freedom with RT. as for why they didn't start their own channel, well they wouldn't have enough capital to invest in all the tech they need that they got for free at machinima. I would also argue they aren't yet large enough to go alone and start up their own business. they would have to make enough money to pay their wages, rent, loans for start up investment, other overheads etc... RT is a good move for them. they will be allowed do what they want when the want."
InsideGaming,2uvlu7,TanFlo1997,1 point,Thu Feb 5 18:11:14 2015 UTC,"They way I think it will plan out is that Rooster Teeth is more of the platform on what IG will post their content too. I love Rooster Teeth and their videos but yes, if you compare the two editing styles and comedy they are pretty different. What I am hoping, and this may be the case, is that Rooster Teeth will let IG do their own thing, all Rooster Teeth is doing is providing the resources and letting IG get on with what they do best. I would be interested to see what Rooster Teeth would do to IG, and the change might be good but that is my idea right now."
InsideGaming,2uvlu7,TheGreenNightwing,1 point,Thu Feb 5 19:37:49 2015 UTC,"I sort of agree with you. I wasnt to thrilled about them joining RoosterTeeth but its all water under the bridge in any case cause ill support the guys with whatever they want to do. Also when you think about it, it makes perfect sense for them to join RoosterTeeth. A youtube channel only makes so much money, and when you have to split it 7 ways? Yeeaahh id say it makes perfect sense for them to join RoosterTeeth instead of creating their own channel, that way all the guys have a steady income and dont have to worry about money. Also i dont think we have to worry about RoosterTeeth ""messing up"" the content we know and love. From what i understand they are in charge of the west coast branch and are in full creative control of the Funhaus channel. Im sure we can expect some collabs but i dont think the dynamic of the videos will change that much."

InsideGaming,2uok15,ScorpioServo,71,Wed Feb 4 05:53:36 2015 UTC,"If this is to do with Rooster Teeth, they're probably going to the airport to pick them up. Although it doesn't look like there's room. Silly me.  Burnie Burns and Jon Risinger are flying in from Texas. We don't know which airport he flew from.   According to the LAX website:   A flight from Houston landed at 13:02 A flight from Dallas landed at 13:16   Obliviously security and baggage claim would mean that Burnie and Jon would be out of the airport a bit later than that, let's say 14:00. Local time in LA at the time of writing this is 13:42.  It checks out.  Edit: formatting  Edit 2: Jon Risinger now exists"

Still, with RT having a presence in LA collaborations are a lot more likely."

InsideGaming,2utd5u,DaLateDentArthurDent,1 point,Thu Feb 5 05:06:32 2015 UTC,I'm assuming that this whole FunHaus thing means they'll get their own channel. Plus with IG guys live streaming a lot there's more chances for RT Community game nights which have sorely been lacking of recent
InsideGaming,2utd5u,n0rum,1 point,Thu Feb 5 00:22:06 2015 UTC,"I am also scarred that IG will be intregrated into the RoosterTeeth Website And they will have ""premium exclusive content"" that only sponsors can see."
InsideGaming,2utd5u,EnigmaEVO,1 point,Thu Feb 5 00:25:20 2015 UTC,"I doubt that would happen, mainly because the sponsorship exclusives don't work like that. For example take Gavin Free (and Dan Gruchy)'s Slow Mo Guys, an outside channel that is now part of Roosterteeth. There is no exclusive content for sponsors nor is there any evidence I can recall that directly links the two channels other than Gavin. A similar principle would apply in this possible instance, the IG crew are known for a particular style of content and RT has shown they don't interfere with other content creators without a good reason. Hopefully that alleviates some doubts if the IG crew does team up with RT. If not, then I apologize for my shitty explanatory skills."

InsideGaming,2utgyo,drunkenbarfight,1 point,Thu Feb 5 00:59:32 2015 UTC,"I have a theory we are being purposely mislead by RT and IG in order to advertise each other. They make it seem waaaaay to obvious they are merging when in fact they might not. It seems they noticed the fans making up these theories since RT was opening up a LA branch and they decided to play along and give clues so they could both win some attention from fans of the opposite group. RT gets tons of interest by IG fans who may have not heard of them and IG gets tons of RT fans who want to look into who these ""IG"" people are since everyone thinks the merge is obvious. I think this might be a publicity stunt to gain new fans. But there is a 1/100 chance that this theory I have is actually what is going on."

I have seen a lot of people say that they don't want this to happen because they want IG to be independent and do their own thing. I totally understand this and want IG to keep being them. That being said, I think Burnie and the rest of Roosterteeth have always been pioneer's for internet entertainment and will allow IG to do things their own way. I  know that many of the people who work on content at Roosterteeth are allowed creative freedom in their personal projects and I think this will undoubtedly be what happens with IG.   TLDR: If this is true, I don't think joining RT will compromise the creative freedom for IG"
InsideGaming,2umz71,OfficialGarwood,116,Tue Feb 3 14:29:06 2015 UTC,"If anything, joining RT will bring them MORE freedom than what they had at Machinima. Burnie and co have always been big fans of what IG do and I'm sure, if this is true, Burnie would let Adam run the LA office as a somewhat independent entity."
InsideGaming,2umz71,DustyScabbard,27,Tue Feb 3 14:34:03 2015 UTC,"This would be wonderful the only thing that could make that scenario better is if they employed Mr Sark as well as he is based in LA with APL....Corr, That would be shag-tastic."

InsideGaming,2umz71,HUDuser,9,Tue Feb 3 19:23:43 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is that Skyrim with dicks is making a triumphant return in the form of a full playthrough? :D
InsideGaming,2umz71,NotKony,14,Tue Feb 3 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100%. I think it should also be noted that I think with IG leaving together as a unit, and showing they want to pursue bigger and better things, lends itself to them ensuring they would pursue an opportunity where their creative freedom is ensured and their opportunities/backing increase."
InsideGaming,2umz71,OWSBadger,5,Tue Feb 3 14:37:03 2015 UTC,Why is everybody saying that Adam should run it and not Joel?

InsideGaming,2umz71,IHopeTheresCookies,13,Tue Feb 3 19:52:24 2015 UTC,All but confirmed http://imgur.com/a/mi6D5
InsideGaming,2umz71,Will_U,15,Tue Feb 3 20:15:23 2015 UTC,"creative freedom in their personal projects   The fact that RT took Ray's Twitch and made him strop streaming on his own (seperate Twitch account*) seems to contradict that a bit.   I think they'll allow them creative freedom, but any content they produce would probably have to be under the RT umbrella.   *edit for clarity"
InsideGaming,2umz71,Halostruct,16,Tue Feb 3 15:31:39 2015 UTC,This is all wild speculation. No one knows what happened with Ray's twitch. For all you know it was his idea to convert it to the official RT channel. He may well get paid a little extra for being in charge of the twitch channel and helping to set it up.
InsideGaming,2umz71,Will_U,14,Tue Feb 3 18:15:21 2015 UTC,"We don't know what happened, but he did state he wasn't happy with what happened"

InsideGaming,2umz71,OfficialGarwood,11,Tue Feb 3 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"He mentioned it on his ask.fm around the time it happened. I don't have a link since I'm on my way to class, but if no one finds it by the time I get out, I'll search for it"
InsideGaming,2umz71,IHopeTheresCookies,5,Tue Feb 3 21:24:04 2015 UTC,"For all you know it was his idea to convert it to the official RT channel.    On his Ask.fm, Ray mentioned that he was contemplating leaving Rooster Teeth after what happened with his Twitch channel. So no, I don't think it was his idea haha!"
InsideGaming,2umz71,n0rum,4,Tue Feb 3 21:02:22 2015 UTC,What do you mean they made him stop streaming on his own? He did the two Walking Dead games and Saints row 4 not too long ago.
InsideGaming,2umz71,IHopeTheresCookies,3,Tue Feb 3 15:59:05 2015 UTC,That was on the RT Twitch. He can no longer stream on a personal channel. I'll update my post to clarify.
InsideGaming,2umz71,ShadyBiz,7,Tue Feb 3 16:14:23 2015 UTC,"I can understand where you're coming from. My main point is IG clearly had a plan for what they want to do, and wouldn't have signed on with Roosterteeth unless they could produce what they wanted, how they wanted. Will it have to be under the RT umbrella? Yes. Will that affect what they do (as compared to what they were doing with Machinima)? Probably not."
InsideGaming,2umz71,Omegasedated,1 point,Tue Feb 3 15:34:55 2015 UTC,I wonder if Inside Gaming Daily will continue but on Roosterteeth.com?
InsideGaming,2umz71,DaLateDentArthurDent,2,Tue Feb 3 21:06:48 2015 UTC,"I hope they'll do news still, but I'm not sure since RT already has a news show. And I sure as hell hope they aren't incorporated into any already existing shows. That would be exactly the kind of thing that people fear will happen. They could be just tacked on to something like ""The Know"" to gain views/popularity but have to read a script they didn't write. Hopefully RT just gives them their own channel and lets them do whatever they want."
InsideGaming,2umz71,IHopeTheresCookies,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:32:35 2015 UTC,"I'm from the RT side, I'm just here because of the speculation (although I've been watching IG content today and these guys seem great). Anyway, I'm not that familiar with IG and I didn't know if they actually had their own personal / individual streams that weren't under Machinima so I figured I'd clarify my with post above."
InsideGaming,2umz71,thesublieutenant,3,Tue Feb 3 15:42:40 2015 UTC,I would be willing to bet good money on the fact that it was due to an anti-compete clause that is in Ray's contract that it was taken away from him.
InsideGaming,2umz71,MattGooner,3,Tue Feb 3 18:31:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is a poor example. Ray was streaming, essentially the same content that RT provides. ""creative freedom in their personal projects"" does not mean ""produce the same content we sell"". I think it was naive of Ray to think RT would react in any other way.   If Ray was doing something else. I dunno, making the Rayburger, i don;'t think RT would request a hand in it..."
InsideGaming,2umz71,Griffonry,10,Wed Feb 4 01:36:30 2015 UTC,"They only took Rays Twitch account because it had a huge viewership already. Ray still has the freedom to stream whenever and wherever he wants. He streams regularly from his home. In fact he streams the most, he just gets paid to do it now."
InsideGaming,2umz71,dbarbera,4,Tue Feb 3 15:57:28 2015 UTC,"Ray still has the freedom to stream whenever and wherever he wants.   He can only stream on the RT Twitch is my point. Before, it was his own and gave him an opportunity to make additional money from the different incentives Twitch provides.    he just gets paid to do it now   I can't imagine his RT salary has changed just because he streams from home."
InsideGaming,2umz71,DaLateDentArthurDent,7,Tue Feb 3 16:13:26 2015 UTC,"Which was more or less directly competing with RT content. RT doesn't care that they have their own projects (Michael does some contract voice work outside RT shows). Ray streaming was more or less a violation of a non-compete clause, at least that's how it seemed to me."
InsideGaming,2umz71,Thunder_Child19,3,Tue Feb 3 16:20:48 2015 UTC,"You do know that people don't earn much money from Twitch besides donations anyway, right?"
InsideGaming,2umz71,OnlysayswhatIwant,3,Tue Feb 3 17:29:41 2015 UTC,I thought so too until i saw a streamer with 6000 subscribes which means that he makes around 15000 dollars a month with subscriptions alone. If you add donations too you could probably double that number.
InsideGaming,2umz71,PartTimeCrazy,2,Tue Feb 3 19:36:53 2015 UTC,He probably signed a non-compete clause when he signed his employment contract with RT. His twitch would have been directly competing with RT. This is something quite simple and common in any employment setting.
InsideGaming,2umz71,BobbyDavros,0,Tue Feb 3 20:05:59 2015 UTC,It's not like he set it up as his own personal account. It was called Rooster Teeth Ray
InsideGaming,2umz71,salamaleikum,2,Tue Feb 3 16:53:50 2015 UTC,"Rays channel name was RoosterteethRay,  RT asked him to change it to just RoosterTeeth and allow other people stream on it, pretty much making the channel open to everyone in RT, that's the only differences, the name and allowing other RT employees to stream, Ray keeps streaming on a regular basis.  Wasn't a big deal, Ray didn't had a sub button so isn't like they're preventing him from making money."
InsideGaming,2umz71,OWSBadger,5,Tue Feb 3 22:14:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. RT is a company, and we've seen them censor content or comments made during a video as to not offend people."
InsideGaming,2umz71,MetalDevilTV,7,Tue Feb 3 18:12:09 2015 UTC,"If you think they have a censorship problem, watch the New Year's episode of On the Spot with Geoff, Gavin, Joel and Jack.

InsideGaming,2umz71,Dicktron2000,7,Tue Feb 3 15:43:29 2015 UTC,They can create solid content but id like to see IG make that empire.

Im totally down to subscribe to a youtube channel and pay like on twitch 5 bucks a month for their shit.   again either way Il watch was just hoping it would be independent.

InsideGaming,2umz71,TimVT182,4,Tue Feb 3 15:46:50 2015 UTC,"I thought about it I don't think it would have been realistic. Why because unless someone has a very large pot of cash, they aren't going to get very far without an income. They essentially lost their old channel which was their viewership and income. Although I'm sure they will be re-establish pretty quickly, it is still going to take a bit of time.

InsideGaming,2umz71,omegacluster,8,Tue Feb 3 16:07:48 2015 UTC,"They don't have the capital to just start something on their own like that, not with all the people they took with them. They would need to start a youtube channel with 0 subscribers. Sure, most people on here would know to switch over to the new channel, but most people would not.   It would take them a significant chunk of time to build up to the viewer base they had on the I.G. channel/machinima channel, and all that time the seven of them need to make the money to actually survive.   Edit: Also, if they went on their own, Steam Roulette would be guaranteed to be dead, and that is one of their major videos they posted. The only reason they are able to do steam roulette is because they have a press account through Machinima that allows them to play the games for free for ""review."" These press accounts are very difficult to get, and since they would be a very small operation, they wouldn't be able to do it.  RT is a much bigger organization, and may have access to one of those accounts already."
InsideGaming,2umz71,Will_U,6,Wed Feb 4 01:09:37 2015 UTC,"I think people are thinking too much into this if this is what we think it is. All the questions will be answered in due course.   And as for the worry of IG changing who they are if they become part of RT. It seems like people have forgotten that they were a part of Machinama until last week. In my opinion, RT try to keep the restriction on content to a minimum. So if anything, IG will have a whole new sense of freedom when it comes to their content.   And RT have been running 12 years. With each year reaching new heights at an ever expanding company. They're not stupid, they understand the business. I highly doubt their intentions are to put a lot of money into setting up an LA office, bring in a crew with an existing audience, and change their content completely."
InsideGaming,2umz71,TheDutchTank,1 point,Tue Feb 3 17:24:59 2015 UTC,"Back you up on that one, of course the guys had a plan and of course they wouldn't move on from Machinima if they were to get more restricted about the stuff they like to do, so that should be a relief to anyone out there still anxious about their next adventure."

InsideGaming,2umz71,HSMeans,2,Tue Feb 3 18:25:50 2015 UTC,"Okay, i was getting worried there for a second."
InsideGaming,2umz71,Pete_Venkman,8,Tue Feb 3 18:50:12 2015 UTC,"Man as much as the idea of merging with RT sounds great...I hope we can keep our little community we have here. I love each and every one of you bastards, and if we had to split and join RT, it'd be like losing a family member! We the community are the extra man in the IG team! At least I like to think so"
InsideGaming,2umz71,PYRO-OliSlade,4,Tue Feb 3 19:29:10 2015 UTC,The rumor is that IG will be going to do the RT news show. (i dont know the official names as i dont watch RT). So if this subreddit become one for the news show we stay and get some new additions as Kovic said that IG are working on renaming the subreddit. I agree and would love for this community to stay as it is. This is all rumor based so ..... ya know.

InsideGaming,2umz71,braedonh,2,Tue Feb 3 16:45:34 2015 UTC,"Not sure why some people don't like this. They have already stated in the past that they don't like to work where views count on them getting paid. At Machinima they were on a fixed salary, they got paid regardless of views.  Which is why they also said that going to Patreon is not something they wanted to do. So presuming Rooster Teeth are offering that with creative freedom, fuck yeah.  I have nothing against them going to Rooster Teeth if true."

InsideGaming,2uort2,DaLateDentArthurDent,-3,Tue Feb 3 23:47:05 2015 UTC,SWEET JESUS. This is the news I've been waiting for. IG shall be independent. (Hopefully) (Prolly)  :D
InsideGaming,2uort2,Gundato,9,Wed Feb 4 00:39:41 2015 UTC,RoosterTeeth would have given them a lot of freedom compared to Machinina. They would have essentially been independent
InsideGaming,2uort2,DaLateDentArthurDent,1 point,Tue Feb 3 22:36:02 2015 UTC,"In all fairness: as much as I love RT, we don't know that. We don't know what their plans are for the LA office. It might very well just be a few people and a few setups so that they can do collaborations with other youtubers more easily (do recording in their own studios with setups they know), or it could be a full on ""Titans East"" deal. Or it could very well be them expanding the AH brand to include more people (that one is unlikely, but still possible).  While I find it unlikely they would be anywhere near as controlling as Machinima, we have no idea how independent whoever they work with will be."
InsideGaming,2uort2,DaShmoopy,3,Tue Feb 3 22:45:24 2015 UTC,"Well look at the freedom their offshoots have.   AH can do whatever they want, Geoff is given complete free control.   The Know, Ashley has complete control.  Slo Mo Guys has a lot of freedom.  IG are good friends with RT, they're not going to take complete control and force them into content they don't want to make. They respect one another"
InsideGaming,2uort2,DaLateDentArthurDent,3,Tue Feb 3 23:02:40 2015 UTC,"All I know is, in the end. If they join RT, it won't feel the same. Yeah, yeah, change is part of being human. But I just want the IG team back, under a new name and doing what they do best: Making us all laugh. Maybe joining RT isn't so bad, but it won't entirely sit right with me. But, I'm in the minority opinion. Who knows."
InsideGaming,2uort2,DaShmoopy,2,Tue Feb 3 23:07:08 2015 UTC,But why though? You want them exactly as they were under Machinima? But you want them to be independent?
InsideGaming,2uort2,Gundato,2,Tue Feb 3 23:10:56 2015 UTC,"It's hard to explain without me sounding like a dunce. You've got your viewpoints and opinion, I've got mine. You're probably right though, who cares about my opinion.   They'll probably join RT and whatnot. But I still don't like it. Whatever."
InsideGaming,2uort2,6tynein,2,Tue Feb 3 23:12:25 2015 UTC,"Geoff is one of the founders of the company, so he is very much a special case.   We don't actually know how the decision making works behind the scenes with The Know or how autonomous that department is.  SMG is also a weird case because it was an independent project that was acquired by RT... but was also made as a way for a guy (Gavin Free) to get into the country  Don't get me wrong, I think RT would probably have some of the best terms out there, especially with someone like Adam who they seem to actually be genuinely friends with and would probably trust to know what he is doing.  And I am a bit disappointed that it is looking less and less like the IG guys are going to join the RT family (but the LA office still suggests collaborations are likely). But RT has their own brands to protect, and IG would be direct competition with both AH and The Know (depending on what aspect), and Burnie has spoken quite regularly about the importance of protecting a brand and keeping their identity.  As an independent or smaller youtuber, I think joining the RT Network (assuming they ARE making one, again, all we know is that, as of this morning, they have announced they are making an LA office) would be a no-brainer. As a group that already has a fairly large following and their own brand (even if they probably can't really use it anymore, heh), it may not be a great idea. But, again, we don't know the details of any of this.  But just do what I am doing: Look on the bright side. The IG folk are hitting the ground running (and I for one love their streams), and the RT folk now have an office in LA which suggests they want to do more collaborations and projects involving the people out there... like the IG guys."
InsideGaming,2uort2,ALinkToTheReddit,1 point,Tue Feb 3 23:39:16 2015 UTC,"Geoff is a founder of RT and AH, he deserves free control Ashley and burney are dating Slow Mo Guys is a totally different channel Gavin also works with   Those points dont really prove much  Jack and Ryan aren't really heard from outside the office, Michael and Lindsay dont really do much and Ray can't stream when a RT event is happening (podcast, sponsor things)"
InsideGaming,2uort2,kulapik,-1,Tue Feb 3 23:15:00 2015 UTC,"Really? Because on the podcasts they talk about how their work relationship with them was. It seemed like very minimal requirements and ethics to follow. I feel rooster teeth would be more restrictive. I love both companies, don't get me wrong, but the way rooster teeth handeled Rays channel was absurd, the way let's play is set up is just awful, and the 3 podcasts they had going, the 5 channels they have, and many other things have lessened the shine on rooster teeth for me. They force so much content that it is impossible to watch it all. Throw inside gaming in there and it is just too much."

As Fun Haus, he turned to a life of crime and amassed a conviction record that included felony, robbery, assault, jay walking, and parole violation. Fun Haus' trademark is to conceal dangerous weaponry in the guise of innocent looking toys. During one Christmas holiday season, Fun Haus created the Presto Playpal action figure. It quickly become the most popular and sought after toy among children. The action figures were all part of Fun Haus' latest plan. On Christmas morning, the figures would activate and steal everything in sight. Unable to resist, Fun Haus used a likeness of his mask as the logo of the company that created the figures. Since it would be a matter of time until Batman discovered this, Fun Haus also dedicated a large part of his plan to distract Batman. He enforced an armada of Neptunian flying saucers made of plastic, exploding dolls, and Santa robots. It was not enough. On Christmas day, Batman and Red Tornado confronted and defeated Fun Haus. He was arrested on the scene and sentenced to Blackgate Prison and Iron Heights.  Autowikiabot is in favour of Title II registration, and you should be too. loading. . .

And thanks to u/RightousBurgers we know the model of the phone is, as far as we know a Nexus 5. And this is the page of a Nexus 5 with its specs http://m.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_5-5705.php. Now we can see  dimensions of said phone are 137.9 x 69.2 x 8.6 mm (5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in). But we can also use the length of the thumb in the picture. Now from the tip of the thumb to the knuckle is on average 2 in (50.8 mm). Now if we assume the whole thumb on screen is covering the name of the subreddit we can deduct the length of the name is between 5-7 letters ending with an ""S"" as established prior.

The Boys however were wearing badges with what I think was their names on them, in a reasonably sized room. Joel also posted a bunch of pictures of EMPTY PC monitor boxes. This leades me to believe that the offices they'll be using have already been prepared, and isn't that which Burnie posted.  I know, I know, I'm basically a black drunken Sherlock Holmes."

In addition to that, if they were to do their own thing, they would have ultimate control and decision making power. But if they join an already established entity (like RT) then they will have a boss telling them what to do potentially, or there may be a conflict of interest etc etc."

InsideGaming,2uphjn,OfficialGarwood,2,Wed Feb 4 11:33:11 2015 UTC,"I'm only familiar with the name, and I know that they do what IG does (?). That is all."
InsideGaming,2uphjn,IwasntinSmashMouth,2,Wed Feb 4 11:53:26 2015 UTC,"Ah okay. I was genuinely surprised you hadn't heard of them. Here's a couple awesome things they do:   Let's Play channel:  Let's Play is a channel ran by Achievement Hunter. A group within Rooster Teeth who focus on gaming content. It is led by Geoff Ramsey and contains people such as Ryan, Jack, Ray, Michael and Gavin etc.  On the channel they do multiple let's plays and shows. Their main attractions would be their MineCraft and GTA let's plays. They also have shows such as Go! and VS. which are fun too!   Red vs. Blue:  RvB is what made Rooster Teeth what it is today. It's the pinnacle of machinima filmmaking. It's a comedy series set in the Halo universe. Basically the premise is adding a storyline to multiplayer. Why are there red and blue soldiers and why do they fight each other in a boxed canyon? Be warned, the first season was made in 2003 so it looks old as shit. Also, there's currently 12 seasons, soon to be 13. This show is the longest running sci-fi show in America. Second longest running in the world (behind Doctor Who).  Immersion:  Basically it's Mythbusters meets video games. Burnie plans these elaborate tests based on video games to see if they'll be viable in real world scenarios. These include driving a car in third person, carrying all the weapons in doom at once and being able to shoot well whilst guys talk shit to you down an earpiece, just like in Xbox live. The show currently has two seasons with the first starring Gus and Geoff and the second starring Michael and Gavin.  The Gauntlet - Season Two:   The Gauntlet is a sort of not-serious-at-all gaming competition between different groups of players. 4 different teams compete to win the coveted Gauntlet trophy in different challenges based on different games and genres. The four teams include Rooster Teeth, Achievement Hunter, Team Internet (which Adam is on), and a team of RT fans. I linked Season two because Season one wasn't very good, even RT will admit that. The dynamics between Joel and Burnie as co-hosts is fucking glorious.  RT Shorts:  Since 2007, Rooster Teeth have been making high quality comedy shorts where they put fictionalized versions of themselves in different situations. Some of them are pretty ""meh"", especially the newer ones but there's some ABSOLUTE CLASSICS in there such as the Rooster Teeth facility tour.  RT Podcast:  The RT Podcast is, as the name would suggest, a podcast hosted by Gus Sorola with guests each week. It's taken many forms over the years starting as a simple audio podcast but has since moved to a live-streamed format from an actual pre-built set with a big production value. Basically this is the ULTIMATE place to go if you want to hear about dicks and science. Example conversations include, but are not limited to: Vaginal waxing, assassin snails, sliding down mountains to survive a plane crash, fleshlights, which way is ""up"" in space, masturbation habits, violence diarrhea, ejaculating on a plane etc.   RWBY:  RWBY (pronounced ""Ruby"") is a CGI Anime-style animated series created by the late Monty Oum. This was his final creation before his untimely death. The show focuses on a group of young would-be heroes as they battle the evil ""grimm"" using powers granted to them by a substance known as ""dust"". The name RWBY is the name of the team of 4 protagonists. Each letter is both an initial of their name and also their colour.   R is Ruby/Red, W is Weiss/White, B is Blake/Black, Y is Yang/Yellow.  Two seasons (known as volumes) have been made thus far with Volume 3 about to head into production, although this may be delayed due to Monty passing away.   On The Spot:  On The Spot is a brand-new live-streamed gameshow hosted by Jon Risinger. It's similar to a lot of British comedy shows like Mock The Week or Nevermind The Buzzcocks etc. Basically, two teams of two play different rounds and have to give the funniest / most interesting answers possible for points. The winner wins the Golden Gus (a gold status of Gus Sorola). Be prepared to be offended. Trigger-warnings galore."
InsideGaming,2uphjn,lemonz333,1 point,Wed Feb 4 13:45:04 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. I don't know where the IG guys would fit into a bigger Rooster Teeth picture. Everything IG does, the parent company would already have a hand in. Rooster Teeth has what? 4 podcasts, 5 gameplay related shows a week, and God only knows how many gaming news segments. I worry that if they become a part of that company then after a while they'll slowly get swallowed into a bigger group where the guys who I've watched and loved and have gotten me through some rough shit become 6 or 7 more characters for RT to throw in their million videos a week. Also to your point about how the fanbase would feel different. Shit, that's already happening. Most of the comments are now Roosterteeth dominated, most of the posts are Roosterteeth speculation and a lot of the downvotes seem to be going to dissenting opinions on how God Tier the merger would be. I love Inside Gaming. I love the guys and ultimately want them to make the decision that makes them happiest and most financially stable. If that's with Roosterteeth, then Im on board, but damn am I scared.  Edit: typos like a champ."
InsideGaming,2uphjn,libertarian_reddit,1 point,Wed Feb 4 03:35:18 2015 UTC,"I'm actually concerned about this because I don't want them to drown in the sea of videos that comprise the Roosterteeth channel every week. If they so happen to be part of Roosterteeth, I hope they stay the same: content unchanged. I was introduced to Inside Gaming by Roosterteeth, and, now, I honestly prefer watching their videos to Let's Plays and The Know. Don't change guys!"
InsideGaming,2uphjn,TyCooper8,1 point,Wed Feb 4 05:07:33 2015 UTC,"As /u/Black_Nerd pointed out, we still have no idea what is actually happening. The idea that the guys are joining Roosterteeth is purely speculation at this point. Who know what's really going to happen? They could be partnering with Pewdiepie for all we know."
InsideGaming,2uphjn,Thunder_Child19,-1,Wed Feb 4 05:25:44 2015 UTC,"I think you're wrong, especially about the whole ""competing shows"" thing. I've watched every single IG and RT video for years. The beauty of YouTube, is that you don't have to pick one channel; you can watch them all. I think if they brought IG into the fray, in regards to The Know, it would help The Know gain tons of popularity if IG Daily was put in there. You make it sound like more content is a bad thing, which obviously isn't the case.  I do agree that IG has a slightly different vibe than a RT video, but you're assuming they'll take a RT format of things if they were to merge, which I think is completely incorrect. In my opinion, they'd stay the exact same; Rooster Teeth already has great relationships with the guys, and know that their videos are hilarious. I think that a RT merger would be perfect for the guys; it would provide them with the money and assets needed to finally become the wildly popular guys they deserve to be."

While it would be neato to have a name mentioned on the old channel as the actual title of the venture, we really have no idea what's going on. I assume the mods are deleting the posts relating to it because the subreddit's being filled with wild speculation, which might be setting us up for disappointment."

Ten days ago Monty suffered a severe allergic reaction during a simple medical procedure that left him in a coma. Although he fought bravely, his body was not able to recover. During his time in the hospital he was well cared for and never in pain at any time. Monty is survived by his wife Sheena, his father Mony, his brothers Woody, Sey, Chivy and Neat, and his sisters Thea and Theary, as well as a countless number of fans and friends. We were so proud to be a part of his life and we will miss him greatly. Your generosity during the hours after the public statement on Friday will help his family deal with the costs of his care and his passing. You made an incredible difference during a difficult time and we cannot thank you enough. As for honoring Monty, we will do that in our own way. In lieu of flowers or gifts, we ask that you simply do something creative. Use your imagination to make the world a better place in any way that you can. If you know Monty like we do, then you know he would certainly be doing that if he were able to. Monty was 33 years old. We love you, Monty."""

Condolences to his family and friends and everyone who had the privilege of working with him or even knowing him. The man was an inspiration to so many. He inspired so many upcoming and talented animators and others who wanted to enter the industry. His work ethic was nothing short of god-like. How a man could be so efficient and so passionate in his work and what he believed in. It goes to show how much of an amazing person he was. Right now, I'm struggling to come to terms with it all and I'm not sure how I feel. I'm not a religious man but my prayers will be for his loved ones. May he rest in piece.

InsideGaming,2uk572,MachinimaMatty,52,Mon Feb 2 21:13:16 2015 UTC,"Because of the work that the guys put into Inside Gaming, I think they will always be synonymous with the brand. They got it to where it was and left on such a high.  Would it be better, perhaps, to start from the ground up? Get a fresh set of faces but also a new name. That way the old IG fans will not be constantly comparing it to the IG we all knew and loved.  I understand the brand has now already been built, but if you start from the ground up you'll be giving fresh talent the opportunity to forge a reputation for themselves. They'll then have more creative control to take the show where they want, without being stuck with the IG name... much like Kovic did.  Not sure this is much help, but thought it'd be a good opportunity to voice my opinion.  All the best in whatever direction you choose to take this"
InsideGaming,2uk572,ValhallaStanton,10,Mon Feb 2 22:22:25 2015 UTC,Definitely not opposed to a new name and new take.  Thank you so much for your opinion!

InsideGaming,2uk572,badcompanysarge,10,Tue Feb 3 02:51:48 2015 UTC,I think that most of us watched the show for the people presenting it. If you're continuing Inside Gaming then you will probably need to test out different hosts in order to see who we respond to best.

InsideGaming,2uk572,maggosh,5,Tue Feb 3 02:12:33 2015 UTC,"There's several reasons why I loved IG, like everyone else.  Obviously the personalities & humor kept me coming back but more importantly, it was because they never really insulted the viewer's intelligence.  It felt like an honest show of people telling you their opinion & news.  Not pandering or trying to get a view count. The topics they reported on evoked discussion & taught me more about the video game industry than the years I spent reading Game Informer & going to other gaming outlets.  As long as they're free to have a fair amount of creative control like those past guys were, hopefully it'll still feel like that.  That's my hope for the future of IG & the new IG staff.  That they remain informative, entertaining & sincere.  They'll have & form their own personalities.  It shouldn't feel like trying to recreate Adam & Bruce, etc.  Just fun, funny, smart people who know what they're talking about, not just reading words.  To me, the spirit of IG was people hanging out, playing & talking about games & having fun."

I'm not suggesting that you clone Bruce, Adam, James, and Sean (Spool), but please don't get the weak personalities of Ricky and Elliot on ETC. Instead, get hosts and technicians who have their own unique ideas that would put a new spin on the show.  Inside Gaming is a torch that is being passed from one crew to another, let the new crew have complete control over the show. Do  not force them into copying the styles of Adam and Bruce. Give the new guys your trust and free reign and their eventual success will come with a new generation of viewers."

InsideGaming,2uk572,WAB91,1 point,Fri Feb 6 16:29:04 2015 UTC,"The way I see it you guys (at Machinima) have to ""crash test"" the whole thing. The show that the IG crew left it's a difficult one to recreate, but you have to establish first and foremost, what this new inside gaming will be doing? From news to gameplay, discussions and series the ""Joel's Hole crew"" did it all, but with their own spice, so I guess the task you have is figuring out what segments needs to stick around under a new host that is willing to let his personality and lifestyle be poured into the show while staying true to what the channel is focused: Videogames and the love for them. I agree with my fellow actors that have commented here before me, we as the audience will be keepin' and eye out to see who's coming and what are they doing next (on the IG Channel) so you can expect a lot of feedback."

InsideGaming,2uk572,benjaminw6633,1 point,Mon Feb 2 23:49:56 2015 UTC,"As a film student, it's been easy to see why certain channels or shows here on youtube start to get hate or a bad rep. I'v noticed that IG has been one of those shows that hasn't fallen to that. Since one of my professors is close friends with Steve and Larson, I do know that Machinima does employ a ""low budget"" look to prevent shows from looking ""too good"" and alienating the average gamer audience. I think a reason why we here all love IG so damn much is that the show has always felt personnel, like these guys are making these videos with soul and heart for us and not for corporate. With that being said, the show shouldn't be trying to replicate that formula but instead keep it as a guideline and grow from there.  -Justin"
InsideGaming,2uk572,Broxgreg,1 point,Tue Feb 3 00:22:04 2015 UTC,"let's be honest, what Adam did with inside gaming, as well as the crew, definitely cannot be matched. I think that you should leave IG as IG and maybe considering starting something else under a different brand. I know that a lot of people/fans will hate if new faces take the show and the channel, for I personally do not mind because I'm going to be sincere, I won't be watching machinima anymore; Well, maybe if the new ""gaming and news"" guys are somehow interesting, then I might consider coming back once in a while.  But personally, I think the legacy that the IG crew had should be left as it is as of now because they left it in such a great shape. Building upon that will maybe, I said MAYBE, destroy what Adam originally created and acheived for the last 9 years or so.  tl;dr Create a new gaming and news channel with your new crew leaving IG as it is."
InsideGaming,2uk572,CZiemba,1 point,Tue Feb 3 09:35:24 2015 UTC,I agree that whatever replaces IG should not keep the name and neither should they copy how IG presented the show. Though I would like to see personalities similar to IG in terms of messed up humor and randomness galore like KassemG in he's Askkassem series as a good example.
InsideGaming,2ujxn3,antstar12,45,Mon Feb 2 20:18:02 2015 UTC,"I've been squeezing information out of some of the IG crew, and:   that aren't leaving LA. They are already at work, in an office. EDIT: possibly rules out a start-up. Lawrence talked about a salary at the new place, again, ruling out a start-up funded by themselves. Lawrence asked us (without confirming or denying) our opinion on a RT merge. Lawrence (again, damn leaker) said that someone on the internet already guessed it. They talked about ""an opportunity"", again, suggesting to me they were headhunted.   EDIT:   Lawrence also said they will have a new channel. (Lawrence, you leaked too much. You're fired.)   EDIT 2:   Lawrence has said below not to rule out a start-up. I'm not business savvy, so wasn't aware what actually went into a start-up, but they do get salaries in the conventional type. He also pointed out that this is pretty cherry-pick..ish. Which is true, but that's because I feel like this is the most likely situation.   This to me points to a RT: LA branch.   Whatever they do, it will be awesome. I don't believe the IG crew would consider it if they didn't have even more control over their content than they currently do. I don't believe they will merge with an existing group of people in an existing office, but I could be wrong.  Then again, they could be doing something completely off the wall.

Rooster Teeth LA headed by Adam under the supervision of Burnie and Matt. Yep, would be all sorts of okay with this."
InsideGaming,2ujxn3,a_creative_name,5,Tue Feb 3 03:20:37 2015 UTC,"Let's hope they give conformation about what is happening soon, all this teasing is difficult to handle, there is only so much Cunt, Tunt and Munt i can watch."
InsideGaming,2ujxn3,divingboardbicycle,2,Mon Feb 2 22:40:26 2015 UTC,"I thought of this at 2am GMT without hearing about anything Lawrence had said :) I think this would make the most sense seeing as they already have a relationship with RT and that they do similar videos. Adam had stated before that they were going to work together in some way and that he wanted to make IG's production more like Rooster Teeth's. To me this new branch makes the most sense for completing those goals. I'm guessing Adam would be the leader of this new section of RT, which would give him the power to hire new people(like some of the us fans who have produced IG related content like the animations) to work for them, and expand the team. Lastly if what we are speculating is true we know that the new channel will have a large sub count within the first few days as RT would be pushing for this new channel to get off the ground. Therefor we will not have to worry about the guys struggling to break even for too long."
InsideGaming,2ujxn3,unicorncharlieman,2,Mon Feb 2 22:35:06 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I forgot a point. Lawrence also said they will have a new channel."

InsideGaming,2ujxn3,Kitty3feet,2,Mon Feb 2 22:46:48 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Burnie mentioned expanding to LA after the fullscreen acquisition so it wouldn't surprise me if IG were apart of that. Edit - Found some info from burnies journal http://roosterteeth.com/members/journal/entry.php?id=3274754&uid=5&page=2&c=15399909
InsideGaming,2ujxn3,OfficialGarwood,3,Mon Feb 2 23:07:50 2015 UTC,Damn that's some pretty good evidence for IG becoming the LA branch of RT. Our suspicions are becoming more and more likely.
InsideGaming,2ujxn3,snwlprds,3,Mon Feb 2 23:27:56 2015 UTC,Dude put this up in the main thread. A big piece of evidence. I'd call it a confirmation.

In my opinion, (of course it can go both ways) by him saying that they'll be watching and that they're allowed down time means to me that they're going to be watching over them but not controlling them. Much like a boss that allows creative freedom would do. The guy is an editor for anything Roosterteeth throws at him, so he would be watching their videos too if he had to edit them.

Adam is the only one I knew due to being in a Roosterteeth show (Gauntlet Season 2, if you havent seen it I'd recommend it, you'll get to know the rest of the RT crew as well) and Adam seemed to blend in great with the rest of RT.

InsideGaming,2ujxn3,Montezum,3,Tue Feb 3 04:22:50 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with it, only if RT gives the IG crew full creativity on their channel/videos. These guys are really funny, and need to have complete freedom over their projects to do what they want."
InsideGaming,2ujxn3,alowester,3,Tue Feb 3 04:39:23 2015 UTC,RT is usually pretty good on allowing employees full creative licence.

I love RT, I love IG and as a Brit who has been and spent a lot of time in America it has become my dream and life's ambition to move to America at some point in my life. We all have a dream and that's mine. I occasionally make YouTube videos as a hobby and want to learn more advanced video editing in my spare team. If this does happen, my lifelong dream might change to move to America and work for RT/ IG/ Whatever it is that happens. Its an incredible long shot I know, but its always good to have ambition :)"

InsideGaming,2uirsn,Poncho44,11,Mon Feb 2 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"Normally I would 100% agree with you, but I didn't watch IG for the news, I watched it for the personalities.  Simple as that.  I'll give the first one a watch, but I strongly doubt it'll hold my interest.  If the new guys are good enough to merit me taking additional time (if I have it) to watch their stuff, then sure."
InsideGaming,2uirsn,Aroused-dentist,2,Mon Feb 2 15:58:55 2015 UTC,"For me it was a mix, i watched their Chanel for the personality but i watched the news for the news."
InsideGaming,2uirsn,NoodleNed,1 point,Mon Feb 2 16:16:21 2015 UTC,"yeah I agree with aroused-dentist. I watched the show because of both. They're both informative, not biased and entertaining."
InsideGaming,2uirsn,NKLhaxor,9,Tue Feb 3 06:47:19 2015 UTC,People still bitch about Khail. I doubt this will be any different.
InsideGaming,2uirsn,alanski181,1 point,Mon Feb 2 19:04:17 2015 UTC,"Khail was one guy, talented but just a guy. ETC is still a good show, it is funny. But IG is an entire crew full of hardworking, funny people. It will be nearly impossible make a new inside gaming with a unexperienced team. It is going to be bad to say the least. Perhaps the new team will be funny too, but they'll have a difficult time adapting to the speed and most importantly the quality of the old IG videos."
InsideGaming,2uirsn,NoodleNed,2,Mon Feb 2 22:05:10 2015 UTC,"yeah I agree. Khail was awesome, he made the show. But the undeniable truth is, everyone will eventually leave at some point to make much more awesome things.  Ricky and Eliott are awesome. Let's give a damn fuckin' chance to whoever is replacing the IG crew."
InsideGaming,2uirsn,dj_smu,6,Tue Feb 3 06:34:52 2015 UTC,Knowing the Youtube Comment Section (which is like the deepest Abyss anyway) the hate will be overwhelming regardless of what Machinima will do with the IG brand.  I'll give it a go IF they actually reboot it with other people. But the personalities of Kovic and co. made that channel so it'll be hard to hold the torch for the new people .
InsideGaming,2uirsn,Crumpingtos,2,Mon Feb 2 17:14:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be above letting someone like Steve and Larson taking over. They're pretty funny and if anyone had to replace the IG crew, I'd say they're the guys."
InsideGaming,2uirsn,Mista_Wong,1 point,Tue Feb 3 00:29:09 2015 UTC,"I've got a gut feeling that they will go to RoosterTeeth which wouldn't be worrying.

InsideGaming,2uirsn,Nikazio,1 point,Mon Feb 2 21:54:19 2015 UTC,"No no no, this isn't how it works on the internet at all, everytime there's a change, be it Inside Gaming be it Khail be it Jontron on Game Grumps or whatever, everyone hates it and it has a huge backlash, every single video has 90%+ dislikes, then a few hateful weeks pass and if the new content itself is good then it'll slowly start being accepted, even if not everyone that used to watch the old stuff likes it, it will have a new-ish audience. Adopting someone elses channel gives you the advantage to have an audience instantly but you'll be held to impossible standards and everyone will hate you... for at least a month, but it can be done.  The bitching will never stop though, there's always someone still bitching about it years after it happens."

InsideGaming,2uhm71,Viperspider,1 point,Mon Feb 2 15:15:49 2015 UTC,I cant imagine that you use your laptop/PC for more than basic stuff like internet browsing so it would be less common to run into problems like that.  But whenever I've had to use Vista it's been more trouble than it's worth when it comes to installing things and even connecting to wifi. Gaming was a pain on it.

InsideGaming,2uhm71,mandatorytoast,3,Mon Feb 2 16:54:03 2015 UTC,yeah. Although I'm using 8.1 at the moment and I'm loving it. All the gripes people had with 8 have pretty much gone with 8.1   I am excited for Windows 10 though.
InsideGaming,2uhm71,Viperspider,1 point,Mon Feb 2 17:02:59 2015 UTC,At work I've been given a Win8.1 laptop and I find it to be quite frustrating. I miss my start menu.. it's much harder to find files and programs that are off the desktop now. It sort of forces you to use shortcuts and shit.
InsideGaming,2uhm71,Cheesewithmold,2,Mon Feb 2 17:05:58 2015 UTC,You need this! I haven't looked at the metro thing in months.

InsideGaming,2ukiqo,ByTheBeardOfBruce,3,Mon Feb 2 22:59:02 2015 UTC,"Personally can't stand IGN, from their ""talent"" to their two minute maximum videos so they can rake in maximum views. They're part of what pushed me towards Machinima in the first place. Definitely won't be going back."
InsideGaming,2ukiqo,TheKidWithBieberHair,-5,Tue Feb 3 04:32:57 2015 UTC,"Naomi Kyle? Not that she's a bad presenter but I find her too ""distracting"", if you know what I mean."
InsideGaming,2ukiqo,Malgurath,2,Tue Feb 3 00:22:47 2015 UTC,"Either wait until Machinima has a new IG or the IG crew gets their new channel up. In the meantime, read some news articles. Primary sources are often better."

InsideGaming,2ub9v2,TheSolarSentinel,31,Sat Jan 31 17:18:25 2015 UTC,"I actually think that a ""rebranding"" could be good for them. I know they were pretty popular already, but if they do create a new channel and have good quality from the start then they could gain new fans and become even bigger than they were.  Being attached to the Machinima brand has its disadvantages, more so being that many people just ignore anything Machinima uploads, evident by their 12 million subs. I only found out about IG a year ago because I used to just ignore everything they uploaded and many people still do because they used to upload hundreds of videos daily and people haven't bothered going back since the new and improved machinima. I just wish I found it earlier but I am still upset about this.  But a new channel with an already strong fan base could grow into something bigger and better, I really hope it does. I'll be there till the end.  I reckon they wont go alone though, I am sure there are other networks such as Maker that would help them grow."

The day I saw one of you staying late, obsessing over your channel statistics was one my proudest moments for you guys; to see someone else care that much for their own content at the company just made me so happy.   You guys work your asses off everyday, you're doing fantastic content and you're actually invested in what you do: I see nothing but good things in your future.   I'm going to miss you guys lots but lets be honest here. We all live in LA, we're still friends and we'll still see each other plenty to bitch about work and smack talk or geek out over movies, shows and games.

XD  I've been watching since the 'Inside Halo' days and hand to my heart they have been just getting better ever since. And this posse they have going right now seems to be the most perfect mash up yet. I wish I had such an awesome group of mates in my own life, but watching these videos really makes feel like I'm there hanging out and talking shit right along side them.   Honestly thanks for the years of entertainment, fellas. It's a damn honour being part of the journey."

InsideGaming,2uch62,ifrogotmyname,17,Sat Jan 31 22:11:06 2015 UTC,"Ehh. I'd wait and see what their situation is, once they actually start the YouTube channel. For all we know, they're perfectly fine, and don't need anymore money.  But I could be wrong. Like I said, wait and see."
InsideGaming,2uch62,TJDguy,7,Sat Jan 31 22:18:58 2015 UTC,"In all honesty I don't see how 4 of them can be sustainable on a single  Youtube channel. After 2 years of the Inside Gaming channel they made a mention that are close to breaking even. I don't see how they could go 2 years restarting a new channel losing money monthly. I always felt their setup was not financially possible, but with Machinima money flowing in to pay salaries it kept them afloat for this long.  They would have to broaden their model to encompass other means of income, via Twitch (much more frequent), website with ads and other ad revenue streams. It's not going to be easy if this is what they want to do in the future, but they have been doing this long enough they probably have the knowledge to get it up and running decently.  And before you all go and deny this saying they are already popular and a new channel would be instantly huge, I highly doubt that's the case. Only ~20k people even care to a part of the reddit."
InsideGaming,2uch62,Fermions,6,Sun Feb 1 00:30:11 2015 UTC,"4 of them? Isn't there 7 of them? Adam, Bruce, James, Lawrence, Joel, Spoole and Matt."
InsideGaming,2uch62,M4dx,4,Sun Feb 1 10:42:56 2015 UTC,Maybe they left machinima to go over to Polaris. Everyone that leaves machinima end up there and like it better it seems

InsideGaming,2uch62,DickPinch,2,Sun Feb 1 00:19:46 2015 UTC,my guess is that they'll try with a youtube backed by Patreon at first.

InsideGaming,2uch62,antstar12,1 point,Sun Feb 1 15:43:35 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they got offered by some backer so leave machinima for more creative freedom and possibly better pay. So in that case they may not need any support. I think it will be case of waiting to see what they are doing then asking them if they need any financial support.
InsideGaming,2uch62,LykhaioS,1 point,Sun Feb 1 16:18:41 2015 UTC,"Also remember Adam doesn't really likes to ask directly for money to the viewers, I think he said something similar (about not asking fans for money) in a tweet some days ago."
InsideGaming,2uch62,Tefur,1 point,Sun Feb 1 21:26:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's likely that they are part of and RT expansion to LA -if that's the case, RT will sort them out. So I'd wait until they make an official announcement about what they're doing. It's a nice thought though."
InsideGaming,2uch62,temaj,0,Tue Feb 3 11:11:50 2015 UTC,Perhaps they could start from their individual homes and collaborate online until they have established a stable Youtube channel (views consistent with their Inside Gaming / Machinima views)and then get their office/floor space to continue creating content together like they were at Machinima.

IGD was different, it had character, it had class. It had a uniqueness to it. Bruce's trademark humps and Yes-es, Lawrence always talking through Skype even though he's in the same room. Also, not only do they read the news, they give their own opinion on it and they see it from both sides. It's not just super biased either.

InsideGaming,2u9hih,Dr_Richtofen115,1 point,Sat Jan 31 11:05:02 2015 UTC,"Phil was one of my favorite people on Inside Gaming, but it's difficult to think of something in the entertainment sphere that he could do because his role has been limited and the only thing that resonates with him from the ETC show is that he he doesn't really watch the trailers.   In the gaming sphere he watched trailers with the same mild level of enthusiasm, but you knew the style of games he liked from the Phil's picks. Because his niche was unique, funny, genuine, and passionate, his personality resonated. This was evident every time he pulled out a poster or a figurine or something from his desk.   I hope his entertainment tastes are just as strange and genuine. When personalities just like whatever everyone else likes, then they are no longer unique and become very uninteresting and interchangeable.  What made Phil relatable on IG is not the fact he liked a specific stupid game but the concept of liking games that others rip on and rather than hide them, he was open, brazen, and passionate.     Rough Ideas: If you are trying to just incorporate him into the ETC show or something like that, I could see Phil doing a quick segment on movies coming out on dvd (maybe compare the quality of the movie to the trailer he previously showed) or discussing new additions to or hidden gems in services like netflix."

I see a thin man carrying a laptop. As they near I see it is Joel an Lawrence. They are arguing about how to pronounce ""GIF"". They stop arguing for a moment, and nod knowingly in my direction, and then continue on. As I watch them leave Matt walks up behind me and, puts his hand on my shoulder.

I think the train simulation game with James as the evil conductor is the funniest thing I've watched from you guys and that's beating off the likes of Blade, Chaser, Ride to Hell and so many other classics such as Tunt and Cunt.

InsideGaming,2u8kcj,jrluk86,2,Fri Jan 30 21:14:11 2015 UTC,"For those that like Imgur: http://i.imgur.com/APcZptc.jpg  (Ignore the watermarks. I finally got into Digital Art, but I needed something to use)  Rambling Ahead; bear with me if you would like to.  So... It's come to this day. It breaks my heart to see the channel lost. The IG team changed much of my life, and so did the community as well. I was hoping that IG would continue till the guys were graying and complaining to the younger generation about how gaming was better back then. But not everything can go the way you hope it can.   To be entirely honest, I took a brief hiatus from the channel and the community. I came back to the channel after a few months and so much had changed. I even came close to unsubscribing to the subreddit. But for some reason, something inside of me told me to stay. I developed a connection with the guys, and abandoning the subreddit felt like I was going to abandon friends.   I owe much to IG. I had originally saw their videos when it was nothing more than GTA IV mods, and strange simulator games. I stalked about for several months, binge watching videos. Hell, IG was the sole reason I even joined reddit in the first place. I wanted to see the fanart the community came up with and submit my own as well, and read whatever was interesting on the subreddit. For some reason, this was the only place where I had the urge to do any art whatsoever. Although it wasn't much, I still submitted what I could, and most of the time, you guys would drop a comment. It felt great whenever that happened! I also tried to make my art better each time, and develop my style. I feel that being in the IG community helped me do that as well.  The community was also something unique. I eventually fell in with the ""regulars"" (Kip, Rat, Nate, Corey, MrMc, Evo, Dentist, Scots, Bob, and the other actors on the TS Server). It was amazing how wacky the community was.   Well, it's pretty hard to put what I'm thinking into words, so I'll end on this:  Wherever you guys go, I wish you the best in whatever it is.   Goodnight, and Good Luck  XOXO <3  God Bless  Live Long and Prosper  Sleep Tight, Don't Let the Bed Bugs Bite  Merry Christmas... And a Happy New Year  I'll just keep stalking about, waiting for whatever your new endeavor is going to be, and hoping I can become an unpaid intern like James was.

I have a degree in visual communication that covered everything from motion graphics to claymation and have never really used it.  Hearing Adam and Bruce talk about how they started and what it takes is really inspiring.    One thing that a lot of people don't talk about is that it's hard to do something like make videos and edit them and post them online when you have a shitty day job, obligations at home, a wife/husband/family, and anything else that you have to do in order to live before you can work on something that might lead to a new career or even a hobby.  I'm not saying its unrealistic to achieve that, but it's hard.  The IG crew inspires me so much.  Thanks."

InsideGaming,2u73y9,Black_Nerd,17,Fri Jan 30 14:04:27 2015 UTC,"One thing that I'll never understand is that Khail just....disappeared from the Machinima channel, while IG is having a week long of farewells."
InsideGaming,2u73y9,Montezum,12,Fri Jan 30 14:47:10 2015 UTC,Because Machinima really screwed Khail over
InsideGaming,2u73y9,GerardBenard,3,Fri Jan 30 14:59:07 2015 UTC,Why do you say that?
InsideGaming,2u73y9,Montezum,10,Fri Jan 30 16:31:43 2015 UTC,"Look at Machinima's Twitter and other employees from ETC and others.  All wishing IG great luck and honoring them (which they should do). When Khail left there was no goodbye video, no good luck tweets.  One day he was just gone with no closure."
InsideGaming,2u73y9,GerardBenard,4,Fri Jan 30 17:34:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what you said makes sense"
InsideGaming,2u73y9,Montezum,1 point,Fri Jan 30 18:09:00 2015 UTC,How is that Machinima screwing him over? I don't know the situation but if he just quit with no notice how/why would anyone wish him good luck in his future endeavors? But like I said I don't know the entire situation but if he just up and quit I have little sympathy but if he did give notice and what not good on him.
InsideGaming,2u73y9,Unemployed-Rebel,1 point,Fri Jan 30 19:22:00 2015 UTC,I'm not going to act like a know the whole story because I obviously don't.  Though from what I know (from watching most of Khail's streams) is that Khail wanted to move ETC into more sketches and creative videos.  So one day Khail put up a video that Machinima didn't approve.  And the next day they brought Khail in and fired him.
InsideGaming,2u73y9,GerardBenard,8,Fri Jan 30 20:30:21 2015 UTC,That's not what happened.
InsideGaming,2u73y9,grovergrover,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:36:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know everything, you would obviously know more than me. I should really know better than saying all this. Kind of something blown out of proportion."
InsideGaming,2u73y9,GerardBenard,5,Sat Jan 31 04:44:29 2015 UTC,"Me and Ricky haven't talked much about it because Khail hasn't, and we don't wanna speak for Khail. But people have taken our ""secrecy"" and spun it into something a lot more scandalous than what actually happened. The difference between Khail's departure and IG's departure is different in so many ways. Just know that we consider the IG guys AND Khail as friends and comrades in this crazy industry and want all of them to succeed. And then in 10 years when someone writes a book about Multi-Channel Networks and the rise of YouTube, you'll get all the lame behind the scenes info you want."
InsideGaming,2u73y9,grovergrover,1 point,Sat Jan 31 08:50:01 2015 UTC,Can you post a link to the aforementioned video?

InsideGaming,2u73y9,nolanised,3,Fri Jan 30 22:01:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess there is a difference between being kicked out and going out by yourself. Not that I know what happened with Khail, but seeing how everyone farewells IG and how Khail just vanished overnight it does bring some thoughts that maybe this awesome dude really was kicked out without a warning"
InsideGaming,2u73y9,salamaleikum,2,Fri Jan 30 15:49:01 2015 UTC,"Well, Khail was just one guy. They didn't really have a big farewell thing for Rob Smith or any of the other folks who were integral and left. Inside Gaming is a large group compared to individuals. They lost seven guys at once here, at a company that probably doesn't have many employees to begin with."
InsideGaming,2u73y9,BungieSupreme,2,Fri Jan 30 22:27:47 2015 UTC,"They did however have a day in which, they atleast achknowledged the layoffs and wished there former co-workers luck."

I'm very excited & can't wait to see what they have in store for the future!   If you haven't already, follow the guys on Twitter!   Adam Kovic  Bruce Greene   James Willems   Lawrence Sonntag   Joel Rubin  Sean ""Spoole"" Poole   Matt Peake"
InsideGaming,2u73y9,Tegamal,2,Fri Jan 30 14:32:12 2015 UTC,"Don't know if Khail has been picked up yet by another company, but if he hasn't he should join the IG team. I like to imagine that the team left to start something like Kinda Funny Games like the guys at IGN did. Now if that's true, Khail should totally be on it with them."

I meant to write this sooner but being back at university I became too busy and forgot. Now with Inside Gaming leaving Machinima and everyone is getting emotional I thought now would be a good time to post this.  When I went down to London for the day for the IG meet up the fans made the day for me. I went on the first day of EGX and having been told that the crew would be there both days I was excited to see them. Unfortunately they worked all day so I didn't meet them there, luckily however, I went the day of the fan meet up so could wait around for a couple of hours and see them in the evening.  On the way to the meet up I met a group of really cool lads who helped me and my girlfriend get there, (being from a small town London is still indecipherable to me), which was awesome. Once IG arrived and everyone swarmed them, I was helped by a number of people who put me in front of them so I could get my canvases signed (see above), which was great, you guys are awesome - Thank you. Then when I left there was a couple of guys who helped me find a tube station home, since the one I came from had closed.  You guys, if any of you read this, salvaged a day which would have otherwise been spent queuing hours to play games for a couple of minutes. So big thanks again.  As always, thank you Inside Gaming for all the great content. I have loved watching you guys over the last couple of years. Good luck, I am excited to see what you guys do next."

I remember bright eyed 12 year old me desperately waiting for each episode every week, and it's that point that got me sucked in to all this youtube stuff.   To think that I've been watching the same dude (Adam) for such a huge chunk of my life, and even though he probably doesn't know I exist, he's had the biggest fuckin' impact on who I am, and even the course I'm studying at University (CompSci). Which is pretty weird when you think about it, and something pretty unique to our generation, growing up whilst Youtube evolves.   So of course seeing this chapter of IG come to a close is pretty heart wrenching. But it's not the end, and I think some people are missing that. It's evolution, change happens.

InsideGaming,2u2x7e,cvbk,11,Thu Jan 29 15:58:03 2015 UTC,I have the feeling that there is an agreement in place where they aren't able to release info of what they are doing until they have officially left.  I hope that's the case anyway.
InsideGaming,2u2x7e,checkoutmymixtape,5,Thu Jan 29 19:38:13 2015 UTC,Yeah theyre probably not allowed to use that platform to advertise a new channel/plans because machinima owns it.
InsideGaming,2u2x7e,pingustits,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:12:15 2015 UTC,machinima don't own their twitter accounts. I'm sure cvbk is right.

The amount of sane and logical information, gags, jokes is beyond counting. Thank you for all the years of funny stuff.

InsideGaming,2u2x7e,theboomerporate,3,Fri Jan 30 03:28:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clearing it up, It's a shame they cannot keep the name. I feel sorry for whoever takes over Inside Gaming (If it comes too that which I doubt as I am pretty sure Machinima will just hold the name for the return view count moneys :( ) But if someone did try and take over the role....Christ, Not a chance in squiddly doo of matching those boys talent."
InsideGaming,2u2x7e,TehTacoGuy,5,Thu Jan 29 21:28:42 2015 UTC,It's funny Adam mentions Blaine from Rooster Teeth. I'm a film student at UT so I know a lot people who intern at Rooster Teeth and know people who know him when he was at TSTV. From what I've been told Blaine is a real dick.
InsideGaming,2u2x7e,Montezum,5,Thu Jan 29 21:59:47 2015 UTC,If you read the comments on the latest RT podcast the fan base is really split over him too
InsideGaming,2u2x7e,TehTacoGuy,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:14:26 2015 UTC,You should have listened to Brandon go on about Blaine on the RT podcast during the RT Smite Tournament then.

InsideGaming,2u2x7e,RAKK9595,1 point,Fri Feb 6 02:58:41 2015 UTC,oh man I didn't know HUF is even less worth than PLN... it's crap when you're forced to pay in foreign currency.
InsideGaming,2u2x7e,xgnargnarx,3,Thu Jan 29 18:08:03 2015 UTC,"I started watching IG at the start of 2014, at first quite casually. I then started watching more regularly. Then in October I broke my ankle and had to take 6 weeks off work. I watched IG every day and went back and watched all the older videos.  It helped me get through an otherwise insnaely dull time and instead of feeling sorry for myself, I'd sit and laugh my ass off.  Although I have no doubt you'll be back, it's still difficult not to be really bummed out that this phase has come to an end.  This was a great podcast and it was awesome to hear you sharing your memories of Machinima.  All the best for the future"
InsideGaming,2u2x7e,dj_smu,3,Thu Jan 29 18:31:20 2015 UTC,Why are they leaving? I watched Adam back in the day when he was the Dead Pixel. This really sucks :( I started making videos because of Machinima and now I'm a full time photographer and filmmaker because of them. I'll miss the show. Thanks so much for making me laugh and enjoy gaming :)

InsideGaming,2u2x7e,TrevorSlattery,3,Thu Jan 29 20:30:46 2015 UTC,Everyone who says IG doesn't love their Fans after this Podcast should be ashamed.  You can tell Adam was really sad about saying Goodbye (for now) at the end.
InsideGaming,2u2x7e,stalkerSRB,5,Fri Jan 30 00:11:30 2015 UTC,"Did anybody found easter eggs that Lawrence was talking about?  As for games price in rest of the world: Difference between giving 50 euros for a game and giving 30 euros is a big deal when you live in say Serbia and not in US or UK or Germany, because 20 euros is a lot of money for us. Thats why people buy games on sites like G2play or Go2play or what ever. To put it in prospective how much 20 euros is big in Serbia:: you can buy enough food for 2-3 days or you can buy 2 pair of pants or you can by sneakers that are on sale or 10 packs of cigarettes or drink all night when you go out, etc......."

InsideGaming,2u2x7e,Alwaysfair,2,Thu Jan 29 20:39:13 2015 UTC,"Not sure how much the guys read comments of the subreddit because this is my first time commenting, but the reason games and consoles cost a lot more in Australia is the same reason everything else electronic/digital costs more. It's because enough people pay it. May not be the only reason but it is a major reason, every other reason I can come up with fails for some products/services. And so Itunes keeps selling music at much higher prices for no other obvious reason than they can. Only now is Netflix coming to Australia and already more competitive prices are coming from other new and old subscription services and (slightly better pricing) from our one cable service Foxtel. If we get more competitive pricing for other services and products we'd probably stop being a world leader in illegally downloading content."

InsideGaming,2u2x7e,YodatheHobbit,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:20:12 2015 UTC,"I got Diablo 3: RoS from G2A (€10-15 cheaper, exchange rates are very discouraging for me). The code they sent was scanned from something, either the game box, or some coupon/voucher. So they do get their hands on retail copies, but don't know how it is with their other games, this was the first (and last) thing I got from them.  The pre-order was in such high-demand there that they couldn't send the keys out immediately for those who placed their order kind of late (including me), and as expected, everyone lost their shit over it.  Took them like 2 days max to sort it out, and they sent out some coupons or whatever for those who didn't get their key in time. You could pick like 2 games from maybe 10 for free (not new games of course). Was a nice gesture on their part."
InsideGaming,2u2x7e,REDDIT-IS-TRP,1 point,Fri Jan 30 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"They usually send coupons to people who buy keys without G2AShield. When shit hit the fan with the Far Cry 4 scandal, they gave another key to the people who bought it with G2A Shield, and only gave coupons to those who didn't.   Side note: please stay away from G2A. If you want cheap solutions go on Allkeyshop and compare prices or go to Kinguin."

Even though this sounds stupid, I feel very happy at the fact that I got my very first question that was answered in the (possibly) last Q&A video. I was so honored that my question was chosen, it really did make my whole day better.  Good luck on your future endeavors!

GTA:V would be nuts if it was filled with user generated cars, guns, clothes, missions, game types and building interiors.   There are a million hurdles to overcome but I think they would be design challenges worth taking on if there is this much money in it.  It's also better for everyone than selling shark cards."

It just seems to me you are never going to get everyone to buy DLC so even if the game is $60 and to total of DLC is $80, it would seem that you would still probably make more on the game than the DLC.  Unless people are buying DLC for games they don't own."
InsideGaming,2u0noj,Kage_Oni,2,Wed Jan 28 23:51:29 2015 UTC,A lot of DLCs never go on sale like the games do
InsideGaming,2u0noj,Montezum,2,Thu Jan 29 00:59:53 2015 UTC,"you have to think about profit vs cost.  the game sells for $60, but in many cases the money people pay for the base game barely covers what it cost to actually develop the game.  some AAA games can cost $200 million+ and take 5 or 6 years to develop, all of that spent before the dev/publisher sees a dime of profit, or knows how well the game will sell.  DLC is faster and easier to make usually, because the game engine and mechanics are already made, so DLC is juist content added on, it still costs money to make but comparatively it costs very little, and so the profit on DLC is much higher.  the fact is, games have never been cheaper, $60 for a game is the same as it was even 20 years ago, so due to inflation, we're actually paying almost half for a game than we used to. the market is stuck on that pricepoint, players flip out when anyhting goes higher.  so DLC is the only way for developers to make the profit they need to make, look at EA's financials, without DLC, they would be in the red, the same goes for most publishers/developers today.  unless yoiu want to pay a lot more up front for a game, DLC is the way of the future, and people should be glad for that, because you can choose to buy DLC or not, its kind of like tipping, if you enjoy the game, you're willing to shell out some extra money for DLC, if the game was just ok, you can leave it at the base price. this is good for everyone.  now dont get me wrong there are lots of bad DLC practices, and even some devs have cut out content to sell as DLC, though thats much more rare than people accuse them of. but thats life, there are always people who are going to do things a bad way. DLC overall however is a good thing."

Treat Adam to a big ol' steak dinner, and don't yell at James when he drags his ass across the carpet. Then, just run your fingers through Joel's hair before the vet comes in the room, and tell him you love him."

InsideGaming,2tx0fn,errolh,92,Wed Jan 28 10:30:38 2015 UTC,"I wish i could have started watching sooner. these people are amazing. It got to the point where i am watching for the people, not the content"
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,TheFaultinOurTards,23,Wed Jan 28 02:57:20 2015 UTC,Don't worry! They said they're sticking together so i'm sure we'll see them again sometime soon!
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,I-DragonBorn,12,Wed Jan 28 03:47:48 2015 UTC,"I know, and I am happy about that. But I know that it won't be the same"
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,TheFaultinOurTards,30,Wed Jan 28 03:50:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think the quality of the content will change, even though they joke around they are committed to, and love making amazing videos for us. I have faith that they will continue to do what they do best, even if it's under new circumstances! I believe in the Kovic"
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,I-DragonBorn,13,Wed Jan 28 03:57:57 2015 UTC,"Whatever comes next, I will follow faithfully because I know it will be amazing with that kind of team they have"
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,TheFaultinOurTards,7,Wed Jan 28 04:11:04 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't it be the same? If anything it'll be better because they'll be adding like 3 people to the main crew, and they will be sticking together. And I'd they felt the need to move than that means they weren't happy at Machinima, so I'd assume wherever they go from here they'll be happier."

These guys motivated me to start animating and pretty much delivered so many laughs in the past that it's though and sad to see them go.  I hope they come back soon to youtube.   Maybe under normalboots or some gaming related network?"
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,Macciffer,53,Wed Jan 28 02:31:25 2015 UTC,"RT theories are floating around , its unlikely but i would die form happiness"
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,DrButty,35,Wed Jan 28 02:42:05 2015 UTC,"As someone visiting from the RT Subreddit, I do agree it seems both fanbases want this to happen and they both have great rapport with one another so I don't think many would be against it.   That being said, they could go fully independent like Kinda Funny did when they left IGN."
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,OfficialGarwood,22,Wed Jan 28 03:59:27 2015 UTC,I think the fully independent theory is most likely.
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,markrar,12,Wed Jan 28 07:23:12 2015 UTC,I'm more hopeful for this one. RT has waaaay too many people already
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,Montezum,6,Wed Jan 28 11:58:29 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm put off RT now by just how many members they have. Half of them don't match the same comedic style either :/
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,PM-ME-EBOLA,6,Wed Jan 28 14:56:31 2015 UTC,"I think people are being overzealous.   As much as the relationship between RT and IG is great, unless they are able to pull some serious Fullscreen money, and heavily invest in their news department, they would have to hire 7 new people.  Now you could say that they don't need to hire all 7, but I think by dissecting ""IG"", it would kill part of their magic."
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,Black_Nerd,10,Wed Jan 28 12:39:56 2015 UTC,Does RT stand for Rooster Teeth? I'm not too familiar with them but that'd be great news. Them continuing their amazing work together would really be...fantastic :D
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,Macciffer,29,Wed Jan 28 03:01:30 2015 UTC,It also stands for Russian Television.

InsideGaming,2tx0fn,Jadesauron,5,Wed Jan 28 16:09:57 2015 UTC,Yes it does :)  But much like the majority of the fanbase i'm starting to think IG would be better doing their own thing.

InsideGaming,2tx0fn,unproperNoun,3,Wed Jan 28 06:21:20 2015 UTC,"Indeed and if they were hired it would probably be to ""The Know"" and i don't think that show alone can pay for seven more people :/"
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,DrButty,3,Wed Jan 28 09:52:45 2015 UTC,"The improvement in viewership from ""The Know"" and + 4-5 IG videos a week Miiiight just be enough to even it out tho.  I'll remain doubtfully hopeful.  God it would be awesome"

InsideGaming,2tx0fn,Oldboy84,26,Wed Jan 28 05:29:18 2015 UTC,"Inside gaming reminded me why I love video games - because they're fun. Even if they suck ass, you can always find a reason to enjoy them.   I will follow these guys to the ends of the Earth, they really helped me out a lot and reminded me to take it easy and play games! Bruce, Adam, James, Joel, Lawrence, Spoole: Thank you so much for making my fiancee and I laugh our asses off everyday. We will support you guys forever!"
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,SadSadNotGood,7,Wed Jan 28 04:29:29 2015 UTC,"Same here.  They got me back into gaming. I had stopped for a few years and after watching them for a few weeks I rediscovered why I love gaming.  They reminded me of the days of sitting on the couch with my old friends, making fun of the games we were playing and laughing our asses off.  My friends and I all went our separate ways years ago but watching the IG videos made me remember what it felt like."

InsideGaming,2tx0fn,MagicalMonkey100,6,Wed Jan 28 10:51:58 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll hire a new guy for that. Maybe it will be a Mark.  Mark's Picks! It's just not the same....

I just have minimal knowledge of these guys and would love if someone can feed me some insight!"
InsideGaming,2tx0fn,SeaKyuSee,2,Wed Jan 28 02:47:04 2015 UTC,"Well worth going through their backlogs on both the Machinima and InsideGaming YouTube channels. Perfect balance of entertainment and good insight. About half of what they do is kind of a Mystery Science Theatre 3000-style gameplay, where they play rubbish games and make fun of them. The other half is still entertaining but more of a frank deconstruction of gaming news, trends etc. Those are definitely not no-nonsense, just nonsense in all the right places.   Good starting points: Sin Episodes: Emergence series, Chaser series, Sims 3 series, their podcasts. All those are on the InsideGaming channel, check out the playlists tab and start from the beginning!  They've been under Machinima for years but have operated fairly autonomously, now they're heading out on their own to do... something we don't know yet. It's exciting times."

InsideGaming,2twwue,ZedHeadFred,5,Fri Jan 30 02:15:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah! It's called JETPAK.   It was just started late last year because Nanners and others were tired of smaller channels getting fucked over by big dogs like Machinima and other ""too-big"" networks.  Unlike Machinima, JETPAK is much more hands-off when it comes to channels under their banner. Whereas Machinima requires you to produce content within a specific limitation (""you can only make halo/minecraft/CoD videos or related news""), Nanners' network doesn't care about that, they just offer MCN services.  They also don't take like half of your money, unlike Machinima. Youtube already takes 40% of your revenue earnings and Machinima takes 45% of the remainder. Jetpak isn't taking shit.  I like Nanners' prior work, and I think he's doing a good thing. I don't even produce content, I just hate seeing good personalities getting fucked over by Machinima. Bro Team practically had to break the Youtube TOS to get the fuck out of their clutches."

InsideGaming,2twwue,EvilBernard,45,Wed Jan 28 07:53:17 2015 UTC,"Don't be my Barzia, IG.  Let me tell you a story... Years ago, when I were just a wee 20 something lad, I frequented a Pub, named Barzia. This was unlike any other I had been to in my life... Spacious, clean, cheap, good beer, Pool Table and Football on the telly. I loved this place, it was my getaway with my friends after a hard day sellin PS2 games to the masses. It was like my 'Cheers' but with unwashed dribbling buffoons replacing the cast. Each day we would be greeted with a friendly heartfelt 'Hello' and gently and lovingly shoved from the premise at closing time.  So much were we regulars, that when they invested in a new pool table we were given exclusive day one access to test. It was shit. But that's what you get for sticking Baize to slate with velcro, but I digress... So one day upon purchasing 4 pints, i was stunned to be charged 50p a pint... 'Why?' I asked. 'Closing down' he said. Tears began to form... 'Only for a refurb' he hastily added. 'We'll be back better than ever'...  Everyday after, I walked past the closed pub hoping that day would be the day. Months later it was boarded up as the work started, excitement grew... it reopen as a Steak House... a fucking Steak House...  Don't be my Barzia, IG. Please. Come back, don't change."

Every single day for at least the last year, I've come home from work and gone straight to the IG channel. Every single day you motherfuckers have put out good content that has given me hours of laughs.    Unlike many others here, I don't remember when I first found you guys or what video popped my IG cherry, but I do know that whatever the fuck it was, it got me hooked for good. With other YouTube channels I have watched daily, after a short period of time, I have gotten tired of the content or humor. This is not the case with you guys. I love every god damn video. I can't get enough. The fucking ""Death Orgy"" video you guys did in GTA recently had me laughing for the entire 11 or 13 minutes. Holy fuck.    Now on to brass tacks. As everybody here probably knows by now, you're leaving Machinima but staying together as a crew. The important part is that you are gonna be staying together. I don't know if it's just the alcohol in my system, but when I watched the IG Daily for today where you guys announced that you're leaving Machinima, I could see Adam's emotions showing through his cold, dead, bitchy resting face. I know this can't be an easy decision for you guys, but I know wherever you end up will be just as fantastic and truly glorious as your current empire of videos. Whatever you guys end up doing, I'll be there watching and being happy with whatever the fuck you guys are putting out.    I'll be making a twitter account just to see what you guys are doing and, as always, religiously checking this subreddit. I wish you guys the best of luck, and can't wait to see what's next for you guys."

I stopped watching when they fired Matt Dannevik. It's nice to hear they are leaving and doing something new. I hope the best for them in whatever it is they do. They did a great job entertaining a lonely 14 year old for hours on end. Watching Inside Halo (Gaming), RVB, and, The Master's Challenge got me through tough times as a kid and interested in creating films. These guys are part of the reason I am in film school today. And now I can't wait to see what they will do next. Personally I believe they need to see what the Quazars are up too and try to get them back on."

I am one of those ""Chinese rebel fighters"" you mentioned in one of your IGD last year. I can't stress enough how hard it is to enjoy your gorgeous content back in my old country (and it's even harder now since the government decided to ban the ""unregistered use"" of VPN). I can't actually remember when did I subscribed to your channel, but by watching your beautiful contents, I was able to survive those boring days when the smiling face on my TV threatens to make me disappear while I really don't give a shit about. Thank you again for bringing laughter in my life, and I simply can't imagine the life without Inside Gaming or ETC or VanossGaming or Lui Caliber or whatever. But seriously, I love you guys, and I hope you guys have a brighter future of dick jokes and endless creativity."

I've never seen a community so strong and passionate then the Inside Gaming community, and it was all because of Adam, Bruce, James, Joel, Lawrence, Spoole and Matt that this strong community was born. We as a community have been by their side through thick and thin and with this sudden announcement we will strongly support them through it all and give them a bright and hopeful future.   Meeting them all at EGX was such a big moment for me as they an important part of my life right now and I will follow them into this future they plan for themselves.   Thank You Adam, Bruce, James, Joel, Lawrence, Spoole and Matt for everything and I hope your future is hopeful, bright, wonderful and full of content that will keep us all entertained in a timeless manner.

It had great content, Repawn was excellent, IG was coming up and ETC is beginning to make moves. Now ETC is all they have left. Sadly for them many of their viewership might be lost. All Machinima had to do was keep Sark, Nanners, Hutch, Hollywood, Adam, Bruce, James, Laurence, Joel, Spoole, Matt & Khail. The fuck ups at Machinima done goofed for the final time. Personalities were key. Probably the only aspect Machinima had going for them. Now, it's fucking dead. I know Broteam was supposed to join the IGD boiiiiis but Machinma made quick fucking work of that. It's safe to say Machinima is dead. But IGD will hopefully live on. It must, these guys truly are great people. They have a special talent, they make people laugh/smile through a screen by reporting shit. If that isn't a priceless commodity I don't know what it. I can truly say, the light has gone out of my life. Hopefully for all of us, it's momentarily. We love you Inside Gaming, and I'll follow you to the gates of hell if it must come to it just to see you guys succeed."

InsideGaming,2twwue,Black_Nerd,4,Thu Jan 29 20:15:53 2015 UTC,Greetings from Germany (please don't shoot my balls)  i'm a big fan of the inside gaming crew and to hear that machinma cancelled the best channel on YT is sad but they said that they will come back and i know there will become much better.  in Germany happens something similar with a gaming broadcast called gameone. The show was cancelled in 23 december 2014 after 300 episodes and 8 years on air. this was a big thing in the gaming scene in Germany.   The guys from that show started on the 15.01.2015 a 24/7 twitch channel about games and other stuff called RocketbeansTV and it is at the moment complete crowd funded.  maybe that's a directon that the inside gaming crew can go. (just a idea)  sorry for my bad english

I see Joel leaving having a pretty big impact on Machinima, and he will be hard to replace. If the IG views can support, what, 6 people? We shall see. Best of luck of course, I'll be there all the way. Need any animation shit, I've got some free time coming up so hit me up!"
InsideGaming,2twwue,dicksnaxs,4,Wed Jan 28 02:03:34 2015 UTC,You have to keep in mind that Joel knows the ins and outs of running a youtube channel/business side of things. They'll get it done. They've been planning this for a while.
InsideGaming,2twwue,PM-ME-EBOLA,5,Wed Jan 28 07:02:22 2015 UTC,"Oh I don't doubt Joel's ability whatsoever. But the hardest part is bringing over the audience they've worked so hard to build, with nearly 700k IG subs."

InsideGaming,2twwue,Stratzee,3,Wed Jan 28 03:59:59 2015 UTC,"THIS DEFINITELY SHOULD BE A PLOT TO A CHEESY MEDIUM BUDGET MOVIE  Movie begins with Adam, Bruce, James and Joel climbing up the YouTube ranks with blazing fury. Becoming more and more well known. Until, they get heartbreaking news. They have been cancelled. They announce their retirement from Machinima and they all move on with their lives. James becomes a somewhat pro wrestler and reads poetry in empty bars. Bruce has a job at IGN where he is constantly pissed with the job they are doing. Lawrence has a big IT job and is being paid 6 figures but misses playing games all day with his friends. Joel plays WoW all day and tries to be an online salesman for Bitcoin. Spoole probably just 420 blazes it all day... And then there's Adam. He still has the fire in his heart. Although he has become a raging alcoholic, he wants to get the crew back together! He approaches every member and slowly reunites them, LIKE THE AVENGERS! They make a new channel called the Joel Hole and after a few years, surpass Machinima in subscribers and YOUTUBE ranks. They are a success! But there is still one loose end, they call Khail up on the phone. Stuck at Cnet and is asked if he wants to be featured on the movie and entertainment side of the show. He rejects it and hangs up immediately, leaving Joel Hole in confusion. Khail looks up at the camera, and says ""I'm going to get my revenge on them. For what they did to me."" (HINTING AT SEQUEL THAT WILL NEVER BE MADE)"

I believe Adam has a fair amount of shares in Machinima so I guess if he sold that he could get some finances too help future IG/?? Growth, But I think their future could rely on us the fans.

InsideGaming,2ty2rk,deceasedVector,17,Wed Jan 28 22:08:55 2015 UTC,I can't be the only one who thinks that joining roosterteeth would be a terrible idea.
InsideGaming,2ty2rk,Montezum,12,Wed Jan 28 11:48:33 2015 UTC,"Right there with you. I'd like to think they could form their own group and be fine by themselves, but I would say it would be hard to pull of considering they have been with machinima for so long and not needed to depend on views for their lively hood."
InsideGaming,2ty2rk,TalonFORCE,4,Wed Jan 28 12:22:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I don't really know who rooster teeth are but I think I'd rather just see the IG team stay how it is now in the future."
InsideGaming,2ty2rk,Takanori00,2,Wed Jan 28 18:43:02 2015 UTC,"If they do join Roosterteeth/The Know, more than likely IG will get there own office area like when they were at Machinima and they'd still make all the GTA and Steam Roulette videos they usually make, but they'd every once in awhile do something with Achievement Hunter or Roosterteeth. In other words the only side effect I can see is some extra content in the collaborations. Also joining Riosterteeth will open up a lot of doors such as not needing a kickstarter every time they wanna go to an event and broadening the audience/exposure of the group. But that's all my opinion and you of course are entitled to yours."
InsideGaming,2ty2rk,BDGJunior,4,Fri Jan 30 20:07:40 2015 UTC,"If IG really does join Rooster Teeth, I really hope they don't adopt RT's subscription model. I completely understand they need to make money and I have no problem with that. I can refrain from using adblock. I can donate when I can. But as a college student with no income, I can't afford the monthly subscription model, and I'm sure I'm not the only one in this position.  I loved RT when they first started out, but when they began uploading subscriber-only videos, I felt like a second-class fan. The users in the forums began alienating non-subscribers and to this day I feel like the RT community isn't what it could be.  After RTX 2014, RT deleted their twitch stream of the event, went after anyone who uploaded parts of it to youtube, and made the panels viewable only to subscribers. This is not how you treat the fans of your guests at a con. No other convention operates this way and I found the practice extremely disagreeable.   I don't want to see the IG community fractured like Rooster Teeth's. So please, if anyone at IG is reading this, I hope you will at least consider different revenue options when the time comes."
InsideGaming,2ty2rk,Tirrinz,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:22:35 2015 UTC,"Where'd you get that info about RTX? I remember that the Twitch archive was taken down at some point but most Youtube videos of the various panels are still up(including ones uploaded during or right after RTX) and even if all videos had been taken down at the very least it wasn't to provide it to sponsors only, since the RTX streams were never uploaded to Roosterteeth's site as far as I can tell (except for the Cards against Humanity & Quick Draw streams which are admittedly sponsor only videos but hardly to the extent you've suggested)."
InsideGaming,2ty2rk,dben10,1 point,Wed Jan 28 21:40:51 2015 UTC,"This is actually quite simple. Look at the dates of the majority of panels that are still on youtube. Notice that the majority of dates are very recent. Take this Starbomb panel for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGo7ocujL20   Do you think the uploader waited 4 months to upload the video? No, it is a reupload of the original from another user that was taken down. This is a common trend among rtx videos. Some panels are still missing that you cannot find anymore such as the animator's panel.   And my info is from first hand experience and members of the rooster teeth community. After RTX 2014, several reddit posts went up compliling a list of youtube videos featuring the various panels. One by one, each of the videos either became private or were removed from youtube. You would have a hard time convincing me or anyone else this was coincidental when videos from over a dozen different youtube users were involved."
InsideGaming,2ty2rk,Tirrinz,1 point,Sat Jan 31 00:51:27 2015 UTC,"Thats my problem though its just not true, this is the primary link compilation thread posted on the RT subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/29zxlq/rtx_panel_links/  If you'll notice the vast majority of the links are not only active but from the day of or a few days after RTX itself. And like I said even if every single link was down your main point was that Roosterteeth did it so they could make it into sponsor exclusive content which doesn't really hold up when the only RTX videos uploaded as sponsor content were Cards Against Humanity and Quick Draw."
InsideGaming,2ty2rk,dben10,4,Mon Feb 2 17:11:58 2015 UTC,Rooster teeth did say in a press announcement when they were bought by screen play that they were setting up a LA office...it would make sense

InsideGaming,2ty2rk,ScruffTheJanitor,2,Wed Jan 28 15:06:31 2015 UTC,"I like Rooster Teeth, but I don't feel like IG would be the same if they joined. More than likely, they would be thrown into the various shows that they have, such as The Patch, Screen Cast, On The Spot, etc.   People say that Achievement Hunter and IG would be a perfect combination, but I feel like it would ruin the chemistry that IG has in their videos. They are just fine as they are.  Of course, that's just my opinion. They should do what they feel is best for them."

InsideGaming,2ty2rk,xbone_zone,3,Wed Jan 28 22:08:26 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. If they are setting up an LA office, just have IG keep doing what they do in a new spot. Start a Daily segment on The Know for the guys and a new channel for their gameplay stuff. People seem to think merging is the only way this could go, but a satellite office would be ideal. In my opinion."

InsideGaming,2u0ce8,Aroused-dentist,2,Wed Jan 28 21:50:48 2015 UTC,they work best as they are and they already have a massive dedicated fan base. Rooster teeth is already to large and adding IG wouldn't help.
InsideGaming,2u0ce8,Stratzee,1 point,Wed Jan 28 23:10:13 2015 UTC,"What it sounds like to me is that RT wouldn't benefit as much from gaining IG as much as IG would from merging with RT. While I can agree with this statement, I do think there is some leeway for how RT could benefit from this. For example, the Know (which the post I linked refers to) needs something to spark its popularity. It does offer some good news, albeit just a rehash of the front page of reddit, but it doesn't necessarily have any flair to it. The people behind it are clearly reading teleprompters and that's about it, and while IG do read a pre written script, they add value beyond that which the Know just can't offer in comparison. I'm behind them with whatever they choose to do, but I do think working with RT in any way, shape, or form could really benefit both sides of the board."
InsideGaming,2u0ce8,Leaf_on-the_Wind,0,Thu Jan 29 00:12:10 2015 UTC,"If you go on Adam's Reddit profile he has been relatively active on the Rooster Teeth sub-reddit. He has been talking a fair amount about his plans for the group and it might have to do with RT. Now I don't know if this is what is happening (obviously), however I do agree with you and think that it could mess up what they already have. I love RT as well as IG, however merging the two permanently doesn't seem like a great solution. Who knows though, whatever they do I support them."

Thus I just didn't and focused on other stuff in my life. But after watching one of your steam roulette videos I was blown away, I had a creative flow and immediately started to think about ways to put the stories you told into a moved scenario. Then the first IG animated videos came out and I knew that this was the best way to put you guys into weird situations. However, I never animated before. I had no experience at all. But because you guys kept pushing out so many hilarious videos I was motivated to learn, to go on, to evovle. I may not be the best animator but the motivation I got from your videos helped me create an outlet for my wish to create media and art. This may sound highly melodramatic to you for sure but this is how I feel.  Reading about you leaving machinima left me in some kind of shock and I hope that you guys move on the new things, create new things and inspire more people. You changed my life for the better.   You guys are simply inspirational, I love your humor and your fairly staight ahead way of telling opinions. Honesty in gaming related media is rare and very appreciated.  It's sad to see you guys leave youtube for a while and I doubt that machinima will ever be able to replace you.   I love you guys, ALL of you"

That being said, I do think that the Inside Gaming crew sort of saw this coming. If you listened to the podcast they would throw around ideas about what would happen if they left, and so to finally have it come to fruition was probably a relief.   And to be out of a company that had its fair share of trials and drama is also probably nice. And that is a reason to be happy."

InsideGaming,2two4f,Tirax,2,Thu Jan 29 00:31:35 2015 UTC,"There has been issues in the past with the content creators and the contracts. BroTeamPill and Ross Scott (who created Freeman's mind) both had very public disgruntlement about contracts.   Also the cast of people at Machinima is constantly rotating, which I imagine has to be stressful for people who work there. People are laid off and stuff like that. Matt Dannevik and Khail are obvious examples.   But who knows what it was like to work there really. This is all just speculation by people who watch Youtube videos."
InsideGaming,2two4f,CaptainPajamaPants,6,Thu Jan 29 19:37:48 2015 UTC,I think the people that always talk about how sad they think Adam is need to like go outside or something. I think you're reading into something that isn't really there.

InsideGaming,2trpgy,Drdres,1 point,Tue Jan 27 04:44:40 2015 UTC,"I agree that Ubisoft should have said why, but that's it. You can't expect them to give you money for being stupid. G2A and G2play are famously shady sites and a quick google search will let you know that. I mean, there is a fucking insurance option, surely that would give it away.  And to Ubi's credit, they only removed the game. Steam would have banned your account."
InsideGaming,2trpgy,lPTGl,1 point,Tue Jan 27 11:43:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you up until your last bit. This has happened many times on steam and steam simply removes the games from your account, just as Ubisoft has."

InsideGaming,2trpgy,jokinghazard,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:31:14 2015 UTC,"Partially because of the rough year with Watch Dogs not living up to hype, some rough PC Ports and of course AC: Unity. I also think it's because EA didn't really release much this year.  Apart from their usual bunch of sports games, what else did they release this year? Sims 4 is all I can think of, and it's not bad. It has it's very silly problems, but it's actually playable and I can run the game well even on my older laptop.  Basically, Ubisoft had a pretty bad year in terms of AAA titles, while EA didn't really put out anything that generated any controversy."
InsideGaming,2trpgy,Kage_Oni,1 point,Tue Jan 27 10:10:02 2015 UTC,I feel like it happened over night.   And what is disappointing is that they have all the games I have been looking forward too.  If they can get through 2015 with out bombing The Division and Rainbow Six: Siege (if they both come out this year) I'll call it a win.
InsideGaming,2trpgy,stalkerSRB,-1,Mon Jan 26 23:53:15 2015 UTC,"It didn't happen over night, I urge you to go and see Jimquisition from Jim Sterling, that man really calls them out...Rayman is still good tho :D  Edit: I will just go on my Ubisoft rant here (cuz I want to) Ubisoft has been worse then EA for a LOOOOONG time, but they are smaller then EA, so nobody notices that much when they fuck up. DRM - They are the worst! (yes, even worse then EA)."" You want to play Assassins Creed 2""- you have to be online."" Oh you lost connection, start the game over""... Irony, they started using that bullshit to stop pirating of Assassins Creed on PC, yet because of DRM, AC2 was more pirated, because it worked better and easier. AND THEN they had the balls to call it A SUCCESS! So their logic dictates-""We need our own service! That will use DRM and be worse then Origin!"" . Then comes U-play, that nobody wants, nobody likes and they say- ""Our costumers like our service"". Then they go: ""We will focus on our PC version of the game"". Game comes out 6 month after consoles, graphics are slightly better then console versions, optimized like shit and ofc U-play up your ass hole. AND THEN WE CAME TO THE YEAR OF WONDER....2014. My god, they managed to fuck up everything. The Crew was boring as shit, Watch Dogs was just MEH but because they showed the game with amazing graphics that they had to downgrade for the consoles it is considered SHIT by most people and was optimized by a brain dead JoWood. Assassins Creed Unity - Broken like an Early access game, optimized by JoWoods dead dog that fell on a keyboard when it died of starvation, game is much more boring then AC:Black Flag, they managed to fuck up the game even more by patching it AND it is a 60$ game that has MICRO TRANSACTIONS even tho the game doesn't need it what so ever. Ubisoft has lost it shit, they are not living in reality anymore. They are like Joel Schumacher in Batman franchise - they have no idea what the hell they are doing or saying. Case in point: ""We won't make new games, unless we can make a franchise"" - Which means we will get a new Watch Dogs even tho, we can probably safely say, only Phil wants it so he can see T-bone again....or my favorite example: ""Aiden Pearces hat is iconic"" Even tho the game has been out for less then a year, his hat is ICONIC like Links outfit, Marios mustache, Pikachus voice and Bruce Greens farts...Jesus Fucking Christ. They are acting like they are a Japanese company: ""We will do this even tho its total crap and we dont give a shit what you think"", until they end up like Capcom - a company for re-releases and making deals with Sony to make Street Fighter V (one of the biggest fighting franchises ever) and ofc stop releasing you biggest game from the '80s and '90s that would probably make you 100000000 billion because everybody want another one because you are just that ignorant....Rayman is still good tho"

I'm fully aware that they're not going to waste half-an-hour trying to understand a game or play it until ""it gets to the good part"", because they do it all in one hour streams, so things gotta be quick; therefore, this sort of ""rush"" added to their satirical style (AND the fact that Kovic seems to be the perfect beta tester, always finding bugs in any game) IMO makes the whole ""God, this game is boring/sucks, let's go let's go spin the wheel!"" completely understandable."

I also think that the Dying Light review will be up there as well but not enough to get the award. For myself I am unsure about the game but the more I see it, it makes me curious to buy it. Hopefully it turns out well. I also agree with Battlefield Hardline. I saw some gameplay for it and it looks very similar to Payday and GTA. I feel like that game is to overhyped and will not deliver as people are thinking it will be. I would also include Uncharted 4 in the list as well with Star Wars and The Division. Naughty Dog will announce that they are going to delay the game in the next few months (before E3) and will release it in 2016."

InsideGaming,2tm3to,Eclairattack,13,Sun Jan 25 15:35:59 2015 UTC,"I mean he is right they are kinda shit, the fact that developers can get away with releasing a purposely incomplete product is a bit rubbish."
InsideGaming,2tm3to,BoomerDoomer,-5,Sun Jan 25 15:48:44 2015 UTC,"Except for the purpose is to have a large group of beta testers to tell them what needs fixing.  If I see a project I would like to support, what better way to do that than give them money and help them solve issues with the game?"
InsideGaming,2tm3to,Eclairattack,6,Sun Jan 25 17:25:13 2015 UTC,"You should not have to pay to beta test, you are helping them! More importantly once you've paid them they are under no obligation to continue working on it. Moreover, if you see a project you want to support I can buy that angle however there are already multiple analogous games on the market like H1Z1. This genre is saturated and doesn't need more shitty alphas purely designed to make money fast."
InsideGaming,2tm3to,BoomerDoomer,-1,Sun Jan 25 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"I am aware that they can ditch the project if they want, and that this genre is filled top the brim with crap, and that early access overall is pretty shit. I just don't think people should be harassed for supporting things they want to, because it's their money and their decision. Sure, it brings to market more early access zombie games and what have you, but if you have a problem with early access zombie games, just don't pay attention to them, and don't harass your pals who want to buy them.  DayZ was the only other project I've gotten early access to, so believe me when I say I was wary of this game. However, I believe it has great potential coming from the makers of Planetside 2 and Everquest.   And while beta testers are usually the ones getting paid, the point is that only those who really want to help fix it pay to get in early, but people don't learn and so they buy another early access game expecting it to be amazing and then rant on the internet about how shit it is.  I'm not sure how coherent this reply is, but I'm just saying that I think SOE can pull this off, and that's my reasoning behind paying to support a free game, along with reporting bugs. That's what early access is for."
InsideGaming,2tm3to,Eclairattack,1 point,Sun Jan 25 18:52:31 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to harass anyone but merely pointing out the many major flaws in the current system, you can't just not pay attention when someone releases a very broken game and makes a profit from it, regardless of whether they have a good track record. From there on out it lowers the standards to which developers and more importantly publishers will adhere to. At the end of the day we live in a capitalist world if David the developer notices everyone making a quick buck from these games the trend will become perpetuated and that is not a good thing. What I'm trying to say is I'm worried by the potential decline in game quality being affected. In the end nothing may happen and to certain degree we probably agree on most things surrounding this topic I'm just annoyed at what these games represent is all."

InsideGaming,2tm3to,IGAdam,5,Sun Jan 25 17:43:05 2015 UTC,"pay 2 win airdrops.    From what I watch they are more like ""pay to get screwed over by RNG cuz the dev wants your money"". Why would you pay money just to wait 10 mins for a package to land that contains a horde of zombies while other players rush to get it before you? Then you have to fight off all these things only to get shafted by the package and get 2 pieces of wood? Is that really pay 2 win? I think these alpha online zombie games are as broken and stupid as the next guy but this is not even close to pay 2 win like I've seen in other games where you just pay money and are guaranteed a god gun."
InsideGaming,2tm3to,Imkoolaids,1 point,Sun Jan 25 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"Are the drops the only way to get decent weapons? I mean, there's a lot of cheek to a have that people are defending as ""it's an alpha!"" to have something like this and stuff like crates that need keys when other basic things are broken. This really feels like an attempt at pay to win before they even get the concept working in game.. which feels even worse somehow."
InsideGaming,2tm3to,PleaseUseSarcasm,-5,Sun Jan 25 19:55:59 2015 UTC,Let's just say that Adam is not really the best player at this game and other people will get the airdrops easier.
InsideGaming,2tm3to,Imkoolaids,7,Sun Jan 25 22:31:12 2015 UTC,"My ability to play this game has little to do with what's randomly but into a $5 box. But hey, feel free to keep up the helpful attitude."
InsideGaming,2tm3to,eQUIV,1 point,Mon Jan 26 01:35:33 2015 UTC,"Hey Adam, since you are kinda responding with an opinion on this whole airdrop thing. Do you think these airdrops are really ""pay to win""? As I pointed out in my original comment, I feel like this is not a guaranteed pay to win like other games where you pay and are guaranteed a god gun. It seems like a very limited pay to win mechanic. I just don't think this is very influential on the game from what I have seen. Although I'll admit I haven't played the game and am not very knowledgeable on the subject, just wondering your opinion."
InsideGaming,2tm3to,Spooleo,0,Mon Jan 26 04:10:03 2015 UTC,"You called in a Lone Wolf pack, I'm guessing, while you were running around with zombies chasing you, those people went into the crate and took;   Pistol 1x Ammo.45 14x Logs 2x Wolf Sandwich 1x Animal Trap 1x Deer Bladder 2x 7 Zombies   And just left the Logs."
InsideGaming,2tm3to,Imkoolaids,1 point,Mon Jan 26 03:53:27 2015 UTC,So the packages aren't random? You can order a drop that you already know what's in it? Well that makes a stronger case for pay to win. I thought it was completely random.
InsideGaming,2tm3to,Montezum,1 point,Mon Jan 26 04:13:25 2015 UTC,"No, they have preset ""bundles"" for the airdrops. The user CAN NOT select which airdrop bundle you get. The airdrop is completely random."
InsideGaming,2tm3to,Imkoolaids,1 point,Mon Jan 26 12:30:07 2015 UTC,That's what my guess was. Those guys took the other stuff.
InsideGaming,2tm3to,dat_username_tho,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:15:39 2015 UTC,Well this makes more sense now. I couldn't see many people buying airdrops if the drop could possibly only contain just two pieces of wood. This random bundle thing makes sense. Atleast as far as the dev making money from people buying drops is concerned.
InsideGaming,2tm3to,keyshow23,-1,Mon Jan 26 18:35:35 2015 UTC,"What I meant to say is that you'll never be as good in it by playing for one hour than the other people that only play this all the time. They'll know how the zombies work, how the airdrops work, the guns and etc and you won't in one hour, so saying that the airdrops aren't pay to win only using your gameplay as example isn't a fair comparison."
InsideGaming,2tm3to,maooi,0,Mon Jan 26 03:39:31 2015 UTC,"True but that doesn't eliminate the fact that it still is completely random and has a probability that you might not even get the wooden logs. I just don't see the big deal. There are tons of free to play (and non ftp) games with options to actually buy weapons or other stuff that are clearly OP. The H1Z1 devs could easily have said ""you want an ak47 and unlimited ammo? That'll be 20 bucks"". This current system seems like a very limited pay to win mechanic. Like I said I'm not a fan of these games (especially the practice of charging for alphas) but I don't get all the hate on these airdrops. Maybe it's just because I haven't played the game."
InsideGaming,2tm3to,UkrainianBorn,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:07:05 2015 UTC,"So, I'm pretty sure the reason they only got wood was because those other players stole their shit while Adam was running around."

InsideGaming,2to6nn,ConnerJay,12,Mon Jan 26 00:56:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for watching and listening! I'll try to briefly address a couple of the points you made about calorie intake.   your statement regarding health being as simple as ""calories in vs calories out"" is not quite correct   I believe I actually applied this credence to weight-loss, not health. If I recall, I stated that you can eat one hamburger a day and lose weight, though I wouldn't recommend it in terms of health.    I wanted to challenge you to reassess that notion   I'm not a licensed nutritionist, I am, at best, well-read on the topic of exercise and nutrition and my whole life has been an experiment with numerous schools of thought. I agree that nothing is as simple as ""calorie in vs calorie out"" because calorie is a term applied generally to food products and doesn't factor in the human bodies ability to utilize said calorie from Food A versus Food B. That being said if I were to recommend to someone that they should ""life weights"" would you ask me to reassess that notion, because of its general phrasing. Certain lifts with certain weights for certain individuals can be more or less effective depending on the aforementioned criteria, but I'd argue that it's good general starting point that make the advice not only digestible, but attainable.  I think it's important to remember that our conversation was framed as ""for those of you that want to start, but don't know how or think you can't."" If you make losing weight seem more complicated than it really is, you're likely to convince a lot more people not to even attempt it. That's my belief and has been my experience, at least.   You guys are always very concerned with rooting your statements in fact (or least making them clear they are opinions beforehand)   I think the opposite is actually true. Everything we say is the opinion of our group or the individual speaking, unless we state explicitly that something is a fact.  For the record, I don't disagree with your thoughts on food quality. But I think leading a discussion on fitness and health with statements that in some ways take the responsibility out of the hands of the individual will be less effective for that individual a majority of the time."
InsideGaming,2to6nn,JustRiggz,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"Hey James,  Thanks for the response and clarification.   I believe I actually applied this credence to weight-loss, not health. If I recall, I stated that you can eat one hamburger a day and lose weight, though I wouldn't recommend it in terms of health.   I agree that there is a common misconception regarding what is health and how ""healthy"" people eat. I had a burger and pizza last week and I believe people align me to this title. Luckily, I live in an area where restaurants transparently advertise the quality of their ingredients.   That being said if I were to recommend to someone that they should ""life weights"" would you ask me to reassess that notion, because of its general phrasing. Certain lifts with certain weights for certain individuals can be more or less effective depending on the aforementioned criteria, but I'd argue that it's good general starting point that make the advice not only digestible, but attainable.   Your point of utilizing the calorie simply because of its use in common language, is a very fair, and it's something that I hadn't considered regarding accessibilty of information.  When people approach me as a source of information, and not seeking out resources, I find that saying ""to the best of your ability try to eat less sugar, more organic sources, and less things things with labels you can't read"" is very digestable (hah). But I see your point of having them exposed to the calorie rhetoric just as a point of entry.   But I think leading a discussion on fitness and health with statements that in some ways take the responsibility out of the hands of the individual will be less effective for that individual a majority of the time.   I've seen both accountability and exposure to naivety move people into action, it's all about how that information is presented I suppose.  As you all pointed out, I appreciate the level of diplomacy and etiquette that I'm seeing out of this sub. Thanks for being an ambassador for it.  Cheers   oh and PS hell yes for you making it clear that eating healthy is NOT more expensive"
InsideGaming,2to6nn,losNJdiablos,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:45:50 2015 UTC,"Well said.  I've had many of my friends ask me to help them lose weight and I end up driving them all away by over-complicating things.  In my opinion, the best thing you can do is bring someone to the gym with you, tell them how to perform exercises without being overly aggressive with correcting their form (unless it's borderline dangerous), and most importantly, lead them to sources where they can research nutrition for themselves and tell them to draw their own conclusions."
InsideGaming,2to6nn,LordVonDerp,7,Wed Jan 28 00:49:13 2015 UTC,I really hope no one who is serious about losing weight will ever see this post. It's a load of crap.
InsideGaming,2to6nn,LordVonDerp,-1,Mon Jan 26 01:15:43 2015 UTC,"It's not very constructive to  proclaim a sweeping statement to try and discredit everything I've said. As I stated, its an extremely pervasive ideology and one that has manifested in all facets of our culture, from our media's portrayal of exercise to the explosion in low-calorie snacks. If you want to assume you know best without actually applying any sort of effort and investigate what the grand majority of modern research has indicated, be my guest. But if you talk to anyone remotely involved in nutritional science, what I am saying is old news, and not even a little bit controversial. Uprooting these deeply set assumptions regarding health requires effort on your side, do a simple google search of ""is a calorie a calorie"". Click the hyperlink. Do something other than firmly planting your feet because what you think you knew is being challenged. Because there are people out there dedicating their lives towards finding these answers, and what you think you know is the stuff they were guessing at 20 years ago.   Remember nutrition is a science that is still in infantile years. If you accept early theories as gospel you are doing nothing but perpetuating archaic theories."
InsideGaming,2to6nn,LordVonDerp,3,Mon Jan 26 04:39:40 2015 UTC,"while i'm at it, i might as well inform myself on chemtrails and the haitian zombification rituals. what you are saying is hogwash. a calorie is in itself nothing but a unit of energy. there just is no way of producing more energy than you consumme. if there was, the human body would break one of the most basic rules of thermodynamics. if you like to think of nutrition as something esoteric and mythical, you're free to do so, but don't drag other people down with you."
InsideGaming,2to6nn,Kitty3feet,0,Mon Jan 26 10:12:57 2015 UTC,"Firstly, the law of thermodynamics is a law of physics, lets get that straight. If you read carefully you'd understand that I was not suggesting that energy could be created from nothing, or anything really that debunks these laws. You continue to use hyperbole in an attempt to discredit what I'm saying. I am simply saying that no where in these laws do they state what happens to energy when consumed. The calorie idea started on the enormous assumption that human biology and health directly correlates to a law of physics."
InsideGaming,2to6nn,DIEmensional,1 point,Mon Jan 26 15:31:52 2015 UTC,"enormous assumption that human biology and health directly correlates to a law of physics   it definitely does. if you burn more calories than you eat, you will lose weight, no matter the source of those calories. additionally watching macros and avoiding processed food of course is a good idea also."
InsideGaming,2to6nn,DIEmensional,3,Mon Jan 26 15:39:12 2015 UTC,"It's obviously more complex then caloric intake vs caloric exertion. But if you follow that very generally, provided you don't have some sort of genetic disease, you will be healthy and lose the weight. You obviously cannot eat ""empty"" calories. You have to eat healthy calories.   So if you follow that simple rule you will lose the weight and become healthy. It's not a bullshit concept. It's grossly oversimplified, yes, if you say it like caloric intake vs caloric exertion. But in reality that is a simplified version of having a healthy diet.  If you eat 3000 calories and only expend 1500 calories, your fucked. It's not like having the extra 1500 calories is a good thing. It's pretty simple that those calories are going to be converted into fat as you won't use the energy and you become unhealthy if a lifestyle like that persists.  Edit: formatting"
InsideGaming,2to6nn,thesublieutenant,1 point,Mon Jan 26 01:05:48 2015 UTC,"Hey Kitty3feet, thanks for being diplomatic in your response. You hit on a lot of good points in what you said. Eating nutrient dense calories is pretty much what I am getting at. But even framing it as ""healthy calories"" is problematic. It takes the focus and puts it on calories, point is our biology is meant to regulate our intake for use.  It has an incredible capacity to adapt based on the amount of energy we put in. If I am remembering correctly the podcast points to the 70's, a time where obesity rates were almost irrelevant. Nobody knew what a calorie was and exercise rates were lower. So how is that we explain that with the increase in amount of hrs exercised/american and the increase focus on low calorie diets, that obesity has reached unprecedented and epidemic levels? Meanwhile the sugar industry has boomed, the factory farm industry exploded, processed food and round-up ready/genetically modified crops are assimilated into everything we eat. It isn't conspiracy, and I am not claiming that. It is what the science and research points to. I know that we are so consistently preached the laws of thermodynamics, but it is missing the problem.  I know that since you responded you have some investment in health. I really encourage you to check out the podcast I posted. I remember when I listened to it last year it blew my mind haha   edit: The host and his guest even discuss a time when he increased his diet to 6000 caloric load (of nutrient dense, whole foods) and didn't see a dramatic gain in weight. They discuss what happens, what role the glycemic index plays into this, etc. Yea so once again, check it out. I think it'll really challenge some assumptions you have about biology."
InsideGaming,2to6nn,thesublieutenant,1 point,Mon Jan 26 04:50:43 2015 UTC,"The reason why he said calories in vs calories out is because it's basically a general rule in Health, and it's obviously not super simple as that, but considering the show isn't necessarily targeted at health nuts, it's a very good rule for newbies to follow by. Only eat as much as you're willing to exert, which is done by moderate exercise as even sitting and standing actually burns calories. One of the big things about health and excercise is how seemlessly overwhelming it can be percieved as, because if it wasn't everyone would be healthy and fit. If we're not it's probably because it's hard, or it maintains the illusion of being hard. If James just overwhelmed the views with a bunch of health advice, most of it's probably going to go over their head. It's probably easy for you to sit here and comment on this because you have what SEEMS like experience, but remember, not everyone is well experienced with balancing health and video games, so the best way to start, is to start simply whilst starting effectively which is calorie control."

InsideGaming,2tir1v,Rikuddo,1 point,Sat Jan 24 20:38:09 2015 UTC,"They made it private or took it down because it was a video the dev asked for, and they didn't like the video so they asked it to be taken down."
InsideGaming,2tir1v,WombRaid3r,1 point,Sat Jan 24 20:42:24 2015 UTC,Thank you and I appreciate your effort. By the way how long did it take to make that list ?
InsideGaming,2tir1v,Takanori00,1 point,Sat Jan 24 22:39:16 2015 UTC,It wasn't too long as the first half or so was already in a playlist on the machinimaLive channel (I made this playlist since they stopped updating that one).  Having to go through and find the rest was a little more annoying.  I did this a few months ago so I don't remember the actual amount of time but I would say it probably took me 30-40 minutes.  Trying to get them in somewhat order was the most annoying part with lots of rearranging ones that don't have a date attached to them.

Paypal and Western Union don't function here for the moment. The goverment cancelled those services so they could stop the flow of dollars out of the country.  The only payment service I use is the payoneer card and it only accepts payments trough this service or checking from companies. So the payment has to be from Machinima not you as a person.  IT'S REALLY A SHITTY MESS TO EXPLAIN!!  But I know you want them and I want you to have them, so I would be really glad to send you the dgital files so you can print them.

InsideGaming,2tgssa,redramzor,3,Sat Jan 24 00:53:40 2015 UTC,"To me, it depends on what you add to it. How much of your unique creative power went into your project?  For example, you see all the awesome fan art on this subreddit. All of the people drawing/editing those masterworks aren't good BECAUSE they feature IG, they are good AND they feature IG. Talent is evident despite the subject matter. Those people could have made sweet ass pictures of Burt Reynolds riding a space banana through the rings of Saturn, but they chose IG instead.  Bottom line: If you're good at what you do, and you're not just copy and pasting the work of others, I don't think you're leeching. You're just inspired."
InsideGaming,2tgssa,Knopantz,1 point,Sat Jan 24 01:30:47 2015 UTC,"Very good point, but where do you draw the line? At one point does it stop being creative and become copied and pasted? My little video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srcfo8dPUvM ) could have been just a clip show of some IG videos with the title ""Machinaman"" at the end. I guess the point I'm getting at is, where does the respectability of a piece end?"
InsideGaming,2tgssa,Knopantz,2,Sat Jan 24 01:47:36 2015 UTC,"I think the line is intent. If you are earnestly trying to create something your own that may happen to be based on something someone else created, I think your honesty shows in your work.  People can smell a fraud a lot of the time. If you're just trying to rack up views or ride on the coat tails of someone else it will show in your work. People will notice and leave.  Like in life in general, the best thing you can do is be honest. With yourself, with your work, with your potential audience. Build on a foundation of truth. A house built on sand washes away with the tide.  Look! I got preachy!"
InsideGaming,2tgssa,Vic-Boss,1 point,Sat Jan 24 03:14:40 2015 UTC,"Not preachy, once again you've made a great point. I actually have no rebuttal here but thank you for your insight!"
InsideGaming,2tgssa,Vic-Boss,2,Sat Jan 24 11:57:17 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that any use of trademarks or copyrighted materials could bring you trouble down the line. Even if it's said out right that you can use it if there's not a legal document or it's not stated that something falls under the creative commons category (CC0) or even CC-BY which you have to give attribution can be a pitfall and your downfall if you get successful. They usually never move legally against small fries but it would be a shame if you make it to big and then lose thousands on courts. From every entertainment medium to the other this stuff changes, ""Game Ideas"" for example are not considered patents even if they are straight out copycats, however the use of trademarks like names and iconic characters or whatever else is grounds for a lawsuit. That's why youtube lets all game companies to flag channels using their games if they want to, of course this goes against other licenses such as ""for reviewing purposes"" or ""parodies"" and other stuff and that's why content Id shou.....zzzzzzz So anyway, keep it in mind"
InsideGaming,2tgssa,Vic-Boss,1 point,Sat Jan 24 01:48:43 2015 UTC,But is it ethical to leech off a famous artist/work to put yourself to fame? Even if the work is your own creation.
InsideGaming,2tgssa,YodatheHobbit,2,Sat Jan 24 02:06:44 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't mind at all, for example let's say there is a game i like, after I finish it, the next thing I'm going to do is go to google and search ""games similar to (insert game)"". If you are having fun with what you are doing then this will pass into your audience and they will love you for that, if you are not then you will be doing a half-assed job (probably). That's what matters the most I believe. Compare how the IG members are to other newscasters like IGN or Gamespot, most of the time they look like they are doing their lines at gunpoint while in IG videos you see chaos :P. Just do what you enjoy to do."
InsideGaming,2tgssa,TheSolarSentinel,1 point,Sat Jan 24 02:16:12 2015 UTC,"But there has got to be some limit...if I was to make a channel all about Pewdiepie compilations, I know it would get views (I might also die a little inside) but I wouldn't be earning it. I see so many people hopping on bandwagons to get themselves noticed and their work could barely be considered ""creative"" in my book.  I mean, just look at this ( http://gamejolt.com/search/?q=five+nights ), in my opinion, its shameful."
InsideGaming,2tgssa,Montezum,1 point,Sat Jan 24 12:18:29 2015 UTC,"You can compromise, make videos screaming to pewdiepie screaming :P As i said it doesn't matter much but just compilations might get the attention of Polaris and Mickey Mouse has a hard-on for lawsuits if you get famous. Games might be free to makes videos but the actual videos they make fall under the youtube license and things differ a lot there."
InsideGaming,2tgssa,pingustits,2,Sat Jan 24 16:24:37 2015 UTC,"That's a very interesting topic for discussion. My example is to a lesser extent that what you're talking about, but I've received a lot of friend requests on Xboxlive and now PS4 from people I've never played with or or don't know just from playing in IG GTA videos. They're like ""Hey I've seen you playing with Inside Gaming! Can I be your friend?"" Even though I do enjoy the attention a bit and it's nice to have my username recognized I do feel like a lot of the time it's very undeserved. IG did all the work creating the video. I only showed up to be in the job and have fun. I don't make videos or do anything creative with games but it seems to give some people the impression that I do. So if I were to start making videos or trying to be a Youtuber I would have a small built in audience that I didn't earn."

Just by estimating you can assume that the only way to fit the rest of the components is around the disc drive, which by today's standards of technology, is impossible. This doesn't even account for a suitable fan which would also have to be in this set amount of space.  This has been done before - see the PS2 and the PS2 slim.

I don't know if this is the same for others, but for me as long as those 2 are in the podcasts, I'll keep watching on YouTube. If you guys really want to diversify your podcast audience, I think you should find another way to highlight fan art instead of on the podcast. This is just my opinion though.  I like watching it on YouTube, but if I could listen to the whole podcast on my way to Uni without wondering what I'm missing out on, I would download each episode the moment they come out."

At the end of the day it's a cost benefit analysis of what the contents cost in time, money and effort to produce vs the traffic and in turn revenue to brings to the operations and if there are other things that would product better results.   I will say though, I wish you guys would find smaller, more personal ways to produce content. I think I'm with the rest of the community when I saw we like you guys more than the content.   Giant bomb does a weekly podcast that is normally three hours and is about 60% about gaming. The other 40% is about life, and other random things.  It's about you guys, not the content.

Many games published by the NIS America/Atluses of the world were only available thru GameStop if you pre-ordered them or the store decided to order 1 or 2 copies.   It was either that or hope you see it again somewhere and hope you didn't get gouged for it.

If the game is finished and works and you want to play it, buy it for 60$ done and done....Unless the game is made by Ubisoft and you are playing on PC...NEVER BUY GAMES FROM UBISOFT ON PC until they are on sale, they are not worth 60$..Thats just my view on it...I personally have only preordered BF3, because it was an offer I couldn't refuse :D Saved 15 euros and I had 5 of my friends who bought it already...As for Batman and Robin, BATCREDIT CARD,enough said...As for Space Jam I love that movie, because I watched it as a kid.

I pre-ordered it because I love Aliens and it looked amazing, and that statue that came with it was awesome, it was the best thing in the box in the end. I'm not going to justify anything about that beyond that I like statues that come with games, I still regret not getting the Skyrim special edition that came with an Alduin statue and Bioshock Infinite for the Songbird.   Anyway.   Colonial Marines taught me not to get hyped for something and pre-order so I try to not pre-order after that. But then I pre-ordered Alien Isolation; fuck me right?   At this point though, I don't pre-order unless I play the beta or something. I have pre-ordered Evolve, a bunch of mates and I played the beta for that and we liked it and we all agreed to get the game. I pre-ordered it because I could get it for $50 digital otherwise I would have waited.  I didn't get hyped for Destiny and with good cause that payed off. I can't see myself pre-ordering anything beyond maybe Halo 5, I'll have to see how worthwhile it is."

There are a few exceptions I have to this. One is if (as James said) it's an existing property that has repeatedly shown to not put out bad games (such as Metal Gear Solid IMO). Also, another case is games that only have limited amounts of physical copies (and you prefer that). The last reason to do it is to support a game. This would include a game that you might have imported, and is finally getting a US release."

RadBrad shows you good gameplay and let's you make your own opinion and TB gives in depth reviews on games.

Because you'll receive an extra amount of in-game cash or a ""special"" skin for your character? Not worth the commitment of something that you haven't tried yet yourself.  There are however a few exceptions like a new GTA or Zelda because these are ""trusted"" franchises, this especially goes for Nintendo, but i still wouldn't pre-order one of these UNLESS i get a cool extra. I've pre-ordered Zelda: Twilight Princess once because i would get a bonus disc with Ocarina of Time with it. Now that was worth it."

InsideGaming,2taf9x,zmichalo,1 point,Wed Jan 28 06:32:32 2015 UTC,"the problem isn't pre ordering games, it's buying games before you've seen and heard enough about the finished product. video games often change in performance and direction throughout development, so watching an hour of gameplay before the game comes out, as bruce suggested, is not necessarily you watching the finished product.  it happened with destiny with the infamous ""you can explore all of this"" line in the e3 demo, or assassin's creed running perfectly in pre release demos, and then having the release run like shit. the issue with trusting a hour long demo before the game comes out is that it's a controlled environment dictated by the developer. along with this is the fact that developers are getting worse and worse at conveying the concept of their games to consumers, in the case of destiny not turning out to be what most people thought it would.  what i believe it comes down to is that pre ordering to some people is an implication that you are ok with buying a game without knowing what the finished product will actually be like, and again, this is the true problem the industry is facing. you guys brought up the argument, ""it's your money do what you want, this is how the system works..etc."" but it goes beyond that. money is the only tool we have to directly, and in the most objective way, tell game makers what we enjoy playing. by buying before you have the correct amount of info about the FINISHED game, you run the risk of putting your money towards an idea of a game that may not actually reflect what the finished game is.   TL;DR: pre ordering is not the problem, buying games without proper information about the finished product is the problem."

InsideGaming,2taf9x,zmichalo,1 point,Fri Jan 23 01:01:28 2015 UTC,What? Why would you want a broken game when you could get something  you're sure of isn't. When dozens of people buy a broken game they are effectively saying to that developer/publisher that it's OK to release a broken product.
InsideGaming,2taf9x,theMTNdewd,0,Fri Jan 23 10:45:56 2015 UTC,"Yes maybe this one would be the same, but future releases would not. The developers and publishers would realize consumers don't want broken games and try harder to release a finished and polished product.  as opposed to relying on past success and future updates, they'd have to prove to the consumer on day one that this is a product people should want."
InsideGaming,2taf9x,zmichalo,2,Fri Jan 23 01:37:44 2015 UTC,"No because 95℅ of people who buy games   Don't talk about them online Don't care that there are framedrops or gameplay bugs   These are the majority of the market. They won't see your ""don't pre order"" push. They don't care enough that you fall through the floor in AC Unity to not pre order AC Victory.

This is more or less in regards to point 3 and point 2 where people are paying full price or more, but it also does apply to point 1 as you are STILL buying the game earlier despite it being in Beta. In that Beta stage they won't be making huge content changes, just small minute changes along with bug patches-  I disagree with not pre-ordering. I just think people are doing it wrong. If you're going to invest money in a game/corporation that you don't get much press on, then investigate the fuck out of them, be critical. Don't just look at trailers, look at articles on them, press conferences, etc. If you don't do these, and I don't believe most do as even Adam said we are an impulsive audience, you allow the corporation to lie to their hearts desire, as you aren't being CRITICAL. I also believe we are impulsive is because we are made to be as such, a lot of companies are now making games free and are marketed at 80% just because its a certain time of year, so we piss our money down the drain without consequence, but when we actually put money into a game thats 0% off, we are so surprised at how we bought such a bad game. Start to be more critical gamers and maybe the industry will start producing better quality to reach this new standard born from our ability to critique. As always, I love your content, keep being critical IQ because half of youtube won't.﻿  TL;DR - Don't be a retard, actually do some investigating and think critically on context of the game so you don't get caught out with buyers remorse"

They were recording for hours and hours back to back to make sure that videos would be upload. Hell Ricky and Eliot were editing till 5am recently whilst in Romania.   Also, go back to the old podcasts and see the routes they took into the industry. It involved a lot of hard work, it doesn't just ""happen"". For example, Blaine from Roosterteeth went to college, graduated as a film major (I think, I don't know 100%), whilst constantly applying for internships at Roosterteeth.

I assume this working feild isn't right for me but I enjoy your work so much Machinima and Inside Gaming."
InsideGaming,2t9xbd,redramzor,3,Thu Jan 22 23:44:29 2015 UTC,Anyone asking to work for IG should take some time to start up a youtube channel and try to upload videos.   I think that the vast majority of people would realize very quickly just how much work is required in this kind of work.

I worked in television news for years and honestly it was terrible, not necessarily because of the deadlines but because I was not happy with the content I was producing. The IG/Machinima staff seem to have it pretty good, no doubt with its bumps in the road, but they seem happy about the content they are producing and willing to stand behind it...not something I would have done when I worked in news."

I studied it for 5 years, have my Bachelors and Masters and still can't get a job in my field because they're pretty much non-existent in my country. YAY /sarcasm (But it's pretty boring IMO. Standing in a lab all day every day, doing the same task over and over.)  And getting a PHD is harder than you're making it sound. Though I'm not sure exactly how it works for USA, but you have to have the top GPA so keep them studies up, Bro :) But people won't really ""notice"" you. Again, I'm not sure about USA specifically but for PHD, a company usually sponsors you, and you essentially do their research for them, like a corporate sell out. The only people who will notice you is them because the research you do is bias and always in favor of their company and their image etc"

InsideGaming,2tc57z,insidegamingbot,2,Thu Jan 22 22:24:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think you guys did nearly enough research about the HoloLens if you're honestly still skeptical. When the Kinect came out, I remember a lot of people were ""meh"" at it, while many panned it, but the HoloLens has gotten critical acclaim from many people who tried it out.  Hell, The Verge and CNET are NEVER nice to Microsoft and even they loved it.  http://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-hololens-hands-on/  http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7868251/microsoft-hololens-hologram-hands-on-experience  Paul Thurrott, while being a Windows guy, routinely calls Microsoft on any bullshit they try to pass off (and agrees with you guys about Kinect), and even he loved it   https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/573/hands-microsoft-hololens  Even Khail got excited about it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHWR_WOhao8  Even better, they said that it should ship by the end of the year, so it's clearly technology that's ready for release. I swear, for being paid off by Microsoft, you were pretty unfair to what IMO was the coolest part of the event."

InsideGaming,2tc57z,Spooleo,1 point,Fri Jan 23 00:25:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's one of those things that all the previous attempts were before their time and we are finally moving into an era where this technology is more practical. However, it will take awhile for people to warm up to the idea that its a legitimate product.   We are seeing the emergence of the new age of how we integrate with technology.   Oculus Rift, Gear VR, Razer's OSVR, Microsoft's Hololense, Glassesless 3D, Google Glass, smart watches, screens that bend and fold away.   I think the next ten years is going to be pretty fucking crazy."
InsideGaming,2tc57z,Kage_Oni,2,Fri Jan 23 01:11:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think Google Glass was too ahead of it's time and didn't really do much to enhance your experience. Oculus seems very cool, but AR seems like it'll be more appealing to VR, at least to most people.   Still, Microsoft products are never given a pass like other company's products are, so if it's getting this much praise, I'm way more excited about this compared to how I was with Kinect where I thought ""lol I'm not going to stand in front of my TV""."
InsideGaming,2tc57z,gomezz34,2,Fri Jan 23 01:24:38 2015 UTC,"This sounds awesome to me. I have young kids who use the TV in the evenings, so I don't get to play until they go to bed (mostly because of the game content, not because I can't kick them off the TV). Being able to stream it to my PC while someone was using the TV seems perfect for that. Or went I want to lay in my bed and play."
InsideGaming,2tc57z,seyton74,1 point,Thu Jan 22 23:41:09 2015 UTC,I really hope that Microsoft does work on making the streaming work both ways.   Steam in home streaming is great and all but I would appreciate a 1:1 clone of my desktop streamed to my TV.   You sprinkle on some OS navigation with the controller and maybe some wireless keyboard support for the XBO (if it doesn't have it already) and I think the whole would be greater than the sum of its parts.
InsideGaming,2tc57z,Kage_Oni,1 point,Fri Jan 23 01:20:36 2015 UTC,"Why are you guys excited for this?!? This is nothing special. For them going: ""We will give more focus on gaming on PC"" and then just saying well here is Fabel (which is great) and you can stream Xbox games on your PC its just not good. Streaming games from Xbox to PC is not good enough as porting Xbox Games. They dont want to port Halo cuz then you wouldn't have to buy the box that is weaker then PC in every way...And also WHY THE FUCK would you want to stream games from your PC on your Xbox? Its a weaker system, why would you ever want to downgrade your game...If you want to play from the couch, just hook the TV up to your PC....The best thing that maybe came out of this is DirectX 12 which I hope will make gaming on PC even better, if not, then I will just stick to Win7"

There is a rumoured massive disc based DLC set to come out in September which adds a whole lot of everything (New planet, new sub-classes, new weapon types apparently included). Story will likely not improve but damn if i won't have fun anyway.   As for your idea of a prequel, very unlikely. All of the events worth playing have already been told to us via the grimoire. Before these events is a dark age of living in caves and shit, nobody wants to play that."

I'm sure you can get your fix off of those. They're in total just a bit under 4 hours of QA."

But then it would just turn into an IG QA stream instead of a podcast I think. Plus, a lot of the fun of the QA comes from the edits they make to correlate with the stories they create.   You would also have opposing interests when it comes to creativity. You have one side of each member telling them to be zany and ridiculous for the QA part and the other side of each member knowing that the video ask them to stay grounded and seriously (I say seriously sorta lightly) discuss topics."

Edit: Actually, I lied, there is one more super long IGQA, however, it's number doesn't seem to correspond to the date it was posted in the timeline I've created so far so I think it was meant to be a continuation of Kovic's original series despite it being named IGQA.

InsideGaming,2t6lcf,Kitty3feet,1 point,Thu Jan 22 00:39:17 2015 UTC,"Right because those time slots aren't specifically left open for such occurrences as the podcast and the gameplay streams right?  Of course there needs to be editing. Do you know how many people ask the same god damn question? Nobody wants them to sit and answer the same question over and over again. Let alone having to get through as many questions of on average over 400 questions in presumably an amount of time spanning 1 hour? Without editing that would just be obscene to watch because of how many times they have to answer the same question and answer questions that they have already answered from previous weeks. Plus there are just a lot of piss poor questions people ask. ""Where do I hide the body?"" Is one I've seen reoccurring as well as "".... Fuck one, marry one, kill one"" games."

It's a preorder and you get to see the game shape up.   Now H1Z1 is a little different because they are charging $20 for early access to a free to play game. However, they did the same thing with PS2 and that turned out all right.   However, personal opinion, I dont think H1Z1 is going to be any good.   After following the gaming industry you can get a pretty good feeling for how a game is going to turn out by looking at the first bits of public media and listening to what the devs have to say. I feel like the devs over reached, and in the wrong areas while also choosing to follow a half assed art style.   It must be impossible to a game like DayZ that isn't fucked up."

Nobody should've expected this to be flawless and problem free.  The entire point of allowing people to buy into early access was to have the testers they need to hammer the bugs out for release.    I'm quite surprised at the internet's reactions and more specifically Inside Gaming's Daily.  While I usually Agree with IG's consensus, it seems that you're looking at this like the actual release of the game.  I have no problem giving SOE  20 bucks to further the game as I have faith in their ability to develop this game into the best zombie survival out there."

Thanks for not screwing up the actual info since the entire Internet was like a broken telephone over the weekend. They fucked up the launch, that's for sure,  but at least they are actively avoiding dumb shit that dayz does. They make these games because people simply want something that is not so broken. However at launch like this h1z1 is barely less broken than dayz so please don't play it on a podcast or something. ...

InsideGaming,2t3xqj,Aerial_1,0,Wed Jan 21 00:11:01 2015 UTC,"This is a comment from CozmicSaber in the YT comments, figured I'd post it here so you all can see it since it's pretty accurate despite being awkwardly worded:   I Really use to like this fucking show, but now that I have previous Knowledge  on a topic (H1Z1). I know how much of the whole story the actually told. The percentage of the story they gave was not even 20%. Here's how the story goes over the course of 8 months. They told us about air drops and  the community thought it was a good idea, over the course of several streams we got more info being; that air drops can contain rare items/loot. This was a player driven event and idea. The thought process of SOE is that since the community was okay with its Air drop, that there were going to be no problems with it at launch. But as was stated that Air drops do Contain rare items which is the reason you've seen Guns in them.The community didn't think that was included. Now the part that Inside Gaming Daily didn't explain. The Dev team and the CEO of SOE have been transparent since day  one if one ask them a question you would get a answer. If you want proof Just ask me and I will show you. At launch of H1Z1 Air Drops were bugged and so were zombies for unknown reasons. The Air Drop was supposed to be dropped in a 250m radius but instead it was dropped straight on your head which is why people said that with was Pay to Win. Like I said it was a bug. Within a 24-48 Hour period a patch came out and fixed 250m radius to what is now 700m with a minim of 120 player on a server to activate it. At first the game seemed almost or was Pay to Win, but now it's fixed and it very hard to get you own order Air Drop with the addition of a 65% chance of getting crap and only a 10% chance of getting a gun. Just look around YouTube a twitch and watch the currently patched air drops. I think Inside Gaming Daily really owes the Devs a apology for trying to ruin their and H1Z1's as a game Credit.﻿   Since the commenter said he has proof of transparency but didn't provide any, I will.   John Smedley agreed that Airdrops were P2W on day 1. They were then fixed the next day: http://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/2sn8k6/status_update_1162015_910am_pst/cnra1x2 Adam Clegg, a designer on H1Z1, apologizing for what the community saw as him lying about the content of Airdrops (he also explicitly details the ways that they were fixed): http://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/2sopo9/update_about_airdrops_and_my_personal_apology/   I'll probably update this with more examples if I can find any."
InsideGaming,2t3xqj,TheFailClub,12,Wed Jan 21 04:07:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I can tell you my immediate problem with this commenter's reaction to our show.   First, I don't see how you can claim that we only told ""20%"" of the story when everything we described as having happened in the game is listed right there in the comment itself and acknowledged by the developers. Clearly, we're aware of their transparency because 20% of the story is us reading quotes from Smedley himself. I guess I'm not seeing where you're finding issue in our reporting.   If your issue is with our opinions, because IGD is a personality-centered opinion show, after all, then who should we criticize? Again, I think we did a pretty good job of wagging our fingers at the developers who are charging for a far from complete experience as well as the consumers who are buying in only to turn around and complain when they find the product to be imperfect."
InsideGaming,2t3xqj,JustRiggz,1 point,Wed Jan 21 05:37:38 2015 UTC,"I have absolutely no problem with the opinions of you or anyone else at IG. I've been watching your videos for a while, and I understand that IGD is based on opinion. Also, a bit of a disclaimer, I actually haven't even played H1Z1 yet, so my opinions on the game are based solely on what I've heard about the game since its announcement last April. So you can take my view on the game itself with a grain of salt.  My issue wasn't with what you said, it's what you didn't say, or at least didn't say much about. In the video, you talked about the major issues the game had last week, like log in issues, broken airdrops, etc., but, without rewatching the video (so if I'm wrong please let me know), it seems like you either didn't talk about or just barely mentioned any of the good things the developers have done since last Thursday other than the refunds they gave. I just think it's not fair to address the issues the game had last week without giving the same amount of attention to the ways that those issues were fixed."
InsideGaming,2t3xqj,TheFailClub,1 point,Wed Jan 21 21:21:05 2015 UTC,"Well just because they are transparent and are ""nice guys"" doesn't rectify the fact that the game was a shit storm at launch. Even despite it being early access, games should expect large demands at launch so they don't fuck up their servers. In other words they should over prepare, not under-prepare. I've watched hours of gameplay from multiple people on twitch and I can say that consistently the gameplay looked terrible. It's just a walking and berry picking simulator. Occasionally you'll see a zombie and then all of a sudden they start popping out of nowhere. Then they just stand still until you kill them. Only once have I actually seen a zombie attack a person after running at them. I even watched the developers play and saw zombies standing still, popping in out of nowhere, and very little loot to the point of having to cheat and use console commands because there was no guns to show off. There is no winning in this game, so paying extra money is just stupid, not pay to win. Also, if you have to pay money to get loot from airdrops in a game where there should be loot around to find then that's a horrible system."
InsideGaming,2t3xqj,Kitty3feet,0,Wed Jan 21 04:29:01 2015 UTC,"Even despite it being early access, games should expect large demands at launch so they don't fuck up their servers.   The point is to fuck up their servers. That's how they can prepare for full release. Remember, the game is still actively in development.   I've watched hours of gameplay from multiple people on twitch and I can say that consistently the gameplay looked terrible. It's just a walking and berry picking simulator.   The game is in Alpha. It's been in development for just over a year. One of SOE's reasons for doing Early Access is to gain feedback from real players and work from that. The features of the game aren't fully fleshed out yet because they're still trying to figure out how to flesh them out.   Also, if you have to pay money to get loot from airdrops in a game where there should be loot around to find then that's a horrible system.   There is loot to find in the world, obviously. Some of the highest-end loot, like the AR15 and Hunting Rifle, aren't obtainable through Airdrops, only through looting. They also had an issue with loot not spawning in containers which was adressed with a patch that came out earlier today."
InsideGaming,2t3xqj,TheFailClub,1 point,Wed Jan 21 04:41:36 2015 UTC,"How do you justify there being micro transactions in a very early Alpha release? Why are they there? If they wanted to test how the drops would work surely they could have made them free until launch, but with some sort of timer so you couldn't spam them."
InsideGaming,2t3xqj,HappyPillz77,1 point,Wed Jan 21 08:09:03 2015 UTC,"What exactly is there to justify? Someone decided that it should be implemented so it's there. Nobody is holding a gun to your head making you spend money in any game. Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm from Blizzard both had payments enabled in their alphas.  And if you'd say ""well those are from Blizzard"", then you need to be more specific with your argument."
InsideGaming,2t3xqj,romeozor,2,Wed Jan 21 12:50:07 2015 UTC,"I think the what my friend here is trying to talk say (though I could be wrong) is that in this game specifically, the micro transactions are a complete rip off in such an early stage of the game. You put your money into a slot machine and out comes whatever the random number generator wants to give you. If someone wanted to play a slot machine then they can go to a casino, not play H1Z1. The only gaurentee you get is that you don't have your money anymore.   I don't follow H1Z1 or hearthstone very closely but when you talk about the heartstone alpha I found this on gamespot  ""The other thing is that players in the alpha will have their accounts wiped in the future, losing their purchases and in-game gold. If you spend real money during the alpha, the money will be credited back into your Battle.net account when the servers are wiped.""  This shows that they are giving your money back to you anyways right? Unlike H1Z1 where you don't get a promise of anything and you don't eventually get your money back if you get screwed over.   Then again they can't make the crates too powerful otherwise the game is pay to win. In my opinion, what they should've done is not made that a microtransactions just so they could make money. They should've made like a flare or something that you can find and throw on the ground which signals a crate drop. Nobody gets screwed out of money and it's not pay to win. Pure luck and that point. Plus nobody bashes you when they lose their money. They just wanted to implement it for the sake of continuing to make some sort of small profit on this game. But the way it is implemented doesn't justify it being in there."
InsideGaming,2t3xqj,Kitty3feet,1 point,Wed Jan 21 17:24:30 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with me is that I am not a believer in the early access model. Call me old fashioned, but, I believe if you pay for a product you should get that product and it should be working. I can understand that they are supposed to flesh the gameplay out later on but the fact is you have to pay to play this barebones walking simulator. Like the guys said, you're paying for an idea, and you're barely getting a product. It's seems like a good thing that they are at least fixing the loot problems."
InsideGaming,2t3xqj,Kitty3feet,-1,Wed Jan 21 12:24:26 2015 UTC,"I've played for almost 40 hours so far with literally zero crashes aside from the pre announced downtime.   The only real bug I encountered was floating  arrows... Which games like skyrim suffer with almost 5 years after launch.  I can run the game at a locked 60 fps on high settings (Dayz cant lock 60 fps on SLI 970s).   They have fixed over 100 minor bugs in less than 48 hours. Almost a dozen ""major"" bugs. None of which were game breaking except for cheaters who duped items. But that's  fixed too!  Crafting works, looting works, shooting works, driving works, zombies work, bears work, deer work. Wtf do you douche bags want?  Also, did you corporate shills forget what early access means?   You insufferable cunts will defend Destiny and MCC to the death, which are $60 ""AAA"" titles that are both either broken or devoid of true content. Then a game in early access has minor bugs that get fixed in less than 48 hours, and you shit all over it?   You people are clowns of the gaming industry. And everywhere but this specific subreddit  freely acknowledges that fact.   Rev3games has more integrity than you people, and they aren't even a channel anymore.

A year ago i also had trouble getting clients. ( i am a media Designer and the few people i knew that had clients had them because of  A. they had well connected friends. or  B. a huge amount of good content. and then around that time IG mentioned that it was important to have media out there.  So i started creating media every week and posting it on Facebook and going to free seminars and film festivals to learn and grow and to meet people that have a passion for media too. And posted all my work on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, Deviant art, Instagram, Linkedin and Behance and that really got the ball rolling for me. just by getting my work out there and myself out there.  in my experience behance is a really nice community and deviant art is a nice community too but overloaded with so much art (My Little Pony fan art) that it is harder to get noticed.  Getting my work out there worked for me but with me it only happened when creating media and learning new things became a habit for me.  I hope you get more clients soon I know that it is a sucky place in a career to be. Your site looks sleek I can't really see a lot technic in your work of  except for some retouching i really loved the ideas of your videos especially Kyle and todd was hella funny, it is kind of rough technically editing wise but it looks like you are a very creative person. and if you are passionate it is just a matter of time and hard work.

InsideGaming,2sxp9w,ohyeahcartoons,4,Mon Jan 19 17:42:52 2015 UTC,car racing is not a sport
InsideGaming,2sxp9w,Qsaws,0,Mon Jan 19 22:30:57 2015 UTC,Well you don't just 'sit' there do you? And why should it be avoided.
InsideGaming,2sxp9w,pingustits,0,Mon Jan 19 18:00:00 2015 UTC,"What I meant was the physical force exerted by the human. In case of running, long jump and cycling I get it, but in terms of race cars (take F1 for that matter) all the controls are by and on the steering wheel - much like the XBOX or anyother steering wheel games. So in both the cases (actual race car and the XBOX virtual race cars)- same amount of work is being exerted by the player. ( I said avoid so as to exclude any reactive force that would occur, say G Force in terms of actual racing) - and also ""reactive force"" is not mentioned in the definition of ""sports"" is it? Thereby stating that gaming is a sport. Or atleast I think so."
InsideGaming,2sxp9w,JustRiggz,0,Mon Jan 19 18:28:56 2015 UTC,"Because gaming is virtual. You fuck up in F1 racing you will have a pretty physical crash, anyway while car racing is a sport, it isnt a true sport like athletics, football, rugby and such. But video gaming doesn't even fall in the same category of sport as motor racing. Please show me the statistics that show where a video gamer playing a racing game experts the same amount of work as someone in F1. I'm also trying to refer to the games played as 'eSports' like Dota."

InsideGaming,2t01ic,IxIZxPANCAKEZZ,6,Tue Jan 20 01:21:49 2015 UTC,"Do you have any acting experience? Are you decent/cool looking enough and/or do you have the right personality for the general YouTube audience to want to watch you? Are you good (and fast) at editing videos? Can you write scripts? Can you REALLY write scripts or do you just ""think"" you can write scripts? Do you have any even remotely well-received material on YouTube at all?  If you answered no to even like 2 of these questions, then there are a ton of other (likely higher-paying) jobs that would suit you much better. You can also go back to school and learn some of these skills.  If you answered yes to all of these, then take a look at your LinkedIn and try to find some connections at Machinima (or at least in the YouTube industry) and try to work your way to connecting with someone at Machinima or even Inside Gaming. You could also try to go the regular route and try to snag a job once it opens up (google ""Machinima job listings"") but your chances are slim.  It sounds to me like you want to apply to be a ""host"" at Inside Gaming, but people don't really apply for jobs like this. They get them through connections, sheer luck, or YEARS upon YEARS of paying their dues working their asses off doing work that is unrelated to playing video games and making dick jokes. If you absolutely, positively NEED to be a YouTube webshow host, then the route is NOT easy and you most likely WON'T end up where you want to be. The smartest thing you can do is get your foot in the door by working a low-level job anywhere in the entertainment industry, getting as many connections as possible, and proving to each one of those connections that you are the absolute shit."

Everything you guys do in your videos generally makes me laugh and improves my mood. The only thing that is annoying is how you guys make games like DayZ & H1Z1 look and sound like complete garbage. Half the time it makes me, and I'd assume others, feel almost put down because we play games we enjoy. They're both ""early access"" games so of course they will be a little broken. But what is wrong with supporting a developer who is making a game you think you would really enjoy (& that I actually do)? Oh and how many of you have actually sat and played DayZ or H1Z1 off stream and tried to figure it out? That's it, done rambling."

When talking about cars we are are talking about a huge gap between original and add-on, around >1/100, when on a game it's a 1/4 of the price. To compare the 2 it'd be like buying a $20,000 and then being told a radio will be be 5,000 extra. Bad example considering car add-ons are already disgustingly over priced as well.

If you mean everyone who didn't win the mini game takes a shot then everyone is going to get really drunk because IIRC mini games happen after all four players have finished moving, so depending on the turn limit of the game that could be a ridiculous amount of shots.   Rule suggestions:  If you land on the star space but can't afford it you take a shot.  If a player gets a star everyone else takes one shot.  If a star is stolen from you by boo you have to take a shot.  If you land on a bowser space you take a shot."

InsideGaming,2sikn8,Cheesy-potato,6,Thu Jan 15 23:47:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a female in my mid-twenties who's been playing games for as long as I can remember, and never once have I thought ""I should be able to play this character as a woman."" I generally play single player games, so what ever gender the main character is, I just assume that's the gender that fits the story. Gaming is still widely seen as something that mostly only guys are into, so it makes perfect sense that most of the time you play as a male character.  If the game interests you and has good gameplay, the gender of the playable character should have absolutely no bearing on whether or not you will play it. The reasoning that a certain gender isn't relatable enough and takes you out of the immersion of a game is crazy. Remember: it's only a game. Pure entertainment. The gender you play as for few hours on you're t.v. has no impact on your real life."
InsideGaming,2sikn8,robotboots,1 point,Thu Jan 15 16:05:11 2015 UTC,"Interesting, what are your thoughts about Japanese games/culture? As the internet lost it's collective shit when Kojima unveiled the character Quiet a while back for his upcoming MGS game."
InsideGaming,2sikn8,shplamana,2,Thu Jan 15 18:12:27 2015 UTC,"I think it goes back to the fact that gaming is still seen as dominated by men. A hot girl in a bikini is going to get more attention than a plain girl in some frumpy outfit. Its just what sells. Video games are mainly marketed towards men. I can't blame them for it. If it was a hot guy in some sexy outfit, i'd be all over that.  I feel like having a character like quiet in such an extreme outfit like that is mostly to get more attention on the game. I can see them pitching this now ""so we know the fans will play the new mgs no matter what. But how can we get more interest and introduce new people to it?"" Kojima talked about how other things also can be viewed as sexy too. Like weapons and cars. Which does make some sense. You'll go for the sports car before the beat up mini van.  I see games eventually representing men and women fairly equally in the future. More women are gaming now, more developers will start accommodating for that."
InsideGaming,2sikn8,robotboots,2,Thu Jan 15 18:55:33 2015 UTC,"I think you are spot on with that last part. Gaming is getting more and more popular, and developers will follow their audience. More women playing, more women getting interested in development and all that good shit.  It's a terrible shame that there are people on all sides of the whole gender & video games ""argument"" who want to hijack entertainment to serve as a weapon for their shitty moral crusades and causes."

I admit any time I can design a character I look for the female option. I don't think the contraversy is just gender though. I've heard people say they didn't play San Andreas because they didn't want to be a black person (in not so many words). And I think Sleeping Dogs could have had more sales with a white main character. At least women get to be main characters sometimes, like for example, the strongest characters in Dragon Age I are women. I don't believe in diversity for diversity's sake, since it could hurt sales of a good game. I would like it though if most games, story allowing, would provide character customization."

I actually have noticed that there seem to be quite a few people in gaming who apparently want it to be a subculture of exclusion. The same people who talk about fake gamer girls and casuals are the same people who have this attitude that being physically fit makes you incapable of being a gamer. I take my strength training fairly seriously, although I have yet to compete in a strength sport, and I at least get the impression from some gamers that they think that, by my association with training, I must be a mouth breathing jock who can't tie his own shoelaces. Stereotyping cuts in all directions, folks."
InsideGaming,2sikn8,SAS29,1 point,Thu Jan 15 21:45:42 2015 UTC,"Just to give Spoole perspective on console gaming. Personally, it's got nothing to do with graphics or more performance on PC. Personally, I love Steam, buying a game once and being able to play it on any computer I buy in the future is a nice little bonus. Playing multiplayer FPS is so much more engaging on a mouse and keyboard. There are tons of reasons to love PC's.  But why I prefer gaming on a console is because of the setup. Even if you drop a massive amount on money on your PC, buy the very best monitors, best headphones, it'll still probably not be as good as a pretty decent TV ($2,000+ range). The best gaming monitors colorwise aren't as nice as a really good TV (unless you go for a monitor designed for color work, which is $2,000+ alone). Resolution matters little from your couch, and if you can actually tell the difference, your likely sitting too close to your tv anyway. I have a pair of Shure SE535 headphones, and games sound incredible on my PC, but even a simple soundbar on my home theater, whilst not as good, is just as engaging when playing Assassins Creed or Wolfenstein.  Again, for some games (Battlefield, MMO's, Total War), PC is so much nicer, but if you have a halfway decent home theater (and most people do nowadays since it's not crazy priced anymore), sitting on your comfortable couch, playing games on the biggest screen in your house is just more fun. Especially when you consider that even though consoles are never as powerful, the fact that a GTX 980 costs more then a console, and you still need to drop another few thousand to build the rest of the system, using the setup in your home is just a more comfortable way to game.  Also, though not as prevalent today, multiplayer games like Smash Bros, Fifa, Madden, etc., are more fun with a large screen and friends on the same couch."

Picture this how about Tess was the main character in Last of Us (just to tick off James) instead of Joel , to escort Ellie . It would be bad ass and give more emotional punch and a change from Telltale's Walking Dead (a man - dad figure & a little girl - surrogate daughter) turn it to mother-daughter story  .  On that note , I would buy that . Would anyone be interesting of that aspect . Nevertheless , comes down to execution of the character (either male or female) and good script to support it to make it logical in the confine of the story by the storyteller/scriptwriter ."
InsideGaming,2sikn8,SaltedPorkChop,1 point,Fri Jan 16 13:43:12 2015 UTC,"Really late to the party on this one but I usually play games where the lead character is male.  I grew up watching pro wrestling in the hulk hogan/macho man era, Arnold/Van Damme/Seagal action movies etc.. and those are the type of heroes that I had growing up so male lead characters are what I gravitate to.  I think part of it is wanting to ""buy in"" to whatever fictional scenario is going on.  When you see Arnold holding an automatic machine gun in each hand gunning down bad guys left and right (even tho we know it's bullshit) because of his physique and because of his tough guy persona you are willing to suspend disbelief because of how he looks.  You think ""hey if there was someone who could do this he'd look like this guy"".    When I see a 110 lbs chick throwing around a 200 lbs man I can't help but think ""No way, I don't buy that"".  The only exception in entertainment, for me, was Cynthia Rothrock, who made a bunch of B movie martial arts flicks but she was believable because of how skilled and how fit she was.  So when I see a skinny toothpick lead female protagonist with a huge rack who is supposed to be this gorgeous knockout girl and she's tough as nails throwing around a bunch of guys I just have a hard time getting behind that lead character.  Even Rhonda Rousey, the UFC female champ, is built like an athlete.  She's got the muscle definition in her arms and shoulders, she cuts weight to make 135, so not a small girl, and she looks like she can kick ass.  Rhonda is still a good looking woman but she's also very fit and defined and she looks the part of someone who can kick ass.  A dainty model type girl just doesn't fit the part for me.    I don't know if I'm making any sense but part of the appeal in gaming to me is buying into the idea that a person like this main character can do what the developer has them doing.  Like any good form of entertainment, I want to suspend disbelief, get invested and forget about real life for a few hours.  Part of that is getting me to buy into what I'm seeing.  Some games, like league of legends, I could care less what character I pick but action oriented games with a good deal of focus on story make me lean toward male leads.  It's the same with men too, if you look at action movies or most lead men in games (aside from JRPG characters) they're not little toothpick guys.  They, generally speaking, look like they can kick some ass."

The rise of f2p like Dota and LoL is probably due to people not wanting to pay so much for one single game.

InsideGaming,2sjapy,Fredthefree,3,Thu Jan 15 19:20:06 2015 UTC,"This is the third time i see those podcast and i love the IG crew already, I understand the Megaman thing you are saying up there, based on you ""rules"" (which are not perfect) i think the correct game for them should be wait a second... ta da da da!!!  ---------------------------DOOM II------------------------------  But no the actual levels from the main classic game or wad (File extension for custom maps), they should try some good community maps that are awesome. my suggestion are:  1 ) Nova the Birth: ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pc/msdos/games/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/nova.zip  2) http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?file=themes/hr/hr2final.zip  3) http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?file=levels/doom2/Ports/d-f/fth666.zip  THERE ARE BETTER PEOPLE THAT CAN POINT TO BETTER WAD, this are just some i have played lately.  This are all official website links, just download unzip and right click open with launcher, or copy on the respective wad folder if wanna play online in services such as Zdaemon (which is awesome)  I think this is better to launch the game on a port such as zdoom, but that's entirely up to you, there are other port that help improve the graphics and the violence in other ways... but zdoom remains the best one, here the Zdoom website for that one:  http://zdoom.org/Download  (it can be kind of hard to install...i dunno, but almost any ape can do it)  The steam package can be adapted to any port.  This goes for anyone out here actually that would like a GREAT GAME, what i like about doom is a phenomenon i call the dopamine effect, as we get older we want games that load faster and do things fast because is kind like jerking, especially if you are playing between work schedules and stuff (not that you should), doom II is perfect for that, and here is why:  -cheat codes (made the game cool if you like shooting, it can be LSD addictive) iddqd, idkfa, idclip, iddt, idbeholdi, idbeholdl  -screen load FAST and you can change leves with idclev ## if are bored of map. (Games today don't load fast enough for me)  -first person shooters are just awesome in podcasts.  -community maps are a whole other dimension to the game, and you will never run out wads or fun.  -is better than cocaine.  -DOOM IS THE BEST GAME EVER PERIOD."

InsideGaming,2sjrp1,Brunky89890,3,Thu Jan 15 20:02:32 2015 UTC,"I can definitely agree with this. Although it will never go away, I can personally say I will never put down money to pre order after Destiny. Got the Digital Guardian pack and though I had my fun with the game I got really BURNT out after a couple months. I enjoy destiny and all but I spent 100 dollars on what I imagined would have been a plethora of content and extras when I should have just picked up a standard copy a couple days after. Unless it is a game made by Rockstar or Bethesda, I will definitely want several days for multiple video and text reviews to surface on the game. Hype gets preorders for sure and sometimes you shouldn't set your expectations too high because you'll more than likely be let down."
InsideGaming,2sjrp1,Lemonjib,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:45:59 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Companies such as Bethesda and Rockstar I feel can be trusted to take the time to make sure the game is finished. To say don't preorder any games at all seems narrow minded when clearly there are still many teams of talented people that are not content with putting out a bad or unfinished game.
InsideGaming,2sjrp1,patrickgilln7,1 point,Thu Jan 15 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"Pre-ordering games is equivalent to paying a pastry chef to bake you a cake for one's birthday week's in advance but without knowing if the cake will taste good, if it looked the way you wanted it to or if it will even arrive on time for the day that the chef promised it would arrive on.  My friend pre-ordered the Last Guardian when it was first announced around 6 years ago and I don't think the game (in its current unknown state) will even remotely resemble of what was envisioned by gamers all those years ago."
InsideGaming,2sjrp1,hyfrehyfre,1 point,Fri Jan 16 13:14:41 2015 UTC,"I think preordering is deceitful, there is no grantee for the consumer whatsoever, and because Entertainment uses that ""fine line"" that constitutes our universal right of free speech, then is when it wrecks my brain to think there is no limit on what constitutes a quality product other than free market demand of such products, in other words what it is considered ACEPTABLE today, might not be the same tomorrow, as now we are being charged for demos and nobody cares might be a good example. Program obsolescence of media products, that's the problem."
InsideGaming,2sjrp1,insanetwig,1 point,Fri Jan 16 14:58:04 2015 UTC,"Is there a ""movement"" against this? Or just a general thought that pre-orders are a more archaic idea?  The reason pre-orders currently exist is because it helps brick and mortar establishments (gamestop, best buy, etc.) correctly predict how many copies they should order from the game publisher to have day 1. This is why we generally receive sales data on this number as opposed to actual consumer sell through, since it's inflated.  That being said, there is definitely an interesting conversation to be made with the rise of digital downloads and online store fronts decreasing the need for the concept of ""pre-order now"".  I don't think pre-orders are really hurting anyone, so I see no reason they actually have to go away. That is unless pre-ordering the game gives the consumer an exclusive in-game item that actually gives them a leg up over other players, that is just plain silly."
InsideGaming,2sjrp1,Montezum,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:10:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a movement against this."

InsideGaming,2sjrp1,Montezum,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:31:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like that thread is confusing the idea of pre-orders with the negligence of devs/pubs putting out buggy games. Purchases are a choice whether you make it early or later. Have a problem with a dev/pub putting out shit games? Stop buying them. Vote with your dollars.  Pre-order has nothing to do with anything except bonuses and ensuring you can get a copy on time.  What a silly ""movement"", pre-order is a choice, don't do it if you don't trust them."

InsideGaming,2sj6x0,alexaka1,2,Thu Jan 15 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"I still hate that this is being brought up. As an adult male gamer, I don't care that much about the sex of a character as long as women aren't being oversexualized and men not being too 'bro-dude'. Why can't we just all be like the guys that made Infamous First Light, who, when asked the question why they chose Fetch (a female character) as the lead for the game, responded that they didn't even care about her sex and only cared about it when it was brought up. All they cared about was make a game with an interesting character as protagonist, fans liked Fetch, so they made the game about her. Hope this brings some discussion to the podcast, love it guys!"
InsideGaming,2sj6x0,Krypton-115,1 point,Thu Jan 15 17:34:34 2015 UTC,God bless those yoga pants :-D But yes I agree with you. Fetch is a really good character imo. She is completely free of all the judgements that are going on right now.  Clementine might be a good one too. She is a child so she is taboo for all things sexist. So they had a lot of freedom to work with and she eventually turned out to a strong female character.
InsideGaming,2sj6x0,Kitty3feet,2,Thu Jan 15 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"I think its funny how you said ""Liberation did, but Aveline could've also been a man, the story would've been the same basically..."". Yet you seem to be arguing that there should always be a female option in a game. Those are two contradictory statements in my opinion. You seem to think that playing as a female character makes things different, yet, you pointed out that in a game where the main character is female, you could've been a man and the game would've been no different.   It doesn't matter if you play as a guy or a girl in a game. The experience is almost exactly the same. Would you have cared if chaser was actually a girl? No, because that doesn't change anything about the game. Did you care that Aveline was a girl? Apparently not because it didn't change how the game played. You even in fact said that it doesn't change the gameplay, so who cares if you play as a girl? In most cases, it purely cosmetic anyways so it doesn't make a difference.  And even when girls are characters, it always turn into a bitching and moaning competition about how oversexualized she is or some shit. Bayonetta, I'm looking at you.   It's nice to have the option to play as a girl every once in a while but it's not needed. If the opposite was true, where you always play as a girl, and wish to play as a guy, it would be nice but not needed.   I understand where you're trying to come from with the mass effect bit and that's a part I agree with you. If the game becomes altered, such as in fallout, where playing as a different sex actually can change gameplay with those black widow perks or whatever, then that's cool. But in most cases, it shouldn't really matter what sex you play as, you should just worry about if the game is fun or not. The end."
InsideGaming,2sj6x0,Kitty3feet,1 point,Thu Jan 15 18:23:27 2015 UTC,"Now Fallout I totally forgoz about. Yeah that had gender specific perks, but nobody cared back then. Now if they are told a few pixels are missing, everybody flips out.  As for Aveline, I'm not sure what I was trying to say there. Maybe that most of the time it doesn't matter even for the story, what your gender is. But bow i remember, if you dress as a noblewoman, you can sorta seduce people and distract them. So at least they tried to bring the best out of it.  In the end, there will be people bitching about something, like me now :-P, but if nothing stops the devs from putting the option in, for female characters, then I say put it in there just so that people will shut up. While they're there they should put in articles about ethics in game journalism. This joke for me never gets old :-D"
InsideGaming,2sj6x0,Xahero,2,Thu Jan 15 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you're right about having the option in games like call of duty, just for variety's sake that is. And you're sure as hell right about people worrying over pixels nowadays. Whether it's how many pixels there are, what gender those pixels represent, and what a pixel is doing to another pixel. But like you said, people will always find something to bitch over."
InsideGaming,2sj6x0,Xahero,1 point,Thu Jan 15 21:25:32 2015 UTC,"Also, a lot of people claim that Bayonetta is not sexist for the same reason. Because she is aware of her ""sexual benefits"", and she uses them to her advantage. But on the other hand I kind of think, that it's still some dude writing the script and thinking:"" Yeah and then she drops her hair, and boom, softcore porn."" So yes I agree with you on that one."
InsideGaming,2sj6x0,hyfrehyfre,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"In Bayonetta's defense, I think people are forgetting the character was designed in Japan. We really can't & shouldn't hold the makers of Japanese made titles to our standards (not the word I wanted to use but it's late & it'll do for now) the female characters there are different from ours. The action ones are very powerful in manga, anime & games as well as with ideal body features. I've lived in Japan for a few years so I saw firsthand what it's like there.   I really hate that this entire topic about women vs male leads is even a thing, a dev really should be able to create a game with whatever they think is relevant to their story. Race, gender, sexuality, religion shouldn't be important unless is critical to the games story. At least that's how I see it.  I love playing as women in games because growing up, I've played as enough men. Female characters are bad ass and I love it when a person doesn't think much of that character because it's a woman...until I kick ass or their ass with her."
InsideGaming,2sj6x0,-SambaL-,1 point,Fri Jan 16 08:40:46 2015 UTC,"We can all agree Japan is weird, but I think this problem only concerns the western world. To my understandig Japan doesn't give two shits about girls in games. Only the west keeps bitching about it. I think Bayonetta is still sexist though. I mean come on. Some camera angles in 2. It's inches away of being straight up pornographic. Also I think Platinum Games is a western studio, not oriental. I may be wrong though, I'm not sure. Correct me!"

Why can't they just plug PS4's HDMI output to the HDMI input port of Xbox One? Heck, that's what I did since my TV only has one HDMI port. Kind of an irony though, ""in order to play your PS4 you have to power on the Xbox first lol"""
InsideGaming,2sg5h9,BakaTakasugi,0,Sun Jan 18 23:22:40 2015 UTC,"This episode was one of the funniest I've seen in a long fuckin' time. Great job whoever wrote this script.   Yeah, I know, ""Nintendo make real systems that can challenge the other current gen consoles"", but I mean come on, if you can't get third party titles on a goddamn console, you can't expect it to successfully compete. And releasing a bunch of titles that seem to only appeal to /r/games isn't the way to go.   People on the internet often seem to forget that they are the vocal minority when it comes to declaring which games are ""good"" and which aren't."
InsideGaming,2sg5h9,Black_Nerd,4,Wed Jan 14 23:12:38 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that it's just a running joke
InsideGaming,2sg5h9,kmnekhoo,4,Thu Jan 15 01:02:22 2015 UTC,"You must not understand their comedy then. Also, who the hell would've thought that IG would take something seriously? They're last daily was literally on porn statistics for consoles. Are you that bitchy to say ""Oh man, I can't believe someone else thinks differently than me. WELL FUCK THEM FOR THINKING DIFFERENTLY THEN ME, THEYRE WRONG."" Anyways, I can confirm that it IS a running gag to make fun of Nintendo as I watch them very often.   I also forgot about how much they hated playing the smash game and the new Mario kart. I remember how they ripped on it just so hard and were absolutely DESTROYING Nintendo over all the gameplay flaws. Oh wait, that didn't fucking happen because they enjoyed playing the game. They're jokes aren't coming from a place of ignorance or hatred as they know the brand well enough, especially Adam, to be able to crack jokes at it from time to time. Just because you're some pussy who's against any joke being made about some company that he decided to allege himself with doesn't mean that their jokes are crass and hateful. They are not being disingenuous by making fun of something they enjoy.   Also, if you're so seriously worked up in a fit of rage that you considered unsubscribing from them because they made fun of a company that you consider yourself an appendage of, even though all they want is your money, then you should go right ahead because you, my good sir, are the ignorant and disingenuous one here.   Also, don't make fun of Xbone, PC, Call of Duty, or Battlefield if you can't take a god damn joke yourself. Kinda being a hypocritical jackass if you ask me. Now please, tell me how I'm stupid and that my opinion doesn't matter. Then continue to tell me how IG is a bunch of bad guys who hate Nintendo and move on about your miserable life continuing think such lies."

I'm glad you realized you were overreacting to the situation and are able to look at it from a much clearer perspective. Unfortunately, they can only focus on so much in an IG Daily and sometimes they do have to gloss over things. It's unfortunate, yes, but not the end of the world."
InsideGaming,2sg5h9,Kitty3feet,2,Thu Jan 15 03:11:17 2015 UTC,"Their hate was towards a lot of stupid decisions they made. No AC adapter is stupid. A brand new 3DS that has new features when we're not out of this generation yet is stupid. Amiibo news was just kind of boring but whatever. Then there's a lot of games no non Nintendo fan is super-excited for, that's what they meant by ""mediocre news"". The only things I really enjoyed from the direct were Splatoon and Fire Emblem."

InsideGaming,2sg5h9,Montezum,14,Thu Jan 15 09:06:32 2015 UTC,"You're right. A 3 year old funny, but intentionally hyperbolic video referring to a policy that was removed in 2012 does prove your point.   I'm not sure why you're trying to get everyone pissed off at everything Machinima the Company does on a regular basis. I'm the first one here that will admit we've made HUGE mistakes in the past, but I also think we've made a ton of changes since then. Is Machinima perfect? No.  But they've been good enough to let us do pretty much whatever we want for 3 years. They paid our salary and let us launch the IG channel.   And now that they want to do a survey (which LEGALLY REQUIRES that kind of language) to find out how fans interact with digital media, you're upset?"
InsideGaming,2sg5h9,harmonygrits,-9,Wed Jan 14 23:19:09 2015 UTC,"It's not a survey to ""find out how fans interact with digital media"". It's a list of questions that, if you match what they are looking for, will hook you up with another Machinima program.   But I don't work there and I don't pay for this content, so...whatever."
InsideGaming,2sg5h9,Montezum,13,Thu Jan 15 00:26:54 2015 UTC,"Did you even fill out the survey? It literally asks questions about where people are watching videos, what networks they like, and how many videos they watch.   The other Machinima program is more surveys which - if you're a member - will ask similar questions and award prizes once a month.   But I guess you're right. Everything we do has an ulterior motive and is intrinsically evil because Oney said so 3 years ago."
InsideGaming,2sg5h9,harmonygrits,4,Thu Jan 15 00:33:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big fan of Machinima as a whole, especially after the whole Broteam thing, (I only really watch IGD and InsideGaming) but I think you're making a big to-do over nothing."

InsideGaming,2sgyjj,Kitty3feet,1 point,Thu Jan 15 04:12:02 2015 UTC,"It was fine in the first two games but now it just feels like the way you said it. Personally for me, Electronic Arts is just getting worse and worse with their videogames when it comes to this type of stuff.  I'm not going to get any of the DLCs for Sims 4, I didn't get any at all after I went legit and bought Sims 3 because all the expansions didn't really add anything when I had a go through all of them."
InsideGaming,2sgyjj,hyfrehyfre,1 point,Thu Jan 15 07:30:26 2015 UTC,"Nah don’t say that, it’s a game that’s based on a different kind of target than yours that all.  But i agree in other ways SIMS is a LAZZY game, so many years to implement some cool building options, more detailed and shit, but they never did and i purchase that one because i thought that was better at this point, but you know what? IT IS NOT."
InsideGaming,2sgyjj,Kitty3feet,2,Thu Jan 15 18:27:35 2015 UTC,"That's why the whole game is bullshit, it's literally a new skinned version of sims 3 with a couple new options. It's just lazy and that's why it's bullshit.   I'm not saying that it's a bad game, though it's not even really a game it's just a life simulator, I'm just saying that their developers are lazy for adding so little to the addition.  Edit: added the last part."
InsideGaming,2sgyjj,lava_lice,1 point,Thu Jan 15 18:30:46 2015 UTC,"It's not even a couple of new options, it's a major downgrade from the previous Sims game. The only thing I really enjoy about this one is the new way of building using the push and pull system for rooms, but in a turn it makes it harder to create roofs or small simple things like pillars using walls.  I'm also rather annoyed by the removal of the texture designer which I used ALL the time for everything simply because you could change something if you didn't like it, but now it's back to the old Sims 2 system of you use what you get."

I mean way else would the suits have scratched out eyes? the first one we see barely has half a head left! Anyways my theory was that he (Tony) was still scared from what happened in New York and needs the security that the suits give him but he also couldn't have stood letting Pepper go. So he quietly collected all of the suits that had ""blown up"" and took the back to his shop. This is where Ultron comes in (also if you think about it, the suits were pretty much autonomous in Iron Man 3, so he must have been working on it already) he designs a system that will do the protecting for him and on a much larger scale.  In short he makes Ultron out of old armor at first so he doesn't have to start from scratch but mostly so he can spend more time with Pepper."

The game is based on Norse mythology, showing the conflict between the gods Odin and Loki and the buildup to Ragnarok, the end of the world. Built on the Unreal Engine, the game allows players to explore a fully realized Viking world.  Upon release Rune received mixed though generally positive reviews. A standalone expansion to the game, called Rune: Halls of Valhalla, was released in 2001. It as well as its expansion was also ported to Linux by Loki Software. Ryan C. Gordon, a former Loki employee, would also later port Human Head's 2006 title Prey. A port to the PlayStation 2 was also released under the title Rune: Viking Warlord in 2001. The game was re-released digitally under the name Rune Classic.    Image i     Interesting: Rune: Halls of Valhalla | Betrayal at Falador | Rune Factory   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

InsideGaming,2s8ypz,TheSolarSentinel,2,Tue Jan 13 15:15:50 2015 UTC,"The thing is, people will buy shitty games, whether they know it's shitty or not.

I'm sick of having to wait for updates for a game to become good. Fallout 2 was good the first time I slid it ever so gingerly into my quivering disc tray, and it has stayed tight and eager ever since. that's where the bar is set for me.

InsideGaming,2s26tp,dj_smu,2,Mon Jan 12 03:04:56 2015 UTC,The Problem with Dead Island is that people still haven't forgiven the Devs for that very first trailer. Because that said trailer had expectations going through the roof until the real thing dropped.

Basically, I help the IG and ETC teams create and execute programming strategies on Machinima and the IG and ETC channels. That's everything from huge, overarching ideas (like talking about channel tone) and tiny details (like discussing the merits of penises in video thumbnails).   In addition to that, I work with our Marketing and Sales teams at Machinima to make sure that the sales campaigns we work on make sense for the channel, the brands, and the personalities. Not every idea is the right fit, and we have to get creative to make everyone happy (the client, the sales team, and the producers of the show aka Adam, Bruce, Ricky, Eliot, et al).  When I'm free, I get to occasionally be on the podcast or Q&A, which is always fun!"

To resolve this you should narrow the terminology so that the question of semantics comes less in to play. If a movie enthusiast fits your criteria for someone who engages with the medium of film more seriously than your average movie goer, doesn't it seem logical to refer to someone as a video game enthusiast? Or book enthusiast? That seems to clear up the confusion, because the simplest way to define ""gamer"" is ""one who games."" The simpler term refers to the entirety of a group while the more complex term refers to a narrower sub section of that group."

InsideGaming,2rurhr,panos_ch,2,Fri Jan 9 13:22:10 2015 UTC,"Most triple A titles aren't trying to be art, they're just trying to give consumers a decent experience and make some money. Smaller Indie games try to express themselves as art much more, with limited results. Games have always really been about the experience, though, and while a story is appreciated, it must be implemented carefully.   A good example of a REAL story in a game is the bioshock series. It has an extremely limited use of cutscenes, so all of the plot and exposition is revealed through the gameplay. Cutscenes are just sort of a lazy way to put in a story in an easier way, or at least that's how I feel."
InsideGaming,2rurhr,bigdavidp,1 point,Fri Jan 9 14:38:14 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, although you could argue that (even if they don't intend to do so) the triple A games form of art is that of giving you an good experience, just as a painting that is truly beautiful evokes an emotion in you, maybe not because you find a hiding meaning or belief in it, but simply because it is beautiful."

InsideGaming,2rurhr,stalkerSRB,1 point,Fri Jan 9 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"is this question for IG? I'm pretty sure they've expressed their opinion on this. me personally, I consider gaming an artform, though that thought only comes up occasionally when people argue about what creators are entitled to make in their games. most games just follow a formula and aren't very artistic. though games overall have the ability for the creator to put messages/beliefs and anything that can be put into a book or painting into the game. whether that means an indie game with little interaction or a straight up ""movie game"" still applies to the ""games"" umbrella. my opinion on games that follow that, it can vary. if games only use it as part of the experience then it can be 10/10. if games use that as purely the experience of the game then the whole thing can be a bit of a joke. I'm still glad that people are trying new things in games though, and these types of elements in games can add a greater depth."

If I could recommend anything though I'd say just let Joel play alone long enough to advance his dark romance with Munt.   Giving your save to us (or whoever the community may be) sounds interesting but I'm not sure if it would be the same or not. But by all means, if it's the only way we can get more Sims, go ahead.  Just knowing there's more down the line gets me hopeful.   Also, sorry for saying you guys don't care about the games you play (even though I meant it sarcastically) it seems a lot of people here were strangely offended by that, but what should I expect, this is reddit.   Edit: Also if I may recommend a shitty game myself, why not games made for children, like Club Penguin or Poptropica? No download necessary just make an account and login. I think it would be hysterical watching you guys cuss out little penguin children and then get wrecked by them in a tubing race. Just for a one episode kind of thing, not a full series of course."

From what I've seen from the guys at Inside Gaming, they don't seem the type to beat a dead horse.  So yeah. It was a fun series for a while and we've all had laughs at Cunts, Tunts and Munts misadventures, but it's time to move away from that."

Yes majority of the viewers want to see more of the series but i remember IG talking about it in one of their podcasts and the amount of views to keep the series alive just aren't there, like they would love to make more just for the O.G viewers, but they aren't going to make videos if they aren't going to hit a certain quota with views. Im not exactly sure which podcast it is that they talk about it, but i recommend downloading their podcasts and having a flip through to find it because bruce pretty much perfectly answers your question about the sims"
InsideGaming,2rxvx1,pingustits,2,Sat Jan 10 07:55:09 2015 UTC,"Their comedy comes from making stories about their gameplay and making fun of the game. It's extremely hard to make fun of a GOOD game especially without being ostracized by the community that likes that game if you do. This is most easily done with shitty, pathetic, crappy games.  Not everyone can pull off interesting game plays of good games unless there are certain conditions met. Such as, there is a demand for watch that specific game, like you suggested Half Life 2. If someone wanted to watch gameplay of that then they'd go watch a Let's Play of it. Not a bunch of comedians who like to be pessimistic and sarcastic about the games they play and don't really care about the story or conventions of the game.   Now, the Tunt series WAS a dead horse being beaten into oblivion. They couldn't stand the series anymore at that point. They're was no new content to show their audience and therefore the game had been tapped dry of anything creative. Even Munt had nothing new to offer since the game had ZERO upgrades from Sims 3. So when the glits and gloss of the new characters wore off then they realized there was nothing more to do with the series until new content came out to play since it was all the same. THIS IS WHY THEY DONT PLAY THE SIMS ANYMORE. That and it isn't hitting their own view goal that they set for themselves."

The 2010s saw a huge surge in the use and popularity of 3D films and 3D televisions and a few people (not as much as people in the game industry referring to VR) said it was the future of cinema and television. But it isn't, it's just a gimmick with only big action films kind of making it work. In gaming, I think VR is just a gimmick and not the future and I'm guessing Adam says this as if all games will be VR in the future, but the majority of people play games casually and for relaxation, VR headsets attacks the senses and isn't what you might call a relaxing experience (I know it depends on the game, but even then it can be quite overwhelming. I do see VR as part of the gaming industry in the future just like motion sensor has its place with the Wii and the Kinect.  P.S.

InsideGaming,2rqtoi,zodiactemplar,6,Thu Jan 8 17:26:57 2015 UTC,"Since you guys talked about gamers being fat and diets, I wanted to pass by and share my current story. I have been a gamer and anime fan pretty much all my life thanks to my older brother and I am fat, a walking stereotype one would say. A little bit more than a year ago I started to diet and exercise and lost a lot of weight, I was happy about this changes and being honest I felt the same but looked way better. At some time in 2014 I got really depressed because of.. reasons... and pretty much said ""fuck it"" to my diet and exercise routines, now on 2015 I am back to my old weight. After a medical checkup I can say that I am a healthy man but fat, that may be attributed to my age (23) or It's just a ticking bomb waiting to blow up. Now I do think that me being fat and me liking anime and video games has absolutely nothing to do with each other, I am fat because I have terrible eating habits and being a gamer has nothing to do with it.  I believe that people should not care about stereotypes, therefore should not take any actions on the ""gamers are fat"" stereotype whatsoever, who gives a fuck what people think?. That said I do wish to have a healthy life and all of us who feed the fire of the bad stereotypes should take more care about our ourselves not for the gaming community but for our own good.   Now to say that I believe on my own words, I can't say that I am over my ""depression"" but my brain is over making excuses to not return to my diet and exercise routines so 2015 will be the year of getting back in shape. My only say on how to get back in shape is that there is no magical recipe, the ""diet + exercise"" formula will never change but you have to find what kind of diet and exercise works for you, I am fortunate to have found mine so I'm worst for not taking advantage of it xD.   This comment may disappear on the endless stream of reddit, still I would like to say that you guys are inspirational in a lot of ways. I may not have been inspired by you guys to get back in shape but you do make me feel like I am not alone for some reason. If any of you may remember my username, I shall post a second part to this story in about 6 months and I hope that not only the IG guys but the community itself can get either a smile on their faces or support on the journey to a healthy life."
InsideGaming,2rqtoi,NeuerOrdner,1 point,Fri Jan 9 00:01:05 2015 UTC,"Well, First off, cheers for shareing your story mate. I've never been really fat but I was a chubby motherfucker when I was younger, started to go into Martial Arts and become a fit motherfucker.   I can tell you, however, that especially doing sport is a very good way to combat your depression or general life-fatigue, at least for me.   Sports give you clear goals you can strife for,which are allmost allways achieveable. They give you reasons to leave your room and do something. You can do sports alone, focusing on your gym-clarity/runners-high or you can do sports with/agaisnt others. You will see results instantly after you finish your workout (muscle-exhaustion) and you will ""feel"" that you did something.  And the most important part about sports for me, is, that you have to learn about yourself. You are forced to listen to your body and have to spend a lot of time getting to know your body and your thoughts during training. Sports taught me a lot about my body and my mental build.  Anyway, keep it /fit, mate and do inform yourself before doing any routines. Hope you make it through your depression."

InsideGaming,2rqtoi,FarFromPro,1 point,Fri Jan 9 00:28:06 2015 UTC,it's because they have other jobs.
InsideGaming,2rqtoi,XFXOmar122,1 point,Fri Jan 9 01:38:07 2015 UTC,I posted this on the video then i seen that there was a comment with 97 up votes saying something about destiny being shit so I posted it here. I think advertisements are the better because the fact that someone likes and watches your content you should be flattered or at least thats how I feel about my content however I watch Inside gaming all the time and I have got more entertainment out of them then I have most movies so its hard to say which will work better.﻿

However this is due to the fact that I currently have much more time than money, and I am sure that if the two were reversed, I would a) rather pay the $5 a month, or b) not watch content at all, as I lack the required leisure time to watch an hour and 11 minutes of guys talking about how youtube works.  Typing this has made me realise just how much faster I type while tipsy, which to be honest, kind of startles me﻿"

Now to my post - I am 26 and for pretty much my entire life I have not been able to break 115lbs (I'm 5'6) so basically I am a skinny bastard the complete opposite of what was mentioned in this video and after watching this I really wanted to get some tips either for the IGStaff or the community on how I could possible gain some kind of weight.   I don't starve myself, I used to snack out like crazy while also eating too much fast food (also rice and beans Spanish families lol) I even tried working out with a buddy of mine who is a gym nut but all that did was help me loose the little fat I did have and cause me to look even thinner. I know James made the recommendation to not focus on a number but I have had the goal of getting to at least 145lbs before i die lol.  Any response will be greatly appreciated thanks!"

InsideGaming,2rqtoi,ecrurudesby,1 point,Thu Jan 8 20:00:58 2015 UTC,"I made this account to tell Adam I did not appreciate of find funny in the slightest his spoiler on GTAV. I have not played the game yet because it is not out on PC yet and I want what I expect to be the best version of the game, which I think you have yourself said it will be. And as someone who I think said they enjoyed the game's single player immensely (paraphrasing there) I really don't know why you chose to do that (you really wanted to know what James chose? Or you just wanted to fuck with people for a joke?). I just hope that in hindsight you regret it.  Maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill here, getting angry like this, but it is a video game, and this is Inside Gaming."
InsideGaming,2rqtoi,FishoD,4,Fri Jan 9 01:24:13 2015 UTC,"The spoiler is minor and I revealed nothing about the actual story. It's a random gameplay decision that affects pretty much nothing. If that small tidbit stops you from the playing what is actually worth playing (30+ hours of missions, random jobs and heists) then you are depriving yourself for absolutely no good reason."
InsideGaming,2rqtoi,KrispyTaco,3,Fri Jan 9 15:51:12 2015 UTC,"What you revealed does not seem at all minor or random to me; and it does seem relevant to the story but we best not go down that road any further or you may end up giving us a full synopsis.  I don't know why you're trying to put me on the defensive presuming your spoiler will prevent me from playing the game when I said in my post ""I want"" rather than ""I wanted"". The fact remains you spoiled at least part of the end of GTAV out of spite or maybe just a momentary lapse in judgement; and the only person depriving anyone of anything would be you.  Cue downvotes"
InsideGaming,2rqtoi,innerrage8,1 point,Sat Jan 10 00:07:54 2015 UTC,"Nah no downvotes for you buddy, I came here to mention the same spoiler-like comment. Many, many people do not buy stuff right away the second it comes out (I'm waiting for the PC version as well and even after that I'll wait for a discount and patching because I'm a smart consumer #TBfanboy). Even though it is not really specific, just the fact that I know I will have to do something like that can change my view on all the previous gameplay because I will have it in my mind therefore I might not connect to the characters at all."
InsideGaming,2rqtoi,romeozor,1 point,Sun Jan 11 11:25:25 2015 UTC,"As someone who's played through the game several times, I can tell you from first hand experience that you won't be affected by this knowledge at all while playing the game. It really isn't that big of a spoiler...I mean, the GTA games are about thugs, murderers, drug dealers, maniacs, sex fiends, etc...what else would you expect to happen to these characters? So something happens to one of the characters, the game isn't going to be ruined for you, I promise."
InsideGaming,2rqtoi,dat_username_tho,0,Wed Jan 14 08:21:11 2015 UTC,"I was listening to this, and you guys started talking about fitness, and I thought it was awesome. I believe it was James that brought up the point that you have to manipulate the drive in the video game to real life? I completely agree, if you have the drive to pick up a controller and do a raid on destiny for 6 hours, it's not much harder to pick up some dumbbells. I used to be about 50% body fat, all I did was eat cake and play Halo 3, COD, GTA4 etc. with friends. there were lot of different factors that made me get off my ass, but one of them was I was tired of feeling like a slug compared to the guy on the screen. so in about 6 months I dropped over 100 pounds, and when I went back to school for senior year- no one knew who I was, 2nd best feeling ever. After all that I wanted more out of life so I joined the Marines (1st best). I would post a before and after picture- but I'm new to reddit so I have no clue how to.  I've watched you guys for a while, I like your honesty, your open-mindedness, and your sense of humor (it's very similar to the military's just a little tamer). I wish you all the best, keep up the awesome work."

Machinima probably won't try to change anything, they see what IG is doing, and paying very close attention, but they'll probably just leave them be because they have such a dedicated fan base and IG videos I think are receiving just as many views as Machinima videos with less subs.   The point they made in the podcast was that it is a very risky move to turn fan donations and ad revenue into a steady source of income because they have to walk on eggshells around everyone.

InsideGaming,2rrube,leosky94,2,Thu Jan 8 19:28:59 2015 UTC,i wouldn't call it a fully american thing (but yes cultural is a part of it) but the younger fans (20's & teens) have grown up in a world of fast food and everything to readily available so cooking unless it was taught at a young age by family never really carried over.
InsideGaming,2rrube,ImpsCorner,1 point,Thu Jan 8 19:40:17 2015 UTC,"I just found healthy food that I really like and that's what I eat. I realised that I love vegetables and certain meats. So I make salads with ham or vegetable soups.  James has said this as well, find foods that are healthy and ones you like and stick to them. I can cook okay, it all comes down to time. If I have plenty of time I can  make something big (like the soups that I mentioned). If I'm in a rush, I will make a quick salad and get some healthy bread with it."

I mean if you are seeing they they are buying wide range of vegetables , chicken or meat not nuggets stuff or prepackaged stuff. ,species and maybe  Flour . you will have a general idea that these people can cook.   The new generation aren't good with that well maybe because most women now work so there is no time for cooking expect weekends. because that why I try to cook with my mom often so I wont have trouble with a wife that cannot cook :."

I was a heel and formed a stable of other heel wrestlers. I'm still currently the champion of the backyard wrestling organization I used to wrestle with.

I have a friend that keeps his copy at my place cuz he doesnt want it to fuck up his studies cuz he is that addicted.  Other possible time sinkers I recommend are: Jedi Outcast and Academy, Metro 2033 and Last light, Company of Heroes series, NFS: Underground 1 or Most wanted (if you want racing), Batman Arkham series (play it as a marathon and you will lose probably 3 days untill you finish all the missions and find all the hidden stuff) and finally if you want an RPG that will eat your free time: PATH OF EXILE. Its an awesome game. You can play it solo or with friends its your choice, the game is free and is better then Diablo 3 vanilla (dont know with the DLC that came out is it still better since I havent played it since vanilla)"

(1 and 3, 2nd one is shit) and some crazy once I played when I got bored: Legoland (lego tycoon basically, but relaxing and simple), Jazz Rabbit 2 (hard to fine, I think you have to torrent it), Captain Claw (also hard to fine and old), the original Mafia game (not that web bullshit, I am talking about 3rd person mob game)....I said crazy cuz they are pretty old but they are still good and fun games (and will work on any system)"

I only had 1, my lamp would disappear for no reason and I would have to use Night vision (only in the 1st one, 3rd one I had no problems). Other then that, the game for me was great and I had no problems. There are mods to fix them, but like I said i never had really big problems so I never used mods. Basically the game is sort of, but not really, a Ukrainian Fallout knock off, with a great twist and a much better ending then Fallout 3. (again not biased at all :D)."

InsideGaming,2rgqhc,RavenBoy99,2,Tue Jan 6 01:27:14 2015 UTC,It only spoils it for people who don't want it every year. You can't really spoil a game by releasing it every year. You spoil a game when you don't improve and change upon the last installation. It doesn't matter how long the development cycle is. If you can churn out new and fun experiences with relative upgrades that enhance your gameplay in a new way AND manage to release a new copy every year then I say go ahead and do it.
InsideGaming,2rgqhc,Kitty3feet,1 point,Tue Jan 6 12:26:39 2015 UTC,"it depends on the game really.  obviously everyone can agree that a rushed game will usually not be great, but yearly releases dont automatically mean rushed.  personally the way i feel about it, for single player games, where content rather than online play is the main draw, yearly releases just means more to play for fans, it can only be good, provided, as i said, that the games themselves maintain their level of quality, and manage to shake it up at least a little from game to game.  if you're not a huge fan, its honestly even better for you, cause you can just wait a year, and you'l.l get the previous years game for next to nothing on sale, you still get a yearly game, you're just a year behind.  thats the way i am with assasins creed, i like the series, but not enough to pre order or buy at $60, so i still havent played black flag, i already have it though, and by the time i get around to unity, ill be able to get it for $15 or so on sale.  all that said, there was 2 years between far cry 3 and 4, so just becuase they're already talking about settings doesnt mean that far cry 5 is a year away.  they're much more likely to do an smaller side release in 2015, like they did with blood dragon, and then far cry 5 will likely be in 2016"

InsideGaming,2rf2dr,Kitty3feet,1 point,Tue Jan 6 17:27:05 2015 UTC,"The thing is, stereotypes exist for a reason. I mean, not all Americans are fat and rich, but ask someone who doesn't live in America what a person who live in America looks like and they probably think of a fat, rich, white person. Sure, there are fat, rich, white people that are in America and that's why the stereotype exists but that's a minority of the actual population.  This is what I believe to be the equivalent to the weed discussion. Not every person who smokes weed is the stereotypical bratty know-it-all teenager, but, that is still the face of smoking weed unfortunately despite it being actually being a minority. This face of weed is also associated, though it is less now, with the slothful nature of human beings. Also thrown into that category is people who play videogames. For some reason, I've always found that people associate weed smokers with videogame playing.   Thus, if you're a giant company making videogames that directly markets it's products towards these people, you might as well pop a joke in at your playerbase because they a bunch of ""fat weed smoking pigs"" supposibly"

InsideGaming,2rabg8,ErictheQ7,-1,Sun Jan 4 20:24:59 2015 UTC,"You want to know how IG will play Deadly Premonition? Adam will click through everything and not understand it, Bruce will get really mad at Adam for clicking through everything and James will be kinda into it.   Deadly Premonition is a beautiful, idiosyncratic mess of a game but I don't think IG should make it their next series because it's a slow atmospheric game where the best part of it (the characters, the setting and the general weirdness) are non interactive while the gameplay is very bare bones and doesn't have a lot of variety so it'd be a lot of watching Adam drive somewhere and watch a cutscene.   Furthermore, there are already quite a few Deadly Premonition let's plays out there and its become a cult classic. One of the things I like about Inside Gaming is that they find weird broken games and drag them kicking and screaming onto twitch.   I'd recommend they take a look at Dark Void, Darkest of Days, Dead Effect, SiN Gold or Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth (admittedly CoC is also kind of a cult classic), all of those were shooters that tried and failed to reinvent the wheel but including some kind of gimmick and would probably work better with Inside Gamings comedic style than Deadly Premonition."

Personally, I like the idea of having guests in some of the podcasts to mix things up and keep the podcast fresh.   That said, Kevin in particular I'm not the biggest fan of. He sort of dominates the podcast, and it comes across as ""Kevin's cast feat. IG Crew"" rather than ""IG podcast feat. Kevin"". Perhaps Lawrence could have reigned him in a little and helped balance out the contributions from the guys.  I'm looking forward to more guest appearances on the podcast. I just hope it won't become a new guest every single podcast kind of thing. Maybe like a 50/50 split between podcasts with guest, and podcasts with just the IG Crew. That way it retains a level of consistency."

As you get more picky, the usual bullshit won't affect you that much, because you won't preorder them anymore, you won't play early access games, you won't buy the same franchise every year because you'll probably take months to finish them, you won't buy broken games and etc. I play very few games these days, like I did in the 90s but I enjoy it much more because of the limited time I have to play them.   Edit: What I meant to say by this is that if you choose to play games that are good, that are fixed and ready to play, even if they are not very new, your experience will almost always be great and therefore you'll probably enjoy playing games for a very long time."
InsideGaming,2r0whl,Montezum,1 point,Fri Jan 2 04:51:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do. I love video games, but recently they haven't been grabbing my attention ,or at least, keeping my attention. I used to love playing Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. Now they sort of just don't grab my attention any more because, I guess, I got the taste of the fun things you can do on a PC with all the mods and shit. I had to get rid of it though and lost the so called holy grail in my entertainment life. With no PC I had to go back to the console version, and it's just not as fun. I still haven't got a new PC but I can say one thing!! IF I WAKE UP NOT ENJOYING VIDEO GAMES OF ANY KIND!! I'LL MAKE MY OWN DAMN SHITTY GAME!! Yupp, I hope that I won't have to make a shitty game."
InsideGaming,2r0whl,JasonPNix,1 point,Fri Jan 2 08:02:00 2015 UTC,Depends on your own mind more than any other factors. If you tire of activities easily then it is almost inevitable that eventually you will stop enjoying playing video games but if you find the experience to be immersive and it happily can keep you occupied for an extended period of time you are much less likely to tire of video games

I do think that the difficulty could have been turned up, even on the hardest game mode its still not that challenging. I do wish the equipment system was a little more expansive as well. Also you will constantly be spamming R3 looking for objects.  But other than that straight forward leveling tiers, crafting and combat lead it to be an overall excellent game.  Was on sale on PSN last time I checked, but im sure anywhere you look right now you can find some kind of deal.  Imho worth it."

InsideGaming,2qptmg,Damen_Black,0,Mon Dec 29 21:40:16 2014 UTC,"I honestly sold the game back to Gamestop the day after I bought it. I'm probably, based on fanboy theory, going to get downvoted to hell, but here is my reasoning.   I was annoyed that I had to go back to the main menu to simply change the sex of the character, perhaps this is because they show a cut scene between choosing the sex and actually making your character. I would love to see the logic behind showing a whole other character than the one you're about to customize.   Mashing R3 to find all the pretties, all the time, till your thumb breaks. Seriously, they could have made treasure / secret finding a passive skill. Don't punish the player for trying to explore your world.  I would clear an area of enemy, only to have them ""POP!"" into existence right next to me while I was checking on things. No reasoning, no magic, just shitty programing. They could have at least made the enemy run in from the edges, or you know NOT pop out of thin air five feet from your character.  I understand these may seem like minor issues, however the R3 thing, and the popping enemies are factors that will be in the entirety of the gameplay, and were annoying enough that I couldn't stomach playing another minute of a supposed AAA title. In this day and age, I sadly, expect bugs, what I don't expect of a massive company and franchise with several titles under it's belt, is shitty mechanics.  P.S. I mention the sex on character selection thing because, how good of a start are we off to if a modern game has to go through loading menus to change your bits and bobs. I can't imagine it's too damn hard to program, as nearly every other modern, and some post, rpgs do it."

I've been finding the books less interesting and that's partly due to how much better the writing in the games have gotten.   Halo 4 is still a game I standby due to the SP campaign. I really liked the themes and storytelling angles 343 took and it was nice to see a Halo game embrace its expanded universe. So there are additional novels yes, I'm just not in a rush to read them."
InsideGaming,2qpgl4,IGAdam,3,Mon Dec 29 15:42:25 2014 UTC,"I feel the same way. Ghosts of Onyx was good, but there is just so much id like to actually see in-game. ADAM: What thing would you like/enjoy happening in Halo 5?"
InsideGaming,2qpgl4,MReyesG,5,Mon Dec 29 19:30:01 2014 UTC,"What the MCs role will be in the grand scheme of things. He's such an important character I can't see 343 just killing him off but at the same time, his story is going to have to come to a close.  I think they could do some real interesting time-travel type of story telling (either through flashbacks or wormhole Interstellar level types of parallels) and really push the theme of digital transcendence that they were playing with in H4."
InsideGaming,2qpgl4,IGAdam,2,Mon Dec 29 19:34:51 2014 UTC,"Have you been keeping up with the escalation comic? There have been about 13 issues and every 4 or 3 issues is its own story arc. One of the stories is set right after Halo 4 and talks about chief reuniting with blue team, the composers abyss, spartan team black, and the didact. Seems important for knowing the Halo 5 story. The other issues have stories about the Swords of Sanghellios, brute faction, and UNSC trying to get a treaty going. Terrorist Spartans within the new spartan program. The Spirit of Fire a little bit. A new bio weapon that was probably the same one in nightfall. ONI acting shady. Now the Janus Key and halsey with Jul Mdama. Sarah Palmer trying to hunt down both halsey and Jul.  Also since this is the ""Reclaimer"" saga it will heavily focus on the mantle and humanity and how chief is involved with humanities ascendance to where the precursors intended mankind to be. but since locke is a playable character and may not be the only other playable character for the campaign, this will probably draw away from chiefs story and focus on other important thing happening in the universe such as the things that happen in escalation.  So the real question is do you think halo 5 will draw away from the master chiefs story a little, a lot, or non at all and if it does where will the story go...or will everything involve the chief?"
InsideGaming,2qpgl4,Stimpiltan117,1 point,Tue Dec 30 09:21:20 2014 UTC,"I appreciate the feedback, and will probably just grab one every so often when I've nothing to read.  On the Halo 5 note, I agree with what you said a few episodes ago where you said basically MC and Cortana are going batshit crazy, and their view on humanity going ""Cynical AI"" like the Geth or Reapers from Mass Effect. Although it would bring the series to a close, I personally think it would be one I could live with. I remember how heartbroken I was at the end of Halo 3, and the ""WUT...."" moment when Halo 4 was announced. I fully trust 343 to kill it with Halo 5, I'm just a bit anxious as to the direction they will take the story.  To what you said about time travel/wormholes- I wouldn't be upset if 343 introduced the Bioshock-Infinite-style parallel. I'd emphasize Chief's choices (although the campaign has always been linear), and slowly sneak in the element of his consciousness. He is human, after all.  Not to dive too deep, but what if he CHOSE to follow his fellow Spartans to Reach when it fell? Could he have met his end battling there? Could a MC from another parallel save him? or another Cortana? They could go so many directions...and like you, I'm eager to see where it goes."

InsideGaming,2qoqo7,loganwebby,1 point,Mon Dec 29 14:41:51 2014 UTC,"Honestly, it depends on the game and how fast I get engrossed. With Skyrim I didn't like it at first and put it down for a year. I picked it back up and then played for 200 hours. With games like Uncharted or Far Cry, I usually get pulled in very quickly and binge play the whole campaign. So I get its just a matter of quality and time."

InsideGaming,2qmti0,R3zark,3,Sun Dec 28 18:27:18 2014 UTC,Machinima allow IG to put out their own content and they have freedom to be creative; one condition would be to keep the views up. I don't see anywhere in their videos 'content made for money'. Content is relevant to what is popular at the time and/or games that are hilariously bad to play.   IG interact with the fan base regularly and keep us all entertained. These guys do an amazing job and it would be naïve to think that they could do this without a few conditions from the company. I love what they do and believe the fan base would agree!
InsideGaming,2qmti0,kimrequired,2,Mon Dec 29 01:20:17 2014 UTC,"How would you suggest the make ""the money thing less prominent in future""?   Putting out content to make money is the reason IG is running, if they didn't do it for the money they would all be working crappy day jobs to fund one video a week (not saying IG wouldn't all land awesome other jobs but this comparison just kinda helps my point.), not saying they don't love their fans but we are also they're only source of income as well and frankly I am completely fine with that.  IG don't HAVE to livestream five days a week on twitch, they don't HAVE to participate in the subreddit, these kinds of things don't really make them comparatively any money but they just do it for the fans. So what if they have to sneak a midroll into the podcast (which they should never have to apologise for, anyone who complains about it obviously doesn't know how the world works.) and drop series which no one watches, as long as they keep that same IG magic and keep going that extra mile for the fanbase that's all I care about."
InsideGaming,2qmti0,TheManMountain,2,Sun Dec 28 19:17:55 2014 UTC,"The only way they can keep their jobs is to keep up the views. Don't be so naive about things.

And idk where you got that feeling from because I sure as hell don't feel that way."
InsideGaming,2qmti0,Kitty3feet,0,Sun Dec 28 18:35:35 2014 UTC,The IG crew don't get paid from the money earned from their videos. Views does not equal their waqe.
InsideGaming,2qmti0,Woodeecouk,2,Sun Dec 28 20:50:09 2014 UTC,"I know this, but they have to get views and make money for the company that employs them. That's their job."
InsideGaming,2qmti0,Kitty3feet,1 point,Mon Dec 29 02:09:21 2014 UTC,"i hate the feeling that IG is only making content for money/keeping there jobs   But that's kind of the point, though. Everybody works to make money and to keep our jobs so that we can make more money, we don't really work for ""fun"". We are the ones being entertained by their videos, so their entertainment is probably a secondary thought. Take a look at chaser, for example - they hated it but they made it through the end because we enjoyed watching it. If they are having fun doing their job but we are not being entertained, they won't have views and therefore less money and probably won't have a job anymore."
InsideGaming,2qmti0,Montezum,0,Sun Dec 28 23:58:38 2014 UTC,well they make content at a steady pace and it's always good and never feel rushed so i don't really see reasons to complain here.
InsideGaming,2qkc6p,NKLhaxor,7,Sat Dec 27 22:06:02 2014 UTC,"Honestly payday 2 would be fun if they knew what they were doing...   Seeing them fail over and over on the same part won't make it very entertaining. The only reason they played l4d2 and just cause 2 was because it's easy to understand and in 1 out of 2 games, there really wasn't no objective. Payday 2 is very linear (also why they don't do cod zombies or whatever it is now)  Also you can't mod payday 2"
InsideGaming,2qkc6p,6tynein,7,Sun Dec 28 05:13:30 2014 UTC,"You can mod payday, just no large new meshes have been made yet. A lot of texture replacements have been made, a lot of new HUDs as well."
InsideGaming,2qkc6p,gottagofaster,3,Sun Dec 28 07:47:16 2014 UTC,"You can mod payday 2, i have about 15 different graphical mods (guns, skins, textures, etc), and can add mechanics/features/hacks into the the game with LUA scripts."
InsideGaming,2qkc6p,stryking,2,Mon Dec 29 11:42:54 2014 UTC,"It isn't that linear, it depends on the map. Stelthable are bigger and there are lots more paths than the loud ones.  The objectives are really simple too and you get reminded all the time guys the thermal drill go get it And if you want hordes of cops, you can use GoonMod. Other than texture, hud and script mods I doubt we will have new models and stuff like that since the engine isn't really modular."

InsideGaming,2qfuz7,SpoolesArmpit,0,Fri Dec 26 12:49:29 2014 UTC,Agree with you. I saw the mods just removed the link just submitted about DDoS attack.
InsideGaming,2qfuz7,Doctor_Heat,1 point,Fri Dec 26 13:31:49 2014 UTC,"No more threads are needed anyway, finest squad doxxed all of them so it's finished"
InsideGaming,2qfuz7,RekdAnalCavity,0,Fri Dec 26 17:03:45 2014 UTC,Has anyone made /r/VirginSquad yet? Someone should.
InsideGaming,2qfuz7,BionicSammich,-4,Fri Dec 26 14:20:19 2014 UTC,"ah, I thought my thread got deleted. It was a direct response to the video that Inside Gaming did where they talked about Lizard Squad and what they were going to do. So it's on topic with being about Inside Gaming since IG asked the question, not us. I guess it makes sense to want to avoid giving them attention since it what fuels the attacks, but IG started it. (I don't really care either way tbh)"
