Just make sure they sit for awhile to completely thaw.   I've used a few designs of hydration chambers, but the one that has worked best for me is a layer of wet (not soaking, but not wrung out) paper towels, with a cap of Listerine. Place a small piece of cardboard on the paper towels, and pin your specimen to that. If you place the specimen directly on the towel, they will pick up the odor of the Listerine.  Rehydration takes about 24-36 hours (around 12 is probably enough, but I do more to be safe) in a small 8 oz. Mason jar, that's for a medium-large sized beetle. I've also used this to hydrate insects that I know to have been dead for over a year.   If you use PM-ME-YOUR-SOURCE's design, make sure to sprinkle some moth crystals into the container.

A zoologist with a job."" more times than I can remember.  Depending on what part of the field you want to be in there are tons of jobs available at any given time. In the private sector any business that has to deal with insects hires entomologists: agriculture, public health (think mosquitoes and bed bugs), pest control, food processing and storage, etc. Not to mention government positions such as military entomologists, USDA, and NIH researchers. Of course most of the work is in controlling pest species, so if that is not your interest it may be a bit harder to find work.     I can't speak for forensic entomology specifically, though I know the field is popular and may be crowded.  Could anyone else weigh in?  Most land-grant universities have an entomology department of some sort, so check out your state's institution to get an idea (assuming you are in the USA).  The University of Tennessee has a body farm and an entomology program, so that may be worth looking into (http://fac.utk.edu/faculty.html) if you want to do both."

Entomology,3d7gq1,Joseph_P_Brenner,5,Tue Jul 14 02:52:12 2015 UTC,"The goal of insect taxonomy is certainly to reconstruct the nested series of monophyletic clades that reflect their true history.  Quite a bit of effort has been devoted to determining this and complex techniques involving scored physical traits, molecular sequence data, or both have been used to clarify insect relationships.  Unfortunately, many insect groups have undergone explosive radiation events at various points in their history which left little evidence of what traits may have been unique to their short-lived ancestors.  This means there are quite areas where the true phylogeny is difficult to infer.  Furthermore, the insects are such a tremendously speciose group that not every species can be studied to include in phylogenies.  Thus, some of the finer grained taxonomic levels such as the genus or family levels may not be well resolved for all groups.  As far as your example of the tarantula hawks goes, you are making the assumption that preying on tarantulas is a shared derived trait.  I am not an expert on wasps, but that may not be true.  Just because the common name for any wasp that preys on tarantulas is ""tarantula hawk"" does not mean that this classification has any meaning.  For example, ""crustacean"" is a commonly used term but it is not a monophyletic group (hexapods are nested within the group).  Or pepsis and hemipepsis may share a common ancestor that parasitized tarantulas, but that ancestor occurred below the family level.  The levels of taxonomy are very arbitrary and the true phylogeny is far more complex, so the two genera of tarantula hawk may be sister genera that share a derived trait not shared with the rest of their ""family""."

You're right; thanks for identifying my error.  In the context of cladistics, is there a term for groups like tarantula hawks?  Such grouping is phenetic, so is diametric to cladism, but is practical in some ways.  But it also has the unfortunate consequence of misleading many into thinking that tarantula hawks, for example, is a taxon (because to think of groups consisting of some, but not all, phylogenetically/phenetically derived taxa is unusual)."
Entomology,3d7gq1,darjeelingexpress,5,Tue Jul 14 04:20:48 2015 UTC,"What I've seen with the bees is that while molecular work is in progress and involves everything from re-naming to re-lumping and re-splitting at resolutions from family all the way down to tribes, there's a fair amount ambiguity and paraphyletic groups. The cladograms are a mess for some whole orders right now, and the discussions about which derived character came first coud end up flipping whole hierarchies or their axes. The mess (with bees only, which is what I'm most familiar with) appears to be uncomfortably tolerated at the moment - no one likes it, but it's preferable to incorrect taxonomy and I've had the impression many believe it will be resolved ""shortly"" as more sequences clarify relationships. It's supposed to be cladistic. We aspire to clades, I think."

And the partiality is due to the immense number of species (and that's more of an understatement than to say that paleontologists live in exciting times).  Dinosaurs, on the other hand, have relatively little known species, so the effort to make their taxonomic entirely cladistic is a relatively low-effort task."

Entomology,3d37ab,Owl_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:44:33 2015 UTC,"Grapevine beetle:       The grapevine beetle, Pelidnota punctata, also known as the spotted June beetle or the spotted pelidnota, is a species of beetle, a member of the subfamily Rutelinae of the Scarab beetle family. Grapevine beetles are common in the north and central United States and Eastern Canada, but do relatively little damage to their host plants. The beetles fly at a fast speed, usually in a curving flight.  The adult beetle is approximately 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) long, but can reach 3 cm (1.2 in) occasionally. Its pattern is off-yellow or auburn red, with three black spots running down each side. Fine black lines divide the edges of its elytra. At other times, the beetle may have been known as Pelidnota lutea. There are two different variations of Pelidnota punctata, the southern variation lacks the darker legs, while the northern variation has darker legs. As Philip Harpootlian points out, the grapevine beetle is a variable species — so much so that T.L. Casey named ten species and subspecies in 1915, names that were later merged back into Pelidnota punctata.   Its color, shape, spots, and behavior sometimes lead it to be misidentified as a giant ladybug. While both are beetles, they are from different families.

Entomology,3cwc0g,apollyon2012,4,Sat Jul 11 09:15:53 2015 UTC,Few questions:  Do you own any pets? Do you have a crawl space? Do you live by a wooded area?  You are doing the right thing by getting tested for Lyme disease as a precaution. But you may have a larger issue. I had a case like this once happen and we found the cause to be a severe rodent infestation. The rats were traveling into the house from a crawl space under the house and through the attic. The colony had grown to a large enough size that they would often enter the living quarters of the home. Once in the living area the ticks would release them selves and fall on the floors. In our case our client had wood floors and they would travel between the void. Eventually they found the home owners and began to bite/latch to them. This just one case and it may or may not help in your situation.

Main reason I'm leaning towards rodents with the information provided is rats would account for most of the other bites, with the fleas and mites they carry.   I'm having a really hard time believing nymphal ticks are responsible for all of the bites, as they feed on their host for 3-8 days.

The more attention paid to native pollinators the better. What's especially surprising to me is how the observations are consistent across species and across the northern hemisphere.  My only complaint is that Kerr (my former Ecology prof!) doesn't say anything about where the data came from. Records are drawn from thousands of specimens, carefully collected, identified, and maintained in numerous natural history collections. These collections offer long-term datasets that are vital to this kind of research, far beyond just bumblebees. Sheila Colla (one of the co-authors) and Laurence Packer (another co-author, and Colla's former supervisor)  both played major roles in gathering that data, and both offer more comment here.   Natural history collections are increasingly poorly funded, especially here in Canada, and that's something worth emphasizing alongside these results. We simply wouldn't know these things without properly maintained collection."

I'm leaning toward a combined and complicated answer involving multiple variables ie: Synthetic insecticides, farm equipment emissions, agriculture use of bees, human zoning and landscaping...   I personally feel ( I am aware that is not allowed in science) that everyone is jumping on global warming to obtain funding and media support, while trying to motivate millions of people to try and change their lives for the better. But we are humans and the only way to motivate us is by the scaring us."
Entomology,3csqik,apollyon2012,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:18:55 2015 UTC,"Well, like I just explained, the data were drawn from individual records of individual bumblebees collected over the past 110 years or so. I don't think there can be any doubt that this is a large and exhaustive dataset.  As for suggesting that it's likely a complicated interaction of variables: you're absolutely right - on a local scale. What they found was that the single best predictor of continental-scale range shift was change in average temperature. If you read the article, you'd know they even attempt to control for both land use and pesticide use, neither of which have any significant impact on change in species range. Local populations are absolutely impacted by pesticide use and habitat destruction, both of which are contributors to the decline of species like the rusty-patched bumblebee. But we're not talking about local populations here, we're talking about range on a geographic scale, and those factors simply don't scale up to a continental impact. Species may be locally abundant or locally rare, or may have a narrow range or a broad one, or any combination of the above. The point is that one does not imply the other. A species may be locally rare (e.g. as a result of impacts of pesticides or habitat destruction) but still have a broad range. What this research shows, however, is that the genus-wide trend is that bumblebee species' ranges are shrinking, regardless of impacts on local population. That's something worth looking into.  In any case, it's not just a grab for funding, or an attempt to scare people into action. It's a scientifically sound piece of research providing good evidence that climate change is affecting bumblebee range.

Bumble bees are not the only pollinator out there, where are the evidence to suggest that climate change negatively affects all pollinators?   “Bumblebees pollinate many plants that provide food for humans and wildlife. If we don’t stop the decline in the abundance of bumblebees, we may well face higher food prices, diminished varieties, and other troubles,” added team member Dr Leif Richardson from the University of Vermont.   Nice slippery slope fallacy.  Aside from the annoying propaganda, i wonder what is the reason for their lagging range expansion towards the poles."

Entomology,3cpttl,imfm,3,Thu Jul 9 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"Damn. I was all excited about talking to bugs, which I do anyway; I just thought maybe I wasn't the only one.  I don't think I can pick a favourite type of insect. Obviously, I love butterflies, bees, hoverflies, and the rest of the pollen and nectar-loving critters for whom I bust my butt, working in the garden. Then again, mantids are pretty awesome...and so are assassin bugs...and robber flies...and dragonflies...and damselflies. Stink bugs, shield bugs and plant bugs are often quite attractive, and their nymphs are just adorable. I'm not a huge fan of beetles, but stag beetles and ground beetles are really cool, and I absolutely love Six-spotted tiger beetles with their magnificent mandibles and gorgeous metallic green colours. Even the humble wood roach has its place and its job to do. Nope. I don't have a favourite insect.  Your friend is quite wrong; a snail is absolutely, positively not a bug. Not in the truest sense of the word (Heteropterans being the true bugs), or even in the looser sense of insects, or in the very loose definition of ""an arthropod"". A snail is a gastropod; crabs are more closely related to bugs than are snails."

Pointy legs in front are true legs that will eventually become the legs of the adult insect. Stumpy ones at the back are called prolegs, or false legs; those will disappear during metamorphosis. If it's got more than five pairs of prolegs, it's not a caterpillar, it's a sawfly larva. Caterpillar prolegs also have little ""velcro-y"" pads called crochets on them; sawflies do not. (Find a Hickory Horned Devil and you'll easily see the crochets without magnification.)"

Entomology,3cihfo,woodlandbugs,2,Wed Jul 8 22:55:35 2015 UTC,No group in particular although I am fond of hymenopterans and buprestids. I know Lindgren funnels can be effective with the right lure but are also usually pretty pricey. Woodborers as a whole are a group that I haven't had much experience with and would like to get to know them better.
Entomology,3cihfo,woodlandbugs,2,Thu Jul 9 03:17:26 2015 UTC,"If you want buprestids, you might try to hunt down some crabronidae nests in your area. They prey on buprestids and stockpile them in their nests. Google ""buprestidae crabronidae"" and you'll find several papers about this.  Here's a poster I found by looking up ""cerambicidae trapping"" : http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsbdev2_040931.pdf  It gives a list of different attractants that were good for catching longhorned beetles. Maybe if the price is prohibitive you could try to  make one?  I know for some woodboring hymenopterans, you might throw a bunch of pine cuttings on the ground and come back periodically to check it. The pine can attract siricids.  Sorry to not be of much help. There is a ton of research going into ways to trap specific groups, but I don't think any of the methods are particularly easy, aside from like the expensive Lindgren funnels you mention. You probably also don't want to be trying to rear random borers out of wood. I guess I'd just be trying to be out in the woods on sunny days, with a net, as much as possible. Or bite the bullet and get a funnel or malaise trap.  Good luck!"

In which case you may have a nest in the walls. Carpenter ants are often totally nocturnal and secretive and will go unnoticed for a long time until the reproductives start to emerge.      That's assuming it was actually an ant. Reproductive termites will often resemble ants closely enough to fool people.      So that'a kind of the other likely option. Take everything I said above and substitute in termite for carpenter ant.        A third alternative is that it's one of those things that came in from outside and was looking to establish a new nest.       The last alternative is that it's none of the above and could be a solitary wasp, or any number of other things.       Can you maybe get a pic?"

Entomology,3c6kxv,FormatOnceAYear,6,Sun Jul 5 09:08:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not aware of any such trap used for collecting flower visitors, I'm a pollinator ecologist and generally speaking there are two methods: pan traps or hand netting. Pan traps are a very widely used method of surveying pollinators, but you don't get the flower interaction data. If this is really important then the most reliable method is simply to catch stuff as it visits your target flowers. The other possibility is to catch loads of pollinators whether they're visiting your flowers or not and then look at the pollen on them to see what plants they've been visiting, but this is very time consuming and requires either expertise in pollen identification or in DNA barcoding.  I suspect there is a similar dilemma with regards to seed eating insects, one of my colleagues surveys for aphids on wheat and she does it by sampling every area every week, by hand. It's the same for me, I sample all of my plots every week, catching any insects that visit the flowers within. If you come up with a standardised sampling method then you can do lots of sites, you just need to try to get as many sampling rounds in as you can.  Have a look at what similar research has done and what methods they have used.  Sorry for the ramble!"

The flies were everywhere except in the years when there were high numbers of yellow jackets (Vespula species) and bald-faced hornets (Dolichovespula  species).  We needed to spend a lot of time educating some of the volunteers about the role of insectivorous insects in the ecosystem.  Fun stuff.

Entomology,3boqoc,oneultralamewhiteboy,2,Wed Jul 1 00:50:09 2015 UTC,"I have spent countless hours and thousands of dollars turning a bare yard into a bug and bird bistro. I have as many native plants as possible, and usually have to order them because Lowe's doesn't carry plants like wild phlox, Virginia bluebell, Virginia snakeroot or plain Echinacea purpurea. The edge of my property was terribly overgrown with invasive Asian bush honeysuckle and Japanese honeysuckle that had been allowed to do as it pleased for 40-plus years. I cut out as much as I could, then paid someone to take out the stuff that was too big for me to cut. In its place, I planted American elderberry, common serviceberry, American mountain-ash, spicebush, Carolina allspice, and native dogwood. No flower, shrub, or plant gets garden space here unless it's a nectar plant for bees/butterflies/hover flies (etc.), a butterfly host plant, a nectar plant for hummingbirds, or provides seeds or berries for birds and other native creatures. My yard is my ""peaceful place""; my last Pipevine Swallowtail just eclosed last week, and I have a bunch of hatchling Silvery Checkerspot caterpillars on the coneflowers, and when I get home from work, I walk around the garden to see what's blooming, what's growing, and who's come to visit, or left me presents that will turn into babies. Japanese beetles favour roses, mallows, hibiscus, and zinnia, but ultimately, will eat anything. When they feed, they release pheromones that attract more of them. They don't nibble plants; they devour them. In one week, they skeletonized every single leaf on a 20' tree. It didn't kill the tree, but certainly stressed it. They can do enough damage to smaller plants to kill them. Japanese beetles reproduce like crazy, destroy turf in the process (grubs eat roots), stress or even kill all kinds of different plants, and since they are introduced, have no natural predators. Even Chinese mantises don't eat them. The only predatory insect I've seen eating them is the wheel bug (Arilus cristatus), but there aren't enough wheel bugs to keep up with the beetles. In North America, Japanese beetles are good for nothing, wreak havoc upon gardens and native vegetation, and just need to DIE. I will put a wandering wood roach back outside, and would never kill a spider, but I drown Japanese beetles by the hundreds every year, and if I find their grubs while I'm planting in spring, I squash them. They have zero redeeming qualities."

Several hundred dollars later it's finally starting to clear up but for the first couple months it was a mess.   At this point the best thing you can do is keep the tank in ideal conditions, make sure water is always available and feed on the normal schedule. I know it sounds bad but that's really the best thing you can do - Just let him rest and recover. Hopefully it's just superficial and it'll clear up on the next molt like /u/Mrs_Brisby said. Almost every creature that molts is vulnerable shortly after a molt and they're not likely to move much. Hopefully that's explains his unusual behavior.  Keep us updated!"

Gonna head to the store and get some grapes and cherries and see if he'll go for either of those. :/  On the advice of a vet friend of mine, I put a little bit of silver sulfadiazine cream on the worst parts and gave him a droplet of liquid ibuprofen.

After a bit it began to spread and eventually became noticeable enough to concern me. I asked around on /r/reptiles and somebody was kind enough to let me know what it was and advised me to get him to the vet. It's been a long battle with a LOT of pissed off skink scratches on my arms from administering medication but luckily his mouth is clearing up and the scarring seems minimal.

Entomology,3b9od0,Joseph_P_Brenner,2,Sat Jun 27 07:15:05 2015 UTC,"Nabidae:       The insect family Nabidae contains the damsel bugs. The term damsel bug is the common name used for the Nabids. There are over 500 species in 20 genera.  They are soft-bodied, elongate, winged terrestrial predators. Many damsel bugs catch and hold prey with their forelegs, similar to mantids. They are considered helpful species in agriculture because of their predation on many types of crop pests.   Damsel bugs of the genus Nabis are the most common. They and other genera are most numerous in fields of legumes such as alfalfa, but they can be found in many other crops and in non-cultivated areas. They are yellow to tan in color and have large, bulbous eyes and stiltlike legs. They are generalist predators, catching almost any insect smaller than themselves, and cannibalizing each other when no other food is available. Several species have bitten humans.

Entomology,3b9od0,autowikibot,2,Sat Jun 27 05:47:10 2015 UTC,"Reduviidae:       The Reduviidae are a large cosmopolitan family of the order of ""true bugs"" or Hemiptera. They are slightly unusual among the Hemiptera because almost all are terrestrial ambush predators (most other predatory Hemiptera are aquatic). The main examples of non-predatory Reduviidae are some blood-sucking ectoparasites in the subfamily Triatominae. Though there are spectacular exceptions, most members of the family are fairly easily recognisable: they have a relatively narrow neck, sturdy build and formidable curved proboscis (sometimes called a rostrum). Large specimens should be handled with caution, if at all, because they sometimes defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis.

Entomology,3b96ls,ChloroformVictim,3,Sat Jun 27 00:14:31 2015 UTC,"It's all in the forewings. Here's an image of all three wings, with arrows to important parts: http://www.emporia.edu/dotAsset/a56ed0f1-9182-456b-a7df-1464f071ebcc.jpg It's a little tough to work from that photo, as it's small and it gives more info than needed. So, to give some info to go with the image:  First, you'll need to look at the general damselfly wing, and know how to find the nodus. It's marked on all three of the wings pictured above.  Now that you know where that is, the first question to ask is how many ""antenodal crossveins"" are there? It's easiest to separate out the family calopterygidae, because it is the group with a lot (10 or more) antenodal crossveins. The other families you mentioned only have 2.  So you can easily determine whether you have a calopterygid by looking at those crossveins. If you only have 2 crossveins, you have to determine whether it's lestidae or coenagrionidae by looking at a different vein, the m3. This is a curved vein that can either start anterior to the nodus (Lestidae), just below it, or posterior to the nodus (Coenagrionidae).  The m3 can be tricky to locate if you're not so familiar with damselfly wing venetion. I highly recommend you be able to identify, the costal, subcostal, and radial/medial veins, so you have an idea of what you're looking for.  Here is a labelled picture of the m3 of a coenagrionid - it's the top wing you're looking for, and you can see that the m3 is right below the nodus: http://www.thefossilforum.com/uploads/monthly_12_2012/post-7497-0-77561200-1356196310.jpg  Lestidae: In this group, the m3 originates anterior to the nodus. Here is a picture of a lestid wing, which is probably confusing because it's not a picture of the whole wing, but at least things are labelled: https://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/557/flashcards/160557/png/lestes_rectangularis_plate6_2-14432578C8D5853624D.png  And here is another example of a lestid wing; although it's not labelled in a helpful way, it does at least have the m3 originating anterior to the nodus: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Damselfly_wing_structure.png  So that's it. If you're just trying to separate insects that you know are in one of these three families:   Are there 10+ antenodal crossveins? If yes, then Calopterygidae. If not, Does the m3 start anterior to the nodus (Lestidae) or below/posterior to the nodus (Coenagrionidae)?   Hope this helps."

If you can find a university that offers a program that fits your interests and goals, send emails to the faculty there to see if you would be a good fit. If you can get someone to agree to let you work in their lab, that's even better. You don't need to already have completed entomology coursework before applying, but this will very likely become a requirement in your first year (at least a general entomology course before doing any forensic courses).   If you want a place to start, try checking out the University of California, Riverside. The entomology department there is very large and growing (we just reached ~50 grad students in the past year). There is only one forensic entomology class but the med/vet section of the department is pretty big, and you may be able to do research focusing on forensics (talk to Dr. Alec Gerry, he's the instructor for forensic entomology). If nothing else, the people there may be able to point you towards other schools."

You would probably be required to take several introductory entomology classes to make sure you're up to speed. In our program, for instance, new students are required to have at least insect taxonomy and insect physiology. So in that regard, you'd be fine or at least not disadvantaged."
Entomology,3b4wp6,love_bugs,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:33:44 2015 UTC,"Here are some forensic entomology programs: http://www.forensicscolleges.com/blog/resources/college-forensic-entomology-programs  You should read up on them, visit the websites and look at the specific work being done by groups/professors at the various schools. Then, you can have an idea of which professors you'd like to contact to ask about applying to graduate school.  I do know of people that come into graduate entomology study without a formal background--they just have to take catch-up courses. It will depend on the program. Some departments have extensive course requirements, and some departments have no formal course requirements, leaving it up to the student's committee to decide which courses are necessary.  Write to several professors, mention your interest and past experience, and say you'd like to pursue entomology and are interested in the work being done in (X) lab. Attach your CV, which should emphasize the thesis project, and invite them to ask you any questions."

Entomology,3av99n,Jafoob,2,Tue Jun 23 20:07:36 2015 UTC,Maybe we could make a decoy cicada with a tape recorder playing in a low bush. Then we wait...
Entomology,3av99n,Gneubs,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:17:29 2015 UTC,"A two-cycle engine, such as a string trimmer and especially a chainsaw, will attract them. At least one of the broods where I am (probably XXIII) is attracted."
Entomology,3av99n,cicadamania,2,Tue Jun 23 20:55:21 2015 UTC,"Depends on the species, and at what point they're in the their above the ground life cycle.   The Power Tool idea is a good idea. The periodical cicadas are attracted to all manner of vibrating machinery. Once they're high up in the trees, they're harder to catch. I use a net with a set of extender poles which you can get on Bioquip.com Some species are attracted to lights at night, so a good place to collect them is around gas stations and parking lots with lights near trees. A lot of researchers use sound files to attract them. There are plenty of sounds on on my site and others. Females are attracted to the calls mating calls. Males (depending on the species) are attracted to snap noises (like a finger snap) which mimics female wing snaps. The easiest way is to catch them at night when they have first emerged from the ground and shed their nymph skins. They're defenseless then. Of course sometimes picking dead one off the ground works as well."

Plus there's TONS of other bugs you may also like to add.  And at risk of sounding like a jerk, if they are in trees that are too tall, check shorter trees.  Newer planted trees are just as attractive perches.   I see them there a lot.  I've never had trouble catching dogday cicadas once they get going and the periodical cicadas, when they emerge, are in such density that they come to you.   Stick with it and I'm sure you'll get one in no time."

Many are curious and will fly close to you to see what's going on, the large cicada killer being a prime example in my experience, but they'll leave you alone if you do the same. Many are important pollinators, just like bees, and a great number of them are actually parasitoids for pests (and most of these wasps aren't tough-looking: they're small to microscopic and don't care about humans). Plus this one was a male, so it lacked a stinger even if it wanted to hurt me.  tl;dr: Wasps are good and I love them and so should everyone else"

Entomology,3an5nq,Flammenwerfer22,2,Sun Jun 21 23:54:05 2015 UTC,Dip it in acetone for 4-8 hours to preserve the color. If you do not it will rapidly fade after death. Do this after you place inside the envelope.  Dragonflies are never pinned. They are stored in envelopes like these. Fold the wings above the body and place the dragonfly inside. Dragonflies break ALOT. These envelopes keep all pieces associated with each other. https://www.bioquip.com/search/DispProduct.asp?pid=1130DP  Inside place an index card with locality information and determination information. http://www.pugetsound.edu/files/resources/4307_dragon%20card.jpeg  Cheers  Edit: If you want to maintain a personal collection for display pinning is fine I guess. However no museum will accept them if you ever want to donate.  Edit 2: A great link on catching and preserving dragonflies. http://dragonflywebsite.com/articles/collecting/morse2.html

Entomology,3ad4fb,wadenator,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:37:13 2015 UTC,"Either you are grossly overestimating the size of the animal, or it may have been something from the water, possibly decaying and having lost legs and claws, such as a lobster. From a few feet ahead it may have looked like something else. Large insects occuring near the water could be dobsonflies or fishflies."
Entomology,3ac2vl,StayAtHomeSci,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:58:36 2015 UTC,Saw a document about them once. Even though they have great heat resistance they can only be around ten minutes hunting outside in direct sunshine before their  body temperature reaches over 50¤C and they die. Of course this might not be case everywhere where these ants live.

Entomology,3a7ge5,Ghitit,2,Thu Jun 18 16:39:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's because the colony is too large in number for the space available.  A new queen will be born and she'll take those ants to a new spot and start a new colony. Not positive, though."
Entomology,3a7ge5,loyalone,3,Thu Jun 18 17:00:01 2015 UTC,"What they're doing (probably) is getting ready to follow a new queen - or queens - to new nesting sites. This comes on the heels of a number of winged males (alates) flying after the newly-emerged queens to mate with them, lose their wings and either die or follow to the new site. And that happens simply because the nest's population has been expanding to the point they needed more space. Just like people!   It's either that, or their nest has been disrupted and they need new digs."

Entomology,3a7ge5,suugakusha,2,Thu Jun 18 16:47:24 2015 UTC,This happens all the time in my area as well and I would like to know as well.  I was told by someone it was an ant battle but I think I also heard that ants sometimes do this to help regulated temperatures in their nest.  I dont know for sure though.  I guess another possibility is when the mating males and females come out and they swarm to protect them?  Obviously Im guessing at this point :)

Entomology,3a1lbx,covington,2,Wed Jun 17 03:05:48 2015 UTC,"The lavender flower was next to a fence post, so I loosely tied it to the post to keep the wind from moving it. Used a syringe to inject some 2:1 sugar syrup into several of the flowers (dissolve a cup of sugar into 1/2 a cup of hot water. Let it cool before you use it). I then took a few test shots with the flash turned off to make sure I could expose the background but keep the foreground a siloet. I was dangerously close to the natural light exposure for the flower, so I set the flash to second curtain sync and tried to shadow the subject with the diffusers. With the flash firing at the very end of the exposure it's easier to get good detail even if the natural light records movement. I have a frame in this series where there is a ""shadow"" under the antenna caused by the critter moving them and there being enough natural light to show it, but because the flash fired right before the shutter closed the antenna is still sharp. Also I rested the camera on another fence post close to the flower to help keep it steady. Took about 30 frames and I'll end up posting 3 of them. This type of shooting is similar to taking landscape photos in that it helps to plan out what you're going to do before the scene presents itself."
Entomology,39zl73,alecksdee,7,Tue Jun 16 01:50:54 2015 UTC,To offer some tips on pinning. That pin is way too big for the specimen and when spreading wings the goal is to have the back of the front wing and front of the back wing perpendicular to the body. This is to do with keeping the integrity of the body over time and the wings in a natural position where the whole posterior wing is clearly visible.
Entomology,39zl73,RobertMacArthur_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:43:26 2015 UTC,The angle of the picture and the wing coloration makes it look like i pinned it incorrectly.  I do need to get smaller pins for the tiny insects I'm finding though

Entomology,39shb5,Dog_Bugger,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:48:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry about the video quality, but I've seen them up close and they're definately ants. their body is in three big parts (a head, a body, and that other thing behind the body), which doesn't match a termite, which should have a body that's all one part."
Entomology,39shb5,Dog_Bugger,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:11:17 2015 UTC,"I think what you mean is the head, the thorax, and the gaster or abdomen.  Those are the three major body parts of the ant.  The termite has a softer body than the ant, and the ant has a thinner body than the termite.  Once thing that caught my attention of the insects in your video is it looks like the have extremely long wings relative to the size of their bodies, which is characteristic of termites, not ants."

Entomology,39pet4,alecksdee,5,Sat Jun 13 13:39:24 2015 UTC,"In this case, where the first thoracic segment extends back and covers the second, you should pin straight down through the second thoracic segment, even though it will also go through that extension of the pronotum.  I don't want to pick on you or anything, it appears you are trying your best to do the perfect pin job, so I assume you appreciate help getting it right.  Always pin perpendicular to the insect, and always through the right side of the second thoracic segment, the one where the right forewing arises."
Entomology,39pet4,parapants,2,Sat Jun 13 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input,  I'm really new to this.  Some one told me to pin through the second thoracic segment. So you're saying that going through the extension should be a better more correct pinning? Also, what's the reasoning for going through the right side? The asymmetry would be weird to me."
Entomology,39pet4,parapants,3,Sat Jun 13 20:19:26 2015 UTC,"Right on, it looks like you're on the right track.  Pinning off slightly to the right of center is just a convention that always leaves one side of the insect undamaged, which may be important when trying to work it through a dichotomous key.  This is an example of where it should go on a grasshopper."

Then go out and collect some cool bugs with him!  Or, if he doesn't want to kill them, just take some cool pictures and make a virtual collection.  Another fun idea:  contact a local university (extension offices are usually good for this) with an entomology department in your area and see if they have an insect zoo or have some grad students or professors that would be willing to give him a tour of some insect labs.  I bet he'd love that.  If you're near Purdue or Florida or Georgia, they have great outreach initiatives and would probably be more than willing to set up a visit.

Entomology,397tfs,Devidose,5,Tue Jun 9 21:46:21 2015 UTC,"Can't help you with local insects as I'm based in the UK but in regards to this:   You know, pinning, collecting, observing, etc. But I really don't know where to start.   One thing to take note of it when capturing specimens to not go overboard and capture everything you see. Sure there will be many insects to find, but if you are going to pin them to display you obviously don't need every single thing you find. This is bad for the environment and local species populations for one thing, and can result in your collection being bloated with single species, which may have the quantitative aspect to it, but the qualitative will be low as everything is the same.  So to help with this examine what you catch before you decide to kill them for pinning and such.  Depending what you want to catch will affect your capture method.  Moths are commonly attracted to light sources to night light traps are very good for those and can be set up to collect over night with anything still there [and alive] to be examined the next day. Light traps can be very easy to set up using a large white sheet held up by two ends to create a hanging square with a torch shining on the middle of the sheet, or creating a boxed off trap with a torch inside to attract moths and other insects. Beetles and some other insects are better found if you create traps that are built out of pieces of wood. Darker and more human conditions are more appealing, however you may inadvertently attract predators so be prepared for finding dead or damaged specimen from traps.  For insects one of the easiest ways to kill them it to put them in a sealed box and put them in a freezer as they eventually go to sleep and then die so you're not killing them through anything particularly cruel.  Note this doesn't work for all arthropods, so things like spiders need to be drowned in an alcohol solution as if you freeze a spider the body at the back tends to liquefy when you defrost them which makes pinning next to impossible.  It should be easy enough to work out if you have something new or if you've caught it before from past experiences so you will know whether you will need to kill and pin anything you catch.  Edit: Also, ask questions. If you are unsure about something about a trap, ask, someone will be able to help here. If you are after certain insects, ask and again someone will know how to best trap those. Ask questions!"

Entomology,397tfs,Devidose,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:11:57 2015 UTC,"It's tricky sometimes as some insects are harder to pin than others, [looking at you craneflies]. They are often extremely fragile and can fall apart very easily, so if you capture 8, freeze 1 to pin, then it falls to pieces, you have to then wait again for another to freeze. Some insects are abundant enough that you can probably try with 1-3, but try to keep it relatively conservative in how many you do freeze/kill.  As for pinning it depends on what you want to pin. With ants sometimes you may be trying to pin all the different types of ant in a nest [queens aside as that can kill the nest], so you'd need to catch a worker, a warrior, etc, to get them all.  As for pill bugs, if they are what I think you mean those are not insects, and are more closely related to crabs, lobsters, and shrimp than insects as they are crustaceans. They're very easy to find as they live in dark and damp conditions and feed on rotting vegetation like dead wood, but I'm not too familiar with how best to kill and pin them as I've only ever done behavioural studies on them over 10 years ago.  If you're trying to stick with insects, skip the pill bugs."

Entomology,397tfs,WesternHemlock,2,Tue Jun 9 22:26:25 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's common for a lot of things to get thrown together with insects when they aren't. Shrimps are sometimes called ""the insects of the sea"", and there are various similarities, so it's understandable, but it can get on some entomologists nerves when things that aren't even in the insect Order are called such, like arachnids, or non true bugs are called such. Just part of how things are viewed at times."
Entomology,397tfs,Devidose,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:29:21 2015 UTC,"From talking with the BIO's (Biodiversity Institute of Ontario) admin about their insect collection, they generally stored myriapods in fluid solutions of alcohol (or other preservatives chemicals). This is due to myriapods suffering severely from desiccation. That is why centipedes,millipedes, pill bugs etc love moist areas and is also why you never see them roaming around during the day.   Here and there, you need to use glue in order to fix down those fragile species. However not even glue always works xD!"
Entomology,397tfs,ObsBlk,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:46:55 2015 UTC,I feel your pain. Only about 1/3 of my crane flies have all 6 legs.
Entomology,397tfs,ObsBlk,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:30:49 2015 UTC,"That's still very impressive given how easily they fall off :P  Once tried pinning 3 of them, legs went flying every attempt. Gave up."

A Field Guide to Insects: America North of Mexico  http://www.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Insects-America-Mexico/dp/0395911702  If you're feeling real keen, get an intro textbook.  This was my first and I love it (http://www.amazon.com/The-Insects-An-Outline-Entomology/dp/1405111135/ref=pd_sim_14_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=11D56BA2A5CKRQPFMXZ2, though it seems there up to a 5th edition now), however this one is also a classic intro textbook (http://www.amazon.com/Borror-DeLongs-Introduction-Study-Insects/dp/0030968356/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433894573&sr=1-1&refinements=p_27%3ACharles+A.+Triplehorn+Norman+F.+Johnson&pebp=1433894647881&perid=15Q15FXB5XRMJ3H9M5HF)"
Entomology,396ppk,metacollin,3,Tue Jun 9 17:28:08 2015 UTC,"Polyphemus moth. Pretty variable species so I wasn't sure. I'm also not familiar with western species, though this is a cosmopolitan one. If anyone knows NM species better, listen to them."
Entomology,396ppk,prof_mcquack,2,Tue Jun 9 18:19:07 2015 UTC,"Agree it is likely to be an Oculea, the Western Polyphemus Moth.. The coloration is slightly different, and they have bigger/darker eyespots, and are only found in New Mexico/Arizona."
