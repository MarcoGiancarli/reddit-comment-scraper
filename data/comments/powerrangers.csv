powerrangers,3e4szz,DashingQuill23,2,Wed Jul 22 02:39:44 2015 UTC,I wanted carter to be my older brother as a child haha.
powerrangers,3e4szz,Nasjere,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:02:09 2015 UTC,"As a guy named Carter, you're reply freaked me out for a second."
powerrangers,3e4szz,DashingQuill23,2,Wed Jul 22 03:05:30 2015 UTC,So will you be my older brother?
powerrangers,3e38zz,AJC19706,5,Tue Jul 21 16:53:18 2015 UTC,"In Dekaranger, they explain what their uniforms are made of, and how it gets transferred to them when requested.  Also, I believe in Shinkenger, their forms are pure mojikara that resemble outfits. They act like armor.  Magiranger, seems it's similar to Shinken.  Also in 199 super hero battle, Chiaki says they cannot fight in ""those forms again"", which lends more evidence to the outfits are a form they are transforming into.  Hope that helps!"
powerrangers,3e38zz,PrinceAuryn,4,Tue Jul 21 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"The fact that the rangers have taken their helmets off suggests that they are in fact worn. Also, there was an episode of In Space where Ashley pulls a locket out from between her base layer and her suit. However, because no one has ever removed more than a helmet, I'm inclined to believe as others have suggested that the suit is a form they become to fight. Although RPM made it explicitly clear that the suits are in facts suits and most definitely not made of spandex, so.... it's still inconclusive?"
powerrangers,3e38zz,MZago1,3,Tue Jul 21 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"The suits are all physical. In Zeo, the original uniforms can be seen numerous times on display in the Command Center, much like how Batman displays his and his allies' costumes."
powerrangers,3e38zz,UsagiTaicho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:39 2015 UTC,Though that's a special case. Those aren't their actual suits are they? They were destroyed by Rita and Zedd. I assumed that those suits were display only and not their actual uniforms. Maybe even just holograms(that Zordon stopped displaying when they went Turbo).
powerrangers,3e38zz,neoblackdragon,2,Wed Jul 22 03:40:39 2015 UTC,"There's never been an in-depth explanation on how the suits work outside of little blurbs from Doctor K in RPM when she argues that they aren't spandex. Her exact quote is: ""The material is a self-assembling nano-fiber formed with an inter-cellular shape memory alloy"". This implies it is a physical, spandex-like material, with similar properties to metal. I think this holds up with other seasons such as in Lightspeed where the rangers were often seen with ""holes"" in their suits when they took heavy damage, exposing the metallic material underneath (see ""Curse of the Cobra"" after Carter kills Demonite at point-blank range and survives)."
powerrangers,3e38zz,mudkip25,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:27:57 2015 UTC,Of course that may not be the case for say Mystic Force or Wild Force where the suits stem from pure magic.
powerrangers,3e38zz,neoblackdragon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:38:53 2015 UTC,"Forgot about those. I guess it could still apply if you think of their powers conjuring up a similar material. I kinda wish Power Rangers would explain itself more. Much like how Captain America's shield is made of vibranium (or whatever), it would be cool to know if there's some super material that's neither natural or synthetic. A lot of people tend to believe that the suits are somehow connected to the morphin grid itself so it would make sense if it's some sort of shared property."
powerrangers,3e38zz,mudkip25,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:24:36 2015 UTC,"Well it really depends on the season.  Some of the rangers are totally technology based. Their suits physically exist somewhere or are made ""digital"". SPD and Lightspeed come to mind.  Some are magic based but are maintained through technology like Mighty Morphin.   Others are pure magic like Mystic force. In this case it's literally magic.   In some situations the suits I think take the place of their clothes. In others I think they magically alter the clothes. Sometimes the suits get damaged and their clothes are also damaged.   Now I assume by physical  you mean there exists in some location the action suits and they teleport to the rangers, In some cases yes, because they can be worked on. In other cases they exist soley in the morpher via magic or some tech.  MMPR - MAG+tech  ZEO - SCI  TURBO - SCI  IN SPACE - SCI  LOST GALAXY - MAG though Manga Defender seemed to be SCI(minus the whole ghost thing)  LIGHTSPEED - SCI  TIMEFORCE - SCI  WILDFORCE - MAG  NINJA STORM - MAG + Tech  DINOTHUNDER - MAG + SCI + TECH  SPD: SCI  OPERATION OVERDRIVE- SCI with some MAG aids  MYSTIC FORCE - Courage  JUNGLE FURY- MAG + TECH(RJ has to be some god damn genius rivaling Billy)  RPM- SCI  SAMURAI - MAG  MEGAFORCE - ..........Im not too sure on this one  DINO CHARGE - ......MAG + TECH? It get's iffy when they pull a lost Galaxy."

Does this charger show up differently if you scan it on the Dino Charge app?  I currently have it hidden amongst his other non-ranger dinosaur toys. So that way he can find the charger like the Rangers do in the show. At least that is my understanding, but I am sure that my 3 year-old will correct me when he finds it."

powerrangers,3djjnl,Stuartdjspence,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:19:09 2015 UTC,I waited for the original legacy megazord to come to my local store and it never did. That's why I ordered this one. I was worried it would be the same deal.
powerrangers,3djjnl,HNCelica,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:51:16 2015 UTC,Just got mine yesterday at Toys R Us. I was so surprised it arrived in canada so soon.

powerrangers,3ddekm,BIueRanger,5,Wed Jul 15 22:38:50 2015 UTC,It's coming up with the Dragonzord. Because it gets summoned from the Ocean. Duh
powerrangers,3ddekm,BIueRanger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:40:09 2015 UTC,I'm such a scrub. The direction the water was flowing just made it seem like it was coming from the team not the zord.

powerrangers,3de073,FusedRage,7,Wed Jul 15 18:45:44 2015 UTC,I disagree I always loved his costume. MMPR black ranger was my favourite Ranger in MMPR and I was kind of disappointed when there was no Black ranger on the ZEO team. I was so happy when I saw the gold ranger because he's essentially a super-charged black ranger.
powerrangers,3de073,Stuartdjspence,9,Wed Jul 15 16:52:24 2015 UTC,"In Sentai, he actually is considered a black ranger!"

A bunch of them are in categories just because there's not really anywhere else for them to go.  They did the same thing when it came to the Precure anniversary season and had to put the two Green suited characters somewhere."
powerrangers,3de073,Highwinter,10,Thu Jul 16 09:58:08 2015 UTC,YES. Agreed! We should get an S.H. Figuarts version of this guy. I would buy it in a heartbeat!

powerrangers,3dgfsr,Kryptome,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:27:06 2015 UTC,"You'll find a lot of discussion around here if you search for Power/Rangers. Long story short: it's a fan film, albeit one with a high budget and a couple of actually famous actors.  The 2017 film hasn't been cast yet, let alone started filming or editing. I'd say it'll be at least a year before we see any actual footage."

powerrangers,3d7ioy,m_busuttil,3,Tue Jul 14 07:33:24 2015 UTC,"Me too. When I see these type of discussions on other PR message boards, some forget that Saban Brands is a corporation that cares only about making money and that PR is just one of its properties.  From a business standpoint ninjas would be more appealing than trains and more marketable especially with the upcoming TMNT film in 2016 and if the 1Q toy sales for Ninninger is strong than it may be the thing that will sway Saban into adapting it next. Go-Busters was a failure and Bandai, Saban, and probably Toei didn't want to make the same mistake twice oversees."

You'd be surprised how something could fail in one region, and then be popular elsewhere. If memory serves, Ohranger wasn't popular in Japan but Zeo was wildly popular in America... While Carranger was popular in Japan, while Turbo was seen as a failure.  Also people need to stop leaning on ""This is a corporation that only wants money!"" as if that's  a bad thing... Should they make these shows at a loss, and go out of business? If they only cared just for money, then we wouldn't have gotten Chroma Squad as they could have use sent a straight up Cease and Desist, instead of working with them, and then actually promoting it."
powerrangers,3d7ioy,Psidebby,2,Tue Jul 14 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"The thing with Ohranger was that it fell victim to the sarin gas attacks that made the producers shift it's intended focus from serious to sort of comedic just like the Tsunami and Earthquake in 2011 that shifted Gokaiger story. Although the ratings was down in Ohranger, it's toy sales was the highest for that decade and still reigns as the highest selling sentai today."

Now look at these (sorry about the Tagalog dub, it's what I could find):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w_1lRAqeEk  The VR Troopers replicas look like papermache and Party City compared to the originals. Now, Saban wasn't awash in cash then, you might say. And I would answer that the show has never had a tremendous budget. I would also point you to Sledge and Keeper. That's the standard of original creature builds we have to work with now that Greg and everybody who learned from him is long gone."

powerrangers,3d7ioy,redemptionquest,0,Tue Jul 14 19:29:25 2015 UTC,Go busters is before Dino charge according to Sentai continuity. I think Saban skipped go busters cause of the similarities and homages to mighty morphin but then again go busters would probably the most easy to adapt cause of the similarities and homages. He's gonna split Dino charge in 2 seasons so my guess is he's move to ninninger after its done airing so he has time to adapt it.   Edit: now that I think about it toQger wouldn't  fly with a lot kids cause cause it's about trains. I mean How many kids in this day and age like trains?

powerrangers,3d7ioy,GrandSavage,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:29:51 2015 UTC,"I'm with you man, but there a  lot of reasons it has that reputation. people following hype or judging a series by the initial episodes (Go-Busters admittedly takes a while to find its groove). So most People who think it was bad didn't get to  see the awesomeness of Beat J stag.  Also, the series has a severe shift in tone due to the change in crew after it became the worst viewed sentai in recent memory. That's a huge hurdle that few shows weather well (Go to r/ gundam and ask people about the end of of Stardust Memory and they'll have much the same reaction.  And finally and probably most importantly, it wasn't Gokaiger. Gokaiger was a huge jumping on point for a lot of Sentai fans, was a fun series and had a lot to offer western audiences (pirates, mmpr costumes). Gobusters was odd (chicken as a weakness) and kind of rediculous. Also, Kyoruger was fantastic, so Gobusters just becomes the unloved middle child."
powerrangers,3d7ioy,darthboolean,-2,Tue Jul 14 14:54:16 2015 UTC,"Gokaiger and Kyoryuger had nothing to do with gobusters lack of success, the show itself was shit. I don't know the exact numbers but kyoryugers had rating almost as low as gobusters in japan."
powerrangers,3d7ioy,2-EZ-4-ME,3,Tue Jul 14 14:59:53 2015 UTC,Kyoryuger overall ratings was 3.9% which was .02% down from Go-Busters 4.1% but Kyoryuger toy sales exceeded Bandai expectations and beat out Hurricanger as the highest earning sentai this century.   I agree with you about Gokaiger and Kyoryuger having nothing to do with Go-Busters lack of success which over the few years which I've seen folks blame everything that went wrong with Go-Busters on Gokaiger. It's almost similar to the Goseiger/Shinkenger situation all over again.
powerrangers,3d7ioy,KyoryuBlue,2,Tue Jul 14 15:20:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they were responsible for its failure in Japan, but the show has a rabid hate base here in the west too, where Gokaiger and Kyoryuger are well loved series. Look at the thread we're discussing this in, dude says he likes Gobusters, gets told he was wrong. I was trying to explain why even western fans disown it, not why it failed in Japan."
powerrangers,3d7ioy,darthboolean,-1,Tue Jul 14 15:18:02 2015 UTC,"oh ok, i thought you were trying to say that gobusters was good and that the reason why it is perceived bad is because of gokaiger and kyoryugers. sorry"
powerrangers,3d7ioy,2-EZ-4-ME,2,Tue Jul 14 15:32:46 2015 UTC,"Well, no, I was saying it was a perfectly serviceable Sentai show that doesn't deserve the rabid hate that it gets, and one of the things that doesn't help is that Gokaiger and Kyoryuger bookmark it and are better series. I personally liked Gobusters, but even I acknowledge that it has its issues, and it's perception in the fandom is in no way helped by the fact that these two better series are right there."

powerrangers,3d6wem,BlindManBaldwin,3,Tue Jul 14 00:09:55 2015 UTC,One of my favorites. It was the last season I watched growing up. I think Ransik gets a bit too much praise as a villian but he is better than most. Jen is one of the most badass badasses of all time in my mind. I heard somewhere that a movie was in the works but it kinda fell through which sucks. The production values are amazing which explains why it holds up so well 14 years later. And the kicker? It has a giant robot that's sole purpose to hit other robots so hard they go back in time.

powerrangers,3d6wem,Zanki,2,Tue Jul 14 02:28:09 2015 UTC,"I love it. At the time Time Force started airing, I was getting tired of the Rangers. Lightspeed, it was good in parts but wasn't really a great season and I was starting to move on and get more into my other shows. Then Fox Kids in the UK decided to start airing Time Force early, instead of having to wait until 2002, Time Force started at the beginning of September, 2001. I got up at 7am for the premier even though it wasn't a school day for me (our school was merging with another so we got an extra two weeks off, which meant an extra week in September). I was intrigued from the start, the first scene with Ransik, Alex running in and capturing him. Twelve year old me was very interested in this more sci-fy show. Then Ransik killed Alex. It was incredible. A Ranger killed. That sold the show for me. Force from the Future PT.1 and 2 aired that morning and I was hyper all day. I loved the characters. They felt more human then, especially Ransik. I loved all the characters, but then came Eric. He was cruel, rude and a complete dick most of the time and he was just awesome. I felt bad for him, then came the episode, Quantum Secrets, when he yelled, ""I work Alone!"" That was it, he became my favourite Ranger from that day forwards. He was like me, I said that because it was easier then trying to get other people to work with me. I loved the Dawn of Destiny arch, Frax's Fury was amazing. I loved Frax's betrayal. Beware the Knight is actually one of my favourite episodes as well, pure American footage for an entire episode, no megazords and it was amazing. Also, gotta love Ransik in Movie Madness, his Mad Max days were back! Also, the start of that episode, the fight with Wes and Frankie Chang was a copy of a fight from Rumble in the Bronx, a Jackie Chan film. Then came End of Time. Three amazing episodes. I can recite them off the top of my head even now. Jen had some really amazing episodes, I love Jen's Revenge. Katie's episode, Legend of the Clock Tower was also really well done. It was goofy, but very interesting.   I love Time Force as you can probably tell. There is just so much about it that I love."

It got to the point that whenever they did the roll call, I got up and did it with them, the whole slapping the ground and jumping into the pose. I had far too much fun doing it as well.   I haven't really done anything since. I do enjoy randomly doing a quick morph or pose in training if the moves are in a kata or form but its very rare.

WF-DT and S/SS are also vigilantes, but it should be noted their powers concern the existence of one threat. When the threat's gone, their power go away. They are situational vigilantes.  MystF and JF are a weirdcross between the two because their skill set is an art that is continually learned, but it was an art specifically learned to combat the threat.  LR, maybe OO, and RPM-Are paramilitary organizations  TF & SPD-Are fully sanctioned organizations.

powerrangers,3cp9gd,wosh,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:29:39 2015 UTC,Looks like I'm gonna pick one up after all. My Ultrazord is currently standing only by the grace of a few rubber bands holding the megazord up.
powerrangers,3cqvf0,count023,3,Fri Jul 10 01:21:59 2015 UTC,"Watch toy reviews of said megazords on youtube. Most reviewers show you how to transform them step by step. Just be sure to watch reviews of the Japanese toys as later seasons tend to change the mold and transformations of toys while the Sentai versions stay true to the show. I've always liked the engineering some combinations have so my main interests stems from the transformation sequences. While I'm here, I'll point out that the T-Rex tail simply folds up against the back of the Megazord. The tip of the tail folds back so it doesn't poke above the Megazord's head (although I don't think the Legacy version of the toy does this). When the mastodon splits, the head becomes the shield and the rest of it attaches to the back. The mastodon's front legs don't fold away and you actually tuck the T-Rex tail between them. The back legs, as seen in the show, do fold around to reveal the fists. You also attach the cannons from the tank mode on them. The tyranno arms simply fold up and they do not get in the way of transformation. The pterodactyl covers them up in Megazord mode.  edit: While I'm here, I'm just gonna post some cool engineering that doesn't show up in the transformations but does in the toys. Earlier seasons showed more of the transformations. As they started using more CG in later on, the sequences became shorter and transformations more complex so not everything is always shown.    MMPR: • The Dragonzord tail attaches behind Titanus. • The lower legs of the Tigerzord in warrior mode combine into a sort of ""skirt"" for the MegaTigerZord. Zeo: • The Sphinx has an interesting transformation in order to form the cavity for the Pheonix to fit in. Turbo: • Turbo was pretty good at showing everything. The only things I remember that it didn't show were the Thunder Loader and Star Racer Rescue Zords' transformations into the Rescue Megazord's legs. Also, we never saw transformations for high-stance mode outside of Lightning Fire Tamer's. In Space through Ninja Storm: • Showed everything/essentials. Nothing too obscure. Dino Thunder: • The Thundersaurus Megazord's head was shown to simply pop out. This is not the case as the head was actually stored inside and attached to the T-Rex's head which could simply be pulled out and plopped onto the main part of the body. There's some interesting mechanics to the T-Rex, especially in the legs and the head in order to properly transform it. SPD: • This transformation isn't canon on the show but when the Delta Squad megazord rides the OmegaMax Cycle, it's show to be sitting in it normally, as if on a normal motorcycle. The toys tend to have more limited articulation (mainly just the arms rotating the 360 and sometimes the legs kicking), so the Green and Blue Delta Runner have to be detached from the Delta Squad and reattached to certain areas on the OmegaMax in order for it too like the toy is riding it. Mystic Force: • Honestly, the transformations were always too fast for me. The line of combinations this season has some of my favorite engineering, mostly seen in the Titan Megazord's dragon and megazord modes. I also enjoyed the Centaurus Pheonix/Wolf Megazord and the Phoenix Unizord's transformations. Operation Overdrive: • The DriveMax Megazord shows you everything but I always had a perception problem when the Dump Driver pushes itself up as the Speed Driver positions itself. I'd always assume it were driving up the back and draping itself of the Dump Driver to form the engine-like chest but it's actually driving up the front. A bit hard to visualize so I'd watch a video. • The Flashpoint Megazord is drop-dead gorgeous in terms of it's transformation. Jungle Fury: • Simple transformations, nothing too crazy. RPM: • The individual Megazord Transformations (High Octane, ValveMax, SkyRev, and PaleoMax) were pretty simple but their combined forms were very interesting. Samurai/Super Samurai: • Another on of my favorite transformations. I would go watch videos of the Shinkenger versions (as the American versions took out the complexities and pretty much ruined them) since theres a bunch of cool intricacies and such with each combined form. Megaforce/Super Megaforce: • I found the Megaforce (Goseiger) mechs pretty simple and boring. Same goes for the Legendary Megazord (Gokaiger) transformations but the past zords that combine with it are interesting. The Q-Rex was pretty cool too. Dino Charge: • Pretty simple transformations at least for the beginning. Don't wanna spoil but there's more in the Kyoryuger footage that I've seen."
powerrangers,3cqvf0,mudkip25,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:47:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for those, really help. Been checking the toys but some of them seem to be designed more to be ""functional and kid tolerant"" in design over canonicity, so I was hoping for something a bit more effective for design. Having said that, still gives me a good idea.  Was curious where the skirt came from on the Tigerzord, so that's cool, didn't realize with Titanius and DZ's tail either, but then again you don't really see it's ass end in the series or Zyu.   Question though, where does the ""long part"" of the Dragonzord Battlemode's spear come from? The drill tip is the DZ's tail spike, and the 6 light module is it's chest, but the bottom of the spear is too narrow to be the rest of it's tail, is it something from the other 3 zords?   Also, are the ninjazord toy configurations representative of ""canon""? I only ever remember seeing that close up of two arms coming together with the head and chest, only really the crane transforms into a functional piece, it almost seems like there was a frame shift transition between the movable individual models for the wolf, frog and tiger and the ""pieces"" of the ninjazord."
powerrangers,3cqvf0,Avol25,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:27:40 2015 UTC,"The shaft/grip of the spear is as far as I know, a ""magic"" piece that basically appears when it's needed.  With the Dragon Zord toy, it's just piece that you use when you need the spear, otherwise it's kinda just lying around until you need it"
powerrangers,3cqvf0,mudkip25,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:07:21 2015 UTC,"I'll just say that transformations deriving from what he Japanese-versions of the toys are canon. Proportions and articulation are not canon. There have been very few Megazords that have been accurate to the show. The only ones coming to mind currently would be Tor, Pyramidas, Artillatron, and the Zenith Carrierzord. Only reason is that they were so huge in both the show and toys that they didn't do much outside of movable arms.    In the case of the Dragonzord in battle mode, the bottom part of the drill staff is actually an accessory piece that comes out of nowhere. A lot of earlier toys had accessory pieces that had no storage with the main toys. A perfect example of this are the swords that come with most Megazords from Mighty Morphin through Time Force. All swords from Wild Force onwards had some sort of storage (the one exception being Samurai in terms of the core megazord). Power rangers is typically good at making storage for things essential to the megazord itself so things like fists, helmets, etc. could be stored somewhere. The weapons however weren't much of a priority so earlier toys threw them in as an accessory. Typically, you saw them materializing out of nowhere when the rangers summoned the sword so it was never a big deal to me. The dragonzord's base for its staff was a mere afterthought however.    As for the Ninja Megazord, I would say look at the toy. The ape and wolf simply fold away their limbs and both gain ""mittens"" (for lack of a better term) that I believe are stored on the bear. Also, don't trust the movie version's depiction. It's inaccurate to the design and function (not that the first movie was canon anyway) and it was kind of an ugly redesign."
powerrangers,3cob1v,itzrayz,3,Thu Jul 9 13:37:08 2015 UTC,"As far as the zyurangers, the biggest difference is that green and red in Japan came with an option for red white and blue neck and belt pieces.  White had an alternate chest piece as an addition.  The other big difference is yellow, as yellow was a dude in Japan.  I have a mix of Japan and American and that's really it.  Best recommendation is go with the wallet in all but yellow, and there go with your preference.  I got Trini.  There are a lot of great places to buy figuarts in general, but many involve long (but cheap) overseas shipping.  Some are also used.  Jungle hobby is a great starting point, as is hobby link Japan.  ALWAYS compare against amazon though, as you might not be saving much and instead just increasing shipping times.    TL:DR Smokey Robinson says shop around."

powerrangers,3cm8hk,m_busuttil,2,Thu Jul 9 00:53:43 2015 UTC,Says who? Every Legacy Zord besides the original Megazord has had die-cast metal and crazy detail. The Megazord was first made for the 2010 toyline and long before Legacy was even a thing. It isn't up to the same standards as everything else. The Thunder Megazord (and Red Dragon) will likely be comparable to the Tigerzord et al.

Not the most fun part, but I'm getting pretty good at it. I didn't make any cutting errors with my last kit. Gotta love owning a Dremel.   What I would really like right now, hmm. I think I would like a new Quantum Ranger costume, this time with a helmet I can see out of (my helmet looks amazing but I can't see a damn thing in it). I need new spandex since mine is falling apart and I would like a belt, gloves, boots and buckle that weren't made by me. Mine weren't that great. Looked good for pictures but that was about it.

LEGO has a long-standing public image of being a toy built for children. This effectively means they can never have any weapon-focused or military-themed sets, or indeed anything that can't be marketed to kids.  Bear in mind LEGO already has the single strongest stable of toy licenses in existence, including Star Wars, Harry Potter, LotR/The Hobbit, both Marvel AND DC Comics, and indeed the Holy Grail of licenses, Disney.  LEGO doesn't need anymore licenses. They are basically printing money with what they have right now."

powerrangers,3bygu0,MrDarkOnion,12,Fri Jul 3 04:52:04 2015 UTC,Don't over think it. Most of the Legendary Battle was just Sentai Footage anyway.
powerrangers,3bygu0,dotyawning,7,Fri Jul 3 12:52:10 2015 UTC,"You've got two potential answers here: one in-universe, one out-of-universe.  The out-of-universe answer is simple: it's footage from a Japanese TV show where they were all different people, and the American editors didn't care enough/think it'd be enough of a problem to edit it out.  The in-universe answer is... well, I don't know that anyone's ever come up with one that would explain all four of those at once. Maybe it's some other people with Tommy's Ranger Keys."
powerrangers,3bygu0,m_busuttil,6,Fri Jul 3 05:46:44 2015 UTC,Maybe it's some other people with Tommy's Ranger Keys.   I'm just gonna tell myself that he gave his brother David one of his morphers.
powerrangers,3bygu0,MZago1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:31:12 2015 UTC,I can think of five people who've previously accessed the morphing grid who wouldn't have powers.
powerrangers,3bygu0,LockeNCole,5,Fri Jul 10 07:07:04 2015 UTC,"My personal head canon is the Morphing Grid supplied duplicates of Rangers with multiple powers. Of course, it looks like they tried to make it be one ranger to suit.  In short, it's stock footage failure."
powerrangers,3bygu0,GenericMan92,3,Fri Jul 3 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"I would like to add to the in-universe answer that u/m_busuttil mentioned. We have 3 total Tommys, which are the current Tommy and two from the past; those past ones are the white stranger from season three and the evil green ranger clone from season two.   Since Tommy was five colors, two red (zeo and turbo), green, white, and black. Red Turbo is taken care of by the robo clone of TJ from Turbo, leaving three Tommys for four rangers, so we only have one we can't account for at all.  The only possibility that I could explain to how we could get a fourth Tommy (or a fourth body to account for a missing ranger), again this is just speculation, is that their was a previous white ranger, since the Japanese season that he is from, Dairanger, is in the photo that the op posted, and also the Dairanger suits do make an appearance in Super Megaforce; pink, yellow, green, and blue appear in one of the earlier episodes (the episode was called ""Earth Strikes Back"", and the dairanger powers were called the squadron powers)."
powerrangers,3bygu0,apacifistman,2,Fri Jul 3 06:11:06 2015 UTC,But we see Zordon and Alpha building the white ranger powers in what is presumed to be the under construction power chamber.   Unless they werent building it but adapting the powers for use on earth.  Which brings up the question of did they adaptvthe other daipowers (squadron)  for use on eartg and that's how they can morph into them. Like they had them ready but never fully transfered them.

powerrangers,3brtup,DoughnutMcCoy,2,Mon Jul 6 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. Power Rangers has always been at its best when it goes against the formula. Just look at RPM or SPD.  Meanwhile, when it tries to use the 'classic' formula, it falls flat on its own face. Hard. Megahard. Megaforcehard. I'm... I'm saying Megaforce was bad, basically."
powerrangers,3brtup,DoughnutMcCoy,2,Mon Jul 6 21:05:46 2015 UTC,"Megaforce was bad. SPD wasn't a walk in the park either. As it was airing it was pretty crappy in it's own right, but then we got Mystic Force and Overdrive. So when you compare those two to SPD it comes out looking better than it was received at the time, though I hold on that after Ninja Storm and Dino Thunder being what they were we were spoiled with solid story telling from Doug and Jackie back then so it's a bit iffy on how bad SPD actually was versus the expectations being higher than what we did or didn't get, but I digress and apologize for the run on sentence.  I'll give you RPM even though Eddie tried to go against the grain and got let go half way through the season(was that ever openly confirmed or am I getting my back channel info mixed again? It's been years and I can't remember if I'd read that on one of the bigger messageboards doing a proto-AMA or if I heard that through friend of friends type situation). To this day, RPM is a really, really refreshing change of pace and one of my favorite seasons ever. It's got the perfect balance of serious overtones and the goofy stuff I love about PR but it doesn't go too far overboard with either aspect."
powerrangers,3brtup,HeavenPiercingMan,2,Mon Jul 6 21:26:22 2015 UTC,"Agree with you on RPM. It had some really clever writing. Like, it didn't get rid of, say, the explosions appearing after a morph, but had the characters question them instead. It was very self aware. :D"
powerrangers,3brtup,27th_wonder,2,Mon Jul 6 21:40:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It was a pretty smart series and it was awesome cause it turned the whole concept on its nose. Like, crazy ass setting? Check.

powerrangers,3brlrc,thePhoenix6,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:48:21 2015 UTC,"This is based on the movie, not the show.   The most prominent feature of Kimberly's leadership is the fact she sits in front and center of the megazord. That seat is usually reserved for the red ranger/leader. Her and Billy being the veterans on the team (aside from Tommty, everything will be aside from Tommy here cuz he's bonafide leader), it makes sense why either would be ahead of Rocky who is not a veteran in context.   The other feature, one that also shows the ranking aside from Tommy, is the morphing order. It is deliberately out of order from the show. Kimberly first, then Billy, Rocky, Adam and Aisha. Now, we know the rankings to be based on color from many iterations of the show, and they go like this: red, blue, black, yellow, pink. So taking that in order, removing Kim and Billy (the vets), you have red, black and yellow which plays into the morphing order of the movie. So the morphing order is actually descending order of rank (aside from Tommy cuz he's always last cuz he's always different). Kim, Billy (the vets), then on ranger color (Rocky, Adam, Aisha). This along with positioning of Kim in the zord, and Billy to her left (our right), it shows she's the leader.   I know I'm not the only who's noticed this. I can't be."

powerrangers,3bdnew,pseducode,4,Sun Jun 28 05:52:28 2015 UTC,"It's like that on purpose. The DX Gekitouja and GekiFire toys (the Japanese version of the Zords) use the spinning as the main gimmick, so Toei, when producing Gekiranger, used the spinning in the zord battles to highlight the features of the DX toys. This of course carried over to Jungle Fury, when Disney decided that they weren't going to spend a lot of money on Power Rangers, so they used the stock footage from Gekiranger."
powerrangers,3bdnew,xerodragon12,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:59:46 2015 UTC,"Ok, that makes sense.  I thought it was crazy that was like 90%+ of the battle was either spinning in circles, or spinning its arms to win the battle.  I didn't think it was as common (well frequent at the very least), in previous series.  Your explanation explains things perfectly though, thanks!"

powerrangers,3bdofy,theblackout94,2,Sun Jun 28 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog:       Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog is an Irish/American television series set in a fantasy version of ancient Ireland, created by Saban Entertainment.  It was loosely based on actual Irish mythology. The name derives from Tír na nÓg, one of the Otherworlds of Irish mythology. It was Saban's first fantasy series to involve knights, dragons, and wizards.  It aired on the Fox Kids block on Fox from September 1, 1998 and ending on May 7, 1999. A second season entitled Mystic Knights: Battle Thunder was planned, but was later cancelled, and its budget was put towards Power Rangers Lost Galaxy. The resulting series was an attempt in doing an original non-Japanese special-effects series rather than adapting from actual Japanese tokusatsu.

powerrangers,3b04vh,WhiskeyMash,2,Fri Jun 26 01:14:42 2015 UTC,"Doraemon:       Doraemon (Japanese: ドラえもん) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by the manga writing team Fujiko Fujio. The series has also been adapted into a successful anime series and media franchise. The story revolves around a robotic cat named Doraemon, who travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a pre-teen boy named Nobita Nobi (野比のび太, Nobi Nobita ?).  The Doraemon manga series was first published in December 1969 in six different magazines. A total of 1,345 stories were created in the original series, which are published by Shogakukan under the Tentōmushi (てんとう虫 ?) manga brand, extending to forty-five volumes. The volumes are collected in the Takaoka Central Library in Toyama, Japan, where Fujiko Fujio was born. Turner Broadcasting System bought the rights to the Doraemon anime series in the mid-1980s for a US English-language release,  but canceled it without explanation before broadcasting any episodes. In July 2013 it was announced that the manga would be released digitally in English via the Amazon Kindle e-book service. It is one of the best-selling manga in the world, having sold over 100 million copies.  Awards for Doraemon include the Japan Cartoonists Association Award for excellence in 1973, the first Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga in 1982,  and the first Osamu Tezuka Culture Award in 1997. In March 2008 Japan's Foreign Ministry appointed Doraemon as the nation's first ""anime ambassador.""  Ministry spokesman explained the novel decision as an attempt to help people in other countries understand Japanese anime better and to deepen their interest in Japanese culture.""  The Foreign Ministry action confirms that Doraemon has come to be considered a Japanese cultural icon. In India, its Hindi translation has been telecasted, where the anime version is the highest-rated kids' show, it won the best Kids' Show award at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards India.  In 2002 the anime character was acclaimed as an ""Asian Hero"" in a special feature survey conducted by Time Asia magazine.  An edited English dub distributed by TV Asahi aired on Disney XD in the United States that started on July 7, 2014 at 12:30 PM, 11:30 AM (Central). The film series is the largest by number of admissions in Japan.

Don't get me wrong, I like the continued story, but it created so many plot holes just like this one. We're lead to believe that the Z-wave destroyed all evil in the universe. As such, the M51 galaxy would have been liberated; however, villains keep appearing. Yes, some of them were locked away or hadn't been created/born/formed yet, but I think the better explanation is that the Z-wave just didn't reach as far as we're meant to believe.  Also, IIRC Gruum and the Armada were both said to have taken over galaxies and yet we never hear anything about that after the first episode of the season. Perhaps they took them over, were defeated, and then came to earth where they have no legacy. It would be nice to see the universe expanded and see what else is going on. Eltar, Trigoria, Aquitar, Mirinoi, wherever Tyzonn and Orion were each from, and all the planets mentioned in SPD are all still out there but we never hear anything about them."
powerrangers,3av1q1,gad-gada,2,Tue Jun 23 19:39:42 2015 UTC,"I agree it would be nothing short of awesome to see the state of some others worlds and how other galaxies and see how the rest of the universe gets by without the Power Rangers. The only other non-Ranger hero we have seen is Masked Rider (and BeetleBorgs if you count them) but to see other world's heroes would be cool. I also think the most major problem with Space was that it was supposed to be the end but of course they needed to continue the series. For continuity sake they need to explain the Z-Wave more but I doubt it will happen.  And when it comes to the future series such as SPD we can only kind of guess what happens, but given that size of SPD and it's influence they could possibly save the universe but it would be nice to see it liberated."

Most of this was dialog banter about diplomacy or revenge. I understand that this is a fan film, but most of this could have been cut. We understand that the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad, however having a council meeting and the destruction of a planet just for juxtaposition seemed kind of forced. Most of everyone who will watch this is a fan of the show, we know why the characters are good or bad, this didn't really add anything new.  A few character actors were cringe worthy (Divatox), but it's a fan film, I understand you can't get good acting on a limited budget. The inclusion of Saba was unnecessary, it leaves Alpha basically useless. Also everyone declares Zordon as ""Zordon of Eltar"" way too much, to the point you could make a drinking game out of this.  In the end, it was okay, nothing I'd call a masterpiece. I'd rather watch the Power/Ranger fan film over this one. While shorter, it had a better story. This fan film is just fan service, throwing name after name from the show. If you wanted to show how Rita and Zordon got to where they are at the beginning of the tv show, fine, but there was a better way to do it."

Ok, it was awesome how they added in so many people, but it got a little old quite quickly. I did like how Zordon was the white tiger, that was cool.   Other then that, poor acting, which isn't surprising, it's a fan piece, I can get past that. The music choices were good, I just hope the film doesn't get taken down for music copyright infringement. It's actually pretty cheap to hire a good composer and ask them to create what you need. I recently had to hire one for a game I'm working on and the music he's come out with is amazing. Maybe they should think about doing it next time instead of using copyrighted material.   Overall. I liked it a lot. Saban is never going to go back and make this stuff. There is an entire universe out there in the Ranger stuff that we haven't explored and so many stories that we will never know. Fan films really are the way forwards here."

powerrangers,3a959t,kinght6,6,Thu Jun 18 05:26:34 2015 UTC,"I had this thought a few weeks ago:  I would stick to the original plot of Toqger: That kids turned into adults, but are a little more adventurous than their Sentai counterparts. Conductor and Ticket are there (but ticket isn't a puppet.... something other than a puppet) but I would get rid of Wagon OR would tone her down quite a bit.  The story of the Shadow Line would suffice for enemies, however I would change up the dynamic between Gritta and Emperor Z where they were already married but her and her mom, Madame Noir, would work towards taking over - just like Rita tried to do to Zedd in seasons 2 and 3.  Name for it would be Power Rangers: Rail Riders, and would use elements from the Toqger theme song. I actually wanted to have a friend of mine write up a ""what if"" theme song for it using the same melody as the Toqger theme. Might still do that."
powerrangers,3a959t,Shermanmanman,2,Thu Jun 18 08:08:59 2015 UTC,"I have an entire Excel sheet dedicated to this.  General Stuff  The working title is either Power Rangers: Frontier or Power Rangers: TOQ (Technology Operation Questers). One major change for the series tone: The team isn't powered by imagination, they are powered by hope.  Early on, I would introduce a silver ""Liner Mode"" the team can use as a power-up precursor to the Golden Hyper Engine. It's inspired by Dino Steel/Armed On and mainly there there to add more color and accents to the suit's ""preschool"" appearance/make them look less plain..  I also have a proposal for original zord footage, but it would be unlikely for this series. The enemies, using their night/shadow powers occasionally warp mecha battle to an alternate dimension. Production wise, they wouldn't have to worry about working with scale models, and the crew can implement their own aesthetic.   I mainly want to do this to see if we can modify the toys. The red engine becomes interchangeable with the others. Any of the core trains can become the centerpiece like Ohranger/Ninninger and have a different weapon (Gun, Hammer, Axe, Claw).   Season 1 Plot-20 Episodes  My version starts off with original content: 10 years ago we see the rangers evacuating a city dedicated to technology and progress. They grow up as refugees, hiding from the Shadow Line's counterpart.  In the present, the Pink Ranger plans to take back their home using the Engine Liners, but is ambushed by a group of Yorus (Kuros). The others come to her aid, and they become a team, fighting against General Nacht (Schwarz), Baron Notte (Nero), Madame Nuit (Noir), and Lady Noche (Grita).  The middle section of the first season doesn't plan to use a lot of original fight footage, but the circumstances surrounding the events  have some drastic differences, Marionette Shadow/Shade is a notable one that comes to mind, detailed below.  Eventually, Emperor Night joins the show. But the team gets a new ally, Trova, formerly known as Colonel Lail. The first season  ends at Episode 20, roughly following the same events as 21-23 of TOQger, however I believe it'll serve as an even bigger cliffhanger due to the break in airing. As for season 2, things have a major switch up from TOQger, barring a few filler episodes.  Characters  Austin, the snarky red ranger with a Robin Hood lifestyle, son of a security officer. Virgil, worrisome blue ranger and son of an academic dean. Trina, the determined yet distrustful yellow ranger and daughter of blue collar laborers. Oliver, the stoic yet secretly feminine green ranger and the son of laboratory researchers. Ruby, the proper yet free-spirited daughter of important financial investors. Trova (who's name was an acronym created from the others' names) was formerly the Rain Shade, Colonel Lail, and now atones for his crimes.  Assisting them are the perky robot, Lark (Wagon) and eventually the original developer of the Engine Liners, Herman (Conductor). Added to the cast are occasional guest stars who know each of the Rangers during the ""lost years"" and provide support engines to the team. They are Bryce (Austin), Dahlia (Virgil), Lana (Trina), and Jerome (Oliver). Herman and Lark take this role for Ruby.  The villains are more or less the same as their TOQger counterparts, though I'm teetering on whether I want to make Nacht be Nuit's former lover and the secret father of Noche or keep their dynamic the same. However, Emperor Night (Z) and Marchioness Nox (Morc) have major rewrites in the plot, but not in character.  Misc.  The series overall follows a progression vs. tradition conflict, with each side having their own faults and strengths. The trains act as a metaphor for this conflict (from an American perspective, given their irregular use) by being a technology that is simultaneously abandoned and developed.  As for interpretation of fight sequences, some of the goofier aspects are retconned into being the Rangers pining for the innocence they lost and sharing their dream in a moment of victory.  Some monsters have alternate interpretations: Marionette Shade has the same basic plot and power as his Shadow counterpart, but he mainly targets Trina because he feels they are connect in their shared manipulation of people, something Trina refuses to confront. Seal Shadow is now Wax Shade, and he's instead turning people into wax sculptures.   Like I said above, the second season keeps some of the stock footage, but has a different focus for the overall narrative. During their travels, the Rangers want to know more about the Empire they're fighting and its origins, something even Trova/Lail doesn't know. Time travel becomes an important aspect when they encounter Marchioness Nox (Morc).  Overall, TOQger was a season about growing up and facing life's challenges using imagination. The team is group of childhood companions who are unbroken, save for a few moments. My take would be more about broken people who have grown up after being separated from each other as children. They are working to become friends again and finding the hope they lost."

Incidently I forgot to mention the Shadow Line's counterpart is the Eon Era Empire, also referred to as Triple E (this is mainly ti make them the antithesis of TOQ, by having an alliterative abbreviation rather than chaotic).  Night and Nox's rewrites  reveal their true goals. Without giving too much away, the best description would be: the right to exist. Overall, the group's origin is part of Noche's character arc."
powerrangers,3a959t,FusedRage,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:22:20 2015 UTC,"Kinda like Mystic Force with another dimension heavily involved with the plot. This time it would be a steampunk world.  I'd also like the 6th Ranger to be a Ranger from a past series. That would not only spice things up, but make Power Rangers seem like it has a much more living, breathing universe. It would also reduced the amount of generic and forgettable throwaway characters that PR has had every few years. Preferably I'd probably have Chip from MF. I know he's not popular, but his actor does voices in almost every series so he is available and it would he would have some expertise dealing with a team that has strong ties with another dimension.  I would completely remove the kids to adults storyline. I would also remove IMAGINATION as their power source. IMO, Power Rangers should try to be its own thing most of the time. As other people have mentioned here, the silly attacks with the bazooka would just be replaced with generic explosions. Obviously the penis mecha joke that happened in the first couple of episodes would not be used. (LOL) Different base. Different mentor. No puppets.  I'd probably keep the implied nationalities of the enemy generals intact and give them accents to match. The big boss would just be the transformed version of Z. No unmorphed footage. (Not that it would be usable anyways) I'd probably skip the storyline where he comes in later, and have him there from the start.  The colour changes would actually be explained rather than being just for fun. They would get stronger using each others powers and there would be a strong recurring theme of teamwork and being in each others shoes - focusing on their differences and how they are also similar.  As for the toyline, I would probably just try to swing a deal with the guys who make Thomas the Tank Engine and see if some crossover toys could be made."

powerrangers,3a959t,NeoMegaRyuMKII,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:07:56 2015 UTC,"The ""Shadow Line"" (I put it in quotes because I don't know what I would call them) has taken over many sectors of the universe. It's goal is not total destruction but total control over universal resources. They work to create universal trade routes by learning what products each sector uses and building networks to monopolize manufacturing, distribution, and sales of the product. When the ""Shadow Line"" comes to Earth, a stunt man (red), a software engineer (blue), a farm worker (yellow), a college student (green), and a babysitter (pink) are all recruited by a construction worker (future Orange) to fight the ""Shadow Line"" and prevent Earth from becoming just another station for the Shadows.  Basically it will have an anti-monopoly sort of message. The Shadow monsters will, instead of just being based on inanimate objects for no reason whatsoever will be so because they represent certain areas in consumerism. Syringe Shadow's episode might have the Shadows try to take over the medical industry. Seal Shadow might get something to do with ""this is mine!"" Coin Shadow would get a lot of importance in his episodes as he would be one to try to introduce the Shadow's currency (and the episode will obviously have a ""money isn't everything"" tone).   The villains would all be one small but happy family. Nero would be top-ranking finance worker. He is the younger brother of Noir, who will be the head of R&D. She is married to Schwarz, the one charge of transporting goods. Their daughter is Grita, who is kind of a spoiled brat since her mommy and daddy are so important (but she is still pretty skilled). Later, we will meet Morc, Schwarz' twin sister, who is a traveling manager (goes through the various sectors and ensures all the work is done). Z will obviously be the ""founder/CEO."" He will be Schwarz's and Morc's father (he very much approves of Schwarz' marriage to Noir)."

I know that it could have been good if it tried to take itself seriously (which does not mean the show had to be serious) and I think that the motif I suggested in how to adapt would at least tell a mature story for children."

powerrangers,3a8ctf,Miro0161,2,Sat Jun 20 16:24:57 2015 UTC,I was going to do this too but then after some research I found EntEarth was a good place to buy stuff so I ordered it back in March and my Megazord came yesterday

powerrangers,3a646e,RembrandtEpsilon,2,Wed Jun 17 17:58:57 2015 UTC,For me in terms of story telling it's got to be Gaim To ToQger. The cross over episode was jarring in terms of tone especially with what was happening in Gaim at the time.

Ikebekuro has the Kamen Rider Resturant (it's really awesome) and a walkable Toys R Us (about a 5-10 minute walk from the station). There was also a really cool toy store in Harajuku but you will have to google it to find it. I can't remember what it was called but it was good for Rider/Sentai toys.
powerrangers,3a5kxi,Zanki,0,Mon Jun 22 01:54:23 2015 UTC,"Bandai Museum: http://www.bandai-museum.jp/  Toei Hero World: http://toei-heroworld.jp/index.php  This is pretty much what you want. Entry is 1400 yen, about 12 bucks. The 2000 yen super passport allows you unlimited use of four attractions and a coin for the Hero Dojo. Lots of Ninninger stuff, of course. A lot of the attractions, however, are aimed at kids because, well, they would be. Get there via Keiyo line to Kaihinmakuhari or Shinnarashino. Alts: JR Sobu, Keisei Chiba.  A bonus if you get down to Kyoto: http://www.toei-eigamura.com/en/  When last I was at the Eigamura, they had a shit ton of Sentai stuff there. Like all the red suits on mannequins, the last few full teams in their mecha cockpits and shit like the Mega Dragonzord and ShinkenGold's sushi cart, along with assorted riders and a three-story tall Kamen Rider Ichigo with a working (as in spinning) belt. However, that stuff might have been moved to Hero World, which didn't exist when I visited in 2010."

powerrangers,39z8ic,Miro0161,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:05:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. They are a pretty popular site. If you have email confirmation from original order, email their customer service. If you don't have that email I would guess that you'd be SOL. Hope it gets resolved."
powerrangers,39z8ic,Miro0161,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:57:57 2015 UTC,"I figured it out. I was a new customer when I preordered them and about two days later they emailed me wanting to confirm a few things about my credit card and in the fine print of the email it said if they didn't hear from me within 10 days the order would be automatically canceled. I didn't notice the email because the sender didn't come up EE but had an actual person's name so I either thought it was a scam or just ignored it thinking it was some sort of spam. But yeah, that's why so I'm pretty pissed at the moment. My fault but at the same time I've never seen a site handle shit like that, especially having their flunkies send you mail with those handles."

powerrangers,39rmlv,rocketman500,8,Sun Jun 14 12:41:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I wish they went back to unmorphed fights. The new series has a few if I'm not mistaken.
powerrangers,39rmlv,Miro0161,8,Sun Jun 14 02:32:36 2015 UTC,It's just to show how the older rangers were very athletic when compared to now
powerrangers,39rmlv,Avol25,3,Sun Jun 14 02:43:29 2015 UTC,"I'm working my way through the series from the very beginning, and while I'm only on Zeo, I'm already noticing the shift to more morphed only fights. Heck, even during MMPR with the Tenga fights there were more morphed than unmorphed fights."
powerrangers,39rmlv,IAmTheWalkingDead,5,Sun Jun 14 08:02:49 2015 UTC,It might just be easier to use the stunt-people in full costume whipping out the choreography at a fair pace rather than do unmorphed fights where you have to piece it all together and sub out actors and actresses for their stunt doubles at times.

powerrangers,39arey,REDcamp,2,Wed Jun 10 15:54:16 2015 UTC,"Im using heavy card stock which is working quite well. I dont intend to wear it, or even cut it to be worn. I would eventually like to have all of them just to display. The fiberglass part seems simple enough, its the bondo and sanding part that makes me nervous. Id hate to spend all this time putting it together just to ruin it at its penultimate stage."
powerrangers,39arey,REDcamp,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:27:04 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I'm making a Mighty Morphin Power Spartan costume, but I've done the card stock approach with a chest plate back when I was in high school. If you're sanding by hand and have few layers of resin built up, you should be fine, though I'd avoid bigger grain papers."
powerrangers,39arey,Metalmaster7,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:47:35 2015 UTC,I'm working on a Kamen Rider Wizard helmet. Sanding is quite hard. You want to use 60 grit sand paper and maybe one with a higher grit just to make it smoother. I would recommend getting an orbital sander since sanding is a bitch.   However that project is on hiatus since I'm waiting for my friend to give me a quote for 3d printing the helmet.

The fact that news outlets are reporting the logo at all is amusing, but the fact that fan sites have turned a logo into a ""teaser poster"", when what is depicted is (a) not a teaser and (b) not even a poster, just shows how desperate the fansites are to scoop each other, even when not posting anything of worth."

The second half of Dino Charge will focus on more character development for the core team as well as the introduction of the ""Gold Ranger"". Factor in also the defeat of Sledge and the introduction of the ""Violet Ranger"". Dino Super Charge will be carnival mode and more introductions of new villains and rangers. That's 20 episodes, stretched over 2 years.  With a very long and tedious gap. I trust Judd, but the suits are painting him in an almost impossible situation. Judd is a story teller. A damn good one.

powerrangers,38yrr3,buddyskinner,5,Mon Jun 8 00:00:54 2015 UTC,PR/Sentai Figuarts aren't completely dead yet (i hope). But their terrible sales are making them put out less and less.  Nope to all of those.  In Space seems to be most likely one to get figuarts out of those choices since it's sentai counterpart is also well liked.  Turbo/Carranger has almost no chance in hell of getting figuarts. Although if they decide to Reds for every season then it has a chance.  Not sure about the likleiness for Zeo/Time Force. I don't know what the general opinion is on their sentai counterparts.
powerrangers,38yrr3,InfinityRider,2,Mon Jun 8 01:26:07 2015 UTC,"I think you're confusing Ohranger with Carranger.  Carranger was hugely loved in Japan, if they continue with what they're doing with Figuarts at the moment, I'd say Carranger is one of the next most likely season after Sun Vulcan.  Ohranger is the season that was said to have ""almost killed Sentai"".  Which isn't true, but did have very low ratings and .  Timeranger is in pretty much exactly the same as its Power Rangers counterpart (which was largely copy and pasted anyway).  It's well regarded, but generally forgotten against the bigger shows that directly followed it and came before (Megaranger, Gaoranger, Abaranger, etc).  The Sentai Figuarts are just in a weird spot where nothing they do seems to work.  Considering this months Sun Vulcan two pack is the only release for the entire year, it's safe to say they're probably taking a break for a while.  With any luck, they'll try something else for the 40th anniversary next year."

powerrangers,38wvyg,TheWillCooper,21,Sun Jun 7 15:02:10 2015 UTC,"I'll just requote a post I made from a previous thread.   I'll give you a quick run through; A tl;dr if I may...  • Mighty Morphin - You already know about... • Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers - 10 episode mini series where the Alien Rangers from the planet Aquitar fill in for the rangers • Zeo - Continuation of MMPR. Mighty Morphin Rangers get new powers to fight machine empire.  Turbo - Continuation of Zeo. Zeo Rangers get new powers, minus Rocky who gets replaced with a kid. Most fans dislike Turbo. • In Space - Continuation of Turbo and last of the original continuous PR storyline. Their in space now and it's a pretty epic end to the original story. Many fans love Space. • Lost Galaxy - First independent series (although some elements return from In Space outside of the team up episode). Rangers are on a ship set to find a new Earth-like planet and defend the space colony, Terra Venture, from aliens. The fandom likes Lost Galaxy. • Lightspeed Rescue - Rangers are made up of public service workers and are recruited by the military organization, Lightspeed Rescue, to fight evil demons. The fandom likes this series for being different and more realistic. Also, we get our first American-exclusive ranger, the Titanium Ranger. • Time Force - HOLY BALLS POWER RANGERS FROM THE FUTURE!!! Quality writing and the only time the cast is made of fully seasoned actors. The fandom loves this series almost as much Space. Basically, the rangers go back in time to stop a mutant fugitive from escaping to the past, the year 2001. • Wild Force - Power Rangers harness the power of animals to fight orgs, who want to pollute the earth. It's very ""meh"". People are so-so on the season. It's not the worst though. I personally enjoyed it. • Ninja Storm - First Power Rangers series shot in New Zealand and made by Disney. Basically, the rangers are ninjas this season. It's a little above the level of Wild Force in the fandom's eyes. • Dino Thunder - Tommy returns and three rangers (later, five) harness the power of dinosaurs to fight [evil monster of the day]. Pretty good, about the same level likability as Lightspeed. • SPD - Space Patrol Delta, a futuristic police force in the year 2025 where rangers arrest alien criminals who commit crimes. The fandom loves this season. It's kind of a mix of In Space and Time Force. • Mystic Force - Their wizards! Very Lord of the Rings-esque. It's alright. Wild Force level-series. The fandom's pretty ""meh"" about it. This is where Disney begins to stop caring about the franchise. • Operation Overdrive - An Indiana Jones-type season where the rangers travel the globe in search of treasure. Terrible writing, horrible season. Most fans do not like this season. • Jungle Fury - A martial arts based season. We get our second, third, and fourth American-exclusive rangers here in the form of the spirit rangers. I'd say it's a Lightspeed-quality season but it tends to fly under the fandom's radar. • RPM - Disney's last season so the execs said FUCK IT and made remade Terminator in Power Rangers form. It's really good and easily the most mature and dark Power Rangers has EVER been. It's set in a post Apocalyptic setting where machines rule. Most of the fandom LOVES this season but there are some who think it's too much a departure from the typical PR mantra of goofiness and non-sensibility. • Samurai - First season back with Saban and under Nick. Pretty terrible. A literal copy-paste of it's Sentai counterpart, Shinkenger. Pretty poorly written, directed, and acted. It's safe to say the fandom hates it. • Super Samurai - Due to Nick enforcing a 20 episode per year policy, there are two seasons. Same thing here with Samurai but I did find the writing to have gotten a smidge better. Otherwise, it's still pretty bad. • Megaforce - No longer a copy-paste! However, there is no creativity or love put into the writing... Since you've already seen it, I'll spare you the details, it's pretty bad. • Super Megaforce - Even worse! Butchers the PR continuity by introducing rangers who never existed before and wasted perfectly good opportunities to celebrate the franchise by doing so. They were pretty much using as much of the Sentai footage as possible and doing as little writing around it as possible. The cameo of rangers isn't even worth it at the end as they barely even appear for more than a minute each. On top of that, some of the returning rangers weren't even given lines or at least a camera shot to acknowledge them. Easily the WORST Power Rangers season ever and the fan community can agree.    I know I said tl;dr but I get too passionate sometimes haha! Just find a season and enjoy or dislike it! It all depends on your taste! Your opinion should be all that matters."

Avoid Overdrive, Mystic Force, Samurai, Super Samurai, Megaforce and Super Megaforce. I wouldn't wish any of Samurai or Mega on my worst enemy. That includes the Samurai non-team up with RPM.   Samurai does have Bulk but he and Skull's son Spike don't serve much purpose for advancing plots, unlike Bulk and Skull back in the day. That said, Skull's five second cameo in the Super Samurai finale is the only worthwhile moment of the first few neo-Saban years. And that includes Legendary Battle, which was a waste of time."

powerrangers,38wvyg,SteveRudzinski,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:23:51 2015 UTC,"Mighty Morphin, the season that started it all.  Zeo, in my eyes, is one of the better seasons. A new, unique threat, that sadly fell into the same old Rita and Zedd plan. King for a Day was an interesting episode.  Despite people talking bad about Turbo, it wasn't a terrible season, and it picked up after there was had a changing of the guard."
powerrangers,38zq7w,DerrickP13,2,Mon Jun 8 04:56:39 2015 UTC,"Overall... eh... I (am one of admittedly relatively few that) really didn't like ToQGer.   I see you did put more than a little effort into this but overall it doesn't seem too different or any less child-like than ToQGer. I know that Sentai and PR are meant for children but let's look back. Think about seasons like In Space, Lost Galaxy, Time Force, SPD, and RPM. They tell mature stories for children. I felt like ToQGer is an insult to intelligence.   I think that, Like Shinkenger, ToQGer was too Japanese for sake of PR adaptations (with that said it should also be noted that I disliked Samurai/Super Samurai even more so than I disliked Overdrive, and that's saying a lot). The US doesn't really have a big obsession with trains.   I don't really know how I would have changed the story but it might involve a lot of travel to real distinct locations (instead of just different cities).   A prospective synopsis of what I might have done with it:  ""The ""Shadow Line"" (I put it in quotes because I don't know what I would call them) has taken over many sectors of the universe. It's goal is not total destruction but total control over universal resources. They work to create universal trade routes by learning what products each sector uses and building networks to monopolize manufacturing, distribution, and sales of the product. When the ""Shadow Line"" comes to Earth, a stunt man (red), a software engineer (blue), a farm worker (yellow), a college student (green), and a babysitter (pink) are all recruited by a construction worker (future Orange) to fight the ""Shadow Line"" and prevent Earth from becoming just another station for the Shadows.""  Basically it will have an anti-monopoly sort of message. The Shadow monsters will, instead of just being based on inanimate objects for no reason whatsoever will be so because they represent certain areas in consumerism. Syringe Shadow's episode might have the Shadows try to take over the medical industry. Seal Shadow might get something to do with ""this is mine!"" Coin Shadow would get a lot of importance in his episodes as he would be one to try to introduce the Shadow's currency (and the episode will obviously have a ""money isn't everything"" tone).   The villains would all be one small but happy family. Nero would be top-ranking finance worker. He is the younger brother of Noir, who will be the head of R&D. She is married to Schwarz, the one charge of transporting goods. Their daughter is Grita, who is kind of a spoiled brat since her mommy and daddy are so important (but she is still pretty skilled). Later, we will meet Morc, Schwarz' twin sister, who is a traveling manager (goes through the various sectors and ensures all the work is done). Z will obviously be the ""founder/CEO."" He will be Schwarz's and Morc's father (he very much approves of Schwarz' marriage to Noir).  Just my thoughts, though."
powerrangers,38zq7w,NeoMegaRyuMKII,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"I like the general idea, but I feel like you can build on the villains a little better. Instead of monopolizing resources in every city (I like the idea for some of the bigger events in the story though), maybe they are simply trying to make way for their rail line, like the early days of the American Locomotive industry, where top businessmen would simply order the destruction of large swaths of land to lay down more track so they could get to the important places faster.  Or, we can use the wars of the late 1800's and early 1900's as a theme. Back in those days, train systems were vital to the war effort. Most strategists believed that whoever had the faster trains getting supplies and troops to the front would ultimately win any battle. Maybe someone could build off of those ideas to write motivations for both sides of the conflict, ""Rainbow Line"" vs ""Shadow Line"", two different railways holding the fate of a huge war in their hands."
powerrangers,38zq7w,Darth_Xavier,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:42:32 2015 UTC,I absolutely loved ToQGer. I don't understand why it was so hated. I thought it had a great story behind it and it also helps that I like trains.
powerrangers,38zq7w,BeatMySteam,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:52:43 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for myself regarding why I didn't like it, of course, but I will still explain.  First, the humor it tried to use was lame. It tried to mirror Kyoryuger (which I loved) in the silliness, but it failed at it miserably. The humor seemed to be there for the sake of humor and not really fitting the characters. Speaking of which, half the characters seemed like copypastas from Kyoryuger. Red is the hungry guy who could not be corrupted and is best at just going into the fray. Blue was the klutz goofball, and green was the serious brooding one. However, while Souji (KyoryuGreen) was probably my least favorite ranger in his series, Hikari (ToQ4 (green)) was probably my favorite of the ToQGers. He was the only one in the core 5 who actually knew how to take the mission seriously. Going back to Kyoryuger, while it had its humor, it knew how to take itself seriously while still having fun. Kyoryuger showed us how the characters take their mission seriously when needed. I didn't feel that while watching ToQGer  I know that the story tells us they are children trapped in adult bodies but they make their childlike minds too childlike. It also doesn't really explain why they took children instead of young adults who work in industries that require imagination (from varied arts, for example).   Second, I really didn't feel any connection to the rangers. Their overall story is pretty sympathetic, I'll admit that, but they don't even try to be proactive in fighting the Shadows until Akira came in. Akira is the only one who is really given something to do and we see it all affecting him. The core rangers' town being gone and the search is addressed sometimes but it doesn't really seem to affect the rangers. Worse, they don't really develop. I don't really feel like they did anything beyond fight and most of the MOTWs didn't really feel like threats and I didn't feel any sense of consequence.  Another thing I really disliked were the zords. Their aesthetic was so unpleasing.   The best part of the season was the villains but that doesn't go very far to help the season. The interfighting and distrust was good and while there were consequences there still wasn't enough. The villains seem evil for evil sake. for reference:   Deboth wanted their former glory Vagras wanted to finish a job Zangyack was an empire working to conquer the universe and Earth was just another stepping stone the Yuumajuu wanted to make Earth habitable for them under circumstance that it mostly wasn't at the time Burajira had a savior complex the Gedoshu were already in a tribal war the Gaiark could not properly control their world so they took over another the varied evil clans in Boukenger were more concerned with the Precious (treasures) the Infershia had a history with the magicians the villains in Dekaranger (since there was no central villain group unlike in its SPD adaptation) were regular criminals so they were stopped by police; crime is an actual issue   There really was no established reason for why the Shadow Line want to conquer beyond a belief in their own superiority. The worst parts of the villains was their defeats. Schwartz and Noir did have pretty spectacular deaths but having both die in the same episode and both by the hands of Zed just felt lazy and it showed how little the rangers could have done. Nero and Mork both sacrificed themselves for Zed, so once again the Rangers didn't do much. And in the end, Grita and Zed were both alive.   I watched all episodes and really, this is how I felt. There were good moments, sure, but the majority was not good for me. I think the writers were still trying to recover from Go-Busters. The same seems kind of true with Ninninger, which I currently think of as average. Go-Busters tried to take itself more seriously and while it wasn't that great it did an excellent job with the story and characters. This is a general summary of what I felt and I might have written more but at the time I am writing this, Chinese food beckons."
powerrangers,38zq7w,NeoMegaRyuMKII,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:29:21 2015 UTC,"I think Power Rangers could be more like Super Sentai in the tone department, some seasons are darker and more mature while other seasons are much lighter and more fun for kids. You can have it both ways every other year.  But since Saban has already made the past few years TOO kid friendly it wouldn't really be needed for a season like this.  Dino Charge is better for sure though, but I don't want it to be a diamond in the rough of Neo-Saban."

We don't know if we'll get Toqger after that so we'll have to wait and see.
