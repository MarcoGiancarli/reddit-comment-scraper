TwoSentenceHorror,3dgk7d,niels_henrik_abel,3,Sat Jul 18 22:46:02 2015 UTC,"So, the bit that rubbed me the wrong way is the dishonesty between the two sentences. The first sentence boils down to: ""It is a werewolf."" The second sentence boils down to: ""It is a zombie.""  Good twists aren't hard facts replacing other hard facts. Good twists were 'there all along'. The reader is left with a feeling of 'Ohhhhhh.... why didn't I realize that?!'  I think the idea of ""person thinks they can kill beast, person has wrong beast in mind"" is totally workable. In fact, merely removing the positive claim that 'yes, this is a werewolf' goes a long way:  ""I loaded my only silver bullet, prayed, and shot it through the heart just as it pounced.  Unfortunately, it was a zombie.""  </$0.02> </armchaircriticism>"

My older one runs into walls and practically melts off chairs because he's so fat. Owl faced cat... He will purr the instant you touch him and I can do literally anything to him and he doesn't care. And the smaller one is just a jealous pile of cuddles
