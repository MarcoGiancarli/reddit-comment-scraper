His net worth exceeds $30 million.  And no, winning the Mr. O is harder than winning the Super Bowl. Every year roughly 100 people get Super Bowl rings. Every year 1 person in the world wins the title of Mr. Olympia. He's one of the most successful that ever lived. Jay Cutler the QB is an average NFL caliber QB. I know that being An NFL caliber talent is nothing to scoff at, but neither is qualifying to compete in the Olympia."
