If I had the option not to kill certain things I would. But the game doesn't give me a choice. So I do it for the sake of progression. It's an interesting thought experiment in a way because I didn't make this game. I can make the choice to play it, but the level design forces me to make the decisions that I made. I can't even go back because...well that's impossible, so I don't have the choice to return. I could just stop playing but...I'll end up doing that when I get to the end anyway. A very interesting concept I'd love to see more fleshed out, but perhaps with the avatar working together with the player rather then just hating me for...reasons?"

WebGames,3dymjh,not-working-at-work,6,Tue Jul 21 13:59:41 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone OPs here, we've been seeing the feedback here and thought we should explain things a bit more.    So, first, you're right. We also feel there is a nonsense - and the resulting frustration - between the fact that the hero is mad at the player & insulting him, and the fact that the player can't actually do anything about it (i.e go back to the castle or not kill the dragons).  A bit of history, though: this game was first made this year as a school project by french game design students, over the course of 2 months. It was really ugly back then, but the concept was promising. Now we (OPs) work at a production agency called Yodog, and when we saw the game during the jury, we thought, 'hey, this could be a cool thing'. So we took the students in-house for another month and help them remake the whole thing (mainly the graphics and polishing).  And here we are. Initially, the idea was indeed to provide the player with multiple choices and the corresponding hero's reactions. It would have been really cool. We didn't do it for a number of reasons: - Obviously, it would have dramatically increased the development time. This was only a 2/3 month project, after all. - The game is made with Construct 2, which is a visual-scripting engine. Our fear was that the engine could not withstand the added complexity, and the team did not had the time or skills to port it to, say, Unity. - We felt the risk would be to end up with a Stanley Parable clone (even if the team actually had a ton of ideas to dig in a different direction).  Sadly, there's nothing much that can be done about that anymore - this will probably be a lesson learned the hard way. Except maybe the wording? Do you guys think the overall feeling would be different with a bit of dialog tweaking?  Anyway, thanks for playing the game, and sorry for the long comment. ;)  Edit: formatting"

WebGames,3dnbtl,acleverlie421,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:49:31 2015 UTC,It's a booklet I Kickstarted after writing a series of well-received posts to /r/trees.

WebGames,3dnid8,Jack2671,5,Fri Jul 17 18:35:33 2015 UTC,"Here's some tips if anyone wants them. It's up to you if you want to follow them:  gunmen are incredibly important and awesome past 20. A good number to have is around 60. Though feel free to go past that (I got to 140 eventually)  don't buy any gun except shotgun and the gun you will use endgame (generally that's old glory)  shield towers are useful in late game. Don't get 3 though as the third makes little difference.  getting the right stuff early is important. For example, upgraded your wall should be left till later as it shouldn't be getting hit in the early levels  Your main fire power late game will be your gunmen and (sometimes) your towers. Keep that in mind  Laser towers are better than missile turrets from middle to late game as your army of gunmen will take out anything that's weak  Repairmen won't seem to important from day 20-35-ish if you're playing right, but it's good to stock up for levels ~38+  Have fun:)"

If you could keep it to keyboard only for turning and placing the ships, I'd leave a happy man.  *Edit, I won in 40 moves!"
WebGames,3dkdm8,HairyBallsOfJeebus,5,Fri Jul 17 00:23:44 2015 UTC,"Ha, nice one! I guess my robot isn't infallible after all.  Good idea about the keyboard - maybe I'll make the space bar place the ships... 'T' for turn?  Edit: More keyboard controls added!"

WebGames,3dkdm8,PhaethonPrime,10,Fri Jul 17 14:17:30 2015 UTC,"Is ""if you get a hit you can move again"" a normal battleship rule? Have I been playing it wrong this whole time?"
WebGames,3dkdm8,C477um04,2,Fri Jul 17 03:25:14 2015 UTC,"That was my question, too. I went and checked on Hasbro's site, and the original rules give only 1 shot per turn. You also have to say what kind of ship got hit when it gets hit."
WebGames,3dkdm8,PhaethonPrime,5,Fri Jul 17 03:42:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, the more common rule is that you only announce which ship is hit once the ship has been sunk.

If enough people would rather play one hit at a time, it wouldn't be hard to add a toggle switch for that rule!  Edit: Toggle switch added!"
WebGames,3dkdm8,DdCno1,5,Fri Jul 17 12:42:29 2015 UTC,I think you probably should. It seems a strange rule to me as well and really unbalances it when the ai gets lucky a few times in a row.

WebGames,3dkdm8,fireball_73,2,Fri Jul 17 13:51:55 2015 UTC,Why is there th 5 second pauses some times and not others?
WebGames,3dkdm8,asha1985,2,Fri Jul 17 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"The AI hits the square with the highest probability of having a ship on it. In general, the pauses are caused by how complicated it is to figure out probabilities for the game, because of the enormous number of permutations of ship locations.  I put the first 10 moves (without hitting a ship) into the code manually to speed things up. Otherwise, early in the game, there are a lot of configurations to count. Later on, with some misses and sunk ships, the permutations are reduced to a manageable number and the results are almost instantaneous.  You can read more about it on the methodology page if you're curious!"
WebGames,3dkdm8,Shadow14l,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:22:06 2015 UTC,Cool! I thought it might be something along those lines.  Can I ask.... does it always have to be 5 seconds? The wait is a little bit annoying for impatient webgame players. It'd be more fun if the wait was as short as possible. I guess you may just iterate probabilities for an arbitrary time (i.e. 5 seconds)?
WebGames,3dkdm8,HanSoLoMein,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, I used to have it run for 5 seconds because the processing was slower, but I've made a bunch of optimizations lately, so maybe I'll knock it down to 3. Or would that still be too long?"
WebGames,3dkdm8,num1polak,3,Fri Jul 17 14:47:02 2015 UTC,Why not run the calculation while the player is moving? I often spent 5-10 seconds making my move only to then have to wait another 5s for the AI to move. It's not like my board state changes while I'm shooting for the AI ships.
WebGames,3dkdm8,Nloveladyallen,2,Fri Jul 17 15:09:39 2015 UTC,"Good idea, thanks! Might be a bit tricky with all of the asynchronous javascript going on, but I'll give it a try.  Edit: Done!

WebGames,3dkdm8,Irish_Rainman,2,Fri Jul 17 16:02:38 2015 UTC,"Play much better now :) I still lose every game, but now I lose faster :)"
WebGames,3dkdm8,cheeze_whiz_shampoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:23:34 2015 UTC,That's a really nice optimisation.  Basically as fast as possible would be great! It'd also mean you could remove the first 10 turns on manual because that's quite predictable to avoid on repeat plays.
WebGames,3dkdm8,romulusnr,2,Fri Jul 17 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"I agree. Unfortunately, removing the first 10 moves wouldn't do much - since the probabilities are always the same (until you get a hit), the first 10 moves will always be the same as well.  The only way to avoid that would be to make the AI play more randomly, but that's against the point of the exercise..."

WebGames,3dkdm8,romulusnr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:45:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Not sure exactly how I'd implement that, but it's a good idea."
WebGames,3dkdm8,romulusnr,2,Fri Jul 17 21:52:02 2015 UTC,"First off, Great game! Provides a great challenge, and it's a cunning AI, far more enjoyable than other web Battleship games.  I did take note of how it started to play after a few matches. Is the method of starting in the center and working its way to the corners intentional, or no?  Because it's a solid strategy, until you use the AI's methods against it...  http://imgur.com/hT0kESA  On the left, the line in the middle was it's first set of moves, and the lower right line was its second. So I used the general idea a couple times, granted this photo is the one were I didn't get absolutely smashed! And it worked out to my advantage!  So again, my main question is, was it programmed to do that, or is this just what it has finally determined was the most efficient way to win, after being played hundreds of times?  Again great work! And thanks for posting it for the lot of us here! :)"
WebGames,3dkdm8,AllSeeingGoggles,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words!  This is definitely not an AI that has determined the best way to play through any kind of evolutionary algorithm or anything. It came about because as I was playing the game myself online one day, I got to thinking about how the best square is probably just the one that could fit the highest number of ships, and how that seemed like something a computer could easily calculate.  That turned into a surprisingly deep programming exercise - in short, the AI checks every possible layout of ships given the current board state, counts how many times each square had a ship on it for all those layouts, and plays the square with the highest number.  Someone already tried to measure how effective this approach is (here), although I think some of the math on that page might be a bit off.  One of the problems with this approach is that it assumes that the player's ships were placed randomly, which generally won't be the case (unless the player just accepted the random ship placements presented to them). I'm actually working right now on skewing the AI's choices based on all the previous games people have played.  I've gone into way more detail about all of this on the methodology page if you're looking to nerd out even further!"

You should play the demo, but if you're thinking about buying the game, don't waste time on the demo - just buy the game.  It's cheap with a bunch of enduring qualities: a solid soundtrack, weird grotesque visual theming, black humor, and absurd replayability.  Then buy Wrath of the Lamb and Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.

You sorta have to figure out bit by bit what's going on. There are 5 endings plus a sixth hidden ending, and it's best to do all six of them.

WebGames,3d70ws,lifeoftheta,0,Wed Jul 15 07:15:38 2015 UTC,"Aaggh, I had a whole thing written here and I accidentally closed the window, let's try that again...  (preface: here's a link to the notes in case you closed the game window and don't want to play through the game again for an internet argument: http://correlatedcontents.com/misc/UWWFN/UncleNotes.html )  First, they never said ""gamers are dead"". ""Dead"" isn't used in the ""On Gamers Being Over"" section- nor is it used in any of the linked articles. Ever. The message, instead, is ""'gamers' are over.""   Note the quotes there- ""gamers"" are over. The concept of ""gamers"" is over. The concept that was, by and large, built by marketing dollars- the ""gamer"", the hyper-competitive teenage boy who really loves things that seem ""edgy"" (but, of course, never really push the boundaries of anything besides good taste). The one who gets new games on the day they come out, and rubs that fact in their friends' face. The point of the game, and the linked articles, is that (largely due to the rise of indie games, where big studios with bigger budgets can be displaced by tiny teams with one great idea) the idea of a ""gamer"" is decreasingly relevant.  I read books. I don't consider myself a ""booker"". I watch movies occasionally. I'm not a ""movier"". And I play lots of games- probably more than is healthy. I'm currently burning my skin on my laptop's keyboard because there's a Borderlands 2 window open in the background as I type this, and I just finished a scrim for my competitive Team Fortress 2 team... but I don't consider myself a ""gamer"".  ""'Gamers' are over"" isn't, really, a condemnation of people who play games, nor the games themselves. It's tearing down the artificial walls that keep people from discovering games in the first place. That's not ""dead""- that's freedom.  Ed: fixed formatting"

What you're saying is that nobody is allowed to be an enthusiast and that other people can't identify with what they love.  You're not a gamer... but what gives you the right to say that I'm not a gamer?  Why is gamer a bad thing?  I'm a gamer.  It's what I do.  It's what I've always done.  It's what my friends do.

It's not ""being a 'gamer' is the worst thing ever"". It's ""not being a 'gamer' doesn't preclude you from playing, and enjoying, the medium of games."".  The original ""'gamers' are over"" article was posted on GamaSutra- a site that's targeted at game developers, at industry folks. The full title of the article was, actually:   'Gamers' don't have to be your audience. 'Gamers' are over.   The point is two-fold:   Game developers, stop pigeonholing yourself, and the medium, by just targetting the stereotype of a ""gamer"". You don't need to do things like put enormous, jiggling boobs on all the women in your game, out of some desire to appeal to adolescent male ""gamers"". Games are bigger than that. You're bigger than that. If you ever want games to actually be considered art- games must be open to all audiences, not one tiny corner. People who play games, don't feel like you have to call yourself a ""gamer"", or act like one, just to fit in. Games are for everybody.   I don't want to take your games away. I want to let everybody play."

WebGames,3d70ws,chazwhiz,5,Tue Jul 14 04:10:10 2015 UTC,"Regarding your first two questions:  The original Christina who survived after everyone else died may not have known the truth about TEMPEST whether it be because she never heard about the controls from Lionel or because she hadn't traveled back in time yet.

At some point, one of the cockatiels that got taught the ""Christina Lives"" phrase enters its own consciousness before it gets sent to the company. When it does get sent to the company, it still knows the phrase, and says it to the company workers. That cockatiel teaches all the other cockatiels. They then get sent throught the Tempest. One of them re-enters their own consciousness, before they get sent there, and remembers ""Christina Lives"". The cycle continues."

Basically you can't have people touch either the water or the fire, both spread to adjacent spaces every turn, and they don't spread to each other, the goal is to only have one person die.  An exclusion to this is the last 4 levels unlocked after beating the rest of them, where you can't let anyone die."

WebGames,3d42ue,lifeoftheta,2,Mon Jul 13 17:18:36 2015 UTC,"Good question, to be honest when we first embarked on developing totm we weren't familiar with Google fued. It came to our attention quite early on though and we decided this game was different in some subtle but key ways.   Our main goal (which I think is shared by Google feud) is for people to have a good time and hopefully a few laughs. Our secondary goal is for the game to be as informative as possible and we feel that the way totm plays is more conducive to this - players have the freedom to make the game whatever they like (in Classic mode), players can also select what area they'd like to learn about by selecting their region. When we first came up with the concept we were amazed by how much we diverged from playing the game to searching for popular searches in a separate tab, so we've tried to make the site as dynamic add possible making it easy for players to find out more about some of the results should they want to. Finally, information about trending topics is available on site and is another feature we've implemented to make the experience as informative as possible. I'll end by saying that I suck at the game... But I do enjoy playing and I hope the rest of you get something from it! Even if you don't, thanks for stopping by."

WebGames,3cwvlv,tomster10010,5,Sat Jul 11 20:12:31 2015 UTC,I think you're supposed to build multiple connected elevators rather than making each shaft go all the way up the building.
WebGames,3cwvlv,sprawlingmegalopolis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:23:48 2015 UTC,Connected elevators?
WebGames,3cwvlv,delive5,5,Sun Jul 12 02:02:30 2015 UTC,Like this:  (only each shaft is 10-20 floors long instead of 3)    []   [] [][] [] [][]    [] [][] [] []
WebGames,3cwvlv,sprawlingmegalopolis,3,Sun Jul 12 02:15:38 2015 UTC,"Counter-intuitively, a staff elevator is actually very beneficial.  So 5 capacious + 1 staff > 6 capacious. You might think that a capacious elevator beats it but having staff queue up on the smaller staff-only elevator frees up the other elevators for guests.  Your staff will have much longer queues at the elevator but they don't rate your hotel so that's ok.  Your service will slow a bit because the staff can't get around as well but you can just brute force that with more staff."
WebGames,3cwvlv,komodo,2,Sun Jul 12 06:07:03 2015 UTC,Could you explain how this would be better than building an elevator shaft straight up? Don't quite get how this would help yet
WebGames,3cwvlv,ifiasco,2,Sun Jul 12 21:27:03 2015 UTC,"Imagine one guy is on floor 100 wanting to go down to floor 1 and another guy is on floor 50 wanting to up to floor 51.  The elevator starts on floor 100 and picks up the first guy first.  Now the second guy has to wait for the elevator to go all the way down and come back up.  The first guy is locking up the entire shaft for anyone wanting to go up.  If you break up the elevators then the second guy can go up one floor at the same time the first guy is coming down.  The transfer causes the first guy's trip to take a little longer, but the second guy's trip gets sped up drastically.  I think the reason you don't see elevators set up this way in the real world is that  humans would find transferring between elevators to be too confusing.  But the sprites in the game seem to be able to pathfind through multiple transfers without an issue."

This is a very old outdated plugin that has security flaws, and performance issues, that lots of things still currently rely on. Such things include Unity, Flash, Java, and more. If you go to about:flags, you can enable NPAPI manually, but Google plans to remove NPAPI from Chrome entirely in the near future, in hopes of abandoning outdated crapware (the N in NPAPI stands for Netscape, that should give you an idea of how old it is). Chrome currently has PPAPI, an NPAPI replacement, and there exists Pepper Flash, a version of Flash that uses PPAPI instead of NPAPI, but Unity and Java still require updates. Mozilla plans to remove NPAPI from Firefox eventually too, but not before Google does, and they don't plan to disable it in advance, unlike Google.  Due to these changes, Kongregate makes that alert pop up for Unity games, because for the simple consumer level user, it's easier to just say ""Go use Firefox."" than it is to explain how to re-enable NPAPI via about:flags."

WebGames,3c7wzi,Chocobo_Sage,2,Sun Jul 5 21:08:56 2015 UTC,"Ooh, this is a good one! Thanks!  It feels as if the collision check does not match with the visuals. I can see my squares flicker, meaning I turned them off, but then still get a message that I have lost. (EDIT: this occurs when I deactivate the square just before I expect the circle to hit it. it will briefly show as black, and then turn back to the active (teal?) color again and the game reports a loss.)  I wonder if it is a good idea to have the clock stop when enough squares are active. I think this will turn the game into a long grind once people's skills improve. I would prefer if the game always lasts 60 seconds. However, that may too strongly encourage people to play riskily, since they have to get the most out of this time, so they cannot cut any corners. This means the player loses very often, leading to frustration. Consequently, my final solution is In The Zone Mode: the game lasts 60 seconds, and every time you meet a losing condition, the game simply resets your score to 0. To calculate your score, the game keeps track of your points income at every time step, and every 60-second period (or less, if you lost in the last 60 seconds) counts as a score. Whenever your most recent 60-second period amounts to a new personal high score, the player is in the Highscore Zone! This should probably flash somewhere to alert the player the stakes have been raised. :D What do you think??"
WebGames,3c7wzi,Chocobo_Sage,2,Wed Jul 8 20:58:02 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for playing and for taking the time to write your feedback.   I also noticed the problem with the collision and it is on my to-do list with many other things. Hopefully I will soon find the time to fix everything.   Your idea sounds great. I'll consider it when updating the game.  Currently your score counts even if you don't survive until the timer runs out and gets added to the highscore list if it's high enough. The first iteration of the game didn't had the time stopping mechanic and I felt that players would probably soon reach a score cap. Stopping the time didn't solves that issue but kinda widens the score field. I'm currently collecting all the feedback and thinking about how to expand the game. I think the best way would be to implement two to three different modes to keep replayability high and motivate different types of players.   So thanks again for your kind words and patience. :)

Released in 1992 for Japanese audiences, the game was later translated and released in North America in 1993 by Enix America Corp. Combining traditional platforming mechanics with experience and leveling mechanics originating from role playing games, E.V.O. involves the player navigating a creature through a number of side-scrolling levels while undergoing bodily evolution to cope with ever-changing environments. The game is heavily based on Almanic's original title 46 Okunen Monogatari: The Shinka Ron released exclusively in Japan in 1990 for the PC-9801 home computer.

In a previous version you lost control if your character went outside the orbital and you crashed back to the planet surface without having the chance to do something. Because that was very frustrating while playing we decided to remove this input block.  Edit: We have uploaded a new version of Orbis to fix that exploit. You may continue flying next to the end of the orbital but you won't get points any longer.

It won't let me double my trimps beyond the 131K instance. Claims I need to ""expand my territory"" and I don't know what that means. I have over 400 Resorts and I can't get any more as my food/wood/metal/gems rates are too slow to be practical. And all my battles are just my trimps getting trounced because they can out-damage the enemy. I've also eaten up all my battle upgrades, because of course they require food/wood/metal/gems as well. Not sure where to go from here. Anyone know the specific points when you can double your battle trimps?"
WebGames,3c4sa8,PM_UR_PROBLEM,3,Tue Jul 7 03:26:02 2015 UTC,"I've hit ""expand my territory"" as well. From what I've seen it seems to mean you don't have enough available trimps to double your fighting trimps. You have 455k total. That gets halved due to 227k being employable (it doesn't appear to matter if they actually are employed or not) so you only have 227k for fighting and breeding. You already got 131k fighting. If you were to use coordination and double that 131k it would be 262k which exceeds what the game allots you as non-employed trimps. And so it pops up with saying you must expand your territory to make more room to have enough total trimps to double your fighting force. Since you haven't maxed out your employable trimps I'd say that's the only choice you have right now and hopefully the block you've hit will smooth itself out."
WebGames,3c4sa8,WorldsSmartestGeraff,2,Tue Jul 7 15:09:21 2015 UTC,The dev has said that the game will become unbalanced and impossible at some point - depending on how well you played you can get more or less far but I started to have this issue around world 45 as well; You can try to recycle maps and try to get an easier one that you can continue to run until you get better gear upgrades to let you be competitive in the main world

If trimps were available, I apparently could double my attack force 22 times over.  This is with the game only running 24 hours or so. 30 hours tops, so it needs more later-game buildings and jobs and such. I've got some maps I can play and maybe get one more level out of some weapons or armor, but it sounds like world 45 or so is close to an unpassable wall."

WebGames,3c4sa8,SoberIRL,2,Mon Jul 6 10:06:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I made that comment after about an hour or so of play. I'm starting to see how trapping could accelerate the pace, but not by that much.  Why hold off on coordination? If anything, doubling the block bonus is worth the increased breeding time, right?"
WebGames,3c4sa8,42x42,2,Mon Jul 6 10:14:44 2015 UTC,"It's just a guess, but if you only have a 2.5k population, sending 1k soldiers cripples your breeding rate, while sending 512 is more doable.

It will open a text file. 4) Past this:  q::     Click 100 ; Return  Into said text file.  5) Save 6) Find the icon in the notification area of the taskbar (i.e., the bottom right corner) that has a white 'H' on a green background. Right click this and then click 'Reload script'.  VIOLA! Now each time you press 'ctrl+q' it triggers 100 clicks. Edit the script for more or less.

WebGames,3c4sa8,sprokket,2,Mon Jul 6 01:10:41 2015 UTC,"Blocking basically gives you immunity to a certain amount of the other party's damage points. It isn't the most solid of investments but it can give you a little edge. Efficiency makes you work faster. So for example, if you have a lot of items to build in your queue, it makes you work faster if you choose to work with the Trimps. Same for if you want to make your wood/food/mine go quicker. Not a huge boost but it's helpful for trapping Trimps and building in particular from what I have noticed."
WebGames,3c4sa8,FHL88Work,2,Mon Jul 6 01:28:07 2015 UTC,"Blocking subtracts that amount from the base damage of the monsters (it becomes worthless in the long run I think). Efficiency makes whatever you click on to work on (like building, trapping or science) go twice as fast but not your trimps."

Now to clarify, I have played text adventure games, and I have played visual novels even, but this is neither. Even in those games, your selections in the dialog have some form of influence on something. This ""game"" completely lacks that. It's just a tiring click-fest that does nothing.

WebGames,3bx6f5,lifeoftheta,0,Sat Jul 4 02:42:53 2015 UTC,"Long, boring, not fun at all. I've played through it multiple times, the first time trying to go through the game. Lost the shuttle and Dunmer, but got no one to panic. Very rarely does it give me multiple choices. On top of that, both choices seem to be the same answer worded differently. The main characters seem to be very bland with random backstories being thrown in when trying to keep them from panicking, but they never go anywhere beyond that one conversation. Terrible art. Boring plot. And of course, lots of technobabble.  Mid game I started talking to Dunmer about why he was so happy we were being invaded by aliens, and did nothing to change his mind, but not a second later he started getting a panic attack, and when I talked to him he started complaining that it's all his fault.  Just for fun, I've tried playing again, but ignoring what anyone is saying, but when presented with a multi choice question, I'd read them all and choose what seemed to be the best one. The result: I ULTIMATELY DID BETTER THAN MY FIRST RUN. DUNMER SURVIVED (though I lost the shuttle again). Why is this such a big problem? THE DIALOG WAS UNNECESSARY. From what I can tell, you basically play space-therapist to these people. If that's true (and I have my doubts) then the text should be used to get to know these people and help them! In a game like Why Am I Dead?, you go around talking to people, AND THAT IS NECESSARY TO FIGURE OUT THE KILLER. Along with that, they're all varied and (somewhat)interesting characters, so you kind of want to talk to them. Here, they all talk like robots. That's bad enough, but when they all talk like the same robot? IT DOESN'T WORK.  Now, at the end of that game, they fixed the engine, so I used the fast forward button that was built into the game and when I was done fast forwarding EVERYONE WAS PANICKING. AND I COULDN'T STOP IT. Why would they make something like this, and the only way to prevent it is to not skip past the long, speechless parts? It's stupid.  AND WHEN I GOT BACK FROM TYPING ALL THAT THEY WERE ALL DEAD, despite the fact it TOLD ME they were all alive! The 'Ends of this History' screen still has that ending completed, why did they die? (the fact that they knew this certain part of the game was boring and gave me the option to skip alone is kind of a failure)  So I tried again, but only chose the worst answers to try and kill them all. Result: THE SAME ENDING AS WHEN I TRIED TO PLAY NORMALLY! As in, I CAN'T KILL THESE IDIOTS IF I TRIED! I CAN'T LOSE THIS GAME.  (side note: I'd like to point out that I'm an AI on a space ship with a crew member named Bill. Missed opportunity for 2001: Space Odyssy)  Right, but let's say I remove all logic a player above 2 years old would have, and used that one moment in the middle of the game where I'm trying to fire the laser (the only point in the game where I have input, by the way) and trap myself in an infinite loop of doing the same tactic and keeping the ship there, so eventually they'll have to go insane. Let's see what happens.  Right, before I even finish that session, I should note here that the AI is HORRIBLE in this game. I've seen instances of a person in a panic attack putting out fires instead of causing them, one of them taking a bite to eat while the ship is in ruins around him, and another panicked person politely standing there, waiting for him to move.  RIGHT, I've been trying this for over half an hour, and I'm pretty sure I need to meet actual criteria to kill them, rather than just driving them insane over and over. Gonna see if there's a point I can kill off at least ONE other person (I offed Dunmer at the lasers again)  SAME ENDING AGAIN. I CAN'T KILL OFF THE MAIN CHARACTERS WHEN I TRY. THE ONLY CHALLENGE TO THIS GAME IS BEARING THROUGH THE HALF HOUR ADVENTURE OF INCORRECT GRAMMAR, AWFUL PLOT, TECHNOBABBLE, AND ART THAT MADE ME SICK.  It's not like a game where you have no input to the events that happen can't work. I quite enjoyed Moonkid. But in THAT game you weren't SUPPOSED to have control, just watch how the citizens react to an inevitable event. It was basically a movie. The main difference was MOONKID DID THINGS WHILE YOU WERE WATCHING. In THIS game you get to see some butt-ugly astronauts cause fires in a panic then repair them again.  Heck, a game with multiple endings depending on who you save could make a great game, IF YOU GOT INPUT OVER WHO YOU SAVE. Like my notes on my fourth play through, I CAN'T KILL THEM.  I know /u/The-Demiurge wasn't the one who created this horrible game, but that doesn't change the fact that this is awful. Space Incident, I dub thee the worst web game I've ever played. For anyone still curious about this game, DON'T PLAY. I'VE PLAYED THIS FOR FREE AND I STILL DEMAND A REFUND."

WebGames,3bi7we,mgoyoda,36,Mon Jun 29 12:58:04 2015 UTC,I do not understand why this game is so popular
WebGames,3bi7we,Raven_Darkmore,83,Mon Jun 29 17:37:12 2015 UTC,"It is comedy of the obvious.  The game is called 'You Have To Burn The Rope'.  Along the way the game tells you what's going to happen.  This serves two purposes.    There is a notorious running problem with games holding your hand too long and tutorials going on forever.  In this situation, the title of the game acts as the tutorial. The instructions on your way to the chamber reinforce this one, stupidly simple idea. Gamers don't expect it to be that simple.  If the game was called You Have To Burn The Rope - you might expect that you first have to find the rope and find a way to get fire. Or the rope is miles away. Or you keep getting to the rope, but finding out it is the wrong one and your correct rope is in another castle.  Games aren't supposed to be as simple as dumb as they tell us right from the moment we read the title.  The fact that the game is precisely what it tells you and then reinforces that with no other commentary makes it the surprise.   In the end though, the killer of it is the song.  Why?  Because the song is longer than the game. It over discusses everything you did in the game, and then continues to inform you about your other options.  The game looks like a flash game from the early 2000s - the song is produced and at a high enough bitrate as to be crisp and clear and not just idle credits music.    Why is this game popular?  Because it is funny. It isn't a game so much as it is a joke about games. It is the comedy equivalent of the screaming maze game.. except it is done for laughs.  Nobody expects you to NOT be able to win. Nobody thinks you AREN'T going to get through it. You are expected to go through it and hopefully find the humor in how simple it was and how simple they TOLD you it was.  Then hopefully get another giggle at how pompous the song is when put at the end of a really silly simple thing.  TL;DR - It isn't popular because it is a game as much as it is popular because it is (subjectively) a funny joke about games."
WebGames,3bi7we,ReverendVoice,11,Mon Jun 29 20:15:50 2015 UTC,And it's a darn good song.
WebGames,3bi7we,FunnyMan3595,7,Mon Jun 29 21:20:33 2015 UTC,"Gamers don't expect it to be that simple.

Games aren't supposed to be as simple as dumb as they tell us right from the moment we read the title. The fact that the game is precisely what it tells you and then reinforces that with no other commentary makes it the surprise.   We're also conditioned to try everything except what the game wants us to.  Game designers love to hide secrets and loot in places you're not supposed to go and Easter eggs triggered by doing things you shouldn't, like using a lockpick on your nose.  So if a game tells us exactly what we're supposed to do, we'll hunt around for anything ELSE we can do first.  This game subverts that by being exactly what it says on the tin: You have to burn the rope.  That's it.  You have an attack (which is a bit tricky to find), but it does nothing.  You have to burn the rope!  The same contrarian impulse is why The Stanley Parable works so well.  The game tells you exactly what to do, then rewards you for exploring all the OTHER things you could do instead."

It's that sort of breaking the player breaking the game that made it one of my favorite indie games of the last few years.   And, aside from game gushing, your point is spot on.

WebGames,3bi7we,ReverendVoice,10,Tue Jun 30 00:57:11 2015 UTC,"It's an explanation of the obvious.  The comment called to question the popularity of the game 'You Have To Burn The Rope.' In simple terms, the response was explanatory in a fairly verbose way.    The writer of the comment went at an extensive length to describe some of the reasons, perhaps beyond the analysis of many others, why the game itself has a slight, but nonetheless real, cult fanbase.  He described using bullet points to make clear his two primary focal points, and then followed up with a point that didn't follow his list format, and then a final summation of the whole concept. He used other genres for comparison, and then one last point before his TL:DR.    It found traction quite probably due to the fact that for a simple question, the writer went out of his way to not give a simple one line sentence or even a pithy insult to the questioners intelligent, but a thought out response as to what, for such a simple game, makes it unique and (subjectively) special.

WebGames,3bkln7,GaryV83,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:31:31 2015 UTC,"There are some vague instructions below the game.   In the lower right corner show your stats. ""Daily P&L"" is your score for the current round.   You increase your score by sending trades from green circles (aka ""nodes"") to green circles. Sending trades from/to red circles will decrease your score. You control where trades are sent by setting an instruction shape on a circle.   The more circles you are sending trades to, the slower trades will send:   No icon puts the circle on standby The dot sends trades to every circle (slowest) The dash sends trades to every second circle The triangle sends trades to every third circle (medium) Square... Pentagon...(fastest)   The blue outline meters on each circle show a surplus of trades at that node.  Something bad seems to happen if the blue outline fills up.  Also, circles seem to take turns flashing, which might mean something, perhaps for the trade frequency.  Meanwhile, there's a bunch of chat boxes and news tickers around which might tell some sort of story.    It has an interesting mechanic. I'd like to play a similar but simpler interfaced game. There's just too much going on to really enjoy it."
WebGames,3bkln7,racc813,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:43:46 2015 UTC,What I can't seem to figure out is that fact that what are we supposed to do? Only make green nodes trade with each other? What do we do about the nodes that are not green? Is the gold to keep all the nodes green for the longest?  The tutorial was as vague as it could be. It could have atleast shown some real game strategy rather than just making statements...
WebGames,3bkln7,Svayam_Bhagavan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:13:05 2015 UTC,"I think you get the most points from trades going from green to green. You can see how much you get from the green number that pops up around the node when a trade leaves or enters a node. If a trade leaves or enters a red node, you lose points.   I didn't persevere long enough to figure out what yellow, blue or purple mean."

WebGames,3bb2au,Svayam_Bhagavan,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"should atleast be able to complete one lap before blowing up   At the risk of stating the obvious, try crashing less. This will probably require going MUCH slower.  After 2 or 3 attempts where I went really fast and died quickly, I tried slowing down massively and made it the full 3 laps."
WebGames,3bb2au,adrianmonk,4,Sat Jun 27 17:06:16 2015 UTC,"If I fall off the track, I have to use the mouse to click through the menu. Why can't I just press one of the buttons? Then it makes me go back to the main menu instead of just restarting the race. And when it does this, it resets the quality back to high. And the 3 second countdown to begin the race could go a lot faster. It looks like it might be fun if things get ironed out."

WebGames,3bb2au,FFBoyz,2,Tue Jun 30 04:28:37 2015 UTC,"My biggest complaint with this game is that it does not save changes to the settings between plays. Also I think the crashes could use a little tuning. When hitting the wall at a very shallow angle, it seems like the vehicle jumps back/recoils rather than being deflected. It looks like there is no change in the way the vehicle is facing when it hits the side. Lastly, I think the damage calculation is off; it should be less damaging for hitting at a shallower angle and harsher when hitting the wall more directly (though I really like that running off the track is possible).   I do really enjoy this game, it is extremely fun to play. Having a racer moving so fast along the narrow track requires a fair bit of skill, which I also like. The booster placements make the gameplay interesting as well, because you can easily trip up using them, but you just want to go faster. I managed to finish once (and stopped after because there is no lvl2) with a 3:16 time."

WebGames,3bcyr0,Huperprogeny,7,Sun Jun 28 18:34:36 2015 UTC,"Desktop.  I think I took it as an unintentional commentary on violence in fiction, like that study with kids beating up a clown. The guy's horrified face and choking noises combined with the text saying it's perfectly fine because it's not real and its almost hypnotizing demands for me to choke it's what did it for me. I actually thought that's what you were going for at first. I still enjoyed it, even though it was for different reasons than you intended."
WebGames,3bcyr0,JonFawkes,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:06:39 2015 UTC,I think desktop is a little more horrifying than mobile due to the swaying choke hand cursor.  The instructions used to have more lines intended to make the player consider at what point it becomes immoral to torture an artificial intelligence. I cut out most of it because the writing was sort of crap and made it seem less believable as a serious effort at a stress-relief system. I guess the superfluous pain meter is pretty heavy-handed.  Thanks for playing!
WebGames,3bcyr0,Pakaran,2,Sun Jun 28 22:01:25 2015 UTC,"I think it was more the concept itself, I too thought it was quite horrifying, but I may not be one of those people who gets stress relief from physical violence. I don't know where you're getting the idea that ""science has shown physical violence to be the key to releasing stress"" but that can't possibly apply to everyone.  The graphics lie in the uncanny valley, and beyond that virtual simulated violence for the sake of violence isn't really the same as actual violence.  By that I mean, take for example killing someone in GTA. The goal of GTA isn't necessarily to kill someone, so you feel more free to kill someone, compared to this game where your only goal and option is to kill someone, and suddenly you don't really want to do it."
WebGames,3bcyr0,Pakaran,4,Sun Jun 28 19:07:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your well-reasoned feedback. I thought that maybe the desktop version was a little buggy.  There are a number of studies which indicate violent video games can reduce stress, for instance: http://www.tamiu.edu/newsinfo/7-08-10/article5.shtml But, as you said, perhaps it's not for everyone.  Just to be clear, there is no way to kill the avatar in this game. The intent is to merely choke it, not kill it."
WebGames,3bcyr0,Pakaran,3,Sun Jun 28 19:20:47 2015 UTC,"This does not reduce stress. It's way too ""realistic"" and the text makes it rather horrifying. We as the players have full control of when to choke and when not to, and on top of that the encouraging text makes it feel somewhat like the Milgram experiment. Violent games only reduce stress if you can kill people and cause damage and laugh it off. Realistic violent games, where the act of killing has a more serious tone, don't really reduce stress. I don't think anyone feels less stressed playing The Last of Us, for example.  Silly violence reduces stress. Care free. This game was anything but that. This game felt like an intense moral dilemma and was quite horrifying. I had strongly conflicting thoughts, especially with the text along the lines of ""Imagine all the problems in your day were caused by this prick! Choke!"" It felt so wrong to choke him. He didn't actually do anything to me! I felt like I was being manipulated into choking him.   That's an accomplishment by itself, but not quite what you were going for. Hope I could shed some light into why people reacted the way they did."

WebGames,3b1wre,Googunk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:11:20 2015 UTC,"positives: now features online saves, build and customize your team as you see fit, NPC team-members level.  negatives: copied prior maps, eliminated story mode, eliminated in-game voiced segments, lag like you've never seen, and only skin-deep changes in game mechanics.  I would say that this is not  anew installment, merely a level pack, except that the maps and content aren't new so I can't even give them that."

WebGames,3apbnd,NicolaF_,11,Mon Jun 22 12:10:25 2015 UTC,"So, today is my third day playing the game so allow me to give a fair review.  Many players are critical about the mechanics of the game, being able to sail for only 100 minutes a day and how ""slow"" the game progresses. The 100 minutes of sail time a day is quite ingenious in my opinion, it gives every player the same amount of time to strategize which quests and courses they will take to maximize the amount of gold/exp they can gain in a day. Plus it prevents ""no-lifers"" from playing lets say 12+ hours a day to get really far ahead and eventually get burnt out from over playing. The ship moves slow because every action is measured in real time.  One you set your course your ship will automatically move to the location; and will automatically fight enemy NPC units along the way. Quests are also automated, when you click a quest area your ship will sail there and spend time doing the quest.  This game is a pirate-themed MMO idle game. You're not meant to spend hours upon hours staring at the screen to ""be the best"". It's designed so you can set your course and browse reddit, or go to work, or anything else you do while your ship progresses through the game.  I've been chatting a lot with the main developer and he's really ambitious and open to ideas. He's made it clear than cash-purchases will not give players any real advantage over each other.  Every day at 12:00 AM UST the timer resets, any unused time will be saved up and be can redeemed through the Distillery tab. (Using this feature uses up some Rum*) When you run out of sail time you wont be able to move your ship, but you'll still be able to use the ""Patrol"" feature which will allow you to farm gold while offline/afk.  Some cool features of the game include open-world PvP; a reputation and faction system; The ability to conquer and name islands you discover; a RPG style leveling up system and distributive stat points to build your captain as you please; multiple ships to purchase with a variety of crew members and cannons to equip; and a lot more that I'm forgetting to mention.. And the best part is this is only the tip of the iceberg, the developers aren't greedy as the server costs are really cheap, and they have some very ambitious ideas too (Not to mention how open they are to suggestions.)  The developers are native french speakers so there are some language issues right now, but if you report them they are usually fixed promptly.   If anyone has comments or questions about the game let me know and I'd be glad to answer to the best of my abilities.  The guild system is pretty interesting too. The leader is allowed to set up a gold/EXP tax on it's members, leaching a little of their gains which go into the guild. The EXP leached it use to level up the guild and the gold goes into a treasury. Be careful about being a guild leader though because your members can mutiny and take over your guild or even plot against you.  Cheers. - Captain Cleaver (Cleaver is my IGN.) https://s0.reignofpirates.com/en?r=3811 (Shameless referral link.)"

WebGames,3apbnd,repler,3,Mon Jun 22 21:25:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback ! I'm glad you love the graphics and sounds :)  The game is intended to be played at work, or while doing something else. Keep the game in a tab, come back when it's blinking.  You're not supposed to watch every battle, the actual important data is how much life did you lose, so you can adjust your build / equipment against that monster's build. Or simply learn that you're weak against that build, and therefore you should avoid fighting players with the same build.  I'm really interested in why you stopped playing after 3 quests though !"
WebGames,3apbnd,Athalis,2,Mon Jun 22 23:12:12 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, I did not realize I was playing it ""wrong""!  I was actually sitting there and waiting for my boat to move around on the screen, and I clicked to watch the battles, etc.  Yeah I stopped when it started bugging me to register, and then the register box would pop up literally after every click. I wanted to keep playing and decide later if I wanted to register, but I couldn't keep playing so I closed it.  Thank you for the reply!!! That's awesome.

WebGames,3apbnd,graphictruth,5,Mon Jun 22 13:42:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe the music could change to indicate that you're in a battle? At first, I had no idea what was going on at first when I did the ""Kill 10 pirates quest"" Also, maybe the ""killed a pirate"" sound effect could be a cannon going off or something that grabs more attention. It might also be helpful to have a ""quest completed"" sound effect. I can see myself playing this while working on something, so it would be nice to have some audio indicating when I need to check the browser window again.   So far, I think it's pretty cool!"

Now I have been sailing around the key whirlpool for about 10 minutes. Should I keep looking for it, spending my sailing time? Or is this a bug that will not let me complete it when I am on a different level?"
WebGames,3apbnd,cr1swell,2,Wed Jun 24 01:18:24 2015 UTC,"It's not a bug !  You've got to keep killing monster until you find the key, it can take a bit of time (usually about 4min, but you can be unlucky). You should see the list of fights happening at the bottom of your screen.  The level of a quest is simply an indication of the level of the enemies you'll have to fight to achieve it. If it's a level X quest, you should probably be level X or X-1 yourself to do it.  You don't have to look at your ship while it is doing that, you can switch tab. The  tab's title will blink when the actions will be finished.  If you've got more question, I'd be glad to answer them :)"

WebGames,3apbnd,Athalis,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:48:28 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan. It takes forever to get anywhere and you don't have any input with combat. The game pretty much just plays itself except I need to be present so quests are completed. I got bored with it just sailing to fighting the pirates in the opening quests. I called it quits once the game started asking me to create an account every six seconds. I'd suggest super-charging the boat speed unless better boats get faster as you progress through the game. I'd also flat out remove the 100 minute limit on how long you can use your boat since the travel time will take up most of this (I need 63 minutes just for the travel time it take me to get to the areas in the quests you get from the second island).
WebGames,3apbnd,Gemspark,2,Wed Jun 24 06:08:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think, it isn't clear the game needs to be played at work, or while doing something else. You're supposed to let it run in a tab, and come back when it blinks to see the result of your action.  The skill will be about theory craft (choosing where to put your stat points, what stuff to buy, which quest to take, etc.) Its not really about doing, but about choosing.  The time limit is there so you don't have pressure to play more. It's supposed to be played at work, not instead of work. I guess we really need to make this more clear.  Anyway, thanks for your time and feedbacks !"

WebGames,3aoaqd,_Gondamar_,4,Mon Jun 22 08:19:21 2015 UTC,"I wish I would have thought of that... I went through a few different designs for the boost like having a designated jump and boost button. The boost button would launch you in the direction opposite of the direction you held to move but that felt like garbage. I think the double tap would definitely have simplified the controls and make it feel more fluid, it's a shame you didn't tell me that before I released it."

WebGames,3amk0o,sciolizer,8,Sun Jun 21 18:19:37 2015 UTC,It is too hard to pay attention to what's happening on the main screen and what's happening on the rhythm bar.
WebGames,3amk0o,wilsonh915,3,Mon Jun 22 03:55:29 2015 UTC,"It's hard at first, but there's only four patterns and they're easily memorized. Eventually you'll be able to play without even looking at the right hand side, since you'll learn what pattern each crate/weapon produces.  If it helps when learning, you can try paying attention to the white circle that shrinks around the main character."
WebGames,3amk0o,wilsonh915,2,Mon Jun 22 04:01:18 2015 UTC,The white circle thing was helpful
WebGames,3amk0o,thedelicatedance,2,Mon Jun 22 04:18:26 2015 UTC,"You have to ignore the rhythm bar and just use your ears and muscle memory. The problem is learning the patterns in the first place, which the game doesn't really accommodate very well."
WebGames,3amk0o,CookieBaBa,3,Mon Jun 22 03:58:53 2015 UTC,It's basically just a more musical Super Crate Box
WebGames,3amk0o,thedelicatedance,3,Sun Jun 21 21:56:16 2015 UTC,"Pretty fun, but I feel like the rhythm game should be harder and the dodging game should be easier. You should be able to stand and practice with a weapon so you get a feel for it, which tends to kill you quickly in this game. The guys with a lot of HP are too hard to kill (I wasn't even sure it was possible at first) and you should be able to shoot down enemy bullets -- a game whose unique mechanic is based around shooting should emphasize shooting more and dodging less.  It could also punish you for firing off the beat -- maybe the gun gradually overheats and explodes.  Edit: also, maybe the next weapon shouldn't appear until you get a perfect bar with your current weapon (hitting every beat). It'd take away some of the randomness of getting a bunch of crates in a row right next to each other and pace the game out more logically. It'd also teach the player the patterns effectively."
WebGames,3amk0o,TagProWreckn,3,Mon Jun 22 01:12:45 2015 UTC,Great concept.  This would make a good multiplayer game.  Suggestion: Require the player to kill three enemies before a new gun spawns.  It's hard to get into the rhythm when you keep changing weapons!

I asked him for like 30 minutes how he got that tower and he just ignored me :(  But still, the payoff when you DO roll good gems is amazing. I mean, i got to lvl 71 with this flash Gem TD simply because i rolled a Great Opal once, giving everything 50% IAS.  I do remember Burnenog TD as being amazing aswell.

WebGames,3aggkl,TheAdmiralCrunch,3,Sat Jun 20 01:42:21 2015 UTC,"Meh. Not that great. If you want tons of money early on, you can ""share"" the game and the acheivements. You just have to click the button in the game and close the opening window without actually sharing anything, and still get the ingame cash. Every achievement gives 5k and you can ""share"" the game on twitter, fb and g+ for 8k each. This way you can get a good weapon early on.  Not really worth playing through imo. Money generation is terribly balanced. I played through all missions with 3 stars, ""shared"" all my achievements for as much money as possible. I only got the second and second to last gun during my run, skipping all guns in between. At the end of the game I didn't even have enough money to get the last gun let alone upgrade it.  Also there isn't really much there. Every mission is about protecting civilians, all of them just stand around and maybe either shoot or do nothing until they are attacked by zombies. There are just 2 kinds of zombies, fast and slow. One mission started with you seeing a civilian get attacked, then automatically pan away to look after the other civilians. Only then you get control to actually help the civilian that's already under attack by the zombies. Feels like bullshit.  How about something more? Maybe a huge zombie, that needs a few shots to get down but slow. Maybe interact with the environment? Shoot down gates so that the civilians can flee through them, or explode bombs by shooting at them to kill a lot of zombies at once. It's the same through all levels."

WebGames,3a7d81,NeatG,2,Wed Jun 17 22:37:00 2015 UTC,One other option rather than filtering would be to keep track of the percentage that people get wrong per headline. You can use that to do things like establish a difficulty curve if you wanted to.

It's not so much ""Whoah, reality is as crazy as the onion sometimes"" and more ""The onion really doesn't try to mask the fact that it's satire at all.""  It would work better if you put together a long list of specially selected headlines. Of course this would limit replayability, but nobody's really going to replay this anyway. Plus it would make scores relevant, and not just a measure of how long it takes you to get bored.  Good idea though."

When I only was drawing up to the minigun and sniper rifle I was destroying, but then with the added ones after that it got harder and harder."

WebGames,39v116,fuck_prostitutes,2,Wed Jun 17 06:32:16 2015 UTC,A 1-4 player game kind of like hot potato but pass the potato with the keyboard game. There's some easy bots to play against if you can't find some others to play with. Ppppllllaaaayyyy iiiiitttttt

So much right with it - soundtrack, voice acting, character design, I could go on and on~ Be sure to check out the sequel if you enjoyed this one. It's a more traditional adventure/RPG, but it has the same stellar voicework, music etc."

WebGames,39p4fc,Theqwertytopman,2,Sun Jun 14 00:01:42 2015 UTC,"If you choose the star door, you go into a ""nerd corner"" with people playing games (and a picture of the guy who joined up with you hanging off the wall). It also has a teleporter, and it takes you bake to the first room, but naked. The game then ends.  Anyone done the male room ending? Or is there any other endings?"
WebGames,39p4fc,MyOtherAltIsAHuman,3,Sun Jun 14 09:23:29 2015 UTC,"Male ending: You choose the male door, and there's a viking on the toilet. You kill him, and when you stand where he was you get teleported to the top of the tower again. Only this time you're naked and weaponless, and there's another hero. He promptly stabs you, and jumps down the hole. Game over!"

WebGames,39q3nl,hooe,4,Sun Jun 14 01:09:53 2015 UTC,"This game is an idle game, where you can control 25 types of businesses. At first you need to start first business. Every time when you start it, your income increases. Income shows how much money you earn every second. When you will have a lot of money, you will be able to buy more businesses, upgrades and managers. Managers make your businesses run automatically. Else, this game has levelling system. There is also exchange window, where you can win or lose your money. When you will have very much money you can reset the game to get bonuses."

WebGames,39ofpu,Maragil,6,Sun Jun 14 10:27:16 2015 UTC,This game is super broken if you are going to have the people that uploaded images also within the rooms; especially the newbie rooms. There are people guessing images with 100+ points getting every image right <10s after the image comes up. It ruins the game for everyone else.
WebGames,39ofpu,Seruthei,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:00:31 2015 UTC,"I guessed several within <10s and it was assumed I uploaded the images. I just could tell what they were. I mean, I don't disagree that that's a problem, but it's not like they're impossible at first glance or anything."
WebGames,39ofpu,VeteranKamikaze,-1,Tue Jun 16 07:28:12 2015 UTC,"It might be a problem that fixes itself as more content is added. Or it might require some more fundamental changes.  Maybe going with a scoring model more like PopSauce would be good, that is, you get more points if you're first but several people get a chance to guess correctly before the image is completely revealed."
WebGames,39ofpu,romulusnr,2,Sun Jun 14 00:32:02 2015 UTC,I think your fundamental model is broken. People have already figured out what the images are from the very first pixelation.
