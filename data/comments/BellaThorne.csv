BellaThorne,327f5s,lepablo,3,Sat Apr 11 13:41:10 2015 UTC,The Thorne girls won the genetic lottery for nice legs.
BellaThorne,327f5s,RinardoEvoris,10,Sat Apr 11 18:53:31 2015 UTC,I don't get how Coachella works.  Cuz the Jenner girls get like a thousand screaming girls show up to a mall opening.  How can they for example just go hang out and watch music without people going nuts.   I assume it'd be milder with Bella but still a crowd of fans.
BellaThorne,327f5s,PedanticSimpleton,6,Sat Apr 11 13:58:18 2015 UTC,VIP sections.
BellaThorne,327f5s,reb_mccuster,9,Sat Apr 11 17:30:26 2015 UTC,VIP. If you bother celebs you get tossed out.
