bostonceltics,3e3a5g,cyberklown28,2,Tue Jul 21 22:10:00 2015 UTC,"Most likely.  I believe the team salary cap is around $1 million, so he'll probably be making close to $100,000"

I don't really follow the NBL (our league) but have been meaning to get back into it of late and now I have an excuse!  The NBL isn't comparable to leagues like you have in Europe, but the season runs October through early March, so I've seen speculation that he might play in Aus and then come back for the end of the D-League season.  He's rumoured to be going to the Sydney Kings. Former Atlanta Hawk, Josh Childress, plays for them."

bostonceltics,3e2xil,pr3167,10,Tue Jul 21 16:13:16 2015 UTC,They have Miami as the 8th seed...
bostonceltics,3e2xil,Wayne_Spooney,10,Tue Jul 21 15:47:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's unreasonable. Wade only plays 50 games, and they are pretty thin. Essentially, if Bosh goes down, they are screwed. If not, they are good. 8 seems like it is an unlikely outcome, but if you average the two likely outcomes (really good, or bad), you probably get something like an 8th seed projection."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,mcorcoran3,4,Tue Jul 21 17:46:59 2015 UTC,"""If Bosh goes down they are screwed.""  This might be true, but aren't we screwed if Smart or IT goes down? I mean, this argument could be used for any team ""if Player A goes down, they are screwed.""  Miami is an extremely talented team. Hell, Winslow and Green are backup wings -- not so bad."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,Wayne_Spooney,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"My point was simply that there is a wide variability in the Heat because they have some legit unknowns (Whiteside, Winslow) old guys with checkered injury histories (McBob, Wade, to a lesser extent Bosh), and they have a thin bench, especially up front. If all breaks right, I think they are the third or so best team in the east. If all goes wrong, then it could get really ugly really fast. Thus, the model probably split the difference and plopped them at the 8th spot."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,ScotchJohnson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:49 2015 UTC,"Are you seriously comparing Bosh and Smart? They are on different levels and have different values to their team.

bostonceltics,3e2xil,wickedkool,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:56:20 2015 UTC,Marcus Smart is like the Celtics 8th best player

Yeah, Spoe will kill their contender chances with his bad coaching, but they should at least have enough talent to be a 6 seed."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,Wayne_Spooney,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:32 2015 UTC,"I think Bosh is much more important to that team than Wade for precisely the reason you described: Winslow. Which can I noted in my comment (Bosh being important). All I'm saying is it's reasonable to call them the 8th because it's an average of the pendulum swings this team is capable of.  They might be a top 4 team, and it's certainly possible they are a bottom 6 team (Bosh goes down, Whiteside can't keep it up, Winslow isn't ready yet, Wade plays 50 games and his age starts showing). This team just has a wide range of possibilities which is why I say 8 is reasonable because it is sort of an inbetween spot."

bostonceltics,3e2xil,evantime,4,Tue Jul 21 18:24:22 2015 UTC,The Raptors and Hornets are too high. The Heat and Bucks are too low.  Most importantly though if things go down like this we will have the 5th and 13th pick.
bostonceltics,3e2xil,bartendrplease86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:34 2015 UTC,This is what I noticed also.... The Nets way down at the bottom.  When does SI publish its first mock draft?
bostonceltics,3e2xil,evantime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:54:29 2015 UTC,Draftexpress has Dragan Bender at #5 (pretty much this year's Porzingis) and Demetrius Jackson at #13. Drafting a pg and a pf would be sticking to what Ainge usually does.
bostonceltics,3e2xil,ztvile,5,Tue Jul 21 19:58:43 2015 UTC,"When I was scrolling through the East standings, I skipped down to 7th place, and on the way to the bottom I was thinking ""Jesus how low do they have us?""   Seeing us at 5th is definitely optimistic. I think that is what our best team is capable of, if things happen to go wrong for other teams.   A few other teams I thought were wrongly projected  were:  The Cavaliers, as much as I dislike saying it, are going to be dominant. Toronto is good, when healthy, but I doubt they can match the Cavs, or even the (healthy) Bulls.  Milwaukee is being underrated here. We're going to see Parker mesh with MCW, which could be magical. Throw the Greek Freak and Greg Monroe into the mix, and you've got an exciting team to watch. Will they be a playoff team? I think they could be, but 10th is a little insulting."

bostonceltics,3e2xil,pbrunner2012,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:53 2015 UTC,"Lets just wait and see how nasty the Raps are next year. Watching them at the end of last year they were outright bad. They were obviously a team that employed a ""just let em play"" strategy. They've got some decent scorers and athletes but they have no discipline or basketball IQ as a team. I think DeMare Carroll will be a mediocre at best addition, and aside from that they're weaker in the front court and have poor depth basically all around. An injury or two or a sub par season for 1 Lowry or Derozan and I think they could implode a bit and have to blow up that core that wasn't all that great even at it's peak 2 years ago."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know about a dumpster fire, but I agree this discredits the whole process. The Cav's will win 55 games or something and Toronto won't win 50."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,pbrunner2012,0,Tue Jul 21 18:25:08 2015 UTC,Dumpster fire is too strong. I'm just saying I think not only will they not win 50 I think they might not win 40.
bostonceltics,3e2xil,CelticsGreg,2,Tue Jul 21 20:43:43 2015 UTC,"It's cool but realistically the Celtics won't have more wins than the heat, bucks or wizards barring injury"
bostonceltics,3e2xil,im_so_meta,3,Tue Jul 21 15:58:17 2015 UTC,"Why? I can see how the Heat have the better team, but the Wizards and Bucks are in the same realm as the Celtics. In fact, the Wizards are my pick to not make the Playoffs next season. They are highly overrated because they made the 2nd round, people forget just how terrible they were during the second half of the season and they didn't improve this off-season."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:39 2015 UTC,"The Bucks finished ahead of us last year and are adding Parker and Monroe. Maybe the Wizards are more vulnerable, although they are still top-heavy with Wall and Beal. But Miluakee should be really good with Parker and Monroe."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,im_so_meta,5,Tue Jul 21 18:22:09 2015 UTC,"The Bucks finished ahead of us last year   They finished ahead of the Rondo/Green Celtics, not the Thomas/Crowder/Jerebko Celtics. You gotta keep in mind just how different the Celtics team that started the season was to the one that ended it."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,CelticsGreg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:06 2015 UTC,The Wizards have star players in Wall and Beal and the Bucks are better than us at every single position   Edit: Maybe besides point guard. Smart and MCW and still young so we'll see about that
bostonceltics,3e2xil,im_so_meta,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:09 2015 UTC,"Beal is not a star player. Yes, Wall is a star but he was also a star when they sucked last season. The Knicks went 10-30 with Melo last season. Having a star doesn't guarantee wins.  The Bucks also sucked during the second half of last season, after they got MCW. They decimated their bench this summer and added Monroe (who I'm glad the Celtics didn't go after). I'm not seeing huge improvements. They'll probably add to their win total from last season but the Celtics will too."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,Wayne_Spooney,2,Tue Jul 21 17:31:42 2015 UTC,"While I agree that people are overrating the Bucks, and that Monroe wasn't as great a get as most think, they have a lot working for them. They are getting Jabari back, who I think will have himself a good year. Also the Bucks have Middleton and Giannis who project to be even better this season. MCW for Knight (essentially), was a net negative for them. B-Knight helped their spacing and let the offense breath, and they will have bad interior defense. So I think the Bucks are probably a bit better than last year."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,im_so_meta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:00 2015 UTC,"I agree, I said they'll add to their win total from last year. Apparently JR Smith is showing interest in the Bucks, that would help their offense a lot. But I don't think it's ridiculous that Boston ends up winning more games. Most of the Celtics' wins came with the same core that's returning next season. Most of the Bucks' losses came after the arrival of MCW, who's returning next season. The Bucks only won 1 more game than the Celtics last season. If you just look at the second half of last season, the Celtics were the much better team. So saying Boston could win more games than Milwaukee next season is not downvote-worthy to me, it could realistically happen."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,Wayne_Spooney,2,Tue Jul 21 18:05:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, and for the record didn't down vote you. Haha. Great points all around"
bostonceltics,3e2xil,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:38 2015 UTC,"They had a bad stretch last season, but also righted the ship in the playoffs; if Wall didn't get hurt they probably make the ECF. They do lose Pierce though, which isn't a big deal in the regular season, but will hurt them come playoff time.   Beal might not be a star but he would probably be the best player on our team if we had him."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,im_so_meta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"You have more faith in the Wiz than I do. The Raps-Wiz series was bad on both ends, it was comical to watch at times. A huge part of why they played well was playing Pierce at the 4, and just having Pierce in general in a Playoffs series. I don't think their relative Playoffs success will carry over to next season."
bostonceltics,3e2xil,wickedkool,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:45 2015 UTC,Beal is a beast.  He can flat score.  One of the better scorers in the league and he is super young and will get better and better.
bostonceltics,3e2xil,im_so_meta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:37 2015 UTC,"No doubt, he's projecting to become a star player. But he's not there yet. I'm only talking about the Wiz next season, not their overall future."

bostonceltics,3e3r8w,im_so_meta,4,Tue Jul 21 21:03:12 2015 UTC,Heathen.
bostonceltics,3e3r8w,Irishbasketball,5,Tue Jul 21 21:25:08 2015 UTC,"Respectfully, /u/AfroPanther, James Young wasn't at all dominant in the D-League. He hit a lot of spot up jumpers and that's about it. His defense was bad and his shooting off the dribble and at-rim finishing were average. It's unfortunate there is a misconception about his production in the D-League because of his points per game average. It's not at all representative of his real production. On the bright side, he did improve subtly.  OP, /u/alf0nz0, I think Celtics fans love him because he's very young, he can shoot (in theory), and he's an above average athlete. He was also hyped pre-draft. I've never been a big fan though, even going back to high school, of either him or Julius Randle."
bostonceltics,3e3r8w,KevinOConnorNBA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:07:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, the Kevin O'Connor? I love your work on CelticsBlog.com!   You raise good points. Young's D-Leage stats might be misleading and perhaps I got carried away using words like ""dominance"" and ""freakish"" to describe him. While it's hard not to get excited about potential, it's of course very important to be realistic and not get one's hopes up too much.   He still has a long way to go for sure. As you mentioned, he doesn't really create his own shot. Additionally his defense is noticeably bad -- something that was very evident in the summer league, so OP I definitely agree with you there.   My point was just that fans are excited about him because he's shown the potential to score (albeit in a limited capacity and against lesser competition), is athletic (or, as /u/endubs suggested, has a long wing-span), and is very young.   tl;dr: We shouldn't get too carried away by the hype, but fans like myself are excited about Young's youth and potential."
bostonceltics,3e3r8w,AfroPanther,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:27:05 2015 UTC,"lol what's up man. Thanks I'm glad you enjoy it! =) My whole thing with Young is, I think he's someday an NBA player, but I don't see how the opportunity will ever be there for the Celtics. I could be dead wrong, but it's hard to foresee it over the duration of his rookie contract when assessing the entire roster full of talent."
bostonceltics,3e3r8w,KevinOConnorNBA,9,Tue Jul 21 22:38:37 2015 UTC,I think we all just need to give him some more time to develop. He's still only 19 years old and was the youngest player on our Summer League roster. His confidence and skills will grow over time. It's still to early to tell what kind of player he'll turn into. Most of us are just high on him out of pure excitement and just because he has an unknown potential. It's fun to speculate.
bostonceltics,3e3r8w,kabob23,3,Tue Jul 21 19:11:57 2015 UTC,"This is a great point. I don't disagree that Young hasn't shown much as of yet, but it's all about perspective. He's obviously got the physical tools needed to become a legit NBA guy, or else there wouldn't be any talk about potential, but it's still far too early to tell if he'll be able to put those tools together in a way that will allow him to reach his full potential. I think as Celtic fans we need to do a better job tempering expectations for our young guys early on in their careers. We've seen it with Young. Now we're seeing it a little bit with Hunter and Mickey. While it's fun to speculate on what a player might become, it's also important to keep everything in perspective. Remember that these are kids and with the exception of a select few players, guys in the 19-23 age range rarely ever make a huge impact for playoff teams. It's just the way it goes. The key is to help these kids along the best we can and try to get them to reach their potential so that by the time they're in their primes (25-30 yrs old), they can help contribute to a contending team. I'm a fan of our young guys and am just as excited as the next guy to see what they will become but we really just need to take a step back and let them develop and get to a point where they can either contribute to our team or to a point where it is painfully obvious that they will never contribute to our team. We don't need to rush to judgement on a player who has been in the league for one or two years. I understand why people do it, because it's definitely fun to speculate. We just have to try to keep our speculations separate from what the reality is. The reality is that Young just isn't ready to contribute right now. That doesn't mean he never will be and that doesn't mean he's not a good player. He's just not ready for the NBA yet and until he is it's tough to do anything other than speculate about how his career could turn out."

bostonceltics,3e3r8w,MScelticsfan33,11,Tue Jul 21 21:18:47 2015 UTC,"For some context on Young I am 25 almost 26 and I'm a rock climber. Through climbing I meet a lot of younger people and I've spent the last year climbing with a guy who is 19/20 (Young's age). He does stuff ALL The time that reminds me how young and inexperienced (and even irresponsible) he is. And I'm not that much older and I don't even feel very life experienced or that much more mature than him. And that is after working a 9-5 for the last 4 years.  Being young in the NBA is NOT a good thing. Who has it worked out for? Kobe, Lebron, KG. What do they all share? A mentality to win and to be the best. If you're super young in the NBA and you don't have this mindset, its just not going to work for you until you figure out your head, your confidence, and your place in the NBA. Unfortunately for Young, he doesn't have this mindset."
bostonceltics,3e3r8w,edwardsamson,4,Tue Jul 21 19:26:20 2015 UTC,"There's tons of guys who came into the league very young and turned into above average players: Amir Johnson, Giannis, Gerald Green, al Jefferson. There's four off the top of my head. I'm sure there's many more. Not saying young wi be a superstar or anything, but work ethic/mentally he hasn't shown glaring problems like you are insinuating."

bostonceltics,3e3r8w,WilmerGodFrog,7,Tue Jul 21 20:39:53 2015 UTC,"Largely invisible in the d-league? He averaged 21 ppg on 46% shooting (44% from 3).   People are high on him because of the aforementioned dominance in the d-league, his freakish athleticism (see his dunk on Brimah) and his youth.  I'm not saying he'll be a superstar, but considering his youth, size, athleticism, and potential I think there is still a lot of room for him to grow."

bostonceltics,3e3r8w,BrajonBrondo,2,Tue Jul 21 20:42:17 2015 UTC,Fab Melo was 23 when he put up that infamous triple double in the D-League. Young is 19.
bostonceltics,3e3r8w,im_so_meta,2,Tue Jul 21 20:59:54 2015 UTC,Melo averaged something like 8 points and 6 rebounds as a big man. He had 1 good game where he got 10 blocks to make a triple double but was otherwise very average.
bostonceltics,3e3r8w,migibb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:18 2015 UTC,Fab Melo had a good game or two. But his performance in the d league was mediocre at best.  Young meanwhile was consistently dominant.

Whether you think his performance in the D-League was dominant, great, or merely good, he put up good numbers. 21ppg on ~40% from 3, to me, is exciting.   I 100% admit that I might be too hyped. But in my opinion, James Young had a better D-Leage career than Fab Melo. That was my point."

bostonceltics,3e3r8w,AfroPanther,3,Tue Jul 21 19:48:52 2015 UTC,"Probably not average but I also don't agree that he has freakish athleticism..he's not all that explosive, and he has something like a 35 inch Vert, which is good but not freakish..that one dunk he had was nice and all, but it's more a credit to his length/wingspan rather than his athleticism.."
bostonceltics,3e3r8w,endubs,2,Tue Jul 21 19:55:12 2015 UTC,"Well don't forget he added 3 inches to his vertical! :P   Joking aside, that's a very fair criticism.

He is still really young. I am just happy we are in control of his development and he is kind of a pair with Marcus Smart, in the sense that he will be expected to be a leader in practice to show the younger guys the ropes. He has been in the system but knows he will have playing time competition with Hunter, and because of that I am hoping it lights a fire under him. I think it is still too early to tell, but I am hoping he figures it out."

bostonceltics,3e2qk1,crustman34,6,Tue Jul 21 14:39:24 2015 UTC,"Two of the more interesting parts from the article:   the other hand, second-rounder Jordan Mickey was drawing praise even before showing his talents at summer league.  Said one personnel man: “He’s going to be so good, he’ll make people forget about the guys they took in the first round. We talked about taking Mickey in the first round, and then we tried to buy a pick early in the second round to get him. But I don’t know about Boston’s first-round guys.”   And:   But all those who say the Celtics could never attract a major free agent might want to know that, if for any reason the Cavaliers situation hadn’t worked out, he could have wound up in Boston.  According to one impeccable source on the matter — a non-Celtics source — Boston might not be the NBA Siberia some have made it out to be.  “If there was some reason Cleveland didn’t want him, which sounds pretty silly . . . but if they wanted to go in a different direction, I think Boston was going to be his second choice,” the source said.   The stuff on Rozier and Hunter doesn't really worry me, I'm more interested in the great praise for Mickey and the fact that Boston's hunt for a free agent isn't as hopeless as made out to be."
bostonceltics,3e2qk1,Willde94,2,Tue Jul 21 14:42:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know what it is, but the whole idea of any team being 'siberia' due to location is mildly far fetched to me. I'm sure it plays some factor but I feel the only reason we were viewed that way this year was because we had no big names to draw people in. This and last off season it seemed like the teams that had an easier time pulling the bigger names already had a good amount of talent on their team.  Also I have a hard time putting anything behind one un named source saying he 'could have' had Boston as a second choice. I know sources aren't often named but literally anybody could have said that, and said they were pretty close to the guy."
bostonceltics,3e2qk1,evantime,7,Tue Jul 21 16:29:35 2015 UTC,"The stuff on Rozier seems pretty outdated. How many pure point guards are there in the league now? The majority of the most effective guards in the league are score first guys that don't run the offense so much as they score within the offense. It's the same garbage scouting as when stretch bigs are knocked for not having a post game coming into the league, those guys are never going to post up in the NBA anyway so it doesn't matter.  As to Rozier not being able to run the offense. He took great care of the ball in summer league barely turning it over and often finding open teammates. I thought that was a pretty weak criticism."
bostonceltics,3e2qk1,BrajonBrondo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:34:13 2015 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better.  These GM's just sound bitter they couldn't grab him at a later pick.  He was kind of like an unspoken about secret. Boston, Houston, Chicago and Cleveland all were very interested. I'm sure some GM's hoped he was available in the 2nd round.   Like in the Bulpett article Mickey is a first round level talent but GM's wanted to trade, buy or draft Mickey in that round as a pure value play.    Gives us more reason why Mickey was hell bent on getting a first rounder type contract."
bostonceltics,3e2qk1,Wayne_Spooney,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:27:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with your points generally, but Rozier did have a tough time running the offense. He looked inexperienced running the pick and roll, and had a bunch of careless turnovers. That's totally fine, and I think he can figure it out, but my opinion is he isn't as far along as you make it sound."
bostonceltics,3e2qk1,evantime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:58 2015 UTC,Basketball is funny because people can watch the same game and come out with different opinions. I didn't really see the careless turnovers. He only had 1.6 a game in Vegas which is less than Smart who was praised fro his ability to run the pick and roll in the summer leagues.  I don't think Rozier will be ready to run the offense this year but I think he will get there and him bringing his turnovers way down and improving his shot selection compared to Louisville made me hopeful.
bostonceltics,3e2qk1,Wayne_Spooney,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:53 2015 UTC,"I think the turnover problem was more a Utah thing. He definitely has lots of potential and I liked what I saw. I just think he needs to be much more patient, and he takes a lot of bad shots when he gets into the paint, which he can do at will. Either way, I'm excited to see what type of player he can become, and all of his faults are more than fixable."
bostonceltics,3e2qk1,evantime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:05 2015 UTC,"I was not a fan of the pick when we made it. Yet leading up to the draft I wanted Ainge to select the player with the biggest upside. After watching him play and hearing how hard he works I think he was the player with the biggest upside available.  That being said I expect it to take a couple years for him to learn to play the pick and roll, how to get quality shots instead of settling for bad shots and to play good off the ball defense."
bostonceltics,3e2qk1,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:40 2015 UTC,"I agree that the term combo guard as a perjorative is outdated, but I still worry about his shooting.

bostonceltics,3e2qk1,evantime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:37 2015 UTC,"I thought Rozier's shooting was encouraging in the summer league. Imo his problem is shot selection, it seemed like when he took quality shots he hit a high percentage.  While I don't think he will be ready to play next to Smart next year. In a few years I expect both to improve their shooting to the point it's a tenable solution."

bostonceltics,3e2qk1,mifflin50,2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:37 2015 UTC,I'm definitely sold on at least Hunter. Seems to have great passing ability to pair with his shooting ability and doing more than one thing effectively will help him stick around the league and maybe be in Boston's rotation regularly. He also seems to be a very smart player from everything I've watched and read. Totally sold.
bostonceltics,3e2qk1,ivanfears,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:22 2015 UTC,"""Hunter, meanwhile, still looks like he’ll be spending some quality time in Maine this winter, but he showed dramatic improvement after a pair of deer-in-the-headlights outings in Salt Lake City.  The interesting thing is that he came advertised as a shooter and, while he still had some man-to-man defensive issues, Hunter showed good instincts getting his hands into passing lanes""  That's the first time I've heard hunters general level of play described that way, did I miss something?  I was really hoping he could provide some shooting off the bench in the 2 spot this yr, Bulpett seems to think hes not going to get any run outside of maine...  which would be disappointing."
bostonceltics,3e2qk1,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:11 2015 UTC,"It will be hard to find a lot minutes for both Hunter and Rozier. If Rozier makes the rotation our top 4 guards are settled and there would only be minutes at the tail end of the rotation. Likewise, if Hunter makes the rotation, Rozier would be on the bench.   Unless we trade one of our top 3 guards, one of these guys will be in Maine or not cracking the primary rotation (ala Pressey)"

If a Celtics fan says that they are valuable assets we're told that they will all be in the 10 to 15 range, however, in all the ""rank the conference"" threads people seem to be projecting us to have something like the 4th, 11th and our pick around 10th to 17th.  I'm also tired of justifying my confidence in Marcus Smart.  I think that Celtics fans are not given much tolerance to be happy about our future and our assets. I feel like there's some die hard Sixer fans who desperately don't want our rebuild to work before theirs. They'll argue any point, they'll talk down our players, our future picks, Ainge, Stevens, whoever. I think that some of them have as much invested in the Celtics failing as they have in their own team succeeding. They have this idea that we're bitter rivals to the death when I really feel no rivalry towards the Sixers. In terms of teams that I want to beat they aren't in the top 5.  I'm reaching a ""ok let's just wait and see what happens next season"" stage and it's only mid July."
bostonceltics,3e46e9,crustman34,5,Tue Jul 21 21:14:31 2015 UTC,I know what you mean about the sixers thing.
bostonceltics,3e46e9,im_so_meta,2,Tue Jul 21 21:18:39 2015 UTC,"Feel the same way. Just tired of justifying everything. If there were some cut and dry formula to rebuilding that works perfectly every time and we weren't following that schematic: ok. But there isn't. Every method to rebuilding requires like 90% luck. The Sixers will need luck, Celtics will need luck, the Lakers, the Wolves, even the Bucks and Jazz who people act like have already won 5 championships are gonna need a ton of luck to get where they want to be.  There's no method to rebuilding that is better than the other, so from now on, I'm gonna try and sit out those discussions. ""Who's rebuilding better, did Ainge make a mistake not drafting Player X, how valuable really are our assets, who has the best young core, etc., etc.,"" the only answer to those questions is, 'we'll have to wait and see'"
bostonceltics,3e46e9,Swedemon,3,Tue Jul 21 22:46:35 2015 UTC,"Because it's hard to keep tabs on 30 teams. People just look at the season record, see that Boston didn't add any major game changers in free agency and assume Indiana and Miami will leapfrog them up the standings.   People also forget how bad the Raptors, Wizards and Bucks were during the second half of the season and just look at the season record.  I don't really mind, it will only make it that much more fun when Boston takes everyone by surprise."
bostonceltics,3e46e9,MScelticsfan33,2,Tue Jul 21 21:24:21 2015 UTC,ahhh yeah.
bostonceltics,3e46e9,edwardsamson,2,Tue Jul 21 21:27:34 2015 UTC,We have no players that are locks for the all star game.  But a ton of potential.
bostonceltics,3e46e9,jceltics,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:56:54 2015 UTC,"We have a lot of team potential, I agree. CBS's system seems to be something anyone can be thrown into and still find a way to contribute. I want to envision Smart, Mickey, KO, and Hunter emerge as all-stars. Better yet I hope RJ can turn into our next Pierce(Iso,Clutch,Rainmaker). But I do see that we don't have guys like Hezonja, Aaron Gordon, Embiid, Noel, Okafor, Towns, Mudiay, Anthony Davis. What I do see us having is solid role-playing options that a ""star"" or ""4th Quarter Playmaker"" could slide in and immediately maximize their abilities in a proven and adaptive system. That is why I see our team possessing a lot of potential, which is better than what some other rebuilding squads possess.   I hope our young guys emerge and want to carry the torch to the Finals for us, but I am still hoping we find a way to exploit another organization for a star in the next few years. Until then, I am excited to watch our young guys develop, learn, and evolve into professionals. I hope these young guys surprise me. But either way I am already ready for October."
bostonceltics,3e46e9,WKWA,2,Tue Jul 21 21:05:45 2015 UTC,Because they all have short term memory. It wasn't that long ago when the Celtics had matched the Cavs post-allstar record for the best in the East.

bostonceltics,3e439e,Cruzinspeed,6,Tue Jul 21 20:18:01 2015 UTC,I think that if we had Portis we'd be in the same predicament as with Rozier but at a different position. He wouldn't play.
bostonceltics,3e439e,migibb,5,Tue Jul 21 20:45:14 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Rozier and Mickey than Portis and Mickey. If you want to play the hindsight game, we should have gone with someone like Justin Anderson at 16. Portis fell in the draft because he has a really low upside compared to other players. To be honest, he's kind of like an insane Brandon Bass. I don't think it's crazy to say Mickey has higher upside.   And besides, Summer League doesn't really matter at all when everything is said and done."

BB is Ryan Gomes is Leon Powe. Even DA himself is questioning his picking Rozier. “I think he’s trying to find his way,” Ainge said. “I’m not worried about Terry. I think a lot of things with his defense are excellent. But you can see he’s got a way to go.”"
bostonceltics,3e439e,Fozzy24,3,Tue Jul 21 20:57:27 2015 UTC,What?
bostonceltics,3e439e,TheGameDoneChanged,2,Tue Jul 21 22:42:55 2015 UTC,"I liked Portis coming out and probably wouldve preferred to pick him over Rozier. That being said, it's wayyy to early to tell if Ainge made a mistake. Plenty of guys do well in summer league and never make a dent in the league, and vice versa. I also think it's harder for guards to adapt in the summer league than it is for bigs, as the guards have to try and run an offense for a team that has never really played together. Rozier has shown some promise, let's give it some time."
bostonceltics,3e439e,endubs,2,Tue Jul 21 20:50:55 2015 UTC,Portis is kind of repetitive to Mickey.  I probably would have liked either Anderson or RHJ.  I'd probably trade Sully/Kelly and Young for either of those two.  It would solve our roster issue and make us a lot more balanced.
bostonceltics,3e439e,4x4runner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:52:58 2015 UTC,"Mickey is more athletic, a better defender, has a bigger wingspan, and has shown a good jumper. I believe CBS will roll out some fast-pace-small-ball lineups with either Amir or Mickey playing center and Mickey looks like he could be a good enough defender to pull it off."

bostonceltics,3e32vh,MScelticsfan33,13,Tue Jul 21 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"Boston Celtics  Added: Jae Crowder (re-signed), R.J. Hunter (draft), Jonas Jerebko (re-signed), Amir Johnson (FA), Perry Jones (trade), David Lee (trade), Jordan Mickey (draft), Terry Rozier (draft) Lost: Brandon Bass (FA), Luigi Datome (FA), Phil Pressey (waived) Grade: B  Unable to land the big star they've long coveted, the Celtics have continued to stockpile young talent and contracts high on value. After trying and failing to trade up, they drafted both Hunter and Rozier in the first round. Second-round pick Mickey was the team's best rookie during the NBA summer league in Las Vegas, averaging 13.8 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.6 blocks per game. Mickey and Johnson give the team much-needed rim protection. It's a bit trickier to see where Lee fits in a suddenly crowded frontcourt. Boston also brought back Crowder on a contract that figures to age well as the cap rises -- five years and $35 million."
bostonceltics,3e32vh,iritian,4,Tue Jul 21 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"I think Ainge made sound moves. The Amir Johnson move didn't do it for me until I learned that the 2nd year was non-guaranteed. I didn't like the Rozier pick and still don't, but I cede that I am no expert on the guy.   I think Ainge made good moves in pretty difficult circumstances. He couldn't land big free agents so he got an interesting one and maintained flexibility. The David Lee trade is a big winner given the price.   Not a great off-season, but smart moves by Ainge nonetheless."

bostonceltics,3e1r46,dougglatt69,8,Tue Jul 21 12:28:08 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, but at the same time he is arguably the most important player on our team (especially in regards to our future).

bostonceltics,3e1r46,mrjlodge12,4,Tue Jul 21 13:16:02 2015 UTC,Maybe because he was screaming in pain and he needed stitches on his hand because the skin around his fingers tore from going sideways.

Perry Jones should be on notice.

bostonceltics,3dyndf,Fruit_Pastilles,4,Mon Jul 20 16:51:38 2015 UTC,Great signing.  Most likely means either Sully or Kelly are going to be gone if the right trade comes up.
bostonceltics,3dyndf,vloaded,3,Mon Jul 20 16:57:43 2015 UTC,"Curious, why do you think it's a death knell for either one? The two new bigs coming in are essentially expiring contracts and I don't see Lee being here long term."
bostonceltics,3dyndf,gfygfygfy,6,Mon Jul 20 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like Lee is going to be one of the top three players on the team.  Dude was an all star who just didn't play last year because Draymond Green went off wen Lee was hurt.  Kerr didn't wanna funk with the mojo.  But Lee is a guy who can average 16 and 10 absolutely.     I don't know much about Amir Johnson, but Sully and Kelly is an easier sell on a trade because their salaries are much lower than Amir.  I like Sully and I love Kelly, but they have way too many PF's on the roster.    There's a reason why the Lee trade and Crowder signing haven't been made official, and it's because the Celts are in a position to do at least one more move since they will have the cap space to do so. I wouldn't be surprised if there is one more move before the season is done."
bostonceltics,3dyndf,vloaded,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:54 2015 UTC,"You didn't address his point that the two new bigs are on expiring contracts. In fact, no bigs on the Celtics roster are under guaranteed contract after next season except Kelly and now Mickey. There's no reason to trade any of them. Especially not just to carve out space for a 2nd round pick for one season."
bostonceltics,3dyndf,im_so_meta,5,Mon Jul 20 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"The Wallace/Lee trade really skewed things, because we went from someone who would willingly ride the pine and take on a pseudo coaching role to someone who can contribute if given the opportunity. It's a lot harder for people to view him as being just another expiring like Wallace due to the way he can play."
bostonceltics,3dyndf,gfygfygfy,2,Mon Jul 20 18:08:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a good idea to trade away young bigs like Kelly or Sully that will be RFA's just to make Lee feel better about his role for one season. It's not all about next season, it's about the long-term. Yes, there are a lot of bigs on the roster for next season and that's great, it gives the team a lot of depth, a lot of different match-up opportunities. Then next summer Ainge can take a long hard look on who has a future with the team, along with looking at other free agents across the league. We gotta keep in mind that Zeller, Sully, Amir, Jerebko, Lee (that's FIVE bigs!) are not under guaranteed contract after next season."
bostonceltics,3dyndf,im_so_meta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:10 2015 UTC,"I think most people here are hoping the Celtics play well this season and warrant a playoff spot.  Even with five bigs that are non guaranteed, you have to assume at least one or two of them will resign again if they make the playoffs.  Look at the way this NBA off season went.  Players including Monroe made Milwaukee a destination team because of their young core and solid playoff play.  MILWAUKEE.   Granted, I don't fully believe Monroe is a max player (that's not the point) but players are more willing to go to teams where they think they have the best chance to win.  Another example.  Look at David West.  Dude went to San Antonio on a VETERANS MINIMUM just to play with the spurs.  If he wanted to go to the Knicks (or anywhere else for that matter) he could have gotten at least 10 mill a year.    Getting rid of Sully or Kelly (one of them, and to be honest I'd prefer Sully gone over Kelly) you give more time to Amir, or even David Lee who has proven himself to be an All Star with the hopes of him buying into the system, playing well, and resigning with the team at the end of the season."
bostonceltics,3dyndf,vloaded,2,Mon Jul 20 19:19:41 2015 UTC,We just fundamentally disagree on what's better for the future. I'd rather have Sully and Kelly sign with the team long-term than re-signing 33 year old Lee or 30 year old Amir (with bad ankles).
bostonceltics,3dyndf,im_so_meta,6,Mon Jul 20 19:27:04 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Not saying you're wrong either, just what I would prefer.  Don't think I've ever had a disagreement on the internet that ended in mutual acceptance like this.  I'm not sure what to do...  Have a good day?"

bostonceltics,3dyndf,dingleberrypeninsula,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:48 2015 UTC,Most likely by cutting Perry Jones and stashing Marcus Thornton in Europe.
bostonceltics,3dyndf,im_so_meta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:10 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, Lee is a talented player. I don't want to discredit him by calling him just an expiring, but I feel as though we'd be playing a bit of a dangerous game if we trade away our youth this off-season due to a logjam that can be remedied by the trade deadline. He's a much more viable option to trade away to me, because I don't feel like he has a future here beyond this season and he'd benefit another team. But I can't be definite about anything since we haven't even seen how he gels with the roster and what he feels his role is in the squad.  They're in a position, yeah, but being in a position doesn't mean that it will happen. That's how the story has been going for us this summer so far. The last thing I heard related to Gallo was that the Nuggets were discussing an extension with him, so that window seems to be closing. I don't see Danny as the type to be ""Well, we just signed Mickey so that means Sully or Kelly need to be the next to go,"" since that's putting yourself in a position where you'd only look for deals with either one of those involved. And Mickey's unproven against NBA caliber players so far.  It'll be interesting to see if Danny can pull off anything, but my expectations are pretty low - I imagine we'll have to either trade someone last minute or cut someone in the end.  As a side note, it's funny to see that there's a photo of Lee & Amir on  their wikipedia pages."
bostonceltics,3dyndf,gfygfygfy,2,Mon Jul 20 17:56:50 2015 UTC,"Kelly and Sully are young and hold decent trade value. Obviously not as much as Green or Rondo, but you bundle them with the right pick or the right player (Smart, Bradley, etc...), you're looking at a solid trade package.   If we have learned anything about Stevens its that he can polish a turd into a diamond. Ask Evan Turner, Humph, Crawford, etc. He is going to resurrect Lee. I could see Lee and possibly IT in the All-Star game next year. With Lee and Amir, KO and Sully are expendable."

The first contract contributed to the player being traded and the second contract might contribute to Houston getting hard capped.  The 16th pick can get up to ~$8.77M, the 28th pick can get up to ~$5.86M so isn't $5M for the 33rd pick over the same years reasonable if you think he's got potential? It's a new market benchmark for players picked 31-35 but it's not a bad deal for the player or team."

bostonceltics,3e0od3,migibb,3,Tue Jul 21 14:39:51 2015 UTC,I wonder how well Stevens could do if we lost everyone 26 and over and went in with an all-young guys team with a full preseason under their belt together.  Smart / Rozier / Thornton  Bradley*/Hunter / Young  Crowder / Jones  Sullinger / Olynyk / Holmes  Zeller / Mickey  We wouldn't be a playoff team but I wonder if we could push for 30 wins. I think that we'd definitely have a stronger reputation for having young talent.
bostonceltics,3e0od3,im_so_meta,5,Tue Jul 21 02:19:04 2015 UTC,You forgot Bradley who is younger than Crowder and Zeller.

bostonceltics,3e0od3,Heatcheck3s,2,Tue Jul 21 03:15:37 2015 UTC,"wouldn't be a playoff team   Most probably not.  Having said this, many assume Indy and Miami will be powerhouses this year. I say, let's wait a bit, esp. with Paul George I'd like to see to what extent he has recovered from that horrendous injury."
bostonceltics,3e0od3,Wayne_Spooney,3,Tue Jul 21 03:23:23 2015 UTC,"With hindsight, I think DA's choices are not bad as many ppl were afraid.  Risky yes, bad no.  Rozier is a gamble. But he plays hard and is explosive - if he improves his technique he will be a great fit.  Hunter is a really interesting player. Unpredictable. Not a solid ppg contributor (at least not for now) but someone who on a good night can create his own shots and spread the floor.  And Mickey for a second rounder is really exceeding expectations.  Remember those 'fire Ainge' cries at draft night?"
bostonceltics,3e0od3,R0ndoNumba9,3,Tue Jul 21 03:09:33 2015 UTC,"Everybody was worked up over missing out on Okafor, and/or Winslow, some barely heard of Rozier, and were generally disappointed over a lack of 'fireworks'. It was a heat of the moment thing, I'm sure we all look forward to seeing how the 3 draft picks will pan out now."
bostonceltics,3e0od3,billbrown96,3,Tue Jul 21 03:58:09 2015 UTC,"Winslow I understand, although with hindsight our offer to the Hornets was risky and could easily have turned out badly.  Okafor though? To trade up in the top-4 we would have to give a very  tempting combination of draft picks and players."
bostonceltics,3e0od3,Wayne_Spooney,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:00:41 2015 UTC,I was disappointed we didn't take Portis at 16. I just think that guy is gonna be a rock solid big man for a long time.
bostonceltics,3e0od3,BrajonBrondo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:29:04 2015 UTC,"We were all shocked Danny went for a guard at 16.  That's why I put so much hope on Rozier. Ainge took a huge gamble and IMO he wouldn't do it if there wasn't some good reason.  They had two meetings before the draft and apparently they went along very well.  Other than that, I cannot help but agree, that knowing what I did before draft night, I too would have gone for Portis instead of Rozier."
bostonceltics,3e0od3,MScelticsfan33,3,Tue Jul 21 13:42:17 2015 UTC,"Danny has said many times, only draft for talent not need. He says need is one of the last things he considers, more of a tie-breaker."
bostonceltics,3e0od3,crustman34,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:59 2015 UTC,So we draft another PF instead of another PG...
bostonceltics,3e0od3,BrajonBrondo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:36 2015 UTC,"I think Portis can play Center. He's a legit 6'11"" and has pretty good strength."
bostonceltics,3e0od3,crustman34,3,Tue Jul 21 18:08:40 2015 UTC,"Going into the draft I was hoping that we trade up somewhere in the top 10.  I absolutely did not wan't anyone projected in the 16th pick such as Dekker, Portis, Anderson.  Those guys I have strong opinions against.  I don't take mock draft too seriously, guys at the 16th range were mainly hustle players which in our current state aren't in a need for.    I actually went into the draft knowing who Terry Rozier was, he's a high upside guy, I think Rozier was a great choice considering this.  It confirmed a belief that I've had that Smart is not a sure-fire PG for us.      Literally the only 2 players/prospects I cared for at our draft range we got, and that was Rozier and RJ Hunter two very underrated prospects who are very talented. I'm probably one of the very few who was excited on draft night with our selections and was happy we didn't trade all those future draft picks to take Winslow.  Only guy I would of taken with the 9th pick is Myles Turner.  Winslow is crazy overrated and it will be known soon."
bostonceltics,3e0od3,BrajonBrondo,2,Tue Jul 21 13:59:27 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with your thought on taking Turner instead of Winslow. As soon as they identified his weakness in his running and where the problem was he became incredible on the court. He ran much better, moved in the post better, and overall looks like a great athlete. I am liking him better than WCS in retrospect."
bostonceltics,3e0od3,R0ndoNumba9,3,Tue Jul 21 21:50:27 2015 UTC,"I think we will see Rozier starting next to Smart by the All-Star break. I'm a big supporter of AB, but I'm really not sure how many things he does better than Rozier. Of course Rozier has a lot to prove, but if he plays like he did in Summer League for the first 30+ games, he could force Steven's hand. Especially if that shooting touch carries over.  Looking at last season, it seems absolutely ridiculous to predict our final game starting five (Rondo/Bradley/Green/Sully/Olynyk ---> Smart/Bradley/Turner/Bass/Zeller) but if I had to guess, I'd say we'll be starting Smart/Rozier/Crowder/Johnson/Zeller by the end of the season."

Hunter, Marcus Smart, Jae Crowder, Terry Rozier  Everybody is waiting on the Celtics to acquire or develop their next superstar, but in the meantime Danny Ainge has put together one of the deepest rosters of young talent in the league. The talent pool in Boston was made even deeper this summer with the additions of Rozier, Hunter and Jordan Mickey through the draft, and the recent acquisition of Perry Jones III via the trade market. Is there a star here? Can the crafty Ainge parlay this group into his next big three? At least he has given the Celtics plenty to work with."

bostonceltics,3dygkg,BradStevensGOAT,2,Mon Jul 20 16:09:14 2015 UTC,I love hearing positive comments about our young guys. It seems like for the most part the young Celtics core is only mentioned when saying none of them are good enough to trade for a star.   While this might be true it doesn't mean that the young core doesn't have quality players. 9 of the 15 players on the roster next year will probably be 24 or under which is a real positive for the franchise going forward. It is also why a lot of projections will have us winning more games than the average fan expects (most models have players improving until 28).
bostonceltics,3dygkg,mcorcoran3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:14 2015 UTC,"Eh... misleading article, because it's measuring effectiveness last year when most people will assume it's talking about the best young cores moving forward.  Obviously the Wolves would be one of the top teams.  They have two phenoms on that squad + several other intriguing young pieces.    Also, the Embiid situation is unquestionably a blow to Philly, but I don't think Boston could trade their entire lot of ""key young players"" (Jared Sullinger, Kelly Olynyk, R.J. Hunter, Marcus Smart, Jae Crowder, Terry Rozier) for Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor..."

He seems ball handlers, swings, wings, and bigs.  All of Smart, Rozier, IT fit as ball handlers and any two could be on the floor at the same time without competing with one another. I see them as complementary players."

Young probably doesn't start the season in the rotation though.  His problem in the NBA (and in the early summer league games) is that everyone knows he is a 3 point shooter so the guy defending him would never give him enough space. In the SL game against the Spurs he started cutting to the midrange in order to free himself from his defender. I think his career will be heavily dependent on whether he can free himself for consistent good looks or if he will settle for contested jumpers.  He still has a lot of work to do but he has the time to do it, since he is the youngest player on our team by over a year despite being in his second season."

bostonceltics,3dw99w,Copper_Dome,3,Mon Jul 20 01:51:08 2015 UTC,"I really don't see it with the current roster. Both the Bucks and the Heat got better and we only made lateral moves, if that."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,celtic-pride1,4,Mon Jul 20 12:06:20 2015 UTC,"The Heat got better if you assume perfect health, which I'm not sure you can, otherwise they bring back more or less the same team from last year. I do expect a healthy Heat team to finish ahead of the Celts, but that's part of the ""health and circumstances"" listed above.  The Bucks add Greg Monroe but I'd like to see how he effects their spacing & defense before I really give them credit for it. Hopefully Jabari is healthy, that would make a huge difference for that team.  They switch out Brandon Knight for MCW, I think that's a big mistake.   I have to see DeMarre Carroll in Toronto to believe he can play outside the Hawks system. The Raps aren't great at making disparate parts work. Some guys thrive, other guys fall off a cliff there. They could regress.  The Hawks could regress some without Carroll despite the Splitter addition. Still likely ahead of the Celts.  The Cavs win 60-65 games this year if they're healthy.  The Bulls could see a small drop off if Noah continues to suck.  I like all the shooters Washington added, they've had a very underrated offseason even with the Pierce defection.   Brooklyn will be markedly worse. D-Will was very good in the 2nd half of last season and Jarrett Jack was awful. Losing a good big man for a pick in the 20s is terrible. Even if RHJ sounds good he's likely not as a rookie.   Indiana adds Paul George and Monta Ellis, loses David West and Roy Hibbert. George is better than every FA that moved this offseason but they lost their identity in the process.   If Amir Johnson and David Lee are healthy this team added two things they haven't had and lost nothing. I'm not sure how that's lateral. The 24-12 after the break was a real thing. This team can compete with anyone in the East other than the Cavs at that pace."

Absolutely not. In another reply to me you said:   Every team is dependent on being healthy.    MIA has huge injury risks across the board. Chicago has huge injury risks. Milwaukee needs Jabari to be both healthier and better as well as maintaining their defensive identity while working in Greg Monroe and getting by with a full year of MCW at PG. That's certainly not trivial and it's not ""insane"" to think a 2 game swing in the Celtics favor happens. LeBron's been amazingly durable through his career but if something bad happens does that team keep playing hard? It wouldn't be insane for the Celtics to finish ahead of any of these individual teams, it would just require luck to go the Celtics way."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,Copper_Dome,7,Tue Jul 21 03:19:36 2015 UTC,"I think people are overestimating both the Pacers and Toronto, and I think we will be better than both.   Pacers- Say what you want about Roy Hibbert, but whenever he was on the floor, their defense was stingy. Losing him will really hurt their ability to protect the rim. Also, they lost David West who has been probably their second best player behind PG3 the last few years. He's great on both ends for them and was a leader in the locker room. Their replacements? Jordan Hill who is ok at best, and Myles Turner. I like Turner, but he is a rookie and will not be a good defensive player this year. Ellis is a terrible defender and injury prone, George Hill is what he is, and Stuckey is ok off the bench. Overall, I think they go as Turner goes, and, at least for this year, are worse than the Celtics.   Toronto- They were not a good team the second half of the season. Taking out their hot start they pretty much played .500 ball. Carroll will help, but that guy feasted off Atlanta's ball movement last year (Goldsberry on Grantland has a great article about how Carroll got his shots). He will be an upgrade over Ross, but he presence alone isn't good for anything more than a few wins. They also lost Amir, their best defensive player. That means their starting bigs are My Name is Jonas and Patty Patterson. Holy, fucking, matador defense. Valachunnnn is a decent defender just be being huge, but he is terrible defending the PnR, and Paterson is just an awful defender. I think these guys got worse, and that the second half was more indicative of their skill than the first half. Thus, I think we will be better.  One quick note about why our record will be better than our ""talent."" We are deep. During the second half of the season, if a team like Miami loses two starters they get hurt bad. Not the Celtics, we just keep rolling of legit NBA players down to about 15 men. Short of Atlanta, no other team in the East has that luxury. This will grab us some wins that we don't ""deserve."""
bostonceltics,3dw99w,Wayne_Spooney,2,Mon Jul 20 13:00:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed on Indiana. Take a look at their front court, it's pretty thin (Myles Turner definitely has a bright future, but the 19 year old is not likely to make a huge impact next season):  Lavoy Allen  Jordan Hill  Ian Mahinmi  Myles Turner  Shayne Whittington  (and possibly some time with  Paul George as a stretch 4).  They definitely improved their offense, but PG, Ellis, George Hill, Stuckey - these guys are all ball-dominant. That's where losing David West is going to hurt the most, a guy who can stretch the floor as an excellent midrange catch-and-shooter."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,fantavlik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:50:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed, not a fan of the Ellis/Stuckey back-court at all. That's going to be horrible. They might get the offense to average levels, but their defense is going to fall drastically, which is what propped that team up even at their best. I like PG13 at the 4, but then who plays on the wing? Stuckey? G. Hill? Solomon Hill??? Chris Copeland????? I mean it's awful. I just don't see them competing this year."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,Wayne_Spooney,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think Indy is great but we barely finished ahead of them last year and they were mostly without George and totally without Ellis. If the rosters stay similar they should be better than us.   Also, I don't think we should confuse our parity of talent for ""depth."" It is true that there is not much drop-off between Zeller and KO, but that is because neither is good enough to be a starter on a contender.   IT and JC are above average bench players (IT might be the best bench player in the NBA) but both guys are better right now than the guys they backup."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:48:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think getting PG13 back makes up for how absolutely terrible their frontcourt is. I also don't like Ellis on this team at all with Stuckey also in the mix. Ellis would have been great for them last year because Hibbert was there on defense to clean the trash up, and West is a solid defender as well. Now he is a liability on one end on a team with a dearth of help behind him. That's not a good mix. They will have no spacing if Ellis and Stuckey share the floor, which should be pretty damn often.   I think there is a big difference in talent/skill between Zeller and Kelly. Kelly is so bad defensively and on the glass.   Regardless, your point is well taken, but Zach Lowe makes this point all the time. There is something to be said for having legit rotation guys in the 9-12 spots in the regular season (emphasis strongly on ""in the regular season""). Jonas Jerebko is a lot better than nearly every other team's 10th man. With the grind of the season, that matters. Lowe constantly refers to that as a strength of Atlanta. Even how low I rate Kelly, he's certainly much better than almost any other 5th big man in the league (Amir, Sully, Lee, Zeller ahead of him for the sake of argument).   EDIT: I also forgot to mention, the team as constructed does not really reflect the overall record last year. We had a terrible start to the season, and we lost a ton of close games early. The roster now is a better version of what we did in the second half. I don't think we will be 24-12 good (or whatever the exact number was), but I also think you have to analyze last year's record with that in mind. So saying we were ""barely better than Indy last year"" doesn't take into account the whole story."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,Wayne_Spooney,12,Tue Jul 21 02:16:07 2015 UTC,"while I was worried about Boston making the playoffs with the East getting better than it was last year and us not making any necessarily huge improvements in the offseason, though I think we made good moves.   You gotta keep in mind the ""moves"" Boston made were during last season and it immediately paid off in wins. Then this off-season they pretty much doubled down on those moves by re-signing Crowder and Jerebko and keeping most of the core together. I feel like if Boston had acquired Isaiah, Crowder and Jerebko this off-season we'd be much more excited about it but because it happened before the trade deadline we kind of take it for granted. To me Amir and Lee are just gravy, succulent and possibly delicious gravy, but gravy nonetheless. Perry Jones is a tater tot."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,im_so_meta,5,Mon Jul 20 02:43:46 2015 UTC,I'm actually a lot higher on Lee than most seem to be. He'll be a starter at some point I think and he'll be another go to scorer besides Thomas
bostonceltics,3dw99w,im_so_meta,7,Mon Jul 20 03:08:35 2015 UTC,"I'm also high on him. I'm high on Amir too, I'm high af basically. But my main point is that Lee is not a player that takes a team from 40 wins to 50 wins, neither is Amir. To me, by just bringing the core back Boston already has a team that could win 48 games. Adding Amir and Lee might notch it up to 50."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,mcorcoran3,4,Mon Jul 20 03:15:06 2015 UTC,50 seems like a lot to me this year. But I hope you're right
bostonceltics,3dw99w,im_so_meta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:19:07 2015 UTC,"50 wins? C'mon. Paul Pierce never had a 50-win season until he had two other franchise players. He went from 99-2007 without doing that once (49 was the highest in 2002). If we can't win 50 games with a franchise player like Pierce, we can't do it without a franchise player."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,cyberklown28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:33 2015 UTC,The Hawks just won 60 games without one. Toronto won 49 last year. I can see Boston being 1 game better than last year's Toronto team.
bostonceltics,3dw99w,papi617,12,Tue Jul 21 02:57:58 2015 UTC,"I expect a slow start, hanging around the 9th seed, then a trade deadline deal for Cousins that launches us into the playoffs."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,mcorcoran3,10,Mon Jul 20 02:58:04 2015 UTC,I like the way you think.
bostonceltics,3dw99w,jamesdidathing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:25:10 2015 UTC,"We really should temper this stuff. Sac-town just gave up 3 years of draft capital to make themselves able to sign free agents to appease Cousins. It would be the dumbest thing ever for them to do that and then just flip their best player. Maybe if they fire the GM or something, but even then, they would just trade him to LA who can offer them  a package centered on Russell, an asset more valuable than any of ours."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,mcorcoran3,6,Tue Jul 21 01:58:36 2015 UTC,"I think you're just about on point with your prediction.  We have a tendency here to overrate the team based on a stretch of play last year where the top teams in each conference had begun to rest starters and the teams fighting in our general record range were all devastated by injuries.  I don't like to believe in the whole ""East got better finally"" thing usually, because it seems every time the West just annihilates our hopes of parity, but I think this year every East contender improved with the exceptions of Atlanta, Chicago, Brooklyn, and maybe Washington.    Atlanta will be fine, though..  They'll likely cede the 1 spot to Cleveland after losing Carroll but Budenholzer is a brilliant coach who absolutely deserved his Coach of the Year award.  Chicago lost a great coach in Thibodeau but they'll also gain back some consistency over a full season because I don't think their new guy will have the same penchant for absolutely running players into the ground before season's end.  I honestly don't think they'll falter much.  Washington I think at the very least has stayed put.  Pierce played beautifully for them in the playoffs but I like to believe he was less of a perfect fit in the regular season where he'd need to play limited minutes and at a slower pace than the Wiz probably wanted to go with young guys like Wall and Beal.  I think their improvement combined with Porter likely being able to serve as a good enough replacement will have them anywhere from 6-8 seed, getting leapfrogged by Milwaukee.  So that leaves us in that same 7-10 scrum as last year.  It's about 80% likely that Brooklyn drops after their offseason, but at the same time one healthy Brook Lopez season could change that.  We know how tenacious Brooklyn has been over the past few seasons.  They have a tough culture there and at the very least will be a dangerous spoiler team.    Now is where the forecast gets bleaker.  Having even a remotely more healthy season than last year means that the Heat will likely jump us.  They looked like a pretty decent if not above average team before the persistent injuries began to strike.  Obviously, Chris Bosh, who looked phenomenal, was the biggest loss, but Josh McRoberts is criminally underrated on every basketball forum I've ever visited.  He is a brilliant passer who instantly improves any offense he plays on.  Smart player.  Not to mention the other losses they had.  And of course, even if Paul George isn't 100% up to speed by the time the start of the season rolls around, he's still miles better than anyone on the Celtics on either end of the floor.  That alone should put the Pacers in the playoffs, not to mention the addition by subtraction of Roy Hibbert.  Roy's a good defensive player but he mucked up their offensive scheme pretty badly.  They have some fairly dynamic playmakers on that team but Roy forced them to basically play 4-on-5.  This is all not to mention the improvements made by Detroit, Charlotte, and Orlando.  Let's not forget that Detroit put together a pretty impressive run around the same time as us until a dramatically improved Brandon Jennings went down.  Mario Hezonja probably won't make that quick of a splash, but to me he looked more NBA ready in the Summer League than the projections would have you believe.  And Lance Stephenson is gone from Charlotte.  It's terrific that we're very optimistic about our team on this sub, but we still have a pretty significant imbalance on this roster.  We have a bunch of players that possess the same general skillset (small, defensive tenacious guards, undersized bigs), and the help that we've brought in is unproven and likely a few years from making a significant impact.  Mickey has the athleticism to make up for his lack of size, but we saw how the refs treated Smart as a rookie.  If he were to get playing time at all, it would likely be marred with fouls.  It's the plight of the rookie, I guess.  And RJ Hunter is probably a couple of years from being able to make a meaningful impact, even though he'll get burn at the 2 this year.  Shooting is the first thing that translates but his poor shooting, even with the context of forced bad shots, isn't a good indicator that he'll come in and be Klay Thompson right away.  James Young is yet another prospect that gets us salivating, but realistically he won't be a game changer this year or next, either.  He's incredibly raw defensively and despite having some skills in certain areas, his offense has looked like a disjointed mess.  It's more likely he'll get shuttled to the D-League again in favor of Hunter and maybe Smart at the 2 if Rozier gets any run.  This is all, of course, notwithstanding trades that balance out the roster or a sudden major leap by one of our bigs (could David Lee morph back into an All-Star in his contract year?  Probably not.)  We'll fight hard as hell because I think we've built a phenomenal basketball culture here, and I certainly won't be joining the tank train, but I think barring another bizzaro season of injuries there's a pretty good chance of us falling back into the lottery."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,LarBrd33,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:21:12 2015 UTC,"Well said. In my mind there are 7 teams are better than us for sure -- the six that finished ahead of us last year and Miami. Indy is probably better than us as well, getting George back and adding Ellis.  To make the playoff we will have to be better than Indy, and also stave off a blossoming Orlando team. Detroit will be decent as well as Drummond is twice as good as our best player -- and in this league that matters.   We are better than the Nets, Charlotte, the Knicks for sure. Probably will finish better than Detroit. But I think Orlando makes a leap sooner or later. I think we might well be in the lottery this year or the 8th seed at best, unless Stevens has another amazing season, or we make some fireworks."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,OzymandiasKingofKing,6,Tue Jul 21 01:56:11 2015 UTC,"We overachieved last year.  On paper, this is a lotto team.  We'll see if Brad can get them to overachieve again."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,mcorcoran3,2,Mon Jul 20 04:54:26 2015 UTC,"The only real evidence for how good this team is comes from a small sample size post Rondo/Green. They won't play at that level the whole season, but I'd like to think they can get over .500 (especially with Johnson + Lee).  That will get you a place in the East most years.   Yes the East looks like it's improved, but don't we say that every year? Miami and Chicago are old, Atlanta and Toronto look brittle, the Cavs will sleep until the playoffs, while Charlotte/Phila/Detroit/Brooklyn/NY/etc remain bad and directionless... There is a out of room to snag 45-ish wins.  Granted, I don't like our chances in the playoffs, but the regular season shouldn't be that much of an issue."

bostonceltics,3dw99w,baseketball,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:43:37 2015 UTC,"I think you should expect higher than the 8th seed. For one reason, defense. The Celtics were 12th in the league in defense and 8th in their last 36 games. With Marcus Smart improving on d, Crowder playing more minutes and Johnson replacing Bass they should be better.  The other reason we should be better than the 8th seed is depth. No team in the league is better equipped to deal with injuries and those injuries happen to every team. With our depth we can probably sustain an injury to pretty much anyone and play at around the same level.  As to the other teams improving I think people are over valuing those teams. Sure the Pacers should be a playoff team, but their best player still might not be back to the old Paul George after his injury and they have the thinnest front court rotation in the league.   The Heat could be very good but D-Wade is probably going to miss a ton of games, Bosh probably won't be back to his old self this year and Whiteside is a ticking time bomb who could get suspended for doing something stupid at any moment."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,mcorcoran3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:05:18 2015 UTC,"Unless Danny gives us some fireworks, I think this team can win 45 games max which would put them out of 5th seed. Realistically the highest seed I see the Celtics getting is 7th."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,jcbhan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:30 2015 UTC,"This will depend so much on who stays and who gets minutes. If David Lee and Amir get a lot of minutes (as opposed to be valued expiring deals) we could win 41 games again. I still think we overachieved last year, so I still think the 7th or 8th seed is far more likely. A top 5 team in the East? No way. Cle, Chi, Was, Tor, Mia, Mil, Atl will all be better for sure. Indy is likely to be better as well. So we will probably compete with Detroit, Orlando, Charlotte etc... for the 8th seed."
bostonceltics,3dw99w,Rent-a-Bourgeois,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:42:42 2015 UTC,It's not inconceivable we win the Atlantic. Which I believe gives us the 4 seed. So I would say we could finish 4 or 7-10.

bostonceltics,3dw99w,Rent-a-Bourgeois,-6,Tue Jul 21 19:04:40 2015 UTC,"They will suck the 1st half.  Too many young players and not enough veterans.  They will be a street ball team where guys go one on one and just throw up the shot with 20 on the shot clock.  They will score a lot of points some games, and yet give up more to the other side.  In short, they are like a college team.  And will get abused accordingly by the top teams.  Probably get the #8 seed again as they will be able to keep the endurance up the whole season and play like kids in the stretch run whereas other teams will suck on purpose."
bostonceltics,3dtve3,Timi093,8,Sun Jul 19 12:22:19 2015 UTC,I love Jordan Mickey
bostonceltics,3dtve3,dcs1289,6,Sun Jul 19 13:45:32 2015 UTC,"I find it huge that he has two important things - feel for the game and basketball IQ - that can't really be taught, you either have it or not.   This is why I'm worried about Young."
bostonceltics,3dtve3,idontcarefuckit,2,Sun Jul 19 14:45:03 2015 UTC,"3 areas I always look at when scouting prospects is basketball IQ, instincts, and work ethic.  Young doesn't seem to be strong in any of those areas and it's probably what worries me most about him."
bostonceltics,3dtve3,endubs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:19:12 2015 UTC,I think he has a good work ethic at least.
bostonceltics,3dtve3,mifflin50,6,Mon Jul 20 01:45:42 2015 UTC,R.J. Hunter is good. Like really good. I wouldn't be surprised if 5 years down the road he is looked at as one of the biggest steals in recent memory.
bostonceltics,3dtve3,jdub1418,5,Sun Jul 19 16:40:36 2015 UTC,"I keep seeing people calling out Young for not wanting the ball. People keep saying he has no feel for the game or a low BBIQ. I think it's a lot simpler. If you've played basketball at all, I think it's painfully obvious he just has no confidence in his ability to string two dribbles together. He can't handle the ball at all and that affects where he can get the ball and how he can be aggressive with it. The guy put up 14 shots, so he's clearly not shy about wanting the ball and shooting it. He just can't do much else right now. Ball-handling is one of the few skills guards can actually pick up after joining the league. He reportedly spent the offseason working on his off-hand. It's possible he's just not comfortable enough with it yet. I'm gonna reserve judgement until I see him in more than 3 SL games.  So, I think there is merit to the, ""He's 19 years old! It's too early to judge!"" argument, and while Young may not be as NBA-ready as Hunter, even after a season in the D-League, it's possible he develops into an even better player down the line."
bostonceltics,3dtve3,thatssometrainshit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:17:50 2015 UTC,great point..having a good handle is really important for a player like him that doesn't excel off the ball..it's definitely something he should be putting A LOT of time into improving..
bostonceltics,3dtve3,endubs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:02:22 2015 UTC,I completely agree. He has so many drives after the defense closes out on him where he loses his dribble almost immediately.
bostonceltics,3dtve3,AWalker17,-11,Mon Jul 20 13:59:45 2015 UTC,"James Young will never make the team.  He's average for NBA standards.  But what strikes me most is that he's not very aggressive. He doesn't want the ball, he doesn't command the ball.  He'll stand there and take a pass and shoot.    Give me RJ Hunter over him any day"
bostonceltics,3dtve3,Pizzaholic1,8,Sun Jul 19 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"The kid turns 20 in a month let's give up on him because of a few SL games. Yes he didn't play well and he is not ready to play big minutes in the NBA, but he can become a good NBA player."
bostonceltics,3dtve3,Cpasky3,-11,Sun Jul 19 14:18:38 2015 UTC,Reality is that NBA talent shows right away for 99% of players.  He is not the 1%
bostonceltics,3dtve3,Pizzaholic1,6,Sun Jul 19 14:21:25 2015 UTC,"That's not true at all, unless you mean 99% of players show a few NBA level skills right away. If that's what you mean then Young has several NBA level skills, namely shooting and athleticism.   If you are saying good players are good right away, you're flat wrong. Essentially every player in the NBA shows improvement from the first to second to third seasons. After about the third year you get a good feel for where that player will be, and there are still plenty of examples of guys figuring it out later (off the type of my head: Gerald Green, Kyle Lowry, DeMarre Carrol, Danny Green)."
bostonceltics,3dtve3,Wayne_Spooney,-6,Sun Jul 19 14:36:33 2015 UTC,"He's a bust, admit it"
bostonceltics,3dtve3,Pizzaholic1,4,Sun Jul 19 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"Even if you're right about his prospects as a pro, referring to any 17th pick as a ""bust"" is silly.  Maybe the fanbase's expectations are a little unrealistic, but anything better than a rotation player at that position is a great bonus, and anything less is no huge loss."
bostonceltics,3dtve3,SpanishInfluenza,4,Sun Jul 19 17:59:24 2015 UTC,"James Young is a 19 year old wing with some size and athleticism who has proven he has a silky jump shot.  Plus the celtics spent a mid first round pick on him just last year.  There is not a chance he doesn't make the team.  He may not get many minutes, and spend some time in the d-league, but he is 100% going to be a celtic."

bostonceltics,3dtx13,BrandonIngramGOAT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:13:54 2015 UTC,"No, the NBA Draft is a cold-hearted b#tch. We own Mickey's rights. He has no recourse. He can complain, but we won't release his rights because even if he never signs with us, his draft rights have a lot of value. When a team makes a trade, they have to give up something to get that NBA player-- even if it's just draft rights to a player they own. Colton Iverson is in that boat. He is either good enough to play for the Celtics or he plays in Europe and the Celtics still own him, in case he ever learns how to be good enough for the NBA. If Mickey were undrafted, he'd be golden, but he's screwed. It's just a waiting game. The Celtics want him for as long as possible as cheaply as possible, because they know they struck gold with this kid.  Mickey wants to cash in as quick as he can as a RFA or UFA next season on his talent that is obviously good enough for the NBA.  NBA teams love to draft and stash tall dudes, especially. A personal favorite, 7' 3"" Walter Tavares  was drafted last year by the Hawks and stashed. He might finally get his NBA shot this year."
bostonceltics,3dxuay,cyberklown28,16,Mon Jul 20 12:41:16 2015 UTC,"Dude, we do not fucking need Ty Lawson. I love the guy, but he is not the answer to any of our problems."

bostonceltics,3dxuay,dubbed4lyfe,10,Mon Jul 20 13:00:44 2015 UTC,Isaiah Thomas is on a better contract and we gave up next to nothing for him. I'm perfectly happy with that trade.
bostonceltics,3dxuay,I_Enjoy_Taffy,-2,Mon Jul 20 13:03:27 2015 UTC,Saying getting one of the best playmakers for cheap who makes us instantly better and can be a trade piece going forward is a good thing.

bostonceltics,3dxuay,ThePaddingtonBear,4,Mon Jul 20 14:42:27 2015 UTC,"A 15-10 guy just went to the Rockets for less than what we gave the Suns for IT4.   That makes sense. They're similarly talented. IT wasn't racking up DUIs quicker than he racks up points, he's a year younger, and he makes in four years what Lawson will make in two."
bostonceltics,3dxuay,dangercart,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:19 2015 UTC,We have Marcus Smart and IT4 already plus just drafted another combo-guard. Why would we want to get involved with Lawson? He's staring down a long suspension and is an alcoholic...
bostonceltics,3dxuay,dangercart,4,Mon Jul 20 13:56:58 2015 UTC,"He's now been arrested for three DUIs, plus another car related incident that probably involved alcohol, and also had a domestic abuse charge a few years ago. He's an alcoholic. Do you really want to invest in a 5'11"", 27 year old with substance abuse problems who has never been one of the 40 best players in the league? He's also going to start the season suspended and is due $25M over the next two years. You possibly need to give up a first round pick plus some current talent, if for no other reason than needing to do some salary matching. He plays the same position as your best young player, and possibly your MVP from the past season. This sounds like a good trade target?"

They're only making the trade for tax purposes and the tax is calculated at the end of the season. Crowder also has no reason to force the signing to go through now, though there is some minor risk that a team like the Blazers or Sixers could come in and offer 4/$40M or something and Jae could back out on the deal and sign an offer sheet that would cause issues for the Celtics and cost them quite a bit of money. As long as he's content to wait, the Celtics can wait.  There are a few things still to play out in the market. For one thing, they still could be looking to move Lee to a third team. The other item is that Cleveland haven't re-signed Thompson, Smith or Dellavedova and have until August 1 to move Brendan Haywood's contract before it becomes guaranteed. There are also a handful of other free agents waiting to be signed. There's no reason to lock everything in when there are still moving parts on the market that could create an opportunity for the Celtics to get involved."

Unless there's a trade to be made, all our rookies are going to spend the bulk of their time in D-league.  I fully understand why fans get excited, but they have to remember that while being one of the 30 best amateurs selected this year likely means a player is better than the undrafted d-leaguers making up the majority of summer league competition, it does NOT guarantee the player is good enough to get minutes in the real league full of the best players in the world...     Think about it.  This is a highlight reel of RJ Hunter dropping 22 points in a children's league.  The Spurs started exactly two drafted players.  Kyle Anderson (#30 last year) and Cady Lalanne (taken 55th this year). It's fair expect James Young (taken 17th last year), Terry Rozier (taken 16th this year), RJ Hunter (taken #28 this year) and Jordan Mickey (taken #32 this year) to be better than them... seeing as they were better than them in College (hence why they were drafted ahead of them). And yet Boston still lost.   Mediocre performances in Summer league isn't reason for grand optimism.   Obviously someone HAS to get stats out there... Last year Mike Moser was our 3rd best player (13.6 points, 4.8 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 steals and 1 block per game in 26mpg)... A couple years ago Dionte Christmas outplayed Jared Sullinger on our team by averaging 13 points, 5.3 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.8 steals. Back in 2010, Luke Haroangody was our summerleague superstar... 17 points, 7 rebounds, 1.6 assists.   But getting stats doesn't mean the guy can play against the best players in the world.    Hunter might have a future.  It's foolish to expect him to make an impact this year, though.   Also, while watching him drop 22 points off the bench on 7-14 shooting is exciting, it should be noted that in that very same game undrafted d-leaguer Jonathan Simmons might have been even more impressive for the Spurs (19 points on 7-11 shooting).   I don't expect Jonathan Simmons to get minutes this year either.  Shrug"
bostonceltics,3dsmgj,LarBrd33,2,Sun Jul 19 19:43:00 2015 UTC,"lol you clearly haven't watched one Summer League game with this team. You're basing this guy's future on the stats of a few Summer League games. You must be a real eye for talent.  RJ looks like a five-year vet when compared to everyone else on the basketball court. His BBIQ trumps everyone by far, except Smart, and you can see it in the way he plays. His passing is his best asset, apart from his shooting, and is a more than a capable ball handler. He's surprised all of us on here with his team defense, grabbing steals and disrupting the opponent's offense. While he needs to improve his man defense, that was already expected and is an area he definitely has potential to improve on.  I still can't take you seriously with all these stats. Just for safe measure, let me repeat myself. It's fucking Summer League. You can't base much off this. Even then, most guys who've actually watched the games can agree that RJ has played like a complete pro and has been shining in our last few games, getting better game-by-game.  For example, 2003 Reebok Pro Summer League. In that tournament, LeBron James averaged 15.8 PPG and 7.3 RPG. LeBron was drafted #1 that year as we all know. You know who, going by your logic, was a better player and obviously had greater potential than him? #56 pick, the Boston Celtics' very own, Brandon motherfucking Hunter.  Hunter (Brandon, not RJ) averaged 16.3 PPG and 8.2 RPG, beating LeBron in both areas. You want to know how his career turned out? He played two seasons in the NBA averaging career stats of 3.3 PPG and 2.8 RPG before leaving the US and playing the rest of his career in Europe, while LeBron went on to do what LeBron did.  Stop taking SL stats so seriously. They hardly mean anything."
bostonceltics,3dsmgj,Fruit_Pastilles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:51:37 2015 UTC,"Dude it shouldn't be a surprise that he looks good... he was the 28th picked player this year and he's playing against undrafted scrubs.  If he was playing poorly, it would be alarming.   But unless you're entirely new to the concept of summer league, you should know better than to get excited about a player's performance on that level.  Obviously he can play on that level... he could play on the College level.   Doesn't mean he can play on the NBA level.    Hunter played three years of college basketball.  He averaged 19.7 points, 3.6 assists, 4.7 rebounds, 2.1 steals and 1 block last season.   He was taken #28 in the draft this year.   It shouldn't be surprising that he's holding his own against undrafted d-league players who will never play a minute of real NBA basketball.     He looks like a 5 year vet compared to guys who averaged 6 points in College?  Whoopti-freakin-doo...  Doesn't mean he'll be a rotation player.  Expect to see him in the D-league this year."
bostonceltics,3dsmgj,LarBrd33,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:43:29 2015 UTC,"Look man, my point is going over your head.   Brian Scalabrine was taken in roughly the same range as RJ Hunter (#34 overall in the 2001 draft).  Scalabrine was also a 3 year college player.  Scalabrine's College stats were solid:  18 points, 6 rebounds, 3 assists, 53%/40%/72% (compared to Hunter's 40%/30%/87%) ...  Scal averaged 12 points, 3 rebounds, 2.4 assists on 50%/50%/63% shooting in 5 summer-league games... compared to Hunter's 12 points, 2.8 rebounds, 1.2 assists, 31%/36%/90%  ...   Scal played in like 20 NBA games as a rookie and only played garbage time.  We know what kind of career he had.   Hunter might some day reach Scal's peak, but this year I anticipate seeing him spend most of his time with the Red Claws."
bostonceltics,3dsmgj,LarBrd33,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:01:38 2015 UTC,"My point is clearly going over your head.  STOP.BASING.EVERYTHING.ON.STATS.  There's a difference between being excited for a player and thinking he's going to be a future MVP because of his Summer League performance. We're excited because he's played well in SL and has things that you can't teach. He has an immense feel for the game and smarts. We're not saying he's going to become a multiple time All-Star because of a few SL games, but you don't just lose all your shooting touch going to into the regular season. His shooting alone will keep him on the roster. In fact, if he spends most of the season on a D-League roster, I'll gild you.  Anyway, just stop comparing players. You don't have a fucking clue what you're talking about. You're comparing Scal and RJ's game because their SL stats are somewhat the same. Christ. Watch the games, then come back to me. I'm sick of debating this with you."

Yes he has half a season of NBA experience but the kid is 19 and still one of the youngest players in the entire league. Let's give him some time to develop and not live and die with every shot or poor defensive play (I'm guilty of doing this too, because I really want him to succeed).  • His Trash Brother teammate Hunter's quick release is gorgeous. He seems to always have a positive impact on both ends of the floor with his basketball I.Q., solid defense and playmaking abilities but when he's consistently knocking down those shots (on tough catches, no less) he really shows his full potential and it's very exciting.   • Mickey blocked a dude with his forearm because that's what Jordan Mickey does when you come in the paint! Pay that man his money.   • Rozier is cold blooded! On a less fun note he seems to rely on that speed to a fault which must be tempting when you're that friggin fast and you're all hepped up on spaghetti/sugar/ranch sandwiches but it really gets him into trouble a lot.   • I wish we had a roster spot for Holmes. I think he'll definitely latch on somewhere else, he has a nice skillset.   • I do not wish that for C.J. Fair. Goodbye C.J. Fair, don't let the door hit ya where God split ya.   • That game was extremely entertaining which makes the fact that there's no basketball until October even tougher to swallow.

I don't mind him missing shots in summer league - he showed last year in the D-League he can score at a very high level. But if that's ever going to have value for us he has to show some progress on the defensive end and he didn't do that in this Summer League at all. And that's what has me really worried about his future. Results aren't necessary - progress is necessary and he showed a disturbing lack of progress in understanding the game at the defensive end."
bostonceltics,3drz4k,Copper_Dome,2,Sat Jul 18 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and basketball I.Q./general awareness isn't really something you can teach which is worrisome because he does look lost out there quite often but if he puts the work in I believe he can become at least an adequate defender. He's never gonna be Scottie Pippen but we'll take adequate if he develops into a deadly shooter.   My point was in response to the large number of people I saw writing him off after last season (which was absurd for a barely 19 year old who would and should have been in Maine all year if not for crazy roster turnover) and then getting back on the bandwagon when they heard he gained 15 lbs of muscle and three inches on his vertical and thought he'd come out and dominate the SL and hopped right back off again after a few very poor showings. It's obviously not a great sign that overall he had a very poor SL, I just think it's way, way too early to judge him either way and people just need to be more patient and see how his game progresses rather than being so reactionary (Yes, I know this is the internet and yes more specifically I know this is Reddit but still)."

bostonceltics,3drz4k,Pizzaholic1,4,Sun Jul 19 00:41:46 2015 UTC,I'll be brief: Hunter/Mickey/Rozier.
bostonceltics,3drz4k,bartletfornh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:59:48 2015 UTC,Young?
bostonceltics,3drz4k,Captocommando,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:49:37 2015 UTC,still not nba material
bostonceltics,3drz4k,Pizzaholic1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:41:12 2015 UTC,"Young was pretty bad on defense and his summer league performance as a whole was a huge letdown. I would want Hunter, Mickey, and Rozier on the roster over him (as of now). Though, we'll see what happens in preseason."
bostonceltics,3drz4k,bartletfornh,6,Sun Jul 19 01:46:45 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree, but if we're talking about this game he played well."
bostonceltics,3drz4k,Captocommando,5,Sun Jul 19 01:50:11 2015 UTC,"RJ Hunter and Mickey are the takeaways from this summer league.  Rozier still has a lot to prove as a PG.  Which is fine, we have good PG's already in IT4 and Smart."
bostonceltics,3drz4k,Pizzaholic1,3,Sun Jul 19 00:43:25 2015 UTC,"We stayed close without Smart, that's pretty huge"
bostonceltics,3drz4k,wooandrew42,4,Sat Jul 18 22:11:57 2015 UTC,Smart shouldn;t even be playing. He's too good for this league
bostonceltics,3drz4k,Pizzaholic1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:41:35 2015 UTC,Probably pretty close in summer league performance to Kyle Anderson.
bostonceltics,3drz4k,BQGIE,3,Sun Jul 19 03:45:09 2015 UTC,I WANT MORE GAMES!!
bostonceltics,3drz4k,endubs,3,Sat Jul 18 22:14:04 2015 UTC,The only way a team could beat us at Las Vegas was by buzzer beater
bostonceltics,3drz4k,n4nirvana,2,Sat Jul 18 22:21:44 2015 UTC,At least we didn't lose on the refball.
bostonceltics,3drz4k,Dusclops_in_Bape,2,Sat Jul 18 21:59:40 2015 UTC,internally screaming
bostonceltics,3drz4k,ShoobieDog,2,Sat Jul 18 22:07:14 2015 UTC,Young missed a wiiiide open 3 at the end...Hunter looks way better at the moment. Young is going to end up in the d-league during this season.
bostonceltics,3drz4k,Plan9fromtheAbyss,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:13:39 2015 UTC,"Immediately after missing that 3, he clumsily screened his own teammate on D and allowed the Spurs to shoot a wiiiiiiiiiide open 3 (missed, luckily). It was a big couple of mistakes. That make would have put the Spurs up by 10, I believe, and essentially put the game out of reach. The D-League is probably still the best place for him. I'm hopeful, but Young has a ways to go."
bostonceltics,3drz4k,BQGIE,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:59:41 2015 UTC,"/u/celticmod, your job is to count down days until camp starts now. SL was just the app!"
bostonceltics,3drz4k,arms_room_rat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:43:53 2015 UTC,PreSL I would have not believed that I would have came out most hyped on Mickey & Hunter. Especially seeing as I rode into summer league on the James Young hype train and knowing rozier's speed.
bostonceltics,3drz4k,jceltics,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:24:24 2015 UTC,Having all these young talents compete for a place in the roster is a great thing IMO.
bostonceltics,3drz4k,greece666,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:39:04 2015 UTC,"Spurs, see you in the NBA finals"
bostonceltics,3drz4k,LTBASEDDAWG,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:47:03 2015 UTC,Anyone got a video of the game winning shot from the Spurs?
bostonceltics,3drz4k,Superluigi6,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:15:50 2015 UTC,It's on the NBA's instagram.
bostonceltics,3drz4k,zazagooh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:44:07 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,CelticMod,16,Sat Jul 18 19:13:21 2015 UTC,Young hits first shot  It's okay guys! He's our future again!
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Fruit_Pastilles,14,Sat Jul 18 20:04:38 2015 UTC,If we end up winning summer league I'll eat a Chef Rozier sandwich
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Im_Actually_Drunk,3,Sat Jul 18 20:30:43 2015 UTC,Rozier wants you to eat that sandwich. We will hold you accountable.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,kabob23,11,Sat Jul 18 21:53:26 2015 UTC,Mickey is too good to be true for a 2nd rounder
bostonceltics,3drgjy,wooandrew42,12,Sat Jul 18 20:15:09 2015 UTC,It's official. We need to trade all our Nets' picks for late first rounders/early second rounders. We obviously can't miss pass 25.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,knoblauch,10,Sat Jul 18 20:41:14 2015 UTC,RJ that was straight filthy
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Im_Actually_Drunk,10,Sat Jul 18 20:42:27 2015 UTC,LMFAO ROZIER YOU BEAST.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Natesdurdybball,10,Sat Jul 18 21:51:44 2015 UTC,Young looks the best I've seen him to be honest
bostonceltics,3drgjy,crustman34,9,Sat Jul 18 20:12:09 2015 UTC,Holy shit I'm gonna miss the Celtics. Is it October yet?
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Wayne_Spooney,9,Sat Jul 18 20:41:34 2015 UTC,Marcus Thornton reminds me of a kid who just ate a couple of pixie sticks and then his parents told him to go play outside
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Im_Actually_Drunk,9,Sat Jul 18 21:12:24 2015 UTC,"What's a heat check for RJ, half court?"
bostonceltics,3drgjy,AnthropomorphicAsFck,6,Sat Jul 18 20:39:21 2015 UTC,people play RJ TIGHT. Like ray allen tight. And he's making em pay. That's very promising
bostonceltics,3drgjy,crustman34,6,Sat Jul 18 20:42:14 2015 UTC,"What up, Celtics!  Joining yall for the second half."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Go0n,2,Sat Jul 18 20:58:58 2015 UTC,What you think of Slo mo?
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Natesdurdybball,2,Sat Jul 18 21:06:04 2015 UTC,"He'll likely be Kawhi's backup off the bench this season.  It'll be interesting to see if Manu, Kyle, and Boris can gel in that second unit as they all fit the slow/great passing player mold.  Definitely going to get a lot of minutes this season.  I'm not sure if it's going to work - I like Kyle and his scraggly facial hair but I think a more defensive focused wing would be more useful in that slot."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Go0n,8,Sat Jul 18 21:16:28 2015 UTC,Mickey is a late lottery talent. How did he fall so far
bostonceltics,3drgjy,SirGreyWorm,6,Sat Jul 18 20:40:23 2015 UTC,"Seriously. He is a perfect 4 man in the modern NBA. While he can't shoot threes, you can switch everything with him and he provides some solid rim protection from weak side help. He's good in the pick and roll as well."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Wayne_Spooney,7,Sat Jul 18 20:52:02 2015 UTC,I think that Mickey and Hunter take exception to Simmons tweeting that he's annoyed that we didn't draft Harrell.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,migibb,7,Sat Jul 18 20:42:22 2015 UTC,I'm predicting a James Young Summer League Statement Game.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,migibb,8,Sat Jul 18 19:57:34 2015 UTC,"Oh my fucking God, I love Hunter."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Fruit_Pastilles,6,Sat Jul 18 20:38:28 2015 UTC,most fun summer league team ever
bostonceltics,3drgjy,crustman34,6,Sat Jul 18 20:38:48 2015 UTC,playoff basketball!!!!!
bostonceltics,3drgjy,gdagod100,4,Sat Jul 18 19:36:22 2015 UTC,I'm way too fired up for a summer league game lol
bostonceltics,3drgjy,crustman34,4,Sat Jul 18 20:03:53 2015 UTC,Young is really showing up today. Not only on offense but his defensive footwork has been better than ever
bostonceltics,3drgjy,crustman34,5,Sat Jul 18 20:33:58 2015 UTC,Idk if thats really sportsmanlike to scream at young's ear as he attempted a 3.....
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Natesdurdybball,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:16:07 2015 UTC,i thought the spurs were classy?
bostonceltics,3drgjy,_Juntao,2,Sat Jul 18 21:23:14 2015 UTC,Vegas gets to the best us
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Im_Actually_Drunk,4,Sat Jul 18 21:26:08 2015 UTC,GIVE ROZIER A MAX CONTRACT
bostonceltics,3drgjy,jakefols,5,Sat Jul 18 21:52:19 2015 UTC,WANT SOME SUGAR AND RANCH WITH THAT?????
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Im_Actually_Drunk,4,Sat Jul 18 21:52:24 2015 UTC,Clutch as hell.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Go0n,5,Sat Jul 18 21:52:42 2015 UTC,"Fun, fun game.. good hanging with yall."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Go0n,3,Sat Jul 18 21:55:01 2015 UTC,Let's go Celtics!! Lets go for the flawless Summer League Victory!
bostonceltics,3drgjy,fbreaker,3,Sat Jul 18 19:15:26 2015 UTC,Young is looking more confident
bostonceltics,3drgjy,migibb,4,Sat Jul 18 20:09:09 2015 UTC,It's summer league for the scoreboard too
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Wayne_Spooney,4,Sat Jul 18 20:24:11 2015 UTC,"Mickey blocking shots with his forearm, Hunter and Young splashing threes...  Ahh this is what Summer League is all about"
bostonceltics,3drgjy,wellgroomedmcpoyle,4,Sat Jul 18 20:39:31 2015 UTC,I actually have no gripes with how Young has played today. Very aggressive. Up to the task of defending Anderson. Engaged. Pleasantly surprised.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Natesdurdybball,4,Sat Jul 18 21:01:25 2015 UTC,Why do none of the commentators in any of the Summer Leagues remember we were the 7 seed?
bostonceltics,3drgjy,wellgroomedmcpoyle,2,Sat Jul 18 21:02:13 2015 UTC,"lol. Noticed that, too."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Natesdurdybball,4,Sat Jul 18 21:04:49 2015 UTC,Pretty good game for summer league.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Natesdurdybball,4,Sat Jul 18 21:40:48 2015 UTC,Every draft you are lucky to get 1 good player.  Last year we got Smart.  This year we got Mickey and Hunter.  Both look NBA ready.  Rozier has much much to work to do.  He's been average at best all SL
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Pizzaholic1,3,Sat Jul 18 21:48:55 2015 UTC,they're  having a lot of trouble with that scoreboard
bostonceltics,3drgjy,_Juntao,3,Sat Jul 18 20:21:21 2015 UTC,Finally some solid d there from Young
bostonceltics,3drgjy,arms_room_rat,3,Sat Jul 18 20:33:50 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, RJ... what a three..."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,AlexCosta,3,Sat Jul 18 20:38:19 2015 UTC,MICKEY AND HUNTER OH MYYYYY
bostonceltics,3drgjy,SlayonPop,3,Sat Jul 18 20:38:21 2015 UTC,I love our rookies
bostonceltics,3drgjy,migibb,3,Sat Jul 18 20:38:29 2015 UTC,That sequence getting me hyped

bostonceltics,3drgjy,fbreaker,3,Sat Jul 18 20:38:41 2015 UTC,RJ FROM DEEP!
bostonceltics,3drgjy,brucenasty,3,Sat Jul 18 20:38:50 2015 UTC,not a good showing from Rozier
bostonceltics,3drgjy,crustman34,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:02:22 2015 UTC,It's like he's too fast even for himself. Dribbles himself into trouble alot.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Natesdurdybball,3,Sat Jul 18 21:05:26 2015 UTC,Thorton clearly can't play anything besides iso. Couldn't get the ball to Mickey on the pick and slide play.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Natesdurdybball,3,Sat Jul 18 21:12:32 2015 UTC,I never thought summer league refs could piss me off so much
bostonceltics,3drgjy,crustman34,3,Sat Jul 18 21:18:26 2015 UTC,"On a positive note, I played NBA 2K5 earlier today and was absolutely balling with Raef LaFrentz"
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Im_Actually_Drunk,3,Sat Jul 18 21:27:23 2015 UTC,well im shuting the fuck up now.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,briancarnage,3,Sat Jul 18 21:40:24 2015 UTC,That was a crazy few possessions.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Whydidideletemyaccou,3,Sat Jul 18 21:43:03 2015 UTC,Holy shit. Wtf does Rozier have to do to get a foul call. He's had two in the fourth that were straight robberies.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Wafflecone416,3,Sat Jul 18 21:45:43 2015 UTC,I'm actually getting nervous over a summer leagues game
bostonceltics,3drgjy,SlayonPop,3,Sat Jul 18 21:46:08 2015 UTC,maaaaaan weak call
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Smokinondatgas,3,Sat Jul 18 21:47:52 2015 UTC,"Weak foul call, let em play ref!"
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Go0n,3,Sat Jul 18 21:48:04 2015 UTC,OH MY GOD!!!!!
bostonceltics,3drgjy,SlayonPop,3,Sat Jul 18 21:51:44 2015 UTC,Rozier is cold blooded!
bostonceltics,3drgjy,wellgroomedmcpoyle,3,Sat Jul 18 21:51:50 2015 UTC,HOLY ROZIER!!!!!!!!!!!!
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Whydidideletemyaccou,3,Sat Jul 18 21:51:50 2015 UTC,WOW!!!!!!!!
bostonceltics,3drgjy,briancarnage,3,Sat Jul 18 21:51:52 2015 UTC,OH MY SHIT

bostonceltics,3drgjy,crustman34,3,Sat Jul 18 21:52:40 2015 UTC,Wow. Good shit SA.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Natesdurdybball,3,Sat Jul 18 21:53:43 2015 UTC,Great Summer League overall. It will be fun to see these guys develop in the NBA. Nothing to be disappointed by.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,kabob23,3,Sat Jul 18 21:55:41 2015 UTC,FUUUUUUCK!! That's the worst way to lose.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,CelticsPatsRedSox,2,Sat Jul 18 21:57:35 2015 UTC,I legitimatly want to win the summer league really badly
bostonceltics,3drgjy,wooandrew42,2,Sat Jul 18 19:20:15 2015 UTC,Anyone know where I could listen to the game on mobile? Thanks!
bostonceltics,3drgjy,ariler,2,Sat Jul 18 19:51:16 2015 UTC,"wait they just showed Young was 20, I thought he was 19?"
bostonceltics,3drgjy,edwardsamson,5,Sat Jul 18 20:04:37 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he doesn't turn 20 until August
bostonceltics,3drgjy,migibb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:06:12 2015 UTC,"He is 19. They just got lazy. ""Born in 95? Probably 20"""

bostonceltics,3drgjy,fbreaker,2,Sat Jul 18 20:11:31 2015 UTC,That was mighty impressive spin move by Mickey.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,knoblauch,2,Sat Jul 18 20:16:15 2015 UTC,LMAO they have the scores switched it says SA 16 BOS 22 when its really the other way around.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,edwardsamson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:20:26 2015 UTC,clocks arent moving either? wtf?
bostonceltics,3drgjy,edwardsamson,2,Sat Jul 18 20:21:06 2015 UTC,RJ for threeeeeee
bostonceltics,3drgjy,mrjlodge12,2,Sat Jul 18 20:21:08 2015 UTC,They have the scores backwards on NBA TV i think
bostonceltics,3drgjy,mrjlodge12,2,Sat Jul 18 20:21:29 2015 UTC,So what's with all this hype about the spurs dominating next year?
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Im_Actually_Drunk,2,Sat Jul 18 20:26:12 2015 UTC,They gon b gud
bostonceltics,3drgjy,mrjlodge12,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:27:26 2015 UTC,lolsummerleague  Literally none of the Spurs core players are playing. That's ridiculous to think this team is a preview of the Spurs next season.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Fruit_Pastilles,2,Sat Jul 18 20:31:03 2015 UTC,"I should've put a /s, was trying to make a shitty joke"
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Im_Actually_Drunk,2,Sat Jul 18 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"Damn, Young is impressing me. Great lob."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Fruit_Pastilles,2,Sat Jul 18 20:29:29 2015 UTC,OH SNAP yet another sick Young -> Mickey lob
bostonceltics,3drgjy,edwardsamson,2,Sat Jul 18 20:29:32 2015 UTC,Young going for the Lob City Passer badge.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,knoblauch,2,Sat Jul 18 20:29:42 2015 UTC,love seeing Mickey run the floor and love seeing Young find him
bostonceltics,3drgjy,crustman34,2,Sat Jul 18 20:29:49 2015 UTC,"YES finally, Jam3$ Young is here"
bostonceltics,3drgjy,fbreaker,2,Sat Jul 18 20:33:16 2015 UTC,People crawling back on the James Young bandwagon
bostonceltics,3drgjy,wellgroomedmcpoyle,2,Sat Jul 18 20:33:25 2015 UTC,The James Young hype train picking up steam yet again!
bostonceltics,3drgjy,_Dr_Jan_Itor,2,Sat Jul 18 20:34:51 2015 UTC,What a great sequence
bostonceltics,3drgjy,xSinful,2,Sat Jul 18 20:38:32 2015 UTC,Mickey and Hunter are playing their hearts out. Young already having his best game ever as well.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,wooandrew42,2,Sat Jul 18 20:40:56 2015 UTC,Best game out of the 3. He had some great D-League games last season
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Cmarksthespot,2,Sat Jul 18 20:41:39 2015 UTC,"damn, marcus Thornton is always in attack mode"
bostonceltics,3drgjy,fbreaker,2,Sat Jul 18 20:44:39 2015 UTC,"I'm just starting to imagine our All-Hair Team potential with Kelly, Bae, and Thornton"
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Im_Actually_Drunk,2,Sat Jul 18 20:48:26 2015 UTC,Thornton is streaky as fuck
bostonceltics,3drgjy,wooandrew42,2,Sat Jul 18 20:50:03 2015 UTC,"Young needs to take it down the lane and rip it, instead of the floater"
bostonceltics,3drgjy,migibb,2,Sat Jul 18 21:02:05 2015 UTC,Lmao at that Karl/Boogie handshake. Couldn't get anymore awkward.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Natesdurdybball,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:08:49 2015 UTC,Many assholes were clenched watching that footage.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Fruit_Pastilles,2,Sat Jul 18 21:14:16 2015 UTC,Maybe Coach Karl should shut the hell up about his 24 year old franchise center with 4 years left on his deal.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,wellgroomedmcpoyle,2,Sat Jul 18 21:09:36 2015 UTC,ugh come on I don't want to lose
bostonceltics,3drgjy,crustman34,2,Sat Jul 18 21:10:15 2015 UTC,"This has been our worst quarter of summer league so far... 1 point, SMH..."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Cmarksthespot,2,Sat Jul 18 21:10:29 2015 UTC,That call was ATROCIOUS!
bostonceltics,3drgjy,xzakit,2,Sat Jul 18 21:12:20 2015 UTC,This is horrible
bostonceltics,3drgjy,wooandrew42,2,Sat Jul 18 21:16:19 2015 UTC,Kyle Anderson plays like a YMCA MVP. He's been playing really well this summer
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Im_Actually_Drunk,2,Sat Jul 18 21:16:38 2015 UTC,WHY DO WE FOUL 3 POINT SHOOTERS! Basic level basketball... Smh
bostonceltics,3drgjy,xzakit,2,Sat Jul 18 21:23:17 2015 UTC,That probably wasn't a foul but I'll take it
bostonceltics,3drgjy,migibb,2,Sat Jul 18 21:23:40 2015 UTC,Two quarters in a row Hunter's got the last second shooting foul cheese
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Im_Actually_Drunk,2,Sat Jul 18 21:24:16 2015 UTC,Smart play by Hunter to get those free throws.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Go0n,2,Sat Jul 18 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"That's a ridiculous foul call, but I'll take it."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,dangercart,2,Sat Jul 18 21:25:06 2015 UTC,these 3 shots are getting annoying
bostonceltics,3drgjy,briancarnage,2,Sat Jul 18 21:29:08 2015 UTC,"smarts always got the backpack on, i really want someone to ask him during an interview."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,briancarnage,2,Sat Jul 18 21:30:57 2015 UTC,smart whispering words of wisdom
bostonceltics,3drgjy,crustman34,2,Sat Jul 18 21:32:22 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, we have inside defense"
bostonceltics,3drgjy,fbreaker,2,Sat Jul 18 21:32:50 2015 UTC,"Three important Spurs to watch out for:   Kyle Anderson - Probably Kawhi's backup this season. Jonathan Simmons - Hyper-athletic guard, signed by Spurs. Cady Lalanne - Spurs 2nd rounder, may be called up this season.   Any notable Celtics out there?  I recognize Hunter and Rozier but not anyone else."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Go0n,3,Sat Jul 18 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"jordan mickey, kids doing great so far imo."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,briancarnage,3,Sat Jul 18 21:35:06 2015 UTC,"Jordan Mickey is a 6'9"" shot blocking PF drafted 33rd who should make the team. James Young was drafted 17th in 2014 and was very good in the D-League and very bad in the NBA last year. He's still the youngest person on the Summer League squad even though he has a year of NBA experience. Jonathan Holmes might catch on with an NBA team at some point, but not the Celtics.  Marcus Smart was by far the best player on the SL team but got injured."
bostonceltics,3drgjy,dangercart,2,Sat Jul 18 21:40:41 2015 UTC,I think yall would have won this game pretty easily if you still had Smart.  Very strong group yall have here.  I'm a big fan of Hunter.
bostonceltics,3drgjy,Go0n,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:43:46 2015 UTC,You are always welcome here.

bostonceltics,3dsu3d,LemurFevur,3,Mon Jul 20 14:46:59 2015 UTC,Have you looked into half season tickets? They're about 5 bucks more per game.   IMO it's easier to sell at face value to friends/fam a few times to cover 21/22 games in a season than to take a loss on 15 games from the full season ticket.
bostonceltics,3dsu3d,schmuckopotamus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:18:34 2015 UTC,Where do you buy season tickets?

bostonceltics,3drrp3,chivestheconquerer,19,Sat Jul 18 20:51:00 2015 UTC,RJ Hunter and it won't be close.
bostonceltics,3drrp3,KevinOConnorNBA,7,Sat Jul 18 23:48:46 2015 UTC,"100% agree. This guy's skill set was made for Stephens' system. He's going to carve himself out a very nice niche by mid-season. By next year, he'll be a starter."
bostonceltics,3drrp3,mister_impossible,12,Sun Jul 19 04:35:37 2015 UTC,I think it will be Mickey. He's the only real shot blocker on the roster and he's probably our best athlete in terms of big men. Hopefully he gets maybe 8 minutes a night.
bostonceltics,3drrp3,adodgybloke,3,Sat Jul 18 21:22:57 2015 UTC,"Amir and Zeller might swallow up those rim protector minutes. Mickey might only get minutes next year if KO, Sully, Zeller, Lee, or Amir are traded during the season."

bostonceltics,3drrp3,cyberklown28,4,Sat Jul 18 22:47:23 2015 UTC,Gotta be hunter because stevens makes him team shoot lots of 3s and Hunter might be the only good 3 point shooter outside of maybe bradley (Olynyk's 35% is about league average). Hunter is gonna get a lot of shots probably
bostonceltics,3drrp3,OrangeKookie,6,Sat Jul 18 23:41:44 2015 UTC,"Only way Rozier gets any minutes is if AB is traded, which I'm in favor of. If that happens he has a nice season. Mickey is at a really crowded PF position. Can he rebound and block better than Amir Johnson. Can he score better than David Lee or Sully? It'll be tough for him to find minutes without a trade of Sully/Olynyk. Perhaps Hunter really is NBA ready and can set himself apart with his shooting and earn some minutes. Mainly though it'll be tough for any of these rooks to get much playing time with the roster constructed as it is now."

bostonceltics,3drrp3,BrandonIngramGOAT,-3,Sat Jul 18 22:06:00 2015 UTC,"I will say Mickey, but just because he will probably get the most minutes because of his skill set. RJ is going to be defensive liability for a while."
bostonceltics,3dsrm7,BeefCat10,8,Sun Jul 19 02:38:29 2015 UTC,"He's almost definitely going to be playing overseas for at least a year or two.  Our roster is just too crowded.  But personally I really like his game.  He's got good enough length for a PG, incredible athleticism, and he's a great shooter.  Good enough handles and if he can improve his passing game overseas he could be a great backup point guard some day."
bostonceltics,3dsrm7,endubs,4,Sun Jul 19 02:57:16 2015 UTC,From what I saw he seemed more like an undersized 2 to me. Do you think he's more valuable to a team if he can become a better player as a PG?
bostonceltics,3dsrm7,migibb,0,Sun Jul 19 02:59:54 2015 UTC,"As a 2 he's probably limited to being a bench scorer, unless he develops to a Monta or AI level. Undersized scoring 2s are tough to fit a lineup around.  His shooting ability and athleticism suggest that the framework is there to be a decent player in the future."
bostonceltics,3dsrm7,arms_room_rat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:03:08 2015 UTC,"I like his game. He's good with the ball in his hands and is a crazy athletic freak, but he also needs a ridiculous amount of polishing.  It would probably be best if he played overseas in Spain or Turkey where there is some decent professional competition for a couple seasons."
bostonceltics,3dsrm7,pseudojewboy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:21:22 2015 UTC,"He's one of the fastest dudes I have ever seen play basketball, but I don't see him being in the NBA until he improves his vision and passing and BB IQ.

bostonceltics,3dsrm7,papi617,3,Sun Jul 19 03:02:09 2015 UTC,I personally thought it would have almost been in his best interest to go undrafted as opposed to getting picked by a team like the Celtics who is saturated with guards. Thanks for the response.
bostonceltics,3dnfql,jdl11213,17,Fri Jul 17 18:16:07 2015 UTC,"Great stuff. We all have our favorites and you could do a lot worse than rooting for Phil Pressey. It will seem strange not to have someone scrapping to stay in the league at the end of the bench. Even Jordan Mickey and Perry Jones (or whoever is our 15th guy when the season actually starts) will almost certainly be on a guaranteed contract. Phil has had multiple days where he probably woke up unsure if he'd still have an NBA career that afternoon. It feels like he'll have a Kevin Ollie style career as a professional 13th man and, maybe, he'll get that one shining run where the stars align and he gets to show what he can do. Like Ollie, it wouldn't surprise me if he ends up in coaching, maybe even in Maine or back with the Celtics to start. Before that, there are teams he could help.  The thing is... he's not as bad as I always joke. He's basically the definition of replacement level and, unlike a lot of the other players who are that, he understands what that means. He's not like Ben Gordon who may not realize he's terrible any more. He'll never be Dion Waiters who doesn't realize he's always been a negative on the court. Phil has been hanging on since Day 1 and the result is that he's now a perfectly adequate third PG who can steward a team through 5-10 minutes without screwing up, and who understands that even if he has a great 10 minutes his role the next game might be cheerleading. He's a literal 0.0 VOPR (value over replacement) last season because he's replacement level making replacement pay playing a replacement role. That's cool; lots of teams have 10 productive players and would do well with 3-4 replacement level guys. It just turns out that this year, the Celtics probably have 12-13 guys better than replacement, and the rest have guaranteed deals.  If Phil goes overseas it will be because players like him thrive in Europe and can make a good paycheck. If he wants to stay in the NBA, there should be teams ready to sign him up. It's too bad we don't have space for him now but I also suspect he'll be back in Boston some day."
bostonceltics,3dnfql,dangercart,12,Fri Jul 17 19:19:58 2015 UTC,"This might be my favorite post ever on this sub. It's well-written, emotional, & introspective while still maintaining some rationality. I made fun of your Pressey flag-waving more than once over the past two years but I was secretly a little jealous. Connecting with the guys who do the little things to pull the team together is rare, but luckily this is a team that finds those guys over and over. I'm willing to bet that one of these guys you mentioned is going to give you quite a bit of joy this year, even if it doesn't exactly fit the same hole that Phil Pressey left."

Its like we got use to rondo pounding and making that one perfect pass at the end of the possession, then Pressy would come in and the ball would zing around the perimeter, and our pick and roll game would gain steam.   Seriously of all the players you listed I will miss Pressy the most. He embodied what it meant to be a Celtic and playing for the team."
bostonceltics,3dnfql,SCS22,2,Fri Jul 17 22:26:40 2015 UTC,"absolutely this.  the team would be down by 10-15 and then Pressey would come in and do his thing and the celtics would make a run.  i'm sure there's some selective memory at work here, and he's not a messiah as evidenced by his stats (far from it) but i watch every game, and i also distinctly remember this happening a lot."
bostonceltics,3dnfql,hipcheck23,2,Sat Jul 18 14:34:23 2015 UTC,"Great article. I loved rooting for the little guy.   I want to add something to the overall tenet you put forward, which is that ownership is also paramount. Taking sucks, but perhaps it's just the only way those idiots feel they can do the right thing for their fans? I won't apologize for them... But there are a lot of teams that are owned by megalomaniacs who don't give the slightest crap about their fans, never mind the players. Or coaches. Or peanut vendors.   The Celts and Pats have really good ownership, it's a huge deal. I've seen up close what some of these teams are like - the Clippers and Oilers and Redskins and Dodgers, at times, have been abhorrent.

Does anybody have any articles or interviews that shed some real light on the relationships between players? Like I saw Wallace as an influence on these young guys, but have there been any interviews where C's guys are like yeah Gerald's been really helpful?  Edit: I was just on r/nba and saw the post about Evan Turner saying Gerald Wallace yelled at them for not playing defense. Anyone got anymore?"
bostonceltics,3dnfql,SRoku,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:17:13 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure I read an article when Rondo was still trying to get his knee back to 100% that Crash and a couple guys from the team to stay after practice to scrimmage with Rondo so he could get some reps in. Not sure the source for this though, but the article was from about January/February 2014 I think."

Way too many bricked 3s and turnovers. But I'll miss him for his crazy assists and steals that gave the celtics momentum in games.

bostonceltics,3dnfql,OrangeKookie,2,Fri Jul 17 22:13:20 2015 UTC,"Are you serious... Rondo at his prime could score during drives, had a solid mid range jumper, barely took 3s, was an all-nba defender, was the best rebounding pg in the league, and a triple double machine while being able to do what pressey did at an EXTREMELY larger scale. Pressey got the occasional steals but he couldn't shoot or score for life. 2010 rondo vs the cavs and magic is still my fondest memory of the celtics when boston were counted out both rounds but won handily. Idk what you're talking about."

bostonceltics,3do8vn,arms_room_rat,3,Fri Jul 17 22:16:29 2015 UTC,Like the NFL get a rookie wage scale.
bostonceltics,3do8vn,Washington_Fitz,2,Fri Jul 17 22:54:17 2015 UTC,Well why would it be addressed? It's a huge gamble for the player betting on themselves. And it's not like other guys make less money because of it. Do you mean from the ownership side?
bostonceltics,3do8vn,Sneezus_Christ,12,Fri Jul 17 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"It seems unfair from the team perspective that second rounders can only be locked up for a year when first rounders get a set contract.  The team spent a pick on the player, but the player can just sign for a year then walk?"
bostonceltics,3do8vn,arms_room_rat,3,Fri Jul 17 22:51:03 2015 UTC,"Well I wasn't trying to attract such a negative reaction here, by let me explain. His being able to decline the four year is his gamble, but it allows him the opportunity to make more money, so if I were a player I would never negotiate a means for players to make less money. So from the players side it doesn't make sense. I could see owners arguing that the right to gamble that makes second rounders less valuable but this is the extreme minority, almost a non issue for most teams. That is why I post that question. But you guys are brutal here Jesus."
bostonceltics,3do8vn,Sneezus_Christ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:54:43 2015 UTC,"Well devils advocate here, they could have spent a first round pick on him which would have paid him more and guaranteed his salary."

bostonceltics,3do8vn,stonedasawhoreiniran,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:17:17 2015 UTC,How could you know he makes 4x more if he hasn't signed a contract yet?
bostonceltics,3do8vn,WKWA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:57:08 2015 UTC,I was projecting based on RJ's first round slotted amount and the rookie minimum which is what the qualifying offer is for.
bostonceltics,3do8vn,stonedasawhoreiniran,2,Sat Jul 18 16:37:04 2015 UTC,Then if I was a fringe first rounder wouldn't it make more sense to try to lower your stock by a little to be able to cash out earlier?
bostonceltics,3do8vn,papi617,2,Fri Jul 17 22:48:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but you get guaranteed money as a first. It's a gamble."
bostonceltics,3do8vn,Sneezus_Christ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:55:12 2015 UTC,"Right, it already makes more sense for fringe second rounders to lower their stock so they become free agents."
bostonceltics,3do8vn,christea,4,Sat Jul 18 00:34:17 2015 UTC,"I disagree. It's nice if you're a second rounder overperforming like Mickey, but a first round pick also gives players a 2 year guarantee, where as a second round pick who isn't playing well probably won't get signed at all.   Risk vs stability."
bostonceltics,3do8vn,mgfist,2,Sat Jul 18 00:49:06 2015 UTC,"It's not a big gamble when compared to being locked up for four years on a nonguaranteed contract. It's actually less of a gamble. If you take the one year deal, you're gambling that you'll be healthy and productive for one year, which will get you another, better contract. If you take the standard four year, nonguaranteed deal, you're gambling that you'll be healthy and productive for FOUR years before you can get a legit contract."
bostonceltics,3do8vn,BQGIE,3,Fri Jul 17 23:17:26 2015 UTC,Well wouldn't the numbers say that it takes on average more than one year to blossom or adjust to the league? You have to perform very quickly if you take the one year. If a guy is sure he's better than I guess it's less of a gamble but a few years of exposure under contract could give you time. That's all.
bostonceltics,3do8vn,Sneezus_Christ,30,Sat Jul 18 04:57:37 2015 UTC,"This was my point when people on this thread (pre-draft, speculating about trades and so forth) kept saying that pick 28 isn't that valuable, and that it's even worse than pick 33. Expect fewer Chandler Parsons style rookie deals for 2nd rounders and more like KJ McDaniels, making late 1st rounders more valuable than popular opinion would have you believe.  edit: go ahead and downvote me, I was right"
bostonceltics,3do8vn,BQGIE,5,Fri Jul 17 23:12:20 2015 UTC,Upvoted you back to normal. :)
bostonceltics,3do8vn,cyberklown28,2,Sat Jul 18 00:45:25 2015 UTC,depends on your agenda.  the league wants 2nds to be non-guaranteed b/c they don't want to take on 55 new contracts/year.    the vast majority of players don't make it in the nba and there's value in not having to commit to a guy who's not working out.    if the talent gap between 28 and 33 is negligible then not being obligated to commit salary and roster space is what most teams would prefer.

bostonceltics,3dmd53,I_Enjoy_Taffy,17,Fri Jul 17 13:09:29 2015 UTC,Thank god. The way he was screaming had me terrified.
bostonceltics,3dmd53,papi617,6,Fri Jul 17 14:27:23 2015 UTC,"As much as I love him, Marcus sure does like to yell. I remember him screaming bloody murder after spraining his ankle last season."
bostonceltics,3dmd53,knoblauch,5,Fri Jul 17 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"Based on the interviews - his ankle/lower leg weren't fully healthy for the rest of the season. Not sure calling that a standard ankle sprain is doing it justice - big difference between grade 1, 2, 3 sprains and a lot of variance as far damage to surrounding tissues (including bone). Also his hand looked ***** up. Anyway, I think he's a tough mother, I give him the full benefit of the doubt."
bostonceltics,3dmd53,EddieLux,2,Fri Jul 17 22:38:41 2015 UTC,I never called it a run of the mill sprain. And Paul George didn't scream like that after snapping his leg. I'm not saying Smart isn't tough or these injuries aren't painful. I'm saying Start is exceptionally vocal about pain.
bostonceltics,3dmd53,knoblauch,3,Fri Jul 17 22:51:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Paul George even felt that injury at first, I wouldn't be surprised if adrenaline and shock didn't let him feel that for a while."

bostonceltics,3dmd53,arms_room_rat,2,Fri Jul 17 16:38:48 2015 UTC,"The medical term for it is an open dislocation if you want to google it and learn more. Or it could just be a laceration from the floor itself, not necessarily from the bone."

If the imaging was done at the arena they're probably not ultra high-end imaging machines with the kind of resolution you'd get at a hospital. They might be limited in the views they can take by the pain Marcus was in also. Finally, chances are there isn't a radiologist at the arena so they're being read by team docs who are generally orthopedists (though they might be able to send them to a radiologist for an immediate read). I'd imagine by this point today they've gotten better films."

He talked about how his mom used to make a lot of spaghetti growing up because it was cheap and they didn't have a lot of money to work with.

He wants the ball and he doesn't play scared. I'm pretty excited to have him.

He's still 19 so he has time to figure it out but when the regular season starts I'll feel much more comfortable with Hunter on the floor than Young
