Dreadlocks,3e3pge,deathnate4,2,Tue Jul 21 18:44:37 2015 UTC,"are the sections square? if theyre long and rectangular theres your problem. otherwise try palm rolling them while theyre wet, it usually makes them a bit more malleable."
Dreadlocks,3e3pge,browndog12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:46 2015 UTC,"My sections are very irregular, some are rectangular, yes. I'm not sure how they ended up like that though."
Dreadlocks,3e3pge,browndog12,2,Wed Jul 22 03:39:51 2015 UTC,Flat sections make flat locs is about as simple as it gets. Ripping them from the root up is actually not as bad as it sounds and is the easiest quick fix for it.

Dreadlocks,3e3pge,laurenkk,2,Tue Jul 21 20:16:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I had some that were fairly flat, but after shrinkage and two years in, they're all round unless the section was too rectangular."

Dreadlocks,3e3pge,IsaacaasI,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:40:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not too familiar with textured hair but Palm rolling like some playdoh helps my flat dreads stay in shape. Just place your dread between your palms and gently roll back and forth. You will have to do this quite often to get results, but I would just add it to your daily life and do it whenever your hands are free. A long term solution would be adding a round bead to the loc. You could also use a string wrap. Once they are in, all the hair growing into the dread will have a nice round shape, but it won't help too much with hair that's already grown."
Dreadlocks,3e4u5a,WastelandsWanderer,2,Tue Jul 21 23:35:22 2015 UTC,"""No heavy buildup"" doesn't mean there isn't ""light buildup"". ;-)  The vast majority of commercial shampoos made for brushable hair aren't suitable for dreads. Not necessarily because of residue, but also because they're too moisturizing.  Doing the baking soda / ACV wash is great for baby dreads (and preparing for dreads). And it's cheap!"
Dreadlocks,3e4u5a,knottysleeves,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:22:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the French. I tried to wrap my head around it, but just didn't get it, although it seems legit at first glance, I can't confirm. I will say that it might be a good idea to read the ingredients and see what they are, or try testing it out first and see if you can detect any leftovers in your hair before putting yourself through a lot of frustration.  Also, some bar soaps work really well if you make a lather, and you use a drying kind. Look for organic black soap or something similar."
Dreadlocks,3e4u5a,anwarhahj,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:07:06 2015 UTC,Got a trader Joe's nearby? I use their tea tree tingle shampoo. Or just do baking soda and apple cider vinegar rinces.

Dreadlocks,3e0l4c,stolesomechopsticks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:20:39 2015 UTC,how long?  Because I bought a Lush bar of Squeaky Green on the 17th of June and I only wash my hair once a week and it seems to have shrunk to half it's size. I dry the soap after use and store it in the tin away from the shower.   I guess it could be due to me being super vigorous when I wash my dreads.

My hair is squeaky clean, it doesn't get oily for days but doesn't feel dried out and I've had no dandruff or itchyness.   I've tried Dr Bonners, Knotty Boy, Kiss My Face and probably a couple others here and there, I know this sub tends towards recommending more all-natural type products but I guess whatever combination of hair, skin and water I have makes the cheap drugstore shampoo work for me!"

Dreadlocks,3e0l4c,Lafingas,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:28:53 2015 UTC,I advise trying BS ACV. Just make a paste with the baking soda and make a 1-4 acv/water mix to rinse with. This makes my hair look by far the best and keeps it from being greasy looking for a week or more.  Most products for dreads dry too much for me.
Dreadlocks,3e0l4c,thirtytwoflavors,2,Tue Jul 21 07:14:16 2015 UTC,"You wash with a BS paste?  I've always diluted the BS in very warm/hot water, gave it a soak, rinsed, then mixed the ACV with water to do a conditioning rinse.  If I'm not careful to dilute the BS well and do the AC rinse really well I have noticed residue of the BS.  So how do you use the paste without leaving residue?"
Dreadlocks,3e0l4c,Lafingas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"I guess I am just good at the rinse, i never seem to have an issue with left over BS after my ACV. i don't do a water rinse in between BS and  ACV."
Dreadlocks,3dyi7b,unidentifies,6,Mon Jul 20 15:56:55 2015 UTC,"It depends on what accessory. I leave most of them in, I take out this little glass jar that has rocks in it so that it doesn't get wet inside, and I take out my 5  inch carved bone feather, cuz that thing is just too big. I don't do it to protect my dreads, I do it to protect my jewelry. After a washing, I might adjust some beads, or move them around just to kind of shape my dreads. (Fix kinks, round them out etc.)"

Dreadlocks,3dyi7b,lemonbarn,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:20:38 2015 UTC,"Idk, I don't really have a routine. I do occasionally push my cuticles back, and round out any sharp edges with a glass file on the sides as they are growing out. I try not to have any sharp angles that will chip, kinda taper them so they are wider closer to the base of my nails. Stay away from sandpaper files. They always break as they get about as long as the part that's attached to the flesh. Idk what it's called."

Dreadlocks,3dyi7b,traginus,2,Mon Jul 20 16:00:18 2015 UTC,I recently wrapped a few of my dreads with embroidery floss and I haven't taken that out before washing. I do take out my beads though if I'm wearing any. I change out my dread jewelry pretty much every day (apart from the wraps) so taking things out before washing is no big deal.

Dreadlocks,3e0e08,NDNguitarguy,5,Tue Jul 21 00:06:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think extensions are going to work in your case, because you don't have enough hair length. Extensions need to be attached to a solid foundation -- short baby dreads can't support that kind of weight. Plus your own dreads won't be able to lock up on their own, because the weight of the extension will keep pulling the roots.  This goes double if you're going to washing them often, tying them back constantly, and getting them pulled at & grabbed during grappling. All that movement will put extra stress on the attachment points.  Better to wait until your hair is much longer, or starting dreads now and waiting for them to mature (a year or more) before trying to add extensions."
Dreadlocks,3e0e08,knottysleeves,2,Tue Jul 21 00:46:02 2015 UTC,"Alright, guess I'll just have to keep putting up with my hair until it gets much longer. Then I'll start the process. Thanks for the help I really appreciate it!"

For a while there, I was washing twice a week, but the sweat problem isn't as serious as one might think.  A simple headband or bandana could be an easy solution to dreads getting in the way. I made a bandana to keep it out of the way when I need it and it works like a charm."
Dreadlocks,3e0e08,gensyms,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:34:37 2015 UTC,Is there a way I can prevent extensions from falling out?   Absolutely!  Extensions you don't have cannot fall out.  Kinda like how you can't fall off the floor.   how would I go about keeping them clean while training 5x a week?   Wash your hair a couple times per week.

Dreadlocks can be very emotionally trying so getting dreads when you're already depressed could be disastrous to your sense of wellbeing.  But I'll bet you'll look wonderful with dreads.

They will tighten up over time-- you're looking at about a month of your hair looking like that, followed by a couple months of them starting to look like actual dreads, followed by months and months of loops! Mature dreads are ones that are at least 1 year old, and even then you might not be super happy with them til they are even older.   But yep, they look how they are supposed to at 12 hours old or whatever. If you have rubber bands in (doesn't look like you do), take them out. Learn to palm-roll early if you want neater hair.

If you just use a towel to dry em out in between washes im pretty sure its gonna be fine. Just wash 2-3 times a week and do a maybe once or twice a month deep cleanse. Experiment with it! I do a deep cleanse once a month and i find its not as dirty as i originally thought it would be when i look at the results. You gotta be hygeinic but dont forget over washing dreads isnt that good for em...also man i use to be one of those dudes who would shower every single day, including shampoo. Well yeah, you can train your body to not feel as gross. I remember reading somewhere human beings are supposed to shower every other day to every two days; being that it's the proper amount of time your body uses the sebum before you refresh the process. Its what i follow and i dont get any complaints. I did go passed that and went 5 days once cause i was lazy on vacation, which is probably the only time i got a complaint."
Dreadlocks,3dt2gs,supfaggot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:51:08 2015 UTC,I had T&R dreads that I did myself and I started washing them like 2 days after I started them and I was relatively aggressive with drying and they seemed to do better that way. When drying just shake as much water out as possible then use a towel. That is they best way to make sure they don't undo with a towel

I either tie my dreads in a bun or in a ponytail for the workouts that I know I'll be getting sweaty from.

Maybe your hair smells good? lol i'm not sure. It sounds like dreadlocks may suit you and perhaps you are more attractive with them to your bf, as opposed to your previous hairstyle.  Edit: here is an askscience thread about whether or not humans can ""smell"" pheromones. http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/y4j1a/what_exactly_are_pheromones_can_we_actually_smell/"

Dreadlocks,3dsla7,gensyms,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:10:37 2015 UTC,"What I gathered from that thread about whether we can smell pheromones is that it may not technically be pheromones -- but rather, differences in the major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-II), which are genes that are directly responsible for our adaptive immunity.  So a person's scent does carry indicators that signal sexual compatibility in terms of how well a baby's immune system would work.  But those indicators may not technically be pheromones.    Still, the word ""pheromone"" rolls off the tongue way easier than ""differences in our major histocompatibility complexes""."

Dreadlocks,3dr2q8,123imAwesome,3,Sun Jul 19 00:21:40 2015 UTC,"THIS, so much.  I've been through 2 sets of 6+ years each. Change, renewal and growth are all good & positive things IMO.   I can sort of understand the dreadhead mentality that ""one set should be forever"" and ""you shouldn't ever cut"" etc... but I don't subscribe to it myself. I'm not the same person I was 15 years ago when I started my first set, I can't even imagine still having those same locks right now. It wouldn't be a positive thing, it would simply feel like I'm carrying dead weight from the past.  It's been almost a year since I combed out my second set (after 7 years). Do I miss them sometimes? Sure. But I don't regret the decision at all -- I combed out because dreads were becoming incompatible with my active lifestyle (running and swimming) and waiting all day for them to dry etc was a pain. Now I can go for a spontaneous lake swim or whatever without having to worry about my washing schedule and how I'm going to dry them fast enough before bed. Or worry about how I'm going to tie them back for a road race without the weight killing my neck. Etc etc etc. I miss how they looked, but the freedom of having brushable hair outweighs it.  Whatever your reasons are for wanting to cut / comb out, if they feel like positive and good reasons to you, then you'll be carrying that forward after the change.  Are you still the same person without dreads? Only you can answer that. But your qualities as a person aren't dictated by your hair or your clothing or anything else external. IMO."

Dreadlocks,3dpvtf,Hybrid-,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:27:25 2015 UTC,That's what I figured. I was afraid to do them now and then they would be super short and silly looking.

Dreadlocks,3dpvtf,Hybrid-,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:33:39 2015 UTC,"Due to your hair type, short dreads would find it more difficult to dread and could possibly come undone at the start. And maintenance would be difficult to do. Also, you'd find that they'd probably stick out in all kind of crazy directions whilst they're short, and will take more time to grow and mature as they need to shrink first before you notice any length.  So waiting it out until your hair is at least 6 inches, will probably be the best bet for you."

When people refer to the ones at the back taking longest, I think they are more talking about ones which are right on the edge of the hairline. Those tend to have thinner/finer hairs, which will take a bit longer.  Regarding tips, I suppose the standard sprays might do it. A beanie might help too, something to create a bit of pressure, but if it's not pressing, then it's not pressing.

Dreadlocks,3dkbdh,Xioola,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:21:47 2015 UTC,I should try that because my dreads are a year old and the ones that were originally backcombed in fell right out after a few months. It's getting hard to be patient with all the loose hair at the back of my neck.
Dreadlocks,3dgk3q,Cartoon_Cartel,3,Thu Jul 16 02:34:02 2015 UTC,"You can definitely make your dreads too dry which can cause damage or breakage. It will probably take a fair bit of salt but I would ease off a bit at this point - everyday is probably kind of overkill. If your hair is super dry already, try using a bit (and I mean just a very small bit) of coconut oil or aloe vera to condition it before it gets too brittle. If it still feels fine then don't worry about conditioning at this stage but I'd definitely cut back on the salt spray significantly."

In the late 80s or so (my memory of that time period is understandably a bit ahem, hazy) he was wandering around the lots at Grateful Dead shows talking about how our pipes were poisoning us...  And that the obvious solution was to smoke glass pipes instead.  I had an original snodgrass up until about three years ago when a girl dropped it while packing it.  She felt really bad and offered to replace it -- I just didn't have the heart to tell her the pipe was older than she was and had extreme sentimental value.

Dreadlocks,3ddy3i,Ickmykwu,11,Wed Jul 15 14:55:08 2015 UTC,"Funny enough I've never had a negative comment from a black person only white people who think I'm trying to be black. I usually point out that plenty of sadhu's have dreads and that if anything I would identify with them more readily than the rasta culture  but that at the end of the day it's just a hairstyle I like, with the bonus that more people offer me joints than they did when I had short hair."
Dreadlocks,3ddy3i,Originalhommequifume,6,Wed Jul 15 16:10:56 2015 UTC,"Yes and I'm Indian. Which is weird because sadhus have dreads. Like, just read, people."
Dreadlocks,3ddy3i,Shannaniganns,5,Wed Jul 15 19:04:13 2015 UTC,"For me, it's common from internet people, but I am about the only white person in my apartment block of 50ish and I have never seen or heard anything in real life. All the hate is from people with too much time on their hands.   Diffusing it is down to explaining how it's not cultural appropriation: 1, dreadlocks occur naturally to all human hair. Literally nothing is required to form dreadlocks, therefore they can't be owned, therefore they can't be stolen. It's not like actively making a headress and putting it on. 2, black people didn't invent dreadlocks. Many cultures, several of them white, have been documented to wear dreadlocks. 3, how is it racist to have knotty hair, but it's not racist to say, ""white people can't have dreadlocks""? That statement is inherently racist."
Dreadlocks,3ddy3i,Carsandsarcasm,8,Thu Jul 16 00:15:06 2015 UTC,"It happens sometimes.  I just point out that unlike the person confronting me, who invariably has salon dreads, my ropes are 100% natural.  Besides, the culture they seem to think I'm ""appropriating"" is roughly the same age as Willie Nelson.  And if I can't have dreads, then they can't have French Toast.  Which incidentally, is far older than Willie Nelson."
Dreadlocks,3ddy3i,gensyms,2,Wed Jul 15 15:08:17 2015 UTC,Is there really anything wrong with salon dreads though?
Dreadlocks,3ddy3i,NDNguitarguy,6,Sun Jul 19 11:55:20 2015 UTC,"I did hear that a few times, yes. Tell them you're appropriating caveman culture, not black culture."

Dreadlocks,3ddy3i,Silverslade1,3,Fri Jul 17 04:22:55 2015 UTC,"mostly just rich white girls on the internet. i've overheard 2 black guys saying i must smell bad. (they were actually drunk and smelled super bad. lol) i've also overheard ""i don't understand why white people want to dread their hair"" and ""it's ok for her to look like that, but when we do it it's not ok!!"" (that one actually made me sad, because i love what different people do with their hair.) all 3 statements are just from ignorance. ignorant people are from all sorts of backgrounds. i just look people straight in the eyes, smile genuinely, and say hello. because that's a better message. and they calm their tits."
Dreadlocks,3ddy3i,traginus,2,Thu Jul 16 21:46:54 2015 UTC,Honestly I find that people of African or Caribbean descent are more likely to compliment my hair than any other group. I have never had to defend them but if I did I would simply ask why being white means I am required to use a comb.
Dreadlocks,3ddy3i,EmiBoo,2,Wed Jul 15 21:20:52 2015 UTC,"Same here.  The only people who have ever called me ""racist"" for having them have been other white people.  In fact, I had a conversation with a person of color about this the other day, and he told me that I have nothing to apologize for because my hair kicks ass and other ethnicities have had dreadlocks in the past before they had a name.  As someone who has studied archaeology, I know for a fact that Vikings were known for dreadlocks as well."

I only get shit from white people, mostly with thick southern accents. It's not too common, but it does happen. Worst was stopped at a red light, the 2 rednecks in the pickup truck next to me yelled out ""Why you wanna look like a n$$$er? Yeehaw!""

Dreadlocks,3ddy3i,rocadaboca,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:27:24 2015 UTC,"People who think that dreads are only for blacks are pitifully ignorant and don't know very much about the history of dreads being worn by people of pretty much every race for a very long time.   Don't read too much into people's expressions when you catch their eyes, it's easy to project something they don't mean and then take it personally. I used to be painfully self-conscious, making it hard for me to do anything in public. Eventually I realized that all eyes weren't on me and that people could care less how I look or if I stumble or bump into something (i'm clumsy).   Just relax and don't get to upset about something like that."
Dreadlocks,3ddy3i,bafflesaurus,0,Thu Jul 16 02:07:16 2015 UTC,I've been given plenty of disgusted faces. I just look them head to toe and give them an equally disgusted look.
Dreadlocks,3ded2b,Caged_Sinner,2,Wed Jul 15 16:44:59 2015 UTC,What are you asking exactly?  Backcombing AND crochet as a starter method is overkill IMO. One or the other will work just fine.
Dreadlocks,3ded2b,knottysleeves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:10:50 2015 UTC,"what do you mean? you cna't crochet without having the sections already formed, and as far as i know crochet hooks can't form knotted sections. they're just used for fine maintenance."
Dreadlocks,3ded2b,PoshyX,2,Wed Jul 15 17:55:03 2015 UTC,"Basically you backcomb (or twist & rip), then use the crochet hook to ""wrap"" all the loose hairs around the tangles. It forms a very tight and cylindrical dread... but also breaks a ton of hairs. And there's often a telltale ""woven"" pattern on the surface of the dread."
Dreadlocks,3ded2b,knottysleeves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:12:51 2015 UTC,"oh that's what you meant. that's what i was referring to when i said ""fine maintenance"" btw."
Dreadlocks,3ded2b,PoshyX,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:56:54 2015 UTC,I meant combination as in using crochet for maintenance! I need them to be very neat(as neat as dreads can be) because I work in a business casual setting on a daily basis.
Dreadlocks,3ded2b,PoshyX,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:03:41 2015 UTC,"that's what i thought you meant, and apparently that's what knottysleeves meant as well. it was a misunderstanding."
Dreadlocks,3ded2b,Dlynnec89,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"I also work in a business casual (banking) environment, but have clean and neat dreads. We sectioned all the hair parts so I would have lots of little dreads, and just started from the back nape of the neck and worked forward using the backcomb method. It honestly took between 24-36 hours to do, working in increments of 4-6 hours at a time. I still have about 10 dreads left to go near my face/top of my head, but it still looks incredibly neat and tidy.   I palm roll mine every single morning and alternate between using Dollylocks Pomade and Tropical Roots Firm Locking Gel.   I'm about two or three weeks in, and have a beach trip planned on Sunday to dip my hair in and get some salt water tangled in there :)"
Dreadlocks,3ded2b,canadianhippiechick,2,Thu Jul 16 19:24:53 2015 UTC,"I've had mine for 2 months now. I've crocheted them once for maintenance so far because I'm also trying to keep them neat for work. Just keep in mind that as soon as you shower, you hair will get messy again. So if you only wash them once a week, crochet them the day after washing your hair."
Dreadlocks,3ded2b,mirinecorps,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:31:58 2015 UTC,dont back comb. just do rip and tear. it's similar but yoy wont lose as much length.
Dreadlocks,3de70f,big_meek,2,Wed Jul 15 16:01:37 2015 UTC,"I suppose the question is what exactly do you mean by ""everything""? how much work was she putting in? dreads aren't exactly high maintenance unless you want them to be so I think you can figure things out. in simple terms:    wash them with residue free soap as often as they need it  keep them as dry as possible at all other times to prevent mold formation  if they start looking or feeling less than stellar and shampoo isn't doing the trick, try a deep clean (look at the sidebar for more info)  separate them every once in awhile if you want to avoid congos    other than that you really don't have to do anything afaik but I am honestly not really sure how the whole twisting thing works, do they undread otherwise? (they look nice btw!)"
Dreadlocks,3de70f,EmiBoo,2,Thu Jul 16 12:47:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks! My biggest concern tbh is what'll happen if I just seperate them and don't twist them, I'm not sure if they'll dread themselves with how long they are or if they HAVE to be twisted for a little longer. As far as keeping them clean and smelling goes, that's not really much of an issue at all, especially since I know where to get everything I need for that."

Dreadlocks,3ddczp,Ickmykwu,10,Wed Jul 15 11:35:08 2015 UTC,"just let them do their own thing, the more you do the longer they will take to mature, especially the wax. dreads are supposed to be pretty low maintenance, but i guess to each their own, i just dont see how they can progress with you doing all that work to them."
Dreadlocks,3ddczp,Lion_Style,-1,Wed Jul 15 12:20:15 2015 UTC,"I excessively crochet cause I do not like the ""fly aways""/frizz, quite bothersome in a car with no AC and the windows down blowing it in my face."
Dreadlocks,3ddczp,visforvito,15,Wed Jul 15 14:17:22 2015 UTC,"Nuts it's extremely damaging to the hair. Especially with the salt. It's one thing to do some crochet maintenance once or twice a year on established dreads, but starting them out like this is a recipe for brittle candles.   Edit: don't know why ""nuts"" is in there. I think I accidentally a thing."
Dreadlocks,3ddczp,ohhyouknow,2,Wed Jul 15 15:51:52 2015 UTC,"Wax will hold the hair in place but not help with the dreading process. You need to let them move around so that they can knot up and in turn they will stop being frizzy. Excessively crocheting is probably undoing some knots, and breaking your hair, causing even more frizz. you probably have just a bunch of broken strands stuck in there. More broken strands=more ends=more frizz. Think about it. You're over-doing it."
Dreadlocks,3ddczp,Hybrid-,9,Sat Jul 18 11:45:26 2015 UTC,"Excessive crocheting will only break more hairs and cause more frizz. And possibly lead to holes in your dreads if you do this when they mature. Dreads need time to tighten up and mature, patience is all."
Dreadlocks,3ddczp,MFBillygoat,7,Wed Jul 15 17:46:28 2015 UTC,"For 100+ hrs of work, you still have quite a lot of frizz going on.   No amount of work will stop that. Best bet is to leave them for a few months and see what happens.  I think everyone who starts out with crochet/backcombed dreads goes through a stage where they look too messy because they look so tidy at the start. They will naturally tidy up and look good.  Source: it's how I started"
Dreadlocks,3ddczp,nyctophilist,3,Wed Jul 15 17:22:24 2015 UTC,"Hold off on the wax (it'll stay in your dreads, get smelly later, and you don't need it). Your dreads are still babies and they need to do their thing. Like others have mentioned, excessive crocheting will cause more frizz because of breakage. Honestly, just keep 'em separated, you can palm roll 'em if you want to do something, and I would put aloe in mine if I wanted to have it a bit neater before going out."
Dreadlocks,3ddczp,IsaacaasI,3,Thu Jul 16 16:42:44 2015 UTC,"Leave em alone man. If you can't wait for the fly aways to go away on there own then maybe dreads aren't for you, cause all that crocheting is doing is slowing the actual maturing process. Be patient."

Dreadlocks,3daf9a,MPLSchiquita,2,Tue Jul 14 19:20:56 2015 UTC,"I may have laughed a little too hard at this.   Also, I love that they're all so beautifully wrapped. Is that to give them form / serve some function or just to look really nice? I have a few wrapped like that but it's just for splash / to be pretty."
Dreadlocks,3daf9a,jennythegreat,2,Tue Jul 14 19:49:53 2015 UTC,I started the wrapping to avoid using wax and keep them from being fuzzy but it is also for the rainbow look. My friends help wrap them so its sort of a nod to the young American Girl culture of hair wraps and friendship bracelets.
Dreadlocks,3daf9a,jennythegreat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:29:34 2015 UTC,"Now that's a neat idea. I have nobody around here to help wrap except my kids and they'd turn out like ... well, like you'd expect them to with two boys under 8 using embroidery thread. I may give it a go to wrap a couple more, though, because that's such a fun look."
Dreadlocks,3daf9a,that_hippie,2,Thu Jul 16 15:04:08 2015 UTC,"I will definitely be trying that when my dreads are long enough! Love the wraps, btw. I just bought a huge pack of embroidery floss so I have lots of colors to choose from!"
Dreadlocks,3daf9a,that_hippie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:42:11 2015 UTC,Right on! I recommend wrapping as tightly as possible so that they stay strong and don't break off. I've had some of these strings last for four years.
Dreadlocks,3daf9a,that_hippie,2,Tue Jul 14 22:06:11 2015 UTC,That's crazy! I've wrapped my dreads before but I've only left them in for a few days at most (I took them before washing). But that was when they were still pretty young and I didn't want to impede the knotting process. I just hit my one-year mark yesterday and I have several that have tightened up quite nicely so maybe I'll wrap those and keep them in for awhile!
Dreadlocks,3daf9a,murdera,2,Tue Jul 14 22:41:23 2015 UTC,"If you double up on the threads and wrap in X's, it makes for this fun bumpy texture, and let's be real, having an assortment of textures to play with all the time was like my #1 reason for getting dreads."
Dreadlocks,3dd2fo,cosmicpixiedust,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:09:37 2015 UTC,"It's been years since I've dyed my hair, and I've never bleached it, so I can't really answer that question for you. You can, however, wrap your hair with colored string or yarn, or put in some colored wool extensions for a little bit of color while you decide if you're going to dye your hair again.  I have straight, fine, silky hair and I backcombed my dreads, though I have heard that twist and rip is a good method for that hair type. I've not heard that backcombing is more damaging, although that really wouldn't have mattered to me anyways since my normal hair would break without me ever doing anything to it.  Just do your research and decide what method you think will work best for you! There's a lot of good information in the sidebar, and I also highly recommend videos by Lazy Dreads on YouTube, they are really informative! You should also start washing your hair with a non-residue dreadlocks shampoo in the few weeks before you start your dreads.  Good luck! :)"
Dreadlocks,3dcq7g,smokey16,3,Wed Jul 15 06:24:03 2015 UTC,"Everyone's hair dreads differently, and everyone's hair texture is different. If you start dreads expecting/hoping to get the same locks as someone else, you will likely be disappointed.  Also, the starting method doesn't have much to do with the end result once they start locking. There's no single ""best"" way to start them, it all depends on what works for you and your hair and what you want out of your dread journey.  That said, ""straight"" hair usually responds best to the twist & rip, backcombing, and neglect/natural methods."
Dreadlocks,3dcq7g,knottysleeves,2,Wed Jul 15 06:29:29 2015 UTC,oh ok thanks for answering but one more question i only know people who know how to interlock do you think its gonna be alright to me?
Dreadlocks,3dcq7g,knottysleeves,3,Wed Jul 15 06:46:46 2015 UTC,"Don't use interlocking to start dreads. Especially if you have ""straight"" hair. Not recommended."

Dreadlocks,3dcq7g,supfaggot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:03:21 2015 UTC,I did it for my bangs and it seemed to work pretty well but it looked braided for couple months before it started locking.
Dreadlocks,3dcq7g,spuncookie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:32:01 2015 UTC,"If you got straight hair, i don't think it'll twist up and coil like that. Especially the blunted tips, you can blunt them, but they are gonna keep coming undone unless you do them properly. My advice is what knotty sleeves said on methods. There's also crochet method, which is best used minimally and not used as a whole; otherwise your dreads are gonna be heavy and tight which might cause headaches. But yeah just don't expect your dreads to look like someone elses, and don't expect them to look good,  right away. Took me a long time before someone finally said ""nice dreads"". Just saying most dread newbies don't know what to expect, and if i had the info i have now, i wouldn't be on my 3rd or 4th set of dreads right now. So yeah again, patience is your friend."

Dreadlocks,3d8ud8,YogiKakumaraj,3,Tue Jul 14 12:13:19 2015 UTC,"Yay!  Yup, washing with water only is fine if you have brushable hair. But it doesn't work great for dreads, because water alone can't break down & wash away all the stuff inside the locks. You're basically just doing a surface rinse in the shower. Any kind of soap or dread shampoo (or a regular BS/ACV wash) really does help a lot."

Dreadlocks,3d5vxs,thirtytwoflavors,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:34:23 2015 UTC,"Phone won't load comment button but I can reply to this for some reason,  sorry.  But anyways, my dreads looked like this after a couple weeks. I did them on accident. I knew nothing and I had an afro, my hairs naturally curly but I used to pick it out. Then I just stopped. Instead I put water and just shook my head so it'd curl and I'd be on my way, it was quicker. I didn't know much about dreads, still don't. But it's been almost a year now and I have some pretty cool looking hair dread stuff. So my advice is if you have nappy hair just let your hair do what it wants, just knock it into place when it gets out of hand. Like a child  I just found this sub while doing If anyone reads this and would like answer this question please do  Is there a dread friendly shampoo that smells like flowers? Or can I use any shampoo that smells like flowers?  Follow up question.  My dreads sorta go up like I got shocked. But when they're wet they go down (they stay like that if I let them dry like that)  but my other question is,  would they eventually start falling the longer they get? At this moment if I take one from my forehead it reaches the tip of my nose"
Dreadlocks,3d5vxs,Nappynaps,5,Tue Jul 14 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"My guess is start a mid length fro, then go with towel rub method - my hairs not quite that thick, but it started to look like that at its most neglected afro state before I started finger combing the fro all the time. With thicker hair and some towelly encouragement, I bet it would be about what you're shooting for"
Dreadlocks,3d5sb7,YogiKakumaraj,5,Mon Jul 13 19:16:58 2015 UTC,"My hair looked similar when the trees here all decided to unleash their pollen 24/7 for 2 weeks. I'd guess you have either spores or other wind borne debris in there. BS/ACV should help.   However, since you do live in a humid climate, don't rule out mold: if you aren't drying your hair completely after washing, or if it often feels damp, you could be headed for trouble. If your hair never seems to air dry after a shower, start using a hair dryer. It absolutely will make your hair shittier looking in the short run, but it has helped my hair lock so much quicker than before blow drying. Also look into sea salt spray to combat humidity.   Finally, I as a no-poo lover, you HAVE to start using a soap or shampoo. Water only can work great for people with ""regular"" hair, but it will not work well for dreads. I personally use diluted Dawn (dish soap) on my hair 2x a week, water only if I need to wash my hair between those washes, and BS/ACV once a month. You don't need any fancy shampoo to have nice hair."
Dreadlocks,3d5sb7,COFFEEANDBABYMETAL,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:57:16 2015 UTC,How do you know which sort of dish soap would work with dreads? I'd happily use one. I would imagine certain ingredients would need to be avoided or something?

Dreadlocks,3d5sb7,rollntoke,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:19:44 2015 UTC,"Background: I've been freeforming for about 4 months now (5 in a few days..), I don't use any products on my hair. I wash with just water. I've just done that in the past before I started dreading and it seemed to work well with my hair, so I continued doing that..Today I was told my dreads look ""greenish"" and I got worried. I just took a picture and that's what I saw.  Is that mold? my hair doesn't stink, I never even realized it was white-ish like that cause it looks fine to the eye but with a camera it's powdery looking. I've never done a Baking Soda or ACV rinse, but I will do tomorrow just to be sure, but is this any cause for concern?  Thanks so much."
Dreadlocks,3d5sb7,gensyms,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:16:25 2015 UTC,"..also I forgot to mention I live in Dubai which is a hot, humid and dusty place. I wonder if it's a mixture of lint and dust or something. I dry my hair well I think, I never thought I'd have any issues arise to be honest."
Dreadlocks,3d5sb7,Midgar-Zolom,3,Mon Jul 13 19:23:20 2015 UTC,"If it's mold you would be able to smell it. Changes are that it's some sort of buildup (like dust or dandruff). You really want to be using something in your hair. May I ask your reasoning behind using no product? I reckon you should do a BS/ACV rinse and see if the problem persists.   Also, would love to see before and after pics!"

Dreadlocks,3d5ui5,sheepdawg7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:40:14 2015 UTC,How do you rinse? Do you have like a bucket and dip your dreads into it or do you just pour the mixture over your hair?

You can see how gnarly the area at the top of my neck is though, that was all free hair until a few months ago and they're locking and tightening up gloriously.  I initially used the twist & rip method when I first started them, did a lot of palm rolling for the first few months and keep them clean. I just ended up letting them do their own thing after that. I'm glad I did.  They're a bit untidy so it's kind of hard to keep them separated :P I just washed them a few hours ago, they're still pretty damp.  Here you go <3  Edited to say thank you so much :)"

I'm kinda diggin' it too :)   I actually haven't counted them in a long time, I've just let them go, really. The last time was 28, I believe but I have a few from stray hair that dreaded on its own and quite a few more that I've put in.   Thank you sooo much.

Dreadlocks,3cuvgk,Combatbootie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:09:30 2015 UTC,"When I started them, my hair was that length just when it touches your shoulders and flips out.  I started with freeform, but my hair is really really straight and just sorta became one big dreadlock ball on the back of my head. So I ended up loosely sectioning and backcombing and gently crocheting to start them off.   They are pretty heavy especially when wet. There are times I want to buzz my head and have the light freedom of baldness, but regret? Never."
Dreadlocks,3cuvgk,Combatbootie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:14:24 2015 UTC,"yes, my hair sounds exactly like yours but a bit shorter (freeform beaver tail oh no)  as someone who shaved their mid back length hair totally bald 6 months ago - freedom from it all is amazing but your hairs are gorgeous. totally putting me back on the dread-consideration train."

Dreadlocks,3co6m6,babsFTW,3,Thu Jul 9 16:19:30 2015 UTC,Yep I'm inspired. This is exactly how I want mine to look... They are far too short right now. Can I ask how long your roots are before the dreads start? And do your roots dread naturally or do they grow out?
Dreadlocks,3co6m6,Sloebertjepoep,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:13:34 2015 UTC,"I'd say my roots go up to 3cm before the dread starts. People keep asking me if I'm groing them out but I like the way it looks.   I don't really bother re-doing them. I had the roots done two or so months ago, but before and after that I've done shitall and somehow the roots still stay at 3cm. So I suppose they're dreading naturally beyond that point.   You'll have to be careful with flat dreads, dreads growing together etc. though. Naturally. I just palmroll loads whenever I feel like it.   Patience is the key. Somehow they sort themselves out, you just need to give them some time :)"

Mine aren't caucasian or that mature yet (2 1/2 years), but are pretty tight, hard, and spiky (probably individually thick hairs poking out) to the touch, due to over crocheting a long time ago.  I've felt a lot which are very soft to touch and floppy, usually these are natural or tended to less, but have been around for a long time (10 years?). I've found that closer to my scalp, the newer and less crocheted length of locks are similar to this."
Dreadlocks,3cp01u,Hamypig,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:24:35 2015 UTC,Same here two years in. I bend em every which way once dry after a washing and they soften up a bit.
Dreadlocks,3cp01u,laurenkk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:41:03 2015 UTC,perhaps it is time for a conditioner?
Dreadlocks,3cp01u,MwamWWilson,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:04:03 2015 UTC,"Harder locks are usually overprocessed locks. Not always though, you might just have a hair type that gets really tight tangles.  I think that locks tend to go through an immediate tightening phase, then as the hairs get older and start to wear out the strands loosen and break allowing more flexibility.   If they're scratchy like velcro almost, I'd guess they're over processed and you'll just have to wait for them to relax."
Dreadlocks,3cp01u,fragileteeth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:48:51 2015 UTC,I think it probably has more to do with the hair itself.  Because my oldest ones are the hardest/densest.  And the newest ones are softer and fluffier.  And mine cannot possibly be over processed because they've not been processed at all.    100% natural neglect.
Dreadlocks,3cp01u,gensyms,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:46:11 2015 UTC,"it more than likely has to do with, well... a lot of things. your washing methods and schedule, your genetics (i.e. hair type,), the age of your hair, length, how you locked your dreads, any products you might use... mostly genetics and washing methods tho."
Dreadlocks,3cp01u,PoshyX,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:36:35 2015 UTC,Then it's just the stages your hair will go through. They start loose then tighten a lot then they relax over time. Over processing just delays the relaxing stage and speeds the tightening stage. While everyone's hair is different hardly anyone escapes the cycle!
Dreadlocks,3cnjrt,BadAssOrangeJuice,2,Thu Jul 9 07:56:57 2015 UTC,It sounds just kinda like you're talking about thin dreads. Any info on where you've seen this?

Dreadlocks,3clzys,gingerfr0,2,Thu Jul 9 03:47:30 2015 UTC,"""Maintaining"" is kind of a misnomer, since at 4 weeks your dreads are still babies. :-)  Loose dreads are normal. Unravelling is normal. In the first several months, they will seem like 2 steps forward and 1 step back for awhile. Trying to micro-manage them (especially this early) is a losing battle and will only frustrate you. Your hair knows how to knot, you just have to give it time & space to do it. Don't be afraid of messy hair and undone locks, it's all part of the dreading process."
Dreadlocks,3clzys,knottysleeves,2,Thu Jul 9 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"I started mine twist-and-rip method and when they came undone at the ends like that I tried re-tnr'ing the ends. They will keep coming undone over and over again, so I gave up and eventually they work their way down. Now most of my locs have less than an inch of undreaded hair at the end. You can try to twist the ends, but definitely don't take them out and redo them. This is a natural part of the process. In a few months you will notice a big difference."
Dreadlocks,3clzys,iBeenie,2,Thu Jul 9 03:03:34 2015 UTC,"I have thick ringlet style hair, and to begin with I hate my tips. They were always super long and each of my dreads ended in this ridiculous little curl, I looked like a sea anemone. I wanted blunted ends so I took to them with a crochet hook. Essentially I just used the hook to grab the loose bit and pull them into the end of the dread, and I did this fairly early on (about 2 months). I still get a few loose tips, but no-where near as bad as it used to be.   Personally I didn't have a problem mucking about with my tips, once I did it they were perfect and don't often require a redo. Just depends on your hair type, and what kind of tips you want to end up with."
Dreadlocks,3clzys,Silverslade1,2,Thu Jul 9 03:55:27 2015 UTC,"I know I'm late but I wanted to add to the conversation :)   Initially, I couldnt get the ends to knot up, so I let the tips be free. It was actually a good thing, water can flow out of them more freely that way when they're wet. Then, they started to become blunt and rounded on their own, I didn't have to keep ripping or use a hook.   Let them do what they want to do ;)"
Dreadlocks,3clzys,pennyxlame,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:21:02 2015 UTC,i had a few that kept undreading at the tips so i re-twist and ripped them and used a crochet hook to pull the hairs up into the dread and then brushed some back out so i would still have wispy ends. i basically half-blunted them. BUT i did this after they were matured. until that point i just banded the ends together ONLY while washing to prevent them from loosening more.
Dreadlocks,3clzys,traginus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:57:42 2015 UTC,just leave them be. don't think of them as un doing themselves. what they are actually doing is dreading themselves. hair has to be free to dread. all you do when you fiddle with them at this point is delay the dreading process. pretty much for the next six months to a year you really want to just forget that you have hair. eventually your hair will find it's place and you won't be able to get them to come loose.

Since then I've been rubbing my head in circles just with my hand basically palm rolling them against my scalp with a few manufactured dreads here and there.
Dreadlocks,3clawj,glotf,8,Wed Jul 8 20:10:24 2015 UTC,"Let me know if I misinterpreted your questions, but here's my best answers from what I understand:  The more dreads you divide your hair into, the skinnier each dread will be. So if you don't like fat dreads, you can divide your scalp into 100+ sections instead of 30-50. The process of dreading will take longer, but you will avoid ending up with ""fat"" dreads. Note: most dreads will thicken up during the dreading process, so make your initial sections a little bit skinnier than you would like your finished dreads to be.    I also don't like the idea of them looking messy e.g. hairs coming away from the initial dread as they get longer    IME this is somewhat unavoidable. You can cut down on the frizz by crocheting or using your chosen method of maintenance, but (someone correct me if I'm wrong) new dreads will never have that smooth, sleek look of straight hair.  Good luck, OP!"
Dreadlocks,3clawj,myceli-yum,3,Wed Jul 8 20:46:56 2015 UTC,Exactly all of this.  Frizz on the length of the dreads disappears over time.  Mine took maybe 8 months before I wasn't feeling like I looked totally disheveled.  I feel like backcombed dreads look tidier from the get go vs. Twist n rip.
Dreadlocks,3clawj,laurenkk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:07:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response, it's exactly what I was trying to ask :)  Judging by the second part of your answer, the longer amount of time I have the dreads the less amount of 'frizz' there will be?  Again, thank you very much. :)"
Dreadlocks,3clawj,myceli-yum,3,Wed Jul 8 20:53:37 2015 UTC,"In general, yes, the older your dreads, the less frizz. Depending on your hair texture, the first 6 months may feel very discouraging. I thought I looked like a homeless werewolf. That's when headbands and patience are your friends. I'm glad I stuck it out, though. Now I have awesome hair that styles itself in the morning and that I don't have to worry about brushing when I go camping!"
Dreadlocks,3clawj,Arizon_Dread,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:32:41 2015 UTC,"One more thing to take into account is that you'll need to separate those newly formed babies regardless if you make many slim locks or fewer fatter ones, otherwise they'll Congo into fat ones. I.e several dreads join into one lock at the root and the longer you wait the more it grows and the denser it'll be."
Dreadlocks,3clawj,gensyms,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:54:28 2015 UTC,How would you recommend separating them? small rubber bands at the root of each of the dreads maybe?

Dreadlocks,3civgu,gensyms,5,Wed Jul 8 13:35:37 2015 UTC,"From what I learned, patience is key. Also, I hear maintenance and too much crochet/back combing can make your dreads weak. You need to be patient as your dreads loosen and tighten, only time will allow your dreads to fully lock. I recommend not using wax because, while it makes them look neater, it hinders them from truly locking up which could also be causing them to slip out easily.  Dreads don't start out perfect, dude.  I recommend you read up Raging Roots Studio's blog on dreads. It should give you a lot of good info. They really know their stuff."
Dreadlocks,3civgu,unBottledFairy,3,Wed Jul 8 09:10:52 2015 UTC,"Hey,   Your dreads will be loose for more then a few months still, to be honest. Time is the only thing that will lock your dreads.  Your dreads are also quite short so your going to notice the loosening of dreads quite a bit more, then if they were longer.   Be patient and give them more time to dread and grow."
Dreadlocks,3civgu,TSIashleigh,2,Wed Jul 8 07:24:48 2015 UTC,First of wax is nasty as hell..  If I were you I'd just comb all of them out and try to wash all that out as counterproductive as it sounds. I'd start again just twisting n ripping.
Dreadlocks,3civgu,monickerr,2,Wed Jul 8 17:30:49 2015 UTC,"Ideally I want my dreads to stay in for longer than 3 weeks and stay tight. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   You need to let them mature. Hair can't magically lock overnight, no matter what method or products you use. It takes many months (4 months is still the child stage) for new dreads to tighten and stay together.  All that ""tightening"" work is actually making the dreading process take even longer. Messy hair = friction = tangles = knots. Hair can't move if it's woven together with crochet hooks and slathered in wax.  My advice is to get the wax out (or as much of it as you can, because it rarely 100% comes out), stop going for maintenance, and let your dreads breathe and get messy for awhile. It will pay off greatly in the long run."
Dreadlocks,3civgu,knottysleeves,2,Wed Jul 8 19:30:38 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's all gunna happen.  For a start, take /u/gensyms advice, punish the waxer. You're gunna have to get used to your dreads doing what they like. It's all part of the process, and learning to accept it is one of the best/most rewarding parts of growing them. Relax, your hair knows what needs to be done, and how to do it, it just needs time.  In future, stay the fuck away from wax. It may keep your dreads looking tidy for a week or so, but that shit is just gunna collect inside your dreads and cause issues later one."
Dreadlocks,3civgu,Silverslade1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:43:41 2015 UTC,"Ok, one thing i don't see much in this sub is talk about twisting your starter locs. I have hair texture similar to yours and i twist mine at least once a day. It is basically my method of palm rolling, except your dreads aren't loc'd up yet so you only twist them the way they were put in initially.  Every morning i wake up with them matted to my head, but as long as as i twist them they are fine and have all day to do their own thing. It works WONDERS taming frizz. It is OK to put locking gel in your hair to help it loc up, however, it is NOT ok to use wax in your hair...get all the wax out of your hair asap (you may be able to heat the wax w a hair dryer and work it out with your fingers, although you may not get it all out.  To twist your locs you can use pure aloe or a non-residue loc lotion like this one from jane carter https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000U2AUDK/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_nrANvbERHVQ6Fe it is on sale on amazon w amazon prime.  Good luck and hit me up if you have any more questions. It's only my 2nd week with starter locs but none of them have came out and my sections are still gucci. No wax, no problems. Like the previous commenters said, you gotta let your hair do it's thing, it take months for hair to loc. Twisting your hair with product every few days and working that product out is a cycle that will be healthy for your hair and even speed up the locking process. The days you dnt use aloe vera or residue-free twist lotion, there will still be product left in your hair from last time, twist away homie!!"
Dreadlocks,3civgu,BlazeWelly,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:37:45 2015 UTC,"I would not recommend using that loc lotion. He is wanting his dreads to lock quickly. Moisturizing your hair reduces friction, that means the hairs slide past each other instead of knotting up. I would take the wax out (Soak in really hot water?? idk???) and then use a sea salt spray to increase the friction, therefore speeding up the locking process."
Dreadlocks,3civgu,ohhyouknow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:58:18 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I mostly use this method to tame frizz and keep my sections in place so that I don't have hair coming put of one twist and joining surrounding twists. It may not speed up the locking process to have product in your hair, but twisting it yourself everyday does help it loc up. Seems like OP's mane goal (see what i did there :-) is to have twists that are able to loc because they aren't coming apart everyday. Twisting would be the best method to tame frizz/hold sectioning. If OP leaves his hair dry with no product and sprays it with sea salt, his hair is gona he frizzy and dry looking."

Dreadlocks,3chdeb,PoshyX,3,Wed Jul 8 04:18:53 2015 UTC,"You can wash your hair as frequently as you like regardless of dreads. They key is keeping the intervals regular to allow the scalp to adjust. I know plenty of people who only wash their straight hair once a week.  Keeping them separate is one of the bigger problems with partial dreads. They will suck in neighbouring hair and require a high level of upkeep to prevent this. I wouldn't recommend wraps too early as they will slow the maturation process, you just need to stay on top of separating.   The only other thing is managing conditioner when washing. Straight hair probably wants conditioner/regular shampoo and keeping that out of the dreads is a thing. I think people tend to put their partial dreads at the back to make it easier to wash their straight hair by flipping it forward.  My personal opinion is, go for full dreads. Everything I read about partials says, high maintenance."
Dreadlocks,3chdeb,Carsandsarcasm,2,Tue Jul 7 23:17:03 2015 UTC,best advice is persistence.
Dreadlocks,3chdeb,MwamWWilson,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:06:48 2015 UTC,"Dreads overtime as they mature will shrink in length, but become more dense and compressed. I personally would not recommend partially dreaded hair, only cause if you later want to dread your whole head, your sections aren't going to be properly mapped out and will risk more con-going dreads. And yes, technically wrapping dreadlocks in thread will help them stay a little more in their section, however, the thread is most likely going to grow into the dread. This is because the hair pulls the thread in with its other hairs, and if you would try to take the thread out later, it could risk pulling the hairs out of the dread, making it sorta useless putting the thread in the first place."

Dreadlocks,3ce697,DirtyEarthGoddess,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:05:25 2015 UTC,There is nothing 'dreadful' about your hair.  Respect them and yourself and remember they are locks....
Dreadlocks,3cfp51,cardinalcourage,3,Tue Jul 7 15:36:33 2015 UTC,you should wash your hair when your body needs you to. get some non residue shampoo or baking soda/apple cider vinegar (see side bar) i would add tea tree oil (just a few drops) for the itch. i washed my hair the day after i put in my dreads. but i guess it might depend on how yours were put in...... like if chemicals were used....
Dreadlocks,3cfp51,traginus,2,Tue Jul 7 16:38:35 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I washed mine after three days.  Apple cider rinsing stopped my itching right away.

Lots of great suggestions in previous ""itchy"" posts: https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreadlocks/search?q=itchy&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all  BTW, itching is usually temporary with new dreads. Your scalp isn't used to being sectioned and having the hair pulled tightly, etc. It takes a few weeks for the scalp to get used to things and settle down."

Dreadlocks,3c9bw5,annwells94,4,Mon Jul 6 02:39:05 2015 UTC,"Fellow fine-haired person here!  If you have a lot of hair, then it shouldn't be a problem, I fretted about it for a couple of months before I decided to just go for it. Try and make just 1 dread somewhere on the back of your head so you can get a feeling of how big your sections should be and generally how your hair behaves.   Also, I would definitely recommend t&r as the starting method, since there's a far lesser chance of them unraveling. I washed them the day after making them and they held magnificently!  And yes, of course it is better for people with thick hair - they can have more and thicker locks. But you'll see that after a while, even if you start out with thin locks, they shrink a lot, collect the hair that would otherwise have fallen out and get thicker. You just have to wait a year or two."
Dreadlocks,3c9bw5,bloohiggs,2,Mon Jul 6 06:26:55 2015 UTC,"You can have dreadlocks with thin hair. It's typically better for thick hair, but since your hair isn't falling out as much and is getting caught in the dread, it's not as bad."
Dreadlocks,3c9bw5,Midgar-Zolom,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:12:59 2015 UTC,"Fine, straight hair knots more readily than thick, curly hair, so I don't know how dreads could be better for thick hair?"
Dreadlocks,3c9bw5,ohhyouknow,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:31:55 2015 UTC,"Thick hair means more follicles,which means more shedding. Since the hair isn't falling out and is instead getting caught in the dread, it makes a thicker dread. I don't know where you got that straight hair tangles better, though. Kinky hair grows in a way that encircles other hairs in tight spirals."
Dreadlocks,3c9bw5,Midgar-Zolom,3,Tue Jul 7 23:06:30 2015 UTC,"Well, This article disagrees.   Based on these criteria, curly hair averages about three tangles per head whereas straight averages more than five tangles. The surprising results, and a mathematical model of tangling, were recently published in the American Journal of Physics.  In Masson's model, it turns out that even though curly strands meet more often than straight strands, the angle at which two straight hairs meet is the angle most likely to lead to tangling.   Thin hair gets caught in dreads too. My volume has more than quadrupled. Also, thin hair means more follicles. We're talking about strands per square cm here. Blondes have the most follicles, I was born blonde, and before I allowed my hair to lock, I used to shed like crazy. My sister has thick, wavy dark hair, completely opposite. I took a cosmetology course a few years ago, and have played with a bunch of hair types. Thin hair knots easier."
Dreadlocks,3c9bw5,ohhyouknow,0,Wed Jul 8 00:09:18 2015 UTC,"I was referring to ""thick"" or ""thin"" hair as the amount of follicles on the head and not the width of the individual hairs, as that's the way it's referred to where I am. But, that article is pretty interesting and makes sense. It doesn't seem to take into consideration frizziness, which would seem like it would be a major factor."
Dreadlocks,3c9bw5,Midgar-Zolom,2,Wed Jul 8 01:08:49 2015 UTC,"I have pretty fine, thin hair as well and it frankly looks way better in dreads than it ever did combed and such.

Dreadlocks,3c7l0o,Xioola,4,Sun Jul 5 17:14:39 2015 UTC,"Everyone's water is different. Hard water is supposed to cause that waxy residue feeling with Dr B's, but I get it too and my city has super soft water.  You can try diluting it more, but ultimately you might have to find a different soap/shampoo that works better for you."
Dreadlocks,3c7l0o,knottysleeves,2,Sun Jul 5 23:26:36 2015 UTC,"That sounds too concentrated. I made a 10% solution by adding about 1.5oz of Dr Bronner's to a 16oz squeeze bottle of water. That was okay, but sometimes I make it even less concentrated (like 5%).  1 tbsp is 1oz and 1 cup is about 8oz. So try doubling or tripling the water content.   I switched over to using Tea Tree Tingle residue free shampoo from Trader Joe's and I like it a lot more."

Dreadlocks,3c7l0o,goodtincture,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:41:49 2015 UTC,I never had much luck with Dr. Bronner's on my dreads for the same reason (as a hand and body soap it is great).  I second the trader Joes tea tree shampoo.  I also like just rinsing/soaking them with well diluted vinegar in a bucket of water. Since my scalp is really oily this seams to work the best to keep the oil under control.
Dreadlocks,3c7l0o,laurenkk,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem.  I switched to Alaffia African Black Soap (peppermint, but comes in many), and have a WAY better time with it feeling rinsed clean.  I always follow with diluted apple cider vinegar rinse which keeps my scalp from feeling too dry."
Dreadlocks,3c7b58,allenplantsberg,7,Sun Jul 5 15:36:55 2015 UTC,That's how they thicken up:  by looping back on themselves.  It won't completely smooth out.  It'll end up as a couple bumps.

Dreadlocks,3c6mut,judewriley,4,Sun Jul 5 09:43:43 2015 UTC,"Starting depends on what you're going for. If you dig the whole super-sectioned look, you'll want to go to a loctition or other natural hairstylist and get them sectioned and started. You'll need at least 3 inches minimum to start. The length is counted as how long your hair is when you pull or stretch it out, not how long it is when it's just sitting in its natural state.  If you don't care about sections, you can get started with dreads now if you want. You can do the towel rub method, which tends more toward this look. Or you can do the ever-popular neglect/freeform route.   For faster hair growth, take prenatal vitamins. Seriously. The extra folic acid makes your hair and nails grow faster and stronger in general. It's not a miracle cure, but it does help especially with breakage.  Palm roll as often as you need to keep things looking nice. You can see a stylist every few months to do regular maintenance; or you can do the crochet hook or latch hook method, or Chescalocs' sewing method (sidebar link).    You can also absolutely get extensions and have them dreaded... But you will 100% want to go to a stylist to have it done if you don't have any experience with weaves/extensions/etc. You also want to make sure you get REAL human hair, not synthetic. This will cost $$$. Most popular way to extend dreads is to wait until your hair has started locking (~3months? depends on your hair) then crochet the extensions onto the ends."
Dreadlocks,3c6mut,COFFEEANDBABYMETAL,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:29:12 2015 UTC,This post is extremely informative and I would definitely take it into consideration as it embodies the entirety of all the possible decisions I had to take into consideration at the beginning of my loc journey which only began a month ago today.  If you dont mind having little stubbies on your head though you can start locs at under 3 inches especially if you plan to use the Sponge or Towel method from what I have researched though if you have stringy or a loose curl pattern like I do you may be better of going with 2 or 3 strand twists.  Shoot me a DM maybe I can help you with research or just general information I have found pertaining to my journey.
Dreadlocks,3c6mut,Enng,2,Fri Jul 10 17:20:44 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'm not a dreadlocks expert by any means, but I think I can give you some advice.   First things first, your hair growth. I just looked it up and it seems like African Americans have an average of 4 inches of hair year(around 1/4 inch a month). So, what lifestyle changes are you making to help with growth? I noticed my hair was noticeably healthiest after I switched from my shitty eating habits, to only eating leafy green vegetables, meat and dairy. If diet is what you are going to change, you should pm me.   So, from what I've seen, you could probably dread your hair around 3 inches. They will be very short though, so you may want to wait a bit longer. I dreaded my hair when it was about 5.5 inches at the shortest. We put some dreads in my Shorter 3 inch hair, but they just fell out. We have very different hair types though, I have medium density, fine, straight hair. Is you hair  curly? Coarse and thick too? To start your dreads, I'd first see if any of your friends have done them. I prefer to just hang out somewhere, and dread your hair with a friend as opposed to the salon.   There is a few ways to dread hair. Twist and rip, backcomb and neglect. You should do some research on each of those and see which one you think you would prefer, I think it just comes down to personal preference. I did backcombing and it worked well. It was pretty easy for the people doing it too. Well, easy to learn. It's a pretty big job, but well worth it.   As for maintenance, it differs between methods. I think for twist and rip, you have to re twist them sometimes. For the backcomb method, you can leave them alone, or tighten them with a crochet hook. REALLY do your research on crocheting dreadlocks though. Lots of people think that it is not good for your dreads. I personally tighten mine with a crochet hook, and haven't had any breakage yet. I think you just have to be gentle with it.  Hell, You can hear it if you rip it! I think the issues with crocheting come up if you do it too frequently. Do your research, and measure up the pros and cons.   There is washing routines where you do a soak with apple cider vinegar to clean them, but I haven't done that yet. I wash my hair about twice a week usually, but you can wash them more if you like. I didn't wash mine for a week after I first put them in, but went back to 2 times after that.   The only other maintenance advice I have is to be frequent in separating them! Dreads like to cling to thier brothers and sisters!! I wasn't very persistent in separating mine in the beginning, and I paid for it. It sucks to separate them when they have like 50 hairs entwined between 2 dreads. It's painful. Especially when it's right near the root. So you will be doing yourself a solid when you don't have to go through that ;) I separate mine after I shower. Sometimes in between showers if I sleep on them and they start getting ideas.   That's my advice! Definitely do your research into some of the methods and maintenance I mentioned. You can pm me if you have any more specific questions about back combing, crocheting or maintenance.   Edit: words, grammar."
Dreadlocks,3c6mut,Cassassinn,3,Sun Jul 5 15:45:34 2015 UTC,"African Americans have an average of 4 inches of hair year(around 1/4 inch a month)   A little off topic, but that's actually a myth (#3). Researching dermatology, you'll find that normally, most healthy people can expect hair growth averaging ½ an inch per month, 6 inches a year.   After I observed that rate of growth in my own 3C-4A textured hair, I found out that hairdressers/barbers/cosmetologists have corroborated and adopted that same standard measure for use even in their antique equipment reaching back (afaik) before the 1940's, manufactured by various companies in various countries, distributing internationally to this day.   Haircare is so ridiculously prevalent, if a growth rate difference was noticed in an entire race or ethnic group it would be very well documented and known by now. It's probably genetics 101 that hair growth, rate and loss genes aren't bound by race, but truthfully, I have no clue.  Edit:format"

You'll always have a couple inches of normal hair close to your scalp.  That's how we know God exists and that she loves us: because that loose hair at the roots makes it possible to scratch your head (sorta).

Dreadlocks,3bodph,EmiBoo,3,Wed Jul 1 15:22:23 2015 UTC,"Dreading my hair was the best thing I could have done with my super fine hair to be honest, as mentioned by others - way more volume now (hats are now often too small for me instead of ridiculously huge), I am way happier with the look and feel of my hair, and I don't spend every morning wondering how I will make the uncooperative, limp mess cooperate for a couple of hours.   The one piece of advice I will offer is that you should be careful with installation as fine hair can be easy to break. I would recommend twist n'rip just cause that is how I started and it worked better than a previous attempt with backcombing.   Good luck! Your story is very similar to mine - wanted them for years and years and only got started last year at 29 - and its worth it! I would bet that a year from now you will be so happy with your dreads you will not be able to imagine not having them :)"

My hair is so thin that my ears would poke through, I hated it. I went the natural route, and it was very interesting, especially now that instead of a 3/4"" thick ponytail, I can't even double up or even get my dreads through a normal hairband thingy anymore. I used to have to double it up like four or five times, it was rediculous. I'd say go for it!"

So when I think about getting volume it's hard to believe.   I'm thinking of going the natural route, but I want them to be somewhat even. They don't have to be perfect, but I'd like for them to be somewhat uniform. Would you suggest the natural method?"
Dreadlocks,3bodph,EmiBoo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:21:57 2015 UTC,"Idk, I've never had dreads any other way. some of mine are really thick, and others are only a few mm thick. I went the natural route because I like how they look up at the scalp. I just personally didn't want to see my scalp after sectioning between individual dreads. I guess I was also scared of ending up having just a few ropes and ending up looking like home dude on Don't Be A Menace. I'm not sure what method you should use, you could always just use a different method in the beginning, and let it go wild if you don't want to wait for them to form up. It can be a very long, and slightly scary process, but in the end I think it was worth it."

Dreadlocks,3bodph,laurenkk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:32:32 2015 UTC,they definitely fattened up fast for me too - was aiming for pinky-ish sized dreads or smaller and ended up with a bunch that are closer to thumb size. certainly not complaining tho - I love the new volume and the challenge of finding hats and hair bands that actually fit :)
Dreadlocks,3bodph,monickerr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:08:05 2015 UTC,Thank you for the reply! I think I'm gonna go for it.  Which method did you use? I'm weighing my options as of now.
Dreadlocks,3bodph,monickerr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:25:25 2015 UTC,"First time around I used back combing and wax. Wax was super rank and a huge mistake in hindsight. Further along the line I had extensions and then maintenance done with the crochet method which I was really pleased with.   I only took them out as a career decision which though I think it was the right choice job wise I do regret as they'd just got to the point of being really chunky and nice.  This time around I've started straight away with the crochet method and I feel like my current dreads (which are only about 2 months old) are at the stage my old ones were at 18 months, so I'm hoping they'll be like my last set within a year or so!"
Dreadlocks,3bodph,monickerr,2,Wed Jul 1 20:01:20 2015 UTC,"Twist and rip is the way to go. don't do natural method because it will take forever, considering that you have an office job.  You can have someone part your hair in fan pattern in order to avoid big gaps. You can refer to this site for more methods but I'd say twist and rip : http://www.dreadlockssite.com/dreadlocks-forums/forum/dreading-methods/75/dreaducation-comprehensive-guide-to-all-things-dready#maintenance"
Dreadlocks,3bodph,monickerr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:29:07 2015 UTC,"Agree here.  I have very curly hair, and tried to go natural, but after 4 months not a thing had started to happen (probably because I'd spent several years leading up to that trying to keep my curls perfectly moisturized).  I eventually had my husband separate my hair into a grid, then I braided each section and twist n ripped each braid as I had time.  I slowly turned my head full of braids into dreads over the course of 4 days or so, taking me about 12 hours total.  Your twisting/ripping would go faster as your hair is much shorter than mine was.  I lost about 2/3 of my length, so something to keep in mind.  Don't be surprised when you lose a noticeable amount of length every time you wash.  After about 8 months mine stopped shrinking and started to grow back out again."

Show her the fun stuff, like beads and hair wraps, but let her know if she changes her mind they'll be hard to get out.  Depending on how you get them, they can be either painful or painless. However, I can't make suggestions since I don't know your daughter's hair type.  Cool thing about this is that little kids can get away with most any style. By the time she can't, her dreads will be mature and looking nice. I know this little boy whose mother just lets his hair dread naturally, and it looks adorable."

Natural dreadlocks are painless, and mostly maintenance free. Washing takes longer, but with a shower hose without the spout, it goes quicker.  I'm not sure that would be the best choice even if she wants them, because if she changes her mind later, brushing them out can be a long and painful process I imagine."

Dreadlocks,3bj7c3,B_Loner,2,Mon Jun 29 19:05:20 2015 UTC,A combination of twist & rip and backcombing
Dreadlocks,3bj7c3,gingerfr0,3,Mon Jun 29 19:10:28 2015 UTC,"They look awesome. What do you mean by ""maintenance""?"
Dreadlocks,3bj7c3,bloohiggs,2,Tue Jun 30 06:01:57 2015 UTC,I went into a dread salon and had them tidy things up and pull in all the loose hairs
Dreadlocks,3bj7c3,icemanakadiablo,2,Tue Jun 30 17:28:46 2015 UTC,"I just looked at your post history and sweet jesus did they get thicker!  Gives me hope, I started out with pencil thin locks and I'm hoping they'll fatten up like yours did"
Dreadlocks,3bl2gy,XdaPrime,3,Tue Jun 30 02:25:34 2015 UTC,"You can start with 4-5 inches of hair and be okay. As long as the person starting them can grasp your hair comfortably, you're good."
Dreadlocks,3bl2gy,gingerfr0,4,Tue Jun 30 11:59:53 2015 UTC,"When measuring, stretch the hair out to full length. But 8in sounds plently long enough. Just know that you'll lose some length so your dreads will probably end up around 5 inches when they're fully dreaded. And if you have proper afro hair I'm sure they'll look awesome. Post some pictures so we can get a better idea of what you're working with."

Dreadlocks,3bf6mi,surrrealistic,2,Sun Jun 28 19:24:04 2015 UTC,Take each dread and start with a dark color at the base and just put 3-4 colors on each dread :) I went lighter blue as I neared the tip. Mixed in some purple throughout.

Dreadlocks,3bf6mi,detroitvinyl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:26:55 2015 UTC,"There is always a risk with bleach of over doing it. I had a professional do it and I won't bleach it again, just add pigment so I'm not concerned with losing any. They are still strong."

Dreadlocks,3bf9p8,axleranda,6,Sun Jun 28 19:10:14 2015 UTC,We bleached it to a level 9. Or like a pale yellow. Dreads still feel the same. My hair is tough :)

Dreadlocks,3bdgnj,DreadedJordan,6,Sun Jun 28 04:29:02 2015 UTC,"I would hesitate to get into the mindset of restarting your dreads for every new chapter of your life, I feel like that could easily result in wanting to start over many times and always feeling like they are holding on to something you want to let go of. Instead, try to see your dreads as more of a reminder of how far you have come, where you started and where you have ended up since then. Embrace their history and your own.   But definitely do a really good deep clean when you are finished with the fast food work, you are probably right about residue and that will help you feel more fresh for your new start."
Dreadlocks,3bdgnj,EmiBoo,4,Sun Jun 28 15:40:01 2015 UTC,"Hey man.  Just wanna start off with saying that it's cool too see that someone has the exact same thought about their dreads/journey. I myself also started my dreads at the beginning of this year as a symbol of growth and adulthood and as they grow, I'll grow with them. Big ups.  Now for your situation, I see what you mean. Kinda getting rid of the old and in with the new specially when you're moving onto something new and fresher.  Just don't listen to others advice/criticism too much. It's your journey after all and it's you and your hair.  Cheers bro."

Dreadlocks,3bdgnj,knottysleeves,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:29:43 2015 UTC,"I definitely am comfortable with dreads. I love them with all my heart, and I feel they really physically represent a lot about me. I do not, however, feel they got the start they deserved. I also feel that I've changed a lot and turned to a very new chapter in my life so perhaps this is for the best. I guess I just really wanna start anew, but having such a connection with my current set it's very hard not to get emotional over it. As they ARE a large part of me after all."
Dreadlocks,3bdgnj,MwamWWilson,4,Sun Jun 28 09:17:32 2015 UTC,"I guess I just really wanna start anew, but having such a connection with my current set it's very hard not to get emotional over it.   You could keep several of your current locks, and comb out / restart the rest. That way you'll have a nice mix of old and new. :-)"
Dreadlocks,3bdgnj,knottysleeves,2,Sun Jun 28 19:33:11 2015 UTC,i dont know what else to say.
Dreadlocks,3bdgnj,knottysleeves,3,Sun Jun 28 09:19:23 2015 UTC,"The great thing about dreads is that everyone's journey is their own and there's no ""right"" or ""best"" way that applies to everyone and every situation.  You've obviously put a lot of thought into this. I always say, follow your heart. It sounds like you want a fresh start (both psychologically and physically).  I've never really understood the default dreadhead mindset that ""one set should be forever"" and all that. Change is a part of life, growth is a part of life. Change is a positive thing if you're doing it for reasons that are right for you and true to you.  I've been through 2 sets and a ""fresh start"" myself. I was SO much happier with my second set, simply because they were new and it was an opportunity to do things differently. (And for psychological reasons because I'd started the first set before a major life change -- keeping that set truly felt like a weight I didn't want to carry anymore.)  If you really want to restart, then don't deny yourself the opportunity to learn and grow and change just because other dreadheads think combing out is blasphemy. It's YOUR hair and YOUR journey. What's the point of keeping a set of locks that don't truly make you happy and you're always thinking ""What if""?"
Dreadlocks,3bdgnj,supfaggot,2,Sun Jun 28 19:28:10 2015 UTC,This is by far the best comment I've received. I think that out look and your advice is quite beautiful. Thank you very much for the words and support. Have the most wonderful day. :)

My dreads were originally bout rebellion, and now i wanna go down the route of maturity(is how i feel about neglect dreads). But i can't throw these dreads out, because they've been with me for all the bad times, they've been my friend... And so i made a decision, to wait it out til their 3rd birthday and cut it off then or don't at all. Maybe you should give yourself a time limit for a decision. I hope the best for you in whatever decision you make, and it'd be nice if you shared what you decided :)"

Wigged me right out: I was so surprised by it and didn't know how to respond. What was even weirder was that it was my server at a pancake place so it kinda grossed me out that she would touch random people's hair and then be bringing people food. My hair is very clean but she doesn't know that.
Dreadlocks,3bahnq,gensyms,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:48:34 2015 UTC,"I've had one person touch my hair, but the way I see it, the prevention is better than the cure.

If somebody asks questions or asks if they can touch them, it's fine. But I don't want some random asshole just grabbing my hair, so yeah.  And the touching doesn't happen a lot, but when it happens, to be honest, I want them to know that it is not ok and if there's a creative way to make them feel uncomfortable, too, then I'm happy to do it."

Dreadlocks,3bahmq,Rekt-Awww,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:24:04 2015 UTC,I know it doesn't wash out immediately but it's not permanent. Otherwise I would suggest you just clip in some colored extensions. You can make your own out of yarn.
Dreadlocks,3bahmq,ellysunshine,7,Sat Jun 27 10:27:47 2015 UTC,"Henna is permanent. You might lose a little bit of colour over a long period of time, but it is very much permanent. It is also extremely difficult to bleach out. Source: I have been henna-ing my hair for over a decade."

Dreadlocks,3bahmq,ellysunshine,2,Sat Jun 27 18:23:17 2015 UTC,"Decades-long henna user here. Henna is the MOST permanent colour out there. Henna bonds to the proteins in your hair -- it can't be bleached out or stripped. (It can be dulled a bit by repeated washing in baking soda, but that will dry your hair out like crazy.)  Do NOT use henna unless you're 100% sure you want to keep it and can live with whatever results you get."
Dreadlocks,3bahmq,knottysleeves,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:05:31 2015 UTC,"It really depends on where you get your henna actually, a lot of places in North America apparently cut it with some not as natural stuff to save costs so definitely do research on the specific brand or mix or whatever before putting it in your hair if you only want natural products!"

So going back at it. Haven't spent any money on any products other than some t-gel shampoo and the microfiber towels I bought from home depot a year ago. Feels good.  I get compliments all the time. People ask me to smoke weed with them (I don't smoke weed though, so that's funny). People speak patois to me thinking I'm rasta or something (I'm american, that's funny too). People touch my hair (I got used to that in italy, italians must have never seen an afro/hightop before). I get to head bang finally! I'm in a band and it's just that much cooler to throw my hair around. The best thing about having locks though is  that it's ME. I finally feel like I have a look that means me. Laid back, a bit twisted, and individual.  Stay well dread heads."

Dreadlocks,3b0vtc,MwamWWilson,6,Thu Jun 25 16:17:33 2015 UTC,Use more (or a higher quality) conditioner to prevent your hair from tangling.

Dreadlocks,3b0vtc,TSIashleigh,4,Thu Jun 25 10:39:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely dreadlocks can form naturally like that. As others have mentioned, make sure you are conditioning and brushing more often. Coconut oil treatments and other things like that can help give dry hair a boost of moisture. Keeping your hair silky will help prevent tangles from forming."
Dreadlocks,3b0vtc,iBeenie,3,Sat Jun 27 03:54:00 2015 UTC,That's exactly how you get dreadlocks. They just happen naturally on all hair types. That's why brushes and combs were invented. ;)
Dreadlocks,3b0vtc,traginus,2,Thu Jun 25 15:52:41 2015 UTC,Or get a hair cut if your hair is a bit on the damaged side.
Dreadlocks,3b0vtc,allenplantsberg,2,Thu Jun 25 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"Even using a leave in spray conditioner should solve this issue as well as brushing more regularly...Also, any shampoo with lots of chemicals(so drugstore or even professional stuff) makes my hair smoother, straighter, and even thinner so I'd say that and leave in...

I think it might need a couple zig-zag bends to hold really well, but the end result is the little jewel or flower or whatever sitting on your hair.  I tried it out with the hook-style dangly earrings too, those might work better since they are usually longer, the U-bend will likely make them stay in better."

It's like long bangs and looks cute when my hair is in a ponytail so I don't mind.  Also, since they are natural there is some some stray fuzziness here and there from new growth that hasn't decided which dread it wants to join with.  It's fun to watch how they evolve as they grow. Some decide they want to grow together and make fat ones, some migrate over time as they join in with new growth... I have one that started out at the front near the top of my head that has over time migrated to the back of my head above the nape of my neck!"

Dreadlocks,3aog3p,jpGrind,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:06:20 2015 UTC,"Is there any trick to getting it to stand up like this? I have an undercut that I'd like to wear like this, but I'm not sure it's possible."
Dreadlocks,3aog3p,jpGrind,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:23:08 2015 UTC,"I didn't choose the pineapple life, the pineapple life chose me. Nah just kidding, really all I do is bend over so all my dreads are hanging down and I gather them up and secure them with my hairband. So really I guess it's a matter of doing a high pony tail instead of a low pony tail."
Dreadlocks,3aptf6,cable1oo,2,Mon Jun 22 15:00:27 2015 UTC,"Rolling shampoo (or any product) into your locks drives it deep into the cores. I'd be concerned that all the shampoo wouldn't rinse out. Just because your dreads feel fully-rinsed on the surface doesn't mean the cores are rinsing clean, especially now that your locks are close to a year old.  But a deep-clean soak every few months should take care of any residues."
Dreadlocks,3aptf6,knottysleeves,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"While they're 10 months old, they look and feel far from it. I've seen 1 and 2-monthers with more mature locks than mine. Just looking for something to speed it up!"
Dreadlocks,3aptf6,EmiBoo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:42:59 2015 UTC,I find that rolling while they are wet or damp works better than doing it dry. I'm not really sure that it does much to help them lock faster but it does keep them rounder so they don't go all flat after sleeping on them every night or whatever
Dreadlocks,3aptf6,hipposlovepineapple,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:11:40 2015 UTC,"No!  Bad idea.  And whatever shampoo you use to wash your hair needs to be sulfate free.  I recommend Natures Gate products because they are relatively inexpensive compared to other natural shampoos, and the tea tree variety is excellent for preventing dandruff, a common problem with dreads since your scalp isn't getting daily stimulation from a hairbrush.  Also, while your dreads are forming, wash no more than twice a week.  When you get out of the shower spritz your hair with sea salt water and scrunch it a little.  I'm assuming that you have very straight hair like mine since you say it's taking a long time, so I recommend finding a nice wool or wool blend tam or slouchy beanie.  Wear it all the time... live in it, even wearing it to bed, for at least a month maybe two.  Once it starts locking up more on its own then move your concentration to rolling and shaping.  If you are going for natty dreads, if you start rolling to soon you will get lots of breakage at the roots that you may not immediately notice but will result in dread shedding later on.  Hope this helps.  Good luck!"

Dreadlocks,3ajjcj,IsaacaasI,6,Sat Jun 20 22:49:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Their birth and growth was for a very long time, emotionally difficult.  So perhaps they suit me for the same reason that a river defines the river's banks which in turn define the river.  I endured years of being treated as a homeless and/or crazy person -- and learned to accept myself even when others didn't.  And those dreadlocks are an outward manifestation of having survived that emotional struggle.  I feel that dreadlocks are the human version of antlers: they say to the world ""I've seen some shit.  Been through hell.  And I'm still here motherfuckers! Still here."""

Dreadlocks,3ajjcj,supfaggot,5,Sun Jun 21 03:03:12 2015 UTC,"Well i feel like it's more of a way of thinking. Every time i started dreads, I've wanted it to be dreads. Which left me feeling insecure, at times; and now its been two years and 3 months which is the most patient I've been. They look fucking awesome, and at the same time i don't care what others think. But whenever i see someone go through the path of neglect, it looks as if they've fully become content with themselves, like they're a true adult, they know who they are. When i look at my dreads it's still the young me, doing it as a form of rebellion. But yeah, i can't just chop em off at the same time, because i love my dreads. We'll see though in the near future."

Dreadlocks,3al8ym,3dweirdo,3,Sun Jun 21 19:42:18 2015 UTC,"They're ok, I remember seeing Zendaya Coles & Raven Symone had them & I'd say they looked pretty good on them, but I also say they're very feminine and mainly for women (like most other hair extensions) and I think a man having them would be strange. I know a lot of women like to change their hair up frequently, I can't really hate em for wanting to try out a certain look just because they chose one of the easier routes to achieve it. Not everyone has the time or confidence to go through the full journey of locking their hair, and I suppose synthetics could be a reasonable alternative to expedite the process (like crocheting & using fancy products & whatnot). Lots of people here make a big deal about dreads being a symbol/ lifestyle but the truth is it's just a hairstyle and it only has as much depth/meaning as you personally choose to give it. I believe people should have the freedom to do what makes them happy (especially when it doesn't effect/hurt me) so I won't put down people who choose to get faux locs the same way I won't put down white dread heads  for choosing to have dreads. That being said, I'd give your hair a 6.5/10, to me they look like a bunch of carrots lol"

Dreadlocks,3al8ym,Caged_Sinner,4,Mon Jun 22 07:04:06 2015 UTC,"I think synthetics look bad, like nasty Barbie hair.  Plus I think they cheapen locks for everybody else.  Locks are about being natural and not needing to give in to conventional beauty standards. Gluing plastic to your head to fake dreads to fit in just seems misguided, and thoughtless. But I'm only saying this because you asked. Usually I just shudder and keep scrolling, because you can do whatever you want to your body, and my opinion shouldn't matter."

Dreadlocks,3aj2zb,cable1oo,2,Mon Jun 22 15:18:56 2015 UTC,"If your hair is naturally straight or only slightly wavy you will always have a bit of frizziness to your dreads even after they are locked well.  The shape of the individual hairs prevents them from binding as well as curly hair. Salt water spray after showering will help a little.  Wearing a tam nonstop (even to bed) for a month or two will help even more.  Don't sweat it, it will look great anyway.... just be patient and ride out the early awkward phases.  If you can make it a year it does nothing but get better from then on."

Dreadlocks,3ahg3k,MwamWWilson,3,Sat Jun 20 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"When you take the strings out, yes, your sections might unravel a bit, because they're not actually dreaded yet.  As I mentioned, the strings are actually PREVENTING your hair from locking up. Hair needs to move around in order to tangle and knot.  Don't be afraid of them ""unravelling"" and looking messy. It's a necessary part of the process. The longer you keep the bands in, the more you're just delaying the locking process overall."
Dreadlocks,3ahg3k,knottysleeves,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:44:00 2015 UTC,when i first put in dreads they reccomended using bands for the first month. (previous set)so yes its time regardless ones opinion on bands.

I have a couple friends that went to school for cosmetology and went there to be a partner to cut my hair at the time way before getting my dreads (hey, free hair cut!).

Dreadlocks,3agdt4,thebacon8tor,3,Fri Jun 19 22:50:31 2015 UTC,"First, stop using the baking soda immediately. You already have baking soda build-up, so all you're doing is adding to it every time you wash. :-)  Second, the vinegar rinse is what neutralizes the leftover baking soda. If you don't do a final vinegar rinse, then baking soda gets left behind and builds up (as you've discovered). Do a diluted vinegar soak ASAP. Soak for a good 20 minutes and swish, squeeze, and swish those locks around while soaking so the vinegar gets into your cores. Then rinse with fresh water. Good luck."
Dreadlocks,3agdt4,knottysleeves,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:13:00 2015 UTC,Update! Tried the ACV and it's worse. It's like way way worse than it was. The build up is way more dense now and some of my dreads are so fucking stuffed with it they're literally rigid. This is gross. About to give inane shave
Dreadlocks,3agdt4,knottysleeves,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:29:22 2015 UTC,"Ugh, that sounds awful. Plain baking soda build-up (even a lot of it) should NOT make your dreads rock-hard, especially after multiple deep-cleans and vinegar rinses.

Dreadlocks,3agdt4,hipposlovepineapple,2,Sat Jun 20 18:20:51 2015 UTC,"You said you were going to shave them off anyway, right? :-) If you can sacrifice one for the purpose of diagnosing the issue, then you have a chance of saving the rest.  You don't have to cut the whole thing off, just snip it in the middle of the worst ""rigid"" area so you get a proper cross-section of the grossness."

Dreadlocks,3agdt4,hipposlovepineapple,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:40:31 2015 UTC,"That's the problem.  Use white vinegar and ditch the baking soda.  Here is what I recommend.  Work warm coconut oil into your hair and let it sit for an hour.  Go shampoo your hair with a natural sulfate free shampoo, I recommend Nature's Gate tea tree shampoo.  Wash two or three time to remove all oil.  Mix 2 cups white vinegar with a gallon of water and use it as a rinse."

Dreadlocks,3agdt4,cable1oo,3,Sat Jun 20 01:24:15 2015 UTC,"Bust out the Dawn dish soap. Dilute a bit and scrub it into your dreads, building up a lather. Rinse thoroughly in the shower and repeat. If that doesn't strip everything out of your hair, I would suggest you might have something other than residue, like built up dandruff or something, though I imagine the dish soap would get that out too."
Dreadlocks,3agdt4,Carsandsarcasm,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:32:25 2015 UTC,No!  Bad advice. Dish soap gets trapped in your dreads and impossible to rinse out 100% and could lead to mildew problems later on.  Sulfate fee shampoo or Dr Bronners/castile soap only!
Dreadlocks,3agdt4,hipposlovepineapple,2,Tue Jun 23 19:34:06 2015 UTC,"With the amount of residue OP is experiencing, it's going to be the only thing to get all that out. After the initial dish soap wash, they can return to residue free shampoos and the rest will come on out. It's not something I would recommend for regular washing but for an emergency knock-it-loose dish soap really strips all the nasties out."

Dreadlocks,3adsog,Yeeitsjayvee,2,Fri Jun 19 08:23:47 2015 UTC,"I have used it, but I always took it out before getting my hair wet.  Acrylic is cheap and offers lots of variety of color.  Of course I've wrapped mine with cotton yarn and thread and made sure I took those out before getting my hair wet as well. It makes the hair under the wrap hard to dry and it wasn't worth the risk of mold/mildew so I always rewrap instead of chancing that.  Maybe someone else could clarify if leaving the wraps in is actually ok.... because I'd like to know as well."
Dreadlocks,3adsog,thirtytwoflavors,2,Fri Jun 19 14:27:22 2015 UTC,"As a knitter, I have a strong dislike of acrylic yarn, but it probably wouldn't be too bad as a wrap, just as long as you take it out before you wash your hair. Cotton would be the best if you want it to be easily removable, as wool or even a wool blend would probably get sucked into the dread pretty quickly. I've only ever wrapped my dreads with cotton embroidery floss, but I would be interested to try a thicker yarn sometime!"
Dreadlocks,3adsog,that_hippie,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:54:24 2015 UTC,I've used all sorts of yarn and threads for wraps and leave them in till I get bored. Usually around 3 months. I would go for the softer acrylics. My fave wrap which I think I'll keep it hand spun art yarn made from wool that my sister made. Have fun!
Dreadlocks,3adsog,traginus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:31:05 2015 UTC,NO!  Don't even wear a tam or scarf made of acrylic yarn.  The little pilings on the acrylic will bond to your dreads and be near impossible to get out.  I use hemp yarn or embroidery floss for wraps.  If you want permanent wraps go with embroidery floss because it will look good longer and not fade.
Dreadlocks,3adsog,hipposlovepineapple,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:58:36 2015 UTC,Choice! Thanks for the advice my bro

Would i have to bleach them more and then dye them or would it work with how they are now? Also any suggestions for products would be appreciated :)
Dreadlocks,3aawlo,hipposlovepineapple,3,Thu Jun 18 16:50:39 2015 UTC,"I don't have dreads yet, but I do have blood red hair. I'd recommend bleaching and rinsing first and then dipping the end in manic panic vampire red or SFX blood red.  I leave my red dye in for 3 hours plus wrapped in glad wrap."
Dreadlocks,3aboq5,Dhibn,2,Thu Jun 18 20:12:31 2015 UTC,"It's doable, but the dreads will constantly be rubbing against all the loose hair and sucking it in fairly quickly. So you'd have to separate them a lot (probably daily)."
Dreadlocks,3aboq5,knottysleeves,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:42:29 2015 UTC,I thought so! End up with one giant dread on the top of the head haha :) Thanks for the answer!
Dreadlocks,3aboq5,knottysleeves,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:45:53 2015 UTC,Can confirm an unintentional congo at the top of the head is the absolute worst. So painful to fix!
Dreadlocks,3aboq5,blackbeltnerd,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:56:07 2015 UTC,"yes, it would. i mean obviously to each their own and you can totally do partial dreadlocks if you want, but it never seems worth it to me. i tried it myself (on the bottom though as you said) and they were constantly combining with my regular hair, it was difficult to wash my hair the amount that i should but not wash my dreadlocks, my roots got crazy, and overall it looked like shit. a few of my friends tried it too with less than stellar results (both on the bottom, on the top, and randomly throughout). in my opinion if you want dreads you gotta just go for it and do your full head"
Dreadlocks,3aboq5,blackbeltnerd,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:42:40 2015 UTC,"Hmm that is tricky. I thought so, it was mainly since I'd have to hide them! Perhaps waiting until I can get a full head is the way to go then :) Thanks for your help"
Dreadlocks,3aboq5,blackbeltnerd,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"i figured, but honestly, dreadlocks are hard to hide! it's probably best to wait until you can do your whole head without worry :) may i ask why you'd have to hide them?"
Dreadlocks,3aboq5,Carsandsarcasm,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:50:16 2015 UTC,Mainly because that was the bargain I had with mother. I convinced her if I got partial I'll be able to hide them within my next of hair :P
Dreadlocks,3aboq5,dancingsludge,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"ahhhh gotcha that makes sense! well hey you could always do partial to start off with, give it a shot, and if it doesn't work just go for it! :P"
Dreadlocks,3aboq5,dancingsludge,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:07:22 2015 UTC,"Dreads at the bottom of the head are easier to wash. Dreaded and undreaded hair requires different washing routines. Undreaded hair will want conditioner, for example, and it's easier to keep a couple of dreads at the nape separate while showering than if they were at the top.  Everything I've read about partial dreads says, high maintenance. Not just washing, but separating, as has been said."
Dreadlocks,3aboq5,dancingsludge,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:46:25 2015 UTC,"Hey, I've got several partials throughout my hair in different positions. I've never had a problem with any of mine, I don't really seperate them, I wash my hair daily as normal and still condition (just avoiding the dreads). The only part that drives me a bit nuts is not being able to run a brush through my whole hair but you get used to it. I see people talking about them sucking in all the surrounding hair but I haven't had that problem so it's possibly to do with hair type, I have fine, wavy hair if that helps."

Dreadlocks,39rqgu,ruby_saffron,3,Sun Jun 14 02:51:38 2015 UTC,"your dreadlocks are doing exactly what dreadlocks do: they're maturing. the loops are normal, and so are the fuzzies. if you wear them down more, they'll mature faster. when they're tied up they don't move around as much, which doesn't necessarily prevent knots from forming but hinders the process a bit.   as for the extra hair from your pregnancy... they're not going to fall out, not after 10 months. they're permanantly knotted into your dreads at this point. that means they'll be especially heavy, tho, so if you get maintenance you might want to consider thinning them out a bit if anything (imo). otherwise, leave them be. hair only falls out of dreads if it's pulled out or if there is something wrong with your dreads."
Dreadlocks,39rqgu,PoshyX,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:49:27 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks a lot for your advice! I'm going to let them be and continue maturing without maintenance. The pregnancy hairs are more like loose hairs in between the dreads, they came in after my original hair was dreaded. But I guess if they do fall out it won't hurt anything."
Dreadlocks,39rqgu,PoshyX,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:51:35 2015 UTC,"ah i see. what'll most likely happen is some will fall out while some will knot into the existing nearby dreads. careful not to let the hairs knot into more than one dread otherwise they might congo, so separate often (unless you're into that. :P)"
Dreadlocks,39rqgu,Cassassinn,2,Tue Jun 16 00:34:52 2015 UTC,"I started mine a bit after my pregnancy(2 months), and I didn't really notice any extra hair loss.   Your dreads look good. If you wanted to tighten them, you can, but it's really personal preference. I like crocheting mine once every few months, just to pull lose hairs in. I generally leave the loops alone, I've crocheted them in, but they don't really bother me much!   When I do my tightening, I just focus mostly an inch up from the root where the dread begins. I find it gets weird there. I leave the mid shaft alone, then re back comb the tip and crochet.  I'm just coming to the point where my dreads are starting to have a clubbed end instead of loose :) pm me if you have any questions about crocheting and tightening yourself!"
Dreadlocks,39rqgu,teaqueen,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:44:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you! That's great that you didn't notice any hair loss!  The areas I think need tightening are the loops. They still look like regular hair and I start to feel discouraged that they will ever pull into the dread body on their own. I mean is that actually possible? If I just need to be patient, I will, it just feels like the loops don't dread up.  I know a lot of people like blunted tips, but I enjoy having the little tails on them :-) the ends are pretty well knotted up and not in danger of falling out."

Dreadlocks,39ow77,pushthebus_,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:42:29 2015 UTC,"Is there anything I should do to my naturally curly/knotty hair before? I've read about drying my hair out.   A lot of people will recommend starting to wash your hair less frequently and maybe an ACV rinse. They are both good ideas but, in my experience, not really essential. If your hair is pretty greasy tho you might want to try out both before getting started to help them hold together over the first few weeks without having to wash them as much.   I would also recommend looking in to getting yourself some kind of comfortable hair washing tub. I have an inflatable one and it is a total godsend for deep cleans.    What things should I notice or look for in the first days/weeks/months?   Make sure you spend some time separating them or you'll pretty quickly end up with a big matte of locks that are stuck together. It's a lot easier to separate if you do it regularly, I find after a shower is easiest. You may have a lot of frizz, embrace it. It will likely calm itself a bit as your dreads lock up and absorb the loose hairs but you can use aloe or coconut oil to control it a bit (just go easy on it, too much coconut oil feels pretty slimy and unpleasant as I accidentally discovered a couple weeks ago. You also don't want to use them too often as it will build up between deep cleans.)   Mostly at this stage just worry about keeping things separated and sectioned the way you want them and keep them dry between washes to avoid mold/dreadrot.    Where do you get your beads from?   I buy them from Etsy, lots of great sellers and tons of designs. You can start your search here but you might want to wait until you have some idea of the size and thickness of your dreads. They will change a fair bit over the next year but it can be pretty hard to guess sizes beforehand.    What should I expect with having dreadlocks?   In my experience; expect the unexpected: Depending on how long they take to lock up, you will start getting compliments on them at some point. These compliments will almost always come from the most unexpected places at the least likely of times.   Enjoy the journey and take lots of pictures!"
Dreadlocks,39ow77,EmiBoo,2,Sat Jun 13 14:18:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP but thanks for this post! I'm dealing with a lot of frizz and loose hairs right now and struggling to embrace it. I love looking at photos of other dreadheads on this subreddit and some look so formed and tight that it's depressing. I had mine sectioned and started with crochet method. I'm trying to decide if I should go back to get the loose hairs tucked in (""maintenance"") or go with it. I kind of like how the extra hair makes them look fuller, but it also gives me a frizz halo! Will they really get drawn into the dread eventually?"
Dreadlocks,39ow77,ruby_saffron,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:51:06 2015 UTC,"Yes and no: what I was talking about earlier was long loose hairs that somehow missed being caught up in dreads or were pulled free at some point. Those will get absorbed into one dread or another over time likely without having to do anything. The halo of frizz is a different story and seems to be somewhat unavoidable unless you are willing to put in a good bit of somewhat frequent maintenance. For the frizz halo I just use the aloe/coconut oil as mentioned above, when necessary. Luckily I work in the beer industry so most people don't really care if I look a little rough around the edges!"

Dreadlocks,39is2w,Enng,2,Fri Jun 12 00:29:37 2015 UTC,I was curious for some input on how the dreadlock community on reddit feels about starting dreads with 3 strand twists.  Also I designed the sectioning myself and my girlfriend did the twisting so there will be no loctician involved.  Any information that you guys think will help us as we go through this process would be greatly appreciated.  Also how do you guys feel about the flat top dreads look?
Dreadlocks,39is2w,White__Whale,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:32:22 2015 UTC,"I like the look, kind of reminds me of Chris Douglas-Roberts (NBA player). The three strand twists are unique too, gives it a different look than the usual two strands."

Dreadlocks,39evcd,convex101,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:38:32 2015 UTC,"I've dyed my dreads. Bleaching will actually help the dreads along, as it dries the hair out. The trickiest part is setting the dye into the dreads and then washing it out. You might have to work the dye in a little with your fingers like the dread is a sponge. Then when you rinse just make sure to really really rinse it all out to not irritate your scalp or hair with residual chemicals. My dreads have done well with dying and I know many others who have had success!!"
Dreadlocks,39evcd,clzair,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:27:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's the amount of rinsing and rubbing that is the danger with dying.

Dreadlocks,39ceol,Dlynnec89,8,Wed Jun 10 20:41:44 2015 UTC,"I combed mine out about a month ago, they were 2.5 years old. I'm a white woman, american, and of irish ancestors. I have straight, so-smooth-it-won't-tangle, long brown hair. I decided I wanted dreads quite a few years ago and on my 3rd try (after a couple years or tears and failure) they locked. My final goal was for the bases to lock and dread on their own because the manual labor involved with upkeeping my dreads was nuts. If the roots wouldn't lock, I wasn't going to keep the hairstyle.   In the end, they did lock and it was great. I decided, once they reached that point, that I was done with them. It may sound strange, but that was kind of my goal. I had failed twice before and the total time spent struggling was nearly 5 years. But once they did it, I had proven that I COULD do it. And so, my journey was complete.  It took most of a day to have them combed out. We went through a LOT of conditioner and a LOT of concentrated dish soap. After my first shower, my hair was IMMEDIATELY back to being so smooth it won't tangle. I pulled out and tossed SO MUCH HAIR!   I won't lie, pulling the first brush through my hair in 2.5 years as MAGNIFICENT! I do miss them, but I'd made my journey and reached my destination. I learned so much, about hair, myself, societal pressures, cultural acceptance, and so much more. :)"

I hope that doesn't become a self-fulfilling prophecy. :-(  If you do your research, have realistic expectations about the first weeks / months / year, and find an experienced loctician you're comfortable with, then you'll likely be thrilled & excited about your new locks and your new lifestyle.  Also, I wouldn't say a hair professional ""You're expensive and I might hate your work, so please don't do anything that I can't reverse."" Just... no.  There are lots of posts explaining why people decided to comb out -- the search bar will help you find them. :-) Good luck!"
Dreadlocks,39ceol,dieorlivetrying,2,Wed Jun 10 20:56:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not approaching them thinking I might comb them out--I've just always done really REALLY thorough research. It took me 6 months before I got my first tattoo because I wanted to know all the pros and cons and possible outcomes. I'm not blind to the fact that not everyone who gets dreads likes them. I just want to be well informed.   I am also estimating around $500 for this service, so I'm not money shy. I'm well prepared."
Dreadlocks,39ceol,PoshyX,7,Wed Jun 10 21:36:10 2015 UTC,"$500 seems a lil steep =\ I think that's wayyy over priced. I had my dreads done by my mom but I also looked into dread salons for shits and giggles to see what the price was. Most places I saw charged about $200 for a full set of dreads and $60 per hr for dread maintenance, 3-6 months after you got them done. I also noticed some places charged by the dread. It would be much more cost efficient if you got your hair sectioned professionally and had a backcombing party with some homies. That way when people say ""Who dreaded your hair?"" (common question) you can say that your loved ones helped you out. If money isn't an issue then you could do the salon way, but I still think $500 is way too much.  TL/DR: $500 is overpay"

Dreadlocks,39ceol,supfaggot,8,Thu Jun 11 03:03:40 2015 UTC,"Even if you get them ""done professionally"", they're still going to look fuzzy, crazy, unpredictable, and not ""like dreadlocks"" to most people.  If you don't have the ""ability to sit through the neglect method"", please understand that even after they're done by backcombing or crocheting (or especially twist and rip), there's still a lot of ""neglect"" left for you to sit through.  The kicker is: pretty much everything you can do to temporarily make them ""look like dreadlocks"" for the first few months will also be stalling the locking process.  There is one word that describes dreadlocks: patience. Your dreads may look beautiful after you leave the salon, but when you wake up the next morning, don't be surprised if they're a fuzzy, frizzy nightmare that you'll have to live with (or fight an uphill battle against) for many months to come.  I'm not in any way trying to discourage you from getting dreadlocks, I just want you to know what you're in for from my own experiences.  So to answer your question: I combed them out the first time because I didn't have the patience or self-esteem to live with baby dreads. The second time was after they were looking pretty good...but it was for a job interview (and I got that job, luckily).  My current boss just gave me the go-ahead, so I'm on my third set. I cut my last set off 8 years ago, and my current set is only 3 days old. They look absolutely ""terrible"" by ""neatness"" standards...but I love them for what they are, and will be.  So don't be afraid to dive in...just know that the water is deep."

Dreadlocks,39ceol,Midgar-Zolom,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:51:50 2015 UTC,"a month after they're dreaded is perfect timing imo. in my experience that's about when they start to look ""disgusting"" and insanely messy and frizzy. i'm only a bit over a month in and i have an immense amount of loose hairs and frizz and i already have new growth (cuz i am/was a trichotillomaniac. since dreading my hair i've stopped pulling thankfully) that refuses to lock. i mean they're been frizzy since day one, but it just got progressively worse since. i think it's peaked about now. lol"
Dreadlocks,39ceol,Mother_of_Smaug,2,Tue Jun 16 01:08:31 2015 UTC,"Got mine done by a friend after reading up online and didn't bother with sectioning. This meant that I always had heaps of loose hair that wouldn't stay in a dread due to the way they sat (even after I started getting proper maintenance done). After 10 years I just became tired of them being messy all the time. I probably wouldn't have cared too much but I work in a corporate office so I'd feel really self conscious about it. So I combed them out (by myself, it took ages) back in November.   When I did it I was sure that I would immediately get a new set put in properly but now it's June and I still have 'normal' hair. I do think that I'll have them again eventually though. I really miss not having to do anything besides wash+dry."
Dreadlocks,39ceol,Mother_of_Smaug,2,Wed Jun 10 21:33:24 2015 UTC,"I got mine out cause they were too stiff and heavy, the method i had used was crochet method and holy fuck it wasnt the method for me. My dreads weren't even long, and they were heavy. They were super tight at the scalp, and tugged wrong at random points in my day. I had em in for 6 months with that method and yeah....iterating it wasn't for me..... But yeah i took em out and redid them from a buzzcut months later. Started at 3 inches and just tried to create knots as much as possible while sectioning them. I used a flea clmb to back comb and very very minimal crocheting at this point(cause i learned tight as fuck dreads is not good). My hair grew out as dreads from then(finished result 1/2 inch dreads) which made me look like the goddamned buddha to then goku until finally someone said nice dreads 6 months later. Its been 2 years since i started, and its been a year and a half since someone acknowledged my dreads as actual dreads. All imma say bout getting em done at a loctician, man just pay someone to strategically section em for you, so they grow in places you want em to grow out when you dread em;its cheaper and if possible you could section em yourself with the help of a friend. There really isn't much rules to dreads other than be patient, keep em clean, and stop caring about others opinions unless its positive. Uhh loose and stray hairs are fine, they are good and help strengthen your dreads. But if you're looking for a uniformed look, I'd say just be patient. Wait 6 months after you initially dread em and then get the maintenance done so they have time to form naturally at first. The most you can do during that point is just seperate them."
Dreadlocks,39ceol,linus_5pacehead,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:27:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! This was incredibly helpful and insightful. When you say you had the crochet method done, did they crochet the whole dread, or just near the roots? It seems like you would backcomb the whole strand, then crochet the roots. Is that what you meant? I'm thinking backcombing might be the preferred method for me just because it yields the semi-quickest results to where you can see they are supposed to be dreads."
Dreadlocks,39ceol,linus_5pacehead,2,Thu Jun 11 11:01:18 2015 UTC,"Lol i crocheted the whole thing tightly....big mistake, you need to leave room for em to knot up on their own, so they can bend freely instead of just stick up as random hair mass just pulling at your scalp. As for methods for dreads to look like dreads quickly, its really not up to you lol, it's up to your dreads. I've seen dudes where its been a year or two and it still didn't look like dreads, some gave up, some continued and for those who continued well they achieved dreads. It's really just a patience game."
Dreadlocks,39ceol,NayaJY,2,Thu Jun 11 12:39:07 2015 UTC,"Nope. I should have, though.  My friend did sectioning was about 4.5 to 5 inches wide by .5 inches tall in the middle. They were all triangle shapes. It was awful. Instead of combing it out (which would have been the intelligent thing to do), I spent almost 6 months tearing apart and combining my dreads until they looked like neglect sections.   It was dumb, but I know that my hair will grow out now in sections that don't suck. And they are all different sizes. I like them now, but damn."
Dreadlocks,39ceol,NayaJY,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:42:51 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness. That's a lot of work. When you comb them out, do you just sit there with a brush/comb or do you apply any oils or tonics or conditioners that will help brush them out?"

I am 5 months in and they are a lot messier and have too many loops for me but I'm slowly taming them to where I want as they slowly dread more naturally. I am probably going to have some professional maintenance done soon to help with the loops but other than that I love they way they are dreading now. I did set them back a bit by taking my hair from a light red/natural blonde ombre thing to platinum so they are a bit fuzzy again at the moment but I'm sticking it out for a year, that's the deal then I shall see if the two years of planning and putting them in were worth it :)"

Dreadlocks,39ceol,Keegsonthemtn,2,Thu Jun 11 10:55:20 2015 UTC,"Well I like the thicker dreads my husband is ok with smaller ones so mine came out about sharpie size in general, some bigger some smaller, I am white, female, a bit past shoulder length hair, and I have 62 (I just counted them for the first time) I haven't posted pictures of them yet but I plan to soonish. And we just kind of separated them bigger or smaller depending on what way my hair wanted to go so some are tiny to me so about a pencil size so that adds quite a few for me."
Dreadlocks,39ceol,WelshElf,2,Thu Jun 11 23:27:00 2015 UTC,I'm on my third set of locs now.  The first set I didn't really like the way they looked and the method I used wasn't good for my hair type.  The second set I took out because I missed my natural hair (I have a super curly afro). I've had this third set in for almost 8 months now and I'm obsessssed with them! No plans of taking this set down any time soon. Good luck on your dreadlock journey and have fun!!
Dreadlocks,39ceol,cassiopeia1280,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:05:39 2015 UTC,"When you say ""you didn't like the way they looked,"" can you elaborate? It seems like sectioning is a huge part of the planning process that will result in happy and organized dreads later on. Was that it, or were they too big/small?"
Dreadlocks,39ehsw,detroitvinyl,2,Thu Jun 11 04:56:27 2015 UTC,"Easiest way is by interlocking. (Normally this isn't a great install method, but you're only leaving them in for a couple days, so there's no worry about the synth dread congo-ing with your natural one.)  Basically, thread your natural dreadlock into the loop of the synth; slide the synth up to your natural dread's root; then weave your natural dread through the loop two or three times.  Alternately, if your synth dreads have a long tail (or you can sew one on) and you want a cleaner look, here's a great tutorial from Raging Roots Studio of attaching synth to existing dreads."

You can goop it up with aloe, though.  It kinda works.  I'm just kinda anti-goop."

It's something I usually take if I am going away from home for an extended period.   Not sure where you live, but I go to weirdsistas in Melbourne (they are also gaining a bigger footprint across Australia too) for any maintenance. They have an awesome product called LokkUp (http://www.weirdsistas.com/shop/lokkup-dread-locking-spray) and they do international postage. Has a very nice smell to it as well."

Someone with residue-free, squeaky-clean locks probably wouldn't feel the need for your services, right? :-) You are almost guaranteed to get clients who have dread rot, unfortunately that's just the nature of the business. Not everyone has the same level of education regarding washing & dread care, or access to non-residue shampoos. Some people might not even have regular access to clean water, or for whatever reason can't wash as often as they'd like. Etc.  Raging Roots Studio's website has several recipes for mildew-killing deep-clean soaks. Read through their huge Dreaducation knowledge base, you'll find lots of great information there on dealing with dread rot.   BTW, I totally understand your wanting to rant, but publicly calling a potential client's locks ""atrocities"" and ""messy as fuck"" isn't very professional. :-)"

If it's really been that long since he last washed his hair he'll probably need to start slow. His scalp is probably not producing much oil at this point and it will take some time to readjust to proper cleanings. Good luck getting him sorted, if you can fix him up it will be a good demonstration of what your business is capable of at least!"

Dreadlocks,38x9g3,axleranda,2,Sun Jun 7 19:09:02 2015 UTC,"Lately I've been doing more neglect and I have had to separate them a bit. But rubbing them has made them separate fairly well on its own.

Dreadlocks,38wudm,bignick07,3,Sun Jun 7 14:47:17 2015 UTC,"Looks like a great start! :)  I'm not an expert so this is just my opinion based on what worked for me. You might have to separate them quite often, check your scalp/roots at least every few days or maybe even more often. Then you'll be able to prevent them from becoming to entangled.   About the loose ends, I would say just time (annoying answer I know). Be patient about the entire process, as it can be quite a long one. You could also use a crochet hook to secure them into the dread."
Dreadlocks,38wudm,axleranda,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:27:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I knew time was the answer I was going to get before I even postedXD I've got a crochet hook just not the know-how on how to use it. I'll look into it thanks!

Dreadlocks,38smgd,anwarhahj,2,Sat Jun 6 22:17:15 2015 UTC,"You can make them out of wood veneer. This is an easy method because you just wrap the veneer in a tube around a pencil, dowel rod or other object similar in diameter to the dread in question, affix adhesive and tie it with some string till it dries.   PROS: It doesn't take much wood working skills, veneer is cheap, and you can also use materials like nacre or shell. You can also choose the thickness by deciding how many layers to wrap.  CONS: To make a stiff cuff, you need to use a few layers of veneer. This may make the cuff pretty annoying to sleep on if it's close to your skull. :/ Also depending where you live, it may be hard to find nice natural sealants or lacquers to coat the finished product for water protection."

I honestly believe I would not have been accepted if I had dreads beforehand. It's just so competitive and schools will disqualify you for any reason. As soon as I got my acceptance, I started dreading! I left my bangs undreaded and I just keep them in a bun with a thick headband when I'm at school (as tidy as possible). At work it doesn't matter because I always have my hair under a surgical bonnet and a disposable surgical cap.   Like you, I am also concerned about job placement after I finish my degree. My goal is to do the best I can in school and move to a more liberal part of the country, but I'll just have to see how it goes when I graduate. If I find that my hair really interferes with my career, I would be willing to cut it off. Until then, I like the way I look, hubby thinks I'm hot, and they are so much easier to maintain than my crazy, frizzy, undreaded hair!  Good luck, OP.

Then I worked at jimmy johns as an in shop sandwich artisan for a few months, and i had to tie my hair back into a ponytail and wear a visor but i had no issues with getting an interview or getting hired. Now i currently work at a doggie daycare and again have had no issues at all with fellow coworkers or management about my hair, if anything it helps me stand out from the regular crowd, but i have a good work ethic so that speaks for itself"

Nice knots at the roots and tips, but a whole section of loose, untangled hair in between. They eventually knotted up by themselves, and it was actually really fun to be able to see it eating itself over the course of several weeks.  So just give it some time, they will work themselves out and learn how to be real dreads!"

Dreadlocks,38mnuz,xhephaestusx,2,Fri Jun 5 06:29:22 2015 UTC,"This'll happen, probably best to get used to it.   Because of the nature of how hair actually locks itself, it's never going to happen evenly. Some bits will lock faster than other, some will drag the process out for a long time. 4 months is still very young, and from the picture it's actually looking pretty healthy.   I'd suggest keeping an eye on it, if it gets really bad to the point where it's fraying or hairs are actually being released from the dread, maybe sort out some crochet equipment."
Dreadlocks,38mnuz,Silverslade1,2,Fri Jun 5 05:25:53 2015 UTC,"it's just a baby!! as someone else said 4 months is nothing in dread time, give it another 6 months and it'll dread up :) keep palmrolling it!"
Dreadlocks,38mnuz,blackbeltnerd,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:40:40 2015 UTC,"So my dreads are just over four months old, but I have one or two like this that worry me. There are a few knots under my thumb and a nice bit up at the top, but this whole middle section is completely un-knotted. Not a single tangle.   Is this ok? Will it eventually knot up all over?  Most of my other dreads look great or have a really solid core mat where I can tell good knots have formed and all the little strays will eventually get pulled in... But not this guy.  Suggestions?"
Dreadlocks,38mnuz,gensyms,6,Fri Jun 5 05:09:16 2015 UTC,Four months is like 12 seconds in dread-time.    It'll all come together if you just give it a minute.
Dreadlocks,38mnuz,MwamWWilson,2,Fri Jun 5 12:04:10 2015 UTC,i had a dread that i thought would be cool to incorperate a little braid near the root. over the course of five months it completely fell out. twelve months later its half and half.
Dreadlocks,38mnuz,jcw90pl,2,Fri Jun 5 15:24:08 2015 UTC,"Go and buy yourself a crochet needle. 0.5mm is what i use on my tight bits, and an 0.75mm on my loose parts (roots). Just stick it through the dread, grab some hairs from the other side with it - and pull them into the dread. Do this from all sides and angles. Should sort it right out. I do this regularly to get my stray hairs into the roots, and make it look neat for work, and other official events. I can't stand having messy dreads haha"

Dreadlocks,38l4an,onyxkrawl,3,Thu Jun 4 22:32:28 2015 UTC,"The thing to watch out for is compression. Tight fitting hats aren't highly recommended as they can flatten and restrict movement. As long as it's not super restrictive and preventing movement, you should be fine, though you might want to brace yourself for some slowed development.  I worked with a guy with dreads and he just undid the tightening strap at the back and wore his lid like that. I sort of did the same, though my straight hair ponytail was less intrusive."

Dreadlocks,38ej3z,lostnfoundaround,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:12:39 2015 UTC,"1: Yes; but not because of hair falling out and adding to it. As the individual strands form tighter knots, they go in less and less of a straight line from root to tip. This causes an overall thickening, shortening, and condensing of the dreadlock. The rule of thumb is along the lines of 30% thicker and shorter from start toe ""end.""  2: As above, it will thicken with time. By how much, I can't say, but I had weirdly thick bottom halves which become uniform thickness later. Dreadlocks are easier to make thicker through congoing than trying to thin them, though, so it's worth sticking it out and seeing where things go before getting too carried away with thickness fixing.   3: No. It shouldn't slow it down at all."

Dreadlocks,38b0ps,supfaggot,2,Wed Jun 3 11:39:55 2015 UTC,"You'll often find that even after blunting your tips, a few stray hairs will work their way out and you may need to crochet them back in (if that is how you're planning on blunting them, although I've seen other methods which in my opinion don't work as well). You'll always have a few stray hairs, from the roots right down to the tips of your dreads. The best thing for this is time and patience, as dreads mature and tighten up, you'll get less stray hairs. Nothing wrong with messy dreads or loose hair, all locs are beautiful!"
Dreadlocks,38b0ps,Hybrid-,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:28:51 2015 UTC,I don't think it will make a difference. But having blunted tips will make your hair a lot harder to dry. With paintbrush tips the water can drip out a lot easier. I actually had a few of my dreads blunt themselves somehow. So your will probably do the same eventually.

So I believe have ""inexperienced"" people do you hair would not be terrible. Just make sure to do a lot of research before hand. As far as technique goes, it depends on the length of your hair. If it is under 6-8 inches I would recommend back comb. Otherwise twist and rip would work. Just make sure you do a lot of research. Lazy dreads has great video tutorials on YouTube for either method as well as general knowledge"

I didn't even want to attempt all that combing myself, so my husband did all the work for me. I showed him a couple YouTube videos on how to properly section and backcomb hair and he picked up the technique pretty quickly. I would recommend doing it that way...from what I've heard going to a salon or stylist is expensive. Plus, if you get a friend or family member to do it for you, you get to wear your pajamas and watch Netflix while your scalp is being pulled on for hours (that's what I did, anyways!).  The main thing is to do your research and read up on all the different starting methods and decide which will work best for you. And make sure you're washing your hair with a residue-free dreadlocks shampoo at least a few weeks before you dread your hair.  Good luck! :)"
Dreadlocks,384if7,Keegsonthemtn,2,Mon Jun 1 20:32:37 2015 UTC,Go for the backcomb method! It worked great to start my dreads with about shoulder length hair and in my experience it makes them tighter to start out with and also takes less time to dread all of your hair than the twist and rip method...also I just had someone section all the hair on my head and then I backcombed all of the dreads myself...goodluck!

Dreadlocks,37zpgn,MoeSizzlak,2,Tue Jun 2 23:57:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the motivation man. I'm going through one of those phases where everyday feels like a bad hair day. I thought my hair would take to it better, and the back has (it grows out like a fro), but the top is just ugh. And on top of all that, I had a frohawk to begin with, so the top and middle back is longer than the rest.   I have faith that one day they'll be gorgeous, no doubt, as they're mine. I just have to pull through. I know it'll be worth it. I have always wanted dreads, and for me, it's part of my way of life. I expected it to be hard so there's no way I'm giving up now!"
Dreadlocks,37zpgn,MoeSizzlak,2,Wed Jun 3 01:28:44 2015 UTC,"I know how you feel. Bad hair days are apart of our lives living with the kind of hair we have. I used to have very short hair for almost my whole life because it is so unmanageable. One day, i was like ""thats it! Im just going to let it go!"" And like you said, it was cool to see it go through stages. The little fro stage, the huge fro stage, the sideshow bob stage, and then boom! Natty dread stage!! I didnt do anything, all natural neglected dreads. Some were thin some were as thick as my wrist. I will always remember a quote a sadhu said about his dreads (that were long enough to drag on the ground as he walked) when he was asked about them. He said, ""i do not spend my time thinking about jata (dread)"". It was as simple as that. Live your life. Jata will happen on its own."

Dreadlocks,37wwcj,BigBrandes,5,Sun May 31 02:03:06 2015 UTC,"I had pillar box red for 18 months pre-dreads and every other colour at some point, so having tried nearly everything, the ONLY way to make your hair any colour that is lighter than your base colour (or a colour which needs a lighter base like some deep purples) is bleach/chemicals.   Some products do contain a lightening product, this is still a chemical lift, it is just incorporated in the product. If using these, once the colour is faded you will be left with the lightened base. The only way to not use a chemical lift is to chose a colour darker than your original hair. I have mid brown hair and without lifting i can go chocolate brown or black or one of the dark tonal colours. There is a link in the side bar to dying dreads.   Products wise, I used either bleach plus directions colour pots or affinage hair colour which is a salon product and has a lifting technology which works well. I can't comment on 'normal colour' products as i don't do normal :-P"

Dreadlocks,37u48b,jpbln,6,Sat May 30 12:09:41 2015 UTC,You can't really chose all of the aesthetics. You can generally pick how many dreads you'll have and this changes the thickness but your dreads are gonna look like your dreads because they grew out of your head. Just don't expect to be able to match it that well.
Dreadlocks,37u48b,Snookied,2,Sat May 30 14:09:31 2015 UTC,I see. Can you please tell me what you think about how he did his? I dont know anything about growing dreads
Dreadlocks,37u48b,Snookied,3,Sat May 30 14:21:20 2015 UTC,He did them. There's not much control over your dreads dude. You work with how they grow. That's part of the process.

A large pillow rests behind my neck pushing my head slightly forward. I bring my knees up...feet resting on the bed chair etc with my heels as close to my bottom as possible...I rest my elbows on my knees and get to work.

Dreadlocks,37ozuy,treyonator56,5,Fri May 29 07:04:52 2015 UTC,"Hey there, fellow twist n rip dreadhead!!   I too started off with TnR, but I've left them ever since (no crotchet hook, latch hook, wool rubbing etc)  and they're doing perfectly fine!   I like to think of the TnR as a placement method, to map out where the dreads are and coax them into dreading roughly where you want them to. Of course, no matter what method you use, dreadlocks always take time to fully mature :)   So yeah, just leave them to do their own thing! After every wash (make sure you're using residue free shampoo) seperate your dreadies by pulling them apart. They will sound like they're ripping, but I assure you, it's fine. That's all you'll need to in terms of maintenance.   You're simply pulling apart the hairs you didn't want to dread together in the first place- trust me, I didn't do this for the first few weeks and ended up with a crash helmet of matted hair! Not cool.   Hope I helped you. Have fun with the wonderful journey of dreadlocks :)"
Dreadlocks,37ozuy,dreadmek,3,Fri May 29 10:00:28 2015 UTC,"Th only reason you'd want to brush out and restart is so that you could legitimately call them 100% neglect dreads. My advice - it really doesn't matter how you made them, if you want to stop maintaining and start neglecting them now, you'll end up with some great dreads after some time."
Dreadlocks,37ozuy,RoonilaWazlib,2,Fri May 29 15:44:22 2015 UTC,"If you want to legit call your dreads ""neglect dreads"", you can comb out whatever knots you have and then throw your comb away.  That's pretty much it.   Or can I just start neglect now?   Imagine if I said I had built a canal, but later decided that what I had  built was a river.  After all, water flows like a river.  And I only dug the canal once -- some time in the past.  So it's a river, right?  You'd probably tell me that rivers occur naturally.  And that the moment I picked up a shovel and manufactured something -- that I could never legitimately call it a river.   TnR == canal neglect == river"

Dreadlocks,37n288,clearlyunstable,1 point,Fri May 29 03:27:51 2015 UTC,I can honestly say that I wish I had gone neglect instead of T&R just because it's so easy to fuck up sectioning if you or a novice is working on them. Your hair knows how to dread all by itself and curly hair is especially good at it.
Dreadlocks,37n288,Midgar-Zolom,1 point,Fri May 29 03:43:22 2015 UTC,"I would heartedly advise not neglecting your hair. I started my hair with a six to seven inch  fro very much like yours and choose to go the neglect route. After the neglect I spent the next two years correcting the problems with the ""freeness"" of my hair. I was lucky they were saved  as I come from a family of natural hair stylist...but initially I was being a dick and didn't want them helping me...  Generally I don't try and tell people how to do their locs. dreds are an individual choice and how you do them that much more personal. I only commented because of my issues and the similar texture and curl pattern of our hair. That being said neglect will work and will be the lowest maintenance to start...but easier sometimes is not best..."
Dreadlocks,37n288,blazing_ent,1 point,Fri May 29 07:45:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. What exactly were the problems you had to correct? Do you have any photos of before dreads and during the locking process? I've looked at your dreads now and they look fantastic.
Dreadlocks,37n288,blazing_ent,2,Fri May 29 13:12:12 2015 UTC,Man if only I could remember my MySpace password. Anyway my hair was too thin in some places too thick in other places...and the hair that framed my face could have been best described as free ranging radicals. The small ones broke and the thick ones didn't so my hair was uneven.   If you were my friend and you ask me to do your hair (I can't do locs for money it feels wrong)...I would wash your hair and leave it alone for say a week. A week or so later I would separate (if the hair was sufficiently tangling...if not we would wait a little longer) and twist your hair down (palm rolling)...while moisturizing your scalp. I'd use a light gel to loc and a coconut oil mixture moisturize. We would do that every month to month and a half till your hair loc'ed. After that we'd stop and let that shit go ape with minimal work for maintenance depending on how you want them to look.  Wash...neglect...wash...twist and rip...palm roll down...neglect. Repeat.  That's the method I use to this day. Any moisturizing in between is always good.   The great thing about this method is no matter how crazy your hair goes (I don't mean years of neglect) it can always be brought in and tamed by separation and palm rolling.
Dreadlocks,37n288,blazing_ent,2,Fri May 29 15:07:40 2015 UTC,"Okay thanks a lot for the advice, I will bare that in mind. I'll probably leave it for a couple weeks or so to start off with, and then start doing serious palm rolling (and maybe a bit of twist n rip if needed) to get it in order. Having periods of neglect in between maintenance sounds like a good plan. Is the gel really necessary?"
Dreadlocks,37n288,blazing_ent,1 point,Fri May 29 17:22:26 2015 UTC,Probably not but it's smells hella good...and when ya chattin someone up it never hurts to have ya hair smellin awesome...light gels mostly evaporate away instead of attracting dirt like waxes. If you want to beat the frizziness especially with your grade of hair it might help. Otherwise fuck it...  Edit: don't forget to moisturize...
Dreadlocks,37n288,OJ_Simpsons_Glove,1 point,Fri May 29 19:24:03 2015 UTC,okay cool. thanks again for the tips.
Dreadlocks,37mx14,tiny2015,5,Thu May 28 20:21:49 2015 UTC,I use the hose part of my vacuum cleaner. It actually works pretty well. It just sucks all the dandruff off.
Dreadlocks,37mx14,ellysunshine,2,Fri May 29 21:23:55 2015 UTC,"Try a deep clean. Recipes vary, but it's basically soaking your noggin in a bucket of water, baking soda, tea tree oil, and other good smelling stuff and then rinsing with diluted apple cider vinegar. I had awful dandruff before I did this. Cleared up very nicely."
Dreadlocks,37mx14,visforvito,2,Thu May 28 21:00:33 2015 UTC,"I've heard regular dandruff shampoo can work. It will leave a residue, but don't use it all the time and deep clean it out before too long and that could work."
Dreadlocks,37mx14,Carsandsarcasm,2,Fri May 29 00:43:38 2015 UTC,"When washing I use the Black Castor Oil Shampoo and Tingle Shampoo by Jamaican Mango and Lime, gets rid of all of the dandruff and buildup."
Dreadlocks,37mx14,White__Whale,1 point,Sat May 30 22:54:20 2015 UTC,"I do trader Joe's tea tree tingle shampoo, and I either add tea tree oil to the shampoo or dilute the oil in water and rinse with it before I shampoo. Works really well. Adding it to baking soda/acv rinses works well too"
Dreadlocks,37mx14,traginus,1 point,Thu May 28 21:26:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips :) I have tried various combo's and acv, tea tree oil, knotty boy shampoo, lush bars, rosemary etc..not even a slight improvement :/  I did have dandruff before I had dreads but nothing like this..maybe I am not diluting the stuff I use  enough?"

Dreadlocks,37mkxj,OneLevon,2,Thu May 28 18:57:08 2015 UTC,You lean backwards over the sink/bathtub for the back then twist around and bend forward so the top gets soaked in it as well. I've found that a big tub in a bathtub makes it easiest because you have more room to be messy.
Dreadlocks,37mkxj,gillalover,1 point,Fri May 29 00:40:36 2015 UTC,"Never thought of doing it in the bathtub, thanks!"
Dreadlocks,37mkxj,EmiBoo,2,Fri May 29 17:02:34 2015 UTC,My hair washing tub has this big inflatable pillow part that holds my head to far out of the water for the front parts to stay submerged so I just took a glass measuring cup and scooped water over the front of my head pretty much continuously while I was lying there and it worked just fine. Just be careful not to get it in your eyes as I doubt that would feel good!
Dreadlocks,37mkxj,Child_of_Bhaal,2,Fri May 29 12:35:14 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a good and easy solution, thanks for your input!"
Dreadlocks,37mkxj,Child_of_Bhaal,2,Fri May 29 16:59:39 2015 UTC,"Whatever you do, don't bother with baking soda. That stuff dries up badly and leaves powder on your scalp and dreads. Learn from my mistake :c you may want to add some drops of tee tea tree oil and lavender with that acv. Also be modest on the amount. Acv is hard to rinse out completely."

Dreadlocks,37mk3c,BlackBurton,5,Thu May 28 18:51:06 2015 UTC,"I work in the tech industry.  Software testing. Almost 2 years ago I moved to Texas and cut my long hair to ""look more professional"" in a conservative state.  I have been growing my hair out since I moved and 3 months ago put in dreads.  I work in an office environment for a massive software company.  I wear a bandana to work to keep them looking neat.  I might get a strange look once in a while or the odd comment from a co-worker but I have never been discriminated against for them.    Now, that will not be the experience for every industry/company/job.  There are many jobs where employees are expected to have a ""look"".  There are others where what you do is more important that how you present yourself.  I never meet clients or am a public facing image for my company.  As long as my fashion/lifestyle choices do not effect my work or offend anyone, no one cares.    I think it's important to ask yourself which is important.  There may be a dream job where you will be public facing for an organization. If dreads are not going to fly, you have to weigh your self expression with career ambitions."
Dreadlocks,37mk3c,knappj,4,Thu May 28 19:38:25 2015 UTC,"You simply need to consider that appearance is a factor. I only had straight, long hair in a ponytail when I got this job, but I was told straight up that if I only got the job because I knew they guy. He said he would not have hired me based on my appearance otherwise.  My advice is to get the job first, establish yourself, and then think about dreads. It sucks, but money is kind of important and something like dreadlocks could have a very real impact on your ability to get the job you want or any half reasonable job at all."
Dreadlocks,37mk3c,Carsandsarcasm,2,Fri May 29 00:52:01 2015 UTC,Tons of discussion and great advice in previous posts about this topic: http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreadlocks/search?q=jobs&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all
Dreadlocks,37mk3c,knottysleeves,2,Thu May 28 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"The District Manager hired me at a graphics firm with my dreads. She was an obvious old hippy, though, and when I asked if my hairstyle would be a problem she said, ""no, actually it reminds me of when I had dreadlocks when I was younger.""  More people like that are springing up, so I'd think you have a good chance."
Dreadlocks,37mk3c,Midgar-Zolom,2,Fri May 29 03:45:12 2015 UTC,"I think it will inevitably come down to where you are living/looking for work, the kind of competition you are up against, and the industry you are working in. If you are looking for a job that is all about having certain skills and you can prove that you are the best candidate, a lot of fields won't care about your appearance. Tech related industries tend to be good for this as many of the people around you will be younger and less caught up in the whole suit-wearing professional thing that is now somewhat outdated. Industries in which you are more ""client-facing"" might be harder, especially things where your clients are putting their fate in your hands so to speak: law, medicine, etc. Not so much that the clients/patients will care necessarily but bosses might assume they will to a larger degree.    So with that said I would second the idea that getting a job and then getting dreads might be a safe plan but, again, it depends on the job. If you are expected to look a certain way and then want to spend a year with baby dreads that look messier and such, it might hurt you more than if you installed them now and let them do their messy stage before seeking employment.   Either way, good luck!   Little side story: My husband was somewhat convinced that dreads were the worst thing I could do for my career and then I went into the beer industry and I honestly think they help me a lot. As a bit of an introvert, they help make me more approachable and memorable which, as a promotions person, is pretty key. And they were only about 8 months old when I got the job so they were not the neatest by any means."
Dreadlocks,37mk3c,EmiBoo,2,Fri May 29 12:44:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies! All of you! I think I'm going to actually go through with it and like you said Emiboo starting now and here's why.  1.) I'm an african american male living in California. 2.) I want to go into speech pathology (the field is like 90% women if you don't know) as a long term goal but want to start somewhere in the various fields of Language studies that involves deaf culture since I want to learn three languages before I die; one of them being ASL. So I doubt a deaf person would be judging me!  3.) I'm not even trying to go with the neglect/freeform method, my dad complains when I don't comb my hair already I wouldn't even want to deal with that. I was going to find someone, maybe my aunt, who can twist smallish thick sections in my hair once it's long enough, and try to keep them clean from there.   4.) I want them around shoulder length and no more haha so i don't even want them long.  I'm more extroverted and would need a job more around people and my dad hates the idea of going around with hair not combed so I have to conform somewhere haha"
Dreadlocks,37mk3c,poop-pee-penis-fart,2,Fri May 29 18:11:36 2015 UTC,"sometimes discrimination happens, sometimes it doesn't.   Off the top of my head, I'd say it's 50% line of work (public facing? competitive field?), 30% location (pacific nw vs. bible belt), 20% luck (how does your company or manager feel about it, personally?)  So if you're in the kind of industry where it's not going to be a dealbreaker, you're probably 50/50. If you're in Seattle or Portland, your chances are even better. But you'll never be able to know or control how each person will feel, and that alone might affect you.   It's all about how much risk you're willing to take."

Just keep being patient, they'll get long enough to style eventually! :)"
Dreadlocks,37jqdm,cianwilson,2,Thu May 28 11:10:41 2015 UTC,They can be cornrowed in a bunch of different styles...you can slick the sides back with a little putty or locking gel (not to be done if they are still twists not dreds) and create a faux hawk...they can be parted and pushed forward or back or sideways then held down with a bit of locking gel...  That's just off the top of my head...I'll ask a few stylist friends what they think...
Dreadlocks,37hnrt,Captain_Crunch420,3,Wed May 27 18:32:08 2015 UTC,how long is it when you pull it to straighten it out? at that length it doesn't look long enough but it's frizziness makes its length deceiving.
Dreadlocks,37hnrt,PoshyX,1 point,Wed May 27 18:59:58 2015 UTC,It's about 4 or 5 inches after I shower and blow dry it. But after its fully dry it always de-poofs down
Dreadlocks,37hnrt,PoshyX,2,Wed May 27 19:59:48 2015 UTC,like some guy said already it might not be long enough for TnR or backcombing. i'd suggest towel rubbing like s/he said or just go straight freeform/neglect. with hair like that it should dread relatively quickly if you go all natural.
Dreadlocks,37hnrt,Thatguyfromhouse,2,Thu May 28 03:03:02 2015 UTC,"You can go ahead and try Towel rubbing, But generally, no it's not really long enough for a method like twist and rip or back combing."
Dreadlocks,37hnrt,Thatguyfromhouse,1 point,Wed May 27 19:04:32 2015 UTC,Will the towel rubbing method help it grow faster?
Dreadlocks,37hnrt,knappj,2,Wed May 27 20:10:04 2015 UTC,"Nah. But it will gradually help it dread. As far as i've seen, It's used for shorter hair. I have 8~ inches of hair and I pretty much use the towel rub method and I have a few dreads in the back from like a couple months or so."
Dreadlocks,37hnrt,knappj,2,Wed May 27 20:20:46 2015 UTC,"I started at 6 inches and it felt too short.  It's been 3 months and its slowly getting better, but definitely wait.  If you're patient enough to wait for your hair to grow out more, you'll be patient enough to go through the baby stages of dreads."

Dreadlocks,37gvmu,Lion_Style,1 point,Wed May 27 21:20:58 2015 UTC,I did and it was terribly anticlimactic. I washed about every three or four days too when my scalp would start to get itchy.
Dreadlocks,37gvmu,Lion_Style,2,Thu May 28 02:13:47 2015 UTC,how was it anticlimactic? because the water wasnt disgusting? that would be a good result. if the water is gross afterwords dreads were well past due for a deep clean
Dreadlocks,37gvmu,Lion_Style,1 point,Thu May 28 02:55:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not disappointed that the water wasn't gross, although it would have been fun to see, but it obviously didn't get everything out right? I only took them out a month after I did the deep clean."
Dreadlocks,37gvmu,Lion_Style,1 point,Thu May 28 16:35:04 2015 UTC,how long did you let them soak? i let mine soak for at least 30 min and i clean mine regularly. i cant see the soak getting rid of buildup if only done for a short period of time or like even dumped over you head. the should be soaking in the mixture with constant swirling and squeezing your dreads to get all that residue out
Dreadlocks,37gvmu,EmiBoo,1 point,Fri May 29 03:14:03 2015 UTC,"I let them soak for at least thirty minutes. Well I would stick my whole head in a bowl and agitate my hair for about a minute then squeeze it out. Then repeat. The mixture I used was baking soda, lemon and tea tree oil. Then I did an avc rinse in the shower."

Dreadlocks,37gvmu,Silverslade1,2,Fri May 29 23:50:50 2015 UTC,"Most daily shampoos will leave some small amount of residue - I use Neutrogena and rinse like crazy and it's not too bad, deep cleans are disappointingly ungross. That said you probably don't want to overdo the ACV, that's probably what you are feeling afterwards as it conditions the hair a bit and isn't really required too often. I'd switch to the most residue free shampoo you can find and then use the baking soda/acv soak every few months and see if that does better for you. Good luck with your new set!"

Dreadlocks,37atit,m0ng0o53,3,Tue May 26 06:46:46 2015 UTC,Have those bands been there the whole time?
Dreadlocks,37atit,Silverslade1,4,Tue May 26 07:15:40 2015 UTC,^ this!  Because if they have been then the hair has no way to move around and properly knot up. You should remove the rubber bands asap.
Dreadlocks,37atit,thirtytwoflavors,1 point,Tue May 26 11:16:54 2015 UTC,I put them on about 2 or 3 days after backcombing. I'm taking them out here shortly. I wanted to make sure everything stayed together at the roots initially to prevent stray hairs going into other dreads.
Dreadlocks,37atit,bex_2601,2,Tue May 26 16:34:34 2015 UTC,"The bands do look quite tight.  I didn't use them initially but do occasionally use bands (3 times/dreads in 14 months) when i have a stray that just won't get with the program, but VERY loosely, like one or two wraps, you still want the hair to move of it's own accord, the band just keeps it vaguely in a group and they're silicon and so don't need to be tight as they will hold themselves in place.  I have found that a lot of damage is done by people trying to remove the bands. I'd suggest breaking them and freeing them by uncoiling them in place rather than trying to twist them off. I use a stitch ripper from my sewing box to cut the band."

Dreadlocks,37ac7w,Silverslade1,9,Tue May 26 03:49:08 2015 UTC,It sounds like a neat idea but will likely be highly dependent on the number of dreadheads in your area and their average income. I find dreadlock services tend to be way more expensive than your average hair salon (understandable I suppose if there is more physical labour involved but still frustrating at points) so I would say the biggest challenge would likely be finding a price point that attracts customers while paying you a reasonable amount.   I think it would be a lovely treat to go to a salon every six months or something and get a scalp massage and deep clean from someone who really knew dreads tho and I wish you all the best!
Dreadlocks,37ac7w,EmiBoo,5,Tue May 26 12:40:55 2015 UTC,"I think that's a great idea. One thing I always missed when having dreads was getting scalp massages!  Deep-clean soaks can be hard for some people to do at home because they're using a bucket or whatever, so a quality salon chair would be a good investment for you. Clients are going to spend hours in that chair, they'll want a comfy one. ;-)  Also make sure to check your local & state regulations regarding home businesses, and hair salons in particular. Some states require a special license for anyone working with hair, even ""braiders"" or dread stylists."
Dreadlocks,37ac7w,knottysleeves,1 point,Tue May 26 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"Good looking out knottysleeves, in my state you have to at least have a braiding license I believe to do dreadlocks and charge people. They consider dreadlocks braids."
Dreadlocks,37ac7w,Kris_Lion,3,Tue May 26 17:38:44 2015 UTC,I would definitely do it... But I guess not if it's super expensive. Good idea!! Agree with the other person though; depends on how many dread heads are in your community as well.
Dreadlocks,37ac7w,baileyanais,3,Tue May 26 13:24:08 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest with you. Never in a million years would I pay money for someone else to mess with my dreads in this fashion. But I never do much maintenence anyway, so I'm probably not your customer base"
Dreadlocks,37ac7w,YetiMarauder,2,Tue May 26 19:17:12 2015 UTC,I'd definitely go however the price is a massive factor for me. I love ordinary massages for my body but they're pretty expensive like 60 bucks an hr. So I never get any. The same would go for dread treatment. However I probably should treat my hair once in a while.
Dreadlocks,37ac7w,stolesomechopsticks,2,Tue May 26 14:17:03 2015 UTC,"if it wasn't crazy expensive, i would definitely pay to have my roots crocheted. and omg a deep rinse and scalp massage too? yes please"
Dreadlocks,37ac7w,blackbeltnerd,2,Wed May 27 02:00:11 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, its a very niche area of business, but offering those services among other 'normal hair' services would definitely not hurt.

Deep cleans aren't always comfortable to do, and lots of people are too scared to even touch my hair never mind massage my scalp (due to myths and misconceptions of hygiene)"
Dreadlocks,37ac7w,WelshElf,1 point,Wed May 27 15:56:28 2015 UTC,"If you offered it as some kind of regular maintenance deal, I would go for it.  Maybe build it into a full package where they could do something like purchase a years' worth of deep rinse/massage/scalp treatment/crochet maintenance for cheaper than the cost of individual sessions and set them up on a schedule, that sort of thing?  If there's not a lot of people with dreadlocks in your community, I imagine most of your income will come from regular clients, so you'll want to make them as reliable and regular as possible.  Dreadlocks removal is another thing you might want to consider offering. If you make sleeves, beads, headbands, wraps, etc, I would definitely offer those for sale as well."
Dreadlocks,37ac7w,hermanbigot,1 point,Tue May 26 14:40:19 2015 UTC,"I would pay to have my dreads washed and dried properly on a regular basis. Mine are about to my knees, it takes sooooooo long dry them."
Dreadlocks,37ac7w,CSPOONYG,1 point,Tue May 26 19:01:53 2015 UTC,"As money is such a factor, you really want to make it worth the while. Offering services like you coming to them, operating over a very wide area, and offering extra luxuries during the treatment would be suggestions. You have to make me, the customer, want you over calling my mate to do it for a carton. I'm unlikely to shell out hundreds to go to a simple salon and sit in a chair for hours, I'm going to want it to be special, fun, and worth my money.   A huge hurdle I see with this is getting the name out there too. This is a tiny market to begin with, you somehow need to reach all these people, and that will be tricky.  I really think this idea would be better done as a side project that you run at a very small profit. Most of your business is likely to come on weekends and afternoons anyway, plus you could keep prices down and not have to rely on needing new customers every day. Even regular hairdressers don't have constant customers and can struggle for business. I simply don't see this as something you stand to run sustainably and profitably."

Dreadlocks,37d4qd,unidentifies,6,Tue May 26 19:26:04 2015 UTC,I've never soaked my hair in it. I make it in a spray bottle with peppermint essential oil (cause I love minty dreads) and just spray it in the morning.
Dreadlocks,37d4qd,traginus,1 point,Tue May 26 21:49:03 2015 UTC,I also used a spray bottle and it worked very well! I mix with rosemary oil. Do not overdo the spraying! I left sea-salt in my hair for a couple of days at a time and it made my dreads way to dry. Ended up with dreads that felt crispy to the touch.
Dreadlocks,37d4qd,Ruggestein,2,Tue May 26 22:40:36 2015 UTC,"It depends.  If you tend to have a dry, irritable scalp then do it 2-3 hours before before washing.  But, if you can put salt in your hair without irritating your scalp too much put it in anytime. I would just recommend not right before bed and apply it when your hair is dry. That is what I do since I live near an ocean so my scalp is used to long periods of being dry and salty"

Dreadlocks,377n4h,alieecattt,2,Mon May 25 15:28:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of ""lock pepper"" and similar products.  If the powder washes out, the ""helping loose hairs and tightening"" effect is only going to last until your next wash.  If the powder doesn't wash out, it's going to stay inside your locks and create a gross sticky mess.  Sewing is a much easier, gentler and product-free way to deal with loose hair. Or you could wait until you have enough loose hair to start a new baby dread or two."
Dreadlocks,377n4h,knottysleeves,3,Mon May 25 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"""Lock peppa"" ingredients  Similar products use similar ingredients, like zinc oxide and rosin. Rosin is pine sap, it's sticky and tacky. It's still a powder, but basically it just sticks your hairs together. If it washes out that's fine, but I suspect it doesn't fully."

Essentially the idea is that the powder adds texture to your hair so it helps the knots hold and mat faster. It's not the intended purpose of the powder, obviously, but a friend of mine who owns a beauty supply shop turned me on to the stuff and it's the best!"

Not sure if it's the right way to be doing it, but because I mix it with glycerin products (essences and essential oils) it seems to counteract the humectant properties of the essences, so it works for me."
Dreadlocks,3749yh,Silverslade1,1 point,Mon May 25 01:59:53 2015 UTC,Thanks! Could I use the jojoba oil?
Dreadlocks,3749yh,Silverslade1,2,Mon May 25 03:09:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not as familiar with Jojoba as I'd like to be, can't say I've used it myself yet. If in doubt, use a small amount and monitor the differences. Maybe make up two seperate batches of spray, one with and one without, and compare them one day after the other.  Most of my knowledge has come from trial and error so far, and as long as you're only using small amounts, any damage you could do should be minimal, if any."
Dreadlocks,3749yh,cassiopeia1280,1 point,Mon May 25 04:14:14 2015 UTC,"I put probably 3 tablespoons of salt in 16 ounces of water (not 100% sure, I've never measured). Then just some essential oils to make it smell good. I haven't tried jojoba oil, but I know it's kinda pricey. Maybe try almond oil for something a bit cheaper. You should be ok mixing the two, as long as you keep the oil on your scalp and the salt spray on your dreads (as much as possible anyway)."
Dreadlocks,371ki5,Carsandsarcasm,4,Sun May 24 00:27:20 2015 UTC,Nah man I love the way they've shrunk and thickened up! The thicked dreads definitely suit your face really well. It was cool to see side by side pictures of all those crazy loops and bumps

Dreadlocks,371ki5,axleranda,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:53:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I took scissors to all the scrappy ends at week 47. I rinse in the shower by essentially palm rolling, and the downwards force pulled out some of the looser ends which created a look I thought was quite messy. Every dread had this weird extra tail coming off it. The plan was always to let them figure themselves out, but it didn't look like happening, so I intervened. Much neater afterwards, but some illusion of length was lost.   I do plan on combing the tips out once I have the length to pull the tips in front of my eyes, as I like loose ends, but that's a future project."
Dreadlocks,371ki5,psychedelicjournal,2,Thu Jun 4 11:04:00 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of loose hair in my ends (3-4 inches) and it just looked so raggedy, so I know what you mean! I hope you'll keep posting updates :)"

Dreadlocks,36y0bj,Tkee16,5,Sat May 23 01:39:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of root flipping / interlocking. There are better & less damaging ways to maintain your roots.  Keep in mind that weakness in a lock isn't always apparent right away. The flipped areas are now permanently & tightly woven, and because they can't move, they'll never be able to tangle & knot the way hairs normally do. And once that interlocked area grows out, it might not be as strong as the rest of the lock, especially once your dreads get longer & heavier and that spot has to support more weight.  Just my two cents."
Dreadlocks,36y0bj,knottysleeves,3,Sat May 23 01:59:02 2015 UTC,"Thats actually a pretty popular form of maintenance. root flipping in itself is only a bad thing if you do it too much, since it puts a lot of tension on your scalp. but if you have thinner dreads then interlocking can keep flyaway hairs under control pretty well."
Dreadlocks,36y0bj,browndog12,1 point,Sat May 23 01:46:15 2015 UTC,So if I have new dreads with more than 50% of the clumps of hair loose would flipping them down to a more desired length be destructive at all?
Dreadlocks,36y0bj,browndog12,1 point,Sat May 23 01:48:34 2015 UTC,"i'd recommend waiting until they locked themselves down closer to your scalp before interlocking, if you do it. you might end up with long braid-ey looking pieces of dread that might not really ever knot up.  i interlocked one of my dreads to try to tighten it up but if you look closely you can definitely tell where it was flipped, and it looks a little wacky imo."
Dreadlocks,36y0bj,appelmak,1 point,Sat May 23 02:51:21 2015 UTC,"It also gives your dreads a bit of a knotted texture, which could be cool if that's what you're going for.  From what I can tell you just don't want to do it too tight.   Mine have been interlocked and I like the way 90% of my dreads turned out, but I won't do it again.

Dreadlocks,36vo5a,supfaggot,3,Fri May 22 22:50:30 2015 UTC,Not nearly long enough.
Dreadlocks,36uaxz,IneffibleGiraffe,1 point,Fri May 22 04:27:14 2015 UTC,And the obligatory dropping of the driver over the edge... at least I looked good doing it.
Dreadlocks,36u4hr,SteampunkPinion,3,Fri May 22 03:24:53 2015 UTC,"IMO, they look totally normal for new dreads -- and in fact, your sections are very defined and it looks like you did a decent job with the twist & rip, so well done!  Baby dreads are always going to be skinny... it takes months before they start to lock up and gain thickness.  The point of twist & rip (or any other starter method) is to create some initial tangles. You did that just fine. They are going to loosen and shift around over the next several weeks and months, so don't worry about how they look today.  Let go of the worry (I know, much easier said than done). Have faith in the process -- your hair knows what to do, you just need to give it time & space to get there. You're off to a fine start and that's all you need."
Dreadlocks,36u4hr,knottysleeves,1 point,Fri May 22 06:38:03 2015 UTC,I did twist and rip and my hair is kinda thin... I'm pretty sure that I twisted too much and ripped to little cuz they are SO SKINNY. They also havent really released much except at the roots. I know I'm supposed to be patient but if they look wrong I feel like now would be the best time to find out cuz it'd be easier to redo them. >_<
Dreadlocks,36u4hr,Critterpillar,1 point,Fri May 22 03:27:35 2015 UTC,"Im sure they will be fine. Dreads thicken up over time. Mine also started out uber thin and they got thicker and thicker.   For me anyways, waiting got easier and easier as time went on. At first I was palm rolling like a mofo all the time and couldn't wait for them to hurry up and mature. Then I realized, time will go on no matter what so ill just let em do their thing. Yes its hard to be patient but its kinda easier to be patient with dreads cuz you don't have to do anything =P"

Dreadlocks,36pcwd,GhostyNams,1 point,Thu May 21 11:37:02 2015 UTC,Yes. They are naturally blunted.   They all begin as little hair balls at the tips -- and they gradually build toward the scalp.
Dreadlocks,36pcwd,blazing_ent,2,Thu May 21 13:38:58 2015 UTC,Woah didn't even recognize that this was you on the first glance. They're looking great! So much longer too!
Dreadlocks,36siyi,Lawley3,3,Thu May 21 19:44:24 2015 UTC,Do a good job on your sections (try for perfect squares). Try not to leave any hair between the sections. Don't use wax and don't ever use regular shampoo again.
Dreadlocks,36siyi,Critterpillar,0,Thu May 21 20:44:55 2015 UTC,what shampoo should I use from now on?
Dreadlocks,36siyi,knottysleeves,6,Thu May 21 21:11:36 2015 UTC,My advice would be that if you didn't know the answer to this question you should really do more research on what your about to do to your hair. Do NOT just jump into it.
Dreadlocks,36siyi,Sunshine492,1 point,Thu May 21 22:23:49 2015 UTC,"This.  Baby dreads can easily be combed out if you make a ""mistake"" but starting locks is very time-consuming. Better to spend a couple hours doing research before starting, it will save much time & aggravation later."
Dreadlocks,36siyi,Tkee16,2,Fri May 22 06:42:35 2015 UTC,"I dissolve 1/2 cup baking soda in a cup of water, wash, then rinse with 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar in a cup of water. Soap residue is a major problem for some people and it's dependent on the water quality of the area you live in. Even if you stand in the shower for 40 minutes, you won't completely rinse out any kind of soap (even the kind that says ""no residue"" right on the bottle) if you live in an area with hard water. This will make a nasty gray build-up on the outside of your dreads, can even lead to rot and mold.  Different people will say different things, that's just my experience."
Dreadlocks,36siyi,browndog12,1 point,Fri May 22 01:00:17 2015 UTC,Anything completely residue free.
Dreadlocks,36siyi,Midgar-Zolom,0,Thu May 21 21:33:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for your advice :)
Dreadlocks,36siyi,Carsandsarcasm,2,Thu May 21 21:43:38 2015 UTC,I did the exact same thing that you are doing. I did not section my hair but I had practice a ton of small dreads before I really hopped in. I have some loose hairs but not a ton. I like how mine turned out and they are only getting better. I also did a lot of research and I recommend you do the same. Definitely put pictures up for your results when you're done
Dreadlocks,36siyi,MwamWWilson,2,Thu May 21 23:08:40 2015 UTC,twist less than you think you need between the rips. if you twist a lot they end up looking like tight braids for the first few months.

Dreadlocks,36oba7,knottysleeves,2,Thu May 21 10:30:50 2015 UTC,Salt is very drying (which is why it helps hair tangle & knot). You might be overdoing it with the saltwater.
Dreadlocks,36oba7,Carsandsarcasm,2,Wed May 20 23:29:58 2015 UTC,"You want to take it easy with the salt. It will help with the knots, but it can cause real issues drying out the scalp. It can make for brittle hair too, which can lead to dreads falling out way down the line."

That particular dread could actually end up really thick and dense.  When you use a starter method (backcombing, twist & rip, crochet etc) there is always going to be a ""tail"" left over, otherwise you wouldn't have anything to hold onto while creating the initial tangles. Check out some timelines of other people's locks -- the tails usually get sucked in and disappear in time. There's nothing to ""fix""."

Those are density scanners. Their use is to detect non-metals that could be potentially harmful based on their density. If your dreads are mature enough, they can set off the detector as well.  I've flown about 30 flights in the last year, and my dreads set them off every. single. time. Sometimes they ask me to spread my dreads, sometimes they just brush them aside and pat me down underneath where the dreads were sitting.  Now, I just make sure the dreads are all behind me (as opposed to some behind, some up front over the shoulders) to save time, as they'll only have to pat down my back and not two more spots on my chest."

And worse, sometimes judgment comes from within our own community, in the form of ""my method is better than your method"" elitism.  So when someone titles a post ""How NOT to do dreadlocks?"" on a picture of ""unconventional"" looking locks, it sounds to many of us like the usual mockery & judgment -- even though that wasn't your intention at all."

Dreadlocks are beautiful, and I know for a fact that there is nothing unclean, sloppy, or unprofessional about them. One method is also not better than another, and I'll be the first to say that. I questioned it, because I've seen what the different methods look like, and his don't look like any of those methods.

I am for letting it be but lots of people don't like it and I am not sure I do myself   One of the lessons dreadlocks have for us is that we shouldn't allow the world to drag us around by the nose.  If you make the difficult decision to wait it out -- damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead -- you'll become desensitized to externally generated negativity.    And one day all of the comments people make magically shift to compliments.  Which feels amazing after spending years just letting all the negative comments roll off your back.  Vindication.  So if you can muster the courage to wait it out, you'll gain an inner strength and unshakable sense of self.  I'm not gonna lie -- it is very emotionally difficult.  But when it's all over and you have burned off all of your ability to stress over what other people think of you -- you'll be glad you endured through the tough times.  Right now your mental focus is usually turned inward.  That's the reality of life for most people.  Everybody is constantly monitoring what they think other people think of them.  But when you turn your focus outward you begin to truly experience the world.  And the world is finally able to experience the real you.  TL;DR - stick it out.  You'll become a better person.  A happier person.  A more authentic person. Though it does hurt a bit in the meantime."

That's a fine reason to do something. :) I wore a bead for a while to train one to grow in another direction because it was hurtin my head when I wore my bike helmet.  Or do you not like that other people don't like it as much as you thought they would? That could also a valid reason to change it, like if their opinion is important to you personally. My family asked me for years about when I was going to be cutting my hair, and some still do, but I just kinda stopped responding to it, and they mostly eventually laid off. If it's a problem because of work, maybe wear a bandanna or something so they don't have to see it?   Are they gonna get better    I'm not sure what you mean by this, but they're prolly always going to be somewhat messy unless you work at doing something to change that, if that's whatcha want. 8 months is a super short amount of time, dread.

A quick crochet session on the scalp (about 10 minutes) and i'm all presentable to go to work! (I work in a high-end hotel - where appearence is important. As long as my dreads are neat, they don't mind. I assume most employers will feel the same way).  I would advise to not try to pull them into the length of the dread, but rather as close to the scalp as possible, where the hair is still dreading. Gives the roots more hair for the locking process, and you don't weaken the lengths - leaving them to tighten up in peace."

And there was nothing I could do about it so I started just letting them swing free.  But it was emotionally difficult.    For kinda a long while.  Because at first it was maybe 25% dreads, 10% tangles, and the rest loose curls.  Just enough to look perpetually homeless.  It is, I guess, a legit trial on the road to wherever it is we're going.  When you're on the other side of it you'll be able to look back on this period as having been unpleasant but necessary.  I guess.  So why not just wheel to the storm and fly?  Let the unpleasantness pass, as everything always does.  And see how you feel then."
Dreadlocks,3665ub,MwamWWilson,1 point,Sat May 16 20:41:54 2015 UTC,combing out wont help that. i see three options here. wait for length. comb out and wait for length. and extensions till theyre long enough.
Dreadlocks,3665ub,MwamWWilson,2,Sat May 16 20:29:53 2015 UTC,extensions are out of the question. might as well just wait it out
Dreadlocks,3665ub,traginus,1 point,Sat May 16 20:32:28 2015 UTC,just options you mentioned length would help.
Dreadlocks,3665ub,MwamWWilson,3,Sat May 16 20:33:15 2015 UTC,Spend some time looking at timelines! Fixes my funk every time. Genysms is right. I get depressed a LOT and little changes in my appearance help me feel better. Maybe go out and get a few new clothes. Or get new beads or do a few wraps in your dreads. It's displaced feelings. Brushing them out and starting the baby dread phase again isn't going to help you. Remember to embrace what you got! :)

Dreadlocks,363y0h,ablino_rhino,3,Fri May 15 22:26:30 2015 UTC,"I occasionally wear a wig. It can be very difficult. What I do is put a wig cap on and tuck all my dreads in as evenly as possible then I throw on a tight hair cap, (I can't really remember what it's actually called) to help compress them a bit. It's like a durag but more of a beanie type style and pretty tight, if that makes sense. You can find them in the same section of a beauty supply store as the lace wig caps. Once all this is together, throw your wig on and spend some time adjusting it until it looks right. I had a tough time with that at first. As a side note, I do not recommend wearing a wig often, having dreadlocks compressed like that is not good for them at all, I usually just use mine for weddings and other occasions where I've been requested to ""not wear my hair in dreads"". I swear, some people think that this is something I do to my hair every day and take out every night."

It also doesn't hurt to get a wig that would still look good with lots of extra added volume. I had one wig, it was curly and thick as is but when I wore it with dreads it was huge (think poison style 80s hair) even though it looked nice back when I had brushed hair that actually laid well beneath a wig."

Dreadlocks,36583k,icemanakadiablo,5,Sat May 16 06:50:06 2015 UTC,"You likely won't need to condition your dreads until they are quite mature, if even then. Some people do end up with quite dry hair after awhile of BS/ACV rinses but typically conditioning dreads involves some kind of oil (coconut is a common one) used on dry hair. This prevents any worries about mold while helping the hair stay healthy and not break easily."
Dreadlocks,36583k,EmiBoo,1 point,Sat May 16 14:01:25 2015 UTC,"You don't need any ""conditioner"" for dreads. Not even water. After they are initially formed, I'd suggest a light wash with baking soda and water once or twice a month.   Mold can form in dreadlocks when the locks are more mature. Water can get trapped on the inside of the dreads, be make sure to dry them fully. Some people's hair dreads much tighter. Also, if you leave the tips of your dreads intact, the water will have an easier time dripping off. Don't blunt your tips."

Is there any way you could perhaps incorporate the hairball back into the dread? It's just, the constant little pulling out may amount to quite a bit of hair loss in the end. Just a suggestion."
Dreadlocks,362ik2,detroitvinyl,1 point,Fri May 15 20:16:11 2015 UTC,"That happened with one of my dreads. I gave it about a month to see if it would shrink up into the dread, but that didn't happen.

Do the deep clean and then just maintain normal, dry hair.  Plumbers work in this crap (pun maybe intended) all the time and they have no issues with moldy hair because they wash.

If the teeth on the comb are too long they will bend easier, so 2cm sounds perfect.

Lock maintenance shouldn't cause THAT much pain, even with a sensitive scalp.  How aggressively are they crocheting? How close to the scalp? Do they have an assistant (or you) hold the lock at the base while they work down the length, to minimize pulling on the roots?  Alternatives: * Go for maintenance less often * Take your painkiller of choice 30 minutes before your session * Find someone whose technique is gentler * Learn how to do sewing maintenance, it's a LOT gentler than crocheting"

It actually looks very nice, almost looks similar to a french braid. My dreads are pretty short (barely touch my shoulders) so this is a good option for me.

Dreadlocks,35nrbu,knottysleeves,3,Tue May 12 00:50:53 2015 UTC,"My only advice would be to skip the wax if you got it. It does literally nothing to help your dreads actually mature. Hair needs to move freely to knot and lock up, wax glues hairs in place preventing movement. Also, it's water resistant, meaning it will make your dreads retain water when you wash, setting up a perfect situation for mold to grow. Mold in dreads can eventually lead to dread rot. I dot think I've ever seen waxed dreads without mold=\ oh, and mold gives them that distinct wet dog/dirt smell. Just like if you leave wet clothes in the washer overnight. Itll attract dirt and other debris because of how sticky it is. It's also pretty much impossible to get out once it's there."
Dreadlocks,35nrbu,Sunshine492,1 point,Tue May 12 16:31:24 2015 UTC,"Everyone hates on wax, I'll start out by saying it's not my favorite. But I've seen plenty of dreads that use wax that turned out great....and some not so great. If you do use it. Use like 5× less than what you'd think you'd need. You don't need need a lot at all. It's not going to ruin your dreads if you use it, but I would skip it."

Dreadlocks,35mocy,SidSuicide,3,Mon May 11 20:11:13 2015 UTC,Same here.  I pretty much always have mine up and I sleep with them in a loose bun.  Mine are perfectly fine and locked.
Dreadlocks,35mocy,Carsandsarcasm,6,Tue May 12 01:17:59 2015 UTC,"Don't worry too much about it. The movement during sleeping and washing are the most important parts, in my opinion. It might take a bit longer, but sometimes the dreads have to meet you halfway."
Dreadlocks,35mocy,thegreenwookie,5,Tue May 12 01:31:48 2015 UTC,"Should be fine with ponytails and buns. Just don't sleep with them tied up, you'll have a bumpin' headache when you wake up  I liked wrapping mine in a wet T-shirt during really hot days"
Dreadlocks,35mocy,EmiBoo,5,Mon May 11 23:50:28 2015 UTC,"Definitely warmer than without dreads but you learn to cope. Ponytails are certainly the way to go but I wouldn't leave it up all day, everyday - give them some time to move around and knot up. Also, if you get really warm and your scalp gets all sweaty, make sure they can breathe properly to dry."

I've had dyed blue hair for the last 3 years , this is most natural toned down I've rocked for awhile.   I love the art of making dreads and all the different mediums it's possible to make them with. I make human hair dreads, synthetic dreads, clips in , crochet in extenders etc etc, wool dreads are my favourite tho! It's naturally antibacterial and light , different kinds of wool create different textures etc...Every artist makes different sets and has different styles and colours I just love it lol"

Patience, patience, patience. Just be sure to separate often. When my hair was like that I was sepatating at least twice a day. Also, Palm rolling won't do much of anything besides damage your roots, anything ""helpful"" it appears to do will only last a couple hours anyways. It's absolutely unnecessary. If they get flat, that's normal too, they'll round themselves out with a bit of time, palm rolling won't magically fix flatties."
Dreadlocks,35h9yu,Sunshine492,6,Sun May 10 13:19:47 2015 UTC,"There is no empiricism is the dread world and everything is anecdotal, but as a second opinion I like to palm roll after showering.

Dreadlocks,35h9yu,wfrench8810,3,Sun May 10 11:53:35 2015 UTC,Make sure you pull them apart after you wash them. I didn't for a couple months when they were new because it hurt to do it and they turned into a web at the roots.. It hurt more to pull them apart from the web then if I had just kept up on it in the beginning.
Dreadlocks,35h9yu,mrs2208,3,Sun May 10 14:44:55 2015 UTC,A lot of frizz is normal at the beginning and just after you wash them. Be careful though because they can cause your hair to matt up at your scalp like a hat. This caused the back of my head to turn into one big deadlock and I had to brush them all out.
Dreadlocks,35h9yu,Smallteeth,2,Sun May 10 10:40:23 2015 UTC,"They're young, I would consider keeping the rubber bands for maybe another month. But I think you shouldn't worry about frizz, hair untangles and dreads itself naturally.   if you think it's too much frizz for you can always use a crochet hook to pull them in, but don't overdo it or you'll damage your roots"
Dreadlocks,35h9yu,Smallteeth,3,Sun May 10 10:40:48 2015 UTC,"But i honestly think they look fine,  keep' em clean and let them hang loose.  And don't forget to palmroll daily!"
Dreadlocks,35h9yu,Sunshine492,5,Sun May 10 10:42:03 2015 UTC,"Rubber bands shouldn't be kept on AT ALL except for sectioing and backcombing, as soon as THATS done they should be taken out. This is because they can easily fuse into the dread, they'll leave a rubbery residue that's worse than wax, and won't actually do anything for the dreading process as they keep hairs in one place. I've seen lots of jacked up roots and tips from keeping rubber bands in for too long. Keep your bands out OP!"

Dreadlocks,35blac,TSIashleigh,3,Fri May 8 19:34:20 2015 UTC,NO RUBBER BANDS in dreddies people never ever ever ever...they rip hair...use a thin nylon cord the color of your hair with a good knot...wool yarn is great also...  Don't knot you hair either...
Dreadlocks,35b198,B_Loner,3,Fri May 8 16:39:20 2015 UTC,"i personally disagree with the use of dreadheadhq products. they have a lotttt of stuff in em. i swear by dr. bronner's soap, diluted about half n half with water. it's going to be hard to avoid the itchy scalp feeling in the beginning - don't overwash your hair! it will actually make the itchiness worse. i don't recommend washing them more than once a week in the beginning. coconut oil works great for an itchy scalp too.  also, btw, this advice is coming from a white girl with dreadlocks. i'm mentioning that just because i have no idea how different it may be to care for dreadlocks if you don't have ""white people"" hair. :P"

Dreadlocks,35920f,blazing_ent,2,Fri May 8 21:42:52 2015 UTC,"Too lazy to illustrate, too little time to explain properly. But youtube ""barrel twist loctician"" and you should see it being done.   Basically, you grab two frontmost locs in adjacent rows, and twist them together. Then pull that backwards along the two rows, and twist each loc of the two rows around the initial twist, and twisting the twist itself slightly with each loc added. Finish off with a rubber band and you're golden.   Good luck!"

Dreadlocks,356tql,gensyms,1 point,Thu May 7 17:57:19 2015 UTC,"When my dreads were young, I got freaked out by the loops too. But don't worry about them, they are completely normal. If you did what I did a d try to ""fix it"" you may end up with a weak spot in the dread.  One way of flattening (for lack of a better term) the loop is to use a spring that is a snug fit and just leave it over the loop. The spring will force the hair to tighten faster and you won't damage your dread.  I hope this helps :)"

Dreadlocks,3559va,PROfessorShred,4,Thu May 7 05:40:18 2015 UTC,About a weeks worth of rubbing with a towel or hand for maybe an hour a day then neglect with a few touch ups of backcombing and twist and rip around my sideburns since my hair is curly there and  wasn't locking up like the rest of my hair.

Dreadlocks,353h07,Lucy_liz,3,Wed May 6 20:06:10 2015 UTC,"According to this, vinegar will dissolve the nits."
Dreadlocks,353h07,gensyms,3,Wed May 6 20:42:13 2015 UTC,"I did this after a bout with lice.  I put the vinegar on my head, wrapped a plastic bag on my head then a towel over that and left it on for an hour.  I did a deep clean with baking soda and acv once a week for a month.  It did the trick.  I do need to add that I became severely paranoid about nits and every white spec made me insane.  At one point a note was sent home from my son's class saying there was an outbreak in his class and I was convinced I had it again.  Turns out that the white specs that I was obsessing over were the hair follicles that naturally shed from your scalp that my dreads were sucking up but were noticeable because of my dark hair."
Dreadlocks,353h07,thirtytwoflavors,3,Thu May 7 00:18:26 2015 UTC,Awesome! ive been looking all over and some say you'll never get rid of the nits or that you have to comb them out and we all know that wont work haha. But yea same everytime I see specs in my hair or if i even itch my head I get nervous. Recently a bunch of people have had to watch out for lice and i'm getting worried all over again :( they just make me feel so gross its not that i'm unclean its just you've got bugs...in your hair :(( but thank you! ill use this trick tonight :)
Dreadlocks,353h07,thirtytwoflavors,4,Thu May 7 15:41:40 2015 UTC,"Also tea tree oil is a natural repellent and lice like clean hair better than dirty hair.  My kids heads get washed once or twice a week, only more often if it's looking real grungy. (they don't have dreads)  And when there is an outbreak I am sure to wear my hair up in scarves or bandannas to reduce my chance of getting it.  Good luck!"
Dreadlocks,353h07,gensyms,4,Fri May 8 14:32:10 2015 UTC,Awesome ive got that! haha do you mix it with water and spray it on your hair? Yea when I first got lice (before i had my full head dreaded) I washed my hair EVERY day but later found out unclean hair is something those little buggers don't really like. But that's a good idea! thanks for the tips :)
Dreadlocks,353h07,Dysp-_-,3,Fri May 8 15:23:00 2015 UTC,"Hmm do you think if I massage my roots a bit after doing  this because the eggs are ""un-glued"" they might fall off?because I know using a comb to do it wouldnt work haha or maybe if I blow dried my hair they might come out/off?"
Dreadlocks,353h07,oakXXIII,2,Wed May 6 20:50:04 2015 UTC,"I am of course, just guessing -- but probably using straight vinegar and letting it sit while massaging may just melt 'em.  And maybe forcing water through your dreads may do the rest.  I hope so."

I literally took sea salt, put like a tablespoon in a small sprayer bottle, filled the rest with water, spray over head. while hair still wet take a towel and start rubbing circles on your head, you should feel some friction, i didnt do it a particular direction, i would mix it up every now and then. you dont need to rub super hard. i rubbed my whole head probably 10-15 minutes at a time 3 times a day, and was spraying my head down constantly, which wasnt the best idea as it was drying out my hair fairly quickly. i dont know often to properly use salt spray, i would say no more than twice a day, you just dont want buildup of salt on your scalp or you locs getting too dry."

I did do them myself, because there are my first two on the other side that I think ended up too big and adds a lot of empty space and I got them done professionally. I think you should just stress being super careful sectioning and make sure your dreads are layed out exactly how you want them...I'm having this problem now because I just kinda dreaded my hair in the dark late one night lol There are some bigger dreads on top that I feel like should be underneath the smaller ones. Just looks better in my opinion. But yeah, I also break out the crochet hook pretty often but not so much anymore that they're getting older. Also, if you go to professional make sure they know if you want the ends blunted or not, cuz that's what that lady ended up doing and I didn't even know"

Dreadlocks,34z6cm,unBottledFairy,4,Tue May 5 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"One aspect of neglect that you may not have considered is that it takes a very very long time.  Put another way, the changes are very gradual.  So unlike the other methods where you have a crazy head of hair right away -- with neglect, nobody notices anything until you already have semi-mature dreads hanging with your normal hair.  I mean, I got away with growing mine at a professional job in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  And if those uptight, judgmental, elderly folk are religious -- you may wow them by referring to the Nazirite vow from the bible.  You know, Samson: the guy with 7 big dreads...  ymmv"
Dreadlocks,34z6cm,gensyms,2,Tue May 5 21:30:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes, and yes. If you explain to a fundamentalist Christian that you're dreading your hair to develop patience and faith and shun the world's aesthetics, they can't really find an argument against it. Especially when you bring up Samson, lol. If your dreadlocks are part of your spirituality, then if you are fired/discriminated against it is a crime.  Really, if you're gonna go ahead and dread your head, do it naturally. Its so satisfying to watch them form and change and shrink - unique and beautiful and all your own."
Dreadlocks,34z6cm,teatcream,0,Wed May 6 00:25:15 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, truueee that. ;]  Surprisingly, I already get away with messy hair because it's so curly."
Dreadlocks,34z6cm,knottysleeves,1 point,Thu May 7 15:45:53 2015 UTC,"Starter methods are done mainly to section your scalp and get some initial tangles & knots going. Both twist & rip and backcombing accomplish that nicely, there's really not much difference, so go with whichever feels more comfortable for you. That said, both methods can be damaging IF you do it too aggressively or repeatedly... so do it only once, and do it gently.  Keep in mind your hair is still going to look crazy for the first several months, no matter what starter method you use. Dread tams/hats and bands are your friends during that stage, if you want to avoid the sneers of judgmental types.  Check out Lazydreads on youtube, he has great tutorials for starter methods.

Dreadlocks,34wuv2,_remms_,5,Tue May 5 05:43:15 2015 UTC,Don't keep them in a ponytail for a couple of days. They'll lock together and form thin spots where the band is. Plus they'll mat quicker of you allow them to move around.

Dreadlocks,34qrot,Hazard_Lee,3,Sun May 3 19:10:12 2015 UTC,"The best stuff I've used to wash my hair, dreaded and undreaded, is with a rosemary tea no-poo shampoo.  Just brew some dried rosemary, strain it into a bottle once it's cooled, add a little baking soda and shake it. Then rinse  your hair under the hottest temp you  can take to loosen up gunk on your dreads and scalp, then pour the no-poo on your scalp, down your dreads. Massage that stuff in.  It smells good, rosemary is an anti fungicidal, the baking soda helps clean and tighten without leaving reside and you know what's in it.  I love it, and use it maybe every 3-4 days.  Its pretty cheap and I usually add the smallest amount of lavender oil to it before I put in the baking soda. Smells glorious."

Dreadlocks,34qrot,bug530,1 point,Sun May 3 20:07:58 2015 UTC,I have twists and put a stocking cap on and then rinse with a shampoo solution.  This usually loosens the twists to a certain extent but I think it's worth it.  I only do it once every week or two.  I have bad dandruff so I use coal tar shampoo (like T-gel) which is usually residue free and I've even heard it helps hair lock up faster.  They also make a dreadlock itch spray that helps a little as well.

Dreadlocks,34nvqs,DreadsUKdotCOM,1 point,Sat May 2 22:52:51 2015 UTC,"I think its dependant on what you wash with or dont to how often to do AVC.  If you're using just everyday regular shampoos (high residue build up) then frequent bs,ACV would be recommended If you're using a residue free dreadlocks shampoo. Less so if at all.  the trouble with supposed 'dreadlocks' shampoos is that its hard to tell if its actually any good for dreadlocks untill you have experience with it. It could be a very poorly made one and the BS-ACv will still need to be done just as frequently.  My advice would be to do it as less as possible as baking soda is a very very strong chemical and putting your hair through such dramatic extremes too often will damage your hair.  You're best placed to judge how your hair/dreadlocks feel. Just try it once and see how it feels :)"

Dreadlocks,34mfss,Hazard_Lee,4,Sat May 2 14:03:44 2015 UTC,Gonna go natural from here.   That's like Pamela Anderson declaring that she's going to have natural breasts from this point forward.
Dreadlocks,34mfss,gensyms,0,Sat May 2 14:08:27 2015 UTC,"Just because he didn't go the neglect route doesn't mean he can't go natural from this point. I used the backcomb method with a little bit of crocheting to start mine, but never used any products so I consider mine natural."
Dreadlocks,34mfss,Lucy_Foxx,6,Sat May 2 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"If you manufactured your dreads, they can never be natural.  That's not a value judgment: I think manufactured dreads are beautiful and in fact, my first set of dreads were backcombed.  Oh sure, manufactured dreads can be natural in the same sense of food products that have ""natural flavors"" on the package:  The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: “the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional.  Still a far cry from natural."
Dreadlocks,34mfss,gensyms,3,Sat May 2 15:11:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely right. It irks me a little when people say their dreads are all natural then go on to say how they're backcombed, TnRd, crocheted, interlocked, whatever. Natural dreadlocks, to me, are those that are created when one simply stops brushing and FORMED naturally. It's really something for someone to be proud of, and people that use a starter method and try to say their dreads are natural kinda cheapen truly natural dreadlocks. If someone uses wax or maintenance then decides to go ""natural"", then those dreads would be whatever starter method, product/maintenance free. Not natural though, by any means. A man cannot manufacture something natural. That's like saying I bought this synthetic plastic whatever, if I leave it alone from now on it'll be something natural.   Edit:added something."
Dreadlocks,34mfss,Sunshine492,1 point,Sun May 3 13:01:57 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but I think it comes down to difference of opinion. To me, natural dreads means no products were used. To each his own though."

Dreadlocks,34gqtg,Pumpkin_Blacky,4,Fri May 1 00:35:04 2015 UTC,"Don't do anything, loose hair is to be expected. Loosening hair is the only way dreadlocks form. You could tighten them up or redo them but they will only come out again.  6 inches is a lot but the only thing that matters is that each section is still twisted together at some point. If it falls out completely, then there is an argument for redoing it, but even that is optional.  My T&R dreads had close to 6 inches of loose hair but they figured themselves out and my hair wasn't as long as yours. There is nothing to worry about."
Dreadlocks,34gqtg,Carsandsarcasm,2,Fri May 1 02:05:48 2015 UTC,"There was a point when a few of my dreads had a lot of loose hair at the roots as well. Personally, I backcombed the roots and used a crochet hook to pull in the edges. You don't want to use the crochet hook too often though because it creates little holes in your hair and could cause weak spots in the long run - but once to help out your roots should not hurt :)"

I'm nearly done combing out my year old dreads and found that a large darning needle works better than a comb to tease out the knots.  Conditioner is also a big help. No matter how gentle you are, you will break hairs, but chances are some of them aren't attached to your head any more, and you'll feel the ones that still are!  Good luck!"
Dreadlocks,34dd7j,oddballa,1 point,Thu Apr 30 10:36:45 2015 UTC,"+1 on the Knottyboy kit being a waste of money. It's just industrial-strength conditioner. Coconut oil, olive oil, or even a super-cheap bottle of drugstore brand conditioner will do just as good a job.  That said, I find it easier to comb out locks when they're dry and don't have any conditioner, oil, or product on them.  Start at the tip and work your way up to the roots. Safest way is to use a needle to pick out the knots."

Now just need to get a new wagon and I'm set. :D"
Dreadlocks,347h5t,banana-mouse,3,Tue Apr 28 22:23:02 2015 UTC,"Runner & racer here. The first year or so you won't notice much difference. Once they mature and gain volume though, eeek... I had to start trimming mine regularly at year 2.  I found it more comfortable to wear a headband so the dreads could move freely (and out of my face), rather than tying them back. The weight got distributed better that way.  And well... I combed mine out at year 7 because they got too annoying for both running and swimming. But I have a sensitive scalp and am too lazy to fuss with my hair much. So YMMV. But as I said, you won't notice much difference the first year."
Dreadlocks,347h5t,knottysleeves,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:33:30 2015 UTC,I run with my locks just fine. I also prefer wearing a bandana to tying them back. I just trimmed mine to shoulder length and love it! They are so light and cute!

Dreadlocks,33z2mn,__ohmygatos,4,Mon Apr 27 00:03:22 2015 UTC,Your dreads are amazing!  Is it not awkward to style your hair the way it is? I can't see too well coz I'm on mobile but it looks like your fringe and the front parts of your hair aren't dreaded. How do you manage to keep all of it in a healthy condition?
Dreadlocks,33z2mn,QWOP_Sparkle,3,Mon Apr 27 10:08:59 2015 UTC,"Most asked question by far!  You're right! The front of my hair and a little along the nape of the neck isn't dreaded. Basically I just wash that part normally every other day or so, and then tie my dreads back, trying to get as little water and shampoo on them as possible. I only wash my dreads every 10-14 days or so. I've never really had a problem with keeping the dreaded/non dreaded hair separate."
Dreadlocks,33z2mn,bead4lyfe,3,Mon Apr 27 14:50:19 2015 UTC,"I have my hair done the same way, and do exactly this. I like having my bangs and a little loose hair to play with/style whenever."

Dreadlocks,33z5ak,Renon,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:21:09 2015 UTC,I found just seperate and roll regularly helps HEAPS. That and get them crocheted/tightened every so often
Dreadlocks,33zy5o,earthisdumb,6,Mon Apr 27 05:01:22 2015 UTC,"Ah man, I'm in almost the exact same boat as you!  Mine have had a little longer to mature, (about 8 or 9 months or so I think) and I've just gotten used to the technique of crocheting. I think I'll still need to be doing it a bit longer to confirm my findings, but this is what I have discovered thus far.   No matter how much or how often you crochet, you're gunna have those strays down the length of the dread for a long time. As far as I've seen, the only way to get rid of those is to wait for them to get sucked into the dread. It'll take a while, mine have barely started. Crocheting is a great way to maintain particularly messy or loopy dreads in the short-term, but crochet literally undoes all of the ""natural dreading"" that your hair does by itself. You know those really tight parts of lock? The thick ropes that are almost solid? All of that lovely tightness has come from your hair moving against each other, being subject to sun, and the hair just generally locking due to friction. This is the best way for dreads to lock, and the most secure. Sticking a crochet hook through them constantly might pull in a few extra hairs while you're doing it, and tidy it up at the time, but once those hairs have moved on to different parts of the dread, the dread now has to replace the hair that was moved out of the way when you pushed the hook through, naturally. Do this too many times to the same dread, and you'll start to find it actually loosens instead of tightening. Salt Spray. I fucking love this shit. 1-2 teaspoons of sea salt into a spray bottle of water, mixed with some tea-tree and your favourite essence (vanilla, peppermint, orphans tears, w/e) not only will make your dreads smell great, but the salt will promote quicker and better drying, which in turn promotes natural locking. I will usually salt spray after every standard wash, and after I do a particularly long crochet session. If you salt spray and let your hair dry in the sun, you should almost be able to feel how much better it makes your locks. Crocheting is best used to ""guide"" your dreads to somewhat grow into the way you want them. You could spend 30 hours getting each and every individual hair into place, but by the time you've walked out the door or slept in a bed overnight, your hair is going to be on its way back to the way it wants. Like previous, if you've got a dread that is particularly loose or out of shape, use the crochet to give the hair an idea of where they're supposed to be, but let them work the rest out themselves.    To summarize, I've so far got my routine down as such:  Wash-Day = Salt spray after shower, 10-20 mins in the sun, no crochet ALL DAY. (Trust me, your dreads are doing their own thing today)  1-2 Days after Wash-Day= Nothing!  3+ days after washing= Regular (but minimal) maintenance crochet. (I normally bring my kit with me everywhere I go, and if I find a nasty loops while I'm out I'll just quickly whip a needle out and take care of it.  Once a month= Sit down in front of the mirror and tighten the roots a bit. I get some ridiculous flyaways around my fringe and roots at the back of my head, so I have to keep on top of these because I'm shit-scared of congo's and beavertails.   Once every 6-8 Months= Go get a professional, all-over crochet. I cannot recommend this enough. I would always say to spend as much as you can afford on this, as generally (where I come from anyway) the more you pay, the better job they will do. A professional loqtician will know a million-and-one things about proper maintenance, how your hair grows, what your scalp is doing etc. etc. Having someone else do it will not only ensure you get full coverage on any bits you've missed, but will see that you get a proper job done and plenty of advice to go with it.   I think that's most of what I've got to offer at this point. I'm not gunna go into washing routines and ACV rinses because I'm sure you've heard enough about that by now. I'll comment here if I think of anything else, otherwise you're more than welcome to send me a PM if you've got questions :)  edit: Words and stuff"
Dreadlocks,33zy5o,Silverslade1,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:39:21 2015 UTC,This was SO HELPFUL! Thank you for taking the time to explain in detail for us noobs :)
Dreadlocks,33zy5o,canadianhikers,3,Mon Jun 1 17:36:53 2015 UTC,"So i crochet my dreads about once a week. When i do it i try to avoid doing the roots or anywhere that the dread feels nice and tight. I focus more on the middles and tips, tidying it up. Normally after 2 or 3 washes(about a week), most of it has come out, but not all. When i first started crocheting, i could spend 6-8 hours on them in order to get them tidy looking, now it's about 2 hours, so there's definitely less loose hair in there. As mentioned by /u/Silverslade1 if you're crocheting the already maturing parts, you could potentially be undoing progress. I don't feel i UNDO any progress, however, as i said, i try to only get the loose parts.   Personally, i have a limit to just how messy i'll let my dreads look, so crocheting helps me not feel like i look homeless, but that's just myself. I would rather look tidy and have my dreads take longer to mature. They are still maturing, you can see the overall improvement in the dreads over time.   Ultimately, everyone has their own thoughts on how to maintain dreads, and what works for one won't be the best solution for someone else. I suggest trying for yourself to find what works best. I've had dreads since October '14 and i'm still learning about how to best maintain my hair"
Dreadlocks,33yc1e,pygmy_borborygmi,3,Sun Apr 26 20:20:33 2015 UTC,"it's possible that you're not seeing broken hairs, but rather hairs that have naturally fallen out of your scalp. people with loose hair shed old hairs all the time--with dreadlocks, they stay locked in and just chill in your dreads forever. these hairs tend to have tiny little white-ish-clear ""bulbs"" at the end indicating that the hair root came out."
Dreadlocks,33yc1e,sydn00b,2,Sun Apr 26 22:30:55 2015 UTC,"Did you by any chance use a crochet hook to start off your dreadies, or maintain the loose hairs? Overusage of that could lead to broken hairs and thin spots. Unfortunately I'm not too sure what to do about it, but dreadlocks are tough as nails, unless the dread feels like a tug will rip it out, then I am sure it's nothing to worry about :)"
Dreadlocks,33yc1e,dreadmek,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:26:47 2015 UTC,I did use a crochet hook when I started off. I haven't used it in a while  though so I am hoping that the newer growth will be healthier.   I hope that the crochet hook is the only reason I have these broken hairs...
Dreadlocks,33yc1e,dreadmek,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:29:59 2015 UTC,"That may be the cause, then. Honestly, if you've only used it once, then your locs shouldn't start breaking hairs on their own. Hope I helped you out!"

Dreadlocks,33nsxe,gensyms,3,Fri Apr 24 14:31:43 2015 UTC,"Not to make light of your situation, but this just reminded me of my experience.  For a while, I thought I had lice. Long story short, I was just freaking out about how itchy my scalp was when I first got them installed. I know better now XD.  I did the cayenne pepper thing too, but used way too much cayenne. I couldn't get all of it out, and ended up with millions of little red fibres all throughout my dreads. I was devastated. I knew how long it would take to get it all out.  Once it dried, though, the cayenne would pretty much just shake out fairly easily, which meant I moulted pepper for the next three days.  What ended up happening, the day after I did the cayenne wash I went out clubbing with some mates. Somewhere through the night, one of us got a bit rowdy and we drew the attention of a group of angry youths. They followed us after we left and ended up attacking us in an alleyway. Two guys came at me and somewhere amongst the kerfuffle I must have been moving my head around quite a lot. Within seconds they both backed off and started covering their faces, rubbing their eyes. It took me a split second to work out what had happened, cue immediate and most intense headbanging of my life. I shit you not, 4 out of 5 of the attackers were completely blinded to the point where they were staggering away in tears and the other guy must have given it up as a lost cause. We walked away unscathed with all our possessions intact. To this day, I have no idea how it didn't affect me, but who was I to question fate?  I was Jordan Pepper-dreads for the next few weeks."

Dreadlocks,33inst,jckozi,11,Wed Apr 22 20:51:57 2015 UTC,"Great locks! I'm working on mine :)  Quick yoga tip: whenever doing tree pose try your hardest not to put your foot on your knees. Always above the knees, upper thigh is ideal! (and that applies to all of yoga/stretching actually.... don't put weight or pressure perpendicular to any joint because you could get seriously hurt.)"
Dreadlocks,33inst,Stefawnayy,5,Wed Apr 22 21:05:11 2015 UTC,Thanks! Great tip!

Dreadlocks,33ietz,Dando206,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:46:29 2015 UTC,Only 8 months?! Those look pretty locked. Just started mine 2 weeks ago. Hopefully they mature as fast as yours :)
Dreadlocks,33ietz,gingerfr0,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:00:06 2015 UTC,I have had them tightened a few times and I feel they are coming along nicely :)
Dreadlocks,33jvxz,fauvism,4,Thu Apr 23 02:45:28 2015 UTC,"Think of it as a learning experience -- now you know what NOT to do the second time around. :-)  Regular separating is mandatory (unless you want a giant painful congo). Especially in the first year. And ESPECIALLY if you have partial dreads, because as you discovered, all that adjoining loose hair is going to get sucked in. You need to commit to checking them daily. Make it a habit -- do it right before or after brushing your teeth in the morning, so you won't forget.  Your scalp went insane because your dreads were congoing and irritating your scalp. If you stay on top of things this time, you'll be a lot more comfortable. Good luck!"
Dreadlocks,33jvxz,knottysleeves,2,Thu Apr 23 03:42:04 2015 UTC,I'll try to adopt the habit of separating my hair this time. Thanks for the advice!
Dreadlocks,33jvxz,alfie_,2,Thu Apr 23 22:05:51 2015 UTC,When I had dreads I washed every 2-3 days and gave myself a head massage between washes to stimulate the blood flow in my scalp. Make sure you drink lots of water as well!
Dreadlocks,33jvxz,blackbeltnerd,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:14:47 2015 UTC,"I actually washed the same amount and massaged my scalp as well. If I give it another go, I'll be sure to drink a crap ton of water cause I do forget a bunch. Thanks!"
Dreadlocks,33jvxz,blackbeltnerd,2,Thu Apr 23 03:22:28 2015 UTC,"agree with knottysleeves, although i'll say from my experience that partial dreads are really difficult to maintain. i had about half of my head dreaded and only made it a month or two before i just did my whole head, because the constant combining and ripping apart of my roots and trying to comb my hair but roll my dreads was too much. if you loved your dreads so much, just do em all :)"
Dreadlocks,33jvxz,Endoroid99,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:58:02 2015 UTC,"I wanted my whole head but I was trying to be respectful of my mother not wanting me to have a whole head of dreads. I did think maintaining it was harder than how most people described having dreads, but nobody really said what partials were like. I've totally been intending on dreading my whole dead at the start of summer, thanks for your comment!"
Dreadlocks,33jvxz,knottysleeves,2,Thu Apr 23 22:08:21 2015 UTC,"i totally understand, that's why i tried to do partial locks as well but it was just way too difficult! my parents didn't love my dreadlocks when i first got them, but after they matured and started looking better they've come to accept them more. i also kept my bangs undreaded, which makes them look a wee bit neater in the front"
Dreadlocks,33jvxz,Endoroid99,2,Fri Apr 24 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"I still use head and shoulders, but I try to just wash my scalp with it. I then use plain bar soap after to wash my whole head. Otherwise my head gets itchy and flaky. Oh and I wash twice a week"
Dreadlocks,33jvxz,Lovelyhippie420,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:20:41 2015 UTC,I was just too afraid of using the head and shoulders just on my scalp cause I figured I'm kind of a mess and would end up getting it in some of my dreads and start getting buildup. I'll definitely do that occasionally if my scalp really bothers me this time. Thanks for sharing your experience!
Dreadlocks,33j6w5,5e7h0m4s,8,Wed Apr 22 23:11:24 2015 UTC,"Get thee an inflatable hair washing basin! It is the single most useful purchase I made in 14 years of having dreads.  I put it on the floor, lie down with a good book, and soak my dreads for 30 minutes."
Dreadlocks,33j6w5,knottysleeves,2,Thu Apr 23 00:52:11 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for this recommendation!! Mine is in its way.

Dreadlocks,33j6w5,funkytownman,2,Thu Apr 23 01:44:41 2015 UTC,"I had a photo of my setup but it's disappeared. I'll explain it but the main point is to get creative and feel it out.  I take 3 cushions from my couch and stack them. Then I lay back on them and dunk my head into a standard bucket. It takes a minute or so of wiggling around to find the point where my neck isn't uncomfortable on the rim of the bucket and all my hair is all in, but I can lay like that without any discomfort for the 20 minutes it takes for me to get bored.   I've heard of people laying on a skateboard and dunking into a wide, square bucket too but the principle is the same; find ways to vary your head's elevation from the water and tinker with it until you figure something out."

Dreadlocks,33iesm,traginus,4,Wed Apr 22 19:46:14 2015 UTC,I personally don't have any decorations in my dreads but if I were to do so I would likely get wooden beads or decoration that are of an earthy tone.

Dreadlocks,33iesm,PM_me_cool_dinosaurs,3,Thu Apr 23 05:29:15 2015 UTC,"Earth tones. Like various browns, olive green, grays, etc. If you're thinking about beads; simple ones, earth tones and wooden. Things that aren't very flashy."

Dreadlocks,33j51w,MwamWWilson,3,Wed Apr 22 23:31:13 2015 UTC,"Don't sweat it.  Three months is such a tiny, infinitely insignificant amount of time for dreadlocks -- and you really shouldn't expect decent progress for at least another year.  Oh sure, some people's dreads mature much faster -- but they're the outliers.  Mine took a few years to start looking good.    YMMV.  The thing about dreadlocks is that they're teaching you things.  What those things are is different for everybody.  But one of those things is almost always patience.  Patience and faith.  It'll all work out just fine if you give the universe time to work her magic."
Dreadlocks,33j51w,gensyms,2,Thu Apr 23 12:18:19 2015 UTC,"It's normal, and they will thicken. I always thought I'd done my twist and rip sections too tight because that braid pattern seemed immovable, but it was fine. 3 months is early too. Mine didn't start looking halfway reasonable for 7-8."
Dreadlocks,33j51w,Carsandsarcasm,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:51:45 2015 UTC,"It's all normal and nothing to worry about. That's exactly how the dreading process works. Some days it might even look like your dreads are unravelling and regressing -- they're not. Have faith in the process, stuff them under a hat or dreadband on the annoying days, and don't micro-manage them. They'll turn out just fine."
Dreadlocks,33j51w,knottysleeves,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:58:50 2015 UTC,"I think the general idea of TnR is just to give your hair a shove in the right direction towards locking naturally. Keeps them in their own sections so they dread together by themselves. You couldn't possibly get those long, thick, tidy dreads via installation."
Dreadlocks,33jxrk,mrcroc123,4,Thu Apr 23 03:01:41 2015 UTC,"Read this previous post (found through searchbar for ""parents"", there are a few other good posts there): http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreadlocks/comments/1da93z/cant_get_enough_of_parents_complaining_about/  Are you living at home and financially dependent on your mom? If so and she's totally resistant, you might be better served waiting until you can move out. Dreads are awesome, but your peace of mind and a good relationship with your parents are more important. IMO."
Dreadlocks,33jxrk,knottysleeves,2,Thu Apr 23 03:45:37 2015 UTC,"How old are you?  In general, I'd say you should wait until you're an adult before doing those things your parents don't want you to do.  Your parents and siblings are the only people on the planet who actually truly give a shit about you -- misguided though they may be.  Having said that -- ask her what her objection is.  More than likely she is laboring under some misconception and you'll be able to convince her that her objection is unfounded.  And if you frame the conversation such that you do respect her authority and would like to have her blessings to do something like this while you're still under her protection and care -- she'll be more likely to actively help you rather than hinder.  And if not -- wait.  You literally have your whole life ahead of you, in which you can grow dreadlocks."

Dreadlocks,33fvjf,lunarm0xie,5,Wed Apr 22 04:35:09 2015 UTC,"Longtime henna user here.  Henna is permanent. It can't be bleached out (as you discovered) and dye-stripping products won't help either.  Your two best solutions are either dyeing a darker colour over top, or doing regular baking soda washes and deep-clean soaks to try and dull the pigment (but it will also dry your hair out a ton). Good luck!"
Dreadlocks,33fvjf,knottysleeves,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:50:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I figured.  Thank you so much!"
Dreadlocks,33fvjf,Hybrid-,3,Wed Apr 22 22:58:15 2015 UTC,"Henna works by binding the keratin in your hair which makes it go that red-orange color, which is permanent. Bleaching and dying products will be pretty much ineffective, time is what you need! I recommend washing with baking soda and doing a few deep cleanses and hopefully it should start to fade for you, Jah bless!"
Dreadlocks,33fvjf,Sunshine492,2,Wed Apr 22 10:39:12 2015 UTC,"Bah, of course.  I shall try some BS/ACV washes for the next few weeks!  Much love."
Dreadlocks,33fvjf,Sunshine492,2,Wed Apr 22 22:59:18 2015 UTC,"It seems other users have answered how to get it out but I just want to add that LUSH shampoo bars are typically not residue free, I think ONE is but I forget what it's called, I'm fairly certain that I Love Juicy is NOT residue free which can cause some serious problems down the road with continued use. I really suggest switching to a clarifying or dread shampoo.    Edit:spelling and added info."
Dreadlocks,33fvjf,Lovelyhippie420,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:24:39 2015 UTC,Oh!  Thank you so much.  I'll have to update my old co-workers at LUSH then.
Dreadlocks,33fvjf,traginus,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:58:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think although I'm not positive that squeaky green is residue free, but lush products are designed for brushed hair so they typically contain conditioning ingredients. Sometimes if I don't have the money to get some good shampoo (like dreadlockshampoo.com, dolly locks, vital goods) I'll just use suave clarifying shampoo (98¢ at Walmart) it's not good at all as far as chemicals go but it works great on my dreads when I'm strapped for cash or I'll do bs/acv rinses. But it's really hard to tell what truly is residue free or not, like the bars from dreadlockshampoo leave some residue because of the bentonite clay, but that can be taken care of with monthly deep cleans. But it's not going to hurt your dreads much if you use a shampoo that leaves a residue a couple times. Just don't use it often, just rarely or if you don't have anything else available and make sure you deep clean."
Dreadlocks,33fvjf,CaresforHairs,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:36:40 2015 UTC,"I'm new to dreading, so Idk, but maybe the hair primer at the drug store? I also just read you can get fruit based hair stripper, so it's not a chemical hair stripper, but I think only hair salons have it. But you could try sallys."
Dreadlocks,33fur2,BigBrandes,12,Wed Apr 22 04:26:56 2015 UTC,"If a deep clean loosens anything it's because residues were gluing hairs together.  Thus, those hairs weren't locked in the first place.  Just stuck together with nassssty residues.  It's never too early to have clean hair.  And really, who cares if they loosen a bit.  The knots are easily startled.  But they'll be back.  And in greater numbers."

Dreadlocks,33fur2,WelshElf,2,Fri Apr 24 02:04:27 2015 UTC,After 7 months they should be fine for a deep clean.
Dreadlocks,33fur2,TSIashleigh,2,Wed Apr 22 05:17:34 2015 UTC,I've always done deep cleans monthly from my first month of not brushing till now. I totally agree with gensyms. Whenever I do a deep clean my hair typically feels knottier. The cleaner your hair is the more it'll want to tangle.

Dreadlocks,33fur2,Carsandsarcasm,0,Thu Apr 23 01:54:18 2015 UTC,"Just avoid baking soda, it pulls color pigments from your hair and really dries it out. Source: me deep cleansing twice and my hair color got lighter and my hair became more brittle."

Dreadlocks,33dypg,gensyms,2,Tue Apr 21 21:02:06 2015 UTC,I'm gonna guess you sleep on your right side usually? If you try to sleep on your left side more it should even it out eventually. If you backcomb that side and leave the other side natural there's going to be a huge difference in the way each side looks. I'm 13 months in and one side still feels more mature than the other side (they look about the same though) because of how I sleep. So just try getting more friction to that side.
Dreadlocks,33dypg,Sunshine492,2,Tue Apr 21 19:26:11 2015 UTC,Alright yeah that's about what I'm doing - been there for about a month. I wanted these to teach me patience so I guess they're doing their job!
Dreadlocks,33dypg,Sunshine492,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:42:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. Patience is definitely a must for dreadlocks. Even at their worst, always keep in mind they WILL look better in time if left alone. Another bit about backcombing one side; if. You do that, that side will be basically startin over in the process, the backcombing will loosen, and you'll have one side half-mature and the other will be babies. Generally not a good idea. Lol. But you can always backcomb everything (natural/""neglect"" is SOOOO much more rewarding and unique though) but again, you'll just be starting over at day one with 6 months of progress lost. I say just tough it out, it WILL get better. One thing I've learned from having dreads is what you think looks horrible (loose hairs, uneven dreads, parts that lay funny or stick out, etc) generally aren't noticable to others."
Dreadlocks,33dypg,Sunshine492,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:09:14 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right. I think I can resist back combing them now I see it like that. I probably need to stop touching them so much too
Dreadlocks,33dypg,tropicaldreadlock,2,Tue Apr 21 20:54:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, constant touching or messing with them won't do them any favors, other than separation as needed. Around 6 months I was separating at least once a day, sometimes twice a day."
Dreadlocks,33dypg,Sizzmandan,2,Tue Apr 21 21:13:07 2015 UTC,"I grew my hair by neglect but, after more than 6 months, figured that time can't do everything on its own. That's when I went to my friend with a crochet and some dready cream. I'm satisfied with my hair"
Dreadlocks,33dypg,Hybrid-,2,Wed Apr 22 09:35:09 2015 UTC,Time could have definitely done it on its own but there's no issue with speeding things up a little if you so choose. I don't think you should get down voted for giving op completely reasonable advice. This isn't r/neglectdreadlocks people

I already have dreads, so I havent noticed much of a difference.  I know you probably don't want to hear this, but gaining patience for your hair to grow now, will only prepare you for all the patience you'll need once you stop brushing."
Dreadlocks,33duql,Prismine,8,Tue Apr 21 20:01:17 2015 UTC,It's true. Dreads are not a hairstyle for anyone wanting quick results. It's like maintaining a garden on your head

Dreadlocks,33duql,gensyms,2,Tue Apr 21 21:06:05 2015 UTC,Biotin and drinking at least 5-6 liters of water per day. Also eat a full diet that is healthy and don't overeat. Also don't die the ever living shit out of your hair if you wanna dye it just let it be dyed and don't touch it for a few months.

Then again I have no idea what its like to maintain dreads for 8 years. Im about a year and a half in and am already fed up with maintenance lol. Just food for thought.."
Dreadlocks,338iqg,Critterpillar,2,Mon Apr 20 19:33:20 2015 UTC,"Got to that point last year myself, after 7 years. Same reasons -- I'm very active (running and swimming) and simply got fed up with dealing with them. Special swim caps for dreads were useless for lap swimming... I got tired of having to wash on a schedule (and early enough in the day so they'd have time to dry)... running  & racing with all that extra weight on my head was not fun, especially since I'm already prone to migraines.  I loved my dreads, but I loved my lifestyle more, and decided they couldn't keep coexisting in a manageable way.  I combed them out last September, and it was actually a relief to have ""regular"" hair again. Now I can spontaneously decide to go for a run or a swim without any planning or having to rethink my washing schedule or whatever. Honestly, it is bliss and freedom.  I don't regret letting them go AT ALL (except now I can't take promotional headshots to advertise my dread sleeves :-)  My first set lasted almost 7 years as well, and I combed them out for similar reasons. Just got tired of dealing with them. I started my second set less than a year later though... so who knows. I have a feeling I'll be a dreadhead again one day, when the time is right. But for now, I'm super happy having a break from them."
Dreadlocks,338iqg,knottysleeves,2,Mon Apr 20 19:44:11 2015 UTC,Wait?what?!
Dreadlocks,338iqg,MwamWWilson,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:07:38 2015 UTC,Yup. All gone. :-) I just never announced it.
Dreadlocks,338iqg,knottysleeves,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:38:22 2015 UTC,I can't believe it. Did you keep them for later?
Dreadlocks,338iqg,MwamWWilson,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:00:24 2015 UTC,"No, I combed them out. I chopped half the length off first for the super-long ones, but didn't keep them. All the cuttings went into the compost. :-)"
Dreadlocks,338iqg,knottysleeves,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:13:21 2015 UTC,I feel like id make some kinda art with them lol great story :)
Dreadlocks,338iqg,JoseNova,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:15:08 2015 UTC,I think if I was swimming regularly I would probably keep my dreads short (and mine are already pretty short right now) or not have them at all.  Fortunately I swam competitively my entire youth and got almost entirely sick of it during that time. I love jumping in the lake but rarely if ever swim laps.   I can't blame you at all for cutting them off and I'm glad you're happy with the decision.
Dreadlocks,338iqg,only_one_contact,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:09:18 2015 UTC,"I think it'll be best to cut it and regrow, enjoy yourself without hair for a minute. It'll always grow back then its another process. Ive had mine for 7 years, I am feeling the same way about my hair. Still love my locks tho"
Dreadlocks,336lxw,12thStoryLighys,2,Mon Apr 20 00:58:03 2015 UTC,"You could make them yourself, by buying some hair, although it takes forever. I'd suggest human over synthetic, so you can dye it to match your own color. Buying already made extensions can get very pricey, but etsy has tons."
Dreadlocks,336lxw,ZenEnjoy,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:41:05 2015 UTC,"Cost depends on who's doing it and how much experience they have. Every dreadlock stylist / salon charges differently. Find some dread salons in your area and get price quotes.  It will likely (and should) cost a lot though, like several hundred USD (I assume you're in the States). You're paying for labour costs -- dread installation takes several hours of hard & tiring work -- plus the cost of the extensions. And good human hair extensions aren't cheap."
Dreadlocks,336lxw,knottysleeves,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:13:08 2015 UTC,"Making it yourself is good. Depending on the hair. You can use synthetic hair which are $1. Gotta work with it, though. Backcomning can take some time and just crochet it. What i like to do afterwards is steam it to seal it. BUT you can get human hair or whatever. Do the same thing and just attatch it to your dreads but theyre more pricey. Unless you want temporary. Then the first thing I said. Now, if you find online usually theyre pretty pricey because it takes effort and time to even make them.i asked someine since they make them pretty well and its around $300 or more . If you want them but have no time to make them yourself then ok. Because my mistake one time i was rushing and they just didnt turn out great."
Dreadlocks,334x9f,5nit,3,Sun Apr 19 16:13:35 2015 UTC,"I had extensions in that I didnt want anymore. I ended up taking them out and re-dreading the hair without the extension. It took a really long time to do, but I am so happy that I did it. Having just your own hair feels much more comforting, I find."
Dreadlocks,334x9f,pygmy_borborygmi,3,Sun Apr 19 23:51:47 2015 UTC,"I'd just trim them. Cut a bit off, and then if you want to cut more, you will still have the option. It's a lot easier to trim them that feel you need to install new ones."
Dreadlocks,334x9f,Carsandsarcasm,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:09:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice!
Dreadlocks,334x9f,MwamWWilson,2,Mon Apr 20 05:59:01 2015 UTC,What do you want?
Dreadlocks,334x9f,supfaggot,2,Sun Apr 19 18:05:04 2015 UTC,I don't really know. But I want to make them shorter for the summer.  Edit: So I guess I want too.
Dreadlocks,334x9f,salt-lick,2,Sun Apr 19 20:02:44 2015 UTC,Sport short dreads. They might suit you. I definitely miss when my dreads were short...
Dreadlocks,334x9f,knottysleeves,2,Mon Apr 20 04:23:39 2015 UTC,"My extensions took my shoulder length-ish hair down to belly button length. I took them out about 18 months ago maybe? I'd had them in for a few years. I didn't regret removing them at all! It was a nice feeling to be left with just my own hair! I've had a few issues with tip breakage since, but the ends were damaged from the process of putting them in in the first place.  How long is your hair without the extensions?"
