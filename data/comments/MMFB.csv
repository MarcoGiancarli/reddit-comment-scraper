They're not the ones living in your skin and walking in your shoes - you are. I've seen some vile atheist stuff around the internet, and all I think when one of them is mouthing off is ""good luck with that cancer diagnosis, hon"". A belief in a higher power/God/religion does take a lot of balls. If it feels right to you to have this belief, well then by all means explore it. Stay on your own path and start believing in yourself also, OP. That's the key to this whole thing."

MMFB,3e5gg9,alawa,3,Wed Jul 22 05:07:16 2015 UTC,"What you believe in is nobody's business but yours. Some people are just insecure and need to mock other peoples beliefs because it's the only way they can strengthen their own. Whether you decide to be an atheist or religious is up to you. I know reddit has some great religious subreddit like /r/Christianity, /r/judaism, /r/islam, and /r/Buddhism."
MMFB,3e5gg9,illjustdrag,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:49:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, a lot of that can go from personal perspective to ego-stroking mockery in a heartbeat.  I did visit r/Christianity a few times since my family is somewhat Catholic and I wanted to recontexualize my experiences with that faith in relation to my new perspective. There are some great posters in there for sure but lot of silly arguing there as well. Not that I'm trying to completely ignore ""challenging"" new perspectives but it's exhausting you know!  Thank you"
MMFB,3e5gg9,illjustdrag,3,Wed Jul 22 05:11:51 2015 UTC,"Athiest here:  At least the way my philosophy on life goes, just do what makes sense to you and what makes sense to your reality. It's the best thing for you. In my world view, you only have one chance at existence, don't waste it doing or believing things that don't make you happy and don't fulfill you as a person.  You're not dumber for believing in God. That's absolutely ridiculous, it's the same as when people say I'm naive for not believing in God. It has no basis on intelligence, some of the smartest people I know are religious or even spiritual. It's just how you stand on a position, nothing more.  And no matter what you believe, you're going to have to deal with people ridiculing you and mocking you for it. Because if they believe something else, inherent in that belief is ""I'm right, you're wrong."" If I say ""I believe in God"" obviously I believe people that don't are wrong. It's how you handle this realization and how much weight you put in that ends up spiraling someone into believing terrible things about the other side. It's just part of the human condition and the experience. Don't worry about what other people believe or think about what you believe. Just do what is necessary for your life.  EDIT: And for the record, I can't stand /r/athiesm or most internet discussion about religion...or Dawkins xD"
MMFB,3e5gg9,TheSilverwolfKnight,2,Wed Jul 22 04:23:10 2015 UTC,"You're completely right. I'm too intimidated by other people's portrayal of authority whether it be intellectual or otherwise. I really need to focus on my own reality rather than trying to be copacetic with somebody else's.  And I completely agree about the intelligence thing. People really like to create a dichotomy between rationality and faith, and while there are some beliefs that refuse to take into account extremely important scientific evidence, I know mine certainly never will be guilty of that... I wouldn't last long as a biologist!  Thank you! Fantastic advice.  And yeah, even at the peak of my edgy atheism I never could tolerate r/atheism or how Dawkins became this weird xenophobic, mean-spirited cartoon character. You're a good apple my friend."
MMFB,3e5gg9,nastibrutishort,2,Wed Jul 22 05:22:21 2015 UTC,"I honestly think all the angry athiesm comes from either one or two things:  1) A kind of ""honeymoon"" period with atheism. You start to feel part of something right and morally superior and many intelligent people are also athiest therefore I'm intelligent by association. Which gives you the arrogance of an intelligent person, without the actual intelligence to back it up. Also the group furor that comes with it. There's a clear ""opponent"" and your new vigor has compelled you to write out passionate, hastely written, angry comments. :P  2)People like to build strawmen in their head. And people who hang out with people that only reinforce their prejudices against the ""opponents"" might begin to build a strawman representation of a typical member of the ""opponent."" I admit it, with many issues I've done this. I believe we all do it to some extent. Argue with someone in your head, etc. But the problem comes when there's so real exposure to the other side, because suddenly, everyone on the other side is this impossible strawman that one's constructed.  I guess both of those combine to make people say the things they do on the internet, or in real life. Well, not everyone...but some at least. But I don't know, I kind of went on a rant...sorry.   TL;DR Point is! No matter where your journey takes you. Just try to do what you feel is the right thing and what you think will lead to happiness. I hope the best!"
MMFB,3e5gg9,Mahovis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:42:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much!  I completely agree. I was guilty of both in terms of my atheism when I was in high school. I went to a Catholic high school which I honestly generally loved, but it allowed for quick access to religious sentiment for me to roll my eyes out and practice smug superiority with my secular friends.   Then you realize a few years later that you were a shithead a few years back so maybe its best to cool it with the Us vs Them mentality.  Thanks again man!"

I don't know anything about your family either. Are they supportive? If they are, keep them close and appreciate them. I have 2 little brothers of my own, and I can't imagine having them see me suffer. Spend time with your brother, spend time with your friends, surround yourself with things or people that make you happy. Just being able to reach out to people to help you is good, make sure you keep doing that. Always keep perspective. Always remember that whatever conditions you have aren't a choice, but how you chose to deal with them are. You are the boss of yourself.

You can take what you can get from him and try to think of him less and eventually either move on to someone else or enjoy the FWB thing, but don't kick yourself so hard for having feelings and wanting more.

This guy isn't the man you want him to be, and doesn't deserve to be put on the pedestal you've got him on. It will be tough, but for your own health and happiness you need to see this guy for what he is: an inconsiderate jerk who is using you. Gather up your strength and move on for good.

MMFB,3e2wsm,selectabyss,2,Tue Jul 21 18:35:40 2015 UTC,"Time seems to pass differently for us, as we get older. The next month or so of summer, or, say, the next few years, even, probably seem vast and significant to you, at your age. This will change, but because of your youthful perception of time (and of course the same for the people you seem to be worried about losing touch with), the idea of missing out on a month or two of social time seems devastating, like their entire world will move on, and you'll be irrelevant. I remember it well. I was removed from my friends for months when I was a teen. It was devastating as well, but the thing is you can ""return to the scene"" after a brief spell, nothing too terribly significant will likely have changed, and you might even enjoy the effect of being somewhat novel and exciting due to your absence.  Also, sometimes in our lives, especially when we're growing up, change happens. It'll happen if/when you go to college. It'll happen if/when you graduate/leave college. It'll happen when you take vacations. It'll happen when you take new jobs. At your age, change can seem like death. Watch, though, when old situations fall apart, new ones arise to take their place in your life. There are, I promise you, people that you have yet to meet, that will play immensely significant roles in your life. Once you've met them, you might notice how unbelievable it seems that there was a time that you were unaware of their existence, that you were worried about the potential diminishing of old friendships when such big, crucial events were right around the corner. I hope you can take some comfort in that. You can't see the future (probably), but it will be your present, soon enough, and you will have lived past these early scenes of change and upheaval.  As you get older, months will not appear so vast, and as everyone you know will also get older, and their perception of time will also change, you'll probably find that with some of your friends or acquaintances, depending upon how close they are, weeks or even months can pass between encounters, and that won't matter. You'll have your own shit to keep busy with. The nature of what friendship and ""hanging out"" mean to you will change and evolve. It won't always be so urgent or crucial to maintaining your sense of identity.  It's far more important that you get that studying done, so that you can move forward with your destiny, than it is that you were present for all the hanging out that happens this summer. This doesn't mean that you should be a workaholic recluse, or anything, but it does mean that you don't have to feel quite so dramatically anxious about missing out on a few things.  I hate to say it, but it is more than likely that your crush-relationship will fall apart eventually, and possibly a long series of relationships that you've yet to enjoy, and fuck up inevitably, and mourn, and learn from. That's life. Just know that it happens, and your life continues to move on and develop as time keeps on slippin', you know, into the future.  Brace yourself, kid, you have a LOT of life coming atcha. Don't despair too much, as your childhood passes behind you, and some relationships with it. It's inevitable, and you'll survive, and you'll begin to learn to recognize what is true and enduring in life, and what is short-lived and meant to pass.  I hope I don't come off as condescending or anything, it's just that I have experienced something like what you're going through, and I hope what I'm trying to tell you about time-perspective and change translates."

I'm sure that when I look back in a few years I'd think ''I was so young and naive'' or something like that, but it's hard to see your future when you see your present so dark from my point of view.

We're eons ahead of other animals. I think that excuse is pretty inadequate. Think about it. A human baby takes about 16 years to survive on its own. A 12 year old will not make it a day in the wild.

Make sure you understand your responsibilities with them....I had to call in or use a website every week by a certain time and day and certify I was looking for work and stuff.  Secondly, the thing you have to come to full terms with now (if you haven't) is that this was NOT YOUR FAULT. It was a business decision by the company and not something you did wrong. It is their loss because you are going to bring your awesome somewhere else now.  Get on LinkedIn if you aren't and start networking with everyone you know. Use that network to target new positions. LinkedIn has a job search, but you can do it based on where you want to work. If there is another company in town you want to be, find out if a friend of a friend works there and get introduced and try to get your resume on a hiring manager's desk.  I was laid off twice within one year. The first was from a job I really loved and liked the people and was at for a few years. The second was one I didn't like as much but paid REALLY well...I only had it 9 months. But now I work for an awesome company with great people, and although the switching around resulted in my pay and title lagging behind my friends, I'm happier now than i was at the others.  Consider this an opportunity to negotiate a better salary and vacation and to expand your experience, and make it your job to find a new job.  Good luck!"

You have to be confident though, it's the only way that you will improve over time. Remember, music is ultimately a representation of your own emotions, and if you're not feeling good about your music, you're going to have a tough time.  Here's what I'd do, and what I generally do myself when I feel like my music is uninspired. Listen to their music! If you feel that your competitors are making better music, then clearly they must know some tricks. Study their music, learn it inside and out, and apply what you learn to your own style. This is how every great musician learns.  It may take a long time. That's the thing about working in the arts, it really does take a LOT of work to master your art. You may be a good musician, but you need to focus now on becoming inspired. That is most likely the next step.  I hope I helped a little. Good luck! :)"

Like you said it could have been worse, and thankfully you escaped with what sound like only (relatively) minor injuries. The body has a pretty good way of healing itself, so odds are you won't be able to tell anything happened once it does. Even so, scars give people character, and can be something you come to see as unique. Finally, if you so chose, there are cosmetic surgery options to fix most things like that. But like I said, I'd wait to see what happens, let yourself heal first before you worry too much. And again (I repeat myself a lot), you survived! And I'm sure you're still a handsome/beautiful man/woman.  To maybe cheer you up a bit, here's a stupid story from when I was on a bike as a teenager: I had the brilliant idea of switching hands on the handlebars (left hand on right handlebar, etc). Well, my brain didn't register this switch, and as the bike started to pull right, I pulled in my left hand. This would have normally steered me to the left, but as my hands were reversed, I kept going right until I hit a brick wall sideways. I kind of veered into it, so the handlebars hit the wall and my thumb just got a bit banged up, but it could have been much worse.. and if anybody saw me I must have looked absolutely ridiculous haha.

Trust me, I'm still 1k and its been around a year for me. 1k solo is not easy to break, but going up by 200 is definitely a step in the right direction. Just remember that it's a team game and you're only as good as your team, but in 1k your team is usually only as good as your average pubbie who wants to be dendi. Once you get out of 1k it's smooth sailing since most people actually work as a team, but until then it's gonna take a lot of work. My suggestion is try working outside of the meta so that the enemy has no idea how they can counter you or even just play a super versatile hero such as visage or invoker so they will never know what to expect. 1k is much of a test of who knows the meta than who has more skill. Outdo their one line of defense and you have it in the bag. Best of luck :)"

Yeah it's hard out there I hope the tone of my post didn't make me seem like a teammate blamer. I try to get everyone on board with a coordinated effort but sometimes things don't work out well.  Playing a super versatile hero is an interesting idea. I'm pretty open to playing any hero in any role and try to pick strong counters to enemy heroes but focusing more might pay off.

Having low rated accounts to mess around on is fun. :)  Also, if you're anywhere below 5.5-6k it's all about walking up to the other guy and pressing the buttons that kill him, for easy heroes who do that I'd recommend QoP and Tuskar."
MMFB,3drrxc,aHkkA,17,Sat Jul 18 20:53:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe think about having a relationship first? If you only want sex, prostitutes will help you.   You sound desperate. This isn't helping. Women sense desperation.   If all you want is sticking your penis in a hole, try a fleshlight. Cause it sounds like you only want to get off, and really don't care about the other person that would be involved.  No one wants to be your sperm receptacle. Unless you pay them.   Counseling is your friend."
MMFB,3drrxc,RareBeautyEtsy,-1,Sat Jul 18 21:30:18 2015 UTC,"Much more interested in a relationship that involves sex than just sex with some random person.

Once I accepted that I was a broken person and unwanted, and no one would want to deal with my issues, and just stopped approaching women and actively opposed getting into any situation where I would have an opportunity to meet someone, well, no one still wanted to sleep with me.  But I'd accepted it, so it wasn't such a big deal. It hurts, but solitude hurts far far less than rejection. I'll take solitude any day.

That's  not bad. Why don't you finish up school and move out there with him? I had an ex who did something similar to me. I won't go into his issues but it sucks.

MMFB,3dmgo3,JHadenfe,7,Fri Jul 17 13:43:22 2015 UTC,"Hey you. There is this story floating around the internet about a small boy whose dog dies. And when everyone stands around the dog, crying, asking for a reason, cursing the fact that a dogs life is so short, the small boy pipes up and goes: ""I get it. I know why this happened. You see,  people are born so that they can learn how to live a good life – like loving everybody all the time and being nice, right?"" and then he says ""Well, dogs already know how to do that, so they don’t have to stay as long"".  I know this does not make her alive, neither will it make you miss her less. But by remebering all she gave you, all the happiness you two shared maybe your sadness will feel less painful and develop in something more like a bittersweet remebrance."

This is a huge thing you did and just concentrate on that and then when you are ready give another dog a chance too....it will never replace the one who died but it will help you heal and save another dog's life too.

MMFB,3dmgo3,AliceA,3,Fri Jul 17 15:59:02 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I'm planning on adopting my next one from the local humane society which is a dog and cat shelter where I used to volunteer.

You will forget one day soon and expect them to be there when you get home which will break your heart all over again BUT you will heal and one day you'll be able to talk about all the good memories and funny stories with a sense of ease and comfort.

My husband had one of his lungs collapse two different times, and was back to normal with a month each time.  The pneumonia may slow down her recovery, but basically healthy young women don't succumb to pneumonia or punctured lungs in this day and age.  Also, your grown friend was right in saying that medically induced comas are common.  I hadn't heard about the possibility of permanent brain damage resulting from one, but let me assure you that everyone I've known who has undergone one seemed mentally the same to me afterwards.  To take the edge off your panic, try some vigorous exercise, like running.  It should work off some nervous energy and give you some dopamine and endorphins to help you feel a little better."

I thought I was going to get some experience and then get back.    But then I met a girl. It was crazy. We sat on the bench watching the stars and talked until late nearly everyday despite the language barrier. We spend nearly all our free time together.    And until then very last night we cried. Talking about how things could never be. My heart was broken and I plan to do everything I can to come back and be with her. I registered for scholarship at the university I exchanged and I got it.    But when I got back my father was diagnosed with cancer. I had turned down the scholarship and stayed with my father. After 3 months, he passed. I still think about her nearly everyday. Upset about my fathers death and conflict in the family, everything led me to depression.    I fought it. I started to fight my sadness and anger hard. No one knew my complete story. It felt like a Spanish drama.    You will find your strength. In time.

You are far from the worst person ever. You didn't really do anything that bad.   You had one lousy relationship and maybe that has made you feel used, or worthless or filled with self-loathing. This has then made you act in all kinds of self destructive ways.   What you need to do is examine all that baggage, rationalize it and then let it go. Once you do that, you will feel that you can love other people, that you are worthy of being loved, and you can stop punishing yourself and berating yourself."
MMFB,3dh8hn,BiH_USA_Activist,2,Thu Jul 16 07:08:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much; I try to rationalize things, but I'm a little bit idealistic because I am an extreme perfectionist and I want everything to be the best it can be... so a rational PoV sometimes escapes me. But I do hope I can work on it."
MMFB,3dh8hn,BiH_USA_Activist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:35:45 2015 UTC,"It is one thing to be idealistic and perfectionists and quite another to call yourself a cum dump, or to hurt yourself and say that you deserve it, or that it would not be fair if you loved anyone.   If you were to treat someone else the way you treat yourself you would probably be arrested for abuse. You don't deserve all that abuse.   Part of your problem is that you care about people around you because you are a good person. If you did not care about others you would not care about hurting them and you would not have this self-loathing. If you did not care, you would have looked at all the bad decisions that you made, shrugged your shoulders and moved on. It is because you care that you agonize over your mistakes.  But the fact that you care means that you are a good person who deserves love and does not deserve abuse. That is the key!   Imagine a person who went trough similar problems as you and is now very self critical and depressed. Would you think that she is a bitch and a cum dump? Of course not!"
MMFB,3dh8hn,monkeyMan1992,2,Thu Jul 16 12:29:58 2015 UTC,"I feel that you're having a difficult time opening up to your boyfriend. As the first major piece of consolidation, think about how lucky you are that you've found such a great person, especially after that asshole  ex you had. Forget about what his friends say, you know the truth, and it doesn't matter what anyone else says, or believes. If you are able to isolate yourself from these friends, then do so as soon as possible, trust me I've been in a similar situation, they are not being your friends by ignoring your claim, but being his! That kind of negative energy is really powerful, and could well be a huge part of why you feel the need to self-harm, you went through a large amount of pain, and now the people you thought were the nearest to you, fail to acknowledge it.   If possible, try to share everything you have said here with your boyfriend, he sounds like a very caring person, and he really sounds like he wants to be there for you, give him the chance. When you love someone, disappointment by them is almost impossible. Nothing that happened to you was your fault, so why would he be disappointed. I know that opening up to other people is difficult, and tedious, but sometimes it's the best way to relieve yourself of all that emotional baggage that you are carrying, don't worry we all have some. Don't think that asking for financial help is a form of being needy, sometimes we all need a bit of help, and why would not eating help? Think about this as follows, you know that your boyfriend loves you very much, then know that he wants you to be healthy, and there for him. As far as I see it, therapy can very well be sessions where you and your boyfriend share your feelings, it's strange but these days many of us forget that, while we require some kind of intimacy from our partners, we don't require any emotional counselling, and that's crazy. You sound like a very complex, strong and resilient individual, all you need is to do is utilize the service of your boyfriend, have a good talk with him, about your financial situation, your career goals, and you emotional turmoil from the past. Most people are very compassionate, and remember when you're in a relationship you are like 1 unit, and entity, so the depression of one person will definitely affect the other. I don't know what else to say, other than just talk your situation out with someone, knowing that you're not a liar as your ""friends"" have made you feel is a very crucial step towards your healing. Finally one of the signs of growing up is that you're relationships tend to get very distant with other people, and start to focus around a few, make sure that you give your attention, but more importantly seek help from those few! One last thing, please don't over exert your body without adequate nourishment, you won't feel it now, but soon you'll have a bunch of health problems, just keep the ideal that you want to spend your time and energy with your boyfriend, and taking care of yourself, along with getting him to hear you out is the best way to achieve that. I hope you get better soon! Forget about the past, tomorrow is so much more hopeful!"

We had just started seeing each other in May.  This happened in the middle of June.  We went to a tequila festival where they had a margarita tasting.  We were having fun, grabbing two tiny samples at a time off of the tables etc.  I completely didn't pay attention to how much I was drinking.  I was fine until I wasn't.  I got sick in the bathroom at the place, I think.  I remember a girl asking me if I was okay.  I don't remember how he got me home.  But he got me home and was getting me some water, and I threw up all over myself and my sheets and everything.  He got me undressed and put me in the shower.  Then took my gross vomity dress, and gross vomity sheets and put them in a trash bag.  He got me out of the shower.  Got me the drink of water.  Made sure I was okay.  Then took my stuff to the laundromat.  (Well, okay, he tried to but it was closed.). And came back with a ginger ale to fix my stomach, and a Gatorade for when I woke up hung over the next day.  I never heard anything about it being a turn off.  (Though I'm sure in the moment it was completely not sexy.).   He does bring it up and tease me about it a little bit now that some time has passed.  But he's also told me about when he's done similar stupid things.  (Oh yeah, I was 28 at the time so it's not like I was a teenager or 21 and just learning my limits.).   But yeah, any person worth their salt won't let one think like that ruin your relationship or their attraction to you."

MMFB,3d29pa,staybuckyUW,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:23:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm, not even offering you water? It sounds like his disgust was stronger than his empathy for you. What if you get legitimately ill at some point, in some non-sexy way. What would his response be? I'm guessing he would be turned off, and that would override how much he cared for you. It's definitely something to reflect on, because he sounds incredibly non-generous (and pretty judgmental also.) Not saying go dump the guy instantly, but if you find yourself walking on eggshells at other times too... consider finding someone else who you can relax around and know you're supported and liked-- not that it's all going to disappear if you make a mistake (like being emotionally vulnerable and asking if he really likes you, or accidentally drinking too much, etc.) Because once you find someone who is on your side no matter what, you won't believe the time you wasted on someone whose kindness was conditional! (At least in my experience.) Good luck!"
MMFB,3d29pa,staybuckyUW,2,Mon Jul 13 19:45:25 2015 UTC,I honestly don't see the problem with you saying do you really like me. Like obviously I know neither of you but it just doesn't seem like something that would be a big deal even if they hate insecurities it's not like you said you didn't really like him you probably like him that much it doesn't seem real I guess. Like this comic sums it up better than I do what I'm trying to say.
MMFB,3d29pa,staybuckyUW,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:10:31 2015 UTC,Yes! That comic sums me up too.  I think it's him thinking that I need constant validation and it can come off as clingy/insecure which he says he finds very unattractive :(.  I honestly don't even know why I said it.

MMFB,3d29pa,irrelevant_inquirer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"Yea in my opinion it sums up a lot of people, because a lot of people don't believe they deserve something that good.

MMFB,3d29pa,crazy_brain_lady,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:30:02 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with that honestly.  I mean you are at least somewhat human right? You are allowed to make mistakes. Just I dunno it bugs me in the sense that he thinks you aren't allowed to be insecure about things every now and then. Every one has fears and doubts about themselves and other things if you're in a relationship you should talk about them not hide them away for the sake of how it looks.

Five years ago, I went out on my first date with a girl I had just recently become interested in. We went out to dinner, and then she wound up coming along when I met up with some friends downtown. She drank waaaaayyyyyy too much. And she threw up on me. Like, literally, looking at me face to face, and then threw up all over the front of my shirt.  I was kinda pissed in the moment, like your boyfriend. But, chilled out about it overnight, and decided to keep talking to her. Our five year wedding anniversary will be in a few months."

MMFB,3d1lgy,Dogg_04,2,Sun Jul 12 19:49:28 2015 UTC,"Please, if you ever think you are approaching the breaking point reach out to someone immediately.  We all need help sometimes and the people who care about you need you to ask for help when you feel that down. I am glad to hear you are in therapy. That professional should be able to help point you in the right direction. Know that you are not the only one out there who feels the way you do. It's tough to work a job you hate. It takes inner strength, but take comfort in knowing that you won't have to be at this job forever, even if you have to be there for now. While you are there try to find something about it to take pride in or appreciate, even if it's just that fact that you are employed and getting some cash. I don't know what your ""life long dreams"" are but rest assured that every night is a new one and we can always dream a new dream. These plans may not have worked out and things might be difficult and frustrating now, but with patience, time, and determination,  you may find a new opportunity or goal  may present itself. That old saying about when one door closes exists for a reason. Sometimes we think one thing is the only thing we'd be happy with, then as life steers us in a new direction, once we get over our frustration we realize this new path may work out just as well, if not better. Give it time. Keep up your therapy, and don't be afraid to lean on your loved ones. Know that people out there in internetland are rooting for you. Good luck. I wish you all the best friend."

The truth is, we have no idea what happens after we die.  What was it like before you were born?  Death constitutes non-experience.

MMFB,3czkvt,skankinbankin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:03:55 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I went through/am going through something kind of similar.  I was 21 years old (now am 25) and didn't have a care in the world. I was living a pretty bohemian life style, all my friends were artists and musicians, we all participated in things communally, etc. It was kind of a dream.  During that time, I smoked copious amounts of pot. Stoned all day every day. One day, I was smoking with my friend and all of a sudden I had a hard time breathing, my heart started racing and I felt like I was going to die. I was terrified. It was my first panic attack.  The next day, I shrugged it off and went to smoke with my girlfriend and my best friend and BAM, had another one. This time I was truly afraid and I ended up going to the ER. Doctors told me that everything was fine and that I just had an anxiety attack.  And every time I smoked weed, it would happen. So, I stopped smoking. Then I started getting panic attacks sober.  It became this obsession with death and dying. I was never afraid of it before, never thought about it really. But the fear of death and dying kept slowly building. And for me, it's probably the worst its ever been now.  I have panic attacks when I'm alone because I fear having a heart attack or something and no one will be around to help.  I have attacks taking public transportation because I fear help won't get to me in time or that no one around me will care.  Though, I've since been diagnosed with Panic Disorder and a rather tricky form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder called Pure-O OCD, which essentially means that I have intrusive thoughts, but don't have the physical compulsions (e.g. handwashing, etc).  Sorry for the wall of text, maybe I needed to talk about it too. But, though the origins of your fear are probably completely different than mine, I'd suggest seeing a therapist and talking about it.   I didn't seek treatment until it got pretty bad and was having panic attacks at my job that resulted in me being let go.  But one thing I tell myself that does help when I'm freaking out about death is ""Yeah, you could die right now. But that's okay, because you ARE going to die at some point. It's probably going to be unpleasant, and it is going to happen. So don't let it stop you from enjoy the time that you have."""
MMFB,3czkvt,flufflebuffle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:14:59 2015 UTC,I think either heaven or nothingness will follow death. And in nothingness you would have no cares in the world and would be resting and at peace but not exactly...if you know what I mean. So both are good

One of my friends just recently ( see last week) died from a stroke.  He was the same age as me (31).  After I got the news of his passing I started having thoughts like you did.  The thing that keeps me grounded is what everyone else in the comments have said, one day I will die, there is nothing that can stop it from happening so enjoy every day to the fullest."

MMFB,3cy59t,averagebunnies,3,Sat Jul 11 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"I don't have much helpful advice, but what I do have could be an absolute gold mine because I am/was in the exact same position as you are right now.  Last year, for my own 18th birthday, I decided to have a party.  I had never been the most social person at school, but I hadn't been the meanest either.  I had a very small group of friends, and a very large group of acquaintances.  For my party, I wanted to finally come out of my shell and actually become friendlier with the people I went to school with, some of which I had known for 13 years.  I set up a Facebook event, and invited everyone from my year/grade/whatever you want to call it.  In total it came to around 100+ people invited.  Over the next two weeks leading up to my party, only 20 people accepted the invitations, so I made a party for 20 people.  I got a bunch of alcohol, cleared and tidied my garage, put an outdoor table and a bunch of chairs in it, and bought some extra chairs.  I even got a barbecue set up and brought out my music system.  Wanna know how many people showed up?  Only 4.  This was made even more of a stab in the heart as not even a month before had my girlfriend of over a year dumped me.  I was alone, and wanted more friends, but no one cared, so I got blind drunk and had the night of my life with the people who did show up.  Sure I broke down and cried myself to sleep at 3 in the morning, but that's what I'm trying to say to you now.  No one cares if you're alone.  It's up to you decide what happens with that.  If you're happy with what you've got right now, then that's great, be happy with it and cherish it for all it's worth.  If you're not happy then go out and change it.

MMFB,3cy59t,TheSilverwolfKnight,3,Sun Jul 12 06:46:06 2015 UTC,"The difference is, you're not in high school anymore.  Most friends you make in school are what I like to call Friends By Proximity.  They're people who you spend a lot of time around, so you end up building a rapport, but won't put forth the effort to keep contact with when you go your separate ways.  When you leave school, you find that a lot of your ""friends"" were this sort of relationship, so you end up feeling quite alone when you realize you don't have those connections anymore.  Now, you have to actively seek out connections with other people, instead of letting them just fall into your lap due to proximity.  The best things you can do are to strike up conversations with co-workers, get involved with hobbies that let you interact with other people, or just look toward starting college (as that will give you plenty of opportunities to make new friends)."
MMFB,3cy59t,Greyfeld,3,Sun Jul 12 15:07:35 2015 UTC,"It's not easy to meet new people especially if you are shy. The only way to meet people is to put yourself out there. Check online for free local activities.  Sometimes cities offer things like yoga in the park or pet owner meet ups free of charge. There are also clubs that may be free or inexpensive.  I've never used it but some people try websites like meetup.com or even reddit to find like minded peers to meet up with. (Just be sure to be careful and stay safe when meeting up with people from the internet. Make sure it's a public place and maybe bring someone else with you too. ) Or sometimes people are able to make friends by visiting the same places on a regular basis. For example, if you buy coffee everyday, strike up a conversation with the barista. Try to chit chat with them regularly and find some common ground.  Or if you have a dog check out the local dog park and talk to the other dog owners. It can be intimidating, but the only way to make friends is to meet new people and put yourself out there. I hope you have a good birthday and I wish you all the best. Goodluck friend. =)"

I won't go into a ""I'm older and you're still young"" diatribe but I'm closing in on the end of my 30s and there's no way to quickly explain just how night-and-day life is now compared to when you're 18-20. There's, literally, a doubling of your life time between you and I and in some ways, it'll pass immediately but in so many other ways, your thoughts, outlooks, goals, friends, routines etc will all be completely different and this moment you're experiencing will literally be a lifetime ago    Looking back, I. Could. Not. Imagine. doing something at 18 or 19 that would still demand top priority today. Good Lord. You'll always have good parts to look back on and I'm sure it'll take some time for those to become comfortable memories, but you have so much of an awesome life ahead of you with absolutely nothing holding you back. And that is truly something priceless."

When I was 18 the only life-long decision I made was to get military experience. That turned out be a 5 year task, which only gave me a lifetime of memories. Beyond that... it's impossible to see the situation you're in from the other side when you've never been there, so you have to either rely on other people's word or just wait and find out yourself, but TRUST EVERYBODY HERE! You are not fully matured. Nobody is a full grown adult at the age of 18. You've only successfully managed to stop shitting yourself and get out of grade school. Jobs, housing, paying bills, interviewing, getting an education, fucking up, starting over, failing, being old, injured WHATEVER is all part of life that makes us who we are and most of it does NOT HAPPEN when you are barely out of the parents home (or still there).  I can't even count the number of people I know that got married between the ages of 18-25 but I can count the number that are still married (that I know personally) and it's 1. You grow, you change, your priorities change, shit happens and life goes on.   You really like her now, but chances are you'll both mature differently in your young-adult years and you won't even be compatible in just a few years. Just be glad you're not stuck with a kid in the middle of that inevitably ugly situation. She fucked her life up, not yours. Just be glad you got away scott free.  The sadness will wear off but the best thing you can do about that is just cut her out of your life permanently. Continuing to contact her is only going to fuck with your heart and mind and drag this out. Just move on. You'll look back and be glad guaranteed."

I went to the /r/fitness subreddit and I shit you not it changed my life.   Since September I've lived a healthier life and I seriously prevented myself from becoming a bitter and spiteful person by exercising.  What I want to tell you is that if you feel like you aren't good enough, be honest with yourself and change your lifestyle. Don't tell Facebook or Twitter just DO it. Drag your boyfriend along with you to the gym for motivation or go kick fucking ass and prove everyone wrong.   You are a beautiful soul that deserves to live a life filled with peace and comfort.

A phone call maybe, or even just a beer and a chat always helps.  See if you can pick up any interests or hobbies that you've been putting off and find companionship in those new friends.  Be honest with yourself and don't do the things you don't want to do, and do the things you really want to. It's time to treat yourself to something good.  Also remember that just because the marriage is over doesn't mean you are who you were before it all began. You are different now, you are the sum of your past self plus all the parts of the marriage. Treat what you learned from being a married man as strengths / insights, and carry them forward."

It's been my hope to get away from my dad and family for a long time, but given that I can't pay for college by myself (and they won't allow me to live by myself) I'll probably be stuck with them for a while.

It must be really hard to feel like everything is falling apart and cry all the time.  You should definitely make sure you're eating enough. Try to do something during the day even if it's putting on clothes that aren't pajamas, or cleaning the house or part of the house.   Going off to college can be a really stressful time.

I'm taking a reduced credit load next year, and I'm also rooming with a bunch of my friends, so I'm going to use them as motivators and a support system.   The thing that has helped me the most, is human interaction. Isolation and avoidance of your mental illness will only ever make it worse. Embrace it, tell everyone you know about it. Tell them how hard it is to get out of bed in the morning. Tell them how anxious you get when nothing is even happening to you. Tell them that you are worried beyond belief about college and moving out.   If you don't feel comfortable talking to someone about the negative things in your life (you should with atleast one person probably your therapist) then just do things with them. Anything, talk about their day, play video games with them, take a walk in the park, go get coffee, watch a movie together, go minigolfing or something. Just interact with other humans as much as you possibly can.  I hope you feel better soon.  If you think talking to a random internet stranger would do you good, then I'd be happy to listen."

MMFB,3cj973,throwawayacc549,91,Wed Jul 8 10:01:19 2015 UTC,"Hey dude, you took way too much, and you did it by yourself. LSD is no joke, and not something to be taken lightly. Your parents will forgive you, trust me they're just glad that you're okay and hope that you've learned a lesson (and I'm sure you did). In a couple years (like when you're 30) it will be a funny, albeit, super embarrassing story.   This might not make you feel better, though it will probably make you laugh, but I have kind of a similar story about mushrooms. I've talked about it couple times on Reddit.   About 2 year ago (almost exactly I think) I was waiting for my ex-girlfriend to get off of work, and her apartment was right down the street from a shopping center with a movie theater in it. I decided, fuck it, why not, I'll take some mushrooms (alone) and go see a movie. Already the stupidest idea ever, but I was determined to trip out and see The Hobbit solely because I thought being on psychedelics in a public place watching a life-size dragon eat midgets would be awesome. First big mistake.  So I ate a few caps, worked on some music until they started to kick in and went on a walk to the theater. Already I knew it was a bad idea, but seeing as I've never had a good trip and was actually enjoying this one I went with it. I somehow bought a ticket without falling over, but I could barely understand what the usher was saying about how I couldn't bring my Fanta in with me, so I just handed it to him, walked out and went through the other door like a retard to avoid him, all the while he was just looking at me wondering what I was doing while holding my capless orange soda.   So I made my way to my theater, but in reality I just walked into the first theater I saw, and it was the wrong one and didn't even realize it until the movie had actually started. The second it started, I saw the Hobbits and Dwarves standing in a line together, but something was a little off. I didn't remember them being black.  What did I end up tripping balls through? 12 Years A fucking Slave. Seriously, the whole thing. They do counts at the theater so every now and then someone will walk in with an orange cone that looks like a light saber, and it seemed like every time I tried to get up, like when one of the characters was getting whipped so badly the skin was falling off of her back, they would come in and I would be forced to sit back down and endure it because I totally thought they knew and were going to call the cops. The standard believable paranoia.  It was...the worst 2 hours of my life, no question. All I kept thinking was now I know how people on top of the world trade center felt. I related a lot to A Clockwork Orange, because I felt like I was actually forced to sit there or go to jail for the rest of my life. There were times I considered just bolting, but by then the drug was taking me on a rollercoaster, and I wasn't able to stand anymore. There was only a few other people in the theater with me, and I don't think I made too much of an ass of myself by some miracle. I do remember going ""ooooohhh fuuuuuckkkkkkk"" really loudly at one point, but I definitely had something to talk about with my shrink afterwards.   My ex picked me up once it ended, and I had that 10,000 yard stare that you see in war photos, and she laughed...and laughed, and laughed some more and then bought me the trippiest banana split I had ever seen and laughed some more.  Don't beat yourself up. Most people at least have one horrible drug experience, I've had several. Don't be like me.  Good luck dude, you'll be alright."

Next time you experiment with a drug you need friends with you, friends you trust without a doubt. They will watch you and make sure you don't do anything like this again.  Of all the things that could have happened while on a drug like that, you got off really easy. Take the experience and turn it into a lesson. Whether you decide to never try the drug again or to try the drug under safer conditions, either way is fine. And you'll be fine."
MMFB,3cj973,lilappleblossom,5,Wed Jul 8 14:40:55 2015 UTC,"Ok so lets turn this into a thread about bad drug experiences. So a friend and I scored a decent amount of LSD one fine day because a musical artist that we both liked was coming to town so we decided to take it and go see the gig. Before the gig we both drop and wait for it to kick in. While standing outside the venue we both agree that we're both unable to enter and decide to instead go for a walk along the beach. After an hour or so my friend decides that clothing is optional and starts walking around naked and generally talking to himself. This freaks me out as i'm high as a kite as well and all i can think is that someone is going to call the cops and he's getting shot. I try calling random friends to come help but as it's like 3am nobody answers. out of desperation I end up calling his parents and they come pick us up. Fast forward a few hours and he's strapped to a bed, doctors are telling his parents that he might have had a psychotic break and could be like this forever and they are asking me how i could of let him do this all while high myself. Few hours later friend snaps out of it, realizes he's in hospital and gets released. Parents are pissed at us both but happy he's ok...  This is when i realize that I still have over 3/4 the original LSD purchase still in my pocket. I get home put it in the freezer and spend the next few weeks thinking about what i'm going to do with it. Having tried LSD multiple times 'with success' i decide to hang on to it.   It just so happens to be the end of the year and a few weeks later my friend and I are at a NYE house party. I pull out the LSD and take a small amount. My friend sees me and laughing asks for some. Remembering his parents and everything we went thru i come up with a better solution. I take all of it myself. Not a good move. Few hours go by and I'm in the midst of a serious trip. Total visual blackout.. unable to focus on anything basically just seeing color everywhere no real shape or form to anything. I start thinking things like I was a drop of paint in a paint can and everything/body around me was different drops and different colors and that when someone touches you they are really painting part of themselves onto your body and taking some of your 'paint' away, plus lots of other interesting perspectives of friendship/love/death. Few hours later of basically lying on the ground talking to myself, I believe that I have actually overdosed and died.  I accept my death and after some discussion with myself decide that i deserve to move onto a happy afterlife. I'm now in 'heaven'. Walking on clouds, wonderful goodness everywhere etc. The thing about heaven is that you don't need clothing. Took that off. I found a place in heaven that was pure light. I stand in it and transport myself all around the universe. (picture me standing in the middle of the dance floor naked with 40-50 people who where also at this party wondering WTF i'm doing). After seeing the universe i decide to explore heaven some more,  I spend the next few hours walking around this MASSIVE place (a backyard on a city block). While exploring this place i keep running into people who I know, confused as to why they are also in 'heaven'! i think that they must be here because the place is timeless and they died later and are just visiting my heaven.. we're all here together.. generally I was very happy.. unsure why so many other people who i don't know are here but heaven is a full place..   Few more hours go by and i realize that i'm naked amongst 30-40 people of which i only know maybe 5 and am indeed not dead.. I've no idea where my clothes are and I'm still too high to leave and basically retreat to an area to be alone and sober up before getting away..   I go home smoke some weed and watch the clouds for the rest of the day... over the next few months I stop seeing anybody that I used to hang out with mainly from embarrassment.. a year goes by and i catch up with the group again. Everybody thought it was a great story and laughed with me about it.. i still doubt anybody who didn't know me thought it was funny, but oh well... I'm still embarrassed to this day.. (this was like 10 years ago).. but in my defense it was really good acid.."

MMFB,3ceezd,Mollaby,8,Tue Jul 7 07:55:13 2015 UTC,"I apologize, I wrote a bit of a novel because your situation feels very familiar to me.  I come from a poor farming family.  I did well in school and got into an Ivy League college.  I was the only person in my language class who didn't travel to Russia over the summer, because I felt obligated to go home and work on the farm.   Then I dropped out in my second year due to stress, depression from losing my father, anxiety, and not really knowing what I wanted to do and using $40k a year to do it, etc. I moved in with my boyfriend, got pregnant, got married, got an apartment.  It hurt to see all my former classmates graduating when I should have been.  It hurt to see them traveling and going to grad school and getting important jobs and getting married at ""normal"" ages and having kids at ""normal"" ages.  It killed me that I didn't do things ""the right way.""  I was so ashamed of myself, for years.  But I'm 30 now and the more I see and the more people I meet, the more I realize there isn't one single ""proper"" way to do things, and going to college right after high school isn't a guarantee of success or happiness.  And these tough times we've been through?  Those are valuable experiences and they've made us stronger.  And all the friends and family I hid from and avoided for years because I thought they must have been so ashamed of what I did - they missed me and loved me, all along.    I'm still married to the same man and we have three great kids now and I have good work experience and  I am not less of a person because I don't have a degree.  Now I know what I want, and what I don't want, and what is of practical use in the real world, when I go on to pursue a proper career.  I can see my path so much more clearly now than I could when I was 18.  So, do things get better?  Yes.  But it's not by magic, it has to come from within.  Accept the things you can't change.  Don't beat yourself up over your past or your mistakes.  Don't dwell on the things you don't have, and appreciate the things that you do have. Make goals, and put down your old baggage so you can chase them. ""The best years of your life"" is just an empty platitude, not a guarantee about your early 20s."
MMFB,3ceezd,SashkaBeth,3,Tue Jul 7 15:07:01 2015 UTC,"I'm on this sub because I'm feeling shitty but your post puts things in perspective.  It sounds trite, but I think there is something to be said for the saying, ""The hotter the fire, the harder the steel"".  People might be out in the wilderness contemplating which festival to go to with their disposable income, but believe me when I say you're getting the better end of the deal.  Life is hard, and it will only get harder.  One day one of your fb friends won't get the color placemat they want and their life will go off the rails.  More realistically, they might have to deal with getting fired or divorce, and they won't know what to do.  You are being hardened right now, and becoming better prepared for life's obstacles.  I know it doesn't seem easy now, or fair, but take heart in the fact that you will be better prepared when things get hard (they will).  With that idea in your head, remember that you are a good and capable person (both evident from your story), and that it is very hard to keep people like that out of the game.  In response to your question, ""does it really get better?"", the answer (which is true despite apparent triteness) is that it gets better if you make it better.  You've started with your ""academic salvage"".  Make that your new beginning.  Take more courses and relentlessly chase what motivates you.  Really think about what your next step should be and make an unparalleled effort to make that reality.  One of the most important moments of my life was when I was leaving the high school classroom of my favorite teacher for the last time and he said, ""Hey ****, make something of yourself"".  That's the best advice I ever received.  You should follow it too."

Unfortunately, tragedy is inevitable in the long run, no?  The universe has taken a shit on your life at a really inopportune moment.  If you sit around comparing your life to the lives of others, that universal shit will never get cleaned off, it'll just dry and stick (maybe even pile up).  Social media, of any kind, for someone in your situation acts like a toxin that erodes the mind, it can break you over enough time.  Doing battle with the lives of the privileged is pointless, no one gets to choose what cards they'll have in their deck when they're born.  And to me, life getting ""better"" is mostly dependent on how well you can adapt to the changes that life throws at you, using the tools at your disposal.  What about you will help you through this? What can cause harm? Be honest and take stock.  Just from your post I can tell you're an intelligent, creative, incredibly hard working individual, but you're letting the highlight reels from other peoples lives muck up your ability to utilize those traits.

However you can't let it get you down, you need to focus all the energy, and use it to first have a heart-to-heart with your parents, trust me it going to be hard, but it's going to be worth it. These are people who've taken care of you, and provided you with an excellent home, the least they deserve is some honesty. They won't act with you in any other way than be disappointed, furthermore talking to them you'll realize that some of the greatest successes in the family have secretly gone through your situation. One the major pitfalls of education these days, is the belief that everything goes smoothly, and this cannot be further from the truth.   Next, I'm from Canada, so I might not understand but when is the next admissions semester, for us it's usually in the January term. How do you apply to Colleges there? In Canada, we have a service that helps you send applications to all the universities you want within our province, so it shouldn't be that difficult. Start looking at such service right now, and contacting other universities.   Take advantage of your High School teachers, these folks are the most sympathetic, and careful people you'll meet in life, and judging by your grades, they probably respect you quite a bit, take some time off, and get in contact with them, either through email, skype, or on the phone, make sure to have an agenda when talking to them, sometimes you'll make the call and blank out. Which leads  me to another point, the situation is terrible, as far as you believe right now, but it's a lot better, you haven't actually gotten to the university, and trust me when I saw this, this situation in University is a lot harder to get out of that what you're in right now, but keep calm, and talk to someone about it, either a girlfriend, your parents, aunts, uncles (which I know is hard considering your family dynamic), but give preference to your parents. Us stranger on here, might try our best but you won't find the spiritual solstice that you'll find from your parents.   Getting back to my earlier point, you realize that you were in burn out mode, just be glad that this happened now, and now when you went back to school in September, but also take some time out now, of course research, but take time to be with friends, real friends, not those idiots you might have just talked to about marks, they're not mature enough to help you right now. Ask them if they've ever heard of someone in your scenario, chance are they have, now whether they tell you is something else.      Have some faith in the letter, but be realistic, and map out other options, Community Colleges are a great ""transitional"" stage, and I've heard you can do 2 years at some places, and then transfer to University, maybe that's an option, again when the next semester starts, if they are indeed full. Also take some time for self reflection, and I'm not trying to sound patronizing here, but when I went through my ""fuck-up"", I realized I needed to be realistic about how independent I was at this stage, I was miserable at my first university, I had no friends, and living alone for me was having a huge emotional toll, maybe you though about this, and the fear perpetuated into your work, again, something you'll have to figure out. You've gone through a hurdle, and that doesn't mean your a screw-up, but that you're an adult, adult life is full of this bull-shit, and knowing how to move forward is the real challenge!   Finally I can't stress this enough, but under NO circumstances can you take any of what, you think, your parents say, or your friends say to heart. Your grades are excellent, and they must have been to have such a hardworking personality, but all of that means nothing if you take it to heart, and ruin your ""beautiful"" mind with negativity! Keep up with school work, if your going into engineering or the science, work on MIT OCW, and learn whatever you think will aid you in your endeavors, the worst possible thing you could do is feel sorry for yourself, and become depressed, believe me, that is not a road you want to go through. Finally it's okay, and keep on telling yourself that, this isn't the end of the world, and you're easily better than a vast majority of people, and you'll get out of it.   5 years ago I got turned down from university after one semester. Now I'm gearing to go to Grad School at one of the best universities in Canada, if nothing I said is of help, take my story, to gain some kind of calm, and composure. I know everything will be fine for you, and I'm not just saying that, I've lived it. Believe in yourself, and gain even more knowledge, the only thing you got snagged on is a piece of paper, and you'll get it soon enough, but your mind is still the same, and you can learn even more. Sometime we humans need to take a break, and people think that those who are academically focused don't have any reason to, in fact they have the most reason to! Enjoy the little free time you have before the burdens of adulthood come rushing through!"
MMFB,3cdb3z,monkeyMan1992,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:57:27 2015 UTC,"Hi,  If your high school has a college counselor or you had a teacher who helped you with your applications, contact them ASAP.  Your solid APs and your extra curricular should help you. You can also phrase this as a learning experience (""While I pushed myself during my final semester, I eventually became overwhelmed. I have learned from this experience about how to prioritize my academics and what warning signs to avoid in the future, lessons I will use at State U to keep a rigorous but healthy workload."").   You could also ask to defer for a semester or a year and reapply, taking community college classes or finding an internship or experience in your planned field of study.  PLENTY of people do not have completely linear academic tracks. Its okay. Use the time to learn and grow and find another plan. In five years, you may view the setback (if the appeal doesn't go through) as a blessing. I got put on a year's leave in the middle of my senior year of college. While I am sure I would have been okay with my life had I graduated on time, I'm also thrilled with my life now. At the time, I would have thought that was impossible.  Be prepared to tell your parents with multiple contingency plans to show you aren't letting this get you stuck.  Good luck!"
MMFB,3cdb3z,elkanor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"this! it's just a setback   maybe a year off is what  you need to recharge, work and see how the world is"
MMFB,3cdb3z,orphan26,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:27:25 2015 UTC,"In my experience, appeals tend to work pretty well as long as you're open and honest about it.  Also, you need to make someone in the admissions office care about you.  They deal with so many hundreds of students that they've never met (because they're still in high school) that the incoming class just starts to feel like a faceless stack of applications to them.  If possible, go talk to someone in person.  Or video conference, phone call, or email, in that order of helpfulness.    Make them see you as a real person who ran into trouble but who is still committed to working hard and doing well in school.  I know the thought of facing them is probably terrifying.  But honestly, as long as you strike them as an honest person who's committed to success, they'll work with you.  Ask if there's anything you can do, such as taking a summer class or entering on academic probation & having a semester to prove yourself.  Even if the answer is no, they'll take the fact that you asked the question as a sign that you're willing to work hard to make this work out.    Admissions people aren't monsters.  They're normal people just like you & me.  They work in admissions because they want to help students.  I know it's hard, but just write the letter and turn it in.  It doesn't have to be perfect, just honest & sincere.  Worst case scenario, you may have to wait a year.  Find something to do in that year.  Work for a non-profit.  Volunteer.  Tutor adorable children at an elementary school.  You basically want to say, ""Hey, I know my senior grades made me look like a slacker with no motivation to do anything in life.  But look, I didn't spend the past year stoned on my couch eating Cheetos!  I worked hard to make the world a better place!  I'm motivated, and not allergic to hard work!""  That's how you get back in."

It's taken me a long time to be able to really articulate the feeling, but I think I have figured out out.   I feel life I have mourned the loss of them,  yet they aren't dead.  I talk to them,  mostly online,  but I never want to see them again.  It will just be too hard.  My brother has come out to visit a few times and we are close,  but my parents might as well have died.  It's such an odd feeling,  knowing they're still here,  aging and I have no idea how I'll react when they do die.    I'm sorry you're going through this.  I agree with the other guy,  just call him and talk to him.  It's better than nothing and if you can come see him,  even better.  But don't beat yourself up if you can't do it. He is the one that left. He chose whatever live he has built over a life that you're a regular part of.  I know exactly how much that hurts."

I feel guilty about it, too, but I have to take care of my mental health too, and nobody's gonna take ""mental health day"" as a good reason to not come to work on short notice. Some days I just need to be a pitiful lump on the couch or bed. It's like hitting the reset button and you feel so much better the next time you go in to work. There's just something about getting to stay home on a day you were supposed to work that's so much better than a scheduled day off, haha. It might not be the best thing you can do, but I promise you pretty much every minimum wage worker has done it at least once. For me, I wake up some days and I just KNOW I can't make it through the day and I immediately pick up the phone and tell them I'm nauseous or have a migraine. Honestly as long as you don't do it often, nobody is going to think twice about it. At my current job, there are people who call in nearly once a week and are still some of the more reliable workers."

It's about pulling through these days and just doing what needs to be done, then, at the end of that day, all stress is gone, you know you have done what you can, and this will resolve your work anxiety, NOT all anxiety, but I know work can be a particularly bad one, I work in a surface mine, and it's not very fun. Im only 21 and fairly new to the work force, school to the realworld is not an easy transition. My friend did that too and would call in sick all the time, he didnt get fires but he quit, but after that he cant get any jobs now because of his work review( hes 22)If I can do this you can do your part for work, no matter how small, because exactly like you said you do need money and you shouldnt get fired off of someone elses slacking advice."

This disappointing time in your life will pass, and it bears no impact on the good times that may be waiting for you down the line, likely sooner than you think. Who knows?

You're not going to be working at it forever. No one deserves to be miserable, specially when you've done nothing but work hard.

Doubly so now most of the unis have finished for summer. My sister did offer the other weekend that maybe I could tag along with her friends some time, so I guess there's that? I'm just scared I'll look like a total loser there, the weirdo hanging out with her little sister's friends. She's only two years younger, and they're all 22/23 as far as I know so it's not totally creepy, but I don't know.  Sorry. I know I sound like I'm making excuses, I just wanted to explain. I have a lot of MH issues, and many of my friends deserted me in a really bad spell back in uni. I was kind of... out of control. I tried to explain afterwards, said sorry, but they, um, didn't understand so much.

If that's the case, there's probably no harm in casually mentioning it to her that you two would probably make a great couple, if only the timing had worked out. If she is as into you as you hope, she would agree.    But perhaps she doesn't think that way. In which case, there's no use pining over a girl who was never going to say yes to you anyway.

But no 17 year old should be cutting off contact with a supportive family because of  boy. Take her on a family trip maybe? No phones.

The things is, we've been together over 3 years, we're almost 21 and 23, and we plan on getting married. He also does a lot for me and my family. He's ran to the grocery store for us and refused to take money for it on more than one occasion. He's helped with intense spring cleaning. He's an absolute angel.

MMFB,3bxl62,olympicmew,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:13:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could explain it to your mom like this  You know how when you were kids, you could cross the road before your younger sister? That's cause you knew what to look for and when it was safe because you were older and more experienced.  When your sister reached the same age, she was allowed to cross the road too right? But only if it was a safe, residential road. Certainly your mother wouldn't want your sister, or even you, to try and cross a busy street.  Your boyfriend is a school zone. Hers is a 4 lane highway leading to nowhere."
MMFB,3bxl62,olympicmew,2,Fri Jul 3 04:20:46 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good way of wording it! Although I'm a bit worried she'll point out we're still not allowed to walk anywhere without a friend with us. I understand what you're saying, but she's the type that would point something stupid out like that.   I just told her that I loved having a ""cool mom"" growing up, but there were things I did that I shouldn't have done. I told her flat out that I gave my first blowjob before I had my first kiss and that was not okay. I told her I was happy I learned the lessons I did, but there were far better ways to learn them. I told her that just because she made mistakes with me, doesn't mean she has to let me sister do the same things. She doesn't have to be ""fair"". I told her that at 17 I was happy she let my boyfriend sleepover, but it was far too early in the relationship and age wise to share such an intimate thing with someone. I lucked out because he ended up being ""the one"", but what if he wasn't? I pointed out that I didn't even mean the sex, because sleeping next to someone, leaving yourself so vulnerable, is far more intimate than just having sex with them. She seemed to understand what I was saying but, like I said, she's a pushover and eventually gave in to my sister.   Although me and my other sister have both caught her, my mom refuses to believe my sister is having sex with this guy. (Who's flat out said he wants to get her pregnant.) I don't know if my mom is stupid or in denial, but either way it sucks."
MMFB,3bxl62,olympicmew,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:38:55 2015 UTC,"If your sister continues to have a relationship with him and it escalates and you can't stop it, the best you can do for her is to make sure she knows you still love her. that way if she does ever need somewhere to run when she realizes what's going on she knows of a safe place."
MMFB,3bxl62,olympicmew,2,Fri Jul 3 13:55:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I think I'll probably just write ""I love you!"" really big on a piece of paper and slip it under her door. This way even if she throws it right in the trash she'll still read it. You kind of can't avoid seeing/reading big letters that are right in front of your eyes. I'll think about writing a longer letter, but I really think she'll throw it away."
MMFB,3bxl62,olympicmew,2,Fri Jul 3 14:48:38 2015 UTC,"*internet hugs*  I might cry a little. It's not like I've been in a similar situation, it's just that tonight my big sister called me to her room and said on the verge of tears ""do you know that I love you?"" and hugged me because she thought she was neglecting me lately. I don't think so, but we don't talk a lot either so these moments are... priceless.  Back to you, I've felt powerless countless times when some SO would take a friend away from me, and when you know he's sort of abusive it's even more excruciating. Having that happen to your sister must be even worse.  It's kind of shitty to think about it like that, but she has to live this shitty situation through her skin to realize in what a mess she's in. She will realize it and come back, sooner or later, and she will do on her own. What she'll need then will be supportive people. You will be there for her, but it's important for her friends to be there too. I really hope she has loyal friends that care about her and won't ditch her right away just because she won't spend time with them, because that's what she'll need the most when this shit will be over. I'm pretty positive it will. Three-four months of dating isn't very much and she's just seventeen. Watch her from afar, but don't lose sight of her. She will need you, one way or the other... if things should get worse.  I wish you all the best for this. I'm sorry I can't really help you much... if you need somebody to vent with you can send me a PM though. They say I'm a good listener."
MMFB,3bxl62,AzaleaDreams,2,Fri Jul 3 00:26:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks! internet hugs   That's really sweet of your sister. As a big sister I can vouch for how much we love our little sisters.   They've been dating over a year, sorry I didn't make that clear! She doesn't have friends anymore. He made her tell them all to go fuck off. Her best friend is actually a family friend and I still hang out with her. She's like a little sister to me too. She'll take her back in a heart beat. I think he other friends are gone forever though.   I really think she has every intention to run off and marry this guy as soon as she turns 18. (She says so.)  I don't know if she'll come back. I'm scared he'll kill her if she tries.   I know some lessons you need to learn the hard way. But this guy is insane and I don't know if it's safe to learn this lesson the hard way."

Here is a tangent, I was thinking about this recently after watching a V-Sauce video The Science of Awkwardness, I hope you watch at least until the part in which he talks about Protagonists Disease (it's not a disease more so a view of reality but i digress) which brings up the point that we often think we are constantly being judged and that our awkward moments or presentation matters to those who don't know us, when in reality the opposite is true. In reality, that person on the street who awkwardly glanced at you isn't thinking of you tomorrow, or an hour or even a few minutes from then, I know how simplistic I make it sound but it's an interesting way to view things and I think looking at life from different angles can help improve ones self immensely.

MMFB,3byxha,lnickelly,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's easy to find something about oneself to be insecure about.  It's so easy to want everything about oneself to be perfect.  Think of it this way, you are probably more perfect in ways others are imperfect and vice versa.  There are plenty of supermodels with awful personalities who'd be unbearable longterm. Nobody can be all things to all people at all times.  There could never be such a thing as ""the perfect boyfriend"" or ""the perfect girlfriend"" because someone out there would find something to dislike about them.  I don't know you at all, but I can tell from your desire to get out there that you're fun-loving.  I can tell from your guilt about not accepting your body, that you're genuine and honest.  There's more to being sexy than being 20 lbs lighter.  Making other people feel your glow when you walk into a room is a big part of being sexy.  For me, personally, sexy would be defined as someone who can make me feel like there's nobody else in the room but the two of us.  It doesn't take the world's tiniest waist to accomplish that.  But your worries will hold you back if you let them shake your nerve.  Courage isn't just for the battlefield."

It sucks a lot that your dad has other priorities and it may make you feel like he's causing you to be stuck. It just means that he isn't (and may never be) a solution, so you'll have to find a new one. His actions (or lack thereof) doesn't mean you're not allowed to get your GED. He isn't holding you back, because he's literally doing nothing at all. It will suck a little bit more, but you must figure out this solution for yourself.   Also, you've got the whole internet here to help you! People in your immediate life might be negative and less than helpful, but definite kudos for reaching out :) I have a family member very similar, and I've found that the less energy I spend on how I feel about the situation, the more energy I can devote to the things I need to get done.

I am assuming you are not the kind of person that asserts itself onto other people. More likely to follow then lead. Problem is if you take the initiative it will most likely be ridiculed. I know finding friends can be hard but, are there certain things you enjoy that you might be able to do on a weekly basis that will give you the chance and associate with others. Most likely if you find some people with common interests you will have something to talk about and wont be getting into the role of a push over too quickly. Because that is what I am afraid you are.   And no it was not your fault your parents divorced.   As to actuall pointers and action steps. When you beat somebody literally it is no fun at all if he just goes all limp. There is no fun in that. Now when people mock you or play jokes on you, do not be afraid to join in with them. Laugh about yourself with them. That will maybe give them the vibe that you can take it and not get all butthurt about it. They might stop because they dont get an reaction out of you anymore.

This implies you will leave when the summer is over. You may not be able to get your mother to stop drinking or your brother to stop picking on you, but you won't be living with them forever. Don't compare yourself to people, especially people on facebook. Remember that people only post the best of the best on facebook. Very few people want to publicize the fact that they hate their jobs or that they are unhappy and only had fun that one time on saturday that they actually went to a bar. Instead of worrying about how you compare to others, try to work on yourself. What can you do to better yourself this summer? Remember, just because you don't have a job yet doesn't mean you can't apply and get something part time that works around your classes. Even if that is not an option, find some other way to enhance yourself. Take up a new hobby. Drawing or writing for example is a cheap hobby and you can probably start those without buying too many supplies. Or maybe try getting in shape. Jogging and yoga are two forms of exercise that don't require many supplies. Find a youtube yoga video for beginners and get started for free in your own living room. Exercise has the added benefit of helping you cope with the anxiety, and if you find some good yoga videos with breathing exercises that would be extremely beneficial. If you feel you need an extra boost against the anxiety, look into natural remedies. Some people swear by things like valerian root or cava cava, a quick google search will tell you what you need to know.

MMFB,3boanv,valkyrguy,2,Tue Jun 30 20:35:28 2015 UTC,"I'm 28 and I just got out of a mildly similar situation. My grandparents pressured my siblings, my cousins and me to go to college and get a degree because ""you'll never make it in life without an education."" I went to college for 1 year and began taking the basic courses. I realized right away that I had no idea what I really wanted out of life and that college wasn't for me. I wanted no part of it and, like you, the pressure was overwhelming.  In a very out-of-character moment for me I decided to join the Army. I did that and ended up doing IT work in the Army for 5 years. I've always kinda liked computers and (and of course video games too) but 'computers' covers a lot and I really HATED what I did in the Army. The IT work was boring, monotonous and I couldn't have cared less about it.  Because of this, I never really did that great at my 'job' in the Army, although I excelled in other areas of my service. In fact, I found every opportunity possible to write scripts and code for my office to make daily work easier. See... I was doing network stuff and I hate computer networks, however, I love (love love love) writing code and programming. Instead of doing my job I'd find myself doing what I enjoyed doing and I was infinitely better at that.  I eventually got out of the army and got a contracting job doing the same boring stuff. I was making a very large sum of money (studies show that salary only affects your overall happiness until about $75k annually and after that it has no affect). I was making more than that, so had basically achieved 'total satisfaction' from a financial stand point.  What does all that BS have to do with you?  Well even though I was making plenty, I hated the work. Every week was slow and painful and I lived for the weekends. The weeks were long, the weekends were short and the vacations couldn't come fast enough. I was miserable.   Just 3 years ago I decided to leave that career and pursue my passion for software development. I quit my job, lived off of savings and went to school full-time cramming more classes in than were recommended. In short order I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and now I'm a professional software developer.   I have NEVER EVER been as happy as I am now and I easily make half of what I used to as an IT guy and I couldn't care less. They say ""do a job you love and you'll never work a day in your life."" That's a cliche statement, and nobody will ever really get it until you've done it. When I go to work, it's not like work. I feel like I'm at a club house just playing around on code all day solving logic puzzles until 10 hours have just magically disappeared from me.  I would advise you to follow your true interests. Money is trivial as long as you make enough to buy the necessities in life and spend/save responsibly the salary isn't that big of a deal. Job and life satisfaction is EVERYTHING.  Yes... it may suck for a few years, but I promise you, I just came out the other side of a dark 3 year period of unemployment, stress, hating my previous job, uncertainty about my future and it's glorious.  A few other pointers:  *Don't run from or avoid the inevitable. Your parents are GOING to figure out all this eventually, be proactive and make it happen early to get it out of the way now. Waiting for the inevitable will only serve to stress you out for longer and make the problem bigger when comes.  *There are harvard graduates who hate their job, and suck at it. You will obviously excel in a job you enjoy, because you will be more attentive, interested, and excited about the job. You'll go home, and research job related things in your own time making you even better at your job than the average guy who just does that job out of obligation. There are wildly successful people doing the weirdest and 'dumbest' jobs ever. If you truly love what you do, you can be one of the best in that field, and if you're the best in your field you can make plenty of money regardless of what field that is. Your region's best artist is probably doing quite fine. The best volunteer workers probably have their own foundation and are CEO's of them... you name it. If you love it, you can excel at it and you can be successful doing it.  *I didn't like college when I was 0-24. It was about then, for no apparent reason that I just suddenly started REALLY valuing education. Maybe it was a mental development thing, I don't know, but I suddenly hungered for higher education. I'm working on a masters in Software Engineering now. If you don't want to do college, find something that makes you happy and do that. The education should only exist to serve your interests. You should not exist to serve your degree."

She probably has similar problems as you, and she is doing the best she can. Now that you are an adult, you should realize that your mom is just another person who makes mistakes same as you and everyone else.  I can see from what you wrote that there is a lot in your life to feel good about and a lot about you to feel proud about. For example, you are taking a risk by going out to live in a big city, and that takes balls. That is something to feel proud about.  But you cannot see all these good things because your mind is filled with automatic negative thoughts.  Also, be grateful for what you have by thinking about all the things that you have and that you could just as easily not have. For example, you started a new job. You could just as easily not have a job.  You have been diagnosed with anxiety and you could have still been undiagnosed and untreated."

MMFB,3bl8c3,sochac,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:14:56 2015 UTC,"Is there any reasoning for why he is now suddenly going strict with the religion?  From an outsiders perspective, it seems as though he is changing for his religion which in turn over time is going to change his overall views/personality and cause a shift in your relationship dynamics, i.e. liberal boyfriend will be quite a bit of different person than ""strict religion"" boyfriend.  Best thing to do for now is take things slow and see how things go; don't jump to any conclusions one way or the other."
MMFB,3bl8c3,lioncock666,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:08:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice.  I don't know... I absolutely love the guy.  The impression I get is that he took a ""holiday"" from his religion practice.  I think because that is what he was raised with and believes in deep down, he may be feeling regret.  His parents were still convinced he was a virgin at 25, which surprises me.  He's lived in a number of countries and has had countless one night stands (which I don't hold against him, I don't agree but his past isn't my business).  He didn't bring up his religion until we were together for over three months (I knew he was Muslim, even though he didn't tell me).  I had assumed that he was much more liberal than he is wanting to be now.  I can't tell if it's what he truly believes in and wants, or if it's the fear of disappointing family (or a combination of the two).  I don't want him to change or compromise his beliefs for me, I want him to be true to himself even if that means we can't be together.  It makes me sad to think about, but I care about him enough to respect his decisions in life.  He's a wonderful person and the sweetest young man.  If we didn't have this obstacle, I wouldn't consider being with anyone else.  The present doesn't worry me as much as the future.  If we have kids and can't agree... I don't want to put my future kids (should they exist) or him or myself through that...  He comes home on his 26th birthday.  He's going to get his own place and we will take it slow... But if this is the religion he really wants... it won't work... unless major compromises happen.  I feel lost because to him, I'm good enough to live with, love, and plan a future with as I am now, but not good enough to marry unless we are the same faith.  shrug hopelessly"

Do you know if any material that would show it doesn't matter the type of Christianity?  I'm sorry for asking you this...   It would give me much more hope of I could maintain my beliefs.  Also, if you don't mind me asking, what were your reasons for changing beliefs?  I'm just curious.  If you don't wish to tell me, that's okay."
MMFB,3bl8c3,BiH_USA_Activist,2,Tue Jun 30 04:02:51 2015 UTC,"The idea that only Catholic and Orthodox Christians are the people of the book sounds like some opinion of some idiot Islamic scholar.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_the_Book  I have no material for you to read, but I suggest you call up a Muslim scholar and ask him for advice. Make sure you know what your fiancee's sect is before you call though.   I was born in a secular family. I had an alcoholic uncle who became ""born-again"" muslim and kicked his habit just as his liver was about to quit on him. He got me to believe when I was a kid. Later, in college, I learned about falsifiability principle and I realized that belief in God is not falsifiable. I decided to put my faith temporarily on hold, and over time I became agnostic and then atheist.   My wife is a catholic. I do not care about her faith, but my lack of faith used to really bother her. These religious differences can be tough later in marriage."

It was a low-key birthday for sure, but I was glad just to do a little something nice for myself.

The phrase seems to have originated in the writings of the medieval Persian Sufi poets, and is often attached to a fable of a great king who is humbled by the simple words. Some versions of the fable, beginning with that of Attar of Nishapur, add the detail that the phrase is inscribed on a ring, which has the ability to make the happy man sad and the sad man happy. The adage and associated fable were popular in the first half of the 19th century, appearing in a collection of tales by the English poet Edward Fitzgerald and being employed in a speech by Abraham Lincoln before he became president.

MMFB,3bhjn4,orphan26,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:09:58 2015 UTC,"sorry for the late reply - it seems to me you need some alone time. just be spontaneous and go to a nearby resort or park and stay in a hotel for a few days and pamper yourself.   then i would prioritize - future first. don't think about what people say to you - sit down and figure out how the things you did post high school made you a better person, or what did you learn that will prevent you from making mistakes. this is key, it's ok to worry about your future, but you have to have a handle on yourself first or else anything people will say will throw you off. people are very insecure and sometimes push it onto others (unintentionally most of the time).   2) getting out of the dead end job - this is where you put your skills to the test. always motivate and test yourself to be better. you will get out of it.  3) head over heels falling for someone - if this person isn't reciprocating then it's time to move on. you have to be strong about this. it builds self-respect and you value yourself.

You should definitely continue to pursue the hobbies and activities that you enjoy even if you must do them by yourself for now.  Those things obviously bring you joy and if you can do them solo, then by all means, make yourself happy.  As for the issue with meeting friends, that's a tough one to do without making some changes or concessions in your life.  You should try to find things that you can enjoy with other people that may not be things you would normally think of doing.  You may be surprised by some of the things you can have fun doing that you may have thought you wouldn't.  Secondly, you may have to look at what you can do to change the things in your life you don't like.  Can you get more education through a college, trade school, or apprenticeship?  Maybe work toward a career that will allow you to be more social and make more money? Or maybe just a new career doing something that makes you happy.  I have to admit that I'm not familiar with the economy or the culture of Venezuela so if I'm making assumptions that aren't accurate, I apologize.  I'm certainly not trying to be insensitive.  Btw, your English is far better than my Spanish :)"

MMFB,3bg8mg,Otis64,4,Sun Jun 28 23:29:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding. I'm planning to call her via Skype sometime this week, as she moved abroad recently and lives in a time zone eight hours ahead. But I don't think it was an accident, because you usually have click on someone's profile and select 'unfriend' from a drop down menu."
MMFB,3bg8mg,creepazoid321,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:32:33 2015 UTC,Facebook has a glitch that unfriends people. I saw on the FB help page that a few people complained about it.
MMFB,3bg8mg,walk_through_this,6,Mon Jun 29 09:42:29 2015 UTC,Send her an email and ask her what's up. It's only facebook - it's not worth getting upset over. A real friend will give you an explanation. This sounds more like a mistake than anything else.
MMFB,3bg8mg,BiH_USA_Activist,2,Mon Jun 29 00:35:14 2015 UTC,Could she have deleted her account? Some people delete their account so that they can study.
MMFB,3bg8mg,another30yovirgin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:43:00 2015 UTC,You should ask her about this.
MMFB,3bg8mg,NoahHaders,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:10:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with you - something like this can be devastating. problem with the internet is you go from 100% connected to nothing - zero. Def give your friend a call, see what's up. she could be going through a really hard time in her move and needs you to reach out. don't give up hope yet!"
MMFB,3bdmng,Worstchoices,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:41:44 2015 UTC,"The good thing is that you understand the reasons behind your unhappiness and know your real passion that would make you happy in long term.  How long are you ? Reading your post, I get a feeling you're probably not over 30. I don't mean this as a judgement, but rather would point out that many people go years without coming to the realization about why they're not happy and as years go by any life changes to correct your mistakes become harder , not easier. So , in that aspect, instead of pondering too much over the time gone by, consider carefully the time ahead of you and weigh the unhappiness against any effort to change your life .  You said, you're fearful about making another mistake. That's a valid thought.  Consider this : when you say there are no growth opportunities , are you implying that just at your current employer or in the field as whole. If it's specific employer that's the problem, think if you could use your current experience and get a better job in some time. If you see a possibility of this happening, would that make any difference in your decision about changing job to accounting yet again ?"
MMFB,3bdmng,jkln8p,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:01:55 2015 UTC,"You seem to be finding the motivation to change your situation. My wife is a CA and she has always found meaningful work, especially in the not-for-profit sector. You could likely get a lot closer to that 'helping' profession you're looking for with a CPA, only you'd be coming into positions of more influence where you would be able to make a much larger difference than starting at the bottom."
MMFB,3bdkl1,mmfbth,2,Sun Jun 28 05:15:12 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness! You are beating yourself up so hard! Why in the world are you comparing the two of you?   It sounds like you have some deep-seated insecurities that are coming out onto this guy, but probably really started a long time ago. Don't worry about him-- why do you not feel good enough about yourself, period? We derive our true sense of self from ourselves, not from the existence of others... and you seem to not like yourself very much. You describe yourself as ""dime a dozen"". That's definitely not true.  Society puts too much stock in school names and job names and salaries all the rest. Yes these are good schools and some of those people accomplished something, but does that mean everyone else is worthless? Those schools (and anyone else profiting) would certainly want you to believe so, so they have less competition in the workplace and more competition to get into their schools. But the bottom line is, it's a marketing gimmick. A big, gigantic, bullshit marketing gimmick.  There is no easy answer other than to decide within yourself that what makes someone worthy of note isn't what school name they have on an official piece of paper, nor how smart they claim to be or how well-known they are. To me, people to look up to are people who have conquered their emotions, people who have no fears. Every other thing on this planet, including wealth, a person can get 100% by cheating and being full of shit. They can be completely fucked up and have everything, everything, and every person can look at them and say ""I would do ANYTHING to be that person"", when in reality, that person doesn't even want to be that person. So fuck everything else: the only thing that a person cannot get by bullshitting is complete and total inner peace, so that is the only thing that matters.  Having said all of that... please go easy on yourself. Comparing yourself to others is the worst thing you can do because there's always some way you can find yourself ""lesser""-- and if you don't, what in the world did you really accomplish? There are no winners in comparing yourself to others. So try to let those thoughts go as they come to you.  I wish you the best."
MMFB,3bdkl1,Lytelife,2,Sun Jun 28 05:43:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I agree that I'm very insecure, and I'd say it's due to the fact that, during my 19 years of existence, I've accomplished nothing. I have nothing to write home about. If I was to die today, there'd be nothing to remember me by. There isn't anything I've done that someone else can't do in their sleep. Getting into Harvard, on the other hand, is something that few people can do."
MMFB,3bdkl1,Lytelife,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:54:55 2015 UTC,"Do you think you'll be able to accomplish something real if you keep beating yourself up?  In order to accomplish real things, you have to believe in yourself first. You already have to feel like you've accomplished the entire world. Do you know why confident people feel, look and act confident and it looks like they can go out and do anything? It's because they know they can-- not because they did, because tons of people have accomplished huge things and still don't feel that way, but because in their mind they know they will go for it and succeed, and that is the secret.  Here's the other half to that coin. Nothing anyone does will be remembered. We are all going to die and disappear into dust and everything we cared about and worked for and loved and hated is going to die and turn into dust. Shakespeare will be forgotten. Harvard will be forgotten. If we don't blow ourselves up, or get blown up, or a massive disease wipes us all out, the sun is going to expand and cook everything someday.  Nothing physical on this earth matters.  The only thing that matters is the tiny strip of time that you have, right now. Make it worth it for YOU. Learn how to be happy! Learn how to love yourself!! Do you know how many people in this world have never learned to love themselves? That right there would be a massive accomplishment. Will you be remembered forever for it? You will be by the people whose lives you touched with your kindness.   If you want to get into Harvard, go do it. But don't think it's going to make you happy... and that's really all you need to care about in this world. It's all that matters."
MMFB,3bdkl1,huehueeuh,2,Sun Jun 28 18:33:47 2015 UTC,I think my issue is that I really don't have any meaningful accomplishments. I don't have anything to prop myself up with when I'm not feeling good about myself.  Thanks for your time.
MMFB,3bdkl1,BiH_USA_Activist,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:10:42 2015 UTC,"I have a two part reply to your post-   You say that you are destined to be mediocre. If you think that way, you most certainly will be. However, there is also a chance that you get good at what you do, get really really good at the small details and find something (company/person) that has a huge potential but being ignored at the moment and work hard to make that thing work. And then work your way upwards from there onwards. High risk, high returns is the way to go for you if you want that kind of life.  About guys like him getting anything they would ever want, I guess this question arises in the straight relationships as well. But keep in mind that relationships are not a game of maths where points are calculated and a match is made. Something clicks and two random strangers with nothing in common start to like each other. And I think there are only assholes who would dupe their partner because they can get someone better in terms of looks/money.   So buckle up. Start focussing on your career and good things will happen to you on your way."
MMFB,3bdkl1,adriennegirl,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:17:06 2015 UTC,"There are different types of intelligence. When it comes to social interactions, the guy you dated sounds like an idiot. If you think about it, the show Big Bang Theory is really about four idiots. Punchlines in that show are about socially stupid things done by for protagonists.  When I started college I believed that I would have a regular job with regular family and regular kids and then I will grow old and die, and dying seemed like the best part. While I got the basic outline right, I could not have been more wrong. Turns out that my wife and my kids are amazing and unique people. I may never be famous and revered world wide but I have my own slice of heaven and I would not trade places with anyone.  Point is that you don't know what life is like until you live it, and it will surprise you in ways that you don't expect. You think you know what grand canyon is like because you saw a picture, but then when you see it for real you go ""wow""."
MMFB,3bdkl1,walk_through_this,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:10:07 2015 UTC,"People that seem like they have it all are often unhappy on the inside. You never know from the surface. You will find happiness...simplify, breath and take it easy. You're still young and have a lot of time!"
MMFB,3bd688,Tinasworld,4,Sun Jun 28 02:35:56 2015 UTC,"You are looking at this the wrong way. You thought that this was your best interview ever, which means that you feel that you are getting better over time. Similarly, your ex was your longest relationship ever, which means that trend is upwards."
MMFB,3bd688,BiH_USA_Activist,2,Sun Jun 28 03:44:24 2015 UTC,"Hm, didn't look at it that way. You're right. I guess i've just run out of patience & thought that things were finally going to change. But i guess progress has been made..slowly but surely. Thank you!"
MMFB,3bd688,orphan26,2,Sun Jun 28 06:54:30 2015 UTC,"it's ok to rant when you're feeling down about not getting a job but here's the good part, once you get your foot in the door, that is all you need to start building yourself and your value. Keep trying, never stop trying. Jobs is also all about who you know so i would start prodding your friends to see if they know about any job availability to help get you started.  don't worry about the relationship part - think about it this way, you probably dodged a bullet with that guy. if he's not looking for long term that means he probably would have hurt you somewhere down the road (maybe not but to my experience this has always happened)."
MMFB,3bd688,walk_through_this,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:53:58 2015 UTC,"First of all thank you for reading my essay of a rant, really appreciate it. And you're absolutely right, i have to continue to try & just hope i keep making progress. Not that i have a choice to stop trying lol. It's just annoying feeling sorry for myself sometimes.  Yes, glad i ended it with him when i did or else i'd be setting myself up for heartbreak. A relationship can wait & it'll happen when it happens.  Thanks again:)"
