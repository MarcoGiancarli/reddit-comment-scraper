BodyAcceptance,3dzrr9,Marinaisgo,9,Mon Jul 20 21:16:26 2015 UTC,"Words only go so far but, I've been in your boat, I'm way better now than I ever have been (bloodwork is even on point!), and there is definitely hope for you.  What helped me? Food became my friend. Not my enemy, not my obsession, just a kind friend that checks in on you, making sure you're alive and well.  It was gradual, and often I wasn't aware of it, but that mindset towards food now has saved me from misery and sickness.  You have to let go of thinking that restraining gives you ""power,"" because it's making you absolutely powerless. Coming to terms with food, embracing it as a friend, tackling your health, that's the most powerful and amazing thing you can do.  So work hard on ensuring you get nutrients, plan your meals. Think of the ED as a big ugly cancerous tumor, and you are on your way to beat it. It will be hard work but face it head on every day. Shout to yourself how much you're going to kick it's ass. Make a list of strategies. Let REAL health be your obsession.  I know this sub is about body acceptance, but for me, that started with food acceptance and friendship.  and start cooking, I made a pesto sauce with homegrown basil today and omg I am so proud and it is so good"

Getting to the root of why you go to the ""shame spiral"" and rewriting the script so you can be nice to yourself instead is so, so hard to do alone, but so vital.   I wish you all the luck in the world and please feel free to PM me if you want to talk. Having supportive people you can discuss these issues with without fear is also a big help."

Do you analyse every person you see in a bikini or other? No. Same goes. People don't have time to be looking at you being harsh. And if they do they are insecure and the worst that will happen is they think you look...bad? They might give a look or whisper to a friend but you want to get to a place where you don't notice and if you do you know you're worth more than a strangers comment! What is it that bothers you about your body and your butt?

I don't really mind what strangers think, however, I do mind going out in a swimsuit with people I know or having a potential partner see me unclothed. I'm just generally unshapely, and covered in noticeable stretch-marks. I know I shouldn't really complain ><"
BodyAcceptance,3drx22,jelliknight,2,Sat Jul 18 22:41:49 2015 UTC,"I've written about this a few times before, because last year I started wearing a fatkini. It was kind of a big deal for me and i had to rationalise my way through it so i try to share a few of my epiphanies.  It's not like I'm going to come out in a bikini and my friend's are going to say ""OMG, jelliknight is fat? ALL THESE YEARS AND I NEVER KNEW!"". It's not a state secret. Whatever clothes I'm wearing people can already see the basic shape of me. Whatever it is that you're trying to hide under your clothes, the cat's probably already out of the bag. And cellulite and stretch marks? Most women have them to some degree so you're not going to surprise anyone. The worst a person is going to think of you is 'oh look, there goes a totally normal looking human being in a swim suit"" and at best they'll think ""wow, i wish i had her guts"". Advertising has made us think that looking like a normal person isn't ok, that we have to look perfect to be seen. Fuck that. You're a human being; a wobbly, imperfect, sack of meat and blood with at most 80 more years staggering around the surface of this rock. You are enough. Don't waste your brief life obsessing over the shape of your meat sack.  What is it you think is 'wrong' with your butt anyway? Too flat, too round, too big, too small? I've got a flattish kinda saggy butt and I'm trying Strong Curves to see if I can give it a bit of a boost, but if I can't it doesn't matter. Really, in the grand scheme of things, it matters about as little as anything could possibly matter. You're bum is behind you for a reason ;) you don't have to look at it, and you don't have to love it but stop giving it power over you.  BTW if your stretch marks are on your belly look into high waisted bikini bottoms. They'll cover them up and look cute as fuck too :)"

And though I'd hypothetically like a perky round bum, it might actually not suit my body shape. You can't just cut and paste your favourite bits of different bodies together, you know? It'd be weird, like mixing chocolate and ketchup (both great with other things, terrible together). You've gotta have a balance. Maybe your genes are the way they are for a reason.  There are all different shaped bums, square and round, big and small, perky and high or saggy and low, wide or narrow. There's no right or wrong, or good or bad. They just are. They're for sitting on not looking at.  Nah, keep the mirror. Just smack yourself on the booty and wink everytime you look at it. Fake it til you make it!"

BodyAcceptance,3do28e,megg802,5,Sat Jul 18 03:47:35 2015 UTC,"I found this the other day and it really struck a chord with me. We were not born to be pretty. We can't let anyone judge us by this, including ourselves. We're SO MUCH more than what we look like.  Also, here's some badass inspiration from a badass woman to keep you centered and remind you there's many many more important things:   “Fat’ is usually the first insult a girl throws at another girl when she wants to hurt her.  I mean, is ‘fat’ really the worst thing a human being can be? Is ‘fat’ worse than ‘vindictive’, ‘jealous’, ‘shallow’, ‘vain’, ‘boring’ or ‘cruel’? Not to me; but then, you might retort, what do I know about the pressure to be skinny? I’m not in the business of being judged on my looks, what with being a writer and earning my living by using my brain…  I went to the British Book Awards that evening. After the award ceremony I bumped into a woman I hadn’t seen for nearly three years. The first thing she said to me? ‘You’ve lost a lot of weight since the last time I saw you!’  ‘Well,’ I said, slightly nonplussed, ‘the last time you saw me I’d just had a baby.’  What I felt like saying was, ‘I’ve produced my third child and my sixth novel since I last saw you. Aren’t either of those things more important, more interesting, than my size?’ But no – my waist looked smaller! Forget the kid and the book: finally, something to celebrate!  I’ve got two daughters who will have to make their way in this skinny-obsessed world, and it worries me, because I don’t want them to be empty-headed, self-obsessed, emaciated clones; I’d rather they were independent, interesting, idealistic, kind, opinionated, original, funny – a thousand things, before ‘thin’. And frankly, I’d rather they didn’t give a gust of stinking chihuahua flatulence whether the woman standing next to them has fleshier knees than they do. Let my girls be Hermiones, rather than Pansy Parkinsons.”  ― J.K. Rowling"

BodyAcceptance,3d317o,sophiamarinara,5,Mon Jul 13 03:06:42 2015 UTC,"Your story is so similar to many others, like you said ""I'm so much more than a body"" yet when making healthy lifestyle changes it's hard to remember that.   I too am currently trying to take back years of body abuse. I was a little chubby at the age of 14 and wanted to lose weight. I skipped breakfast, lunch and only had a little bit of tea. I drunk SO MUCH green tea and water just trying to fill the hungry little void in my stomach. I dropped 2 stone and became underweight. I was never diagnosed with anything because even though I was underweight not many people noticed - I still have chubby arms and face.   I have been going through this battle for 5 years now, on and off yo-yo dieting. Some days are good, some days are bad. The thing about dieting is that once you start to lose weight, it becomes addictive and you cant stop.   I am recovering and every day I see myself becoming more and more accepting of my body. You are more than just a body and starving yourself of what you need ISN'T HEALTHY. Well done on cutting the drugs and smoking, but what you ate before was obviously okay because you were a healthy weight. Allow yourself to have that chocolate bar. You need to eat regularly to live. Being healthy is looking after your body and you need to learn to love yourself before making any changes."
BodyAcceptance,3d317o,j0ngooch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:51:10 2015 UTC,"Hey, congratulations on your recovery. It sounds like you're doing well and focusing on things that matter, and trying to let go of the things that don't. I know how hard it is and so I really truly mean it when I say you should be really proud of yourself, because you deserve to be happy and treat yourself nicely. I'm proud of you, anyway :)  I want to just disagree with the bolded statement you posted - I don't think I would have responded if it weren't in bold, actually, but it caught my eye and so I felt I wanted to speak up and say that as a universal statement that can apply to all people, I don't think the 'thing' about dieting is that once you start, you can't stop. I think the problem is the idea of 'dieting' in the first place, because by committing to a 'diet' you're essentially accepting the body expectations and standards of a culture that celebrates distorted, extreme, unhealthy bodies (and adds them even when they aren't there!). I guess I can only speak for myself and say that the addicting part for me wasn't the weight loss by itself, you know, but the way looking a certain way made me feel. And the only reason why I wanted to look that way (still sometimes do, but I don't dwell on it) was because of these standards and expectations I internalized from somewhere.  In my case, it was through media - I was a big consumer of pop culture growing up in the early 2000's, and I know my expectations came from projections of body ideals through music, TV, and films."
BodyAcceptance,3d317o,whathappenedwas,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:00:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! It's definitely been a long road, but totally worth it :)  So true!  I think it really has to do with my location as well.  I live in Boulder, where being trim and eating EXTREMELY healthy is practically an expectation.  I really love feeling radiantly confident, (exercise and eating healthy really help do that for me,) but I've been trying to grow into space where the choices I make are for my overall health rather than appearance.  It's a total trap because as I get into health and fitness more- I always seem to backtrack my mental progress into a mentality that I ""could be losing more weight"" or ""doing a better job of eating healthier"".  Don't get me wrong, I love living here, but it can be awfully hard when I'm surrounded by so much ""fit"" propaganda and pressure."

My activity levels, food, and lifestyle have changed multiple times over the past 10 years and I see shifts in my body.  Get rid of those jeans.  I could wear a size 0 at age 14, by 19 it was a 4-6 and now at 23 I am closer to an 6-8. Am I fat? Not at all, and I'm probably in better shape than I was then (stronger/faster) plus...

BodyAcceptance,3cq67g,RubyPeacock,2,Thu Jul 9 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"I feel ya.. I struggle with similar feelings. I recommend CBT therapy to try to counteract the negative thoughts. CBT is based around changing negative and self defeating thoughts through awareness.  You seem to have a busy mind that is thinking distorted/judgmental thoughts. When you think a thought, say ""is this helping or hurting?"" And if it's hurting then then recognize that it's just a thought-- not necessarily a true one, and very possibly a distorted or exaggerated one.  Also, try to be kind to yourself about the fact that you think these thoughts.. It's totally normal and beating yourself up about not being confident will just make the thoughts stickier, if that makes sense.  As for your concerns about your bf, it seems like you are seeing issues that don't exist. From what you say, it seems like he sees a wonderful lovable person in you just as you are. Give him (and yourself) some credit.. He can't be totally crazy/wrong or you wouldn't be with him!"
BodyAcceptance,3cq67g,pricklycitrus,2,Fri Jul 10 02:14:56 2015 UTC,"At first I wondered if I wrote this post.  Two years ago I started moving in a healthy direction for the first time in my life. I took an interest in cooking and exercise, and I felt great about how I looked. Then last fall I started grad school. I had a really hard year and got hell of depression, and I let go of all the healthy habits I had built.  Once the academic year ended I decided to get back what I'd lost, and now I'm at the end of a no-exceptions 30-day nutritional reboot. The last time I did this program I had lost 7 lbs at the end of it, with no exercise. I've been exercising this time. I had gotten rid of my scale when I started living this new way, so I only just weighed myself today, and I weigh 25 lbs more than I did when I felt like I still had to lose about 15 lbs. It's a higher number than I've ever seen on a scale, and I'm certain I've lost weight in the last month.  It was so disheartening and frustrating I didn't know what to do with myself, and where before I saw just me in a cute dress I now see a fat girl. I'm going to a wedding in two days where I'll see a bunch of cousins who have been skinny all my life, and my brother is fitter than I've ever seen him, and I'm dreading it. My boyfriend has been nothing but supportive and I know that in time I'll get back to where I was, but I just can't get away from this image of myself, and I'm terrified of everything crashing down again with the new school year.  I think for me a lot of it is that I have a lot of anxiety about school and my future, and I'm directing that at my body because it's easier to deal with. (And a culturally acceptable way to hate myself. But I'll try not to get too dark.)  OP, thank you for your post. You're not alone. It's hard out there.  And get rid of your scale they bring only unhappiness."

I've found them to be very welcoming and helpful in boosting my self confidence. I know what it's like to hate your body; it's a daily struggle.  Is it possible to see a therapist or can you talk to a friend? Maybe try things that make you feel beautiful. I like playing with my makeup & hair to make myself feel better. Maybe even do my nails. When I feel like I have put effort into my appearance it gives me confidence and helps me put on a smile.  Good luck. You really aren't alone.

It impacts my life and those around me due to my fragrance and sweat intolerances. I regularly have open sores and I end up bleeding in the sheets from scratches on my legs and arms and face etc.  Here is my one and only true piece, never seems to fail, of advice:  You MUST learn to love yourself before anyone else can love you. And it's HARD AS FUCK to learn to do that.   Go see a therapist, I think it would help. It's scary and shitty and may cost money, but you gotta do it. Find one thing you enjoy or are good at and do it.  Find one thing about yourself that you do like and PLAY IT UP. I like my eyes, I sure as hell wear eye makeup everyday. I also like my butt. I wear tighter pants. Don't look at the shitty stuff. Focus on the thing you love about your body, even if it's just the curve of your ear or the way your eyebrows arch. I would also suggest you start doing some kind of exercise, even just walking outside for fifteen minutes. It helps with depression and anxiety.  I hear people always talking about how no one could or would love them. I thought that too. But I found someone and with time, knowledge and learning to love yourself, you will too.   Good luck. And trust me about the therapy."

Many people feel uncomfortable looking at themselves, so celebrate that!  Being able to observe a change means you're attentive and present; there's no need to read into what it means.

So--at the very worst? It's just trying to communicate with your head. Your body is functioning and behaving as any other body might.   It's been with you, there for you for your entire life, and deserves to be listened to (not ignored or hated).  You do have a relationship with your body. Right now you're at odds with each other.

You've described the way the human body works when the endocrine system is functioning correctly.  There are a lot of endocrine disorders that can cause weight gain, even with good diet & exercise.    There are also a lot of other health problems that can make exercise difficult or impossible, which can lead to weight gain.  Often these health problems aren't outwardly visible, which leads to outside observers assuming that the person just didn't make healthy choices about diet & exercise.  In the United States, poverty also makes it extremely difficult to eat healthy.  Unhealthy foods are cheaper than healthy foods in the US, by a lot."

BodyAcceptance,3by0at,mizmoose,3,Fri Jul 3 02:43:55 2015 UTC,"Studies going back over 50 years show that some people, due to what is now known to be specific genes, will often retain any weight gained due to the body fighting tooth and nail to not want that extra weight to go away.  Some people are able to simply diet for a few days and have weight come right off.  Some people can change their diet and the body does not want to burn off the fat. One of the things that can happen is that stored fat can take more energy to burn than freely available calories (ie. food just eaten that hasn't yet been stored). The harder it is to burn off that extra fat, the harder it is to lose weight.  And there's a point where a ""low calorie diet"" might work but it can go too low and become dangerous.  Very low calorie diets can cause a host of problems including muscle-mass loss, gallbladder stones and illness, and heart problems, and should never be done without close doctor supervision - it requires a multitude of weekly (or more) monitoring tests.  Look for a BBC documentary called ""Why Thin People Aren't Fat"" where they not only talk to experts but they do a repeat of a study that's been done multiple times, only this time with far more advanced equipment, to see what happens when you take naturally thin people, who come from thin families, and feed them craploads of calories, and then put them back on their normal diet.  In the original study they had a handful of participants who didn't lose weight after going back to a ""normal"" diet. All were found to be from families where there was a lot of obesity.  It was one of the first clues to the genetic involvement in the complex mess that is obesity."
BodyAcceptance,3by0at,mizmoose,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:55:36 2015 UTC,"You are not wrong. Medications and some conditions can contribute to around 10-20lbs of weight gain. Retaining water can really cause your weight to shoot up. The issue usually comes from these medications/conditions causing the person to feel hungry all.the.time. It's not to say that you destined to be overweight but depending on the medical issue and other contributing factors such socio-economics, mental health, family support and readily accessible health care can all lead to it being hard to manage."
BodyAcceptance,3by0at,Coocoo_for_cocopuffs,-2,Fri Jul 3 13:11:23 2015 UTC,"Many people think that they have some sort of genetic predisposition but a lot of them are wrong. A lot of people such as food addicts like to use it as an excuse actually. They simply lack knowledge about what they're putting into themselves. Hiring a nutritionist to help form a balanced diet is essential for these people and can do wonders.  Some people will also exercise without changing their diet. They will say... 'No matter how much I exercise I can't lose weight'. Exercise and diet go hand in hand. You really need both. Diet is the most important of the two though.  Some people also don't understand exactly how much exercise they need and what type of exercises to do. The average person needs a ton of exercise to stay healthy. Running the treadmill once a week for 15 minutes will not cut it.  Then there are the people who legit have either a genetic predisposition or chronic illness that makes it extremely hard to lose any pounds. These people are a bit more rare. Personally I've taken medication that makes me hungry 24/7. The kind of hunger that makes you feel like absolute shit. If I didn't eat, I would get intense migraines. I had to take the medication though so I had no control.  Zoloft doesn't cause me to gain weight personally. It actually motivates me to exercise which is nice. Lexapro however... lets not talk about that."
BodyAcceptance,3by0at,cobra4m,2,Tue Jul 7 01:57:31 2015 UTC,You don't need to exercise to lose weight. All you need is a caloric deficit.
BodyAcceptance,3by0at,weggeworfene-leiter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:20:27 2015 UTC,Being physically active/burning calories means you're helping to create that deficit.
BodyAcceptance,3by0at,Apt_5,0,Tue Jul 14 23:55:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, but not much. You need to run 35 miles to burn one pound. It will help, but it's misleading (and false) to say that you NEED to exercise to lose weight. You don't need to exercise to lose weight; if you just cut your caloric intake you'll still lose weight, and focusing on your eating patterns is the more effective route of the two. But if you want to muscle tone, improve strength, become healthier in other ways, etc., then of course you need to exercise.  Plus there's evidence that exercising can sabotage many people's eating habits, making them hungrier and pushing them to eat back the deficit they just created and then some: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/upshot/to-lose-weight-eating-less-is-far-more-important-than-exercising-more.html?_r=0  So let's move away from a narrative that just confuses people, shall we? Especially when very obese people who have limitations on what forms of calorie-burning exercise they can do get discouraged from trying to lose weight because they think they need to exercise in order to do so. In reality, they can create a huge deficit just by cutting calories significantly."
BodyAcceptance,3by0at,weggeworfene-leiter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"a narrative that just confuses people   Wow, you really don't give potential ""dieters"" much credit, do you? Additionally, this all makes the point that you originally responded to which clearly states that diet is the main factor in weight loss.  Secondly, I never said one needs to exercise to lose weight. I'm not focusing on aesthetics/weight loss alone, I'm thinking of overall health- shallow just to think only of looks isn't it? I thought one of the major tenets of body acceptance is to realize that a person's looks don't necessarily reflect the condition of their health, since a thin person can have their own deficiencies as well."

I am a Dietetics major on the path to be a dietitian (ANYONE can say they are a nutritionist). Dietitians collectively agree on these two things: 1. Obesity is a condition caused by MULTIPLE factors. 2. Weight loss is more complex than simply eating at a caloric deficit (this is aimed at one of the other comments).  I think that it is very unfair to try to reduce either of those factors to a simple answer. They are very complex processes, and there is a reason people (like myself) will dedicate their entire careers to these very problems."

I weigh in the high 200s, which is normal for me, and only slightly less than my genetic relatives. I formerly had an eating disorder, which did not produce weight loss even when I was eating under 500 calories a day.  If you have a metabolic condition like PCOS, hypothyroidism, pituitary illnesses, etc, massive weight gain with no change in diet and exercise is very common. If you simply inherit the genetics for fatness, you can also have an extremely low caloric intake and still be very fat, as your body will be programmed to create more (rather than enlarged) fat cells, and fat cells never disappear from the body."

I used to be super active, and even then was always pretty substantial. So are all the women in my family.   Once the pain from fibromyalgia got extreme, I started becoming unable to do the physical activity I once did. And my period makes me ravenously hungry for days. Those two things alone snowballed into a lot of weight gain. I want to work out, and want to enjoy it, but the pain it causes me after is so bad that I can't work or function as a normal human being.  I feel incredibly defensive telling my story because the usual response is ""well, you should work out anyway, and diet constantly!"" Okay, then what? I have to quit my job because I can't perform? I have dieted quite a lot, but without working out, the calorie deficit I'd need to create to lose weight just means I'm miserable all the time. I'm already miserable enough as it is, I can't make it any worse. Food is one of very few positive experiences in my life. This weight issue has caused me to engage in some disordered eating (extreme diets) and have a lot of obsession around food. All of which were encouraged by my doctors, because apparently eating disorders are ok if you're fat.  Regarding food: More fruits/veggies/natural proteins than most of my cohort (esp due to to environmental concerns over factory farming), but...does it matter?  People often see fat as causing a disability, but in most cases I know of, the disability comes first."

It turns out vitamin deficiencies and hormone disorders can cause depression, weight gain, and a lot of other problems.    Talk to your doctor about Vitamin D and B-12 deficiencies, PCOS, thyroid issues, insulin resistance, anemia, etc.  PCOS in particular is really common (1 in 5 women) and can cause a ton of those issues.

Imagine if you were saying all of those things to yourself as a child. You probably wouldn't, right? So when you look in the mirror, imagine yourself as a pure child, and tell you that you are perfect the way you are. Untouched. Childlike. Clean. Happy.   Once you figure out how to be nicer to yourself, it may become easier to focus on a healthy way to lose weight. Keep a log of how you combat your negative thoughts so that you have to keep yourself accountable. Also, if it's possible, I would suggest seeing a counselor or doing some group therapy. All of these things help me on my journey, and I hope it gives you some hope."

I used to be on Yaz, and that helped a lot with my acne but I had to get my gallbladder removed a few years ago when I was 18 so my mom made me switch birth controls. The one I am on now really made me gain weight and I feel like it's made my acne worse, so I definitely need to make a OBGYN appt soon.  I just subscribed to that subreddit, thankyou :)"

You should wash your sheets and pillow cases once a week if you aren't already."
BodyAcceptance,3bcgrp,buttercult,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:01:16 2015 UTC,Definitely!  And use non irritating laundry detergents as well.   Basically you have to eliminate everything that could possibly cause irritation to your skin.  Also start exfoliating with a soft body brush!
BodyAcceptance,3bcgrp,yodelayoo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:07:37 2015 UTC,"I never thought of this, I moved into my boyfriends with his family so maybe the laundry detergent and all they use could have something to do with it.

Does anyone know if certain birth controls can actually make acne worse?"
BodyAcceptance,3b2ly1,inkathinka,4,Thu Jun 25 13:44:18 2015 UTC,What kind of comments is he making?  I wonder if he feels insecure because you look great.
BodyAcceptance,3b2ly1,algohn,4,Thu Jun 25 14:05:41 2015 UTC,"Lots of little digs. Like I took a selfie and he said I looked like Golem in it. Yesterday he texted me an illustration of a sleeping woman (I didn't know it was b/c he meant to attach an article he thought I would be interested in), and when I asked him if he sent it because he thought it looked like me, he said, ""You wish you looked like that."" And it's always, ""God, can't you take a joke?"" which I've explained that I could, if it was balanced with a compliment or affection once in a while, but even when he does, it's feels forced and I can tell not genuine. I don't think he feels insecure because I look great. He's very appearance oriented."
BodyAcceptance,3b2ly1,algohn,3,Thu Jun 25 14:16:22 2015 UTC,"And also, I think it's important to know that I'm an introvert, and he is ""my person"" so it doesn't matter how many other people tell me how great I look, the fact that he doesn't is making me feel like I'm on a ledge and about to fall into a scary place."
BodyAcceptance,3b2ly1,JasonYoakam,2,Thu Jun 25 14:22:37 2015 UTC,Has he always made these remarks about your appearance? I'm trying to understand if this a long-term dynamic between you two or if he's started a new behavior.
BodyAcceptance,3b2ly1,Coocoo_for_cocopuffs,3,Thu Jun 25 18:29:01 2015 UTC,"Probably yes, it's a long-term dynamic, it's just affecting me more because of my own feelings about aging and wanting to be seen as desirable. It's somewhat of a cultural difference, (he's black Latino), so snapping is just something he and his friends have always done naturally (she doesn't have a forehead, she has a fivehead, stuff like that.) He jokes around with our boys the same way. But since our boys are now teenagers, I just feel like I'm outnumbered and invisible a lot of the time, and I've expressed this many times, but it just makes him angry instead of listening and respecting my feelings. He says that I'm calling him a monster, but I'm not, I'm just trying to get him to see the need for a change."
BodyAcceptance,3b2ly1,Coocoo_for_cocopuffs,3,Thu Jun 25 20:11:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear about this... This is a common experience with women, and its totally normal to get more insecure about your appearance as you age. Even though people used to joke, you used to be able to shrug it off because you had a greater sense of yourself or perhaps you were able to compare yourself to others that were less attractive and feel confident in that.  But the truth is, you likely do not look like a teenager. The point of this sub, I believe, is to realize that all you can do is your best. If you are really doing your best to be healthy and be in shape and be the best version of yourself there is nothing to feel self-conscious or defensive about.  If you are not doing your best, sure, change that and grow as a person, but if you are, then you deserve to feel confident. Change the only thing left for you to change: change your beliefs about yourself.  Did you know that even models feel ugly? It is because they are comparing themselves to other models. Many millionares feel poor because they hang out with billionaires. The only thing that differentiates a person who feels ugly from a person who feels beautiful is their beliefs."
BodyAcceptance,3b2ly1,JasonYoakam,3,Thu Jun 25 20:53:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you, Jason. I understand what you're saying, but I think the thing is, I'm not talking about people, or even myself, it is the person I've committed my life to. I am doing my best, and I know that I look better than I have in years, and on most days I'm really proud of that. I'm not delusional, I don't think I look like a teenager, but I can still hold my own. It's just difficult to stay positive on a daily basis when the person I love is continually negative, even after I've expressed how much I would appreciate some positive reinforcement. I need to know that he still finds me physically attractive. It could be just twice a year to counter all the ""joking."" I don't think that's asking a lot and I don't know why it's met with such resistance."
BodyAcceptance,3b2ly1,ChonchoStryker,8,Thu Jun 25 21:21:23 2015 UTC,"Ok I'm just going to say, asking him to cut that shit out, is NOT asking to change his personality. Saying otherwise is a cop out. How is he doing physically? Over weight? Health issues? I'm just wondering if he himself is feeling a tad insecure with your weight loss or maybe inadequate due to health problems etc.  My husband and I joke a bit about our appearances etc, but it's never catty or mean. I would focus your next conversation on what it means to build each other up. Don't focus on the things he has done wrong because he will get defensive and it won't change what has already happened. Instead focus on discussing positive things he can do for you as a show of support. This way you are explicitly telling him how to help the situation. If the comments continue, I would stop him immediately, and flat out say that speaking to you in that regard is unacceptable and not to bother talking to you until he decides to be an adult."
BodyAcceptance,3b2ly1,JasonYoakam,3,Thu Jun 25 22:09:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, he has a chronic illness and very serious health issues recently. Which makes me even more upset, because I feel like I go out of my way for him all the time, to help him get better, to make him feel good about himself, and this is not asking for much. But thank you, because I know you're right, he hates to hear me telling him that he is doing something wrong and gets very defensive. My hormones are also a part of this, I've never had PMS before but lately it is out of control and this is always the time when I feel like I just can't take it anymore and say something, usually through anger and tears and not a calm conversation."
BodyAcceptance,3b2uz5,ijustbluemyselfff,2,Thu Jun 25 14:58:00 2015 UTC,"I have a ""team"" - me, my therapist, and a nutritionist - that works together to discuss my problems, eating habits, and general anxieties around food/exercise. It has been amazingly helpful.  So maybe offering free and/or reduced counseling services? And if you could get some nutritionists to volunteer, that would be amazing.  Additionally, a lot of my focus with my nutritionist has been about eating smart to avoid being hungry in the evening, which usually promotes bingeing for me (which ultimately affects my self image). So workshops/meetings/group therapy on meal planning, grocery shopping planning, healthy eating, exercise planning, and cooking? If that makes sense.  I could imagine almost a cross between AA and weight watchers-esque style of talking - like everyone sits and discusses a set of topics.  Sorry that was a ramble!! I think this is a great idea."

I've done a lot of horrible things to lose weight and was never successful.  I was always ""overweight"", being about 5 foot 2 and a half and my heaviest weight being 158.7 pounds.  I'm currently doing Weight Watchers which has been the best way I have lost weight (in a HEALTHY way) while getting support and learning how to accept my body and love myself.  They help you understand that there is no failure, only progress.  Something my WW leader says is ""If you eat good, you do good and if you do good, you eat good.""  It's a very open group where everyone shares their same struggles with food and offers suggestions on how to curb cravings and make delicious meals and what they did when they were discouraged.  Although most of the members of the WW meetings I attend are older adults, it's still a comforting way to talk openly about how you feel.  And even if you don't want to talk, it's good to hear that you're not the only one struggling with body image issues.  You would be amazed how it has impacted their lives as they are middle-aged adults.  I'm glad that I am seeing this now that I am younger, so I am a happy adult and love my body.  I've been doing WW for a few months now and I'm about 133-135 pounds and I still have moments where I'm hateful towards my body and I have old negative thoughts return like old friends, but it's important to keep persevering through it.  Loving yourself and loving your body is a long and difficult process, but I know it will definitely be a rewarding one.  Good luck with your community center!"

It creates horrid scars, and as I'm just now getting better, I'm able to see the extent of them. I want you to know that at least for me, it's not something I ever notice as unattractive on other people. Even extreme cases. When people smile, I automatically think they're much more attractive because damn, they're happy :) Do you notice that as well in other people? Strong odds are that people notice it about you. Acne scars suck! But they can be fixed, and they aren't unattractive IMO. Here's some tips that have faded and healed a lot of mine to almost perfectly clear  -Lavender oil -Hyaluronic acid (Best recommendation imo)  -Puremedy original healing salve - Clarisonic brushes  -Resurfacing treatments -'Hyro' facials (A brand, but can be found pretty easily at a lot of day spas) -Deep sea mud face masks -Lemon juice (one of the best) -Honey   Hey, I hope you're able to see and love your beauty. I have no doubt in my mind that you have it. Stay strong, I know how you feel.   PS: have you heard of mindfulness exercises? These help a lot to create a positive mindset and has rapidly decreased my anxiety/depression/low self esteem :)"

BodyAcceptance,3arq3p,robhogg68,2,Sat Jun 27 14:52:48 2015 UTC,"I hate when people see pictures of my best friend and comment on how pretty she is because I can't measure up to that.  My friends tell me I'm pretty but I think they are lying to me to save my feelings from being hurt.   So, you believe people are being sincere, when they say something nice about your friend. But when they say something nice about you,  you think they're being insincere. This is not uncommon for all of us with self-esteem issues. But is it reasonable?  When a friend compliments you, don't make excuses, don't try to minimise it. Hear it.   I have this great guy in my life who tells me I'm beautiful and when I'm around him I truly feel like I am.   That's because you are. Beauty, it is said, is in the eye of the beholder. That's the only place that it is - despite what ""beauty gurus"" say, there are no fixed standards. If you look at something, or someone, and find it beautiful, then it is beautiful. And when this guy looks at you, you are beautiful. Try to hold onto that feeling...   My skin... my smile... my nose... my eyes   It's easy to magnify what we perceive as flaws, when we focus on details. Take a step back... what have you got going for you that you like?

If you need money for that there are a few subreddits about reading a few extra dollars in your spare time and how to do it. Save up a few dollars and head over to a thrift store. The goodwill sites by me always have some of their clothes half off which brings it to $1-2 for a garment.
BodyAcceptance,3apsa5,geomindspin,5,Mon Jun 22 16:24:42 2015 UTC,Also look for yard sales or Facebook sale groups. Often people will sell entire bags of clothing for just a few bucks.

She is just jealous and is not in your shoes and does not understand what it feels like to be in oversized clothes and having people stare at you.  Getting new clothes would be a confidence boost. I've been there.  I used to have an eating disorder, pretty much stopped eating and only had like a yogurt a day or a toast or something like that.  In 2013-2014, I went from 250lbs to 120lbs in less than half a year and had to buy new clothes a few times, not many though as I knew I'll have to buy new ones again soon. So, I just used what I had and washed it to use it again rather than buying many clothes, I only bought like two pair of pants and two pullovers, three shirts and of course new undies.  During that time, I bought clothes like two or three times, and in between that I had to walk around in lumpy clothes too and it's really not nice. You feel uncomfortable all the time and I know it's not nice. I'm sorry for your financial issues, but there should be places where you can get clothes for cheap. Goodwill, second-hand stores and so on. Just make sure to wash those properly before wearing them as someone else used them before you!  Other than that, if your boyfriend is financially in a good position, you could maybe ask him to help you out? Even if it's just a pair of pants or two, it helps to feel better already!  If you can't, try to at least ""upgrade"" your undies, you should be able to get some simple undies for really cheap (I went for simple, plain white cotton undies)! It's a step forward and you can build up from there. One piece of clothing at a time. Maybe next could be some shirts? I would go from ""light clothes"" first, to filling up your shelf. You need more of what you wear more often!  I'm glad that you lost weight in a healthy manner, as I did not.  It's really bad for your body and now I have skin ""left over"".  So, congratulations on loosing weight the healthy way!  Just remember that you don't deserve to feel bad. She's the one that should feel bad for what she said. If she's overweight, well, she's just jealous and doesn't have the same strength to loose weight as you have!  What your mom said is mean, I know it's hard but you need to ignore it and I hope you'll be able to look into the mirror some day (soon) and smile again!"

Self harm took me a while to heal, but I noticed the biggest change was my mindset about the cuts. I became ashamed of the wounds and proud of the scars. There was a time I felt comfort from the wounds, then after time I felt ashamed of them and the scars, but the pivotal point is deciding that, as long as those babies are HEALING, you're kicking ass and healing yourself. Healed scars are a sign you got through it. Work towards that :)  I'm sure others here will be more suitable for body acceptance, as I'm still going through that myself. It's hard to see how much it's in your head when it seems so real. I'm MUCH happier with myself now than I used to be, and it wasn't from changing my body. It really is possible, I can say first hand.   Just know that you have so much power and you can love yourself.

I do it because I deserve it and I love myself (I got a lot of faults - my wife reminds me all the time haha, but I deserve to be healthy).  And you know what happens when you invest in yourself - others will invest their love, their time and effort into you.  No one wants to invest in someone who doesn't believe in themselves.  If you call yourself a fat loser, then everyone else will think that - so stop telling yourself that.  Now go out there and kick some ass.  Go be a badass hot bitch momma!"

When I get really down about that sort of thing, I think about all the things my body does for me. There's so much value in the things that you can do. You can hold your babies in this body, and take bubble baths in it, and you can hug your husband, and stretch out in bed, and a million other things that are beautiful and fulfilling. Your body gives you the chance to live your beautiful life with your children. And it's easier said than done, but you should treat it with kindness and love for those things it can do."

God knows I need to show myself some good ole TLC. For a while I tried to do my hair and make up every day, but I gave up after about a week... With a 3 year old and a 5 month old it's even hard to fit in a 5 minute shower daily. But I at least allow myself that! I know once the kids get a little older I'll have more time to dedicate to my daily routine soon enough so I've kind of accepted that.. As far as shopping, we're on a tight ass budget since we're still in school and have two little ones, too. I wish we could go out on more dates, but unfortunately we just don't have the means..   As far as my weight, I'm trying really hard to stick with anything I can fit in exercise wise and we eat semi healthy already for the kids sake.. Hopefully I can get that down soon.. Thank you though for your suggestions. I feel like I'm always making excuses but maybe we're just a special situation. We have very little, we're very young, but we're (mostly) a very happy little family."

SHOULD I even accept myself as I am?    Mental health is part of overall health, and accepting yourself is likely to be good for this. What does it mean to accept yourself? Does it mean deciding never to change again, or does it just mean being able to say ""hey, where I am is pretty good""?

BodyAcceptance,39tj1w,Dontquitefit,39,Sun Jun 14 17:07:34 2015 UTC,"Here's some woman feedback.   I can't imagine why any woman would be prepared to have anything to do with them.   They're sexy, taste good, feel good, make us feel good, and using them to make YOU feel good is emotionally fulfilling.   I can only imagine what goes through a womans mind when she sees a man's balls.   ""OMG I can't wait to fondle those and tease them with my tongue.""  Women (who are attracted to men) don't have any problems with your genitals. We love your genitals. We want to play with your genitals. We want to cum all over your genitals. We also don't think it's weak or embarrassing if yours get hurt around us. If a woman is with you, she cares about you, and hates to see you in pain. She empathizes with your injury, and wants you to avoid injury as much as possible. But she absolutely will not shame you or blame you or judge you if an injury happens. We understand that it's a sensitive, vulnerable area (which is part of what makes it so fun and satisfying to caress and tease and otherwise play with). The eyeball is also a sensitive area; would you be ashamed and think yourself weak if someone jabbed you in the eye and it hurt?   The problem is that YOU have a problem with your genitals. You are having a pretty serious dysmorphic reaction to your own genitals, and you REALLY need to see a therapist to help you find the source of these feelings and work through them and learn techniques on how to redirect your thoughts to avoid the negative self-talk cycle."

BodyAcceptance,39tj1w,Bbh77,3,Mon Jun 15 12:14:40 2015 UTC,"I can imagine what I would think if I read a post like this....   Empathy for another person who is struggling with body image, like a lot of us do?  I do know that quite a lot of women (and men!) definitely are interested in male members. I remember a conversation with a friend and his GF, who were fascinated by the way the skin on his scrotum moved, and were wondering whether all men's balls do this. Semen can be messy, of course, but it isn't a waste product.  Are your feelings mainly about your own body, or about male genitals in general?  If mainly about your own body, and you can handle it, it might be helpful to check out the range of shapes and sizes that are ""normal""... there are some good galleries of images online, which are very different to the penises that are shown in porn (though still NSFW):  Channel 4 (UK) ""Embarrassing Bodies"" Penis Gallery  If your feelings are about cocks and balls in general... it may be worth thinking that, if most women shared these feelings, then the human race would have died out a log time ago.  It might also help to read a little more about what women have to say about the subject. Nancy Friday collected a few volumes of women's sexual fantasies. The first of these, My Secret Garden has a section titled ""Women Do Look""."
BodyAcceptance,39tj1w,robhogg68,5,Mon Jun 15 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know about a ""Freudian"" approach, but plenty of therapists have experience helping men with body image issues. This would be my advice, for sure. When you're looking, have a single session with two or three before deciding if one is a good fit. Don't be afraid to specify what you feel comfortable with—for instance, a male therapist."
BodyAcceptance,39tj1w,DranoCleanse,2,Mon Jun 15 00:55:57 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a straight woman dating a man, I love male genitals. Cum is good too, I really like its texture when he comes on me and I love the way it feels when he cums in me. I don't have very many thoughts about balls. They are just kinda there when we have sex. They neither turn me on or off, they are just part of him being a man. I do like sucking his though, but purely because I love watching his face while I do.   I'm going to be straight with you; peniss ( peni?) are not objects of such beauty that would want to stare at one all day. HOWEVER, I feel like the same thing can be said for vaginas. Genitals aren't ( in my opinion) beautiful things. They are tools for the jobs of pleasuring your partner, having orgasms, and building love though intimacy. They are like a pair of running shoes. It would be great if they were pretty, but what they look like doesn't really matter to anyone but you. And what matters to you isn't what the shoes look like, it's how they make your feet feel.   And as far as injuring your balls in front of women goes, I wouldn't worry about it. If you work with adults, no sensible woman will tease you or make fun of you for injuring your genitals more than any other injury. Or if you work in a restaurant with children like me, just know that people will laugh at you for getting hurt for everything anyways. People will play up sexual injuries b/c they seem more interesting than other types or because they are childish.   So, maybe it would help if you stopped looking at them so much as 'genitals', this separate part of your body that seem to get in the way and are a vulnerability and started looking at them as conveniently attached tools for pleasure creation."

BodyAcceptance,39tj1w,KimJongSkill101,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:28:23 2015 UTC,"Look...some women fine penises and testicles to be nice to look at and some don't. I'm in the second camp, but does that mean I don't find men in general to be attractive? Hellz no! And would I want a man who didn't have a penis or balls? Hell no again! They serve a very important function: they give you pleasure and they give a woman pleasure as well. And women think it is sexy as hell to give men pleasure.  I don't know if this will work but maybe try to think of your dick/balls the same way you think of your tongue. Tongues are weird looking. They are kind of ugly and would be super-duper ugly if they were not attached to us. But tongues serve very important purposes. They give you the ability to talk (like penis/balls gives you the ability to reproduce), kiss, but perhaps more importantly, tongues also give you pleasure when they taste something delicious (like the pleasure of sex itself). You would never want to be rid of your tongue, despite the fact that spit is an unattractive body-fluid.  However, you probably have deep-seated issues with regard to sex in general and perhaps body-dismorphia (I don't think you are trans, but post in trans support subs and they might be able to direct you to better help). I really think this is more mental/sexual-health than body acceptance. Are you okay masturbating? If you are not yet comfortable masturbating and coming without shame on your own, I don't think you can expect to be comfortable doing so with a woman. My best guess is you were told at some point as a child that masturbating was wrong or your mother caught you or something equally traumatizing--otherwise you would feel the same way about your tongue as you do about your genitals."

BodyAcceptance,39doot,gryffindorrr,11,Thu Jun 11 05:35:44 2015 UTC,"This may be a bit long but please stick with me because I think I know something that could help you and anyone reading this. This is just me putting myself out there and trying to be helpful.  I do not have specific genetic reasons why I am also deemed 'ugly' by western beauty standards. It's just everyone who sees me thinks I'm to __ (fill in the blank) for something.  I'm tall and weigh 310 lbs, have patches and lines of darker and lighter skin. I have big hands, big feet, scars and a ""mean"" face. I have bad teeth, am also bucktoothed with an especially wide nose. My appearance still affects everything I do and other peoples opinion of me, which in turn affects my ability to work and my social life. But none of it matters at all.   I was once so suicidally depressed (it was the combination of many issues I still fight with) I had to be hospitalized for three months and real help only appeared three days before I got discharged.  I was in a position to learn that we are all trying to function on truths about the world we decide are absolute in the ages from 3 months - 4 years of age, a time in our lives when we understand the least possible about anything. But we go our whole lives without challenging these mistaken beliefs and in turn it causes distorted thinking, where we think we are correct about something and aren't aware where our logic fails. I know that sounds unrelated to the things you're going through, but just stick with me, it'll make sense later.  The next step after learning this was putting it to use in my life.  For example: I was convinced everything about me was the reason why bad things happen to or around me. I thought a truth of the world was I had so many socially unacceptable qualities, I made life itself bad for myself and others. I lived to the age of 25 thinking that way. I had borderline eating disorders, was compelled to wash myself with household cleaning products, and to me worst of all, I self harmed in the sake of punishing myself for making other unhappy with my appearance and abilities.  After learning this was a terrifying illusion and nothing more, I challenged the very idea: did nothing good or related to good feelings happen around or to me really?  I realized, I laugh and make other people laugh. I could taste the most wonderful things and music is so beautiful I get goosebumps.  I draw sometimes and it always makes me so happy.  So no, this mistaken belief was completely false. I've applied this to just about everything I felt may be wrong with my system of thinking; there is a test to help you figure out what you need to correct.  It is hard to fight what I thought was reality, but when you shoot down something like personal negative body image it's like winning the war against bodyshame for good, for everyone is possible (really!) and now you know it.  I'm telling you this because I was girl in elementary school who wore the same outfit everyday just in different colors and only wore one hairstyle. I was bullied at home, at school, anywhere other people could see me. I was the girl who didn't go to prom or any other dances, I did not go clubbing in college and I did not get ""asked out"". I was that lady at the beach swimming in shorts down to her knees and a XXXL men's t-shirt. Although I met someone who genuinely cares about me and finds me attractive, I was also the lady constantly around people who made her feel awful about herself.  Now I'm the lady wearing leggings with bright comic book print all over. I'm also the lady with the spagetti strap camisole and pink lipstick that someone is making snide comments about while another is thinking, ""She looks like she doesn't even care what anyone thinks."" I do yoga and pilates, even though I don't move and feel like the people in youtube videos, I feel good. I have stopped trying to get away from myself and started fully accepting her. When my tummy giggles, I put my hands on it and feel how soft and warm I am. When my butt hangs off a seat a bit I accept this world is to small for me, because I'm just existing as me and there's nothing wrong with that.I just bought a second bikini and I don't give two hoots if someone doesn't wanna see me in it. I'm not wearing it for them, I'm wearing it for me.  I would really like to help if you think this kind of change in thinking and processing how other people see you can help you, I feel so much better that I want other people to feel better as well.   I'm really quite shy and wary. I don't want to get to personal if you don't really want me to. I've only just started using social media to reach out to other people I can help feel positive and for support myself, so I don't know a lot about communicating. But if you feel like learning about mistaken beliefs and distorted thinking and learning to drop society's hang up with how you look, don't be afraid to message me for some info about this stuff."
BodyAcceptance,39doot,MsPhyre,6,Thu Jun 11 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"Fuck all those people.  There are a million other things infinitely more important than looks. I know that our society places looks on a pedestal, and I know that it matters, but everything else matters, too. Having a sense of humor, being intelligent, approaching the world with your chin up... Being a good person on the inside and putting it out into the world is something people notice. Showing that there is so much more to you (and to all of us) than our looks.  There will always be people who immediately will write you off, because they're ass holes. And there will always be people who will take the time to get to know you, and that is when your true value shines.  If you truly believe you are ugly, and you don't think you can ever change that view of yourself, then focus on what you can change. What makes you feel good? What are you proud of? Do more of that. If you don't have those things, find them. Explore every day.  You are not worthless, no matter what you look like. Society is shitty, but there are good people out there."

Looks are superficial, will fade and don't make anyone a nice person to be around. It's about self confidence, treating others well, and liking who you are as a person. Of the people I know, they have found successful relationships with people who share that interests.    My Aunty, who was very obese due to eating disorder/depression, was always a sunny positive light in my life. I watched her get bullied in public and her response was always ""I may be fat, but I can lose weight. They will always be ugly."" The people insulting you are ugly on the inside with no manners or respect and their actions are not worth your attention.   You are worth something and there is a place for you in this world. Start looking for your place, because there are people out there who will accept you for the kind well spoken person you are. Sometimes it just takes a little longer to get there."

BodyAcceptance,39doot,Anbaheni,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:03:35 2015 UTC,"This may not be a popular response, but it's a realistic one.   Your physical appearance, while nowhere near as ""bad"" as it can get, will probably never be perceived as beautiful by society's standards.  You know and accept this. And, honest to god, that's a blessing because now you can look for alternative methods to achieve what you want.  You don't like how you look. Your options are to either have it surgically altered in another country for cheap (South Korea and China comes to mind) or find ways around it.  Men don't show you positive attention. Have you considered maybe it's the vibe you're giving off? I'm not doubting your truth, I'm genuinely wondering if maybe your self consciousness is interpreted as rudeness/standoffishness? Because I'm extremely shy with strong facial features and rarely smile, and 95% of people I know thought I was a bitch until they got to know me a LOT better. If that isn't the case for you then have you considered other methods to attain what you want?  If you don't believe a romantic and sexual relationship with a man IRL is possible then maybe separate the two. Look for sex on Tinder or other one-night-stand apps/websites. You can have a romantic relationship with someone online for emotional intimacy.  Or if you can't have one without the other maybe, if you're willing, you could look within the fetish community for someone who has a fetish for women that have your physical appearance. I'm positive one or more of your attributes meet the criteria for a fetish out there. There's probably a man out there right now who fantasizes about a woman with ""male jaw and brow"" and loose skin from rapid weight loss.  Honestly, you don't sound ugly to me. You don't sound beautiful, but nowhere near hideous or ugly. There are burn victims, 20+yr olds with an 80+yr old's face, severe cystic acne sufferers, people with missing limbs, people still severely obese, I can think of a million things worse than what you're describing and these people still find love and happiness.   I guess what I'm trying to say is, woman up. You may not be beautiful or perfect, but how many of us are?"

BodyAcceptance,39cxwg,showmethebiggirls,2,Mon Jun 15 13:39:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  But I think the culture and expectations of a community shape what's permissible.  All those people on FPH saw everyone else being so awful and negative, and it gave them license to do the same.  Not only that, it gave them license to think that way.  It's possible to affect how people think by changing the culture they're in.  Peer pressure can be used for good."

BodyAcceptance,39cxwg,showmethebiggirls,-1,Thu Jun 11 07:43:38 2015 UTC,"FWIW, it wasn't because of the fat shaming itself. It was because they were going outside of their subred and outside of Reddit to harass people.   Which I can understand. Freedom of speech is vital and people are free to be assholes if they want to be. But inflicting their assholes on others... no."
BodyAcceptance,39cxwg,grumpycateight,8,Thu Jun 11 11:04:37 2015 UTC,"That's their offical reasoning, but every new subreddit that was created afterwards was immediately deleted.  Those weren't responsible for any user harassment.  They got rid of the fat-shaming subs because they were getting big and it looked bad on their business brochures."
BodyAcceptance,39cxwg,Jiro_Jiro,2,Wed Jun 10 23:06:44 2015 UTC,"Plus if I'm not mistaken they targeted Imgur admins, and they are partners of Reddit. I think that escalated it a lot."
BodyAcceptance,39cxwg,1v1atbotlane,5,Wed Jun 10 23:08:01 2015 UTC,You are correct. Tess Holliday was one of the people in contact with Reddit admins about the outside abuse/stalking/harassing that was linked to that sub.

BodyAcceptance,38tipg,oculus_caesius,3,Sat Jun 6 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"Are you me? Just a little shorter and younger haha.   I've been suffering from digestive troubles and no official diagnosis blah blah no fun etc. It messes with my weight and now I'm learning to keep eating even when I'm feeling bad I'm getting to a ""healthy weight"" and its pretty scary. I'm not exactly sure how to get rid of all the fear etc but here are my thoughts.   I think with an illness like we have its pretty ""invisible"" and that can feel difficult as we know we are unwell but nobody else does. Even doctors sometimes don't take us seriously. Being underweight or ""skinny"" means that maybe we actually look sick!   I know maybe it's silly but I definitely sometimes wish that people would acknowledge that I'm not well. I want people to fuss over me and write me a get well soon card, like if I had any other, more well known, visible illness. And being skinny means that's more likely to happen. People might actually care for once. At least that's what my mind says. I want my outward body to reflect what I feel on the inside.   But unfortunately it just cant work like that. At my thinnest, which happened in the middle of a huge flare up, I was accused of being ""anorexic"" by people who don't care about mental illness at all. It was just a slur to them. Nobody actually cared more for me when I looked sick...except myself. I feel a weird sense of pride in looking as sick as I feel. But that's only me.   All we are doing by resisting being a good weight is harming ourselves. With the problems we have...we kinda have to take our health in our own hands a bit. We need the nutrients and muscle etc to help heal our stomachs. Not eating right really doesn't help! The most we can do is take care of ourselves to the best of our abilities. Understand that it's ok to gain weight. We want to be healthy. And being able to eat what food we like is part of that."
BodyAcceptance,38tipg,dibblah,2,Sun Jun 7 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"Whoooah.  Sidebar.  This should not be the most upvoted response, it's actually really bad advice."
BodyAcceptance,38tipg,amelaine_,2,Sun Jun 7 09:43:17 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation.  Up until I was about 20 I was always very skinny.  I think around then I was about 5'11"" and 130lbs.  After I got a car, sedentary job, and could afford all the junk food I wanted, I started packing on weight for the first time in my life.  I got up to about 165lbs, still in the healthy range, but it was all fat and I was really unhappy with how I looked.  For me, exercise worked wonders.  I started going the gym regularly and eventually took up gymnastics when I was 22.  It helped me shift my focus from how I looked to what my body could do.  Gymnastics is really taxing so I cleaned up my diet to better facilitate healing.  This was nice because again, it wasn't about how I looked, it was about being healthy enough to throw backflips and walk on my hands.    After a few years of adjusting my exercise and diet to fit my new lifestyle I discovered that I was happy with what I saw in the mirror.  It was the product of my hard work.  I craved fruit and veggies over candies and cokes.  I still enjoy Arizonas or Red Bulls every now and then but they're treats and I don't feel at all guilty.  Try finding some kind of exercise that you really enjoy and set aside a few hours a week to train and practice.  You'll probably discover you're capable of a lot more than you thought and the feeling of accomplishment is divine."

I recently modeled with a girl who has alopecia. Even with no wig or makeup, she's empirically beautiful.  For her part, having alopecia is actually an asset of sorts; she can completely change her look readily and easily any time she wants. Beauty can be anything, and even the most beautiful people often feel as you do, as all people do. Somewhere out there, probably not even that far, there are people who will absolutely love you for you and be all about your look.  That said, if nobrows is getting you down, all of us lovely people over at /r/makeupaddiction will ecstatically help you get brows on fleek for your down days. The awesome thing about makeup is that you can wear it all the time or take it off whenever you want, and it can be anything you want it to be.  You might figure out the  faux brow game, try it for a while, and then find that you feel LESS like yourself, and that's totally fine too."

Correct me if I'm wrong, but is this Alopecia? I ask because I know another guy and a woman who both have Alopecia and your story sounds quite similar. The woman paints on her brows daily with  makeup, but the man rocks a cue ball with no brows and looks really cool! He tried a wig but couldn't find one that was comfortable or suited him, and is lucky to have a good head shape.   I hope that hearing of others' hair loss and how they are not only surviving with it, but thriving can be relatable and comforting. As you grow and mature, I hope you have more and more of those good days where you accept yourself for your flaws AND all the wonderful things that sometimes feel stuck in the shadows of those flaws. I know I struggle with that in other ways myself, it is a daily challenge that everybody faces: to love themselves."
BodyAcceptance,38ort8,rosieco,2,Fri Jun 5 17:52:37 2015 UTC,"I hypothesize that the reason summers are harder for you is that you have more free time, and thus more time for your mind to wander. As Catullus wrote, leisure is troublesome, it's painful. Keep busy, and you'll have less time to fixate on your perceived inadequacies.  Also - focus on the good and positive, as you do towards the end of your post. It sounds like you have many positive attributes, vastly outweighing any perceived negatives that come with the alopecia (which, for what it's worth, is not a big deal in the slightest). It also helps to laugh. Have you watched arrested development? They have a character on it with alopecia, and while yes he's the butt of many jokes, you may find it healing and alleviating to laugh about it. Also - the jokes are typically to illustrate the vanity and general insanity of the other characters. Finally I'd point you towards a Peter Gabriel song - Darkness - that illustrates this point of laughing at our fears perfectly, and has often been a source of comfort for me: ""walking through the undergrowth, to the house in the woods  the deeper I go, the darker it gets  i peer through the window  knock at the door  and the monster i was so afraid of  lies curled up on the floor  is curled up on the floor just like a baby boy i cry until i laugh"" Obviously this is easier said than done, as is anything worthwhile in life. You're also only 19, so don't fret if it doesn't come immediately. But be strong, and keep positive."

BodyAcceptance,38ny7v,Notfatty,2,Fri Jun 5 13:11:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think any part of your story is unrelated to any other part, and compartmentalizing these issues might hinder your self-understanding and acceptance.   In my uninformed opinion, anxiety seems to be at the heart of all of this, from what you've written. As well as some obsessive characteristics. I have both of these to a degree, although weight isn't my main focus.  If you don't want to do therapy, would you be OK with trying meds? I hate the whole idea of it, but Zoloft has allowed me a whole new perspective on things and allowed me to understand my motivations and triggers more than I could have when I'm ""in it.""   For you it's a couple pounds, for me it's other things, but the problem is the same: thinking that anybody cares or even notices in the first place. It's a sort of self-defeating self-centeredness. I'm making assumptions, but the comment about being afraid to go out in public stuck me.  Take it from someone with physical problems who frequestly has to be in public although I quite literally look like I'm dying, people don't notice at all, and even if they did they wouldn't give it a second thought, and even if they did care it would be out of compassion, not judgement.  If I could give you an over the top prescription: Get out of your head. Go volunteer, go help people, go see what ""real"" problems look like. Forget about yourself if only for a minute.  Throw away your scale. Go camping for a week, no mirrors. Just be a human animal without worrying all the BS that society has imprinted on your psyche like a cancer, it serves no purpose whatsoever.  Basically, stop giving a fuck about what other people think, and just be yourself. Waaay easier said than done, obviously, but a worthy goal.  Try to shut down these spiraling thoughts before they get started. I mean really give them a healthy ""fuck off"" in your brain. Takes practice but works.   If your boyfriend is not a shithead, you don't need to worry about him. Actually, if he is a shithead then good riddance and you don't have to worry about him anyways. You need to clue him in at least a little bit on this struggle if you haven't. Really.   And for some tough love from someone who truly has a jacked up body: Deal with it. It's the only one you'll ever get, as far as I know. And in 40 years all our bodies are going to be piles of dog shit. But who cares? As long as it will do the things you need it to and get you where you want to go, you're already blessed. It seems to me your main problem is anxiety/OCD, if it weren't your weight I imagine it would be something else that you're fixated on. Look into CBD if you didn't already learn that stuff in therapy. You are the only you around, no other person on this earth knows how to you better than you do. So get on with it!  All of that said, I'm in no position to give advice, so take it lightly."

I think I do have a personality in which anxiety/OCD-like behavior is pretty present, though I'm also sure it's not pathological. Nonetheless, it can still interfere with stuff. I'm not really keen on going on meds for this and think I would rather see a therapist again if I had to choose. Thank you for the idea though, it may be something to look at in the future. I'm sorry for what you're going through, I cannot imagine how hard that must be. Your tough love is hardly tough, more a reality-check of how blessed I am to look ""regular"" in pretty much every way. Thank you for that. I like the idea of keeping myself busy with something outside normal live (camping, volunteering). I had volunteered at a psychiatric institution for nine months last year and it really did make me see how lucky I am.. those people in remission really envied my normal life.

BodyAcceptance,38ny7v,Legal_Fiction,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:24:36 2015 UTC,"Sometimes focusing on your body and directing hatred towards it is a mask for other anxieties you are having. Do you tend to obsess more about hating your body when other life events are triggering your anxiety? If so, maybe you really are okay with being at the weight you're at, but you're nitpicking your body as an outlet for anxieties about things or situations you don't have as much direct control over. Next time you beat yourself up about your body image, ask yourself if there is something else you're truly upset about and if the self-criticism is a substitute for addressing the real anxiety head-on.   Also, hugs. And a reality check: nobody but you (including your boyfriend) is likely to notice + or - a few pounds. Really. People don't pay attention as much as you think they do, and a few pounds in either direction is likelier to be water weight than fat over such a short period of time. You are okay. You will be okay. Be kind to yourself."
BodyAcceptance,38ny7v,Legal_Fiction,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:37:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your comment, I really appreciate it. And thank you for the kind words, too. I do believe that I am satisfied with my weight in my heart, but for some reason I can't seem to be okay with myself being okay with it, so I'm in a constant battle with myself. There is always a body better, more toned, and when I gain (a little) weight I go nuts. Beating myself up because I wasn't tough enough on myself to stop weight gain, because ""it's already bad as it is, don't make it worse"". While the other side of me feels like ""jesus, chill, it's FINE"". As I'm typing this now I'm typing and deleting it again and while it sounds so logical in my head, typing it out makes it seem ridiculous. I do believe some other anxieties might be at play because I do notice an increase in obsessive behavior when I'm not feeling good about something --> leading to emotional eating --> worsening that bad feeling. Thanks again for the comment, I'll take it to heart and see if I find a real pattern."

BodyAcceptance,38ny7v,PlaidCoat,0,Fri Jun 5 22:26:41 2015 UTC,"Learning to like yourself is a process. It takes time to change the way you think about things, and while it's hard to have that kind of patience, it can happen.  Please don't think this is something you have to do on your own. You don't have to go back into intensive therapy, but a few sessions to talk with someone about this might help.  If you're still in school, a counselor might be available, and if you're working, many businesses have programs that allow very short term therapy (typically 2-3 sessions) at no or little cost.  Lastly, any bf that would break up with you over 5 lbs isn't someone you want to keep around, anyway. While I understand that people have their own tastes, someone who cares about that small of a weight change isn't worth your time.  However, I suspect that he doesn't notice at all; most SOs value their partner for more than just their body."

I feel I can either 1) continue to complain and feel awful about myself or 2) concentrate on fitness & diet, in an attempt to get back to where I was when I first met my fiancé.  Another bit of advice? Perhaps you could find some sort of hobby (or even volunteering activity?) that will make you feel good about yourself, but that has absolutely nothing to do with your appearance. For example, painting or music or helping at an animal shelter. You'll walk away from those experiences feeling like you've done something meaningful and productive, and that will gradually impact your mood in a positive way."

I do crafts and clean the house, I'm currently working on wedding things so I do feel productive about that. I feel awesome everyday that I eat right and go to the gym, I know I just have to keep that up. But even if I do lose the weight, who says I won't gain it back someday in the future?

You don't have to worry what you're going to do tomorrow, or next week, or next month. Don't think in terms of having to lose 40 pounds or achieving full confidence in yourself. Think in terms of right now and things you can control in the moment.  Maybe go outside and spend 10 minutes pulling weeds in the garden. Maybe take a walk around the neighborhood. Maybe fix yourself a healthy meal. Think at this scale. What can I do right now, today?  Trust me, it gets better (not necessarily easier, but it gets better)."
BodyAcceptance,38cxxk,SirCharlesV,2,Wed Jun 3 18:50:23 2015 UTC,"Therapy takes time and work, but it will help you. I recommend starting an exercise routine - not necessarily to lose the weight, but it will get you up and doing something which can really help a person to feel better about themselves. I have severe depression and anxiety so I go for 40-minute walks 3-4 days a week, sometimes more. It's peaceful, meditative, energizing, and it helps my heart to be stronger. It also releases endorphins which help to improve mood. I personally have to smoke marijuana before I walk because of the anxiety and full-body aches (the aches are probably because I'm out of shape, but I'm not sure), and I have to have my dog with me (to control the anxiety), but I've made it work for me until I can start running or find somewhere to get back into swimming.  You don't have to walk/run, either. Any kind of physical activity can have the same effect. If walking is too slow/boring for you, there's a world of choices out there for you to try. You might even find something that you and your fiance' can do together.  As for the way he responds to you, he may be reacting to the change in your self confidence. People often react to changes like that without really realizing that they're doing it, or if they do realize it they may not know how to deal with it. Keep talking to him, and keep up with your therapy.  You got this."

At first I was concerned about her weight gain because I thought it was because she was depressed or was having health problems, but our lives changed a lot and she started eating more due to stress. It bothered me for a while to see her heavier, but as our relationship grew stronger, I began to love her more and more. Now I don't notice it. I love her body and think it's beautiful because I love her entire being. If she wants to lose weight, that's her decision. Whenever she starts hating on her body, I remind her that she's still beautiful and that negative thoughts lead to negative behavior. We make meal choices and exercise together now, and I think it helps us bond. If your spouse loves you, he'll learn to or always love your body, regardless of what shape or size it is. Try working together with him about making healthier choices, exercising, cooking together, shopping together. If you're both striving to make better lifestyle choices, it might help strengthen your relationship and love."

My so also has body issues, they started balding when they were 20, and had been overweight as a young child as well as had a stutter. Even though they know I love them,this person has lost about 75 pounds and still shows signs of lowered self esteem and a negative body image.  I'm not saying this will fix everything but, I think a good thing you can do is encourage her to do things that are considered good for you and feel good with you. Like making smoothies or following a recipe for dinner and trying yoga together and to be honest just hugging. I do stuff like this for the both of us, to make them and myself feel better.  She may need to hear someone say, ""We can be happy with our bodies, lives, feelings and whatever else now, not after weightloss or looking the way we think we should look, but now."" When I talk like this my person doesn't really say anything back, but when I suggest trying a new food or something they're always kinda onboard.   Constantly remind her, that you love everything about her, everything. She may be having trouble understanding that fat is not a feeling or quality, it is a part of physical bodies, without any fat at all the body wouldn't be what it is. She's gonna need to be ok with what she likes about herself before she's ok with what she doesn't like about herself. Look for stuff online to talk to her about challenging the idea that fat is bad or makes you bad.  Also apply this stuff to how you feel about your body, and tell her when your challenging bad feelings about yourself, talk to her about how you felt after trying something you thought you couldn't do. Even if she doesn't talk to you about what she thinks of it. Or tries to avoid the changes you make. She may be inspired by the example you set or she may not. If she notices the change and wants it for herself she'll find away to get info she needs. These are just some random thoughts. If anything sounds like it may help try it out, if it sounds like it may make her shy away talk about it a bit and take it slow, everyone is kinda scared of new things."

Basically lots and lots of compliments - random and general ones about all sorts of things (eg. her hands are really cute, her face is adorable, you love how your heights are so compatible, her hair is soft). Also her feelings toward herself are very upsetting and trying to talk to her about her issues may also make her anxious - that may be a reason she shuts down when you try to talk to her.

I used to have this rule in my head, ""I have a great figure, therefore I should always make sure that I wear clothes that show it off and not hide it.""    It bothers me that some of the messages about body acceptance seem to include the notion that you are sexy and fierce and ready to take on the world!!!  It's nice but I can't keep it up 24/7.  I consider sex to be an intimate thing between my partner and I.  I don't want to feel sexy or even beautiful 24/7.  Sometimes I want to feel productive, or messy, or outside, or walking my dog.  None of these activities involve sex, so it would make sense that I would want to feel neutral about my appearance.    To me, body acceptance also includes ""preference acceptance"" -- to be open and kind to your preferences about how you want to live your life.  To treat your soul and personality with the same loving talk as you would your body."

It was something I read about on tumblr, I think?) who did a similar experiment on herself to see if she could learn to be less ashamed of her body by using the exposure effect.

BodyAcceptance,37bfhg,Kubrick_Fan,-1,Tue May 26 11:43:55 2015 UTC,"I think the reasoning for the dad bod thing being sexist is well articulated by this quote:   While the ladies have to go to Pilates and watch every single calorie, guys are free to let themselves get lazy, chow down on all the chips and guac they want, and still expect their prospective mates to be fit.   The most accessible example I can thing of is Family Guy, which tries to riff on the classic sitcom setup of a bumbling, chubby guy with a hot wife. The dad bod thing is sexist because it reinforces stereotypes and cultural expectations about gendered bodies. It is bad both ways, whether it is directed at men or women. Though there are some things promoting body acceptance for women I would not consider them mainstream (tumblr blogs and a few dove commercials =/= mainstream). Unfortunately one response to the objectification of women has been increasing objectification of men, which helps no one.   And then there is this bit, which articulates all the things that I really dislike about the dad bod ""trend"":   So the Dad Bod actually isn’t about liking the guy’s actual body; it’s more about how his body makes the woman feel. Not only is this incredibly selfish, but it also assumes that the Dad Bod actually looks bad thereby making the woman look better. While her argument seems to support men accepting a body that isn’t sculpted by constant hours in the gym, it’s actually doing the opposite."
BodyAcceptance,37bfhg,gijitgajit,12,Tue May 26 14:13:36 2015 UTC,"While the ladies have to go to Pilates and watch every single calorie, guys are free to let themselves get lazy, chow down on all the chips and guac they want, and still expect their prospective mates to be fit.   Not sure if you've ever been over to /r/fatpeoplehate, but this is exactly what they say about female body acceptance.  You're characterizing male body acceptance the exact same way they characterize it for women.  Supporting body acceptance for men is NOT the same thing as demanding the status quo for women.  You're basically putting it down because you feel like we have to focus on women more and first.  The entire dad-bod fad was started by girls openly discussing what they find sexually attractive.  They wrote an article and it turns out a lot of other women feel the same way.  Now this guy is saying it's wrong for women to feel like this because he thinks they aren't doing it for the right reasons and ""oh, it's actually internalized misogny for women to want to feel smaller, prettier, and more feminine compared to their partner.""    It's just another one of these articles where people complain about women making their own choices if they aren't choosing the things far left feminists think they should.  It's semantic nonsense that's designed to inject sexism where there is none and demonize women who don't follow their own ideology."
BodyAcceptance,37bfhg,Jiro_Jiro,3,Tue May 26 14:35:09 2015 UTC,"You quoted me quoting the article, and I get the feeling you wanted me to say something that I did not. I'm trying to talk about the cultural dynamic being discussed in the article. I'm not a fan of fat people hate and I'm on this sub because I like body acceptance. People should be allowed to be who they are, how they want to be, and not be shamed for it. If you want to go to the gym all the time, good for you. If you like chips and ice cream all day, every day, good for you. If you are doing any of these things because other people have made you feel bad about your body I think that sucks and I wish you felt better about yourself.  The same with who you are sexually attracted to. If you only like skinny guys then that's what you like, if you only like fat guys then that is what you like. If you only date skinny guys but are actually attracted to fat guys and are ashamed to admit it, that's shitty and I wish you felt better about your preferences. I expect that this was part of the point of the original dad bod piece, but I haven't felt like reading it.    Here is the article quoting the original article (this is getting meta):   Just look at Pearson’s reasons why she loves a guy with a Dad Bod. “We don’t want a guy that makes us feel insecure about our body,” she writes. “We are insecure enough as it is. We don’t need a perfectly sculpted guy standing next to us to make us feel worse.” She accepts that women have a harder time than men when it comes to body-image issues, but she also uses guys as a prop to make women feel better.   The point is that the dad bod is appealing to some women, like the author of the original piece, because it is culturally unattractive and the juxtaposition makes these women feel more attractive. Being in a relationship because you think the other person is unattractive and makes you look better is not a great reason to be in a relationship, and your partner will probably not enjoy it unless they are a special kind of masochist. This reinforces a cultural attitude about people acting out their gender appropriately and following the script where guys are not supposed to care about their appearance and women are supposed to be overly critical of their appearance. This is stupid, and I think that it makes men uncomfortable when they do start to care about their appearance. When you start talking about cultural expectations about gender performance then you are getting into feminist territory, whether you are talking about men or women."
BodyAcceptance,37bfhg,gijitgajit,2,Tue May 26 15:28:44 2015 UTC,"I think if women are attracted to the dad bod but if men dont like mom bod its not sexist is just what people are attracted to, by attacking that your not attacking beauty standards as much as you are what people are attracted to."
BodyAcceptance,37bfhg,chooseyboots,1 point,Tue May 26 16:04:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the text wall. I have free time and resources at hand.  This article by Walsh, et al.  is the basis for the point I made about Family Guy. The part that really gets to the point begins on p. 3. I think it is interesting to consider that though Peter is a loser, he is still very often the focal point of the show. His narrative is valued in spite of his physical, mental, and behavioral failings. Lois stays with him, in spite of these things, and it is apparent that she loves him, so he is acceptable as he is. On the other hand, if you consider the presentation of Melissa McCarthy, Lena Dunham, or Rebel Wilson, they are not often given the same opportunity to find love and acceptance in spite of their failings.   Of course, these are comedies and fat is funny, whether you are female or male (ahem, Chris Farley). If we are going to talk about body acceptance, we need to talk about body acceptance for fat people, thin people, fit people, male gendered people, female gendered people, otherly gendered people, differently abled people, white people, black people, brown people, old people, babies, and people who identify as mythical creatures. It is not the oppression olympics and we do not need to battle over whose life experience is worse. Sure, feminists (both women and men, though mostly women) have been working against body shaming in the media for a while (third-wave feminism, with thanks to 1st and 2nd wave) and therefore women's body acceptance has made more strides than men's. That's ok, men working on this issue can learn from the experience of women and use the resources they have created. Organizations that once exclusively targeted women have also started to target men, and I think that this is fantastic. Eating disorders, considered a signal of unattainable cultural standards of weight, are about twice as common among women, though they are increasing among men. This is a big problem. So, what are we going to do about it?"
BodyAcceptance,37bfhg,gijitgajit,0,Thu May 28 10:56:13 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I should edit that first part and say ""for most."" If the standards of beauty are represented by what women see in fashion magazines and men see in fitness magazines, they are unattainable for most people. Not all women can be 5'9, weigh 120 lbs, be white with a deep tan, and have long blond hair and blue eyes and C cup boobs. Not all men can be white with a deep tan, 6'2 and 170 lbs with broad shoulders and perfect stubble but no chest hair and a chiseled jaw. We all know this. It is not just about what you eat or how much you exercise. Thus, body acceptance. Bodies are beautiful whether or not they meet these standards. I'm not opposed to health education, but I do not think that is sufficient.  To answer your second point, NEDA has this to say about eating disorders, and here is a quote:   Eating disorders are complex conditions that arise from a combination of long-standing behavioral, biological, emotional, psychological, interpersonal, and social factors. Scientists and researchers are still learning about the underlying causes of these emotionally and physically damaging conditions. We do know, however, about some of the general issues that can contribute to the development of eating disorders.    If you click the link there is information about the different factors that appear to influence the prevalence eating disorders."
BodyAcceptance,37bfhg,gijitgajit,-1,Tue May 26 17:32:48 2015 UTC,"there are already multiple body acceptance movements/idols aimed mostly at women which get more and more mainstream (dove, meghan trainor, haes, tess munster and a myriad of tumblr blogs) but they're overlooked and the writer makes it seem as if body acceptance for women doesn't exist.     And they are often treated as ""oh, and this.""     there isn't a recent standard set for men, action heroes, sculptures and underwear models have been muscular and lean since time in memorial.     Male action heroes have always been an obviously idealized archetype. Maybe when bits are very young they think ""I'm going to be He-Man when I grow up"", but when they become self aware enough, it is VERY obvious that it is a complete fantasy. Sculpture is using idealized forms to convey an idea, I don't know if that idea has ever really been "" this is the perfection you should strive for. And there has always been the TV show dad that looked rather average to balance out the chiseled underwear model where TV moms kind of resemble the underwear model.     it stereotypes fit and muscular men as vein, self obsessed and having no personality. remember that loving your body is okay people, unless you're conventionally attractive, then it's narcissism.   Didn't read the article, so I cannot comment on this.    But for me, I cannot recall a time when ""dadbod"" has ever been unacceptable. It is basically the t-shirt and jeans equivalent of male body types. And that is where the dichotomy of the sexual politics comes into play, it is celebrating something that has always been generally regarded as acceptable/normalized. I'm unaware of negative sigma attached to ""dadbod"" in the same way that it is attached to many other body types. No one is saying ""but he has a great personality."" I'd also add that body-type ideals for men tend to be self-imposed where as body-type ideals for women tend to be imposed by men."

BodyAcceptance,37ctnf,mizmoose,4,Wed May 27 22:51:26 2015 UTC,"My stance is that health is deeply personal. It's very important to me, but I'm not bothered by people who have different priorities as long as their behavior does not impact me directly. I think, however, that things do change to some degree when the issue is an addiction or mental illness because in that situation the behavior is not a choice but a compulsion.  I would hesitate, however, to equate ""morbidly obese"" with anorexic. Anorexia is an eating disorder. ""Morbid obesity"" is a description of size based on height and weight; it does not describe behavior or lifestyle. I think the more accurate terminology would either be to refer to eating disorders in a general sense or to include anorexia and binge eating disorder.  Trying to get help for someone who is ill does not go against the tenets of body acceptance; assuming that someone is sick or unhealthy because of the way they look does."
BodyAcceptance,37ctnf,atheologist,2,Thu May 28 21:09:44 2015 UTC,"I personally think that health is an important means, but should not be thought of as an end goal unto itself.  The purpose of life (to such a degree that there is such a thing) is not to just hang around being healthy. A more reasonable purpose would probably revolve around experiencing, learning, creating, relating, and improving things and lives. Health should should be thought of as a tool serving those goals, and prioritized accordingly."
BodyAcceptance,37ctnf,onan,1 point,Tue May 26 20:01:52 2015 UTC,"Society should accept people without regard to their health.   Individuals should also accept themselves including their health, disabilities,  body,  mind, etc.  An individual may seek to improve their health but that's a personal matter between them and their doctor.  And even with medical help and the best efforts, some aspects of health are not within the individuals control."

There are lots of disabled people who find love, it's more a matter of personality. But I reckon it's probably more difficult in the sense that you probably need to have a more awesome personality to ""get noticed"", although your life as a disabled is probably not as easy as somebody else's.   There are examples of famous people who became very successfull professionally and romantically. See this guy for example, who has a disability comparable to yours I guess. He's very successful and married.  Good luck!"

BodyAcceptance,36hj2a,bodyimageprobs,21,Tue May 19 12:58:12 2015 UTC,"I think you're really selling your boyfriend short.  Do you think that his attraction to you should be purely physical, and if it's not then that must mean that he has something wrong with him ('Low self esteem')?  That's not really fair to him.    You could be the hottest, fittest, most drop-dead gorgeous woman he's ever met, but do you really think that your physical perfection would cancel out the fact that you're constantly doubting his motives, criticizing your body, hiding your body, and expressing how 'disgusting' you are to him?  Is that negativity attractive?    Do you think that if you were thin enough that he would somehow overlook that daily negativity?  Is he really that shallow??  Do you want him to be that shallow??  You may not realize it, but this attitude wears on a person until they no longer want to even make an effort in the relationship at all.. it's so hard and frustrating to be constantly shut down at every turn.    I think you really need to start looking at this from his standpoint.  If you truly believe that he 'deserves better', then please just end the relationship.  However, if you don't actually believe this and are just experiencing negative intrusive thoughts and doubts- then you have got to just put an end to it.  You won't be able to end the actual thoughts (at first), but at least put an end to vocalizing them to him.  When he says you look good, say 'Thank you!'.  Period.  Not, 'Thank you, I know I look like shit, you're so sweet to try to make me feel better', and don't say 'No, I look so fat' etc etc.  Just accept his compliment as a gift.  You've basically been rejecting his gifts this entire time.. How do you think that makes him feel?    In his eyes, I'm sure he sees this as 'I'm never going to be good enough'.  He can never compliment you enough to fill that void you have.  He can never say the right thing to 'fix' the way you see yourself.  He loves you, and you seem determined to hate yourself.  How painful that has to be for him.    Please take the first step towards fixing this- Make a commitment.   You are putting an end to the negative commentary about your body.  Whether you believe him or not, when he says something nice to you, you accept it with a 'Thank you'.    Get into therapy.  I know you've tried it before and it hasn't helped.  Sometimes you have to shop around for a therapist that connects with you.  Sometimes you're simply not ready to accept that there are no easy fixes, and you will have to change habits (which is incredibly difficult if you've been in this thinking pattern for years).  Someone mentioned finding a therapist who uses cognitive behavioral therapy to focus on developing strategies to overcome this rut you're in.  I think that's a great idea.    Make some simple (very basic) lifestyle changes that are very easy to accommodate.  For example, download an app like 'My Plate' or 'My Fitness Pal'.  Focus on something super easy, like drinking more water every day.  Seriously, start small.  Log your water consumption until it's a daily habit to meet your water goal. Then move on to adding more fiber and protein.  Eventually you will get to where you're meeting healthy calorie goals. Find out your daily calorie requirements for your age/height/weight/activity level. Here is a calculator to get you started.  After you have some healthier eating habits, you can start a small daily fitness routine- I'm talking very small steps, such as a daily goal to walk around the block.  You will eventually form new habits.   I hope this helps."

I assume because you are talking about eating habits in your last point.  The rules, per the sidebar, state: No advocating diets. No telling anyone what they should eat. But they also say For the purposes of this space ""diet"" refers to a pattern of eating with the goal of weight loss or weight gain. Discussions of eating patterns for overall health or recovery from disordered eating are allowed.   Becuase you aren't dietary changes for advocating weight loss/gain  I am leaving the post up as is.   (This is more a note for whoever reported this than you)"
BodyAcceptance,36hj2a,RorschachBulldogs,2,Thu May 21 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely wasn't advocating dieting or getting her to start a weight loss program.  I meant more like, if you invest in yourself and your health, you'll start to become proud of your body and what it is capable of.  That's part of body acceptance (IMO).  She has to care about the body she has right now, before she makes any major decisions about dieting/exercise etc.  The focus should not be weight loss and 'being skinny', but simply developing an awareness of her body and what it needs to be healthy."
BodyAcceptance,36hj2a,TheShowIsNotTheShow,0,Thu May 21 17:07:38 2015 UTC,"I don't want his attraction to be purely physical, but ideally I would like it to be somewhat physical.  I can't help but feel like a big lump of lard next to him.  I feel like I tricked him into being with me somehow, and that it's my responsibility to remind him that he could do better if he wanted.  We're long distance right now, and that makes it even harder to think positively about my relationship.  I have to keep asking him ""do you miss me?"" because it really feels like he doesn't.  This is the fourth summer we've done the long distance thing so I really should be used to it, but I'm not.  Therapy isn't an option at this point.  I recently got on to Myfitnesspal and am trying to lose some weight (not sure if it should be 10 pounds or 50 pounds at this point).  I'll do my best to just grit my teeth and say thank you when he says something nice, though.  It just doesn't feel sincere."

Negativity is what is killing your relationship-- it's what can kill any relationship! Even if you can't afford therapy, you can make the cognitive shift to try or even to want to be less negative. To hope that you feel more positive, even if you have trouble actually following through on it right now.  You can do basic CBT exercises without a therapist to help yourself get into positive thinking patterns- and that starts with wanting to change your patterns. The next step is noticing them - journaling or keeping track of how often you have negative thoughts, and maybe even figuring out things that trigger them or cause you to feel and/or verbalize insecurity or negativity. Then, you can brainstorm positive behaviors to substitute, and reward yourself when you use those instead. This is just the long way of saying that little steps like saying ""thank you"" instead of ""that's so nice of you to say to a 'big lump of lard' "" really can add up, if you are conscious about it and give yourself applause for these accomplishments.  It will be hard. You can do it. The first step is wanting to change."

To put it more starkly, there are people that suffer horrible things in their life: burns, amputations, mutilations from explosives, etc. They find love. Humans will always find ways to love each other despite the meat-sacks we are all stuffed in, and the many varied levels of 'beauty' (whatever that is) that each possess. What kills love is negativity, hate, and yes, even self-hate.   Feeling as horrible about yourself as you seem to is no way to live, and I'm truly sorry for every time you tear yourself down. Accept that self-love can be a tough and radical act in this world, and tackle it head-on!

Well, it probably won't feel sincere for a while.  You aren't seeing yourself through his eyes.  This isn't his fault though.. and he's being punished for your intrusive thoughts.  If it makes you feel better about it, let him know that you're working on accepting compliments.  Tell him that you do appreciate when he tries, and that you see his efforts.  Tell him that you aren't doubting his sincerity, or accusing him of lying- but that you are just having such a hard time wrapping your head around the fact that he would actually see you in that way.  You have to do this, for both him and yourself.  It will get easier with time, you're breaking an ingrained habit!   I feel like I tricked him into being with me somehow, and that it's my responsibility to remind him that he could do better if he wanted.   Do you really believe that he's that dumb?  Like he somehow couldn't comprehend your physical attractiveness, unless you point it out to him often?  Everyone has physical flaws.  He's seen them all by now (I'm assuming).  He's a grown up and ultimately, it's totally up to him whether any of your physical flaws are dealbreakers.  If you being a size 8/10 is a dealbreaker for him ,well... I don't think that's much of a healthy relationship anyways, right?  You can't dwell on it though.  This is something that's out of your control 100%.     I recently got on to Myfitnesspal and am trying to lose some weight (not sure if it should be 10 pounds or 50 pounds at this point).   That's a really good start.  I would suggest starting out your goals very, very small.  If you jump into this head first without doing some research first, you might find it extremely overwhelming.  When I say start small, I mean basic education on nutrition.  Figure out how many calories your body burns daily (without adding in exercise).  This is your TDEE.  It varies depending on your age/height/weight/sex.  Learn how much water you need to drink daily.  How much added sugar you can eat/drink (added sugar means any sugar added artificially to anything- not including natural sugars in fruits etc.. 'fat free' labeled stuff usually has tons of added sugar to make up flavor).  Learn how much fiber you should be getting daily, and dietary sources for it.  Same with protein.  (I mentioned fiber and protein because they both help you feel full and can help with binge eating after feeling like you're 'starving' all day).  If you're really committed to making a change here, and getting to whatever healthy goal weight you have, you have got to realize that this is a huge lifestyle overhaul.  Your entire relationship with food will change.  You will have to accept your body as it is, and keep in mind that your goal is to be healthy, to treat your body well.. If you just want to 'be skinny', well.. it won't be a long lasting, permanent change.  Keep in mind, 'Accepting your body as it is' doesn't mean being complacent or letting everything go.  It means that you accept that your body has limitations, that it doesn't come out of a box looking like a barbie, and that you have to nourish and protect your body (not starve it, over work it or hate it).  You get what you put into it.     I have to keep asking him ""do you miss me?"" because it really feels like he doesn't.   This really isn't about him, and he will never be able to validate you enough times to make it seem sincere to you.  This is an issue you are having within your own mind.  At some point, you just have to accept what he says and stop questioning him.  Otherwise, no one is going to be happy.    Believe me, I understand what you're going through.   I've been there and done the same things.  It sucks, and I know you're suffering.  Ultimately, you're the only one who can fix it."

BodyAcceptance,36hj2a,iHave2Xs,2,Wed May 20 23:27:54 2015 UTC,"Hi. Talk to a doctor or dietician before jumping on the weight loss train. With body image issues, it can very quickly spiral into a way to cope and an eating disorder. Also...size 8-10 is NOT BIG. It depends entirely on your shape and structure. I wore size 8 at a very very dangerously low weight for me - my hip bones just need an eight. Don't use size or a number on a scale as judge. Use how you feel when you move around and a doctor's advice. I highly recommend visiting a therapist that specializes body issues if you can find one! Does your grad school have any programs or a mental health center? Mine has a program based on mindfulness as well as free counseling with a psychiatrist and dietician for students."

BodyAcceptance,36hj2a,gritgirlindc,5,Thu May 21 01:00:38 2015 UTC,"Seconding ""Feeling Good""- it's a great introduction to CBT. As well as pretty much everything else in this thread. You definitely need to learn to stop despising yourself, not just for your relationship, but for yourself.  I don't know if this technique I learned at a Wellness retreat will help you, but it definitely has helped me. I apologize for the length:   Start by reading back all of the things you've said about yourself in this post. Say them out loud. Imagine saying them to someone else...anyone else. Mom, sister, friend, boyfriend, Internet stranger... Picture that person and say those things to them. How do you feel saying those horrible things to a fellow human being? Who deserves to be told those terrible, degrading things?  NO ONE, that's who!! So why are you saying them to yourself? You know that old saying ""If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all?"" It applies to self-talk as well.  Now, how do you stop bashing yourself? The first step in this technique is awareness that that's what you're doing, and how much you're doing it. You need 3 things for this step: a notepad/notebook, a pen/pencil, and a box. Anything with a removable lid. A shoebox you've decorated to your liking works well for this.  For one week, carry that notepad and pen with you everywhere. Every time you think something negative about yourself, write it down. Every. Single. Time. At the end of the day, put those thoughts in the box. At the end of the week, take all of the notes out of the box (there will be A LOT!) and burn them. Literally. Watch those suckers go up in flame. It's a great feeling.  After that first week, the goal is to reduce the number of notes in the box. Believe me, you will want to do this if for no other reason than because writing them down gets REALLY old. So now, you are only allowed to dwell on those negative thoughts as you write them, and no longer. Once it's on the paper, the thought is done- it's going in the box to be burned. You are not going to let one negative thing spiral out into a million more like you have in the past. The way I accomplished this was to follow each note by saying (out loud or in my head) the following mantra: ""I accept myself as I am in this moment."" You don't have to say you love yourself or that you're a beautiful butterfly- just acknowledging that you are who you are and that's ok.   If that mantra doesn't work for you, there are a million websites full of mantra ideas. Pick one that feels honest to you.  Once you're comfortable with that, the next step is stopping a negative thought with your mantra before you even have to write it down. I've used this technique for about 18 months now, and there are weeks on end where nothing goes in the burn box. And my relationships with myself, my family, my friends, and my new boyfriend are SOOO much better because of it.  Hope that helps!"
BodyAcceptance,36hj2a,paulakloots,1 point,Wed May 20 05:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've heard of a couple of those techniques before.  I'd never say anything mean like this to anyone else, just myself.  I feel like I deserve it.    I could try the writing everything down.  It would be quite tiresome and take a lot of time, but I could."
BodyAcceptance,36hj2a,soberfun,4,Wed May 20 22:42:52 2015 UTC,"That's part of the point- the fact that it is so annoying to write down all of your negative thoughts encourages you to stop thinking them. Then you realize how good it feels to not abuse yourself all the time, which is further encouragement!  Because seriously... WTF? What about you is so terrible that you deserve to say things to yourself that you admit you wouldn't dare say to anyone else? This is rhetorical; no matter what any of us tell you, and apparently no matter what your loved ones say, you will believe these horrible things about yourself right now. So what you need to work on is changing how you view yourself. Because I'm gonna be frank with you- as a psychiatric nurse, I've worked with people who have done unspeakable things- attempted murder, rape, etc... And they don't beat themselves up half as much as you do."

The stores of theirs I've been to have both been very body-positive, friendly, and accepting, and the saleswomen are often plus-size themselves.  If you think about it, their core demographic is plus-size folks, so it's very much in their business interests to make sure their stores are welcoming and pleasant to us.   Best of luck!"
