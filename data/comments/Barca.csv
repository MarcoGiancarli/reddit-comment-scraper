Barca,3e20d7,Acquits,23,Tue Jul 21 10:05:41 2015 UTC,"I absolutely hope he stays as well - for the sake of the team.  But if I was him, I'm not sure I would.  He's won a great deal already and at 27 he doesn't have much time left to be a regular at a big club.  Again, I hope he stays.  But I would totally understand why someone at his level wouldn't want to spend 3/4 of the season on the bench..."
Barca,3e20d7,barcafor20,8,Tue Jul 21 13:57:32 2015 UTC,Pretty sure everyone does. He's a quality player and good for rotations but he's also one of our own. La Masia graduate that's won it all for Barca. Would be pretty disappointing to just let him go.
Barca,3e20d7,Kluey,4,Tue Jul 21 13:56:25 2015 UTC,"i hope too but only if he gets more play time , that means the ego of the front 3 to be reduced a bit,  i love all the  Barca players but countless times during the substitutions, they have shown some reactions that i really didnt like,constant mumbling  :(   last season there were many games in which the result was pretty much sealed during halftime, around 60 th minute i think he could have played , instead he was used as a scapegoat for only 10 -15 minutes when nobody was really interested about scoring or the game anymore, playing a more passive conservative style"
Barca,3e20d7,XsTream23,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair, unless Lucho assures him of increased rotation, I see him leaving. He's a competitor, and a damn good one at that, he deserves more time. As much as it pains me to admit it, Pedrito might just be better off in the EPL career-wise. Though I'm not crazy about him going to Man U. Their fans are already insufferable enough on r/soccer as it is..."

Barca,3e20d7,drunken_madman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:36 2015 UTC,"If he will be more happy going somewhere where he can start, by all means he should do it. I just don't think he will manage to secure a starting spot in a big foreign club. I see him faring similar to people like Negredo, Llorente or Soldado. People that had a role where they managed to shine, and with the transfer the expectations skyrocketted and when they didn't deliver in the first season they ended up either benched or coming back."
Barca,3e20d7,fuckin_in_the_bushes,2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:19 2015 UTC,I think the difference with the three you mentioned is that they left as stars of midsized clubs - unproven at the highest level.  Pedro has proven he can perform for the best team in the world and the national team.  I think he could make the switch to just about any big club and be an undisputed starter - a la Alexis at Arsenal
Barca,3e20d7,barcafor20,3,Tue Jul 21 19:07:37 2015 UTC,"I hope you are right. He has the tools to be a serviceable starter in just about any club, as long as they understand the kind of role he can play and don't expect things he can't deliver.  My fear is not so much for him not being good enough, but more that in big clubs, they expect their forwards to deliver in the form of a lot of goals and/or assists and Pedro isn't necessarily a guy that will score or assist a lot, but do both of those things and a lot more with a more than adequate consistency."
Barca,3e20d7,fuckin_in_the_bushes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:49:47 2015 UTC,Agreed with all of this except maybe the assists part - I think he'd get a lot of assists even if he has trouble scoring initially
Barca,3e49t7,Illegal_sal,3,Tue Jul 21 21:04:35 2015 UTC,"Looks phenomenal, we have so much attacking talent. It's sad to realize that much of it will never hit the first team, let alone play many games, him included. Especially if our buying patterns continue."
Barca,3e49t7,broad_h2o,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"We're a team that wants to win trophies, if the la masia products can't help us do that we have to buy players."
Barca,3e49t7,FrostyGrass,5,Tue Jul 21 22:45:57 2015 UTC,"I suppose I'm a purist in that sense, but I don't agree. If we don't rely on La Masia when times are bad, then it will not help us make them good.   Do you really want to have a policy similar to Madrid? Because in 5 years, if we use your theory, we will.   Edit: And by the way, I by no means believe that we shouldn't buy any players, I just think fair opportunity and an advantage to Masia players should be given, which it isn't and hasn't for a while."
Barca,3e49t7,broad_h2o,2,Tue Jul 21 22:52:58 2015 UTC,"In 5 years if we use my theory we won't. Real Madrid area team that buys the newest and brightest super star who would help not only their team but also their marketability, for example James Last year and selling Di Maria because he wasn't as popular anymore, also Bale the year before and Ronaldo in '09. Barcelona do not do that especially recently they bought players they needed, like for example this past summer the transfers were for players they needed, no la masia product could have done the job and because of that we spent money nothing wrong with that.  Ninja edit: I love La Masia and would love to have as many players from the academy in the first team but only if they are capable of playing for the first team while not sacrificing our attempts for trophies."
Barca,3e49t7,FrostyGrass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:59:12 2015 UTC,"Pogba would be an example of this type of signing. It seems almost a foregone conclusion that within a year he'll be a Barca player. Incredibly unnecessary, a flashy signing, doesn't fit the team. He blocks future midfield talent for years, that have actual chances of getting in the team and being a mainstay, Rafinha etc. If Pogba happens it's safe to assume similar signings will continue."
Barca,3e49t7,broad_h2o,2,Tue Jul 21 23:05:53 2015 UTC,"I'm only for Pogba if we need him. Currently our midfield would be top class even without Iniesta, Turan and Rakitic are some of the most talented midfielders in the world, we don't need to look for any new midfielders for a while. The next position we need to look, imo, is forwards but even that could be a ways off as Suarez is basically a cyborg and Messi is Messi. Overall my main argument is that I support spending to help the team achieve trophies, but never needless Galacticos signings."
Barca,3e49t7,FrostyGrass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:16:44 2015 UTC,Purist for what? We have always been a team that buys big players. I don't know why people have this idea that we've always fielded 11 la masia graduates. We're a special team in that we use both instead of focusing on one and falling behind. If a player from our academy wants to play for us he HAS to be good enough. He can't just get a pass if he's average just because he's one of ours.

Barca,3e2ljm,Illegal_sal,11,Tue Jul 21 13:58:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind keeping him as he's a very capable substitute for us, especially when we're slowing down the tempo as he doesn't usually make any killer plays. Maybe it'd be best to wait until Winter to get rid of him, however I don't see him getting many minutes at all anyway. I'd love to bring in Samper if he were to leave.  I think he'd do very well over there. He's a very capable player, unfortunately he doesn't have the brilliance that our other midfielders have to earn him a starting spot. I think he'd get a lot of time over there and will turn into a very consistent and important player."
Barca,3e2ljm,Marchisio,3,Tue Jul 21 14:36:37 2015 UTC,For some reason I feel like he has more to offer still.
Barca,3e2ljm,elanciano31,9,Tue Jul 21 15:30:34 2015 UTC,"I've been a fan since his debut with the first team, though he's lacked the confidence recently to play the way he did back then. (I remember shades of Iniesta a couple of years ago.)   I kinda do want him to leave for Everton though, I think getting more PT and working with a coach like Martinez could do wonders for him. Also opens up space for Samper, who should be a higher priority anyways.   I'll be rooting for him either way."
Barca,3e2ljm,roboto-sama,8,Tue Jul 21 16:12:38 2015 UTC,just reminds me of how everyone dismissed xavi for a pretty long time saying edgar davids was the one propping up the midfield.  I dunno probablyy confirmation bias on my part.

Barca,3e2ljm,HippoNigga,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:47 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see him get loaned out. His career has stopped in its tracks a bit, and playing more regularly in England might get it working again. If not, then he can sign for them permanently and we get some sweet cash."
Barca,3e2ljm,Mentosfruitcore,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:30 2015 UTC,"Of course many people will think this, but don't you ever stop and wonder why this hasn't happened yet? Do you not you think that the coaching staff and club see something that we don't?   I personally think that making it to the barca midfield is the hardest at a young age given the level of maturity and excellence we have come to expect in the last few years. I think if he is still there, it's because barca is developing something special and we will see it soon enough."

Barca,3e2ljm,jorsias,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:27:12 2015 UTC,"I'd sell him in a heartbeat. We have Samper who is already miles better. Roberto is extremely average, and he clearly doesn't have any future here."
Barca,3e2ljm,flackohowyoubeen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:31 2015 UTC,I don't get all the downvotes about selling la masía players. Some of them aren't good enough or could excel playing with other systems but not yours. I share your opinion he doesn't have anything special to offer
Barca,3e4ti2,flackohowyoubeen,3,Tue Jul 21 23:30:07 2015 UTC,"They have been interested in him in a long time, ever since they tried to convince him, Toral and Bellerin to join them. Toral and Bellerin went, but Samper stayed. Apparently he also refused a offer from them last year. There's no doubt Arsenal are willing to sign him, but I don't think Samper is keen on leaving. Yet.  Samper is extremely talented. He is a Pep, a Busquets, a Xavi. He is a genius, and a true culé. He has everything. But, as other Masia talents, there are rumours of them being worried about low chances of making it in the first team. Which I can understand, because no talents have gotten real trust in the past three seasons.  IMO, Enrique needs to step it up, and see what's right at his doorstep. Loaning Samper out, I think, is not the right road to take with this unique player. You can't have Sergi Roberto in your first team, while loaning this man out. Samper is good enough to be our second choice DM, but also, he is a man who can become a top class CM.  This needs to be tried out. We can't just loan him away to teams that play nothing like us. Staying with the first team, and slowly earning, and getting more and more games is the right road to go.   This is my take on the situation. He will stay, but he won't stay long if he doesn't get the treatment he deserves."

Garcia Pimienta is a coach who has been La Masia for years and he always plays good football; same view as other succesful La Masia coaches such as Oscar Garcia and Quique Alvarez. Apparently he was already told he got the job for main coach too, but in the end it was given to Gerard."

Barca,3e3fx7,noirlamp,9,Tue Jul 21 17:39:37 2015 UTC,"But those front three want to play every game. Messi won't get off the pitch if he doesn't want to, Neymar throws way too many tantrums and Suarez makes an extremely annoyed face on the bench. Lucho will need to be very ballzy if he wants to bench all three in the same game. Remember what happened when he benched just 2 of those 3?"
Barca,3e3fx7,potatoe96,3,Tue Jul 21 18:13:53 2015 UTC,"I think this may not be an accurate portrayal of Luis Enrique's thought process. Many (if not most) players will be unhappy to be subbed off, most players want to play all of every game.  I don't think a coach at Luis Enrique's level would let a player's objection to being subbed influence his decisions very much or even let it bother him.    I think this issue is the Real Sociedad/Pekerman effect -- if he rests Messi (or, to a lesser extent, Neymar and now Suárez) and Barcelona loses or does badly, he will have to deal with a world of hate -- maybe from the players themselves, I don't know.  Messi has said many times that to play or not the decision of his coaches, not him.  The thing is, I don't think that Luis Enrique knew how to play without Messi last season.   What other player can play the way he does and in that position?  I am not talking about Messi's skills per se, but his flexibility and how many different roles he can play.  Messi is a good player to have on the pitch because he has good instincts and can anticipate problems and he has a lot of different skills to solve them.  And then there is a more unsavory aspect that probably should not be ignored, that Luis Enrique is possibly pressured to play Messi as much as possible from a profit standpoint.  At this point, Messi is the brand of Barcelona and the reason many of the people come to Camp Nou in the first place.  How would you feel if you bought tickets months in advance to see Sir Ian McKellen play Falstaff and they show up to find some nobody (to you) playing the role that day? People pay the big bucks to see Messi and complain when they don't.  When the club is telling Luis Enrique, ""unless Messi is injured, play him in every minute of every game, or else we will find someone who will,"" what is he supposed to do?"

Barca,3e3fx7,Melobyrro,2,Tue Jul 21 21:43:03 2015 UTC,"Well, can't ignore that messi wants to play cause he wants to accumulate goals, specially against weaker competition...   I do not think this is Messi's mindset to be honest. He always wants to play, that's a given, and of course as a striker he always wants to score. But he seems to be more fired up against the bigger teams, not the smaller ones (even if the smaller ones end up with more of his goals in their net).  Sidenote: In the last 10-15 minutes of the game, when we are leading comfortably, I always want the ball at Messi's feet: he is, among all our players, the one who is most likely to want to make something happen (IMO). The others (particularly the starters), are usually tired and saving strength."

He wants to be top scorer, have the highest assists or whatever. He can't do that without playing every game possible. Neymar is the same. Suarez is the only one of those three who would be willing to sacrifice starting for the better of the team. This coming season we are gonna have 2 matches pretty much every week if I am not wrong. So in any case they are gonna be playing every week."

I guess you didn't hear about Xavi' speech to Messi after the match at the Anoeta.   You have to be really naive to think he doesn't care about individual awards. He may not care about them as much as team award but it's still in his mind.   As much as I also think it would help resting him, I don't see it happening."
Barca,3e3fx7,sunscomingup9,3,Tue Jul 21 18:52:08 2015 UTC,Messi never struck me as self interested. Are individual awards nice? Sure. But he himself said he'd choose team trophies over individual trophies countless times. You have to be quite cynical to not believe the best player that has ever graced the game.

Barca,3dzr60,tonytetova,4,Mon Jul 20 21:44:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, it will most likely be Gerard Lopez. Many people are not happy about this. Both Garcia Pimienta (who was promised the job) and Gabri Garcia (interim manager now) seems like more likable options."
Barca,3dzr60,bmeckel,5,Mon Jul 20 21:53:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. Could you elaborate more on these assigned officers?
Barca,3dzr60,daaldea,11,Mon Jul 20 21:33:17 2015 UTC,"Roberto Fernandez, former Barça player, has never been a sports director. Only a coach. Seems like a good guy. Time will tell if he's good enough.  Braida, Rexach, Soler? Sigh...  Pep Segura, former Barça B assistant, is a great addition. Did some nice work at the LFC Academy as their boss.   Roura and Altimira are nothing special, to be honest. Although they seem like a very hard and disciplined pair, which is good after some loose years under Amor and Puig, where players were spoiled. Not sure if they are technically qualified, though."

Barca,3dzqn0,flackohowyoubeen,35,Mon Jul 20 21:08:38 2015 UTC,"I really don't think Mathieu had that average of a season last year. The games he started I thought his performance was more than acceptable. Sure he's had a few ""oh shit"" moments but he was solid otherwise."
Barca,3dzqn0,daaldea,24,Mon Jul 20 21:44:03 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, he was very solid imo. People seem to forget very quickly. He was poor at LB especially that one game vs. Madrid, which is what people seem to remember the most, but as CB he was very good - and even managed to score two very important goals as well.  Whoscored.com for example, ranks his La Liga season at 7.29 vs Otamendi's (who had an incredible season) 7.56.   I also don't understand OP's critique on his passing and ""footballing intelligence"" as Mathieu's passing succesrate las season was 88.6% vs Piqué's 89.3% - and Mathieu had 2.4 interceptions pr. game vs. Piqué's 2.2.  I know it's not all about stats, but they can't be ignored either, Mathieu did great last season, and was definitely a piece in the puzzle of winning the treble."
Barca,3dzqn0,kezorN,5,Mon Jul 20 22:15:39 2015 UTC,"I agree that he was very solid, but I think the critique on his passing stems from those times Mathieu would pass the ball from defence while under pressure and it would go straight to the opposing player's feet. I see the stat you posted on his passing success rate, but those misplaced passes under pressure just seems to stand out for me and something I personally felt that he can improve on in his game.  And yes, he was a piece of the puzzle. Without his crucial goals we wouldn't win the league, etc."
Barca,3dzqn0,cdn_brcafan,2,Tue Jul 21 01:41:28 2015 UTC,"Everyone has ""oh shit"" moments, even Jefecito in the Copa final vs Chile. It's just that if it's a player we already dislike we tend to remember the fuck ups as they confirm our bias, but we forget the fuckups. For instance, I don't remember Mathieu scoring any own goals, and Alba had at least the one in Anoeta."
Barca,3dzqn0,jairzinho,15,Tue Jul 21 14:42:53 2015 UTC,"Would be a big error not to promote Grimaldo. Unfortunately, space looks to be the problem, and he is way too good to stay and play for Barça B.  Mathieu has a chronical heel problem, while Vermaelen is... Vermaelen. Who knows when he's out for another year."
Barca,3dzqn0,navidjaan,9,Mon Jul 20 21:18:07 2015 UTC,Mathieu is good enough to be our sub LB. Don't worry man.
Barca,3dzqn0,polechi33,4,Mon Jul 20 22:53:22 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see him playing in La Primera but he's not going to have much of a shout at Barca this season, even with Adriano on the way out.  A loan to a team like Rayo, Zaragoza or Celta could do him the world of good.   It's a tough one though as loans have not always worked out well for us but its the trade off between game time at the top tier and daily training with the best on offer. He is only 19 going on 20 so we really don't need to rush him in quite yet."
Barca,3dzqn0,ViscaBarca1899,3,Tue Jul 21 00:58:05 2015 UTC,"I would really like to see Lucho have some faith in Grimaldo, he's a very good player and it would be stupid in my opinion to play Mathieu there instead of developing our own talents"
Barca,3dzqn0,mattb10,3,Mon Jul 20 22:26:54 2015 UTC,"I don't like Mathieu as LB, but we have options for that position, be it Grimaldo or Vermaelen."
Barca,3dzqn0,IhateAngryBirds,2,Tue Jul 21 06:59:31 2015 UTC,"Would be a shame for Grimaldo to sit on the bench for a season at his age.  He needs to be playing every game.  I think the best choice overall for team and player would be to go out on loan (preferably to  a mid level spanish side).  Mathieu has certainly had a few shaky moments, but he is still fantastic cover and he did add a few important goals last season.  Grimaldo on loan."
Barca,3dzqn0,jarvistheplant,2,Tue Jul 21 00:04:51 2015 UTC,"I think Vidal could play there if needed.  He may not be as two-footed as Adriano, but I'm thinking (in comparison to Adriano) he makes up for that with pace"

At the left back position he did not look as good. His positioning offensively was very awkward. I think with some more training in playing LB in Barca's system he could be a decent backup, but I would rather someone else playing there. We also will have Vermaelen to try out in this position as well."
Barca,3dzqn0,bricebru22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:22:50 2015 UTC,"Alex Grimaldo will be in the first team at one point, he'll be a star. However, playing third fiddle to Alba, Verm or Mathieu he won't get a lot of minutes. I'd be happier if Samper, Halilovic and Grimaldo all went on loan to Primera teams and get to play a lot.   Rayo with Paco Jemez play a similar style to Barça, within their abilities of course, have a couple of ex-Masia players, Samper and Grimaldo would both be upgrades on their current players so they should be able to get in the team regularly.  Rakitic is talking up Sevilla to Halilovic, and it's likely he'll go on loan there."
Barca,3dzqn0,jairzinho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:52 2015 UTC,"I always liked him, put in some good performance on both the left and right for us. Wonder if his versatility went against him, as he never managed to nail down a position. Injuries probably didn't help either.  Will always remember him for this goal against Atletico: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4xGE_olvJ8  Would loved to have seen what he would have done if he'd managed to get more of a regular run in the team."
Barca,3dzqn0,ewankenobi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:23:31 2015 UTC,"Please sell Adriano. He was a massive liability last season imo. I never felt comfortable when he was on the pitch.  Promote Grimaldo.

Barca,3dy2kc,frasier_crane,3,Mon Jul 20 20:14:28 2015 UTC,It's still Barça. Plenty of superstars in our ranks that not having Messi or Neymar available shouldn't be a dealbreaker.

Neymar will grow up, I think, he already behaves better than we he first came."

If they don't bring Messi and Neymar, maybe next year the American sponsors will phone Florentino Perez to bring CR9 and Bale. Hopefully Messi and Neymar will rest and have a very good start, the first have of the season is crucial this year."

Barca,3dxxae,chordnine,7,Mon Jul 20 14:19:27 2015 UTC,"Not that sure about Abidal, I think that though he likes Laporta, he probably tagged along for his campaign because Joan was the only one offering him that job, one of the top jobs in the whole club, instead of an ambassador role.  Now that Laporta has lost, and honestly I don't see him ever going back to being our president now, (though I really hope the next president, in fucking 2021, will give Laporta the place he deserves in Barcelona history... Not an outcast like he has been made since 2010, but an important figure of Barcelonism.) so I think Abidal will at least consider the offer. But he has issues with Barto personally (the promise), so maybe he'll still flip him the bird.  For Puyol, I think being at Barca means more than being with Laporta to him, but he did have big issues with how Bartomeu made Zubi, his friend, the biggest culprit for all of their board's shortcomings.   However, Cruyff? Ha. Good fucking luck, he'll collaborate for his foundation, but he'll NEVER want anything to do with this board on a personal level, not only because he's a close friend to Laporta but also because he simply loathes their view of Barça.  By the way Barto, want to ""unite Barcelonismo""? Start by stopping the lawsuit against Laporta and apologizing for what you and Rosell did to him.   Until then, it will all be bullshit political moves with no meaning. You don't unite anything when you're suing a guy who, while he has flaws, still represents a huge chunk of the fanbase, 33% of the fanbase according to the elections, not counting those who preferred Benedito but still don't see the point in hating Laporta, and not counting those who can't be Socios because of your shit rules, either."

Barca,3dxxae,Mugiwara_Luffy,-5,Mon Jul 20 18:19:37 2015 UTC,Cruyff is a legend but he shouldn't have part in this club anymore. He had his time and all was great. He's the guy who said neymar wouldn't fit. That they would be to egotistic. Thanks to lucho he was able to tame him and Suarez.
Barca,3dxxae,beastcat,6,Mon Jul 20 16:32:13 2015 UTC,"Without Cruyff we would not be 10% of who and where we are today, we would not have our total football identity and style, or trophies. To say he should not have a part anymore is absurd. Such key influential figures should always be treated with respect and have a place in our club. Yes, he may have said some things like his views on neymar, but he wasn't wrong when he said that as it was based on his vast wealth of knowledge, and it worked mainly because of Lucho's ability to handle the dressing room, neymars humbleness, and Messi's willingness to share the spotlight which is extremely rare in superstars (look at how things are in madrid with ronaldo and bale).   We should do what it takes to have figures like Cruyff always part of our club for as long as we can. No Cruyff = no Barca of the last 10+ years, no la masia, no Pep (as coach or player)."
Barca,3dxxae,cdn_brcafan,0,Mon Jul 20 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget where we were with tata. Luis Enrique has as much credit in the modern game than anyone, Cyuyff or pep. He has shown his quality with our play, bringing back the form of messi, and nurturing ney and Suarez. And in his first season none the less! If you were talking about someone like LVG than I would understand. LVG is coaching in the modern game, Cruyff hasn't had a coaching hand for over a decade now.  He sure made us, our system, but with any system is has to adapt technically and with every player in the squad. With our success In the modern era, Luis Enrique had much to do with it."
Barca,3dxxae,beastcat,3,Tue Jul 21 06:56:47 2015 UTC,"Offcourse I agree on his importance, as any coach should be to the team unless we want to end up with another Tata situation as you point out. Not taking anything away from lucho at all. Lucho has Cruyffista views as well, as his coaching style does value holding onto the ball, with an integration of verticality.   Your right systems need to adapt based on the squad, etc. But the core system instilled from decades past still remains and should continue to remain. Which is where the importance of Cruyff comes. Not saying he should coach us. But advisor who we listen to, yes (i.e., honorary president role which he had previously). (Also, don't recall when he stopped but he did coach the Catalan national team recently for a brief period of time, just a side* point)."
Barca,3dxxae,cdn_brcafan,-3,Tue Jul 21 12:27:49 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing:  Is he wrong on some stuff? Yeah.  Should his word be law? No.  But when you get past all the posturing and ego, he still has a wealth and depth of knowledge on a lot of footballing issues and if he can be integrated in a useful way would be more of a benefit than a harm.

I bet you would have said the same back in summer of 2008 when the board was deciding between appointing Pep, a coach with zero experience, and Mourinho, the ""obvious"" choice to fix our broken team, but the board opted for Pep because of Cruyff's advice.  Its pathetic and embarrassing that you would talk so disrespectfully about one of the most important legends of our club. He doesn't ""bash"" the club as you say incorrectly. He points out the glaring problems of the current administration and rightfully so. His love for this club is more than the current board will ever have."

Barca,3dzftf,koobar,2,Mon Jul 20 20:13:31 2015 UTC,They are staying at the Ritz Carlton in Marina del Rey but you didn't hear that from me.
Barca,3dzftf,clamburgler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:07:28 2015 UTC,Im near there. Want to go see them but not sure how to approach it. will probably try aftsr the game tuesday night so i know for sure they are at the hotel. dont know their schedule during the day.
Barca,3dzftf,koobar,0,Tue Jul 21 09:18:17 2015 UTC,"I used to work at a Ritz so here are some tips: don't make it obvious that you are a fan. I wouldn't wear a jersey or look like you are waiting for them. Dress like you are staying at be hotel and hang out at the lobby bar. Occasionally step out the front doors like you are waiting on a friend to show up. See if you can overhear the doormen talking about their arrival. What happens is the bus driver will be in contact with the hotel about their location and ETA. That will be relayed to the doormen and valets. They will likely be talking about it out loud to each other. When the bus arrives it will likely arrive at a side door if available. They won't likely walk through the main entrance. Again, don't look like a fan or they will ask you to leave. If you happen to see any of the players, casually approach them. The doormen and security are trained to spot people like you and make it hard to get to them, ensuring their VIP guests feel secure staying at that hotel.   Let me know if you have any more questions and good luck!"
Barca,3dzftf,clamburgler,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:46 2015 UTC,Holy shit. i could not ask for better tips or a better source.  i was thinking of being honest and bribing the doormen like $20 but i guess thats out the window. ill dress nice and just walk in. im not sure how parking works though. do you have to be a guest to park your car?  all sounds solid advice. the game is at 8pm. they are done at 9 45. Ill probably go there around 10:15 and start the hunt.
Barca,3dzftf,iTz_SLammi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:51:33 2015 UTC,"At my hotel valet was free if you were going to a restaurant/bar at the hotel. If you were staying at the hotel it was $30/night added to your bill. I would suggest calling or checking online.   As far as bribing the doormen, feel it out. $20 might be far too little though. Hope this helps."

They had players like Eto'o, Albert Luque (sold to Dépor back when they had money) and Dani Güiza (back when he gave a shit), so they made a profit with them. They even won a Cup and had a couple good UEFA runs.   Their best years were in the late 90s (Héctor Cúper, Cup Winners' Cup final), so maybe their accounts look good here because they sold everyone in the early 00s?  In the past few years they've also had several bad owners and administrators, mainly Mateu Alemany. I'm guessing that it's a combination of this and cooking books during the good years (although pretty much everyone in Spain did that, and not just football clubs)."

Barca,3e20zg,Varnagel,6,Tue Jul 21 10:14:36 2015 UTC,"I've seen people say that Ter Stegen ""is the future"" and thus deserves a starting position infront of Claudio Bravo... But I never see any fans make the same arguments on other positions. While Bartra deserves more playtime, I never see anyone advocate we ditch Mascherano for him... Same thing with 32-year old Dani Alves and Montoya... But apparently when it comes to the goalkeeper position, youth and potential comes before playing the best player."
Barca,3e20zg,Mentosfruitcore,3,Tue Jul 21 10:29:28 2015 UTC,"The goalkeeper position is not something that normally changes a lot (injuries, transfer, etc.), and I believe fans and teammates needs a reliable keeper who they trust 100% (e.g. Valdes, Casillas, Buffon, Check, etc etc.). I do not think I am alone on this. I want a keeper that is reliable and does know the club and its values, in the long term. Bravo is quite old and we all know he will not last as long as a Ter Stegen. That is why a lot of Barca-fans would want Ter Stegen to be integrated into this team and be a long-term keeper for Barca.   Do not get me wrong, I really like Bravo and I think he deserves to be a starter for Barcelona ATM. However, I believe Ter Stegen can reach a higher level if Barca play him more regularly!"
Barca,3e20zg,Inspector-Norse,2,Tue Jul 21 13:48:17 2015 UTC,"I've said we ditch Masche for Bartra several times. The transition should happen soon, otherwise Marc will leave and we'll be forced to spend 50 or 60 million on a top cb and further stray from La Masia."
Barca,3e20zg,broad_h2o,4,Tue Jul 21 22:43:21 2015 UTC,Just let Enrique decide and accept his decision.
Barca,3e20zg,brocccoli,4,Tue Jul 21 10:59:36 2015 UTC,"I just think ter-Stegen makes the team play better, he makes the counters so much faster with his precise long passes. And hardly ever slows down the game like Bravo does at times.  Anyway it's not like they're were that much different, MatS faced harder opponents constantly and was a wall, both made mistakes (somehow everyone just remembers MatS mistakes), both GKs were lucky that our defense was top notch last season, I mean really in the first 8 or so matches of La Liga, there were like 3 shots on target against us or something ridiculous."
Barca,3e20zg,IhateAngryBirds,5,Tue Jul 21 11:01:13 2015 UTC,It's not that Bravo is not a good enough keeper or Ter Stegen is gonna be the future. For me it's that Ter Stegen isn't that patient. He has already said that he wants to play whenever possible. I fear that if he doesn't get as much football this season he is gonna wanna leave for it.
Barca,3e20zg,potatoe96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:28:23 2015 UTC,"you have to be confident that FC Barcelona is bigger than any single player. no matter whether Stegen leaves or stays, Barca is a top 5 club at any given year. this is where Messi, Dinho, Ronaldo, Romario, Maradona, Cuyff, etc. have played. If Stegen doesn't understand that to play in Barcelona you have to already be the best (as opposed to simply having great potential) then he is not made to be a Barcelona legend. nobody in this team has ever had the shirt handed to them. they have to earn it. the second that Barcelona loses that mentality they will become another Arsenal. a great team with great history that develops great players, only to lose them."
Barca,3e20zg,Monkeywithalazer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:23 2015 UTC,I was expecting this kind of a reply. But you have to also understand that there aren't that many great keepers available right now. I agree with no player being bigger than the club but that should not force us or any of our players into making any rash decisions.
Barca,3e20zg,potatoe96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:14 2015 UTC,"I agree. I just don't think benching a 22 year old keeper for a 32 (still relatively young in keeper years) year old keeper who was just selected best keeper in Spain, best keeper in South America, and had a goal to game ratio of 0.50 is a rash decision. Bravo is better at the moment, and barca might drop a title to Madrid by not fieldin the best"
Barca,3e20zg,Monkeywithalazer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the best keeper goalkeeper should play. So if Ter Stegen proves to be better, then he should get to play La Liga gaimes instead of Bravo. And if it's the other way around, Bravo should play instead of Ter Stegen. But if one of them isn't deemed better by Lucho, I would be fine with one of them doing the Copa and Champions League, and the other doing La Liga. And whether Ter Stegen or Bravo is the one doing La Liga doesn't really matter to me in that case."

Barca,3duvkq,YoSoyMilkChocolate,16,Sun Jul 19 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"I am very excited to see what Vidal can offer. It will take time for him to adapt to the RB position at Barca, but he definitely has the skill-set.  In the meantime, RB rotation for Alves will probably be Bartra, which will help him get more playing time."
Barca,3duvkq,lonestar_10,6,Sun Jul 19 20:30:53 2015 UTC,"His pace and decision making puts him a cut above Montoya for sure. Our structure of Rakitic as RCM dropping back to cover the space for the RB to push forward should suit Vidal well. Not sure how much chemistry he already has with Raki having been in Sevilla together, but the Barca system coupled with understanding between those two should make Vidal a nice replacement for Dani. 👍🏻"
Barca,3duvkq,canadian028,10,Sun Jul 19 19:14:49 2015 UTC,"Rakitic and Vidal were never in Sevilla together, Vidal arrived the season Rakitic left."
Barca,3duvkq,canadian028,3,Sun Jul 19 19:22:28 2015 UTC,"Huh, so he was only there for one season."
Barca,3duvkq,Rempelrez,5,Sun Jul 19 21:42:36 2015 UTC,"Vidal played for Almeria before moving to Sevilla. IIRC he has only played 1 season for Sevilla, not with Rakitic."
Barca,3duvkq,canadian028,7,Sun Jul 19 20:40:26 2015 UTC,Holy shit what a jump in 2 years. From Almería to Barcelona.
Barca,3duvkq,Eladir,3,Sun Jul 19 22:09:47 2015 UTC,"It's not just that.  2011 Mallorca B Third Division 2012 & '13 Almeria Second Division  2014 Almeria First Division  2015 Sevilla  2016 Barcelona  He has extremely little first tier football experience for his age. Only 2 seasons and he'll be 26 in a month. I don't think there's been a similar case for Barcelona in many years.  Maybe his metoric rise is due to his skills but if you add up that he's played the majority of his games as a winger, it's a high risk transfer. On the other hand Dani Alves has a 2+1 year contract so it's not as crucial he does well as when Alves was expected to leave.  At least have a lot of extra time to settle on the new environment and circumstances. When January comes though, imo it will rapidly become evident who L.Enrique considers the better option."
Barca,3duvkq,tajolly,3,Mon Jul 20 11:09:16 2015 UTC,"The thing that concerns me is that we played our best football when Rakitic went to the wing, Dani came inside as an interior and combined with Leo, not going wide like he did at the start of the season.  I haven't seen enough of vidal to know if he can work in that role. He certainly does seem to fit the architype of a wing back/winger which should give us another dynamic in games against teams with a low block. Something that Dani doesnt really offer like he used to"
Barca,3duvkq,tajolly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:56:16 2015 UTC,For me Vidal's speed can add a new dimension to this attack (and defense even). The thing about Alves is that he had to play more conservatively than in years past due to his speed slowing down. Vidal can bring the explosiveness back from the 2011 days and free up options for MSN to attack through another outlet. Plus he can make those speedy runs tracking back like Alba does on the left.
Barca,3duvkq,kezorN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"Having 2 attacking full backs isnt always a good thing, it'll mean busi/pivot needing to drop back into the back line to cover, leaving us short in midfield. I'd rather we had 1 conservative full back so that when the other pushes up we have adequate cover without losing the pivot."
Barca,3duvkq,kezorN,3,Tue Jul 21 08:31:21 2015 UTC,"He looks very similar to Alba, judging purely by youtube clips. Just as fast and agile it seems - and if he can become as good a defender as Alba is too, then we've got a really good RB to gradually take over for Alves in the next couple years.  I think he has potential to become a Mathieu for us, one that people didn't expect much from, but turned out to be very important, and solid, after all."

Barca,3dvnls,prwlr,2,Mon Jul 20 06:30:57 2015 UTC,I stopped buying into the illusion   of legitimacy of the financial sector. It  doesn't matter if we are talking about banks accounting firms or investment firms ; they only really care about  their own profit.   Once I accepted this simple truth it became easy to see through the patina of legitimacy that they sell.
Barca,3dvnls,_sic,2,Mon Jul 20 06:51:15 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, and I agree. But for the most part a business will have a hard time making a profit if it has a reputation for lying."
Barca,3dvnls,prwlr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:34:48 2015 UTC,"Sort of. If the ""lying"" is considered an ""interpretation"", in particular an interpretation that benefits the paying customer's desires, then that business will make spectacular profits.   For example, neither of the audits of Barça's books at the end of Laporta's tenure as president were based on ""lies"", per se, despite coming up with wildly different results. They simply made decisions on how to interpret certain things, like say the outcome of pending lawsuits, in either an extremely positive way (if Laporta was the client) or an extremely negative way (if Rosell was the client).   Nobody calls it lying, it's all interpretation tailored to the client's needs.   You want to know how not to make a profit if you are an auditing firm? Come up with results that the paying customer doesn't like.   Banks (and governments) did the same ""creative accounting"" when they got us into the current economic crisis. Of course they made massive short term profits, and then were bailed out by tax payer money when they inevitably failed. The morally bankrupt people who made these decisions made enough money to choke a horse. The rest of us suffer."

However, it's time that ter Stegen starts our Liga matches or else it'll jeopardize his development and we don't want that."
Barca,3dtznp,Mentosfruitcore,7,Sun Jul 19 13:23:39 2015 UTC,"If its not broken, don't fix it. I don't see why Ter Stegen should play ahead of Bravo in the league considering how amazing Bravo has played. Ter Stegen knew from the start that this was going to be a long-term commitment."
Barca,3dtznp,kezorN,3,Sun Jul 19 16:30:40 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it's a tough choice. Bravo is so good, he's making things difficult for the coach and that's you would like in a team.   However, Ter Stegen is the future. He is at an age where he needs every minute he can get otherwise his development will be compromised.   He will make mistakes and he will be shaky and he will cost us points, but that's the price for a 10 years of excellence.   It's like a new Valdes cycle.

He was ridiculously good. He just recently turned 32, which is not much for a keeper, he's probably still got 2+ fantastic years in him, and I'm honestly not sure he would stay if he was told that he'd only play CL for next X amount of years - he could be a guaranteed starting keeper at 99% of top teams  But Marc has all the talent and potential in the world..

What is sad is that I want to become a member of the club but I can't at this point. That, more than anything else, hurts me the most.  I do have problems with Bartomeu's management, but most of those stem from Rosell's involvement. Since Rosell left, the board has taken some good decisions on a sporting front and he is probably better than Laporta (being very objective).  However, I find it difficult to support a board which keeps some of its closest fans at a distance; they will support the club and spend money on it but need not be involved in the decision-making of the club."
Barca,3dtgkl,I_am_oneiros,14,Sun Jul 19 09:08:47 2015 UTC,"The moratorium on new members is correct.    It came at a time when Barca was on top and its still enjoying a cycle peak in generational terms. If membership is opened up freely, just the nature of the fad will ensure that there will be ton of new members who can of course afford it.    This is not organic growth or the right type of growth. Barca has enough members, it doesn't need more. Just because there is demand means little. The cons outweigh the pros.    If the argument is I am being denied a membership i'll stop supporting the club, then the moratorium achieved its goal, that person never should have been a fan to begin with.    In the meanwhile the restriction still allows for slower growth in membership numbers. And if in 10-20 years the situation requires the moratorium can be lifted, its not permanent.   I rather have club have/retain majority fans from the region club is from than people from all over the world who can afford it and want in on the success and part of the fad.   The moratorium came into effect about the time when Barca was overtaking Madrid as the most supported club in whole of Europe.   It was the right decision.   And if Camp Nou atmosphere is anything to go by i'd say it should stay in effect for a longer time period. Why do foreign fans want to be members if they are going to be at matches like handful of times in a year. Its a status symbol.    Supporters from Barcelona and its region have first right and always have and always will."
Barca,3dtgkl,iVarun,4,Sun Jul 19 10:35:11 2015 UTC,"It isn't ""I'll stop supporting the club"". Am I doing that? No, it's more of a ""Please allow me to support my club in a better way"".  The club is no longer a local entity considering they're opening schools in Sochi, Singapore, Peru, Delhi etc. (FCBEscola). They're going to the US for pre-season, they're travelling all around Europe every season for the CL, and they're doing promotional events in a gazillion countries.  You can always work out an arrangement for first right of seating to be given to local fans. Simply put, the working of the club can be separated from the match-day benefits."
Barca,3dtgkl,I_am_oneiros,4,Sun Jul 19 11:24:45 2015 UTC,"Am I doing that?   My statement about that bit was context neutral, it didn't target you specifically but anyone who holds that sort of view i listed out (you didn't, you just said you can't join but want to)     You say locals get preference in seating, its in part already like that. Buts its already mis managed. The locals are spread over the stadium and thus can't coordinate. Sure the club is not doing enough but it just goes to highlight there is a problem and it has no simple solution. One can't just let foreigners a free reign just because there are more of them wanting to get in on the action.  The club not being a local entity is not a simple statement. Its a global brand, yes, and those foreign ventures and foreign tours, sponsorships, foreign fans in stadium for match days, etc are part of that.   HOWEVER, its also a fact Barca is not like other brands and not like other global brands in sports/football even. Its just different, there is no denying this.    It will ALWAYS and ALWAYS belong firstly to the people of its region.    Its not about loyalty or being an equally passionate supporter. Someone from Fiji can show fundamentalist level support than even a 10 generation Barca fan from city of Barcelona might not muster BUT that is not the point.    Its that special nature of the club and its history that means the people there will always take 1st precedence and its the way it should be. That is one of its appeal in fact among many other things. Mes que un club is not a moniker for being the best as many other fan groups accuse us of.    Membership into any tribe for an outsider takes effort and a long road, sometimes it take the next generation to be truly accepted.   I would rather have it this way than the club get 50 Million soci living across North America and Asia. Because that is not even half the demand. There is no perfect system but the current one is the correct approach."

Barca,3dtgkl,elanciano31,0,Sun Jul 19 21:43:37 2015 UTC,You are absolutely correct. Our club used to be open for membership to everyone. Since Rosell they've made any non-catalans into 2nd class fans. There is absolutely no justification for their actions given that Barca is a GLOBAL brand. If they didn't want foreign socis then why the fuck are they doing international tours? Why opening schools abroad? So they deny themselves a guaranteed revenue base and then take on a shirt sponsor deal with a morally bankrupt country because we need the money? LOL! Its pathetic.
Barca,3dtgkl,cdn_brcafan,3,Sun Jul 19 15:16:15 2015 UTC,"Those tours and schools openings aren't meant to increase the number of members, they are meant to increase sales in merchandising, prospecting potential stars and to increase brand value and recognition so the club can charge more money from sponsors. As a member myself I don't want anyone to be a member too. The club spirit can only be maintained if the membership is controlled and it doesn't allow any idiot from anywhere to be a member only to drop membership as soon as Messi or Neymar leave the club, or the club stops winning Champions like a fat eats cake. Membership restrictions are a wonderful thing and I want it to be restricted for as long as needed. Furthermore, membership isn't blocked, just restrained."
Barca,3dtgkl,tiagom0702,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:35:58 2015 UTC,"Increasing brand value and merchandising is only done through gaining more fans. So the club wants to get a larger more international fan base who buys up the merchandise and travels all the way to Barcelona to watch the team play, but then turn around and restrict membership just because we aren't catalan? I can assure you I am far more diehard about this club than many Catalans living in Barcelona who may get a membership now cause of the success of the team and then just as easily drop their membership once messi or neymar leave.   Yes real fans should only be members, those that care for the club. The fact that you have to pay an annual membership and not be able to realize a significant portion of the benefits unless u live in Barcelona will deter many, if not most, casual fans.  As for the club spirit, if you mean the atmosphere in camp nou, the stadiums already filled with tourists! Aside from the Clasico and CL knock out stages you can hear a pin drop during matches. I've experienced both. How would the club spirit be affected any more negatively by allowing diehard international fans to be part of the club they love?   As for membership being restrained, it's one thing if I'm allowed to pay for my commitment card online or if I have to make one trip to Barcelona but no, I have to physically travel to Barcelona THREE years in a row. Not everyone can afford that and is very unreasonable to ask for such a commitment from anyone.  Last point, you talk about the club spirit, yet I find it funny that the club didn't even allow socis to enter the stadium for a critical Barca B game against real betis this past season and instead sold those tickets to Betis fans. The mini estadi, our home stadium, had more betis fans than Barca fans. That sort of ""club spirit"" truly makes me feel sad.   Because I wasn't born Catalan I am no longer allowed to be a member. That seriously hurts. The club used to be for ALL the fans, things like this makes the club exclusive to only the Catalan fans."

For being a 'diehard fan' you don't know too much about the process. It's not only restricted to Catalans, it's restricted to Catalans who also are family in the second-degree with another member. So no man, I'm sorry to say this, this is much more than the club having more fans and increase the brand value and merchandising. It's a cultural thing. It's something that Catalans are proud of: a sports club that was founded in their beloved capital has worldwide recognition and is used as a way to get to know about Catalunya; a cultural heritage of some sort. Think of it as a Denominación de Orígen rather than a worldwide community of fans.   There may be a lot of Catalans that aren't even football fans, yet they have a membership because their parents registered them as socis since they were born (or very young). That's alright, it's part of that heritage that only Catalans have access to; like giving them a piece of Catalunya.    Because I wasn't born Catalan I am no longer allowed to be a member. That seriously hurts. The club used to be for ALL the fans, things like this makes the club exclusive to only the Catalan fans.   It was never meant for ""ALL the fans"". Membership simply didn't need to be restricted because both, football and social dynamics have changed. During the last 10 years the world has become more connected (thanks in part to social networks) and globalized. That means Barça can reach a lot more people. Also, the club wasn't even the European powerhouse it is today (in terms of trophies); it was just a sports club; not a brand. Think of it as a slightly more successful Athletic: you don't see flocks of people from all over the world wanting to become Athletic members and it reinforces their Basque identity.  It's de Catalunya para el mundo, not del mundo para Catalunya."
Barca,3dtgkl,astral_cowboy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:00:02 2015 UTC,"I am very well aware of the importance of the club to Catalan culture and identity, something I admire greatly. Aside from all his faults and issues, Laporta got one thing right and that was to build the international recognition for the club. Doing so naturally leads to an international fan base, many of whom become extremely invested in the club. I happened to be one of these. Because I don't have an affiliation with Catalunya, the way I fell in love with the club, as opposed to united or madrid or chelsea, is because after falling in love with the soccer I learned the history and loved the fact that I can be more involved in the club I support as opposed to other clubs who have private owners and fans really have no say in their clubs activities. I've regretted not signing up as a soci when before Rosell and I've been waiting to do so at the first chance I get since then. A club for the fans is how I viewed it, not private ownership, no stocks in the stock market. Since Rosell that's become exclusionary. I stand corrected on which Catalans can become socis, fine, but my point stands, I see myself as a second class fan.   You can't stay closed off to the world but at the same time expect the fruits of international exposure and globalization. A ""look but don't touch"" attitude. (Edit: I live in Canada, where American companies regularly acquire Canadian companies. Tim Hortens, an iconic Canadian brand, was recently acquired by Burger King. This is the natural effect of globalization.)  Yes, maintaining the Catalan identity is extremely important, (edit: and I am by no means suggesting a foreign president, far from it), but closing off membership is not the way. Also, I find it funny Neymar, who has no ounce of Catalan in him, was made a soci. Whats up with those double standards?  Edit: words."
Barca,3dtgkl,cdn_brcafan,2,Sun Jul 19 23:16:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you said and I think that a lot of people here have at one point or another wanted to become a soci. But as /u/iVarun said, the negative aspects of opening the gates outweigh the positive ones. I'm not talking about you in particular or even the population that resides in this sub -- we know the role the club plays in Catalunya, we do our research, etc.  But there are a lot more people willing to pay a couple hundred euros a year just to feel part of the club, or as bragging rights -- you name it, but that won't do their part when having to act as a member.   You can't stay closed off to the world but at the same time expect the fruits of international exposure and globalization. A ""look but don't touch"" attitude.   That doesn't mean that you can offer a part of the club and the right to make decisions that can affect it to everyone that can afford it.   Yes, maintaining the Catalan identity is important, but closing off membership is not the way.   It is the best way right now."
Barca,3dtgkl,astral_cowboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:12:13 2015 UTC,"and I've been waiting to do so at the first chance I get since then   You could have obtained a commitment card and renewed every year for three years in the meantime, then requested to be made a member.  Have you?"
Barca,3dtgkl,elanciano31,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I do not have the capacity to be able to travel to barcelona every year for the next three years in a row, considering my personal finances. It costs me $1000 round trip to Barcelona, plus food and accommodation. I went this year, amazing experience, but cannot go next year due to some other commitments where I have to put my money towards.   So yes, I have definitely thought about it, but circumstances does not allow me to go three years in a row. Whats my alternative?  Edit: Also, to add, the vacation days I need to take off work which next year I have to put towards other reasons."
Barca,3dtgkl,cdn_brcafan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:20:46 2015 UTC,"Given how membership is expected to decide on factors that affect the locals more than anyone else, I unfortunately don't see any reason for supporters like you and I to have a vote, though I am going to give the commitment card a shot."
Barca,3dtgkl,elanciano31,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:26:29 2015 UTC,Good luck and hope your able to get it. For the local issues that socis vote on I get that and if I had a vote I personally would abstain on those. My vote would be mainly for the sporting issues of the club.
Barca,3dtgkl,cdn_brcafan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:45:07 2015 UTC,"What is sad is that I want to become a member of the club but I can't at this point. That, more than anything else, hurts me the most.   Then clearly you haven't done your homework. You can still become a soci without being catalan, through the carnet de compromiso. It'll take a bit longer, and you'll have to travel to Barcelona three years in a row, but I guess that won't be a problem because you're a hardcore fan that watched the Rivaldo hattrick... not one of those armchair fans.    However, I find it difficult to support a board which keeps some of its closest fans at a distance; they will support the club and spend money on it but need not be involved in the decision-making of the club.   What do you mean by 'closest fans'? There are many ways to support the club if you want to, although if you don't want to support the club financially you're still free to support the team and identify yourself as a fan.  They don't need you (or us, for that matter) to get involved in the decision-making process. They've been doing that for over 100 years and they've been fine."
Barca,3dtgkl,astral_cowboy,2,Sun Jul 19 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"I like how this article ignores the whole 6 months of Pogba's transfer saga for which Bartomeu hired Braida (as the author puts him in front of Abidal in competency) and sent delegation to Torino for transfer talk ( Bartomeu contradicting himself in span of 3 hours ).   My personal favourite however had to be his use of the Neymar debacle; isn’t it wonderful just how conveniently and quickly that a career lawyer can forget the difference between ""accused"" and ""convicted""?   So did you mister ""journalist""   Professor Josep Maria Gay, a PhD in Economics and Law have previously insisted that there the state prosecutors have no case.   How come it wasn't predicted that Laporta and his board members would be found not guilty for harming the club financially   Fans remain concerned with the club’s relationship with Qatar, and it seems as though Bartomeu is taking steps to rectify this; if rumours are to be believed, a new sponsorship deal with Japanese e-commerce giants, Rakuten could be on the horizon.    To bad that Qatar, money powerhouse,  has the first right for refusal on the other offers.   Nice little ass-kissing article."
Barca,3dtgkl,zero237,0,Sun Jul 19 13:47:29 2015 UTC,"Barcablaugranes is by far the worst of all the FCB-covering English-language. They are repeat-plagiarists and patchwriters, their articles are incredibly poorly written, and their ""opinion pieces"" are incredibly vacuous.  Yet they still get posted here, because of SBNation SEO and graphic layout. It's mind-boggling."
Barca,3dtgkl,SubjectAndObject,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:48:52 2015 UTC,"has the first right for refusal on the other offers.   They cannot stop a new deal if that is what is wanted, they can merely be offered the chance to match it I believe.  Now in a lot of cases this type of clause is enough to keep the incumbent sponsor in the deal but hey maybe we all get lucky and this has proven to be enough of an issue that the board jus dismisses any of their counter offers."
Barca,3dtgkl,elanciano31,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:39:44 2015 UTC,"If they decide to match the offer and Barca doesn't accept, then they can sue for damages which definitely will be for multi millions. Yet another lawsuit to pile on. Its a contractual right that can't easily be avoided."
Barca,3dtgkl,cdn_brcafan,0,Sun Jul 19 17:15:20 2015 UTC,"the deal is also up in a year, could jus tell them it will not be renewed.  There is also in my mind, a persuasive argument to be made out of the fact that any extensions to the sponsorship deal or counteroffers made by qatar will still be subject to a vote of members, Qatar airways would know this or be reasonably expected to and I should think it would heavily mitigate damages: You got into business and asked for a ROFR that would never be as concrete as in a case where the contract could be ratified by one person."
Barca,3dtgkl,elanciano31,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:25:13 2015 UTC,Interesting didn't know the deal is up in a year. Guess we'll find out soon enough what will happen. However socis would only be able to vote on extending the deal or not a year from now. I dont see how they can vote on whether to accept or violate their contract (to your point about voting on counteroffers)?  But as you said its up in a year so I'm sure we'll hold out for the year anyways and very unlikely we'll approach any other party until then.
Barca,3dtgkl,cdn_brcafan,0,Sun Jul 19 17:34:34 2015 UTC,"To the best of my knowledge the current deal is up in a year, though there are rumors floating out there a 90 million extension is being pondered.  my point on voting against counteroffers was in the context of the renegotiation (as a best practice you wouldn't start soliciting new bids while sneakily freezing out the incumbent party with a ROFR) so it wouldnt be to violate the contract, but simply to defeat their counteroffer which again is not nearly as strong as in a dispute where one party is negotiating with one party who has absolute approval.  The boards acceptance of these deals is dependent on voting member approval."
Barca,3dtgkl,elanciano31,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:47:00 2015 UTC,Ah yes that makes sense. The socis voted for Qatar last time so lets see what they decide this time around.. although if its 90M as rumoured I don't see them changing their views.
Barca,3dtgkl,cdn_brcafan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:23:08 2015 UTC,That's my take on it to.
Barca,3drt0o,baskinmygreatness,47,Sat Jul 18 21:02:39 2015 UTC,"It's on days like this that one realizes just how much it sucks to be a second class fan. You can support the club all you want but unless you are a soci, you are a second class fan.   I've supported the club for around 17 years now and am still no closer to being a member than the day I started supporting the club. In hindsight now, I wish I could afford it when it was more accepting of foreign members.  Having said that, the socis have voted, and the victory is rather resounding. So congratulations to Bartomeu. Hope he does well by the club and not just the sporting aspects. I'm more afraid than disappointed with Bartos victory. A trip to the Camp Nou before it sells out is certainly in order.  For me, the worst thing about Bartomeu winning is that Cryuff will continue to have nothing to do with the club. The mentor who has taught us the fundamentals of our footballing principles has been relegated to a outsider. It is an adherence to his teachings which has made us the most successful club of the century. I'm afraid we may just piss it all away."
Barca,3drt0o,vganguly,8,Sat Jul 18 21:47:38 2015 UTC,What are the prerequisites to be a socio?
Barca,3drt0o,choss,9,Sat Jul 18 23:45:18 2015 UTC,Since Rosell you either have to be related to a soci or you should've been one yourself in the past.
Barca,3drt0o,Assonfire,17,Sun Jul 19 00:45:57 2015 UTC,So reincarnated into it?
Barca,3drt0o,lookiebutnotalkie,5,Sun Jul 19 02:08:34 2015 UTC,Man...... Fuck Rosell...... When I can finally afford to be one he has to mess things up for me more.......

Barca,3drt0o,JAYSONHOOGY,89,Sun Jul 19 08:20:39 2015 UTC,"You know, it's not that I'm mad, I'm just very dissapointed. We all went through some painful memories and moments because of Rosell and Bartomeu in the last 5 years, a lot of socis wanted change, however something mysterious happened, we won everything on the one year that the elections was to be held. Socis forgot everything about the bad stuff, no one cared what happened before January of this year, suddently all was well and fine, and we could pretend there was nothing wrong with the club. The downfall of La Masia, Valdes and Abidal leaving, Puyol resigning, the club being faced by fiscal problems; all was forgotten.   Now we look ahead at what could be the end of Barca as we know it, not because our philosophy will change instantly, because it won't. Nothing will change this first year, maybe nothing will change the next year, but after that?. We all know that Bartomeu once had a survey if to sell the best player in the World, do you think he won't try to cash him before his carreer ends? I believe he will, some might disagree, some might say Bartomeu would never do something like that. But he has lied before, he will do it again.   What about La Masia, what will become of it, Bartomeu has said on interviews that he wants La Masia to not be spoken as much, Barca B players not playing with first team and so on, is this the end of La Masia as we know it? maybe. Where one board had complete trust in our academy, one doesn't.  Our newly upgraded stadium is another thing, the naming rights will be sold, most likely to Qatar, so the end of our dear Camp Nou will be over, just as Arsenal and Manchester City stadiums, ours will be called the Qatar Airways Stadium, and that's just depressing. Sure the seats might be comfortable for older socis, but hell why do they care about our integrity, they just want to watch football.  Where does that leave us as fans from overseas? nowhere, same as it has been past 5 years, I can't see Bartomeu opening soci membership for person overseas, or introducing electronic voting. We'll just be here every season, complaining how X player missed a huge chance, or celebrating when our players lifts whatever trophy they win. In some ways we're better fans than socis who own the club are, too good of a fans...   This might have come out a bit more grim than intended, but I'm just very dissapointed at the moment.  Visca el Barça forever...."
Barca,3drt0o,IhateAngryBirds,75,Sat Jul 18 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"Look, I respect your sadness and your frustration, and I share a lot of it. I know you and I have issues, but you have to believe me when I say that. But:   Valdes leaving has never been concretely tied to the administration in any way. Puyol resigning has been publicly confirmed to have nothing to do with the January crisis, he said so in an interview himself that he had planned to resign weeks in advance. Xavi, Puyol, Valdes, and Iniesta all made their debuts under Nunez/Gaspart, who were by all accounts awful presidents. The success of La Masia is not tied to a single person.    I do not do (horrible typo) disagree that La Masia's deterioration over the last five years is fucked up and depressing - but to say that is the end of La Masia as we know it seems a bit much. There were brilliant Masia players pre-Laporta, and there will continue to be more post-Bartomeu.   the end of Barca as we know it.   Many people know a Barça that predates Laporta. Maybe not you or I, but we're not the only ones that matter.   We all know that Bartomeu once had a survey if to sell the best player in the World   You mean the information claimed by rival candidates? It's entirely possible, but it's not a fact.  Things I agree on:   The stadium is all sorts of fucked up and could put us in a terrible position financially, which could limit the team's success. Soci restrictions are all sorts of fucked up and something Laporta had a completely opposite attitude on. We'd both like to become socis, and as you say, the odds of that are slim to none. It's maybe the most important issue surrounding the club, the type of people that make it up.   Bartomeu is a liar, and I wish to God he wasn't elected president of our club. But I refuse to throw out the baby with the bathwater with this End of Days attitude. And I promise this is the last time I argue with you about this, but I felt that a different attitude needed to be argued in this thread."

Barca,3drt0o,godie,19,Sun Jul 19 00:18:15 2015 UTC,"It's very unfortunate that this is the predominant mentality among most people in this sub.  First of all, what happened under Rosell happened under Rosell and what happened under Bartomeu, happened under Bartomeu. Many people use the transfer ban and the Neymar cases against Barto, as an argument against Bartomeu, without actually knowing the dynamics of the junta and the power of the presidential figure. If anything, I think that when Bartomeu stepped in he tried to distance himself as much as possible from Rosell. I mentioned many months ago (will edit this comment and link) that it looked like Barto wanted to make things right to get re-elected.   The downfall of La Masia, Valdes and Abidal leaving, Puyol resigning, the club being faced by fiscal problems; all was forgotten.   There is no such thing as a 'downfall' of La Masía. If anything, what happened under Pep was an exception and it took a coach that came from La Masía to accomplish that. Guardiola was the key for success, not Laporta.    We all know that Bartomeu once had a survey if to sell the best player in the World, do you think he won't try to cash him before his carreer ends?    ""We all know""? Before Laporta mentioned it, no one else knew about this. There was only a poll in Mundo Deportivo, but to say that it was Bartomeu who was behind that poll, without any proof whatsoever is a far stretch.   What about La Masia, what will become of it, Bartomeu has said on interviews that he wants La Masia to not be spoken as much, Barca B players not playing with first team and so on, is this the end of La Masia as we know it? maybe.    Way to interpret his words. What he meant was that he doesn't want any kind of hype around the B players since it puts a lot of unnecessary pressure on them. He wants them just to be focused on playing and getting developed, no the hype that hails them as the next someone before they even reach the first team. I agree with this and I think most people also do.   Where one board had complete trust in our academy, one doesn't.   Again, it wasn't because of the board, it was because of Guardiola. Once it worked out, Laporta talked about La Masía model and whatnot, which weren't talked about under Rijkaard. Had Guardiola's plan failed, I'm sure the board would've pressured Guardiola to buy new players.  Let's take a look at the transfers from last season, which are the only ones that we should judge since they were the only made under Bartomeu.  In:   Ter Stegen: Signed by Zubi. Bought for peanuts. Masip isn't nowhere near his level skills-wise or potential-wise. Rakitic: Luis Enrique's petition. No alternative from La Masía. Worked out well. Suárez: Luis Enrique's petition. No alternative from La Masía. Worked out well. Bravo: Luis Enrique's petition. A little expensive but we needed an experienced goalkeeper to replace Valdés in case MAtS didn't work out. Turned out fine. Mathieu: Luis Enrique's petition. Turned out fine.   The only questionable transfers were Vermaeleen and Douglas. And only Douglas would be the fuck-up. But Laporta had some of his own (and every club has them) with Keirrison, Henrique, and Cáceres.   Our newly upgraded stadium is another thing, the naming rights will be sold, most likely to Qatar, so the end of our dear Camp Nou will be over,    This hasn't happened yet. And if it did happen, socis would have to vote on that (just like they voted on the shirt sponsorship). If it happened that sponsoring the Camp Nou will allow their club to have less debt, or would allow their club to build more sporting infrastructure, well then let it be. If they want to sell their club to earn money, it would be up to them and only them.  See, the club is owned by the socios, either for good or for bad. We can't take pride on that (by saying that we're independent and not owned by a rich company or whatever) and then piss on them for the decisions that they make when we don't agree with them.   Where does that leave us as fans from overseas? nowhere, same as it has been past 5 years,    In the past 5 years we've won two Champions League titles (one under Guardiola, one under Luis Enrique), two Ligas, and I don't know how many Copas del Rey. We're also in a very good financial situation (at the very least, just as good as it was under Laporta), and still one of the most valuable brands in the world."
Barca,3drt0o,astral_cowboy,6,Sat Jul 18 23:46:15 2015 UTC,"Guardiola was the key for success, not Laporta.   How I wish more people will finally understand this! Laporta complained a lot when we sold Ronaldinho and said heads should roll. The man is semi crazy sometimes. He was still a good president but damn lucky with Guardiola and Messi and such. It's not like he created La Masia and Barto is destroying it!"
Barca,3drt0o,JurijFedorov,2,Sun Jul 19 01:34:42 2015 UTC,"He was also lucky to be at the time with that special generation of payers. Its not Bartomeu's fault Barca has Roberto, Bartra, Tello instead of Messi, Xavi and Iniesta that's all luck, those players are just not as good as the previous generation and they would still not be good enough if Laporta was in charge."
Barca,3drt0o,Blaugrana_Barca,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:05:21 2015 UTC,Exactly. That's my point. What has Barto done to shut down La Masia?

The Western world has to many individuals that use SJW as a religion. They fight againsts an illuminati out there that they themselves have created - with their very well functioning imagination. I am not saying Barto is Messiah resurrected - but people make him out to be Goliath while Laporta is David. Yeah right. As Laporta has never been accused of misusing money or doing stupid things like dating a questionable woman.
Barca,3drt0o,JurijFedorov,0,Sun Jul 19 18:45:12 2015 UTC,Agree 100%.
Barca,3drt0o,Blaugrana_Barca,3,Sun Jul 19 19:22:23 2015 UTC,"First of all, what happened under Rosell happened under Rosell and what happened under Bartomeu, happened under Bartomeu.   I once replied to you about this   I think that when Bartomeu stepped in he tried to distance himself as much as possible from Rosell.   ""I am good friends with Sandro Rosell. It's been already year since he was removed from Barca"" - CatRadio, July 13th  ""Nunez? Rosell? Good presidents."" - Rac1, July 16th  I don't see much distancing.    ""We all know""? Before Laporta mentioned it, no one else knew about this. There was only a poll in Mundo Deportivo, but to say that it was Bartomeu who was behind that poll, without any proof whatsoever is a far stretch.   Freixa mentioned that Messi sale was discussed on board's meeting in the past.   Way to interpret his words. What he meant was that he doesn't want any kind of hype around the B players since it puts a lot of unnecessary pressure on them. He wants them just to be focused on playing and getting developed, no the hype that hails them as the next someone before they even reach the first team. I agree with this and I think most people also do.   /u/IHateAngryBirds forgot to mention another quote from that interview which followed up:  ""It is a mistake to make them [B players] both train with the first team, making them play friendlies and debut in cup games.""  My written reaction to this comment   which weren't talked about under Rijkaard   Rijkaard was involved in promoting young players from La Masia - like Iniesta and Messi for example. La Masia was always a ""thing"", it just was more talked during Guardiola's era."
Barca,3drt0o,zero237,-1,Sun Jul 19 02:56:25 2015 UTC,"I once replied to you about this   I think I missed your reply. Look, I'm not saying that Rosell acted on his own all the time. But we don't know about the dynamics within the board. Bartomeu supporting Rosell doesn't necessarily means that he agreed with him on everything or that he wouldn't have done things differently.  So, by 'distancing himself' from Rosell I don't mean in a personal level, I mean decision-wise.   Freixa mentioned that Messi sale was discussed on board's meeting in the past.   Keep in mind that a.) as a candidate, Freixa was a rival of Bartomeu, and b.) Freixa got fired by Bartomeu (and his board). That means that he was going to say anything that could damage Bartomeu.  Now, I'm not saying that Freixa is lying, it's probably true actually. But who knows how that meeting could've been. For all we know it could have been something like: ""Gentlemen, there are sectors of the press and fans that are telling us to sell Messi. What are your thoughts on this?"".  IMHO, it's not bad to have brought up the question. Sure, it looks bad now because of the tremendous season that Messi had. But be aware that since his injury during Tito's season, all the way through Tata, and until Lucho's second half of the season, Messi was 'underperforming'. And you know that 'underperforming', is Messi's terms is still overperforming by everyone else's standards. That's why he lost two consecutive Ballon d'Or against Ronaldo.  Keep in mind that during Martino's season, it was when fans and media questioned him the most, with all the talk about him walking on the pitch and not motivated enough.  So yeah, while it sounds bad, we have no information regarding if that was something that Bartomeu actually wanted to carry out or if it was just an exercise like many others (""should we sack Luis Enrique or not?""), at a time when it made slightly more sense.   ""It is a mistake to make them [B players] both train with the first team, making them play friendlies and debut in cup games.""   I don't know what he meant by that and why he said it. If he meant exactly that, of course that's a mistake. I still think than there should be more to that than a single sentence.   Rijkaard was involved in promoting young players from La Masia - like Iniesta and Messi for example. La Masia was always a ""thing"", it just was more talked during Guardiola's era.   Of course, just like van Gaal did with Puyol, Xavi, and Valdés. Only that, under Guardiola, a lot more players from La Masía made their debut with the first team than at any other point in its history. But it was thanks to Guardiola that the whole world started talking about La Masía.  As a side note, the only players of La Masía that made their debut under Guardiola that have managed to be regular starters are Pedro and Busquets. So his throughput isn't that different from other eras under other managers either."

Now we don't have Pogba, we probably won't, and on top of that, this cunt is ruining La Masia. It's embarrassing, because I'm almost sure the Camp Nou will end up as the ""Qatar Airways Camp Nou"".

No one knows if Laporta was gonna really take a stand against Qatar or doing it for political reasons to secure a win. Politicians do it all the time. They are both as corrupt as it gets.  Bartomeu and his predecessor didn't pay Neymar's transfer taxes (Even Messi's doing this) and brought on minors to play for us (what european club doesn't?) Laporta used to steal money from charity matches.  In order for Barca to stay competitive, it needs that oil money. All European top clubs are doing it. It's 2015.  No one is a saint.  Entire countries vote against their own interest every year. Expect even less attention from the average person when it comes to sports."

Barca,3drt0o,astral_cowboy,-6,Sat Jul 18 22:01:57 2015 UTC,"Personally I wanted him to win. He has not done anything wrong in his own presidency. Yes, Rosell was a terrible president but Bart was not - so why blame him for all the things Rosell did? I am not saying he is not to blame but let the court judge him. They know the full story not us.  And also you people are acting like Laporta is the savior. There is an equal amount of rumors about him to. And he has spend his election campaign on attacking Bart and saying Pogba over and over again. He could have been a better choice but he clearly was not in this case. If he was the better man he would have presented his plan instead of repeating a players name that we all know could be bought by any president - it's a question of money and medals not some agent contact. And then he attacked the current president in a way that is not fitting for any running candidate or former president. This hurts the clubs image and he didn't care about the clubs image in this case. He said Bart would be a horrible president and that's it. I do miss Laporta. But after winning the treble I just want to win some more. The sponsor would not go away either way and you know it. I just want a president who does not seem like an asshole once in awhile. And clearly both the runners here were not perfect. We just selected the one who seemed less like a hurt child. And that's not because I don't like him. This is on him."

Yes, Rosell was a terrible president but Bart was not - so why blame him for all the things Rosell did?    I'm with you on this. Barto had to carry with a lot of the shit that Rosell left behind. Rosell fled like a coward. This guy stood up (not saying he's a saint either, he obviously had a self-interest which was to run for the presidency) and tried to make it as best as possible. Sure, he couldn't fix the FIFA scandal, perhaps no one could have. But he still tried to make things right and helped create a great project that won us a treble.   I wanted to have a serious, rational discussion in this sub but it seems everyone's too emotional about the situation."
Barca,3drt0o,zero237,-4,Sat Jul 18 22:31:15 2015 UTC,"But off cause I am downvoted. Because people can't see that this guy has only done one thing while being president: won the treble. That's the only thing. Rosell was terrible. He made the Neymar deal. He broke the rules with young players. Rosell should get ALL the hate. Bart worked with nothing but still won the league. So as it is now why shake the boat? The Qatar hate is equally weird to me. People need to stop being so god damn offended by everything in this world. There, I said it :-)"

Says it all. For me to believe Bartomeau truly distanced himself from Rosell, I would want to see him at least reverse Rosell's decision to allow international socis, since I would love to be a soci and until then am only a 2nd class fan, and make attempts to bring back Cruyff into the club who Rosell kicked out. He had ample opportunity to take such actions when he became president but he decided to keep things status quo. There's a reason many people hate Bartomeau.   Not saying Laporta is good either, but he is the lesser of two evils. At the end of the day I wanted neither but that was wishful thinking."
Barca,3drt0o,cdn_brcafan,0,Sun Jul 19 01:43:12 2015 UTC,So what? That quote just shows that they are friends. Not that Rosell will take part in any decision or that they will even talk about football - quite the opposite really. He just supports his friend as I see it. Nothing wrong with that. But he should off cause have added that Rosell is a closed chapter for the club. He didn't add that but that's not a huge mistake.
Barca,3drt0o,JurijFedorov,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:59:31 2015 UTC,"But what are you basing your assumption on that Rosell won't influence any of Bartomeau's decisions? Ok sure he may be referring to his friendship with that quote but its very odd he wouldn't make that clear, not a ""small"" mistake for me. Like I said, he has done absolutely nothing to show that he in fact has distanced himself from Rosell when it comes to the club since everythings been status quo."
Barca,3drt0o,cdn_brcafan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:30:56 2015 UTC,He just said that Rosell is distancing himself from the club. Does that sound like Rosell will try to run the club through Barto?

Lets not forget that he appointed Lucho as manager and stayed with him when most here (including myself) wanted him fired.  He has renewed Alves and his signings (apart from Douglas) have been very good (I want to give Vermaelen a chance before judging his signing).  Barca cant play as much La Masia players as before because the team is at a higher level than it was when Xavi and the rest where joining the team and because the current generation of players are just simply no where near the quality of the legendary generation. If Barto had a young Messi, Xavi and Iniesta in La Masia I have no doubt they would be promoted and play a important part in the team."

Barca,3drjez,zsajak,5,Sat Jul 18 19:44:04 2015 UTC,lol even if Benedito and Freixa didn't run it still isn't enough to overtake Bartomeu  Fucking Socios (egcg19 kinda killed me here)
Barca,3drjez,herefortheworld,11,Sat Jul 18 20:03:29 2015 UTC,"Fucking socios? It's their club. You don't have to agree with them, but how can you possibly criticize the people who literally make up the club, who are Catalan, who have been been fans for 30-40 years, even since birth? It's my team, it's your team, but it's their club."
Barca,3drjez,egcg119,3,Sat Jul 18 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"He can criticize whatever he wants and being soci or not is meaningless.   By the way, have you ever seen barcelona in real life? your dogmatism is uneasy."
Barca,3drjez,zenkyoto,2,Sat Jul 18 22:18:15 2015 UTC,"Been to Camp Nou four times. In what way am I being ""dogmatic""? And are you going to ascribe that trait to me based off a single comment, or have you actually read the majority of things I say on this sub?"
Barca,3drjez,egcg119,3,Sat Jul 18 22:32:16 2015 UTC,"Because your belief that socis cant be criticized no matter what seems one generated by someone that is far away and maybe repressed by that fact. That or just being a lover of private property. In any case i dont agree with neither.  I think actual people from catalonia dont really care if someone is soci or not, its just a coincidence. There are far more fans of the team here than socis and there is no distinction other than a damn card. Being soci does not mean you love more the club, thats for sure."
Barca,3drjez,zenkyoto,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:51:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean it like that....I'm just extremely frustrated because Bartomeu's decision making is hurting the club I've loved since I was a child.   I'm just frustrated with the socios who would vote for Bartomeu after seeing what Bartomeu/Rosell has done bringing scandal, controversy, and what has happened to La Masia (plus potentially renaming Camp Nou) under their presidencies."
Barca,3drjez,herefortheworld,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:43:32 2015 UTC,"No, he is right. Just because you are born there doesn't make you exempt from criticism. I don't care if you've been a part of the club for 40 years or 40 minutes. There is nothing in this world that will ever excuse you of criticism. Race, religion, location, position, nothing. If you mess up, you will be criticized and rightfully so."
Barca,3drjez,Plateau95,6,Sat Jul 18 22:15:42 2015 UTC,"However, the point of view from which he is criticizing them is subjective and narrow, looking at Barcelona within the past 10-12 years as if that there the sum total of the club."
Barca,3drjez,egcg119,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:18:03 2015 UTC,"True, but the problems facing the club today have arose due to Barto and Rosell. Yes, these past few years don't make the club what it is, not at all. It has decades and decades of history, but that doesn't mean we throw it all away now. If we don't focus on the present then we cannot move forward. We may have a long history of shit presidents, that doesn't mean we need to reelect another thinking that if we've survived this long, we will be fine."
Barca,3drjez,Plateau95,22,Sat Jul 18 22:31:30 2015 UTC,"Lot of people need some perspective. You act as if the club began and ended with Rosell and Laporta. It didn't.  I'm a relatively recent fan, but as far as I can tell, Laporta is the exception rather than the rule. Barcelona had Nuñez president for 22 years. He's now in jail.  Then Gaspart took over for three years, and though I know very little about him, people speak of those years as hell, and the club won nothing in that time.  Laporta came with a populist movement, swept everyone up in belief and tried to change something. Eventually, he too was outed as corrupt and a sleazy politician and booted out. And now we're back to the norm.  This is what Barcelona has - shitty presidents. One shitty president hired Pep Guardiola, another hired Luis Enrique. The difference is generally that Laporta surrounded himself with better people to help run the club. We can hope that now that Bartomeu is elected, perhaps he will do the same.  But as far as I can tell, the most damaging thing is this attitude of demonizing the enemy, of working against each other and not for anything. Laporta's campaign had no substance, and most people's support of him didn't either, it was just anti-Bartomeu. And one of the reasons Bartomeu and Rosell fucked up so much in the first place is they were so focused on tearing down Laporta, distancing themselves from his coach and his team and his way of running things.  The attitude that the ""other guy"" is evil got us into this mess, it's not gonna get us out. The socis who voted for Bartomeu aren't the bad guys either, it's their club - always has been, always will be. You can either accept that and treat them as human beings, or demonize them and rant and get angry that they don't share your same perspective. It won't make a difference either way, but this is the reality behind the team you fell in love with, and you have to live with that.  Edit: As @euleri on Twitter discussed with me, one major difference between Laporta and Rosell/Bartomeu is the politics of exclusion the latter practice, limiting ways to become a soci. That's a big fucking issue, maybe THE big fucking issue."
Barca,3drjez,egcg119,33,Sat Jul 18 21:12:01 2015 UTC,Time for Messi to go ahead and follow Manchester Utd on instagram.

Laporta didn't magically make everything good about our team, nor will Bartomeu magically ruin everything. We've had shitty presidents for years."
Barca,3drjez,egcg119,2,Sat Jul 18 21:03:05 2015 UTC,"Laporta sort of did magically turn things around for the team. The impact (Ronnie, + Deco, Etoo, Marquez) was virtually instant and he also sustained it."
Barca,3drjez,vganguly,2,Sat Jul 18 21:54:53 2015 UTC,"That's not magical, that's buying good players with a good coach. You could argue the same for Bartomeu. First year in office, brought Rakitic and Suarez to follow up Neymar, brought in Lucho, and bam, treble.  We'll see about that whole sustainability thing though. I'm not optimistic."
Barca,3drjez,egcg119,2,Sat Jul 18 22:02:52 2015 UTC,"A lot of us have been screaming for depth in the squad through the last five years. The first season they actually do something about it, bam treble.   But the fear is that it was only done because there was a fire up their ass with Rosell resigning and the scandals and such. That fire is gone now. Back to old ways."
Barca,3drjez,vganguly,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:05:07 2015 UTC,"Laporta brought us success in the form of buying Ronaldinho, Deco, Eto'o, and many other players. Had Xavi, Messi, Iniesta, Valdes, Puyol, etc. all not happened to have come along at the same time, we'd be sitting here talking about he followed the 'Real Madrid model'.  The reason we all believe that he's somehow more connected to la Masia is because he got the golden generation. Rosell and Bartomeu didn't, and in order to sustain the success of the Guardiola years they had to buy players. You cannot be successful in modern football unless you buy quality players. Unlike Laporta, however, they took steps to ensure our finances were good enough to buy these players. Remember all that debt we got under Laporta?"
Barca,3drjez,Epsilon76,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:57:26 2015 UTC,"The neglect  of la masia is not only evident in the transfers.  Laporta made Guardiola coach because Cruyff recommended him.

Like, their actions are literally the exact opposite. So stop attributing any random negative quality you want to them just because you don't like them.

Try and read it again, particularly the part where the board hasn't indicated any tendency to recruit managers based on outside reputation. Also, where the fuck are you getting Mourinho from? All you're doing is taking a figure everyone in /r/barca hates and associating him with the current board for literally no reason other than you want to vilify Bartomeu. He never hired Mourinho so why are you talking about him?"
Barca,3drjez,Epsilon76,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:24:34 2015 UTC,"Mourinho was based on your last edited sentence,  or did you mean Scolari, who basically failed everywhere after the world cup win?  About the list you posted.   Pep was undeniably successful, the most successful coach in history,  so successful that even though Rosell hated Laporta and would have never given Pep the chance, it was impossible for him to deny it.  After Pep resigned,  the reason for that having a large part to do with the Rosell administration, despite what Pep said.  After he resigned Rosell had no choice as to keep the Pep legacy going, he singed Tito, who while being peps  assistant  wasn't Pep,  evident at least after the Bayern result.  Then he hired Martino who failed completly, the only one who could be consider a Rosell original choice.   After that, Enrique, still the same, Rosell trying to do a Pep.  Despite the treble I still think he didn't got lucky there either.   In the end of the day it doesn't matter,  you got your wish and with it la Masía players out (Pedro, Thiago, Valdes)  overpriced average 29 year old midfielders in (Turan).

No sources, no quotes from Rosell, literally just conjecture. If he wanted to, he would've done so.

Barca,3drfrv,elmagio,2,Sat Jul 18 19:08:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, bigger than that time you voted for Gaspart.   Out of curiosity, why do you say that? I think Gaspart was just as bad as Barto/Rosell..."
Barca,3drfrv,Cambijao,17,Sat Jul 18 19:31:34 2015 UTC,"Now we'll start to see the endgame of these people: to incur in as much debt as possible with the Espai Barca project, so that the only solution is to privatize the club, and hand 51% or more on a silver platter to Qatari interests.   Watch how the projected €600m turn into 700, 800 and more. Watch how every kid with a shred of talent leaves La Masía for other clubs with better youth coaches. Watch how every non football section loses its value.   And watch Leo Messi leave. Not right away, but I'm certain he will not retire from football as a Barça player. He will be subject of more 'should we sell him' polls, more bile from Mundo Deportivo's editorials, more attacks from Madrid press that will receive no response from the club.    I'm gonna go get drunk now. See you on the Supercopa match thread."
Barca,3drfrv,CorsarioNero,6,Sat Jul 18 19:31:27 2015 UTC,"You greatly overthink all of this.  The only reason he won is because of the treble, that's it.  The people who voted for him still would not want Messi sold or to privatize the club which is pretty much impossible.  Yes Bartomeu is bad but he is not retarded to sell Messi .  The only thing you are correct about is La Masia but we are greatly over-rating it because of the last generation we had come from La Masia. We will never have a generation like that again so we should be lucky to get a few la masia players who are first team players in the next few years due to the fact that our first team is so strong already."
Barca,3drfrv,MessiNeymar,2,Sat Jul 18 19:58:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with your point that we were lucky to get a great generation of players from La Masia (Xavi, Iniesta, Messi, Puyol, Pique, etc.). However, even if there is a player in our academy who is incredible, we might never know about him if he doesn't get the chance to play in the first team. Those players didn't just become stars because of their talent. They had the support of great staff. Someone on /r/soccer also mentioned how big the gap between our current first team and the old one is."
Barca,3drfrv,iniestas,6,Sat Jul 18 20:25:38 2015 UTC,"I've said this before and I'll say it again here   Yes but the Barcelona team should be aiming for trophies. If you're not good enough, you're not good enough, this isn't the make-a-wish foundation. All good players have had competition. Busquets managed to oust Yaya Toure from the DM spot. Iniesta excelled despite recent signings like Deco and the like. Pedro booted Henry from the starting 11. Even a 20 year old Messi had to compete with Ronaldinho, Eto'o and Henry. If a player like Rafinha can't manage to displace 2 aging midfielders in Turan and Iniesta (especially in the first half of the season, where it's just him, Iniesta and Rakitic), I frankly don't see him becoming a world class player. The thing is, La Masia has failed this generation, not the Barcelona A team. The last first team players we had were Pedro and Busquets. Since them, every other graduate has failed to shine (apart from Thiago). Dos Santos is even in the MLS now, and he was a really promising prospect. This isn't like Real Madrid's case, where their graduates have gone on to become world class players (Mata, Juanfran, Cambiasso)"
Barca,3drfrv,arayofhope,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:34:39 2015 UTC,"Busquets had Guardiola, like Guardiola had Cruijff.  It isn't just a matter of talent. It's also a philosophy. As long as the board buys expensive players, the talent stands little chance.  Xavi needed a lot of years to achieve such an amazing carreer.  In the meantime different players have been bought by boards: Petit, Litmanen, Cocu, Rochemback, Mendieta and others. That is what kills the idea of La Masia."
Barca,3drfrv,Assonfire,2,Sun Jul 19 00:40:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the coach chooses who to play...  Anyways, I have faith in Enrique, Rafinha did well with under him at Celta, and he has coached the B team before."

Barca,3dqrkg,barcaloco,27,Sat Jul 18 15:30:44 2015 UTC,"MaTS is the future, I think they will swap roles. Bravo gets CdR and Stegen gets CL and league. It's just hard to say considering how well Bravo played in league, tough decision."
Barca,3dqrkg,Davdaq,21,Sat Jul 18 15:39:20 2015 UTC,Yeah and he did awesome in Copa America
Barca,3dqrkg,TheGreatXavi,7,Sat Jul 18 15:41:55 2015 UTC,"so Bravo was the best league goal keeper last year and when they swap, Bravo would only get the CdR while MaTS get to keep his CL spot?  God damn... If I were Bravo I would be offended."
Barca,3dqrkg,xenmate,7,Sat Jul 18 23:29:22 2015 UTC,That's not swapping roles at all.
Barca,3dqrkg,EqualWin,4,Sun Jul 19 07:18:16 2015 UTC,"its not fair i think, one the league and the other the cups. tho I'd love stegen to get everything.. bravo deserves   more."
Barca,3dqrkg,YoSoyMilkChocolate,0,Sat Jul 18 19:22:47 2015 UTC,"I'd do exactly as you did. I feel like Bravo may experience a decline from the year prior, seeing as he is aging. Plus ter Stegen is the future and we ought to be getting him ready anyway."
Barca,3dqrkg,TheGreatXavi,2,Sat Jul 18 17:20:37 2015 UTC,Hes not that old from a goalkeeper perspective. And we dont know if ter Stegen is truly the future or not.
Barca,3dqrkg,canti-,25,Sat Jul 18 23:30:21 2015 UTC,Surprised people want to start Ter Stegen immediately for all Liga matches. He should ease into it. When it comes to dead ball situations he doesn't look comfortable. He might have good feet but Bravo is far more knowledgeable of the league than Ter Stegen. Bravo still has the positioning and the reaction time to do everything.
Barca,3dqrkg,e_schlanzz,8,Sat Jul 18 17:27:35 2015 UTC,"This is what I want to see.  We should definitely start the transition, but make it slow, because Bravo isn't done yet"
Barca,3dqrkg,BreedingDiamonds,2,Sat Jul 18 17:40:08 2015 UTC,But why not switch them this season? MAtS for Liga and Bravo for copa and CL. Both need to experience the other competitions to actually gain experience.
Barca,3dqrkg,coldblade2000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:41:29 2015 UTC,"Because bravo has actual la liga experience. He was also the best goalkeeper of the season. Mats should play a few liga games, but bravo should not warm the bemch"
Barca,3dqrkg,Mentosfruitcore,25,Sun Jul 19 12:05:13 2015 UTC,"I think the current system is good. Perhaps give Ter Stegen a little taste of the league vs the weaker teams, but Bravo is the more capable goalkeeper imo, so I would want him in goal for most of our games."
Barca,3dqrkg,zsajak,15,Sat Jul 18 15:34:57 2015 UTC,"The more capable goalkeeper? Seriously?  Ter Stegen is the much better fit for the Barca way of playing  and is more talented and 10years younger.  He absolutely needs to play the majority of games to get better integrated into the team and gain consistency.  If not,  I am sure he will leave."
Barca,3dqrkg,ChinggisKhagan,8,Sat Jul 18 16:40:46 2015 UTC,"Ter Stegen still looks really dodgy, especially on crosses. I agree that Bravo is just the better keeper."
Barca,3dqrkg,FrostyGrass,6,Sat Jul 18 19:47:48 2015 UTC,He looked dodgy at the beginning of the season but never in 2015.
Barca,3dqrkg,choss,2,Sat Jul 18 22:25:17 2015 UTC,That's due to experience and lack of minutes which come in hand in hand.   If he is not giving the chance to play more regularly then he won't be able to improve very much.  It's a very tough decision to be honest.
Barca,3dqrkg,Melobyrro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:59:47 2015 UTC,"On paper mats is the perfect choice, but the mistakes he made last season don't sit well with me...   Hes still young, we could definitely give him more minutes, but bravo is still a safer choice"
Barca,3dqrkg,zsajak,7,Sat Jul 18 22:08:44 2015 UTC,"The mistakes will go away with consistency,  for me it's incredibly that he kept his nerves that well,  playing in the high pressure cl games while having basically no game practice to gain confidence.  Keeper rotation is not ideal because I think as a keeper in a club like Barca you need enormous confidence and mental strength,  this only comes with experience playing with the team."
Barca,3dqrkg,Melobyrro,-3,Sat Jul 18 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"To me different types of mistakes have different value   To me the decision making kind is the worse than lack of skill, or failing to execute a task  U dont choose to dribble aguero in a champions League eliminatory match   Imo he still needs another year on the bench"
Barca,3dqrkg,zsajak,3,Sat Jul 18 22:44:29 2015 UTC,"That makes no logical sense whatsoever, you cant get rid of those kind of ""mistakes"" sitting on the bench.  ""mistakes"" because , while he made some wrong decisions , there where no outright horrendous errors.  Either play him or sell him, its as simple as that."
Barca,3dqrkg,Melobyrro,-2,Sat Jul 18 23:53:05 2015 UTC,"I dont agree, playing time helps with shot stopping ball handling etc...   Conscious decision of attempting a dribble is not  a skill he should ever be trying"
Barca,3dqrkg,zsajak,3,Sun Jul 19 02:52:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course he should kick the ball long at every opportunity and stay stuck on his line and fist every ball away every time."
Barca,3dqrkg,Melobyrro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:24:07 2015 UTC,Yes.. In a match that important with a fast forward closing in u try a pass... Every time

Barca,3dqrkg,Mentosfruitcore,-15,Sun Jul 19 03:52:49 2015 UTC,"If he leaves, it just proves he wasn't loyal. Why should we let a worse goalkeeper play rather than let the best one play? I never see anyone use the same logic for Dani and Montoya for example."
Barca,3dqrkg,Aj16ay,13,Sat Jul 18 16:57:41 2015 UTC,"If he leaves, it just proves he wasn't loyal   That is truly awful logic. So you're saying he should just sit on our bench and wait for Bravo to decline while losing hopes of being the German NT #1? Did you say that about Thiago too? He left because he wasn't ""loyal"", right?"
Barca,3dqrkg,DwarfwithAutism,-8,Sat Jul 18 17:30:18 2015 UTC,How would he be Germany's 1? Leno is better and Neuer will be for a long time
Barca,3dqrkg,zsajak,11,Sat Jul 18 17:47:56 2015 UTC,"Leno isn't better,  ter Stegen is much more than a goalkeeper, he is a goalkeeper playmaker, his distribution is phenomenal"
Barca,3dqrkg,DwarfwithAutism,-7,Sat Jul 18 17:59:37 2015 UTC,His distribution was awful in the U21 wc
Barca,3dqrkg,zsajak,8,Sat Jul 18 18:05:25 2015 UTC,"I did not watch that,  but at Gladbach he was consistently the best passing goalkeeper of the Bundesliga."
Barca,3dqrkg,DwarfwithAutism,-8,Sat Jul 18 18:08:08 2015 UTC,its widely known that Neuer has the best distribution in the world
Barca,3dqrkg,zsajak,6,Sat Jul 18 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"Yes whatever, ter Stegen is definitely better at passing than Neuer,  every stat does prove that.  Neuer is more athletic and better at rushing out"
Barca,3dqrkg,Aj16ay,7,Sat Jul 18 18:10:43 2015 UTC,Ter Stegen is 6 years younger than Neuer... He could easily be Germany's number 1 in 4-5 years
Barca,3dqrkg,DwarfwithAutism,-5,Sat Jul 18 18:03:29 2015 UTC,In 4 years Neuer is 33. And Leno was always better for Germany...and for Leverkusen.
Barca,3dqrkg,Aj16ay,5,Sat Jul 18 18:04:46 2015 UTC,"Nah, ter Stegen is better. Also ter Stegen is the best keeper in the world with his feet already, a valuable asset for Löw"
Barca,3dqrkg,DwarfwithAutism,-4,Sat Jul 18 18:12:36 2015 UTC,Not sure what I expected in a Barca sub..lol.
Barca,3dqrkg,Aj16ay,6,Sat Jul 18 18:22:58 2015 UTC,And you're a Bayern fan... So unbiased huh?
Barca,3dqrkg,Mentosfruitcore,-3,Sat Jul 18 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"If he leaves after one season, then yes, he is unloyal. I don't think he will leave, but leaving after just one season because you're not the nr 1 keeper in a team..."
Barca,3dqrkg,NahSoR,7,Sat Jul 18 18:11:25 2015 UTC,Worse? What are you smoking?
Barca,3dqrkg,Mentosfruitcore,2,Sat Jul 18 17:01:09 2015 UTC,Worse than Bravo... not a very controversial statement. He is still very good.
Barca,3dqrkg,FrostyGrass,3,Sat Jul 18 18:11:59 2015 UTC,"Bravo is only the better shot stopper not a better overall keeper, and he's only barely better. In one on ones Mats is better as he shows his nerves of steel, also in distribution Mats is probably the best in the world."
Barca,3dqrkg,Mentosfruitcore,0,Sat Jul 18 22:33:43 2015 UTC,"He has better positioning, and more experience... but this is not some game where you count attributes as values on their own. It just gets as scewed as the Messi-Ronaldo debate. What matters is whom is the most capable player, and I think Bravo is the more capable one. Lucho agrees with me on this."
Barca,3dqrkg,realtejass,9,Sun Jul 19 08:25:52 2015 UTC,Bravo for now. Stegen for the future.
Barca,3dqrkg,IhateAngryBirds,15,Sat Jul 18 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"MAtS, no point to delay his development at the cost of a 32 year old who wont be with us for more than 3 years.   The sooner MatS plays more the better."
Barca,3dqrkg,maximus14433,5,Sat Jul 18 15:51:53 2015 UTC,Ter Stegen. Dude is a total stud. Needs more playing time to adapt more.
Barca,3dqrkg,rookz,2,Sat Jul 18 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"I think Lucho might be playing with everyone on this. Why does a team need to have a ""no.1""? I'm not so sure this is a problem as much as it is modern tendencies for soccer evolving. It seems as if Lucho has an idea of including both keepers in the team without necessarily chosing one OVER the other simply because the players understand this mentality."
Barca,3dqrkg,blackk_ice,2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:19 2015 UTC,Bravo and ter stegen swap roles.. Bravo does what ter stegen did last season.
Barca,3dqrkg,linqqan,2,Sat Jul 18 17:04:30 2015 UTC,mats is a big talent but Bravo is better right now. Maybe let mats take care of the cups and a few league games while Bravo plays the big ones.   Not that stegen is bad but 32 isnt that old for a keeper. Look how good VdS was his last seasons. And Bravo is one of the best in the world i strongly think. At least top5.
Barca,3dqrkg,efarfan,2,Sat Jul 18 21:12:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know how people say Bravo is better in any way. Mats didn't have good game time. There were times he went a month without a game, and when he finally got game time.. ""oh he kinda missed that one cross"". Bravo had some dodgy moments in the Copa America, meanwhile Mats was phenomenal at the u21. Not to mention the advantage we gain with MAtS world class distribution from the back. I think they should both get some game time. League to Mats, Bravo CDR and group play for Champions, after group play back to MAts as main."
Barca,3dqrkg,Kluey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:17:32 2015 UTC,"No one here can answer. Whomever is better in training that week should play.   Eventually ter Stegen will improve and be better than Bravo. Until then, use them both."

Bravo is doing amazing and it would be unfair to take away league play just because another keeper is younger. Maybe next time after this season. Lucho will surely not try to change something that isn't broken.

Barca,3dqrkg,TR1L0GYxx,2,Sat Jul 18 19:17:02 2015 UTC,Maybe because he is a young goalkeeper who we want to mold to be better. And you know what usually gives players more experience thereby increasing their skill? I'll give you a second to guess. It's playing games.

Barca,3dpuia,MayIHaveAHug,26,Sat Jul 18 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think we can afford to let Pedrito leave this summer. I feel like we are going to rely on him somewhat. He is literally our only first team option (attacking wise) up front for MSN.   While I'm huge fans of Munir and Sandro I just feel like if one of our trident gets an injury, we can't afford to not have someone of Pedro's experience and mentality up front.  I say we offer him whatever he wants, we need him.  That being said, if he really does want to go then we shouldn't keep him here against his will. After everything he has given us, we owe him that."
Barca,3dpuia,angelo994,18,Sat Jul 18 10:49:15 2015 UTC,As much as I hate to say this but if Pedro moves to MU then he will likely to have more opportunity to play over there than Barça. If he wants this transfer then we can't hold him back since he expects more time on pitch but it would also hurt losing a player like Pedro.
Barca,3dpuia,Football_Enthusiast,9,Sat Jul 18 10:58:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah for sure. I'd imagine he would be their first choice for the right wing.  It's a difficult situation really, I'll be sad if he leaves us to be honest. But I agree, his options for first team football (starting XI anyway) are much more guaranteed."
Barca,3dpuia,angelo994,8,Sat Jul 18 11:43:58 2015 UTC,I'll be sad too if such a dedicated player like him leaves us due to not being granted enough time on pitch; and it would be a bit ironic if Pedro actually ends up signing for MU because I still remember that he scored the opening goal in UCL '11 for us against MU in the final.
Barca,3dpuia,Football_Enthusiast,3,Sat Jul 18 15:26:28 2015 UTC,It's possible. He would face competition from Di Maria and Mata though.
Barca,3dpuia,DurdenCommaTyler,7,Sat Jul 18 13:15:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't play either of them on the wing over Pedro to be honest. They are much, much more effective in central roles. Where as Pedro is far more effective coming from wide areas.   All very good players though."
Barca,3dpuia,angelo994,2,Sat Jul 18 13:18:28 2015 UTC,Yeah but it's likely they will be playing out wide under LVG's system.
Barca,3dpuia,DurdenCommaTyler,2,Sat Jul 18 13:31:51 2015 UTC,"I don't follow EPL that much but only the handful amount of EPL matches that I've watched in the last season, Di Maria wasn't that good on wing-play and he particularly didn't have a great season (there is a rumor going on about his departure from MU too).   As for Mata, I think Pedro is a better player than him regarding wing-play, so Pedro might get higher preference over Di Maria and Mata to LVG."
Barca,3dpuia,Football_Enthusiast,4,Sat Jul 18 15:32:51 2015 UTC,"United fan, you are right, Di Maria to PSG is a real possibility and Mata isn't a winger, Pedro will start whenever he can if he comes here. Mata will be a second choice winger in a 4-3-3."
Barca,3dpuia,as520,4,Sat Jul 18 19:22:31 2015 UTC,Everyone keeps forgetting we signed Vidal who has played almost all of his games last season as winger
Barca,3dpuia,NahSoR,3,Sat Jul 18 17:02:13 2015 UTC,"That is actually a very good point.   Although, you have to consider the registration ban.   If we do sell Pedro, then who is the option until Vidal/Turan? I just don't think it's fair to rely on Sandro and Munir and put that much pressure on them when they are just getting into the first XI.  But I agree, Vidal is a very good option I didn't consider."
Barca,3dpuia,angelo994,6,Sat Jul 18 17:07:34 2015 UTC,"He lacks the confidence (or skill) to drive at players and take shots but just something as simple as what he did for Neymar's CL final goal (good first touch, holding it long enough to draw defenders and then making a pass with perfect power and direction) is an invaluable skill from a supersub.   We take that for granted but tons of inexperienced players would have fucked that up, either because of poor decision-making, bad technical ability or just succumbing to the pressure. It would be unfair of me to say that Munir or Sandro would have but I don't trust them nearly as much as I trust Pedro."
Barca,3dpuia,CataclysmicCollision,5,Sat Jul 18 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"I'd hate that, from a sentimental point of view. The first game I went to at the Camp Nou was a game when he scored from basically the half way line and because of that he has stuck in my memory as a favourite"

Sandro would just disappear in many games, I really feel like he's a limited player and this may be an unpopular opinion but I would be surprised if Sandro ever becomes a fixture in the first team.

Barca,3dmsk4,Illegal_sal,17,Fri Jul 17 15:21:20 2015 UTC,"Well, Turan has incredible skills and a great workrate, both of which are important for a Barca midfielder. Here are a few examples:  Arda Turan dribbles through 5 Málaga players until he was fouled,  Turan tracks back, battles for the ball with 2 players, wins it, goes past another player and then tries a roulette  And he has nutmegged Pique  Edit: Almost forgot, his beard is too good to pass"
Barca,3dmsk4,A_Kind_Shark,10,Fri Jul 17 16:38:05 2015 UTC,"He's so entertaining to watch.   Also that dribble vs Málaga (and determination) is something you normally only see Messi or Iniesta do - mostly Messi. Says a lot about his capabilities, and he might even be able to improve a bit when training with even better players than Atlético's.   He brings both physique, great passing, great dribbling and defensive workrate to the team - he's IMO the best ""replacement"" for Iniesta there is at the moment, and he knows the league which means less time used to fit in.  Can't wait til the season starts - hope to see him and Vidal in pre-season as well, seemed to me like those articles about them not being able to play friendlies were bullshit, but who knows."

Barca,3dmzju,Chillidawg,3,Sat Jul 18 02:44:22 2015 UTC,"He is really good at running, passing and dribling, but I get worried when comes to finishing. Neymar is a world class player, but his finishes is something that he needs to work on. Sometimes he doesn't now when to shot, sometimes he shots and was time to pass. That's what makes him the 3rd, not the 2nd best player last season."
Barca,3dmzju,FrostyGrass,6,Fri Jul 17 16:17:39 2015 UTC,"With the amount of goals he scored last season and you are still worried about his finishing, that means he has even more room to grow as a player. His finishing is not on Suarez or Messi's level but he's also less experienced. Neymar is a natural finisher who will only get better."
Barca,3dmzju,potatoe96,4,Fri Jul 17 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sure! That two runs he had against Madrid and PSG and he didn't pass to Suarez bothers me everytime I watch."
Barca,3dmzju,justafanpassingby,3,Fri Jul 17 16:37:03 2015 UTC,He has a lot of lapses of concentration and decision making but that is definitely gonna get better. Even for Brazil sometimes he goes solo when there are open attacking options there. I wouldn't be surprised if it got better as soon as the coming season. If he fixes his finishing I think he can end as one of the top scorers next season.

Barca,3dpx4m,bulkkorcutt,-5,Sat Jul 18 08:20:54 2015 UTC,"See that's the thing man, Messi has already played in this position multiple times this year, and Lucho has attempted this formation in some games and it's worked out beautifully. Messi enjoys the role too, and when he doesn't see too much of the ball, he can always switch with Suarez for a stretch of the match and get back into his spot. One of the best playmakers in the game on the right hand wing with a deadly left footed switch, cross and pass can create us so many chances."
Barca,3dpx4m,egcg119,8,Sat Jul 18 08:25:56 2015 UTC,"It's never been a 4-2-2-2. Rakitic is not a CDM, he got forward with Messi a great deal and played on the RW.  Regardless of where Messi plays, the team has always been a 4-3-3. If Messi moves into the RCM, Rakitic or Dani mvoes out to the RW.  4-2-2-2 is a much more static shape as far as formations go, it doesn't lend itself well to passing triangles. That's vitally important."
Barca,3dpx4m,bulkkorcutt,9,Sat Jul 18 13:39:26 2015 UTC,"i see what youre saying, but i dont really see how thats much better than a standard 4-3-3? messi is still able to drop back and receive the ball, but he can also play further up the pitch and get some goals.   also, neymar is at his best running at defenders in a 4-3-3. in a 4-4-2 i feel like he would be too restricted and get in the way of suarez."
Barca,3dpx4m,potatoe96,5,Sat Jul 18 08:28:50 2015 UTC,It works since its a change in the middle of a game. Playing this the entire game will leave Barça vulnerable to attack from the wings a lot since if you have Neymar and Messi on the wings the fullbacks can't play as attacking as they would like. Then a 4-2-2-2 would very narrow as well so a long ball Alba run would become extinct as well. And also if a team completely floods the midfield then we could get out played in the mid as well. 4-3-3 works best with the style we use atm.
Barca,3dpx4m,Football_Enthusiast,4,Sat Jul 18 09:28:20 2015 UTC,"I think Messi might play as a CAM type role but I don't see this happening before '18-'19 or '19-'20 season. I mean Messi is still deadly in forward position so no, I don't want him to play at the back at this moment; I mean he still drops back and press to fetch the ball every now and then but I love watching him to play upfront and score some screamer as well as some sweet assists."
Barca,3dpx4m,david4bcn,10,Sat Jul 18 10:08:07 2015 UTC,Barça always will be 4-3-3. That's all I will say.

Barca,3dpx4m,reevesbonilla,2,Sat Jul 18 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely ludicrous. There is no 4-2-2-2. Busquets is a CDM who thrives dictating the play alone in the center, Turan will come in and play in the same role that Iniesta plays where he can drift wide when need be, but use his engine to dictate passing in the middle of the fiield, or in Rakitic's role pushing forward.   As for Messi, you trying to change his RW to RAM is pointless, as he plays wherever he needs to be at the time, and simply re-labeling his position is not a topic of discussion, but needless."
Barca,3dpx4m,DivineVibrations,2,Sat Jul 18 20:18:15 2015 UTC,"Of course this affects the whole team, but they are building it around a Messi move to midfield later on in his career. Don't get me wrong this will probably only happen like once every few games for 20 mins or so if we need to boss the midfield and have those extra players up forward"

Like right now with all our scandals and missmanagement of La Masia, it doesn't seem to affect the first team but that eventually will change.  Also, if you plan to become a soci, now it is harder than ever. This thanks to Rosell, who changed the requisits to become a soci.

With Baromeu&Rosell (because you can't separate those two)  They questioned Cruyff's title of honorary president.  They got us the FIFA transfer ban.  They got us involved with Qatar.  They closed many youth teams (baseball, hockey, and others) because they wanted to save money. To the hell with our motto ""Més que un club"", right?  They stopped Laporta's project to renew the Camp Nou because it was too much money (250 mi). Now they are trying to make us swallow their 600 mi project.  They got Neymar in a shaddy way. Now both of them are facing jail time, Rosell (7 years) Barotmeu (2.5 years)  After Rosell resigned Bartomeu became president, he did this instead of calling for elections. He will go in history as our first not elected president. Who voted for this guy anyway? He is not going for re-election, he was never elected in first place.  They are willing to sell the naming rights of our stadium, they don't give a rat's ass about our identity.  They cooked Barca's books to make it look like Laporta mismanaged the money. Laporta was on trial, but just a few months ago the judge found him not guilty. Actually, Laporta left Barca on a surplus.  The erased over 100 year tradition by introducing horizontal stripes on our shirt. Who cares about tradition? right?  I could keep going all day long, but I am tired of keep talking about this. It upsets me that some even try to put Laporta in the same sack than Bartomeu&Rosell.  I know Laporta is not saint, but he is far from been like Bartomeu&Rosell."

Her father’s regime is considered by the principal international human rights organisations as one of the worst in the world. Apart from torture, murder and the use of intimidation as institutional means of persuasion designed to perpetuate the power and the wealth of the governing elite, what distinguishes Uzbekistan is the systematic abuse of the children, millions of whom have been forced to work as slaves in cotton fields, principal source of income of the “atrocious” “criminal state” of Uzbekistan, according to the last report on the country by Human Rights Watch.  President Laporta, who did not want to answer El Pais’s questions, seemingly did not take these considerations into account at the time Barcelona signed millions –worth agreements between the FC and Gulnara Karimova’s football team Bunyodkor. She has not answered questions from this newspaper either. The Catalan club sponsored by the agency of United Nations for the defence of the children (UNICEF), sealed an agreement of brotherhood with Bunyodkor during Laporta’s visit to Tashkent in August, 2008. But the money goes in the right direction. Bunyodkor, financed by Zeromax, has paid five million euros to Barcelona in exchange for two friendly games, one of which was played in January, 2009 in Barcelona; the return match, in Tashkent, it is still in the future. Three million euros more deposited to Barcelona after visits to Uzbekistan by three players of the club: Messi, Puyol and Iniesta, who took part in camps with young players of Bunyodkor.""

They just try to minimize the impact of them or accuse me of loving either a)Nunez b) Bart/ Rosell or c) all of the above.  Which isn't true and is normally a sign that the people arguing with me haven't got a fucking leg to stand on."
Barca,3dmge9,elanciano31,0,Fri Jul 17 14:28:29 2015 UTC,Ha did you even bother to read the articles?  5 million was paid to the club and Laporta admitted to being paid 10 million personally.  http://deportes.elpais.com/deportes/2011/10/10/actualidad/1318231314_850215.html  http://elpais.com/diario/2010/05/09/domingo/1273377157_850215.html  Have a read.  edit: annnnnnnnnnnd theres the delete.

There's a huge difference between arranging a brief cooperation with a club from Uzbekistan and allowing Qatar to take place on Barca's though...  I'm not defending the association with Uzbekistan, of corse, but Rosell and Barto's Qatar-cooperation are on an entirely different level.

Barca,3dl4sw,mrbedros,2,Fri Jul 17 06:13:08 2015 UTC,"Any reason why Tata isn't great? People keep saying it, but I'd like to know how they would improve the team. Messi's skills are undeniable but building a football team around one person seems risky in my opinion, what if they are hurt? Then people will just as easily blame the coach for his tactics.  Argentina struggled but they got into the finals. They got into the WC finals last year so they are already a strong team, but to get into the Copa America Finals a year later isn't a fluke either, I'm sure Tata did something good and that the team is built in consideration to Messi already, more like he could do better.  *edit"

Barca,3dlcdf,ksalama,14,Fri Jul 17 13:56:09 2015 UTC,"I would say keep Sandro and let Munir go out on loan. I believe Munir is more skilled and has a higher ceiling that can only be developed by regular playing time and being allowed to flourish. Sandro looks more like a typical number 9 and could be a more beneficial impact sub for us, developing without as much needed playing time as what a Munir type player would need"
Barca,3dlcdf,Dark-X,9,Fri Jul 17 12:23:08 2015 UTC,It'll be Munir.  It's obvious that Enrique prefers him over Sandro from previous season.

Barca,3dlcdf,will888,10,Fri Jul 17 13:21:27 2015 UTC,"Munir. It's undeniable that he looked like he could be a big thing when you looked at the first weeks of the season, and I just don't want him to be shipped out to a bunch of other clubs on loan as that may be what forces him away, but if Barca help him develop properly I can see him being a successor to one of the big three if they leave."
Barca,3dlcdf,beastcat,5,Fri Jul 17 08:25:48 2015 UTC,"That's very true. On the other hand I think Sandro had a good closing weeks with us. The performance that capitalized that was when be scored against (........ajax), I think,  a late one in the second half and won us the match. I like both. Sandro to me feels like a carbon copy of Pedro, a workhorse winger. And munir feels like a false nine, center forward. It's hard to decide lol But I guess you can't take both away from barça B."
Barca,3dlcdf,will888,5,Fri Jul 17 08:40:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly, why isn't it an option to maybe keep one in the B team for a year whilst we look for space as they both show terrific amounts of talent at times"

Barca,3dlcdf,bballdeo,3,Fri Jul 17 13:28:12 2015 UTC,I think it can be argued that Munir has more obvious potential (higher ceiling) while Sandro has had much better performances/finishing in his first appearances with the first team.

Barca,3dlcdf,flackohowyoubeen,2,Fri Jul 17 13:55:30 2015 UTC,Why? Because he scored more goals in their first team period? Munir is superior in every aspect except physicality and maybe finishing.
Barca,3dlcdf,polechi33,2,Fri Jul 17 14:11:16 2015 UTC,"No, that is not the idea. Munir has played as winger while Sandro as 9. Sandro is more like Suarez, while Munir is more like Neymar. If Pedro stays, we need Sandro and not Munir.  Also it would be good that Munir learns to use his right leg."
Barca,3dlcdf,flackohowyoubeen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:15:21 2015 UTC,"Munir is best in the middle, and the only thing that makes Sandro similar to Suarez is how he's built. Suárez is very intelligent, Sandro is not. Munir is. Messi and Ney can play creative one-twos with Munir because he's also a very good passer, and his positioning is top notch."
Barca,3dlcdf,egcg119,3,Fri Jul 17 14:39:29 2015 UTC,"How can you state definitively Sandro is not an intelligent player? How much have you watched him? I also prefer Munir, but that seems a bit presumptuous and insulting for a professional-level player"

Barca,3dlcdf,MyKillK,2,Sat Jul 18 06:38:20 2015 UTC,Frankly I thought Sandro seemed more effective as a striker. Less minutes but more goals. He always seemed to score within like 5 minutes of coming into the game.
Barca,3dlcdf,OrangePaper7,2,Fri Jul 17 20:39:52 2015 UTC,These comments are basically a 50/50 split
Barca,3dlcdf,flackohowyoubeen,2,Sun Jul 19 04:21:39 2015 UTC,"If Pedro leaves, why not just have Munir and Adama? Then you have a quality 9 and a quality winger."

I imagine he'd be sad because he couldn't win his 4th title in a year (laughs in spanish).

It was just bad luck he didn't have much time with the national team after getting injured.   It's crazy how it's taking him a long time to find first team action, makes me wonder how bad his injury affected him. I'm really curious as how he will perform if he goes to Valencia"

I don't think he's a keeper you want when you chase titles. I don't mean to hate on him, as he was valuable to us, but he was often the worst player on the pitch. Can't blame him for that last part as we had 3 generational talents on the pitch at a time.   Also he wouldn't have helped Spain in international play because he's their 3rd or 4th string keeper."

Barca,3dld1k,flackohowyoubeen,0,Fri Jul 17 12:08:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I'll be downvoted but he was never a good enough GK for Barcelona. A defence with Puyol and Marquez (and later Piqué) helped him to get all the Zamora trophies. He actually fit in well in Pep's system of a GK that plays with his feet and starts the action, but I feel (as most of my culé friends, and the non culés too) that he was terrible on one-on-ones, he could never catch the ball and the defence had always to be a wall so we didn't lose all the matches"

Your opinion is better than stats, Zamora's & Casillas's numerous mistakes that are overlooked. The measure of a good keeper is how he performs individually are after his defensive protection has been breached, in that regard Valdes is remarkably good"
Barca,3dld1k,mettacitta,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:06:46 2015 UTC,"Well you're Catalan then because he has 0 respect in Spain. Even casillas after being 'topo' has more respect because he saved us at the 2010 World Cup. I ain't gonna change my opinion, he definitely didn't know how to act on one-on-ones, he never caught the ball, and he always complicated very easy saves. He ressembles a bit pepe reina"

I doubt Messi would be angry at Bravo because Chile won the final, that wouldn't seem very mature."
Barca,3din4p,Phantomchrism,2,Thu Jul 16 17:43:04 2015 UTC,Agreed
Barca,3din4p,Traddwill,-6,Thu Jul 16 17:46:55 2015 UTC,"We know Messi is a humble and good person, but idk. He must have a little, just a little bad blood for him. I mean all the poor guy wants is a title with Argentina :("
Barca,3din4p,BreedingDiamonds,10,Thu Jul 16 18:00:14 2015 UTC,Messi knows that the only person a footballer can be pissed at for loosing a match is only himself. I would not worry about that at all.
Barca,3din4p,alterpsyche,2,Thu Jul 16 20:06:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it would cause any problems... not worried at all, it's a silly thing. but I'm saying maybe deep deep inside Messi gotta feel something though, he's human (I think). Anyways we can't possibly know or guess what he feels."
Barca,3din4p,BreedingDiamonds,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:53:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think Messi hold it against Bravo (unless there's some sort of tension build), but yeah, the amount of distress Messi has felt playing for Argentina and playing the last two finals has been inhumane. He seriously deserves some support back at Barcelona, and not only that, but add the stress of being aware of what his family was put through at the copa america final.  I truly feel for Messi, and I'm very proud of him. Locker room intrigues do spark up for things as trivial as being jealous for a teammate winning, but I sincerely doubt that his relationship with Bravo has suffered."
Barca,3din4p,Phantomchrism,0,Fri Jul 17 22:33:46 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstand how footballer think about opposition. Well most footballers. It is not like for fans who see the rival as the enemy. Footballers see eachothers basicaly as colleges, who all do their job. It was Bravos job to win, that is what most footballers think about it. And I would bet one of my fingers that Messi thinks like that also."
Barca,3din4p,alterpsyche,-3,Thu Jul 16 21:59:28 2015 UTC,Perhaps not directly... but you know that whole Copa America tournament not long ago? Bravo might have been on the winning side that shut out Messi Argentina.

Barca,3din4p,Traddwill,11,Thu Jul 16 17:43:33 2015 UTC,he'd be ridiculous to hold a personal grudge against a teammate who simply was on the winning side.
Barca,3din4p,elanciano31,5,Thu Jul 16 17:49:59 2015 UTC,"Well I'm assuming there are some feelings held, but you're right about Messi handling it professionally. There is no way a player like Messi would hold a grudge against a teammate who is competing for his country."
Barca,3din4p,RubxCuban,15,Thu Jul 16 18:02:48 2015 UTC,"I truly hope he can improve his concentration, he is an amazing keeper but he makes more mistakes than what a top goalkeeper should make.  Source: Several mistakes when playing with us, including two big ones on both finals of the copa del rey and the champions league. None of those two mistakes ended in a goal, so that's why probably no one remembers them. Had they both become goals and we had lost two cups, we would all remember those mistakes very well. I remember some mistakes from his time at BM as well.  Hopefully he'll fix this issue as he grows older, but for now I hope we keep trusting in Bravo for at least half of the games, competition has been working really well."
Barca,3din4p,godie,5,Thu Jul 16 19:21:40 2015 UTC,"Why are the mistakes always held against Ter Stegen, but never against Bravo? Bravo made quite a few mistakes as well.  Are Ter Stegen's mistakes more 'flashy'?  I'm not trying to attack you're statement or something, I'm just curious."

I'd give ter Stegen the Liga this time and I'd be VERY intransigent towards him. He makes 2 or 3 mistakes and he's dropped. Bravo makes a mistake himself and Ter Stegen comes back.

Barca,3dj9yw,MoneyForNothing_,11,Thu Jul 16 18:55:11 2015 UTC,Not making excuses for Lio because I know there were lots of factors that led to Argentina not winning but I read that Lio heard about his family being harassed during the half time break. I wonder if this contributed to his mind set at all during the second half of the game. I would assume so.

Barca,3djgum,IhateAngryBirds,13,Thu Jul 16 20:02:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is so bitter sweet. On one hand, it seems like La Masia is taking a backseat recently with all our signings the past couple years but, on the other, Pogba is one of the most promising players in the world. So conflicted. It's hard to dislike a move for a young world class player like him."
Barca,3djgum,Schadenfreudean_slip,7,Thu Jul 16 19:59:22 2015 UTC,"When players like Samper or Grimaldo don't impress Lucho, it's pretty much a lost cause.

Barca,3djgum,IhateAngryBirds,8,Thu Jul 16 20:04:19 2015 UTC,"I'm fucking frustrated about Samper and Grimaldo too. I always try to be optimistic, so I won't say it's a lost cause, but I'm right there with you on this."
Barca,3djgum,egcg119,9,Fri Jul 17 01:16:07 2015 UTC,"Our amazing run of youth over the last few years is not the norm, it is very much an anomaly. We will not produce players like Xavi, Messi, Piqué, Puyol, Cesc, Iniesta, Thiago, etc. every generation. To expect to is absurd.  If we don't have any Masia players in the squad it's not because the manager hates la Masia, or the board does, or Rosell is evil because we all hate Rosell, or Bartomeu is evil because we hate Rosell, it's because the Masia talents weren't good enough. And that's ok.  We had three Masia players start in the 2006 final. Two started in 1992. We won these finals because we bought players like Laudrup, Stoichkov, Koeman, Ronaldinho, Deco, Larsson, and Eto'o.   Is la Masia a point of pride? Of course, it's one of the finest academies in the world and I'd love to have successful players from there in the first team. But to insinuate that buying players instead of turning to the youth is somehow endemic to Lucho and this board, or not a core part of all of our successful teams, is ignorant and you're just looking for an excuse to beat up on the board.  I'd love to see Samper in the team. He's a fantastic talent and he's been here forever. But if we go out and get Pogba and he's a great player for us for a decade, that's not Lucho mistrusting the youth or the board being bad. That's Barcelona being Barcelona, the most successful team of the past 25 years.  Also, don't try and diminish /u/egcg119's opinion just because he commonly disagrees with you."

Barca,3djgum,agea,2,Thu Jul 16 23:41:49 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, how could I forget him especially."
Barca,3djgum,HippoNigga,7,Thu Jul 16 23:45:49 2015 UTC,"Ha I wasn't running around with my head cut off decrying the end of la masia producing talent, but judging by the amount of posts lately and presidential candidates saying just that....well you'll have to forgive me if I think this to be some quality election bullshit."
Barca,3djgum,elanciano31,6,Thu Jul 16 21:46:13 2015 UTC,"Thing is, in 03 Laporta promised Beckham. Ended up bringing Ronaldinho, Deco, Eto'o, ...  Lots of huge recruits, BUT, when there was a youngster that showed promise, he always had the best people around him (coaches at Barca B and earlier), in a sound environment managed by a great guy like Alexanko, and he always got the shot he needed with the first team.  So Laporta promising Pogba or even actually bringing him, though I'm not a big fan of that move, isn't scary in itself. He's still bringing Cruijff (who will talk to him about La Masia every single day), Alexanko, himself and all that stuff along.  He may be toughing up the competition for the youngsters to crack the first team by doing so, which isn't a good thing, but he won't tell guys like Samper to fuck off, which is basically what Bartomeu and Rosell have been doing."
Barca,3djgum,elmagio,0,Fri Jul 17 00:07:46 2015 UTC,himself and all that stuff along.   all that stuff like using club funds for personal use?
Barca,3djgum,elanciano31,3,Fri Jul 17 00:15:52 2015 UTC,"Considering the talent we have, it's not a good amount."
Barca,3djgum,flackohowyoubeen,12,Thu Jul 16 21:10:26 2015 UTC,"There is talent outside of our academy too. You can't expect a team as competitive as Barca right now to start 7+ graduates a game and remain at that level, something has to to give."
Barca,3djgum,MayIHaveAHug,10,Thu Jul 16 21:13:31 2015 UTC,I think this is what people don't understand. No academy in the world can create players like Xavi and Iniesta regularly so you can't expect a world class club to mainly consist of home grown talent.   In any case I don't like a Pogba transfer. I want Rafinha to take over.
Barca,3djgum,potatoe96,3,Thu Jul 16 21:23:43 2015 UTC,"Nobody expects Xavi's and Iniesta's on a regular basis either, but there reasons so many are shouting La Masia talent now, is because world class talent is there. They need to be utilized.  If we kept producing average players, fans would know that. But there is world class talent in our academy that can't be wasted. Some have even already been wasted.  This negative trend of excluding homegrown talent must stop."
Barca,3djgum,flackohowyoubeen,2,Thu Jul 16 22:11:01 2015 UTC,"Well Barca who has producing talents as one of its philosophies, should always look at talent inside the club when it's already there.  I don't expect Barca to start talents anymore. Not because the talents isn't there, but because the three coaches the last three seasons haven't given two shits about giving talents a real chance.  We should have more homegrown players in the first team, considering the players that have the ability. I'm not saying we should stop looking at strengthening the team by buying players from the outside, sometimes it's neccesary."
Barca,3djgum,flackohowyoubeen,4,Thu Jul 16 22:08:54 2015 UTC,"This shows that Laporta has a great relationship with Mino Raiola.   Mino Raiola, one of the sleaziest agents in Europe, the guy who publicly insulted Guardiola because he benched Ibra. The guy who orchestrates all the transfers of the worst mercenary in modern football. That guy.  He's a good friend of Laporta's.  I wonder how big a commission he promised to his good friend Mino Raiola if that deal ever happens?"

Barca,3djgum,Hadi420Swag,5,Thu Jul 16 19:42:10 2015 UTC,"Different levels. Pogba is for now and the future. Turan is for now. Honestly we don't need pogba, but I wouldn't mind having him on the squad. Only downside is blocking home grown talent."
Barca,3djgum,FCB_TB,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:09:19 2015 UTC,Thats a pretty huge downside isnt it? If we have to pay 100 mill then just let him develope at juve and pay that money later. His move this season wouldnt be good at all. esp since we got Turan. For the future who knows. by then likes of Rahinha will also prove he can be world class or no
Barca,3djgum,Hadi420Swag,0,Sat Jul 18 00:46:33 2015 UTC,It's more wise to wait and sign Veratti since his contract expires 2019.   Arda can give Barca 4-5 good year until then.
Barca,3djgum,Cambijao,7,Thu Jul 16 22:35:38 2015 UTC,"Wait and hope that 3 years from now he hasn't re-signed and we might be able to get him for ""cheap""? (Cheap is in quotes because it's PSG).  Arda is here to rotate with the young guns.  If we're waiting 4-5 years, I really hope we'll be playing the La Masia grads and not still shopping elsewhere for a mid."
Barca,3djgum,e_schlanzz,3,Thu Jul 16 23:11:50 2015 UTC,I thought we were done dealing with this asshat agent since Ibra. The fact that he's Pogba's agent is a big turnoff for me.
Barca,3djgum,Rouhani_9,0,Thu Jul 16 21:15:22 2015 UTC,The only La Masia player i'm really concerned about this hurting is Sergi Samper. IMO Samper has the potential to be one of the best midfielders ever. We can't fuck him up. He could be sooooooo good.
Barca,3djgum,OrangePaper7,-8,Thu Jul 16 22:00:54 2015 UTC,"Pogba doesn't fit in here, he doesn't have the skills to play here. He's overrated because he scored longshots, and he will cost way too much, and has too high wages.  It's also a big ''fuck you'' to La Masia.  edit: Cool to see people willing to discuss here."
Barca,3djgum,flackohowyoubeen,-3,Thu Jul 16 21:12:21 2015 UTC,"Why have 3 world class players in one position?  Unless Laporta is thinking of returning Turan to Atletico once he wins, it makes no sense.  I rather have Koke, or a proper replacement for Xavi, someone who is a metronome instead of more attacking midfielders."
Barca,3djgum,tadm123,4,Thu Jul 16 20:28:34 2015 UTC,SHUT UP ABOUT KOKE.  WE'RE NOT GETTING KOKE.  IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING.
Barca,3djgum,e_schlanzz,2,Thu Jul 16 23:13:41 2015 UTC,"Doesn't have to be Koke, but someone who dictates the tempo of the team, we need a natural CM to fill the void that Xavi left."
Barca,3djgum,tadm123,2,Thu Jul 16 23:16:09 2015 UTC,It's easier to mold a La Masia grad into that type of player than to wait for the perfect guy to appear on the market and throw money at him
Barca,3djgum,e_schlanzz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:25:14 2015 UTC,"Not really, developing talent is a lot harder and takes more time to do it than simply paying for 'superstars'..  I dont think you understood my point, im for La Masia, but if you tell me if we are going to spend big on someone , since that's how candidates get votes. Bringing pogba makes no sense since we just bought Turan,  and that the priority should be in bringing an actual CM. Right now we don't have any natural CM's in the squad."
Barca,3djgum,tadm123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:47:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think any purchase is necessary now that we have Arda.  Arda is versatile and can play in many positions.  And you're right, developing talent is harder and takes time, but we've put in the time.  There are a handful of players, the leader of that group being Rafinha, who have been developed and are right on the cusp of being good.  They just need more time in the team.  Also, what is your definition of an ""actual CM""?  If you were to ask me, and I'm sure many others would agree, Pogba fits the definition"
Barca,3djgum,e_schlanzz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:29:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Rafinha is another AM, this is why I was against the signing of Arda, since it will shun his chances of playing, and brining Pogba wil make it even more difficult for him  i dont mean to be a dick, but from Wikipedia   Central or centre midfielders are players whose role is divided roughly equally between attack and defence. These players will try to pass the ball to the team's attacking midfielders and forwards and may also help their team's attacks by making runs into the opposition's penalty area and attempting shots on goal themselves.   Pogba is more of an attacking midfielder, he and Turan operate in Iniesta's position. I belive Pirlo is the CM at Juventus with Pogba bombing forward constantly."
Barca,3djgum,tadm123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:23:47 2015 UTC,"Okay fair enough on the definition.  But in all reality, Arda is about the same as Xavi.  There is just no way he can consistently play 90 minutes week in and week out the rest of his career.  That's where rotation comes in. Arda will be slowly weaned minutes while the likes of Rafinha (hopefully) start to assimilate more and more into the team.  And don't even get me started on Arda's spirit and work ethic.  If he can help to instill that fire in our youth prospects...I'm getting too excited thinking about it.  Bottom line, I think the signing of Arda is a great one.  Stop pursuing Pogba (I think we agree on that) and let Arda and Iniesta teach these young guys a thing or too and we'll be just fine."
Barca,3djgum,e_schlanzz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:36:11 2015 UTC,"Arda has never played in Xavi's position man, he's an attacking midfielder who in Turkey shown that he can also play on the wings, he's pretty much a replica of Iniesta but with better work ethic.  But maybe Lucho plays him in that position, and makes him a makeshift CM like he did with Rakitic, who knows. Maybe he surprise me and ends up being fantastic in there, time will tell i gues."
Barca,3djgum,tadm123,2,Sat Jul 18 19:41:30 2015 UTC,Neither is Veratti but people still bitch about him constantly.
Barca,3djngn,Illegal_sal,4,Thu Jul 16 20:26:19 2015 UTC,"The crazy thing to me is, that we won 83% of matches, yet finished 2 points ahead of Real Madrid. Thinking about how many matches we won in the final few minutes in the first half of the season could have easily been a loss or a tie.  Even though they didn't win a trophy last year, they had an incredible year."
Barca,3djc42,Chillidawg,26,Thu Jul 16 19:03:32 2015 UTC,"What can I say, the man is a warrior, a general, an artist, and an ox.  He had an amazing season and was key to Barcelona hitting its stride with Luis Enrique's system and rotations. He is talented, flexible, and has good mix of aggression and finesse.  He often made a difference on the pitch and rarely made a mistake, he is very good at being physical without being too rough, rolling it back just enough.  As great as I think he is as a player, he has an even more special talent as a leader.  Everyone knows this, he has been Jefecito since he was a lad with a full head of hair, but he just has that something extra.  It's not just about what he does on the pitch.  When Barcelona was in ""crisis"" in January, there was one man to send out to the press conference, Masche.  He is direct, measured, and articulate -- a man with no patience for bullshit and he will tell you why.  He went out there and told the journalists straight up that if there was any strife with the team it was they themselves who had caused it, because they valued their own careers over the truth.  He said that they either printed lies knowingly or just didn't bother to find out if they were true or not, which is the same thing.  No one else could have done that.  I would love to know what went on in all those pitch-side meetings between Lucho and Mascherano throughout the season.    He is my pick to be the next great coach either for a club or Argentina."
Barca,3djc42,zazzlekdazzle,15,Thu Jul 16 19:15:40 2015 UTC,"I'll keep it simple, we bought 2 defensemen last year because Masch wasn't playing in his ""right position"". Well, he benched all other defensemen. I think his aggression is counter productive when he plays in at midfield (for barca). He gets caught chasing far too many times and I feel it throws the team balance off a little. I've always said this regarding Mascherano, he is simply too good of a footballer to keep on the bench. that's why, no matter what position you can fit him in, you do it and he ends up in the starting line up"

Barca,3djc42,Oliverz5,10,Fri Jul 17 10:14:31 2015 UTC,"Mascherano's the guy who, more often than not, doesn't celebrate a goal. He'll do a quick fistpump and run straight to the coach for instructions to give the team. He's the closest thing we've had to Puyol since the latter's retirement, and his leadership is a tremendous asset to this team.   His versatility is down to pure hard-work and tactical brilliance. I am very happy to have him on the squad and I genuinely hope he stays as long as possible."
Barca,3djc42,Rouhani_9,8,Thu Jul 16 21:21:10 2015 UTC,"We've all been saying 'who will be the next Puyol', when he's been right in front of us.   Seniority be damned, he should be a captain."
Barca,3djc42,BarcaJeremy4Gov,7,Fri Jul 17 03:10:13 2015 UTC,"EL JEFECITO !   The passion, grit, and no-nonsense attitude this man shows is very admirable. Hope he stays with us for quite a few more years, he has a lot to offer. Him and Piqué make a great centreback duo, and what he lacks in height, he makes up in spirit. A true culé."
Barca,3djc42,HippoNigga,5,Thu Jul 16 19:57:30 2015 UTC,"I miss Puyol's warrior spirit, but Mascherano has done wonders in keeping that spirit alive. He has been a key player ever since he was signed. I truly think many of the players look up to him, even though he is not a captain. Although the way he presents himself in games, you'd think otherwise."

I don't want to give up on him yet, but should soon imo. He's getting older, he's not THAT great, and he'd be blocking talents on the bench.   Perhaps this belongs in a unpopular opinon thread, but I think he's the weaklink in our defence. He isn't an ideal midfielder for this club either. I don't think he should leave yet, but I wouldn't be sad if he left.  :-)"

Barca,3djuqf,jorsias,21,Thu Jul 16 21:19:20 2015 UTC,"I think we'll be fine. We still have the same squad that won the treble just 6 weeks ago and most are well rested with no major tournaments for the European contingent.  In goal we have one of the best young keepers in the world vying for a spot against a veteran coming off a Copa America success.  At the back we've essentially gained Vermaelen and have extremely versatile players there, Bartra (CB/RB), Mathieu (CB/LB) Adriano (LB/RB), Masche (CM/DM), Verm (CB/LB).  Midfield has lost Xavi but Rakitic and Rafinha are now a year deep in their respective Barca first team careers, Busquets and Iniesta are well rested, Roberto is a jack of all trades in there and younger prospects like Samper and Halilovic can fill any minor minutes required until Arda is available.  Up top we have the greatest front three the games ever seen together and Pedro if he stays, otherwise Munir and Sandro or even Rafinha will be able deputies.  Overall I think we are still in great shape in both quality and depth which is incredible considering the ban and the efforts exerted last season."
Barca,3djuqf,ViscaBarca1899,3,Thu Jul 16 23:19:09 2015 UTC,I seriously hope that Halilovic gets some good minutes and establishes himself as a future first team player.
Barca,3djuqf,will888,2,Fri Jul 17 08:39:49 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that Luis Enrique wasn't impressed with the level of the Barca B squad, it's unlikely that we'll see many players come up other than Munir and Sandro. Dani Alvez is basically on his own at RB considering Montoya is gone and Vidal can't play, the midfield should be fine with rafinha and Sergi Roberto...The first team will do fine in the first half of the season, but all those minutes might have an effect on their form for the second leg of the season. Arda and Vidal coming on in the second leg will be good, but it'll be a few games before they get into a groove that helps significantly."
Barca,3djuqf,emsthename,7,Fri Jul 17 17:51:17 2015 UTC,I like the fact there aren't several new players to adjust. The team had a break (some more than others) and can come out swinging.
Barca,3djuqf,Barca8,6,Fri Jul 17 01:14:21 2015 UTC,"People wondered last year if we could win a trophy without a few winter transfers. We won a treble. We'll be just fine. I also heard some rumours that we're going to promote some Barca B players like Samper and Munir, so we should be covered."

Barca,3djuqf,godie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:00:15 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Of course, things could go wrong, but it's typical for Barca fans to do this: be absolutely terrified before the season even started properly. I used last season as an example, we should wait and see which Barca B players get promoted before we freak out about possible injuries."
Barca,3djuqf,Mzxth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:49:36 2015 UTC,Yeah but That was last year. We had luck that critical players didn't get injury. Remember when Messi got injured and we lost for Bayern?
Barca,3djuqf,Mzxth,5,Thu Jul 16 21:27:21 2015 UTC,"The loss to Bayern had more causes than Messi's injury alone. If one or two of our players get injured, we have Barca B players to replace them temporarily. I'm not all that worried."

Barca,3djdq4,Kid_Cule,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:57:51 2015 UTC,Do they sell just the practice session tickets or is it apart of a package? Sorry I checked and idk where else to look
Barca,3djdq4,GrayFawkes,2,Thu Jul 16 21:37:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's only the package deal, I sent an email asking if they will sell tickets to the training separately. I'm waiting for the reply."
Barca,3djdq4,GrayFawkes,2,Thu Jul 16 21:49:40 2015 UTC,So I never got a reply but if you look here it sas the training the night before is open to the public.  http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/detail/article/fc-barcelona-s-summer-tour-up-close

Barca,3diud9,altum,9,Thu Jul 16 16:55:51 2015 UTC,Random but still every year everyone complains about how it's fixed (to their disadvantage)

Barca,3diud9,YoSoyMilkChocolate,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:31:02 2015 UTC,Don't quote me on this but I think it's random. The fixtures are randomly generated.

Barca,3dhgmc,Football_Enthusiast,18,Thu Jul 16 08:36:18 2015 UTC,No flair is gonna be added.
Barca,3dhgmc,svefnpurka,3,Thu Jul 16 08:46:54 2015 UTC,I was kind of hoping for the inclusion of flair but its alright.
Barca,3dhgmc,brocccoli,9,Thu Jul 16 09:45:19 2015 UTC,This comes up a couple of times during the season. But we've discussed it several times and the outcome is always the same. All the mods are against it and most sub users too. Basically it comes down to two things: Keeping the sub clean and having the focus on discussions and not individual users and their flairs.
Barca,3dhgmc,Andman22,2,Thu Jul 16 12:11:18 2015 UTC,"I understand your point, alright let's forget about adding flair."
Barca,3dhgmc,kezorN,2,Thu Jul 16 16:47:33 2015 UTC,"Also, what would the flair actually be, a player face or something, maybe their number?  I agree, it would easily get messi and not add any real value.  I support Barca and I wouldn't want my favorite player to distract from that."
Barca,3dhgmc,pradeep23,5,Thu Jul 16 12:46:24 2015 UTC,get messi
Barca,3dhgmc,brocccoli,5,Thu Jul 16 14:51:17 2015 UTC,"There was a post on /r/Soccer about club subreddits.   Have a look at    r/reddevils   r/SaintsFC : Thanks to u/Pillock69 r/Juve Specially r/Galatasaray    I guess when you guys wanna make some major changes, do look at these subreddits. Specially Galatasaray player info on the left."
Barca,3dhgmc,pradeep23,11,Thu Jul 16 13:31:39 2015 UTC,"reddevils looks nice. Clean and simple. Though I rather have the info visible in the sidebar instead of having to mouse-over it.  saintsFC has lots of nice stuff but the pictures of the players, the stats and the ""most recent starting XI"" seem irrelevant to me. Just distracting.   Juve looks superclean, bit unusual with the black but it's a nice touch and makes sense for Juve I guess.  Galatasaray looks weird. Very distracting background image when scrolling down. Players on the left is a nice idea but (sorry if this sounds insulting) most sub users should know their players, I don't need to see their faces all the time I'm on the subreddit. From a design/usability perspective it's super distracting to have faces staring at you all the time.   If you'd remove the background picture and the faces on the left side you'd end up with one of nicest/cleanest subs out there.  As conclusion I'd say a football sub should:  -be clean, no cluttering  -have important stuff easily visible (latest games, upcoming fixtures, table)  -focus on threads/content  -focus on discussion not on images/videos/tweets (stuff you can look up on other sites easily)  -have submission rules and apply them  -have compilation threads instead of 10 different threads about the same topic  -instant ban trolls and abusive users (and spammers, there's sooo many that go unnoticed in other subs)  -mods are users and interact accordingly  -quality content by users should be encouraged and pushed  (just my point of view as a user not a mod)"
Barca,3dhgmc,brocccoli,3,Thu Jul 16 14:02:35 2015 UTC,"MU subreddit looks good but my favorite is the Juve one, probably the design was inspired by minimalist concept and looks really clean, simple and clutter free which I like a lot. And I also agree with the points that you've mentioned."
Barca,3dhgmc,OrangePaper7,2,Thu Jul 16 16:54:19 2015 UTC,Players on the left is a nice idea but (sorry if this sounds insulting) most sub users should know their players : Yes I guess I agree with you on this one. I guess I got carried away. It may make sense for smaller club to put up things like player info. Not so much for the bigger ones.    Too much cluttering might not help. Clean and simple is a good idea.
Barca,3dhgmc,Andman22,2,Thu Jul 16 14:48:15 2015 UTC,Exactly that's what I meant. So for most new sub users and fans from other teams it's great to have the infos on the players there. But for a big club I think there is enough other quality content around to focus on instead of the basic infos from players.
Barca,3dhgmc,Chillidawg,3,Thu Jul 16 14:51:22 2015 UTC,"/r/galatasaray looks really cluttered to me....   Also, not as the main inspiration behind any redesign, but I would LOVE to see some elements of /r/minimalism into this sub. Also, /r/interstellar has a beautiful design."
Barca,3dhgmc,pradeep23,3,Thu Jul 16 18:02:48 2015 UTC,"I really like how clean r/Juve looks.  The greyed out top bar is a nice touch, and the information in the right column fits together well.  Their wiki page that holds all of their trophies and also a map of Italy with other subreddits is pretty cool."
Barca,3dhgmc,Dinogur,2,Thu Jul 16 19:37:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think Barca and Juve is the nicest of these. reddevils is just too... much?"
Barca,3dhgmc,pillock69,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:17:50 2015 UTC,Probably yes. Though we could incorporate things from others too.
Barca,3dhgmc,pradeep23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:10:59 2015 UTC,"I love the change /r/reddevils went through on their sub, the sub went from semi ugly to slick and clean!  Id want something slick and clean"
Barca,3dhgmc,pillock69,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:30:23 2015 UTC,"Ooh you like our design? That's quite nice to hear.   I should probably subscribe to this subreddit actually, I go to Camp Nou often enough."

However, it is about time to have a banner contest. I won't be around, but maybe the other mods will set it up.  I think we should leave it stickied (the contest) for a couple of weeks, so that it gets as much exposure as possible during these slow months. Maybe open the contest and set a two week deadline for submissions based on next year's kit."

Barca,3dfol7,HippoNigga,19,Wed Jul 15 23:18:57 2015 UTC,"Valencia really want to sign him, but I think VV said he would never play for another team in Spain, except Barcelona.   I have a hunch that he will join an MLS team."
Barca,3dfol7,deadhunters,9,Wed Jul 15 23:22:02 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see him in Roma, last year their goalkeeper sucked"
Barca,3dfol7,HippoNigga,18,Thu Jul 16 01:04:18 2015 UTC,"Shit, I hope he doesn't, no offence to the MLS. He still has much to offer. France and Germany would be good choices for him, I'd think."
Barca,3dfol7,Aj16ay,18,Wed Jul 15 23:24:21 2015 UTC,I'd love to see him at Everton if they could afford his wages. Between him and Deulo I don't think I'd want to miss a single Everton match next season

Barca,3dfol7,egcg119,24,Thu Jul 16 03:28:43 2015 UTC,"He was certainly the best keeper in Spain - well, maybe tied with Courtois -, probably second only to Neuer in the world. 2013/14 Valdes was absurd."
Barca,3dfol7,decho,10,Thu Jul 16 04:31:22 2015 UTC,He kept Barcelona in the title race that season and had he not been injured Barca would have had a better chance in winning at least one title. That was how good his form was.
Barca,3dfol7,froggerhasmelikewoah,23,Thu Jul 16 06:05:33 2015 UTC,"He mentions Valdés wasn't willing to play for the U21 team. That's quite a stupid move from Valdés' part if you ask me. They gave him a place to regain his fitness, even reward him with a contract and then he acts like a diva when he's asked to keep his rhythm by playing for the U21s. Everyone else did it, Rafael, Van Persie, Falcao, Di Maria, so why should he recieve special treatment?"
Barca,3dfol7,kr117,35,Wed Jul 15 22:50:34 2015 UTC,"Copying what I said from /r/soccer  I seem to remember Valdes playing with the second team quite a bit last season. And if he refused, why have we not heard about it till now? That's the sort of thing that would be fairly obvious and make the papers quickly. Besides, it's not like LVG to be secretive. So why wait till now to speak?  I think there's more to this than LVG is saying. If Valdes was sent to the reserves THIS summer, after a full year of recuperation, he has every right to refuse and be upset. Or perhaps it's just that Valdes confronted Van Gaal about the De Gea situation and wanted to know about his future, and the coach didn't like it. But I do not fucking believe that Van Gaal is making this big public statement suddenly about something that happened months ago."
Barca,3dfol7,kezorN,14,Thu Jul 16 00:29:17 2015 UTC,"Van Gaal has a history of having conflicts with his players since long long time ago. He tends to present himself as careless and honest throughout the media, but I wouldn't buy it.  One thing is for sure - until we read more about this we wouldn't know the full details of this ""story"". Like you implied in your comment, I can too sense that this might have been a long time thing."

Barca,3dhs4g,Illegal_sal,4,Thu Jul 16 11:24:28 2015 UTC,Am I the only one happy that all the hard away games get over in the first half of the season? I think the second half of the season is gonna be amazing since we will have Arda and Vidal to start with and home games against the good teams.
Barca,3dhs4g,potatoe96,4,Thu Jul 16 15:49:12 2015 UTC,"Stopped reading after this:   ""It seems they want us to lose the league,"" was a comment overheard at the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper.  This phrase shows the players are angry, ..."
Barca,3dhs4g,brocccoli,3,Thu Jul 16 12:01:06 2015 UTC,"was a comment overheard   HAHA, wow are they serious? Doesn't get anymore bullshitty than this.   Yeah we don't have any actual proof of any kind that this was said and no quotes either, but we're going to put this line of text into quotation marks and pretend that we do. And then we're gonna make an article about it!  Pathetic."
Barca,3dhs4g,kezorN,2,Thu Jul 16 16:29:20 2015 UTC,"I think tough fixtures at the beginning is much better because the end of the season is always incredibly demanding with important CL and Copa del Rey games almost every week. If Barcelona has to send out a weaker team to play the fourth placed team in the CL, then so be it. At the end of the day, the fixture draw is an excuse teams use to explain away bad performances."
Barca,3dhs4g,Barcalaw30,3,Thu Jul 16 19:14:00 2015 UTC,Who cares who you draw when you are the best? To us it's just another team. We will prove that the Treble was well deserved.

Barca,3de2yq,Illegal_sal,10,Wed Jul 15 15:31:18 2015 UTC,"Benedito really shot himself in the foot with this one. By providing this shady new company as an alternative to Qatar Airways, you hardly prove a point to the voters."
Barca,3de2yq,Dookie232,11,Wed Jul 15 18:07:49 2015 UTC,Actually he proved that Bartomeu was lying saying no other company could match Qatars offer.
Barca,3de2yq,IhateAngryBirds,7,Wed Jul 15 19:03:17 2015 UTC,"What? How does this prove that? Benedito can claim all he wants, but a company incorporated today claiming to provide a 70m shirt sponsor is extremely sketchy, and certainly not a realistic alternative."
Barca,3de2yq,egcg119,2,Wed Jul 15 20:13:39 2015 UTC,"It was enough for Barto to say he'd found a company willing to pay more than Qatar. Regardless of what Benedito did to himself, he really altered Barto's game plan - which is huge."
Barca,3de2yq,Semperty,3,Thu Jul 16 01:54:27 2015 UTC,"Why? How do you know they haven't been heavily invested into by holding groups, venture capitalists, conglomerates, etc. they're getting hella publicity just from this, and being in the energy drink game, I'm assuming majority of money is spend on advertisement/PR.  I'm not saying they're legit, but it's not as sketchy as everyone is making it out to be.  Not every company starts a business with 0 capital, and businesses can start negotiations before incorporating."
Barca,3de2yq,cadrianzen23,8,Wed Jul 15 20:38:08 2015 UTC,"So much for 'Qatar is offering the most cash out of any sponsor'. Myth busted.  But even then, it doesn't matter since Qatar Airways' contract has a clause where they have priotity, i.e they can stay if they offer 80 millions + 1 euro.  Also, I don't know a single thing about this product and Google is being stubborn with me. Is this a Red Bull offshoot?"
Barca,3de2yq,CorsarioNero,4,Wed Jul 15 16:47:26 2015 UTC,From my understanding the energy drink started shipping this year. I provided a link if you want to check out the website.

The 5th result is about Benedito himself promoting this deal. The most info I've seen is that they are a group of Hindu capitalists, and nothing else.  Maybe they're cool, but maybe they're another Pandora's box waiting to be opened."
Barca,3de2yq,Chunky_mono,13,Wed Jul 15 17:02:07 2015 UTC,They are a new company and Benedito is giving them free publicity. His not going to win. It's a publicity stunt.

Barca,3de2yq,det0xx,2,Thu Jul 16 04:26:29 2015 UTC,if they offer 80 millions + 1 euro.   They would have to do a lot more than try to renew the sponsorship on a technicality and I have a feeling that the sponsor change (and any subsequent matching/beating offers from Qatar) will be submitted to a vote.

Barca,3ddol1,Illegal_sal,23,Wed Jul 15 13:35:59 2015 UTC,"Just make it 6 years and you can add Ronaldo, Kaka and Benzema (very conveniently they ignored it)"
Barca,3ddol1,kassim254,40,Wed Jul 15 16:02:38 2015 UTC,"They sold Higuain for 40m. We sold Alexis for less after his good performance in the world cup. They offloaded Morata for 20m. We'd never get that for Tello. They managed to get money even for Albiol. The numbers are sometimes hard to believe.  One difference is that Madrid don't care about their players, so they can maximize profit. We sold Villa to Atletico for peanuts in respect for the player's wish. But it's hard to find an explanation that does not also involve board incompetence.  Forgot to mention Di Maria. That was some robbery in hindsight, 80m for the phenomenon of just half a season."
Barca,3ddol1,2015treble,6,Wed Jul 15 14:35:56 2015 UTC,"Yup Barca is probably the worst team in europe when it comes to their prowess in the transfer market. Overpay and undersell basically every player they ever deal with. Have we ever, at least in recent memory, sold a player for more than we paid? If there were some actual businessmen doing the deals Barca would be unstoppable with all that extra cash available for transfers."
Barca,3ddol1,MyKillK,17,Thu Jul 16 00:29:05 2015 UTC,"They offloaded Morata for 20m. We'd never get that for Tello   To be fair, Morata became a starter for the Champions League finalists and Italian champions."
Barca,3ddol1,jklz,20,Wed Jul 15 15:00:32 2015 UTC,"It is true that he turned out a fine player, but if I remember correctly, and feel free to correct me, he was looking quite poor towards his end at Madrid.   Tello has some good periods for us. He was a good finisher, scored that hattrick in the away game with Messi's assists."
Barca,3ddol1,2015treble,5,Wed Jul 15 15:39:20 2015 UTC,"I think it also has something to do with our previous youth products sold didn't take the world by storm. I'm thinking Bojan. So yeah its hard getting a price for them. Also, it comes down to which buying club is looking and for what position. juve really wanted CF"
Barca,3ddol1,tramp_oline321,7,Wed Jul 15 16:35:56 2015 UTC,"That's because Rafa Benitez decided to throw Napoli's money at RM players. He got Pippa, Callejon, and Albiol and paid around 60-70 mil. Some would say one of the reasons he was picked for the RM job, as a thank you."
Barca,3ddol1,jairzinho,7,Wed Jul 15 16:22:55 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference is our transfer ban, we had to prepare for a lengthy 2 years. And plus we got Suarez, the best striker in the world. Both ney and Suarez cost a shit ton of money."

Barca,3ddol1,iVarun,2,Thu Jul 16 04:28:58 2015 UTC,The other thing is we don't consistently fuck up with our treatment of club legends and convince our fanbase that Rafa is a better coach than Ancelotti.  No club is perfect and it may be true that we have spent a lot over the past couple of years and not gotten a big return on sales.  Pep was the first to bring such a heavy emphasis of youth academy players.  Look at the cost and the effectiveness of the BBC vs MSN and then tell me if you still don't like how much money we've spent.
Barca,3ddol1,e_schlanzz,4,Wed Jul 15 14:41:12 2015 UTC,I don't know where you got the idea of me not liking money spent on MSN from. I'm not against paying big money for world-class players. I am against not making good deals when we transfer players to other teams.

Barca,3ddol1,broncosrb26,7,Wed Jul 15 20:11:29 2015 UTC,"We also went on the transfer spree right before the ban, spending at least €120 million."
Barca,3ddol1,SuperZero42,2,Wed Jul 15 14:48:28 2015 UTC,"a few things factor into that, our numbers seem a bit high because we just purchased Neymar+Suarez for 180M. We are always bad sellers. the worrying thing is, if you compare the last 10 years, Madrid have net spent way more than us, which to me shows the effect of rosell and barto's regime on La masia and how the club is moving more and more towards the Madrid Model than what made us really successful"
Barca,3ddol1,domi_28,3,Wed Jul 15 15:19:05 2015 UTC,"The thing is... Because of Rosells and barto's regime we have IMO the best front 3 ever.  I don't like them, but we also can't take that away from them."
Barca,3ddol1,lelieth9,3,Wed Jul 15 16:36:14 2015 UTC,"this to me is a completely misleading statement. Both Suarez and Neymar DREAMED of playing for us, the only thing Barto did is over pay for the two and get us numerous law suits. My problem is not with buying a star player that fits every now and then, my problem is with the team absolutely NEEDING these players along with many other signings. Soon our starting 11 will have Pique, Messi and maybe iniesta as the only 3 La Masia players."

Anyone walking by could stop and watch the training.  Since Barcelona built a modern sports complex, they no longer train (afaik) at the field next to La Masia, and I'm not sure they let people in to attend regular training sessions. They have one a year where kids and parents are invited. It was that training that Leo missed after the Anoeta game that played into the ""crisis"" between him and Lucho."

Barca,3ddwmp,flackohowyoubeen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:40:34 2015 UTC,"Yea I read that, I really don't get that. Why play Mathieu in a position that he is not good at? Is it just so Lucho can justify the buy? Why not let Grimaldo train with the first team and learn from the best? (Alba/Alves) He could still get a decent amount of time vs. small teams in the league, Alba needs rest too. I mean Adriano got 1100 minutes last season, and Grimaldo is IMO better than Adriano. Wouldn't 1100+ Barca first team minutes be valuable?  So many questions.. I'm not against loaning Grimaldo out, because he needs experience with La Liga, but if it means putting Mathieu on LB instead, then I just don't get it.  Mathieu is good at CB, and he should be the rotation for Piqué/Masch along with Bartra, we don't even need Vermalen tbh.  Sigh."

Barca,3de6u4,zazzlekdazzle,2,Wed Jul 15 18:39:24 2015 UTC,"Number one has to be either Simeone or Enrique. Relative performance or trophies.

Barca,3ddcjn,HippoNigga,4,Wed Jul 15 14:31:35 2015 UTC,Roma fan here - we really don't want him (no disrespect). We have a plethora of midfielders and would likely need to sell Romagnoli to fund this transfer. Definitely BS regardless.
Barca,3ddcjn,LillehammerUSA,10,Wed Jul 15 13:50:32 2015 UTC,Mascherano should be considered a CB now and a world class one at that. Your club would definitely want him if they could get him. He would easily be the best defender on your team.
Barca,3ddcjn,bricebru22,4,Wed Jul 15 14:02:00 2015 UTC,I can't argue with that but he would certainly demand a high wage. Additionally Romagnoli is a product of our youth system who would likely be sold to Milan if anything. We would rather not sell a future potential captain (to a rivaling Serie A team at that) to finance this move.
Barca,3ddcjn,LillehammerUSA,2,Wed Jul 15 14:12:36 2015 UTC,"true, this move makes no sense for Roma, Romagnoli should be priority"

Barca,3dcu54,jklz,6,Wed Jul 15 07:14:26 2015 UTC,"One of the best talents at La Masia, promoted to Juvenil A at age 15 (could've still played for Cadete A). Didn't get any playing time whatsoever throughout the season and now that has cost the club his talents..   A huge shame, hopefully he can become the star he is capable of becoming."
Barca,3dcu54,Cyssero,2,Wed Jul 15 07:19:40 2015 UTC,As a non-Barca fan are there any more details as to why he wasn't getting playing time?
Barca,3dcu54,elmagio,3,Wed Jul 15 10:59:17 2015 UTC,"Injured early in the season, probably too young/raw for Vinyals' liking. I honestly don't really know..  A case of poor management though. He only just turned 17. He could've played for Juvenil B or even Cadete A in the last season; that probably would've guaranteed him staying at the club."
Barca,3dcu54,elmagio,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:04:47 2015 UTC,"That would have been better management, but I don't know if he would have stayed anyway...  I think so many Masia talents want to leave because they see the club doesn't count on La Masia as much now, they know even if they perform (like Samper, Grimaldo, ...), they'll still be overlooked and shinier (but not better) players will be bought from someplace else.  We're lucky a guy like Lee is somewhat arrogant, by the way, that way he has way too much confidence in himself to imagine the club won't count on him and we can only hope the club will be sorted out soon enough..."
Barca,3dcu54,Duke--Nukem,2,Wed Jul 15 13:00:23 2015 UTC,Playing roughly 600-900 minutes through out the entire season with Juvenil A compared to roughly 3000 minutes with Juvenil B is a huge difference though. I definitely think that would have made a difference.

As for autographs, they don't usually sign before training sessions, but rather after them. Same with matches. Try to be a bit more obscure and have a sign calling a ""less known"" player over, like Samper, Munir, Bartra. Might get their attention easier than going for the big stars :)"
Barca,3dcnzs,IhateAngryBirds,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:32:12 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, how do you know those players won't be playing?

Barca,3db06h,zero237,25,Tue Jul 14 21:45:31 2015 UTC,Why the hell does FIFA think they have authority over things they aren't even part of? As far as I know both the friendlies and the Gamper match aren't FIFA sanctioned so there's nothing they can do about it.
Barca,3db06h,Blanchimont,8,Tue Jul 14 21:53:29 2015 UTC,"I randomly found this thing called ""Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players""  Obviously I'm not gonna read the whole thing and I could be wrong, but if you go to page #5 bullet #5, it says:   Official matches: matches played within the framework of organised  football, such as national league championships, national cups and  international championships for clubs, but not including friendly and  trial matches.   Originally I thought you're probably wrong and FIFA monitors even friendlies, but I guess you're probably right. If someone wants to add something or correct me - feel free to do so.  http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/regulations_on_the_status_and_transfer_of_players_en_33410.pdf"

Barca,3db06h,FCB_TB,3,Wed Jul 15 04:39:17 2015 UTC,Seems to be gaining steam so maybe they will miss out. It's not exactly the end of the world should they not be able to play anyway.
Barca,3db06h,ViscaBarca1899,2,Wed Jul 15 05:27:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know. The kids who are/were affected by the ban like Lee and Bobby Adekanye were at first allowed to play friendlies too, but not anymore for some messed up reason."
Barca,3db06h,jklz,4,Wed Jul 15 07:15:56 2015 UTC,"Of course they can.  This is just another bait article by MD who, like most other sites/magazines, are running out of shit to write about.   Suárez did last year with his FIFA ban, why would this be different? A banned player can, but players who aren't banned can't? It would make no sense, even for FIFA."
Barca,3daeul,xTommy2016x,24,Tue Jul 14 19:18:13 2015 UTC,"1) He's clearly declined, and anyone who tells you otherwise is in denial.  2) He is still a quality player. He's a workhorse, a decent finisher, and his time at Barça means that his linkup play and movement is better than 90% of forwards out there. He cannot dribble a defender, and he is not great against a parked bus - he thrives on open space to run into.  3) From Barça's point of view, that manager wants to keep him but ultimately it's his decision -  we'll get by okay without him, now that Aleix Vidal and Arda Turan have been signed.  4) From Chelsea's point of view, he's not a clear upgrade over Willian. He's not worse, either, I think they're comparable players and would fight for a spot. He's a Mourinho-type player to the core, though, as much as it pains me to say it."
Barca,3daeul,egcg119,9,Tue Jul 14 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use the word declined, he's been benched and lost form."
Barca,3daeul,gblr,7,Wed Jul 15 02:06:44 2015 UTC,"He wasn't benched in 11/12, 12/13, or 13/14. He had players he could compete with who were benchable - Alexis, Cesc, Villa, first-season Neymar - and he didn't perform. Pedro's last good season was 10/11."
Barca,3daeul,egcg119,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:13:02 2015 UTC,"i could argue that the last season 2013-2014 he was playing well, up untill the whole team started colapsing   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRgxEKERums&feature=youtu.be"

Barca,3daeul,XsTream23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:57:09 2015 UTC,The nest Pedro we've ever had still isn't as good as Neymar or Suarez last season
Barca,3daeul,gblr,-1,Wed Jul 15 02:14:27 2015 UTC,"Did you miss all of what I just said? I'm not talking about last season, I'm talking about the three seasons prior.  Peaked in 10/11, and hasn't been remotely near that level since, long before Neymar and Suarez made it impossible for him to get minutes. That's the definition of decline."
Barca,3daeul,egcg119,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:34:25 2015 UTC,"Do you think there's a reason for that ? I agree with you, in regard of him declining since the 2010/2011 season, but why do you think that is ? I sometimes think about it but I can't really figure it out."
Barca,3daeul,HippoNigga,4,Wed Jul 15 02:51:46 2015 UTC,"Confidence, partially. Think it's cyclical, you start to play bad, more competition comes in, you play worse, you get benched, etc.  But mostly I think it's that Pedro was the ultimate team player. Since 2011, Barça has become increasingly individualistic. In 11/12 it was with Messi scoring 80 bajillion goals - the game-plan was simply to give the ball to Messi. In 12/13 the team was back a bit, but still heavily dependent on Messi and lacking a lot of the structure we had under Pep. Attack attack attack, but less cohesion.  In 13/14 it was more counter-attacking and more individualistic still, but he was also up against Neymar and an Alexis who finally came into his own. And in 14/15 the most important trait in a forward was their ability to dribble players, which Pedro flat-out cannot do.  TL;DR: He was the perfect player for Pep's system. Outside of that system, he doesn't look as good a player, which in turn meant he lost confidence."
Barca,3daeul,egcg119,2,Wed Jul 15 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, has a lot to do with the system as well as his own personal decline and lack of confidence. Thanks for the reply !"
Barca,3daeul,HippoNigga,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:57:34 2015 UTC,"Pretty much spot on but i would just add that, if he were to hit his 2011 form again (which is definitely possible), he would be a very clear upgrade over willian"
Barca,3daeul,DivineVibrations,18,Wed Jul 15 14:10:37 2015 UTC,"He didn't have much playing time last season due to MSN. However, it's clear he is still very good (look for his bicycle kick versus Real Sociedad, for example) and every time he came in he played his heart out. The only reason for him to have declined a little is simply lack of playing time. So yes, he would be a very good purchase. First team material for basically any team, I'd say.  As to your other question, I personally don't like Chelsea, so I wouldn't like him joining you guys. Don't know how Barça fans as a whole feel about this, though."
Barca,3daeul,iagolima,13,Tue Jul 14 19:33:31 2015 UTC,Generally I'm ok with him going to any club but Chelsea
Barca,3daeul,Brompton_Cocktail,7,Tue Jul 14 22:45:43 2015 UTC,Yep...but I respect this guy so much. I kinda just want him to be happy.

Barca,3daeul,romanmoses,2,Wed Jul 15 04:54:37 2015 UTC,I'm not very good at analysis but in my unproffesional opinion I think he's still incredible and an amazing (while not entirely equal) substitute for any in our front line. He works very well in the team and it's nice to see him play once in a while because while Neymar and Suarez have extreme strengths and some weakness I feel Pedro is all around balanced
Barca,3daeul,T_Peg,2,Wed Jul 15 04:33:09 2015 UTC,"Another Chelsea fan here, how do you think he compares to Sanchez?"
Barca,3daeul,NabbyH,2,Wed Jul 15 13:12:14 2015 UTC,Not as good 1v1 as Sanchez. Pedro has far superior vision and passing ability though. Pedro's speed and passing are really fantastic. He puts in more work defensively and is perhaps a little more team oriented. He is a very true La Masia winger
Barca,3daeul,zrizzoz,2,Wed Jul 15 16:04:48 2015 UTC,"He is quick, technical, hard working, has great physique and movement off the ball and is very much able to contribute defensively.  He is as good as any player in PL and is not playing only because Neymar and Suárez are simply miles better. Hell, I don't want him to leave if that's what you're asking."
Barca,3daeul,alterpsyche,6,Wed Jul 15 13:24:27 2015 UTC,"I think he's an upgrade. I don't watch a whole lot of Chelsea but I don't think Willian is as much of a scoring asset as Pedro is.  Where I don't see a huge difference between the two is speed and pressure. They both are very quick and hassle the opposition to no end which is a great asset, especially for Mourinho."
Barca,3daeul,Marchisio,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:56:41 2015 UTC,"I started watching Barca during the 2009-10 season and Pedro was my first favorite player. Truly a joy to watch play the game. He runs around like a mad man, has a nose for the goal, and gives 110% every time he touches the pitch. Was truly gutted to see him go. Enjoy what you have!"

Barca,3d9r1r,kirkrikster,3,Tue Jul 14 18:20:59 2015 UTC,"I like to think Dinho-Eto-Giuly was the precursor event. Even the article touches on this a bit. Not legendary sure but that was part of the continued line.    Rjikard's best time had the team playing a fluid 433.    Still remember those long aerial diagonals from Dinho from left flank on the halway-line of the pitch to Guily on the right corner flag trapping the ball above his head with his right foot, haha. One of many pleasant memories etched from Rjikard's time."
Barca,3d8ykc,StaleMilkNothingTher,12,Tue Jul 14 12:53:02 2015 UTC,"I know this might be an unpopular opinion, but I think I can live with any outcome of the Pedro situation. If he stays, he's a hell of a player who's only 27 and very versatile. if he leaves, its a good sum of money in return, younger B players get a chance to play and Pedro gets his wish of more playing time (which he totally deserves)"
Barca,3d8ykc,domi_28,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:32:11 2015 UTC,yep. Either way would work out well for both players and it really wouldn't bother me too much if he left as I believe he's more than good enough to be a starter elsewhere and deserves the play time. I just don't want to see him go to Chelsea. fuck that.
Barca,3d8ykc,-Token,7,Wed Jul 15 02:42:44 2015 UTC,"Barça fans don't want to see him leave, but I can understand it, while I hope he doesn't do it. He has enough quality to be in the starting 11 of almost any team in the world and here he will play even fewer minutes than last year due to Vidal and Arda coming in January (both can play in attacking positions). It's gonna be a long 5 months hoping the MSN doesn't even catch a cold if he leaves, as Munir or Sandro are far from his level but if I were him, I'd probably sign for a top Premier club."
Barca,3d8ykc,frasier_crane,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:58:55 2015 UTC,"IMO Vidal will most certainly be first choice at RB. Alves is 32, I highly doubt he can play another grueling season like that. It's time to get younger in defense."

But besides the fact that Arda Turan and Vidal will be missing here the good things about this:   Arda and Aleix wouldn't be fully integrated in the team by then anyway.

Barca,3d8zgk,invice,7,Tue Jul 14 15:38:09 2015 UTC,"we have to face all the teams before January man. The first legs generally get completed in this year itself. It is pretty impossible to not give us these five teams before January. Only two first leg matches are scheduled to happen in January, so it would have been very lucky if both were against strong teams."
Barca,3d8zgk,domi_28,5,Tue Jul 14 16:10:51 2015 UTC,all five teams AWAY though?
Barca,3d8zgk,invice,7,Tue Jul 14 16:36:57 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry, did not see that you were focussing on the away element in these fixtures. Then I agree with you. But it can be said that it is better to get over away fixtures as early as possible, facing them in March and April is tiresome. At least right now our squad is fit and strong, by then exhaustion will overpower them. To get done with these fixtures in the first half could be better you know."
Barca,3d8zgk,ss4444gogeta,4,Tue Jul 14 16:52:24 2015 UTC,"Is that really so bad? Barça usually has a strong fall, and they've got a treble-winning system in place. Better to have an easier second half with fresh legs being eased in as European competition picks up."
Barca,3d8o11,Acquits,15,Tue Jul 14 10:56:06 2015 UTC,"At this point, no matter how much we love Pedro or how much he's done for the club, it would be selfish to insist that he stay. He's loyal, he's proved that much, but there's also a line between loyalty and your career.  Pedro is a fine footballer with dedication. When I watch him play and he explodes down the right hand side, I wonder why he's not a starter, but we obviously know why. If he wants to go, he has every right and honestly, I'd be happy for him. He deserves to be a starter somewhere and enjoy consistent football."
Barca,3d8o11,Hawkguy67,5,Tue Jul 14 16:09:35 2015 UTC,It would be good business to sell him according to me. Neymar/Suarez look totally pissed off with Lucho if they are subbed. And we have history of playing one of the midfielders in one position in the front three in case of any injury.  What about Munir? He can play instead of Pedro. It would be total bollocks to talk about La Masia and doing nothing about it.
Barca,3d8o11,PerfectGentleman,3,Tue Jul 14 10:58:18 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason the team performed so well in the second half of the season is because Lucho was willing to make difficult subs in the first half with rotations. I don't think Lucho is going to make as much rotations this next season, but I expect him to continue that trend. In that case, I think having Pedro versus Munir is a no-brainer.   Of course, Pedro deserves more than that and I think it would be better for him as a player to go to another team."
Barca,3d8o11,potatoe96,4,Tue Jul 14 16:12:48 2015 UTC,Exactly. I think Pedro leaving will leave the spot open for Munir or Sandro.
Barca,3d8o11,joesugarman,2,Tue Jul 14 12:33:24 2015 UTC,"I too agree a little. Pedro has already made it. He deserves to be a starter or at least have a real shot at it. There is no way he can beat ney or lucho for a spot consistently.  Also our young bucks deserve a chance to grow, it's not like we don't have talent coming up.  When pedro became a solid started, he was a rotating sub fighting for that spot vs jeffren, many thought jeffren would be better. But clearly that wasn't the case.   It would be good business for both clubs involved and for the player in my opinion."
Barca,3d8o11,passion4indiegames,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:03:46 2015 UTC,"Abi, as much as we love you, but I really don't think you should be the next Barca's sport director.  sometimes one have to leave to give the youth a chance.  Pep did it for Xavi, new I think Pedro should do it for Adama."
Barca,3d9732,Illegal_sal,10,Tue Jul 14 14:09:13 2015 UTC,"There are only a handful of La Masia products who have gotten a crack at a possible starting job since Pep, but as the article itself points out, there's nothing extraordinary about that.   Of those players, the first team fucked up with Thiago. Deulofeu fucked himself, although I suppose it's possible to lay that one on Barça B. Tello, Montoya, and Sergi Roberto just aren't quite good enough for the best team in the world, and that's nobody's failing. They're very good players who served well as backups, and the only shame is that Barça doesn't get better money when it sells players like these.   On the other hand, Bartra's on track for an eventual starting job, Rafinha's in the competitive mix, Denis Suárez will certainly get a look, and everyone's optimistic about Samper. Sandro, Munir, and Halilović will all get more time to prove themselves this fall, and if Pedro leaves one of those first two will stick around. In other words, La Masia is doing exactly what it's supposed to do. It's the best academy in football, and any suggestion of a crisis is silly."
Barca,3d9732,camp_nous,4,Tue Jul 14 16:12:39 2015 UTC,"Deulofeu fucked himself, although I suppose it's possible to lay that one on Barça B.   Mental development with the kids is also a thing that should be handled by La Masia/Barça B coaches in my opinion, so I do think it's very fair to say that there were problems there as well.  I recently just watched some clips of Deulofeu in Juvenil A under Oscar Garcia. The player we saw there was a world of difference with the one we saw at Barça B.    Tello, Montoya, and Sergi Roberto just aren't quite good enough for the best team in the world, and that's nobody's failing   I'd agree with that, but Montoya has stagnated a lot in his development ever since joining the first team. There was a reason why he always started over Carvajal for Spain U21 as well. The talent is there. Hopefully it will come out with Inter.   It's the best academy in football, and any suggestion of a crisis is silly.   Arguable. It's not like every La Masia team is winning their league every season - not even regional; let alone national.  Mostly agree with the rest though."

Sure. But mental toughness can't always be taught. La Masia gave him the skills and knowledge to succeed, and we have to allow that some players will naturally make better use of that than others. If we see Deulofeu's problem repeated with other players then I'll start to worry it's a systemic thing.   Montoya has stagnated a lot in his development ever since joining the first team.   I wonder if he would have benefitted from the new policy of loaning out players who are stuck in that limbo between the first and second teams. Playing behind Alves was always going to be tough on his development.   Arguable. It's not like every La Masia team is winning their league every season - not even regional; let alone national.   This gets at one of the problems with the article (which was otherwise very good): it's easy to conflate results with the actual role of the youth system, which is player development. In the case of Barça B's relegation there's a real and problematic connection, but in most cases I don't think we should much care about winning at the youth level."

If we see Deulofeu's problem repeated with other players then I'll start to worry it's a systemic thing.   It's worrisome though that his attitude dramatically dropped since Eusebio took over though.    I wonder if he would have benefitted from the new policy of loaning out players who are stuck in that limbo between the first and second teams. Playing behind Alves was always going to be tough on his development.   Even when Alves wasn't playing well (so 2012/13 and 13/14), he really didn't play much at all. This of course seemed to be less of a problem with La Masia than that it was a problem with the first team coaches not trusting him.  I personally don't like loans and probably never will. The fact that we now need them though might be a hint of something wrong with the B-team. Why did we never need them and why do we suddenly send them out on loan? Iniesta broke through with the likes of Deco there. Piqué broke the Márquez - Puyol defense, Pedro got a chance with Eto'o, Henry, Ibrahimovic etc. there and Busquets knocked Yaya Touré out of the starting line-up.   This gets at one of the problems with the article (which was otherwise very good): it's easy to conflate results with the actual role of the youth system, which is player development. In the case of Barça B's relegation there's a real and problematic connection, but in most cases I don't think we should much care about winning at the youth level.   Oh I agree with that, but results often (not in all cases, Vinyals Juvenil A an exception for example) tell a lot about how the development is going I'd say.   When the players are developing well in the Barcelona style, good things should come from that."
Barca,3d9732,jklz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:01:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm with you on loans for reserve players. I think they were helpful under Eusebio's poor management but shouldn't be the default option. But the real problem, like you say, happens at the first team level. If players are ready to get promoted they need to become a trusted part of the rotation so they don't stagnate. Otherwise, loan them out.   Looks to me like Lucho has his head screwed on straight about the whole thing. The big question for me this year is if he'll find a way to help Samper progress."
Barca,3d9732,camp_nous,-2,Tue Jul 14 18:35:39 2015 UTC,"That's an odd claim, since it implies Barça B has nothing to do with the club's youth system. If that were true there really would be a crisis."
Barca,3d9732,camp_nous,5,Tue Jul 14 16:50:42 2015 UTC,La Masia is technically pre-Barça B.
Barca,3d9732,jklz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:58:18 2015 UTC,"Right, but the idea behind placing unfinished youth players at the reserve level is that they should absorb the team's style from peers and coaches. It's fine to distinguish players who enter at that level from ""La Masia products"" if you want but nonsense to say they have nothing to do with the academy and its job of developing players for the first team."
Barca,3d9732,camp_nous,3,Tue Jul 14 17:01:06 2015 UTC,"Okay, this issue is definitely being blown out of proportions. La Masia is performing below average, but only below average of the expectations that is put upon it now. Legends are created every decade, or every few years if you're lucky enough to get a golden generation. Xavi, Iniesta, Messi, Busquets, and Pique were all in the span of a decade. How long has it been since Barca won their first treble with those same players? 6 years. Give it time. Management may have issues, but that can be sorted out with the snap of a finger. Even Bartomeu will hopefully come to his senses if he's re-elected and hire someone better. The reason they were so successful was because Barca didn't have world class players in every position, they were able to have more chances. I'm sure Luis Enrique will give the youngsters more time, he knows how dear La Masia is to the Barca mentality. More and more young players with the dream to play in the first time and emulate their Barca heroes are enrolling every year, that's an extremely good sign. I would say for every 10 players, only 4 would be good enough to join a first division team. For the same 10 players, only 2 would be good enough to be in the Barca first team, and the chance of a world class player that could start for the first team would be 1/100 imo. I believe that Samper can be one of those 1/100 players, he has shown the potential. For Munir and Sandro, they can't displace MSN no matter what, but they can definitely emulate Pedro's super sub theatrics. Point is here, don't worry. La Masia is having millions invested into it and will continue to produce legends and be the best youth academy in the world."
Barca,3d9732,ThatAeroGuy,2,Tue Jul 14 17:09:32 2015 UTC,"Answer lies with Barça C ,every player used came to Barça C after juvenil A  if they performed good then they get promoted to B .The link between Juvenil A and Barça B is big which makes B team struggle and make it in first team. That's the step missing."

If Pedro leaves it wont change the fact that we got great worth out of him. Tello was not up to par with the team, and even Guardiola couldnt have changed that. Deloufeu was sold because he did not mature as a person or player in all these years. Montoya was good, but absolutely everybody who has seen him play would agree that he is not at the level of the starting 11.   La Masia is fantastic, but it will never yield a starting 11 every season. The fact that all all of our all stars came together was indeed a fluke I think and will not happen again for many many years. Nevertheless, we will always have a strong Masia representation. Right now we have Pique, Iniesta, Bartra, Messi, Rafinha, Pedro and surely more that I am keeping out. These success streaks will help us become more balanced financially and be able to invest and attract top young talent in the long run."

I am not sure that Lucho ever wanted Pogba, with all the attention and the inevitable hype train rolling into the station (plus the terrrible haircut - we already have a bad haircut expert on the team in dear Dani, not sure we can accomodate two).  Arda, on the other hand, is an experienced, technically strong midfielder with a good work ethic, who also happens to be hard as nails. I knew a Barca player like that, his name was Luis Enrique. The Arda signing makes too much sense for me to think he was a second or a third choice. More likely than not Pogba was a smokescreen, and/or he's coming in 2016."

Pogba strikes me as a ""Bartomeu signing"" - lots of press, lots of star power, lots of votes.  Arda is a ""Lucho signing"" - little commercial value, but supremely useful player to have on the team.  Anyway, I don't think we'll ever learn the truth, I just object to the idea that the Arda signing is a-priori flawed, because it was done by a managing committee. If Lucho, who has been confirmed as manager for next season, really wanted Arda - and I am sure he did - then I am happy he got him, nevermind who signed the transfer."

Laporta was the first one to negotiate putting a sponsor on the kit (even though he did not close it), he is fiscally irresponsible and his reign was also affected by scandals.

We were not getting paid, we were actually donating 5mi a year to UNICEF. Having UNICEF on your shirt is not the same as having Qatar Airways.  He was fiscally irresponsable? Not true, he was send to trial for this, but the judge found him to guilty. He left Barca on a surplus. Do a little Google search and you will find all about this.  All the scandals have gone quiet? May I remind you that Rosell is facing up to 7 and a half years of jail and Bartomeu 2 and a half for the shaddy Neymar deal?

First of all, Rosell kept his word by offering Abidal chance to continue at the club even if not as a player.  Secondly, Abidal did not leave, his contract expired, which is perfectly normal thing in football.  It was not extended due to decision of ""council of elders"" consisting of for example medical experts, technical staff and Tito and his assistants.  Thirdly, he refused the last offer made this year to work for Barca as a head of barca youth abroad (iirc) and took a job at Olympiacos instead.

R&B actually said they opposed the unilateral appointment of Cruyf as honorary president during elections. So cules voted for them knowing they will likely do that.   Closed many youth teams   And yet our youth produced many talented players since   Lied to Abidal   As I mentioned in this thread earlier, that is just not true.   Got us the tranfer ban   Yeah, that one they fucked up.   Did some shaddy moves in the buying of Neymar   Speculation. Innocent until proven guilty. I don't know what happende, you don't know it, nobody knows it for sure. But everybody is somehow sure that there was something shady about the deal. Let the courts decide that.   Got us an sponsor that represents things that are far away from what we stand for, or at least used to stand for.   Let's not forget that Laporta was the first president to initiate negotiations with sponsors. Most notably with China government (to put Beijing 2008 on our kits). Yeah, I am not kidding.   They stopped Laporta's 250 mi project to renew the Camp Now because ""there was no money"" just to try to make us swallow a 600 mi project?   Well this is complicated. Firstly, at the time there was really no money. Qatar and other deals allowed us to have much better plans later. Secondly Laportas plan was only for renewal of Camp Nou, R&Bs plan include palau blaugrana and other stadiums as well. But most importantly, cules voted for it, and that is the ball game for me.   They are willing to sell the naming rights of the Camp Now, they don't give a shit about our identity.   Oh, common, how strong would our identity be if it depended on the name of our stadium? (which is shortly Camp Nou, not ""Now"" btw). Plus of course the name would stay, the commerical name would only be added. I couldn't care less about that.   The erased over a 100 year history of our shirt with vertical stripes, again they don't give a shit abour our identity nor our history.   Horrible. Really horrible. Vertical stripes. How dare they. I mean, seriously, that kit looks absolutely gorgeous and it is only for one damn season so who the hell demolishes our identity? Really, of all the objections this one is really funny.   You can't compare Rosell&Bartomeu to Laporta, mate.   Oh, yes I can. Easily. You could write whole essays on what Laporta did as president and would be amazed. You really shoudl not idealized Laporta, otherwise you will be disappointed if he wins after a while. I guarantee that."

I am not okay with shitting on our history. I am not okay when longtime fans forget how Laporta said regarding Nunez financial policy that it is irresponsible not to be thinking about ads on our kit. I am not okay when longtime fans forget that Laporta was the first one who negotiated about the ads and that it was him who initialy opened the door to the negotiations with Qatar. Yet somehow right now he is the guy against all the ads and returning to Unicef, which was by the way at first done despite the fact socios never had the chance to vote on such historic moment.  I do give a shite about our identity. I just don't see it in our vertical stripes and one name of stadium, which was btw changed before in our history. If we are not bigger than that, we are not big at all.  I do care about our motto. Do you? Do you even know what it means? It is about the form of resistance against Franco catalunyans chose: good football rather than violence; it is about catalunya self-realization and its pride; it is about how we play the game, that how we play is much more important than a win; but most importantly it is about the fans who own the club, it is about us. It is the way the club is managed: by the fans for the fans. It has nothing to do with ad-free kits or vertical stripes. If it does, it means absolutely nothing.  Laporta has history of making his own decisions and not putting it into vote, whether it was about appointing Cruyf as honorary president, renewal of stadium, putting unicef on the kit and some other things. But he is still seen as some kind of saviour of our traditions. Thats bullshit and I am amazed we do not know better."
Barca,3d5bb3,juguar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:51:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that this Abi v R&B thing is at this point is basically ""he said-she said""..  It would help if I saw proof that Abi was promised a contract extension as a player..  However, that wouldn't be definitive..   Times change, and the club may have had different needs..  Abi may not have recovered as well as they had hoped, as has been proved by his ever-too-brief spells at Monaco (from where he also left in a huff) and Olympiakos.. Deschamps even gave him his chance in the French national team .. on merit, he added.. however, others turned out to be better.  So I'm not sure why a promise or a broken promise should be held against R&B.  None of these guys are angels.. Which of the presidents in elite level football is an angel?  So the issue for me isn't that Laporta is an angel and Bartomeu isn't. Its how responsible or irresponsible their plans are for the club's future.. What is their vision?  e.g. How will Laporta make up for the shortfall in the Qatar money?    Will he replace the 30M /yr with just 4M from another source?  Why is Bartomeu's 600M stadium+other development plan better for the club?  What are the risks? Are they manageable?  What about La Masia?  If we can't bring foreign youngsters to Catalunya, then can we open up Escolas at the same level in other countries?  And Cruyff.. how are we going to leverage his experience?  etc etc."
Barca,3d5bb3,alterpsyche,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you for nice coherent comment. My position is quite clear. Firstly I do believe changing management right now would be a mistake. Secondly, Laporta is right now doing nothing but denounce everything Bartomeu and buying vote with cheap promises of Pogba signing and Abi returnig as sporting director (which is really awful populism, for Abi has little to no experience with such important job). For this hypocrisy and my rational reasons, I cannot with clear conscience be for Laporta."
Barca,3d5bb3,juguar,2,Tue Jul 14 08:12:06 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree that its populism.. but so are some of the things that Bartomeu does - ""oh Luis Enrique asked for the Arda signing"".. He was just trying to cover up for the ineffective bid for Pogba.. These guys are fighting elections and, like all politicians, they're attacking each other and doing some populism..  No one's innocent of that.  And I had the same thought about Abi. But remember Laporta has proven that he knows how to pick people..  He appointed Rijkaard even though he had no experience..  He appointed Pep who had no significant head-coaching experience.  They both did well..  He appointed Txiki who turned out to be brilliant too. All Txiki did before being given that position was work for Catalunya TV. Ferran Soriano who is now CEO at Man City.. etc. So let's give him the benefit of doubt on this.  He's a known Catalanista too.. so I doubt he'll do anything to really eff up the club.  Still the socis need to be vigilant and ask the questions that need to be asked.. then make up their minds."

I cannot agree with you on that. You forget about Ibras clusterfuck, Henrique, Keirrison or Hleb. His management is seen as succesfull mainly because of Peps requests and his ability to work with the player he was given. In City Txiki is quite frankly doing an awful job.    I doubt he'll do anything to really eff up the club   I agree with that. There is no good side and evil side in this elections. Bart will do probably a bit better job next time and Laporta would definitely try to do some good. But right now circumstances are for Bartomeu in my view."

I'm sure you've seen the video with examples of Messi being open and not getting passes, or passing but not getting the return ball along with examples of how if you just manage to get the ball back to him somehow he'd often make magic happen in tight, impossible for another player spaces."

Barca,3d4xy0,crowseldon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:48:31 2015 UTC,"Bullshit (also, source?).  Biglia has been very solid for Argentina.  I'd argue Kun wasn't bad either since he was injured in the Cup.  Lavezzi played a good WC and didn't get to play practically anything in the Copa America.  It mostly comes down to the manager who has done a terrible job through and through.  You can blame Higuain instances but that's just a symptom (picking him, atm)."

Barca,3d51ws,Illegal_sal,3,Mon Jul 13 16:10:51 2015 UTC,Only 6 months away from seeing him play competitive games for Barça B.  This is going to be exciting. I hope we can get him some time with the first team if he impresses.
Barca,3d4eqv,Illegal_sal,15,Mon Jul 13 12:58:17 2015 UTC,He would make the Chelsea starting lineup ahead of William and Cuadrado. I dont want to see him there though.
Barca,3d4eqv,ChinggisKhagan,2,Mon Jul 13 13:29:14 2015 UTC,"Cuadrado is barely getting any minutes as is and then with Salah coming back and Hazard a mainstay in the starting XI, what role does Pedro have in their side?"
Barca,3d4eqv,zizzor23,2,Mon Jul 13 15:28:39 2015 UTC,He would play on the right with Hazard on the left and the rest on the bench.
Barca,3d4eqv,ChinggisKhagan,5,Mon Jul 13 19:29:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wish he'd go to Arsenal or somewhere where he could slot in right away.  For one, I hate Chelsea and Mourinho, but on top of that he has loads of competition there; Willian, Hazard, Cuadrado and even Remy, Costa, Falcao if he plays in the middle."
Barca,3d4eqv,Marchisio,11,Mon Jul 13 19:34:05 2015 UTC,"Chelsea's RW position is up for grabs though, Pedro is a similar player to Willian, but offers more end product. Cuadrado has shown nothing yet and Remy on the wing is less than ideal as well. They also want to play Willian more through the center which would free up the RW for Pedro.  All in all, he has a lot more chance of playing time there than with us."

Barca,3d4eqv,StopMakingScents,13,Mon Jul 13 15:26:23 2015 UTC,He is still world class and young. We should defs keep him. What if one of front 3 get injured? We also need to rest front 3 from time to time. I doubt he will leave. Also he is from barcas academy and he is loyal
Barca,3d4eqv,Hadi420Swag,9,Tue Jul 14 00:39:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah he is loyal and yeah it would be ideal to keep him as backup, but there comes a point when, as a player, you have to think of yourself. I think its almost selfish of us to expect him to stay when he is clearly not as happy with the lessened role he has taken on.   I feel for Pedro -- this has gotta be such a tough situation to be in and he sounds really conflicted...its clear he loves Barca, but he wants to continue to grow and improve as a player. Really hard to do that when you're riding the bench waiting for someone to get injured or playing only once every few matches to give the regulars a rest. Pedro needs to to what's best for him, IMO.   If he doesn't stay at Barca, I'll hold nothing against him. Just hope he finds another club competing for titles where he is guaranteed a starting spot so he can shine like we know he can."
Barca,3d4eqv,04andrew22,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:05:20 2015 UTC,"Thats true. I agree. I am just saying that we should keep him. If he leaves its because he wants to and not because our president, coach, etc dont want him or there is conflict of that nature"
Barca,3d4eqv,Hadi420Swag,6,Mon Jul 13 17:41:16 2015 UTC,"Well Munir and Sandro are getting promoted by the looks of it, and after xmas we have Arda. Rafinha can also play up front."
Barca,3d4eqv,IhateAngryBirds,18,Tue Jul 14 04:50:05 2015 UTC,"While I agree, there's a big difference in quality between Pedro and the youngsters (Munir, Sandro and even Rafinha).   With that being said, I think they have huge potential and could one day be better than Pedro (at least I hope) but it's difficult to rely on them for big games if one of MSN are injured or need rest.  Obviously, once Arda is eligible this won't be as big of an issue as we can move him up.   It's going to be a tough decision either way, I don't exactly know what's best. I wish I had a board I could trust with these decisions..."
Barca,3d4eqv,Marchisio,6,Mon Jul 13 14:01:42 2015 UTC,"my heart is hoping he would stay and end his career here since he s my favorite player but by the looks of it he has reached a point where he is simply not happy anymore, sure , he loves the club but every ambitious football player wants to play more and constantly improve , course of the years the recent transfers made his situation very difficult .  i just hope lucho will have a chat with him and hopefully for pedrito, offer him more games, if not,and he decides to leave  i m sure nobody would blame him as he has had a wonderful career at Barca  being world's first football player to score in all 6 competitions ,often showing up in finals, i remember many games vs Real or Bilbao (CDR)  or the CL from 11 where he constantly scored,  even this year vs Atletico (another title decisive match)  he had a great game and so much more  ,  i have in mind  a lot of great goals scored  from him,  the Deportivo one from 40 yards out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBdF6gNHJWc  the goal vs Betis  ,great solo effort   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9koSi_seEY  or probably the highlight goal of his career the bicycle goal vs La Real  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD38vXYgnzc  or the one vs PSG  (decisive goal in therms of qualifying )  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oT1HWrYcCsw  or the one vs United https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgss-YMmYyU  and many more   great hardworking player,ambidextrous , great at making runs and finishing,capable of playing on both sides of the field"

Barca,3d4rsj,etonB,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:50:40 2015 UTC,"I've always thought that Neymar will be the next Ronaldinho for Barça. Despite of having the true potential to be the next torchbearer of our flair player, Neymar still hasn't reached the level where Ronaldinho was when he signed for Barça in 2003 (he was 23 and already won WC when he joined our side).  Ronaldinho passed his #10 shirt to its rightful heir Messi who surpassed his predecessor by miles and only time will say what Neymar will be able to do when Messi retires. Talents like Messi aren't that easy to find, so even if Neymar can't reach as high as Messi's level we really can't blame Neymar for that.  I believe Neymar can be the next Ronaldinho but he still needs work on few things before we can say Neymar will go down to the history as a Barça legend. I hope he will work hard to make his finishing better, he will learn to control his temperament and will show mature attitude on pitch."

Barca,3d4rsj,iagolima,4,Mon Jul 13 16:06:59 2015 UTC,its a no brainer that Neymar will be the key man when Messi drops back but will most likely not get to Messi's level.   Heres a fun question. Do you think Neymar will get to CRonaldo's level?
Barca,3d4rsj,i3k,5,Mon Jul 13 21:56:28 2015 UTC,"I actually think he might. He already shows signs of it. His muscles got definitely bigger since he came, his technique did not suffer for it as it happens so often. He is a bit shorter, but heading is also about technique, as shown by Messi many times, so he could definitely get to Ronaldos level. Right now Neymar is very lethal in front of goal and he will get only better at that. Plus of course he will continue to grow next to Messi, Suárez and many other great players.  The only thing I am not sure about is his work rate. But he has surprised me before with how he fit into the team..."
Barca,3d4rsj,alterpsyche,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:12:25 2015 UTC,"I think at this rate, he'll reach just slightly under Ronaldo's level, but he has all the potential to be just as good or even better.  However, I dont think anyone will reach Messi's level for a long, long time. At Neymar's current age, Messi was already starting to be considered a top 3 GOAT and even #1 by some.   I'm excited to see just how good Neymar will be in his prime though"
Barca,3d4rsj,DivineVibrations,2,Tue Jul 14 17:22:56 2015 UTC,"In what level do you refer to? If is goal scoring, I don't think so but then only time will tell because Neymar is a different player. He is a playmaker and plays for the team, Ronaldo doesn't.  Neymar can drop and make the team play from the midfield if the team needs him to. CR7 can't do that, he just needs/wants to score, he doesn't create play and you can see it during the games. Neymar can drop to the midfield and bring the ball forward, whereas Ronaldo needs to have the space to outrun his opponents."

I'd say because it has a massive global presence, while Catalan is just spoken in Catalunya, Valencia (although they call it Valencian), the Balearic Islands, and Andorra.   Hm, I think you would understand a bit, depending on your level. Most Catalan speakers already know Spanish, but non-Catalan Spanish speakers mostly have trouble listening to Catalan since it sounds quite different, in my opinion, to Spanish. Written Catalan is easier to understand, but it still has a lot of different words that most Spanish speakers wouldn't understand. For example, ""with"" is ""con"" in Spanish but ""amb"" in Catalan. They're definitely different languages, but with a lot of similarities. I always say Catalan is like a mix of French and Spanish."

Barca,3d4ed6,Illegal_sal,9,Mon Jul 13 12:54:11 2015 UTC,Makes sense since we have so many CBs now. Bartra needs more minutes and Verm will start to take some up as well. The only way to have that happen (besides lots of subbing and rotation) is to move a CB over to LB more frequently.  Not crazy about this but I do want Bartra to get more minutes...However I want Grimaldo to move up...  I'm torn.
Barca,3d4ed6,Marchisio,3,Mon Jul 13 14:18:54 2015 UTC,"I watched Grimaldo since he was 14, 15. Dying to see him in the team one day."
Barca,3d4ed6,callmeWia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:00:58 2015 UTC,"Mathieu did play in that position during the past season, he can pull it off. Macherano, Bartra and Adriano will likely become rotation players. I can see pique and vermaelen taking the starting spots. I'm curious to see if Aleix Vidal can take the top spot from dani Alvez, and how well Turan settles into the barca midfield."
Barca,3d4ed6,emsthename,5,Mon Jul 13 17:00:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know Mathieu has played there but I wasn't crazy about him compared to Alba.   I don't see Vermaelen taking the starting spot at all however. He hasn't had a full season in a long time and is what, 31? It's tough to come back to top form from long injuries like that, regardless of age."
Barca,3d4ed6,Marchisio,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:34:09 2015 UTC,"He's definitely not as fast as alba, but he's a solid defender, and let's be honest alba didn't have a highlight season.   You're probably right about Vermaelen...it would be awesome to see Bartra come up and follow in the footsteps of pique and Puyol."
Barca,3d4ed6,emsthename,12,Mon Jul 13 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"I think Alba was HUGE last season...not sure why you don't think so. He was a huge asset on the left wing and was very solid defensively.  I'd much rather have Bartra come up next to Pique. I like having Verm as backup, but yeah, it'll be VERY tough for him to get back to his old form from several seasons ago..."
Barca,3d4ed6,Marchisio,5,Mon Jul 13 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"Grimaldo is 19, loaning his somewhere in La Liga where he can play 80% of the time is a great idea, possibly even for two years.    We have a lot of great players  at the back already: LB: Alba, Verm, Jeremy. CB: Masche, Bartra, Pique, Jeremy, Verm. RB: Alves, Vidal, Barta.  No need to throw an inexperienced LB back there just because Adriano leaves, if anything it will open some playing time to keep a solid rotation going, especially when we play 60 matches again this year."
Barca,3d4ed6,cdrawesome,5,Mon Jul 13 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"Bartra and Grimaldo should be priorities, at least let them prove themselves..."
Barca,3d4ed6,leoanonymous,2,Mon Jul 13 18:18:20 2015 UTC,Didnt Vermaelen play LB in Arsenal for a while as well? So we have backup at least.
Barca,3d4ed6,LionsKing1,-2,Mon Jul 13 18:50:34 2015 UTC,"ok Mathieu who struggles to impress at CB, will now play LB when he has zero technique and creativity. Great."

Barca,3d3ywh,IhateAngryBirds,5,Mon Jul 13 10:28:11 2015 UTC,saw on twitter that Halilovic might get the #19.  Because people need to compare him more to Messi <_<
Barca,3d3ywh,IhateAngryBirds,3,Mon Jul 13 14:34:49 2015 UTC,"I still can't believe some of the players we're leaving behind, it's worrying honestly.  I'm super happy for these 3, I'm not surpised about Sandro and Munir but the general consensus around here (maybe wrongly?) was that Samper was always mentioned to move up over Halilovic...   Then we have Grimaldo...From what I've seen he could very well sub in for Alba against lower teams/cup games but maybe they want to make sure that other CBs get more minutes so they'll be using Mathieu more at LB than before (which I'm not crazy about).  Edit: Literally just found THIS after I said that about the LB spot...guess I was right (although I'd rather be wrong about this)"
Barca,3d3ywh,Marchisio,3,Mon Jul 13 14:15:40 2015 UTC,IIRC halolovic had a clause in his contract to get promoted after the first year. So probably he will be loaned out for a year or two.

He started the season like he finished the others, as a right back for Eusebio. Without single competition for the right back position, he was guaranteed to start for the B-team every game. Not being a real defender, his workrate was his only saving grace at the position. His defending was below par, often trying to defend standing sideface. When Jordi Vinyals joined, Patric was moved back to his natural midfield position. At the start this seemed a wise plan: Samper could use someone next to him that knew the Barcelona system inside out and would play safely. This in the end didn't prove to be the case, often showing that Patric lacked creativity and passing skills in tight spaces. Patric's contract expired this summer and he has joined Lazio Roma.   source: 1 month ago by jklz"

People assume because he is shy during interviews and doesn't yell on the pitch during a match that he doesn't know how to communicate.  We don't know what he's like in the dressing room or a huddle.    As a somewhat related point, the Barcelona website did a cute series of interviews where each player would would pull few other player's names out of a box and talk about them extemporaneously -- what he was like as a player, as a person, in the dressing room, etc.  Messi was conspicuously absent from these interviews as either the speaker or the subject.  He was also the only player other than Neymar who never did a ""head to head"" for the website."

Barca,3d3wn4,vanNostrandby,2,Mon Jul 13 12:39:03 2015 UTC,"Training is something that can't be classified as you know, official(not the best word but you get it). So to train is almost as if the player is doing it on his own. How to ban someone from this?"

He will still train, be coached, participate in friendlies, and just straight up adapt. Settle any nerves, etc. It didn't affect Suarez as much as I thought it would and I think Arda is a similar animal in his work ethic. At the very least, we should be hopeful that he'll make the most of his absence. He seems really grateful for joining the club."

Barca,3d1uhi,Chunky_mono,7,Sun Jul 12 21:03:53 2015 UTC,"For those who don't know these players, here's a short write-up  Tarin   Excellent centre back. Fast, good passer, great tackler, physically strong. Has a lot of potential; probably Juvenil A's best player last season.  Ros  Central defending midfielder. Solid, but not really something special. Will probably mostly be there to be a back-up to Gumbau now that Samper is likely to be promoted/loaned out.  Quintillà   If this guy makes it, he will be captain material one day. Excellent mentality. Great player, capable of playing left back and centre back; although I prefer him in the centre. Relatively fast, but also excellent on the ball.   Amir   Arrived last season from Russia. Versatile, have seen him play at striker and in every midfield position. He's tall, but still a pretty good  dribbler for someone with his stature.  Enguene  Enguene has great potential. Individually perhaps the most out of last years Juvenil A team. Unfortunately, this does not really shine through on his collective play yet. He has an excellent first touch and can basically do everything you desire from a midfielder, but it's just not coming out as of now. Hopefully this will change with a new good Barça B coach.  Aitor Cantalapiedra  Excellent forward, capable of playing in every forward position. Scored quite a few crazy goals this season. Reminds a bit of Munir in his playstyle, although not as crazy yet. Will be a very useful player for Barça B.  Padilla  Striker, although he only really started to play somewhat well when he was moved to the right wing. Moved to the club to fill the void of Munir el Haddadi leaving for Barça B. More a Sandro type of player. Didn't really click with the team until Garcia Pimienta took over. Decent player."

I just can't really get past the serious mismanagement that led to the transfer embargo and the clear downturn at the B team level. For me, these alone are enough to say ""lets get someone new"".  I am also not a fan of Laporta.  The man is a leech, a charming leech sure, but at the end of the day he has again and again showed throughout his previous tenure to be someone who just uses the club for his own personal gain.  Couple that with his lies (like lying for his brother in law the francoist), and I jus dont want him associated with the club anymore.  The thing that is weird to me is this- Nobody (or at least mostly nobody) on this sub has a vote.  Yet everyone says they support Laporta and all the reporting on this sub is skewed towards laporta because they think ""he's the only one with a shot to beat bart"".  What does that matter to all of us who have no vote?  Why are we acting so pragmatic when we cant legitimately affect the decision?  Why arent we paying more attention to the other candidates?"

The point is he didn't distance himself from Rosell, he calls Rosell his friend. And let's not forget that Bartomeu was VICE PRESIDENT, a right hand of former PRESIDENT Rosell. You can't separate them because they were in the same board and they have put signatures on same papers. Why do you think that Spanish court is going for both of them + FC Barcelona for Neymar case? Because the Board is a body in which members discuss among themselves and VOTE before making a decision."

I don't think they would much like being used this way.   Two months ago   Our interest for Pogba is way longer than that. He is also the reason why we hired Braida in the first place.

I guess the moral of the story is, just because they don't like Casillas, doesn't mean they're not real Real Madrid fans, and just because they are real Real Madrid fans, doesn't mean that they make sense (same can be said about fans of any fanbase)."

That is not what's happening with Casillas.   We didn't stop supporting Xavi when he & Puyi spoke with Casillas.  Why should they be mad that he spoke with Xavi & Puyi to calm things down?  And isn't Real Madrid supposed to be Spain's team?  And didn't Casillas do everything he did for the sake of the Spanish national team?  So why should their fans be mad at him?

Figo was our captain when he left, a key player in and out the field, with unconditional support from the fans, and Casillas is not in the same level. He would come to be the third keeper and he would earn more than Bravo and Ter Stegen (probably more than those two combined), leaving a club where he is no longer wanted. Both Casillas supporters and haters agree that his exit is for the best and he should not remain in the team.  That being said, I still hope we will someday strike Real as hard as they hit us back with Figo, but it is complicated as now everyone has a trillion euros clause to prevent things like that.

I also think he's been the best goalkeeper of the year many times and he has done an amazing job for Real Madrid and the national team (Spain).  But we have Claudio Bravo and Ter Stegen, both have done an incredible job last season. Iker Casillas is rounding the mid 30's and there just isn't any place in our team for him, had it been a few seasons ago I would have embraced the idea of him joining us. Ter Stegen is our future.  I wish the best of luck to him, I think Real Madrid has treated him as shit even though he should be treated as a hero and a veteran.

Barca,3czc3u,MayIHaveAHug,3,Sun Jul 12 03:52:51 2015 UTC,"I don't get this sub sometimes. When we are talking about Pogba everyone says ""Lets give Rafinha minutes instead, he is more than capable"". When we are talking about Pedro potentially leaving all the La Masia trust goes away and Rafinha isn't a top player anymore? I say MSN should have their understudies and players like Rafinha, Munir and Sandro fit the bill quite well. If one of MSN is out long term we can change formations(I believe with Arda and Samper in the squad the 4-4-2 is a real option) or use Turan as a winger. This is going to hurt, but I really don't think we need Pedro anymore.   EDIT: Why are you guys flipping out over the 4-4-2? What if I called it a 4-2-2-2 or a 4-3-1-2? Lucho has tried a lot(including the mentioned 4-3-1-2 and the double pivot), in terms of formations and in terms of the way we play. I would be surprised if he didn't give the 4-4-2 a go at some point.  Don't we already defend in a 4-4-2?"

Barca,3czc3u,MayIHaveAHug,2,Sun Jul 12 11:15:16 2015 UTC,Changing the formation is not really possible at Barca. It will probably cause a shitstorm. But I think Pedro doesnt deserve to be on the bench as much as is gonna be at Barca. We have plenty of players in the B squad that are good players and have potential and I think Lucho should use his rotations the way he used them last season and bring them up.

Barca,3czc3u,CuriousMG,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:25:05 2015 UTC,Willian?
Barca,3czc3u,bricebru22,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:15:38 2015 UTC,"Apparently they are not really happy with his offensive output. They are looking for someone on the right who can lighten Hazard's workload, Willian just doesn't seem to be able to create a whole lot, while Cuadrado was a utter flop last season. Salah wants to leave Chelsea, that's leaves them with potentially only 2 right midfielders/wingers, not nearly enough for an English team competing in many tournaments."
Barca,3czc3u,darthvader7888,2,Sun Jul 12 18:22:14 2015 UTC,"I'm actually OK with this, especially if the decision comes from Pedro and Luis Enrique. As much as I love and respect Pedro's contributions over the years, I think the best for him is to go to a team where he has a chance of being important.  I agree the timing is awkward with the ban, but if we need a sub for Suarez, Neymar or Messi, I much rather give minutes to players in development like Rafinha, Munir, Sandro, Adama rather than a player who is effectively past his peak.  Plus, if they pay us 30M EUR like Sport says, it could be one of our best deals in YEARS."
Barca,3czc3u,pradeep23,2,Sun Jul 12 10:43:43 2015 UTC,"I doubt that this is true, but he would work great in a Mou team with his work rate and defensive contribution.

I'm very disappointed man... Messi has been the greatest player I've watched play the sport, and to see him be treated this way certainly changes my aspect of the sports fans. It's kinda like when Real Madrid fans attacked Bales car. It must really suck to go out in the pitch, be good at what you do, and have people bitchin.

People say every star player has that struggle, but Chile's high pressure style made it almost impossible for Messi to be free. High pressure football and 4 players on you, how many people can do that? No one.   And even when Messi was free, his team didn't even pass to him. It's ridiculous that people are blaming the best player in history on a loss."
Barca,3cwp6f,Mentosfruitcore,18,Sat Jul 11 13:30:17 2015 UTC,"Well, even with 4 players on you and massive pressure, Messi can handle it... just not on his own. In Barcelona all his teammates make runs, show themselves and act as a team should. Argentine simply didn't."

In the final, the players that need marking were substituted off in the second half of the match. Without Di Maria it was already hard enough then without Aguero and Pastore it was almost impossible getting a goal in open play."

Barca,3cwp6f,Mornic,40,Sat Jul 11 13:23:44 2015 UTC,Argentinian fans don't deserve Messi. He took a mediocre team to the WC final and yet they are only satisfied if he brings back gold. Now its the same with the CA final. He performs fine for both Barca and the national team. Its the rest of the national team that needs an upgrade.

I feel like Argentina lost a key player early in the game which really showed how important he is. It's just not fair to put that much pressure on one player when it's a team that represents a country.

Barca,3cwp6f,PanchDog,10,Sat Jul 11 13:53:34 2015 UTC,"VIDEO ANALYSIS   It's in spanish but basically he said that even though messi was in good positions nobody passed the ball to him  even when he was asking for it ,raising his arms/yelling   or, instead of going for the 1-2's around the box , like Barca players,especially Pedro does , so that Leo can finish, nobody from argentina ever did that .  he even went in middle of pitch  to collect the ball and still nobody passed the ball to him, he tried his best ,even offered the pass to lavezzi that higuain managed to fk up (was a tight angle but still should have done better)  besides that, he did his duty for the team scoring from the PK spot ."
Barca,3cwp6f,zazzlekdazzle,7,Sat Jul 11 12:47:18 2015 UTC,"We have all seen Messi win games on his own, against tough opposition.  He has done that many times for Argentina as well as Barcelona, it has been unfortunate that Argentina has needed that in both finals and for whatever reason no player, not even Messi, could deliver that kind of victory.    I'm going to go a little meta here and say that, though I appreciate the sentiment of the video, I am not sure it's good for any or all of us (including Messi himself, for what it's worth, though he probably stays away from all this stuff and good for him) to keep picking this scab.  It's been two very big disappointments in a short period for Messi, but the bigger you are in your field, the bigger the disappointments become.  All Messi has left now are the biggest laurels to win, the hardest to reach.  If the Messi we see in interviews is the man he truly is, he is a man settled and happy with his life -- a job where he has found his calling, a beautiful family with a kid he adores (plus one on the way), more money than he could or his family could ever use and a charity to take care of children in need like he once was.  He may never be able to be a hero for Argentine's the way Maradona is, but he will make his peace with that.  While we are mulling this over, Messi is playing with his kid and his nieces and nephews, eating asados and going to bed every night with a woman who seems to be lovely in every way.    Hopefully Cruyff will have a sitdown with him one day and tell him what it's like to live as one of the best ever at the game, with the memory of coming in second.    Messi is Messi and he will be fine."
Barca,3cwp6f,konoplya,3,Sat Jul 11 15:46:01 2015 UTC,This is all nicely written but Messi was devastated about the WC and he's devastated about Copa America. His own grandfather chastised him publicly for the loss (twat). He'll forever regret not winning those two tournaments.
Barca,3cwp6f,Apitoxin11,3,Sat Jul 11 19:39:52 2015 UTC,"Of course Messi will always feel disappointed about those finals, all professionals have to live with that kind of regret.  Einstein was not appreciated during his lifetime for his greatest ideas, which were not accepted until the turnover of a new generation of physicists; Paul Newman had to watch as other people got Academy Awards year after year while he turned out masterful performances and continued to come up short.  My point is that going over this again and again can be counterproductive for us.  Ironically, it's probably Messi's greatness as a player that makes him vulnerable to this kind of criticism.  People expect a lot because they have seen him carry his teams to victories in incredible ways and he has surpassed seemingly impossible expectations before."
Barca,3cwp6f,zazzlekdazzle,3,Sat Jul 11 21:12:33 2015 UTC,"of course, it was obvious in every game. if your team is not superb how can you be superb? i'm surprised messi's own grandpa was talking shit about him, that's fucked."

Barca,3cwp6f,i3k,2,Sun Jul 12 13:50:03 2015 UTC,"Argentina's weakpoint especially is the midfield. They don't have any intelligent players who can thread a pass between the lines like Busquets or Xavi. Obviously these are one of a kind players, but if you look at Di Maria, he simply does dead sprints with the ball. He is not very smart about conserving his energy, and he ends up being injured.

Real football fans, who follow and watch Barcelona in some way know that he is possibly the best DM in the world, and crucial to Barcelonas style of play."

Barca,3cwrpk,lonestar_10,7,Sun Jul 12 02:49:45 2015 UTC,He's not underrated by most culés but I think that he does tend to be overlooked by non-Barça fans when MSN are lighting it up like they did this past season.
Barca,3cwrpk,HippoNigga,5,Sat Jul 11 16:34:22 2015 UTC,I don't think Sergio Busquets is underrated he was the spine of our team
Barca,3cwrpk,Hype11,11,Sat Jul 11 14:54:24 2015 UTC,I feel Jordi Alba is more underrated than Busquets.

Barca,3cwrpk,AvocadoCake,-9,Sat Jul 11 17:18:29 2015 UTC,"no i don't think he's any good, busquets is definitely better, but come on we have a team full of super super stars and Busquets is getting credit? it just makes no sense to me, he's soooo replaceable compared to everyone else on the team."
Barca,3cwrpk,mekane84,5,Sat Jul 11 17:39:39 2015 UTC,"I think Busquets displacing Yaya from the team shows just how far he is from replaceable.

We look way worse, and the team doesn't function even close to when Busquets is playing.  Busquets is our second most important player behind Messi. Without him there would be no treble.  Nobody in the world close to him in terms of level and skill in his position. He is the best DM of all time."
Barca,3cwrpk,flackohowyoubeen,-6,Sat Jul 11 23:15:03 2015 UTC,"Mascherano is probably the best DM in the world, I think we looked fine with him at DM.  There was ONE game we looked stagnant with mascherano at DM... we have plenty of games where we looked like that with Busquets in, too, and Mascherano has barely played DM for Barca, Busquets plays there 90% of the time.  You guys just need to get used to this newer style of Barca."
Barca,3cwrpk,mekane84,3,Sun Jul 12 01:39:59 2015 UTC,"Busquets is the midfield. He makes it all tick, he's not easily replaceable at all.

Barca,3cwrpk,flackohowyoubeen,-2,Sat Jul 11 23:12:26 2015 UTC,"I see him getting blown up on counter attacks all the time, and he doesn't really do anything special.  Roberto filled in just fine, you barely could tell Busquets was missing, he even had some really nice forward runs dribbling with the ball, just like Mascherano and Yaya Toure sometimes have, something Busquets can't really do because he is so damn slow."
Barca,3cwrpk,mekane84,2,Sun Jul 12 01:41:03 2015 UTC,"Even messi has weakness,that doesn't means he doesn't deserves his credit. We all now he can't out dribble opponents at times,but that doesn't we don't give the credit where it is due."
Barca,3cwrpk,justafanpassingby,-2,Sun Jul 12 08:19:05 2015 UTC,"he's not a bad player, but i think only minimal credit is due, and certainly not at the expense of the REAL keys to barcelona like Messi, Iniesta,Mascherano, Pique, Alves, Suarez, Neymar, Alba, Rakitic, Bravo/MaTS... those guys are all top 2-3 in the world at their position,  maybe that's why barcelona is so good lol?"

It's unlikely he lied or was disappointed in the span of 24 hours. And only a handful of players were announced for the preseason today. Can we just wait and see who is actually there when preseason starts?
Barca,3cwgh8,egcg119,7,Sat Jul 11 12:13:50 2015 UTC,I'm happy for these 3 but it blows my mind that they don't see a spot for Grimaldo and Samper.........

Barca,3cwgh8,zero237,8,Sat Jul 11 12:02:26 2015 UTC,"I will be entirely honest, but this is unsettling. It tells me that Grimaldo and Samper, probably Barça B's best players, aren't playing any kind of role this season. They're going to get loaned out, and will probably see around 1000 minutes this season, possibly the most important of their careers.   This decision is nonsensical if you ask me, assuming it's implications hold up. Hope this wasn't Lucho's doing.   Hopefully I'm wrong and they do join, and don't get loaned, however if this information is true hard to see that."

Also, Toni Freixa did fantastic on the candidate debate show last night and he's the candidate who is looking to steal Bartomeu's votes. Distancing himself from controversial Qatar, prioritizing La Masia, cheaper tickets and 50% discounts for socis. Will definitely gain votes from Bartomeu.

He values La Masia, wants to expand the Barca brand in a proper way, and he's fairly ambitious. He would modernize the club but also keep its roots in place. He's also pursuing Monchi and Verratti and while that is ambitious and improbable, it's a right way of thinking. He's also obtaining a sponsor that will benefit the club financially as much as Qatar, but not as corrupt and against the values of Barca like Qatar. If he doesn't win, I would prefer Laporta, but no way Bartomeu. He doesn't care about La Masia and has been in serious legal trouble. It's unfortunate that many cules believe that he is a good candidate and thus he's winning in signatures so far. Unbelievable."

Actually the main reason why Rosell and Laporta became enemies was the fact that Rosell fancied himself a football expert because he got lucky with Ronaldinho and wanted to have the main say in transfers.   Laporta listed to Cruyff instead and Rosell felt betrayed.   Say what you want about Laporta but he tended to listen to the right people."

As for Laporta he is just a charming leech. People talk on this sub about supporting Laporta and talking about Laporta ""because he can beat bartomeu"". That's the reasoning I could understand if we had votes, but most of us aren't socios. So why is the big reason this pragmatic one?  Others say he has a proven track record as a follower of the cruyffian principles that brought us great success. I don't really argue he is a follower of cruyff. I just think he's a scummy man who was the center of a lot of embarrassments (remember the airport ""striptease"" http://mobi.iol.co.za/#!/article/laporta-strips-down-during-airport-dispute-1.247975, the man is a clown and a dirtbag)"

That Barca will never exist again (and no club like it will). People tend to vote on the past instead of looking forward. Both candidates blow, in my opinion."

Powered-up La Masia Guardiola   Laporta's bad stuff:   Shady personal business in Uzbekistán A liking for being the focus of attention Improper celebrations that were public (i.e. there were photos of him completely drunk in a nightclub after a trophy).   Why Bartomeu is a bad pick for president:   Co-responsible in Neymar's signing, which is being investigated. He's being prosecuted by justice along with Rossell and the club itself. Bad management of La Masia. Horrible handling of the whole FIFA ban situation. Pride was the strategy of defense and was doomed to fail. It doesn't seem Messi's very happy with the board. QATAR :("

Barca,3cty8q,HippoNigga,11,Fri Jul 10 19:45:42 2015 UTC,"Good luck to you Samper, but remember, even Mascherano has a hard time getting a game out of Busquets."
Barca,3cty8q,efarfan,11,Fri Jul 10 20:16:01 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't at least get a shot at the first team, it will be a very sad thing for Barca and La Masia. Here is a proven kid who is one of the best products since Messi, in the midst of a transfer ban, trying to play for the A team. He deserves a shot. He needs a shot.   From this point forward, I could see him being a backup to Busquets or another center mid on the A team for a majority of games. Going forward, he is the natural successor to Busquets, and I honestly believe that he will be far better."
Barca,3cty8q,OrangePaper7,11,Sat Jul 11 00:00:43 2015 UTC,From what I've seen he might be better suited as a Xavi type player and less as a ball winner like Busquets. We'll see but I'm sure hoping the young kids get a chance.
Barca,3cty8q,anon4you,2,Sat Jul 11 02:05:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, its worth trying out Samper in the Xavi role. Busquets is irreplaceable for a few seasons at least."
Barca,3cty8q,Kluey,0,Sat Jul 11 09:47:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it's not like Busi HAS to play all the games there are. Not having a decent replacement even led to him tiring out at the end of the last few seasons.  Samper is the perfect backup for Busi, and also the perfect backup for Rakitic or Iniesta. Should definitely get promoted, he has what it takes to get enough playtime."
Barca,3cty8q,elmagio,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:55:06 2015 UTC,"Samper is no Iniesta or Rakitic they are different types of players. Rakitic is a much better shot and offensive threat, also more physical. Iniesta is better at dribbling and more offensive minded. Samper could mimic a Xavi though and is similar to Busi.   Imo he should become his own player not try to replace or mimic someone else the comparisons will only hurt his image in the future if he cannot be exactly like them it also adds a ton of pressure to him."
Barca,3cty8q,FrostyGrass,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:19:24 2015 UTC,"Good thing he has plenty of years ahead of him, by the time Busquets gets 30-32 where he isn't the same beast, Samper can replace him with plenty of years to come and a handful of years of experience under his belt."

I'm similar to you, but I don't think it's necessarily our place to criticize South America ""as"" South Americans. But perhaps your upbringing was closer to South American culture than mine.  The whole interview was a great way to pass time. The only thing is that it brings back terrible memories. Translation for those who can't speak Spanish:  ""The truth is that it's not easy being #1. Not only in a footballing sense, but for what surrounds this sport. If [Messi] needs a break, he knows that, behind him, there are a ton of players that will support him... but only if it's a break. Leo can't leave the NT. No matter how much he wants to leave it, no matter how discouraged he is, no matter how unjust the criticisms are...  Reporter: Have you asked yourself, Biglia, what would happen to you were Messi?  No, I wouldn't want to be Messi. I don't know if I could be Messi. It's not easy being Messi. I've never asked myself because to reach that... there's a path that only a few can walk. He's a prodigy. Sometimes I wonder what goes on in that head of his. Like I told you, if he needs to take a break, in order to feel good when he comes back; to feel better... Certainly, we'll support him. But not for him to leave.  Reporter: Do you think that if there's a footballer who resigns the NT, others would follow suit?   I think that his decision could influence quite a few. When you consider what he is to us, I think that he could be quite an influence.  Reporter: So you're telling me that if Messi quits, there are others on the NT that will follow suit?  There are quite a few of us who would definitely consider it. Quite a few who don't want him to leave. Quite a few who want him in the NT. Quite a few who want to enjoy having him in the NT, that's the truth. We want to enjoy having him here daily. To keep seeing Leo, the person. Because the player... what else do we want to see of him? What else can we ask of him as a player? What can we criticize? That's what I ask myself. What can you criticize about Messi?  The truth is that we have to be grateful that he hadn't chosen... that he chose to be Argentine when Argentina turned her back on him. And to enjoy the day after tomorrow and say that, ""I lived in the era of Messi"". Like many say, ""I lived in the era of Maradona"", we have to say, ""We lived in the era of Messi.""   What needs to happen? Do we need to see everything fail and then ask him to return? Why force that? What is that necessary? If we have a player that would die for his country, that looks out for his teammates... Why would we throw him out of the NT? I think that if you ask the 40-42 million people that we have... 41 will tell you that he shouldn't leave, that he keeps on playing, that he shouldn't take a break. Keep playing for Argentina. Why do we have to wait for something bad to happen to appreciate what we have?""  He also talks about how he helped the team by sharing the nutrition diet that was given to him by Barca with the NT.  I was bored but I didn't realize how much work it is to translate an interview, so I'm done. I also didn't know where to end because he keeps on talking about Messi and it's very interesting to me and it's a 20+ minute."

Qatar Airways got the price for best airway in the world. That's a part of Qatar we should NOT boycott. We should support their good companies and boycott their bad companies. We should show them that good companies are what matters. And if you want to boycott even worse companies then don't buy electronics from the poor countries in Asia. Don't buy Apple or Samsung. That's even easier to do than signing the petition - on your iPhone.

Barca,3csyra,JurijFedorov,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:09:11 2015 UTC,Then a lot of teams should drop their sponsors. Look at Atletico Madrid's sponsor. Look at Gazprom. Look at gambling sponsors and big bank sponsors. Many of these big companies are corrupt. Qatar Airways is one of the better ones in this aspect. Do you think we can get Greenpeace as sponsors? Even I'd we could they are also known for being an terrible organization. Even Barca is a bad organization as we currently have a transfer ban... so. Do you want McDonalds as sponsors? They kill people with fat each single year.

Barca,3csyra,kezorN,7,Fri Jul 10 18:37:20 2015 UTC,"Hope this post is upvoted - so close to the target.  And also, it's about more than just Qatar as a sponsor, it's about not letting money win over ethics and human rights. Barca are better than that."
Barca,3csyra,potatosss,10,Fri Jul 10 15:15:33 2015 UTC,"Even if the petition reaches it's goal, it will probably have 0 effect on Barca and Qatar.   Also about this quote,   it's about more than just Qatar as a sponsor, it's about not letting money win over ethics and human rights   Probably 80% of your closet and electronics comes from Child Labor or Slavery, the issues in Qatar is just the tip of the iceberg. And there is no such thing as human rights or ethics when money is involved. Barca is a business, not the UN."
Barca,3csyra,kezorN,-1,Fri Jul 10 17:10:47 2015 UTC,"I disagree, Barca is a football club foremost, that is turning into a business more than anything, but you don't have to be a business that support modern day slavery and lack of human rights - if we just let them keep running it completely as a profit/money-machine, then soon there will be no more traditions and then you might as well just call it Qatar Camp Nou and ""menys que un club"" or ""less than a club"" - it kills the club.  And why is clothing and electronics relevant? It's not like I have a choice in buying stuff that is labeled ""not made by poor people"" - I/we do have a choice in things like this however, in who we vote for at elections and signing petitions like this. It's like the petition on reddit to get Ellen Pao to resign, it does mean something and it will change things. It's like voting, you can't just stop caring because your vote might not change anything.  50K votes might not be THAT much, but it was reached in 24 hours - it can, and should go much higher, and it will force someone at the club to acknowledge it, unlike when people just mumble to themselves and relatives that it's a bad thing.  Also, like it was discussed in a thread not long ago, it's not like Barca doesn't have another choice for sponsor than Qatar. I know for a fact that other teams have got sponsors that are way less corrupt/controversial and still get more and equal the amount of money that Barca get for their Qatar deal - but like it was also mentioned in that thread, Rosell made that Qatar deal and I wouldn't be at all surprised if he chose Qatar because he himself benefited from the deal."
Barca,3csyra,potatosss,5,Fri Jul 10 18:40:00 2015 UTC,"I'll just base my opinion from each paragraph.  The reason football clubs exist and have this much money is because of profit, it's a business and always been one. It's freakin shirt sponsor, it's not like the barca players are wearing nazi uniforms or a shirt saying ""I support slavery"". The clubs history and tradition will remain, especially since many of the staff and players come from Barcelona.  You're going by the logic that if I wear shirt that says ""Qatar Airways"", I'm directly supporting slavery, which I'm not. And if you are going by that logic, wearing a shirt that has the text ""Abercrombie and Fitch"", means I'm supporting child labor. And are you seriously comparing reddit to Barca? Barca has more fans, more money, and more corruption. Also completely different organizations, and Ellen Pao is an angel compared to Bartomeu.  hell, I doubt even 500k votes will make a difference, especially since it's election time now. Nobody at Barca would give a shit.  That's true, and the only thing we can hope is for Laporta to get ahead of Bartomeu and win the election. Which seems doubtful as of now."
Barca,3csyra,kezorN,-1,Fri Jul 10 20:23:13 2015 UTC,"You're going by the logic that if I wear shirt that says ""Qatar Airways"", I'm directly supporting slavery   Eh no, no I'm not.   It's freakin shirt sponsor   Yes, now it's a shirt sponsor, after that it's Qatar Camp Nou, and after that we'll be owned by some Oil sheik from Qatar - there's making money and profit, and then there's greed. But even if it was just a shirt sponsor, why would you choose Qatar when there are so many others to choose from, unless Rosell got something under the table that is, which is for me, the only reason why someone would make a deal with them over literally anyone else that has a normal relation to human rights and isn't corrupt as fuck, just to mention a few things wrong with Qatar.  Also, about petitions, Ellen Pao (who I definitely don't think is an angel compared to Bartomeu, at all, but that's another story) just resigned. Nothing happened until the petition (that got 200K+ signatures) started. When you have, on paper, hundreds of thousands of people, who all want you to step down, or keep you from doing a specific thing (Qatar deal), you have to at least react to it in some way. And it's not like it's ""Qatar or no sponsor at all"", there's plenty of other sponsors that can give us as much as Qatar, if not more - just have a look at how much other top 5 teams in the world receive in shirt-sponsorships compared to us.   But the sad thing is, it's never a good time to address the petition as long as we have Qatar as sponsor - the club can't say that they wan't to get rid of the deal, so we can only hope that they don't renew it. I don't know if a candidate is allowed to say that if he wins he will get a new sponsorship, but if he is, he (Laporta) should definitely use it to get votes IMO.  But yes, one can only hope for Laporta, but as you say, it seems very doubtful sadly. Bartomeu just reeks Rosell 2.0 with his shady deals and the way he still makes things happen even though he shouldn't be allowed to. Is it seriously too much to ask for, to get a president that cares about the club and not just himself and how he can stay in his seat at all costs?   Fuck sake.  Oh, and happy cakeday!"
Barca,3csyra,potatosss,3,Fri Jul 10 22:51:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks   the only reason why someone would make a deal with them over literally anyone else that has a normal relation to human rights and isn't corrupt as fuck   You answered your question, you think a board this corrupt would bother listen to petitions.  The Reddit situation is a lot different to the one in Barca. Admins and the workers at reddit actually care about the people, the board doesn't.   And I'm sure the Qatar contract has a requirement end date, so it's not possible to terminate. i mean, look at Chevrolet sponsor for United and the amount of money they make. It wouldn't make sense for Barca to keep continuing this unless if Rosell/the board are getting a benefit from it. So most likely petitions will do nothing."
Barca,3csyra,kezorN,0,Fri Jul 10 23:06:37 2015 UTC,"I suppose, but I wouldn't say that they're useless in this case still - it's a great way to let someone know that a certain thing is not okay and should be dealt with - otherwise the club could potentially just renew the Qatar deal because it's easier than negotiating for a new one.  Can't hurt, that's for sure!"

Barca,3csyra,JurijFedorov,3,Fri Jul 10 19:52:31 2015 UTC,It's state owned. That's why people here dislike it. But it is just like any other airline. They do the same things and follow the same rules. They are just really good. I feel bad for the ones who work there as the company is known for being good. But the state does do questionable things no doubt. But it is still one of the most free Muslim countries. Westerners there love it. And they have both women and men working there. You don't need to wear a hijab either. It's not that bad a country. Not even one of the 100 worst countries.

Barca,3csytl,zero237,2,Fri Jul 10 15:06:13 2015 UTC,"Before they sold Deulo, I thought they might loan him to Everton."
Barca,3csytl,bballdeo,18,Fri Jul 10 16:50:10 2015 UTC,This is awful news. I really thought Grimaldo was a sure bet for the first team.
Barca,3csytl,egcg119,16,Fri Jul 10 15:02:25 2015 UTC,"Loan is not a bad thing if you ask me - sadly I doubt that he would get any real play time over Alba (and maybe Adriano), so him getting some actual play time in, hopefully, another La Liga team would be perfect.  If Adriano were to leave however, then it would be great to have him on the first team. He's also better than Adriano imo."
Barca,3csytl,kezorN,3,Fri Jul 10 15:20:36 2015 UTC,"Adriano is super useful to have on hand, though, since he can cover both RB and LB."
Barca,3csytl,bballdeo,6,Fri Jul 10 16:49:18 2015 UTC,"Indeed, but soon he won't be needed (hopefully) because we will have Alves, Alba, Vidal and Grimaldo. Adriano has been declining for a while, he seems to have lost a lot of stamina, and defensively he's not very good and never really was.  But he has definitely been useful and has the same kind of awesome attitude as Pedro."
Barca,3csytl,kezorN,3,Fri Jul 10 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"He was, but as we saw last season, he currently has very little to offer. I'd rather we let youth through for once."
Barca,3csytl,IhateAngryBirds,10,Fri Jul 10 22:32:36 2015 UTC,"Considering Adriano is likely to leave, I certainly hope Grimaldo doesn't go out on loan. Mathieu as a backup LB won't be a good idea at allconsidering he didn't impress there last season, and he doesn't have the qualities needed to play as an attacking LB here at Barca. Grimaldo was one of the best players at Barca B last season, he is very good, ready for first team football, and he deserves this. Loaning him out is another hit in the face for La Masia.  And the last thing that annoys me is why he brings Gumbau. Gumbau was awful, one of the very worst players at Barca B last season, and he gets to go? He definitely don't deserve this...  EDIT: How could I forget Adama? Also one of the best players at Barca B last season. If Pedro leaves, we have no real winger before january. And wasting Munir at the wing won't be very smart. He also deserves this."
Barca,3csytl,egcg119,7,Fri Jul 10 15:06:03 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Vermaelen can play LB fine... but yea I agree.  If a player like Grimaldo can't make the first team, then all hope is lost for La Masia.."

I disagree on this entirely. The only genuinely bad performance Mathieu had at LB was in the Clasico, where full-backs still had a really weird role in the team, stationed permanently in the opponents half. Once we switched back to a more normal 4-3-3, he played pretty well - not spectacularly, but well.  Also if you think Adama was one of the best I have a feeling you didn't actually watch Barça B much this season."
Barca,3csytl,Aj16ay,2,Fri Jul 10 18:07:39 2015 UTC,Adama one of the best? Until November/December maybe.. Afterwards he played really poorly.

Barca,3csytl,jklz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"Compared to what he had shown the 2 seasons before, definitely poorly. His decision making was so bad."
Barca,3csytl,IhateAngryBirds,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:45:17 2015 UTC,"I think that's unfair. I didn't like the midfield as much as the next guy, but Adama got plenty of chances to do other things than to 'run after long balls'. His decision making was far from the level he has shown before.   Nearly every time he got the ball he went for a dribble. And because he's such a good dribbler this sometimes had success as well, blasting past 2 or 3 players.   Often he had better decisions available to him though, but he still had to make the dribble.   I really, really like Adama but he definitely wasn't in the top tier of our Barca B players this season. Very few were."

I don't think he'll need the time that even Rakitic took (which, all things considered, was quite short). Having Turan come on for Iniesta (or vice versa) late in matches could be deadly. I also think that Arda will not be sheepish at first, the way Rakitic was. It's just not in him. He will look to light things up immediately, and he has the necessary skills to do so. His chemistry with his teammates is the only thing that needs to develop, but I feel his passion to be at Barca will make that a non-issue as well."

Barca,3ctlwy,navidjaan,11,Fri Jul 10 17:53:12 2015 UTC,"He has a bit of Iniesta's silky dribbling, a bit of Xavi's passing, and a bit of Busi's positional awareness.   I hope the board don't fuck this one up like they did with Thiago. IMO I actually prefer Samper. He looks extremely calm and controls the play very well. Thiago was very erratic at this age and gave up the ball a ton."

Here is a proven kid who is one of the best products since Messi, in the midst of a transfer ban, trying to play for the A team. He deserves a shot. He needs a shot.  From this point forward, I could see him being a backup to Busquets or another center mid on the A team for a majority of games. Going forward, he is the natural successor to Busquets, and I honestly believe that he will be far better."

Barca,3ctlwy,swrehc,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:37:29 2015 UTC,In the youth systems he played every midfield position in both 343 and 433. It has been a while though since he did so.

Barca,3csmfv,Chillidawg,18,Fri Jul 10 13:13:05 2015 UTC,"I think that he has taken a few steps this season compared to the last one... He has been very good in the games I've seen him play, and continues to evolve. Hopefully he continues his form this first half of the season and proves he deserves more playtime, it's all up to him.  As has been said, there is a lot of competition in the team now. Samper and possibly some other younglings coming from the B-team, and of course Arda coming in January.   I don't think it's a do or die season, that's just utter nonsense. He is  only 22 years old, and will continue his evolution. We can see actual progress, in contrast to Sergi Roberto for example."

Barca,3csmfv,marsh_randy,9,Fri Jul 10 15:59:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Busquets, Xavi and Iniesta were far better than the current set of La Masia players. This isn't down to skill level completely, but also circumstance.  La Masia and Barcelona  Xavi and Iniesta were given loads of chances at the youth level, both for Barcelona and Spain. And they performed brilliantly there.  They were also introduced into the first team earlier so their maturity was higher. Besides that, they were all trained in a very tactically sound fashion - all of them started out as no.4s in the Guardiola mould.  Busquets' case was simple - he was simply perfect for Guardiola's system and so was introduced as soon as Pep became coach.  Nothing Rafinha has done suggests that he will come close to Iniesta's level. At the age of 22, Iniesta was subbed into the CL final in 2006 where he was the key player inspiring a second half turnaround (along with Larsson). He had competition - no doubt; Ronaldinho, Deco, Edmilson, Xavi etc. were all competing for the two roles he was comfortable in - central midfield and left wing. He managed to beat them all.  International Youth sides  Xavi was in the 2000 Olympics side where they won a silver medal (with an Eto'o led Cameroon winning the gold). Iniesta was the star of his U21 side (and before that the Euro-winning U16 and U19 sides). Busquets was 21 when he played in the World cup (2010). Meanwhile, Rafinha switched allegiances from Brazil to Spain and Brazil finished last in the 2013 South American U20 championships. Hadn't set the world alight in those apps.  That's not a deal breaker, of course. However, I would take that into consideration while selecting young players for big games.  International senior squad  Rafinha's chosen Brazil and hasn't been called up to the team where the likes of Paulinho, Bernard and Fernandinho, far less talented, get callups. This is partly because of Scolari and Dunga's idiotic policies, vs the likes of Aragones, del Bosque and co. (hence the circumstance). He barely has any big game experience due to this, while Busi/Xaviesta were all in the World Cup squad before they were 21.  Big game experience  Let's see the other players in our starting 11, right? For example:   Ter Stegen had been a starting goalkeeper at Borussia Monchengladbach for nearly 4 years before he moved. Alves impressed in the 2003 World Youth championships where Brazil won (incidentally against an Iniesta-led Spain) - this convinced Sevilla to sign him. Mascherano was so good in the youth side that he made his debut for the senior Argentine team before he made his debut for River Plate's senior team. Rakitic was starting for Croatia at Euro 2008 (he was 20) and played well in qualifying before that as well, and the youth sides. Pique won the U-19 tournament he played in. Our front three - you know well enough.   They might have been young but they had a wealth of experience by the time they were 22. Rafinha's had one complete season at Celta and the occasional appearance at Barca. He won the La Liga breakout player at 21 - the same award Xavi won when he was 19.  Technique  There is one major flaw in Rafinha's game. He almost never takes just a single touch to pass. There's almost always two touches involved. Here's a highlight video praising Rafinha. The skill is apparent, but you might notice that a number of these flair moves were necessary because he held on to the ball for far too much time. The necessity of one-touch football in the Barca system is drilled into La Masia kids at a young age, and Xavi, Iniesta and Busquets are phenomenal at it (and Thiago to a lesser extent). If not one-touch, their first touch is usually excellent in that they've managed to place the ball in the right direction, setting up the pass itself using the second touch.  That simply eliminates the need for excessive flair. Whatever flair is present is used to get out of the rare tight situation, not every five minutes.  This is a great in-depth article on Rafinha which was posted on the sub last year; the translation's in the comments thanks to /u/_sic.  There was a gap, no doubt. But it has only widened as Rafinha becomes older. Special thanks to Eusebio, Rosell/Bartomeu, Scolari and Dunga. Remember,Xavi, Iniesta and Busquets are once-in-a-generation talents. If Rafinha performs better than Rakitic/Turan/Iniesta he's fit to be starting at Barca. But as of now it seems unlikely.  EDIT: Added the link."

That being said, I do not see him as a valuable substitute, but rather a second squad guy. IMHO. I could be wrong. Needs more playing time to establish his identity. I also think he best fits in the 4-3-3 as a false 9. He does a lot of what Messi used to do when deployed there..."

Barca,3ctd1j,zazzlekdazzle,3,Fri Jul 10 17:14:29 2015 UTC,I find it downright depressing Bartomeu will be the president for the next couple of years.
Barca,3ctd1j,Colourise,4,Sat Jul 11 00:58:48 2015 UTC,"Because some socis are naive as fuck, they don't care how the club is run, they don't care how they sell the souls of the club, all they care about is results, no matter if they sacrifice everything that makes Barca Barca... They think the treble was possible because of Bartomeu (and rateface is exploiting this). And not to mention most of them have the memory of a goldfish and won't remember all the fuckups that have happened in the last 6 years. Not to mention the media is helping Bartomeu a whole lot.  Anything can happen, but I really hope anyone but Bartomeu wins, 6 more years with Bartomeu will cost the club way more than people think."
Barca,3ctd1j,IhateAngryBirds,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:55:50 2015 UTC,"The treble.  Plus the opinions that you often hear online (Reddit, Twitter, etc.) generally do not reflect the opinions of the socis who actually vote - sadly."
Barca,3ctd1j,sleepili,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:17:34 2015 UTC,"Let me vent...  He's conservative which seems to be always accepted among socis (look @ all the club presidents of the last 40 years other than Joan Laporta) Some people look at the team winning the treble because of him. I look at the treble as something the players and staff accomplished despite him and his henchmen. Now I most likely have to see a Perico as my club president for another six years. The Spanish justice system is corrupt as hell, he will no doubt avoid jail time even though he and Rosell have dragged the club through the mud. One day justice will be served, it's just a shame that many culés only care about on the field matters. When in the end we're suppose to be more than a club.  edit spelling"
Barca,3ctd1j,O_Cigano,-2,Fri Jul 10 17:57:51 2015 UTC,If Bartomeu gets elected then I'm giving up on Barca.

Barca,3ctg10,IhateAngryBirds,4,Fri Jul 10 17:18:01 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, that would be awesome. I wonder if Suarez and Neymar will be there?"
Barca,3ctg10,xscientist,6,Fri Jul 10 17:44:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think Neymar would be there. He is on break. Suarez on the other hand would play most probably. He was free the whole summer, and game time is awesome for a player like him who loves to play  Edit: Turns out Neymar's break would be over before the ICC. but I still doubt that he would actually play."
Barca,3ctg10,invice,3,Fri Jul 10 18:21:31 2015 UTC,Neymar's break ends before the beginning of ICC. This has been reported. But there's still no guarantee. I'm wondering if there's been any confirmed updates.

Barca,3cxgkk,HippoNigga,4,Sat Jul 11 17:55:02 2015 UTC,"You should check out his Facebook page. He's ecstatic about joining Barcelona. Now I'm sure he's not the one who puts every single post but I'm pretty sure he approves of what's on there.   Voting twice for Ronaldo, Benzema, and Ozil is in fact, odd. in my opinion. Kind of debunks the myths that he's in love with Barca circlejerk."
Barca,3cxgkk,NoFapMonster,16,Sat Jul 11 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe he felt Ronaldo deserved it more. If he likes Ronaldo so what? Leo doesn't give a shit. In a 2011 interview he claimed it was his dream to play for Barça. Again, I do not see how liking Ronaldo over Messi in the voting proves he doesn't love Barça? I'm not trying to come off rude but I don't think there's a big argument for him not liking Barca. Messi probably won't even know Arda voted for CR7. It's not like he publicly stated he hates Barcelona. If that was the case he'd be Atlètico's #10."
Barca,3cxgkk,xFragg,-5,Sat Jul 11 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"Oh I am not saying that he hates Barca by any means. I'm sure he loves us more than anything now. I'm just sick of the Turan-Barca eternal love affair that everyone is portraying. He is a professional player and he will do his best wherever he goes, especially in the greatest football team on earth; Barca."
Barca,3cxgkk,NoFapMonster,30,Sat Jul 11 21:06:05 2015 UTC,Well last year CR7 performed his level best and outperformed Leo.  Freely downvote
Barca,3cxgkk,justafanpassingby,10,Sat Jul 11 17:38:32 2015 UTC,Maybe in 2014 but definetly not in 2013...

Barca,3cxgkk,CrippledCrip,2,Sat Jul 11 17:36:38 2015 UTC,How else could that be interpreted ?  People are naive and believe every PR comment.
Barca,3cxgkk,Eladir,3,Sat Jul 11 17:49:55 2015 UTC,"Possibly. Turan's the guy who said ""Ronaldo is the best in the world because Messi is from another planet"". I wouldn't vote against Messi twice after saying that. Kinda confusing I  guess"
Barca,3cxgkk,MotherDucker95,14,Sat Jul 11 17:48:57 2015 UTC,"Well the Balon Dor is for the best player of that respective year, and while Messi is now on the top of the two, for those two years Ronaldo was performing better."
Barca,3cxgkk,Cambijao,-1,Sat Jul 11 17:57:30 2015 UTC,"I agree that Ronaldo deserved to win the Ballon d'Or 2014...   But when the Portuguese won the same award in 2013, Real Madrid didn't won a title in that calender year and it helped immense when Messi was injured in the autumm. Also, how comes that FIFA extend Ballon d'Or voting deadline right after Ronaldo made his hattrick against Sweden?"
Barca,3cxgkk,aleks19998,5,Sat Jul 11 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"Messi would've won 2013 if he hadn't been injured, it's that simple"

Barca,3cxgkk,s236480,5,Sat Jul 11 18:05:48 2015 UTC,I seem to recall Arda Turan stating that the Turkish FA had changed his vote.
Barca,3cxgkk,El_Barca,2,Sat Jul 11 20:03:43 2015 UTC,"In 2014, CR96 had a better year than Messi (in my opinion) but Arda had Robben as second and Benzema (16th overall) as third ahead of Messi, Neuer, Muller, Neymar, Di Maria and Bale. In 2013, Arda had Ozil (16th overall) as first, Ronaldo as second and Messi as third. This was the year Ozil moved to Arsenal and struggled.  His voting selections seem strange. In his defense, he did say this in a Mundo Deportivo interview that was published on 10/01/2014:  ""Messi no es de este mundo. Es un extraterrestre. Para mí es el mejor jugador de la historia del fútbol, al mismo nivel que Maradona. Aunque no ha terminado su carrera creo que está en ese nivel, lo único que le falta es un Mundial. Le respeto muchísimo."""

Barca,3cxgkk,NoFapMonster,3,Sat Jul 11 18:59:12 2015 UTC,This isn't a revelation by any means. Most RM levelheaded supporters that I know admit that Messi is far superior to any player ever.
Barca,3cxgkk,Zaratthustra,0,Sat Jul 11 21:08:47 2015 UTC,that is the translation to Arda words
Barca,3cxgkk,shelllli,2,Sat Jul 11 21:31:52 2015 UTC,One thing I feel weird is that Turan and his coach both voted for the same players and in the same order. I also remember he said his vote for best coach of the year was changed. Just don't read too much into his vote :)
Barca,3cxgkk,elanciano31,4,Sat Jul 11 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"Oh cool, a baseless witch hunt spurred on by people too stupid to separate the player from the scummy executive who bought him."

The fact that he said Messi is the best player he has EVER seen a year ago as well on live tv means a lot more than this as he is talking about multiple years there vs the calendar year voting the balon 'dOr is on..

The clause is just there for plausible deniability, Barto can point to it and claim there was no wrong-doing."

Barca,3csu7q,brocccoli,6,Fri Jul 10 14:24:42 2015 UTC,Super unlikely. It seems like they've really been putting an extra spotlight on Arda just to make it as awkward as possible if the new president were to sell him back. The jerseys were being sold the day after he was signed.

That's how he wants everyone to play for him, and that is a very good reason why Atleti had so much success. Arda won't have to work that hard for us, run that much and press for every second of the match. We do maintain possession, you know, unlike Atleti.  But this worries me a bit too because he has been saying that he wants to work a bit less and get paid more. I accept that Atleti is demanding, but we are not laid back too.

They then campaigned on making barca more financially stable, yet want to throw out 600m+  And saying that 600m isnt a bad price, when you compare it to how much the likes of Roma (300m) or Juve (120m) on new stadiums, it's nuts"

Barca,3crwcw,polechi33,-6,Fri Jul 10 14:12:14 2015 UTC,But to be fair. You don't get exactly the same stadium for €250m as for €600m. We are talking about a stadium that will last another 60-70 years. That's €10m a year and Qatar will pay for 5-10 years probably.
Barca,3crwcw,JurijFedorov,6,Fri Jul 10 10:56:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how you can say one stadium will last longer than another. Personally I'd rather pay €250m for a stadium designed by one of the best architects around, than €600m for something that is a concept. They only just last month opened it up for a public tender. Whats even more crazy is that they've settled on a price before getting tenders in. That's just backwards and will undoubtedly end up costing more than that.  I'd also say on the price, I'd rather have a €250m stadium paid for by the club with no Qatar involvement, than a €600m stadium paid for by Qatar."
Barca,3crwcw,tajolly,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:06:21 2015 UTC,I didn't say one would last longer than the other. But I do think it is unfair to say one is a better concept than he other without having seen the full plans for them both.
Barca,3crwcw,JurijFedorov,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:10:44 2015 UTC,Sorry i misunderstood your point. That's fair enough.  It really bothers me that they were able to push the referendum through without having plans. Just a number and some concept drawings
Barca,3crwcw,tajolly,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:18:58 2015 UTC,Yeah... but that number is probably not just a random number as we think. I am sure that all future presidents wants what is best for the team. Let's see what it is before we say it is bad. It could blow everything else out of the water. For me at least Camp Nou is worst more than what it cost to build it. It is a club icon and part of the clubs history. And a stadium admired all over the world. I want us to keep having the best stadium in the world - not just a good stadium.
Barca,3crwcw,JurijFedorov,4,Fri Jul 10 12:10:46 2015 UTC,"It's a bad price.. we're not building a new stadium, we're just upgrading the current one"
Barca,3crwcw,IhateAngryBirds,4,Fri Jul 10 10:30:25 2015 UTC,"The initial price was 250 million, than later it was raised to 600 million euros without good explanation. To put it in another perspective: RM stadium Santiago Bernabeu renovation will cost 400 million euros.  Another problem would be funding the project. 200 million from selling stadium name rights + 200 bank loan + 200 own funding.    Bank loan is not controversial because it is normal way of funding. Although if some problems during renovation comes up, bank can block our account and more problems would arise.  Selling stadium name rights has problems in sentimental way, maybe in future with sharing and selling ticket and are closer to selling Barca as whole which would mean abandoning Soci's model. If we invest that much our own money into the project, than how much will the sporting part of Barca suffer? If problems come into the future with renovation, it could lead that Barca's own part of financing would be increased so the project would be finished. Which could lead to closing some Barca's other sport segments (example: field hockey), pay-cuts which could lead that some of our best players leave and selling our best players (happened with Luis Suarez when building Camp Nou).   Spain is also notorious for spending lots of money in building megalomaniac projects who are way too much expensive and are one of the biggest sources of corruption.  Also my concern comes when I saw what happened with Valencia's Nou Mestalla. Similar scenario could happen with Barca as well."
Barca,3crwcw,zero237,2,Fri Jul 10 12:59:01 2015 UTC,You put this in a really nice way.
Barca,3crwcw,polechi33,-2,Fri Jul 10 14:08:48 2015 UTC,"It was presented to the ""socis"" and they voted for the plan but since we have elections, the candidates need to criticize something and since they can not criticize the team, they look into everything to find something to criticize (like the signing of Arda Turan by direct Lucho's demand). When the election is over the controversy will die."

Barca,3cr6ac,YO_putThatBagBackON,2,Fri Jul 10 04:53:21 2015 UTC,"Specifically, I'd like a translation of Falcao's letter to Messi only."
Barca,3cr6ac,HippoNigga,8,Fri Jul 10 02:56:38 2015 UTC,"""If he scored a goal, why didn't he score two? If he scored a golazo it's because the opponents didn't defend well. If he gives an assist, he needs to be more visible. If he dribbles past an opponent, those defenders are not first division material. If he scores a free kick, the wall gifted it to him. If he scores in a final, the opponents were already beaten. If he wins the Ballon D'Or, another deserved it. If he outpaces his opponent, Messi had a head start. If he doesn't defend, he's not playing for the team. If he had a bad game, it's because he doesn't care. If he scores for Barça and not Argentina, it's because he doesn't feel the colours. If he wins it all with his club, it doesn't matter cos he hasn't won anything with Argentina. If he wins something with his national team (Olympics), it doesn't matter cos the World Cup is missing. If he scores a hattrick, the defence didn't try. If they scored five, why couldn't they score seven? Although he has been vital with Argentina, he's still not good enough for them, and hasn't won the fan's love. If he doesn't say hi to a kid because he doesn't see him, he's a horrible human being. If Barça are eliminated from a competition, it's his fault. If something goes wrong with Argentina, it's his fault. That's the life of Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini. His daily bread. At the end of the day, people who don't appreciate great football will find an ""argument"" to question or expose. We try to appreciate and treasure each and every thing you do because we know that in 15 years we'll be watching videos of you and images of your celebrations with an air of melancholy. Fortunately, when that happens, we'll be able to say: #WeLivedInTheMessiEra"""

Barca,3cr6ac,broad_h2o,6,Fri Jul 10 20:48:56 2015 UTC,"mad tired so not gonna do the whole thing, but give you the gist because its basically him just repeating different scenarios to make a point.  Basically that no matter what he does, people will come up with a reason to shit on messi ""Si se gambetea a un par de defensas, éstos no son de primer nivel"" meaning if he dribbles past some defensemen then they must not be first class players. ""Si no defiende, no juega por el equipo."" If he is not defending then he is no team player. ""Si FC Barcelona es eliminado de alguna competencia, él es el culpable"" If barcelona are eliminated from any competition then he is at fault for it.  This is the part where he hammers it home though:  Tratamos de guardar y atesorar cada uno de tus actuaciones, porque sabemos que en 15 años veremos vídeos de tus goles e imágenes de tus celebraciones con muchísima melancolía. Afortunadamente, cuando eso pase, podremos decir: #NosotrosVivimosEnLaÉpocaDeMessi  We try to keep and to treaure each of your (messi's) actions, because in 15 years we will watch videos of your goals with melancholy (at what we no longer have?).  Fortunately when that happens we can say we lived in the time of messi.  Personally I gotta say, Falcao sure as shit can't finish anymore but I quite liked his letter."

Barca,3com74,ohpuic,8,Thu Jul 9 20:37:09 2015 UTC,I'd rank his misses in this order based on a mix of difficulty and how bad it missed:  1) Germany WC break away  2) Penalty against Chile  3) Setter against Chile  1 and 2 could be argued based on the penalty miss being a virtual NFL field goal attempt but against Chile I think it was really a poor late pass that caused that miss.

Barca,3com74,elanciano31,5,Thu Jul 9 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know how team based accolades effect how a single player is defined. The fact that Messi hasn't won the WC or the Copa is because his team isn't really deserving of them. Maybe the Copa but I don't think a single person would argue that Germany is not the best international team playing right now.  Messi being the greatest every player is already cemented, the amount of records he has broken are evidence of that but more than that, he makes everything look easy. Saying that he's not the best ever because he hasn't won the World Cup is just evidence that they're looking for reasons to discredit him."
Barca,3com74,ComfyRug,8,Thu Jul 9 17:32:19 2015 UTC,For me it's just an old viewpoint.  Was there a time when the World Cup was a premier competition?  Yes.  Not anymore though.  World cup squads are much less strong than most club sides in europe.  The only thing that makes winning a world cup more difficult is the fact that it is played once every four years.
Barca,3com74,elanciano31,3,Thu Jul 9 17:44:40 2015 UTC,"I think that when the World Cup was at it's zenith, it was essentially the best players from each countries league playing against other leagues. Then football became an international thing and players could play anywhere and, essentially, national teams mattered less and less. I think that the World Cup is still great because it is a spectacle that everybody sits down to experience, regardless of how much they like football. However, it's not even close to being the deciding factor in how good a single player is."

A lot of his on the field antics don't do his character justice but the guy is really loveable. I've been watching him since he played for Galatasaray and I'm really proud of how far he's come. The fans are going to love him as well be a use he's going to play his heart out for the blaugrana crest. That's how much passion he has for the game and the club he plays for. I know he's coming from Atletico but what's important to remember here is his disdain for Madrid will only grow stronger hahaha.
Barca,3cpru4,tonytetova,2,Fri Jul 10 02:44:38 2015 UTC,"Great video. Should have more upvotes. Love it when you get to see stuff from the inside like this, more casual than I thought. At least from Arda's point of view."
Barca,3cpru4,kezorN,2,Fri Jul 10 00:55:56 2015 UTC,"He seems to be a very cool and passionate guy, which is great ! I was kind of sceptical when the first rumors of him being signed but now I'm very happy !  The problem now is that I'm really afraid that Laporta sells him back if he wins the elections.... I want him to win, but if he does this because Arda is ""a Bartomeu player"", it would be a big mistake imo..."
Barca,3cpru4,BPITW,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:27:57 2015 UTC,"I doubt Laporta will sell him.   Arda is a great addition to the team, we'll lose 3.4 mil in the process, and he was bought so hastily so Bartomeu has something to boast for in the elections. If Laporta wins there really is no reason to sell him back, he would've won despite this."

Barca,3coor7,lostkid182,-3,Fri Jul 10 00:16:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just the media/PR team but since the signing there have been soooooooo much barca praising from this guy...which is making me dislike him.  I get that he is excited to be on the beat team of 2014/15 but damn keep your composure and respect atletico. Same thing to Danilo, guy JUST signed Real Madrid and he is already kissing the badge, come on man respect your old club."

Barca,3coor7,Dark-X,0,Fri Jul 10 07:49:07 2015 UTC,"Yes I can read the video date. But I still stand by my point, praising the club a little too much, not respecting his old club."
Barca,3coor7,i3k,2,Fri Jul 10 15:16:50 2015 UTC,"He is a Barcelona fan since childhood & an Atletico player since 4 years.  He never disrespected Atletico, he just pays a lot of respect to Barcelona.  I think you are over-analyzing this."

I don´t think Uruguay was 4 goals better than Chile in that match, but Suarez certainly capitalized on the opportunities. Of course Chile is playing much better nowadays than back then, but the base for both teams and style of play remains pretty much the same. Another huge player imo that Uruguay lacked and that in this match shows is Martín El Pelado  Cáceres."

Barca,3coju4,tiagom0702,8,Thu Jul 9 15:04:42 2015 UTC,"I prefer to have sponsors, not because I think it looks good on our jerseys but because it provides the money to guarantee sustainability to our club. All sports are driven by money nowadays and we need it without increasing the revenue granted by the paying members of the club."

Barca,3coju4,tiagom0702,2,Fri Jul 10 11:08:38 2015 UTC,That is a lie. When Laporta left the club was buried in debts that couldn't be payed if nothing was changed. And Laporta knew it because he planned to sell estate or sponsoring La Masia.
Barca,3coju4,elanciano31,0,Fri Jul 10 11:18:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for instance Laporta had the creative idea of putting sponsors on the facade of la Masia!  http://www.espnfc.us/barcelona/story/2327928/former-barcelona-presidents-sandro-rosell-joan-laporta-give-evidence-la-masia-mcm-damages-court-case  Wouldn't that have been great, a massive red bull advert plastered across la Masia!"

Barca,3cnn1y,poetical_poltergeist,6,Thu Jul 9 08:44:51 2015 UTC,"Complete highlights of the game here  Some info about this particular game:   This was the first leg of the 2010/11 Champions League quarter final. Barcelona absolutely dominated Arsenal in the first 20 minutes, I hadn't seen anything like this ever before in my life. As the Zonal Marking report says:   Have you ever seen a side start a big game as well as Barcelona started tonight’s match? Within the first quarter of an hour they had already forced Manuel Almunia into five saves, and had a couple more shots blocked. How Arsenal went in 0-0 at half-time, it’s difficult to understand.   Almunia had a brilliant game against us, as he always seems to.  Xavi had one of the best performances I've seen of him (watch individual highlights here).  Barcelona went up 2-0 in the second half through two Ibrahimovic goals. Arsenal somehow managed to come back to draw 2-2 however, giving them some hope in the return leg. But, we all know how that turned out.  Some quotes about the game:  /u/xenmate with -5 karma points   Men against boys. The boys got a bit lucky.   The Telegraph   For all Walcott’s wizardry, and Arsenal’s resilience, last night’s score line was an utter travesty. It spoke of parity, of Arsenal matching Barcelona but the real story was revealed in the statistics. Barcelona enjoyed 62 per cent of possession, completed 533 successful passes to Arsenal’s 265 and recorded 11 shots on target to the hosts’ three. In Xavi, Maxwell and Sergio Busquets, the visitors boasted three of the best players on the pitch. Even Ibrahimovic, who had never previously scored against English opponents in 10 attempts, was irresistible for the opening 15 minutes of the second half, exploiting the lack of communication between Thomas Vermaelen and Alex Song, who had dropped back when William Gallas’ season ended with a bad calf injury. Even before Barcelona’s Swede began dismantling Arsenal’s defence, Guardiola’s glee club were in bewitching form. Arsenal were second best. So used to out-passing opponents, Wenger’s men were being beaten at their own stylish game. Only a Spaniard, Manuel Almunia, kept the back the first-half tide. Manuel denying Barcelona? Basil Fawlty would have been confused.    Sid Lowe:   Last season, Xavi completed almost 100 passes at the Bernabéu. Last week, he completed more than all of Arsenal's midfielders put together."

Always close games against opposition they should be steamrolling. Other than otamendi, masche, di maria, romero and messi himself, argentinas squad is Weak.... Or trash in other words. I think argentina needs to rid itself of the dead weight, primarily ( higuain, biglia, rojo, demochellis, lavezzi, zabaleta, and even aguero) who still doesn't convince me. If Argentina think they'll get anywhere with this current squad or the next world cup, they're in for a big surprise. They need to start other young players and alternatives NOW."

Barca,3cniiy,Football_Enthusiast,12,Thu Jul 9 07:39:02 2015 UTC,"Long story short, I might have missed something as I skimmed through.  1- Messi does a tremendous job, he's a good player and without him Argentina wouldn't have reached as far into the WC and Copa America as they did. In WC Argentina won because Messi worked his magic.  2- Messi can't do everything on his own, he is dependant on his team.  3- Messi and his team didn't play well in the final, partialy because Chile did a good job hindering his play (which I find complete bs since they just fouled him all the time) but even so he had his moments.  4- Just because a team has Messi doesn't mean they automatically win, Messi had a tremendous season at Barcelona winning the treble. Instead of taking a relaxing breaks likes Iniesta and Busquets he's hammering the copa de america and he must be fatigued.  5- Mascherano should be captain instead of Messi"

The article was more about placing realistic expectations and criticism instead of singling out Messi as a scapegoat. But I skimmed through it fast and might have missed something, but he did praise Messi quite a bit."

Barca,3cnbrr,Not_Tom_Brady,5,Thu Jul 9 11:54:19 2015 UTC,"Pedro is a player you sub in when you need possession and stability more than anything. There is none of our bench players better than Pedro at keeping possession. Arda might become as good when he settles in, but alas he can't play until January.  Pedro isn't just a winger, he can basically play anywhere and do good and help us keeping possession - and he knows the team much better than both Rafinha, Arda and Munir. Then comes his insane work-rate, mentality and so on.  I highly doubt that if you were to ask Lucho, he would see Pedro as ""excess"" or redundant."
Barca,3cnbrr,kezorN,2,Thu Jul 9 12:18:57 2015 UTC,"Pedro isn't a starter. So he's a sub. Having too many subs is detrimental to everyone. Arda can play more positions than Pedro. Pedro was tried at midfield and at fullback. He didn't do well at either position. Munir is younger and has a solar system of potential. Rafinha is capable and understands the team.   So where does Pedro fit in? I just don't see him getting the minutes he wants or deserves.  Yeah it would be nice to have plan b,c,d, and e in case everyone gets injured, but that's not practical."

Barca,3cnbrr,porkchameleon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:12:53 2015 UTC,"Has anyone considered that we're shifting to a 4-2-3-1 system? Last season, Luis Enrique experimented with it when we had MSN+Pedro on the field (I can't remember specific games, but I definitely remember some experiments at the beginning). Messi could be completely being shifted to the center of the field and having even more of a supportive role. So Pedro and I guess Arda can slot in at the right. This would also help with our lack of midfield. My only worries is that this would be a radical shift from something that already works :/ Thoughts?"
Barca,3cnbrr,BentIraKey,2,Thu Jul 9 17:02:56 2015 UTC,Lucho experimented  4-2-3-1 system and it failed  as far as I remember. The double pivot included Mascherano and Busquets together. So in away games midfield was not creative and it was gruesome to watch?
Barca,3clvj3,ir7425,5,Wed Jul 8 22:40:04 2015 UTC,The weight on those curled diagonal long balls is downright astonishing. It could obvious to the defender that Messi's going to pass it that way... But the ridiculous accuracy makes it near impossible for any defender to intercept. Bloody amazing. That was one hell of a season!

But seeing all these quotes and interviews lately, he's really changing my mind. I really hope the new board doesn't sell him back. I would love to see him play for us."
Barca,3cjnvr,iwishiwasbased,24,Wed Jul 8 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"This is my imagining of what happened for Suárez when he came, maybe Arda will get a similar treatment....  Shortly after arriving in Barcelona Luis Suárez suddenly finds himself standing in a completely dark room near the FC Barcelona training grounds. A bright light goes on, right in his eyes and he sees the silhouette of a man put a small box down in front of him. Behind this man, he sees the silhouette of another, very small man who comes and steps up on the box, so close Luis can feel his breath on his face. He speaks a familiar Rioplatense Spanish, in a voice not unlike Kermit the Frog…..  ‘So, Luis, we meet again. But this time it is on my territory…’  The small man gets off the box so he can pace the room as he speaks, Luis hears whispers in Catalan behind him and strong hands on his shoulders push him down to his knees.  ‘I hear they call you “El Pistolero,” that you’re pretty hot-headed and dangerous, known for some…..bad behavior. Well, I’m here to tell you that’s not how things roll here at Barça. I run a tight ship and there is no time for that bullshit — the yelling, the diving, the stamping.  ‘You see this?’ A hand places some papers in front of Suárez’s face.’That’s a contract there, a pretty nice one in fact, between you and a certain sporting goods company that also sponsors me. There’s a lot of zeros on that contract for the money they’re gonna pay you, it would be shame if that all went away because I told them I didn’t want to work with you…  ‘And see this?' A hand holds football in his line of vision. 'They say it’s pretty hard to get this guy away from me when I play. You take a dive? You pitching a fit during a match? Your boot is never going to touch this baby in training.  ‘They say I’m pretty good a giving this guy away, too. Most chances in Europe created, I believe, and I give a lot of assists. Play your cards right, Luisito, and those passes might go your way and you might be getting another one of those shiny metal shoes for your collection. If not, I don’t know, I hear this Brazilian kid might be the next big thing...  ‘You see, Mr. Suárez, they don’t call me “The Little Dictator” for nothing.’"
Barca,3cjnvr,zazzlekdazzle,4,Wed Jul 8 17:19:29 2015 UTC,That was a beautiful story and I see where you're coming from. But Suarez didn't really play dirty at his time with Ajax and Liverpool. Yes he bit players but that was more of a sign of a lack of discipline than anything else.
Barca,3cjnvr,potatosss,7,Wed Jul 8 21:08:15 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily dirty (though there may have been some of that), but  with some ""bad behavior.""  He seems to have a good sense of humor about it, though."
Barca,3cjnvr,zazzlekdazzle,2,Wed Jul 8 21:13:48 2015 UTC,Awesome story telling man! Hats off!
Barca,3cjnvr,invice,6,Thu Jul 9 03:35:10 2015 UTC,Sometimes he losses his temper but he is a wonderful player. If he played really good in Atlético  I'm excited  to see how well he does in Barça.
Barca,3cjnvr,-Ozkr,7,Wed Jul 8 15:51:25 2015 UTC,"I think most of his temper is due to the team he was at. One of Simeone's qualities is that he's very good at making players eager to win, but that sometimes translates into irritability/aggression.  I remember watching a Madrid derby once and Madzukic was going crazy, he was almost begging for a red card, yet Simeone didn't sub him off. It wasn't because he was playing well, but because his temper was helping the team."
Barca,3cjnvr,iagolima,8,Wed Jul 8 16:33:13 2015 UTC,"He's no more hot-headed than Neymar, Suarez, Alba, or even Masche. I'm sure he'll settle in just fine"
Barca,3cjnvr,DivineVibrations,7,Wed Jul 8 17:14:05 2015 UTC,This feels like the Suarez signing all over again and I feel conflicted again. He's saying the right things though. Suarez went on to surprise me not because of his skill (we all knew about that) but with this attitude and composure. I hope it'll be the same with Turan.
Barca,3cjnvr,briliad,-2,Wed Jul 8 16:04:37 2015 UTC,"Not a fair comparison, Arda never bite three players and said the N-word five times to someone...  And just because the shoe incident, some people thinks Arda has bad attidue. Ironically there is actually very little precedence aside from this incident that justifies this image. Aside from the shoe incident, I've rarely seen Arda get angry. I remember the times when he receives a card he accepts it, just looks at a fellow player with a surprised face and continues or even walks off from the pitch."
Barca,3cjnvr,fcueva-,13,Wed Jul 8 16:13:36 2015 UTC,"The n-word? He said Negro. As much as i believe Suarez was an asshole, at the time, I highly doubt he meant it derogatory. My brother calls his daughter negrita in a loving way because she's a bit tan. Negro isn't just a derogatory word."
Barca,3cjnvr,DivineVibrations,-1,Wed Jul 8 16:44:37 2015 UTC,Then why did Suárez even pointed out about his skin color at all?   Something you can think about it...
Barca,3cjnvr,jwohaver,8,Thu Jul 9 06:54:05 2015 UTC,"""Negro"" is different in spanish languge, yes it means black but it isnt nearly as harsh as the real N-word or even the english Knee-grow, its kind of like calling a red head a ""ginger"""

You compare combined stats with the trident to individual stats overall. But how about team performance when those three start vs. when they don't? Or Messi's performance alongside Neymar/Suarez vs when one of them is out? Or even comparing with trident to the overall? I feel like that was your idea but you didn't quite follow through."

Barca,3cknhe,BreedingDiamonds,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:02:05 2015 UTC,"have Goals/minute and Assists/minute    Oops, i had that right in the first table then my mind had a brain fart.     team performance when those three start vs. when they don't?   Practically not possible. Because Messi played in all but 3 matches.    Those 3 were in the CDR. And both Neymar and Suarez didn't play those exact 3 CDR matches.     Messi's performance alongside Neymar/Suarez vs when one of them is out?     Added a table for this.    trident to the overall?     You mean removing the contribution of MSN from the Team Stats table (3rd table)?    Maybe when i get time. I am sort of surprised the Overall team Minutes/Goal stat(30.8) being better than when MSN is together (41.2) I am not a great stat man, maybe this is because there is duplication of data since MSN'-Together data is also in the Overall.    There were 48 matches where MSN didn't play the full 90. They were either Partially together or none were(3 matches as said before). Might have to take a look at those 48 matches i guess.   My idea was very limited. I just wanted to know what happens statistically when MSN are on the field at the same time rather than being partially together."
Barca,3cknhe,tgcg,2,Thu Jul 9 16:06:40 2015 UTC,"Liked your analysis. Just a thought, the assists counted include the assists to one of the other two. As you have all the data can you do the goals+assists count considering assists only when the goalscorer was any player other than MSN? I think that would give more accurate number."
Barca,3cknhe,tgcg,3,Wed Jul 8 19:11:29 2015 UTC,"As listed the Goals count is for only MSN but the assists are team wide, meaning assists MSN have among themselves and to other players while all 3 are on the field.    You asking for something else?"

Barca,3clofl,YoSoyMilkChocolate,3,Thu Jul 9 04:53:49 2015 UTC,Bartomeu and his gang of clowns have slowly destroyed La Masia.  And to think that useless human being might actually win the elections.
Barca,3clofl,Jrodtorres,6,Thu Jul 9 00:28:01 2015 UTC,This has nothing to do with that. We have Marc Andre ter Stegen who is 23 and will be a 'keeper for around 10 years most la masia keepers realize that they won't be a starter or maybe even a backup for some time so they are leaving to see playing time. Nothing wrong with that.
Barca,3clofl,FrostyGrass,2,Thu Jul 9 00:50:30 2015 UTC,It has everything to do with it in my opinion.  We've been losing great players since Rosell/Bartomeu took over and they don't seem to care.  You don't let your most talented players just walk away.    Read this article:  http://grup14.com/article/la-masia-controversial-decisions-negligence-and-irresponsibility
Barca,3clofl,Jrodtorres,5,Thu Jul 9 00:56:29 2015 UTC,In this case no it doesn't. He wouldn't be a starter or play for Barcas first team for at least 9 years. In other cases yes he is the problem.
Barca,3clofl,FrostyGrass,0,Thu Jul 9 01:02:58 2015 UTC,"Agee to disagree.  He's considered one of the best keeper prospect in all of Europe.  And he's 16, if he was 10 I would understand your argument."
Barca,3clofl,Jrodtorres,4,Thu Jul 9 01:08:47 2015 UTC,"That makes no sense. Wouldn't the fact that him being 10 makes it more likely he'll start for the first team, not less?"
Barca,3clofl,YoSoyMilkChocolate,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:57:37 2015 UTC,"Doesn't make any sense?... It's far riskier to predict a 10 year old than a 16 year old.  That's my point.  How does it make it more likely that a 10 year old will make it to the first team? That 10 year might not even be playing by 16.  The 16 year old has proven it at a much higher level.    Let's look at a major sport in the U.S, the MLB. In the baseball draft the high school players are a much riskier pick than college players because of their age and inexperience.  That's why college players are considered the safer pick in most of the cases.   It's a moot point... We could spend all day discussing this subject.  My original point was to express my disgust towards all the great young players that we've been losing to other clubs since Rosell and Bartomeu took over.  And unfortunately is looking like he might get re-elected."
Barca,3clofl,Jrodtorres,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"Only 10? I'd say he could go 15 - look at Gigi Buffon, Dino Zoff or Edwin van der Saar sticking it out. The boy clearly has legendary potential. How many players can say they were the starting goalkeeper for a club that won the domestic cup and the UEFA Champions League at only 23 years old?"
Barca,3clofl,YoSoyMilkChocolate,0,Thu Jul 9 04:55:43 2015 UTC,Oh I'm not saying he can't go past 10 years I was just using that in my example because no 16 year old is gonna wait 10 years for a starting position when he is 26 especially when they are talented. Just trying to make the point that the move for the kid is a decent one for his career because maybe he sees not future with barca.

We talk about it like it's on his behalf, but it's really for us.    I'm sure Messi feels super shitty about losing in those finals, but I don't think he is up nights fretting over whether he will be considered the best that ever walked the planet because of those losses or because Cristiano Ronaldo beat him out for the Pichichi or the Ballon d'Or.    He's not the first person I would invite to my book group, but the man is no idiot when it comes to real life.  He has a beautiful family with a kid who is the center of his universe (soon to have another), more money than he or his entire family and heirs could ever use, and a charitable organization that helps kids in need (like he was at one time).  I don't think it will be all that hard for him to make his peace with his life and his legacy; the bellyaching and verbal bare-knuckle boxing from fans is a waste of time."

Barca,3ck8sb,TheGreatXavi,3,Wed Jul 8 23:48:35 2015 UTC,"Not even close, most of us wanted verrati and had to almost settle for pogba once rumors started breaking out."
Barca,3ck8sb,jimtheguy69,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:33:43 2015 UTC,Don't. I only want him because  apparently the club wants a very expensive young midfielder. And I'd take Veratti over Pogba any day. Do we need him? No. But we need Pogba even less.
Barca,3ck8sb,JurijFedorov,28,Fri Jul 10 00:51:33 2015 UTC,"I know horizontal stripes are against tradition, but I must say, the kit looks really good to me :/"

Barca,3ck8sb,IhateAngryBirds,16,Wed Jul 8 16:54:02 2015 UTC,"lol, since this is the unpopular opinion thread, I honestly feel like Suarez has a weird body shape for a footballer"
Barca,3ck8sb,domi_28,3,Wed Jul 8 17:18:08 2015 UTC,I also think he looks like a horse when he runs. Isn't really that quick either.

Barca,3ck8sb,JurijFedorov,2,Fri Jul 10 00:54:00 2015 UTC,I gave in and bought one. The fit and the material is not as nice as the old ones so I'm a bit disappointed about that :(
Barca,3ck8sb,pouty_mcpouterson,14,Wed Jul 8 22:07:46 2015 UTC,"I think Bartomeu is a great president. LOL JK  But seriously, I think Arda Turan is a better buy than Pogba or Verratti. You can't underestimate the importance of knowing the league/having experience with it, and his ability is as good as both of those two, with a mix of their physique.  Also I'm not sure it's an unpopular opinion but holy shit our new kit is atrocious, and not just because of the horizontal stripes."
Barca,3ck8sb,kezorN,7,Wed Jul 8 16:56:28 2015 UTC,"I think there are too many fans right now that only care about results instead of internal matters within the club, but I admit, I was one of those fans several years back."

Barca,3ck8sb,emasterman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:52:12 2015 UTC,"Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but earlier in his career he would run and track back a lot more, and it was a coaching advice from Pep that got him saving his energy for attacking."
Barca,3ck8sb,LeRocket,2,Thu Jul 9 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"He used to run with Pep too, I'd say him conserving energy started in Pep's last year. At least that I noticed."
Barca,3ck8sb,tadm123,2,Thu Jul 9 02:53:20 2015 UTC,"Same for me.  I remember him tracking back a lot more during Pep's first years.   Also, he was playing more as a winger in those years.  Maybe that is part of the reason."
Barca,3ck8sb,LeRocket,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:06:10 2015 UTC,Me to. But he is not allowed to run. His trainers forbid him running to much - so there is that.
Barca,3ck8sb,JurijFedorov,10,Fri Jul 10 00:57:05 2015 UTC,"I've seen this be both a popular and unpopular opinion, depending on the ""climate"" the team is in, but I am EXTREMELY happy that Barça renewed Dani. Vidal might be a great option, I haven't seen him play much, but I never thought Montoya or Adriano could even come close to what Dani has contributed throughout the years and what he meant for the team last season."
Barca,3ck8sb,ciscolombia,7,Wed Jul 8 16:33:36 2015 UTC,I think signing Vidal was more important than resigning Alves long term.
Barca,3ck8sb,YoSoyMilkChocolate,29,Wed Jul 8 19:37:15 2015 UTC,I'm not a huge fan of Messi. I can see how good he is but I'm just not a fan. Runs away

Barca,3ck8sb,silentpotato30,16,Thu Jul 9 00:47:12 2015 UTC,Upvoted for actually being an unpopular opinion.
Barca,3ck8sb,DrizzleHydration,10,Wed Jul 8 16:21:12 2015 UTC,Just curious why?
Barca,3ck8sb,Brompton_Cocktail,25,Wed Jul 8 16:16:37 2015 UTC,Clinical depression is my guess.
Barca,3ck8sb,sexistt,4,Wed Jul 8 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I'm not really sure. It's not like I dislike him. It's just that I've never been a fan."
Barca,3ck8sb,silentpotato30,2,Thu Jul 9 00:11:34 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, how often do you watch Barca play? I'm talking full matches here.  I ask because this was the first season I started watching Barça regularly, and at first it wasn't clear to me how Messi was contributing if he wasn't scoring or assisting. I knew intellectually that he's an amazing player, but I didn't feel him in my gut, if that makes any sense.  But after watching him week in, week out for a couple of months, I saw that he touches practically every aspect of Barça's play. This gave me a different perspective on him."
Barca,3ck8sb,DaniMetroplex,2,Thu Jul 9 04:57:55 2015 UTC,"Almost 8 years now. I've missed quite a few matches to be fair.   It's not like I don't think that he's good. He is. He thoroughly deserves everything that he has a won (Personal accolades). When I said I wasn't a fan, I didn't mean that I disliked him or his style of play if that's what your doubt was about. I'm just indifferent to him I guess?"
Barca,3ck8sb,silentpotato30,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:47:35 2015 UTC,"I asked because I've heard sentiment similar to what you expressed from people who don't watch Barça very often, and because my own perception of Messi evolved the more I watched him. But if that's your opinion after all those years, I respect that.  Also, I'm not saying this is the case with you, but I think some people are turned off by what is perceived as an inaccessible personality. Even a lot of the media coverage of him has a slightly sterile quality, with people slinging statistics at each other. I see how someone could be a tad ambivalent about him.  Contrast this with a player like Suarez, who, however people feel about him, they do so in their gut. He's an intensely emotional person, so it's easy to respond to him in a visceral way. Coverage about him tends to be more like ZOMG AMAZING NUTMEG TRIPLE SALCHOW TO THE FAR POST, or ZOMG HE DID THE BAD THING AGAIN WHAT A TERRIBLE PERSON.  Note: I originally accidentally posted this elsewhere in the thread. I've deleted that reply and put this one where it belongs."
Barca,3ck8sb,DaniMetroplex,2,Thu Jul 9 16:40:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah well I don't blame you. I never did fully explain myself until asked to. Barca will always be a major part of my life, with or without Messi. Let's just leave it at that :)"

Barca,3ck8sb,JurijFedorov,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:52:48 2015 UTC,"To be fair, only Ronaldinho and Xavi. Xavi still isn't what he used to be but he still is my favourite. I still haven't gotten over his departure."

Barca,3ck8sb,pradeep23,19,Thu Jul 9 13:46:00 2015 UTC,I don't think Brazil should have replaced Thiago silva as captain of Brazil with Neymar. I don't think he's ready for that role yet
Barca,3ck8sb,Brompton_Cocktail,24,Wed Jul 8 16:17:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's an unpopular opinion, I love Neymar but he's still young and needs to grow as a player before wearing the armband."

Barca,3ck8sb,Aj16ay,7,Wed Jul 8 17:21:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think any 22 year old should be captain of a national team. Even if they were mature for their age, it's a huge insult for the 30 year olds."
Barca,3ck8sb,CorsarioNero,5,Wed Jul 8 17:51:26 2015 UTC,"they should definitely replace Silva after his mental crack down shit show, and honestly they don't have a lot of very good options. Neymar is definitely not a perfect fit, but I think they could have done worse."
Barca,3ck8sb,shanigan,19,Wed Jul 8 17:58:19 2015 UTC,"I can't for the love of god understand why Sergi Roberto is still in this squad.. He's the definition of 'playing it safe' and hasn't done anything remotely worthy of a place in the 1st team for years. Sure he might be slightly better that average against the dominant powerhouse of Elche or the mighty Eibar, but i don't think he's good enough or ever will be better than average.  I'd be happy to hear if someone is able to make me realise his potential. Bare in mind that this is just my opinion."
Barca,3ck8sb,Duffer44,14,Wed Jul 8 16:16:01 2015 UTC,"Sometimes playing it safe is also important. We won't get a player who would be ready to sit on the bench, no complain and is also a good passer of the ball(good not exceptionally good), and is very well versed in the Barca system. To expect that out of a player who might not even get 200-300 minutes playtime is not realistic.  My 2 cents. I love him only because of his attitude and the la Masia factor. Any player ready to do anything for this club has my support at all times, no conditions asked"
Barca,3ck8sb,invice,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:23:09 2015 UTC,"Playing it safe doesn't mean that you don't make mistakes, which he does, that's also why i don't see what his contribution to the team is, besides rotating and occasionally playing him in cup games. I get what you mean though, i just think a player like Samper is better and have over-all better potential. But hey, what do i know, it's easy pointing fingeres behind a screen."
Barca,3ck8sb,Duffer44,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:35:12 2015 UTC,"The point is you need such players who can play the easy games and Roberto is the best for it. Free, good attitude, patient, and technically fine. He will make mistakes, he is human after all, but to fill in those shit games that we have to play that are too easy are just the best for him.  Samper will be a completely different player Imo. He has the skills and is brilliant technically. He can't and shouldn't play Roberto's place. He is too good to become that"
Barca,3ck8sb,invice,3,Wed Jul 8 16:55:22 2015 UTC,"The point is you need such players who can play the easy games and Roberto is the best for it.   Well i guess that is subjective, as i think Samper would be ideal, even-though it's not his preferred position. I assume the reason why you are in favor of Roberto is because you don't wan't to risk Samper not getting playing time or is it because you think Roberto is a genuinely better player? If it's the first, don't you think it would be more beneficial for sampers development to play those matches Roberto does?"
Barca,3ck8sb,Duffer44,5,Wed Jul 8 17:09:14 2015 UTC,"I think that Samper is way better and can play tougher games than, lets say cwc games and against lower league teams"
Barca,3ck8sb,invice,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"Samper is better without question.  The question is, would you rather have Roberto or Samper wasting away on the bench.

Barca,3ck8sb,BarcaChaldo,22,Wed Jul 8 20:08:52 2015 UTC,"It's been quite controversial, but I don't think Pogba is the right move for us. There are a handful of players that deserve a 12M wage  in the entire world, and a 22 year old is not one of them; I don't care about his potential. If he were to earn it after a few seasons that's a different story.  My second qualm is his agent, Raoila is a piece of shit who loves to stir the pot to get his way. He's a slime ball and that's the last thing we need considering the amount of drama we go through with the board, transfers, etc.  As sketchy as Arda's transfer was that was probably the smartest move. He seems to be a very modest person who realizes the blessing he has been given to play for us. He admires our players and won't push to start/get minutes over our legendary players. He'll make an immediate impact and he will make room for youth in just a few seasons.  My 2 cents."
Barca,3ck8sb,Marchisio,12,Wed Jul 8 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is an unpopular opinion, at least among us Barca fans.

La Masia products are not good enough to keep pushing the envelope into even greater levels of play, they can barely keep up. Veratti would be good to maintain the current level, but a player like Pogba would help keep pushing into higher levels of play and it its crucial we land him."

Barca,3ck8sb,Aj16ay,6,Wed Jul 8 19:17:10 2015 UTC,People just don't realize how bad things are going to be if Bartomeu is elected...  Last time the club spent too much money on building a new stadium they had to sell the best player at the time (Luis Suarez) to get some of the money back. Not to mention that Ratface will probably sell the name of the stadium to Qatar at some point.
Barca,3ck8sb,IhateAngryBirds,10,Wed Jul 8 19:39:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, it will be awful. Espai Barça will go ahead, that's €600m+ on a project that doesn't even have a plan yet. We can expect a name like ""Qatar Airways Camp Nou"" to help finance it, but if the shirt deal is anything to go by we will get a fraction of the money we could. I don't believe it really, going from Unicef on the front, to money grabbing whores that put Qatar on the front, Intel on the inside and Beko on the sleeve. And then people believe bullshit like ""we can't buy players without sponsorships""; yet we financed deals for Dani Alves, Mascherano, Chygrynskiy, Cesc, Alexis, Villa, Ibra without the money. And then not to mention La Masia situation. We have talented players who leave because they can't play, or others like Abou who are not treated properly. A B team that gets relegated because they don't have a proper coach. Absurd release fees on players like Thiago and Bartra that allow them to leave. It's so sad, conservative socis who are blinded by sporting success and afraid of change will let rat face continue destroying the club."

Barca,3ck8sb,_madmartigan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:45:15 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with this, he has definitely shown his passion for the badge and has the talent to back it up, which is why he is often likened to Puyol. Unfortunately, with transfers, both last year and this year, I think his time to truly shine and get regular minutes is slipping away at an alarming rate. I see nothing but more bench time for him next season. It's unfortunate too because his transition into a starting CB alongside Pique would have been similar to that of Pique's alongside Puyol. With Mascherano having a stellar season last season and Mathieu providing steady rotation, his situation is another classic (and unfortunate) example of just budding into the squad with unlucky timing. In addition, Masch and Mathieu are both at the awkward age of 31 to the point where they are in the latter stages of their careers but still have a few years left in them and are still somewhat in their primes.  Best (but unlikely) case scenario: He continues working hard, unseats Masch or Mathieu toward the end of next season and at the still fairly young age of 25 becomes the starter alongside pique for the following season. I'm not going to hold my breath."

Barca,3ck8sb,IhateAngryBirds,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:38:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit skeptical of Aleix Vidal. I'm not sure if he can replace Alves, arguably our best ever RB. I mean, Vidal has only played as RB in a handful of games near the end of the season. Sure, Dani Alves is known more for his ability to link up with Messi and bomb up the right wing, but he's capable of defending when he needs to (e.g. against Ronaldo). Vidal, on the other hand, is not a natural defender.  Also, as much as people hate Qatar, I still think it's important to have a shirt sponsor to stay competitive. Sure, maybe not Qatar, but at least somebody."

Barca,3ck8sb,Marchisio,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:20:14 2015 UTC,"Even with a more direct style, we need a dedicated central midfielder who can keep the ball and dictate tempo.

His support of LaPorta, who got us into a tremendous financial mess doesn't help him in my eyes in the least.   know your role. shake hands, kiss babies, stfu."

I've heard very conflicting stuff about this. /u/IhateAngryBirds, do you know more? Or anyone else clsely following the elections?  And Cruijff is indeed very controversial in his thoughts, but be damn sure that he wants the best for the club."
Barca,3ck8sb,jklz,8,Wed Jul 8 18:57:17 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it was bullshit. It was Rosell and co attempting to smear Laporta's image after they fell out.
Barca,3ck8sb,Aj16ay,6,Wed Jul 8 19:15:55 2015 UTC,"It is bullshit.  Rosell (and later pursued by Bartomeu) tried to sue Laporta for that, but there was no proof of it, and Laporta was declared innocent. Not sure why people still believe the club lost money during Laportas presidency.  In fact the club lost a lot of money in legal fees for trying to sue him."

Barca,3ck8sb,elanciano31,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:56:08 2015 UTC,"I can see how Cruyff can be irritating. He has his idea of how football should be play and he thinks anyone who disagree is a dumbass. But he is more often than not correct.  Stop the opposition from playing from the back, Controlling the center of the pitch, maximize attacking width, create scoring chances by quick positional play rather than static passing. These are just some of Cruyff's ideas that had revolutionized football and copied by most of the tops teams and coaches."

The package I have is $10/month (looks like they have changed pricing and it would be $25/month, but you would get basic cable channels too) and has beIN sports, so you get all of La Liga and Copa matches live in HD.  You can watch it on your computer, iPhone, Android, Roku, xbox one, and a few others.  The only downside is not getting CL, but here in the US the game is on during work so I watch a replay from r/footballhighlights.  I got so tired of trying to find a good stream, the $10 a month is well worth it.  Plus I can watch it on my TV with a normal remote instead of being huddled around my computer."

It freezes a couple times per game and you have to kill the app on the iphone, start it back up, and then resend the airplay.  I wouldn't suggest it if you're wanting to watch it on a tv unless you have no other option.  For $20 a month you think they could develop a useful app.  If you're just going to watch on a computer then go for it."

Barca,3cirma,polechi33,55,Wed Jul 8 14:47:01 2015 UTC,"I'll start off. Many of you may know this already, but this is one of my favorite pieces of Barça-related trivia. In the first couple years that Johan Cruyff was a player for Barça when Franco was still alive, there were many restrictions in place that suppressed Catalan culture. One such ban was that people were not allowed to name their baby with a Catalan name.   Jordi is one of the most popular Catalan names. Jordi is the patron saint of Catalunya, for example. So Jordi was a name that was banned at that time. Cruyff's son was born in 1974. To show incredible support of Barça and Catalunya, him and his wife flew back to Holland, she gave birth to their son and named him Jordi (which was obviously allowed in Holland), then returned to Barcelona.   It should also be noted that just a week or two after returning to Barcelona, Cruyff and the team went to the Bernabeu and beat Real Madrid 0-5 in one of the most historic clasicos. You've gotta love a big fuck you to Franco and Real Madrid."
Barca,3cirma,invice,18,Wed Jul 8 06:08:33 2015 UTC,"Oh my god. My love for Cruyff keeps on increasing and increasing. The guy was not even from the land, did not owe them anything to go so out of the way to support Catalonia, but he did. Awesome, just awesome. He is as Catalonian as they can get."

Finally, one member said the whole discussion had turned into a 'pot full of crickets' (olla de grillos), which means all noise and no way of undestanding.  Hans Gamper heard him, and drew exactly that: a sort of cauldron-shaped logo, with Sant Jordi's cross on the left, the Catalan flag on the right, and the club colors below. And this has been our crest ever since.  Bonus fact: if you see a Barça crest reading 'CFB' instead of 'FCB', it means it's from the era between 1939 and 1974. The Franco regime forced everything into Spanish, and Barça was no exception. Fútbol Club Barcelona turned into Club de Fútbol Barcelona."

Barca,3cgfe6,Mentosfruitcore,2,Wed Jul 8 02:21:27 2015 UTC,"Indeed. But so far it seems that the club has helped Suarez become much less ""dirty"" in general, so I'm thinking the same can be done with Arda - although he should obviously still keep his fighting/winning mentality."

But yeah, I won't say it was the smartest thing Arda did but it's nothing compared to what kind of things Suárez did. And Messi isn't a saint either who launched a shot against the Madrid crowd at Bernabeu.    doing rash challenges etc   In truth, however, there are probably far more instances of your players physically abusing Turan than him acting like a 'thug' to your team. Anyone remember Mascherano's psychotic two-footed tackle at Arda during the quarter final in CL at season 13/14?"

Barca,3cgfe6,harelort,2,Wed Jul 8 00:05:16 2015 UTC,Yes but the coach welcoming a new player is something normal and doesn't say that Lucho actually asked for him to be signed. It also sounded like it was the first time they talk. If Lucho really wanted him he must have at least talked with him over the phone before to tell him why he wants him and what his role will be...  I'm just saying..
Barca,3cgfe6,Duke--Nukem,5,Wed Jul 8 00:21:17 2015 UTC,"He didn't welcome Douglas like that. He might be a pretty bad example because, well, it's Douglas, but I just think Turan is the kind of player Lucho likes. Great work-rate, discipline and technical ability. I definitely think Arda will be here when the transfer window ends."
Barca,3cgfe6,harelort,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:26:18 2015 UTC,I am not saying that Turan is not a good player. I like him a lot. We're just discussing possible political moves by the board.
Barca,3cgfe6,Duke--Nukem,3,Wed Jul 8 00:33:09 2015 UTC,"Not exclusively. Besides, whether it's a political move or not seems a bit futile to me. I very much believe Lucho asked for this signing, and the transfer won't be reversed if it was made by his request.  What annoys me about this signing, is that it was finalized by the management committee without a president, even though we usually don't allow something like that."
Barca,3cgfe6,harelort,2,Wed Jul 8 00:48:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. If Enrique didn't want Turan in the first place then he didn't have to talk to him (Enrique is also on vacation). The option to sell Turan to another club before 20 July comes earlier than when the team returns to train for the upcoming season, so he can avoid any sort of contact if he wanted to.  Edit: Frankly, I'm surprised by this whole thing. It does seem like Enrique wanted Turan, the timing is simply terrible with all of the political ruckus hanging over our heads."

Barca,3cgfe6,mrcultural911,2,Wed Jul 8 01:10:47 2015 UTC,higher wages + wanted to play for a bigger club. Never underestimate the financial angle in such things. Probably the reason why he left galatasaray for atletico in first place.

Though my ultimate signing would've been either Verratti or Kovacic but then there's the discussion about Masia players and time. If we'd have gotten either of those it might have hindered Samper/Halilovics development if not properly controlled.."
Barca,3cgfe6,joesugarman,4,Tue Jul 7 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"I'm actually tired of seeing halilovics' name up first. He hasn't done anything yet. Hasn't even been the best player in barça B. First we need to talk about rafinha, or Denis suarez.  These have more of a shot.  And don't get me wrong,  I get where u are coming from and know that you just mentioned 2 names but halilovic hasn't done shit yet. Let him grow in the B team"
Barca,3cgfe6,mrnoor,3,Tue Jul 7 22:24:09 2015 UTC,"Ooh of course I'm speaking about Rafinha as a first team player now seeing as he's been here a while now and already did his loan spell at celta. And Denis asking of course get his chance before Halilovic, I was looking at about 3 years from now. Iniesta probably won't be here by the season after that, Rakitic will have some years in him.  I guess my point is that it might not be a bad thing to have signed someone that will be almost 29 by his first game compared to spend quite a bit more for someone a lot younger when we have got youngings gunning up :)"

Barca,3cgujl,godie,4,Wed Jul 8 01:19:13 2015 UTC,Well he's probably thinking/hoping Samper can be tried out in a CM role (same as Arda/Rafinha) because there is no chance he would bench Busquets
Barca,3cgujl,Aj16ay,6,Wed Jul 8 02:12:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Samper's defensive game is quite lacking. Unless he really improves that part of his game (it's possible, Busi did the same), he really needs a destroyer next to him to be able to play at defensive midfield for us.  Samper has played all midfield positions in the youth teams. I'm very confident in his abilities to convert to the CM position, but it's of course up to the coach to try him out there. He has it all to play there; his vision, passing, dribbling, ability to keep the ball under pressure. The only thing he hasn't shown yet, and what Xavi did show: the ability to run for 13 km every match. And I think that's more easily trainable than the defensive 'weakness'."
Barca,3cgujl,jklz,4,Wed Jul 8 07:53:42 2015 UTC,He could replace mascherano in a double pivot

Barca,3cgoi8,zevah,6,Tue Jul 7 20:53:22 2015 UTC,I thought fans wanted Simeone. Which would you prefer?
Barca,3cgoi8,felixisfalling,17,Tue Jul 7 22:28:14 2015 UTC,I think Simeone is favorite not only because he is a good coach but he is also Argentinian and I doubt AFA would appoint a coach who isn't Argentinian.  But if Pep wants to coach Argentina I think AFA should give him a chance.
Barca,3cgoi8,Football_Enthusiast,4,Tue Jul 7 22:37:16 2015 UTC,"I can totally see them going for Simeone over Pep, but honestly that'd be a tough choice for any board to make."
Barca,3cgoi8,felixisfalling,2,Tue Jul 7 22:48:41 2015 UTC,"I think AFA will appoint Simeone, Pep is a tactical genius and he is superior than Simeone but I think AFA will prefer Simeone more.  However there is one problem with Simeone though, his son Giovanni Simeone plays for Argentina U21 who will eventually be considered to play for the senior team. There will be some people who would accuse Diego Simeone for nepotism if he picks Giovanni over someone else although I don't know how good Giovanni Simeone is on pitch."
Barca,3cgoi8,Football_Enthusiast,3,Wed Jul 8 04:51:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know, that's a hard question.  On one hand Pep is arguably better on the other hand Simeone is Argentinian and knows what it's like to represent the NT.  I wouldn't mind any of them tbh XD"
Barca,3cgoi8,zevah,3,Tue Jul 7 22:33:16 2015 UTC,"I like Simeone at Argentina. But I always thought Pep would go to Italy because of his tactical prowess, doubt he'd coach RFEF. Maybe the Catalan NT like Cruyff did until 2013."
Barca,3cgoi8,felixisfalling,13,Tue Jul 7 22:47:54 2015 UTC,"Amazing. I would have loved to see that. No doubt he would be a rejuvenating presence into the team instead of the has-beens Scolari and Dunga...you don't deny Pep like that. I understand pride is important, but Pep is a tactical genius. No guarantees he would have won the World Cup, but damn if you don't have a better chance just by having a guy like him manage the squad."

It seems immoral for the current temporary board to buy the player before the results when a potentially new president may have to deal with it.   Let's say that Laporta is elected as president. If he does not agree with Turan's signing, he'll sell Turan back to ATM. That's very disrespectful to the player and the club. This hypothetical situation could have been avoided by not taking the decision to buy the player before the election results are out.   This is my opinion, anyway. Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm not."
Barca,3ci7yr,KushGangar,2,Wed Jul 8 16:04:22 2015 UTC,"All true, which is why ideally it should be Coach making such sporting decisions not the President doing fancy buys for their own legacy.    If Lucho wants Arda, he should stay. If he doesn't those who bought him are idiots and are over stepping on Lucho's responsibilities.    I hope the former is more true to reality."
Barca,3ci7yr,iVarun,2,Wed Jul 8 16:46:56 2015 UTC,"So it's not really shady.. It's just a bit wreckless.   I hope we keep him, he's a hard worker. Dunno why a president would sell him back... That's so dramatic, it's damaging to our image, and it's a player our coach specifically asked for. I couldn't agree more with Lucho. Arda has been one of the engines for Atletico for the last couple years."

Arda is a top player and I think he would add a lot to our team. He's strong, tough, and indimidating. These are some things we lack. That beard yo."
Barca,3ci7yr,tonytetova,6,Wed Jul 8 03:30:21 2015 UTC,No one is sending Leonidas back. He and Vidal were Lucho's requests for next year. Any president should have bought them unless they believe that the best way to start their term is to screw with the coach who just won a treble.

I think the biggest obstacle for Lee will be regaining his form after missing out on all club action for over a year. His dip in form was clearly evident in youth tournaments with the u18 South Korean team. When Lee returns to everyday football, I'm sure he'll regain his form, much like Suarez had to do after returning from suspension.  Also, Lee has a much tougher first XI to break into than Messi had at the same age. Messi became a regular starter in 2006/07, keeping Giuly, Saviola and Gudjohnsen on the bench. Lee would have to outperform Neymar, Suarez and Pedro to get a place in the team. So while its not impossible, it will be incredibly difficult for Lee to become 'the next Messi.'"

Barca,3cgnkh,Illegal_sal,14,Tue Jul 7 19:35:18 2015 UTC,"And water is wet....  I'm willing to bet there aren't many players in the world that wouldn't want to play for us, and it's clear as day that PSG are absolutely unwilling to sell any player to us (i.e. Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, etc.).....  Nice to hear that there's someone else besides the fans interested in him. He's a stunning player."

Barca,3cgnkh,harimaginko,6,Wed Jul 8 09:10:45 2015 UTC,I hope this kind of behavior from PSG will make players think twice about joining them in the first place.
Barca,3cgnkh,MayIHaveAHug,14,Tue Jul 7 20:00:42 2015 UTC,"By this type of behavior do you mean attempting to hold on to one of their best players until his contract runs out? I know that players can appear to be sympathetic figures when there are reports out there that the players want to leave and the clubs wont let them, but the clubs are not always in the wrong. Players sign longterm contracts and teams are fully within their rights to uphold them. Further, this sort of message from an agent is almost always floated out as a means of gaining leverage in negotiations with the club in hopes of getting a better contract."
Barca,3cgnkh,Barcalaw30,6,Tue Jul 7 20:18:54 2015 UTC,It's totally OK... Just do not go Real Madrid...
Barca,3cgnkh,ManhoiL,3,Wed Jul 8 03:21:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting... He has a contract until 2019 so I don't think PSG will be selling any time soon, but the fact that his agent said this gives us a picture of where Marco's head is at."
Barca,3cgnkh,HippoNigga,2,Tue Jul 7 20:07:28 2015 UTC,"Where his head is at? I don't think that's necessarily the case, amost every soccer player ""would like to play for Barca"" at some point in there career...This is very plain language that shows no intent, desire, or willingness to leave his current team for Barca........."
Barca,3cgnkh,Marchisio,3,Tue Jul 7 20:12:15 2015 UTC,Well I mean in the sense that he doesn't have a desire to stay at PSG for his entire career if he'd like to come to Barça
Barca,3cgnkh,HippoNigga,2,Tue Jul 7 20:32:16 2015 UTC,Dude PSG is always breaking our balls. I hope we never sell them a player.

On one hand we have a great keeper in his prime, and coming off a great season and a Copa America win. On the other we have a very good young keeper who is going to be our keeper of the future.  I think Claudio has performed so well he's earned the number 1 Liga spot. Although I'd love to see Ter Stegen play more... Personally I'm torn on the situation."

Barca,3cgieb,Barcalaw30,4,Wed Jul 8 03:52:46 2015 UTC,"I think he is wonderful, but I am not sure how sustainable the two-keeper model can be. It is obvious that it worked last year for us and the year before that for Madrid, but I don't think it is sustainable in the long term. I can see this becoming a huge issue in the next year or so, especially because keepers tend to stay in top form until their mid to late thirties. I highly doubt that ATS will want to stay on for that long only getting around 20 matches per year."
Barca,3cgieb,GreenSkyFish,3,Tue Jul 7 20:23:26 2015 UTC,"Barcelona right now has the supreme luxury of having 2 fantastic keepers.   It's a difficult one...regardless of how much I like Ter Stegen, I do think Bravo is the #1 keeper right now. I would keep him for league, and Ter Stegen for tournaments. Ter Stegen's time will come when he is the #1, but right now Bravo is performing at the peak of his career."
Barca,3cgieb,iVarun,2,Wed Jul 8 02:46:25 2015 UTC,"3rd Best season by a Goal Keeper in the history of Liga. That is what he did last season.   Going forward i think its going to be real tricky. Both the GK's are on top form. It was easier to keep them for separate tournaments last season as both were having their 1st season so no one would have used the I'm Here Longer card.    But now they will want to play in competition they haven't, which can be tricky. Bravo will want UCL and MaTS Liga.   I'd do a complete shift of last season. MaTS for Liga only and Bravo for UCL and Copa. That is the best neutral solution since i don't think anyone can make a judgement call on this because both have been exemplary."

But I'm not Messi and I'm definitely much more hot headed than he is. He won't take a break or retire anytime soon. He is an eager and determined man and he's not giving up on international trophy yet."

Barca,3cfxds,xFragg,29,Tue Jul 7 16:59:06 2015 UTC,"This may sound dumb but I hope he does. A break, not retire. When Argentina start to look like an ordinary team, start losing important WC Qualifier matches, wonder who will feed passes to Higuain(hahaha just kidding) and Agüero, then they will realize how important Leo is. He's playing for a country that gave him nothing, except a lot of fans giving him shit for not scoring a hattrick while being guarded heavily during the final. So Leo should take a break, so all the stupid ""pecho frio"" and ""Messi can only perform in barca"" fans can suffer."
Barca,3cfxds,drewsufff,6,Tue Jul 7 17:39:25 2015 UTC,"Eh, stupid fans will always be stupid. When they see Argentina failing they will just say that Argentina has always failed with Messi. They will probably not realize that they will fail harder without him -- that's why they're stupid fans. If Messi takes a break, I can't see them saying upon his return ""wow Messi I was wrong, we need you!"" And if Argentina were to fail again they would just put it on Messi again despite seeing that Argentina didn't play well in his absence."
Barca,3cfxds,drewsufff,4,Wed Jul 8 03:49:53 2015 UTC,Also wouldn't it be hilarious but tragic for Leo if they somehow start winning everything in his absence. It wouldn't make any sense but it would be a funny coincidence
Barca,3cfxds,Barcalaw30,6,Wed Jul 8 03:50:56 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind this was published by Ole, which is the local newspaper that published the attack on him yesterday. From what I have been reading, he has been considering taking a break from some of the upcoming international friendlies, but he would come back to the team for the World Cup qualifiers. It honestly would not be a big deal either way because the team does not have a lot going on until the Centenario next year. I highly doubt that he would be gone for any important matches, but I can definitely see the possibility that he may take a break from friendlies for the next six months or so."
Barca,3cfxds,iVarun,3,Tue Jul 7 17:48:42 2015 UTC,0 chance that he'll sit out any non-friendlies if fit.    Not playing the Qualifiers and then getting in for the WC's. That is a non-starter even for a player of the quality of Messi. Its a question of principle Messi or not.

Esport3 had a poll where they asked people if they agreed with Arda Turan's signing (not specifically the player, but because of how he was signed). There was a vast majority that disagreed with it.   I wonder if that decision actually hurt Bartomeu instead of that it helped him. Probably not.   Benedito seems like a good guy, shame that he isn't really a man with a lot of charisma.  I actually like a lot about what Freixa has been saying. It's a shame that he was a part of Rosell's board without any rebellion though."

He was part of this board for many years and I don't see where he has space which would allow him to make a distance from Bartomeu and Rosell. For me he is just a mouthpiece to praise the work of current board. It wouldn't surprise me if he decide in the final days of campaign to withdraw.  Looking at the whole campaign so far I was surprised that there is a lack of bigger negativity among candidates. Especially from the challengers who don't attack current board that much about Rosell's legacy. Bartomeu didn't give up on Rosell and calls him ""his friend"". The campaign should eventually shift in this direction."

I'm not at all suggesting that the depth we get with Arda is a bad thing, I'm just curious how Lucho is going to balance them.

Barca,3cfeyc,Illegal_sal,47,Tue Jul 7 14:18:17 2015 UTC,"Unless he's Pogba, Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, David Luiz, Cuadrado... I could go on  This is RM galacticos mentallity..."
Barca,3cfeyc,IhateAngryBirds,5,Tue Jul 7 14:20:36 2015 UTC,exactly what I was thinking. I almost read    because we are Real Madrid.
Barca,3cfeyc,MoneyForNothing_,2,Tue Jul 7 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"I thought the galacticos mentality was sell the good players to buy whoevers hot at the moment. We aren't selling Pique to buy Hummels, we aren't selling Rakitic to buy Schweinsteiger, that's Galactico. Selling good players(Di Maria, Özil) for new ones, very rapidly. Iniesta is declining, we need someone young and extremely talented, no offense to Samper or Roberto(he's one of my favorites) but Pogba seems like the best choice. Given his age, his contract with Juve, his potential, and the fact he already plays in Europe, he won't be cheap, not a surprise. Look at Neymar's transfer. We are not Real Madrid, buying necessary players is not Galactico mentality. Turan isn't exactly a necessary player though."
Barca,3cfeyc,xFragg,6,Tue Jul 7 17:43:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know how you got the definition of Galacticos, but no team on earth has the strategy of selling ""good"" players to buy overpriced players. Galacticos Mentality is going after star players and signing them regardless of the cost and assembling a team full of superstars, nothing to do with selling players. so by default the motto for the Galacticos' mentality is ""we are a giant power, if we want a player we sign him regardless of obstacles"" which is what Barto said"
Barca,3cfeyc,domi_28,5,Tue Jul 7 19:22:51 2015 UTC,"Well then why did they sell Robben, Sneijder, Di Maria, Ozil, Higuain, Huntelaar, Robinho, Makalele etc, they have to sell good players to afford the ""stars"", they sold Ozil and Di Maria so they could bring in Bale, that is the Galacticos policy, its about signing players which don't even necessarily fit the team at any cost just because they are stars.  Real Madrid don't have infinite resources, the way the Galacticos policy works is its a continuous conveyor belt of stars, they need fresh players in every few seasons just to sell more shirts. I don't agree with the current board but at no time have they signed players just to sell shirts, we need Arda Turan and he is a perfect fit, just like Rakitic and Suarez were last summer."
Barca,3cfeyc,Tezemery,0,Tue Jul 7 20:18:42 2015 UTC,"It's not as much now as it was in the 2000s (Beckham, Zidane, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, etc).  They sold Robben because he was underperforming on RM, same for Sneijder, Huntelaar, Robinho, Ozil and Higuain. They didn't want to sell Di Maria but he wanted way more money and forced his exit. I have no idea what happened to Makelele."
Barca,3cfeyc,zevah,2,Tue Jul 7 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"At the time, Di Maria was one of their lowest paid players despite having a great season. Both him and Ozil are still in the top 5 of most overall assists in La Liga. Their pursuit of Bale and Neymar was really odd/more for marketing reasons since both of those guys were playing on the left wing. There was no way that either of those guys was going to displace Cristiano (or force him to be the center forward). Thats way Bale got shifted awkwardly to the right wing."
Barca,3cfeyc,drunkenmaster22,14,Wed Jul 8 03:20:26 2015 UTC,"""Pogba is an objective""  So you wanted him, why didn't you get him rat face?"
Barca,3cfeyc,Aj16ay,5,Tue Jul 7 15:04:06 2015 UTC,"If its true that Luis Enrique wanted him, then it is fine as he deserves his player for the treble."
Barca,3cfeyc,ew123,2,Tue Jul 7 16:04:47 2015 UTC,Yea I hope the board dosent decide to sell him back. It would be very disrespectful to Arda.
Barca,3cfeyc,shmenditt,6,Tue Jul 7 18:40:57 2015 UTC,"Even though I love the Arda signing, I absolutely hate how this has all come about. Bartomeu is clearly bringing in players now because the signings will be tied to his re-election campaign, while the other candidates have to oppose the signings just to stand apart from Bartomeu. I really hope Bartomeu wins the elections to avoid the embarrassment that would come about if Laporta wins and immediately exercises his right to sell back Arda in order to spite Bartomeu and to show that this is ""his team."""
Barca,3cfeyc,Barcalaw30,4,Tue Jul 7 14:50:13 2015 UTC,"Although it would be embarrassing at first, I'd rather be embarrassed for a couple of months than having to be fed up for another six years."
Barca,3cfeyc,Assonfire,4,Tue Jul 7 17:00:32 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about having Bartomeu back as president instead of Laporta? I think people forget how Laporta left the club on his way out last time. I know that the whole Neymar incident has been terrible, but Bartomeu and Rosell did a pretty fantastic job getting Barcelona out the financial mess that Laporta had left behind. I know Laporta is a charismatic guy and he has the support of some of our legends, but he was an absolute disgrace through the end of his presidency."
Barca,3cfeyc,Barcalaw30,3,Tue Jul 7 17:43:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's just.. he didn't. He didn't leave the club in a financial mess. Don't know if you read the news, but the previous board was cleared of the charges. Sala i Martin made an excellent report just after the new board got into business. Rosell and Bartomeu have always, ALWAYS lacked the transparancy they claimed for throughout the last three years of Laporta. Even Jordi Majo said that and he dislikes Laporta completely.  Laporta has his flaws, but thanks to his boards, we became the club we are right now. The amount of shit has just piled up under Rosell and Barto. They haven't done anything special about the financial part of the club either. Anyone can pick a sponsor for that amount of money. Even worse is the fact that we broke off a tradition for a so-called record amount of money, to be beaten by another club one year later."
Barca,3cfeyc,Assonfire,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:36:04 2015 UTC,"You have to take Sala i Martin's report with a huge grain of salt, as he was part of Laporta's board, and was basically in charge of finances while he was there. That being said, Laporta certainly was the president that made Barcelona what it is now, but he did so with more than a bit of controversy. All I am saying is that Laporta shouldn't be viewed as an absolute savior of the club. To be honest, none of the candidates are particularly appealing to me and I wish there was someone else that could step in. More importantly, I wish that all of this election nonsense would just go away as it detracts from the most important thing in all of this: football. Every candidate is using the team and the promise of transfers as a political tool to get into power, which I fear in the end will end up overshadowing the actual performance on the field."
Barca,3cfeyc,Barcalaw30,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:14:49 2015 UTC,"I won't take his report with a huge grain of salt. Especially regarding his stature in the economic world and the fact that they won in court.  Laporta has his flaws, like I said. But he and his boards did turn our club from the mess in which is was, to the success it is now.   For me, I would love for Benedito to win. But I am grateful of Laporta's work."
Barca,3cfeyc,Assonfire,2,Wed Jul 8 09:39:24 2015 UTC,"It's sad because you know that's exactly what will happen. Laporta will say, ""nope, see you later"" and then try for Pogba. And then we'll spend more than 80m on a player we can't use for 6 months just so Laporta can make a statement."
Barca,3cfeyc,nannulators,11,Tue Jul 7 15:20:21 2015 UTC,"I think locking up Pogba for 2016 is actually a great move. I know he is ridiculously expensive, but that is the going rate for one of the top players in the world who is 22 years old. If Laporta comes in and signs him for next year, then that can be his stamp on the team, much like Ronaldinho was during Laporta's first term. However, him coming in and immediately selling Arda back at a loss would be an absolute debacle."
Barca,3cfeyc,Barcalaw30,3,Tue Jul 7 15:35:02 2015 UTC,I agree that signing him for next year would be fantastic. But selling Arda and signing Pogba to play January-June of this year would be too much of him trying to put his stamp on the club.
Barca,3cfeyc,nannulators,2,Tue Jul 7 15:42:58 2015 UTC,"Everything I had been reading indicates that Pogba would not actually come until next year, so I think that would be pretty great. It would give the team enough time to continue growing, and would give Iniesta another year to decline a bit. That was, when Pogba arrives next June, he would have a starting spot ready for him."
Barca,3cfeyc,Barcalaw30,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:39:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes the most sense. I just think it's going to be very difficult to negotiate that deal because no club wants their players to have one foot out the door. If Barca wants him for next year, all it takes is City or PSG to say they want him now and offer a bit more money and we're screwed."
Barca,3cfeyc,nannulators,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:53:24 2015 UTC,"The deal that was reported by Sport about a week ago was a pre-agreement with Barcelona for €80 and an agreement to not sell him this summer window. I think at this point, Juventus is resigned to the fact that he will eventually leave because the offers are so high and Pogba has already hinted that he will want to leave. If that is the case, then why wouldn't Juventus want to keep him for an additional year and make another run at the CL? It gives them a chance to build the team without Pogba over two summer windows as opposed to just this one when it doesn't seem like there are any massive players available to come close to replace Pogba."
Barca,3cfeyc,Barcalaw30,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:07:07 2015 UTC,"Didn't Juve completely deny that though?  It all makes sense, but nothing has been confirmed.. and he's going to be a vital part of their team now that Pirlo is gone. It's kind of like the arguments that people were making before about buying a player that expensive and not playing him. You can't have a player that important and that talented sitting on your bench just because you know he's leaving. He's going to be vital to their success this season, but the team can't grow without him if he has to play. Catch 22. I'm glad (if the rumors are true) that it's Juve's problem to deal with and not ours."
Barca,3cfeyc,nannulators,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:15:28 2015 UTC,"I think the rumor was in fact denied, but then again, which rumor isn't? Given the instability at the top at Barca, it doesn't make any sense for Juventus to come out and say that they have agreed to sell him next year. They are much better served denying everything and seeing what other big offers may be out there from other clubs.  Regarding Juventus, I was talking more about the opportunity to buy players over two seasons rather than the opportunity for the team to learn to play together. Any time a massive player leaves, the team takes some time to gel together and learn how to play without him. That being said, having two full summer windows to purchase replacement players is an undeniable advantage. This is especially true when the sale this summer wouldn't happen until the end of the transfer window. At that point, most of the big players have already moved, and the ones that are left would be sold at hugely inflated fees because the other team has all of the leverage in the negotiations. This leads to panic buys of inadequate players at huge fees. Look at what happened with Liverpool and Spurs when they sold Suarez and Bale respectively. They had so much money to spend and so little time that they ended up spending almost all of it unwisely."

From my experience (and my counsin's) all I can tell you is that if you don't get a nice spot, you won't enjoy the experience (unless it's a huge match like ""el Clasico"" or a Champions League one, then the ambience might help a bit).

He's a fighter like Suarez, and these are always good to have on a team, good for morale. As long as he stops throwing shoes at linesmen.  But where will he play? CM? And can he push out Iniesta or Rakitic? I doubt it, but surely he didn't come here to be a bench-player? So many questions.."

Barca,3cc0mc,R0b1nh0,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:09:33 2015 UTC,"I'm actually only thinking of Bayern, who's had playing coming in and out of injury throughout the season, and somehow slotting into the starting XI after just a couple of games. Badstuber was out for like 2 years and played pretty well when he came back, only to get injured again. Thiago also didn't take long to settle into the team after coming back from injury.   I'm sure Arda will be rusty, like Suarez was, but it might not take too long to settle into the team."
Barca,3cc0mc,zashuna,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:37:40 2015 UTC,"Well Enrique loves to rotate, so there's that. There were periods during the season when Iniesta wasn't playing very well. Turan will keep the other players on their toes. 29 isn't too old for a CM. We can get at least 4 good seasons out of him. I'm just not sure how he'd do playing there. I think he plays further up for Atletico and there's no way in hell he's going to displace MSN."
Barca,3cc0mc,zashuna,0,Tue Jul 7 16:50:09 2015 UTC,"I don't understand it either. Arda will probably be Iniesta's substitute, since he isn't better than the latter."

Barca,3cc0mc,aleks19998,5,Mon Jul 6 23:20:13 2015 UTC,"Yea it could have been way worse, but still, he will be 29 when he can play for us, and that worries me. Could be declining from the moment he gets to play for us, with that age. But he might also not, and might be the same as Iniesta who is 31 and was MOTM in the CL final.  So yea."
Barca,3cc0mc,kezorN,3,Mon Jul 6 19:24:04 2015 UTC,"I was about to write a REALLY long note on how arda is a bad buy, but if this is our only midfield buy till 2016 and illaramendi cost 46 mill, then maybe this might turn out to be good.   Just wished we had gotten koke, my life would have been complete. He's perfect."
Barca,3cc0mc,Mr_Constantine,3,Mon Jul 6 19:30:12 2015 UTC,We would have been looking at a fee of 46+ for Koke. Illa
Barca,3cc0mc,zizzor23,4,Mon Jul 6 19:55:22 2015 UTC,"SPORT said 34m+7 (which adds to 41m, his buyout(?))"
Barca,3cc0mc,flackohowyoubeen,4,Mon Jul 6 21:47:00 2015 UTC,So we're saying he's worth as much as Cesc...we suck at negotiating.
Barca,3cc0mc,broncosrb26,7,Mon Jul 6 23:20:19 2015 UTC,Honestly I can see Arda playing better for us than Cesc did.
Barca,3cc0mc,drewsufff,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:10:40 2015 UTC,I do as well but Cesc is an overall better talent.
Barca,3cc0mc,broncosrb26,5,Mon Jul 6 22:46:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, and he's younger  Edit: Lmao wait, they're like the same age. For some reason I keep thinking that Cesc is 26. Then I get sad when I remember him and Messi and Pique are all 28 :("
Barca,3cc0mc,drewsufff,3,Tue Jul 7 00:57:05 2015 UTC,Cesc was 27 when he transferred and pl transfer fees are overall higher. Chelsea got him for a steal when ozil and Maria went for 50m+. We suck balls at negotiating. Plain and simple. I don't know how our finances are but hopefully it doesn't come back to bite us in the ass.
Barca,3cc0mc,NahSoR,56,Tue Jul 7 01:08:43 2015 UTC,"Meh, like I said before, I like Arda Turan.. I like him as a player, thats not the issue.  The issue again is the junta gestora overstepping their bounds, acting like Bartomeus puppet, the fact that all pre-candidates except Bartomeu were against signing any player before the 18th says a lot.."
Barca,3cc0mc,IhateAngryBirds,25,Tue Jul 7 01:10:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. The player is great, but the deal is messed up. And it might just have won Barto the election."
Barca,3cc0mc,egcg119,26,Tue Jul 7 07:00:06 2015 UTC,"Nah, the treble won him the election."
Barca,3cc0mc,_sic,7,Mon Jul 6 19:10:09 2015 UTC,won him the election.   There was a survey a week ago and Bartomeu had less than 9% lead. How can you be so sure he's going to win or did I miss something?
Barca,3cc0mc,decho,9,Mon Jul 6 19:15:19 2015 UTC,"""Fair play."""
Barca,3cc0mc,lonestar_10,4,Mon Jul 6 19:17:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. As anti-madridista, Turan was one of my favorite players and I'm hyped he's now at Barça. HOWEVER, the fishy ways of this Junta Gestora, are awful. Awful move by Bartosell's puppets."
Barca,3cc0mc,mfalconer,8,Mon Jul 6 21:20:17 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but if this is a player Enrique wanted and not one the board was after, why does it matter?"
Barca,3cc0mc,nannulators,17,Mon Jul 6 19:18:18 2015 UTC,"2 weeks ago the player Lucho wanted was Pogba (even sending Braida to a meeting in Italy ) now they're feeding us that Arda Turan is the first choice.. bullshit sorry. You should not believe anything that comes out of Bartomeus mouth. Not now, not ever."
Barca,3cc0mc,IhateAngryBirds,12,Mon Jul 6 22:30:38 2015 UTC,Yeah... Arda became the player Lucho wanted right after they fucked up the negociations for Pogba. How convinient.
Barca,3cc0mc,polechi33,8,Mon Jul 6 19:20:35 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily see it as Arda being first choice, just that it was more possible than the Pogba signing right now. I wouldn't be surprised one bit if something was still announced regarding Pogba over the next few months about him coming next summer.   But IMO Arda also fits with Lucho's mentality better than Pogba, so it really wouldn't surprise me if he was the first choice. But we'll never know unless Lucho says something, will we?"
Barca,3cc0mc,nannulators,4,Mon Jul 6 19:22:21 2015 UTC,"Whats Lucho gonna say ""I don't like the player"" ?, of course he'll say something positive now...   You don't understand, this is a dirty move by Bartomeu to gain votes for the election...  The worst thing that could happen in Barca would be Bartomeu getting elected"
Barca,3cc0mc,IhateAngryBirds,7,Mon Jul 6 19:39:00 2015 UTC,"No, I understand just fine. I just think it's pretty pointless and petty to just assume everything is lies all the time. The two leading candidates both have their downsides, but unfortunately we can't have a fresh face.   I, for one, don't really give a shit about the politics surrounding the signing. All politicians are liars and cheats.. so it's not surprising that one would resort to sheisty tactics. They can spin it however they want, but Arda's a good player and the signing makes sense based on the type of coach Lucho is. And if it really is Bartomeu just pulling a power move, the club can sell him back before 7-20.  Fact of the matter is we're already going to be halfway through the transfer window when the elections are held. Then preseason starts 3 days later. Then what? The board starts signing players they want in order to make themselves look good. Then we have another Ibra situation on our hands."

Barca,3cc0mc,mattb10,31,Mon Jul 6 19:33:40 2015 UTC,"on one hand I feel like this is a great transfer for obvious reasons but on the other hand I definitely would have preferred we got someone younger (Verratti, Koke).  He's 28? And will hinder the development of Masia produced midfielders like Rafinha.  -- Changed my mind, younger players would definitely hinder Masia midfielders development more.  Not sure what to think of this but I said something similar with Suarez last year and look how it turned out to be.  Lucho will handle this the right way."
Barca,3cc0mc,_cyvix_,11,Mon Jul 6 20:52:49 2015 UTC,"Suárez was a clear upgrade to our starting 11. Arda isn't, though."
Barca,3cc0mc,egcg119,19,Mon Jul 6 20:55:59 2015 UTC,Not everything is defined by the starting XI. Arda gives us enormous flexibility and fills a clear hole in the squad.
Barca,3cc0mc,fmn13,0,Mon Jul 6 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I see how he fills a hole. He's an Iniesta-type player (creative midfielder) and so if he's a replacement to him, it's a band-aid solution. If we were gonna buy a playmaker, Arda isn't the right man for the job."
Barca,3cc0mc,egcg119,18,Mon Jul 6 19:08:25 2015 UTC,"The hole where it's the Champions League semi-final and one of Iniesta/Rakitic is injured. Previously, we could get by, either trusting Rafinha or playing defensively with a Masch-Busi double pivot, but neither of those are ideal. Now we have the experience and attacking quality necessary.  Rakitić wasn't the right man to replace Xavi either, everyone said we needed Kroos. But the type Barcelona needs has changed. Arda is tough as nails while still having tons of technical quality, and that will give us certain freedoms that playing Iniesta doesn't. Lucho was always very careful with Xavi and Iniesta last season, and clearly concerned about them not being tough enough in midfield, which is why they rarely played together. Arda causes no such worries.  Moreover, his dribbling and his time as a LM means he can sub in for Neymar far better than Pedro can. Dribbling is so important in Lucho's system, and Arda is one of the best in the world. Plus, that means we have the option of playing 4 MFs without losing defensive steel in midfield.  It's not about fitting an exact profile or an exact place in the starting XI. It's about how many options he gives us and liberates us from what would have been a very thin squad come March."
Barca,3cc0mc,NahSoR,2,Mon Jul 6 19:36:53 2015 UTC,"A player of arda's quality will always add value to a squad, even the treble winning club. But imo I don't want to see a world class warrior like arda be anything less than a sure starter and thus wanted to stay in atleti. It's much like Keylor Navas and Filipe Luis. It absolutely sucks go see money put such players perpetually on the bench."
Barca,3cc0mc,egcg119,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"Arda could have gotten a lot more money at Chelsea. He came to Barcelona to win trophies. Many players in all sports accept reduced individual roles for team success.  And Lucho rotates constantly. Arda will be used every week, impossible to compare to Navas or Filipe."
Barca,3cc0mc,shmenditt,8,Mon Jul 6 21:46:51 2015 UTC,But you say that you would have preferred someone younger but; wouldnt those younger players hinder even more the development of masia midfielders? I dont know how to feel about this singing either. Hopefully he will do great.
Barca,3cc0mc,mattb10,5,Tue Jul 7 00:12:09 2015 UTC,"you bring up a very good point.  I would much rather have a younger player that would become even more of a superstar rather than a superstar for this amount of money who is 28 already.  If Iniesta or Rakitic gets injured (god forbid), an already great player like Koke or Verratti would be better to start than someone like Turan who won't really be improving too much if at all.  changed my mind"
Barca,3cc0mc,Chupalla90,8,Tue Jul 7 07:05:23 2015 UTC,but for a short term thinking Arda is the perfect fit for us to repalce some1. hes has the expierence and is a world class player. in addition hes very dedicated and hungry for trophies. never gives up (especialy vs Real)
Barca,3cc0mc,mattb10,3,Tue Jul 7 18:14:48 2015 UTC,completely agree with you there.  We'll just have to see what Lucho does just like last year with Suarez.  And until January Rafinha will get a lot of playing time so that makes me pretty happy.
Barca,3cc0mc,Cambijao,7,Mon Jul 6 19:18:13 2015 UTC,You heavily underrestimate Arda Turan....
Barca,3cc0mc,Cambijao,7,Mon Jul 6 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"He's 28? And will hinder the development of Masia produced midfielders like Rafinha.   With all respect mate but that's a ridicioulus argument. If Barca signed Veratti or Koke, they would hinder Rafinha's development considering that they're around at the same age.."
Barca,3cc0mc,LedZepGuy,3,Mon Jul 6 19:29:18 2015 UTC,"I think what's he's saying is that he would have rather us went with someone younger IF we were going to hinder a La Masia product's development. What he's really saying is he was hoping for a longterm solution to the midfield instead of just a place holder for the next season or two. I think...  Edit: Rereading my comment got me thinking...I wonder if this really is a placeholder until Pogba can be signed next summer? If so, that would mean they don't have any faith in a La Masia product becoming the longterm solution because then they would probably rather go with giving that player the time on the field instead of Turan eating up those minutes."
Barca,3cc0mc,Cambijao,0,Mon Jul 6 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"I don't believe the age-argument. For an example, Pirlo is still a very good mitfielder and he's 36. Lampard made world class performances even though he was 34. And Zidane played his best football when he was 30+. And I haven't even mentioned Villa & Henry who both were 29 when they came to Barca and I don't think no one on this sub would regard them as flops..."
Barca,3cc0mc,MyKillK,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:31:43 2015 UTC,"28   Seems like a perfect age to get someone with a lot of experience that'll still be in the prime of their career for a couple years, and then move on to another player. A short-term replacement. I don't think they're looking for a long-time Barca player in this deal so I like it."
Barca,3cc0mc,rbarcelona,32,Mon Jul 6 19:29:51 2015 UTC,I'm a huge fan of Arda. He's a fucking warrior. I think this signing is better than someone younger like Pogba or Veratti because it allows for the La Masia youngsters to continue developing in the longrun.
Barca,3cc0mc,IhateAngryBirds,10,Mon Jul 6 19:39:01 2015 UTC,Pogba will probably still join Barca next year if Laporta is president
Barca,3cc0mc,iVarun,7,Mon Jul 6 19:32:02 2015 UTC,"I like this, even though its utterly crazy.   Plus now we have competition for all the Turkish and Ozil fans on Youtube.    He is the right age. Not too old not too young."

Barca,3cc0mc,_sic,12,Mon Jul 6 19:11:17 2015 UTC,I can't wait to see him play for Barça. I'm almost as excited as I was for Suarez.
Barca,3cc0mc,egcg119,19,Mon Jul 6 19:24:53 2015 UTC,"This is the chosen thread. Also, this transfer is crazy.  Edit: First thing that came to mind was this moment back in January 2014. In Arda's MOTM performance, at 3:05 he fights through Xavi, Pedro, and Busi with a mix of strength and skill and just completely bypasses our midfield. That stuck with me, a low point for our team but a high point for my respect for Arda."
Barca,3cc0mc,NoFapMonster,10,Mon Jul 6 19:18:51 2015 UTC,"It definitely is. Turan is an amazing player but I don't know what his role will be exactly? What happens to the minutes Rafinha was looking forward to get this season? Is Denis not coming back? Also S. Roberto is for sure leaving because he definitely has no place in this Barca squad.  On a related note, Turan is okay with not playing for a half season?"
Barca,3cc0mc,aleks19998,5,Mon Jul 6 20:53:14 2015 UTC,"I think a week or so ago there was news regarding Denis, he'll complete his two year loan then Sevilla have an option to buy (and Barca have an option to buy after that)"
Barca,3cc0mc,captncarry,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:18:43 2015 UTC,"Would you mind telling me it's crazy? Crazy good, crazy bad or just crazy?  From my point of view, I can't decide whether it's good or bad. Arda is a good midfielder, warrior-style, good dribbler and got decent vision. But it hinders development of future talent and he is a bit of a hot head for my liking."

Barca,3cc0mc,xFragg,14,Mon Jul 6 19:22:02 2015 UTC,"Fuck, does this mean no Pogba? I know everyone hates thinking Pogba could be transferred but he's one of the best young talents in the world, he's already playing in Europe too. Everyone was critical of Neymar, but Ney never played in Europe and he's doing wonders for us. Turan is good yes, but Pogba is younger and has potential to be better. I'll admit Verratti is who I want but I lost hope in PSG."
Barca,3cc0mc,_sic,12,Mon Jul 6 20:13:09 2015 UTC,I think both Laporta and Nobito have Pogba close to signing for next season. The only problem is if City or RM convince the player to sign with them this summer.
Barca,3cc0mc,xFragg,2,Mon Jul 6 20:29:16 2015 UTC,"I think his agent said he doesn't want to go to Real Madrid, that's why there were no rumors. City however... I hope we don't lose someone like Pogba to City."

But then again, money talks and bullshit walks.."
Barca,3cc0mc,VOROBI,2,Mon Jul 6 19:20:37 2015 UTC,I don't think he's very close with United. Not like he loves the club or anyrhing

Barca,3cc0mc,YoSoyMilkChocolate,6,Mon Jul 6 19:43:14 2015 UTC,You can't deny that Verratti fits us much better than Pogba though.
Barca,3cc0mc,xFragg,5,Mon Jul 6 21:23:51 2015 UTC,"He's a good player. An unrealistic transfer yes, but a good player."
Barca,3cc0mc,SuperZero42,2,Mon Jul 6 19:39:52 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel better, I don't want Veratti either. I'd rather see us rotate our B team's midfielders in."
Barca,3cc0mc,HippoNigga,3,Mon Jul 6 20:07:38 2015 UTC,"I think Pogba is still coming, especially if Laporta gets elected. Pogba would be a signing for next summer though, not this one."

Barca,3cc0mc,xscientist,3,Mon Jul 6 19:33:57 2015 UTC,"Turan is a phenomenal talent. Assuming it won't break our bank (it won't), won't hinder youth (it won't), we would be insane not to celebrate this signing. His skill set is actually quite close to Iniesta's, but he's a tad more aggressive, and a tad less intelligent on the ball. It's a great fit, he will sink right in, especially after training for half a season (is that what he'll do?)."
Barca,3cc0mc,j33sizzle,5,Mon Jul 6 19:40:36 2015 UTC,Arda is going to bring a healthy competitiveness to the squad. His aggression (along with Suarez) is going to give other squads something else to think about.
Barca,3cc0mc,Rempelrez,9,Mon Jul 6 19:37:44 2015 UTC,"I am excited to see what he brings. He had a good season for Atletico, outstanding dribbler if I remember. I think he brings the same passion Suárez brought. If he was a fan when he was young, surely he's passionate and excited to play for Barça.  That being said, Arda is already quite old and he won't be playing for us for the first half of the season. We might've not spent a fortune for him but it's still a lot. Hopefully he brings another dynamic to the team."
Barca,3cc0mc,ViscaBarca1899,5,Mon Jul 6 19:58:13 2015 UTC,I'm really happy with this transfer. Arda is a fantastic player with great technique and a brilliant work ethic. #FearTheBeard
Barca,3cc0mc,luisuarez7,4,Mon Jul 6 19:34:42 2015 UTC,Turan's manager said that Luis Enrique wanted Arda very much. Can you guys please stop conpiracy theories.
Barca,3cc0mc,Duke--Nukem,7,Mon Jul 6 19:42:06 2015 UTC,I like Turan. But this board is fucking things up. THE CLUB SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO BUSINESS BEFORE ELECTIONS!!  What the fuck? Decisions are made for the sake of winning elections first and not in favor of the club.   What's the role of Lucho? I am sure Bartomeu is lying when he says that Lucho asked for this and that.
Barca,3cc0mc,jichba666,3,Mon Jul 6 19:49:21 2015 UTC,"this transfer is what Barca need in the middle :D with busquets,rakitić and Turan there is no need for Messi to come in middle for ball and he will be able to concentrate on forward play"
Barca,3cc0mc,jklz,3,Mon Jul 6 21:33:34 2015 UTC,"Luis Enrique has his midfield signing, while Atlético already have their replacement ready. Both sides should be happy with that.  I would of course have preferred it if the deal happened with an elected board, but that's just how things go at the club I guess.."
Barca,3cc0mc,giraz,3,Mon Jul 6 19:11:28 2015 UTC,"He is versatile being able to fill few roles, doesn't cost us a fortune, and he brings in some much needed experience and depth with Xavi and possibly Pedro leaving. A very smart signing, look at what the aggression of Suarez brought to this club."
Barca,3cc0mc,Jrumm,3,Mon Jul 6 23:44:33 2015 UTC,"First, I understand why a number of people are complaining about the board overstepping their authority. I understand that they are an interim board. At the same time, this board voluntarily stepped down to allow these elections to happen in the first place. We should all be happy they were open to elections. Plus, they sent doing anything crazy.   Second, from reports, it seems as though Enrique wanted Turan. If those reports are true, we all should support the transfer since Enrique clearly knows what he is doing. It's a relatively low fee transfer, Turan is crazy talented and he and the board want him with the club.   Where do I think he will he play? Honestly, All over the place. It seems clear now that Enrique wants everyone to press all over the field. Trying to make players press on every position is tiresome. Does everyone forget that we are fighting for SIX trophies this year? We absolutely need depth and rotations to manage those competitions. Did anybody else watch Real start falling apart last year because of injuries and fatigue?"
Barca,3cc0mc,Dark-X,9,Tue Jul 7 02:57:41 2015 UTC,"He is not signed to be a starter.  He's a back up.  Reinforcement.  Pogba is way over priced.  Verratti is tied with PSG, who won't sell him, until 2019.  This signing will still give the likes of Rafinha & Denis a chance to grow.  Arda is also a leader, just like Masche & Bravo.  Don't judge him with ATM. See his work at Galatasaray. Arda is a legend there & he isn't even 30, & not because of his on-field work only, his work outside the field with everything that's Galata-related, form the younger teams to charity.  This is a great addition & time will prove it."
Barca,3cc0mc,IhateAngryBirds,4,Mon Jul 6 23:39:08 2015 UTC,"Arda is 40ish million, he'll be 29 years old when he debuts. Pogba is 80m ish, he would be 23 year old when he debuts.. big difference"
Barca,3cc0mc,Dark-X,2,Mon Jul 6 19:28:18 2015 UTC,"Even though I'm not talking about the money here but the value of the player as a part of a team, is it really 40 million?"

Barca,3cc0mc,Dark-X,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:03:40 2015 UTC,there is a chance that Pogba would be unable to fit La liga tho. I agree that Arda is a weird transfer but i also think Pogba is overrated and expensive as fuck.

Barca,3cc0mc,Aj16ay,10,Tue Jul 7 11:16:12 2015 UTC,I am fucking hyped. Turan is a beast. He's older than Pogba and Veratti but better than both.
Barca,3cc0mc,_cyvix_,7,Tue Jul 7 19:50:30 2015 UTC,Meh. Not a step up on Iniesta
Barca,3cc0mc,DivineVibrations,-5,Tue Jul 7 23:34:04 2015 UTC,"What? Do you really believe that? I mean, come on, he's not better than Pogba, by any means."
Barca,3cc0mc,_cyvix_,9,Mon Jul 6 21:12:18 2015 UTC,"Definitely. The hype behind Pogba is that he's a beast and is only 22. Arda may be in his prime, but as of now he's definitely better, I promise. The man is world class"
Barca,3cc0mc,rocksteadybebop,2,Mon Jul 6 20:03:09 2015 UTC,"It's not about the hype. It's about the performance, and yes, as a guy who watches Juventus pretty often, I can tell you that he is a beast and he would be in our best starting 11. Arda will not."
Barca,3cc0mc,FrostyGrass,2,Mon Jul 6 19:09:09 2015 UTC,Who would he replace in our best starting 11? Can't think of anyone at this exact moment.
Barca,3cc0mc,SuperZero42,2,Mon Jul 6 20:25:09 2015 UTC,"That's the thing Arda is €32m spent for a player that won't displace anyone in our starting lineup until Iniesta shows aging and we won't have him until Jan 2016. So the purchase doesn't really make sense, should have just waited and bought Pogba in the 2016 summer window as he is just a better player."
Barca,3cc0mc,_cyvix_,5,Mon Jul 6 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"Before the Pogba brigade comes in here to yell obscenities, the two are very different players. Arda is obviously more experienced, and plays a very physical game both on offense and defense. Pogba is still developing, and while no one questions his talent, he isn't worth the £90 million price tag when we can get someone who knows la liga and RM for less than half that. In the future, sure, he could be our top pick. For now, Pogba isn't leaving Turin... Unless Perez breaks the transfer record again."
Barca,3cc0mc,flackohowyoubeen,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:25:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't say he's worth the price tag, I am just saying that he is better than Arda and that he would upgrade our best starting 11, unlike Arda.

Barca,3cc0mc,Entrepreneutralizer,3,Mon Jul 6 19:47:00 2015 UTC,AMAZING signing. We need a combative midfileder
Barca,3cc0mc,theAnecdote,3,Mon Jul 6 22:08:50 2015 UTC,~35m is much better for arda than 80+ million for pogba. Arda mentality is that of a winner. he will be our  own personal leonidas.
Barca,3cc0mc,Tezemery,2,Mon Jul 6 22:44:46 2015 UTC,"Good player, but a bit of a cunt when playing for Atletico. Hopefully he can fix his manners for us."
Barca,3cc0mc,TheNxtDaveGrohl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:54:11 2015 UTC,"This is a great signing, the perfect player for Luis Enrique's Barca, he is a warrior just like Luis Suarez and we definitely needed another midfielder now that Xavi has gone, perfect player for a good price and will come in refreshed half way through the season similar to Suarez.  I know a lot of people rightfully complain about this board but I would say 90% of the signings have been brilliant and arguably better than the ones under Laporta.  Laporta has the soul and ethics of Barca at heart and Bartomeu/Rosell have the finances and business in mind and to be fair they have improved us from a business perspective."

Barca,3cc0mc,mrnoor,3,Mon Jul 6 21:54:47 2015 UTC,"Apparently the managing committee could also sign players, but only by consensus and one of them was hesitant.  That's why it took so long to announce what was essentially a done deal for a week."
Barca,3cc0mc,DiegoAlonso,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:09:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good signing. We're all aware of his capabilities, if he can keep up his game or even step it up a bit it's going to be worth it. Regarding playing time, I think with Iniesta being a year older and Arda not playing until January, there will be plenty of time for him to rotate with Iniesta, Rakitic and Rafinha. Though I think Sergi Roberto has to leave now, even if we consider Xavis departure I'd rather make way for the younger players get some minutes.  Munir and Sandro got plenty time until Suarez started to play,  I suspect Rafinha will see a lot of minutes up until January and then it's all about who's got the best form out of the 4 CMs."
Barca,3cc0mc,potatosss,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm a bit on the fence about him. Then again, I thought the same about Luisito"

Barca,3cc0mc,henryswaffleiron,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:45:43 2015 UTC,34 millions for a player who will only play when he turns 29 is a lot of money. He has 3-4 seasons at top level left. Maybe 5 if we are lucky. Seems a bit overpriced.
Barca,3cc0mc,RayMedia,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:42:06 2015 UTC,I remember signing him on Football Manager 2007 for nothing and he scored a screamer from near the halfway line on his debut. Probably the best signing I've ever made on any football game. Glad he's with us after following his career for so long.
Barca,3cc0mc,donpedrox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:18:21 2015 UTC,"Unimportant question: What will Turan's kit number be? Possibly 6? Or will Rafinha take 6, and Turan take 12?"

Barca,3cc0mc,Epsilon76,0,Mon Jul 6 23:23:15 2015 UTC,Pretty dumb transfer to me. There goes the development of Rafinha too.  Can anyone tell me who is signing players too? Bartomeu or the junta gestora?
Barca,3cc0mc,tadm123,5,Mon Jul 6 22:34:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree, look at Arda as a replacement for Xavi's departure. Rafinha will still be able to get some great minutes this season.   It's important to remember that Enrique managed him at Celta, he knows Rafinha better than anyone. Have faith in the man that just delivered a treble - there was a time when people on /r/barca were mad because he rotated too much."
Barca,3cc0mc,FCB_TB,8,Mon Jul 6 22:55:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Arda Turan is nothing like Xavi, that's why it's bizarre, he isn't a metronome that dictates the play of the team. He's an AM who can play on the wings. If he can replace anyone it would be Iniesta.   Maybe he's thinking of Turan as the starting AM for next season, or probably as a supersub for Iniesta, but at the same time you don't buy someone like Turan to be a sub. I don't know man the transfer is a bit strange, and I will continue to support L.Enrique though like I'd been doing for a long time."
Barca,3cc0mc,HippoNigga,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:24:23 2015 UTC,41 fucking million euro????  Did I read that right? For a 29 (when he can play for us) old?
Barca,3cc0mc,FCB_TB,2,Tue Jul 7 05:17:31 2015 UTC,Don't expect a quality player to be cheap. Clubs know we needed a midfielder so they expect us to pay a hefty price.
Barca,3cc0mc,HippoNigga,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:37:42 2015 UTC,"I didn't expect cheap, but 41 million is more than double Rakitic?   We sold them Villa for pretty much nothing. And then we pay 41 million for a very good, but reasonably old player."
Barca,3cc0mc,aleks19998,2,Tue Jul 7 18:12:47 2015 UTC,"Rakitić was on the last year of his deal I think, so that's why he was really cheap. Arda's contract runs until 2017, so that's why he was more expensive. If Rakitić had two more years on his contract he would probably had been the same price."
Barca,3cc0mc,FCB_TB,2,Mon Jul 6 19:13:50 2015 UTC,He can play for us at 28

Barca,3cc0mc,darthvader7888,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:37:00 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Turan definitely won't be a starter. If we're going to use him as a sub, I'd rather have Rafinha/Denis/Sergi gaining the experience and opportunity to prove themselves. With the departure of Xavi, Rafinha's expectations play-time wise may have risen. I really would hate to see Rafinha leave the club.   Nevertheless, if it is true that Lucho requested for Turan, I'm curious to see what his plan is.   Edit: Dat beard tho!"
Barca,3cc0mc,Cambijao,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:38:24 2015 UTC,34m for a 29 year old benchwarmer who can't play until January?  Well if Lucho wanted him I'll give him the benefit of a doubt.
Barca,3cc0mc,fcueva-,6,Mon Jul 6 19:26:31 2015 UTC,34m for a 29 year old benchwarmer?   €34M is nothing considering that Arda's one of the best midfielders in the world and the best player from Atleti. And I think the Turk will be a starter instead of Iniesta who doesn't fit into Lucho's system.
Barca,3cc0mc,HippoNigga,-2,Mon Jul 6 19:32:05 2015 UTC,"Best player from Atleti? Surely you have got to be kidding LOL. I could easily name better players who would fit our style of play. ie. Koke, Oliver Torres."

Barca,3cc0mc,maajkemii,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:41:54 2015 UTC,"LOL, you guys are all looking for someone to replace Xavi. And I suppose Iniesta at some point. For now, we have a good 2-3 years left with Iniesta at top level, 4 if were lucky. If were looking for a Xavi replacement right now, why the hell would we get someone like Arda Turan, when we could be bidding for Kovacic, Verratti, Koke, Oliver Torres..."

Barca,3cc0mc,K10S,2,Mon Jul 6 20:05:56 2015 UTC,"you do realize that Rakitic can be played as a replacement for Iniesta right? He was more of an attacking midfielder in his previous years and has only come to be more defensive due to him covering Dani Alves a lot. He has a huge responsibility, and hes performing really well at what he does."
Barca,3cc0mc,TR1L0GYxx,0,Mon Jul 6 21:36:49 2015 UTC,"Man 30 MILLION! Honestly I wouldn't even want him for free. Hes really talented but also a fucking hot head. He was shown more yellow cards than Pique (Not even kidding) last season, while being a creative midfielder for fucks sake!"

Barca,3ccp2s,Marchisio,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:24:08 2015 UTC,They play very different roles. Sandro is the only other center forward besides Suarez and Messi. And to be honest I think Messi will start playing midfield sooner than later. He knows that is his toe to international trophies.

I think we have a good amount of guys who have great work rates on both sides of the ball.   Though I see it working a bit better to run it more like a 3-4-1-2 to keep a bit stronger of a midfield presence, with Messi dropping a bit deeper in an attacking mid/deeper center forward role linking the attack with the midfield, going forward as he pleases.

How am I going to call a man, who is often compared to ""the greatest of all history"" a pecho frio? How am I going to call Messi a pecho frio? ""Pecho frio"", pecho frio is you(those) calling Messi a pecho frio.""   Holy shit Burrito. Absolutely nailed it. I couldn't have said it better myself."
Barca,3ccxmc,Football_Enthusiast,15,Mon Jul 6 23:08:52 2015 UTC,Hats off to Ortega. Messi needs support from his fans and compatriots now. It is really nice to see a great Argentina player like Ortega (reminds me of WC '98) backing Messi. I think many actually blame on Messi from the frustration due to not getting anything despite of having a good team. There are other players but I think Messi is no less good than Kempes or Maradon who lead Argentina to the path of victory in '78 and '86; and that's why people have such high level of expectation from Messi.  This Argentina team consists of so many talented players that I hope the Almighty won't let these players retire without winning at least one World Cup. I hope Messi will certainly win a World Cup and will fulfill Argentina's dream of being the world champion once again.  Off-topic: Are you from Argentina?
Barca,3ccxmc,zazzlekdazzle,23,Mon Jul 6 23:50:54 2015 UTC,Perhaps it's time that people start to consider whether the Argentina NT is letting Messi down and not the other way around.
Barca,3ccxmc,Football_Enthusiast,7,Tue Jul 7 00:03:43 2015 UTC,+1 to that. After all these efforts by Messi how come one still says that Messi doesn't have heart for his NT?
Barca,3ccxmc,ShivaSkunk777,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:16:42 2015 UTC,"So many good performances by messi. And those ""bad performances"" seem to be when the rest of his team isn't being very creative. He can't do it all, and his national team doesn't perform when in high stakes games."
Barca,3ccxmc,Football_Enthusiast,3,Fri Jul 10 03:41:46 2015 UTC,"I can see him as a midfielder feeding a lot of passes to Dybala, Vietto, and even though he's a cunt, Icardi. They're the future honestly, if we can have a solid midfield, and a coach with at least 1 ounce of common sense(Tata has negative), I think we can make the final again. The Copa America anniversary game is supposed to be next year, another chance for our boy Messi. But yup I'm from Argentina. I was born there but moved to another country who basically gave me everything, but I still love Argentina with my heart, guess I am a pecho frio."
Barca,3ccxmc,Football_Enthusiast,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:54:17 2015 UTC,"You know, I believe Messi will do a great job playing as a midfielder because this man reads the game like he exactly knows what is going to happen few seconds later. Argentina always have great strikers Dybala, Vietto are the future (what about Iturbe?). After Riquelme there has been a quality midfielder drought but I hope Pastore and Banega will be doing excellent in the coming years.  Argentina have such good amount coaches I don't know why would be hard to get one? Hoping AFA have learned something from this Copa America and they will take corrective measures to fix this coach problem.  Nice talking to an Argentina born redditor; greetings from Bangladesh!! I don't know if you ever heard of our country but Argentina NT visited and played one match in our capital in 2011. Your NT have many fans in our country.  Edit: Spelling mistake."
Barca,3ccxmc,Duke--Nukem,2,Tue Jul 7 00:09:14 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen much of Iturbe to talk, is he that good? I know Correa is also a good up and coming talent, it should be interesting! Pastore impressed me a lot, and Banega plays really good for Sevilla just unlucky in the shootout. Funny enough me and Banega have the same last name, however I'm considering changing it after that penalty.. Hahaha.   It's funny because my dad was telling me that it's so easy to coach a team like Argentina, which shows he's not very educated in football, because Argentina got out coached. He's also one of the people calling Messi a pecho frio, so shows a lot!  Awesome! Of course I know Bangladesh! I have a lot of really good friends from there, super smart, awesome people and you seem like a nice person! It's great to hear how a country so far from mine has a lot of fans, it reminds you of the beauty of football, and how it can unite people from all over the world! Thanks for your kind replies!!"
Barca,3ccxmc,Macchonk,2,Tue Jul 7 00:24:40 2015 UTC,"You are welcome!!   I don't know much about Iturbe either (I don't follow Serie A) but some say (there are few people here who like Italy, thus they watch Serie A) that he is young and have potential; so he might be a future star for Argentina. Banega was just unlucky, can't really blame him for missing that penalty; at least he didn't pull a Higuain in that PK.  I'm hoping other Argentina legends will support Messi to recover from this shock. And those who are calling him pecho frio, I hope they will understand what Messi has been going through all these years and eventually they will stop calling that to him.  Yes you are right, football can unite people, doesn't matter there are difference in region, ethnicity or language; this beautiful sport unites us all. And thanks for the kind words about our people.   PS: You are the first person from Argentina I'm talking with."
Barca,3ccxmc,zazzlekdazzle,14,Tue Jul 7 00:51:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for the post and the translation!   I understand Argentines frustration. It's like you found the magic lamp but you only have 3 wishes. It sucks but you still have 3 wishes granted. Argentines should be contempt with the 3 wishes.

Barca,3ce5n5,broad_h2o,10,Tue Jul 7 05:18:34 2015 UTC,"You really are turning the pathos up to 11, aren't you ;)   That said, I'd like to second your request for an insightful post on this subject from someone on the ground in Barcelona and well-versed in the background of the club.  To me, it seems inconceivable that Bartomeu would even have a fighting chance, and when I read the report the other day stating that he actually leads in the preliminary polls, the sheer incredulousness almost knocked me off my chair.   I could not really understand the Rossell attraction back in the day, either, nevermind the fact that his win was of the landslide variety. But after the myriad ways the RoBarto have thoroughly discredited themselves, how we find ourselves facing the prospect of what amounts to their re-election is beyond me.  We did just win the treble, yes, but I think that every cule must be fully aware of the fact that we owe this to Messi's insane performance level in this season and nothing else. 2014 signings were good, yes (albeit certainly not perfect - you get the sense that only Barca have it in them to sign a player facing a year out due to injury), but without Messi in the side we'd be just a run-of-the-mill European superclub without a distinguishing achievement to our name. So, I'd hope that Bartomeu's attempts to claim a role in the treble would fall on deaf ears.  Is it because other candidates are no good? Or is it perhaps some Catalan thing - maybe Rosell comes from a well-respected and influential family with deep ties in the community? Anyone in the know, please explain."
Barca,3ce5n5,theo_bromine,2,Tue Jul 7 08:18:48 2015 UTC,"Rosell has good ties with Grupo Zeta and to some extent also Grupo Godo, that is true. But if you really think that, not every culer, but every soci is aware of the fact you stated, than you're really, really wrong."
Barca,3ce5n5,Assonfire,4,Tue Jul 7 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"Cause they are blinded by the treble. Recently I was talking to a soci who will be flying back to Barcelona during elections and voting for Bartomeau. I gave him all your reasons on why he should not vote Bartomeau but all he insisted on was that Bartomeau won the treble and he wanted that success to continue. I explained to him Bartomeau had nothing to do with the treble, IMO, but he didn't budge. There are many socis like him. It saddens me alot."

I came across a soci in his early 20's who told me he's voting Bartomeau cause he 'won the treble' and is 'quiet who doesn't want the spotlight and goes about doing his work unlike laporta'. I didn't agree with him, gave my reasons, but he won't change his vote."

Then things got progressively worse, and when given the choice they went with the absolutely closest thing to Nuñez: his buddy Joan Gaspart.   It took a Barça team on the brink of relegation, while Madrid got their 9th Champions trophy, to make them open their eyes a bit, and think that maybe it wouldn't kill them to allow a younger, modern, more intelligent group of professionals to run things for a bit. With their blessing, of course. But soon enough, their sense of entitlement made them say 'alright, these cups are nice and all, but I'd rather have elevators to my seat, please. And if it takes selling half of La Masía, all of our shirt, and sending Messi out on loan to Chelsea, so be it. I want mah elevatur!'  Add a media empire that's profited off this view for decades, and you'll have the electoral landscape you have today. People that are beyond entitled, that thinks the club owes something to them and that the only way to collect is through shiny stuff: new stadium promises, new signings at any cost, even if they involve illegal dealings.  I like to think that they'll start dying off and their views will be replaced by people who know how Messi, Guardiola and Cruyff changed this team forever. But by that point, Barça may be a public traded company, owned by some sheik, neck deep in debt, fighting for 4th place while advertising Monsanto on our diagonal-striped shirts.

I mean, there's no right time you can start watching Barca because you'll fall more and more in love with the team every season (even if the players struggle and make you frustrated). 2010-2011 is a personal favorite for me because even though we didn't win the treble, we completely dominated Manchester United and Real Madrid (5-0). Anyone who was there from 2009-2011 will tell you how Barca was basically untouchable, so it's unfortunate that you missed that.

It signalled the start of a new Barca which was modelled around Ronaldhino and featured a young messi. Then that followed with possibly the greatest club team in history from 2009-2012. Pep's Barca reinvented the sport and dazzled all of us with football one could only pull off in videogames.   This season was amazing. But for me, the 2009 and 2011 season's were jaw dropping."
Barca,3cd4ia,warrrennnnn,3,Tue Jul 7 01:47:50 2015 UTC,"I would say 2003 when Laporta came along with Ronaldinho and Rijkaard. After a lot of years of suffering, it was the start of a whole era which is still extending until this day, and where we got to see Messi grow from that timid kid who played his first games around 2005 to the player he is today. Then, after a two year decline after the 2006 CL came one of the most successful era in arguably any clubs history."
Barca,3cd4ia,Dookie232,3,Tue Jul 7 03:47:47 2015 UTC,"We share a really similar experience! I was nothing but an uncultured American following the World Cup for the first time, and Messi blew my mind with his calculated demolition of Iran (sorry to all my Iranian friends!). I've always followed baseball, but never knew how to 'follow' soccer -- I'd thought all sports were about ERA and OBP and stolen bases and stats, but then there was just this magic flow of the beautiful game that swept me up. Something clicked! Positions and formations started mattering! Tactics jumped out at me! My friends also got me really addicted to FIFA 14 around this time, and I ended up buying the game and playing through a season as Argentina, and then playing through a season as Barcelona.   I joined this sub around the start of the season, because I really wanted to join a sporting community larger than myself. My college homies love sports, but on this sub I discovered this undying passion, this insane devotion that people around the world have for this club, this superteam, and I was hooked. I'd watch every game on weekends. I went through a couple major ups and downs recently (graduated from Berkeley last fall, but also ended a relationship while living in together) and no matter how rough things got I knew I could find some good stuff on here, no matter what.   So maybe it was a lucky season to start following, but I'm pretty sure that even if things weren't looking so good, there would be people around here to show off the greatest moments of times and teams past, of parties of crazy cules from around the globe, of the mad emotions of the city of Barcelona in the beautifully nutso region of Catalunya.   That being said, this season was fucking sick. I had to collect as many ""player's season compilation videos"" into one thread, not for myself, but for any others who might be interested in sharing and reliving the insanity that was the first true season of the holy trinity, the season of Bravo's clean sheets and MaTS' Champions League hustle, the last season of Xavi (i have come to love and worship this man), the brilliance of all of those who took and continue to take the field for Barca.   And to cap it all, now that I'm graduated and have degrees in Linguistics and Cognitive Science and can write apps like a boss, I'm taking courses on http://parla.cat so I can go successfully live abroad in Barcelona and meet some more of you awesome folks and follow the fuck out of this more-than-a-club.  TL;DR: We both came to the right place at the right time. Here's to many more right times! Also, who wants to play FIFA?"
Barca,3cd4ia,petros08,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:56:52 2015 UTC,Glad to hear from someone who has shared a similar experience. You got Fifa on PS4?
Barca,3cd4ia,mr_fingers,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:52:20 2015 UTC,"ahh, nope! I built a PC. (I have two PS4 controllers and 2 360 controllers, because my friends are really picky haha).   Did you see this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfvbnhe3k5k -- the new animations for 16 really make a difference, and it's definitely apparent that they're improving the AI so that defense actually looks... like defense."
Barca,3cd4ia,Phantomchrism,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:33:51 2015 UTC,"Yesssss!!!!!! the new Fifa looks amazing I can't wait to play it. I was especially sold by the video of EA and Messi teaming up to implement no touch dribbling, can't wait to abuse some defenders with that feature."
Barca,3cd4ia,DivineVibrations,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"Of course it's a great time to start watching barca, since the team is so successful nowadays. But IMO you can only truly appreciate the great times if you experience the bad times as well. I was only a small kid when we lost to Milan 4-0, but I was devastated. Don't get me started on the Gaspart era. The Madrid CL victories made me cringe. Sure we won some Ligas back then, but we were never the elite team in Europe. We are now. We are the envy of the footballing world - Madrid included.   It's nice to be on the top, but to have been along for the ride was priceless. I'm enjoying the good times, but the same time am aware that the tides may change and the good times will one day end. If you support the club for a long time you find out that you love for the club is tested time and time again, but that is part of the journey. You have to experience the lows to truly enjoy the highs."
Barca,3cd4ia,Phantomchrism,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:57:08 2015 UTC,"I live in Ireland so most of my life I watched English football. In 1991 long ball dominated - I remember one match where each defence lined up ten metres behind the half way line.   Then we started to get Spanish football highlights and I saw Cruyff's Barca - Stoichkov, Laudrup, Pep, Koeman etc. I fell in love. I've seen some wonderful teams and a few awful ones."
Barca,3cd4ia,DivineVibrations,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:11:28 2015 UTC,"I started from 2010, so I got spoiled as well"
Barca,3cd4ia,godie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:02:10 2015 UTC,"I started watching Barcelona in the mid 1990s and imo I think the best time to have started watching was when Ronadhino was at his best. It was so fun to watch, especially when they won the CL and Messi started to play. The 2009/2010 was insane and imo the best season, but the whole leading up to that point of barcelona was the very best time for me because we kept breaking expectations over and over again.  The 14/15 season has also been quite amazing and at the same time very different, it's close up there but imo the sad part is realizing that Xavi's time is over, and seeing that players like Iniesta, Messi and Alves no matter how incredible they have been this season are starting to get older, not knowing how long we'll have them is depressive. On another side we have young talents like Ter Stegen and Neymar. Another thing is that it almost seems as the trophies aren't as exciting as the 09/10 season because we won it all and proved it was possible, now it feels more like adding to the collection, sorta less special because the first time was just damn f'ing crazy. But ofcourse I value the new treble like crazy, amazing work.  I guess the next 3 minor trophies and the next season will dictate how memorable the 14/15 season is, sometimes you just need the context of the years after to realize things.  But yeah, this season is a dream-like place to start watching them. Back in the mid 90s to mid 2000s it was so incredibly frustrating to see Barcelona never reach the CL trophy even though we also had legends like Ronaldo (Brazil) and Rivaldo playing for us."

Barca,3cb0xa,elmagio,7,Mon Jul 6 14:58:39 2015 UTC,Seung Woo Lee in his earlier days at La Masia. Only around 6 months left before he can play. https://youtube.com/watch?v=bxDrpjmQ5b0  And I spelt his name wrong in the title :/
Barca,3cb0xa,Not_Tom_Brady,4,Mon Jul 6 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"Huge news, didn't see that coming at all ! It's a good way for him to not be any more slowed down by his ban than he has already been, because he'll be right where he should have been at 18 or close to that (with his talent, he might have cracked a few first team appearances by his 18th birthday without the ban) when the ban ends.  It's not perfect but it should kinda make up for some of the lost time, not to mention if he is promoted it has to mean he still shows his potential in training.   Just hoping to still see him in the second half of next season's Youth League, I think he could shine there (especially since our Juvenil A side will be more than decent next year) and that would boost his confidence."
Barca,3cb0xa,broad_h2o,3,Mon Jul 6 15:27:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe the relegation can be turned into a positive: the younger guys who weren't ready for Liga Adelante but who could complete at the third tier will get good experience and hopefully gain promotion and momentum and chemistry over the next few years, while the few players from last season barca b will get experience on loan or get called up to the senior level."

Barca,3cdw34,hamed4321,7,Tue Jul 7 03:48:29 2015 UTC,"I hope Messi,Mascherano(who lost in Copa final), Neymar (who got banned from playing in the knockout stages) Alves and Suarez ( that wasnt able to represent his country that got knocked out ) to be motivated to win everything again after everything in Copa America.I hope Ter Stegen will come back next season as good as ever after a crushing defeat vs Portugal in the u-21 wc.  Bravo had a fantastic 2014-2015 season ! But i still think we should drop him in the Liga for Stegen now cause the kid needs it and was supposed to be at the start. The guy still has a lot to offer and i wish hell be good as ever."
Barca,3cdw34,undesicimo,4,Tue Jul 7 04:01:17 2015 UTC,Why can't the goalie rotation policy stay the same? Bravo gets the league games and MAtS gets cup games. Bravo has been incredible in the last 12 months and it would be very harsh to drop him. The rotation worked like clockwork last season and IMO we should stick with it.
Barca,3cdw34,omgomg259,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:37:25 2015 UTC,Yeah IMO we should keep it the same next season and then change it the year after with Bravo and ter Stegen swapping roles and then the year after that Bravo can just do Copa Del Rey and MAtS UCL and Liga.

After a successful treble season, our rivals will figure out our tactics. I hope lucho can stay on top of things, give our play different ideas and play styles. After winning this year, I want to see him incorporate munir, Sandro, samper and grimaldo more. Hopefully Adriano, and Pedro are sold for these reasons.  I hope to see messi on his best. I hope to see neymar have his best year with us.  I hope to see Suarez with a great goal tally. Overall, us being less dependent on messi.   Also, great competition from atletico and Valencia. Villarreal and sociedad. I want this to be the best league in the world without a doubt. I also want to see R. Madrid relegated lol  I definitely don't want to see De Gea go to them."
Barca,3cdw34,nannulators,2,Tue Jul 7 03:57:22 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree with the ""figure out our tactics"" statement. The thing that made this team so successful is that it was very unpredictable. You never knew where the goals were going to come from. We were dangerous from everywhere on the pitch when we had the ball."
Barca,3cdw34,beastcat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:31:28 2015 UTC,"Yea, but eventually it will come. Just like when it came for pep. Or morinho in his last season with RM. But yea, I agree"
Barca,3cdw34,nannulators,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:24:05 2015 UTC,"Pep's team wasn't unpredictable though. Basically they just passed you to sleep and then the ball would be in the back of the net. When teams figured out they could get numbers behind the ball and render the strategy useless, it stopped. And then everything was up to Messi.  There were bigger issues with Mourinho and RM, among them the rumors that he lost the locker room. His teams are largely counter-attacking teams. If the other team doesn't attack him, they can't lose. It's the same thing that happened with Dortmund.  This current Barca team is much more complete than both of those teams and can employ either tactic. They can pass a team to death, or peg a long ball on a counter. They're not 1 dimensional and thus much harder to figure out or stop unless you park the bus. There aren't really many good bus breaking strategies."
Barca,3cdw34,MayIHaveAHug,2,Tue Jul 7 17:27:04 2015 UTC,"Another fucking treble baby.  Just kidding. It's probably going to be a rocky season(don't hate me) because of the transfer ban and the fact that back to back trebles is virtually impossible; that means the season is almost guaranteed to be considered a ""regression"". That said I look forward to being competitive in every competition and watching MSN do damage."
Barca,3cdw34,Football_Enthusiast,2,Tue Jul 7 17:51:59 2015 UTC,"Winning UCL is the most difficult part in winning a treble I think because the pressure, the schedule and everything is just intense in this stage.  And in recent time only Bayern played two consecutive UCL finals; and after the re branding of European Cup to UEFA Champions League, Juventus (in '97 and '98, lost both of them) and Bayern (in '12 and '13, lost in '12) played two UCL finals in a row.   But none ever won two consecutive UCLs so far. The team we are building now, hopefully Barça will win La Liga and Copa del Rey again in '15-'16; I know that this will be tough but I hope Luis Enrique will make it possible for Barça to win UCL in '16 too.   I know I'm sounding a bit too optimistic; other clubs like RM, Chelsea, MU, Bayern etc. are also building strong teams and with our transfer ban we are a little unlucky and also we will have busy schedule with UEFA Super Cup and Club WC but I'm hoping Barça will put up great fight in all the three major competitions (La Liga, CDR, UCL). At least two amongst these three competitions should be won by Barça in '14-'15 season.  Edit: MU also played two UCL finals in a row in '08 and '09."

I was just pointing out that they're only one game, so they won't have a huge impact on the rest of the season or make it any more busy.  I would suspect the squad rotation will be a lot more intense and constant this season, especially early on and during the group stage of the UCL.

Plus, if we want to fight for the CL this year, we need to have depth. There's no Xavi this year(wtf I can't still believe this :'( ). We depended upon Xavi a lot to stabilize the mid.  Maybe we'll use Arda to destabilize opposition's mid ;).   But seriously, this is a really good signing. Woke up this morning with the notification on my mobile that Arda transfers to Barca and my instant reaction was wtf. But after sometime, I was really happy as this means that the youth players will have their time to play too which would have been a problem with Pogba or any other young signing.

Barca,3cawj3,Icarium_lifestealer,12,Mon Jul 6 14:01:52 2015 UTC,"The article is criticizing Messi for his performance but Chile was on his ass the second he got the ball wtf? I guess what it's saying is true but if you watched the match its not like Messi was missing sitters, he was fouled constantly, and that's what people don't get. During a final Messi is going to get literal brick walls in front of him, which is good to give other players a significant role such as Di Maria and Agüero, because Messi will just get defended by 2-3 then fouled once he breaks away."
Barca,3cawj3,xFragg,12,Mon Jul 6 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"i must be the only one who thought Messi actually played pretty well in the final.  He could have had 3 assists.  He was easily the best player in the tournament as a whole, too."
Barca,3cawj3,mekane84,6,Mon Jul 6 16:59:29 2015 UTC,It was a horrible game if you're a Messi fan. The amount of fouls done on him should have amounted to at least one sending off. They tried the same tactics on him in the league and in the UCL and they overcame it with good tactics and because he has played and trained with his Barca teammates more.
Barca,3cawj3,briliad,9,Mon Jul 6 16:06:38 2015 UTC,"I watched all the games in Copa and I came away thinking ""I'm glad Europe has lower tolerance for tackles"".

Actually technically Messi could have chosen his national team and played for Spain but he chose his actual home country. Point is after you're locked in to your national team you can't pick your national teammates.
Barca,3cawj3,lookiebutnotalkie,9,Mon Jul 6 15:12:40 2015 UTC,"It makes me sad to see him go through all this. He goes from fans chanting his name and doing gestures of prostration to his own countrymen who doubt his loyalty.   I really want an educated opinion from an old fellow who watched the WC in 1986 and tell me how Maradona's teammates and manager were, in terms of experience and quality. The narrative that has been set up is that Maradona was surrounded by ""good but not World class"" players and he single handedly won them the WC.......unfortunately, this narrative is set by people who didnt even watch the fucking 86 WC!"
Barca,3cawj3,TheByronicNomad,4,Mon Jul 6 16:41:59 2015 UTC,That narrative is bought to you by people who didn't watch the World Cup because it's preached by those that did.
Barca,3cawj3,WillAlwaysLie,3,Mon Jul 6 21:43:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly! People are just parroting what a few people before them have preached. I want to personally hear from someone who has had first hand experience watching both of them.  Many old timers in the sport (eg Arsene Wenger) are of the opinion that Messi is the best player ever. How come not many of them say ""Messi is great and all but Maradona took a weak Argentina side to WC glory""?"
Barca,3cawj3,TheByronicNomad,3,Mon Jul 6 21:52:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know but there's also the fact that many won't say what they believe because they don't want to be given grief by the media for something so irrelevant to them so you only hear about those that think Messi is better.   Any old timer who watched Maradona is watching Messi, at least in the World Cup and that is why they say Maradona is better. He won the trophy. Unless you're saying those who actually worked with them . Then I don't know"
Barca,3cawj3,WillAlwaysLie,2,Mon Jul 6 21:57:18 2015 UTC,"That makes total sense. Even from an objective point of view, you can say Maradona was better because he won the trophy and scored crucial goals in the knockout rounds.  Football is a team sport. I find it hard to believe that even a player as phenomenal as Maradona, didn't need a talented supporting cast and manager during the 86 World Cup. I mean, he had Jorge Valdano, a guy who played for Madrid (I don't know if he was a starter for Madrid or did well), which is no where close to being a small time club.  Take Pele for example. Brilliant player. One of the best players ever. However, he didn't carry Brazil to all those WC victories. He made significant contribution, but it wasn't all thanks to him.

Plus of course if he really wanted Arda all along, he would surely do everything to make it a secret as any good negotiator should do. So the fact it came basically out of the blue could mean he actually did want him all along.  I noticed here on r/Barca people seem to hate everything Bartomeu, but sometimes we should just calm down and trust the guys working for Barca and not seek lies and deceit in everything Bartomeu.

Laporta has his own share of clusterfucks from the time he was the president and Benedito appears clean only because he has not yet been one. Every single one of the candidates has their pros and cons.  I study politics so I can tell you that most of those rumours of lies (rumours because as hard as it is to believe neither Bartomeu nor Rosell were ever cought lying), corruption and almost all those law suits are more mismanagement in public relations than evil intentions. Plus of course, right now the club is in good condition financialy and we have built a good team capable of replicating this years successes for many years ahead. New management would change almost everything connected to Rosell/Bartomeu and we would find ourselves in almost exactly the same posititon as last time we won CL and had elections. We had the best squad in the world and many years of domination ahead of us, instead Rosell brought his own ideas and strategies and only now his and Bartomeus work is starting to pay off.

No sense buying a downgrade and playing a different game so that he can score goals we don't need to score.  And I don't agree with him being more physical than Suárez.

Sure in CA '15 he hasn't shown his trademark runs where most of the time he ends up scoring a goal; but people need to understand Messi wasn't leading the attack and he played more of a midfielder type role here which was still quite brilliant.  And about the best player award of CA '15, Messi doesn't care about this sort of achievement and these are more like a consolation gift to him. I read several interviews of him where himself along with Mascherano, Aguero were stating that if their generation don't win any major trophy for their NT this would be a shame for them and they are very desperate after that WC '14 final defeat.

Barca,3c7c85,Illegal_sal,24,Sun Jul 5 15:48:07 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate that this campaign is really going to come down to selecting the lesser of two evils in my opinion. I lean towards Laporta solely because I feel we cannot move forward with a president that is still implicated (innocent or not) in legal procedings. In saying that, all is not perfect with Laporta, people need to realise that he is just an extremely good politician in that he's a master of saying the things the voters want to hear. In the ideal world we'll have a completely new president and board but the other candidates don't realistically stand much of a chance of getting elected."
Barca,3c7c85,ViscaBarca1899,3,Sun Jul 5 23:06:57 2015 UTC,Can you explain some of laporta's weaknesses? What happened at the end of his first term?
Barca,3c7c85,emasterman,5,Mon Jul 6 00:25:55 2015 UTC,"For me the main controversy was when in 2008 he faced a vote of no confidence at the club and around 60% of the votes were against him, unfortunately there is a requirement of 66% in order to force new elections. After that motion he was expected to stand down but refused and half of his board resigned because they felt his actions were inappropriate. I wouldn't say I despise him because he obviously did a lot of great things during his term but just don't trust him 100%."
Barca,3c7c85,ViscaBarca1899,3,Mon Jul 6 02:08:29 2015 UTC,Wasn't that a campaign fueled by Rosell and his posse?

Whether Rosell was involved in pushing the campaign forward or not is really relevant as at the end of the day the question was put to the socis, the majority of whom voted for Laporta to stand down. As I mentioned above he ultimately survived because the 66% threshold was not met and we went on to win the treble that season under Guardiola. Again i'll point out that I'm not for Bartomeu or Laporta, I just prefer to look at the facts in actions instead of falling for glamorous election promises. My opinion doesn't matter anyway as I'm not a Soci and cannot vote, maybe I should hope for Laporta so that changes...."

He is all over media, shitting on everything there is to shit out there.   Let's be realistic Modern football = Business. Laporta is just a typical spoiled politician who knows only how to spend money. Everything is good while they are on power, afterwards they criticize everything and everyone. As if 90% of problems were not actually created by them, and as if they are not criticizing people for fixing these problems. Bringing him would mean another episode of failed transfers and bad press on account of incompetence.   I would take shady and successful over ""innocent"" and incompetent anytime."
Barca,3c7c85,hambug,2,Mon Jul 6 07:18:05 2015 UTC,"The biggest name Laporta brought in was Ibra, which unfortunately did not work out well.

Thuram: See Milito, not his fault he had a heart issue. Keirrison: absolutely aweful signing, never even played iirc. Hleb: was never able to impress, we were blinded by his performance at Arsenal. Zambrotta: See Milito. Very solid RB! Maxi lopez: shit signing. Quarezma: Top talent at the time, just did not fit the squad + injuries. Rustu: barcelona's dark ages of shit keepers."

It doesn't matter if Pep asked for the player, Laporta signed them, so they are his signings too.  I repeat, saying that pretty much ""all"" of his signings were reasonable is just wrong."
Barca,3c7c85,_sic,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:21:43 2015 UTC,"Reasonable perhaps, in a way that they were needed in the moment, but a lot of them were not scouted enough and were bought because they were popular choices on the transfer market."
Barca,3c79fd,Illegal_sal,41,Sun Jul 5 15:18:44 2015 UTC,"We have Aguero who, despite having an injury, have managed to score plenty of goals in the prem. Apparently he can't last the full 90 minutes but to sub on Higuain instead is a huge downgrade...  We have Tevez who had an outstanding season with Juventus... and Tata benched him, he ignored him completely, giving him little to no game time. From the last penalty shootout that we had he doesn't seem to be lacking any kind of confidence (people were suggesting that he could have because he missed against Uruguay)  Di Maria can't stay fit for shit, can't blame him - he wants to create as much as he can but to me it feels like he's trying too hard to replicate his form with Real Madrid.  Pastore is one of our most creative player, not sure why he was subbed off, I don't know too much about his fitness level but to me it felt like a big mistake.  Mascherano, I know he had one mental relapse that could have cost them the game but he's always putting in 110%.  And finally Messi... Having to rely on chance with his other team mates. I can't imagine what it would have been like if the penalty shootout lineup was Messi -> Aguero -> Tevez -> anyone competent enough to take penalties.  Higuian, he's a bottler and for some reason Tata trusts him more than he trusts Tevez? It just doesn't make sense to me.  Nothing about this Argentina team makes sense to me. They need a commanding CM and someone like Dani Alves that can help Messi. They need a coach that knows how to break down stubborn defences and make useful and key substitutions. I can't stand Tata because he always looks baffled at why none of his tactics are working...  I'm not from Argentina, but for some reason it hurts a lot."
Barca,3c79fd,Straega,7,Sun Jul 5 15:46:17 2015 UTC,I'm from Argentina and all of your points is what I'm feeling.  Everyone in this sub can relate with his lack of command on the game. He just uses the same team and hope the players can make it work. He won't change the formation or his tactic regardless of what is happening in the game. And he can't take any criticism. Argentina was disconnected yesterday and his only statement was that we should have won.  It's so frustrating... yesterday I wanted to cry.
Barca,3c79fd,zevah,2,Sun Jul 5 21:51:46 2015 UTC,Any collective thoughts on Tata? Do you guys hope that he resigns?
Barca,3c79fd,Straega,4,Sun Jul 5 21:53:16 2015 UTC,"Argentinians are dicks when they lose. Plus i'm from Rosario and many of my friends are from Rosario Central so they hate Tata just because he is from Newell's.   Nothing on the papers.  Personally I like the guy, he is humble,  but I just don't think he is the top level coach we need to win things."
Barca,3c79fd,zevah,6,Sun Jul 5 21:59:10 2015 UTC,"Haha believe me I know, my Argentine friends are brutal when they lose and when they win they almost riot.

I'm from Spain and lately we haven't been the greatest as we were before. I emigrated to Canada and well our soccer/football here isn't the greatest either.

Barca,3c79fd,zevah,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:07:50 2015 UTC,"In the Semi Finals, all 4 coaches were from Argentina, and in my opinion, Argentina have the worst of the 4. Pekerman is the one I would have loved to still see behind the helm at argentina. Unfortunately, he was the coach just before Messi really got going. The world cup he coached, Messi was very young still and coming in as a sub for the most part. What I like about Pekerman is he isn't stuborn. In the Columbia Argentina game, the first 20 minutes were awful for columbia. Pekerman saw his tactic was not working. So what did he do? He acknowledged he was wrong, and he used one of his subs to make the necessary changes. If he had been stubborn Argentina would have won that game like 6-0 the way things were going. Instead they managed to take it to penalties."
Barca,3c79fd,ScaryDolphin,6,Tue Jul 7 06:46:17 2015 UTC,"Some sense here! That Tata guy is a douche. When a guy like Lavezzi actually spends a reasonable amount of time on the bench for a club like PSG where good players are being brought in for huge cash, you do not deserve to play the most important part of such an important game when Tevez (who made it to the UCL final) and Aguero (who was the go to man at Man City) sit on the bench. There just should not be enough strike force at PSG to put Lavezzi on the Bench period. Maradona would be a better coach than Tata; he will have to play Aguero since he's like family to him haha"
Barca,3c79fd,Buckeye14Guy,11,Sun Jul 5 15:57:28 2015 UTC,"Tata seems like a great person and all but he shouldn't have taken reign at Barca or Argentina, people seem to want Simeone or Bielsa but for some reason Argentina always has the worst option when it comes to Argentine coaches..."
Barca,3c79fd,Straega,8,Sun Jul 5 16:41:34 2015 UTC,"Which is my point...! Argentina has many great coaches: El Cholo, Pekerman, Bielsa, etc. Why they name assholes as coaches?"

Barca,3c79fd,Straega,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:03:42 2015 UTC,"Right??? This is so confusing to me. I was watching a talk show last night in Fox Sports Argentina, all them basically were defending Messi and saying that the team needed time. Just one of them talked against Messi and just one other guy said that Tata  ""kind of"" got his tactics wrong. It was upseting seeing that while they were making some fair points, they all failed to hit the center of the problem. In conclusion they said that Argentina is great and they will be fine, they just need time and some luck.  Then I watched in ESPN the show Hablemos de futbol (Let's talk about football). The comments were basically the same, even one guy ask why Messi doesn't play like he does for Barca and antoher said: ""Maradona es Maradona"" (Maradona is Maradona). All the hollow comments ended when Jorge Bermudez shared his view. He said that Messi while great can't do things on his own, the collective game will always win over the individual one. Messi needs a team, he was  isolated against Chile and had to drop 60-70 yards to pick up the ball. What kind of damage is he going to do there?Then, Jorge Bermudez finally said that Tata got his tactics wrong, he got his substitutions wrong and that the Chilean coach beat him.   My point is that many Argentinians fail to see their reality, a Foreigner (Jorge Bermudez, who is Colombian) had to come and put some sense in the discussions."
Barca,3c79fd,polechi33,2,Tue Jul 7 12:15:30 2015 UTC,"From what I heard Argentines are just very bitter when they lose, I guess at that point (of being in a trophy less drought) they grow tired.  I mean they have one of the most star studded starting elevens but for some reason they never click.  I'm glad Jorge brought up the view that collective game is stronger than individual one, that will always be the case. We see Chile or Peru and they play like a team.  Watching Argentina play... it's not that they are selfish - everything just feels wrong. Going forward no one seems to click, and defending seems to be the best thing we can do.  When I look at Neymar - Suarez - Messi I just love how they click... then when I look at Di Maria - Aguero - Messi, sometimes it's like they haven't played together in years...  Tata getting his tactics wrong is always the same with him, he always seems to underestimate every single opponent. He puts his faith in the wrong player (Higuain over Tevez?!)  Hopefully Argentina gets a better coach and win something, it's devastating seeing Messi and co like this. Especially Masche who I feel bad for the most."
Barca,3c79fd,Straega,2,Wed Jul 8 02:42:11 2015 UTC,"Cholo is at Atletico for the long haul, Bielsa and Pekerman probably don't wanna work for AFA anymore. if i remember correctly, they didn't leave harmoniously. they probably couldn't get anyone better than Tata.  and to be fair, Tata was wonderful at Newell's, and he did very well with Paraguay.  even if he had tried to do something similar with Argentina as he did w/ Paraguay, it wouldn't be too far from how Sabella set them up at the World Cup: defending in numbers, attacking in transition."
Barca,3c79fd,fastfingers,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:31:33 2015 UTC,"A lot of the available argentina coaches have already had their shot and failed. Pekerman and Bielsa for example. I am personally a huge fan of both of these guys. Especially Bielsa. Unfortunately, Bielsa will never coach for Arg. again because we lost in the group stage of the world cup when he was coach mostly due to being drawn against one of the toughest groups ever who packed the middle of the field and abused us in the air since we were much shorter. Bielsa made it through all of South American qualifying undefeated that year. It was just an unlucky draw. That team could definitely have won it all with almost any luck at all. Peckerman I also doubt will ever coach for us again as they absolutely love him in Colombia. He was given a parade after the world cup and copa america performances, and the people rave about him. He coached Argentina in the world cup just before Messi struck it big. In his world cup, Messi was still quite young and came in mostly off the bench. I don't think he even played in the Germany game where we got knocked out. I think the most realisitic coach that I would love to see behind the helm because he has that fight that the team is lacking (outside of tevez and mascherano) is Simeone. I think if he had coached this last world cup, we would probably have taken the trophy back to argentina."

Barca,3c79fd,zevah,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"Zabaleta is quite good on the wing. Very similar to playing style of Dani Alves. He had to stay home a bit more during the Copa Final because Chile had Alexi pushed forward to try to punish Argentina when Zabaleta went forward. My most confusing moment was when they subbed out Di Maria and put in Lavezzi without changing strategy at all. These are two very very different players, and theres no way the same tactic would work. After this sub, Argentina had very few chances the rest of the game. I think Tata was a bit too stuborn with his system. I would have much rather seen him put in another striker, and transition into a 2 striker system. Maybe switch into a 4-3-3 (or narrow 4-1-2-1-2) with 2 strikers up top and messi at ACM or fuck it pop Messi up top and have Tevez play ACM. The Pastore sub was appropriate in my opinion. He looked exhausted out there, and was completely non existent the entire second half. Him and Messi both kind of disappeared for some reason until Messi reappeared right before the end of the game only to have Lavezzi and Higuain waste the opportunity. In my area I have been pushing to change Higuain's name from ""El Pipita Higuain"" to ""el Tronco Higuain"". Its actually being adopted quite quickly haha. I want to like Higuain. Hes always in the right place at the right time, but he is the biggest choker I have ever seen. Tevez for some reason is absolutely loved by the people, but he always has a ton of problems with coaches. This seems to be true almost everywhere he goes. I don't really get it. He has that fighting never give up till the bitter end mentality that Maradona had, and that I would like Messi to have a little more of. I want to take some Tevez and inject it into Messi. That would be a scary thought."
Barca,3c79fd,ScaryDolphin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:37:59 2015 UTC,"I don't necessary rate Zabaleta but I do know he's actually pretty good.  I was confused at the Lavezzi situation too. Tata clearly thinks everything is plug and play, his tactics just don't adapt to any situation.  I want to like Higuain too but I just can't, I don't have any respect for him. He's a good striker but just shit when it matters the most.  I also agree with the fact that I wish Messi had that side of Tevez, it's not that Messi isn't giving his all, it's that he needs to give his all with more ferocity.  I see him angered and frustrated and I know it's easier said than done but I want him to channel that anger to push forward."

I don't like the idea because you will be missing some younger talent due to the olympics.
Barca,3c79fd,canti-,0,Tue Jul 7 06:59:44 2015 UTC,I don't think any of the teams will complain if they win it. It will be before the Olympics and most of the talent on Argentina can't play there anyway. The age limit would leave many players available for the Centario. It really depends on how they manage it or take preference to which player will be available for what.
Barca,3c79fd,ViscaBarca1899,5,Sun Jul 5 18:20:33 2015 UTC,Would love to see Argentina attempt to bring Jorge Sampaoli back home to manage the NT now that he has somewhat completed a cycle with Chile.

Barca,3c7161,Milad731,6,Sun Jul 5 14:18:54 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Vidal had his driver's licence confiscated and must report to the Chilean consulate in Milan monthly. The judge also allotted 120 days for a complete investigation. So it's not as if nothing happened the situation is still ongoing.

Vidal was shown leeway due to his importance to the nation's Copa America interests. That is but one glimpse of the corruption that favored Chile in the Copa America. Now that the Copa America is over and the limelight is no longer on Vidal, I expect Chile to brush the charges against Vidal under the rug."
Barca,3c7161,Skulltrail,5,Sun Jul 5 15:02:44 2015 UTC,False. If you have no previous convictions and you don't injure anyone you don't go to jail. I like how everyone is a chilean lawyer here.
Barca,3c7161,patiperro_v2,-3,Sun Jul 5 17:07:27 2015 UTC,"False. Depends on your alcohol level.   Chile: From 15 March 2012: 0.03%-0.08% the driver is considered to be driving under the influence and carries a three-month suspension and a fine of US$82-US$410 (as of 19 March 2012); over 0.08% the driver is considered to be drunk and carries a prison term of 61 to 301 days, a fine of US$164-US$820 (as of 19 March 2012) and a two-year suspension for the first offense, a five-year suspension for a second offense, and a life suspension for a third offense.   Source"
Barca,3c7161,Skulltrail,11,Sun Jul 5 17:31:15 2015 UTC,"Your source is old (2012). That's the problem with Wikipedia.  The new law (16 September 2014) called ""Ley Emilia"" (the name of a victim of drunk driving) states that jail is only applicable if it causes any injury or death. He only caused material damage.  Because of this his (and as a first offender status) his only punishment will be:   La suspensión condicional del procedimiento por un año y que se le repararen los daños al vehículo del conductor con que chocó y la suspensión de la licencia por 2 años. O sea, quedará en libertad.   To translate: He will have to repair the vehicle of the other driver, he will have his license suspended for 2 years, but ultimately he will be free.  The article is interesting because it criticizes the law as it essentially punishes bad luck, not bad behaviour. Because had Vidal seriously injured anyone or actually killed someone he would be in jail. But luckily for him, he didn't, so he get's a lighter sentence.  Again, this has nothing to do with his 'rich man' status or supposed 'corruption' people like to flaunt around here ignorantly. This is the law for everyone. Might be a shit law, but it has nothing to do with FIFA, Vidal or football.

Barca,3c7161,Skulltrail,3,Sun Jul 5 19:47:44 2015 UTC,"Having his driver's license confiscated is the least they could've done. I think the fact that the judge allotted 120 days for investigation is a bit suspicious. Vidal was clearly drunk driving, and he admitted it and said he was sorry. So I'm not really sure if there's much more to investigate. I agree that it's not as if nothing happened, but it sure seems like the bare minimum was done."
Barca,3c7161,Milad731,12,Sun Jul 5 14:49:39 2015 UTC,"This ref was horrible, but I dont think this foul was that bad, cause I don't see the intention on medel to hurt Messi,   It was maddening to see players fouling Messi all the time, not as violently but constantly, and reversing fouls many times  My criteria for discipline are as follows   Any time a player intentionally stops a play it should be a yellow... Regular fouls are exclusive for clearly accidental   When a player is more violent but from the ref pov no harming intention grant a yellow   Intention to injury, fouls that are clearly out of desperation,  frustration, should be straight red..."

Barca,3c5i8b,Football_Enthusiast,7,Sun Jul 5 05:08:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think winning TREBLE will balance it. Messi loves his homeland a lot and he always has a special place for it. He was offered to play for Spain when he was a young and rising star for Barça but he rejected that offer (imagine if he'd do that he would already be done with winning Euro: X2 and WC: X1).   He said that he is a big fan of Argentina NT since his childhood, he felt sad when Argentina got eliminated in WC '02 from the group stage and he vowed to restore its glory.  Winning TREBLE and all the other individual glories are important for him but I highly doubt all these achievements will ever satisfy his thirst of winning something major on behalf of Argentina. Hopefully Messi will win few more UCLs for Barça and I'm hoping amongst them at least one or two will be TREBLE but God forbid if he doesn't win any major trophy with Argentina he will always regret it."
Barca,3c5i8b,xFragg,10,Sun Jul 5 08:03:47 2015 UTC,"It won't. As much of a ""pecho-frio"" as everyone and their mother likes to call him, Messi has crazy emotion for Argentina. He was crying when we got to the World Cup final, I haven't seen him cry while sober(lol) after winning something with barca. He absolutely loves barca don't get me wrong, there isn't any question as to whether he is emotionally tied to the club, but for him he'd trade all the trebles for a trophy with Argentina. It's my 2 cents from watching him play with Argentina. It's a damn fucking shame we have cunts like Tata and Higuain though."
Barca,3c5i8b,Football_Enthusiast,6,Sun Jul 5 06:40:26 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right, I've never seen Messi showing his emotion while playing for Barça but he was crying when Argentina beat Netherlands in the semi-final; I remember he was hugging Mascherano and both had tears in their eyes (I mean Mascherano is a tough guy even he was emotional when they made it to the final).  I can't stand watching Messi's sad face, this man plays his heart out for Argentina yet he sheds his tears. He is a professional player but suffering two final defeats in less than a year is tough for anyone.  I hope now AFA understand what is wrong with them and take corrective measures to fix the problems."

Barca,3c5r0s,Football_Enthusiast,11,Sun Jul 5 04:26:41 2015 UTC,"And Higuain is still proving himself as Madridista, sabotaging Messi's hard work and dedication for Argentina."
Barca,3c5r0s,jl8912,7,Sun Jul 5 08:29:02 2015 UTC,"Lmao I think you caught him. All jokes aside, I think Higuain's penalty perfectly encapsulates Argentina these past 22 years: bottlers."
Barca,3c5r0s,Football_Enthusiast,4,Sun Jul 5 08:37:57 2015 UTC,"Unbelievable how Higuain wastes his chances. In WC he was gifted the clearest chance to score and here he is in CA doing his job again. Around '90 he failed to tap-in that amazing ball by Lavezzi and pulled his legendary, almost 'Ramos' like spot kick in the penalty shoot-out."
Barca,3c5r0s,Phantomchrism,10,Sun Jul 5 08:49:45 2015 UTC,"That ""amazing pass"" by Lavezzi wasn't that amazing, I couldn't tell if Lavezzi was passing or trying to go for the far post, I don't think he knew either. It was a very nice setup and Higuain should have scored, but that pass was imo not that great."
Barca,3c5r0s,JKapIsClueless,3,Sun Jul 5 09:21:23 2015 UTC,Didn't Higuain have the option to pass it to Messi whi was running to the front of the net?

Also his subs were ridiculous. Banega for Pastore and Higuain for Aguero, both bullshit. Why does Biglia never get taken off? Why does he even start? All he does is run around like a headless chicken, recovering the ball and passing it back to the opponent again. Got so annoyed by the guy today, unbelievable.  Anyway the end result in penalties says it all, Chile 4 - Messi 1. He can't do this all by him fucking self"

Barca,3c55qr,Inspector-Norse,17,Sat Jul 4 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"I'm mad at Higuain too, but I think Tata is a lot more to blame. Like you said, why the hell he didn't bring Tevez in? Tata messed up a lot of his calls this tournament, and this was just the grand finale."
Barca,3c55qr,Milad731,10,Sat Jul 4 22:58:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, Tata is the root to everything bad in this team. Like I said in a previous thread, I wish Pep was the manager of Argentina and LE for Barca... I WISH. And fuck Higuain again."

Barca,3c55qr,jairzinho,3,Sun Jul 5 14:53:43 2015 UTC,I believe that Tata put Higuain on to take advantage of Chile's tiny backline.
Barca,3c55qr,TheMDV,2,Sun Jul 5 06:13:35 2015 UTC,And it's not like Tata didn't have alternatives in the form of the Apache Tevez.
Barca,3c55qr,jairzinho,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:52:42 2015 UTC,Higuain missed a good chance and a penalty. But he wasn't at fault for Argentina's inability to put three passes together in Chile's half of the pitch.
Barca,3c55qr,NotSoFastMister,4,Sat Jul 4 23:38:38 2015 UTC,That blame goes on Tata.
Barca,3c55qr,cdn_brcafan,3,Sun Jul 5 01:09:24 2015 UTC,"That's partially true, but if you're a striker at this level your job is to make sure you put away your chances. He missed a clear chance in World Cup, missed another clear chance tonight, and to top it off he skied the penalty.   All that said, the fault is with Tata. He got 90% of his tactics wrong this tournament. For example, why would he bring Higuain instead of Tevez?"
Barca,3c55qr,Milad731,-4,Sun Jul 5 01:38:04 2015 UTC,He didn't cost them anything. Players miss penalties all the time. Your precious Leo has missed his fair share as well.
Barca,3c55qr,fpvmtimbdbo,4,Sun Jul 5 07:59:13 2015 UTC,"It's not about penalties. He missed a clear chance in the World Cup, and then one more before the end of the game. The penalty was just the cherry on top of the cake for him. My ""precious Leo"" played his heart out in both games and made great chances that were squandered by Higuain."
Barca,3c55qr,Milad731,-4,Sun Jul 5 14:09:59 2015 UTC,Everyone misses chances. Your precious Leo missed a penalty against Chelsea in 2012. He wasted a 120th minute freekick in the WC final when he decided to shoot from 35 yards instead of crossing it in.  Fuck off with your ''played his heart out'' bullshit. You think other players don't want to win? You think Higuain doesn't feel bad?  You Messi fangirls are unbelievable.
Barca,3c55qr,fpvmtimbdbo,4,Sun Jul 5 15:22:22 2015 UTC,"LMAO dude just relax, you're gonna give yourself a heart attack.   I clearly mentioned that it's not about the penalties, and you bring up a time that Messi missed a penalty? Also, in the WC final Messi had to do anything he could since Palacio and Higuain didn't exactly take their chances. Not to mention, he's the best player in the world. If he thinks he has a chance at making that shot, no one in their right mind (aside from Ronaldo or Madrid fanboys) would question him. One of the things that he is always known for is not being selfish. That's the exact opposite of someone like Ronaldo, who I assume you're a fan of because you're so up in arms about ""precious Messi.""  Oh I'm sure other players want to win, and Higuain feels bad (as he should). But people like you come here and sound like Messi didn't do enough to win, or he didn't almost carry the team by himself at times, so it has to be mentioned."
Barca,3c55qr,Milad731,-2,Sun Jul 5 15:58:51 2015 UTC,"If he thinks he has a chance at making that shot, no one in their right mind would question him.   Messi has never scored a freekick from that range in his career. And on top of that the world's best goalkeeper was in goal. Crossing it in would have been a much better decision.   people like you come here and sound like Messi didn't do enough to win, or he didn't almost carry the team by himself at times, so it has to be mentioned.   Where have I ever said that? You're the one who said Higuain was the reason Messi lost both the tournaments when this is clearly not the case."
Barca,3c55qr,fpvmtimbdbo,5,Sun Jul 5 16:08:06 2015 UTC,"Messi has never scored a freekick from that range in his career. And on top of that the world's best goalkeeper was in goal.   So what? Just because he hasn't scored doesn't mean he shouldn't have tried. He also hadn't scored after dribbling past 5 defenders from the middle of the field, but he tried it and it worked. Also, as great as Neuer is he is beatable. For example, I imagine most people didn't think Messi was going to chip Neuer and be successful, but he did it in UCL semis and it worked. My point is that throughout his career Messi has proven that more often than not he is going to make the right decision when it comes to passing or shooting, and no one would fault him for taking that shot if he thought he had a chance at making it.    Where have I ever said that? You're the one who said Higuain was the reason Messi lost both the tournaments when this is clearly not the case.   Obviously Higuain isn't the only reason that they lost the two finals, but his performances don't really help his case either. I don't follow Napoli, but I'm hearing from others that he has bottled lots of good chances with his club team too, so there seems to be a pattern with him in big games. If he puts away those two chances Argentina are the champions of the World and South America.  Having said that, I think the loss last night is more on Tata's shoulders than Higuain alone. His tactics weren't working at all throughout the tournament. And he topped in off by bringing Higuain instead of Tevez."
Barca,3c55qr,Milad731,0,Sun Jul 5 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"So what? Just because he hasn't scored doesn't mean he shouldn't have tried.    That's such a stupid argument. Messi also hasn't scored from his own half. I guess he should have also tried to do that?   My point is that throughout his career Messi has proven that more often than not he is going to make the right decision when it comes to passing or shooting, and no one would fault him for taking that shot if he thought he had a chance at making it.   Yes. but sometimes he makes the wrong decision. It's the last minute of the WC Final and your team desperately needs a goal. It's highly unlikely that Messi scores from 35 yards out against Neuer. Crossing it in would have been a much better decision especially when it's your last chance of the game.   If he puts away those two chances Argentina are the champions of the World and South America.   The chance in the WC final was early in the first half. How can you be so sure Germany wouldn't have equalized?   He missed, yes, but it happens to all players. Messi too missed a sitter against Belgium in the last minute.   The second chance you're talking about is very hard. Lavezzi's pass was poor and was on the goalline when Higuain reached it."
Barca,3c55qr,fpvmtimbdbo,2,Sun Jul 5 20:00:56 2015 UTC,"Messi also hasn't scored from his own half. I guess he should have also tried to do that?   I'm gonna tell you what you just said: ""That's such a stupid argument."" He hasn't because that doesn't make sense. If he thought he could've scored from about 35 yards out then he has every right to try it.    Yes. but sometimes he makes the wrong decision   Of course he does, but like I said more often than not he makes the right call. I'm sure he looked at who was in the box, and thought that shooting was a better option.  I'm sure Germany would've attacked more if they had conceded a goal, but then again, an argument can be made about them being more open and Argentina scoring more. What I do know if that Higuain had a clear chance and he missed it. His job is to put it away, and then if Argentina concede and draw or lose, he's done what he was supposed to.  Messi missed a chance, but he also made so many other chances that was the reason Argentina made it that far. And that's what you mentioned when you said ""it happens to all players."" When you miss one, but make another 3, then that's fine. If you've had clear chances in the biggest events and you keep missing them, then that's a different story.   I agree. The ball from Lavezzi was poor, and he could've done a lot better with that. But still, I think Higuain could've done a bit better, specially when looking at the chance from an alternate angle."
Barca,3c55qr,Milad731,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:32:54 2015 UTC,"If he thought he could've scored from about 35 yards out then he has every right to try it.   Well then it's a very poor decision from him and he deserves criticism for it. Messi's never scored from that range in his career and Neuer's never conceded from a freekick at that range. There was very, very little chance of it going in and the best option would have been to cross it in.  In the end he didn't even test the goalkeeper, he sent it miles over.   I'm sure he looked at who was in the box, and thought that shooting was a better option.   No, it's not. Ask anyone. Even the commentators were all surprised at his decision.   What I do know if that Higuain had a clear chance and he missed it. His job is to put it away, and then if Argentina concede and draw or lose, he's done what he was supposed to.   Yes he missed but once again, it happens to all players. Do remember he also finished off a chance (which was then ruled offside)  And as I've said one again, Messi also missed an easier chance against Belgium. The fact that he creates a lot of chances has nothing to do with it.  I'm merely pointing out that putting all the blame on Higuain for Argentina's loss is completely unfair and ignorant considering even the best players sometimes miss."
Barca,3c55qr,fpvmtimbdbo,71,Mon Jul 6 14:40:05 2015 UTC,Messi should have played for Spain. Argentina is a fucking joke.
Barca,3c55qr,broad_h2o,22,Sat Jul 4 22:49:27 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or are the Argentinean player trying to NOT pass the ball to Messi? Time and time again he was unmarked with tons of space, and time and time again the player on the ball kept on ignoring Messi.."

Barca,3c55qr,XsTream23,15,Sat Jul 4 22:45:10 2015 UTC,He also fucked up the chance right before the end of the game. Subbing him instead of Tevez was a joke.
Barca,3c55qr,Milad731,2,Sat Jul 4 22:53:10 2015 UTC,The chance right before the end was not his fault imo. The angle was really tight and he had to slide towards the ball. Not as easy as it sounds. But Tevez would have been the right choice anyway.
Barca,3c55qr,Diderikvl,2,Sun Jul 5 12:45:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that it wasn't entirely his fault. The ball from Lavezzi could've been better too. But they showed a couple of alternate angles of the chance, and it looked to be open enough for a top-level striker to put it in."
Barca,3c55qr,Milad731,2,Sun Jul 5 14:11:30 2015 UTC,"If only they had another Argentine striker that won the double and played us in the CL final, a striker who is clinical and 10x better than higuain."

I hope this is the end of Higuain and I'd be really happy if Martino gets sacked now. Argentina reached the final but with a pool of that much talented players they should have won the tournament.

Well, he got fouled every time he was on the ball, and when he did get past 2, 3 or 4 players marking him, he had to get past another one, because there wasn't another option. And when he did get the pass out, his teammates let him down (that last play in regular time...).  I feel so bad for him, there's really only so much one person can do on a 11v11 team game. Sometimes I feel that his vacation time is from September to May, since during the summer Argentina just stresses him out."

Barca,3c55qr,JKapIsClueless,2,Sat Jul 4 23:17:19 2015 UTC,"I wasn't impressed by either team but I have to say that Chile played better, they managed to press on, keep the ball and create chances a lot more than Argentina. Mostly it seemed that Argentina got their chances from corners and free kicks. So I say congratulations to Claudio Bravo and our ex-player Alexis Sanchez. As soon as I saw Bravo jumping to the sides in the goal before his first penalty I knew it was a done deal for Chile, Argentina caved in under the pressure.  I feel terribly bad for Messi and Mascherano, Mascherano did a very good job overall and Messi created some opportunities and made it past a few players every now and then. Too bad Chile fouled him constantly, I think the ref was shit in that regard. Also his teammates didn't know how to use him properly in strikes (like Barca does).  But I have to say that I'm incredibly disappointed in Tata and his tactics & calls, I'm so glad we got ridd of him in Barcelona. There was a clear lack of midfield, Tevez wasn't played and even the presence of Higuain was stupifying after his track record, putting him in the penalties was even worse. But I have to say that his miss in the 2nd round was also due to the shitty pass he got, it was like the other player didn't know if he was going to pass or hit the far post.  I'm very disappointed in Argentina when they have such talents running in the field, I hope they clean that shit up before the next WC. I feel most sorry for Mascherano who was a beast."

It's been annoying.   Speaking of creating space, Aguero failed to create some space on a couple of occasions. He could have put himself in line of one of those delicious Messi passes but was very static."

Barca,3c4kfo,T_Peg,19,Sun Jul 5 04:35:59 2015 UTC,"Thing is, he didn't have a ""weird and inconsistent season"". He was adapting to a new role that isn't easy to adapt to when you're more of an attacking midfielder. He knew what Luis Enrique wanted, and adapted to it. The only reason we didn't see the blinks of shiny Iniesta of the last couple of years is because he has come to be more of a retention midfielder. Once he adjusted, he was playing superb. Not once this season did I ever think he was playing sub par to his previous seasons. He has and always will be Don Andres, el maestro. For me, it was around February when he started getting into rhythm and was the best midfielder of the last 3-4 months of the season.   Don Andres will always have my respect and admiration. Also, only person to be MOTM in 3 finals :')!!!"
Barca,3c4kfo,fcueva-,8,Sat Jul 4 19:09:48 2015 UTC,I regret that I can only give this post one upvote. Signing a shiny new thing and benching Iniesta is one of the dumbest (imho) things we could do.

His cule self has stopped him up until now, but at some point of time, his reasoning, his fair judgement would overpower it and he would leave.  He should have left a year ago for his benefit.

Barca,3c3fta,Rempelrez,3,Sat Jul 4 14:42:59 2015 UTC,"He was slower and the WC summer affected him. Also, he had to adapt to a new partner in midfield, Rakitic, that drifted to the right a lot. In intense games, he had a lot of ground to cover and sometimes got ""lost"".  Once things clicked, he got going: rest from rotation, Rakitic becoming good in midfield, Neymar started doing some left flank defensive work.  He clearly wasn't bad, but in some games he seemed outplayed, which is unusual for Andres."
Barca,3c3vai,IhateAngryBirds,3,Sat Jul 4 14:50:34 2015 UTC,"Prolly gonna drop writing a recap of this week, been a bunch of interviews here and there, candidates saying stupid stuff. Debates from Monday. As of now Bartomeu is still refusing to attend debates."

Barca,3c3vai,rbarcelona,4,Sat Jul 4 17:23:13 2015 UTC,"Probably afraid, came up with lame excuses really."
Barca,3c3vai,chygga,2,Sat Jul 4 17:27:09 2015 UTC,I don't understand how he's even a favorite to win. He's a jackass and not really a president.
Barca,3c5b48,Acquits,14,Sat Jul 4 22:57:40 2015 UTC,"Tevez should have been subbed on, what a joke"
Barca,3c5b48,NovacElement,7,Sat Jul 4 23:07:02 2015 UTC,They really did a bad job today. What horrible passes and clearances. You're not supposed to pass it to the oposing team when you're clearing the ball. Especially if the opponent is 5 yards from you. They defended like hell because they couldn't move the ball further up the pitch.   Midfield is non existent. They have a huge talent like Messi and don't know how to play with him. He literally does all the work and they stand there watching him like spectators. Jefecito didn't have too bad of a game just 1 huge missed tackle/clearance but was good overall.   I am in no way taking anything away from Chile I thought they played well and were dangerous. Their 2 best players were/are Barcelona players (not biased at all there lol).   But I think I'm done romanticizing Argentina ever winning any trophies while Messi is active. And to hell with all the Argentines who believe Messi doesn't pour his heart out on the pitch for the national team. Had he played for Spain I'm sure he would've had 2 world cups by now. Unappreciative sore losers. When Argentina's coach and the entire team realize that they have to play like a team instead of relying on Messi to do all the work that's when they'll win. But that's never happening.
Barca,3c5b48,tonytetova,5,Sat Jul 4 23:12:15 2015 UTC,"I'm done romanticizing Argentina ever winning any trophies while Messi is active.   As much as I dislike this statement, but I think you are just right; unless they bring up a dramatic change in their coaching and team play."
Barca,3c5b48,Football_Enthusiast,3,Sat Jul 4 23:21:38 2015 UTC,I can't take another final man. Can't. The stress it's just too much. I'd rather they just lose out in the early knockouts and that be it.
Barca,3c5b48,InAnIndianAccent,13,Sun Jul 5 00:11:33 2015 UTC,Why does Messi keep playing deep?  Have you seen all the fouls against him? Literally touch the ball --> gets fouled.   This shit doesn't work.
Barca,3c5b48,hacktivision,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:03:59 2015 UTC,Probably because he'll get the ball less if he stays really forward but that makes him way less effective
Barca,3c5b48,njastar,11,Sun Jul 5 15:17:53 2015 UTC,"I hope this is the end of Higuain's career for Argentina NT. You are right Argentina need a big game player like Iniesta. Messi can bring his team to the final but he probably gets stressed out due to the exhaustion from all the hard works he does to pave the path to the final, I think he needs better support in his national team.  Time to wake up AFA, recruit a better coach for your NT who would stay away from players like Higuain and Palacio.  PS: Don't hate me for this but now I've seriously started to believe that Messi is Cruyff 2.0 for Argentina NT. But I hope I'm wrong because it would be a shame for a world class player him not to win any major international championship."
Barca,3c5b48,Football_Enthusiast,3,Sat Jul 4 23:25:10 2015 UTC,"AFA is too stupid to bring on a competent coach. Just today I was reminded Bielsa is Argentinian. Why is he not coaching?!?! Didn't everyone see Tata has no clue what he's doing when he was at Barca??  Also, Higuin should never play for Argentina again. Tevez has a stellar season yet higuin gets the nod over him?!"
Barca,3c5b48,cdn_brcafan,2,Sat Jul 4 23:10:55 2015 UTC,"Tata is simply incompetent to manage a team like Argentina. There are many good coaches who will do great managing Argentina. I hope AFA learned something from this tournament and will take necessary steps to make things better for Argentina NT.   Argentina lost two major tournament's final in a row which is unacceptable for a team stacked with this much talents. I hope Tata gets sacked soon. Great coaches like Passarella and Bielsa (even when people like Menotti, Bilardo are still alive then why AFA won't take some advice from them to restructure the NT) are there in Argentina and I hope AFA seek them for help soon."
Barca,3c5b48,Football_Enthusiast,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:24:59 2015 UTC,"I am really curious to kno what goes on in the AFA. How is it that an inexperienced guy like Maradonna gets to coach Argentina in the WC. I mean, Brazil hasn't simply tried Pele last I checked. So what went through their minds when making that decision?"
Barca,3c5b48,cdn_brcafan,2,Sun Jul 5 02:11:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know how AFA is being run now but back in the days when Julio Grondona was the president of AFA, I've heard that he was a quite corrupted person himself. I guess our fellow Argentinian redditors can tell us about the current condition of AFA. But a great player doesn't necessarily mean that person will be a great coach too, there are some exceptions but this doesn't happen all the time. Plus Maradona himself is a quite controversial figure so I never thought that he would be a great choice as a coach."
Barca,3c5b48,Football_Enthusiast,8,Sun Jul 5 15:16:45 2015 UTC,Vietto would have done better
Barca,3c5b48,R0b1nh0,4,Sun Jul 5 22:11:23 2015 UTC,THIS!!! We need youngsters like Vietto or even fucking Dybala!!
Barca,3c5b48,TheCornholio66,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:59:13 2015 UTC,"For a game like this I think Icardi would have done better, reminds me of Tevez a little also he is more physical then Dybala."
Barca,3c5b48,FrostyGrass,3,Sat Jul 4 23:15:12 2015 UTC,"Not only Iniesta, but a player like Dani Alves would benefit Messi completely."
Barca,3c5b48,Straega,2,Sun Jul 5 06:19:20 2015 UTC,"Pastore is like Iniesta.   Turning up is not a skill like others, its a situation which depends on other factors going your way first. Messi is enough, if he gets proper help.   Argentina have all the players that a team needs. They don't miss anyone. They miss a coach who is good enough to use them properly and effectively."
Barca,3c5b48,iVarun,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:24:17 2015 UTC,"Curious, who would you like to see coaching Argentina?"
Barca,3c5b48,Straega,5,Sat Jul 4 23:31:32 2015 UTC,Someone who isn't stupid enough to pick Higuain and Banega in the shootout?
Barca,3c5b48,hacktivision,2,Sat Jul 4 23:37:29 2015 UTC,I feel that Banega was just pressured because of Higuain's miss. People are wondering where Banega's criticism is well there's a difference between the two players.  Not to mention the fact that a lot of people correctly predicted that Higuain was going to miss the penalty... It's just common sense.
Barca,3c5b48,Straega,3,Sat Jul 4 23:42:22 2015 UTC,"Argentina has such a great crop of coaches and yet they can't get one for themselves.    Even Sampaoli would be an massive upgrade, just on the metric that he knows tactics.    I would prefer someone like Simeone, can play rough, can play fluid, tactically proficient, changes shapes mid game, learns from mistakes, is pragmatic despite being very tough and strict. And is crazy passionate, embodies the outward Argentine national persona and psyche. I'd pick him but it seems unlikely he'll be in the job anytime soon."
Barca,3c5b48,iVarun,2,Sun Jul 5 00:15:41 2015 UTC,One can hope that he leads Argentina in the 2018 World Cup. At this time Higuain shouldn't be called up and Tevez would be too old unfortunately. Still Argentina has great upcoming youths and Simeone would be able to whip them into shape.  Some of my Argentine friends are even asking for Peru's coach at this point because of the way he managed Peru in this tournament.   I wish I knew about Argentina's papers. I'd love to hear their thoughts on Tata right now.
Barca,3c5b48,Straega,2,Sat Jul 4 23:49:35 2015 UTC,"Its so sad all this. This Argentina generation was almost as good as it gets, such luck is very rare even for elite footballing nations, just look at Brazil and their struggle to find proper players.    Its sad watching it being squandered. This is like watching Ronaldinho wasting his career times million. It a shame."
Barca,3c5b48,iVarun,2,Sat Jul 4 23:55:00 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. Now I know how the Dutch feels. Tournaments don't come every year, their players are getting old.   Argentina has a gold mine of world class players who are going to miss silverware due to coaching incompetence."
Barca,3c5b48,Straega,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:02:06 2015 UTC,"I think the Argentina generation with Riquelme, ayala, sorin, crespo, aimar, a young messi, was the best it got. They also played amazing under Pekerman (see 2006 worldcup). Now that was a team.   Tata is too stupid to understand tactics."

Barca,3c5b48,Straega,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:13:09 2015 UTC,"He won't for another 10 yrs minimum unfortunately. He's a young coach who values working week in week out with his players. National team coaches typically work sporadically with their team, during the international breaks. Simeone wont like that.  Also, soon as he says he's leaving atletico, he'll have tons of big money offers from big clubs. For a young coach that's hard to pass up.  If he did coach Argentina though then sky is the limit."
Barca,3c5b48,cdn_brcafan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:14:11 2015 UTC,Bielsa. He's the one who transformed Chile into who they are today. He made monsters out of Bilbao. He is highly respected by top coaches. He is Argentinian.
Barca,3c5b48,cdn_brcafan,2,Sun Jul 5 01:34:26 2015 UTC,"Argentina have some very talented players, however every game I've seen them play over the last couple of years, they lack control against tougher opposition. Chile's high pressure really destabilized Argentina to a point where most of their chances to score were on counter-attacks."
Barca,3c5b48,lonestar_10,2,Sun Jul 5 01:27:10 2015 UTC,"Messi had the best whoscored.com rating in the final and was MOTM for many outlets. People underrate his performance in that game. He wasnt the best but him, along with Buffon, were the second best players.   And yes Argentina do miss players with spark comparable to Messi's who can be directly effective when Messi isn't."
Barca,3c5b48,TwoTecs,3,Sun Jul 5 14:15:38 2015 UTC,I hope Messi retires from the NT he doesn't deserve these shit bottlers.
Barca,3c5b48,xBarDown,2,Sun Jul 5 15:09:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that Argentina misses non-Messi big-game players...  He wasn't his best today, but what can a player do 40 meters away from the opposing goal, with very little passing options and 2-3 players on him? Dribble pass one or two, and pass on the ball (because there was space generated).   But for all the space that was generated from man-marking Messi, still there was no other Argentina player to use it up. Di Maria looked good in the beginning but got injured very soon. As soon as Di Maria got injured, all the focus was on Messi and it mostly worked.  I love that Messi has great players with him in Barcelona, and just trying to crowd him out will leave the other players too much space."
Barca,3c5b48,ManoloBar,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:06:23 2015 UTC,"I've always maintained that Messi would retire without being a World Cup champion. But it seems that even Copa América is too much to ask for the nation that turned its back on him when he needed them the most.   I feel so damn sad for him. It's yet one more summer of him returning depressed to the club that does love, unlike his country of birth."
Barca,3c5b48,CorsarioNero,2,Sat Jul 4 23:14:32 2015 UTC,Let's hope this motivates Messi to win back to back trebles!
Barca,3c5b48,Rempelrez,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:19:58 2015 UTC,Biesla is also not a right coach IMO. He sucks energy out of players. Which means--> Top the group -> Win QF-> Players and esp Messi would vomit in semi's and lose eventually.
Barca,3c5b48,cdn_brcafan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:23:39 2015 UTC,"That may be the case for a league season but certainly players energy wouldn't be sucked out that quick in a tournament over a month I would hope. I think Bielsa would be great. He doesn't take shit from players, understands tactics, made Chile into who they are today with their attacking brand of soccer, etc. Pep also praised him a number of times."
Barca,3c5b48,Macchonk,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:15:48 2015 UTC,"I think their biggest problem is their line up... They absolutely need CM role.. They have two DM players who is absolutely mediocre at attacking and they have 3 AM followed with a striker.. That Mid is hurting so bad because there is body covering it... Messi who is supposed to be up there had to drop to mid way too often.. And their biggest problem.. Tata Martino,,"
Barca,3c5b48,jairzinho,0,Sun Jul 5 15:07:32 2015 UTC,"Bielsa is a great coach but he's exhausting for the players at a day-to-day level. However, with a NT he's the perfect coach, he can get his message across quickly and get them playing as a team and pressing without having enough time for shit to turn sour as it often does with him."

Barca,3c1sr0,Aj16ay,19,Sat Jul 4 01:43:05 2015 UTC,"Same with Iniesta started a bit iffy, I was worried Lucho's style wouldnt fit him as he had a much bigger area to cover compared to previous years, but Busquets adapted quite fast, wasn't long before he was back into beast mode."
Barca,3c1sr0,IhateAngryBirds,19,Fri Jul 3 23:49:05 2015 UTC,"A Busquets moment on CL final:  Around 82th minute, Busquets was positioning in right wing. From there, he lobbed to Xavi Rakitic just outside the box & Xavi Rakitic made an easy pass to Pique who was completely free in juve penalty box. What's interesting Busquets's pass. All Juve player expected him to cross to the penalty box. But once Busquets passed to Xavi Rakitic, all Juve player moved other way around which resulted in completely unmarked Pique.  Edit: Yes, Rakitic. I forgot."

With another fullback being added to the first team (Vidal), Montoya will get even less playing time than before.

Barca,3c0brv,egcg119,5,Fri Jul 3 20:15:33 2015 UTC,He wasn't good enough. That's part of the system. To expect otherwise is unreasonable.
Barca,3c0brv,Rempelrez,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:36:30 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people are putting a lot of expectation on La Masia nowadays, partly due to the fact that once-in a generation talents such as Messi, Xavi, Iniesta, Busi, Carles, Cesc, Pique, were produced all at the same time. I think we all pride our club in this way of nurturing players, but to expect greats to come out every year is totally unrealistic.   While the production of ""world-class"" players has decreased, it's be understandable because what happened between 1995-2005 was ridiculous and we won't see a batch of players all come out that talented for a while. It set everyone's expectations too high.  I'm happy for Martin, hope he gets playing time at a good club like Inter. He should be under safe hands because Mancini hopefully knows what he is doing."
Barca,3c0brv,Assonfire,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:39:43 2015 UTC,"I think one of the things people don't want to see is us buying players for positions youngsters can fill in.  We all know Sergi Roberto isn't the next Xavi, but goddamn we'd rather see him than Song, for instance.  We had a similar situation in the era of 1995-2000. Players like Oscar and Roger weren't world class, but they were good enough. Instead of using them, they were sold and we bought players like Ciric."

Barca,3c1qpn,YoSoyMilkChocolate,7,Sat Jul 4 02:14:18 2015 UTC,"Biggest problem for Argentina is Chile press very well, better than Paraguay or Colombia. In both matches Argentina may have advanced but still struggled at the base to relieve pressure. It will require Pastore and especially Messi to drop very deep to advance the lines"
Barca,3c1qpn,Aj16ay,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:20:24 2015 UTC,"Medel is a warrior. Can't underestimate him especially because of his height. He should be able to hold off Aguero or Pastore. Messi on the other hand, I just hope Aguero and Di Maria don't take advantage of the magic given by Messi."

Aguero, Di Maria, Pastore... Damn.   I really can't wait to see Chile face Argentina. I'm scared but why wouldn't I. It's the final. Chile will fight just as hard as Argentina.

Barca,3c132b,tacobeams,18,Fri Jul 3 20:19:06 2015 UTC,"Fuck this guy, he's so shit and still has a good chance of winning due to older Socis. Laporta better take advantage. (Although he didn't know who Barca B's keeper was in an interview the other day)"
Barca,3c132b,broad_h2o,2,Fri Jul 3 20:23:57 2015 UTC,"Thing is, Laporta is far from perfect either. But he makes up for his shortcomings by listening to people who know better than him. (ie Pep, Cruijff, Alexanko, ...) He doesn't pretend to be a football expert playing Football Manager like this board has been doing."
Barca,3c132b,elmagio,6,Sat Jul 4 11:42:24 2015 UTC,"Xavi, Iniesta, Pepe Reina, Valdés, Pep Guardiola, Busquets, Pedro, they passed through La Masía with little to moderate attention. It allowed them to develop as players and people in relative peace. Nowadays, academies are heavily scrutinized and players are hyped from very young ages (Halilovic, Odegard) and that excessive attention at such a young age is not good for their development. La Masía is the most famous and most hyped academy in the world. So naturally the hype surrounding its players is multiplied many times over. The club itself hypes the academy quite a bit and showcases the players to the world by playing them in friendlies, etc.  There are many examples of prime talent losing their way because they started to believe their own hype, began to feel entitled, were lured away by big money offers at young ages or simply couldn't deal with the pressure of massive expectations: Gai Assulin, Gio Dos Santos, Bojan, to name a few off the top of my head. It's starting to look like Deulofeu might be another cautionary tale.  In that sense, what Barto says about going back to being more discrete isn't entirely off the mark. It's not a terrible idea for these very young players to be isolated and protected more, allowed to grow up and mature before the spotlight shines so brightly on them."
Barca,3c132b,_sic,4,Sat Jul 4 07:56:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, but when you pair it with his other statement (not wanting them to actually play for or train with the first team), it sounds more like he wants to bury La Masia than he wants the youngsters to grow in peace.  To me it feels like his plan is to make sure no one bothers him with La Masia not working anymore because no one would know what happens with La Masia anymore."
Barca,3c132b,elmagio,12,Sat Jul 4 11:45:11 2015 UTC,"WTF?!   It is a mistake to make them [B players] both train with the first team, making them play friendlies and debut in cup games.   That it what most clubs in the world are doing. How else should our youngsters be ready to perform on the high level?  ""La Masia no es toca"" indeed."
Barca,3c132b,zero237,7,Fri Jul 3 20:18:33 2015 UTC,I was genuinely speechless when I saw that comment. Absolutely disgusting.
Barca,3c132b,efarfan,3,Fri Jul 3 20:34:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is the right mindset and I believe this is part of the demise of La Masia. However, I believe his intentions are to take away pressure from some of La Masia products. These kids come into a friendly or play a couple of times with the first squad and we have cases like Deulofeu where his head got too big from too much hype at a young age."
Barca,3c132b,efarfan,0,Sat Jul 4 00:19:56 2015 UTC,Deulofeu's problem was definitely not hype. Hype is absolutely normal when you play as well as he did for the reserves. Deulofeu was his own demon and his lazy habits and lack of dedication discarded his own chances of breaking through.
Barca,3c132b,_sic,5,Sat Jul 4 01:21:42 2015 UTC,"He was snubbed from being capped by Spain a couple of times explicitly because Del Bosque said he was getting too cocky and he feared a cap would make him even more. I think it was all these attributes that led to his demise, but his hype and cockiness was most definitely part of his issues."
Barca,3c132b,IhateAngryBirds,2,Sat Jul 4 02:15:01 2015 UTC,"No, it was the hype. He's been hearing and reading that he's the greatest player ever since he was a little kid. The lazy habits and lack of dedication have resulted from that constant hype."

But i hope that after these statements they finally wake up and realize that this guy is not good for Barca"
Barca,3c132b,IhateAngryBirds,5,Fri Jul 3 21:43:37 2015 UTC,He's a favorite because he has power over the media and the elder socis vote for him. There are a lot and they're all stubborn so nothing can change their minds. I met some in Berlin and they'd all vote for Bartomeu.
Barca,3c132b,Football_Enthusiast,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:44:48 2015 UTC,I thought Laporta was ahead of Bartomeu and also Cruyff is directly supporting him. I think those who will get to vote would consider Cruyff's reasons for supporting Laporta.

The point is - we're FC Barcelona, and we're above that. No shirt sponsor at all, or UNICEF, used to be our method. The club wasn't broke then, was it?   I know Barcelona fans have a reputation as being smug, and that this might sound smug, but there are many of us who genuinely love the social and political things this club has historically stood for, and who include that as a major reason (for me, THE major reason) to support them.

Barca,3bvhro,SubjectAndObject,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:43:04 2015 UTC,"No at single one here has made a good argument for this? For me it is obvious that this is a perfect sponsorship.  How would dropping the sponsorship and stopping the contact with the country make things better? They still have oil, we will always buy their oil. Furthermore stopping the contact will just make them even more closed and backwards like North Korea or Saudi Arabia. What has changed Qatar is the tourists and the Western workers there who wear bikinis and have the idea of free media. This is the single most important factor for change. And contact with great Western companies is what makes the country even more open to us. This is what I want for my country, Russia. I want Western media and good relations to the Western world. That's the best thing in the world. I don't want barricades. And Europe should also use that tactic towards Qatar, Russia and China. Just boycotting them is what we do to North Korea and Iran and now Russia. And what does that change? Their dictatorships or oligarchs don't care. What we care about are the people living there. Telling them their rights and giving them the message. In 50 years time Qatar can become the most Western Muslim country - but only if we stay in contact with them and force more Western media and ideas on them. Already now you have skimpy Russian women there - great!"
Barca,3bvhro,JurijFedorov,12,Thu Jul 2 19:33:05 2015 UTC,"I will never appreciate the modern age slavery that goes on in many countries. In Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, India, Chaina, Bangladesh, Vietnam everywhere this matter is tolerated. But I'm with you about the fact of not rejecting them. Dropping the sponsorship, terminating diplomatic relationship will make these things even worse.  For an example; in FIFA World Cup 2014, official jerseys for multiple participant countries have been made in Bangladesh. And these jerseys were made in local sweatshops where the workers earn salary worth of $68 every month. Major sports apparel/kits/accessories manufacturers such as Adidas, Nike have their jerseys made through these poor workers but none even raise a finger but if they stop making jerseys in Bangladesh will this be ever solved, of course not. Not only in Bangladesh I've heard that in Vietnam little kids are extensively used to make Nike boots/training shoes."
Barca,3bvhro,SubjectAndObject,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:09:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's what media tells us to hate. Have people even seen the workers who make their smartphones? It is exactly the same thing as in Qatar. Very small rooms for a lot of people, no unions, no seeing your family, terrible pay, suicide nets etc. The most obvious thing would be to not buy a smartphone! That's even easier than asking Barca to drop a sponsor! So, who is first? If you don't do it you are a hypocrite if you ask me. Will people watch the WC 2022? Hi, why should I be forced to not make that choice if you are making the choice? People are dying of hunger each day? Are you overweight? It's just not that simple as ""let's boycott everything we don't like"". You would have to boycott your life. And the immigrants working in Qatar? They are not working for Qatar Airways. Just because the state owns the company does not mean they are the same thing. England (GB) owns BBC. I don't blame everything England does on BBC. Qatar Airways won the best airway of the year award. So are they really that terrible?"

It may make for seemingly clever contrarian arguments on the Internet, but its a incredibly destructive system of moral claims.   However, followed to its logical conclusion, all human rights abuses are allowed and all critics are hypocrites. After all, no one if perfect (and if they are, accusations will still be levied), so no one can say anything is wrong, right?  I am, of course, setting aside the deceptive claim that ""[labor abuses in smartphone manufacturing] is exactly the same thing as in Qatar."" Unless smartphone workers (who do suffer incredible abuses) are being de jure forced to labor, it is not the same circumstances as Qatar."

Otherwise we would not act that way. We can't attack one of the more liberal Muslim countries and ignore the rest.
Barca,3bvhro,sleepsholymountain,3,Thu Jul 2 23:16:36 2015 UTC,"Demand creates supply, as long as the world is run by the capitalist nations and their patrons it doesn't matter these poor souls are being deprived from their fundamental rights because these workers lives are less valuable to the elite class people.  We are more than a club so we shouldn't be linked with such heinous affairs (I know Qatar Airways is great and they may not be directly involved in abusing human like apparel/electronics manufacturing but this is Qatar government's concern and they allow violating human rights so one way or the other QA is part of that system.). And that being said shirt sponsorships always play major role in generating good amount of money, thus Barça cancelling the shirt sponsorship means the income will reduce.   So my advice would be this: Barça should wait until a better shirt sponsorship deal opens up for them then they can just drop Qatar Airways. I know, this is a cruel world and probably there is no large corporation can be found who are 100% clean but Barça should try to make a better deal with such corporation/organization who are cleaner than the current one.  People please don't get me wrong, I'm not supporting what is happening in many middle-eastern and Asian countries in the name of employing people for the further development and growth of economy but dropping a major sponsorship deal will not be good for us."
Barca,3bvhro,JurijFedorov,3,Fri Jul 3 00:34:15 2015 UTC,Yes... This is a good point to. We are shaking the boat. If the next sponsor will only give 80% of what QA gives we will have a hole in the budget. In the end of the day Barca is a business. And is there a single... just ONE government or business worldwide that has blocked QA from being there or working with them? Should Barca be the first one? I don't think we should do that and become involved in even more politics.
Barca,3bvhro,SubjectAndObject,2,Fri Jul 3 07:22:45 2015 UTC,"I won't say our club is a business concern but it requires huge amount of money to run a club properly (think about the huge expense that our club make such as payments for our players/coaching and training staffs/medical and physio staffs/maintenance of our stadiums/expense related to La Masia/other important stuffs etc.). And a major shirt sponsorship deal will always help to fetch good amount of money to cover these expenses.  I've already mentioned that the world is run by the capitalist nations, so why would these nations bother about Qatar government's unethical actions as long as their interests are mutual?   We don't have Al-Khelaifi or Abramovich supplying almost unlimited resources for financing our investment/expenses; so I think as long as Barça don't find a better shirt sponsorship deal they should stick with Qatar Airways."

Its false on two levels:  1) The rulers of Russia and Iran care plenty about ""Western"" policies and public perception. It affects their economic bottom line. Caring doesn't mean that they're going to magically change everything and become Sweden policy-wise.  2) Saudi Arabia has had decades of economic contact with the Western world, and no widespread boycotts or sanctions. And the change in human rights violations there has also been glacial. China is the U.S. largest trading partner, but I have seen no indication that it responds meaningfully to U.S.-based reports on human rights violations in China."
Barca,3bvhro,JurijFedorov,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:23:16 2015 UTC,They change slowly according to you. But Western societies change fast that's why we can't understand how another country needs 50 years to change an unfairness there. We need to think more longterm. SA has changed a hell lot. For us it seems like nothing but for them allowing women to bicycle I a park is a big advance. And women voting in a small election is another step. They do change. It is very slow but they continually improve. Still SA is a terrible country all in all for human rights. What we need yo do I don't know - or maybe I do. But I know for certain that boycott will not be final solution to the problem. It will just sweep it under the rug.

But another midfielder, probably not."
Barca,3c193e,ir7425,4,Fri Jul 3 21:17:46 2015 UTC,"Neymar and Suarez signings were necessary because we didn't have decent forwards to fit their role, with Pedro form dropping a little bit, Sanchez and Messi simply can't do the job by themselves and we needed a change. now, we're a treble winning squad, it's a bit different.  But I completely agree that these two transfers payed off, but do we really have to sign another midfielder for +80m even when we're banned from playing him until 2016, and we have the likes of Rafinha and Suarez waiting for their chances?"

God knows how much but Neymar isn't less than 90-100M. Hazard isn't available for less than 100-120M, same goes for Verratti too. And I believe Pogba's talent is as much as every name I mentioned.  Sport-wise, in this thread some excellent points are identified why & how Pogba can be necessary signing.

Although I can admit that the market today's inflated, Pogba seems to be more inflated than most. He's good player but not worth the money paid for him though."

Pedro outperformed Henry, Busquets out preformed Yaya  Toure. Rafinha has outperformed nobody.    (which also makes him the highest paid player in Barça after Messi who is on 13M€) is deserved    This I want to talk about. For starters, Messi makes 20 million euros a year after taxes. Pogba's rumored 12 million a year would actually still be under Luis Suarez who earns about 14 million(?) a year(feel free to fact check me but I believe these are correct). Now, would you have said Suarez is worth that much a year ago? How about Neymar ( also higher than Iniesta)? Honestly, If Lucho asked for Pogba I wouldn't mind dealing out the $$ to get him.    If Turan, let's assume he'll take Iniesta's spot. do you think that a 29 years old Turan would be a big upgrade over a 31 years old Iniesta?   I don't get to watch Atleti that much but this is just a question of how highly you rate Turan. A lot of people would say he has been better than Iniesta over the past 2 years, doesn't seem too unreasonable to be honest."

Buying Pogba (and we really don't know what went/is going on with that) would hardly make Barcelona into Real Madrid or Chelsea.

That's irrelevant since I'm saying that we should give him a chance at Barça and see if he fits our system.   Barca is a team that needs to win trophies. You can't give chances at the first team to all midfielders with potential, otherwise we would be Barca B. Right bow Rafinha is having his chances, the only way other midfielders can showcase their talents in the same season is at another team.

Obviously both are important but it's extremely difficult to have both at the same time. Under Guardiola it was the first time in the club's history that we managed to play with 11 home-grown players (and that was because Alves was injured). To accomplish that, a lot of things had to be aligned: a board that supported La Masía, a manager who understood what being a canterano meant, great results to blindly trust the manager and trusted them (at his own risk), a golden generation of players, and even 'external' players that were either aging, not wanted by the manager or not good enough.  To have all those variables aligned is extremely difficult and very few teams in history have managed to do that.  But remember, first and foremost, this is football and the club is here to win trophies. If you want to follow a team that has a lot of 'soul', go follow Athletic Bilbao or Ajax right now, only good luck with winning major trophies. If you want a team that wins trophies but has little soul, start following PSG or Manchester City or Chelsea.  What we want is to find an optimal balance between both and that implies that sometimes we'll have to sacrifice some players from La Masía and other times we'll have to pass on great players.  In the end, both variables are cyclical. It's awesome when we can maximize both (trophies and soul), but remember that they can also be minimized (see late 90's early 2000's Barça).  Still, if we sign both, Turan and Pogba, the team's leader will still be Piqué, Busquets, Messi, Iniesta (for a while), and they'll continue to be for at least 5 more years. Plenty of time to wait for a new generation of players to arise (Bartra, Samper, Halilovic?, Rafinha?, and others)."
Barca,3bvq50,astral_cowboy,3,Thu Jul 2 19:39:57 2015 UTC,"Buying and selling players is part of modern football. The fact that Barcelona were able to win trophies while not having to depend on buying off stars from other teams really shows how special of an era it was. The problem is it's created amazing expectations that Barcelona can keep pumping out future football legends from La Masia every 3-4 years. The reality is, IMO, Barcelona is a lucky club to have the talent they had come up at the same time. That's not a knock on the club, it's just the truth that players of Iniesta's caliber, or of Xavi's caliber, or Messi to come up all at the same time from the same club and play the prime of their years together is an extremely rare thing. The stars have to somehow perfectly align, and alas we saw what happens when they do."

Laporta's era had more soul than the Rosell/Bartomeu, but it was still a business, still corrupt, still had many questionable things. If you really choose entirely morally sound decisions over success, then that's what Barça would be, like Athletic Bilbao but in Catalunya.  I'm American. The vast majority of the people on this sub aren't Catalan. I know you aren't, Navid.

Not because of trophies, which weren't as frequent back then as it became after 2008. Different than so many other clubs. I definitely felt like it stood out amongst all the other big clubs. I kinda feel like the soul of the club makes us all feel like Catalans inside who sees Barça as a national team for our values and as our ambassadors around the world.

It's probably just a lull on my behalf, but there's so much wrong with the mood around our club (I hate politics in football, and I can't help but cringe when I see ""Qatar ____"" paraded by our players). Obviously a win makes me forget all for a few hours (or more if it's a big game) and just puts me in a good mood because I'm a hypocrite like that, but a Barcelona win definitely used to mean more to me.  Sorry if this came across as overly negative, but that's how I'd explain a soul-less trophy. That said, Barcelona is far from soul-less. We've lost a lot of what we used to have not long ago, but if I look at other top clubs in Europe, they're far worse in that regard (....Real Madrid)."

They do well domestically, but don't have the star power to compete in Europe. I think the amount of great players coming from elsewhere around the world makes it impossible to stick to that type of plan.

FC Barcelona have, historically, been a huge symbol of Catalunya and continue to pride themselves still. ""Visca Barca, Visca Catalunya"" is often heard in celebrations. I don't even know if any other club in the world so often refers and remembers their region/city as often as our club does.   It is a club that not only encompasses soccer, but many other sporting disciplines as well (of which football and basketball are the best known, but they have a lot of success in other disciplines as well).  Furthermore, in the club's modern history, the football team has aligned itself with the idea of attacking football -not just for entertainment- but because they are convinced (and this is something we need to struggle to maintain, since it is not easy) that it is the best way to find good results.  Together with attacking football, homegrown talent has been another major focus for the club, both to prepare the players better for Barcelona's unique style, connect better to the fans, as well as limit some of the transfer spending.   All of this, and many other little and not-so-little things, are what makes up the identity of FC Barcelona.   For me, definitely soul over trophies.

Barca,3bs5kv,Marchisio,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:06:16 2015 UTC,"Okay fair enough. It sounded like you were blaming the coach, but I understand now."
Barca,3bs5kv,kontrolk3,3,Thu Jul 2 00:25:00 2015 UTC,"Alves was far from playing well in Tito's season and especially Tata's season. Montoya then barely got a chance, eventhough in Tito's season he played at quite a good level.   After Pep left, there never seemed to be any intention to develop Montoya into a player worthy of starting for Barça. A lot of people seem to expect that players coming through La Masia should immediately be at the level of the first team players; which is ridiculous - it's an investment."

Barca,3bs5kv,HippoNigga,2,Thu Jul 2 08:52:46 2015 UTC,"Well besides this Junta Gestora still making transfer decisions, this is a good move for Montoya."
Barca,3bs5kv,IhateAngryBirds,-7,Thu Jul 2 03:22:03 2015 UTC,I was really hoping for Alves to leave so he could stay. IMO he has always been good enough to be in the squad.
Barca,3bs5kv,G_O_,15,Thu Jul 2 07:56:01 2015 UTC,he's good but to want him to replace Alves is absolute lunacy
Barca,3bs5kv,T_Peg,-4,Thu Jul 2 00:28:38 2015 UTC,"i think a lot of people forget that alves isn't that good of a defender. he has a good tackle here and there. montoya was better, but he lacked the ability to work well with messi. but this season i saw that messi did not need alves as much as previous seasons. hopefully montoya can improve and show his worth"
Barca,3bs5kv,G_O_,13,Thu Jul 2 01:03:22 2015 UTC,"but this season i saw that messi did not need alves as much as previous seasons.   Messi and Alves' connection was the best it's been since like 2011, what on Earth are you talking about?"
Barca,3bs5kv,egcg119,-3,Thu Jul 2 01:57:28 2015 UTC,I'm not saying they didn't connect. I'm saying that the combination Messi-Alves want that depended on. Messi connected better with the midfield.
Barca,3bs5kv,G_O_,6,Thu Jul 2 02:08:53 2015 UTC,Alves' role this season was pretty much to be an extra man in midfield (opposed to continually overlap); he was absolutely vital to that midfield-Messi connection.

Barca,3bs5kv,G_O_,4,Thu Jul 2 04:29:48 2015 UTC,"Montoya underrated - A bit, yes.  Alves overrated - I found him pretty convincing and downright enjoyed his performances after almost a season or two. Why do you feel like this about him?"
Barca,3bs5kv,prateekdwivedi1,0,Thu Jul 2 05:33:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that Alves is a big help when attacking. The main thing that bothers me is his defending.

Also we (r/barca) are in no way affected by this drama compared to the other subs that hava AMAs.  Generally we keep politics and subredditdrama out of r/barca."

Barca,3byint,vanNostrandby,2,Fri Jul 3 05:12:48 2015 UTC,The mods of other subreddits are basically doing this cuz Victoria was apparently their only mode of communication if they wanted to contact the admins. This was basically useful for AMAs and stuff.(when something went wrong she fixed it immediately and made sure the AMAs were legit) Moreover they're complaining about how the mod tools suck and the management is doing nothing about it. So as a form of protest and to force the admins to work on these issues they're making the subreddits private.
Barca,3byint,vanNostrandby,3,Fri Jul 3 05:40:59 2015 UTC,"I realize that, that's all in the backstory OP provided. What I was interested in was how this protest would help and OP has now answered that one too."

By putting this sub private I hope we can help send a message against the actions of the Reddit admins.  Edit: a word  Edit #2: another word"

Having said that, it is clear that we must trust them to do what they believe is best for this community, even if I disagree with their viewpoint - after all, they're the same ones that have made this treble winning season so enjoyable for every single one of us on this subreddit.

Barca,3byint,svefnpurka,2,Fri Jul 3 13:34:42 2015 UTC,The subreddit was banned because of harassing people and they took it as reddit limiting their free speech and people rioted.

Barca,3byint,arab241,7,Fri Jul 3 06:15:04 2015 UTC,I'm with you 100%. But I think that's also kinda why Reddit gets away with some shitty things - we've no where else to go!
Barca,3byint,brocccoli,0,Fri Jul 3 06:37:57 2015 UTC,"Bingo, this is exactly why. You can state how you'd like to stay away from this drama (we all do), but our inaction is what allows this kind of stuff to happen without consequence."
Barca,3byint,egcg119,-2,Fri Jul 3 06:42:14 2015 UTC,"I understand that sentiment as I mentioned before but if we don't act, who's to say that more of our freedoms/rights won't be violated in terms of free speech on this website, especially considering the events with r/fatpeoplehate? In my opinion this action is about principle, as much as I love this club. We can't Reddit become a shell of itself without a fight."
Barca,3byint,svefnpurka,6,Fri Jul 3 06:40:28 2015 UTC,"Is it a violation of rights though? Reddit is a company run internet forum which doesn't even claim to be a free speech environment even if that's something its users support. Sure, the users can let themselves be heard but ""losing free speech"" in reddit is about much of a rights violation as McDonald's removing one of their hamburgers from the menu. Or am I missing something here?  I do support the notion though, in the sense that I think reddit would be a better site with free speech."
Barca,3byint,invice,2,Fri Jul 3 12:43:40 2015 UTC,"It isn't a violation of anybody's free speech, correct. And I'm not too worked up about website policies but  there is something to be said for holding corporations to a standard that doesn't allow them to do things that would have a chilling effect on speech."
Barca,3byint,HippoNigga,2,Fri Jul 3 13:08:34 2015 UTC,"What free speech though?  It's their webpage, they can decide what goes on it."

Measures like this can, can, have a chilling effect on speech because websites like reddit are of cultural significance.  It brings people into contact with other ideas, language, content.  If your policy is to begin restricting what kind of ideas, language, content is on the site then it may discourage people from engaging in said things.  Maybe this is a good thing, maybe it isn't.  Again though, I don't really care."

As far as I'm concerned, the people who do AMA's have a right to be upset, nobody else does. She's an employee, she got fired, it was handled shittily. That happens all the time. It's not a disaster, it's not a ""free speech"" or ""rights"" issue - I don't know how you got that - and it's not something we have any business being part of.   Besides, where would we go to discuss our bullshit transfer rumors?"

Barca,3bszaw,DivineVibrations,2,Thu Jul 2 12:45:14 2015 UTC,It's really surprising that more people aren't excited about this signing.
Barca,3bszaw,_sic,0,Thu Jul 2 20:22:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe because they don't have a clear picture on how fucking good Arda actually is...  In my opinion, I think he would be a better signing than Pogba."
Barca,3bszaw,Cambijao,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:48:58 2015 UTC,"In the short term, I agree. But over the long term Pogba's upside is much higher than Arda's, who is already at his peak and won't get any better. But yeah, for the next 2 years I'm hard pressed to think of a player who would be a better signing than Arda."
Barca,3bszaw,_sic,0,Sun Jul 5 08:22:08 2015 UTC,"There's no doubt that Pogba's a good player but he hasn't justify his price tag which is €80M. And the young Frenchman doesn't fit in Lucho's system where players must have work rate to contribute in both directions (offensive and defence), something Pogba lacks.   One of the biggest reasons why Barca manage to win the treble was because that Lucho made a lot of rotations and if Pogba comes, then he won't be benched no matter what given to his ridiciolus price tag.  I don't believe the age-argument. For an example, Pirlo is still a very good mitfielder and he's 36. Lampard made world class performances even though he was 34. And Zidane played his best football when he was 30+. And I haven't even mentioned Villa & Henry who both were 29 when they came to Barca and I don't think no one on this sub would regard them as flops..."
Barca,3bszaw,Cambijao,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:44:16 2015 UTC,"Well the counter-argument to your comment about age would be to list the millions of players who faded as they reached their 30s. There are some outliers, like Zanetti, but 99% of professional athletes are in their prime before they hit 30. That's not to say they instantly suck when they hit a certain age, it's just that the probabilities of bodies breaking down increase significantly as you age. Unfortunately, I can attest to this in my personal experience :("
Barca,3bszaw,_sic,0,Mon Jul 6 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"You have a fair point that players are declining when they hit 30 but I think most of them are those who heavily relied on pace at their peak, something it can't be said about Arda since he isn't exactly known for being super fast.  However, Arda deeply relies on game intelligence and that's why I think the Turk will still perform even when he's 30+"
Barca,3bszaw,Cambijao,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:00:10 2015 UTC,"Idk, a lot of people are complaining about the lack of youth and some how is forgotten with the arda turan inquiry.

Barca,3bszaw,A_Kind_Shark,14,Thu Jul 2 11:22:44 2015 UTC,Why are so many people thinking Isco is a option? It's impossible.
Barca,3bszaw,flackohowyoubeen,5,Thu Jul 2 11:24:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe. But he is openly a Barca fan. He even named his dog after Messi. Also, Isco has the potential to be the next Iniesta. His dribbling, among other skills, combined with his work rate and consistency makes him an incredible player and a good addition to any team. Besides, Isco is extremely popular everywhere in Spain, so if by some miracle this transfer would happen, it wouldn't be a Luis Figo-type situation."
Barca,3bszaw,A_Kind_Shark,7,Thu Jul 2 01:02:15 2015 UTC,"It is funny to think that the same summer we lost Thiago to Bayern, we also let Isco join Real Madrid."

Barca,3bszaw,domi_28,12,Thu Jul 2 12:27:25 2015 UTC,"I'm down with buying Arda this summer. In fact, I'd be thrilled at €35m. I'm also not against buying Pogba for €80m in 2016, because he's already good but has incredible potential, like Neymar. Luis Enrique is a good judge of players and Arda is one of the players he asked for, I'm assuming that he also asked for Pogba and I suspect both will be signed.   Is that too many midfielders? Maybe. I think with all the running the mids have to do in this system, it's good to be able to rotate with high quality players. Don't forget that Xavi is gone and everyone has to face the fact that at 31 (32 by the time Pogba joins) Iniesta is fading. I don't think he'll be able to give us 90 min a match over the next 2-3 years. Just like Xavi, he'll increasingly be used as a tactical piece off the bench. Besides, all the mids will be susceptible to injuries in this kind of high intensity system, Iniesta more than the rest, due to age and general fragility. So in that sense I think there would be plenty of minutes for Arda/Pogba and Rafinha/Roberto/Samper.  Will it block La Masía talent? Maybe, but those talented youngsters have to step up and prove their worth. Rafinha has no competition as the 4th mid until Christmas to prove his potential, that's nearly 1.5 seasons with the first team, plenty of time to evaluate him. I think he's good enough, and versatile enough to   find a place on the squad even if we sign both Arda and Pogba.  Last season Sergi Roberto made some strides to carving out a place on the squad with his matches at the pivot, his main competition to be backup will be Samper. I like that those two young  Masía mids can fight it out for a squad spot there. In the end, probably only one will stick.  Denis Suarez is going to have a tough time making the squad since he can't come back until 2016. He looks like a fine player, but honestly, I can't see him beating out Rafinha, Arda or Pogba as an attacking mid and I don't see him converting to the pivot or wing.   So a possible 2016-17 midfield will look like this  (starter - backups)  Busquets (DM) - Roberto or Samper/Mascherano- maybe Arda at pivot as well  Rakitic (LM) - Iniesta/Arda/Rafinha  Pogba (RM) -Arda/Rakitic/Rafinha  That's 6-7 high quality players for 3 spots. If you look at the squad over the next 3 years, I don't think that's too many because 3 are older (Iniesta, Mascerhano and Arda) 1 will be ""in his prime"" (Busquets) and 3 will be young (Pogba, Rafinha, Roberto or Samper) . Most of them are versatile and will be able to play in different positions to cover any injuries. Honestly the above midfield behind a stacked trident (we will probably have to buy a replacement for Pedro) will make this team even formidable for years to come."
Barca,3bszaw,_sic,4,Sun Jul 5 08:23:53 2015 UTC,Pogba (RM) -Arda/Rakitic/Rafinha   Why Pogba over Arda?
Barca,3bszaw,Cambijao,3,Fri Jul 3 16:11:23 2015 UTC,Because he's already a superior player and will only continue to improve.
Barca,3bszaw,broad_h2o,3,Thu Jul 2 12:19:29 2015 UTC,"It's all about the salary for me. If we can get Arda on 75000 a week (Rakitic money) then I'm all for it, anymore would be counterproductive.   As far as Pogba, I don't think he should earn more than 130000 a week(Xavi, Iniesta money), although it's unlikely consider we are paying Neymar 150000 and Suarez 200000."

Barca,3bszaw,domi_28,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:33:26 2015 UTC,"Iniesta is still great and still plays near his best in big matches when he's healthy and he has been one of the greatest attacking midfielders of all time. But at 31 he no longer is dominant throughout an entire season. That was clear this season, where for the first half he was nowhere near his best, and last season, and the one before that. Anybody who ""watches football"" or has watched Iniesta himself can see that plain as day. And if you think that at age 33, when theoretically Pogba could be signed, he'll still be playing anywhere near his peak, you are incredibly optimistic. It's more likely that much like Xavi, another player who was never known as a physical dynamo, his body will keep slowing down and he'll only be really effective playing limited minutes.   This is just the way professional sports is. No matter how great the player, age eventually catches up. Otherwise we would still be starting Xavi, hell, Maradona's fat ass would still be creating magic on the pitch. The team would be making a grave error not to plan for Iniesta's inevitable decline."
Barca,3bszaw,_sic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:12:12 2015 UTC,"I do understand the importance of being Proactive with transfers, and yes, Iniesta will probably be a sub in 2 seasons. But, if we were to sign the most expensive player to replace a veteran every year we would have never had iniesta or xavi (we would probably be talking about how amazingly above average were viera and mikelele) I think by the time Iniesta can't earn a starting spot we could already have a La masia replacement for him, weather its Rafinha, Suarez or Halilovic."
Barca,3bszaw,domi_28,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:47:45 2015 UTC,"But, if we were to sign the most expensive player to replace a veteran every year we would have never had iniesta or xavi   But we don't do that. Regardless, a player with the potential of Pogba doesn't appear on the market every season and Barça has always tried to sign the best players in the world. This is not something new. Rafinha will have to fight for his place in Barça, but he always knew that.   And I'd also like to point out that neither Suarez or Halilovic are La Masía players. They both played exactly one (mediocre in the case of the Croat) season in Barça B. They aren't exactly following in the footsteps of Guardiola, Xavi and Iniesta, who were raised in La Masía."
Barca,3bszaw,_sic,15,Mon Jul 6 17:30:50 2015 UTC,"I was very surprised at a lot of people's reactions to the Turan rumors. He's an absolutely wonderful player and my favorite non-Barça player in the world. Yeah, he's hot headed but I like the fact that he's passionate. I also think a lot of the aggressiveness that he plays with is a product of Simeone's system, he'd tone it back if he were to come here.  Watch some of the Madrid derbies that Atletico played this past year, in particular the 4-0. Arda is amazing to watch, I'd take him over Pogba without a second's hesitation."
Barca,3bszaw,Epsilon76,46,Mon Jul 6 18:05:30 2015 UTC,"He'll also be 29 by the time he can play, and cost near €40m. He has very little resell value, is fairly inconsistent, and has a bad temper. I can't see past him being a waste of money."
Barca,3bszaw,Aj16ay,10,Mon Jul 6 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"He has very little resell value   Since when has Barça cared about resale value? We have never operated like Arsenal or Porto. If he gives us 2 good seasons, worth every euro of the €35m he's reported to cost."

Barca,3bszaw,Cambijao,4,Thu Jul 2 15:35:53 2015 UTC,"29 means that he won't interfere with Masia players development, and 40M euros is honestly not that much in today's market, especially for a player as talented as Turan. Atletico as a whole were inconsistent last year, in a system like Barca's I think Arda would be a great addition"
Barca,3bszaw,aleks19998,19,Wed Jul 1 23:07:44 2015 UTC,Arda isn't an upgrade over anyone in the starting XI. €40m is still a lot when it could pay Óliver Torres release clause with some to spare
Barca,3bszaw,Aj16ay,10,Thu Jul 2 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"Buying Oliver would be like getting another Rafinha into the squad though. The reason we're buying Turan, is to have an experienced player ready. I'm not saying he'll be benched. Because if he comes, he'll alot. I reckon Iniesta will play less than ever this season.  If Rakitic or Iniesta is out, the coach and team will feel safer knowing you have at least have an great experienced player like Turan, instead of a young player that's still developing."

Barca,3bszaw,_sic,-4,Thu Jul 2 05:18:32 2015 UTC,"Me too. Turan over Pogba any day. He's better and definitely a better fit in this team, but it's also kind of good that he's old (as crazy as it may sound), because it won't demotivate our talents (Rafinha etc.) like the way getting Pogba would do.   If we get Pogba, a 90m, 12m a year player, there's no way he'll be benched and heavily rotated. But you can do that with Turan. Turan is also versatile, can play CAM, LW and RW.  Turan knows the league, he's experienced, and I reckon he'll have very few problems adapting. He's not very expensive, and he will not be on crazy wages. It's for the better for the talents, and the club."
Barca,3bszaw,flackohowyoubeen,3,Thu Jul 2 08:07:58 2015 UTC,My main gripe is his age and his price in relation to that.

Barca,3bszaw,vanNostrandby,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:41:19 2015 UTC,"He's not that old. He's 3 years younger than Iniesta. If we get 2 good seasons out of him, it will be worth it. 3 good seasons and it will be a steal.   Replacing him is not an issue, we have very young midfielders coming up in Rafinha, Samper, Denis Suarez and possibly Pogba."
Barca,3bszaw,_sic,8,Thu Jul 2 11:44:26 2015 UTC,Turan will work his ass of if we sign him. You can be sure. He will be the midfielder Suarez. I'm a Gala fan and i watch  him since he was 18. He is a good back-up and probably a nice replacement for iniesta.
Barca,3bszaw,luisuarez7,5,Thu Jul 2 11:49:07 2015 UTC,"No one doubts Arda Turan's ability, it's just the fact that this signing is just a political move by Bartomeu that's annoying."

Barca,3bs7so,Android-21,40,Wed Jul 1 18:51:33 2015 UTC,"Here are my two cents:   The interim board isn't independent nor a puppet. We should get to the bottom of this and know what are their full responsibilities. My guess is that Luis Enrique asked for Turan and one of the responsibilities of the board was to specifically close this signing before the beginning of the season (I would be unsure why, but at least it will put an end to all the rumors and speculation). As stated above, it seems that Luis Enrique specifically asked for him. If that's the case, he deserves to bring in whoever he wants, just like Guardiola tossed Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Deco, and Ibrahivmovic in two years. He earned it and he's probably seeing something that we aren't. Turan will most likely be Xavi's replacement during this season (or half of it), while Rafinha will be Iniesta's (most likely, unless there are further changes).  For the reason stated above, Turan will fight with Rakitic for a spot, and it won't be an easy fight. ""Una competencia feroz"", as someone said. That's what we wanted and what we needed, and that's what we're getting. Turan might also be used as a Suárez sub in later stages of the game when Messi drops deep and Suárez is wide open. Pedro (if he doesn't leave, but if he does, then Rafinha) will sub Neymar and in some cases Suárez as well (the Rafinha part doesn't apply here). Samper should definitely be loaned out. If I was Sergi Roberto, I'd start looking for a team ASAP. This will be a long and hard season. Both, Madrid and Atlético will bring out all their guns against us. The CL doesn't look easier; if Madrid, Atlético, Chelsea, PSG, and Bayern were serious contenders, we'll now have to add Juve and Man U, if not the other English teams as well. Turan will come in very handy for the later stages of the next season. I only expect Adriano, Roberto, and probably Pedro to leave the team this season (aside from Xavi, Montoya, and Deulofeu). Provided that this is true, we have a very scary squad.   Bravo / Ter Stegen / Masip Alves/Vidal Alba/Grimaldolikely /Mathieu Piqué, Vermaelen, Bartra, Mathieu, Mascherano Busquets / Mascherano Rakitic / Turan Iniesta / Rafinha Messi / Suárez / Neymar / Pedro / Rafinha / Turan  It's clear that Luis Enrique isn't here to be successful, he's here to create a dynasty."
Barca,3bs7so,astral_cowboy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:09:41 2015 UTC,"Playing as a sub is definitely a possibility, but I'm not sure if this is the ideal season to do that, considering that Vermaelen is back and Mascherano might see more games as a DM and we still have Sergi Roberto.   But if one major improvement that his squad can undergo is the signing of an orchestrator.   Sure, Kovacic, Gundogan, and Koke would be more Xavi-like replacements. The thing is, we don't need a Xavi-like player right now. Those responsibilities will have to be taken by Busquets and probably Messi and Raki will add some to it as well.  I agree with the rest of what you said. Turan can add more versatility up front and could compliment Rakitic."
Barca,3bs7so,astral_cowboy,2,Thu Jul 2 05:34:00 2015 UTC,"turans gonna fight for iniesta spot, and sooner or later win.  im not even aligned with those who think iniesta had a mediocre season (im actually of the opinion he had a good one, well adapted to a completely new role), i think barcelonas midfield needs gritty workhorses to the sides - essentially covering, distributing, and eventually penetrating - and rakitic is already cemented on the right, and deservedly so; turans gonna be his mirror on the left."
Barca,3bs7so,cea2015,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:19:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Things will get interesting with Turan competing for 2 or 3 spots (LMF, RMF, RW)."

Like I said before, If we want a midfielder who wil cover miles and do defensive work then Rakitic is a better option. And if we want a technician who is offensive minded and great at associative play then Iniesta is better than him.  Where will he fit in? As a sub? Why not just keep giving Rafinha playing time?. Even worse when we are going for Pogba who plays in the same  position..."
Barca,3bs7so,tadm123,2,Wed Jul 1 20:29:17 2015 UTC,"He very rarely played in the centre for Atleti, he's more of a wide midfielder. If he comes, I think he'll be a backup for our wide forwards & Iniesta."
Barca,3bs7so,NotSoFastMister,4,Wed Jul 1 20:42:28 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I can see him as a sub for Iniesta. It's a pretty expensive sub though to buy someone like Arda.. I'd much rather prefer to keep developing Rafinha in that position.  I don't know about a sub for our forwards though. We just renewed Pedro and he was pretty much our '4th' choice forward with little playing time these past season. To have him as a 5th forward with Turan being ahead of him now would make me feel bad for him."
Barca,3bs7so,tadm123,2,Wed Jul 1 21:28:59 2015 UTC,"Don't think Pedro's renewal means he's not for sale this summer (or in January). If a good offer comes, Barca will probably sell him & I think he himself wants more playing time, especially before the summer EURO tournament.  And I'm not sure what will happen to Rafinha if this move goes through. Arda's probably going to be his direct rival for minutes in the AM & wide forward positions. He will have to impress in Rakitic' CM role or I don't think he'll last past the next summer."

People in South America (generalizing) tend to be more relaxed with regards to verbal manifestations of racism (as in, we don't usually have a racist context for some of the traditional racist words).

When our players do stupid things, I will criticize them accordingly (as I have for Alba, who for all his great play can piss the hell out of me every once in a while)   I was just saying that you shouldn't mock him for being hot-headed since you've some players in your team who aren't any better than Arda.    I'm not going to hate the guy from day 1, and as soon as he is wearing our shirt I'll support him, but (IMO) he will have a lot less rope than other signings.    Out of curiosity, have you done the same with Suárez when he came to Barca?   Aside, as someone else pointed out, the 'negro' thing is probably not racist-related. People in South America (generalizing) tend to be more relaxed with regards to verbal manifestations of racism (as in, we don't usually have a racist context for some of the traditional racist words).

Wasn't my intention to mock him, but I can see how my comments can be interpreted that way. Merely expressing concern at a player who won't bring a calming influence to our team (in general I much rather have calmer Messi-Xavi type players than Alba-Neymar).   Out of curiosity, have you done the same with Suárez when he came to Barca?   Yep. His handball during 2010 I thought was justified and I don't mind it, but his bites made me really nervous about the purchase. He's been on his best behavior with us (minus a dive or two).   I don't like to repeat myself so I'll a comment I said earlier... https://www.reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/3bs7so/bar%C3%A7a_signs_arda_turan_spanish/csp5pss?context=3   I disagree with that comment, but I don't think there's any point in beating the subject further."
Barca,3bs7so,ManoloBar,3,Thu Jul 2 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"Let's not discuss about when Alba kicked a player who was down.   Assuming we're talking about the same incident, he was going for the ball. It was certainly stupid and worthy of a booking, but he wasn't being malicious or trying to cause injury. Not exactly the same thing as throwing a shoe at a linesman. There's really no mistaking the intent there. :)   Or Suárez when he bit three players and what he said to Evra.    None of these incidents happened when he was wearing a Barcelona shirt, so I'm not sure I understand why you think they're relevant. His behavior has been very good since signing for us.  It seems like you're reaching really hard to find evidence that Barcelona is no better than Atlético when it comes to dirty play, but that evidence doesn't really exist because it's not true. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of both teams could tell you that. The only player we have who's really problematic in that regard is Alba. On Atlético it's practically the whole squad."

I'm not saying that Atleti are flawless but to point out that the whole squad are assholes, you don't mind if you can prove it?

Barca,3bs7so,BarcaChaldo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:52:27 2015 UTC,"You described Real Madrid not Barca. We are the team who brings up players from its academy and trusts in them after years of hard work and aspirations. Sure, 40+ Million can get you a 29 year old midfielder, but it won't bring you another lasting legacy like Xavi or Iniesta."
Barca,3bs7so,_sic,3,Thu Jul 2 02:00:02 2015 UTC,"Henry, Villa, Deco, Ibra ring a bell?  Hell, Cruyff, Romario, Rivaldo, Mardona, Stoichkov..."
Barca,3bs7so,BarcaChaldo,0,Thu Jul 2 07:30:17 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your point. I associate different teams with most of these players when they are mentioned. Henry, Ibra or Maradona are not Barca products or even legends. They played here, yes but their legacy is with different teams.   What is separating us from Chelsea or RM at this point? Buying players should happen only when your academy cannot provide them. Tello and Cuenca were terrible/injury-prone so we brought on Neymar and Sanchez. The academy did not provide a good number 9 so we got Suarez. But our midfield! We have the most promising talents in our midfield and we end up throwing it all away."
Barca,3bs7so,_sic,2,Thu Jul 2 12:58:12 2015 UTC,"The point is that Barça has always bought big name players for short term gains. Even under Pep. It's impossible to be consistently successful by only relying on academy players. The fact that we mix academy players with big name buys separates us somewhat from most big clubs, but don't try and pretend that we don't buy big players. Laporta bought Villa, Ibra, Deco and Henry, for instance. The current board bought Neymar and Suarez. We always have, we always will.   Right now the only academy midfielders who are good enough to start someday for Barça are Rafinha and maybe Samper. Look for my other comment on here to see how I think they are not incompatible with these signings. Roberto could be a good squad player, Denis Suarez might be a decent player, but spending one season on the B team doesn't exactly make him a La Masía player and he's nowhere near the talent of Arda or Pogba. Not today, and probably not ever."
Barca,3bs7so,HippoNigga,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:59:36 2015 UTC,"Teams know that we're desperate for top midfielders and that we have money, so they hardball us and we usually give in."
Barca,3bs7so,Blanchimont,6,Thu Jul 2 13:05:46 2015 UTC,"Goddamnit. Why would Barça sign Arda? He's a great player, but he costs somewhere around 40 million euro's. That's too much for a player we don't need, who only serves as an addition to our squad depth. It's almost guaranteed we'll have Pogba coming in somewhere in January or next summer, we've still got Iniesta, Busi, Rakitic , Rafinha and Sergi Roberto, and guys like Denis Suarez and Sergi Samper deserve a shot at first team glory as well. Masche can play midfield if needed, and as things currently stand we also haven't sold Alex Song yet. I don't rate Arda higher than Iniesta, I don't rate him higher than Busquets and I don't rate him higher than Rakitic. And for the few matches one of them can't play, our current options will suffice."
Barca,3bs7so,Cambijao,2,Thu Jul 2 15:05:26 2015 UTC,"Lol. €40M is nothing considering that Arda's one of the aboslut best players in the world. And keep in mind the transfer sums in general are far higher compared to how it was for 10 years ago...  Why should Barca give positive discrimination to Denis Suarez or Sergi Samper just because they're from Barca B? If they're not good enough to be a starter for the line-up, then they should just sit on the bench or leave Barca. Simple as that.  You're heavily underrestimaing Arda, I doubt you haven't even folowed his games for Atleti agianst teams that is not Barca or Madrid..."
Barca,3bs7so,_sic,3,Thu Jul 2 03:21:16 2015 UTC,"Apparently LE wanted a new mid signed before the preseason and he handed in a list of 4 names. The second name was Arda Turan. I think Enrique has proven that he knows what he's doing when he picks players (Suarez, Rakitic, Mathieu), so I'm happy with the signing.  Besides, even I can see that Arda would be fucking great for our squad."
Barca,3bs7so,JurijFedorov,2,Wed Jul 1 21:13:43 2015 UTC,But he is not Spanish! So it can't be him.  And isn't he a bit to old to splash money on? 30-35 millions for him is a lot of money.

If we want a midfielder who will sacrifice defensively and will cover a lot of miles, then Rakitic is a lot better than Arda Turan.

But that's not the whole story, there has also been a loss of values. Such as with 'La Masia'. Barça has also run away with the world championship for tweets about legal issues and that cannot be. We need to get serious"", the Dutchman stressed.      ""When Barcelona was doing badly, there were two decisions made that had a significant impact on the way they played and thought, and those were the signings of Rijkaard and Guardiola. Both spent eight years at the helm of the first team, developing a project in which 'La Masia' was the magic word and that is now no longer the case"", he went on. Values: ""Values are fundamental, not only in elections, but in life, and Barça have lost sight of them"".      ""Everyone is delighted with how Barcelona are playing but there are fewer and fewer people from 'La Masia'. Signing, anyone can sign. One thing is how well the first team are working and another is how well the club is working. They are two very different things. The first team has won everything and the second, in contrast, has been relegated. That's a problem"", Johan Cruyff said."
Barca,3bs84o,darthvader7888,16,Wed Jul 1 19:04:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not denying that the state of La Masia atm sucks and I do believe it needs to be improved but we won't always be able to get a full team of stars from La Masia. Xavi, Iniesta, Messi etc were a once in a lifetime generation.   Again, I'm not satisfied with the state La Masia's in (no one from there has really amounted to much since Thiago) but we need to be realistic. We're always gonna have to buy star talent. Every big club does. Even our 2009 team had the likes of Eto'o, Henry, Alves, etc."

Barca,3bs84o,Football_Enthusiast,5,Thu Jul 2 08:48:54 2015 UTC,We can't afford to let this go anymore. I hope the new board will make significant improvement to La Masia so that once again La Masia can generate top rated players for Barça. Yes I agree Cruyff should be brought by Barça for their own good. I know Cruyff had personal conflict with Rosell and I don't know whether Cruyff can tolerate Bartomeu or not; but if Laporta gets elected then hopefully Cruyff will be involved with Barça and La Masia I think.
Barca,3bs84o,Rhayadder,4,Wed Jul 1 22:26:55 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with Cruyff. Main reason being we have a Messi in his absolute prime and the best attacking force in the history of football. Now is not the time to invest in potential long term prospects, we have to get the absolute best for every position on the field to complement our attack and make sure we win the maximum amount of trophies (especially CL) possible before Messi & Co retire."
Barca,3bs84o,Melobyrro,3,Fri Jul 3 01:09:04 2015 UTC,"Imo there is very little upside, the law should change and we should be allowed to give professional contracts to these 16,17,18yo so they can't leave  How often we invest in a player and English clubs take them?

Xavi wasnt the undisputed best CM in the world until Guardiola came into the picture, and same goes for iniesta etc. It does no justice to say that players like samper or suarez should not be used instead of pogba simply because unlike them Pogba was actually given the chance to play and showed his worth.

Granted the FIFA ban hurt La Masia a lot more than it's hurt the first team and this is something that is slightly overlooked. Some of the top talents have been forced to leave, and our practice of signing top 15-16 year olds from other spanish clubs has ceased. Many people complain that we shouldn't buy Pogba or Arda because we need to give more opportunities to our home grown products and I agree with that. However, I don't think this current crop of players have the talent to play with Barca. Denis Suarez played well with Sevilla, but he wasn't crucial to them, he often was on the bench, how's he supposed to discourage us from buying Pogba?? Halilovic is the only one I really want to make space for. Samper played really well and I'd like to give him more chances, but what bench Masche and Busquets? It's tough, Barcelona just hasn't produced top level talents in a while and it's become difficult to try and justify sub-top level players playing with our first team.  The last outright top level talent to come out of La Masia was Busquets, since then none of them really deserve to be starters on the world's BEST team."

Barca,3brayh,bitjpl0x,36,Wed Jul 1 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"If Pogba is coming, it's much better to have it next summer than this Winter.  We don't necessarily disrupt the midfield that just won us the treble, all while giving Rafinha more minutes, an argument can be made for Samper as well.  After this season, Iniesta will have more trouble playing as consistently and Pogba won't necessarily be forced to dump him from his starting position.   The only issue I see is that Denis Suarez will have a very hard time getting minutes, as well as Halilovic if he's around. In the end, we can't put all of our eggs in our La Masia basket. It's good to give them chances, which some will get, but if worst were to come to worst and none of Rafinha, Samper and Denis could handle it, we would be screwed..."
Barca,3brayh,Marchisio,12,Wed Jul 1 15:41:58 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. If he comes, next summer is best.  Not trying to start an argument--more of a conversation--but which of our 5 youth prospects do you really see succeeding and having a future with the team? We've got Samper, Rafinha, Denis Suarez, Halilovic, and Sergi Roberto.   In my opinion, Pogba can cover what all of these players seem more specialized to do. He can play in more of a holding role like Samper (or more recently Roberto). He can play an attacking role like Rafinha, Suarez or Halilovic. He has an amazing shot and he's got at least 3 inches on all of them. And he's roughly the same age. I think what is going to end up happening is that our midfield will be similar to what it was for the 2006 CL Final. In 3-4 seasons, we're going to have several midfielders, but only 2-3 of them will have come through Barca B. At this point, I'm not really sure which 2-3 they will be beyond Busi.   Samper: How will he be able to work into the senior side over the next few years? If he plays more of a holding role like Busi, he's going to have competition from Masch as well--that's assuming that Vermaelen being healthy means Masch will rotate into the midfield more. But Busi is one of the captains and he's only 26. So Samper truly won't have a place in the squad for another 3 seasons at minimum. I know that he's promising, but I don't think we need to worry about him for at least another 2-3 years. A loan for him should probably be considered.  Sergi Roberto: Although a lot of people don't see him having a future with the club, he plays a lot like Rakitic. He works and works and works, and now that we won't have Xavi in the squad to come in late and control the game, bringing in a player like Roberto to run the other team into the ground might be a good thing. Not to mention it seems like Lucho loves him. He's been improving each season over the past 2-3 years and while he may never be a starter, he could be our Adriano of the midfield. I think it's going to be important that we hold onto him unless Samper can come in and completely beat him out.   Halilovic: Should be loaned. No reason to try to keep him in the senior side because unless he's better than Rafinha or (knock on wood) we run into a lot of injury issues, he's not going to get any time this season unless it's in competitions like the Club World Cup and the Copa or we have another really weak group in the CL.  Rafinha: Certainly promising and I know Enrique likes him, but I feel like he's a little one dimensional compared to some of the other prospects. That said, he's the most similar we have to Iniesta right now and can fill those shoes.  Denis Suarez: Another promising prospect, but stuck in Sevilla at least for another year. And Sevilla can buy him as a part of his loan. I wouldn't be surprised if we never see him in a Barca jersey, tbh. Especially with Pogba coming in."
Barca,3brayh,nannulators,8,Wed Jul 1 16:30:11 2015 UTC,"While Pogba is a versatile midfielder, I certainly don't think he has all of the skills and qualities that we have through our other youth players. He's a physical midfielder with a big presence, which we need, who can also be a threat on goal from range, which we also need. However, he's not an insanely good dribbler at pace and doesn't have the vision or passing accuracy that these other players. have.  While Samper will probably sub for Busi a lot, he has the skills and qualities that Xavi had, incredible vision, possession of the ball, and passing that Pogba doesn't. He can slot in above Busi as well and I think he'll be subbing in against lower table teams. Also, I don't think Masch is going to challenge for a DM spot, he's played there a few times for us and he's nowhere near as influential as he is for Argentina. It's just a completely different dynamic.  Sergi Roberto is a squad player and nothing more for us. He has nowhere near the impact Xavi had coming in at the end of games. Sure, he can hold his own and not lose the ball, make a few simple passes, but I rarely see him make a play that is instrumental in a goal or build up. He's just not an impact player, but he's great to have as a needed sub. I think you hold him too highly...  Halilovic and Denis will be on loan most likely, so it's not even worth going into it. I also just don't know enough about the former to give enough insight.  Finally, Rafinha to me seems the most important of all of them next season. He is growing and needs time to really find his place in the squad, but his raw ability is ridiculous and can open up a lot of doors for us, especially when coming in for Iniesta. I think he's going to be our X factor next season. To me, he has more talent than Thiago, and a lot less injuries so far...  All in all, I'm no expert, I watch a lot of games and read as much as possible but there are definitely users on this subreddit who may know more so please join the discussion if you feel I'm missing something or am completely wrong..."
Barca,3brayh,Marchisio,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you say. But the most important thing here is that we stop comparing these players to Xavi. Some have a lot of the same qualities, but none of them will be able to match what he did. He was a once in a lifetime player and it's highly unlikely that we'll see another like him.   Pogba definitely isn't going to be the type of player who can go at a defender on a fast break and come out on top more often than not. But I think his physical attributes will make up for that a bit. I also think that his vision will get a bit better when surrounded by more creative players. Just look at how much better Neymar was this year after spending more time with the rest of the team. IMO he was seeing a lot more of the field than he was in his first season.  Admittedly, I haven't seen enough of Samper yet, but I still don't think there's going to be space in the team for him for several years unless someone like Rakitic or Busi were to leave. He may have the tools to be similar to Xavi, but who knows if he can apply them at the next level.   While you're right that Masch doesn't have the same influence on the Barca side, he's still a much better defensive option in midfield than Busi is 90% of the time and Lucho has used him there with pretty good results. Busi showed this season that he's capable of playing higher in the role Xavi used to play in as well, so it's possible that we could see a Masch (DM)/Iniesta/Busi or Masch (DM)/Rakitic/Busi lineup a bit more this year if there are better options at CB. Unlikely, but possible. But that's why I don't think Samper gets much if any time for a couple years at least. Maybe Lucho proves me wrong and we get to see what this kid is really about, but Masch is the 2nd most important player on the field after Messi in Lucho's eyes and I think he picks him over Samper every time.  Sergi Roberto is not an impact player. You're absolutely right. But he's a worker and that's what Lucho likes. I do give him too much credit, but I've definitely seen improvement from him that makes me believe he is a solid utility player and will continue to be one. I kind of look at him like I did Keita. He's versatile, but not necessarily a superstar. He'll come on the field and bust his ass and get the job done, but without any added flair. With Lucho's transition to being a more direct, more physical team, I think that Roberto will be great to have on the bench.. and it seems that Lucho thinks that as well since he's tried playing him in different parts of the midfield.  I still need to see more from Rafinha. He hasn't disappointed me in any way, but he hasn't stood out a lot either. I know a lot of people share your opinion that he's more talented than Thiago, and I certainly hope that's true.. but he didn't feature enough in the games I saw (which was most of them) for me to form a valid opinion of him. I'm just not sure how a more attacking mid like him really fits into the new system. I think it could be used at times, but not all the time. I mean.. we all saw how much more Iniesta played like a box-to-box midfielder under Lucho than he did as an attacking midfielder.  Agree with your last point too--I would definitely like to hear from more of the people who watch the B team regularly and can give some more input on some of the younger guys."
Barca,3brayh,nannulators,3,Wed Jul 1 17:57:24 2015 UTC,"If Samper can convert to a CM, he'll be competing for 3rd CM within a year. He's a ludicrously good player, has outgrown the B team easily and is one of the most mature young players I've ever seen."

Barca,3brayh,OrangePaper7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:30:25 2015 UTC,"According to Mina Rizouki from BBC 5 live phone in, even as recently as last year, Pogba was paid really low, salary wouldn't be an issue for him. He is starting from a lower base.   Iniesta is getting old, he'll be well rested for next season and will do fine but with Euro next year I fully expect Iniesta to suffer like he did this year post Euro. We would be buying or promoting someone regardless.   And as for youngsters, this season is like a test, rise up or else there is competition coming(Pogba might not come in reality but the motivator factor is real for the young players trying to break in)."
Barca,3brayh,iVarun,15,Wed Jul 1 20:31:22 2015 UTC,"Juve chief Marotta: ""The mood of the meeting was very good, terrific, but we did not reach an agreement for Pogba with Barca."" (1/2)  Juve chief Marotta: ""We received an offer of €80m but I can say that Juve do not want to sell Pogba."" (2/2)  AS English.  So we have confirmation of a meeting today, and claim that an offer was rejected. Seems the general consensus was that the two clubs met, agreed not to make a deal now, and will make a deal next summer.  Think about it - it makes no sense for Juve to sign a contract for next summer now when Pogba's stock will likely rise over the next year. It's legally impossible for Barcelona to do so now with a managing commission (not that it ever stopped them), plus it leaves no flexibility for the next year or so. And Pogba probably wants to focus on Euro 2016.  As far as I'm concerned, that's the end of it. And if I see more Pogba rumors for the rest of the week, they're gonna be redirected to this thread. This story needs to die already."
Barca,3brayh,egcg119,5,Wed Jul 1 16:47:50 2015 UTC,"Question here: If the consensus was to make a deal next summer over this summer, which I would be 100% happy about, do you think they'd still entertain offers from other teams?  I'm unclear as to whether you're inferring that we have a preferred option for next summer or they simply agreed now is not the time for Barca & Pogba to be together...  Thanks in advance."
Barca,3brayh,Marchisio,5,Wed Jul 1 17:14:03 2015 UTC,"I would imagine somewhere in between. Legally, it's impossible to keep Juve from entertaining other offers. It seems to me the only options would be a) a pre-contract which we just dismissed as too binding or b) a penalty clause like we used with Neymar, which worked out sooo well.  From the sound of it, however, Pogba prefers Barça. Unclear what Juve prefer, but they seem to be pretty open about doing business with Barça and haven't been nearly as open about any other clubs. So I think they'll stick to it purely to keep Pogba happy. Plus, if they tell Pogba he can go to Barça in 2016, they don't have to worry about fending off Madrid or Chelsea all summer long."
Barca,3brayh,egcg119,3,Wed Jul 1 17:17:58 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, thanks for the insight! I really hope we can pull off a Neymar-esque penalty clause (without the other shadiness of the transfer. I think he's an immense player, just the wrong timing for us atm)"

Guess it's goodbye to academy-playtime in the midfield for a long time. I mean, Busquets, Iniesta, Rakitic, Pogba - then where would Rafinha, Samper, maybe eventually Halilovic fit in? Or Denis Suarez next season..  I just don't see the need to spend 90 or so million euros on this guy. Seems like it's just to keep Madrid from getting him, which in itself is such a Madrid thing to do."
Barca,3brayh,kezorN,10,Wed Jul 1 15:12:13 2015 UTC,"Denis isn't back yet, or who knows of he will be. Mashcerano could be moved to defense permanently and thus creating a void when busi needs a rest. Rafinha usually is placed on one side, I think for iniesta most of the time. That means IF pogba does come, he could fill in to xavis role. Samper is a bit young, he'll get called up a few times for copa matches but I wouldn't want him in the first squad just yet. The last thing I want is for him to be on the bench just to play 5 matches at most for us, he needs regular playing time and to continue his development and consistency. His time will come.  The thing I like about pogba is that he gives us more options, a different way of attacking. Adds depth and dynamics to our play which I think will be crucial for barça and lucho tactics to stay ahead of the game."
Barca,3brayh,beastcat,3,Wed Jul 1 16:31:12 2015 UTC,"Mascherano moving back to defense means Masche, Pique, Vermaelan, Bartra, and Matheiu vying for the two CB spots.

Obviously Rakitic/Pogba don't have quite the controlled passing of Iniesta/Xavi, but Busquets does, and Rakitic honestly isn't far behind. Pogba, too, after a season at Barca, I think has potential to develop into more of that kind of passer. Meanwhile, both Rakitic and Pogba will be able to serve MSN on the counter excellently, and when we face a parked bus, not only could all three midfielders playmake, but MSN clearly can too. Meanwhile our potential for outside the box shots will be much higher, adding a dimension to our attack. Defensively, both Rakitic and Pogba offer more than Xavi/Iniesta and I don't think MSN will be forced much deeper. Iniesta can then, as he ages, serve the role Xavi did this season and provide the control we need to see out games as a sub."

Barça has to present their defense on July 23rd, 5 says after the election and while we're still in the hands of the puppet board managing commission.

Barca,3brzvt,NovacElement,9,Wed Jul 1 17:55:30 2015 UTC,"I see no point to sign him for supposedly 35M. He won't replace Messi-Neymar-Suarez and Pedro does a brilliant job as a sub.

It would have been worse had Arda been 30 or above or similarly worse if he had been 24 or so.    Better to get players who are old and in peak so they are atleast good, if not then won't hang around for long.   The price and position, etc are another matter."

If you want to keep up with the other top teams and have a somewhat similar transfer budget in this insane market, then you need a sponsor that can bring some serious money.  That said, I'd still personally prefer something like 20% less money and get a sponsor that's not as controversial (again, to say the least) as Qatar. I suppose it really depends on the morale of the board signing the deal. Which again says a lot about Rosell and co."
Barca,3bqwmj,kezorN,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:21:28 2015 UTC,"There are many ways of looking at it but it can be as simple as this, if we didn't get a shirt sponsor we wouldn't have signed Neymar and or Suarez and wouldn't have won the treble.  We have always been behind Madrid financially, that was the only edge they had on us since the turn of the century, we always relied on more low key signings with a mix of youth, with a shirt sponsor they have no advantage over us, just the same amount of money being thrown at huge stars, where as we used it to not sell shirts but to improve the team.  I think we need a shirt sponsor just not from Qatar, Coca Cola was the rumored one many years ago and I would have been more supportive of that, I also think strangely the Qatar deal should have been for more money, we broke our no sponsorship on the shirt policy and it should have been for huge money, being the first name on the shirt was something special, instead the board tried to break it to us gently using the ""non profit"" bullshit."
Barca,3bqwmj,Tezemery,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"There are lots of other sponsors to chose from for a team like Barca, and other teams have gotten just as much and even more money from sponsors who are way less shady (to say the least) than Qatar. I'm sure there were some other benefits of choosing Qatar, for Rosell and his friends, that more legitimate companies couldn't or wouldn't provide.   It would be silly to suggest no sponsors at all, because that's not realistic (anymore), but there are much better ones out there than Qatar (Airways)."
Barca,3bpr5h,power_change,23,Wed Jul 1 04:07:16 2015 UTC,"He was doing this 6 years ago as well. The 5-0 against Mou, the 6-2 were Messi the playmaker."

Barca,3bpr5h,zsajak,54,Fri Jul 3 14:27:36 2015 UTC,"Dude was fucking godly, imagine when he's a true CM, fuck man, that's a solid 6 more years of Messi almost guaranteed. He won't have the pace but he'll read the game like hell. Scary stuff, and a lot of top class players rely on their speed and strength, which are all things that fade with age, I see Messi relying on speed sometimes yes, but mostly with his head. Crazy to think such a legendary player cost the club no money besides wage."
Barca,3bpr5h,xFragg,5,Wed Jul 1 04:46:17 2015 UTC,"""Imagine when he's a true Cm"" He will never be a true CM IMO. As he gets older and he loses a step the furthest we will see him drop back is CAM right behind the strikers. His freedom to roam the pitch from the front is part of what makes him so lethal. If he gets hung up in the back and has to be involved with defensive duties all game I think it would detract from his overall involvement in the final 1/3rd where he is a true magician. He will always, always, always need a strong midfield working behind him to play with such freedom. That's one of the biggest reasons I want Pogba."
Barca,3bpr5h,kirkrikster,-32,Wed Jul 1 15:33:35 2015 UTC,Well the treatment did cost a lot of money and thus was a big reason for Barça getting him. Obviously worth it though.
Barca,3bpr5h,vanNostrandby,32,Wed Jul 1 05:01:25 2015 UTC,Dude that treatment was probably pennies to Barça. Shit looking at it almost any club in the world would pay for it if they knew his marketing/God-level abilities.
Barca,3bpr5h,xFragg,-14,Wed Jul 1 05:12:11 2015 UTC,"But it was still costly and played a huge part in getting Messi to Barça. Obviously if you knew how good Messi would become, it's peanuts."
Barca,3bpr5h,vanNostrandby,-7,Wed Jul 1 05:17:00 2015 UTC,Umm. I did not say that you could even compare the cost of the treatment and transfer fees. What the hell... I just said that the treatment was costly and it played a huge part of getting Messi to Barça as such a young age practically free. I mean... his original club wasn't going to pay for it.
Barca,3bpr5h,vanNostrandby,18,Wed Jul 1 05:59:36 2015 UTC,The treatment is really cheap when compared to the transfer fees of good players these days. The treatment is not that unique and rare that it cost millions. That treatment is really common and many kids with growth hormone deficiency are subjected to it. It's just that Messi's parents' financial condition was so poor that they couldn't even afford it.   Source: Read this shit until I was 19. And my father's a doctor.
Barca,3bpr5h,invice,-5,Wed Jul 1 06:56:41 2015 UTC,His club wasn't offering to pay those costs though. If you see what I'm saying...
Barca,3bpr5h,vanNostrandby,6,Wed Jul 1 05:55:21 2015 UTC,"I accept that Newell's and anyone else was not ready to pay for Messi. That does not make the treatment so rare and expensive that Barca couldn't afford it. Barca paid because they are a big club, and took it as an investment, Newells didn't because their financial resources don't give them the liberty to spend at ease.  It was really nothing to pay for his treatment for Barca. I mean, any middle class family could pay for that treatment, might be difficult, but they can pay. Its just that Messi and his family were poor, and Newells was not that big of a club to invest on someone whose success was not 100% sure."
Barca,3bpr5h,invice,-5,Wed Jul 1 06:54:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah well your last sentence is exactly the point I'm making. The treatment is costly for a young player, of whose success you can't be sure. They weren't willing to chance it, Barça was and that's why Messi came to Europe. I don't understand what's going on here, really..."
Barca,3bpr5h,vanNostrandby,2,Wed Jul 1 07:53:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the treatment was nothing special. Its just that Messi was poor as fuck, and Newells didn't have to pay for it. They could have, they didn't. To make it appear as if the treatment was some one of a kind thing, designed for Messi only, extremely rare, is wrong. We should treat everything the way it is. The treatment was costly, just not that costly that you need a giant like Barca to pay for it. You just have to have good financial conditions, not be some multi million dollar business."
Barca,3bpr5h,invice,-3,Wed Jul 1 09:06:04 2015 UTC,"Again, never stated the treatment costed millions. Certainly didn't claim we shouldn't treat everyone who needs it. I'm puzzled. The cost was too much for his club and his parents, hence I called it ""costly"", but Barça was willing to take the chance and that's why Barça got him. And 900 per month is a lot for a kid, imagine Barça adding 900 monthly fee for every la masia player. It would certainly show on the books."
Barca,3bpr5h,vanNostrandby,3,Wed Jul 1 09:22:07 2015 UTC,"Idk why you're being downvoted because you didn't say anything wrong, you're right the treatment isn't something he could have afforded, and in Argentina especially too. Anyways it's not a big deal, the point of this thread was about Messi's evolution not his past :("
Barca,3bpr5h,xFragg,0,Wed Jul 1 09:46:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was still using a lot of his pace which I doubt he'll have left that much in his 30s. Certainly showed he can control the tempo and organize the attacks from behind as well as the best of them."
Barca,3bpr5h,vanNostrandby,2,Wed Jul 1 16:08:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people are down voting you. That's absolutely, without a doubt, one of the biggest reasons he chose Barca. They were one of 5 or 6 European clubs that would have payed for the treatment when he was 13 years old. It's easy to say that's pennies on the dollar now that he is the best player in the world...but when he was a short, weak boy no one knew what was going to happen. Shame on whoever is down voting you."
Barca,3bpr5h,kirkrikster,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:14:14 2015 UTC,"Downvotes don't really bother me, I'm more amazed by the comments since this topic has been discussed upon quite a many times here and this is how I remember the story. Maybe there's some misunderstanding here with me saying the treatment was expensive and then people comparing those costs to pro wages or something, I don't know. I'd assume most clubs won't indeed spend that much extra money on 13-year-olds without making a huge gamble. Sure, they can afford it, but on grand scheme of things with big clubs risk management would probably advice otherwise."
Barca,3bpr5h,vanNostrandby,2,Wed Jul 1 15:39:04 2015 UTC,"How many stories of the ""best player in the world"" start with ""he's going to be small, weak, and may only be 5 feet tall."" Short answer, zero... Unless we're talking about Disney movies, Messi is THE one in a billion success story. While people may have seen greatness when he was young, the level at which he has performed has surpassed any of the hopes of dreams people layed out infront of him."
Barca,3bpr5h,kirkrikster,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:50:37 2015 UTC,"He didn't even ""choose"" Barcelona, he had no other options because no one else was willing to pay for the treatments.

Barca,3bpr5h,zazzlekdazzle,2,Wed Jul 1 15:55:17 2015 UTC,"He absolutely chose Barcelona. So much so that his first contract was drawn up on a napkin because his father wanted a sign of good faith and loyalty from the club. Its hard to say what would have happened had Jorge Messi and little Lio walked out of Barcelona without an offer, but my guess is one of the other 8 major European outfits would have picked him up.  I agree with you that he feels a deep sense loyalty to the club and gratitude. You're absolutely right about that. But I still think he chose Barcelona as much as they chose him."
Barca,3bpr5h,kirkrikster,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:35:31 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you're being downvoted.   Think of the numerous young talents that are scouted, and don't make it into the first team because of injuries, discipline, or what not. Messi was surely a bigger talent than many of the other players at his age, but with a setback (already) at the age of (?)11. Spending a substantial amount of money for a youth product that may not even fulfill their potential is a large gamble, although it paid off x999999999.  P.S. I believe I read somewhere that 99% of youth academy prospects don't make it into Europe's top flight, so Barca spending (potentially) hundreds of thousands of dollars for a youth prospect is quite ludicrous. The end result, like you said, is definitely worth it though."

Barca,3bpr5h,vanNostrandby,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:35:37 2015 UTC,"That's irrelevant, we already know his family couldn't afford it, that's the reason it was even brought into the soccer world. It's not a club's obligation to pay for medical bills, especially at a young age. Messi's family begged them to.   The discussion is not about his family not being able to pay for it, it's about a club being able to...Newell's could afford it, it just wasn't worth it to them b/c he was so young and they didn't see the potential that Barcelona scouts did.

Barca,3bpr5h,Aj16ay,7,Wed Jul 1 06:21:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched much of either play but from what I've heard they single handedly raised the level of the team to win trophies, especially Maradona with arg, napoli. That was the argument against Messi - that he hadn't won international trophies, where the other 2 had won them when younger. Now that he's tried his all to win by scoring goals and not suceeded, probably the only way Argentina can win the WC is by him being a playmaker."
Barca,3bpr5h,Spookylives,3,Wed Jul 1 06:51:05 2015 UTC,"And, until this year, people always said his Barcelona records and trophies all came because he stood on the shoulders of Xavi and Iniesta."
Barca,3bpr5h,zazzlekdazzle,3,Wed Jul 1 07:51:05 2015 UTC,"That was the argument against Messi - that he hadn't won international trophies, where the other 2 had won them when younger.   I still say that's a garbage argument. Team trophies are a team effort. Messi was absolutely not the reason Argentina lost the 2014 World Cup, and I don't think a prime condition Maradona could have won it with that team either."
Barca,3bpr5h,sleepsholymountain,2,Wed Jul 1 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"Messi could have easily chosen to play with Spain. I don't think anyone would argue that they wouldn't have won the 2 Euros and the WC with him instead of Torres. If he had, he'd be GOAT. But because he chose to play for Argentina instead he isn't?  Out of the 3 WCs Pele won, he was a 17 in the first and had a huge impact coming in the latter stages. In 62 he didn't play. 66 was a disaster. In 1970 Brazil was so stacked they most likely would have won without him anyway. Of course he was the cherry on the cake but there was still a cake."

Barca,3bpr5h,DivineVibrations,7,Wed Jul 1 20:09:23 2015 UTC,"I sure hope so, it'll definitely bolster Argentina's chances in 2018 especially with the emergence of Pastore. The PSG midfielder could actually be the difference in the next World Cup, especially if Messi drops deeper in midfield, Icardi, Dybala, and Lamela are as good as advertised, and Mussachio and Rojo lead the future Argentine line of defense. Only concern is Mascherano's replacement in shielding the back 4 in midfield."
Barca,3bpr5h,YoSoyMilkChocolate,10,Wed Jul 1 12:46:48 2015 UTC,"I really liked the chemistry between Messi and Pastore. If these two play like this alongside few clinical finishers like Dybala, Vietto, Icardi (perhaps Iturbe too) with a solid defense made by Rojo, Musacchio, Otamendi and Rulli as GK then I really hope Argentina can win World Cup 2018.

The last few times Argentina played the final of prestigious tournaments like World Cup and Copa America, they lost (in CA '04 Argentina almost won but Brazil's injury time equalizer made the game advance to the penalty shootout and Brazil won, in CA '07 Brazil again defeated them with a convincing margin of 3 goals although 1 goal was an own goal but still that made the score line look bad for Argentina, in WC '14 Argentina got at least two golden chances to win the glory of being the world champion and both of them were wasted and Germany fetched victory in the extra time).  I'm really tensed about the final match and although I'm doubtful about Chile's cheat-tricks/refereeing/game control but I hope everything will go in favor of Argentina this time.

Busi reads the game better than anyone else and is always two, maybe three steps ahead. His movement and passing makes him incredibly valuable to us, but most of his work goes unnoticed by the untrained eye.

Barca,3bnexe,broad_h2o,3,Wed Jul 1 08:43:35 2015 UTC,Cuadrado is on my list of best avoided transfers :)
Barca,3bnexe,rdesyo,5,Tue Jun 30 22:58:25 2015 UTC,Backup forward if the rumors of Pedro leaving are true? Yeah he just signed a new contract but wasnt there a post on the front page the other day about him still possibly leaving because he has some good offers on the table?
Barca,3bnexe,04andrew22,11,Tue Jun 30 18:14:06 2015 UTC,Yeah Cuadrado as a winger would make a lot more sense than as a right back.
Barca,3bnexe,vanNostrandby,6,Tue Jun 30 18:32:02 2015 UTC,"He can play on either side, too -- right? He didn't overly impress at chelsea with the limited time he had, but he sounds like he could be a potential good plan B if pedro leaves IMO."
Barca,3bnexe,04andrew22,2,Tue Jun 30 19:38:28 2015 UTC,"My favorite player but honestly as much as I would love for it to happen, I don't think it would benefit him or Barça very much.  He could probably play where Iniesta plays but is much better on the wings"
Barca,3bnexe,mattb10,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:01:35 2015 UTC,"I'm intrigued. Lucho wanted this man to play in a 3-2-3-2/3-4-3 formation last summer. If he has EU citizenship, then he's perfect for the right winger position in 3-2-3-2/3-4-3. Vidal can play full back in our conventional 4-3-3 so both will have playing time. This would be a great transfer if we can get him on a discount."

Quite frankly I am tired of people who simply do not know what the fuck they are talking about, someone tried to link an article at me the other day accusing Bartomeu and the heads of other european clubs as being part of a conspiracy to get the world cup in Qatar, don't worry though there wasn't any actual evidence in the article, just spelling errors.  So thats the kind of discussion i am being treated to.  edit: I would love to have a discussion, but this sub has been turned into Laporta campaign headquarters, it is just pitiful.  When Laporta motioned to censure Nunez he said ""Si la ganase por mayoría simple, por dignidad democrática, debería convocar nuevas elecciones"" (Mundo Deportivo, 17 febrero 1998, pág. 5).  Ten years later he had a 60 PERCENT vote against him.....no elections called.  People dislike the Qatar deal but say nothing of the 10 million that Laporta squirelled away from his dealings with Uzbek Firm Zeromax, while he was president....http://deportes.elpais.com/deportes/2011/10/10/actualidad/1318231314_850215.html  He bought 1,644 tickets to a U2 concert and 1,518 tickets for a Champions League final (with club funds) that were not for the use of club members.

I personally had doubts as well about how on earth Suárez, Neymar and Messi were going to work together; especially because back then it wasn't clear if Messi would stay at false 9 or  not.  He also said this in October, before Suárez played: “Perhaps the presence of Suarez will improve the connection between Messi and Neymar”  Cruijff is a legend and one of the main reasons why we have everything we have today.

(9/10 times it would have been a goal)  Sadly that 1 always comes while he plays for Argentina. Hope he rises up to the occasion(I mean score a goal).

It was the right decision in my opinion.   Can't answer the other question as I absolutely have no idea.
Barca,3bm8gv,urbeer,10,Tue Jun 30 10:34:41 2015 UTC,"Not as I recall. His agent made some remarks how Pep wanted to sell Alves, Pique, Villa, and Fabregas because they were not up to his standard. Villa was just for sporting reasons, but the rest he had an issue with their attitude. The especially shocking part was that apparently he was disappointed with Fabregas as a person. So he told Rosell his plans but Rosell refused because of possible fan backlash. So Pep quit.  Makes you wonder, considering what we've accomplished and the people who've left."

I heard similar things and I think even though pep said differently;  He left because he was exhausted, unsatisfied with the protection he did not receive from  the board,  specially aparent during the Mourinho shenanigans, and because after a team is successful for a few years, you need to change something, Cruyff said something of a cycle of 4 years,  after that you have to change some players or the coach.   Maybe Pep let his brother leak that information to gauge how far the board is prepared to back him for selling fan favourite players.   Personally I think Pep would have stayed under a different board and when he would have been allowed to sell some star player,  a thing that I think is necessary after a few years of so much success."

Barca,3bm8gv,Chillidawg,5,Tue Jun 30 16:11:48 2015 UTC,"So, I was writing for Barcaloco at the time he stepped down. Here's what I said about it then:  Requiem For The Guardiola Era: A Fond Farewell to Señor Blaugrana  When Guardiola, earlier this afternoon, confirmed the suspicions that he was stepping down as manager, my mind immediately took me back to May, 2008. At the time, I was writing a little-read sports and politics blog called Split Tens, and the occasion of this particular entry was a match between Barcelona and Mallorca. (The date, for the amateur historians, was the 11th.) The title of my article that day was Eulogy for Frank Rijkaard, a title I'm borrowing in amended form here. While Nero fiddled along, Barcelona blew a 2-0 lead and lost to an extra-time goal from the islanders. The scene was inevitable. The euphoria of the 2006 Champions League final was long since dissipated. The hero of that final, the inimitable Henrik Larsson, was back in Sweden playing for his beloved Helsingborg. Ronaldinho was losing form so quickly, it seemed that his stint as the greatest in the world was a mirage. The fans at Camp Nou whistled every time Samuel Eto'o, the great Samuel Eto'o, touched the ball and when he scored the second, he blasted the ball into the back of the net twice after the goal in a fit of his trademark rage. The rage was different, though, in that it was directed at the culé faithful which was so quick to turn on the players who had brought them such success so recently. Edmilson, the stalwart defensive midfielder who earlier that season had made much-analyzed remarks about some ""black sheep"" in the Barcelona dressing room, was sent off shortly before Mallorca's winner. Thierry Henry was in his forgettable first season with the club (in which he led the team in scoring, but found himself the object of constant ridicule bordering on disdain, a scapegoat for the failures of the Rijkaard regime.) There was outrage in my voice as I recounted the events that led to the breakdown against Mallorca and a distant third-place finish, 10 points behind Villareal. But I realized, in spite of it, that my outrage was directed in all directions except the direction of Rijkaard. It was not in my power to avoid the observation that his face showed more heartbreak than I felt when Mallorca went ahead, and the whistles and white flags from the faithful didn't seem appropriate at all. They seemed cruel.   In some respects, that's the nature of being Barcelona manager. To be sure, it's not as grueling as being manager of Chelsea or Real Madrid but there is without question a level of demand that no person of normal sanity could handle for any length of time. For this reason, it never surprised or upset me that Pep Guardiola preferred one year contracts. He'd seen with his own eyes the way the ultimate icon of Barcelona soccer, Johan Cruyff, was unceremoniously run out of town for the great sin of two years without a trophy, even after winning eleven in his previous six seasons. It takes a great deal of self-delusion to think Guardiola wouldn't have been handed the same fate had he stuck around and then failed to win a title for another year, even after he won in his first three years more titles than any other blaugrana manager had managed in a career. What reason would a man who has blaugrana coursing through his veins have to stay on board for the inevitable disgraceful exit? So, sure, there's no blaming him for his fear of commitment during his tenure, and there's no blaming him for leaving now. He's looked burnt out since, if I had to put a finger on it, the 2009 Club World Cup final, which may be the least memorable of the finals he won at Barcelona. To refresh your memory, it's the one where Barcelona beat Estudiantes of Argentina in extra time, and Guardiola's emotion was some mixture of exhaustion and relief. Yes, tears of exhaustion look different than tears of joy and that's what he displayed that day. It was obvious then that his time was short for the club. That he made it two and half more years is a tribute to his toughness, and also to his deep love for the club.   The historical record on the Guardiola Era will surely be sweetened some from the reality. I don't mean to disparage the man's accomplishments, of course. On the pitch, Barcelona found that balance between efficiency and beauty that is the pinnacle of the game. Beautiful attacking soccer, with incredible defensive efficiency (truly, look at the goals against record over the past few years - everyone remembers Messi, Xavi, and Iniesta but the defense was extraordinary, anchored by Carles Puyol and Victor Valdes the whole time.) A team that played to win, and did so beautifully, the thing kids forty years from now will read about and slightly disbelieve in the same way I read about and slightly disbelieved the rumors of the beautiful Cruyff-led Ajax and Netherlands teams from the early 70s. The key to this, many say, was Guardiola. I have no doubt that he deserves a great deal of credit for the improvements of some of the key players - Xavi, who recently complained that he was under-appreciated by Rijkaard, became the greatest passing midfielder in the world under Pep's tutelage. (The best, perhaps, since Pep Guardiola.) Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi of course had the skill and talent to become what they've become, but I think it's clear that Guardiola knew how to get the best out of them, particularly in employing a system that put them both in their most useful roles. And Gerard Piqué, my God. He went from being a bust at Manchester United, washed up by his early twenties, to becoming one of the absolute best defenders in the world, and the perfect Total Football defender at that. He was omnipresent in defense, and also able to bomb forward in attack. His relentless play was, again, appreciated best by Guardiola.  I've said so before here at Barcaloco, though, and I'll say it again. Guardiola's record in the transfer market was poor. There were very expensive mistakes, most notably the irritating sagas of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Dmitro Chygrynsky. David Villa and Cesc Fabregas were probably good signings, albeit obvious ones. It doesn't take a shrewd eye for talent to sign up the rest of the Spanish national team. Dani Alves and the supremely underrated Seydou Keita were the biggest successes and they came in his first summer, before the pressure to spend lots of money on very famous people had gotten to Pep's head. Selling Maxwell put the team in a very difficult position at left back for the second half of this season. The supremely talented Bojan was never allowed to flourish, and then sent off on a long loan to Serie A. Alexis Sanchez might qualify as a good signing, but for my purposes, he's in the same category as Villa and Fabregas. Everyone already knew he was a world-class talent.  Pep has been excellent, with the notable Bojan exception, at working players from La Masia into the regular rotation. Of course. So, his record is excellent, the best manager the club has ever had (including Cruyff, including Rijkaard, including Rinus Michels.) It isn't perfect. I don't know what's changed since 2008, but I'm immensely proud of the way the blaugrana supporters have handled the losses to Real Madrid and Chelsea over the last couple of weeks. Fabregas moaned that the Chelsea result wasn't fair, but I've seen enough soccer to be quite confident in my opinion that it was very fair. It's not enough to create chances and maintain possession, of course, you must score. And that, likewise, in the Clásico. Nevertheless, especially in comparison to the good riddance afforded to Rijkaard and Cruyff, the reaction to the losses and to Guardiola's resignation has been mature and even-handed. It's too easy for a fan of a club that wins everything to be disappointed when they lose something. But the fact is, only some kind of moron would have honestly expected Pep to win every trophy he ever competed for. (And, by the way, try explaining to a fan of Betis or Getafe or Espanyol how terrible it is to only finish second in the league and make the Champions League semi-finals. There must be a way to have expectations without having entitlement.) The way Guardiola is leaving, his reputation is in tact. I admire him for that, and I admire the supporters for allowing it to be so. (There is the small point that he could still add a sixteenth trophy in the Copa del Rey final, and the whole weight of the club with all it's worldwide support and heavy history will be backing exactly that result. It's the very, very least he deserves.)  If I could've picked anyone to replace Guardiola, I'll add, it would've been Tito Vilanova. Barcelona is more than a club, and it's certainly more than a manager. Vilanova will provide continuity in philosophy and style, while also bringing a fresh approach to the transfer market and man-management. Sandro Rosell and the board deserve immense credit, as Laporta's men did in 2008, for staying in house instead of bowing to the clamor for a big-name manager. The club is too big for Arsene Wenger, is what I'm saying. We should all react with pride and optimism that Vilanova will be our man this coming summer in the transfer market and then this coming fall in the 12/13 season.  So, yes, this is the end to the Guardiola Era. Pep was justly exhausted, and he deserved above all the right to leave on his own terms. I'm proud of him for the acumen with which he led the club he loves, and also for the dignity with which he left it. The Barcelona we all love will carry on under the guiding hand of Vilanova, of that we can be assured. In closing, I implore you all, Barcaloco readers, that should you ever see Pep Guardiola in person, buy him a glass of cava and allow him to talk about anything he wants. Apart from soccer."

Add on top of that Mourinho's way with the press and Pep is going to have a tough time with the press. I think the pressure was too much and he wanted out as well as to prove himself at another club.   I think Luis Enrique's side. The Pep Barca employed the tiki-taka to amazing success it was even used as the Spanish national team's strat but I think a lot of teams have learned how to beat the comp. Also as much as I loved the Pedro, Messi, Villa combo or the Eto'o, Messi, Henri combo, MSN just blows them out of the water!"
Barca,3bm8gv,felixisfalling,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:10:29 2015 UTC,"One of the qualities that make him a good manager is he is a sensitive person.  He can pick up on the little things and combine that with his intelligence for the game and he is a very effective leader and strategist.  That also led to him being exhausted though I think.  Exhausted of the players, or more specfically wondering if he was reaching them and challenging them, if he was effective at all...and exhausted of the politics that come with being the manager."

We have a problem, we need someone to replace Iniesta (perhaps during or at the end of next year), but have a lot of unconvincing talent so far.  It's completely natural for a team to explore possibilities.  What would be nice is if people could give a balanced, subjective viewpoint on the matter. Especially in regards to paying a very large transfer fee for a player at a position we absolutely will need in the next year or two.  My opinion..."

I think we've had loads of discussions on exactly what Pogba can bring and what we don't need. Hell, there's even been tons of articles written about it. To me, justifying $90M + $12M in wages/yr is ludicrous for a position that we have one of the best in the world playing and incredible youth products waiting in line to be given their shot. At least this summer.  It would make more sense to wait and see how Iniesta fares and how Rafi/Denis/Samper/Halilovic can handle it."

There is a lot more travel and between 4 and 5 additional fixtures that come about as a result of winning the treble. It is extremely difficult to be champion. All the extra wear and tear, travel, and lack of rest leads to injuries. Our attack is obviously scary good, but the biggest problem the team is likely to face is attrition. This can be anticipated and counteracted with squad depth, but we need to have a large squad to pull it off. The transfer ban is likely to be decisive, as much as it pains me to admit it. We probably won't be able to sign any top class players in January that aren't cup tied. We need to promote from within, even if that means dropping a few points in the league or potentially being knocked out of the Copa del Rey. Obviously that means patience and no talk of sacking when the inevitable rotations return."

Since no real talent is coming on La Masia ranks for this position, it makes sense not to discard of Montoya completely for now. He could very well develop into a great player in two years with Inter."
Barca,3biw6l,latino666,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:20:39 2015 UTC,"Υea but what did Inter pay to Barcelona ? If it was something small or nothing then I don't think it's a very good deal.  Similarly, what is the buyout clause ? Is it low or high ? Also can Barcelona get him back or sell him next summer or are they forced to wait 2 years ?  Without all that info you can't really say whether it was good or bad though it sounds like a decent deal.  Finally I think it's wrong that the management acted like this when they knew there were elections coming. Roster decisions should be made by the new board"
Barca,3biw6l,Eladir,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:23:23 2015 UTC,"Apparently it's a 1M euro deal to loan him, 8M buy-out clause."

Barca,3biw6l,Eladir,2,Tue Jun 30 20:05:52 2015 UTC,2 year loan with a option to buy for 8m is horrible. (Great for Montoya though). This temporary board shouldn't be allowed to make deals. Now rumours has it that they'll sign a midfielder. BEFORE elections.

Nike is dominating kit manufacturing outside of soccer (e.g. Nike just won the NBA contract and last year started manufacturing NFL jerseys). I wonder if they are retreating from soccer and maybe didn't try to hard to win the Utd account.   That said, the Barcelona Nike Store is one of the most profitable Nike store in the world and Nike's biggest star of the future is Neymar.   Regardless, whichever company wins the contract I hope we bring in a substantial amount for the deal. I'm less concerned with the logo on the kit and more concerned with the sponsors.But, no more horizontal stripes please!"

And he makes a valid point, while insinuating that if Pogba goes to Barca, he has to be played. He's doing well for his player.   Also he points out that Cruyff got it wrong with Zlatan (just like he got it wrong in the opposite way when he did come out and say the Suarez transfer was a mistake)."
Barca,3bjc66,romanmoses,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:23:46 2015 UTC,"Actually no, he made those comments during the summer Ibra was sold so both Pep and Cruyff were very much still in Barca.

IMO, fuck this kid, he's asking 12M net per year, more than players who have won World Cups and many UCL like Iniesta. What has he done to have the 2nd higher salary in Barça only below Messi? In no way I'd pay this guy more than Neymar, Iniesta or Mascherano. I say forget him, let's use the money to sign Verratti and a second player.  Oh, and let's not forget that his manager is asking for 20M just for him. 90M to Juve +20M to his manager + 24M (12M net) a year (120 for 5 years) = 230M over 5 years for a football player that may or may not be among the best ones in the future, but he's done nothing yet.

Perhaps Busquets can be pushed up into a more creative role and we can platoon others at DM?  Sergi Roberto looked pretty good in spells there, Samper coming through, masche can get a game or two there.  Dunno but maybe we are going about ""replacing"" Xavi in the wrong way."

I think he wants to get a mammoth deal from an English team or PSG.  I also think he genuinely does not want him to go to Barcelona and the wage demand is his way of trying to either a) dissaude us from signing while still jacking up the transfer fee because every candidate is promising to sign pogba or b) get the best possible deal for his player, despite his personal distaste for barcelona."

My opinion is, even though the trophies mean less, the chance to do a double Treble and a double Sextuple will be at the forefront of the player's minds come August and December."

Both supercups and CWC are next seasons competitions. So if we were to win all 3 of them in this calendar year, it wouldn't be all 6 from the same season. Right?  Edit: thanks for the replies. It's very obvious now that I think about it."
Barca,3bi1w9,iwishiwasbased,24,Mon Jun 29 14:39:13 2015 UTC,The previous sextuple is also for a calendar year. No-one's done the sextuple for a season since no-one's managed to win even just the CL back to back.

Those trophies are for the next season, just like Real didn't actually go trophyless last season, they won the supercup and the club world cup. They way I reason it is that (on top of the fact that those events actually take place during the on-going season and not the previous) the teams have different squads and their opponents have different squads too, and rules might have changed and so on...   Saying those trophies count for last season makes just about much sense as claiming a team climbing up to the top division and winning it would count as a trophy for last season. Yeah, you qualify for the competition by last season's performance but the competition still takes place during the on-going season and thus is a part of it."
Barca,3bi1w9,vanNostrandby,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:05:27 2015 UTC,"you know what really grind my gears ?   no-one's managed to win even just the CL back to back.   UEFA counts the European Cups won by Madrid (the first 5 they won in a row) as UCL titles, but no one ever won the UCL title back to back. Are they now UCL titles or nah UEFA ??"
Barca,3bi1w9,TimeFingers,-2,Tue Jun 30 07:45:07 2015 UTC,It is true that after the re-branding of European Cup no club ever won UCLs consecutively but EC and UCL are basically the same thing with different name. Thus your statement of no club ever managed to win back to back UCL is invalid as previously both Ajax and Bayern won 3 consecutive ECs (Ajax from '70-'71 to '72-'73 and Bayern from '73-'74 to '75-'76) and AC Milan won two ECs in a row ('88–'89 and '89–'90). But you are right about no club ever won six trophies in one season.
Barca,3bi1w9,Football_Enthusiast,2,Mon Jun 29 18:57:15 2015 UTC,I'm obviously speaking about the modern CL as it's relevant to the sextuple discussion. I'm aware of the history. Fifa world cup started in 2000 so anything before that is pretty irrelevant to a sextuple discussion.
Barca,3bi1w9,vanNostrandby,0,Mon Jun 29 19:08:11 2015 UTC,I understood what you were talking about; but I'm a bit confused about clubs being able to win sextuple prior to FIFA CWC because there used to be another competition called UEFA Cup Winners Cup that was dissolved in 1999. I'm not sure about this but I guess it was possible for clubs in pre-CWC era to win sextuple.
Barca,3bi1w9,Football_Enthusiast,2,Mon Jun 29 19:24:55 2015 UTC,Sextuple again here referring to Pep's achievement and repeating it.
Barca,3bi1w9,vanNostrandby,6,Mon Jun 29 19:49:54 2015 UTC,"Pep's sextuple was in a calendar year.  It makes sense, because you have to WIN the league or CDR to even be eligible to win the Super Cul.  Edit- to do the sextuple you are speaking of a team would have to win the sextuple AND back to back trebles (unless they got into the Spanish Super Cup as runner up)"
Barca,3bi1w9,Not_Tom_Brady,5,Mon Jun 29 16:13:53 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that they do count as the sextuple, as you wouldn't qualify for any of them with winning the titles from the previous year. To my mind they run on from each other."
Barca,3bi1w9,chacaron,3,Mon Jun 29 15:38:25 2015 UTC,"I think he means that we've already won the Liga, Copa del Rey, and Champions League. You must win those three competitions to play the Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and Club's World Cup (the obvious exception is Bilbao in the Super Cup).  If we happen to win those three cups in this season, and win again the treble, the 'sextete' won't belong to the 2014-2015 season."

It's such an unnecessary competition and it makes the team's schedule even harder.  The two super cups I understand, it's a nice way to start the footballing season, but the CWC is IMO a waste of time and a potential risk for injuries. Last time we were in it, Villa suffered a season-ending injury."

If we'd play with only the players that aren't in the starting 11, then awesome, but that will never happen. Would you like one of MSN to receive a season-ending injury because of a glorified friendly against some random Asian team?"
Barca,3bihbl,EpicChiguire,11,Mon Jun 29 14:27:44 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ, this video is awful. A minute and a half of Neymar headlines, plsu more at the end? Talk about beating a dead fucking horse. And praising Tata Martino and saying he would continue in the middle of the season is a ""lie"" now? Every football figure does that, otherwise you publicly unsettle the team mid-season.   Look, I don't want Bartomeu re-elected, but this video is asinine, pointing at headlines with the logic of a 3-year-old (with the exception of the Abidal lie - that's unforgivable).  I hate the summer and I hate elections when stuff like this is what's on the front page. Content is supposed to encourage discussion. There's no discussion with a video of this sort. It's either you agree that Bartomeu is the devil incarnate or nothing. And to have content like this at the top of the sub when another user's claims against Laporta (backed by an actual Sid Lowe source, not a petty Youtube video) have been downvoted to oblivion is ridiculous."

Wow, that's so hilariously inaccurate.   Firstly, i didnt pick our Masia players, i didnt manage their B team. If we had Iniesta, Puyol, Xavi, Busquets or Messi in Masia they would make it into the first team. Simple as that. Most of the players of this generation just arent good enough. You dont get world class players from your academy every year, we've just become accustomed to it. There's a few that show promise but bringing them up too early when theyre struggling against their B team opposition is probably a bad idea though, especially if theyre not ready. There's not a single player in La Masia that can slot into the first team straight away. At best theyll make a few sub appearances here and there. Theyre much better staying in our B-team and actually playing week in week out.   we're stuck with some sponsor that's for slave labor   Who is paying us extreme amounts of money. If someone else matched their offer im sure we wouldve taken it. With FFP we have to be competitive, the days of having no sponsor are gone. I dont love the sponsor, but i dont think it's a huge deal either. There's literally no huge company willing to hand over piles of cash that big that has behaved entirely ethically, if you believe there is, youre incredibly naive/optimistic.   our team got transfer banned (which is making Masia talents leave)   This sucks, but Bartomeu wasnt even president then. So i dont really understand your point. Sure he was Vice President, but that's not exactly the same. He wasnt making the executive decisions. If the rules regarding under 18 internationals were the same in spain as they are in other eu countries we would never be in this situation. I understand why barcelona wanted to remain competitive in signing young players. Our transfer ban has hardly effected us besides youth players though, we're linked with every player under the sun just the same and we'll probably still make some major signings. Overall, not a huge deal. We still have our treble winning squad afterall.   we saw Abidal, Valdes, Thiago and Pep leave.   The way Abidal was treated was disgusting and impossible to justify, so i wont bother. Valdes, however, has been replaced by two goalkeepers better than him. That's just football. Bravo has probably been one of the best goalkeepers in the world this season and MatS has an UNBELIEVABLE upside being so young. That's fantastic as far as im concerned, not something to criticize the club for.   Thiago is nowhere near as good as Barca fans like to present him as being. I watched every single game he ever played for us. He was ok, went missing a lot and then had some injury problems. He still isnt that great and would still struggle to fit into our team's midfield. He's not better than Rakitic and from what i've seen of Rafinha, he's probably less impactful than him even. So again, no big loss. A young player that was touted as having potential never really materialized and he moved on. Again, that's just football. This isn't pogba we're talking about, we're missing out on a player that would struggle to get games. No big deal.  Pep was always going to leave, his friends/family were commenting on how much the job was effecting his health. He looked 10 years older when he left the club than when he took over as manager. So yea, cant really blame that on Bartomeu either.   It's because we support the club that we care who runs it, and that we don't want some corrupt scumbag like Bartomeu running it.   You can be critical of your club. Posting terribly produced, incredibly biased youtube videos trying to turn fans against their own club is disgusting though. Especially on a english forum where we have as close to zero effect on upcoming elections as you could imagine. Noone that watched this video is going to vote in july. Not a single person."

CONGRATULATIONS!!! YOU'RE READY TO BE A MADRIDISTA! :-D   Yea, you dont get to call me any less of a fan because i dont buy into your propaganda bullshit. Link me the part where i said i dont care about our academy? I dont think ANY massive corporate sponsor is ethically sound, so no, i dont think it's that big of a deal.   Our youth players not being good enough to demand minutes has nothing to do with me. If we brought in Adama to sit on the bench, or Samper and they failed to break into the squad in any significant way youd be here criticizing them for being shit, or theyd be moved on and youd be crying that we didnt give them enough of a chance like Thiago. You just want something to complain about and saying ""we dont support our Masia anymore"" is an easy thing to say that seems to hold true until anyone actually looks into the players we have available and realizes theyre just not getting minutes based on merit, not politics. You really think there's some diabolical plot to keep our promising young players out of the first team? Could you be more naive?  You just want to cry that the sky is falling when we're probably the most successful club in the last 10 years. Laporta, Rosell and and Bartomeu all had their faults but they lead our team to where it is today. You crying from your armchair has done exactly fuckall for anyone. You admit you have no way to influence the elections and youre probably aware that no english speaking fan that frequents this subreddit will be voting in July, so again i ask, what will this whining accomplish?

Again, remember that we didn't have ANY sponsor in our shirts through almost one century? And when we did, we actually gave money to that sponsor.

His last season with Barcelona I dare to say he was one of the top 3 goalkeepers in the world.  For some reason though, most people always single out the few mistakes he did, which happen to every goalkeeper and that gave him a bad reputation.  People who say that he was never world class are people who obviously never seen him play week after week, or people who saw this one mistake he made and now he's a bad keeper in their eyes."

Every mistake he's ever done has been magnified and all of his great saves have been under the radar for the press, who have always loved to lick 'El Santo''s ass at any chance possible.

Valdes plays really aggressively, and I'm sure he still will under LVG, so some of his mistakes look dumber than they are because he's way out of position. But his instincts are impeccable and he's an astounding athlete (and I'm hearing he's all the way back from his injury.) He will make plays you wouldn't expect any other keeper to make, but he will also give you three or four episodes of cardiac arrest per match. Love that guy."
Barca,3bhmxs,rmorgan93,3,Mon Jun 29 22:22:29 2015 UTC,"The best way to put it is that Valdés was the perfect goalkeeper for Barcelona.   Valdés came into an era of Barcelona that wasn't initially defined by Guardiola's now famous ""if you have the ball, they can't attack you"" ideals. Under Rijkaard the team was solid, but fuck me if I didn't have heart palpitations on almost every counter or extended period of possession for the opposition. They were not an overly solid unit and Valdés, along with saving Barcelona's ass a few times, committed a number of errors that have been blown out of proportion.  Yeah, they were shitty, but all keepers make shitty mistakes - even the best.  Valdés was an aggressive, commanding keeper who had no problem playing the ball out with his feet. His patrolling of the area improved immensely as he got older as well as his capacity for focus when he didn't see much action for the majority of a game. He's definitively world class, because Barcelona might have won those titles with Casillas or Buffon or Cech in goals, but outside of those - admittedly outstanding - goalkeepers, any other keeper probably wouldn't have done as well as Valdés did in that time."
Barca,3bhmxs,arkhamandcheese,5,Tue Jun 30 02:20:48 2015 UTC,I'll have to go against the majority here and say Valdes was a good but not world class keeper. People are blinded by his last season where he WAS insane but one season does not make you world class. I think he would be even better right now if he never got injured but sadly thats how football goes.
Barca,3bhmxs,DivineVibrations,2,Mon Jun 29 14:41:47 2015 UTC,''one season doesn't make you world class''  yes because Valdes only had one good season...

Barca,3bhmxs,merouane21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:06:55 2015 UTC,"His stats and the team's record show many successes over the course of time when he was our number one starter.  He was, has, and potentially will be world class for a few more years again.  I think the reason people think those things about Valdes, myself  included, were due to the way he would shout and flail his hands about when there was a mistake on defense or when he had to make a big save.  I watched Barca starting in 2011 and that was one of the first things I noticed from a non-football viewpoint, ""Why is he yelling so much?""  Perhaps that is normal - but I didn't see Bravo and MAtS being so vocally aggressive or ""rude"" towards their teammates this past year."
Barca,3bhmxs,cdrawesome,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:47:15 2015 UTC,"I'd simply attribute such aggression to his veteran status and direction on the field. Puyol was wont to do the same. Due to his known character and leadership role on the team, however, it was seen as a natural thing to do. Valdes formed part of the spine of captains along with puyol, xavi, and iniesta. Save for maybe iniesta they could all be counted on to voice their opinions on the field."

Barca,3bh61u,Acquits,16,Mon Jun 29 04:38:18 2015 UTC,. It's all part of election campaign I believe. Will anyone expain me why we need Paul Pogba . Is it necessary to spend that much ? Or is this all publicity gimmick?  Rakitic was 20m signing!
Barca,3bh61u,timeslut93,9,Mon Jun 29 04:41:41 2015 UTC,"In my opinion we do not need Pogba, but we do need a new midfielder. Verrati is the ideal choice but he is unattainable because of PSG. The second choice is Koke but he loves Atletico. Third choice is Pogba. While he might not be the best choice overrall he is the best choice from the options that are available."
Barca,3bh61u,rocksteadybebop,2,Mon Jun 29 06:28:59 2015 UTC,what will teams do to defend that? eventually they'll figure it out like they did with peps total football right??
Barca,3bh61u,rocksteadybebop,2,Mon Jun 29 07:05:46 2015 UTC,Pep's version of total football was solved by parking the bus... chelsea and inter figured it out and real started to... what i meant was what do you think teams will do to lucho's barca?
Barca,3bh61u,Marchisio,3,Mon Jun 29 12:52:52 2015 UTC,"If teams didn't learn to handle specific play styles then the same team would consistently win, but that's not the case. No matter what style a team plays someone will always figure a way to defend it. It's just a matter of how long."
Barca,3bh61u,2015treble,2,Mon Jun 29 15:50:46 2015 UTC,"No that's a myth. Chelsea should have conceded 5 in those games, Inter beat us with a volcano, and Real lost again and again, even with plenty good luck in the Clasicos (escaping many red cards, scoring too often from set pieces, etc).   Give Neymar and Suarez to Guardiola, a second keeper who isn't Pinto, and have his Barca practice set pieces like Enrique's. They wouldn't lose a single game."
Barca,3bh61u,Marchisio,2,Mon Jun 29 16:39:47 2015 UTC,"While I completely agree that we could and should have gone farther, and that if Guardiola had some of the players that Enrique had at his dispense, teams were getting smarter and smarter against us as time went on (or dumber with a simple bus method). It can only last so long, that's just how it goes. It's inevitable, if nobody could beat it the game would just be boring. Everything has a cycle."

For total football to work, pressing is beneficial.  Jugodeposicion, If  total football means all those things then Pep's Barca lacked man-marking and Counter attacks for sure! I can still see Xavi calming the things down instead of launcing counter attacks.   one question: How do you rate Pep Guardiola 's  Rating policy?  I think Lucho has more plan B's and uses rotating policy adequately well. Pep thinks counter attacking is CRIME!"
Barca,3bh61u,EpicChiguire,2,Mon Jun 29 19:06:42 2015 UTC,"Well, Rakitic is 5 years older than Pogba, he played for an inferior team and I also think he was on his last year of contract."

Barca,3bh61u,SuperZero42,4,Mon Jun 29 17:23:49 2015 UTC,Fully agreed. If la masia is destroyed then we can kiss all our success goodbye.

Barca,3bhd9w,poetical_poltergeist,5,Mon Jun 29 06:01:00 2015 UTC,"Is there a 2nd ballot (I hope that's the correct word) ?  Because if Bartomeu is 35,7% Laporta - 27,5% and Benedito 2,3% that leaves us with 10,4% for other candidates. My logic is that if they already chose to vote for someone else, it also means they want a change so it's more likely they`ll vote for Laporta if their choice is narrowed down to him and Barto.  At least that's what I wanna think. Having this clown for another mandate is going to be a disaster."
Barca,3bhd9w,decho,7,Mon Jun 29 08:02:13 2015 UTC,"Bartomeu, on the other hand, has older members' votes as they see him as a more trustworthy candidate.   Have they missed the whole Neymar saga?  Anyway, apparently this survey was done between only 900 socis; so not the biggest sample size. It's really a shame that it is a Bartomeu-Laporta contest. I would've really liked to see Benedito or Farré get a shot.  Hopefully when the next elections come, we'll get Victor Font. Seems the perfect man for the job."

Younger soci might be more willing to risk changing the situation in the club, in the hopes of improving it.  (Some generalization of course, but made sense back then and makes sense now)  I am a soci, but I am not in Barcelona. Does anyone know if I can vote from afar?

Barca,3bhd9w,ManoloBar,2,Mon Jun 29 22:45:41 2015 UTC,No you cannot unfortunately. Only way you can vote is physically being there. One of Farré's changes is to incorporate online voting for socis.

Similar to how Samper is the second highest rated Champions League player for barca, even though he player one game, and everyone knows how promising he is.

Barca,3beppj,StopMakingScents,3,Sun Jun 28 23:03:15 2015 UTC,"Very tough to call, but at the very least start him against teams that cross the ball often for his height because Masch becomes a liability on crosses and Bartra has shown he is fantastic in the air similar to Puyol hence mini-puyol."
Barca,3beppj,FrostyGrass,2,Mon Jun 29 01:12:16 2015 UTC,"I think Bartra can be a much better center back than mascherano. at some point there will be a change, do we want that to start now or should we wait until bartra is 26 and lost out on playing time at a valuable developmental stage. Will playing Bartra cost us games? I doubt it. Imagine if puyol got his opportunities to play after he was 26 and after we paid 20million for a defender over the age of 30, and another 10 for one who was injured"

Barca,3behfp,Chillidawg,18,Sun Jun 28 13:59:02 2015 UTC,"Mathieu was a good purchase, although I would have preferred to see a bit more Bartra and a bit less Mathieu. We needed that extra man in the back and he provided everything we needed; height, speed and some attacking prowess as well.  Sometimes he was a bit shaky when he tried to clear the ball. He got the idea that every Barça player should be able to give the perfect through ball and he often overextended his own abilities; which led to some scary moments.  With a possible departure of Adriano, we might see him getting more minutes at the left back position as Alba's back-up; although I hope to see Grimaldo as much as possible of course."
Barca,3behfp,jklz,16,Sun Jun 28 14:22:01 2015 UTC,"For me it was a good signing for 20m. He came, adapted well and gave some great performances against top teams. I think he's one of those defenders that will be able to play beyond their 35. The only thing that bugs me is his chemistry with pique, I've always said it, but they both want to be number ones when attacking the ball.  They often go up together to clear a ball and don't alternate on who stays back and who attacks the man pressing forward.  But he has plenty of time left to get into rhythm."
Barca,3behfp,beastcat,6,Sun Jun 28 15:00:53 2015 UTC,I believe 20m was too high. 10-12 would've been perfect.
Barca,3behfp,EpicChiguire,5,Sun Jun 28 15:11:53 2015 UTC,think it was 16m that the club paid and 2 that Mathieu himself paid. No idea what the numbers got to with the bonus from winning though.
Barca,3behfp,IhateAngryBirds,10,Sun Jun 28 15:37:11 2015 UTC,"I think the price for him is justified, he was Valencias key defender. A starter to a top la liga side is not cheap. Plus he's able to play two roles."

Barca,3behfp,Duke--Nukem,11,Sun Jun 28 18:29:28 2015 UTC,"I think he started good, but his form dropped rapidly, and with Pique gaining his form back there was very little he could do as Mascherano was a beast this season as well.  I've said it multiple times (usually get downvoted damn you!), but I prefer Bartra over Mathieu, Bartra just seems more confident with the ball and contributes better to the offense a bit better than Mathieu has. Yes I know he scored a few goals, but Bartra made some awesome assists this season.  He should become a sub next season, to finally give Bartra a proper chance."

Barca,3behfp,-Ozkr,9,Sun Jun 28 16:50:01 2015 UTC,That header against Madrid?!?!  I thouht Mathieu was a great signing.  Quality CB with pace and height who can also be subbed on for Alba for a little more defensive stability in the late stage of games.
Barca,3behfp,Turn_off_the_Volcano,3,Sun Jun 28 15:18:16 2015 UTC,"My concern with him is not so much his defending as much as his distribution.  I'm sure if I looked at the numbers, they would show that he has a good pass completion rate, but I feel like he isn't able to look a pass ahead and often passes it to a person who is open, but in a poor position to pass the ball out to another player."
Barca,3behfp,NeuralLink,5,Sun Jun 28 20:37:50 2015 UTC,I think he was a fantastic purchase. Although I was very disappointed with our inability to get him a year earlier when he was offered to us for 12M. Despite the lack of hype surrounding him he has been one of the most consistent CB's in La Liga the past few years. He was one of the major reasons we didn't have major injury issues on the team. His ability to play multiple positions coupled with his defensive preowess meant that we could have him on regular rotation with both Mascherano and Alba while still maintaining good quality.We were in dire need of a left footed CB and he filled that role perfectly. Due to his age I don't see him hindering Bartra going forward and I think Bartra will get the playing time he deserves. despite this he did cause me to have a few ass clinching moments when he tried to play it out of the back.
Barca,3behfp,1culookin,5,Sun Jun 28 20:17:24 2015 UTC,Gave us some good moments but generally I don't think he's good enough for Barcelona. He's perfect for rotation agaisnt scrub teams though.
Barca,3behfp,urbeer,4,Sun Jun 28 15:15:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not pointing fingers at anyone, but it's quite a luxury for any of us to be even debating the quality of such a talented CB in our roster. Just think where we were one year ago. This guy has ball skill, speed, height, very decent positional awareness, and worth every penny if only for that absolute peach of a goal versus RM."
Barca,3behfp,xscientist,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:11:08 2015 UTC,"There have been so many ""wtf?"" moments about this guy. Like when we signed him I was like wtf.. and then I saw how fast he could run even at the age of 31 and I was like well shiit.. then I heard that he smokes cigs and I was like wtf? then he scored an absolute beauty of a free kick goal against Huesca and I was like WTF?? then he scored 2 vital goals back to back in la liga and I was like damn son... what the actual fuck mane."
Barca,3behfp,kostkeon,0,Tue Jun 30 06:34:14 2015 UTC,"I was happy when I knew we were getting a real CB, and even more because of what I had seen from him at Valencia. But throughout the season - meeeeh.  He scored two great, and very important goals. I am very thankful for that, but look away from that, has he been any good?  He always looks very insecure. His control is worrying, and so is his passing and chemistry with the other defenders. He often ends up bumping into teammates, something we don't see when he doesn't play. His height hasn't really helped us as we'd though, besides from those goals. When he comes in to secure a win etc., we often end up looking even more shaky.   He can also play LB, but he really doesn't suit the LB-role here at Barca as he did at Valencia. Doesn't have the control, agility, passing, stamina and creativity needed.  I may seem overly harsh on him, but he has been bang average at best. I'm not going to say he has been great, when he clearly haven't been. I feel way way way more secure with Bartra and Mascherano. And it's close to a fact that we're better with them.  He's 30/31, and we could've spent those 18/20m much much more wisely. He got us two important goals, which I am thankful for, but even without him, I'm still sure we would've gotten the treble. But that we'll never know for sure."
Barca,3behfp,flackohowyoubeen,0,Sun Jun 28 14:44:47 2015 UTC,Exactly what I've been saying this whole season. He doesn't seem to be at Barça's level.
Barca,3be2vu,viscaelbarca1899,27,Sun Jun 28 10:16:19 2015 UTC,"I like Pedro, I like the man and I like the player. But in all honesty, Pedro is going to be a super sub behind Neymar, Suarez and Messi when he could be starting games at a lot of other big name clubs.   Do I want him to stay? Ofcourse, I do. But if he decides to move on in search of greener pastures and more starts and playing time, Godspeed to him. Can't find a fault with that desire."
Barca,3be2vu,Deep_In_Thought,3,Sun Jun 28 11:55:21 2015 UTC,you worded this absolutely perfectly
Barca,3be2vu,T_Peg,2,Sun Jun 28 15:18:10 2015 UTC,You really don't know if he will be just as good for other teams. Look at Hleb. He was great for Arsenal but bad for us. Pedro knows the team and that makes him 33% better.
Barca,3be2vu,JurijFedorov,2,Sun Jun 28 13:34:52 2015 UTC,"You make a fair point but I never commented on whether he would be just as good or not. Yes, he's a perfect fit here and delivers. But that's Barca we're talking about here.      As a player who loves playing football, Pedro would want to play as much as he can. It's just a natural instinct when you love what you do and do what you love. So, it's only understandable if he'd like to make a move where he cab be a permanent fixture in the starring XI. Whether he's good there and rises to the occasion, albeit connected to the whole scenario, comes much later."
Barca,3be2vu,Deep_In_Thought,2,Sun Jun 28 13:59:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Hleb was bad for us, just not the focal point, and didn't control things in the final third for Barca, the way he did at Arsenal. He was amazing with the ball at his feet, but his finishing left us wanting. That's why I love Ivan so much, he does not care for all the fancy things, he is just the perfect, industrious box to box midfielder that we need next to the creativity of Iniesta. That's why I am baffeled about the Pogba thing... Who does he replace?"

He still is able to blow through the opponents with his dribbling and pace, but is generally clueless. He is not able to impact the game too nicely. It could be due to mismanagement but I think a loan would be better, to refine him. As a sub, I think he won't get enough play time to improve and excel. He needs playtime"
Barca,3be2vu,invice,3,Sun Jun 28 12:24:20 2015 UTC,he will only learn by playing with better players. That includes playing against our first team defenders in training.
Barca,3be2vu,ksalama,3,Sun Jun 28 14:50:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, but you have to remember that him getting around five to ten match's playtime this season is highly unlikely. I think that could be harmful. But you do state a really good point. It's just my opinion, and I know that its not fully correct, but I give priority to continuous playtime over wonderful training"
Barca,3be2vu,invice,2,Sun Jun 28 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"True i agree that continuos play time is needed to develop, but i think that rotations will be very important this season and if we dont have pedro then a combination of Adama+any of messi and Neymar/Suarez would do good for us in the games that arent against top of the table opponents. we Dont need to play our strongest lineups against the bottom half teams really, and he could start in most copa games for sure."
Barca,3be2vu,ksalama,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:10:49 2015 UTC,Not to mention constantly training with the first team will do wonders
Barca,3be2vu,IhateAngryBirds,9,Sun Jun 28 15:46:54 2015 UTC,You guys are really overestimating Adama because of his physical abilities. He needs more time to develop.
Barca,3be2vu,canti-,3,Sun Jun 28 16:12:26 2015 UTC,"Oh i completely agree that he relies too much on his physical abilities to get by oponents, but I dont see him developing that unless hes trainig and playing with the first team. I feel if he goes out on loan there may be a tendency for the team he goes to to want him for those attributes purely"

Barca,3be2vu,IhateAngryBirds,2,Sun Jun 28 12:07:24 2015 UTC,"Del got sent off the first few weeks by Lucho and then sent back to Barca from SEV after not playing much the second half of the season, right?  I don't understand everyone's fascination with him.  I think his attitude sucks and he seems like an asshole.  An asshole who doesn't play very much, but ""has great skills"" apparently."
Barca,3be2vu,cdrawesome,3,Sun Jun 28 14:53:46 2015 UTC,"I've watched Deulofeu since he was a kid, and what that kid is capable of is ridiculous.. With proper guidance, he would be/would've been able to become a star at Barça.  Personally I think Luis Enrique was the perfect guy for that (or Oscar Garcia, but he's not at the club). Unfortunately he didn't want to take the risk, which is understandable.  Anyway, it was just a little joke."
Barca,3be2vu,jklz,2,Sun Jun 28 20:43:03 2015 UTC,I don't why I flipped out about it so much - so let me apologize.  I guess I don't like the vibe Deulofeu gives.  Even from six time zones away it bugs me. I can't even describe why.  He seems a lot like Mario at Inter in 2010 - tons of talent but irks teammates and coaches in an unproductive way.  I dunno...
Barca,3be2vu,cdrawesome,3,Mon Jun 29 12:38:32 2015 UTC,"I just find all this talk of our club wanting to sign players, rather stupid. We have a transfer ban! Signing players and waiting for them to only play for us in Jan isn't the best sounding idea to me. I don't think the cub is that silly either. Yes Vidal did it but that's a one off case. We could use this season to allow the team to build even more chemistry. Suddenly mid way through the season adding more components and having to wait for that adjustment to take place, seems counter productive to me."
Barca,3be2vu,MobyGlitch,3,Sun Jun 28 12:36:58 2015 UTC,didn't pedro sign a new contract recently? what is his buyout amount?
Barca,3be2vu,leotipler,2,Sun Jun 28 13:39:55 2015 UTC,"Buyout fee is 150m, I think. But the renewal might have been just because his contract would've ran out in 2016, and that would lower his price. But there's just as big of a chance that he just wants to stay here.  We'll see."
Barca,3be2vu,flackohowyoubeen,4,Sun Jun 28 14:48:31 2015 UTC,"hmm if there only was an extremely talented homegrown player who could've played instantly, and play both LW & RW.  Oh wait, we sold him."

Him being more of a Yaya Touré type of player than a Xavi type of player? Didn't we already add a somewhat more physical and tall player with Rakitic?  The comparison with Yaya Touré and how apparently we miss Touré dearly, doesn't make a lot of sense to me.   There is not a player in the youth system remotely close to the former No. 6's level of vision and understanding of the game -- not even Sergi Roberto, Sergi Samper or the constantly talked about Alen Halilovic.   Ugh.."
Barca,3bdwh0,jklz,2,Sun Jun 28 10:26:53 2015 UTC,Makes no sense at all. Rakitic is already filling the nr 4 role better than I think Pogba ever could. As for a nr 6 role... Well Pogba isn't suited for that anyway. I'd rather we buy an actual Nr 6.

Iniesta is three year older than Arda and I think it's pretty much. Although the Spaniard has been absolut phenomenal in many years, no one can deny that he has declined a bit during the previous season.

Barca,3baxs6,_sic,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, You think that Bartomeu built our treble squad? Let’s go through each signing:  ter Stegen: had been scouted by FCB for years and was handpicked by Zubi to take over after Valdes left.  Rakitic: since Lucho was hired before our 13/14 season had ended, he asked Zubi to get the croatian. Lucho had received Tata’s warning about Cesc being a rotten apple, and wanted Rakitic.  Luis Suarez: signing the best 9 in the world doesn’t take much from a President. We needed money and Luis Enrique’s clear wish to sign him. So much so, Luis Enrique himself went to Liverpool to finalize the deal, and not Bartomeu.  Claudio Bravo: Lucho’s second in command, Unzue, specifically asked for Bravo. He wanted a more experienced keeper, and we got just that. Again, nothing to do with Bartomeu.  Douglas: A signing so strange it almost caused one of Zubi’s close assistants to be fired. It had to do with Traffic’s influence inside our club, and neither the coach or President were involved in such ridiculous signing.  Mathieu: Another direct wish from Luis Enrique. He wanted the French player, and we paid the 20mi euros to acquire him.  Vermaelen: Zubi was responsible from bringing a player he was told by doctors was already injured.  So, no. Signings the checks does not give any kind of credit to Bartomeu regarding our last signings. No one in their right minds say Laporta was responsible for signings players like Toure and Eto’o, so no one is gonna say Bartomey brought Luis Suarez.

When Zubi sucked, people tied him together with Bartomeu. Now that he came good, people say they had nothing to do with each other? Sure, Barto sacked him in the end cause he's a dickwad, but it doesn't change history.  Zubi was Rosell's Sporting Director. Everyone ties Bartomeu to Rosell as a point of criticism, so he gets Zubi too.  The board picked Zubi and Lucho. Those two did well, they reflect well on the board . Period.

I just meant that I don't think that this board had anything to do with sorting out the fight between Leo and Lucho(if any). A director who takes 9 months to renew Leo, who has votes taken to know if people want to sell Leo or not, and never EVER defends the guy in public, can't do such nice diplomatic settlement, involving Leo.  I am still of the opinion that our treble was due to players only, and Lucho to some extent. The signings were important, but the players  are the main heroes here."
Barca,3baxs6,invice,4,Sat Jun 27 17:11:42 2015 UTC,"Well Xavi was the main peacemaker, IIRC, and he was there because the club convinced him to stay. And the other ""heroes"" wouldn't be there if they weren't signed in the first place or had their contracts renewed. So yeah, despite many mistakes, they got that part right."
Barca,3baxs6,_sic,6,Sat Jun 27 17:51:52 2015 UTC,"I have no agenda against this board. Please understand that I do not like this board. I know what they have done correctly, but their screw ups are unforgivable to me. I can't let them off for that just because they did one thing okayish. And IIRC, Lucho convinced Xavi to stay, though my sources are just rumors and random articles."
Barca,3baxs6,invice,6,Sat Jun 27 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"I can't let them off for that just because they did one thing okayish.   Building a treble winning squad is ""okayish""? That's a pretty high standard you have there.  Edit: In general, I don't really care for this board either, but I believe that credit should be given when it's due."
Barca,3baxs6,_sic,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:19:31 2015 UTC,"Okay sir. Sorry. The board is stupendously amazing to bestow upon us this treble winning squad brought with Qatar's money, getting us banned in the transfer window, continuing shady deals, to build a treble winning squad. Bartomeu's intellectual prowess and brilliance can be seen in the way the man has excellently managed us, and I hope that he gets one more chance to fuck us up all over again. Happy?"
Barca,3baxs6,invice,0,Sat Jun 27 17:21:50 2015 UTC,"I'm totally agree with you. Yes, Barto and his friends may have a little bit ""contribution"", but they made so much SHITSHOW that made all staffs & players & fans suffer so hard. I'm so surprised at how quickly people forget about Barto's shit show and just say ""HEY WE JUST WON TREBLE! THANKS TO BATROMEU AND HIS BOARD!"""
Barca,3baxs6,opop8989,2,Sat Jun 27 17:25:14 2015 UTC,"And I am actually afraid that they will elect him again only due to this reason. People should have it clearly in their mind that we won the treble despite the board, not because of the board"

Barca,3baxs6,xFragg,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:33:09 2015 UTC,"Neymar, Suárez and MESSI won the treble, period. Had one of them not played this season we would most likely not won anything. The msn was that crucial.  As for the board, it fucking scares me that some of you guys defend them in any way."
Barca,3baxs6,zenkyoto,0,Sat Jun 27 14:51:47 2015 UTC,"Cheap politicians bullshit. Every success, whether it is goal, won match or the season treble, every single one of those successes is a team effort. No player can regularly score if he does not have a good support from other players. No team can regularly win if the players and coach does not work well together. And no club can win treble if they have lousy management and bad relationship between the president, coaching staff and the players."
Barca,3bbf9x,Dark-X,16,Sat Jun 27 16:44:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't know why the media is set on us signing someone big this summer. At this point in time, we don't need any other big players. If we do sign a star, there will be conflicts over who's starting and where. What we need right now is squad depth, especially in the midfield and maybe LB if Adriano leaves."
Barca,3bbf9x,BrennantheGamer,15,Sat Jun 27 17:15:16 2015 UTC,"It's not really the media, It's Bartomeu. He knows that bringing in a 'superstar' even though it might not be the right player will sway voters into voting for him. It's a strategic move for the coming elections, not at all sportingwise.  I really hope we don't sign either Pogba or Turan. Koke is what we need.. a player who makes the team play, not someone who hogs on onto the ball too much."
Barca,3bbf9x,tadm123,6,Sat Jun 27 19:28:49 2015 UTC,"If they manage to get Pogba for a good price i think we will be stronger next few seasons, he can bring another play style to our midfield and i can see him switch with Iniesta because the season is long and full of matches, one injury or two and we are screwed ^"

So a fully justified yellow card, Messi didn't even complain about it either. And the ref was awesome too, didn't take any shit from all of these diving divas and made football how it was supposed to be played yesterday.

But Mascherano played an amazing game and made some vital interceptions.   Messi's willingness to drive the ball forward is just a joy to watch.   He gets tackled, punched etc but he dribbles his way up the field and gives the ball to the side. The players who get the ball from Messi SHOULD NOT just cross it mindlessly! Fuckers don't take into consideration how difficult it was for Messi to bring the ball to their feet. They should square it back and keep passing and not just cross it there time after time."

Barca,3b9fxq,invice,6,Sat Jun 27 07:07:44 2015 UTC,yeah said a guy who is a Christiano fan
Barca,3b9fxq,mekane84,3,Sat Jun 27 10:04:22 2015 UTC,"The guy is nuts. Says that Busquets is not a good passer, and makes things difficult, all the while criticizing Messi for chipping Neuer when he could have had a ground shot. Talking out of his ass, I presume. And all this is in his last five - six comments, so I don't think he knows what he s talking about."
Barca,3b9fxq,invice,-4,Sat Jun 27 12:08:16 2015 UTC,"Says that Busquets is not a good passer,    no, i said he is a good passer, but nothing special, like Xavi or Iniesta, for example.   all the while criticizing Messi for chipping Neuer when he could have had a ground shot   I didn't criticize him, I said a ground shot might have been easier, since Neuer was standing on his feet.  usually you chip the keeper when he goes to ground.  Neuer was not fooled.  I'm so glad you can change everything I say though, thanks for being a little bitch."
Barca,3b9fxq,mekane84,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:54:20 2015 UTC,"Busquets is the best one touch passer I have ever seen. Period. There is no one who is better at just touching the ball once and making it go in any direction at any speed in a second. His quick passing and the ""tiki taka"" that he did with Xavi Iniesta and Messi involve really quick and controlled passing, at a high level, especially when done against teams like Real Madrid. So yeah, to say that he is only a decent passer is a huge understatement in my opinion.  The ground shot part I brought in only because you seem to be able to criticize Messi on any thing he does. ""Why did he do this? Why didn;t he go for the obvious way?"" In the rush of the moment, players don;t sit down to contemplate what the best move could be. The striker's instinct kicks in, and they do whatever their impulse and their training has taught them. To criticize that, you must mean to say that Messi is an idiot to go for the chip. You saw that clip thousands of times and then came to the decision. Messi had fraction of seconds to decide. To criticize someone even when he has done something good is just idiotic, and reminds me of some butthurt Messi hater.  I do accept that whatever I said was not exactly similar to what you said, but it conveys what you wanted to express. You said that Busquets is someone whom you can't understand all the hype about. That statement, coming from a Barca fan is sacrilegious for me. You need to understand the game to understand Busquets, and if you call him for something that he is really really good at, then yes I am going to become a little bitch. How does Busquets make things difficult? Give me some examples. I wanna know."
Barca,3b9fxq,invice,-1,Sat Jun 27 17:14:07 2015 UTC,"Xavi is a way better one touch passer, its not even close in fact.  I think there are a bunch of players on the spanish national team who have outstanding passing ability, and Busquets to me doesn't stick out as better than any of them, that's why I question why he gets so much credit for it.  Sure he's a really good passer, but amongst his peers he doesn't stand out to me, maybe he gets more credit just because he's in a position that receives the ball more, I don't know.  I don't get what this discussion is about, the chip worked, it was a fine play, i am not criticizing him, but it doesn't stick out to me as an amazing finish or anything, its difficult to execute, but most elite strikers should be scoring from there, probably with a ground shot. i never said messi was an idiot lol.  i am not a messi hater, in fact he's the reason i started following soccer from when i saw him in the olympics, i just think he is far from perfect with his decision making and finishing, although i realize these are unfavorable opinions, especially around here.  his dribbling though is absolutely insane.  I am a fan of the club, but I don't have to think every player is that great, and I love discussing players and tactics, even if I don't have good things to say about them."

Nobody can do that. At Barcelona, he practices every day for hours, plays multiple games per week, and is surrounded by immense talent.

Our attacking lineup is stacked and it seems that Pedro is sticking around. He won't get enough minutes and Enrique seems to favor Sandro and Munir over him.   Let him play for Martinez for a season or two, hopefully he can straighten out his downfalls and capitalize on his strengths and he can turn into the player he has been touted to be for years now, then buy him back.   It's a win/win in my opinion. He hasn't shown yet that he deserves to be here or that he's of the quality that is required to succeed at Barca, unfortunately."

There are only going to be a handful of players on Barca B at any given time that grow to be good enough to crack the first team and it is usually in their mid 20's.
Barca,3b70on,Ginigami,19,Fri Jun 26 14:11:01 2015 UTC,"Really hard decision. It's the same problem Chelsea had last season. 2 keepers who are both too good to be benched.

Barca,3b70on,fleamarketguy,10,Fri Jun 26 15:08:29 2015 UTC,"IMO, Chelsea handled it terribly. They drove Cech away, and he's about to join Arsenal. I'm hoping that never happens to us."

Cech is a Chelsea legend. Chelsea mistreated one of their legends so that he wanted to leave because of lack of minutes after one season. Imagine if we were to have done that to Xavi. It's one of the reasons people don't want to buy Pogba because it may then happen to Iniesta."
Barca,3b70on,srujayk,5,Sat Jun 27 01:57:15 2015 UTC,"I think Bravo is better right now.  He makes fewer mistakes and is a better ball stopper.  Ter Stegen was immense vs. Bayern though, games where distribution is important (high press teams), he will probably be the better choice."

We're blessed to have such great keepers in our squad, I can't think of another team who has this luxury.  ter Stegen is the future. He needs to get more minutes slowly, it was great for him to play the CL but I think he should start getting more minutes in the league as he adapts and gets older. If not this season, then next season he should be our #1.  I don't want him to get fed up due to a lack of playing time and cause a fuss, lose confidence, or leave. He doesn't seem like that type of guy, but some can only handle the second fiddle position for so long."

If you read out what I wrote you would see I am saying you cannot bench anybody arbitrarily, that you have to let their performance give you a reason to do something.  edit: my hypothetical veteran says ""regardless of performance"" meaning someone could be benched if they are performing well just arbitrarilu because people want MaTS starting.  A bit like how ancelotti was handcuffed into a specfic formation and handcuffed into always starting the BBC by his superiors."
Barca,3b70on,elanciano31,-1,Fri Jun 26 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"Easiest solution is to let them switch. Ter Stegen plays the league matches, Bravo gets the UCL and Copa. If one of them falters, merely plug the other one back in."
Barca,3b70on,YoSoyMilkChocolate,8,Fri Jun 26 20:10:59 2015 UTC,"I think they should switch, so Bravo would play CL and La Copa and Ter Stegen La Liga. That way each of them would have the opportunity to win the title that they couldn't this past season (let's remember that Bravo didn't win the CL according to UEFA) and Ter Stegen would get more matches, which should prepare him to be Barça's first goalkeeper the next decade.   But it is a bless that we have the chance to discuss this due to both keepers' level; both can be in the starting 11, something that hasn't happened in Barça since (IMHO) both Ruud Hesp and Vitor Baia were both capable of being the main keeper."
Barca,3b70on,frasier_crane,9,Fri Jun 26 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"I think that's the ideal. They switch for the 15/16 season, and then for 16/17 Ter Stegen becomes the main keeper in both Liga and CL, and Bravo either leaves or accepts just CdR."
Barca,3b70on,egcg119,7,Fri Jun 26 17:53:35 2015 UTC,You act like its a guarantee that Bravo will lose form  He was fantastic last season and I pray he keeps improving to make this decision tough for years to come  It will also motivate ter Stegen
Barca,3b70on,zrizzoz,6,Fri Jun 26 19:11:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think Bravo will lose form, I think Ter Stegen will continue to improve. He's improved over the course of the season, and his ceiling is much higher than Bravo's. What MaTS offers at the back in terms of passing is unique, gives us such an extra dimension. And he's ready. That's why I think he'll become #1 sooner rather than later."
Barca,3b70on,egcg119,3,Fri Jun 26 19:33:20 2015 UTC,"If ter Stegen can learn how to dominate his box like Bravo does, then he will have to be our number one. But he was further behind Bravo in that area this season than Bravo was from him in terms of passing. We'll see.   I really like both our keepers."
Barca,3b70on,_sic,5,Sat Jun 27 10:01:03 2015 UTC,"IMO Ter Stegen has a key attribute that makes him better than Bravo for Barca: his passing, he has an incredible skill for playing the ball from behind which helps the team come out from intense pressure by the other squad. Even Messi said he was better than him at passing (obviously a joke, but quite a pat on the back from D10S himself).   Barca must not risk losing him. Bravo is also an incredible keeper, and we're lucky for having them both after Valdes (thanks Zubizarreta), but in two years Stegen should be our main keeper, and probably Bravo will choose to leave."
Barca,3b70on,yes_that_too,3,Fri Jun 26 20:09:46 2015 UTC,"This is a very tough situation. Both keepers are amazing. Honestly, they should just keep it the way things were last season just for one more season. That's how we won everything. Next year, Ter Stegen will probably take more minutes. With Bravo, if he wants to go, he should go. He deserves a starting position in a world class club. But he's happy at Barca, and if he wants to stay, nobody should complain."
Barca,3b70on,jdloyola,3,Fri Jun 26 15:44:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can keep things as they are, ter Stegen said multiple times that he's not happy only playing cup games."

Barca,3b70on,jdloyola,2,Fri Jun 26 16:18:41 2015 UTC,"Ter Stegen the Liga and UCL, and Bravo the copa. Ter Stegen has world best potential and he needs to play as much as possible. After a year of learning the language and getting used to the step up to a big club he is and should be our undisputed number 1."
Barca,3b70on,ksalama,5,Fri Jun 26 20:56:56 2015 UTC,"I would give Champions to Ter Stegen, Copa del Rey to Bravo and split la Liga between the two."
Barca,3b70on,polechi33,12,Fri Jun 26 16:30:46 2015 UTC,"Splitting La Liga is a horrible idea. Winning La Liga is all about consistency, if you're changing keepers every week it not only screws them up, but the defenders as well."
Barca,3b70on,egcg119,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:54:22 2015 UTC,"Well I never said it should be split in halves, and also there are not many ways around. Ter Stegen won't be happy with giving Champions League to Bravo. So Bravo get Copa and Ter Stegen keeps the Champions. So what would you do with la Liga? If you want two top golies you need to play them both or one will end up leaving you. You can't expect a good golie just to warm the bench.   I agree that the more a golie plays, the better. But if  you want two top golies, you need to slipt the playing time. Proof that it works can be seen with Ter Stegen, in Copa and the Champions he was playing every 2-3 weeks and did just fine."
Barca,3b70on,polechi33,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:07:09 2015 UTC,Better idea is to let them switch altogether. Ter Stegen gets the league and Bravo gets UCL and Copa.

Barca,3b70on,_sic,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:58:12 2015 UTC,"Everyone is optimistic about Ter Stegen and I'm too, but I really hope he keeps improving his concentration. He made two important mistakes, in the final of la copa and the final of the CL, that could've costed us the treble. Nothing happened so we are all happy, but had those mistakes ended up in goals we could be crucifying him right now.  Just saying"
Barca,3b70on,godie,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:45:30 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think so. Bravo is great, but he's not much of a long term option for us. Ter Stegen is young and the only thing he needs to go from ""great"" to ""world class"" is more experience/confidence. I don't feel like that's going to happen if he doesn't get any time in the league.  But they're both great, so it's not as if I'll be disappointed if Lucho keeps going with what he's been doing. It's working for us for now."
Barca,3b6rdb,brocccoli,7,Fri Jun 26 12:43:37 2015 UTC,"For the last match against Jamaica Argentina were poor. Even Messi admitted that they slowed down during the second half.

We have shown that the best way to do that is to have possession,"" said Javier Mascherano at a press conference before Friday's match against Colombia. Mascherano, along with Leo Messi, is one of the keys to success for Argentina. ""We have a strategy and try to carry it out. There are rivals who give you possession and you have to find a way to attack them, and there are others that make that tough. I think Colombia will try to provoke us, maybe by pressing upfield, but surely they will not let us play comfortably,"" the Barça midfielder explained.  Falcao dangerous  Although he is not in top form, Radamel Falcao remains one of the most dangerous strikers in the tournament, a fact that was highlighted by Mascherano. ""Falcao is the best forwards you can find and it's just a matter of time until he really shows up.""  Different football  Rough play and contact have been in the spotlight in this year's Copa América, but for Mascherano and Argentina this is not uncharted territory. ""The South American game is played differently, more contact is allowed. We grew up with this style of play and we are used to it, so we have to readapt and not let up at any time,"" he said."
Barca,3b6rdb,Jelboo,3,Fri Jun 26 12:44:31 2015 UTC,Messi did fucking everything he could. If Argentina lose on penalties in a while it will be another tournament where Messi is let down by his team mates. Or at least the forwards on his team.

Barca,3b66nb,tiagom0702,23,Fri Jun 26 12:38:09 2015 UTC,He is the reason I started watching Barca after the world cup under 20 in 2005. I saw him play in my home country when he was still an unpolished diamond. I've been in awe of him ever since. He turned me into a barca fan and now I love the club as much as i love him. The joy he gives me watching barca is incredibly important to me and there are very few things i prioritise over watching Barca and Messi. It all started with this incredible little man in 2005.   I've been planning to visit barca at the end of this summer to fulfill a longtime dream.
Barca,3b66nb,Entrepreneutralizer,11,Fri Jun 26 09:58:05 2015 UTC,"I probably have used all the adjectives I know to describe Lionel Messi and my words probably will have similar vibe while talking about him but anyway I'll try to say something about his '14-'15 season.   '13-'14 season didn't go that well for Messi. He suffered a grade 3 hamstring injury while playing against Real Betis that sent him off the pitch for approximately 8 weeks before he could recover in that season and this injury took its toll on his performance; but he worked his way up and in '14-'15 season we all witnessed Messi at his deadly form.  Barça's offense after the inclusion of Suarez has become a fierce force in European football but Messi still showed continuously throughout the season that even if Messi is somehow denied to score by the the opponent defense, he will still contribute/orchestrate the the attacks from which goals have been scored.   We all have witnessed how Messi's single moment of brilliance can change the direction of the game in favor of Barça. Messi possesses such ability to destroy a rival single-handedly and this is something I really like about him. My most favorite moment of Messi from '14-'15 season is Messi's second goal against Bayern in the first leg of UCL semi-final (our whole team played great but the result of that match was pretty much decided by Messi alone) but his stellar solo goal against Athletic Bilbao in the CDR final is a pleasure to watch too.    Messi just celebrated his 28th birthday and hopefully he will continue to play really great for at least four or five years."

He is in the very small and unique catagory of athletes across all sports. He is up there with the likes of Pelé, Michael Jordan, Maradona, the list goes on. What all these players have in common is the fact that they punctuate a generation, their own generation in which they are the focal point, in their respective sport. It's one of these generations where they can look back and say ""Yeah. I set the bar for all the other athletes to try and surpass. I was the one to beat when I played.""  The fact that we have one of these athletes in our team is really mindblowing. People can say whatever they want about Messi only being human, yeah, he is, but there's no denying the fact that when Messi is on the pitch it's like you've activated a cheat code in a game, the scales ultimately switch in favor of whatever team he plays for.  Messiah is still in his prime and I feel ever so blessed to be able to witness this man play throughout the season, year in & year out."

Barca,3b66nb,justafanpassingby,9,Sat Jun 27 16:34:05 2015 UTC,"I dont want to be that guy but it has to be said just one more time. I know Ronaldo's goalscoring record was insane but even then i dont think the distance between him and Messi has been this big in a long time.   Before, the biggest argument/criticism Messi (understandably) got was that he would be less effective without Iniesta and Xavi. My God has he blown that criticism to dust particles this season, this man is playing as well as ever without those two and has unmatched influence in every aspect of our attack. Whats crazy to me is that he can be on the field with absolutely world class talent like against Bayern or City this season and STILL look miles ahead of everyone. This season was AT LEAST on par with 2010/2011 as his greatest ever.  His 5 season-defining games in my opinion:   La Liga Vs Atletico at home: He was already picking up his trademark performances around November but this was the game that finally made me go ""holy shit, he's back."" Messi played like an angry man, like he had something to prove. He was everywhere that night and it was the first time we got to see the new RW position being used at full force. That was the first time i ever saw Messi play like he wanted to make his opponents cry and it was incredible to watch. La Liga Vs Bilbao away: I believe this was Messi's best playmaking performance. It epitomized everything about his new role on the team and even though he only scored once through a lucky deflection, he STILL looked like the best player on the field by a mile. This performance was interesting because the rest of the team was scoring beautiful goals but it was Messi who was by far the most exciting. Champions League vs City at home: This will go down as one Messi's best performances ever, once again, without even scoring. Three disgusting megs, an assist, and plenty of mouth-watering passes and dribbles in between. He made the second best team in England look like school boys by himself. Copa Del Rey vs Bilbao: This deserves to be on here because of THAT goal. One of the best of his career and surely the best in any Copa final ever. This was vintage Messi, pulling a goal out of nowhere starting from half field. I watched this goal AT LEAST 1000 times and it still hasnt gotten old. I remember people wondering on r/soccer if he was ever gonna start scoring those magical dribble goals again. Well, here you go. And i'm willing to bet there's more where that came from Champions League vs Bayern at home: i wont write anything here. This performance was nothing short of courageous, heroic, and legendary. Just go watch the highlights."
Barca,3b66nb,DivineVibrations,6,Fri Jun 26 17:16:19 2015 UTC,"How do you feel this player have performed throughout the season?   What can I say, just when I thought I could not be any more impressed by a his abilities, humility, or generosity, Messi went and blew me away.  I would describe his performance this season as decisive, flexible, focused, consistent, and beautiful.  Two quotes by journalists from this season come to mind, ""Messi is both the backbone and the brand of Barcelona,"" and ""Messi is the spiritual leader of his team.""   Where do you see this player in the upcoming years?   I think we all expect him to evolve into a Xavi/Pirlo type of midfielder, using his amazing vision and passing to control the plays and pace of matches.  But really, who knows. If you had asked me even a year ago what he would be like this year, none of what he has done would have occurred to me  -- including big things, like playing two new positions at once, or little ones like doubling his headers, right foot goals, and balls won back.   What was this player's best moments this season?   Ha ha, I made a whole post about this, which you very kindly linked to.  Two of my favorite non-playing moments were when he spoke on BarcaTV about the ""crisis"" in January (for those who missed it, here is a humorous but insightful article about the whole thing plus a video of his interview) and when he spoke to the fans during the treble celebration.  He is showing more of his leadership.   What are your favorite aspects of this player?   So many, but I think one thing worth mentioning is his work this season on supporting Neymar and helping him develop as a player, and maybe even as a person."

Barca,3b6k4a,Football_Enthusiast,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:55:42 2015 UTC,At that case I'd recommend the presence of the red vertical stripes in the theme and also the hue adjustment for the yellow color should slightly be mild than the real yellow used on our away shirt so it would be a bit easy on eyes.   But I think of r/barca as the home of Barça fans on reddit so I believe if the new theme has to be based on the shirt design then we should go for the home kit.   However I wouldn't mind other design ideas apart from decorating our subreddit solely based on the shirt design.
Barca,3b6k4a,Andman22,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:39:53 2015 UTC,We could ask the guys over at r/realmadrid how they make room to display all of their recent trophies?  Edit: I guess nobody gets a joke.
Barca,3b6k4a,PanchDog,9,Fri Jun 26 15:14:35 2015 UTC,So hyped for the Argentina v Colombia game tonight. I got money on Argentina so I need the little genius to put in a good shift.   But I'll be happy for whoever wins tbh. I like this Colombian team.   Chile scraped a win against Uruguay. That's my squad and I hope we do well but I just don't see it. Either way the Copa is about to get spicey.
Barca,3b6k4a,Ginigami,3,Fri Jun 26 12:52:25 2015 UTC,"I think like all the big games so far, it's gonna disappoint us. Hopeful tho"
Barca,3b6k4a,PanchDog,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:09:37 2015 UTC,Yeah big games often disappoint. Not just in the Copa. I think it's because expectations are too high.   But it's the quarters and I feel like these two teams are gonna put their lives on the line.
Barca,3b6k4a,Rexxigg,6,Fri Jun 26 19:10:13 2015 UTC,Does anyone know when will the schedule for next season be revealed?
Barca,3b6k4a,invice,8,Fri Jun 26 11:47:51 2015 UTC,First week of July. Fourth iirc
Barca,3b6k4a,Rexxigg,3,Fri Jun 26 11:54:52 2015 UTC,Thank you.
Barca,3b6k4a,XsTream23,3,Fri Jun 26 12:03:41 2015 UTC,"anybody watching copa america game of argentina?  god, i dont think ive seen a worse refereeing this tournament..."
Barca,3b6k4a,YoSoyMilkChocolate,4,Sat Jun 27 01:13:48 2015 UTC,The officiating is awful. Even the Liga refs aren't this bad. They would have given a penalty at least.
Barca,3b6k4a,SuperZero42,8,Mon Jun 29 01:44:08 2015 UTC,"I like Sergi Roberto, and I hope he stays long enough to get a real chance at the club. I know he's not what the majority of you wanted him to be, but not everyone can score a hat trick in their first Clásico at 19 years old. Roberto has been loyal to our club, which has only given him 29 (first team) liga caps in ~5 years. He deserves a chance to be in the starting XI for the first half of the new season. If he doesn't work out in those 5 months, we'll have January to fix it.  Edit: Corrected a statistic."
Barca,3b6k4a,zizzor23,9,Fri Jun 26 14:58:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think he deserves to be in the starting 11, maybe given some more minutes but there is no way I think we should drop Rakitic (or Iniesta) for Roberto. If he develops the right way, he could be that Xavi-type player who is subbed on later in the match in order to help maintain control."
Barca,3b6k4a,SuperZero42,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:06:48 2015 UTC,"More rotation then? Even if it's coming off the bench more, or playing the weekend games before a big CL or CdR game when Rakitic or Iniesta need rest."
Barca,3b6k4a,emasterman,4,Fri Jun 26 18:50:50 2015 UTC,I don't even think pogba would be in our starting XI nevermind sergi
Barca,3b6k4a,egcg119,3,Fri Jun 26 18:07:05 2015 UTC,"Roberto has been in the first team for what, 3 years? 3 different coaches? He is nowhere near good enough. Whenever he's played as a CM, he's been thoroughly mediocre. Not terrible, just decent, recycling the ball and running a lot but that's it.  As a DM, he actually played pretty well under Lucho. But what's the point, when we have Busquets, Masch, and Samper?  He is not owed anything, nor does he need to become something he's not. He's a decent player who will provide an extra body for another year, and by 2016 will move to a smaller club where he can be a starter.  You're creating a false dichotomy by saying he's not Messi. The choices are not Messi or bust. It's that he has less talent than Rafinha, Samper, Denis Suarez, and Halilovic. I'm not against him playing, but pretending he's going to surpass any of them if he is just given a ""real chance"" is just delusion."
Barca,3b6k4a,Mentosfruitcore,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:16:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He will get his final chance this season, and if he remains at his current level, a move next summer will be inevitable, considering how many other prospects that need to be given a chance."
Barca,3b6k4a,ir7425,2,Mon Jun 29 13:58:25 2015 UTC,"I think he has 50+ caps. This season he has 18 appearances, last season, he had similar number too."
Barca,3b6k4a,SuperZero42,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:51:03 2015 UTC,"My apologies, you're right. Wiki's ""quick facts"" doesn't include CL or CdR appearances. He has 53 caps in total, 14 this season and 27 last season."
Barca,3b6k4a,-Token,4,Sun Jun 28 17:04:03 2015 UTC,"What do you guys think of the likelihood of Rafinha, Samper, Barta and Sergi Roberto getting more minutes next season? I'd like to think they'll be getting some more playing time but for players like Sergi Roberto it's got to be do or die for him. Don't see him staying past 25 if his minutes don't pick up."
Barca,3b6k4a,jklz,6,Fri Jun 26 15:11:37 2015 UTC,"We at least get a few more matches with the Supercups and the CWC, so they have that going for them.  I think that Luis Enrique will feature the young players more, now that he has successfully passed his first season. It was too risky for him to start playing the kids if that meant not winning the trophies we did (watch what happened to Tata; even though that wasn't youth related).  I think they'll play more, hopefully Grimaldo too if Adriano leaves."
Barca,3b6k4a,YoSoyMilkChocolate,2,Fri Jun 26 18:41:14 2015 UTC,IMO Bartra has to take over Mascherano's role full time.
Barca,3b6k4a,Ploxyy,4,Mon Jun 29 01:44:52 2015 UTC,"I'm about to buy the new away jersey ( since I don't like the horizontal stripes on the home one ).   I buy a jersey every year but this time I really can't decide who's name I should put on it. I was thinking about Pique, Busquets and Neymar. ( Since I have 4 messi's )  Who should I put on it? :)"
Barca,3b6k4a,YoSoyMilkChocolate,2,Sat Jun 27 10:48:40 2015 UTC,"Iniesta or if you want to be bold, Rakitic.  I'm getting my first kit soon. Which year and which of these three should I get: Messi, Iniesta, Suárez? I'm leaning towards Leo at the moment."
Barca,3b6k4a,Mentosfruitcore,2,Mon Jun 29 01:40:03 2015 UTC,Leo is the obvious choice tbh.
Barca,3b6k4a,YoSoyMilkChocolate,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:59:46 2015 UTC,Which year's though?
Barca,3b6k4a,xPhoenix-918x,7,Wed Jul 1 07:08:20 2015 UTC,who would you rather have in the team: suarez or aguero?
Barca,3b6k4a,bricebru22,29,Fri Jun 26 12:52:08 2015 UTC,Suarez 100%. His off ball movement and work rate is unmatched. He frees up space for Messi and Neymar while being a huge goal scoring threat himself. Best #9 in the world.
Barca,3b6k4a,PanchDog,5,Fri Jun 26 13:55:14 2015 UTC,Plus Aguero gets injured way more often then Suarez.
Barca,3b6k4a,xPhoenix-918x,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:31:14 2015 UTC,"as good as suarez has been part of me is curious at what would happen if barca bought aguero instead last summer, the only reason man city beat bayern in group stage at the etihad was aguero.  i also think a part me feels sorry for my mates from liverpool, they lost an such an influential player at a club i respect, while city are like chelsea, an ok team that got a fuck tonne of cash from shady sources"
Barca,3b6k4a,ohpuic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:04:50 2015 UTC,I loved how Suarez hounded Pirlo in the UCL final.
Barca,3b6k4a,pepetrillvia,10,Wed Jul 1 20:34:09 2015 UTC,"Suárez. Agüero definitely has a lot to offer in terms of his ability and his pre established connection with Messi, but there is not a single player on the world that has the same combination of drive, craziness and passion that Suárez brings to the table. Suárez was so important in energizing the front line and I don't think agüero could do it the same way."
Barca,3b6k4a,Rezasaurus,5,Fri Jun 26 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"Before seeing Suarez playing for Barca, I wanted Aguero. Now Suarez 100%. Fit into the team seamlessly, as if he watched us play and figured out best way to integrate."
Barca,3b6k4a,jl8912,4,Fri Jun 26 23:02:01 2015 UTC,suarez. he isn't injury prone and he scores more/assists more. it's not even comparable.
Barca,3b6k4a,YoSoyMilkChocolate,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:21:14 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter really. They're honestly equal in terms of skill. Suárez is bigger and gives you more aerial presence while Agüero has better acceleration and movement. Difference is Suárez can actually stay healthy for long periods of time.
Barca,3b6k4a,svefnpurka,3,Mon Jun 29 01:47:45 2015 UTC,2 weeks off at the end of July for me. Considering going somewhere within Europe for the second week.  Then I will take another two weeks of in October/November to bisit a friend in Malaysia and go somehete else.  Can't wait!

Barca,3b6k4a,kostkeon,3,Sat Jun 27 12:59:53 2015 UTC,"It's similar to how we had Neymar - Messi - Sanchez/Pedro. At first we were dominating early in the season under Tata, but after we apparently had less possession against Rayo people were 'crucifying him'.  Still that was Barca, this is Argentina - this time he has complete control and his tactics are piss poor. Meaningless possession, occasionally caught out on the counterattack, and useless crossing.  Oh and the one thing that angers me the most, useless subs/late subs."
Barca,3b6k4a,YoSoyMilkChocolate,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:29:02 2015 UTC,"I for one think Tata is doing fairly well. I mean Argentina are playing well, it's just for some reason they can't finish at all. Like the Colombia game should've gone at least 2-0 to Argentina. Other games as well where Argentina only emerge victorious with a single goal. The only forward who seems like he knows what he's doing is Messi obviously. Di Maria has gone from terrible to decent since the beginning of the tournament, but he does have those incredible moments here and there. Aguero has not really impressed for a striker of his caliber, hoping for Tevez to start against Paraguay. The midfield is great though, I don't know why Tata insists on starting Biglia 'cause I think he's pretty mediocre and Banega should be out there. Anyways, reaching the semis in Copa America is no small feat and although I expect some more out of Tata, I can say I'm satisfied with his team so far."

Barca,3b6w33,Duke--Nukem,11,Fri Jun 26 14:02:30 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be a bad idea to invest in a utility midfield player who is capable of filling in for Iniesta or Rakitic as a sub or starting when necessary, for example Gundogan, Kovacic or Oliver Torres. I'm just a bit worried about Iniesta over the next few seasons as he's been less consistent and getting older. However, a Pogba is exactly the opposite of what I think is needed right now.  Also, totally agree on your second statement. How many promises have been made that haven't been kept and how many people does this influence over another more capable, honest candidate..."
Barca,3b6w33,Marchisio,2,Fri Jun 26 14:23:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know why but I believe that next season, Iniesta will turn on god mode again.  the coming season he'll be fitter and less exhausted. If he can avoid injuries, he'll be great for us.  But as you said, we probably should sign a ""utility midfielder"" to have some depth. Denis Suarez might not come back next season."
Barca,3b6w33,Duke--Nukem,2,Fri Jun 26 14:31:03 2015 UTC,"I sure hope he does, he's shown he's still briliiant in big games, just not as often as we're used to.

Barca,3b6w33,Marchisio,2,Fri Jun 26 14:38:57 2015 UTC,Oliver Torres.   Atlético said that they're counting for Oliver in the up-coming season so I think Barca won't be able to sign him.

Barca,3b6w33,-Ozkr,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:05:14 2015 UTC,PLEASE NO. He said we wants to leave Atletico because Simeone makes them run too much. We need a midfielder with 1 on 1 potential and with the potential to be able to defend and attack. Arda Turan is not the guy we need.
Barca,3b4k5n,Illegal_sal,33,Thu Jun 25 22:28:43 2015 UTC,"Jordi is still so young and good, it really makes me wonder what's going to happen with Grimaldo. He has bags of ability, shame he isn't a rb."
Barca,3b4k5n,broad_h2o,15,Fri Jun 26 00:23:50 2015 UTC,"We're gonna need him if Adriano leaves, which is likely. He's getting old and wants for play time, which is understandable, so that's where Grimaldo comes in, at least for now."
Barca,3b4k5n,canadian028,6,Fri Jun 26 01:14:43 2015 UTC,"That's true, but that is a short term solution. In the long term, I can't see Alex getting any significant playing time, even though I think he has the potential to be a better balanced, and just simply better full back then Jordi. That's where the problem lies for me."
Barca,3b4k5n,broad_h2o,9,Fri Jun 26 01:36:41 2015 UTC,"Effective rotation could easily help us in that situation. After all there are so many matches in the season, a good rotation policy would make sure that both the players get enough play time"
Barca,3b4k5n,invice,6,Fri Jun 26 02:59:51 2015 UTC,Imagine how much and fast would Jordi run if he'd only play one half per game.
Barca,3b4k5n,vanNostrandby,7,Fri Jun 26 07:13:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I think. The man already appears to have an extra pair of lungs kept at half time so that he can change and keep his stamina, then how ridiculously strong he would be when he could get nicely rotated, and that would be good for Grimaldo too, as Grimaldo will have someone to look up to, someone to mentor him, all the while helping Alba to get optimum rest.  I think that Grimaldo can easily fit into this team now, as Adriano is most likely out this summer."

Barca,3b4k5n,tiagom0702,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:50:47 2015 UTC,Maybe he should follow in Alba's footsteps? Leave for a few years and come back when he is ready to be a starter.

Seeing as this is Barça and we like to experiment positionally with our defenders and midfielders.  Though I mean, I'd be perfectly content with an all-Catalan back four of Alba-Bartra-Pique-Vidal for the next 5 or 6 seasons. That has the potential to be the greatest defensive quartet we've ever produced."

Barca,3b4k5n,Lopezj5646,2,Fri Jun 26 15:30:57 2015 UTC,"Not to mention our RB has to be amazing with the ball at his feet, because linking up w/ Messi on the little 1/2 give and go's passes are pivotal."

Maybe he hasn't necessarily been the same Iniesta we've been watching for years game in and game out but he SHINES when he needs to in important matches, matches that Pogba and his piece of shit agent are going to complain about and start drama over if he doesn't start.  Iniesta still has 2 great seasons ahead of him, it's crazy to me how quickly people lose sight of his brilliance when a new shiny bulldozer of a midfielder may join our team."
Barca,3b3krz,Marchisio,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:33:59 2015 UTC,I don't disagree that he'll play a key role in the squad. As he has for years. What I'm saying is to get the best out of him we may see him subbed off at 60 mins or rotated a bit more now seeing as he's what? 31 32?
Barca,3b3krz,youvebeenjammed,3,Fri Jun 26 17:34:54 2015 UTC,"Any team is in trouble if their two starting midfielders get injured.  If one of them gets injured (say, Iniesta), I'd argue we'd be fine. In medium games, a Rafinha-Busquets-Rakitić midfield will suffice. In big games, where you need experience, you'd go more conservative, Masch-Busquets-Rakitić - it might not be pretty but it'd work."
Barca,3b3krz,wavechappelle,7,Fri Jun 26 00:44:47 2015 UTC,"Masch-Busquets-Rakitić - it might not be pretty but it'd work.    That midfield would not work against top quality opposition, and really, any combination that has Masch-Busquets in it won't perform because they play on the same line. See the second half of Barca-Bayern for evidence."
Barca,3b3krz,wavechappelle,-1,Fri Jun 26 04:49:10 2015 UTC,"The second half of Barça-Bayern is a horrible example, cause Suarez came off and the team had little to play for.  Try the win at Mestalla, the last 15 mins of the Clasico, or the 3-4-3 against PSG for other examples of it working against top quality opposition."
Barca,3b3krz,wavechappelle,2,Fri Jun 26 05:39:11 2015 UTC,"You've just named a bunch of examples that prove my point. At the Mestalla, Valencia had far more chances. Busquets snatched a late winner.  Barca did manage to kill the game against Madrid w Busi and Mache on the pitch together, but that was only after losing the midfield battle to them (again), after they tired, and after they went 442 with Jese coming on for Isco. The match against PSG was no great success either despite the scoreline. We did not have nearly as much possession as Barca with four in midfield should have, and the number of good chances was equal between the two sides."
Barca,3b3krz,wavechappelle,4,Fri Jun 26 06:19:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying those games were pretty, but they got the job done.  We are literally the only team that won at Mestalla this season. The only one. And very few teams are able to stop Valencia from scoring - double pivot helped with that.  Also, the number of chances was not equal in the PSG game - they had like two good chances. I agree it wasn't a great success, but to say it was equal is ridiculous - they never really threatened."
Barca,3b3krz,corn_diggity,2,Fri Jun 26 14:12:53 2015 UTC,"Getting the job done this time doesn't mean it'll get done this time. Performance tells the story more than results do. Poor finishing had more to do with valencia failing to score in that match than anything barca did.  PSG did threaten, and barca may have won and just managed to outplay them, but like I said the four in midfield didn't work as it should have. It's simply not an optimal combination. Masch and busquets are too similar functionally.   Regardless of how you saw it, the fact remains that Pogba would be a huge benefit in any of these games. The value his versatility, physicality, and ability would provide cannot be ignored imo."
Barca,3b3krz,kirkrikster,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:03:54 2015 UTC,"Of course it's not optimal, optimal is our two starting midfielders. And of course Pogba would help. Is that worth 80m? That's the real question."

His work rate is impeccable as is his technical ability. He is 22 years old.   We may not need him urgently, and we may feel comfortable after winning the treble but make no mistake this signing would be amazing for barca.  We would have the best most potent midfield in the world as well as the best strike force. We would have depth at every position and Pogba adds a physical aspect that we could really use in an 65 game season.   Calling this signing unnecessary is like saying we shouldn't have signed Suarez because we were all set with Messi Neymar and Pedro. Sure we didn't have to have Suarez... But if you can have the best in the world..."
Barca,3b3krz,Count_Critic,20,Thu Jun 25 21:33:35 2015 UTC,"This, coming from last season where barca fans wanted a new defense and cringed at the idea of instead building our attack even stronger, need to take Pogba as a Suarez.

Barca,3b3krz,tiagom0702,9,Fri Jun 26 01:20:43 2015 UTC,"Suarez was absolutely needed. Anyone who knew their stuff about tactics or how a team works could tell that Barça were desperately missing a real 9, and Suarez fit the mold of a Barça striker to perfection.  Also, La Masia doesn't really produce pure strikers like Suarez, or at least it hadn't. Midfielders? That's a different story."

But if for some reason you prefer to sign someone right now there's another options in the market that are way cheaper like İlkay Gündoğan, William Carvalho or Verratti.

Barca,3b3krz,YoSoyMilkChocolate,6,Fri Jun 26 13:06:01 2015 UTC,If your only issue is his price fair enough but the only player you mentioned who comes close to the same value that Pogba provides is Verratti.

Barca,3b3krz,YoSoyMilkChocolate,11,Fri Jun 26 04:20:48 2015 UTC,"This is why we lost talents like Hector Bellerin and Thiago.   This has absolutely nothing to do with Hector Bellerin, that just sounds silly. Bellerin left in 2011 when he was 16, which several Masia players do each year because English teams can offer more money than Barcelona can, legally. It has little to do with who's in the first team, and a lot to do with money and opportunity."

Barca,3b3krz,XsTream23,6,Fri Jun 26 05:35:38 2015 UTC,Not to mention all the top teams want him. Having him instead of facing him is a huge advantage in the midfield battle.
Barca,3b3krz,flackohowyoubeen,5,Fri Jun 26 04:06:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think that Pogba is similar to Fabregas. The thing with Cesc was that he included all sorts of baggage that came with his past both at Camp Nou and in the PL. In a lot of ways he was a  a symbolic signing, a political statement by first Laporta then Rosell, rather than a football investment. I was convinced at the time because Guardiola was convinced and to that point Pep could do no wrong. However, over time it became clear that Cesc was a negative signing. There have always been strong rumors that, although he knows how to smile for the cameras and say the right thing, his real personality is somewhat selfish and destructive. For instance, many believe that it was he who leaked Pep's lineup in his last clásico to the press (Cesc had been dropped) and Pep asked for Cesc to be sold as a condition for continuing (Rosell refused, because political signing). If those things are true, and there is enough circumstantial evidence to make me believe it's true, like the way he jumped ship to Chelsea last season, then bad signing.   From a purely footballing perspective, I think that Pogba would improve the team over the next few seasons. He certainly is the type of physical/technical midfielder who should excel in this version of Barça, which requires midfielders who can run all day. Over the next two seasons Iniesta's minutes are going to decrease, perhaps drastically, and with Xavi gone I don't think that sharing minutes among the ""starters"" (Iniesta, Rakitic, Pogba) will be a huge issue.  The only Masía players I am concerned about developing are Samper and Rafinha. But Samper is a pivot, he won't be affected by Pogba. People seem to think that he can play further forward like Xavi, but I think he's more like Busquets, a player who needs to play deeper. So there's no conflict there. Samper's competition will be Mascherano and Roberto. Maybe Rafinha will lose minutes to Pogba, but Pogba's upside is larger than Rafinha's, so that's a risk worth taking. As far as Denis Suarez and Roberto, I don't think either is a good enough to justify not buying a potentially great player.  From a personality perspective I'm not sure if he would be humble coming in, like Neymar and Suarez, or feel entitled, like Cesc. If it's the latter, then yeah, that would be a problem, but I've never heard of him having a difficult personality. Does he?   I'm more concerned with the money involved, not so much the transfer fee, but the salary that his agent is asking for is too much. Which leads us to the most unattractive thing about Pogba: Mino Raiola. I haven't forgotten his attitude during the whole Ibra disaster and the way he went to the press to attack Guardiola. He's a bit like Toure's agent, a guy who will stir up shit that can hurt the team to get more money for his player (and himself, naturally). Apparently Laporta has a good relationship with him, as well as with Toure's sleazy agent and Jorge Mendes, the sleaziest of them all. So if Joan comes back, maybe that won't be a problem."
Barca,3b3krz,YoSoyMilkChocolate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:30:48 2015 UTC,"Good points. But Pogba is being touted in presidential elections by all sides - doesn't that make him a political signing, too? And if after a year he's getting dropped in big games or has a bad attitude, that could get ugly.   You have giant transfer fee + awful agent + the fact that he was a campaign promise, no president is going to sell him even if that's necessary. That's what I don't like, the idea of being hamstrung if things go poorly. Hence why I talk about Bale at Madrid, etc."
Barca,3b3krz,dk1244973,3,Fri Jun 26 14:16:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, I suppose you're right, he is a political signing in that sense, but there is far less convoluted history between the club and the player. Fabregas was the prodigal son, the one that should ""never have been allowed to leave"" and bringing him back was symbolic on many levels -by Laporta it was a slap at the Nuñistas who let him go in the first place and he could prop up his La Masía platform and flex the club's financial power, for Rosell it was to achieve what Laporta could not and to flex the club's financial power, etc. Even Guardiola was caught up in the symbolic aspect of it, I suspect. So the stakes were higher because they were purely symbolic, not really football related.  None of that happens with Pogba. For me signing Pogba is like signing Neymar or Ronaldinho. A lot of money for a young player who may be one of the greatest, which is always a risk. However, it's a better time to bring a new elite player into the midfield than when Fabregas was signed, because Xavi is gone and Iniesta is winding his career down and Rakitic and Rafinha only had one season to have staked their claims to the team.  I'm not really for or against this signing. Or to be more accurate, if they sign him and he does well, I'm for it, if he does poorly than I'm against it 100%. ;)"
Barca,3b3krz,Marchisio,15,Fri Jun 26 15:24:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with this article entirely. I have been saying the same thing ever since the rumors surfaced. Our midfield is okay for now, and Samper needs play time."
Barca,3b3krz,urbeer,6,Thu Jun 25 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"Now that Denis isn't going to join the team this summer, he probably will get some play time."
Barca,3b3krz,Masterofknees,3,Thu Jun 25 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"I think we need a solid sub at striker. Pedro is a great ambidextrous winger, but he didn't really adapt to the CF position the couple of times he started. We don't really seem to have great attack once Suarez is subbed off. Sure, Messi can play CF, but I really like him in the wide roaming position alongside a CF who creates space for him on runs and provides dangerous pass options. I'm thinking of the role Chicharito fulfilled this past year at Real."
Barca,3b3krz,urbeer,9,Thu Jun 25 19:03:57 2015 UTC,against atletico he did good (and its not like he got that many minutes or chances as a # 9 but rather as a winger ) but i get your point.  i think sandro could do well in that #9 role that you re talking about
Barca,3b3krz,NotSoFastMister,6,Thu Jun 25 19:18:46 2015 UTC,"Neymar can play CF and Messi can play CF. If you like him there or not, Pedro can put in alright work at RW with Messi moving into the middle.   No need to spend more money when we have Munir. Play him in the middle, and not(!!!) RW, and he can be great. He played when the team was at a low point in terms of plan and system, and if he plays now, he'll be much much better. No doubt."
Barca,3b3krz,NotSoFastMister,3,Thu Jun 25 23:28:20 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the thing I made a text post on and I got downvoted to oblivion. We don't have a central forward that's quite ready. Sandro could be that guy in a couple years, but not yet."
Barca,3b3krz,nannulators,3,Fri Jun 26 04:18:18 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel.  Iniesta still has at least one year at the top left, and Rakitic plays a very important role in this system, so you can't bench one of them.  But if you play 80 million for someone, you're almost obligated to start them, and like OP said, then you have some weird situation like with Cesc where you try to force all of them onto the field, rotate, and give fewer chances to rising stars"
Barca,3b3krz,NotSoFastMister,14,Thu Jun 25 20:36:55 2015 UTC,THANK YOU!!! I've been saying this and I just get downvoted like crazy.
Barca,3b3krz,wavechappelle,17,Thu Jun 25 18:26:04 2015 UTC,Pogba's signing is not unnecessary at all... By the time he joins Iniesta will be an old man
Barca,3b3krz,-Ozkr,6,Thu Jun 25 19:22:34 2015 UTC,"Pogba won't really fill the gap that Iniesta will leave though, he doesn't have the same kind of vision, agility and linkup play, to me he just seems too similar to Rakitic in his qualities, just with more power and less elegance.   With that said I'm not sure who would be a better replacement, Isco would be fantastic imo but obviously he's at Real so a deal would be nigh impossible to pull off unless he really pushed it himself or simply had a falling out with the club. Gundogan is another option but it remains to be seen if he can reach his previous highs after his injury, will probably become clearer when watching him with the renewed Dortmund. Rafinha has the right playstyle but I'm not sure he's ever going to be good enough to be a first-team player."
Barca,3b3krz,strayluck,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:46:16 2015 UTC,Of course we won't get anyone near the level of Iniesta... but Pogba is still probably the best we can get
Barca,3b3krz,wavechappelle,4,Fri Jun 26 16:55:38 2015 UTC,"It didn't work with Cesc and Xavi, did it?"
Barca,3b3krz,wavechappelle,21,Thu Jun 25 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"Pogba is no Cesc, Iniesta is no Xavi & Lucho is no Pep, Tito or Tata.  As you said in the article, the team now needs evolving. Pogba's one of the very few players out there that has the potential to improve this team. Is paying 80m for that really unnecessary?"
Barca,3b3krz,jklz,5,Thu Jun 25 19:59:18 2015 UTC,"I don't say that the team needs evolving, others say that. I want the team to be versatile, and that means having at least one player capable of orchestrating the ball. Currently that's Iniesta. In the future that's Samper. Signing Pogba jeopardizes both, forcing Iniesta out of the starting lineup and dampening Samper's hopes of ever breaking into the first team.   Pogba is no Cesc, Iniesta is no Xavi & Lucho is no Pep, Tito or Tata.   This is a meaningless sentence unless you explain what the differences are and why they matter."
Barca,3b3krz,wavechappelle,10,Thu Jun 25 20:03:28 2015 UTC,"With our current frontline, I don’t think Barca needs an orchestrator against every team. Pogba - Busi - Rakitic midfield would work against 70-80% of teams, in the rest we can play Iniesta (and in the future, Samper). And I don’t see how bringing Pogba would jeopardize either Samper’s or Iniesta’s chances in the starting lineup. Xavi’s gone, SR will probably leave after this season, Rafinha can play out wide. Lucho also knows how to rotate his team.   This is a meaningless sentence unless you explain what the differences are and why they matter.   Pogba is younger, with a different skillset & mentality than Cesc. Iniesta is not as important to Lucho’s system as Xavi was to Pep’s, Tito’s & Tata’s. And I doubt Enrique will move Pogba around the field the same way his predecessors did with Cesc."
Barca,3b3krz,mrnoor,15,Thu Jun 25 20:27:32 2015 UTC,"I think you make a lot of good points.  Another couple things to note:  While Cesc got moved around a lot and was inconsistent, he was still involved in more goals than anyone else on the team except for Messi when he was here. He worked well with Neymar and Alexis and they both were arguably more efficient next to Cesc than they were Messi last season.   One of the issues with Cesc is that he is not disciplined defensively. If he defends, he chases. He can't hang out in a zone and defend that area. Pogba will be coming from a very disciplined Italian team that has an emphasis on defend and counter and he'll be able to apply that into Barca's current system. He also provides another long range shooting option--something that has been great to have with Rakitic and something that we need to continue to build on.  I am completely neutral right now when it comes to the signing. If it happens, it will be great. He's a great player and could do very well and he and Neymar could be the pillars the next generation of the team are built around. If he doesn't come it gives us the chance to develop more youth. Samper will be a good backup for Busi, Rafinha can fill an Iniesta-type more attacking role, and SR can fill the Rakitic work-til-you-drop archetype."
Barca,3b3krz,efarfan,7,Thu Jun 25 20:36:42 2015 UTC,"People like to bash Fabregas around here but most forget that in the majority of games he played for us, Cesc was rather good.  And while I'm not too sure about Pogba's discipline in defence, his physicality alone makes him a better defensive prospect in our midfield than Fabregas. Like Adin Osmanbasic said, he can cover more distance, be more useful in set-pieces & harass opponents/intercept passes/moves better than most simply because he has an incredibly athletic body. And like you said, it's not a bad place to get defensive lessons (especially the core knowledge & habits) than the best team in Italy."
Barca,3b3krz,IhateAngryBirds,5,Thu Jun 25 20:58:34 2015 UTC,"Cesc was involved in a lot of games against small teams. His record in high-profile matches was pretty poor. Article on the subject  Also, the impression I get from Pogba is that he's not very disciplined defensively. He's big and can tackle, but he's also young and a bit immature. Maybe that's not accurate, but that's the impression I've gotten."
Barca,3b3krz,invice,5,Fri Jun 26 00:51:57 2015 UTC,"It's not accurate. He is very diligent in his defensive work, and covers a lot of ground. He has played with Pirlo for years now, so he is no stranger to covering for other players. For a young, supposedly immature player capable of incredible things in the attacking phase, one would even say his defensive game is surprisingly good."

Barca,3b3krz,invice,2,Fri Jun 26 00:45:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure if cruyff said this. that barcelona has move on from a midfield run team to a forward run team. Not sure if those were his exact words. But I do see pogba as a big gamble. But on the other hand  he can add variety to team he has strength, composure on the ball, good ball control, aerially he can be good and hes only 22. I feel like barcelona can maximize his potential in every area IF he has the right mindset. Now i love iniesta but it best to reduce his playing time somewhat to strech his career longer with barca like we did with xavi this season.  But with more minutes though. Again this is my opinion on the matter i do like gundogan as well but iffy about his back injury. And la masia players i also want minutes for them too. Because its a very long season an we have make sure that we are still fresh on the second half of the season. I feel like i left something out lol"
Barca,3b3krz,camp_nous,-1,Thu Jun 25 22:28:33 2015 UTC,"You do realize Samper and Pogba play different positions, right? Samper has shown zero evidence of being able to orchestrate in an advanced role between the lines and with his back to goal.   Barca do not need to speculate. Messi is in his prime right now, as is Suarez and Pique. If a deal is doable financially, there is zero reason not to take advantage and sign a player who can be the midfield kingpin for a decade. And if Samper is good enough, a competent manager will see that and will give him the opportunities to oust whoever is in front of him."
Barca,3b3krz,efarfan,0,Fri Jun 26 04:56:51 2015 UTC,"Samper has shown zero evidence of being able to orchestrate in an advanced role between the lines and with his back to goal.   Barça midfielders rarely play with their back to goal, how is that the marker of an interior's ability? And that's not true - he has the qualities of a good orchestrating midfielder, and he played that position in the levels before Juvenil A, according to /u/jklz."
Barca,3b3krz,ir7425,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:36:53 2015 UTC,"You need to be able to play with your back to goal - as in passing out of the half turn and being aware of opposition not in your line of sight - when you play in CM. Samper has all the play in front of him from his deep lying position which is a completely different proposition.   Of course he has many qualities, but that doesn't mean much in real terms on a football pitch. His body of work is the best indicator of his true ability. Where he played and what he did in the youth levels is irrelevant. Among many examples, Puyol was playing as a midfielder just a year or two before he made his first team debut."
Barca,3b3krz,zazzlekdazzle,2,Fri Jun 26 06:00:52 2015 UTC,"There's been a lot of times this season where Samper has been in advanced positions, despite being fielded as a DM and he has absolutely no trouble plaing ""with his back to goal"". I've seen him dribble past 2-3 players like Iniesta would.   The only real doubt I personally have about Samper being able to make it as an interior, is if he can be mobile enough. He isn't the fastest player (neither was Xavi, so that should be okay), but he's also not a player yet who runs 12 km every match."
Barca,3b3krz,invice,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:35:24 2015 UTC,"Huge difference between finding yourself in advanced positions during the course of a game, and actually playing in an advanced position. I've seen Mascherano dribble past players too, but that means nothing.   Despite what I've posted thus far, I'm not trying to criticize Samper. I simply recognize what he is and what he isn't as of right now. What he is right now is a fantastic prospect. What he isn't is a player who would be fielded in Pogba's position by any manager. Also what he isn't is a player so exceptional that we should consider passing on signing potentially the best mid in the world."
Barca,3b3krz,cea2015,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:50:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the team needs anything right now but in a year (probably even now) Iniesta will need a lot more rotation.  My top picks would be Verratti, Kovacic, Reus, Pogba. I think Reus is capable of playing behind the strikers instead of on the wing. My favorite youngin has been Verratti right after Griezmann and this is talking about 3-4 years ago."

Barca,3b3krz,efarfan,3,Thu Jun 25 21:23:08 2015 UTC,"The Cesc-didn't-fit narrative is sort of revisionist. He was an excellent attacking mid when paired with Xavi, better in the final third even than Iniesta, but superfluous because other facets of his game (and his consistency, due to poor fitness) weren't good enough for him to beat out either starting CM.   An incoming midfielder in 2015-16 wouldn't have as much trouble earning playing time. Iniesta needs to be rotated more often these days, and while Rakitić has been great, there's little reason to think Pogba couldn't be even better in a similar role. Samper could serve as an understudy, displacing Rafinha. (He's given no sign he'd be as impatient as Thiago, and he'd be learning a new position.) That leaves plenty of minutes to spread around.  Look, I agree signing Pogba would be expensive and not strictly necessary. Either Samper or Denis Suárez would get squeezed out, and I'd love to see how those two might fit with the first team. But the team's present system doesn't require those guys' or even Iniesta's skillset as much as it needs big, athletic mids like Rakitić and Pogba. Assuming Lucho doesn't change much from what won him the treble, Pogba could fit in nicely."
Barca,3b3krz,Football_Enthusiast,2,Fri Jun 26 03:49:02 2015 UTC,"but superfluous because other facets of his game (and his consistency, due to poor fitness) weren't good enough for him to beat out either starting CM.   How is that revisionist? He was never good enough to outright bench either Xavi or Iniesta. That's the definition of not fitting.   But the team's present system doesn't require those guys' or even Iniesta's skillset as much as it needs big, athletic mids like Rakitić and Pogba.    Not sure I agree about that - I think that's relying on stereotypes more than reality. Iniesta was absolutely vital this season in a defensive role, always playing the safe outlet pass. It wasn't pretty, but his conservative nature allowed everything else to happen. And while Rakitić's physicality was great, his tactical sense was the biggest boon, which I don't really see as much in Pogba.  Rafinha is much more physical than Iniesta or Xavi, and yet he didn't shine exceptionally this season. With the forwards taking so many risks, the midfield needs to be disciplined, that's why you don't see Iniesta dribbling anymore."
Barca,3b3krz,ir7425,2,Fri Jun 26 00:36:21 2015 UTC,"Cesc's superfluity was actually a sign that he did fit—if he hadn't, he would have been more useful as a situational start but less useful overall. This is where revisionism creeps in: Nobody really expected him to outcompete Xavi or Iniesta, except maybe Cesc himself, which I imagine is why he left. But he was a very strong third option at a time when Barça required a profile that few midfielders fit.  Agree with what you said about Iniesta and Rafinha, but I don't think either point is an argument against Pogba, who's better than Iniesta defensively (though not as a possession specialist, of course) and better than Rafinha across the board. I'm a little nervous about a Pogba-Rakitić pairing but would certainly be interested to see it tried. Pogba-Iniesta seems natural to me, and Pogba-Samper could be a great long term look.  Edit: Forgot to address your point about Rakitić's tactical sense. You're right, but it took two thirds of a season under Lucho before he really nailed it down. Why don't you think Pogba could learn the system, too?"
Barca,3b3krz,Football_Enthusiast,4,Fri Jun 26 00:42:59 2015 UTC,"Tbf Rakitic was really good at the start of the season but due to Lucho's rotations, and him being benched in quite a few matches led to him losing that form. Once Lucho figured out his starting eleven, Rakitic again gained his exemplary form.   So for me it was not due to Rakitic not adjusting in the beginning but due to erratic play time"
Barca,3b3krz,ir7425,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:59:11 2015 UTC,"Rakitić was great early on, yeah, but in a totally different system where the midfielders' job was strictly to pass the ball between the back line and the wing and to give the fullbacks defensive cover. Simple stuff.   Once Suárez came on and Messi moved to the wing the team went through a couple months of growing pains before they figured out how to make things run smoothly. Rakitić had it the worst since his job involved accounting for Alves and Messi, the two most dynamic players in terms of positioning. In the end he aced it. All I'm saying is I see no reason to think Pogba couldn't be coached to understand his position in the same way."
Barca,3b3krz,Football_Enthusiast,4,Fri Jun 26 03:37:42 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but have to politely disagree 100%. Iniesta is declining fast and Xavi has left. I just don't see Rafinha and Samper being able to replace them. I think Pogba has let it be known that he loves the Barcelona system of play and it would be arrogant to say he would be excess. Agian just difference of opinions, but I highly hope we sign him bc he WILL be a world's top midfielder sooner rather than later."
Barca,3b3krz,jklz,10,Fri Jun 26 03:50:57 2015 UTC,"Iniesta is declining fast   It's arguable. We can say, he took a while in his new role. Once he adapted the role, he became in his brilliant best form as we have seen in last two-three months of the season."
Barca,3b3krz,lonestar_10,11,Thu Jun 25 19:32:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people seem to forget that he was MOTM in the CL final. Iniesta hit his stride towards the end."
Barca,3b3krz,NoFapMonster,3,Thu Jun 25 19:49:12 2015 UTC,"He had a few stellar performances towards the end of the season, and one them happened to be in the CL final.  But, and this is an honest question not a rhetorical one, did he show enough steady and increased progress for it be a reliable sign that he's back to his best?  He wasn't the only person who had to make a lot of adjustments this season."
Barca,3b3krz,NoFapMonster,2,Thu Jun 25 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"Well he hasn't had a summer holiday since I don't know when, with the euros and then the world cup(pretty sure I am forgetting one more competition) . He needs the rest and this summer he will get the complete two months off. I think that it would help a lot. Burnout could be the case for Iniesta, to play for more than three years without breaks is a bit tough, and Iniesta is not that young that he has infinite stamina.  I think this season iniesta will be back to the nice form he showed batting the end of the last season.  Adjustments are not the main problem according to me. Because he is a brilliant player, and brilliant players can adjust easily. Barça makes them that way, and iniesta is the product of this system"

As a Barca fan with an opinion, I do not expect my opinions, positive or negative to be delivered to the team or coach to be acted upon. Healthy discussion nourishes both sides of the argument.

As you say, we learn from each other."
Barca,3b3krz,Tyrionsnow,2,Fri Jun 26 16:23:34 2015 UTC,This is silly. Rakitic is a good player but he's not one that cant be dropped/rotated or even close to the level Iniesta was at when Cesc arrived. Samper is not close to the level Thiago was at and doesnt even play the same position at the moment.   The fact is that there are currently too few players for the two positions with only Rakitic and Iniesta good enough to be starters. And Iniesta will be 32 by the time Pogba can arrive.
Barca,3b3krz,YoSoyMilkChocolate,2,Fri Jun 26 16:41:22 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ: Pogba is proven on the highest level (Serie A, CL and with France) while the biggest game Samper has played is against the likes of Sporting Gijon and APOEL, playing in a team which finished dead last in the Segunda division and the occasional easy game for the first team.  Samper's 19 and ideal in the Busquets role. You want him to change his role to a no.6 (which may or may not pay off) and force him into the starting lineup? Or would you rather have a world-class midfielder slot in his place?  The likes of Pedro and Busquets got into the first team by displacing Henry/Ibra and Yaya Toure, two world class players. Samper should be given a fair shot next season and be expected to do the same.  Secondly, we are an entire season away from this transfer. Pogba doesn't come until 2016 summer, so I think we might have to replace a 32 year old Iniesta by then. Iniesta already looks like he is on the wane (despite his strong end to the season). Contrast this to Xavi, who had one of his strongest seasons in 2010-11 just before Fabregas was bought. Xavi was 31 and his game relied less on his physical condition than Iniesta's game currently does. Even Mascherano is 31; he will also soon need replacing.  This isn't like the Madrid policy of bringing in an attacking mid while selling a defensive player. This isn't a ' buy Beckham - sell Makelele'. Or a 'buy James/Kroos - sell di Maria/Alonso' for that matter.  We have three forwards so one of Iniesta/ Rakitic will be dropped. I doubt we'll put 4 mids on the pitch at the same time, with MSN pretty set as our forwards. While I'd like to see Samper progress, this transfer isn't too bad. They all get the next season to prove themselves. Is Samper that good? Well prove it over the course of next season."
Barca,3b3krz,YoSoyMilkChocolate,2,Fri Jun 26 10:08:13 2015 UTC,"Gentlemen, I just want to say that what a great discussion we're having here. Obviously it is a controversial topic, and there are very good points both in favor and against it. I just hope that, whoever wins the presidential elections, makes a very informed decision along with the technical staff (Luis Enrique, the sporting director, and people from the youth teams that actually know about Masía players and their potential).  As long as it is a rational and well-thought decision, I'm OK with it and will support it.  edit: and gentlewomen"
Barca,3b3krz,Turn_off_the_Volcano,4,Fri Jun 26 12:14:21 2015 UTC,We celebrated our last two CL by buying unnecessary players.  Will we learn?
Barca,3b3krz,iVarun,5,Fri Jun 26 17:27:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of people said the same about Saurez last summer.  Quality is quality and there might not be another Pogba on the market for quite some time.  It's a risk -- as was Suarez last year -- but risks like these are necessary.  Also, you mentioned how Suarez fit perfectly into a hole Barca had at the time?  I disagree.  At the time, Messi was the CF/False 9.  The system changed to accomodate Suarez...Cesc literally didn't fit any position for us, regardless of the system"
Barca,3b3krz,i3k,10,Thu Jun 25 20:32:28 2015 UTC,"Everybody knew where Suarez would play and what role he would fulfill, in the front three alternating with Messi. The only question was who would spend more time in the middle. But people had identified for years that Barça were missing a true striker for pressing, hold-up play, and a physical presence, things Alexis couldn't provide. And Suarez literally ticked every single box of an ideal Barça forward.  Pogba doesn't fill a need in the same way. He's a luxury."
Barca,3b3krz,iagolima,5,Thu Jun 25 18:59:56 2015 UTC,"I would argue that Barca also are starting to have a bit of a hole at Iniesta's position that will only get worse as he ages. He still shows flashes of the Iniesta of old but you can also see that he is on the downhill part of his career. Pogba would be able to ease into that position as the Mid that can slice into the box like Iniesta did/still does sometimes.  It will also allow him to mesh with Busquets, Alba, Ney and Rakitic all while allowing Lucho to play around with schemes that maximizes each of those players' abilities. Its more of a plan for the future instead of plugging a current need. I'd rather plan than react, especially when a player of Pogba's capabilities is available.   I'm also not ENTIRELY sure that Suarez fit our scheme and needs as seamlessly as your putting it. Hindsight is 20/20 now but at the time there were a lot of questions about fit that are similar to the ones that are being asked regarding Pogba."
Barca,3b3krz,mullsork,4,Thu Jun 25 19:05:18 2015 UTC,"You can't plan for the future with an 80m player though. As soon as you sign him he becomes a starter, that's just the way it is.  Moreover, if you sign Pogba, it's pretty much a certainty that Samper will never make it in the first team. Thiago couldn't break past Xavi, Iniesta, and Cesc. Samper won't be able to break past Iniesta, Rakitic, and Pogba. He won't be content with 4th-choice CM or second-choice DM behind Busi."
Barca,3b3krz,jimbo_sly,5,Thu Jun 25 19:31:14 2015 UTC,"You can't plan for the future with an 80m player though. As soon as you sign him he becomes a starter, that's just the way it is.   Exactly. It's a point is getting always overlooked. Either Iniesta or Rakitic going to be benched for a 80M sign. You can't sign a player with 80M to bench him."
Barca,3b3krz,Flam1,2,Thu Jun 25 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"You can't plan for the future with an 80m player though. As soon as you sign him he becomes a starter, that's just the way it is.   IIRC Neymar was on the bench for several games before he started getting time over Pedro/Alexis.   edit: Also, he wouldn't play until 2016.. so there would be plenty of time for other players before he could set foot on the field."
Barca,3b3krz,IhateAngryBirds,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:51:48 2015 UTC,"At that time Neymar was still a 40mil player or so.  And in the beginning, he had Amenia or something and couldn't play"
Barca,3b3krz,Flam1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:47:03 2015 UTC,Neymar was never a 40m player even if that's the picture they tried to paint. The board would have still put pressure on the staff to start him even if they were lying about the price
Barca,3b3krz,YoSoyMilkChocolate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:01:12 2015 UTC,"I don't put much weight into the ""then ________ will never get to play"" argument. What you are essentially arguing is that the team should be worse so that a Masia product can play/develop.   I do agree that an 80m player should start but that's really the whole crux of the disagreement here. I think we have to plan for the future and its better to spend now so that we don't have a hole rather than miss out on the piece we would want at that time and have to instead plug that hole with whoever is available at the time, which could be nobody and we end up with a Douglas-esque midfielder. (Sorry for that run on sentence)"
Barca,3b3krz,elanciano31,2,Fri Jun 26 14:02:08 2015 UTC,"I think the team should spend in moderation to make use of its talents. It doesn't make sense to spend obscene amounts of money for a position that may or may not be covered. Spend moderate amounts, sure. If Pogba cost 30m I'd have no problem signing him. If we could get Verratti I'd have no problem.  But an 80m player cannot be third choice, cannot be benched in a big game, and that complicates everything."
Barca,3b3krz,flackohowyoubeen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:16:47 2015 UTC,"But not having Pogba will not make the team worse. If anything, having him will make it worse because he might be forced to start over Iniesta or Rakitic due to his price tag."
Barca,3b3krz,TimeFingers,2,Thu Jun 25 21:07:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree that everyone knew where Suarez would play.  I specifically remember everyone being concerned about how he'd do on the wing -- Messi literally pushed three world class CF's out wide in Etoo, Ibra, and Villa in the years leading up to it.  Everyone certainly did not ""know what role he would fulfill"".  And imo, Pogba fills the need of replacing Iniesta long term and I wouldn't be surprised if he surpassed Rakitic in quality by next summer.  Pogba has all the attributes for an ideal CM replacement -- even if he alternates with Rakitic and Iniesta for a bit.  I also think he could play CDM when needed, providing an offensive spark that Masch doesn't when called upon."
Barca,3b3krz,rdesyo,5,Fri Jun 26 05:40:04 2015 UTC,"Additional thought:  I checked out Egcg's comment history, you certainly predicted what Suarez's role would be correctly but I think you were the exception.  And this time around, if we do get Pogba, you'll hopefully get credit for being the pessimistic/incorrect one about Pogba :)    As you said in an older post, ""there are smarter people working at Barca than you and I, and they see something in _____"" (Pogba)"

Barca,3b2l4a,HippoNigga,5,Thu Jun 25 13:42:30 2015 UTC,"Yep. As much as I wanted him to become a huge talent here, he has too many mental problems. I'm sure he'll be able to grow up and reach his full potential if he's properly dealt with."

Barca,3b2l4a,TwoTecs,4,Thu Jun 25 18:14:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think so. I guess he's arrogant and he's had issues with managers and coaches in the past. I'm not saying it's his fault - he's been hyped up since he was 12 as the next Messi. He was bound to have problems with his mentality."
Barca,3b2l4a,EDGY_USERNAME_I_USE,3,Thu Jun 25 18:16:09 2015 UTC,"What he meant was 'mentality'. There's a lot of talk over his decision making abilities, and his self-centeredness."
Barca,3b2l4a,maaaze,2,Thu Jun 25 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"He wasn't played much in the year he was there, but now that he might stay there a while longer hopefully Martinez will rotate him in more. If he gets disciplined and learns to play effectively as part of a team, he could be a massive talent."
Barca,3b2l4a,ElClandestino,19,Thu Jun 25 14:21:51 2015 UTC,"Fins aviat Deulo! Hopefully see you back at Barça in a season or two :)  Biggest La Masia talent together with Thiago since Leo. If he gets the help necessary, his potential is limitless."

Barca,3b2l4a,IhateAngryBirds,2,Thu Jun 25 14:42:00 2015 UTC,"In top level football, players doesn't care this type of issues of the past. If anyone does, he has (attitude) problem. Allegri didn't trust Pirlo in Milan, but Pirlo doesn't mind him as his Juve manager."
Barca,3b2l4a,ir7425,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:26:39 2015 UTC,"A lot can change in 1, 2, 3 or 4 years. If he gets help to fix his attitude, he might realize that he wasn't the best professional and that's why Luis Enrique didn't trust him. If that's the case, there shouldn't be a problem between the two.   Literally anything can happen."
Barca,3b2l4a,jklz,10,Thu Jun 25 23:38:22 2015 UTC,"I think this is good for Deulo.  Now that he made a SWITCH and not a loan, he's on his own.  Everton got him for cheap and they are taking almost no risks. He either will focus and progress to become that player we all think he'll become or keep that shitty attitude and prove all the doubters right.  You gotta work hard Gerard."
Barca,3b2l4a,Duke--Nukem,3,Thu Jun 25 14:05:39 2015 UTC,"Well good luck for him, definitely the best move for Deulofeu right now.  I'm very curious no how he'll develop there."
Barca,3b2l4a,latino666,3,Thu Jun 25 14:04:24 2015 UTC,Maybe he'll finally get proper playing time for once.
Barca,3b2l4a,IhateAngryBirds,5,Thu Jun 25 14:40:26 2015 UTC,"If that's the deal its great deal IMO. with the price being so low (therefore buy back is low as well) its a good sign that the club isn't exactly getting rid of him and they expect him back at the club. why this is better than yet another useless loan deal for me is because now Everton considers Deulo an asset and it would be in their interest to develop him and be patient with him instead of him being someone else's property that if he doesn't perform he is overlooked. 2 loans didn't really work so far, staying at the club wasn't an option (from last year's experience) so this is only logical."
Barca,3b2l4a,domi_28,4,Thu Jun 25 15:05:07 2015 UTC,Glad there's a buy back clause
Barca,3b2l4a,mattb10,2,Thu Jun 25 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"It's sad to see him leave Barca but he really doesn't have a choice. He said himself that he's not going to be loaned again, which is totally understandable after he's spent the last two years loaned to two different clubs, and looking at Barca's current attack there's not a single spot for him to get in. Wish the guy nothing but luck at Everton, hope he does well for himself."
Barca,3b2l4a,Robbzor11,2,Thu Jun 25 15:47:21 2015 UTC,"part of me is abit sad because i know the kid's got a lot of talent but his attitude is bringing him down, that's what a lot of coaches were complaining about him.  absolute beast on a individual level but when it came to teamplay.. different story ,  at least we have that buyback clause so it means Barca havent given up entirelly on him.   i d like to see him return one day."
Barca,3b2l4a,XsTream23,3,Thu Jun 25 19:22:19 2015 UTC,I have been really harsh on Deulo this season. But i feel this is for the best of all parties involved. And I believe he will come back. He is not like Bojan. He just needs a nice run of games with a level head and I think he will develop late in the temperament department.

Barca,3b2l4a,Hankey01,0,Thu Jun 25 17:26:54 2015 UTC,Fuck...
Barca,3b2l4a,trailerparkjesus87,3,Thu Jun 25 13:37:25 2015 UTC,"Why? Do you really think he's going to get any play time with our line up? Furthermore, wasn't Unai quoted to have said something along the lines that he has a lot of growing up to do as a person and player before starting for a bigger club? I'm fine with seeing him get experience abroad, off our wages, and if he turns out in a couple of years and we really need him, buy him back for relatively dirt cheap if he lives up to expectations. I like this move."
Barca,3b2l4a,MongooseTitties,2,Thu Jun 25 13:43:16 2015 UTC,"Think it's for the best, with so many winger options out on loan/playing for Barca B we had to get rid of some. A player who can't correct the problems he's had for the past 2/3 years would be my choice for first to go as well."

Barca,3b2m0u,EpicChiguire,4,Thu Jun 25 22:31:48 2015 UTC,So this is happening most likely because the club will sign a new midfielder before Denis returns. And when that happens Roberto will be loaned or sold.
Barca,3b2m0u,tonytetova,4,Thu Jun 25 16:16:01 2015 UTC,"In that event our midfielders until January would be Busi, Iniesta, Ivan, Rafinha... Maybe Samper.  That is not enough depth."
Barca,3b2m0u,Not_Tom_Brady,3,Thu Jun 25 16:33:52 2015 UTC,"And Sergi Roberto for rotation purposes, but yes I agree, a bit light. It should be enough to get through the first half of the season barring injuries."
Barca,3b2m0u,Marchisio,2,Thu Jun 25 17:06:12 2015 UTC,He was really good when he played DM. Not Busi or Masche good but more than capable of covering for a league or cup game.

Barca,3b3i28,ZidanesLeftBoot,3,Thu Jun 25 17:47:13 2015 UTC,"I'm torn. On one hand, Pogba is literally handing himself to us on a silver platter and will undoubtedly secure the future core of the club alongside Bartra, ter Stegen, Rafinha, and Neymar. On the other hand, we have some damn good talent in the youth academy like Halilovic, Samper, Denis Suárez and Grimaldo, and Pogba's arrival would hinder the development of these players significantly and would lead them to strengthen our rivals seeing as they would then possess the desire to leave (think Thiago to Bayern again). This could go either incredibly right or horribly wrong either way, but I'm in favor of passing on Pogba, especially because I believe he stays in Turin for one more season if he doesn't come now. That way we can still go for him later if the circumstances call for it then.  I will pray however that Pogba stay away from that club in the capital. I never want to see him wearing those hideous colors. The last thing I want is another headache for another 8 years like Ronaldo has provided for the last 6 or so."
Barca,3b3i28,YoSoyMilkChocolate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:59:37 2015 UTC,"Pogba showed he can certainly diminish Messi's role to only playing key passes which lead to goals. Well, seriously, Pogba seemed to contain Messi in the midfield with his physicality alone."
Barca,3b3i28,vanNostrandby,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:17:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think Pogba is eager to go to Real. Raiola thinks that Pogba moving there would hamper his progress. Furthermore, he has already come out and stated his desire for Barça.   I'm torn because I want the club to stick with its tradition of growing players but then again, whichever team gets Pogba will certainly become a force to be reckoned with for the next 10 years."
Barca,3b3i28,Rempelrez,0,Fri Jun 26 16:00:58 2015 UTC,Did Pogba himself state he wants Barça or did his agent say that?
Barca,3b3i28,YoSoyMilkChocolate,2,Fri Jun 26 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"Pogba said in an interview before the CL final that he likes the way how Barça play, he also said that he admires Messi and thinks he's the best in the world. (obviously)   As for Raiola, he hasn't said much about Pogba joining Barça, simply that he doesn't want him to go to Madrid."
Barca,3b3i28,Rempelrez,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:16:30 2015 UTC,"As for Raiola, he hasn't said much about Pogba joining Barça, simply that he doesn't want him to go to Madrid.   Mino has been clear about wage expectations though, which is perhaps his way of influencing the players movement in a subtler fashion than saying ""he will/won't go to barca"".  He can't take both spanish clubs with spending power off the table because it would ruin his leverage in negotiations with any other suitor.  Poison the well for bids from spain and bids from england or psg will shrink."
Barca,3b3i28,elanciano31,6,Fri Jun 26 18:48:28 2015 UTC,"Yes please, him and Neymar will be the face of Barcelona in the not too distant future when Messi begins to slow down. I strongly believe it's a bit arrogant and shortsighted to the present to think that he would be excess. Xavi is gone, Iniesta is almost done, and I just don't see Rafinha, Samper, or Suarez filling and performing at a word's best level. Barcelona's style of play is not one of maintaining high standards, but reaching further and developing new highs. I just don't think this can be done with the current crop, a super star in the middle, who is hungry for the Barcelona system is what is needed, and there is no better suit than Pogba."
Barca,3b3i28,efarfan,15,Thu Jun 25 19:37:01 2015 UTC,"I just don't see Rafinha, Samper, or Suarez filling and performing at a word's best level.   Saying this over Samper is absurd. You either never watch Samper or don't have high opinion with our own talents. At age 20, Samper is one of the few players who can orchestrate the midfield that many of the top named footballer would be happy if they can do like Samper."
Barca,3b3i28,ir7425,4,Thu Jun 25 20:28:50 2015 UTC,"Samper is the jewel of the three, though again, I don't see them holding up and constantly pushing the bar of creativity and finesse."
Barca,3b3i28,efarfan,2,Thu Jun 25 20:54:36 2015 UTC,"Samper and Pogba play different positions. All this worrying about hampering his opportunities is for nothing. Samper plays in front of the defense and is more of a deep lying playmaker. He has yet to show the ability to orchestrate in the manner of Xavi as in with his back to goal, with defenders pressing all around him, in CM or between the lines. Pogba is more of a traditional CM - he can play box to box, or as an AM. He has the ball winning ability to play more defensive too, but it'd be a massive waste to play him as a DM."
Barca,3b3i28,wavechappelle,-1,Fri Jun 26 05:11:23 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Busquets is still active, and he can play CM or DM for years to come. Samper's emergence could allow Busquets to move to CM permanently, making Pogba a big problem."
Barca,3b3i28,YoSoyMilkChocolate,3,Fri Jun 26 05:13:28 2015 UTC,"Busquets has played in CM on a few occasions, and his displays were not good. He is the best holding mid in the world, and we're going to move him to a suboptimal position to make room for a youngster? Absurd. Pogba is a talent you don't pass on. If he isn't signed, and ends up in Madrid, it would be a disaster. Think Madrid missing out on a 21 yr old Neymar, and having to deal with the prospect of facing him for the next decade - only it'll be us this time, and it'll be in midfield."
Barca,3b3i28,wavechappelle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:46:12 2015 UTC,"He hates Madrid and so does his agent. If we don't get him he's not going there, he'll either stay at Juve or go to City."
Barca,3b3i28,Marchisio,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:06:55 2015 UTC,"Who's to say that Busquets has been bad in CM? He's been fine, Xavi himself stated Busquets to be his successor in midfield. Additionally we can mold Samper into a DM/CM hybrid. And what if Pogba is a flop, Denis Suárez and Samper leave and succeed elsewhere? It'll look equally as bad, maybe worse because of the money wasted."
Barca,3b3i28,YoSoyMilkChocolate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:50:11 2015 UTC,"'Fine' isn't an acceptable Barca level, I'm afraid. Xavi never said anything about Busquets changing positions.   Pogba would not be a flop. He is a 'can't miss' player, which is why his market evaluation is as high as it is. He is not injury prone, and his abilities are not in question."
Barca,3b3i28,wavechappelle,0,Fri Jun 26 06:06:31 2015 UTC,"IIRC Pogba was nursing an injury before the UCL semis and final, so not injury pron isn't quite right.  Also, was Cavani worth it? Like you said, his market valuation means that he was as great as the price indicates, so he must have been an excellent signing?  Big money =\= guaranteed success. Look no further than Barça and Ibrahimovic or Fabregas."
Barca,3b3i28,YoSoyMilkChocolate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:25:35 2015 UTC,"I think you may need to look up the definition of ""prone.""  Cavani scored 30 goals last season playing out of his favored position, so it's quite possible he is worth it to PSG. Pogba's price isn't a guarantee of success, it's simply indicative of his talent level, age, and the market as a whole. Seeing as how it's 80m euros or more means his talent is extraordinary, his age is perfect with years of development left, and that the market is what it is. Like I said, his abilities are not in question.  Trying to compare Pogba with Ibra and Cesc is comparing apples and oranges. Different players, different team situation, different managers, etc. I could just as easily list the likes of Neymar, Suarez, CR, Zidane, etc. who were successful. All pointless comparisons."
Barca,3b3i28,wavechappelle,-1,Fri Jun 26 06:37:22 2015 UTC,This club's identity is based on La Masia though. Without that nothing matters. Pogba is good but not worth it. We've neglected the youth academy for too long. If anything go after Verratti in a few years.

Barca,3b2fw0,TimeFingers,32,Thu Jun 25 12:46:51 2015 UTC,Kovacic for Montoya+Song would be a great signing. But i don't think it will happen. It is too good to be true.

Barca,3b2fw0,invice,6,Fri Jun 26 03:55:12 2015 UTC,"Kovacic didn't really impress me in the few inter games I've watched, but I totally agree, he has potential and a swap deal sounds really good."
Barca,3b2fw0,domi_28,16,Thu Jun 25 15:07:33 2015 UTC,"I think (however unlikely) that Kovacic would be a more appropriate signing for us currently.  Pogba would come in requiring a MASSIVE salary and transfer fee, demand lots of playing time (would probably want to be a starter shortly too) and his agent is a piece of shit. We still have Iniesta for another 2 seasons hopefully and Rakitic has been a beast. Pogba isn't necessary and will hamper the potential of Rafinha and Denis Suarez and any other potential upcoming midfielder for the next 10 years..  Also, getting rid of Montoya and Song is a must and we never get good money for sales anyway, I think it's a good idea to put them towards another player who has loads of potential but won't require as much play time, money and drama."
Barca,3b2fw0,Marchisio,12,Thu Jun 25 13:50:09 2015 UTC,"Di Maria would be...interesting, and could potentially be a good iniesta replacement (for the future) since from what I've heard he shines most at LCM in a playmaker role. From what I've seen of him, he can be absolutely brilliant at times but is overall pretty inconsistent -- and maybe that could be because he has been forced to play out of his favored position at United and even Madrid at times.   Don't think he's ready to leave United though, as he has stated many times that he is determined to have success there and become a part of their history, and I find it hard to believe that United is willing to let him go/shopping him around already after just 1 season."
Barca,3b2fw0,04andrew22,2,Thu Jun 25 14:02:26 2015 UTC,"I think that LVG does not really count with him ... But Di Maria said that he does not want to leave but he wants to play, and if they tell him that he won't be a started I'm sure he would be ready to leave + Mundodeportivo says Madrid put a clause in Di Marias contract that if he goes to Barcelona that they will have to pay 10m to Madrid ... So Di Maria would cost almost the same as Pogba"
Barca,3b2fw0,iagolima,6,Thu Jun 25 14:30:48 2015 UTC,"Sport says (It's in portuguese, sorry) that there's a clause in his contract with MU from when he was bought that prevents him from being sold to us. I wouldn't be surprised if that were true"
Barca,3b2fw0,domi_28,5,Thu Jun 25 14:20:06 2015 UTC,Mundodeportivo also said this yesterday but today they said that the clause is that Madrid will get 10m extra if he comes to us
Barca,3b2fw0,Springsteemo,2,Thu Jun 25 14:32:20 2015 UTC,what a dick clause. our 2 CL wins over Man U really ticked off SAF I guess
Barca,3b2fw0,OmarLittleComing,13,Thu Jun 25 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"I think this was put in by the RM people,  not MU"
Barca,3b2fw0,Schadenfreudean_slip,6,Thu Jun 25 16:57:00 2015 UTC,"Di Maria has to pay €10m to RM if he goes back to the Liga  If he comes to Barça, which I'm not sure will happen, how much Barça would pay of the 10M depends on how much Di Maria wants to come, kind of like Mathieu"
Barca,3b2fw0,04andrew22,5,Thu Jun 25 16:18:03 2015 UTC,Di Maria struggled with the possession type system LVG implemented. He makes 0 sense for us. He should be in a counter attacking system which would play to his strengths.
Barca,3b2fw0,Schadenfreudean_slip,4,Thu Jun 25 14:50:55 2015 UTC,"We are not solely a possession-based team like we used to be, though. I think he struggled more at United because he was played out of position and was adjusting to a new league."

Barca,3b2fw0,OriginalUsername30,2,Thu Jun 25 15:11:32 2015 UTC,There is no way we get Kovacic for a straight swap. He's really valued at Inter and I could see him going for 30m+
Barca,3b2fw0,Micste,2,Thu Jun 25 15:27:12 2015 UTC,Song and Montoya could knock off ~15M though. I don't think anybody in their right mind would accept that straight swap...

The match ended right there and we all knew it.  The game was a joke after that and it feels like a garbage win to be honest.    (For those who didn't see it, Jara went up to Cavani, who already had a yellow, and stuck a finger up his ass (through his shorts).  Cavani pushed him off, but Jara made a a big show as if he had been punched in the face and this is what the ref saw and carded Cavani.  Cavani went a bit berserk after that, but didn't make any physical contact with anyone, just a lot of yelling.  It took a lot of people to restrain him. The Uruguay team went a little crazy afterwards as well, they just came unglued -- particularly as Cavani's first yellow was also pretty tame, but stupid for Cavani, for touching the ref.  They were playing really well and they knew it was all over.)"

Barca,3b07gx,Football_Enthusiast,11,Thu Jun 25 03:54:18 2015 UTC,A difficult question you've raised; I hope Messi will have no problem playing till 2020. I don't know will he be in his deadly form after he reaches 30 but hopefully he will play just fine even when he will be 32 or 33 years old.   As far as I know he takes good care of his body and his fitness is good; although we shouldn't expect playing out of the world football too much from him in the later part of his career but since he is a gifted player who is really passionate about football I hope Messi will continue playing at a high level till 2020.  Retirement is inevitable for any sportsman and I think Messi will finish his career at Barça no matter how many years he will continue to play and even when he won't play I think Barça will make him somehow involved with the club.  PS: It was really tough for me to write this and his retirement thought always tears my heart apart.
Barca,3b07gx,barcafor20,2,Thu Jun 25 08:19:15 2015 UTC,"I geniunely don't understand why people have such a preference for great players to ""finish their career at club x""; no offense to you as I see and hear this sentiment all the time.  The only way this actually happens is when someone retires at 33 or 34.  I'd prefer Messi plays until he's 40, even if he has to do that in the Argentinian league, the MLS, Qatar, or the Indian Super League.  This way we'll get to continue seeing highlights if nothing else..."
Barca,3b07gx,barcafor20,6,Wed Jun 24 22:57:33 2015 UTC,"Just look at Ronaldinho. Sure he isn't the jaw-dropping player he used to be, but every once in a while he does one of those moves that only a few players in the world can perform and you remember how awesome he can be."

Barca,3b07gx,polechi33,-1,Thu Jun 25 14:26:55 2015 UTC,"No top player in Europe finishes his career in Europe anymore. Messi will play for sure some time in Qatar and, probably Newell's in Argentina (the team he played in before signing for FCB and which he loves). If Messi stays in Barcelona until he's 34 and then wants to see other football and retire in his country, we should all be happy. And of course let's hope he comes back to work for FCB once he's left football."
Barca,3b07gx,frasier_crane,3,Thu Jun 25 15:07:41 2015 UTC,"If he leaves us, it would only be for Newll's. He won't go to Qatar, he already has money."
Barca,3b07gx,cdrawesome,0,Thu Jun 25 11:14:10 2015 UTC,"He has, but there's no such thing as ""enough money"". Imagine what he would get to stay there... 30M a year? 40M? It's completely understandable if he'd do it and we shall not think less of Messi if he does. Other top players like Pirlo, Raul or Villa already swim in money and even then decided to go to USA/Qatar/etc for a short time before retiring. I'd do the same and who wouldn't?"
Barca,3b07gx,honamdoh,2,Thu Jun 25 12:20:59 2015 UTC,"Not only money weights on this decision. After a while, the older player starts to not be fit enough to compete with the high quality/speed teams they go up against. But in the less-competitive leagues (US/Qatar/etc) they can still perform quite well without being so highly demanded. Take Xavi: There were moments when his age made him not-so-awesome as he used to be compared to other players. But in Qatar he will always be awesome, mostly because the average level of their league is lower"
Barca,3b07gx,froggerhasmelikewoah,10,Thu Jun 25 13:02:10 2015 UTC,"This is actually an important question.  Messi is at the peak of his powers right now and so is the club.  He's 28 which means he should be scary awesome until 32, possibly even 33, which puts us at 2020.  It should be noted Iniesta has dropped form this season and he's 31 with nearly the same ""workload"" as Messi.  It can be assumed that El Rey would assume a central role in the midfield (3-4-3 Diamond) by 32/33 and run the show from there.  It's also fairly obvious to me, and many others on here, that he is already doing that, certainly since mid-January of this year.  Thus, he - along with Suarez, Neymar, Rak, et al - will probably continue to ""rotate"" amongst the positions similar to what happened consistently over the final 4.5 months of the season.  At 33 one can assume Messi has the same amount of skill and form that others have had in the past - Puyol at 35, Purlo at 36, and Beckham around 37 (albeit with some years in MLS, right?).  Let's take the median and assume 36 - that's puts us around 2023 - at which point a golden statue will be erected down the road from La Sagrada Familia."

I'm kind of feeling sad that he is already 28; I don't will I be able to hold my tear when he will retire one day, probably not. I hope Messi will win few more UEFA Champions League for Barça before he retires and if the almighty is kind enough then hopefully Messi will be blessed with winning the FIFA World Cup 2018 which will most likely be his last World Cup.  Happy birthday and many many happy returns of the day to The Grandmaster of modern football: Lionel Messi.   Edit: Spelling and grammar correction."

Barca,3ax74h,lonestar_10,14,Wed Jun 24 05:45:23 2015 UTC,So he's nearing 1000 goals. Pele you better watch out. I think I vaguely remember Pele mention that when Messi reaches his goal tally then we should talk or something along those lines.

Barca,3ax74h,nannulators,-10,Wed Jun 24 15:26:43 2015 UTC,"I like Messi, but he still has no World Cup.   Similar debate when people were comparing Jordan to LeBron and LeBron didn't have any championships."
Barca,3ax74h,gottime4this,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:28:09 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying but I don't really think the comparison is quite the same for a few reasons.  First, because football has changed way more than the NBA has in terms of the talent pool available.   Second, because Pele played for a dominant Brazil. If Messi played competition that was that far below the level Argentina is at, he would win the WC too.   Third, the modern game is much different, and in many ways winning the CL is a better measure of the top players in the world currently.. I mean.. would you say Seedorf wasn't one of the best midfielders ever just because the Netherlands never won a World Cup?   Fourth, I don't think the 1000 goal mark would be the standard we would talking about if Pele had played outside of Brazil/the US. Can you imagine Messi's stats if he was playing in Argentina and the MLS his entire career?  For MJ/Lebron--If you look beyond the championships, there's still no point in comparing them because MJ was statistically much better and a much more complete player"

Barca,3ax74h,iwishiwasbased,2,Thu Jun 25 19:11:24 2015 UTC,"True. Not really relevant to football.  But: http://www.landofbasketball.com/player_comparison/j/lebron_james_vs_michael_jordan.htm  Lebron is a better rebounder (comes with his size) and I'm assuming he'll play for another 5-6 years at least, so he'll pass Jordan in a lot of the ""Total"" categories, but Jordan has better defensive stats than Lebron overall. Lebron is a scorer as well, but he also fulfills more of his team duties in terms of laying it off for teammates and going after rebounds.   And.. just.. this: http://i.imgur.com/AScsnRa.gif"

Barca,3ax4i6,Chillidawg,26,Wed Jun 24 05:16:45 2015 UTC,"He was incredible this season, his distribution is nothing short of amazing and he's going to be the best in the world. Who knows if he'll ever get minutes on the German  national team but I already feel more comfortable with him in the net than I ever did with Valdes. (other than his last season where he was incredible) I'm sure that's a pretty unpopular opinion around here, but I think Ter Stegen has shown how special he is and will be a cut above all the keepers in La Liga before too long. Here's to MaTS!"
Barca,3ax4i6,pepetrillvia,15,Wed Jun 24 06:05:28 2015 UTC,"I feel bad for Bravo, but Ter Stegen needs to play La Liga and CL next season. I feel excitement every time Ter Stegen gets the ball. This is a new experience and I love it!"

Barca,3ax4i6,IhateAngryBirds,5,Wed Jun 24 13:34:09 2015 UTC,"Bravo was better than Ter Stegen this season, extremely solid in the league. I don't see any reason to let Ter Stegen play in La liga AND the cups next season."
Barca,3ax4i6,Mentosfruitcore,2,Wed Jun 24 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"Barca will have to introduce Ter Stegen to La Liga pretty soon and I don't see Bravo taking the spot in CL. In best case scenario, Bravo will play the CDR. I cannot see another solution as Ter Stegen is bought for the future. It could happen in 2017, though. I really like Ter Stegen and I don't want him to be unhappy."
Barca,3ax4i6,Inspector-Norse,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:42:37 2015 UTC,"Sure, he is bought for the future... But Bravo is a more capable goalkeeper who has had a better season. There is no reason to give Ter Stegen the first spot because he is young, when Bravo is playing like he does."
Barca,3ax4i6,Mentosfruitcore,4,Wed Jun 24 15:29:48 2015 UTC,"Their seasons can't be compared, ter Stegen did face harder opponents."
Barca,3ax4i6,IhateAngryBirds,0,Wed Jun 24 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"Well, Bravo faced some very tough opponents as well, and played more matches. I think you can compare their seasons, and Bravo had a better season than Ter Stegen imo."
Barca,3ax4i6,Mentosfruitcore,6,Wed Jun 24 18:08:29 2015 UTC,"Bravo faced Sevilla, Valencia, atleti, Real, And Villarreal. Out of all the Liga teams these were easily the strongest he faced this year. Ter Stegen faced PSG 4 times, atleti, Villarreal, Man City, Bayern, and Juve. Aside from Real Madrid who Ter Stegen has yet to play against, the attacking forces that he was up against were undeniably better than the ones bravo faced in La Liga."
Barca,3ax4i6,pepetrillvia,-1,Wed Jun 24 19:44:06 2015 UTC,"In the end this comparison of matches played against which teams is pretty useless. All that matters is how the player performed. The fact that one player went up against tougher opponents isn't worth anything in itself. What matters is the players performance and abilities, and that's where Bravo exceeds."
Barca,3ax4i6,Mentosfruitcore,2,Wed Jun 24 20:07:42 2015 UTC,"He played more, but against weaker opponents, sorry but in La Liga you have very few (4-5) teams with offensive capabilities like in the CL"
Barca,3ax4i6,IhateAngryBirds,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"Well, how many teams with offensive qualities did we even meet in CL? That would be... 4-5 teams, right?"
Barca,3ax4i6,Mentosfruitcore,4,Wed Jun 24 18:56:22 2015 UTC,"PSG twice thats 4 games, Ajax twice, City twice, Bayern twice, Juventus once. Not to mention he also had to face Sevilla Villareal and Atletico twice on the Copa. In Liga you have, Sevilla, Atletico and RM who're great on the offense, then Valencia who's a bit tamer and thats it."
Barca,3ax4i6,IhateAngryBirds,3,Wed Jun 24 19:14:40 2015 UTC,"i don't know how you count villareal for ter stegen, but not bravo. Both keepers are excellent keepers and I truest enrique to make a good decision."
Barca,3ax4i6,tgames56,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:13:37 2015 UTC,"Atletico, Villareal, Valencia(Did you watch the game, Bravo even saved a penalty), Sevilla, Real Madrid. That's 10 games, compared to your 9(If Ajax is a ""strong team"" I could list many others)... But comparing number of games isn't really constructive. You're better of just comparing their abilities, and that's were Bravo shines."
Barca,3ax4i6,Mentosfruitcore,2,Wed Jun 24 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"And in which ability is Bravo better though, I recall during our first 10 games of La Liga we had something silly like 3 shoots on our target or something silly.   I just don't see a reason why we wouldn't want MatS to play Liga and CL next season, after all that's what we're gonna see for the next 10 years or so. It's pointless to delay his development."
Barca,3ax4i6,IhateAngryBirds,-1,Wed Jun 24 20:01:34 2015 UTC,"The biggest reason to keep playing Bravo over Ter Stegen in Liga is because he is a more capable goalkeeper, simple as that. If you disagree, that's fine. I have the management on my side."
Barca,3ax4i6,Mentosfruitcore,7,Wed Jun 24 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, ter Stegen is a promising keeper but Bravo is the best of the two for now.  Bravo saved us a lot of points in the Liga this year; he was really really good.  ter Stegen had a shaky start to his Barcelona career but improved a lot; his ball distribution is Neuer level or even better.  Howver, ter Stegen wasn't very convincing when things started to get serious.   I don't want to be in Lucho's place. It is very difficult to choose one of them. Bravo is great. ter Stegen WILL be great.  Bravo still has many years in top level in him; ter Stegen needs all the playing time he can get in order to become one of the greatest GKs ever. Difficult choice."
Barca,3ax4i6,Duke--Nukem,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:33:15 2015 UTC,ter Stegen wasn't very convincing when things started to get serious   Like the second leg vs Bayern.
Barca,3ax4i6,darthvader7888,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:04:16 2015 UTC,"That was a good match by him. But see, when you're leading 3-0 from the first leg you can be more relaxed... and that's my point.  He didn't play well during Copa Del Rey final. Bravo wouldn't have let that goal in.  I hope he'll progress fast; and for him to do so, he needs to play :/"
Barca,3ax4i6,Duke--Nukem,14,Thu Jun 25 14:01:34 2015 UTC,"Ter Stegen has a very bright future at the club, and has already shown a very high level of maturity. It definitely is not easy for him to play in the most demanding club in the world, in an unfamiliar setting. Hopefully his Spanish/Catalan is becoming more fluent. He certainly looks at home here."
Barca,3ax4i6,lonestar_10,5,Wed Jun 24 05:52:40 2015 UTC,"Hopefully his Spanish/Catalan is becoming more fluent.    I think that's one of the things I like most about him. He really wants to be at Barca, reflecting in learning Catalan and when he spoke at the celebration night in the stadium.   Plus he's the perfect archetype for a sweeper keeper. His distribution is so excellent. I love it."
Barca,3ax4i6,ShotgunToothpaste,7,Thu Jun 25 02:16:53 2015 UTC,"for his first season at a club like Barcelona he did fantastically well.  some amazing saves and great reflexes and my word those accurate passes, i feel like he could play as a midfielder without problems.  i cant remember any big errors, except the verratti goal vs PSG   or the long range screamer (cant remember who it was exactly, i think villareal in CDR) but even than, the ball took a slight swerve right in front of him.  overall fantastic keeper and to think he s only what? 23 years old.  we got a gem in our team, i hope he ll play some Liga Games too next season"

Barca,3ax4i6,XsTream23,10,Thu Jun 25 12:35:37 2015 UTC,"Great goalkeeper, and definitely the future of this club. BUT, he can often get too comfy on the ball, and do some Pinto-esque man-what-on-earth-are-you-doing stuff. Which we've seen more than we should.  But it's his first season, and he'll only get better."
Barca,3ax4i6,flackohowyoubeen,2,Wed Jun 24 12:00:49 2015 UTC,"Don't have much new to offer in terms of how he did this season, I'm very excited for him in the future, love the way he plays with the ball, perfect long-term Valdes replacement in that regard.  Anyway, what I really came here to say is, moment of the season is his recovery to swipe the ball off the line in Munich. Incredible desire and agility."
Barca,3ax4i6,GlobalHero,4,Wed Jun 24 22:27:35 2015 UTC,"MATS has adjusted really well this season. He was good but not great. I feel like our strong defense made it hard for him to have any stellar performances, but his distribution was insane. I have no doubt that he will be one of the greatest keepers in the world within a few years."
Barca,3ax4i6,IhateAngryBirds,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:59:35 2015 UTC,"Big MatS fan, want him to get the league and CL next year. Hope he stays with us untill late 30s :p  As for best moment, must have been when he stopped the ball with his chest, only to send a long pass straight into teammates feet."
Barca,3ax4i6,Flam1,4,Wed Jun 24 13:36:25 2015 UTC,It's an unpopular opinion here but I prefer Bravo. Mats is still very good though. He's also young and our future so we should give him some playing time. I like to keep things the same. Bravo La Liga and Mats should play in the CL and cup matches just like this season
Barca,3ax4i6,mettacitta,3,Wed Jun 24 16:58:20 2015 UTC,"Mats is the future but I agree, I prefer Bravo. If my life depended on it I would choose Bravo every time. Rock solid, commanding presence, great for club and country. We're spoilt for choice indeed"

Barca,3awomq,CanadaCommie,30,Wed Jun 24 02:43:07 2015 UTC,"Why the obsession with buying a midfielder?   Because Xavi just left   Why not buy a CB instead and move Busquets and/or Mascherano farther up the pitch?   Players don't adapt to new positions as easy as you might think   We've already got so many world class players that can play midfield   Not considering the DM position, we used to have three WORLD CLASS players (Iniesta, Rakitic and Xavi). Now we have two. Is as simple as that.   You could replace Xavi with Denis Suarez for example, but that'd be a big risk if Rakitic or Iniesta get a serious injury. In that case, we would be pretty much say good bye to all trophies (unless D.Suarez surprises everyone and really becomes world class super fast)"
Barca,3awomq,godie,10,Wed Jun 24 03:34:30 2015 UTC,What about Rafinha? Sergi Roberto?
Barca,3awomq,Hype11,15,Wed Jun 24 09:21:58 2015 UTC,"Sergi Roberto I don't see anything in him ... Rafinha needs to explode, but really has talent."
Barca,3awomq,TimeFingers,3,Wed Jun 24 09:27:39 2015 UTC,"Compared to Denis Suarez or why not considering them for a Xavi replacement? Denis shows much more promise than them, they're good players and good enough for Barca but not world class, that's why much more serious names are thrown around for bringing a new mid - Pogba, Koke, etc."
Barca,3awomq,46_and_2,5,Wed Jun 24 09:43:21 2015 UTC,"Denis shows more promise than Rafinha? Disagree entirely. I think the two are very comparable, it'll be a crapshoot to see which one succeeds at Barça. Right now I'd bet on Rafinha."
Barca,3awomq,egcg119,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:29:53 2015 UTC,"There are no replacements for Xavi. We should have that mind. New players may come, and they may be good, but no one is like Xavi.  Edit: I'm not saying Xavi's the best player in football history (Messi), but I believe that his role (both in the field and off it) is one that no other player can achieve because he had his very own style in everything."
Barca,3awomq,EpicChiguire,2,Wed Jun 24 14:15:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, totally agree with you, nobody can replace him, he's a legend. But club will go high and low to find someone else in midfield that's world class and deciding as him."

Barca,3awomq,DonAndres8,2,Thu Jun 25 04:06:36 2015 UTC,Tata martino pushed busquest up and put masche as DM and that did not work. but they can coexist when they both play as DM i recall LE trying it at least few games in the closing stages of the game to slow down the opposition
Barca,3awomq,strayluck,11,Fri Jun 26 00:51:11 2015 UTC,It's our weakest position atm.
Barca,3awomq,MayIHaveAHug,11,Wed Jun 24 03:29:04 2015 UTC,"Barca's strength has always been in the midfield through possession and setting the pace of the game. With Iniesta growing older, and Xavi leaving it's a smart idea to bring in youth that will grow for the first few years under the existing mids and replace them once they grow older. Which seems to be a perfect definition of what Pogba  is to a lot of the people on this board. IMO I believe with all the mids we have coming from La Masia we aren't in desperate need for one."
Barca,3awomq,Davdaq,7,Wed Jun 24 03:29:44 2015 UTC,Because the midfield was by far the weakest line this season.
Barca,3awomq,Eladir,12,Wed Jun 24 07:47:33 2015 UTC,"If we buy a midfielder in order to groom him for the future I'd understand. Neymar would be the standalone example for that but Pogba, I am not so sure either. We have a fantastic Midfield as it is. However, my understanding is that we have Iniesta and Rakitic. But we do not have a substitute of the level of Xavi coming in when required.   What we have is definitely raw talent but we cannot possible play the same midfield the entire season. It is detrimental tactically speaking. That being said, we need someone whom we can groom in to take the role of the midfielder to fall in place as well as someone so we can rotate them and gain balance towards the tactical battles in the midfield.   There is an old saying in football, control the midfield, control the world."
Barca,3awomq,wish5138008,-2,Wed Jun 24 02:53:45 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree. Pogba will disrupt the midfield and dressing room as he and his agent are prima donnas. He will want to be a starter right away with a giant salary and that's not what we need right now, for the team or the upcoming youth (Rafinha, Suarez, etc.). I'd rather have Gundogan come in as he won't be as needy and can fill in at several positions in the midfield.  Edit: Would love to get some responses if you're going to downvote. I obviously am not denying his skill and potential and impact on the team, I just don't think it's the right timing for him."
Barca,3awomq,Marchisio,-1,Wed Jun 24 13:18:10 2015 UTC,Agreed. Gundogan or someone like Kovatic or Koke would be better.
Barca,3awomq,Mentosfruitcore,5,Wed Jun 24 14:10:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I was going to mention Kovacic as well but he recently signed and extension and Inter doesn't want to seem to let him go and are rebuilding so I didn't bother. Koke is another who is probably unrealistic as he's very dedicated to Atletico unfortunately.
Barca,3awomq,Marchisio,3,Wed Jun 24 14:18:21 2015 UTC,"They just bought Kondogbia for 40 million, they have to sell some players... The best way to go for Barcelona would be to sign him and lend him out until next window, as unlikely that is."
Barca,3awomq,Mentosfruitcore,4,Wed Jun 24 14:28:25 2015 UTC,"Busi best position is DM, why would you want to move him farther up the pitch knowing that busi does much better job than masch in barca DM position. We need to sign a young potential midfielder to rotate with Iniesta and replace him eventually. We will sign him for next season only and he will rotate with iniesta and rakitic and will eventually become a starter.   As much as i like Rafinha, he is not settling that well in CM position. He is more of a AM and RW type. He might adapt and get his starter place and even samper might adapt to CM role. My best suggestion would be wait for one season and then sign a good midfielder. Our depth in that position isn't that good either."
Barca,3awomq,Icarium_lifestealer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:29:04 2015 UTC,"As much as the future is important, the next season is important too. If iniesta/rakitic gets injured, its bye bye to trophies!"

Barca,3awomq,Icarium_lifestealer,0,Wed Jun 24 07:07:40 2015 UTC,"Your example is the best. If we have Messi on our team, do we sign another world class striker to replace him thinking about if Messi gets injured? NO! Then why this attitude towards the midfield? Let's trust the youngsters, that's what we owe them, that's what we owe to La Masia, the factory of exquisite brilliance for more than a decade atleast(I meant the team that went on to win 4 CL in a decade. Not discrediting the earlier contributions of previous gen players, just remarking the fact that this gen has been out of this world)"
Barca,3awomq,invice,11,Wed Jun 24 08:42:03 2015 UTC,"Mascherano isn't good enough at distributing the ball to start as a DM. His skill set works there in certain match situations and against certain teams, but he's a liability against top opponents in the midfield. A good example is how he struggled vs. RM in the first clásico. Busi is passable playing further up the pitch, but he goes from being the best DM in the world, to a ""decent"" midfielder. It's a huge waste. Also Masch is pretty awesome at that corrector CB role. His only weakness is height. To be honest, against teams that require a distributor at DM rather than a destroyer I prefer Sergi Roberto or perhaps Samper (if he's ready).   Iniesta still has magic in his boots, but he's fading, anyone can see it, and it's doubtful we can count on him as an every match starter for much longer. His replacement on the left is probably Rakitic, but we need somebody to play the physical role that Rakitic played this season. A Pogba type player would be ideal in LE's system. Rafinha fits in there somewhere, as does Denis Suarez. Both will have a make or break season next year. Although I think Rafinha's a lock to continue, I'm not sure Suarez is good enough."
Barca,3awomq,_sic,3,Wed Jun 24 08:06:08 2015 UTC,With Iniesta's situation I think getting Pogba cup tied in January would not be a bad deal at all. Iniesta could focus on the CL and Copa and Pogba could be integrated thoroughly through Liga games. Next season he'd be ready to start. Can't imagine him deciding to miss the better part of CL though.
Barca,3awomq,vanNostrandby,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:52:16 2015 UTC,I doubt Pogba would come before summer 2016.
Barca,3awomq,_sic,2,Wed Jun 24 08:53:25 2015 UTC,"Which is what makes Barça's situation a bit problematic if they wanna stay competetive next season. They probably need to buy someone to strengthen the midfield but if they can't go big until the Summer of 2016, who are they going to buy for those important months? Man, I hope Suarez delivers."
Barca,3awomq,vanNostrandby,2,Wed Jun 24 08:56:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly, that's why Suarez is coming back and why Enrique told Sergi Roberto to stay another season. They are going to feature as squad players next season until a bigger name can be signed, unless of course they blossom. Maybe Samper will be promoted as well. I don't see it as a major problem, unless Rakitic or Iniesta go down with a long injury."
Barca,3awomq,_sic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:59:12 2015 UTC,Why not let Rakitic continue the physical role? I don't see any reason to buy Pogba when we already have a perfect nr 4 in Rakitic.
Barca,3awomq,Mentosfruitcore,3,Wed Jun 24 14:13:21 2015 UTC,Because that's not Rakitic's strength. He's blew up at Sevilla playing as a mediapunta with a great last ball. He's more suited to playing creatively closer to the area than being a workhorse.
Barca,3awomq,_sic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:26:13 2015 UTC,"Because Xavi left and we need a new world class midfielder.  If Pogba arrives we would need to make him fit in the team, thus moving Rakitic to Iniesta's position.  However, we could not get Pogba and get someone else, that would directly cover for Iniesta (and Rakitic staying at his mos physical role)"

However, we could not get Pogba and get someone else, that would directly cover for Iniesta (and Rakitic staying at his mos physical role)   This is what we need to do instead. I'd like to see Veratti or someone similiar. A creative player, not another Rakitic."
Barca,3awomq,Mentosfruitcore,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:18:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in that I'm not super keen on Pogba. I also would prefer Verrati. But with Verrati it would be the same situation I beleive, he would take the physical role and and Rakitic the more advanced role.  If we would want to get someone to play in for Iniesta one option is Koke, as he likes to play more advanced"
Barca,3awomq,godie,-1,Wed Jun 24 16:35:25 2015 UTC,"i think mascherano is the perfect DM for the new style of Barca, the best possible choice in the world.  i actually prefer some of his more direct distribution and how he doesn't hold the ball too long like Busquets when we're in our own half.  He's also probably the best possible choice at the ""corrector"" CB role, too, though."

Barca,3awomq,_sic,2,Wed Jun 24 18:25:13 2015 UTC,the game in october? i'll go watch it again when i get a chance.  but wasn't he in defense for that match? looks like our midfield was busquets xavi iniesta until xavi was subbed for rakitic.
Barca,3awomq,mekane84,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:42:18 2015 UTC,well i just loaded up the match and you are mistaken.  busquets was playing DM this match not mascherano.  i do agree that the midfield was overrun in this game.
Barca,3awomq,mekane84,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:47:44 2015 UTC,"I see him more as a souped up version of Guardiola, distributing from the back while still defending like a DM."
Barca,3awomq,_sic,5,Wed Jun 24 18:49:27 2015 UTC,Because we let go Thiago and Fabregas who were supposed to replace Xavi and Iniesta.
Barca,3awomq,bezbol,3,Wed Jun 24 18:50:43 2015 UTC,"Fabregas didn't turn out as we expected. Thiago, on the other hand..."
Barca,3awomq,EpicChiguire,2,Wed Jun 24 06:16:59 2015 UTC,"We don't need a new CB, we have four pure Cbs in the team (Pique, Bartra, Mthieu, and Vermanelen) add to that Mascherano. So we have 5 options for 2 spots and they all have a great level, so that is why we don't need a new CB right now.  We shoudn't move Busquets up in the pitch, Lucho was tried that this season. Moving Busi up is transforming the best CDM in the world into an average midfielder. Mascherano is great, but I would prefer Busi as a starter. I like Masche as a sub for Busquets and a CB option.  Iniesta and Rakitic are our starters, but we lack depth. Right now we only have Rafinha, but he still has a lot to grow (please let's not count Sergi Roberto as a sub for Iniesta or Rakitic, he lacks the ability). So we need a new CB to take Xavi's spot.  Who are the many world class midfielders we have? For theCDM we have Busuqets and Mascherano, yes they are both world class but can only play in that position. Higher on the pitch we have Rakitic and Iniesta, Rafinha is very promising but is not a world class player, yet."
Barca,3awomq,polechi33,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:17:44 2015 UTC,"Yup, we simply need options for an aging Iniesta. Gundogan or Kovatic would be awesome."
Barca,3awomq,Mentosfruitcore,2,Wed Jun 24 12:42:05 2015 UTC,"Lucho asked for one, maybe he wants to play some configuration of 3-4-3 in the upcoming season like Pep did in his last season in Barca. If that's the case, he wants more hard working all around midfielders to give cover on defense, hence the rumor about Pogba and Gundongen"
Barca,3awomq,A_F_R,3,Wed Jun 24 14:17:03 2015 UTC,"Because culés need something to talk about besides the elections!

Barca,3awomq,46_and_2,2,Wed Jun 24 09:15:22 2015 UTC,Yeah.. Messi will make a transition to the midfield when he is 32-33.
Barca,3awomq,polechi33,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:49:25 2015 UTC,We buy a new midfielder to replace Xavi. But Xavi was not even that essential this season. He was good but not part of the start 11.

I agree, Rafinha needs time and have the chance to develop, but we lack depth. Right now we only have Iniesta, Rakitic and Rafinha for two spots, we need one more player there (please don't count Sergi Roberto as an option)."
Barca,3awomq,polechi33,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:33:59 2015 UTC,"We have Iniesta, Rakitic, Roberto, Rafinha and Denis for 2 spots. If we buy a new midfielder then 1 or 2 of them will need to go. So who is not good enough to get 20-30 matches a year? They all have the quality to become great players if they are lucky. So how will the talents even get a chance? When will Bartra get a chance with 5 players for 2 positions?"
Barca,3awomq,JurijFedorov,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:50:04 2015 UTC,"Until the deal is not done for Denis Suarez you cannot count him as a squad players, that is just a possibility among many. If we get a great midfilder who improves our team right away, I would take him. We can always let Denis Suarez go, we have no really an attachment to him. Denis is a La Masia youth product. On the other hand, hopefully Rafinha shows his worth and he stays for a long... time.  About the Barta situation, like we say in Spanish: no mescles papas con cebollas. It means don't mix potatoes with onions, they are different subjects and situations. But I agree, Bartra needs a chance, I hope he plays more next season."
Barca,3awomq,polechi33,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:57:08 2015 UTC,"We have 5 quality CBs currently, why on earth would you buy a CB? I feel like you're writing this from a year ago."
Barca,3awomq,egcg119,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:20:26 2015 UTC,"Imo it's not find a xavi replacement but another midfielder that fits criteria lucho wants.. Xavi btw doesn't have the skillset lucho wants and that is fine  He wants 2 box to box players helping to defend and create space and passing options for our 3 forwards.   Under lucho it's clear that he wants creative duty to be more on MSN, once iniesta and xavi became less decisive as they got older   Denis suarez and Rafinha are more offensive players, they'll be taking Messi role if Luis suarez or neymar are out and Messi move to striker position, Rafinha struggled replacing iniesta and rakitic, he was often found out of position,and hes not explosive enough   Iniesta is great, but we have to use him moderately,"
Barca,3awomq,Melobyrro,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:31:15 2015 UTC,"Here's the skinny in my opinion:   We have enough CB for the next 3-4 years as is.  Barta is 24, Gerard is 27, Verm is 29, and Masche/Jeremy are 31.  That's plenty of depth, skill, and form left.   Our current starting Midfield is great: Busi (26), Iniesta (31), Rak (27).  Our subs can fill lower tier games in the interim, however, Raf isn't read to play CM and should be a wing (noted below), Samper is medicore in my opinion, Roberto is ok, and we don't know how Suarez will look when he gets back from loan (next year).  Iniesta is down in form this year and will only slip further.  He can take Xavi's sub role in 2016, but for now he needs to bear the load of another potential 60 game season.  Assuming, of course, we don't buy a world class player in January.  One can argue Busi could move up (no), Masche could play CDM (not as good as Busi), Samper could move up (like Xavi and Iniesta did), Dani could play a role similar to what him and Rak did this season when Vidal plays RB, etc.  None of those ideas are really solutions long-term.  Do the make sense near-term?  Sure.  But a solution? No.  So we need a young CM that can play physical and serve us for at least the next 3-4 years while Rak and Busi are still in their prime.  I don't know the answer to that question but the obvious Pogba, Ilkay, Koke, etc. are all out there...at least in theory.  But we absolutely need a midfielder by summer of 2016. As for the forwards we have, besides MSN, Munir, Sandro, Pedro, Raf, and Adama.  Everyone needs improvement with the exception of MSN and should get that next year will ample rotation.  The bottom line is that we have at least 4 more years of incredible play from the strikers in the coming years.   Mathematically we have quality everywhere except with regards to depth in the midfield.  We have Grimaldo at LB to support Alba (26) and obviously Alves (31)/Vidal (24) at RB.  This means we can look foward to 3-4 more years of greatness as long we can increase our ability/skill/depth in the midfield with an actual solution to the problem.  Relying on Iniesta's continued form past the summer of 2016 is a fool's errand in my opinion.

It's not the same as lying about the neymar transfer fee or getting us into the transfer ban boondoggle, mismanagement of barca b.  The only person who is upset about this is escobar because he lost out on the interview for that night, ffs you want to dislike bart I am right there with you but you aren't allowed to be ridiculous with your reasons, latching onto the slightest of things."

Barca,3auuay,polechi33,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:27:16 2015 UTC,"People like to laugh at Douglas, because he's obviously not good enough for Barça, but he's a professional player who was at a big club in Brazil. Physically, and with the ball in attack, he's not bad at all. I've read that people who have watched training sessions live were pleasantly surprised at how he performed there. Of course he has no clue how to defend and I think the pressure of playing at Camp Nou, with so many people criticizing his transfer, also weighed heavy on him. To be honest, although he's not exactly the same type of FB, I'd put him on a similar level as a player like Montoya.   Which is to say good, just not good enough. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see him do well at a smaller club."

Barca,3atasa,ComfyRug,7,Tue Jun 23 09:56:43 2015 UTC,Putting a man with no experience outside the football pitch in charge of the sporting project for the largest club in the world.

Barca,3atasa,elanciano31,0,Tue Jun 23 18:27:21 2015 UTC,isn't it just a counter play to having laudrup as sporting director? I think either are as qualified.
Barca,3atasa,Hedegaard,20,Tue Jun 23 09:59:30 2015 UTC,"What? Abidal who never, ever managed a club and has only very brief experience with technical management in a greece club is as qualified as Michael Laudrup who has 15 years of management experience, nevermind not in a big clubs? Well lets just say I would be very surprised if Abi would have a half of Laudrups knowledge about club management.  I'm afraid that this is only Laportas stunt. I would love to see Abidal return to Barca, but he cannot begin his managerial career with such a huge task. He should begin as Puyol did. Or better yet as Nedved in Juve who at first was only a little more than clubs ""famous face"" but today is one of the key people in Juve management."
Barca,3atasa,alterpsyche,-4,Tue Jun 23 11:59:51 2015 UTC,"I see where you are coming from, I just from what I've seen so far, do not put too much importance in the sporting director in Barca. If you look at how it's been run so far it doesn't really seem to matter who holds that position. I might be totally off base here, as I've not devoted a lot of time to get to know that side of the inner workings at Barca."
Barca,3atasa,Hedegaard,6,Tue Jun 23 12:11:42 2015 UTC,"Well of course it matters who holds the position. Not in short term of course but has huge long term influence on the club. Sporting director is arguably the most important position, even more than main coach, because he is the one (or one of those) who pick the new coach."
Barca,3atasa,alterpsyche,-1,Tue Jun 23 12:26:48 2015 UTC,"Yes in theory but is that really how it works? From what I've seen I'd argue no, but again I'm probably wrong."
Barca,3atasa,Hedegaard,4,Tue Jun 23 12:31:21 2015 UTC,"What you have seen, I presume, is only media coverage. No reporter ever will cover what is really happening in everyday club management (and I mean the boring office stuff, which counts the most, not the cool stuff like squad formations, video analysis, tactics, pep talks and player transfers) because no one will ever read that stuff."
Barca,3atasa,alterpsyche,2,Tue Jun 23 12:40:57 2015 UTC,"Sure, it's difficult seeing what's really being decided from that position. Esp. since everyone wants to be the guy that signed/found the next Messi. But thank's for you insight :)"
Barca,3atasa,Hedegaard,3,Tue Jun 23 13:22:04 2015 UTC,I know everyone pissed themselves like excited little puppies when abidal was brought out but Laudrup has way more experience and would be a way better person for the job.

Probably explains why we signed Keirrison for 14 million euro and he never made an appearance for the club.  Or when he signed Chygrynskiy for 21 million euro and he made 9 appearances.  Or now at man city txiki dumped 42 million on Mangala who had no right commanding such a fee and Bony for another 25 million...maybe txiki should stop being a reference point for everyone:  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/11476604/Manchester-City-have-barely-progressed-at-all-despite-spending-327m-since-2011.html

Barca,3atasa,alterpsyche,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:05:31 2015 UTC,"I actually think this is as good a start as any for Abi. Look, we all know he has spirit and the strength to succeed. No one's doubting that. That's a huge plus.  He also knows the ins and outs of the French league, which is full of young talent. He also knows the core of today's team. Yes, a lot has changed since he last turned out in Blaugrana but he would still have formed a relationship with the likes of Pique, Alves, Iniesta, Pedro and Messi. And he would have seen the Masia teams as well. He'd have good insight into what makes a Barca player. He would know which youngsters would gel in well and who'd not fit.   I would think he knows a lot more about the club, the players who have flourished here, and our ethos and culture, than he's being given credit for."
Barca,3aufdb,Preciy,6,Tue Jun 23 16:26:17 2015 UTC,I don't know much about Benedito but he seems to be quite rational. He's trying to see the good in everything but also remains focused to the ideals of the club.  Laporta is pretty convincing of how the current board has treated the integrity of the club in recent times. He mentions the club being bought by Qatar financiers and turning our back on UNICEF and at the same time he mentions how the board didn't focus on the B team. They let the team slip into relegation and haven't focused on cultivating superstars of the future.  I have no voting power obviously but if I did I might vote for Benedito just to have a fresh face in office otherwise I'd vote for Laporta.   What is everyone else's opinion?

One bad point can kill a good article. The article didn't give proper credit to what Lucho doing to La Masia talents as first team manager but criticize him.
Barca,3atoyz,ir7425,7,Tue Jun 23 14:51:40 2015 UTC,Both Lucas and Rafael have never liked L.Enrique. They were probably the loudest cule's on Twitter calling for Lucho's sacking. Both of them had to shallow their pride and words since Lucho turned things around.
Barca,3atoyz,wavechappelle,2,Tue Jun 23 15:40:56 2015 UTC,"Proper credit? What has Lucho done for the canteranos since becoming manager? He can get credit when he actually brings through and establishes one or two academy players into the first team - like Pep did with Busquets and Pedro. Of course, it may have been hard to do so in his pressurized first season, but next season he must make progress on that front."
Barca,3atoyz,ir7425,2,Tue Jun 23 20:57:19 2015 UTC,"He played Munir fair amount of games. Even in the match against Real Sociedad, he started Munir & we all blamed him why he played Munir instead of Messi-Neymar. In the match against Almeria(2-1), he started Munir, we all blamed him during half-time why Luis Suarez & Neymar isn't playing.  He is only his first season. Did Busquets or Pedro were regular in Pep's first season? NO. Pedro became regular 2nd half of Pep's 2nd second. Wait until Luis Enrique's 2nd season to judge him.   In the article, writers praise Pep for debuting 28 La Masia players. In this scale why Lucho won't get credit debut/featuring 7 La Masia players? Besides, Rafinha becomes regular in his time. Masip got debuted too. If he doesn't get credit now, at least he doesn't deserve criticism."
Barca,3atoyz,wavechappelle,2,Tue Jun 23 21:16:30 2015 UTC,"Fair enough re. Munir, but it's one thing to play someone a few times, another to establish him. And yes, it was Lucho's first season as I said, so we'll see how he progresses in his second.   Busquets became a regular in Pep's first season. He was starting CL games before Christmas iirc. And I believe Pedro was playing from the start of Pep's second season. Scored the match winner in the Supercup."
Barca,3atoyz,ir7425,2,Tue Jun 23 21:43:27 2015 UTC,"You are right. Busquets played some 30+ games including sub in 1st season, mainly playing group stage CL & Copa games. In knockout stage, he played only one match & played final due to Alves suspension. Initially, He got his minutes when Iniesta was injured, but started league games ahead of Toure later stage of the season. Pedro became regular 2nd half of the 2nd season & in first half, he mainly started while Henry was injured. Henry started games after returning form injury but he didn't reach the level once he was. Pedro started most of his games after winter break.  Anyway, my argument was on Lucho. We will see what his plans are this season especially with Bartra, Rafinha, Samper, Roberto (& if D. Suarez returns)."
Barca,3atoyz,egcg119,5,Tue Jun 23 22:19:26 2015 UTC,"I really disliked the comments on Lucho and Bartra (felt it was exaggerated to fit a narrative), but other than that it's a fabulous article, extraordinarily nuanced with an insider's view. Highly recommend reading it."

Barca,3atoyz,YoSoyMilkChocolate,2,Tue Jun 23 14:07:12 2015 UTC,Yep.  Posted a snippet of the article a couple of days ago.    http://www.reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/3ago58/bartomeu_rosell_atrocious_treat_of_two_la_masia/  Disgraceful actions by the board.
Barca,3auror,PhantomHunter23,5,Tue Jun 23 17:53:30 2015 UTC,Who will he replace in the starting 11? Well that would be up to Lucho and I expect him to rotate a lot until he settles on his final 11  I don't think anybody expects him to directly replace a player as legendary as iniesta. He might take his spot but he will fulfill a different role on the team. This is a new Barca after all.
Barca,3auror,MayIHaveAHug,3,Tue Jun 23 18:35:50 2015 UTC,"The theory is, he plays the attacking mid role that Iniesta plays, but essentially he would be taking the spots of potential Rafinha, Suarez or even Sergi Roberto while prematurely taking the spot of Iniesta (while he still can perform) because of his high price tag."
Barca,3auror,domi_28,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:39:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the truth is he's better then Suarez, Rafinha and Roberto, a lot better and they will never come close to his potential or even where he is now, no la masia mid will be able to emulate him at least with the current la masia players."
Barca,3auror,FrostyGrass,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:06:56 2015 UTC,this idea of getting the best players in every position and paying billions of dollars to get them while suppressing* your youth movement has been tried by our neighbors. not effective edit*
Barca,3auror,domi_28,2,Fri Jun 26 15:07:42 2015 UTC,It would be Iniesta and he would play as LCM. There would be rotation though
Barca,3auror,Aj16ay,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:37:07 2015 UTC,"Great player with huge potential but we really shouldn't buy him, esp at the price. I'd rather Gundogan"
Barca,3auror,mettacitta,3,Tue Jun 23 21:18:21 2015 UTC,"He'd likely replace Iniesta in big matches, and Iniesta would see similar playing time to Xavi last year.   Such a waste of money"
Barca,3auror,aleks19998,8,Tue Jun 23 17:56:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be a waste, I mean Pogba has a long long long long career of him ahead. What worries me is his agent, he'll probably end up moving after 2-3 years anyway if he's signed."
Barca,3auror,IhateAngryBirds,4,Tue Jun 23 18:06:27 2015 UTC,"Don't know the future but it reminds me of Cesc.  In big matches we can't drop Xavi-Iniesta. So to accommodate Cesc, we had to imbalance the team.   Now the trident is impossible to bench. Iniesta is not getting bench role until 33-34 especially his dressing room value >>> any other new signing. No manager would like to disrespect him. That even might cause dressing room problem. If Pogba comes, to place him, we might see staring 3-4-3, sacrificing a defender."
Barca,3auror,ir7425,5,Tue Jun 23 18:38:00 2015 UTC,"I think it would be a waste, 3 years of Pogba isn't worth prematurely forcing Iniesta or Rakitic from the starting XL plus taking time away from Rafinha/Denis"
Barca,3auror,aleks19998,0,Tue Jun 23 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree, but waste of money it would never be, because Pogba will end up being worth more than what he is at the moment.   Also dunno how I feel about Rafinha, I just haven't been able to see him as good as he was in Celta, but that's a discussion for the player thread eventually."
Barca,3auror,IhateAngryBirds,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:15:39 2015 UTC,Except that we always have a way of buying high and selling low...
Barca,3auror,xscientist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:52:50 2015 UTC,"You need 3 quality players for those 2 positions anyway with rotations and injuries, and Iniesta will be 32 next summer. Getting the best option available and giving him time integrate himself in the team makes plenty of sense."
Barca,3auror,ChinggisKhagan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:12:48 2015 UTC,"Depends. Will he join the team on winter? Then he'll most likely replace Rafinha. He'll get the rotation minutes of both, Rakitic and Iniesta.  If he joins the next summer, the most obvious candidate is Iniesta, but I don't think this will happen without him giving a good fight."
Barca,3auror,astral_cowboy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:21:02 2015 UTC,"He'll fit in fine in terms our what Lucho is looking for in our current midfield. I personally hope Samper turns out to be a better player than Pogba, but if getting him brings more drive and competition for Rafinha and Samper, so be it.   I don't think he would link up well with MSN. Pogba would be the opposite of Fabregas, bad associative play with Messi, great athleticism and great dribbling.   He's best role would be receiving passes from Busi or the defenders, play his way out of pressure, before laying a simple pass to a player between the line."
Barca,3auror,A_F_R,0,Wed Jun 24 14:00:36 2015 UTC,"Rakitic because Pogba is nothing like Iniesta, and doesn't have any of Iniesta's skills. But Rakitic is better than Pogba, so I don't want the club to buy a 80m Rakitic."

Barca,3ax9st,YoSoyMilkChocolate,6,Wed Jun 24 06:15:57 2015 UTC,LA MASIA. We have Sandro and Munir.  Signing another striker won't hurt though. Not many both good enough and content to sit out out there though.
Barca,3ax9st,urbeer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:57:23 2015 UTC,"And Adama, I feel like he's underrated in comparison to Sandro and Munir, he has such talent imo."
Barca,3ax9st,FrostyGrass,0,Fri Jun 26 07:10:32 2015 UTC,"Thats what I used to think as well but watching some B team games he looked like a selfish headless chicken... Maybe it's the system, the entire B team looked a wreck this season"
Barca,3ax9st,urbeer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:57:25 2015 UTC,I thought he was one of the leading assist guys for the b team?
Barca,3ax9st,FrostyGrass,0,Fri Jun 26 20:50:22 2015 UTC,I'm not sold on Munir frankly. Always seems disinvolved and confused when it comes to build up play. Sandro however could prove to be useful.
Barca,3ax9st,urbeer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:34:14 2015 UTC,I like both. Sandro seems like a typical 9 but Munir is more of a winger/striker combination.  Both can prove useful.  I thought we could also use Deulofeu this season but those morons sold him so quickly.
Barca,3ax9st,broad_h2o,6,Fri Jun 26 16:58:39 2015 UTC,"Just curious, are you Mexican? Only way I can imagine a Culé wanting this."
Barca,3ax9st,Kluey,0,Wed Jun 24 22:19:25 2015 UTC,I am not.
Barca,3ax9st,astral_cowboy,9,Wed Jun 24 22:26:49 2015 UTC,"Pedro is a world class substitute. After him, Rafinha covers for the wingers occasionally, Munir and Sandro cover CF, Adama can also cover for wingers.   It might be worth having one but it's certainly not needed."
Barca,3ax9st,-Token,2,Wed Jun 24 11:37:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If a very specific player that fits the role and isn't that expensive happens to be in the market, it would be worth it to explore that options. Otherwise, I think we can handle it. Although it'd be nice to have a Larsson-kind of role."
Barca,3ax9st,logonaniket,-1,Thu Jun 25 00:54:55 2015 UTC,"That's exactly the reason I propose getting Chicharito, he wouldn't be expensive at all and is perfect depth for Suárez."
Barca,3ax9st,Aj16ay,2,Thu Jun 25 04:42:13 2015 UTC,Chicha wants to play though. From the few things I've read regarding him since the season has ended the general message he has sent is that he wants to be playing games. He certainly wont be getting that here considering he'd likely be considered after Pedro. So I doubt he'd want to come.
Barca,3ax9st,Aj16ay,5,Thu Jun 25 12:09:30 2015 UTC,Yes you are the only one :P
Barca,3ax9st,_sic,5,Wed Jun 24 14:30:01 2015 UTC,"Should have gone for Vietto. Chicha isn't very good, I'd rather give that time to Munir"
Barca,3ax9st,ir7425,0,Wed Jun 24 14:31:10 2015 UTC,"You don't think Chicharito is a good sub when Munir hasn't really shown signs of potential? I definitely prefer Sandro over Munir, he needs to be loaned out.  Edit: a word"
Barca,3ax9st,EpicChiguire,5,Wed Jun 24 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"Have you watched the B team this season or are you just basing that off the relatively short time they spent in the first team? Sandro is can be better as a physical 9 presence, but Munir definitely has the higher ceiling. He's been the best B team player this season, better technique, smarter plays, better runs, links play well. So yes, I'd definitely prefer to give him time than get Chicha, who is worse than Pedro and belongs at an upper-mid table club, not Barça"
Barca,3ax9st,EpicChiguire,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:27:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like we have too many small but creative players in the squad at the moment though. Sandro gives us a big physical presence that we don't have a whole lot of in attack, minus Suárez."
Barca,3ax9st,_sic,2,Wed Jun 24 18:12:32 2015 UTC,Munir hasn't really shown signs of potential   Did you miss the first 6 weeks of the season?
Barca,3ax9st,lonestar_10,6,Thu Jun 25 06:42:34 2015 UTC,"Even without counting on Pedro, Munir, Sandro, Adama( & Deulofeu)... We have others who can play as CF, RW or LW.  Aleix Vidal played his whole life as winger. Rafinha did play plenty of times as CF in B youth level. Iniesta can also play as LW. If Denis returns, he can play as winger too."
Barca,3ax9st,godie,0,Wed Jun 24 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"Under no circumstances should Iniesta ever return to the LW spot. That was a disaster and rendered us completely impotent in attack in 12-13. Of course, Fabregas' disappearing act didn't exactly help, but Iniesta on the wing is essentially going a man down in attack.  Now Denis Suárez is an interesting proposition. He played a lot on the left side in midfield and on the wings. I would be quite content to let him occupy the last spot in attack if Luis Enrique chooses to do so. I believe both Suárez and Rafinha will be valuable contributors under Enrique for quite a while to come (hopefully Enrique sees fit to remain at the Camp Nou for longer than Guardiola - maybe 7-8 seasons?). However I argue that Suárez (nor Rafinha) is incapable of playing the center forward role to take over for Suárez should it be necessary, while someone like Chicharito would. That's why I'm highly in favor of bringing in another center forward."
Barca,3ax9st,godie,4,Thu Jun 25 04:30:53 2015 UTC,"Chicharito is just a lucky empujabalones. He has no level for Barca or even Real Madrid. Besides, we already have Sandro, Adama <3 and Munir."
Barca,3ax9st,Friendofabook,-2,Wed Jun 24 23:08:22 2015 UTC,I'm not asking him to be a member of the Gala XI. I just wish to add him as a reserve option in the case that health of our attackers becomes an issue. In this capacity I don't see any reason why he wouldn't be a great addition to our club.
Barca,3ax9st,aleks19998,5,Thu Jun 25 04:43:48 2015 UTC,He's not worth it. He doesn't deserve it. I rate Sandro over him. I believe that Chicharito is way too overrated.
Barca,3ax9st,aleks19998,3,Thu Jun 25 05:29:20 2015 UTC,Pedro is a much better and more complete player than Chicharito.
Barca,3ax9st,drunkenmaster22,2,Thu Jun 25 06:41:39 2015 UTC,"Players like Sandro, Munir, Pedro, Adama, and Rafinha are all capable of playing up top. Maybe not starters, but they are quality players at the coaches disposal."
Barca,3ax9st,xFragg,-1,Wed Jun 24 13:27:43 2015 UTC,"Munir and Adama aren't ready IMO, and Rafinha isn't really a forward. We need someone who can play centrally (Pedro can't) and has experience (Sandro is good but not quite ready to handle full time substitute duty).  Edit: a word"
Barca,3ax9st,Chillidawg,3,Wed Jun 24 16:35:42 2015 UTC,If Suarez get's injured Messi moves to the middle and Pedro to the right. We don't need someone else who can play centrally. Even Neymar could play that role.
Barca,3ax9st,xFragg,0,Wed Jun 24 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned in another post, don't think it's worth moving Neymar or Messi to the center when you can just stick in Chicharito without a giant drop off and having to rearrange everyone."
Barca,3ax9st,xFragg,2,Thu Jun 25 04:48:09 2015 UTC,"Chicharrito sucks dude, he wouldnt be able to do what suarez does at all. If any Of the msn gets injured id rather sub un Pedro that chicharrito, its not even close."
Barca,3ax9st,CL95,3,Thu Jun 25 13:28:53 2015 UTC,You don't need 5 forwards... If it's a problem just switch to 4-4-2 those games. That was always the problem with Ancelotti. Regardless of injuries he always played 4-3-3.   Can't have two world class forwards on the bench.
Barca,3aru6o,yablodeeds,30,Tue Jun 23 00:19:21 2015 UTC,Nothing against Pogba but I really don't want him.
Barca,3aru6o,arayofhope,24,Tue Jun 23 00:27:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  If we buy him for the 80m or so that is rumored, then he's basically undroppable, and would have to start over Iniesta. Rafinha would get close to zero playing time.  I hope Juventus doesn't sell."
Barca,3aru6o,vizious29,9,Tue Jun 23 00:44:52 2015 UTC,Ill ditto that.
Barca,3aru6o,Marchisio,6,Tue Jun 23 01:37:51 2015 UTC,"Rafinha, Sergi Roberto, Samper, Denis Suarez, Halilovic, and more will lose loads of playing time and some of them have immense potential."
Barca,3aru6o,MayIHaveAHug,29,Tue Jun 23 02:58:28 2015 UTC,"What are we really missing out on here? Pogba is 22. He is the same age as Rafinha, younger than Roberto and one year older than Denis Suarez. Halilovic isn't ready for the first team and Samper plays in a different position. You guys make it sound like we are throwing away our future just because Pogba isn't from La Masia.  Pogba will bring more today and IMO has just as much if not more potential than any player in La Masia(other than maybe Samper)."
Barca,3aru6o,Marchisio,5,Tue Jun 23 03:11:23 2015 UTC,"Pogba will certainly bring more today but today's midfield just won us the treble. It doesn't need to be disrupted and it's worth seeing the potential of our youth products who were bred through our system. As you said, he's 22, if some of them aren't cutting it then we look elsewhere and sell and make some money from them to go towards Pogba. Will his price really increase much past the inflated/hyped 80M?"
Barca,3aru6o,MayIHaveAHug,4,Tue Jun 23 03:15:27 2015 UTC,Will his price really increase much past the inflated/hyped 80M?   Why not? If he does become the best midfielder in the world don't you think he would cost more? I also doubt we're the only team in for him and it'll probably be harder to get him out of Chelsea/PSG/Real Madrid than Juventus.
Barca,3aru6o,arayofhope,3,Tue Jun 23 03:21:53 2015 UTC,"Rafinha could also become one of the best midfielders in the world.  He has that potential.  Hell, he was named breakout player of the year before he came back to us"
Barca,3aru6o,MayIHaveAHug,2,Tue Jun 23 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"Well if you want to bring up achievements Pogba was the 2013 golden boy, won the best young player award at the WC, broke into the Seria A team of the year and won the golden ball at the 2013 U-20 WC. Rafinha hasn't made his first cap for the national team. Oh, and he won the La Liga breakout player of the year, that is an important distinction to make. You can argue Rafinha ""deserves"" more minutes(and i'm sure you will) but as of right now, Pogba has shown more potential.  Also, If Laporta was okay with Pep benching Ibrahimovic why would he object to Lucho benching Pogba?"
Barca,3aru6o,arayofhope,9,Tue Jun 23 03:45:42 2015 UTC,"Pogba is 100% the better player over Rafinha, I'm not saying he isn't.  But remember, he wants insane wages + an 80million fee from Juventus.  Is Rafinha 80million worse than Pogba?  Also, Ibrahimovic was benched for completely different reasons. He was being disruptive in the locker room.   Even then, Pep started Ibrahimovic during his long goal drought"
Barca,3aru6o,MayIHaveAHug,4,Tue Jun 23 03:54:48 2015 UTC,"Well that's a different story. I agree he will cost us a lot and if we can't afford him we shouldn't buy him but if we can afford him, feeling bad for Rafinha isn't a good enough reason to pass up on a potentially generational and  future player of the year caliber player."
Barca,3aru6o,henrax,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:04:19 2015 UTC,"The price is not rafinha + 80M€. We will still have him, and if he doesn't play we can still sell him and make some money out of him. So the difference would probably be around 50M€.  I don't they he is worth it, but there is a difference."
Barca,3aru6o,I_am_oneiros,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:35:57 2015 UTC,"You do realize that a year is a long time for aging players like Iniesta. No one knows how he will be after next season and the Euros. Just look at Spain's team itself - Euro 2012 winners, first team to be knocked out of WC 2014."
Barca,3aru6o,Marchisio,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:09:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do, which is why it's so important to give Rafinha the minutes he needs next season, so that when Iniesta plays more of a Xavi 14/15 role he will be ready and fulfilling his potential..."

Rafinha, Samper, et al may become world class players, but Pogba is one right now. As one of the biggest clubs in the world, Barca don't have to play the waiting game. Messi, Suarez, Pique are all in the primes, and it could be a century before we see another such collection of talent at the club. If Pogba becomes player of his generation at Real Madrid, what then? You passed him up to wait on some kids? How many trophies may that cost over the next decade?  You can't speculate at this level. Personally, I believe decisiveness will bring further glory to Barca."

Barca,3aru6o,wavechappelle,24,Tue Jun 23 11:23:57 2015 UTC,"Pogba will be one of, if not the best midfielder in the world, so I don't see how he wouldn't be an absolutely fantastic addition to the squad. Only problem is his reported wage demands which seem unrealistic- hopefully they can be negotiated down.    And no, signing him is not an affront to La Masia. Barca have always  and should always sign the best. It is only when you sign average players like Alex Song or Mathieu, and then give them playing time over likes of Thiago and Bartra, that La Masia is neglected."
Barca,3aru6o,maxucho,20,Tue Jun 23 13:53:04 2015 UTC,"Totally agreed, it baffles me that people are acting as though it would be some disgrace of Barca's principles to sign a player that's already one of the best midfielders in the world at age 22. For me there's no question that we should sign Pogba if possible.  And in response to the ""but he wouldn't fit the Barcelona system"" crowd, just look at Rakitić and Suarez. Both players that didn't look like they would fit into the conventional system, but adapted to it and brought a new dimension to it, and 14/15 Barca was all the better for their additions."
Barca,3aru6o,Marchisio,4,Tue Jun 23 01:07:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone thinks it's a disgrace, at least from what I've seen. I don't think we necessarily need him but you can't deny he'd be an incredible addition to the squad; a player with his quality will have no problem fitting in to the best team in the world."
Barca,3aru6o,broad_h2o,3,Tue Jun 23 01:44:55 2015 UTC,"For a guy that emphasizes La Masia and Catalunya, this would be a move that blocks players that fit into one or both of each category. I'm not saying I dislike the move, but trusting La Masia has worked in the past to make us the best in the world, and will continue to make us great."
Barca,3aru6o,drunken_madman,3,Tue Jun 23 03:01:25 2015 UTC,"Would you say that bringing Neymar or Suarez was a better choice than using Deloufeu, Munir or Tello? How is this any different? Yea those guys have potential, but have they shown it the same way that Neymar and Suarez already have? No. So we went for the proven stars. And we won the treble because of them. The truth of the matter is, if we don't buy him, someone else will and they will have one of the best midfielders for the next decade."
Barca,3aru6o,broad_h2o,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:04:35 2015 UTC,"I'm of the rather controversial opinion, and, I'm sure I will get downvoted for this, that we trust La Masia through great players, simply good players or mediocre players, and rarely sign players to supplement what we have. I understand that the position our club is now in in football and who it is run by will not allow this to happen, but that doesn't stop me from wishing."
Barca,3aru6o,_sic,2,Tue Jun 23 16:25:11 2015 UTC,"That's unrealistic. Barça needs to have world class players at all positions, and it's very difficult to produce Xavi, Iniesta and Messi every 5 years. More realistic is to produce the occasional star and squad players, and to fill the rest of the squad with quality signings."
Barca,3aru6o,YoSoyMilkChocolate,5,Tue Jun 23 18:02:55 2015 UTC,"Anyone else feeling shades of Fabregas with this signing? Where I have heard this before: a high profile, youthful midfielder at a European giant coming in as a luxury signing for our midfield when we don't need such an expensive transfer. If anything we should go after Verratti.  I don't think we need a signing (except Vidal of course) to be honest this summer. What we need to to tweak our current personnel for the season to come so that we can repeat our Liga and UCL conquests. This team has a rare chance to win 2 UCL's in a row; let's go with the personnel that got us there in the first place. I posted those changes in another post on this sub."
Barca,3aru6o,Marchisio,14,Tue Jun 23 19:36:17 2015 UTC,"Verratti will not come to Barca, I'm not sure why anyone thinks PSG is going to sell their best youth player. They have absolutely no reason to sell, they invested in him and Lucas for the future, they won't give that up. Surprisingly it's seeming that there's a better chance to sign Pogba..."
Barca,3aru6o,arayofhope,6,Tue Jun 23 02:52:00 2015 UTC,"Yup.  PSG isn't gonna sell Verratti, especially not to us."
Barca,3aru6o,Marchisio,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:02:54 2015 UTC,Yeah they refuse to make deals with us...infuriating but we have to accept it I guess.
Barca,3aru6o,Inspector-Norse,-2,Tue Jun 23 03:29:04 2015 UTC,"I reckon signing Pogba this or next summer, and then go for Verratti in 2017. If Verratti want to play for Barca in the future, he will not sign a contract extension with PSG. Then his price will come down and PSG will be forced to sell him to get enough cash (or not cause of the overload of cash i their bank).  I dream of MSN with Veratti, Pogba and Busquets behind."
Barca,3aru6o,Marchisio,8,Tue Jun 23 03:38:14 2015 UTC,That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard...  Do people really think FIFA Career Mode can apply to real life???
Barca,3aru6o,Inspector-Norse,-1,Tue Jun 23 12:18:54 2015 UTC,Except Neymar cost €83.5 million (Transfermarkt) in 2013 and Suarez €81 million (transfermarkt) in 2014.   So you are one of those who still believe Barcelona do not buy star players now and then? Barcelona is the second most valuable club in the world (I think Forbes ranked them first a little while ago) and of course they will spend huge amounts to be competitive.
Barca,3aru6o,Marchisio,3,Tue Jun 23 12:26:16 2015 UTC,"Of course not, we are the best club in the world and need to remain competitive. However, the circumstances were different. Villa had a broken tibia and was far from his best, Pedro's form declined and Tello wasn't cutting it, so we went for Neymar and Suarez.   Our midfield is stacked with stars and youth products with loads of potential. Signing one of either Pogba/Verratti will disrupt the squad and hamper development, what the fuck do you think will happen with 2 galactico signings fighting for the same position.   There's more to consider than stars; while we need one every few seasons to improve, having too many will not be healthy for the players and the team as a whole...As I said before, these situations don't affect FIFA but there's a lot more to it in real life than just buying the best players and having a stacked team..."
Barca,3aru6o,Inspector-Norse,-1,Tue Jun 23 13:21:54 2015 UTC,"No need to bring Mr. fuck into this discussion. This is a vision I have and I do not expect it at all. Yes, my vision is probably affected by FIFA or FM or whatever.   In 2017, Iniesta will not be at the same level and we do not know whether Rafinha, D. Suarez or Halilovic will be a success. That is why this situation is so debatable. Those three midfielders have all my expectation and hope, so if they can live up to the level required at Barca, of course Verratti and Pogba is not needed."
Barca,3aru6o,Marchisio,2,Tue Jun 23 13:32:27 2015 UTC,"Personally I think we should wait a season, see how Iniesta is handling the play time, how Rafinha and Denis Suarez are handling their bigger roles, and decide next Summer, at worst this Winter. I just think it's premature to buy right now..."
Barca,3aru6o,_sic,2,Tue Jun 23 13:41:59 2015 UTC,"No. This is nothing like the Fabregas situation. Fabregas was Catalan, ex- La Masía, poached by Arsenal, and had all sorts of ties to the club.   Pogba doesn't match any of those circumstances. He's more like Neymar."
Barca,3aru6o,_sic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:45:27 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, Barto has Pogba/Juve convinced to come to Barça, but he has yet to convince his agent Raiola (Ibra's agent). Apparently, Laporta has a good relationship with Raiola, since he did the Ibra deal with him, and also with Jorge Mendes, the Portuguese super agent, and he's currently working to bring more big splash signings to support his candidacy.  By the way, Abidal is just decoration, it's Laporta doing all the wheeling and dealing with the agents."

Unfortunately it will not be possible.  I know that my presence in the group is important, as well as of each of the other players, more than ever, they must completely turn their thoughts to the upcoming matches ahead.  I was given the duty of being one of the group leaders and as captain take responsibility for bringing glory and making decisions, whether wrong or right. And this was a moment of decision. Regardless of where I’ll be from now on, I’ll always follow Brazil, rooting for the success of my teammates, but staying here training is killing me inside… With no joy. It’s awful to train without preparing for something and this could lead to an accidental injury which would make it even more difficult.  I needed to express this feeling to the group and the coaching staff who have always supported me.   Staying here could bring a bad environment of “Concentration” issues that would take the focus away from the main purpose of Brazil.  I apologise to my colleagues, for putting myself in this situation but I’m sure this was an important learning curve in my career.  Good luck Brazil!!”"

He seemed to be doing such a good job this season of staying contained, and it all just fell apart in that match with Colombia -- it was like he had some sort of meltdown.  Since Brazil won't appeal the decision, perhaps the 4-match ban was lenient.  If, as some reported, he actually physically attacked the ref (however gently it came off) he is lucky the ban wasn't more severe."

Barca,3aptld,iagolima,9,Tue Jun 23 09:37:30 2015 UTC,"Good. Sure, it would've been great to see him scoring more goals and leading the team to the finals but hey, let's see the positive side of this:  a) No Neymar vs Messi, I really wasn't looking forward to a potential Argentina vs Brazil match-up.   b) Neymar is still young. He is still learning. He still has enough chances of winning big titles with the national team.  c) No more injuries (well, at least less likely)  d) He can join the Barça team earlier  e) He has more time to rest, which is great after the WC summer and a massive amount of games played during the season.   There's going to be lots of games next season:   All  +3 games (UEFA Super Cup, Super Copa Espana)   +2 games (Club World Cup)   Euro players  +4-6 games (Euro qualifiers)  Friendlies  Some friendlies here and there  Most of these are pretty intense games and last year we were lucky (not only) to not have any major injures. So Neymar being out is not really that bad considering our next season. We'll have Aleix Vidal ready in January, so Alves will get his rest later. Mascherano will be rotated anyway. Bravo and Ter Stegen will get rotated (most likely). Suarez had his rest at the beginning of this season and during this summer and no Euro qualifiers.   This leaves Piqué, Alba, Busquets, Iniesta, Rakitic, Messi.  I guess Busquets will get more rotation this year with Mascherano and Samper. Iniesta and Rakitic... Hopefully Rafinha, D.Suarez (?) and perhaps new midfielder in January. Alba should be fine. For me that leaves only Piqué (who is pretty injury-prone) and Messi (will probably get less rotation than people here would hope for but I really trust Messi that he knows what's the best for him and can play it safe in games that allow it)."
Barca,3aptld,zazzlekdazzle,5,Tue Jun 23 01:19:25 2015 UTC,"I think he should've stayed in Chile and watched the games from the stands, at least. He is the captain, even if he's not training his presence is important. I don't think posting instagram pictures from his TV at home saying ""Go Brazil!"" would be enough for someone in the role of Captain, doesn't show full commitment (Not saying he's not committed. It's about the message)"
Barca,3aptld,beastcat,10,Mon Jun 22 17:06:31 2015 UTC,I think what he means in his statement is that if he stays he will be a distraction because of all the media attention.  He wants the team to just be able to concentrate on training and playing and not have the media circus disrupt that.

I agree with the la Masia statement and I'd love to see unicef back on the front, but realistically we need a paying shirt sponsor  to fund la Masia expansion, any proposed stadium expansion and any required player purchases. Without it you'd just be financially raping the club. Downvotes incoming but it's just the hard truth, people need to stop being so romantic and be more realistic"
Barca,3ap9n5,navidjaan,8,Mon Jun 22 15:05:48 2015 UTC,You think one of the biggest clubs in the world can't find other means of revenue? I would rather take the hit of the sponsorship money loss and return to the things that made Barca unique. We don't need to be spending insane money on big signing every year either and along with rumours of selling the stadium name Bartomeu has to go.

Barca,3ap9n5,elanciano31,3,Mon Jun 22 13:31:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, Rosell was a piece of shit. But would you trade this past CL and all the new signings from last season just to have that period of 4-5 years of going against club values back? It's all connected. Rosell's profits and not buying players (although it cost us a couple trophies early on) led to the spending spree we were able to go on this summer. Otherwise we would have been in violation of FFP. Rosell was a piece of shit and made a lot of stupid decisions. A lot. But some of his work (intentional or not) set the club up for a promising future.   Laporta was a good president. Did a good job. Stuck to club values. But past performance doesn't mean that he will come back and repeat success.  It's time for somebody new. Somebody who doesn't have a past full of scandal who can take the club in a new direction while sticking to what's important to the club. I'm not arguing that Rosell was great--he wasn't. I'm not saying Laporta is horrible--he isn't. I just think it's time we washed our hands of having a president who is no stranger to scandal and stopped letting the club leadership put us in the headlines for the wrong reasons."
Barca,3ap9n5,EpicChiguire,3,Mon Jun 22 13:56:26 2015 UTC,"That would be nice. It's also impossible. The local socis are too entrenched in their ways, it's a populist vote and Benedito or Farre don't have enough sway. This election is Laporta or Bartomeu, a battle of the lesser of two evils."

Barca,3aml5k,Chillidawg,28,Sun Jun 21 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"His is a great story, when he says it was always his dream to play for Barcelona he's not bullshitting.  From my understanding, in a way, his whole career was built first to come to Europe for his wife (who moved to Barcelona with her parents when she was a teenager) and eventually to Barcelona specifically to be with the family.  Clearly the only way he was going to do that was to be the best.  It makes a difference to me, somehow, that he really wanted to be at Barcelona and it wasn't just about money.  And when I think about him lugging around that maté kit, all alone, all over Liverpool and then see him tucking in and hanging out with the Rioplatense crew at Barça, I get a good feeling that he found the right place for himself.  There was a nice article on an Argentine paper about how Messi has Luis and Mascherano over for asado (barbecue) on a regular basis.  One of my favorite things about Suárez is how hard he works and how much it shows.  Even when he wasn't scoring regularly in the earlier part of his season, he was doing so much for the team, and his obvious effort made it easy to be patient and wait for the goals to come.  I am very impressed with his fierceness and intensity, one of my favorite moments is not a goal, but of him fighting for the ball against Villareal.  People often fantasize about what it would be like for Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi to play on the same team, and I think we are getting a taste of what that would be like with Suárez."
Barca,3aml5k,zazzlekdazzle,3,Sun Jun 21 19:28:23 2015 UTC,"He had a tough life. Its great to see him succeed. I started following him during the 2010 World Cup, when he played he heart out for Uruguay. Along with Diego Forlan, he was one of the best players to watch. His attitude & work ethic is second to none. When he came over, he took some time to adjust. A lot of people were complaining about that. You have to look from Suárez perspective, coming from where he has been. Playing with naturally gifted & acclaimed  players like Messi & Neymar must have been tough. You could see him trying too much, probably questioning himself. I am huge admirer of his work ethic. Truly a team player."
Barca,3aml5k,pradeep23,7,Mon Jun 22 12:26:43 2015 UTC,"Side note on his tough upbringing: the wiki article mentions the poverty he grew up in as the reason he goes a little nuts sometimes. I don't think that's it, or at least not the main reason. Lots of players grow up in poverty.  Players like Diego Costa and Sergio Aguero also grew up poor, but in loving, supportive families. When I read Crossing the Line, I got the distinct impression that Suarez's relationship with his family of origin is...complicated. It doesn't sound like his parents were there for him very much, and if you follow him on social media, you'll notice he rarely mentions them (and pretty much never to English-language media). Every Mother's Day he does something elaborate for his wife, but you don't hear a peep about his own mother. I don't think that's an accident."
Barca,3aml5k,DaniMetroplex,8,Mon Jun 22 18:05:49 2015 UTC,"Haven't read ""Crossing the Line"" yet. I get the impression too that he may not be that close to his family. His wife's family was very supportive early on when they were in Uruguay. Remember he was quite poor and his GF at that time was well off. Still they kind of accepted him. I guess later on when they(his GF family) left for Europe, (Barcelona) he wanted to do his best to get to her. Suárez   comes off as someone who has struggled a lot and deserves every bit of success he has earned. His story is more humane and touching. Once you get to know him, you love him."
Barca,3aml5k,pradeep23,2,Mon Jun 22 19:00:41 2015 UTC,"Great links. I was going to write a completely separate comment, but think it's best to tag on here:  It seems like he has really worked his whole career to get to Barcelona, and he plays like the ideal Barca member. Like Messi, he has that wonderfully childlike approach to the game, which is just a joy to watch. He has played so unselfishly that it has even been frustrating at times, but there's no better option he could take. So many people were worried that he wouldn't be happy here due to not being the top dog, but he looks happier than ever.  I agree that it's not just his innate attacking ability but also his hard work on defense that has been a joy to watch.   In fact, despite Iniesta being my favorite player and Messi being the GOAT and a true joy to watch, I have most enjoyed watching Suarez this season. His kid-like approach and ""ugly magic"" just make me smile.  Obviously, one of the things that makes him great is his instinct for doing the unexpected to get a goal or get through the defense. It is wonderful when he is on your side! :D"
Barca,3aml5k,love_this_shit,42,Tue Jun 23 11:53:14 2015 UTC,"A lot of strikers aren't very useful if they aren't scoring goals. What I love about Suarez is that he'll always give you something. Even when he was struggling for goals, he was making assists and opening up space for other players.  Something I don't think gets mentioned very often about him: he seems to bring out the best in his teammates, in addition to his own brilliance. I think he's played a part in Messi returning to top form. Hell, he made Daniel Sturridge look like a world-class striker."
Barca,3aml5k,DaniMetroplex,10,Sun Jun 21 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"Not that he didn't make Sturridge better, but Sturridge has always been impressive when he's played. His issue is never being fit enough to play. His goals per minute are always really good, with or without Suarez."

His biting incident was obviously very stupid considering similar situations he has put himself in before, but it was in the moment of the match and it shows his insane passion for the game. I think it wasn't just a good decision on our part to sign him, but this signing was a blessing for Suarez. After that incident and the 4 month ban, he came back more committed than ever to redeem himself and boy did he do just that. A historical treble and Suarez definitely played a pivotal role in Barca's comeback streak starting from January. What impressed me most about Suarez was his ability to provide that perfect assist that most strikers couldn't even envision. He is the quintessence of a team player and his selflessness allowed him and the team to flourish. Excellent signing, excellent player, excellent season."

First at Ajax (as I'm an Ajax-supporter as well) and then at Liverpool, becuase I usually follow ex-Ajax and ex-Barcelona players with special interest.  His last season sealed the deal for me. I always knew he was a great player, but that season at Liverpool he proved he was one of the best in the world and I knew he'd be able to make the next step to Barcelona. I'll admit, I had some doubts about whether or not he'd fit in our playing style, but he's turned out to be an amazing signing."

Nothing anyone ever says or does will change that. But there have been times when we relied on him too much and sometimes he couldn't do it.  Then Neymar came along and lightened the load a little. His first season wasn't the best but it was good enough to give us a glimpse of what's to come. We were still struggling because he was finding his place and didn't quite fit in fully just yet.   Then came Suarez. Everything we were missing he had. Every run that needed to be made, it was perfect. It took him a while to find the goals but he found them. He found the assists. If you were god and you were tasked with creating a 9 for Barcelona you literally wouldn't be able to create a better one than Suarez."

Yeah he was having difficult time at first when he started playing at Barça after his four months banishment from all sort of football activities but after a while he found his rhythm and my God Suarez proved his worth; a player who wears shirt #9 works this hard to fight for the ball every now and then on pitch, who contributes greatly to make our offensive movement and game building, should play for a champion team and here is Suarez playing for the Champion of Europe FC Barcelona. I hope he will continue to play at a high level for the coming seasons at Barça. Wishing him all the best."
Barca,3aml5k,Football_Enthusiast,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:43:55 2015 UTC,Suarez is a tremendous player for a reason and a very influential player on pitch who can cause enough damage to the opponent team (many might disagree but if it wasn't for Suarez's clinical finishing skill then I believe LFC wouldn't dream of winning '13-'14 season EPL). I won't say other #9s are better than Suarez but I like Lewandowski quite a bit. But no doubt Barça made the right choice by signing him. And my all time favorite #9 is Gabriel Batistuta.
Barca,3alx5m,MrIsten,76,Sun Jun 21 14:47:18 2015 UTC,"Everybody was key - literally every single player in the starting XI was vital - but the person who was most important for the least praise was Piqué IMO. Yes, everyone recognizes that he's back to his best, and that he's the best CB in the world, but I think people don't appreciate just how much that means. Every single corner, every single cross, every single long-ball, he was there. Watch the last 10 minutes of the CL final with Juve pushing forward desperately, he was a monster.  Piqué was like Messi in the back line this season, in that his unbelievable consistency and quality was essential for how the team worked. The foundation of the team, a real leader at last and just a rock in every big game."
Barca,3alx5m,egcg119,20,Sun Jun 21 15:01:59 2015 UTC,He scored a good amount too!   Striker Piqué is best Piqué.
Barca,3alx5m,ss4444gogeta,19,Sun Jun 21 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"I love marauding forward striker Piqué, so entertaining"
Barca,3alx5m,aPerfectBacon,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:33:42 2015 UTC,So badly wanted him to score in the dying stages of the cl final
Barca,3alx5m,NahSoR,10,Mon Jun 22 13:16:10 2015 UTC,I remember in '14-'15 UCL final Pique got a sweet chance to score inside the Juve box; I'd really love it if he could score that. But yeah Pique has been a really consistent performer in '14-'15 season and hopefully he will do well in the coming seasons too.
Barca,3alx5m,Football_Enthusiast,6,Sun Jun 21 16:44:51 2015 UTC,He was attempting bicycle kicks XD. Love the guy.
Barca,3alx5m,prateekdwivedi1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:46:53 2015 UTC,Single handedly changed the teams mentality seems a bit much. I think Luis Enrique had a more significant role in that. The rest I agree with.
Barca,3alx5m,egcg119,3,Sun Jun 21 18:01:40 2015 UTC,Not just our starting XI either... some players came off of the bench and played key minutes.
Barca,3alx5m,OrangePaper7,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:06:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Let's not forget how well his passing is. In terms of passing ability, he is the best center-back in the world imo. It helps sooo much to have a player like Pique in the backline, because he can start attacks and passes the ball around with the same confidence that any midfielder has... But of course the highlight is his defensive brilliance."
Barca,3alx5m,Mentosfruitcore,47,Sun Jun 21 17:30:14 2015 UTC,Alves resurgence played a HUGE part in barca's success this season.
Barca,3alx5m,Softandfloppy,16,Mon Jun 22 12:50:22 2015 UTC,Alves + Messi = Joy (for us)
Barca,3alx5m,iagolima,2,Sun Jun 21 16:24:38 2015 UTC,Oh I love the joy I get from watching them play ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Barca,3alx5m,JKapIsClueless,2,Sun Jun 21 17:12:57 2015 UTC,Hopefully Vidal can make a great partnership with Messi in the future.
Barca,3alx5m,FrostyGrass,15,Sun Jun 21 19:15:40 2015 UTC,Personally for me Bravo. He had a small chance to us that he can be a world class keeper and he did. We were going to play Marc in La Liga games but he showed us what he's truly capable of. This is one of the best saves I have seen (http://gfycat.com/GeneralWindingHylaeosaurus) from him
Barca,3alx5m,NovacElement,14,Sun Jun 21 19:43:06 2015 UTC,There was a lot of criticism on Mathieu. He proved all pessimists wrong and got some important points in the second half of the season with his 2 headers
Barca,3alx5m,Flam1,3,Sun Jun 21 15:44:21 2015 UTC,"Besides those two occasions (Two very important though), he has honestly been extremely average. I was extremely positive to his signing at first, but the more he played.. eh... he just isn't Barca level, which he showed with his performances imo."
Barca,3alx5m,flackohowyoubeen,7,Sun Jun 21 16:58:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're using average appropriately. Average Liga players are 6'2, faster than Jordi Alba, and able to play both CB and LB? I get that Mathieu hasn't been spectacular, but even if you look just at his physical qualities, he's extremely valuable. Speed and height may not be as elegant qualities at Barca as passing, but they've helped us many times when he played.  Saying he's not Barca level is silly, because he's playing at Barca level and doing adequately. Not amazingly, and there are mistakes, but he's not a liability, he holds his own."
Barca,3alx5m,egcg119,4,Sun Jun 21 17:13:18 2015 UTC,Well I don't have much confidence in his passing but further he played well this season as cb imo.
Barca,3alx5m,Flam1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:41:23 2015 UTC,Pretty much agree with this. Overall he hasn't been amazing but he got us a couple of crucial goals. He paid back his transfer fee with those goals but I think we're gonna need to look for a CB again fairly soon.
Barca,3alx5m,darthvader7888,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:20:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Even when the downvoting party begins when I say it, I believe that Mathieu's not at Barça's level. For me, Bartra >> Mathieu."
Barca,3alx5m,EpicChiguire,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:52:56 2015 UTC,He was pretty up and down. But he did score two crucial goals.
Barca,3alx5m,darthvader7888,23,Tue Jun 23 12:48:48 2015 UTC,Alba for me
Barca,3alx5m,grubykoxu12,6,Sun Jun 21 21:49:48 2015 UTC,"Whenever Adriano played instead of him, it was absolutely clear how important Alba has been."
Barca,3alx5m,canadian028,23,Sun Jun 21 14:55:27 2015 UTC,"To me, it was easily Rakitic. There was an article written about him on ESPN a couple days ago, definitely worth the read."
Barca,3alx5m,NookiePookie,2,Sun Jun 21 15:41:31 2015 UTC,Yes without him buildup play with Alves and Messi would have been impossible. He did everything for barca.
Barca,3alx5m,FrostyGrass,33,Sun Jun 21 17:00:57 2015 UTC,"Here it is - Messi. The much we praise him, I feel it's not enough."
Barca,3alx5m,ir7425,6,Sun Jun 21 19:45:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed, more specifically Messi 2.0.  This season he made more headers and right footed-goals than most people in all of Europe and doubled the number of balls he won back compared to previous seasons.  He has managed to be at the top for attacking statistics in Europe for both forwards and midfielders, a jack of many trades and a master of all.    In a team that once relied on Xavi and Iniesta to be the creative geniuses, Messi has stepped into that role this season and done marvelously, while somehow still managing to score a remarkable number of goals himself.  Although I never would have described him as a selfish player, he has also showed even more this season how much consideration he gives the development of other players and the betterment of the team in general."
Barca,3alx5m,zazzlekdazzle,3,Sun Jun 21 15:27:26 2015 UTC,"This, we have an amazing team. Definitely CL worthy but messi is just so good he can take a team and transcend previous offensive abilities no matter who is on the team."
Barca,3alx5m,helloo25,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:43:26 2015 UTC,"Haha, I'd agree, but everyone knows how important he is. I wouldn't say he's the unsung hero...but just the sung hero."

Barca,3alx5m,IhateAngryBirds,11,Sun Jun 21 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"Well most of the comments here are right but I'm going to go with someone a bit different.   Zubi.  His purchases were mostly spot on, bringing Suárez, Rakitić, Mathieu, Bravo, and Ter Stegen were all key to the treble,  despite all the shit we gave him."
Barca,3alx5m,HippoNigga,4,Sun Jun 21 16:40:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like Pedro definitely deserves a shout. He was patient on the bench and always there when we needed him. Never really complained about not getting much game time and when he was played, he worked his ass off. He just signed a new contract too! It's great having a team player like him."
Barca,3alx5m,yrtsimehChemistry,6,Sun Jun 21 18:18:21 2015 UTC,Has got to be Bravo for me. Top 10 keeper in the world easily
Barca,3alx5m,DivineVibrations,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:30:58 2015 UTC,"He's been a beast. And I love seeing how much he cares about his clean sheets. Even when we're up 3-0, he'll be bossing his defenders and giving it his all to keep the goal clean, no loss of concentration."
Barca,3alx5m,beskidtbawler,3,Sun Jun 21 16:49:11 2015 UTC,"It's unfair to single out anyone. The entire team was superb. Pique, Messi, Neymar, Masch, Busi, Rakitic, ter Stegen, Bravo, Suarez, Iniesta, Alba, Alves -- all were key."
Barca,3alx5m,urbeer,2,Mon Jun 22 05:54:24 2015 UTC,"for me its Pique, i ll be honest and admit that in previous years i didnt really feel safe when the opposite teams were around our box or when Pique was in possesion of the ball because he used to do many stupid mistakes but boy this year he stepped it up .  i dont have that fear anymore and like it wasnt enough of him being solid in defense he also scored some great headers this season.  we should credit Unzue aswell for the massive improvement of defensive tactics."
Barca,3alx5m,XsTream23,2,Sun Jun 21 16:06:35 2015 UTC,"bravo and ter stegen for me,when we signed bravo i wasn't so sure that he will be able to replace valdes and produce quality performance like him but bravo did great job throughout the season  on the other side i knew ter stegen was a great potential and he showed it in champions league and copa,he will definitely be one of the best goalkeepers in years ahead"
Barca,3alx5m,_madmartigan,2,Sun Jun 21 16:38:27 2015 UTC,"Claudio bravo and his first season with us, no transition just straight to good form and really kept us alive in la liga. Finding a replacement for victor was a difficult one but who would have thought he would merit a Zamora in his first season. I'd also like to include ter stegen, he really proved himself in the first season in champions league, the stiffest competition there could be. He's been patient so far and it showing that guys talent and personal are what this team needs."
Barca,3alx5m,beastcat,2,Sun Jun 21 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"Rakitic is the key. He occupies the whole space Dani Alves leaves behind him, and that's a lot of space. Plus, goals and assists. He is gold."
Barca,3alx5m,chikedor,2,Mon Jun 22 01:12:47 2015 UTC,Coaching staff. They are the real heroes.
Barca,3alx5m,Icarium_lifestealer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"There's a shout for everybody.. Pique and Alves have had the biggest improvement from last year IMO. Then there are the consistent players that haven't gotten as much praise as MSN, such as Busquets and Alba. Masch has been a leader. Both our goalkeepers have been outstanding, Mathieu has definitely proven his worth, there was a lot of skepticism when his price tag was publicized but he's been worth everything. Rakitic has been godsent. I'm very much happy with our team and I love em all for bringing me happiness in rather depressing times.."
Barca,3alx5m,mrnoor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:11:57 2015 UTC,Easily Mascherano! The closest we've come to replacing Puyol.
Barca,3alx5m,ViscaBarca1899,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:03:05 2015 UTC,Piqué.   And ALL the coaching staff.
Barca,3alx5m,Duke--Nukem,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:10:08 2015 UTC,"IMO Pique was deserving of so much more praise this season.  He was coming off quite possibly the worst season of his professional career, where his reputation of being one of the world's greatest defenders went own the tubes.  This season, to not much fanfare, he showed why he was and is considered world class at his position.  Positionally and aerially dominant on the backend, absolute rock that Barca needed"

Barca,3ak896,lonestar_10,14,Sun Jun 21 00:36:56 2015 UTC,"He's one of my favourite, he's just so fast and reliable. I really wish he didn't throw up his tantrums."
Barca,3ak896,call-me-shirley,14,Sun Jun 21 04:58:17 2015 UTC,"for me he is the best left back in the world, yes , he could improve his crossing and his finishing , but his speed ,technique, passing and stamina make up for it,his defensive work is always solid and on the attack he s one of the best.  , he is very important in our build up play, being constantly there to overlap for neymar, offering options for him  ,you can see in the many statistics how many accurate passes this ferrari guy has.  one thing he could also work on is his temper, i feel like he gets angry way too easily and starts doing stupid things as yelling at the reffs ,often getting booked for it"
Barca,3ak896,XsTream23,16,Sun Jun 21 02:56:01 2015 UTC,Alaba is slightly better IMO. As fullbacks they are more or less on the same level but Alaba brings a couple extra elements to the team (e.g. set pieces) and seems to be a bigger threat in front of goal.
Barca,3ak896,MayIHaveAHug,8,Sun Jun 21 03:13:06 2015 UTC,"for this season at least (considering alaba has been injured ) jordi has been the best , alaba is great player aswell but it just my personal preference, i believe he s the best option and the best player in his position we could have bought ,i cant see anybody doing the same thing he bring to the table,not even alaba ,our style fits perfectly for Jordi"
Barca,3ak896,XsTream23,3,Sun Jun 21 03:17:31 2015 UTC,Alba is pretty limited in attack but defensively he has improved this season
Barca,3ak896,Aj16ay,3,Sun Jun 21 03:46:31 2015 UTC,Alba  limited  attack   What...I don't even...
Barca,3ak896,YoSoyMilkChocolate,7,Sun Jun 21 16:36:05 2015 UTC,"Alba is the best attacking left-back in the world. His finishing is lacking, and his crossing isn't the best, but he's constantly involved in the build-up for attacking play on the left side. He covers so much ground and his defending is pretty incredible, too. Alaba is much more rounded off than Alba is, but strictly talking as a left back I think Alba has the edge on Alaba."
Barca,3ak896,FreakishHero,3,Sun Jun 21 07:52:55 2015 UTC,"Marcelo is better attacking imo, but Alba is way better defensively."
Barca,3ak896,flackohowyoubeen,3,Sun Jun 21 10:31:08 2015 UTC,"I think Marcelo is a much better shooter but that's it. However, I may just be ignorant."
Barca,3ak896,FreakishHero,2,Sun Jun 21 13:32:10 2015 UTC,"Way more creative, much better on the ball, and has a better end product. Alba is faster and has the capacity of making many more runs, but that's really it."

Barca,3akujy,viscaelbarca1899,21,Sun Jun 21 04:44:00 2015 UTC,Not much has changed in 3 years.
Barca,3akujy,Tezemery,12,Sun Jun 21 08:24:21 2015 UTC,"This might indicate that we are already looking at a future replacement for Mathieu, perhaps even Bartra.  I don't want us to keep pursuing Marquinhos as it's impossible to buy PSG's key players. It'd be such a waste of a summer.  Laporte, however, is attainable. The price is very steep though, not sure we would spend a major chunk of our budget on a CB in the future."
Barca,3akujy,Mentosfruitcore,16,Sun Jun 21 04:47:01 2015 UTC,"Pique has 5-6 years left of his prime, Mascherano 2-3 years and we also have Batra who is really good and should be given a lot of playtime. Outside of that we have Vermaelen who granted has been injured way too much but is still a solid player I hope, and Mathieu gives us a great option in the air to sub out Masche for.  We don't really need another central defender at the time being. I'd rather we focus on buying a central midfielder of some sort(Veratti, Pogba or someone else who can contribute) to replace Iniesta in the long term. We have great depth in defense imo. The only thing needed would be an Alba back-up if Adriano leaves the club. Grimaldo?"
Barca,3akujy,vanNostrandby,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:54:06 2015 UTC,It's still better to buy before Barça is in desperate need.
Barca,3akujy,Mentosfruitcore,13,Sun Jun 21 11:15:46 2015 UTC,"That could be said for any position, it's a useless statement. The fact remains that we have very good coverage in defense, with five players competing for two positions."
Barca,3akujy,Marchisio,7,Sun Jun 21 11:30:00 2015 UTC,"To play Devils advocate, defense is the one position where our youth teams are failing to supply the first consistently. Only Bartra and Grimaldo have the quality to be in the first team right now, it's not a bad idea to pick up a youngster who can be a starter when Mathieu, Mascherano and Vermaelen decline or leave."
Barca,3akujy,navidjaan,2,Sun Jun 21 11:55:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, we have two great center backs coming out of Juvenil A this summer. Rodrigo Tarin and Xavi Quintilla. Can see them both on the first team inside 3 years maybe if they continue to develop."
Barca,3akujy,vanNostrandby,2,Mon Jun 22 09:37:27 2015 UTC,"What I mean is, the defenders are already old and if Barça waits (again) to the moment until they can't wait anymore, the price for any defender will be much higher than it would be now."
Barca,3akujy,Mentosfruitcore,3,Sun Jun 21 13:53:11 2015 UTC,"Sure, but we have coverage at defense that will last many years. Maybe in two seasons or so we could discuss bringing in some kind of back-up, but we don't need any central defenders right now. Pique is only 28 and one of the best in the world in his position, Mascherano is a bit older(31) but still holds his own and will probably remain a worldclass defender for atleast two more seasons.  Behind them we have Vermaelen who is 29, Mathieu who is 31, and of course Batra who is like 24-25.  Even in two seasons, we will still have a brilliant Pique, Mascherano will still probably remain a topclass defender, and if not, Batra is right there to replace him. Buying Laporte or someone of similiar calibre only to keep them benched until we need them in 2-3 years time is stupid."
Barca,3akujy,IhateAngryBirds,5,Sun Jun 21 14:59:51 2015 UTC,"Again, there's no buying of any players as long as no president is elected."
Barca,3akujy,EpicChiguire,5,Sun Jun 21 09:04:21 2015 UTC,"BUT WHY??? Seriously, we just signed Mathieu and Vermaelen (Mathieu's old, I know) and we have BARTRA. Bartra is good, we just don't play him a lot. I say we stick to Bartra."
Barca,3akujy,lonestar_10,4,Sun Jun 21 16:24:05 2015 UTC,"A lot of top clubs want Laporte, but with his new buyout fee + tax, he would be quite expensive (close to 60M euros).  Anyway, amid rumors over the election period, I hope the Bartra situation will be resolved. He needs a bigger role on the team."
Barca,3akujy,baktiar77,7,Sun Jun 21 05:43:29 2015 UTC,"My only question is why didn't Barca bid for Marquinhos and Thiago Silva 2~3 summer windows when PSG bought them from Roma and Milan respectively. At that time, PSG came 2nd to Lille and had that 75% tax thingy."

Barca,3akujy,polechi33,2,Sun Jun 21 16:25:10 2015 UTC,"Mathieu and Vermalen should leave the team, this gives room for another centre back. Bartra should be third choice, the new signing should be aware of this. Of course Bartra still has to keep proving he is better than the rest.  How is Bagnack doing at Barça B? I thought he was a promising CB for the future."
Barca,3akujy,zizzor23,2,Sun Jun 21 17:19:11 2015 UTC,"I would only accept this if Bartra starts getting more minutes and Mathieu becomes Alba's sub (so this means selling Adriano). I would go for Laporte, who is left-footed and have Vermaelen as his sub. Once again, Bartra needs to start playing more or we will lose him."
Barca,3akujy,pradeep23,2,Sun Jun 21 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"Verm is going to be useful in rotation. Mathieu has already proven his worth this year and isn't going anywhere nor are they going to do Barca any ""favors"" and leave in order to make room for another CB."
Barca,3ajjih,Chunky_mono,29,Sat Jun 20 20:34:23 2015 UTC,I really hope Simeone manages Argentina in 2018. It might be Argentina's last chance to win a world cup for a while.
Barca,3ajjih,MayIHaveAHug,6,Sat Jun 20 20:55:41 2015 UTC,I hope the same but don't see it happening. He would need to take the position by next year so he's involved in the qualifiers and gets sufficient time to develop the team. Assuming he says he's leaving Atletico next summer he'll have several big money offers from other big clubs and for a coach so early in his career it would be hard to turn those down.
Barca,3ajjih,cdn_brcafan,3,Sat Jun 20 22:02:43 2015 UTC,What is so awful about Argentina lately is that they have a collection of good players but these players don't play as a good team. I think the problem lies within the coach's view and philosophy; either the right players are not used (Sabella's WC '14 selections aren't my most favorite) or really poor strategy and tactics (Tata Martino is showing really good examples of it in CA '15).  Anyways I don't see Simone taking charge of Argentina in near future. And sooner Tata is leaving Argentina NT the better it is for Argentina. I hope someone good will take the responsibility of managing Argentina NT soon. However I feel like they should have kept Pekerman after WC '06.
Barca,3ajjih,Football_Enthusiast,2,Sun Jun 21 00:01:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would have liked to see Pekerman stay on for 2010 instead of getting Maradonna. What a terrible decision and a complete waste of a worldcup. Argentina was a ton of fun to watch in 2006. I think Tata's time will be tied to how far they get in the Copa but even if they win it I hope the AFA considers how poorly the team is playing when deciding to keep Tata or not.  Offcourse, they could start playing upto their potential in the knock outs which I hope for every time I sit to watch them play."
Barca,3ajjih,cdn_brcafan,2,Mon Jun 22 02:11:50 2015 UTC,"I swear in WC '06 Argentina played something similar to our Pep era Barça, they were really fun to watch under Peckerman's leadership; I still remember Riquelme from that team. Selecting Diego Maradona was just too risky decision for AFA and they paid a rather high price for that in WC '10. I don't hate him but I never thought of him as a cool, calm and tactically intelligent coach and there are many Argentinian legends who could've been appointed as a coach. What are guys like Kempes, Burruchaga, Passarella, Caniggia, Ayala doing these days? AFA can seek help from them. I just hope AFA will consider how poorly the team is performing on pitch under Tata Martino's management no matter what is the outcome of Copa America for Argentina.  Argentina will face-off Colombia in QF and Colombia will not be an easy opponent to defeat but I think Argentina will do better in the knock out stages."

You’re demanding 20 goals and four overhead kicks.’” Still not convinced? How about this: asked why he didn’t go to England despite the huge pay rise, Nolito said: “Because it’s cold, it rains a lot, and the food’s bad ... Besides, what do I need more money for? All greed does is rip the bag.” Still not convinced? Ok, how about this: asked about a penalty his team were denied, he replied: “Talking about referees is like asking the lemon tree for cup cakes.” Oh, and he can play a bit too.

After several denials by Echevarría and Laporta, contested by documents shown by a former member of the board of directors, Laporta was finally forced to accept Echevarría's resignation. Echevarría continued, however, to be close to the club and he organized the security during the celebrations of the 2005-2006 Liga  What a totally straight laced, non lying, non politician."

If there really was a financial disaster then Rosell would never have had the transfer budget for cesc or Alexis.   I vote for the lesser of two evils and in this case that is Laporta.

Barca,3agkf5,Kluey,9,Sat Jun 20 01:43:03 2015 UTC,Enrique might not be as tactically gifted as Pep but he's much better at player management. The entire squad gets along wonderfully.
Barca,3agkf5,mockio77,5,Sat Jun 20 07:17:45 2015 UTC,Hasn't Pedro extended his contract?
Barca,3agkf5,YO_putThatBagBackON,8,Sat Jun 20 04:00:13 2015 UTC,He has but I read somewhere that he could still leave. Hopefully not now that Luis Enrique has spoken with him.
Barca,3agkf5,A_Kind_Shark,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:04:24 2015 UTC,But isn't his buyout clause like 150m?
Barca,3agkf5,Jelboo,2,Sat Jun 20 08:43:37 2015 UTC,"A club can still accept bids under that clause. Especially if Pedro says he wants to go. I don't think he will, though."
Barca,3agkf5,StopMakingScents,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:44:13 2015 UTC,Yeah but that could've just been a real 'bro move' from Pedro so we can get a higher price from him.  I do hope both players stay though. Especially Bartra. We'll need him in the coming seasons with an aging back line.
Barca,3agkf5,lonestar_10,4,Sun Jun 21 23:15:59 2015 UTC,"At the same time, Enrique needs to give Bartra more chances, and since Montoya/Douglas are more likely to leave than stay, Bartra can play CB and rotate at RB with Alves (Since we know Vidal won't be able to play until January, and will need time to adapt to RB)."
Barca,3agkf5,XsTream23,2,Sat Jun 20 13:35:36 2015 UTC,apparently he told them that they will play more next season  (which is the logical move i guess)

Barca,3af824,Illegal_sal,44,Fri Jun 19 17:18:57 2015 UTC,"I've discussed this with my gf before. Its a shame but I believe that Neymar's reputation precedes him a bit. Other players and many fans believe that Neymar, much like Penaldo, goes down easily and really tries to sell it for a penalty. While I agree that you can see that a bit in early Neymar and also some flashes of it from time to time, I believe that Messi has left a real impression on him and now you tend to see him try to fight through the fouls since, with their skill level, even fouling them can't stop them all the time.   Sadly though, refs seem to have not caught on to this and he tends to not get calls when he really should. Hopefully that won't stop him and he'll keep it up because one of the things I love most about Messi is his downright refusal to go down (and the fact that he always does his ""MY ball, you still can't have it"" and grabs the ball after goin down)."
Barca,3af824,LedZepGuy,2,Fri Jun 19 20:11:06 2015 UTC,"I think the refs in Copa America are letting a lot slide.. not just for Neymar.. But Ney was fouled a lot, and he shouldn't have gotten that first yellow.. However, if he wants to win it all, like he says he wants to, he will need to suck it up, keep his eyes on the ball and friggin win it.  He will be provoked all the time. And he better get used to it.  Hopefully, he can look over the border and learn from what Messi's doing.  Or across the street in Barcelona :)"
Barca,3af824,juguar,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:38:46 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't like when players grab the ball when they go down, whether it's a foul or not, if you're a player like Leo who doesn't go down easily, he needs to have faith in the ref rather than breaking the rules by grabbing the ball. My opinion."
Barca,3af824,robc95,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:54:07 2015 UTC,I agree with your position but I don't think I've ever seen Messi do that. I've only seen him grab it after the whistle has blown. I wouldn't like it if he did it in the fashion that you're describing.

Imagine not voting for him, and rather vote for Bartomeu's;  ''Rosell, La Masia lol haha whats that, Brazil, Lawsuits and Qatar.''  One looks at Barcelona for what it is, respect it cultures and values. While the other just looks at it like a business. There is no definition of a real culé, but I'm sure as hell most that consider themselves that, won't even think about giving Bartomeu a positive thought. I hope all the socis thinks about this too, instead of ''oh, treble, this man must be good.'' While La Masia is falling apart, and the Barca as we know it is being ripped apart piece by piece. As it has since Rosell & Bartomeu took over."

There's a lot to like about Laporta, but there's a lot wrong as well. And he needs to be able to plan for the future, not just rely on what he did before to carry him to success. And if all you expect of him is some buzzwords, you're not holding him to much f a standard for the clubs future.  Also, there are a huge amount of socis who will vote for Bartomeu, whether you like it or not it doesn't make them less cule. Personally, I think he needs to go but that he actually done more goo than people give him credit for, not entirely bad."
Barca,3aejgr,Dookie232,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:09:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Laporta is a very charismatic guy, an honest cule, perhaps our most important president to date, but some fans are really blinded by the love for him. Remember that the survived a vote of no confidence because of a technicality, he lost a lot of support of his colleagues and members and still clung to power, remember his francoist brother in law, remember his shady Uzbekistan deals, remember the shady Traffic transfers, remember Txiki when it comes to Pep and remember Rosell, when it comes to Ronnie.   Bartomeu was a close ally of Rosell, but than again so was Laporta a while back.  Bartomeu and Rosell are no better of course, but I think they lack the most in social skills and showmanship, that's why the fans like Laporta more.   I prefer Laporta between the two, but some perspective is necessary. You can make a case for Laporta and you can make a case for Bartomeu and that is a fact."

Barca,3aeq1c,JurijFedorov,5,Fri Jun 19 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"I am from Denmark too. And my opinion is that this is a bad if not terrible idea. Michael Laudrup has had a mediocre coaching career.   Brøndby - demanded a 1 year contract. Got a 2 year contract because they wanted a stable coach. Left right away. Getafe - left after 1 year to go to Russia. Money? Spartak Moscow - fired for being a bad coach. Mallorca - acted like a jerk. Forced the club to fire him by doing stupid things because they couldn't afford better players. He forced them to fire him instead of quitting because he wanted the rest of the money from his contract. Swansea - fired. But undeserved actually. I don't know why they fired him. But probably problems behind the scenes as rumors go. Lekhwiya - the team name says it all.  So, he not only got in trouble with the Danish national coach and wasn't allowed to play at the team in 1992 when they won Europa Cup. But he got in trouble with Cruyff too and went to of all teams Real Madrid and then to a Japanese team. Is he trouble? I actually think so. I much rather hire his brother who is a great and stable guy and not a primadonna. This guy wants things his way or no way at all. He is treated like a God in Denmark and it went to his head. The same as Bendner and Zlatan. Bendner was called one of the best attackers in Europe when he was younger - by the Danish media. The Danes wanted him to play for Barca or Real. Even 2 years ago they hoped Barca would buy him."
Barca,3aeq1c,Mornic,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:17:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is a fair representation. He achieved a lot in Brøndby, Getafe and Swansea with very mediocre teams. The reason he has left has usually been that he wants to play offensive football but is often not given the players to successfully do that. He does his best the first season but gets little support for signing what he wants long term.  He went to Madrid because Cruyff was a dick, which is why he isn't hated in Barca like Figo. He won La liga 4 times with Barca and Madrid won it as soon as he moved there. It is just a testimony to his skill and importance. Cruyff was a fool to bench him.  Barca would be a much better fit for his preferred style of play. Whether he can handle a team of that caliber is the big question."
Barca,3aeq1c,JurijFedorov,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:43:16 2015 UTC,Nearly all coaches in Denmark could have won the league with the Brøndby team he had. It was an amazing team and the best or second best team that has ever played in the Danish league. His name was so big that he got big players to the club and to stay. But look that team up and see it for yourself.  He did amazing with Getafe in Europa League but they did terribly in La Liga.  I already said he did great with Swansea. But he did have some good players and a big budget. And their new coach is just as good.  The biggest problem is his personality. I know nearly everyone loves him in Denmark but let's be realistic. He is a man who wants things to go after his own head. Imagine him walking into Neymar and Neymar saying something to him. That would be a huge conflict and sold players and what not.
Barca,3aeq1c,Mornic,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:50:07 2015 UTC,"I think you are being very biased.  Laudrup came to Brøndby in 2003 and made huge changes to the squad to fit his playstyle. It worked very well and after a few years the team was performing great. It was Laudrup who built the team you claim anyone could have won the league with, so that only speaks in favour of his strategic decisions. I also think you are putting way too little credit in his hands as a coach during the season, since the team worked for him because he built it for his playstyle.  When Laudrup was replaced the team did not perform that great and the new coach made poor decisions for bringing in new players. Not giving Laudrup credit for Brøndby's success make it seem like you just don't like him."

Barca,3ag51d,javiergonz,8,Fri Jun 19 21:36:26 2015 UTC,spending 80M plus 12M in wages for Iniestas sub is not a good idea.
Barca,3ag51d,BarcaJeremy4Gov,15,Fri Jun 19 22:29:31 2015 UTC,"You're right OP and that's part of what makes the whole Pogba question so controversial. If he comes, the most likely position he can take is Iniesta's. However, we still have a couple of good years from Iniesta left, according to normal scenarios for players in his position.  Here are some of the possible scenarios and the implications that each of them could have according to how I understand things.  We can:  Buy him this summer, start playing him on winter  Pros:   We'll get him -- some people say he's called to be one of the best, if not the best, midfielder of his generation. Even he's not but turns out to be as good as he is and still improve, we could have our midfield covered for the next 10 years. He'll have time to adapt to the team. This seemed to work for Luis Suárez pretty well.   Cons:   We'll spend a lot of money in a position that we could cover for much less or basically free with La Masía talent. We would essentially block the development of players such as Rafinha, Suárez, Halilovic, and even Samper (this sounds similar to the last point, but the last is related to money and this one to talent development). There would be a lot of pressure for playing him, due to his cost, and an extreme pressure for him to deliver immediately. Which would essentially bring in the debate: should we try to give Iniesta an early retirement or should we respect our (most likely, for the next season) captain? Badly handled (managerial-wise), this could turn out like another Zlatan case (especially with Raiola as his agent).   Anyway, this seems to be the least likely option.  Buy him this summer, leave him at Juventus next season  This seems to be the option that could work out the best, out of the scenarios where he joins us, both in sporting and economical terms. The downside is that Juve aren't open to this.  Pros:   His price, although extremely high, won't get any cheaper next season (unless something exceptional happens) or for the next 3-4 seasons. (We would essentially be buying him at the lowest price point he'll have in 3-4 years) As mentioned above, we're buying on of the most exciting prospects out there, who's on his way to becoming a generational midfielder. Not to mention that we'll prevent other clubs from getting him. It would allow us to enjoy an undisputed Iniesta for at least another season, before bringing him some serious competition (which he hasn't had in a long time). Once Pogba comes, we could start to gradually ease him out (it hurts a little to even write this, luckily I'm just a fan and won't have to take the decision to start subbing him), hopefully at a slower rate than we did with Xavi-Rakitic. It would allow us to try other prospects, such as Suárez (if he comes back) or Samper (if he joins the first team) or Rafinha in that position. This would only be useful to increase their value and most likely sell them for more once Pogba comes, or to just give them first-team experience before playing them in other positions (most likely still as subs).   Cons:   Economically, it's still a lot of money. That's 80M+ for a third season in a row. It's money that could be better spent on 2-4 top quality players or keep investing in La Masía and other sporting projects, or just save it for another player (people will point out Verrati). We'll essentially close the doors to other prospects (mentioned above). Talk about cantera and La Masía. Note: People think that we should have the best players, no matter where they come from. If they happen to be from La Masía, so be it. If they happen to be from outside, so be it too. It'll be a heated debate between cruyffists and galácticos.   Buy him next season  If we manage to either lock his price but have the opportunity to pass on him, I'm open to this option.  Pros:   Pretty much the same as above, the only other thing I can think of is that we'll give any Masía player a real fair chance of becoming the next midfielder. Can't say the same thing if they play in that position knowing that Pogba will come the next year.   Cons:   Same as above plus more competition, which will likely increase his price.   Pass on him (not buy him)  I'm open to this decision, if this means that we'll have a midfielder that works better for our system, at a fraction of the cost. What does 'working better for our system mean'? I really don't know.  Pros:   We'll obviously save a lot of money that we can spend on other players or destine for other purposes (save it for other transfers, keep reducing debt, invest more in La Masía and other sporting sections). We might end up having a Masía graduate take Iniesta's spot and it would be a great message for other canteranos.   Cons:   Obviously, we'll give other teams the opportunity to have him. It wouldn't matter though if and only if we end up getting another midfielder for that position that's just as good, if not better, for us and our system (whether he'd be a Masía graduate or not). If Real Madrid gets him, it would create a shitstorm in the press and with the fans. We'll end up discussing every week about how great he is and why we should've gotten him when we had the chance. (This is of course a bit silly and partly joking, but I seriously wouldn't like to have this kind of conversations)   tl;dr: It's complicated."
Barca,3ag51d,astral_cowboy,7,Fri Jun 19 23:06:01 2015 UTC,"I think we should pass on Pogba for two reasons: La Masia and Verratti. Verratti would fit Cruyff's mold of the Barça tradition and way of play and La Masia deserves to shine once more. If Verratti in a year or two gets frustrated of going without European glory, he could likely open himself to a transfer."

I think our midfield is the area of our squad that still needs fine-tuning, and so bringing in new players could be a very good thing. That being said, i sincerely hope that we pass on Pogba, for reasons of Iniesta's quality and the chance to try out various midfield configurations with our La Masia players. Our midfield is pretty full as it is, with Busi and Rakitic as starters.  Pretty much though, i just want to disregard the rumor storm around Pogba because it feels like a convenient, high leverage election tool for the incumbent board."
Barca,3ag51d,BurtBrains,3,Sat Jun 20 00:13:40 2015 UTC,"Juve fan here. Pogba's an excellent player, there's no doubt about it. He's very good offensively & defensively, which is how we like our midfielders - box to box. That being said, sticking him in a CDM role limits his ability to produce offensively, just like putting him in a trequartista/CAM role would limit his ability to produce defensively. If you're going to buy him for 80 million+, you're going to want the most out of him.  That being said, he's not an Iniesta replacement, he's not a Xavi replacement, he's not a Busquets replacement. He's an extremely good box to box midfielder, who would need to be in a free roaming role to be at his best."
Barca,3ag51d,ManoloBar,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:28:05 2015 UTC,"I think the best position we can offer him is Rakitic's, but there's little free-roaming there: it is actually quite tactically demanding (cover for Alves, wide for when Messi goes inside, run inside when Messi goes wide...) and while he has the attributes to do it, I wonder how willing he would be to actually do it.  I've seen some Juve games, but not all of them. Would you consider him as a player that would be willing to 100% sacrifice his own 'star' for the better of the team?  I do not think that he should be bought for Iniesta's position. Just not the right type of player."
Barca,3ag51d,macab1988,3,Sat Jun 20 22:34:40 2015 UTC,"So who do you start when Iniesta needs rest? I want to throw up about the price, but we need a world class player who can replace Xavi and if we can get Pogba we should get him."

Barca,3ag51d,ir7425,4,Sat Jun 20 00:01:45 2015 UTC,"Rafinha is fine but Samper and Denis are too young still.   In 2005-06, a certain 21 year age Iniesta was back-up midfielder for us. While Xavi was injured for 5 months, Iniesta provided excellent boost up to the team. Iniesta was the one who changed the UCL final after coming off from bench. You can say Iniesta already had a season with first team. So as Rafinha & Denis had excellent season with Sevilla. If we didn't trust Iniesta in that time, would he be the same play we see today? I think not."

He's my favourite player and at this point he's got to go down as one of the greatest players to ever don the Blaugrana. Truly a legend."
Barca,3aegqz,-Token,3,Fri Jun 19 16:36:47 2015 UTC,Massive player. Hopefully he can become even more involved and exert a greater influence on proceedings next season. We want to be going through him and Busi in the middle
Barca,3aegqz,albus_sherlock,4,Fri Jun 19 15:37:50 2015 UTC,"Being a player who has always had physical issues affect his game it was not surprising he would have a tough season given that he had not had a break since the 2011 Summer start to the season.     This was Iniesta's worst season of his career and I have every one of them.    And It was about how he was playing not where he was, Iniesta is good enough to play anywhere, a change in role is of little significance to a player like him. It was about Iniesta's mis placing passes, unable to hold onto the ball under the simplest of presses, unable to dictate the tempo and even at time struggle with positioning and space dynamics.    Iniesta has never had it this bad and it lasted practically the whole season.   He was though undoubtedly the best player on the pitch in the UCL final. Plus his solo run for that Neymar goal against PSG was a highlight as well.   He'll be back to the old consistent self next season after getting the full summer rest in 4 years."
Barca,3aegqz,iVarun,3,Fri Jun 19 16:47:48 2015 UTC,Iniesta de mi vida! Legend.
Barca,3aegqz,sois,5,Fri Jun 19 15:14:48 2015 UTC,"Took him a while to warm up and adjust to the different role in the squad, but the cream rose to the top at the perfect time, playing a big part in the crucial games later on in the season, looking to be back to his former best. Looking forward to seeing Denis and Rafinha being integrated to the starting 11 more often, and who better to be guided by than Don himself. Can't wait to see the role he plays in helping them mature, whilst also being integral to our squad. Exciting times ahead."

Barca,3aegqz,Mugiwara_Luffy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:33:38 2015 UTC,"He was probably at the lowest point of his career by the first el Clasico, the third goal that we gave was really atrocious. Even at the start of 2015 we were winning matches but were getting bossed in the midfield in some of the matches, which changed once Iniesta was back to his best at the end of the season.Really excited for a well rested Iniesta next season."

Adriano's level this season dropped quite a bit compared to the seasons before and he's getting older. It's understandable that he wants to play more in his last couple of years as a professional player. It seems like the right time to leave.   Phenomenal squad player he was through out the years."
Barca,3aeabn,HoboChique,3,Fri Jun 19 12:34:50 2015 UTC,Amen to all of that.   Do you know who will take Grimaldo's spot in Barça B if he's promoted?

Such drastic commentary requires serious body of solid and unshakable proof and there is none.    We can't even pin point the exact reason for what happened to Barca B, the team this season was as if not more strong than last season and the results were diametrically different. Plus we won't know till a few years how this season helped shape the young players because that is what matters.   Too early for doomsday articles I feel."
Barca,3aefcx,iVarun,8,Fri Jun 19 16:55:58 2015 UTC,"Of course it's way too extreme in the sense that it talks about a literal 'down fall' and 'rock bottom', but it presents good views on how the top youth team and the second team were run; poorly.   I think it does a fairly good job of saying what went wrong, without the benefits of looking at the club from the inside out."
Barca,3aefcx,iVarun,3,Fri Jun 19 17:53:10 2015 UTC,"I feel our own sub and you yourself have offered better narrative as to the issues of what was happening with the B team and this was like 2 years back at the least. And the team was having fine results at the time.    Sandro, Munir and Samper were in the first team earlier in the season.    I don't like articles which pick up on things only in hindsight.   We dissected the coach and the leadership for their failings and their success while it was unfolding.    Last season I put the largest stress on Castilla's young age for their relegation plus the promotions they had and a lack of quality from the younger divisions.    Barca B defies logical and simple explanation for what happened this season. Age wise they have always been youngest, quality wise this was their best in some seasons if not at par at least. Even often blamed coach got fired.    They should have stayed up, on paper, but that's Football. We might get a better picture after a while."

Barca,3acl92,Illegal_sal,11,Fri Jun 19 00:34:04 2015 UTC,The most outrageous part about his passing is that he seems to barely hint that he's about to pass. Just a simple taptap like he's dribbling. Deceptively clever and so much finesse and power where necessary that sometimes the defender's like wait where the fuck is the ball.   Happy messi gets more credit for this more than ever since our 9 and 11 are there to finish them off now.

Piqué and Alves both said this season that this team has the best atmosphere they've ever been a part of, so it bears discussing. My few observations:    Piqué is the joker of the team. He and Messi are also good friends from their days together at Juvenil. The Brazilians are all best friends.  Messi, Suárez, Mascherano enjoy maté (traditional Argentine/Uruguayan beverage) together before each training. MSN are great friends, obviously. Mascherano seems like the guy who is really serious 80% of the time, but when he does do something funny absolutely cracks you up. Did you see the video of him on top of a golf cart?  Messi and Dani are best friends. Messi also used to be quite close to Pinto - seems he likes hanging out with more extroverted teammates.  Rakitić and Ter Stegen bonded early on cause they both speak German.  Xavi spoke really highly of Jordi Alba in an interview, which surprised me, and I noticed them parading around together in one of the trophy celebrations."
Barca,3acvry,egcg119,13,Fri Jun 19 02:29:42 2015 UTC,"Dani is fundamental. That Sid Lowe piece says it all why he is irreplaceable.   ter Stegen once said in a interview, he is close to Rafinha & Rakitic."

Just a bit cliquey? Personally that's the impression I get from the occasional social media post etc.   Imagine being Mathieu/ter Stegen/Sergi Roberto/Montoya in that situation? Not fully first team regulars and almost not included fully with them either.  Just an observation, would love to hear others' thoughts."

Barca,3ab7hb,MayIHaveAHug,12,Thu Jun 18 19:21:03 2015 UTC,"Not that I disagree that Busi is magnificent, but Yaya was here first :P (Bought for the 2007 season).  I don't think most people had even knowledge of Busquet's existence if you weren't following the B team, at 3era during the 07-08 (that is the 4th division, after La Liga, 2da, 2daB).   Guardiola recognized his talent from his B days, and he played quite often starting on the 08-09 season, competing with Yaya for two years until Yaya left at the end of the 09-10 season. During the second of those two years, Yaya had lost a lot of ground to Busquets, and wished to play more often thus precipitating his move to Man City."
Barca,3ab7hb,ManoloBar,8,Thu Jun 18 20:13:36 2015 UTC,"My point was that the board at the time didn't decide to pass on Yaya Toure so they could leave an opening for a La Masia youngster. How many times have you heard ""Lets not buy Pogba so we can give  the midfield spot to Rafinha/Samper/Halilovic/ D. Suarez""  on this subreddit? If they can't prove they are better than Pogba, they don't deserve the spot"
Barca,3ab7hb,MayIHaveAHug,6,Thu Jun 18 20:37:50 2015 UTC,"The ""let's not buy stars so we can use our talent"" is not exactly new, always happens when the team is doing especially well.  For me it's about trade-off's. Buying Pogba would definitely improve our squad, but the cost seems too high. And not even from the 'playing time for youngsters' perspective. Breaking the salary balance in the dressing room is a dangerous road to take.  There is always a balance to be considered: if we are buying players, it should be according to the needs of the squad (the extended squad, so the stand-out players from Barca B as well), not solely on $T4R P0W3R. A central midfielder is probably our biggest need right now, but I don't think the need is great enough to justify the investment that Pogba is - currently-. My opinion is subject to change :P, particularly during next summer transfer window.  PS: Highlight also the important work in the youth academy to remind the youngsters that as one of the best clubs in the world, they will have to compete with the best. Busquets, as you pointed out, was ready to do so, and earned his spot.     Edit: To play devil's advocate to your example, though, what would have happened if 18year old Busquets decides that Barcelona does not value his talent because they bought Yaya, and leaves?   And also, we haven't had an adequate replacement for Busi since. Should that be another consideration? If, heaven's forbid, Busi suffers an important injury, we could be in for a long season."
Barca,3ab7hb,ManoloBar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:53:37 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all I agree that Pogba's demands of being the second highest paid player are unreasonable but honestly that sounds more like a Railoa tactic and he probably wouldn't be paid that much if the transfer did happen.  But since we are on the topic, who do you think is the second highest paid player on the roster? Xavi? Iniesta? Pique? Busquets? Nope, Luis Suarez. Yeah, in his first season his pay was higher than that of all our club legends/La Masia graduates. Now imagine going back in time and saying ""Who the fuck does Suarez think he is? asking to earn more than Iniesta? PASS!""  Perhaps an better example of a player closer to Pogba would be our third most earning player, Neymar. 21 years old, never played a game in europe and he signed a contract that would see him making 20 grand more than Iniesta per week(IIRC). I'm hoping everyone here is okay with that right now.    To play devil's advocate to your example, though, what would have happened if 18year old Busquets decides that Barcelona does not value his talent because they bought Yaya, and leaves?   Well what would you say if Sandro decides that he is leaving because we bought Suarez(who was integral to us winning the treble)?   And also, we haven't had an adequate replacement for Busi since. Should that be another consideration? If, heaven's forbid, Busi suffers an important injury, we could be in for a long season.   This seems like a separate issue but Mascherano is a more than adequate replacement. We beat RM without Busquets this year."
Barca,3ab7hb,MayIHaveAHug,3,Fri Jun 19 00:19:23 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all I agree that Pogba's demands of being the second highest paid player are unreasonable but honestly that sounds more like a Railoa tactic and he probably wouldn't be paid that much if the transfer did happen.   Perhaps, but Raiola is such a tool (we had problems with him when Ibra was here), that he might even be 100% serious.

Yeah, in his first season his pay was higher than that of all our club legends/La Masia graduates. Now imagine going back in time and saying ""Who the fuck does Suarez think he is? asking to earn more than Iniesta? PASS!""   Well, Luis Suarez was probably the best 9 in the world, established in europe, veteran (27-28), star, and Goals are the most expensive commodity in football, so not particularly surprised there.   Perhaps an better example of a player closer to Pogba would be our third most earning player, Neymar. 21 years old, never played a game in europe and he signed a contract that would see him making 20 grand more than Iniesta per week(IIRC). I'm hoping everyone here is okay with that right now.   That was probably too much for him at that point in time: he has since proven himself within our system and I don't think anybody disputes his salary now (so we were lucky there). There is the important consideration that he came for a starting position: where would Pogba fall in now? Sub? For Rakitic? Either way, a lot of money for someone that wouldn't be an automatic starter (considering that fitting into the Barca way is very important -not always easy- as well as adjusting to the Spanish League), probably fighting for a position with Rakitic (Iniesta's role is too different to Pogba, IMO).   Well what would you say if Sandro decides that he is leaving because we bought Suarez(who was integral to us winning the treble)?   Well, hindsight is 20/20, but the point is that there are a lot of sides to buying a player, and its usually both good and bad, and its always risky.   This seems like a separate issue but Mascherano is a more than adequate replacement. We beat RM without Busquets this year.   While Masche can play there, the dip in our game is significant. Over long periods of time I think we would struggle (but then again, that says more about Busi than Mascherano).  With that I was trying to point out that Busi/Toure is (IMO) better than Busi/Masche, but Toure wasn't happy with the lack of playing time and left. Busquets turned out to be fantastic, relatively injury-free, and has grown even better over the years. Toure ended up being one of the best players for Man City for several years. Unfortunately this is not FIFA15 and we can't horde them all.    Sorry, I got derailed there, struggling a bit to put my thoughts into words. Going to bold the -IMO- key points.  The point I was trying to make is that not wanting to buy Pogba to let the B players develop is less risky:   0 euros Used to Barcelona playing style and Barcelona (the city) Spanish League knowledge, Spanish-speaking    VS    Huge amount of transfer money + salary New city, new style New League, new Language   Additionally, Pogba's competition would be for a starting spot, which would end up going to either him or Rakitic (more physical box-to-box style rather than Iniesta). Could cause Rakitic/Pogba to leave short-term, depending on their mindset.  La Masia folks would probably be OK with a substitute role for now, while Pogba would certainly not be (which I think is the best argument for not buying anyone at all for CM until next summer)  At this point in time, I don't see the point in making a gamble of that magnitude ($$$) on a player (sidenote, I consider every purchase is a gamble).   For Verratti I can see a bit more of a case, since he would theoretically come to replace 31yo Iniesta (who is sometimes prone to injuries), but several of the same considerations also apply to him.    Edit: Damn that was long. Nice discussion though."
Barca,3ab7hb,ManoloBar,4,Fri Jun 19 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"It's a nice sentiment but doesn't quite fit. First off, all those players are already on the verge of the first team, Busquets was nowhere near it and came out of nowhere. Second, Toure was bought for 10m euros.   It'd be one thing if we were talking about buying Rakitic or Kroos, 20-30m euros, but Pogba's price-tag is anywhere between 60-100m. That's insanity. That's two summers' worth of budget, after a year in which we already spent big. For a starting position that is not even available yet with Iniesta there.   When you spend that kind of money, it changes everything. It raises expectations, complicates things in how you treat the player. You need to make a return on the investment. Just look at how ugly things have gotten with Bale this season at Madrid, or even Cesc for us the last few years. Coaches felt an obligation to play him and it didn't work out."
Barca,3ab7hb,egcg119,3,Fri Jun 19 02:33:02 2015 UTC,"It's still different because Yaya was already here.   If we buy Pogba, he is obviously not going to get played out like Yaya did. If we buy him, then he's going to play as much as possible to fit in. What Pep did, was trying out another option that could work out better. And it did. Busquets proved to be the better option.   We're not going to buy Pogba, rotate him with Rafinha, and think ''Oh, Rafinha is clearly a better fit, and should be prefered over Pogba.''  These are totally different cases."

While the company tries to find a ground job for pregnant crew, this is not always possible. Where it is not possible, the cabin crew member can take an unpaid leave of absence for up to one year.  It would be preferable if the employee was simply placed on paid maternity and accrue seniority in the meantime with the expectation that they would/could simply return to their job.  Regardless, I think the ILO is being a bit too selective and a bit culturally insensitive (though, again it is not a cultural norm that I would enjoy or try to propogate) in their denouncement, and the article going out of its way to mention the club (and not mention any of the Airlines other major sponsorship partners) reeks of sensationalist horseshit."

The B team was where good prospects would go and hit that penultimate stage in development...until the results became the only thing that mattered and they started leaning more and more on veterans who had originally only been brought in to buttress the Masia kids. For all his many many many faults though some of the transfers under Rosell were good.  Masche and david villa come to mind, alba as well.  The biggest transfer busts were cesc and the loss of thiago.  Aside from Neymar though none of the signings under Rosell were Galactico-like in my opinion.  Sandro was a pretty shrewd businessman...a complete prick and too clever for his own good, but a pretty shrewd businessman.  I've gone far afield though, for me you cannot always bet on La Masia.

Neymar still needs a veteran to guide him with is behaviors on the pitch (just see Xavi vs Bilbao). as a Brazil fan its ridiculous that I have no faith in Brazil beating Venezuela then a depleted Paraguay (if we qualify) without Neymar, its just crazy."
Barca,3aaun0,domi_28,3,Thu Jun 18 17:19:29 2015 UTC,"Indeed, Neymar had three scraps this season, two against Atlético at Calderón (one with Torres during the Copa and one with Godín) and the one with Athletic at the Copa final, where more senior players intervened and diffused the situation.  I guess there just wasn't time or the right circumstances here.  I imagine that everyone kind of thought they were ""off the clock"" since the whistle was blown, though as professionals they should be aware that anything happening on the pitch will be held against them.  All that said, the match was not refereed well at all and situations like this can result.  I wouldn't wish reffing a Brazil-Colombia match on my worst enemy, but all the same these guys are professionals and someone should be able to pick the right man for the job."
Barca,3aaun0,zazzlekdazzle,4,Thu Jun 18 19:59:08 2015 UTC,"/rant  Neymar did nothing wrong against Bilbao. So many examples to choose from and you pick the worst one. Just because Xavi didn't approve it and Enrique said he understands the rage of Bilbao players it doesn't mean they were right or that they have the last word on the matter or represent the majority of public opinion. It was a damn fine dribble and that is the end of it, i don't give a shit if Xavi didn't like it. Xavi also said Qatar will be a great host for the World Cup..  /rant off"
Barca,3aaun0,droid750,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:10:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think you really understood what I said, regardless of what happened, Xavi took Neymar under his wing and pushed everyone away to prevent the problem from escalating that's all I meant.

All i said is that just because Xavi said something it doesn't mean we have to agree with him or that he must be right because he's Xavi. Who the hell said anything about him being less of a captain and a legend ? Him and Enrique escalated the whole situation by making pro-Bilbao comments, not the other way around."

Dunga is on his own until at least semifinals.   Update: Neymar's ban reduced to one game, but may still get a second one. Final decision to be made tomorrow"

Suarez did bite 3 opponent players and he was penalized for that (I remember he has also done something racist with Evra in '11 probably but he apologized for that later) and I think after that Chiellini incident he repented and understood that he needs to be very disciplined on pitch. And we have seen Suarez in the last season, he ain't a hot tempered player and hopefully he won't do any such unethical act while playing at Barça. As far as I know his private life seems quite peaceful too.   I don't know, if Icardi could steal his teammate's wife then who knows how healthy is his private life. Additionally someone already stated that he has got ego problem which will be bad for our team's harmony."

So, so, so, many dumb decisions. All over the place, all the time. It's honestly too much to say. It's impossible to summarize it all. One of the problems? To keep letting Gumbau and Dongou play. I have no words for how bad those players are. And the coaches keep letting them play over Samper, Halilovic or Adama!   I remember late in the season, Adama had a fantastic game, he carried the team to a win. The next game? He got benched so Dongou could play RW. And how bad is Dongou? Imagine Alex Song as a winger, just faster, dumber, and a guarranteed open goal miss each game. And I seriously mean each game.  I also like how Vinyals moved Patric, the RB, into midfield so he could bench Samper. Gumbau - Patric still gives me nightmares. And Patric was fucking horrible in MF.   Oh, and my favourite. Late, late into the season, Vinyals had another masterplan. Gumbau, the awful midfielder, why not put him at CB? I mean, why not right? He played some matches at CB while great CBs were left out and benched.   Vinyals & Eusebio should never have been in charge of Barcelona B. Never."
Barca,3a93ob,flackohowyoubeen,7,Thu Jun 18 11:01:51 2015 UTC,"Patric played midfield in La Masia for four years before joining Barça B. The decision to move him back wasn't that stupid at all and it opened up a spot for Palencia, who was a pleasant surprise at Barça B. He was also one that knew the Barça system perfectly, and the lack of pure Barça midfielders was really showing through out the season.   To play him in favour of Samper is a bit silly, but it was an understandable experiment; only he dragged it out too long."

Since Bartra we haven't seen someone that could really help the first team in the short term and even with Bartra that's questionable.   The closest to that is Samper and we still don't know where he'd fit in. Especially with Busquets playing consistently at a really high level and Mascherano capable of slotting in the DM position as well, the obvious position for him would be the CM position; but he hasn't played there since Juvenil B.   Grimaldo is the next one, but with Alba performing at this level as well, both Mathieu and Vermaelen capable of playing left back and Adriano's future still uncertain, it seems hard to break through for him as well.  The fact that we now pretty much need loans to get players up to first level standards is very telling. Thiago and Bartra are the only ones after Busquets and Pedro to really make it through without a loan and they both suffered from a lack of playing time; causing one of them too leave and one of them to also drop an extremely low buy-out clause.  I really hope that after July the next president gets La Masia back to the level it was until after Luis Enrique and Oscar Garcia left."

Barca,3a93ob,SubjectAndObject,5,Thu Jun 18 14:20:45 2015 UTC,"Tough call. The veterans over the past seasons were often the weak links of the team and would prevent talents from getting valuable playing time. It's better than what we got this season though: all purchases were also very young and only Halilovic has the talent to make it at Barca.   Experienced players definitely would be useful, but they shouldn't block the progress of the La Masía talents.   Currently we can't buy for Barca B anyway though..  This past season though, we probably should've bought experienced midfielders instead of Gumbau and Cámara. We also could've used an experienced centre back."
Barca,3a93ob,RickAScorpii,3,Thu Jun 18 14:53:00 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Thanks for the thoughtful answer.
Barca,3a93ob,joesugarman,5,Thu Jun 18 16:33:25 2015 UTC,League Table.  Last time Barca B went through relegation was 1999.
Barca,3a93ob,RickAScorpii,5,Thu Jun 18 05:09:43 2015 UTC,"That's the last time they got relegated to the 2nd Division B, but then they were also relegated to the Third Division for a couple years. That's where they were when Guardiola started, and I think he got them promoted back to Segunda B in his last season before taking over the first team."
Barca,3a93ob,Icarium_lifestealer,2,Thu Jun 18 10:55:34 2015 UTC,"People quickly forget that it is ok for the B team to be in segunda B. The younger players can grow more comfortably.  Liga adelante is tough and puts a lot of pressure on the coaches to do anything for a win, even sacrificing logic and our barca style."
Barca,3a93ob,MayIHaveAHug,2,Thu Jun 18 13:49:19 2015 UTC,"Yes! One of the big reasons why Busquets and Pedro succeeded in the first team is because they had very little pressure on them after playing in Tercera. Now we're expecting youngsters like Sergi Roberto or Munir to be great from the start, and we're bound to be disappointed with most of them."
Barca,3a93ob,Icarium_lifestealer,12,Thu Jun 18 14:10:29 2015 UTC,Completely deserved relegation. We were horrible throughout. Defending was comical. I hope the new board concentrates little more on masia and B team rather than chasing divas.
Barca,3a93ob,MayIHaveAHug,18,Thu Jun 18 06:03:03 2015 UTC,"I agree our B team needs work but chasing those divas just won the first team a treble, and that's what it's all about right?"
Barca,3a93ob,flackohowyoubeen,7,Thu Jun 18 06:13:23 2015 UTC,We can chase good players but not players like pogba who demands 12M salary. Tell me one one good reason why he should earn more than Iniesta. He is just not worth it.
Barca,3a93ob,OriginalUsername30,10,Thu Jun 18 06:17:12 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think it's a joke for him to earn more than a top club legend x international football star, Iniesta.   But let's not make this thread a Pogba thread. It's about Barça B and what went wrong with it. And what is the future of the B team and its players."
Barca,3a93ob,Tezemery,3,Thu Jun 18 06:32:08 2015 UTC,Suarez and Neymar both make more than Iniesta.
Barca,3a93ob,MayIHaveAHug,-10,Thu Jun 18 17:15:16 2015 UTC,"Barcelona is more than just the first team. It isn't all about trebles when your youth teams are troubled. I'd easily give away any of the three trophies for Barcelona B to stay up.   We can't just stay happy, and pretend everything is great, when it's not. Another reason Bartomeu shouldn't be elected."

The gap between Madrid/Barça and the rest of the league in terms of revenue will not close much but in terms of sheer numbers most teams will improve.   Does this figure include Real Madrid?   Madrid will make the same as Barça. With both making €125 million, the top two take up €250 million of the €1,25 billion. That leaves €1 billion for the other 18, which divides into an average of €55,56 million per club. I hope that answers your question."

You do have a very valid point in regards to the Asian market. They tested it out the last couple seasons with some early matches. I also agree we need to see overall competition increase across Liga and have mid level teams further compete domestically and in European competition (though Liga already owns Europe).   I don't think scheduling matches earlier is the only solution to getting more money. I think one of the biggest issues with selling Liga broadcast rights is the lack of commitment to releasing a proper calendar. Could you imagine the EPL deciding 10 days before the biggest derby in the country on which day and time it will be played? This makes no sense as in my opinion eliminates the chance for larger ad revenue.  TLDR, you're right in a sense, we need to start looking at ways to increase overall revenue to strengthen the mid and lower level teams and secure the future of the league."

He is very talented, but he is obviously temperamental and that is something he still needs to work on.  While the first yellow I thought was ridiculous, he could've easily been expelled after it for several actions that a harsher ref would've punished."
Barca,3a8kjg,Football_Enthusiast,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:20:02 2015 UTC,"I know Neymar didn't act mature on pitch and this is unexpected from him as a captain, but for some reason I start to believe that Brazil vs Colombia games will be really intense from now on. Both of the teams seem to have grudge on each other."
Barca,3a8kjg,latino666,8,Thu Jun 18 15:07:13 2015 UTC,"brazilian press here claims Neymar will lose two games , holy shit"

Barca,3a8kjg,lonestar_10,2,Thu Jun 18 02:27:21 2015 UTC,"Even if Brazil qualify for the quarterfinals, and Neymar does not get suspended for extra games, they will certainly have difficulty getting through. Haven't looked impressive at all."
Barca,3a8kjg,CorsarioNero,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:31:26 2015 UTC,Sport confirms it's a two game ban.
Barca,3a8kjg,ManoloBar,2,Thu Jun 18 16:14:55 2015 UTC,"I believe that a straight red card is minimun 2 matches in CA, but not entirely sure.  I know he would have normally served a 1 match ban for his two yellows, so they might even be compounding the sanctions together (aka, 1 ban for the 2 yellows in the first two copa games, +1 for straight red). Who knows..."
Barca,3a8kjg,latino666,2,Thu Jun 18 05:47:03 2015 UTC,well brazilian media (globo esporte) says he'll miss at least two matches and that he'll be judged. He could miss the rest of the tournament I suppose.

Barca,3a8kjg,melo_dont_leave_ny,3,Thu Jun 18 02:28:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it was a second yellow or a straight red, but a red was shown."
Barca,3a8kjg,Aj16ay,4,Thu Jun 18 02:08:17 2015 UTC,I'm glad he doesn't act like this for us. He lost his head this match
Barca,3a8kjg,theAnecdote,2,Thu Jun 18 02:25:52 2015 UTC,"Probably has to do with the players he plays with in Barca. When we have leaders like Masche, Pique and Messi, you can't lose your shit.   Still, very disappointing from Neymar."
Barca,3a8kjg,Blanchimont,2,Thu Jun 18 14:16:32 2015 UTC,"What the hell was he thinking? ""Hey, I'm suspended for the next match anyway! Let's provoke a Colombian so so perhaps he gets a red as well!""? This is no way for a captain to act. You've lost, suck it up, and move on."
Barca,3a8kjg,fcueva-,3,Thu Jun 18 08:15:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, he did. Carlos Bacca and him got red cards. Although, I think Neymar's was two yellows, and Bacca's was a straight red."
Barca,3a8kjg,ducati1011,2,Thu Jun 18 02:08:01 2015 UTC,No Neymar was a red card and so was bacca when a red gives a second yellow he will pull the second yellow and then the red. They say he can even miss three games!
Barca,3a8kjg,konoplya,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:11:15 2015 UTC,"what would've happened if neymar left the field on time and the ref didn't seem him anymore. right towards the end you see the people from brazil side rush neymar off the field when they see the ref running. if he was off the field would he not be able to get the red?  also, i don't think he intentionally meant to him the colombian with the ball. he just kicked the ball out of frustration right as the other guy ran up and wanted to jump in the air and celebrate."
Barca,3a8kjg,Blanchimont,2,Thu Jun 18 07:08:11 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, refs are allowed to give people red and yellows up until 30 minutes after the match has ended. So if one of his assistants sees player X punching player Y in the face in the tunnel, he can still get a red card. Alternatively, if the refs missed it, a disciplinary board could take action against player X if the matter was caught on camera or reported."
Barca,3a8kjg,JurijFedorov,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:22:52 2015 UTC,Both teams are stupid right there. Both Bacca and Neymar are important players for their teams. I hope he will be back to win the cup.
Barca,3a7d9r,j_roos,25,Wed Jun 17 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"Barca buys players from them because they develop good players and then sell them at reasonable prices while being professional in negotiations.  I can't think of many loans besides Suarez and Deulofeu, but, again, they are good at developing players."
Barca,3a7d9r,Hakob2,18,Wed Jun 17 20:30:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just them that are willing to sell us players. Adriano, Dani Alves, Rakatic, Aleix Vidal. My memory is not that deep."

Barca,3a7d9r,prateekdwivedi1,9,Wed Jun 17 20:42:23 2015 UTC,Oh yes. Well thank goodness for the good relationship. Alves and Rakatic alone have paid dividends.

Barca,3a7d9r,egcg119,5,Thu Jun 18 17:11:26 2015 UTC,Makes up for the somewhat unfavorable institutional relationship with Arsenal.
Barca,3a7d9r,_sic,12,Thu Jun 18 00:47:53 2015 UTC,"Sevilla embrace their role as a selling club, which most other mid/high-level clubs in Spain absolutely don't. So we buy from them a lot.   Recently, we've taken to loaning night talents - a very recent development that was once frowned upon - and so Sevilla have used our relationship to secure them on loan. We'll see how long that aspect of the relationship continues - my bet is not past this summer once we have a new president and a stable sporting project."
Barca,3a7d9r,wawin,2,Thu Jun 18 00:05:11 2015 UTC,"They (Monchi, I guess) also make sure that not to screw other teams on deals. Building long term relationships where both teams benefit is far more profitable than fleecing a team once. We've paid a lot for Sevilla players, but every deal we've done that I can remember has been a good deal for us as well as them."
Barca,3a7d9r,_sic,5,Thu Jun 18 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"I would like to point out that the relationship wasn't so easy about 7 years ago. Back then the president of Sevilla (Jose Marìa del Nido) was really vocally negative about Barcelona and Real Madrid and more vocal about how awesome they were at scouting talent cause they didn't have the money.  Anyways, one day Barcelona say they wanna get Dani Alves and they propose I think 25 million euro? and Sevilla's president was like ""Dani Alves's left boot is worth 25 million euro"". Negotiations were hard but Alves became a Barça  player and relationships between the clubs seemed to get better.  Then came Keita and a couple of years ago that president got sent to jail for tax evasion, relationship is even better without him there.   That said it's also worth noting that Barcelona nowadays likes to keep a great relationship with Sevilla also because Sevilla's +700 worldwide scouting network is elite level, think maybe only Porto's comes close in the amount of talent they find all over.   Sevilla's network has found: Sergio Ramos, Baptista, Kanoute, Luis Fabiano,  Medel,  Alves,  Capel, Negredo, Navas, Adriano, Rakitic, Keita and many more. So it's on Barcelona's best interest to be friendly with a club that is currently so great at finding talent and it's in Sevilla's best interest to be friendly with clubs that are willing to pay big transfer fees."

Barca,3a7d9r,gt4crazy2,9,Wed Jun 17 22:54:06 2015 UTC,"That Valencia exodus was pretty much one-off. They dominated Spanish football under Rafa Benítez, but didn't seem to be able to perpetuate their success in mid-2000s. As a result, they splashed out a lot on new talents, but that didn't buy them another title. Instead, that left them in a massive debt, and they had to sell nearly all of their stars to help out this situation. I doubt if that'll happen again with Peter Lim money.  On the other hand, Sevilla don't build their team on existing big stars. I'm sure that you've heard of the lengendary Monchi, the director of football of Sevilla. He has created an impressive scouting system that allows the club to spot potential talents before the big clubs do. Because of that, they're happy to sell their established stars to big clubs, take the money, and replace them with cheaper new signings. Not only does that keep Sevilla's finances in good shape, it also allows them to rejuvenate their squad."

Overall I think he is trending positively and I am not too worried about it. He's played some really tough matches recently w/o much of a break.
Barca,3a8srq,efarfan,-16,Thu Jun 18 04:08:48 2015 UTC,That's why I'm hoping Brazil get knocked out so Neymar can get proper rest. I always want our players to succeed but I think rest is needed in this case. Now if only Argentina would get knocked out too.

Barca,3a8srq,Kayhead996,2,Thu Jun 18 12:19:48 2015 UTC,I think he changes when things don't go well.

Barca,3a5aum,hhbenaf,10,Wed Jun 17 19:08:18 2015 UTC,"With him, we don't need Pogba. He should be the replacement for Iniesta from the bench (or even in the starting 11) and the midfield is complete: Busquets and Samper as defensive midfielder, Rafinha and Rakitic as box to box players and Iniesta and Suárez as playmakers. There is no place for Pogba, I hope we don't spend 80/90/100M in him and instead save that money for a good central defender next season, like Athletic's Laporte."
Barca,3a5aum,frasier_crane,3,Wed Jun 17 15:42:19 2015 UTC,We don't need to worry about defenders for a while. Suarez while a good attacking midfielder isn't the best option for replacing Iniesta that would be Halilovic because he is so similar in regards to dribbling and vision.
Barca,3a5aum,FrostyGrass,7,Wed Jun 17 18:15:02 2015 UTC,"Suarez while a good attacking midfielder isn't the best option for replacing Iniesta that would be Halilovic because he is so similar in regards to dribbling and vision.   So far from what they've each shown, Denis is a much more complete and better player than Halilovic. That includes dribbling and playmaking. Denis reminds me a lot of David Silva and has the potential to be a great playmaker"
Barca,3a5aum,Aj16ay,3,Wed Jun 17 20:01:06 2015 UTC,I would hope he would be more complete being he's 2 years older and has more experience. Both are top prospects that are going to develop into fantastic players.
Barca,3a5aum,FrostyGrass,2,Wed Jun 17 21:15:54 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that as of right now, Denis is much more likely to be a first team fixture than Halilovic, who really wasn't very good for Barça B this season. Last year Denis was the best player for the B team and led them to a high finish. Halilovic has a lot of work to do to even be close to Suárez"
Barca,3a5aum,Aj16ay,2,Wed Jun 17 21:32:47 2015 UTC,Oh I agree with you completely. I was just giving some feedback nothing more haha. But I wouldn't say he has a lot to do to be as good as Suarez.

Barca,3a5aum,Aj16ay,-1,Wed Jun 17 21:45:55 2015 UTC,"Why? He needs first team action, and Sevilla is a team that would be able to do that, even give him some Champions League gameplay as well."
Barca,3a5aum,FrostyGrass,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:43:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly, he needs first team action. Halilovic right now is not nearly as good as Deulofeu nor Denis Suarez, both of who got very little playing time at Sevilla. I'd rather he go to a team where he can be a starter instead of sitting on the bench because he's not good enough"
Barca,3a5aum,Aj16ay,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:20:59 2015 UTC,"And also, Sevilla is not the ideal place to learn. I can see Halilovic having the same ego problems as Deulofeu. And we all know how that turned out. Even Denis didn't play as much as he should.  They need a first team action week in, week out. I'd love to see him at Rayo."
Barca,3a5aum,flackohowyoubeen,2,Thu Jun 18 11:09:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Halilovic is still a child; he's 17 if I recall correctly and still has a long way before him prior to making it to Barça's first team. News say he may go on loan to Sevilla to replace Suarez and that looks like a good deal to me."

Barca,3a5aum,FrostyGrass,4,Wed Jun 17 20:06:40 2015 UTC,Good decision. I don't see a reason for us to start throwing around €50-80M for Pogba/Verratti to be signed in January. Let's just accept our ban and refrain from transfers for now.   Iniesta/Rakitic/Rafinha/Denis/Sergi is a strong squad of midfielders.
Barca,3a5aum,beskidtbawler,4,Wed Jun 17 19:06:31 2015 UTC,"My hope is that Laporta is reelected, as he is 5000 times more committed to La Masia then the rat Bartomeu, and he would trust our current crop of young midfielders to lead us into the future. How great would it be if in 5 years our midfield consisted of Samper at DM and Denis and Rafinha as CMs. That would be so awesome."
Barca,3a5aum,broad_h2o,28,Wed Jun 17 21:22:00 2015 UTC,I think it is a clear message that we do not need Pogba. We will make someone who will better than Pogba in a couple of years.
Barca,3a5aum,Tropicum,45,Wed Jun 17 11:48:05 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that Pogba is only one year older than Suarez. And at Barcelona Suarez will most likely not be given the chance to gain as much experience as Pogba already has. Pogba played a key role in a world class team for the past two seasons and he was given a lot of responsibility at a very young age. With Barcelona, Suarez will earliest make those experiences in one or two years. While I agree that Suarez might have as much talent as Pogba has, I doubt that he will overtake Pogba in his development as a player."
Barca,3a5aum,marsh_randy,10,Wed Jun 17 12:14:18 2015 UTC,"It's not impossible to think Suarez can come back and challenge for minutes immediately. He did very well at Sevilla to become a solid part of the starting xi there. Sure, he may not have had champions league quality opponents, but winning the EL is nothing to scoff at and he developed into a key player for them in the league. He can bring something new to the table as soon as he gets comfortable in lucho's system. Denis is not as raw as you may believe."
Barca,3a5aum,iLurkHard,6,Wed Jun 17 13:53:33 2015 UTC,"I have to admit that I haven't seen enough of Denis to judge his abilities. My statement was more based on past experiences with other young prospectives. After the Pep era it has become very difficult for coaches to integrate young players into the team as the demands put on the club are unbelievably high. The pressure applied by Real is of little help as well.  Playing Pogba on the other hand would not be a risky move for Enrique, as it was (in a way) a decision made by the board and as Pogba has already proven himself to some degree.  That being said, I really hope that Enrique has the guts to give Denis the playing time he deserves despite this pressure. If Enrique manages to integrate our young talents, he has in my opinion wholly proven that he is a world-class coach."
Barca,3a5aum,marsh_randy,30,Wed Jun 17 14:33:05 2015 UTC,"By this point, Pogba is close to being hyped to a point of him being disappointing almost no matter how well he performs"
Barca,3a5aum,siggaligga,19,Wed Jun 17 11:51:20 2015 UTC,I like where your head is at but I would put the odds at slim to none that Denis is ever as good as Pogba
Barca,3a5aum,Not_Tom_Brady,-9,Wed Jun 17 11:53:08 2015 UTC,"IMO, he can be as good, but they're so different in playstyle. Suarez is much more like Verratti, where Pogba is more like Marchisio/Vidal."
Barca,3a5aum,kezorN,21,Wed Jun 17 12:16:37 2015 UTC,"Denis is not like Verratti. He plays much higher up the pitch, behind the striker frequently. He reminds me more of David Silva."
Barca,3a5aum,johan14cruyff,2,Wed Jun 17 13:49:44 2015 UTC,"Well no, he is not exactly like Verratti in every way, and I wasn't referring to his position on the pitch but rather the type of player he is, physically and technically. Suarez is not as defensive-minded as Verratti."
Barca,3a5aum,kezorN,3,Wed Jun 17 14:20:09 2015 UTC,"Technically, yes. Physically, no.  I get what you mean though."
Barca,3a5aum,johan14cruyff,7,Wed Jun 17 15:01:42 2015 UTC,Denis is nothing like Verratti

Barca,3a5aum,Not_Tom_Brady,11,Wed Jun 17 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"A midfield consisting of Iniesta, Rakitic, Rafinha, Denis, Busquets and possibly Samper is just great.   No need for 80m, 12m a year overrated frenchmen.  EDIT: Added Busquets, I had just CMs in mind at first."
Barca,3a5aum,flackohowyoubeen,6,Wed Jun 17 13:52:14 2015 UTC,Busquets is only 26 too...
Barca,3a5aum,Csusmatt,3,Wed Jun 17 19:19:24 2015 UTC,And you're forgetting about Halilovic who has potential to be better than all of them bar Iniesta. Easily the best prospect we have to replace Iniesta's play-style.
Barca,3a5aum,FrostyGrass,6,Wed Jun 17 18:12:22 2015 UTC,Well he was at least. As far as I know he hasn't really managed to impress at the B team.
Barca,3a5aum,vanNostrandby,3,Wed Jun 17 19:47:39 2015 UTC,"New team, new country, new language, but even still was a good player. I'm waiting till next season now that he will have had time to acclimate."
Barca,3a5aum,FrostyGrass,5,Wed Jun 17 21:13:39 2015 UTC,"I mean.. Can we even do that? The loan deal was for 2 years. If he comes back, does this mean he'll stay out of action until January 16?"
Barca,3a5aum,Duke--Nukem,11,Wed Jun 17 13:27:19 2015 UTC,"He was previously ""signed"" by us. So he can come back. I believe the ban is for registering new players. But we can definitely bring players back from loan."
Barca,3a5aum,drunken_madman,-1,Wed Jun 17 13:52:03 2015 UTC,"I believe we'd have to register him since he wasn't registered with us, which may mean he can't play until January. I'm just speculating though."
Barca,3a5aum,Marchisio,3,Wed Jun 17 14:42:15 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure his contract is still owned by Barca so I don't think he needs to be registered again.

Barca,3a7e6k,brocccoli,3,Wed Jun 17 20:28:05 2015 UTC,ney is done two yellows and a red basically we going to see the Brazil from last years semi final play with no neymar
Barca,3a7e6k,Erock11,2,Thu Jun 18 03:13:24 2015 UTC,Round 2/3  18.06. - 02:00 Brazil vs Colombia  19.06. - 01:30 Peru vs Venezuela  Table   Brazil - 3pts Venezuela - 3pts Peru - 0pts Colombia - 0pts   Brazil win --> qualify for next round and Colombia pretty much out
Barca,3a5zyf,lonestar_10,16,Wed Jun 17 14:28:55 2015 UTC,"Good, we don't need any.  We have 2 insanely good GKs.  We have a stacked defensive line with plenty of subs.  We have a solid midfield filled with youth players (Rafinha, Denis Suarez, hopefully Samper).  AND to top it all off, the most feared and brutal front 3 the world has ever seen.  Who would have thought we'd be this confident the summer we're banned from transfers. I fucking love it!!"

Barca,3a5zyf,Marchisio,4,Wed Jun 17 20:37:27 2015 UTC,Okay it clearly says in the article of your link that Lucho wants him but Sevilla could block the move and that they are under no obligation to let him go. This is the reason why I am saying that his return is not for sure.
Barca,3a5zyf,polechi33,3,Wed Jun 17 21:29:42 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, but the fact that Lucho wants him and the several rumors I've been hearing over the past few months make it seem likely.   If for some reason it falls through we still have Sergi for rotation and possibly Halilovic if worst comes to worst as he's supposed to be promoted."
Barca,3a5zyf,Marchisio,-1,Wed Jun 17 21:42:54 2015 UTC,Would Halilovic count as a transfer from Barça B to Barça? If so wouldn't the transfer ban block the move?
Barca,3a5zyf,YoSoyMilkChocolate,3,Thu Jun 18 06:54:34 2015 UTC,"Of course not. All Barça B players can play at any point of time for the first team. They make contracts with the club, not with Barça B or the first team. There are just some rules for playing in the B-team."

Barca,3a5zyf,ksalama,2,Thu Jun 18 06:33:28 2015 UTC,Tell mods that they should make a banner out of this for /r/Barca so people would refrain from posting every transfer rumor made by SPORT.
Barca,3a5zyf,zero237,2,Fri Jun 19 22:14:28 2015 UTC,The funniest rumor is the Kondogbia rumor. Lol there are so many contrary reports of him going to AC Milan.

Barca,3a66m1,Marchisio,10,Wed Jun 17 15:21:02 2015 UTC,"Good, let him stay. We don't need another midfielder just yet, I'd rather continue with who we have and see how our youth players develop. If we really need him in another season or 2 then I say go for it, could his price be that much higher than it already is?  Also, this is good news b/c he won't be going to Madrid on top of not taking away minutes from homegrown talent. I hope this is true."

Barca,3a6ztu,neonpurplepanda,11,Wed Jun 17 18:48:11 2015 UTC,"He's definitely a legend for the club. He was the guy that scored the most (unofficial?) goals in club history before Messi. He played for the Philippines national team during their good years in the early 1900s but it fell after what I'd call Philippines era of ""US fetishization"" where they lost all the Spanish influence (for good reason if Catalonian history is a good indicator) and began their love for anything US-related after WW2, particularly around the start of the Marcos era.  Apparently he managed Spain in the 1950s for 3 games. He's nowhere near as big in the Philippines as he is was in Spain since they're a basketball country, but his place in Iloilo has a statue of him if that counts."
Barca,3a6ztu,epicstar,6,Wed Jun 17 19:23:49 2015 UTC,Legend!  It is said that his kick was so powerful it could rip through the goal net. Alcántara always wore a white scarf tied round his waist.  Paulino Alcántara
Barca,3a6ztu,brocccoli,3,Wed Jun 17 20:19:12 2015 UTC,"he has a statue in his hometown. he's been given recognition again last year, too, for a tribute titled 'pagpupugay', to honor past and present, living or deceased filipino sports icons."
Barca,3a6ztu,gt4crazy2,2,Thu Jun 18 00:34:43 2015 UTC,A lot of Filipinos actually don't know anything about him...

Barca,3a522r,Bonykhan,13,Wed Jun 17 16:59:00 2015 UTC,100%.  I think Tevez should start over Di Maria
Barca,3a522r,Turn_off_the_Volcano,6,Wed Jun 17 14:04:02 2015 UTC,"Starting Di Maria is equivalent to playing one man down. Maybe even worse, considering all the fuckups he constantly does on the pitch"

Barca,3a522r,klkklk,5,Wed Jun 17 21:32:35 2015 UTC,What is wrong with Di Maria all of a sudden? I remember him playing for RM and he was absolutely one of their bests. Is he failing at MU?  Edit: Mistake correction.
Barca,3a522r,Football_Enthusiast,6,Wed Jun 17 16:12:36 2015 UTC,"Based on his recent Argentina games and a couple Man U games, he is in no way shape or form consistent with the ball at his feet. There are just too many poor touches and shit passes for him to consistently benefit the attack. At least that's what I've noticed"
Barca,3a522r,AR1LM10,3,Wed Jun 17 16:22:33 2015 UTC,He seems to forget his sublime touching skill. I feel sad seeing him in this poor form.
Barca,3a522r,Football_Enthusiast,3,Wed Jun 17 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"He's just inconsistent as fuck. At his best he can be exceptional, but he can never keep his form consistently."
Barca,3a522r,kal1097,3,Wed Jun 17 16:19:44 2015 UTC,I've watched two games in Copa and he was just plain dull in both of them. He shouldn't start in the next match.
Barca,3a522r,Football_Enthusiast,3,Wed Jun 17 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"I'm really not sure what the problem is.  Carlo seemed to figure out how to best utilize him, a CM who drifted out wide.    One thing is for certain though, we have yet to see the Di Maria from RM again."
Barca,3a522r,Turn_off_the_Volcano,3,Wed Jun 17 16:28:49 2015 UTC,If he continues playing like this in the next match then I think he shouldn't be played after the group stage at all.
Barca,3a522r,Football_Enthusiast,3,Wed Jun 17 17:12:41 2015 UTC,yes lmao that moment was hilarious. Messi finally found a player shorter than him to fight but masche stepped in before he could even say a word
Barca,3a522r,jl8912,8,Wed Jun 17 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"Tata Martino is a moron as a coach. Argentina has so many talented players, they should be doing better."
Barca,3a522r,polechi33,14,Wed Jun 17 12:58:33 2015 UTC,Don't call him that. He almost won us the league with a much weaker team than Lucho's.   We did actually win the league if consider the wrongly disallowed goal against Atletico on the last match.   Tata fucked his subs for the first match and he won the second.
Barca,3a522r,Duke--Nukem,5,Wed Jun 17 13:34:57 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this opinion... Yes, Tata almost won us the league. But did you watch the games? Agaisnt Atleti we looked hopeless, there was no ACTUAL threat, even tho we had Messi and Neymar...  We looked so weak and with no real responses to some opponents."
Barca,3a522r,lelieth9,8,Wed Jun 17 17:41:41 2015 UTC,"Argentina has some ridiculous quality, Probably best set of attackers in the world, One of the best DMs in the world, A extremely good Defense (probably one of the more underrated part of their team) and they are not playing up to potential."
Barca,3a522r,papi617,6,Wed Jun 17 14:36:03 2015 UTC,I completely agree. Argentina should play much better. I hope for our players that the whole team will perform better match after match !!  I'd love to see Messi lift the Copa !
Barca,3a522r,Duke--Nukem,5,Wed Jun 17 16:18:10 2015 UTC,"I'm disappointed with Di Maria, what just happened to him? I'm not following MU but how is he doing over there? Otamendi and Rojo are really impressive; and although Romero did some really good saves in today's match (I read Romero doesn't get to play enough at Sampdoria) but I think they should include Rulli from Real Sociedad. Also the inclusion of at least one or two from Icardi/Vietto/Dybala will be good for them I think. Pastore and Banega are good too, specially Pastore reminds me of Riquelme (I hope Pastore becomes as good as Riquelme). And they better find a good replacement of Zabaleta (he is good but will be quite old for WC '18)."
Barca,3a522r,Football_Enthusiast,5,Wed Jun 17 16:23:30 2015 UTC,Di Maria started off well at United then he went downhill and lost a lot of confidence which led to some poor performances.
Barca,3a522r,papi617,3,Wed Jun 17 16:56:13 2015 UTC,Too bad for a player like him. I hope he finds his lost form again.
Barca,3a522r,Football_Enthusiast,3,Wed Jun 17 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"Agree, but for some reason Argentina can never produce a world class keeper...."
Barca,3a522r,Marchisio,5,Wed Jun 17 14:51:33 2015 UTC,Ruli guy from La Real is looking quite promising
Barca,3a522r,XsTream23,3,Wed Jun 17 15:53:03 2015 UTC,Rulli?

Barca,3a522r,XsTream23,3,Wed Jun 17 18:23:50 2015 UTC,Yeah he's talent and then there is a Augusto Batalla who just signed on loan to RM who is supposed to be talented as well.
Barca,3a522r,FrostyGrass,0,Wed Jun 17 18:31:56 2015 UTC,Never understood why Caballero was never called up for the World Cup squad. But Romero is surprisingly reliable though.
Barca,3a522r,YoSoyMilkChocolate,2,Thu Jun 18 07:05:30 2015 UTC,"It's really strange because they dominating for probably 80% of both matches, but they lack killer instinct. Same reason Messi had to keep bailing them out a year ago"
Barca,3a522r,aleks19998,5,Wed Jun 17 16:44:54 2015 UTC,"Perhaps what polechi33 is saying is too strong, but it's not wrong that this Argentina team should be playing better and more decisively than they are.  Also, Messi did not perform at his best under Tata at Barça.  Of course, all the problems cannot be placed at the feet of the coach, but with these players -- at least the attack -- an elevator operator should be able to get more out of them."
Barca,3a522r,zazzlekdazzle,2,Wed Jun 17 14:36:23 2015 UTC,"You got the idea. I take the moron part back, yet he is not a good coach. That was my point, there are better options for Argentina."
Barca,3a522r,polechi33,3,Wed Jun 17 17:32:01 2015 UTC,I think only a moron of a coach would get that Barca team that he had to play crosses into the box against Atletico...
Barca,3a522r,romanmoses,3,Wed Jun 17 20:06:59 2015 UTC,"Was it him or the players the ones who almost won us la liga? I think we got that far due to the individual skills of our players. We didn't win anything that year, and if he is so great as a coach can you explain me what was his game plan? What style were we playing? If he was so great why didn't we keep him? (please don't tell me because he didn't won anything) It was because the team was going nowhere.  You said it yourself, Argentina tied the first game because he fucked up. And yesterday, they won, true. But how well did the actually play? With all the players Argentina has, they should be doing much better with a proper coach.   This really upsets me because of Messi. The fact that Argentina is not naming the right guy to coach the national team, while Messi best years are passing. It really upsets me that Messi might never get to win a WC, not because  his teammates don't have skills but because of bad coaching."
Barca,3a522r,polechi33,2,Wed Jun 17 14:22:58 2015 UTC,"I firmly believe that Barça isn't a club that judge a brand new coach by the number of trophies the club win under his management in his first season; but under Tata's leadership it was clear that he doesn't have anything to offer that will make our team any better, so he got fired.   And I think Barça did the right thing by bringing Luis Enrique instead of keeping Tata because Lucho seems to be someone who tries to come up with new strategies or tactics to make our team perform better than the rivals. He identified our week-points, worked on it and made our team better on pitch. And also notice how our player's positive body language and their winning mentality were significantly visible on pitch so it was clear that LE did motivate our lads. And this is how a good professional coach should work with his team which I didn't see in Martino's coaching.  And about Messi, I want him to win World Cup more than Copa America. I hope Argentina appoint someone good like Jorge Sampaoli or Diego Simione for the next World Cup."
Barca,3a522r,Football_Enthusiast,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"I never said he is ""so great"". I just thought that calling him a moron was very harsh.  What did he do for us ? he was the first coach to implement a more direct approach and it was working really good for us before everybody loses their mind and call it a heresy.  Individual skills you say ? With Messi's probably worst season, plagued with injuries ?  He was doing a good job...up until people start putting pressure on him and up until Messi gets injured.  Lucho started where Tata left it. MORE DIRECT PLAY. Of course, when you have Neymar & Suarez things are much much more easier.  Is he a great coach ? probably not. Is he a moron ? NO."
Barca,3a522r,Duke--Nukem,3,Wed Jun 17 16:12:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, my bad. I take the moron part back, yet he is not a good coach. That is the point I was trying to make, there are better options for Argentina out there."

Barca,3a522r,Duke--Nukem,3,Wed Jun 17 18:22:38 2015 UTC,"not sure its his fault, the players have some blame too.  what were they doing having 3 forwards on the half line, not defending, when they were trying to hold a lead against Paraguay?  If Messi is going to sit around and watch the game from half way, then the other guys need to at least fill in for him where a player in his position would normally be defending, you know kind of like Rakitic does for Barca."

Barca,3a5btt,jklz,10,Wed Jun 17 10:13:30 2015 UTC,"Ayoub is an amazing talent, capable of playing in the advanced midfield positions and in attack as a false 9 or a left winger. I was really looking forward to seeing him tearing up Juvenil A next season with Aleña, Oriol Busquets, Carles Pérez etc.   Promoting him to Juvenil A at age 16 and then barely playing him,  might turn out as a really bad mistake.   Hopefully he'll be back some day."
Barca,3a5btt,Icarium_lifestealer,5,Wed Jun 17 10:16:33 2015 UTC,"How did we let this happen? He is a great talent and we need to protect our talent better. Next what lee leaves? Every one is busy dealing with politics and shit, they stopped caring about la masia. Unacceptable."

Barca,3a4zr3,ohkwon96,20,Wed Jun 17 07:20:04 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a tough question, I hope I will be able to explain it properly. First of all, we have to look at the defence, because every defender has it's own task in attack.  Alba makes vertical runs in attack and supports Neymar.  Alves plays a bit more centrally than Alba and helps the build up play.  Piqué and Mascherano sometimes walk with the ball nearly Busquets position, hence helping the circulation. Busquets is distributing the ball and his excellent vision and ability to recognize passing options is the key to Barcelona's gameplay. Rakitic is organizing the attacking play partly, but he is mainly the cover of Alves if he gets forward and he is balancing the movement of Messi. If Messi cuts inside, Raki goes wide and helps stretch the opposition. If Messi stays wide, he stays central and helps the circulation.  Iniesta is not the attacking midfielder he used to be but still does his tasks somewhat effectively, which is nearly the same as Rakitic's on the left side, but Ini sometimes goes to the LAM position he used to play and plays killer passes. Messi does everything, I don't need to explain it. Suárez makes vertical and diagonal runs, and his ability to recognize when to run and when not makes him so effective at Barca and of course his ability to help the build up play and assist or finish it off by himself. Neymar is linking up with Alba and Iniesta, and tends to cut inside and play close to Suárez and Messi.   I hope I could help you. :)"
Barca,3a4zr3,DaveH1227,4,Wed Jun 17 08:47:42 2015 UTC,Perfect
Barca,3a4zr3,MSNFCBLove,2,Wed Jun 17 08:49:03 2015 UTC,"Who would you say is the most important player for the system to work? I feel like it would be Busquets, as he seems to make everything tick (and looks so calm and at ease while doing so). I also feel like Rakitic, while as great as he is as a playmaker, has gone unnoticed for his defensive work for Alves (at least it seems that way to me).   How, in your opinion, do you think they're able to play so fluently? I mean, sure, most of your players are brought up in La Masia, but Suarez, Rakitic, and (especially) Neymar seemed to have no problem adapting to the style of Barca. I know they are great players, and great players have that ability to adapt, but it seems so strange that it took less than a season for these players to play in a system that requires so much.   Also, just out of curiosity, how much do Barca fans rate Mascherano? As a Liverpool fan, it sucked to see him leave, especially cause he left at a time when he was playing amazing football. Obviously didn't hurt as much as Torres, Suarez, or Alonso... but still. It seems strange to me that he plays as a center back. He's not the tallest or fastest, but he did have an excellent reading of the game so I assume that's what makes him a starter for Barca? Or is it that you guys don't really have any other options, bar Bartra (who I must say looks unbelievably amazing [not gay, 100% straight], but man he looks like he was carved by the hands of God).   P.S. I'm serious about Suarez. Give him back to us."

Barca,3a4zr3,IhateAngryBirds,-5,Thu Jun 18 00:22:48 2015 UTC,"Well Barcelona system.. Back with Pep we saw a very delicate style, kind of like making love, it was passionate, gave us pleasure and it was a beautiful thing.  With Lucho, it's quite different, it's like going in dry through the backdoor, it's great for us, but not great for the one on the other end, the system relies on forcing the way through with our front, which comes to ""send the ball to the front as fast as possible"", the midfield was made less important than previous years, and only serves as a way to get the ball up front faster.  You know, from all our players besides Messi, Busquets is our most important one, he adapts to any style we do, and whenever he gets shut (Bayern first leg before Messi's goal), it looks like we're getting nowhere. It actually surprises me how no other team tries to shut down Busquets."

I feel more prepared than ever to lead this club, I have more experience, I have my faults, that most of you know, but I maintain the same principles.  For me, Barça is 'més que un club', it's a declaration of principles, a model based on Cruyff, La Masia, Catalunya, UNICEF, a multi-sport club and a professional organization that makes sure that this model works and during my campaign I will defend this model for our club.  For many years I have received a lot of support from Barcelonistas, from the bottom of my heart I thank all of you, and it's one of the reason why I'm presenting myself here again. The moment of truth has arrived and now, more than ever, I need the support from all of you. We all have to work in this campaign to make sure that once again Barça belongs to all of us.

The sport sections are working and economically the club is better now than any time I remember it to be! There is a plan for Espai Barça and Camp Nou and economically it won't spoil the future. I'm all for Barto. I hated Rosell and I didn't vote on him back in 2010 but I like the way Barto deals with things and I want him to continue!

You're okay with a man who would ALLOW SELLING THE NAME OF OUR STADIUM?!  You and everyone else who supports Bartomeu, is exactly the kind of people who don't understand the club, and probarly supported Man Utd 6 years ago.

Barca,3a3a1p,tiagom0702,7,Wed Jun 17 14:04:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm perfectly fine with Qatar being our partner. Money allows Barça to be stronger and more competitive each day and I'm not talking about football only. Barça has an incredible structure that isn't cheap and I prefer to see money flowing to the club without the necessity of increasing the quotas to the members like me. Unfortunately we're facing a crisis in south Europe and if the quotas are increased the number of members will decrease and the revenue won't go up like pretended.   La Masia isn't being overlooked. The current generation isn't as strong as the later and the next. The results of our second squad show it and we can't blame the president for it. At least he didn't shit on La Masia with it having talent like when Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué left the club.   I'm not okay with corrupt transfers but Laporta isn't the solution or don't you know why Hleb, Affelay, Chygrynskiy and Ibrahimovic (yes, even him) were signed back in Laporta's days?   I don't remember to ever have heard Bartomeu saying he wants to sell the name of the stadium.   You're saying I don't understand the club, right? Me and my family are Blaugrana since almost the beginning of the club, my ancestors used to go to Les Corts back in the days when the Culé word gain its meaning. I'm probably more into the club's business than you ever were. And 6 years ago I was already a Culé because I'm a member since the month I was born. My family left Catalunya when the civil war was going on and despite we're living in Portugal since then we're still die hard pro Catalunya and Barça members and we will always be. So you can go guess that kind of bullshit elsewhere.   To end the response of my rant I'll vote Barto and so will my whole family."

And you keep defending a guy who will go to court for TWO different cases, the latest one will be for corruption, because of the ""business"" they did while being in this club. The same guy who promised Abidal a renewal but in the end lied and let him go because they wanted to save money from wages. But hey fuck our sporting project because we are economically well, right? Or nah. Laporta made us the 2nd richest club in the world. Now we are at 4th. Bartomeu has NOTHING to do with the sucess the team is having right now. Enrique was Zubi's signing, you know the guy Barto fired the day after he said Bartomeu was responsible for the FIFA Ban (and he actually was.). And blaming the La Masia troubles on us not having ""Fabregás talent"" is just rubbish. La Masia have not been the same since they kicked Cruyff out of the club, you should read what journalist's who is following them closely is saying. Even Xavi said after he left, ""You should not confuse the sporting succes with what is going on socialy at the club.""  But for all well vote for Bartomeu if it makes you happy, but just know you will vote for a guy who might end up in jail within one years time."
Barca,3a3a1p,tiagom0702,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:22:04 2015 UTC,"You ignorant fool, La Masia ban is due to signing young players illegally and half of those cases are Laporta's. Tell me more on how Bartomeu is to blame. And do you know why Abidal wasn't signed? Because Zubi and Tito didn't think the squad had space for him and he wasn't worth wasting a wage. Furthermore, go check who was the president at that time. And do you know that you are wrong about Barça being only the fourth richest club? Barça is only second do Manchester United in football, and if you consider all sports Barça is the third only behind the Dallas Cowboys and Manchester United. And do you know how wealth was created with Laporta? By creating debt; do you know how it's done now? With assets. I'm an economist and I'm well informed by what's happening in the club so I'm 100% sure.   And by the way, are you a member and you'll vote or are you just talking shit out of your mouth and can't even vote?"

Barca,3a19dc,Chillidawg,24,Tue Jun 16 13:07:20 2015 UTC,"Performance this season.  Good. He hasn't played as much as in earlier seasons, and it's clearly been difficult for him to come off the bench and only get 15-20 minutes per appearance. Despite that he's contributed with a good amount of assists (particularly for Messi, which highlights the great relationship the two of them have on the pitch) and a double figure goal-tally. That's really not bad at all, considering how much time he's spent on the bench.  Upcoming years.  From the looks of it, Pedro will have to get used to playing the role of a substitute. And considering that he just renewed his contract Pedro is most likely prepared for that reality. I find it highly unlikely that we will see the same output as in previous seasons, where he's scored 15-20 goals, but we shouldn't expect those numbers from Pedro considering his diminished role. Pedro is an important member of the squad. He's been at the club for over a decade and as a result he is a real culture bearer at our club. With the recent farewells of Puyol, Valdés and Xavi it is important to have other culture bearers in the dressing room, who can continue where the three of them left off, and keep guiding the rest of the squad.  Best moment this season.  The bicycle kick is obviously a big one, but other than that Pedro was heavily involved in our title-winning goal at Vicente Calderón. It was one of his 6 assists for Messi this season. Only Suárez has assisted more Messi-goals than that, and as I mentioned earlier it just goes to show that there is a great mutual understanding between Pedro and Messi. Pedro has very often taken part in those lethal combinations on the edge of the penalty area, and it often has resulted in a goal.  Tl;dr: Pedro is awesome."
Barca,3a19dc,Pek-Man,25,Tue Jun 16 13:50:50 2015 UTC,"Great idea! his bicycle kick goal, for me, was arguably one of the best goals of the season in la liga.. shows he still has it and deserves a start, although given our current forward line up, I don't see it happening unless they're injured or lucho wants them to rest.. I was a bit surprised when he renewed his contract, but that just proves his dedication towards the club.. It's a privilege watching him play.."
Barca,3a19dc,blackk_ice,-7,Tue Jun 16 13:26:52 2015 UTC,"What all the easy chances he missed all season ? Or does the bicycle kick erases all of that ? This sub gets ridicoulous every now and then.. no room for criticizing any of our players.  I seriously doubt many of you saw him play in 2009 if you think he did good this season, he had no precision and was always afraid to shoot, the stats prove it, not that it matters. I'm going to full unpopular opinion this time and say we shuold have sold him because he is way past his prime and because i wanted some new young talent like Dybala or whatever to get minutes of play alongside MSN. Downvote all you want, i don't care."
Barca,3a19dc,droid750,4,Tue Jun 16 22:46:24 2015 UTC,"Lots of easy chances are missed by the front three as well. Especially neymar, who has scored lots but has missed lots as well. Does that mean he failed? No. Same goes for Pedro's chances missed. But I don't know about started Pedro."
Barca,3a19dc,jimtheguy69,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:55:02 2015 UTC,"Neymar scored twice as much per minutes played. 2300min/11g vs 4500min/38g. You can't just say that Neymar also misses alot. And i can't find older stats but Pedro did not score a goal every 209 minutes when he was in form, trust me on that."
Barca,3a19dc,droid750,6,Tue Jun 16 23:17:54 2015 UTC,I still rather trust Pedro then Sandro or munir. Pedro is a passer and will likely look to pass then score. Pedro isn't amazing but its kind of hard to be in top form as a sub and try to attack when the team is either tired or just looking to and the game.

Barca,3a19dc,RazorOmega,8,Fri Jun 19 00:33:18 2015 UTC,"Pedro. Pedro Pedro Pedro. Where do I begin?  I love Pedro. He is one of my favorite players in the club, and one of the players who i'm most passionate about defending.   I'm excited that he renewed, and i'm hoping it's not just so FCB can make some money on a transfer.   I think selling Pedro could in the future be seen as a critical point in the changing of the culture at FCB. He is one of the best to ever come out of La Masia, and while not Catalan, he is Spanish. Selling a Spanish product of the youth system, especially someone like Pedro, who became the first to ever score in six different competitions in the same year, who was part of the MVP line that won a CL, etc., would, for me at least, really show that FCB is no longer interested in raising players through the youth system. We've gone from a club that once fielded 11 players from our youth system on the field at one time, to a club that now has only 2 players who have only known Barcelona football. MaTS, Alves, Pique, Masche, Alba, Rakitic, Suarez and Neymar have all played senior football at other clubs. Sure, Pique and Alba were in the youth system, but they were only brought back to the club after significant success at other clubs. While trophies and awards are a measure of success, they have only been so in the pursuit of a system product of total football from youth to senior club. Selling off our greatest youth product shows that 'Mes que un club', is starting to fade from the teams identity. Look at the treble celebrations; not a single player, coach, signage, referred to us as more than a club, because it is now trebles and sextuples that are what drives us forward.   Club identity rant aside, Pedro is critical to the club moving forward, and I think/hope Enrique recognizes it. Any injury to the trident would be severely detrimental moving forward. It would lead us back to total reliance on Messi, and that is something that teams have already figured out how to defend against. Pedro is more than a super sub, he is enough of a threat, and talented enough that the loss of Neymar or Suarez for an extended period would not cause a critical drop off in terms of on field production. I would like to see him get more minutes next season. He should certainly be starting every CdL match, while rotating the top three. He also should see more league action. We were somewhat fresh at the end of the season because Suarez spent over a month on the sidelines. It would do good for us next season to continue to rotation out the front three, so that we are fresh for the business end of the season. Having a Sandro or a Munir is nice, but Pedro is still a significantly better option up top, and will still be able to be of use against bigger teams when needed."
Barca,3a19dc,BarcaJeremy4Gov,3,Tue Jun 16 15:37:16 2015 UTC,"Correct me if i am wrong but ''Mes que un club'' is more about catalan identity and strugle for freedom and independence than it is about home grown players.   If you want to be at the top you cant depend always on youth system, generation of xavi and iniesta will come only every 50 years if not more. System of play is what Barca is about if they stick to it and develop that style of football than they can stay on this level for a long time, also there is Messi factor who makes a big difference.  Edit: forgot about Pedro. Pedro had his chance as starting trio and he didnt produce top level football as Alexis didnt either, but that aside i think he is valuable team player who knows the system and i appreciate that he is willing to stay and be used as bench rotation player."
Barca,3a19dc,Finxjar,2,Tue Jun 16 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It is about Catalan identity. However, when you don't have any Catalan, or even Spanish players, it becomes difficult to both push the message, as well as for fans to accept the message. The ultras are always going to wave the senyara, and will always whistle the king during a CdL final, but the club has been so focused on revenues, and trophies that the message is no longer being carried out. It was an immense measure of respect towards the locals when a player would speak to them or answer interview questions in Catalan. This doesn't happen anymore. Messi does it on occasion, Xavi was fluent, Iniesta only does it when he gets sauced (which is good enough for me). Pep was religious about responding to questions in Catalan. Even our tifo and stadium displays are in English now. Not Catalan, not even Spanish. FCB survived for decades because of the faith shown by Catalans, and now they are more concerned with catering to Asian, American, and South American fans than they are to those who made them what they are today.  What have FCB as a club done lately to push Catalan identity? Our away kit? Broadcasting radio play by play? Those youth players were raised in the academy and were exposed to the Catalan identity, and would identify themselves as maybe not born Catalans but adopted ones. Does Rakitic care about Catalonia? Neymar? MaTS? Pogba? No. But Messi does. Iniesta does. Xavi and Pedro do.   I also agree with /u/Lladz that no, mes que un club isn't necessarily a transfer policy. But the club is associated with it's players and coaches, and when we've got players and coaches who don't identify as Catalan either by birth or by choice, the message starts to lose it's meaning."
Barca,3a19dc,BarcaJeremy4Gov,3,Tue Jun 16 22:33:26 2015 UTC,"I've got a bunch of issues with this line of thought.   He is one of the best to ever come out of La Masia, and while not Catalan, he is Spanish.    You start with one of the best, and then later say he's the greatest. Which is he?  Also, Pedro joined the club when he was 17. That's a far cry from the likes of Xavi and Iniesta. He had three great seasons, and since then has been good, not great. But that's not that important.   would, for me at least, really show that FCB is no longer interested in raising players through the youth system.   This is ass-backwards. Pedro will be 29 next summer, and we have a host of young players who could use his minutes. He's not good enough to start, and after this season, his minutes off the bench should be going to players who will benefit vastly from it in the long run. That's not abandoning the youth philosophy, that's keeping it alive. Keeping Pedro instead of younger, more talented players out of a misguided sense of values is stagnation pure and simple.  We also have to talk about unrealistic expectations of club identity. We fielded 11 club players on the field at a time when our team was struggling hugely. At no point in our history had that ever happened before, so why is it the standard now? Our best team ever, by any metric - trophies, style of play, values, you name it - was heavily influenced by crucial foreign players. Currently the core of the team is Messi, Pique, Iniesta, and Busquets - all homegrown. We've got a lot of promising youngsters coming through. We just made a point of replacing Alves with a Catalan RB. It's not as if we're completely off-track.  And Pique and Alba are somehow less Masia because they left for a few years? Prior to this golden generation of the 2000s, how many players have we had in the club's history who meet your exacting standard of one-club men? Honest question, I don't know the answer, but it seems like your main interpretation of this club's 100+ year-old identity exists only in the 21st century. It seems weird to claim this is what our age-old motto means (it's not) while referring to only relatively recent phenomena."

Barca,3a19dc,Lladz,8,Tue Jun 16 16:46:25 2015 UTC,"Pedro is one of our most important players. He was part of the MVP front three and has been providing great help during this second treble season.  He could be a starter in a lot of top teams; it's just that.. Messi, Neymar & Suarez are all superior to him so he doesn't start a lot but he is always there when called up and he is always trying to help MSN, providing key assists and scoring some nice goals.  His extension was great news. However, I am not sure he'll stay. I don't remember where I read that his extension was just him being a bro so that the club can cash out on him if a good offer comes. So I guess there's a mutual respect there.. the player commits to a new deal and the club will stay open and let the player decide of his future. I guess he earned it.  I hope he doesn't leave though."
Barca,3a19dc,Duke--Nukem,5,Tue Jun 16 14:14:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the common perception of him seems to be that even though people want him to stay, they still want to see him play. For me, the ideal thing to do would be to sell him with a high price to a different team I like."
Barca,3a19dc,Duke--Nukem,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:18:02 2015 UTC,"if he is not happy about the role that he's given, he has the right to leave ! the club won't block his transfer. I hope he stays though.. Barca seasons are long and painful"
Barca,3a19dc,iVarun,7,Tue Jun 16 15:04:48 2015 UTC,Will always have a soft spot for Pedro. I wished he would move on to get more minutes because he is worth it. But with the Trident it's going to be complicated. It's bad for him personally but it's good for the squad and the team.
Barca,3a19dc,_sic,3,Tue Jun 16 15:16:32 2015 UTC,"This, on all counts. Unless somebody gets injured he will play just as little as he did this season, since all three of the starting forwards pout whenever they are subbed. It would probably have been better for his international career, not to mention his club career, to have signed with another club that would feature him."
Barca,3a19dc,barcafor20,3,Tue Jun 16 19:23:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything here besides ""wishing that he'd have moved on"""
Barca,3a19dc,david4bcn,5,Tue Jun 16 16:48:10 2015 UTC,All goals and assists in UCL/Liga/Copa - https://youtu.be/eTCJL8cuVU8
Barca,3a19dc,XsTream23,5,Tue Jun 16 14:54:45 2015 UTC,"ok , my favorite player discussion, going to be a long comment so i want first to  thank David for making that video (the xstream guy  that commented there  on the YT video is me)   i ll try to remain unbiased through my analysis.  i think his beginning of the season was actually quite poor, new ideas for lucho, new tactics, took him awhile to adapt but around the ajax games from CL , he started playing a lot better, offering more asssits  ( Leo getting one in that game)  than came the CDR run against Huesca and some other low rated teams ,Elche and so in which he managed to play very well and gaining a lot of confidence.   course of the season though, although his form was improving i feel like he didnt get enough minutes as he should deserve , often getting subbed only in the last few minutes ,playing about 10 minutes/ game, its quite remarcable that he managed to do  a lot of things in those minutes as a sub this season, score a few amazing goals (the one against La Real stays in my mind) and also offering some great assists (CL  winning goal assist to Neymar )   but also as a starter he had some excelent games, against Cordoba in which he offered Suarez first goal in la liga ,  against Atletico in which  he managed to give the winning league assist to Leo after that short 1-2.  His Qualities remain the same, hard working player, ambidextrous , usually good finishing , his positioning while sometimes questionable, he is always trying to make runs and waiting for passes from his teammates, most of the they dont come for some reason..  but i feel like this season he managed to diversify his role in the team ,  he is not only a winger anymore, he has played in multiple positions, on both sides of the pitch as a LW/RW  , or as a Number 9 and even as a RWB against PSG where he had a goodgame.  Its difficult situation for him to be on the bench having such a competitive first 11 full of talent  and i would say ego  especially MSN  (in a good way) ,  he could have left us join other team  and become a regular starter but because he loves Barca so much decided to stay here.   there are little players in this world capable of being so selfless and putting the team as priority over his own glory just as there are little players capable of subbing in for MSN and keeping a high level of game.  many fans believe that deulofeu or any youngster would be better in that sub role, i kindly disagree, yes, they should be included in the first team and given some minutes but i would rather rely on somebody with experience that has already proven that he s capable of making game winning plays.  I hope he will retire here and in future get to play more, i'm sad for his situation as  from a regular starter ,being the world first player to score in every competition and to have excellent form  to get injured and get out of it and fighting for his position to be almost in vain since the club was buying new players (alexis, suarez now, no doubt excellent players but i m just sad for his own career)  hopefully Lucho will rotate the squad more and offer him some more minutes/matches this new season, one thing that worries me is the fact that we bought Aleix, somebody fully capable of playing as a winger aswell, and while it will improve our dept in squad, i hope it wont affect Pedro's playtime.  as a conclusion , i think his season was a good one, sadly not much playtime but always managed to get something out of his little minutes, goals/assists key passes, commitment and hard work"
Barca,3a19dc,domi_28,5,Tue Jun 16 18:34:01 2015 UTC,"for a player to get this minimal time on the pitch and to assist the league winning goal and the CL clinching goal is just football's way of rewarding one of the best team players, most hardworking, humble and loyal players* a football fan can ask for. I am so glad he's staying and he will always be one of the most underrated gems that La Masia has gifted us Edit*"
Barca,3a19dc,Football_Enthusiast,3,Tue Jun 16 17:03:48 2015 UTC,Almost everyone will agree about Pedro's best moment in '14-'15 which is;    that screamer bicycle kick goal against Real Sociedad.
Barca,3a19dc,Denixd,3,Tue Jun 16 14:20:17 2015 UTC,That was my only game I've seen live in the Camp Nou :) I'll never forget that goal and the atmosphere. The stadium went WILD :D

Barca,3a19dc,EpicChiguire,-4,Tue Jun 16 17:56:12 2015 UTC,What quality? I'm not even being sarcastic. I reeeeeally don't rate him anymore because I see that he does nothing useful in important matches.
Barca,3a19dc,PerfectGentleman,4,Wed Jun 17 00:29:51 2015 UTC,Did you see the same season as I did? He worked his ass off the few minutes he had this season.

Barca,3a19dc,EpicChiguire,-4,Wed Jun 17 03:53:25 2015 UTC,"And throughout the whole season, what did he do? Two or three good matches don't erase an almost invisible season."

Barca,3a19dc,Entrepreneutralizer,3,Tue Jun 16 19:31:19 2015 UTC,"I think he will be key next season.  We will have a more-tired-than-usual Neymar-Messi to begin the season, in which we will have quite a few more games than we had this season (2 Spanish Supercup, 1 Euro Supercup, 1-2 Club World Cup), with the added difficulty that they are all in the first half of the season.  Add to it that he should be well rested during this summer, and he will surely have quite a few minutes to begin the season. Hopefully his new contract injects some calm into his game, I feel that when he is calm his finishing and runs are twice as good as when he is desperate to prove himself (most of this season)."
Barca,3a19dc,_sic,2,Tue Jun 16 18:39:40 2015 UTC,"i was frequently frustrated with pedro during this season. he seems to have lost whatever made him so good years ago. That, or the bar has been raised by MSN."

Barca,3a19dc,jimtheguy69,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:37:11 2015 UTC,Who would you rather replace him with though? The reason he doesn't get shit is because he's a back up and is the best back up we have that would not complain about minutes.

Barca,3a19dc,EpicChiguire,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:20:58 2015 UTC,Then why not just use Pedro and either Sandro or munir. I think Sandro should try at striker and let Pedro be a back up for neymar.

Barca,3a19dc,hectorinho,-1,Wed Jun 17 00:28:54 2015 UTC,"I will say what I think: Pedro is not the same dangerous player from seasons ago. In fact, he's of no use to us any longer. He runs and runs, and that's all, just giving an assistance or scoring a goal every 2-3 matches he gets played. His time at Barca is over, IMO. We should sell him asap."
Barca,3a19dc,AvocadoCake,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:28:05 2015 UTC,"Random thing I'd like to note:  Pedro's buyout clause is reportedly quite high with his contract extenstion, but I have a strong feeling it will drop considerably if he doesn't reach a minutes per season threshold.  Just a thought, and this part of the contract would not be made public so we wouldn't no abou it."
Barca,3a19dc,therealemile,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:45:44 2015 UTC,still one of my favorite players on the team. I was surprised he stayed as he could easily get more playing time elsewhere but that shows his dedication to the team.

So sure, bring back Laporta, he fits the profile, another stint as president will probably be that final push he needs to land himself in jail, alongside Nuñez.   As long as we keep winning tripletes I don't really care, lol.   An article in el País pointed out the other day how the models used by RM and Barça were exact opposites: under Perez there has been institutional stability, but instability on the pitch, with players and coaches coming and going like crazy, no established football philosophy to guide them and of course relatively few titles. Meanwhile at Barça there has been absolute chaos at the top, with all sorts of legal problems to boot, but the team has remained relatively stable following it's football philosophy and of course winning truckloads of trophies ;)"

Barca,3a13f5,arkhamandcheese,5,Wed Jun 17 05:27:27 2015 UTC,Laporte may not be a saint but at least he can keep his shady deals away from tarnishing the club. Bartomou/Rosell fucked the club over on multiple occasions. We got a one year transfer ban for crying out loud. Laporte would not be incompetent enough to do that.
Barca,3a13f5,marsh_randy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:32:33 2015 UTC,"I agree. Let's also remember that Laporta and his associates brought barca from the horrible days of 2002-3 to the legendary years with guardiola, ronaldinho, eto'o, henry and of course messi.  I very much doubt barto or rosell would have been able to do the same in those circumstances. For fucks sake, we're banned from transfers for a year, involved in multiple lawsuits, and got Qatar on our shirts - all this during the best years in this club's history.  I for one definitely trust Laporta more. Like he himself said - cruyff, masia, Catalunya and unicef. Those are all things the club should focus more on instead of shady deals, lawsuits and Arab money."

The reason, Oliver insisted the following day, was simple: Franquesa had confessed to him that he felt like he was being watched, so Oliver decided to help him out by having him put under surveillance. Oh, and by throwing three other vice-presidents into the mix for good measure. There was no espionage; it was in fact a ""security audit"" carried out for their ""protection"" – one that Laporta didn't even know about until after it had been completed, some five months ago. It was for all their ""own good"".  Of course it was. And it was nothing to do with the fact that next summer Laporta's presidential term will come to an end, that all four men, backed by other board members, are in line to replace him on a continuity ticket""  http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/sep/28/barcelona-keeping-tabs-sid-lowe  ""Some €37.2m (£32.6m) lost on Zlatan Ibrahimovic, €24.35m on two players who've never played, and €7.5m on an Argentinian Soccer School where no one seems to be learning very much – still less graduating – plus €18m on land that's only worth €5.5m. And that's just the start. New car, caviar, four star? Pah, that's got nothing on this. That's not a Lear Jet, sunshine; this is a Lear Jet. Five of them, in fact. What's a spot of caviar compared to spending €8m on the Pizza Man, €262,000 on restaurants, and €576,000 a year on vol-au-vents, jamón Serrano and bits of pineapple on cocktail sticks? A figure that adds up to €20,000 per match, every match.  There's more, too. What's the point in buying you a football team, when a football team can buy you everything else? When it can spend €5.7m on private jets, €5.9m on a telly channel, and €53,000 on the chauffeurs' credit card – for drinks, cigars and perfume. €656,000 on security, blown €3,000 a month on giving your lover a job, and splashed €90,000 for tickets to go and see Bono. That's Bono, the Irish singer named after a hearing aid, not José Bono, the president of the Spanish parliament, who's a Madrid fan anyway. €5,600 on luxury hotels in Dubai, €2.65m spying on directors, fans and journalists, and €1,514 for a night at the Shangri-La in Qatar.

Barca,3a13f5,domi_28,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:44:33 2015 UTC,Laporta was jus a charismatic lawyer.  Rosell was an executive.  Benedito is an entrepenuer.  rosell/laporta had their own personal failings but all three were at or near the top of their respective professions and they all have experiences that they can or did draw on in the running of a club.  There is nothing that can prepare you for this kind of experience other than this kind of experience.
Barca,3a13f5,qgy683,3,Tue Jun 16 14:51:45 2015 UTC,"Obviously Laporta so no saint, and when he left, everyone thought its best for the club. however, this race seems to be between Laporta and Barto realistically and as corrupt as Laporta was (like Perez and many other presidents) his corruption didn't affect the FC Barcelona name. No tax Fruads no bans etc. if it was up to me I wouldn't want either of these guys, but if its a choice between him and Barto (which as far as I've read it seems like that) I wouldn't want Barto back."
Barca,3a13f5,elanciano31,-1,Tue Jun 16 16:02:12 2015 UTC,"so now we are quantifying how much corruption we are willing to accept.  It is not just a choice between the two, no matter how much laporta fanboys want you to think that."

Why, when there is a chance to have new leadership are you so insistent on the same corrupt old clowns?"

Barca,3a1i0n,Bleessang,8,Tue Jun 16 14:30:57 2015 UTC,"That would be an impressive record for them; the undefeated treble winner; they didn't lose a single game in '71-'72 European Cup, 7 wins and just only 2 draws in the entire tournament. And also notice that they conceded the least amount of goal in that season. Ajax back then were pretty amazing; they have the record of winning EC consecutive three times since '70 to '73 (Cruyff was a big part of their success)."
Barca,3a1i0n,YoSoyMilkChocolate,4,Tue Jun 16 14:56:45 2015 UTC,Who was the team to beat them?
Barca,3a1i0n,B_i_llt_etleyyyyyy,3,Tue Jun 16 16:19:05 2015 UTC,Ajax only lost one match in Eredivisie and that was the only defeat they suffered in the whole '71-'72 season. Unfortunately I can't find who defeated them.

Barca,3a1i0n,vanNostrandby,3,Tue Jun 16 17:42:22 2015 UTC,"I remember due to volcanic ash cloud, air travel in Europe was stalled which forced Barça to visit Milan by bus and suffered an away defeat that ultimately eliminated us from the semi-final stage of UCL '09-'10 which was shocking for me because Barça defeated Arsenal in the quarter final stage quite convincingly (remember Messi scored 4 goals in the second leg at home?) so I thought Inter wouldn't be too tough."
Barca,3a1i0n,darthvader7888,2,Tue Jun 16 18:00:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember being worried about them just because they knew how to park the bus, but they completely shut us down.

Barca,3a1993,Januzaj7,35,Tue Jun 16 13:06:13 2015 UTC,"I think Seydou was great. I didn't know what to expect when we bought him, as I was unsure as to what kind of player he was. He turned out to be a rock solid, extremely loyal and well rounded player.   Pep held Keita in extremely high regards, according to Guillem Balague's book about Guardiola. Keita was an extraordinarily professional player, who always put the team first and never complained about not playing.   When he did play, he was rock solid. I don't remember a poor performance by Seydou. I wouldn't be surprised if he actually did have one or two bad matches, but in general he always performed well.   He added something different to our midfield. Very strong physically and with an unbelievable work rate, but he was also very good technically and last but not least, he was actually a threat in front of goal. His late runs into the penalty area were always a threat.  Looking on our current team, I really miss a type like Seydou. Just having this reliable and great guy in the squad, always ready to step in and provide whatever is needed of him, was a great luxury."
Barca,3a1993,Pek-Man,10,Tue Jun 16 13:34:49 2015 UTC,"I remember Seydou Keita saying something along the lines of ""Yea, Pep complimenting me all the time is great, but if he can turn those compliments into minutes on the pitch, that would be better."" He questioned why Pep gives him so much compliments but doesn't put him on the field."
Barca,3a1993,callmeWia,8,Tue Jun 16 15:42:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, I remember that as well. And I wouldn't be surprised at all, if Seydou actually was frustrated and annoyed with not playing as much as he probably could have at any other club. But he kept his mouth shut while he was at the club and he always put the team first.   I remember a great story about Seydou. I think I read it in Balague's book about Pep. A match was approaching and neither Abidal nor Dani Alves were available. Pep decided to play Puyol at his old position, as a right back, and chose Keita for the left back. Keita went to Pep and said: ""Don't play me in that position."" Naturally Pep was a bit perplexed because what kind of a footballer would ask his coach not to use him? Seydou continued: ""Look, I will do anything for you boss, but I have never played this position before. My teammates are going to suffer from it."" Pep considered Keita's words and decided that perhaps Keita was right after all. At the end of the day he decided to use Silvinho. The match was against Manchester United. In Rome. A Champions League final.  The point is that even if Keita was annoyed deep down inside, he still chose to put his own feelings aside for the good of the team."
Barca,3a1993,Pek-Man,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:54:23 2015 UTC,"Looking on our current team, I really miss a type like Seydou.    Adriano?"
Barca,3a1993,Casanova_de_Seingalt,23,Tue Jun 16 13:52:37 2015 UTC,"I think Adriano is a great guy and a good player, but he is nowhere near as consistent as Seydou was and unfortunately Adriano is injured far too often. It's a shame because I really like Adriano and he has had a couple of great seasons for us, especially back when Abi was ill and Adriano was scoring golazos left and right."
Barca,3a1993,Pek-Man,7,Tue Jun 16 13:58:00 2015 UTC,"How about Mascherano? He never complained when being benched, always there to help and give Barca what they need from him. Ee are talking about a guy who used to play as defensive midfielder and learned how to be a defender in Barca's style of game."
Barca,3a1993,Payuk,5,Tue Jun 16 15:13:03 2015 UTC,"I think Mascherano's definitely the best analogue in terms of reliability and attitude. Pep called Keita his moral compass, and I could see Lucho saying something similar about Masch (though less gushy - let's face it, Lucho's not that type)."
Barca,3a1993,egcg119,6,Tue Jun 16 21:18:26 2015 UTC,"Adriano is made of glass, Keita was a stone wall. Although, both do have a cannon for a shot when given some open space."

He knew he wasn't a regular starter and he accepted that, usually getting subbed in late in the second half, and from there the defense was much more stable. I adored him, he was getting older and Busquets practically plays every minute in that position now. He had a powerful left footed shot too."
Barca,3a1993,arijanbrkic,2,Tue Jun 16 20:52:29 2015 UTC,He was a utility man that could play multiple positions and had a knack for scoring. Sort of like Adriano.

Barca,3a1j1m,OriginalUsername30,3,Tue Jun 16 20:27:44 2015 UTC,You are right; in fact I prefer Kovacic over Gundogan and I know things look like Pogba will come to Barça but it might not happen as others are interested about him too; so Barça better be prepared for that. Pogba actually joined Juventus as free agent but how things have changed and he has now become the most wanted young talent for European clubs. Another similar case is Suarez. Quite controversial acts he had done during his stay at Liverpool but look how Liverpool still managed to squeeze out 90M Euro from us due to Suarez's talent.

State of the art stadiums, new hotels, the ability as a fan to actually go to more than one match on the same match day, players travel ease and training facilities. All these are tangible facts regarding the positives of the PLAYING of football in Qatar for the World Cup.   The negatives OBVIOUSLY are the political issues, the corruption, the human rights failures and so on, and.  Its like saying the US has the conditions for a great world cup but then getting pissed and saying ""ya man but damn the drone strikes, the invasion of Iraq in false pretense and vetoing allowing for the continued apartheid state policies of Israel etc""  The conditions to play arent related to others  And lets not hate too much on Xavi cause lets remember that Guardiola who some of us here look to as a demi god was one of the ambasssadors for the Qatar 2022 Bid, and nobody was saying that as a reason why we didnt want him back"

Barca,39zn95,nannulators,5,Tue Jun 16 13:55:22 2015 UTC,"This is dumb and clearly makes efforts to include at least one player from each of the top 5 teams. Busi was better than Krychowiak, Neymar was better than Griezman."
Barca,39zn95,Not_Tom_Brady,25,Tue Jun 16 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"First Griezmann undeservedly takes Messi's player of the month in January, now he somehow replaces Neymar despite having the same number of goals but less assists and worse stats across the board(I would also argue Neymar has been better in the big games). Unbelievable, really starting to dislike that fucker."
Barca,39zn95,MayIHaveAHug,41,Tue Jun 16 03:25:42 2015 UTC,But you have to admit that it was harder for Griezmann to score without having the assisting god that is Messi
Barca,39zn95,JustaFLEx,31,Tue Jun 16 04:26:05 2015 UTC,How is any of that Griezemann's fault lol....
Barca,39zn95,Kluey,-12,Tue Jun 16 05:06:27 2015 UTC,How is it Griezmann's fault that he had worse stats than neymar? That is literally only his fault.
Barca,39zn95,fareswheel65,11,Tue Jun 16 07:16:59 2015 UTC,"Well it isn't his fault he is getting awards he doesn't deserve , I just dislike anyone who gets special treatment because they don't play with Messi."
Barca,39zn95,MayIHaveAHug,6,Tue Jun 16 07:39:46 2015 UTC,Neymar deserved a place in this team.

Pep had a great midfield that dominated possession.  Lucho has a great attacking trio that takes teams by the throat.  It's an amazing shift !

Barca,39zq0u,mekane84,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"2011 side was superior to this side, it dominated game versus the best sides. You cannot say the same for this side."
Barca,39zq0u,ew123,2,Tue Jun 16 19:09:06 2015 UTC,"we were more dominant in some matches, but i'm not convinced we were any good at dealing with more defensive teams, i think it helps we played Madrid before Mourinho had them fully attuned to a more defensive style, and Man U was always an easy matchup for us.  We also nearly got knocked out by Arsenal and played a pretty easy Shaktar team.  We got knocked out by Inter the year before, Chelsea the year after, and lost to Madrid as well (they also beat us in Copa in 2011 don't forget).    This year we proved very good at dealing with defensive teams like Atletico, Real, and Juventus."

They are both pricks.  But you carry on telling people he's a saint, go on then."

Barca,3a19l8,IhateAngryBirds,0,Tue Jun 16 13:45:15 2015 UTC,ha for someone who is so caught up in restoring the dignity of the club you sure are willing to look past a LOT of unethical behaviour for the election of one specific candidate.  It's almost like there is no logic to it.
Barca,3a19l8,Pek-Man,4,Tue Jun 16 13:48:59 2015 UTC,"So you rather sit down and pretend Barca doesn't need a different candidate? Whoever my choice of President is irrelevant, I'm not a soci and can't vote, I just want to see a change from Qatar bullshit, a stop from all the fiscal problems, and a board that defends our players. And I just post these articles on here because to keep everyone informed of whats going on as not everyone here speaks Spanish. So if you don't like it, well.. downvote me and be on your way."
Barca,3a19l8,Pek-Man,-1,Tue Jun 16 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"we do need a different candidate, and with any luck the new president won't be named bartomeu OR laporta.  And pretty much everyone but bartomeu is running on getting rid of qatar so thats not even something to really worry about."
Barca,3a19l8,IhateAngryBirds,6,Tue Jun 16 14:02:48 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think that Laporta is a saint and frankly I don't give a shit. He can be as much of a prick as he wants to, as long as it doesn't hurt our club, which it clearly didn't last time Laporta was around. I only want what's best for the club and I don't think Bartomeu is a better president for this club than Laporta would be. It's as simple as that. At least for me."
Barca,3a19l8,Pek-Man,0,Tue Jun 16 13:38:48 2015 UTC,I don't think Bartomeu is a better president for this club than Laporta would be   There are more than two candidates.  I do not support nor like Bartomeu.  Nobody seems to understand either of those points.

Barca,39xcc7,nannulators,19,Tue Jun 16 13:57:05 2015 UTC,"I mean, I guess it's good that the club wants to keep him. But this doesn't mean much. With his €12m clause, if a club pays it, it doesn't matter if we want to sell him, we have no choice. In the end it's up to Marc himself, hopefully Enrique can talk to him and promise him a bigger role next year."
Barca,39xcc7,Aj16ay,3,Mon Jun 15 17:23:02 2015 UTC,"Yep, actually that Braida statement is a very good way to tell other clubs that they will need to pay the release clause to get him.   No negotiations needed and allowed."
Barca,39xcc7,mark1nhu,3,Mon Jun 15 17:25:32 2015 UTC,Apparently his agent said the buyout clause will go back up to 30m on July 1.   If someone tries to buy him I think we should force them to pay tax Bilbao style. With the transfer ban there is a greater need to keep our players than usual.

Barca,39wsms,Illegal_sal,32,Mon Jun 15 13:09:19 2015 UTC,We never get anything of the month. For God's sake Messi has never even gotten a player of the month. Wtf is that all about anyway...
Barca,39wsms,Marchisio,21,Mon Jun 15 13:41:07 2015 UTC,"Even more crazy: no Barcelona player has ever won it, unless you count Rakitic when he played for Sevilla.  I get that you can win titles with consistency just by being above average all the time, but that is not the case for us. We won the fucking treble in blazing style this year and Messi alone has been in a God-like form most of the season.  The award is meaningless to me when none of this is recognized. Messi doesn't need to sit on the award but the fact that he hasn't received it just undermines its purpose.  Might as well rename the award to 'Random Non-Barcelona La Liga Forward of the Month'"

Barca,39wsms,darthvader7888,3,Mon Jun 15 18:36:32 2015 UTC,"It's wierd, I think he deserves it, of course, he won the league. But at the same time, I feel there were better managers, like Nuno Espírito Santo, Marcelino García Toral and Javi Gracia, who were immense with less gifted squads. Not to mention Emery, again incredible."
Barca,39wsms,towerofmusic,8,Mon Jun 15 15:02:07 2015 UTC,"You could also say that with less gifted squads also comes less pressure, and with fewer stars there are fewer egos to try and manage.  Perhaps by way of example we look at David Moyes; was lauded when he was at everton but wilted under the pressure of old trafford.  Everybody can have their chic choice for a manager (god help me if I have to hear people circle jerk about Paco Jemez anymore) but a treble is a massive acheivement and it cannot be done without a good manager, and this is absolutely deserved."
Barca,39wsms,elanciano31,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"This isn't about the triplete, it's about the league. And in the league I felt these 3 in particular were more impressive than Luis Enrique. Valencia, Villareal and Málaga play good football and gave Barcelona quite a bit of trouble. And yes, I get your point, but there's still pressure in smaller teams, just a different kind of pressure."
Barca,39wsms,towerofmusic,5,Mon Jun 15 20:03:03 2015 UTC,"Winning the league while even being competitive in two other competitions would be impressive enough, which is why I bring up the other cups."

Barca,39yfbq,Chunky_mono,8,Mon Jun 15 20:26:57 2015 UTC,"It seems like Iniesta has atleast another year or two in him, no need to rush such an expensive transfer.   I don't see a problem with waiting... other midfielders will become available, and/or the hype around Pogba might die down."
Barca,39yfbq,CanadaCommie,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:51:48 2015 UTC,"Because if we don't buy him now, another team will. I'm pretty neutral about this, but we have to know that if we don't buy Pogba this summer he will probably be in Real Madrid squad for the next seasons, and we may regret it."
Barca,39yfbq,henrax,3,Tue Jun 16 10:57:47 2015 UTC,"I'm telling you, Pogba isn't worth it.  The recent inflation of transfer values is being exploited by Juve.  At this point there's always a ""best player on the market"" who's worth about 100m€.  Bear in mind we got Rakitic for 20m.  It'd be better if we saved our money.  We have young midfielders that are promising, and if those don't work out there'll be a midfielder on the market who's almost as good as Pogba for about a third of the price in a few years."

Pogba is popular but not sell a bajillion jerseys popular and he isn't an 80m pound player no matter which way you twist it, potential accounted as well. Barcelona already have the next Ballon winner after Messi on the team, they're fine"
Barca,39yfbq,efarfan,-1,Tue Jun 16 17:29:19 2015 UTC,"Let's do it. We'll have to buy two world class players to equal the quality of Pogba who has such a bright future. People say why not play La Masia players? Well when they are at the level of Pogba then they can play. Iniesta came in and was world class, Sergio Busquets was world class, Pedro was world class, Messi was world class, Xavi was world class.. if Sergi Roberto, Samper, Denis, Sandro, Munir aren't world class, je suis tres desole but Barcelona is a world class level team that requires that kind of players."
Barca,39yfbq,migueneitor,3,Tue Jun 16 01:53:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but that's just not true. Xavi spent years in the first team before he was world class. So did iniesta. Messi bursted into the first team with momentum, but even he wasn't played week in week out (Eto'o, Ronaldinho, Giuly, and even Larsson were). When Pedro first started getting minutes in the first team, nobody thought much of him, until the following season with Pep where he really got a place in the lineup. Out of the ones you mention, I would say only Busquets became a starter on his first year.  Barcelona has always been a club that believes in their youngsters, and this B team managed to get in promotion positions and was only relegated because of mismanagement. Samper, Adama, and Denis definitely have world class potential, but we'll never find out unless they play."

Barca,39wsmq,Dark-X,19,Mon Jun 15 13:09:18 2015 UTC,Interesting....  I figured we wouldn't want him in the 3rd division but maybe wouldn't get enough minutes on the first team so they'd load him out. Ajax fits our style of play perfectly as well so I'm certainly surprised. Guess he'll be the sub for Suarez. Now what's going to happen with Sandro...
Barca,39wsmq,Marchisio,10,Mon Jun 15 13:47:15 2015 UTC,"Didn't Bart say that we're also selling Douglas this summer? If we selling both of our RB subs then who will replace Dani when he's given time off or if he's injured? Adriano perhaps? This is only a problem for the first half of the season until Aleix Vidal is allowed to play in January.   Maybe loaning Munir to Ajax should be reconsidered. Messi, Neymar, and Suarez play almost every minute of every game. Pedro is a good substitute in case of injury or rest. He pretty much did it all last year so why not? There's also the possibility of giving Adama a chance to shine for the senior squad if we really need the depth but Munir should be loaned out to a top division team. Ajax are a great place for our young talents to develop since we have such a good history between the clubs and they pretty much have the same philosophy as us."
Barca,39wsmq,tonytetova,8,Mon Jun 15 14:06:46 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything regarding the sale of Douglas...  Also, we just brought in Vidal to replace Alves so Montoya is free to go.  Adriano is probably done here, he had an off season and I've read that he could go to Roma."

Barca,39x0xt,Illegal_sal,2,Mon Jun 15 14:22:40 2015 UTC,"Not forgotten to me. This season is as much his an anyone one else in the backroom staff who survived the Anoeta. People always credit Txiki with how he assembled the ""greatest team ever"" for that 2008-2011 period but refuse to give any credit to Zubi for his role.  Too many people on here dismiss Zubi as failed Sporting Director and forget that he's a club legend and the way he's been treated is tasteless. Imagine if in 15-20 years time people are berating Pique or a similar individual without thinking of what he achieved for the club.  Bravo Zubi, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did."
Barca,39x0xt,ViscaBarca1899,2,Mon Jun 15 19:53:59 2015 UTC,"He was a great player for the club but good grief he's been really horrible when it comes to signings. This season alone, despite signing Suarez, Rakitic, Bravo and ter Stegen, he managed to get Mathieu (which was good in hindsight, but still), Douglas and Vermaelen. These were NOT good deals. Lest not we forget how Thiago was handled, the inability to sign a defender for four seasons something, David Villa's fiasco, Ibrahimović's transfer... I mean the list can go on a bit longer than this, and I'm glad Zubi stepped up when we needed him the most, but I'm not really impressed and neither are many culés. There's a good reason behind that, too."

Barca,39wgqv,Illegal_sal,7,Mon Jun 15 10:44:00 2015 UTC,"If it happens, this contract is with Everton, but what happened if Everton decide to sell him to another club, let's say, end of 2016. Will the buy back option be still valid for 2017? Or Barca will be forced to either buy him first in 16 or lose him forever?"
Barca,39wgqv,Duke--Nukem,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:47:18 2015 UTC,"Not the same as Bojan at all. That was essentially a glorified loan, we were obligated to buy him back at the end of the deal if Roma didn't want him. There's no such thing here.  Dani Carvajal did this, Madrid sold him to Leverkusen and then he blew up big time. The advantage is that it makes the player commit more fully to the new team, since there's no guarantee he's coming back - one of Deulo's problems was supposedly not giving full commitment to Sevilla."
Barca,39wgqv,egcg119,2,Mon Jun 15 13:21:31 2015 UTC,"With a buy back clause, Everton is unlikely to sell him to another team, unless it's for less than than 3M, which at that point they would just as likely release him. Any deal for more than 3M would likely have Barca invoke their buy back (9M, minus the 6M already paid mean that his 'value' to Barca is 3M) and then sell him to the interested seller, in order for Barca to gain a larger profit."
Barca,39wgqv,BarcaJeremy4Gov,2,Mon Jun 15 15:19:46 2015 UTC,"If Everton receives an offer for him for.. Let's say, 15M. They will have to inform Barca who will most likely buy him back and sell him again to said club? I'm not even sure if FIFA regulations allow this kind of things because the buy back option is supposed to bring back the player not to speculate on his market value..   A related question: is the player forced to come back if the club activate his buy buy back option?"
Barca,39wgqv,Duke--Nukem,2,Mon Jun 15 15:12:58 2015 UTC,"I think (and don't quote me on this), IIRC from another similar deal, selling the player away carries a % to the original team, so selling Deulofeu for 10 Million would theoretically give Barca 3 million back (for example).   That would be my guess (in that situation, they could also buy him back before the purchase). Please note that buy-back clauses force the clubs to negotiate, but the player can still say no. So if Deulofeu does not want to return, he won't."
Barca,39wgqv,ManoloBar,2,Mon Jun 15 16:35:43 2015 UTC,I am sure there is something that mentiones that in the deal.

Barca,39wgqv,MuhamedBesic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:42:28 2015 UTC,"I love that we grabbed him so low, and the most official source reporting on this (sky sports) says that there is a two-year minimum for  the buy back  clause to take effect. Honestly, if Deulofeu gets good enough that you guys want to pay for him again, then he must have helped us get some sort of silverware. If he doesn't pan out and you guys don't want him back, we could still sell him to a newly promoted team for quite a bit of money. Player wise, everybody on /r/everton is excited about this deal. The kid played very well for us, and will no doubt be first-team choice. He is still a tad selfish with his playing style, but there were times last year that he helped move the ball around, and those were the games where we could literally beat anyone we wanted to (Man. Utd comes to mind)."
Barca,39wgqv,elanciano31,3,Tue Jun 16 07:04:21 2015 UTC,Honestly don't know what to make of this guy but maybe he can turn his attitude problems around and we can take advantage of the buy back clause (if it is true).

When we buy him back in 2017 Everton would've made 100%. How much are we gonna sell him for in 2017 if he's not part of the team? 14M? I don't know. I'd rather sell him now for more without option to buy back. Or continue loaning him out. I love buy back options but not like this."
Barca,39wgqv,egcg119,5,Mon Jun 15 11:28:27 2015 UTC,"I love buy back options but not like this.   Then like what? Original fee has to be low enough to be realistic and get clubs to buy. Let's be real, Deulo's been a fringe player at two medium-size clubs, and his enormous potential has been bogged down with issues. 6m is a fair price for him. And then for the buyback to work, Everton need to make money off the deal, otherwise it's just a loan, really."
Barca,39wgqv,kezorN,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:05:43 2015 UTC,"otherwise it's just a loan, really   That's the point, we could easily loan him out to another club, you can't tell me that no other club on or around Evertons level don't want to loan a player as talented as Deulofeu, so this is either a) paying millions to loan a seriously talented player out, or b) selling a seriously talented player for fucking peanuts."
Barca,39wgqv,egcg119,2,Mon Jun 15 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"He didn't want a loan and we don't want a loan. Has to be sold.   You say he's incredibly talented, but that's all potential - and he has not improved as a player in 2 years. If he plays like a 6m player and acts like a 6m player, then maybe he is a 6m player."
Barca,39wgqv,kezorN,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"Talent is talent, he is incredibly talented already, the potential is the bonus - and his talent is worth more than 6m in this market. The potential just adds to that price, since a buying club could end up with a world class player (when he starts playing more for the team, and less for himself). Had he come from Porto's academy, Porto would have gotten at least 5 times that amount for him.   Also when did he himself and the club say that they didn't want a loan? (but at the same time do want to pay Everton for what is essentially a loan - or just a transfer, a poor one)."
Barca,39wgqv,wwatermelon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:32:30 2015 UTC,10M with buy back at 12M seems more realistic imo
Barca,39wgqv,Aj16ay,0,Mon Jun 15 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"If he comes good in 2 years, it would basically be like paying Everton €6m to develop him. That'd be completely worth it"
Barca,39wgqv,egcg119,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:16:13 2015 UTC,"Deulofeu was a super-sub at Everton, a fringe player at Sevilla, and what potential he has is being weighed down by two years worth of attitude problems.  Say we asked for 10m. His current level isn't worth it, and with the buyback clause, Everton have little to gain if he really explodes and reaches his potential level. So why risk it, from their point of view? Or if we ask for 10m as a starting point, maybe they'd ask for 20m as a buy-back in 2017. Not worth it.  The priority is getting him to a club where he'll succeed, a mid-table club with a good manager, not making money.  If he succeeds, great. If he fails, we made 6m off a failed youth talent, which is decent."

We were way better than they in that match, but we suffered a own goal from our highly criticized DM and a late goal from Raul in a counter attack.   Our LB, Felipe, bossed the whole match.   I cried like a baby because it was our centenary year and we already were Libertadores champions in the same year.   Real Madrid just ruined the dream and I developed a huge hate against them, the reason why I started to follow the centenary Barcelona in 1999."

Barca,39xx7q,henrax,3,Mon Jun 15 18:20:24 2015 UTC,we really need to do give our youngsters some opportunity. They need to be played in rotation to get a sense of position and permanence for future seasons. And it's more important now since we have a lot of promising players ready to be played.

Barca,39xx7q,TimeFingers,3,Tue Jun 16 06:10:37 2015 UTC,"I want him, mostly because we will surely regret in the future if we don't sign him.  I don't want us doing the same mistake we did with Xavi replacement.  On the other hand, I think Barça should really put efforts in lowering the total cost of transaction, specially his insanely wages."

Barca,39xx7q,ir7425,2,Mon Jun 15 19:02:05 2015 UTC,"If we sign him, great.  If not, not a problem.  For me, competition is good and I think Rafinha and Samper would benefit rotating with him.  I think Sergi Roberto should be sold.  Problem is if you spend upwards of 80 million on a player you're pressured to play him a lot.  Though Lucho is tough and could very well stick to rotations in midfield, especially because he has faith in Rafinha.    Iniesta is going to need a replacement sadly.  I would rather see Samper molded into a cm role, but we shouldn't complain if we sign Pogba.  We are a big club and we do make big signings.  Though we shouldn't ignore this generation of la masia talent.  I think either way we're going to be an unbelievably talented team for a while."
Barca,39xx7q,elbossohogo,2,Mon Jun 15 19:49:38 2015 UTC,"When Iniesta will be 32 Rafinha and Denis Suarez should be crucial players while Samper and Halilovic should be getting more minutes as well. Pogba will take away minutes from our youth players for the next 8+ years, I'm not ok with that."

Barca,39u1qm,Deep_In_Thought,23,Sun Jun 14 19:45:41 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on each:  Bartra needs to become a starter next year. Mascherano/Mathieu/Vermaelen are all past 30 and to be honest Bartra has performed better than all but Masche.   Montoya isn't going to start anytime soon, after resigning Alves and buying Vidal. He should leave this summer or in January.   Munir and Sandro both have the potential to become great players. I'm hesitant to say they should be loaned because loans haven't really worked well for Barca youngsters recently (sans Rafinha). I think with work though they could both play important roles, especially Munir.   Roberto probably won't ever be a starter for Barcelona. For his sake he should probably leave or go on loan soon, but I wouldn't be unhappy to keep him given that he's a decent rotation option.   Samper is the future of the midfield and should join for next season. Busquets is still relatively young but in the long run Samper should replace him."
Barca,39u1qm,aleks19998,3,Sun Jun 14 21:11:17 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this about Bartra since the start of last season. Yes, Mascherano is great but he won't be around for much longer. Bartra-Pique needs to be the starting CB pair.  I think we should keep Montoya until January. Then let him do whatever he wises.  I personally rate Sandro higher than Munir. Sandro should be promoted to provide forward depth alongside Pedrito, and Munir should be loaned to a midtable side, preferably in the EPL (to bulk up) or if possible, Bundesliga.  Roberto is a nice substitute to have on the bench. Yeah he's probably never going to be a legend in midfield, but that's okay. Not every player we have needs to be a superstar. Like you said, rotation option.  Samper should be promoted. Midfield is the one (relatively) weak spot in our squad, with Iniesta's age being a factor."
Barca,39u1qm,YoSoyMilkChocolate,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:12:45 2015 UTC,"I think Munir has better potential to succeed at Barcelona, Sandro's great as well but Munir's more technical, better passer (in my opinion)"
Barca,39u1qm,aleks19998,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:34:24 2015 UTC,"I agree about Barta.  About Montoya, I wouldn't mind keeping him until January but we should be fine if we sell him. We should be okay until January, Bartra while not the best option can play RB (as I said, not the best option but just to make it through until january) and we can also use Pedrito as RWB.  I also prefer Sandro, having him and Pedro as subs for the attack would be great.  We should keep Sergi Roberto until January to have depth."
Barca,39u1qm,polechi33,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:59:33 2015 UTC,He'll probably go loaned to Sevilla in the end like everyone else. That team looks like the mid-stop between Barça B and the main team lately.
Barca,39u1qm,iagolima,2,Mon Jun 15 13:59:16 2015 UTC,"Samper-Busquets situation similar to Iniesta-Xavi earlier their career. Two similar midfielders, the manager has to brave to field out how they will work together. Once Samper-Busquets can be fit together, our midfield is set for another 7-8 years."
Barca,39u1qm,ir7425,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:26:08 2015 UTC,I think Munir should stay because I think he has the potential to be a more technical player while Sandro seems more like an all out forward. And we should keep Montoya until Vidal comes in the summer just so that dani has a backup in case of injury. But once Vidal is here he should leave
Barca,39u1qm,TR1L0GYxx,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:47:51 2015 UTC,"I'd keep him until January when Vidal can actually play, if he leaves in the summer our backup to an ageing Alves is Douglas"
Barca,39u1qm,aleks19998,0,Mon Jun 15 04:50:21 2015 UTC,Agree with every single one there
Barca,39u1qm,Aj16ay,3,Mon Jun 15 02:21:00 2015 UTC,"This season it was okay for Luis Enrique not to think in the long term, but go for short term success. Understandable, since he needed  to win the confidence of the board, the fans, the players themselves. Especially after the happenings at Anoeta.   This season hopefully he will have more confidence in his youth players, focusing on the long term. Getting Bartra to become a true starter is priority. We have no other young defenders currently lined up and even Piqué is not the youngest anymore. After Bartra comes Edgar Ié and him reaching the first team is far, far from certain. He needs to work on a lot.   Samper to me seems to be the player that absolutely does not need a loan to another team. He looks to be the type of player that could flawlessly adapt to any level thrown at him. Other than that, he breaths Barça's midfield football. Playing him in another team could possibly even harm his development.   I'm disappointed in how Montoya's development has been going since he joined the first team. There was a reason why he was the main starter for the Spanish youth teams over for example Carvajal. His time at the club is up. Especially now with Aleix joining the team. I'm sad for him, but hopefully he can pick up his career at another good club.  Munir is Luis Enrique's favourite and if you've seen him play in the 2013/2014 season you'd understand why. His intelligence on and off the ball exceeds that of Sandro, Sanabria and Dongou. It is extremely likely that he'll join the first team next summer. I'm confident in his abilities to do succeed.  A loan to Celta or Rayo Vallecano would probably be best for Sandro. He had a very rough season at Barça, after impressing at the first team. Arguably a great substitute for Suárez though: physically strong, hard working, good pressure. I think Lucho favours Munir though.  Sergi Roberto is a good utility player to keep at the club, but that depends on his personal wishes. Lucho loves him and Sergi loves the club, but he's not playing nearly enough and with Samper joining he might be surpassed by him soon enough as well."
Barca,39u1qm,jklz,2,Mon Jun 15 10:07:39 2015 UTC,"Montoya and Roberto should leave for the sake of their respective careers. Bartra should start alongside Pique more often. Loan out MUnir and Sandro to a lower team, like we did with Rafinha."
Barca,39u1qm,j33sizzle,2,Mon Jun 15 01:35:31 2015 UTC,"Montoya has to go, we have no space for him. I wish him well, I have notthing against him. We should keep Roberto until January, then he can go. I also hope Barta plays more."
Barca,39u1qm,polechi33,2,Mon Jun 15 01:55:03 2015 UTC,"Montoya.- I think he is okay, but not Barca quality. Thank's for your service, I wish you well. We can sell him and be okay until January with Alves and Barta (while not the greatest option,  we can just use him ot get through until January) as RBs and Pedrito as RWB.  Douglas.- He should be loan, not because I think he has a future with us, but because hopefully he plays decent and increases his price. We can sell him next summer an get some of the 5.5 mi, we paid for him, back.   Bartra.- He was to stay, hopefully Lucho talks to him. I think he is our future, so he needs a bigger role. Related to this, I think Masche should only be used as a backup for Busquets. This way there would be more playing chances for Bartra, Mathieu and Vermaelen (specially for Bartra)  Adriano.- This could go  either way, we can keep him one more year or we can sell him and use Grimaldo and Mathieu as subs for Alba. I am fine with either option, it just depends on what Lucho thinks is best.  Sergi Roberto.- He is adecent player, he did an okay job as CDM, but he is not Barca quality. Having said this, we  lack depth after Xavi's departure and due to the FIFA ban we cannot get a proper replacement, so we should keep Sergi Roberto until January. Hopefully we get a midfielder by then, and if that happens we can let Roberto go.  Sandro.- I rate him higher than Munir, I think we should give him a spot on the first team. With him an Pedrito as subs, we would be set on the attack.  *Munir.- Should go on loan.  *Halilovic.- Should go on loan.  *Samper.- Should go on loan.  *Adama.- Should go on loan.  *Grimaldo.- Should go on loan, ife he doesn't join the first team.  *Deulofeu.- Should go on loan (hopefully and once for all he can fix his behavoir).  Denis Suarez.- Should stay on loan, due to the ban he wouldn't be able to play until January. So it would be no good for his developtment to  not play for half a year.  Song.- He needs to be sold.  *We seriously need to make a better job at loaning our players. They need to go to lesser team, so they have more chances to play nontheless those teams need to have a good playing style. In Spain I like Celta de Vigo and Rayo Vallecano. Outside of Spain we could send them to Ajax, Everton, or Southhampton (These teams play good football, but I am not very sure about these options) I would really prefer Celta or Rayo (Sevilla is a nice option, but we should just send there players who have had already 1-2 seasons of successful loans)."
Barca,39u1qm,polechi33,2,Mon Jun 15 02:34:29 2015 UTC,I agree with almost all except for I think Samper and Munir should stay. Munir as a backup attacker in case of injury and Samper because in my opinion is already better than roberto.
Barca,39u1qm,TR1L0GYxx,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:42:37 2015 UTC,"How good is Samper as CM? In my book I have him as CDM only, that is why I was thinking about loaning him (we have Busquets and Mascherano in that position right now) But if he can play CM, I guess you are right, he should be better than Sergi Roberto.  Also, I was thinking that Sandro should be the one who stays because besides that I think he is better than Munir, he is a ST while Munir is a winger. We already have Pedrito as a backup for the wings, so we need a guy like Sandro."

There is honestly no reason for Barca to sell for 4m, it's ridiculous and actually borderline disrespectful. It's like bidding 40m for Messi (and actually expecting Barca to sell).

Bartra should get high priority but it isn't the time to replace Mascherano.  I got down-voted for stating this (so I deleted my comment) but I still believe that Bartra's buy-out clause fallen to 12M Euro means other European clubs are lurking around to hit the jackpot (in today's transfer market 12M Euro won't get any decent defender and here Bartra's transfer fee being that low means serious injustice to his talent) and bringing Mathieu caused this whole problem with Bartra. I don't hate him but I think he just doesn't go well with Barça (I feel insecure when he has the ball)."
Barca,39sy0m,Football_Enthusiast,4,Sun Jun 14 20:50:24 2015 UTC,I am apparently the minority here but I have really never been impressed with Bartra's performances.

Barca,39sy0m,Brompton_Cocktail,21,Sun Jun 14 13:42:57 2015 UTC,I think selling him is a problem. We shouldn't have bought Verm and bartra should be playing more games but we're so stacked and coach prefers Matthieu

Additionally I think 12M Euro for Bartra is too cheap so Bayern will try their best to fetch Bartra."
Barca,39raki,Football_Enthusiast,4,Sun Jun 14 15:00:38 2015 UTC,Umm... Benatia?
Barca,39raki,darthvader7888,2,Sun Jun 14 15:41:52 2015 UTC,Oh I totally forgot about him. However as far as I can remember Benatia did miss some matches with Bayern in the last season (he didn't pick up too serious injuries but he missed few games in '14-'15 season) so Bartra might be used to cover Benatia's absence too if Bayern bring Bartra.   I don't think Bartra will get enough playing time at Bayern; I hope Barça just sell Mathieu and focus more on Bartra. Mascherano is 31 this year so I think it is the right time pay attention to our young CB.

Barca,39raki,NinjaTigerPoo,3,Sun Jun 14 20:14:55 2015 UTC,"Thiago didn't have the patience and the love for Barça to stay with us. He thought that with Pep leaving, Barça wouldn't be the same, he wouldn't develop as well without him and decided to go. I don't agree, but I understand him. Bartra, however, is a different case. He has shown his love for Barça, has seen that this team has much more to come, and I'm pretty sure Lucho plans on using him more next season. So I don't think he'll leave, but this shouldn't even have become a problem in the first place, apparently Thiago wasn't a good enough lesson."
Barca,39raki,iagolima,4,Sun Jun 14 05:19:22 2015 UTC,Fucking hell. Why are we so bad at doing business? Real values their players damn well and knows how to market them. I mean freaking Di Maria for ~60M. And we are dumb enough to let two massive talents slip from our hands.
Barca,39raki,Micste,22,Sun Jun 14 00:30:47 2015 UTC,"Fucking hell. Why are we so bad at doing business?   We got rakitic, ter stegen, bravo, Suarez etc last season and won the treble. We're not bad at doing business, we just prioritized winning over bringing up new talent this year. If the league wasn't so close he would've got more games...  You can't have everything, stop being such an alarmist"
Barca,39raki,Neezzyy,6,Sun Jun 14 01:41:00 2015 UTC,"although i mostly agree, weve had a terrible track record of selling players. buying them is one thing, were barca and teams know we have the cash, but weve lacked in selling players.   i think what doesnt help that is probably the lack of opportunity for the players we sell to increase their value in the first team when we have such a star studded line up. alexis went for a decent price at 30-35 million pounds, could have gone for more though if di maria went for around 60 mil. and fabregas also went for cheap, but him underachieving at barca and burning out every second half of the season didnt help his price. nonetheless cesc is a world class midfielder who went for a not-so world class price at 27 mil pounds. thats cheap especially to a money club like chelsea, plain old poor selling business in zubi and the club. a little long ago but yaya went for only 20 mil pounds and he was one of the best dm in the game. but we also had busquets come up so it didnt hurt too much.   tl;dr. can only do so much as barca when buying players, as teams will demand absurd prices. but selling players we have sucked ie. alexis, cesc, yaya, etc.  one more thing, the board kicked absolute ass this past summer, i was happy about each signing (except for king douglas of course) and we did a good job of getting rid of and replacing players, so no matter what, things worked out and we dominated the season. visca barca visca catalunya!"
Barca,39raki,smash-smash-SUHMASH,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:36:59 2015 UTC,"nonetheless cesc is a world class midfielder who went for a not-so world class price at 27 mil pounds. thats cheap especially to a money club like chelsea   We can only get what someone is willing to offer. Arsenal had first option to buy him and they turned it down, they probably weren't the only club interested either. Fabregas is a great player, but his stint with us didn't do too much to increase his value. Di Maria on the otherhand was super hyped, coming off a champions league win. Also, i think it speaks more to Manchester United's tendency to massively overpay and Real Madrid's ability to extract maximum value in this case.  We sell players for lower amounts, but we also let them go to the team they want. We dont price every team out of a deal. Think about the teams our players go to; Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Bayern FC (Thiago) instead of Monaco, fenerbache, Zenit etc. It has to make it easier to sign players knowing that they will be allowed to leave to a decent team when theyre deemed surplus to requirements.  That's my 2c on it anyway. Sure we could get a little bit more money for our players, but doing the right thing by them isnt the worst thing in the world."
Barca,39raki,Neezzyy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:56:55 2015 UTC,"i would mosty agree, certainly we arent selling to zenit, but were also not selling to small teams, not to mention all the money the english clubs have. at the end of the day, cesc is worth more than 27£m. some clubs know how to sell and others dont, i think were one of those ones that dont unfortunately, but we are much stronger in other areas such as masia and our ability to get players to want to play here. my point is no club is perfect, we arent good at selling and thats just part of our club dna lately"

Very versatile and reads the game quickly. He is left footed with great passing range and looks a bit like a young Yaya Touré and can be used anywhere in the midfield, but I quite like him as an interior. Right now he's playing as a right winger or CAM depending on what Fluminense needs. He has a bit of an ego problem, can be a bit of a prima donna and had a falling out with former brazilian u20 coach Alexandre Gallo. But he is seventeen, remember that, loads of space to grow.  Gabriel is an 18 year old center forward, scored 21 goals last season, Santos leading goalscorer. He's being played out of position since Ricardo Oliveira (ex-Bétis and Valencia) came this season, his game is suffering because of it. Scored a goal earliar this week as a center forward.  Kenedy is Gersón teammate in Flu's first team, he is a winger, pacey, and had a good state championship. I rate him as a step or two below Gersón. Was called to the u20 World Cup, but got injured and is currently recovering. I'd like to see more of him."

Barca,39sp8p,Aj16ay,0,Mon Jun 15 01:41:29 2015 UTC,"Romero   Zabaleta --- Garay -- Otamendi --- Rojo                Mascherano        Banega     ---     Pereyra  Messi    ---    Tévez    ---   Pastore   To me that would be the best XI possible, Banega - Pastore both need to play but lack constistency to be alone in the midfield. Di Maria takes way too much space in the team compared to what he actually brings during the games, so he should be on the bench as well."

Its always fascinating to hear the behind the scenes improvements that players make to benefit their game on the field.  The only question I have is: does barcelona NOT have an in house nutritionist? How was messi able to get away with eating pizzas etc for the past ~8 years?  I know the club has chefs that prepare food when the team is on the road etc but...why did messi have to go to someone outside the club for nutrition advice?
Barca,39pnh5,NWAgh,8,Sat Jun 13 16:52:02 2015 UTC,"Barça have a nutritionist, like any other club in the world, but it's impossible to have control about what players eat in their own houses.   And Messi was not eating pizzas for the past 8 years. He in fact lived in a strict diet during all Pep and Tito's time.  For some reason he was ""reckless"" in 2013/2014, but thanks to football gods he had a wake up call."
Barca,39pnh5,mark1nhu,8,Sat Jun 13 19:34:24 2015 UTC,So when he said he had problems off the pitch he meant he couldn't stop eating pizza?   JK
Barca,39pnh5,_FRANKENSTEIN_,2,Sat Jun 13 19:56:20 2015 UTC,"Probably other problems draining his motivation, wich led him to skip the diet too many times."
Barca,39pnh5,mark1nhu,2,Sat Jun 13 21:15:54 2015 UTC,They prepare food at home a lot. Especially out of season and between matches. I think the main point for Messi was to never eat pasta anymore. This is a personal advice for Messi and it proved to work well. :)

Not only they lost the title of ""champions of Europe"" but they lost it to US!   Now the media in their build up to games, previews and reviews, we will be called The Reigning European Champions."
Barca,39pecb,Duke--Nukem,4,Sat Jun 13 14:46:39 2015 UTC,"For as ""vulnerable"" as people say this midfield is, no one was able to stop it this season. IMO the 2015 squad would have a very good shout against the 2011 squad because the gap between the 2015 attack and 2011 attack is greater than the gap between 2015 midfield and 2011 midfield."

Barca,39pecb,holocarst,-5,Sun Jun 14 14:12:50 2015 UTC,"The article does ring true on many levels. I haven't been a Barca fan for long, just for the last 5 years or so.  This Barca side admittedly won't any midfield battles. I feel quite uncomfortable relying on our attack and defense forces only.   Rakitic, IMO, isn't as threatening, or as commanding as Xavi was. But then again, we never expected him to be. He was brought in to be physical, and play the perfect long ball, and take the occasional long shot.   This leaves the Iniesta position. Honestly speaking, Iniesta is my favorite player of all time. But I think a player like Rafinha, or even Pogba would help us a lot, if either of them played for us as much as he does. If Rakitic doesn't improve to fit our style even more, then I fear we will become extremely dependent on our attack, which to me isn't the Barca way.  I seriously hope for more Rafinha next season. He seems like a player who could make life either hell, or heaven for us."
Barca,39pecb,BrownieSniper,11,Sat Jun 13 15:14:11 2015 UTC,No one can ever replace Xavi but Rak did a damn good job in his first year.  It's not easy having to control the midfield and cover for Alves when he bombs forward. Rak has succeeded were many superstar player's have struggled. Give the man some credit. He scored the first goal to win us the CL!
Barca,39pecb,BrownieSniper,-4,Sat Jun 13 15:54:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's my point. I never said Rakitic's job was to replace Xavi. I'm not sure anyone can, at this point.   I'm hoping that we just have a better midfield duo next season, even if its just improved versions of our current setup."
Barca,39pecb,elanciano31,7,Sat Jun 13 15:58:40 2015 UTC,We won't have a better midfield duo next season. We are banned from buying players.  Why change the midfield that won us the treble? Rak has earned his place. No need to go out and buy a superstar like Pogba.
Barca,39pecb,BrownieSniper,8,Sat Jun 13 16:08:23 2015 UTC,"Team wins treble, beating the reigning champion of FOUR major European leagues in the way.....""b b but the midfield wasn't good enough!!!!""   People have no grasp on reality. And they need to stop talking."
Barca,39pecb,XsTream23,3,Sat Jun 13 16:35:03 2015 UTC,"By a better midfield duo, my point was that I hope Rakitic gets even better. Not necessarily to go out and buy Pogba.   If you also notice, I said that we should allow Rafinha more time, and that he gets better as well.   None of my comments, in any way at all, were aimed at calling Rakitic insufficient, or crap. He's an amazing midfielder. It's just that I felt that the current midfield isn't at the same level as what it was like before, and I hope it gets back to the same level. Which is pretty hard to do."
Barca,39pecb,BrownieSniper,4,Sat Jun 13 17:12:53 2015 UTC,"i honestly don't get you  people /and surprisingly enough, even Barca fans think we have a weak midfield just because our attack is stellar and our defense stepped up.  Let's see our ""weak"" midfield that helped us won the treble with some amazing Goals/Performances.  Busquets!  probably the best defensive midfielder in the world, his creativity and awareness is fantastic.   Rakitic, a hard worker that managed to integrate withing the squad so fast and brought some physicality that was missing from us in the past years. Plus needlessly to say that his technique and passing was very good especialyl for his first year here at Barca.   Iniesta , while its true that took him awhile to get back in form due to some slight changes in formation and making him a more hard working player rather than playmaker as in past he still managed to produce some amazing runs and passes (i mean the Man got the MOTM in the CL final and that run VS PSG still stays in my mind)   Xavi, our veteran , Maestro, capable of dictating the tempo of the game and creating chances after chances, chameleon eyes as Ray would say.  didn't even mention the ""weak"" players such as Rafinha .   Still thinking we have ""weak"" midfield?"

It's one thing for a Real Madrid fan to boo him at an El Clasico but it's another when you boo him when he's representing your country because for that game he is no longer a player just for Barca but a soldier to defend the Spanish honor of Soccer
Barca,39nq39,T_Peg,5,Sat Jun 13 04:38:26 2015 UTC,Thats the point. As a Legia Warsaw fan i was booing the fuck out of Milik when he scored 2 on us and knocked out of Europa.  But when hes playing on NT im going to cheer as much my lungs and throat can handle. NT should be above club hating

Barca,39nq39,canuck1701,8,Sat Jun 13 08:23:26 2015 UTC,Yes. And every single goal scored by Spain that tournament on their way to the trophy was by a Barca player.

Barca,39nq39,Fdetak,3,Sat Jun 13 12:35:47 2015 UTC,Idk I don't rate community shield as being anything close to an actual cup run since its just one pre season match. It's like saying supercopa + CL + league is a treble. Technically yes but not really a proper treble of 3 major trophies.

And he won treble twice as of yet but nothing to be worried I hope Barça will win another treble and Pique will be a part of that success too.

Every site referred Sport, I didn't find these quotes in Sport at all:   ""He should seriously think about how he acts [in the future]. I understand people's attitudes to his [rainbow flick] against Athletic Bilbao in the Copa [del Rey]. Some saw it as a lack of respect.""   In the Sport interview, Xavi talked about only the incident on victory parade. I didn't find saying him anything about Bilbao match."
Barca,39p34n,ir7425,10,Sat Jun 13 11:32:39 2015 UTC,This Eurosport article has more quotes on the incident and also on Neymar dribble against Bilbao. Why I shoved Neymar   I personally think that Xavi should have skipped criticizing Neymar about the Bilbao match.
Barca,39p34n,Duke--Nukem,11,Sat Jun 13 14:32:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Even if that's how he feels, comments can get taken out of context to say he dislikes Ney or something. Just because he left doesn't mean he should start airing out personal team conflicting comments. He should also reflect and see how things can look. I love Xavi and Ney but I feel that Xavi should have kept quiet regarding that. And I stand by my thought that Ney did nothing wrong. Step into this millennium people."

Barca,39p34n,ir7425,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:14:15 2015 UTC,They are referencing an interview with a Qatari newspaper called Sport. I couldn't find any link either.
Barca,39p34n,Duke--Nukem,2,Sat Jun 13 16:33:34 2015 UTC,"Don't know if there's any Qatari newspaper called Sport or not. Because Xavi talked about Neymar incident on victory parade on spanish newspaper Sport, not Qatari newspaper as Eurosport article wrote.   The other quotes on Bilbao match also Marca reported citing spanish newspaper Sport, not Qatari one.   If there's any Qatari newspaper named Sport, then it's tricky that Xavi had two interviews with two different newspaper with same name in same day - last tuesday.   If a site[Eurosport one] referred two interview event in same report, that's something noisy."
Barca,39p34n,ir7425,2,Sat Jun 13 17:01:32 2015 UTC,"Messi nutmegs opponents for breakfast, dinner and lunch. And we love every single second of it. Even opponents just laugh it off and get on with it.   Neymar does it and all hell breaks loose. Before I say anything else, I'll set the record straight, I'm no big fan of Neymar. Even in the Holy Trinity, I put him third to Messi and Suarez.   But, in the Copa Del Ray final, what everyone else calls showboating, I'll just call it his creativity. He thought he could pull it off and he went for it. If the defender thought he could have stopped it, he should have instead of pulling him down.  Neymar might have even succeeded if he hadn't been pushed. Might have even missed the whole thing. But, we'll never know cuz he didn't get to complete it, thanks to an irate Bilbao defender who was frustrated at how the game was going. I see people moaning and groaning about his showboating but I don't hear anyone complain about the Bilbao players pseudo-slapping him, mocking him and pushing on him when he was down on the ground.   Big respect for Neymar for playing it cool and just walking off, could have been much more ugly had he retaliated.   He shouldn't listen to anyone, he should do what he does best. If he bruises a few egos along the ways, so be it. Stifling a player's creativity so he doesn't ruffle a few feathers is wrong on so many levels.   I see nothing wrong with what Neymar did, but what the Bilbao players did.. That's a whole different story altogether."

Barca,39p34n,Neezzyy,3,Sat Jun 13 11:22:27 2015 UTC,Neymar is a star in his own right.  Since when do we discourage players from exhibiting the peak their skills allow them to? What a fucking sad world we live in when we let sore-losers dictate our player's actions.  Soon we'll be telling messi not to nutmeg defenders or chip keepers because it's bad sportsmanship. Crying because a player made you look shit is bad sportsmanship

Barca,39mkno,PanchDog,2,Sat Jun 13 12:41:01 2015 UTC,"It's mainly because there are so many elderly people who have reserved (no pun intended) seats - they don't tend to be very rowdy. Also doesn't help the atmosphere that Barca's ultras are banned from Camp Nou. So it's mostly ""family people"" there - and while they can be just as big fans as ultras, they are definitely more quiet.  Sometimes it's a shame, I agree, but it's also part of what Barca is."

I've read somewhere that in Spain football is more family oriented sports and most fans attend the matches with their family, relatives or friends and this is why in Spain presence of many elderly people, women and even kids are common scenes in the matches.  I'm not that rowdy myself but I'd love to see our stadium crowd presence like Bundesliga (BVB)/Premier League (MU) but anyways our fans are still really great, they are passionate towards football and very loyal to Barça."

Barca,39nn7x,MindeyeRust,3,Sat Jun 13 14:59:12 2015 UTC,"If Barca do want to make more significant signings, it shouldn't be a problem now that the club isn't paying the wages of Xavi, and also since Alves supposedly took a pay-cut.  Pogba has all the talent in the world, but don't think he is worth close to 100M, as what's rumored."
Barca,39nn7x,lonestar_10,3,Sat Jun 13 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"Player worth is a weird thing. Its all based on what someones valuation of someone else is. In the market of Gareth Bale going for over 100M, and David Luiz going for over 50M, Pogba could easily go for upwards of 80M Euro.

Barca,39nn7x,FrostyGrass,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:54:37 2015 UTC,"I'm the article you went into detail about an understudy for Suarez. Does La Masia have any promising true strikers besides Sandro. I don't include Munir because he seems and plays more a winger role, although his finishing is quite class from what I see and have heard. Also do you believe either could actually get to a level close to Suarez or better than Pedro for Munir's sake."
Barca,39nn7x,egcg119,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:12:14 2015 UTC,"Munir's not a winger, but he's more of like a Villa or a false 9, not a pressing/hold-up true striker.

Barca,39nn7x,ChinggisKhagan,3,Sat Jun 13 16:51:23 2015 UTC,it needs another good midfielder. Rafinha and Denis Suarez (in the second half) are not good enough if Iniesta or Rakitic gets injured. Not replacing the role Xavi played last season would be a recipe for disaster. It would be similar to how a single Modric injury could hurt Real Madrid so much this season.
Barca,39nn7x,egcg119,7,Sat Jun 13 07:23:49 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting Samper, who has Xavi's awareness and sense of play, if not the exact position. We can either play some sort of double pivot with him and Busi, or move him farther up into midfield in a pinch.  If there's an injury in a big game and you don't want to trust youngsters there are a variety of options. Masch-Busquets-Rakitic midfield, or Masch-Busquets-Messi with Pedro, Vidal or another forward wide.  We have enough experience, we have enough talent to make things work. To rush and buy an overpriced midfielder now or in January without giving three ABSURDLY talented youngsters a shot is against everything the club stands for."
Barca,39nn7x,ChinggisKhagan,0,Sat Jun 13 14:45:56 2015 UTC,None of the options are even close to being good enough. Rafinha and Denis Suarez are far from good enough to be regulars yet and probably never will be. Samper has a couple cup games so far. Mascherano-Busquets together is far below Busquets and the other two.  This is the stuff the can lose you a league title.
Barca,39nn7x,egcg119,2,Sat Jun 13 14:51:12 2015 UTC,So what's your solution then? Buy a cup-tied player in January for an exorbitant amount of money for 6 months of a campaign?
Barca,39nn7x,ChinggisKhagan,2,Sat Jun 13 15:14:49 2015 UTC,"Buy Gündogan today so you'll not end up desperately needing someone in January. It's probably what's going to happen too if this election isnt too much of a distraction.  It's not optimal, but with the ban it's the best solution."
Barca,39nn7x,FrostyGrass,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:23:59 2015 UTC,"He's not the answer and imo from watching him play, especially in the second half of this season, is not much better then Rafinha. Rafinha has shown he can be class and as good as his brother. The main downside to that is he doesn't often get enough playing time, which he now will hopefully.   All of this is my opinion  from what I saw of him play and I did not have the opportunity to see him play every game unfortunately. But Rafinha has all the ability to be better then Rakitic."
Barca,39nn7x,UsernameAlreadyUsed,7,Sat Jun 13 22:09:07 2015 UTC,"Xavi was not a starter this season. Modric was. Not having Xavi available won't hurt as anywhere as much as it did Madrid having to form a line-up without Modric.  So, no, it wouldn't be a disaster."
Barca,39nn7x,ChinggisKhagan,6,Sat Jun 13 09:20:30 2015 UTC,That's not what Im writing either.  Im not saying Xavi leaving is the same as a Modric injury. Im saying Barca will be as vulnerable to a Iniesta or Rakitic injury as Real Madrid were to a Modric or Kroos injury.
Barca,39nn7x,UsernameAlreadyUsed,3,Sat Jun 13 12:13:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, that I get. Still, I don't really agree... The reason Madrid didn't click without Modric was that they didn't have any player who could bring what he did. That's not really the case in our midfield. We've seen Rafinha start or get subbed on for both Iniesta and Rakitic quite often and it didn't change the overall dynamic too much. If Busquets was out, we'd have Mascherano. Hell, even S.Roberto did well in that role. Madrid don't have that. Loads of attack-minded players, but none that can hold it all together."
Barca,39nn7x,justafanpassingby,6,Sat Jun 13 12:23:21 2015 UTC,"Modric injury didn't hurt them,not having faith in subs hampered them."
Barca,39nn7x,ChinggisKhagan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:25:22 2015 UTC,the subs werent good enough. that's what hurt them. go watch Khedira in the 4-0 loss or Illarra away against Celta and tell me anyone should have faith in them. they were just not at all close to being up to the standard.
Barca,39nn7x,justafanpassingby,3,Sat Jun 13 07:29:30 2015 UTC,"You need time on the pitch to play good ,you suddenly throw them on the pitch.and you expect them to perform world class"
Barca,39nn7x,ChinggisKhagan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:37:16 2015 UTC,they just arent/werent good enough. nothing could change that. they both got far more time than they should have had. they could have played from now and until 2030 and nothing would have changed.
Barca,39nn7x,justafanpassingby,3,Sat Jun 13 07:43:43 2015 UTC,"Illara,Khedira and Isco all are good players, but Carlo was afraid to rotate and didn't do anything to motivate them. He played Bale even he is out of form and CR7 and benched isco and tactically incompetent.In his 2 season at real only big team he completely dominated is Bayern.And also he didn't have like to like subs .So Modric injury affected Real Madrid.  But Denis and Rafinha are good backup in case Iniesta and rakitic got injured."
Barca,39nn7x,ChinggisKhagan,3,Sat Jun 13 08:40:28 2015 UTC,It's silly blaming Ancelotti for players that are just not good enough.  Lets leave Isco out of it because he's actually good and played the 6th most of any Real Madrid player last season. It's just not his position.  Illarra played 1500 minutes (he played more than Rafinha). That's a lot of minutes. He was tried so many times and he just never looked right. He got plenty of chances.  It's unrealistic to think he would have been much better if he had just played more and you cant expect Andelotti to give him more minutes when he just isnt performing.
Barca,39nn7x,justafanpassingby,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:27:29 2015 UTC,"If you keep him playing out of position, how can he perform."
Barca,39nn7x,ChinggisKhagan,3,Sat Jun 13 12:52:25 2015 UTC,Illarremendi? He basically only played central midfielder. Between La Liga and the CL he started all his 12 games as a central midfielder. He was substituted in 25 times where I doubt he played much else either.
Barca,39nn7x,j33sizzle,10,Sat Jun 13 13:00:07 2015 UTC,Kovacic!!1!

Barca,39nn7x,ShotgunToothpaste,3,Sat Jun 13 12:50:10 2015 UTC,"If Zlatan leaves, Verratti may see that as a lack of ambition from PSG and want to leave to challenge for CL, which PSG would likely struggle in w/o Zlatan's creative and goalscoring output."
Barca,39nn7x,robc95,2,Sat Jun 13 15:23:15 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but at times in the champions league this season (unfortunately I don't watch a lot of Ligue 1 so I can't comment on that) I felt that PSG were actually a better team without Ibra dictating the attacking play."
Barca,39nn7x,mark1nhu,2,Sat Jun 13 18:25:53 2015 UTC,"This.  In my view, PSG will show a lot of ambition if just get rid of Zlatan and sign a great replacement with the correct attitude.  Zlatan is indeed a great player, but that team needs a completely different mindset to win CL."

Barca,39nn7x,gblr,4,Sat Jun 13 07:36:53 2015 UTC,"It means there are more rumors linking pogba to barca than any other CM's.

Barca,39nn7x,A_Kind_Shark,3,Sat Jun 13 08:07:46 2015 UTC,"I posted this earlier but I'll post it again for visibility.  I think if we are to repeat UCL glory again and retain our league title we need to do something different from the previous season. There's a reason no one has repeated as UCL winners. In my opinion, Bartra has to be the full-time starter this upcoming season. Mascherano is already in his 30's and we can't keep denying a 24 year old his place in the first team. He's earned it.  I also believe ter Stegen should be the full time GK in the league.  He needs full time experience if he's to become one of the best keepers for the next 10-15 years. Give MAtS the league, Bravo the CDR, and rotate UCL based on form (give MAtS the spot to start with, though).  IMO this should be our full strength lineup:  GK ter Stegen  RB Aleix Vidal (Alves for the first part of the season, needs to be phased out sooner or later)  CB Pique  CB Marc Bartra  LB Jordi Alba  DM Sergio Busquets  CM Rakitic  CM Iniesta (give Rafinha more minutes though, as we phase Iniesta out)  FW Messi  FW Suarez  FW Neymar  P.S. Does anyone know where I can buy a Barcelona treble winners shirt for this season? I NEED ONE OF THEM SO BADLY"
Barca,39nn7x,Icarium_lifestealer,4,Sat Jun 13 19:56:09 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer we rather use the players from La Masia than go out and buy new ones. There's a lot of talent in Munir, Grimaldo, Sandro, Denis Suarez, etc. Also, the money we'd save could be used to help the players or the club. If I had to choose a player to sign, it'd be Isco although I don't think it would happen."
Barca,39nn7x,Morcule,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:53:16 2015 UTC,"Sell - Montoya, Deulofeu and Song;   Loan - Halilovic, Adama and Sandro;   Promote - Munir and Samper  Grimaldo should be played with B team and get occasional starts for the first team, then next season we can sell adriano and promote grimaldo. Out of munir and sandro one should stay and other should go on loan.. lucho's choice. We can get Denis back from loan if we have doubts about playing Samper at CM.   Sign - Kovacic for 2016-17 season.  What do you guys think?   Edit: If bartra can play at RB too then we should sell Adriano and promote Grimaldo."
Barca,39nn7x,Icarium_lifestealer,6,Sat Jun 13 07:44:19 2015 UTC,"Adriano has already proved this season that he's not good enough for Barcelona. He should be sold, and Grimaldo, one of the best players for Barca B, should not waste his time in Segunda B, and get promoted asap."
Barca,39nn7x,Morcule,2,Sat Jun 13 11:53:14 2015 UTC,The problem is if we sell adriano we will have no backup for RB until January. If bartra can play there then definitely we should sell him and promote grimaldo.
Barca,39nn7x,Icarium_lifestealer,2,Sat Jun 13 12:05:40 2015 UTC,"Good point. Maybe Montoya will be convinced, like he always does. I can't even count how many times that he's been ''confirmed'' to leave, and ended up staying."
Barca,39nn7x,Football_Enthusiast,2,Sat Jun 13 12:20:11 2015 UTC,"Lucho doesn't rate montoya at all. If not this season he will definitely leave next season. I think monty will also want to leave, so it could happen. Inter are still interested i think."
Barca,39nn7x,Icarium_lifestealer,2,Sat Jun 13 12:24:22 2015 UTC,"Montoya and Song probably won't get any playing time so they should be sold, I'm not sure what to do with Deulofeu.  I say Grimaldo should play in our first team, he is just too good to play in Segunda Division B. Samper should be promoted too. Munir has already been promoted to our first team.    I don't follow Serie A but what I've watched and heard from others, Kovacic seems to be a good fit; I'd go for Pogba but his inflatable transfer fee irritates me a lot (pretty sure Juventus are expecting roughly 100M otherwise no way Barça's shocking 80M Euro offer would get rejected, which I still believe is very high for a young talent, even for Pogba).  But rumors are going that Liverpool already signed Kovacic."
Barca,39nn7x,Football_Enthusiast,2,Sat Jun 13 10:40:55 2015 UTC,"Even i think Grimaldo is a great talent but i just want him to have constant playing that is it. If we don't sell Adriano he might not get a chance. But if we do sell Adriano who will be the backup for dani until January? If lucho sees bartra can play RB then sell adriano and promote grimaldo right away.  I hope kovacic won't move to liverpool, he is a great fit for us and much cheaper than pogba."
Barca,39nn7x,Icarium_lifestealer,2,Sat Jun 13 12:03:44 2015 UTC,"I think Grimaldo will need some time to get accustomed to our first team and the La Liga environment in general but it is also important to see whether he gets proper playing time here.   I don't know is this just rumor or the truth, but several sources are claiming that Liverpool sealed this deal. I wouldn't mind Pogba coming to Barça but not at the price Juventus are asking for him."
Barca,39nn7x,mess12k,3,Sat Jun 13 12:27:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah we will see... not in our hands anyway. We are just keyboard warriors. I really like grimaldo, hope he can make it barca and lucho should take proper decision on how to develop him."

I think it’d be impossible to replace Sergio because he’s so good, he’s a midfielder made for this team. The difference between my football and his is that Sergio is more positional, he holds his position well and that makes our play more fluid. I try to make the team more physical, to be more on the lookout for ways to help others. That doesn’t mean we can’t play together, we’re very different central midfielders and Sergi’s style is much more suited to the way FC Barcelona play than mine.”"

Piqué is not a mentally weak player that will be affected by some boos even/especially if that happened when playing with the National team.   I watched the game. He was taking pleasure from boos, keeping the ball for as long as he could, made runs towards the box in order to score and  played a great game.   If he's really said that, it might be just to put pressure on the coach/Spanish FA because it is unacceptable that a players gets booed while playing for the National team, at home."
Barca,39mogs,Duke--Nukem,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:42:03 2015 UTC,"If Pique leaves the Spanish National Team, which I don't see happening, will not be because of those boos from the crowd. He doesn't seem the kind to care about those reactions.      But if he does decide to leave the national team behind and move on, so be it. It's his decision and his alone. I can respect that."

Barca,39l8zg,choss,8,Fri Jun 12 17:05:40 2015 UTC,Well he is not playing Copa America so he will get a well deserved rest. We will need him when the season starts since Messi and Neymar would need more time to rest.

I know Ronaldo only played one season at Barcelona, but it was one of his best seasons and one of the best ever for a forward in Spain pre-Cristiano and Messi.   And to those saying Suarez and Neymar, the point of an all-time XI isn't the ones with best chemistry, though I agree that what sets MSN apart from all other trios is how seamlessly they play together. The point is to pick the best players while still keeping the team theoretically a little balanced.  Also hurts me to leave out Dani Alves, but it's hard to play a RB without a LB on the other side, and I don't think Abidal or Alba deserve to take some of these legends out. The true Cruyffist way would be to play Alves in the back three, cause who needs defense anyway but that just seems a bit too crazy."
Barca,39kihv,egcg119,4,Fri Jun 12 13:50:37 2015 UTC,"Cruyff - Kubala - Messi  Iniesta - Busquets - Xavi  Abidal - Puyol - Koeman - Alves  Valdes  It's really difficult because there are some players better than the ones I put, but they didn't play that long in Barcelona (Ronaldo, Maradona). Maybe it could be argued that Laudrup should be instead of Xavi or Iniesta, Ronaldinho instead of Cruyff or Eto'o instead of Kubala."

I honestly wouldn't want any other RB. Not Lahm, not Ivanovic. Alves going up the pitch is better than most wingers. His Chemistry with Messi is dazzling. Not only that but I feel comfortable with Alves playing fullback. He consistently plays well against Cristiano.  CB: Puyol What else can I say? He's a god on the pitch.  CB: Koeman Pique deserves this spot but I'm putting Koeman for his goal against Sampdoria in 1992. In a couple of years Pique should have this spot locked down.   LB: Abidal This position is a toss up really, I could put Alba or even move Ferrer over. As the same with Pique Alba will have this position in a few years.  CM Trio: Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta Best midfield trio of all time. They represented two dynasties in the sport. Alternatively I could put Guardiola, Cruyff, Laudrup.  RW: Messi Best player of all-time and he still has 7-8+ years of playing. I can't describe how incredibly lucky we are to have him.  ST and LW: Suarez and Neymar Now this might be a bit controversial but I put them here because with Messi, they are the best front three I've seen. They can adapt to any team and they're chemistry is amazing considering the fact that they were given a year to gel. Individually you could put Ronaldinho, Romario, Eto'o, Kubala, Stoichkov..

Barca,39kihv,domi_28,4,Fri Jun 12 15:18:24 2015 UTC,"As someone who picked the current trident, I am serious (but I really did not intend to offend with such a seemingly ""amateurish"" pick). But here's a reason why I did so. Even though it's a discussion of best XI (which is kind of pointless in itself when the players drift apart more than just a few generations), player chemistry should also be taken into consideration. A measure of team chemistry would be titles won for example. The problem I see with just a purely talent based list is that it becomes too much of an abstract amalgamation of big names and what ifs. I mean long story short, I could have gone with Zubi Alves Koeman Pique Ferrer Guardiola Cruyff Maradona Messi Ronaldo Romario (Stoichkov Neeskens) but then you have just a mutant list with half the players who did not even play with each other for an extended period of time. I chose the list based on achievements together and future potential. That is why I don't include Ronaldo and the like. He simply did not stay long enough, and from watching him play since 1995 or so, I do not believe that his playing style would have noticeably improved what we have here. I say this with some regret because I rate him pretty close to the upper echelons of number 9s.  So all in all, sorry for my lack of proper explanation and coming across like a recent newbie fan. There was no intent to seem ""amateurish"" in the eyes of some seasoned veterans and long time fans. But I've been watching this sport for quite some time now and my list does leave out a few of my more ""personally favorite"" Barca players; that's just one way I can affirm the list is somewhat fair.  A more quick explanation would involve the squad of 2011 that won the UCL final. There was a previous thread like this and I answered with that team. The chemistry of that team was great, I just chose to update/upgrade it with the likes of Alba Neymar and Suarez.  I like seeing people's various choices and trying to understand why, and usually I can see why they would select a certain player. There is no absolute answer and I guess that's the fun part of it.  Just a note on Neymar: I understand why people say Ronaldinho was so much better, but I also think people don't give Neymar the credit he deserves because he seems ""small"" next to Messi. Who wouldn't though. After all's been said and done I do believe Neymar will be in the history books for ages (based on records/statistics/years of watching him play (eye test) and the gap won't be as great between him and the four Brazilian R's. Even right now at national level, he is certainly well on course to beat Ronaldo for 2nd all time Brazilian scores and way ahead of Ronaldinho (adjust for positional differences however you want).  TL;DR : Call it what you want"

Barca,39jiaj,JKapIsClueless,6,Fri Jun 12 04:14:38 2015 UTC,Hypothetically who do you think bartra would join if the barca can't hold on to him?
Barca,39jiaj,Sirtron16,7,Fri Jun 12 07:36:30 2015 UTC,"Plenty of teams would be after him for 12M, that's an absolute steal for someone his age and with his ability."
Barca,39jiaj,robc95,4,Fri Jun 12 12:19:49 2015 UTC,Some English team might go for it
Barca,39jiaj,choss,2,Fri Jun 12 09:54:31 2015 UTC,I hope this is like the Messi situation (in which he followed Chelsea etc in order to indirectly threaten the board). I don't want him to leave.
Barca,39jiaj,RayMedia,2,Fri Jun 12 10:57:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not a scout nor professional soccer player or coach...but Bartra was always one of the subs that I never thought ""oh crap I hope he doesn't screw this up."" I'd even have been comfortable having him in big matches. Hell there was a time when Pique was goofing around last fall that I thought Bartra might actually be the safer choice. We will definitely regret it if we let him walk."
Barca,39jiaj,LedZepGuy,2,Fri Jun 12 17:06:19 2015 UTC,"For his sake he should leave. For our sake he should stay. Hmm, this is a tough one."
Barca,39jiaj,alterpsyche,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:24:40 2015 UTC,"This is the moment for Lucho to step in. He's not stupid, he knows Bartra is an important player for Barça's future. It's his time to have a talk with him and let him know he's needed and that he'll be used more often next season. Show him that he's important. The buyout clause is not definitive, the player can decline a transfer, so it's (not solely, but mainly) Lucho's job to convince him to do so. (And hopefully have Messi have the same talk with him he had with Alves)"
Barca,39jiaj,iagolima,4,Fri Jun 12 12:37:45 2015 UTC,It's not really Mathieu's fault. Also he has helped won key matches in set pieces.
Barca,39jiaj,choss,3,Fri Jun 12 07:11:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry. Dunno what happened I just wrote that on impulse, going back and reading it made me realize that it was ridiculous. It's just that Bartra is a very dear character to me, and the thought of losing him to any other club worried me"
Barca,39jiaj,invice,-8,Fri Jun 12 09:55:43 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks again, Zubizarreta. He left months ago, still fucks with Barça."
Barca,39jiaj,frasier_crane,5,Fri Jun 12 11:43:45 2015 UTC,What?
Barca,39jiaj,vooglie,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:04:49 2015 UTC,"It's Thiago's situation again. Thanks to Zubizarreta, Bayern signed the best young midfielder in Europe for almost nothing. Guardiola is still thanking Zubizarreta every morning when he wakes up in Munich and sees what he ""stole"" from Barça. Now Bartra, one of the best young defenders in Europe, may be sold too, for 12M and that is a gift to any club like ManU, PSG, Bayern, etc. Go to Europe and see the prices they are paying and you'll realize there are worse players than Bartra being sold for more than 40M. Remember Barça paid 20M for Mathieu, a 31 y/o defender who had never even been international (thanks for that too, Zubi) or another 20M for Vermaelen, who has watched all season from his plasma TV at home just like me. And we might see Bartra leave for just 12M."
Barca,39jiaj,frasier_crane,3,Fri Jun 12 08:05:45 2015 UTC,"These sort of clauses are not added by the club, they're added by the players party. It's the player protecting their own interests.  So could people stop bashing the board and Zubi for things that were not their doing just because it's fits the ""Fuck the board"" agenda, its just naive."
Barca,39jiaj,viscabarca99,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:16:10 2015 UTC,"It's the players' agents duty to do so, but it's the Director of Football's duty to not acept it or not accept a price so below the market price. I can't blame Bartra/Thiago nor their agents for suggesting that price, but I can blame Zubizarreta for not protecting Barça's best interests."
Barca,39jiaj,frasier_crane,2,Fri Jun 12 09:17:58 2015 UTC,And what if Thiago/Bartra stated that they wouldn't sign the contract unless said clause was included? Then you'd blame Zubi for not getting a deal done.
Barca,39jiaj,ViscaBarca1899,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:27:23 2015 UTC,"Everything is negotiable in football. Negotiate that clause and make it bigger in exchange for more bonus, higher salary, etc. Based on the signings Zubi made, (Mathieu 20M, Douglas 5M, Vermaelen 20M...) I don't think Zubi's negotiation skills are the best."
Barca,39jiaj,frasier_crane,2,Fri Jun 12 09:47:47 2015 UTC,"If Zubi says no, then they don't sign and then people would still complain about it. If there is someone to point the finger here is the coach because he is the one that distributes the minutes among players."
Barca,39jiaj,choss,0,Fri Jun 12 10:25:07 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt Zubi's negotiation skills based on the prices paid for Douglas, Vermaelen or Mathieu so it's not that he had to refuse the clause but to make it bigger and give something in exchange, be it a higher salary, bonus for matches, etc."

Barca,39kh9s,HoboChique,10,Fri Jun 12 17:27:02 2015 UTC,"Very fond of the guy, but I'd sell him for 25m+. Another season behind the big three will push his transfer value down further, and his spot in the rotation can be used to blood the youngsters."

Barca,39h3s8,nesgoth,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:43:21 2015 UTC,Clarence Seedorf.  Won two with Milan and one each with real Madrid and Ajax.  However if we include the Era before the champions league was established then Maldini Jr.  has five and there are probably also a lot of real Madrid players from the 1950s that also have five as they won five in a row.   Edit: Francisco Gento has the most with six.

Players and teams joke around and say such comments especially when they are playing the best player of all time and one of the best teams in recent history while having this huge gap in talent between them. Players already knew what the situation was, they saw Depo's president crying in the stands, if they wanted to ""take it easy"" they wouldn't need Lopo's comments to do so.

Barca,39geb0,El_Barca,-7,Thu Jun 11 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"I find it incredibly confusing and strange. You have to win la liga or spanish cup to get to the copa del rey. You have to win the UCL to participate in both the european supercup and club world cup. So how on earth can those be regarded as next season?  And not only that, but the champion's league qualification is based on the last UCL and the placing in the league last season. But somehow winning la liga this year and the UCL this years count as the same season and it can be called a treble.  I find those rules incredibly strange, I just don't get it. Does this mean that if we win the 2 supercups and the club world cup it doesn't count as a one season sextuple?"
Barca,39geb0,Phantomchrism,8,Thu Jun 11 16:41:43 2015 UTC,Copa Del Rey is the Spanish Cup

Barca,39geb0,henrax,3,Thu Jun 11 22:47:05 2015 UTC,"Sextuple is for the calendar year. In general they are probably not counted for the previous season because the team which plays those finals could be a different team from the one that qualified for them.

Barca,39gbp4,cdn_brcafan,16,Thu Jun 11 16:31:36 2015 UTC,Argentina got some really good talents coming up but they tend not to use them that much. I thought in Copa they would include at least one of Dybala/Icardi/Vietto and Rulli (GK) but strange that all of them have been ruled out.  I'm also hoping to see Argentina win this Copa America.
Barca,39gbp4,cdn_brcafan,6,Thu Jun 11 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"I would have liked to see some of the youth as well, but it could be that Tata doesn't want to mess too much from the WC team that got them to the finals. I'm guessing he'll experiment with them over future friendlies.  Personally I'm hoping with a fit squad we see a more explosive Argentina with more attacking."
Barca,39gbp4,robc95,8,Thu Jun 11 18:40:14 2015 UTC,I just hope this time Argentina don't screw up and it is so good to see Tevez is back to the team. Hopefully Argentina will win this year's Copa America.
Barca,39gbp4,klkklk,4,Thu Jun 11 18:56:13 2015 UTC,Imagine if Tevez and Aguëro had been playing in the final in their current form instead of Higuain and Palacio last summer!
Barca,39gbp4,ohpuic,2,Fri Jun 12 13:07:35 2015 UTC,Tevez alone would have ended the match before extra time and Argentina would win the WC '14 and Messi wouldn't shed a single tear drop.  Damn you Higuain and Palacio!!
Barca,39gbp4,rjkeats,3,Fri Jun 12 13:14:43 2015 UTC,Damn Higuain and Palacio!!
Barca,39gbp4,Phantomchrism,11,Mon Jun 15 02:19:37 2015 UTC,"Not ours any more, but it is always a pleasure to watch Sanchez."
Barca,39gbp4,somethingcool-1,3,Fri Jun 12 01:08:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Every time I see him play it strikes me how perfectly suited his game was for Barcelona. In the EPL, his dribbling and close ball control was head and shoulders above other players. I wish him all the best."
Barca,39gbp4,domi_28,12,Sat Jun 13 13:13:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's interesting to see Messi's and Neymar's Copa America performance in the light of the next ballon d'or. Up to now it should be a no-brainer that Messi should get it even if Argentina doesn't win, but perhaps Neymar does stand a chance if Brazil wins and he does a good job.  I can't possibly immagine Ronaldo or anyone else standing a chance this year, but it will be interesting!"
Barca,39gbp4,MindeyeRust,20,Thu Jun 11 15:33:26 2015 UTC,"Don't think he does regardless of the Copa. Might get second ahead of Ronaldo but I honestly think this years stand-out performer has easily been Messi. Easily. Neymar has bagged more than the occasional goal and that is all well and good but judging on overall performances, he hasn't even been near Messi."
Barca,39gbp4,Chillidawg,5,Thu Jun 11 18:38:33 2015 UTC,"You are right, up until now the next Ballon d'Or is pretty much leaned towards Messi but if Brazil win this tournament then Neymar will have a chance to be in the top 2 for sure."
Barca,39gbp4,InAnIndianAccent,7,Thu Jun 11 15:55:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but the addition of Dani has made me extra excited for Copa, I'm hearing he could play at midfield which would be very interesting."
Barca,39gbp4,MindeyeRust,11,Thu Jun 11 15:18:13 2015 UTC,I feel like there will be a face-off between Argentina and Brazil in this tournament.
Barca,39gbp4,domi_28,7,Thu Jun 11 15:55:51 2015 UTC,I want an Argentina Brazil final SO BAD!
Barca,39gbp4,brocccoli,2,Thu Jun 11 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"Yes! And the Barca players score in that final too would be so nice. Messi scores 4, Macherano scores 1, Neymar scores 3, Alves scores 1. Argentina 5 - 4 Brazil. The dream"
Barca,39gbp4,IhateAngryBirds,10,Fri Jun 12 10:20:48 2015 UTC,"Sounds more like fantasy. I'd be alright with a 1-1 (Aguero 4', Neymar 26') till the 80th minute where Messi scores and Argentina win it 2-1. Messi hugs Neymar and Alves. David Luiz makes that face he makes. Masche takes off his shirt."

Barca,39gbp4,TheCornholio66,4,Thu Jun 11 17:39:56 2015 UTC,I wish FIFA would reduce his punishment. But anyways Suarez needs some rest and he was battered enough in the UCL final so this rest is needed for him.

Barca,39gbp4,CorsarioNero,3,Thu Jun 18 13:35:25 2015 UTC,"Only thing I can think of is that Dunga is not a bright man. Remember, Dani Alves was barely called up at the last minute.   This is nothing new. Brasil was shit under Big Phil but that was mostly masked by Neymar's individual skill. Diego Alves still is inexplicably not selected as their #1. Fred starts games for them.

Not to mention coaching a national side is far more difficult a prospect than a club side, given the lack of accessibility to players. Argentina is also in a world class tournament, playing some of the best teams in the world. It's not the time for any coach to start imposing his play style on a team.

Barca,39i62p,rocksteadybebop,6,Thu Jun 11 23:55:20 2015 UTC,"Yep. RM fans. As stupid as they get.  But I loved Piqué's reaction. When he received the ball he kept it at his feet as long as he could; he was enjoying those whistles. Great attitude. It was his way of saying ""R U MAD ?""  Also, during the last 10 minutes or so he made 3 or 4 runs carrying the ball from the back to the attack; he wanted to score a goal !! Unfortunately, the crosses never came. And he had a great game."
Barca,39i62p,Duke--Nukem,45,Fri Jun 12 10:03:47 2015 UTC,"Well there are definitely less Barca-sympathising people amongst the fans of the Spanish national team, than there are Real-sympathising fans.   But other than that I think it's pretty pathetic to whistle at your own national team player, especially when he's in great form. Clubs and national teams are different things, but clearly Real-fans don't understand this.  But then again, they're used to whistling/booing their own players, even club legends, so I guess it makes sense."

Barca,39gims,ksalama,3,Fri Jun 12 13:18:00 2015 UTC,Well he did buy mascherano if im not mistaken...I cant remember if Mascherano was Zubi or Laporta right before leaving
Barca,39gims,alterpsyche,2,Thu Jun 11 19:39:19 2015 UTC,It was Zubi.
Barca,39gims,alterpsyche,8,Thu Jun 11 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"I have explained this before, so let me do it again. It is an unbelievably prevalent myth that it took Zubi 3 years to buy a CB.   Firstly, as mentioned before, he bought Mascherano. You could argue that he was bought as a holding mid, but he ended up being one of our best CBs ever.  Secondly, his job is not to buy whatever fans require. His job is to fulfill the coaches needs and wishes. Considering this, let us look at what were those needs.   Pep (during Zubis term) never required pure CB, only a defensive mid who could play as one. He got Mashe. Zubi did his job well. Tito wanted a CB, but only a Thiago Silva (this was later confirmed, I dont remember by who, but it was legit). Zubi did everything he could, but PSG wouldn't sell him. Tito later stated that they could do just fine with Pique, Puyol, Masche and Batra. Only due to injuries we tried Song and Adriano as CBs that season. Not an ideal season defensively, but Zubi could do nothing about it. Tata is an interesting case. He came on short notice, without any plans (obviously) and so he asked Zubi and others to have some time with the squad to get to know its strengths and weaknesses. He did not want to buy any player during summer(Neymar came one month before Tata). It was expected that there will be some transfers during winter and major reconstruction during next summer but Tata decided in december that he will not continue so it was decided that no players will be bought before new manager will be appointed. Again, not an ideal season defensively, but Zubi was asked not to sign any new player, so not his fault. Again.    In summer, when new Lucho was named manager, Zubi delivered what was asked of him except for RB. But was he really needed this season?"
Barca,39gims,Zaratthustra,2,Thu Jun 11 21:05:32 2015 UTC,If Laporta win the Presidency i hope he brings back Andoni.
Barca,39gims,darthvader7888,0,Thu Jun 11 22:39:32 2015 UTC,Nah. He was a legend as a player but he wasn't that good as a sporting director. It's a shame really. Hope Puyol does a better job if he comes in and doesn't ruin his reputation like Zubi did.
Barca,39gims,henrax,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:45:29 2015 UTC,"Of course he should feel part of this, he has clearly a role in the treble. I mean, even I feel part of it and I didn't do shit :)"
Barca,39gims,darthvader7888,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:46:06 2015 UTC,He deserves credit for the last transfer window but I still wouldn't want him back.
Barca,39gbck,ekandler,38,Thu Jun 11 15:08:31 2015 UTC,"He'll never be our starting RB, that's why we just signed Aleix VIdal.  Montoya is gone for sure this summer, only question is where. Adriano will probably stay until January."
Barca,39gbck,egcg119,11,Thu Jun 11 15:30:33 2015 UTC,"Adriano's agent apparently was meeting in Italy with people form Roma. If he leaves as well as Montoya, we should be okay for four months."
Barca,39gbck,polechi33,12,Thu Jun 11 15:47:59 2015 UTC,We would not be okay man. Vidal can't play till January due to the transfer ban and so we will have only Dani as a RB. Any injury would definitely fuck us over
Barca,39gbck,invice,12,Thu Jun 11 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"This might sound crazy, but Douglas might be OK at filling in for the easier games until January. If Dani gets injured then we are screwed though."
Barca,39gbck,bricebru22,-4,Thu Jun 11 17:53:38 2015 UTC,"Can't trust Douglas. I would not like him in place of dani as a regular  Edit: Why the down votes? Does anyone really think that Douglas could live up to Dani? I know that he can't be utter shit, but do you want him against C. Ronaldo, or Robben or Cavani or Griezmann and co.? And what if we get a super hard cl group? Do you want Douglas against the top wingers?"
Barca,39gbck,invice,10,Thu Jun 11 18:49:47 2015 UTC,"He won't be a regular just a backup and then we have Bartra that could also challenge for play time. Could be a blessing in disguise to have a CB playing RB, while Alba pushes forward we'd still have 3 at the back and no need for Busi to keep going right to cover."
Barca,39gbck,mrnoor,3,Thu Jun 11 19:31:19 2015 UTC,Fine by me. I just meant that a real RB would be better as that would mean Bartra would have to play mainly as a cb and if he plays brilliantly he might become a starter

Barca,39gbck,invice,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:10:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah probably haha. But if Dani got injured and Montoya got sold, Adriano would probably sit at RB and we'd have Grimaldo or someone to take his spot on the bench."

Is just that Douglas as the back up number one is not fine by me, but apparently many people here like him for that role. My whole argument is based on the fact that we would not be left with anyone good if Montoya and Adriano both leave. If anyone of them stays, I don't have a problem"
Barca,39gbck,invice,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:03:17 2015 UTC,"I know, but I'm talking worse case scenario. I would easily take Douglas as backup until January if Montoya/Adriano were to leave. I doubt they'd leave until after our ban anyway."
Barca,39gbck,McButtTasty,6,Mon Jun 15 12:14:43 2015 UTC,"Bartra would be serviceable out there, but not ideal"
Barca,39gbck,ncocca,2,Thu Jun 11 17:19:09 2015 UTC,"Yup, we also have Barta. Until December we only have Liga and the group stage of the Champions, so we should be fine."
Barca,39gbck,polechi33,2,Thu Jun 11 18:00:42 2015 UTC,I would prefer if we made Bartra into a good cb sub coming on to substitute our main cbs. I love the guy and he has a bright future at cb. Don't want him to become some sort of multi tool kit
Barca,39gbck,invice,2,Thu Jun 11 18:48:58 2015 UTC,"We would have Bartra, and Pedro who can play RWB. I know that they are not the most awesome options, but until December we only have la Liga and the group stage of Champions, so we should be able to make it through."

Barca,39gbck,vanNostrandby,3,Thu Jun 11 19:41:36 2015 UTC,"Grimaldo is primarily a left back and not ambidextrous as far as I know. In the case that he is capable to play on the right, forgive my ignorance"
Barca,39gbck,invice,2,Thu Jun 11 20:37:49 2015 UTC,I thought he was able to play there but not as well but I might very well be mistaken as I'm not that familiar with him.
Barca,39gbck,vanNostrandby,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"I have personally never seen him play there. Have seen him in midfield, as a left winger, as a '10' and at left back.  I didn't catch every single youth game he played, but I've never heard someone talk about him as a right back before."
Barca,39gbck,jklz,21,Thu Jun 11 23:04:20 2015 UTC,"probably because Douglas is immovable, Dani is staying for two years and we just signed Aleix Vidal."
Barca,39gbck,domi_28,0,Thu Jun 11 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"Douglas is not immovable. Hes immovable to a top club, but he is good enough to play on plenty of teams."
Barca,39gbck,FCB_TB,2,Thu Jun 11 21:04:59 2015 UTC,"I never like to bad mouth one of our own, but Douglas' nick name at his former club was ""the blind"" and he wasn't even rated in the Br league. The only way he would be off the squad is if we pay his contract out and tell him to seek a team because it will be really hard getting a penny for him."
Barca,39gbck,domi_28,13,Thu Jun 11 21:58:08 2015 UTC,Marca is reporting Sevilla want to replace Vidal with Montoya.  His definitely on the move this summer http://www.marca.com/en/2015/06/10/en/football/spanish_football/1433953639.html?cid=SMBOSO34503&s_kw=twitterCM&t=517131480=Twitter
Barca,39gbck,Illegal_sal,2,Thu Jun 11 15:24:19 2015 UTC,And probably sell him back in 3-4 years for 40 mil. Once he gets more than 2 consecutive games Montoya could develop into a really solid RB.
Barca,39gbck,jairzinho,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"Not a chance.  I've watched him consistently for 3,4,5 years...however long he's been in the team.  Everyone on here and elsewhere had high hopes for him, but I never understood it.  Defensively, he couldn't handle 1 on 1s and once he got into the attacking 3rd his brain would turn to mush.  Adriano was twice the player before he got a bit older, but even he couldn't get much time.  Thank god we got Vidal..."
Barca,39gbck,barcafor20,6,Fri Jun 12 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"Personally I would prefer he left in January so we have fullback cover while Vidal can't play, but I understand if he wants to leave because he won't play much anyways. Too bad he never really improved, it was just 2 years ago he was a starter in the Spain team that won U21 Euros, keeping Carvajal on the bench"
Barca,39gbck,Aj16ay,3,Thu Jun 11 15:26:00 2015 UTC,He was really impressive when Alves got injured at the end of 2012. Don't know what happened. Maybe it's because he didn't get much of a chance after Alves returned from injury and it all went downhill from there.
Barca,39gbck,darthvader7888,4,Thu Jun 11 18:36:15 2015 UTC,"Here just fast. That's the only positive I can find in him, his positioning isn't the best but its OK I guess. His ball control is shit and his defending abilities aren't the best tbh."
Barca,39gbck,mrnoor,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:32:43 2015 UTC,This.  I've been saying it for years.  I genuinely didn't understand what he offered - I have a similar feeling with Sergi Roberto.
Barca,39gbck,barcafor20,7,Fri Jun 12 20:40:03 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. He made a fuss earlier in the season, within reason of course. He's been waiting for his chance here but it simply won't come. I know he's talented but there's something that Enrique and our past managers know that I quite don't understand as to why he doesn't get more time. He's a very capable substitute IMO.  However, he can be a starting right back for Liverpool I think within time. Best of luck Martin, thanks for your patience."
Barca,39gbck,Marchisio,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:21:41 2015 UTC,"I can see why Tata and especially Enrique didn't play him much. I'm confused as to why he played so little under Tito/Roura though, he was pretty impressive that season and Alves was having arguably his worst season ever."
Barca,39gbck,darthvader7888,2,Thu Jun 11 18:37:53 2015 UTC,"Just like I said about Song, Liverpool... showm e the money!!! and you can have him. Thanks."
Barca,39gbck,polechi33,2,Thu Jun 11 15:49:39 2015 UTC,Watch us loan him and then he ends up leaving for free when his contract expires.
Barca,39gbck,BarcaChaldo,2,Thu Jun 11 16:30:32 2015 UTC,"Why would we want to sell him?   If he wants to leave and we already have two RB's higher than him in the rotation, there's no reason to keep him. If I were Montoya I'd probably want to leave too. He's a pretty talented player that's not quite talented enough to get the playing time he wants and needs with this squad."
Barca,39gbck,sleepsholymountain,2,Thu Jun 11 19:42:02 2015 UTC,If Alves got injured Montoya would probably get all the games until January if Adriano leaves. So he should leave there and not before that.
Barca,39gbck,JurijFedorov,2,Thu Jun 11 21:10:44 2015 UTC,"Good for them, they really need a good RB. So long, Montoya, it sucks that you couldn't make it in here."

Even if Xavi is gone, it just means that Rafinha will get a bigger role, and that Samper hopefully will be formed into a orchestrating-CM which he can.  4-3-3 got us the treble. There's no need to change anything."
Barca,39jc12,Morcule,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:33:23 2015 UTC,Shockingly the double pivot makes us lose more control. Not a fan of it at all.
Barca,39jc12,cdn_brcafan,2,Fri Jun 12 13:44:54 2015 UTC,Here's a crazier idea : Vidal played as right midfielder for Spain. What if he wasn't bought to replace Alves but to replace Xavi ?  I would be pissed.
Barca,39jc12,Duke--Nukem,2,Fri Jun 12 10:13:12 2015 UTC,"During the season, it came out that early in training they were experimenting with a 3 man back with Cuadrado coming in as a right wingback.  The transfer fell through and the idea was scraped. But a back three of Bartra-Pique-Masch (although you'd rather Mathieu or Verm since they are left footed) , with Vidal and Alba providing the width could be played with."
Barca,39jc12,Hakob2,2,Fri Jun 12 03:21:35 2015 UTC,"That's a more defensive formation than what we have, sacrificing a midfielder for a Center Back. Why is this sacrifice even necessary? Our defense looks pretty good with just 2 CBs, and losing a midfielder will result in loss of control."
Barca,39jc12,johan14cruyff,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:00:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but no. There's no reason we should change the midfield right now, it works so well. I like Bartra, I think with some improvement he could step in for Masche when the time comes. But for now, he's a backup"
Barca,39jc12,Aj16ay,2,Fri Jun 12 03:38:49 2015 UTC,"What I hope is that he should be the first choice backup and not the second choice.  Mathieu does give experience and pace, but it is high time Bartra had an important role in the team. Considering Lucho's rotations, the first choice backup will get a lot of minutes and Bartra would be happy with that temporarily. He is a great talent and wasting him on the bench or losing him to some other team would be a bad mistake."
Barca,39jc12,johan14cruyff,0,Fri Jun 12 09:03:00 2015 UTC,That I definitely agree with. Bartra should be first choice backup for sure
Barca,39ff36,brocccoli,41,Thu Jun 11 10:37:02 2015 UTC,should have been selected in the first place
Barca,39ff36,XsTream23,5,Thu Jun 11 12:28:06 2015 UTC,"As a Brazilian I really don't think he should have. Is Dani amazing for Barca? Yes. But he's never quite found that level for the national team. Brazil really needs to focus on 2018 and Dani certainly won't be a factor for that, so why call him up? We need to be building our younger players with experience from the national team, and Copa is a perfect time to do it."

I think it's crazy to leave the number unused for a season, what sort of message does that send to those two? ""You're not good enough, we'll only give you this number after you reach a certain point or we'll save it for someone expensive.""  Hell no. If we want La Masia players to step up, you have to start by showing faith in them."
Barca,39hzx3,egcg119,6,Fri Jun 12 00:34:08 2015 UTC,"Devil's advocate here though, if we don't give it to someone could we use that as motivation for either Samper or Rafinha? I mean Puyol gave 5 to Busquets because he earned it. Xavi's 6 doesn't really have a worthy replacement atm and giving it to unproven or yet to prove talents would add a lot of pressure on kids coming in to the first team. I mean just merely starting for a club like Barca is already a lot of pressure on kids and then add the faith of a club by giving them the number of a legend? If I were them I'd be pissing myself on the field.  Let Rafinha keep his number for now, give Samper one available that he wants. Now that Xavi is gone that spot is up for grabs. Let them duke it out on the pitch and prove they deserve that number,  that place in the squad. They earn the respect of the club and that they are indeed the future legends we will worship one day. We all know they are good, that they have promising futures. But are they Xavi good? Do they have that potential or at least close to it? Let them show us by using that 6 as motivation to prove that number is rightfully theirs."
Barca,39hzx3,Plateau95,5,Fri Jun 12 03:15:44 2015 UTC,"I hear you but it doesn't sit well with me. Puyols number was going to someone no matter what, that he chose it doesn't make it more special.  There are going to be 23-24 players for 25 numbers, to avoid giving Xavis number is too conspicuous, making a big deal out of it.  Basic question: what would Xavi want? To deify his own image by withholding the number and use it as a carrot for kids? No way."
Barca,39hzx3,egcg119,2,Fri Jun 12 03:19:44 2015 UTC,"You can call it a carrot and it looks ugly and you can call it as motivation and it looks alright, but I understand your argument. It's probably much simpler to just give it to Rafinha."

Barca,39hzx3,reese_ridley,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:05:01 2015 UTC,"It sends the message, this is a freaking club legend, the main point is not to prove Samper or Rafinha are not worthy, but to show respect for a player that gave his professional career for our club. I don't think anyone would feel discouraged not being able to use a number that a Xavi left for one season. If xavi wanted to leave it to someone specifically, that would be fine otherwise a youngster proving themselves after one season is perfectly fine.  I do agree that someone new and expensive inheriting the number would be discouraging to a La Masia player though."

Of course, it's a big number for such a young player, and one who might not feature so much to begin with. But given his reputation in Barcelona, and his potential, I think he should be the next holder of it.  I wouldn't like if a big money star (ex. Pogba) got it. Because the number would've went from a legendary club legend who came through the ranks and became the greatest ever, to a player that was bought in for a huge sum of money. I don't like what doing something like that would represent.   I'd also mention Busquets, but like mentioned here, he just got given a legendary number. We could say Iniesta too, but then the same discussion would start again, just with the ''number 8''."
Barca,39hzx3,Morcule,4,Thu Jun 11 22:58:39 2015 UTC,Denis Suarez?
Barca,39hzx3,IhateAngryBirds,3,Thu Jun 11 23:40:13 2015 UTC,I would love to see Rafi wearing it.
Barca,39hzx3,ace_boogie,3,Fri Jun 12 01:01:48 2015 UTC,I think Iniesta will be wearing 6 and Rakitic 8 next season.
Barca,39hzx3,extrapao,8,Fri Jun 12 04:17:13 2015 UTC,Somehow I can't see Rakitic wearing anything but #4
Barca,39hzx3,Jose_Monteverde,3,Fri Jun 12 05:46:51 2015 UTC,Personally I would like Rafinha or Samper to have it!
Barca,39hzx3,tiagom0702,3,Thu Jun 11 23:51:46 2015 UTC,"I just hope if Rafinha does get the 6, then it'll become his catalyst/motivation to reach his full potential. With a number that has been worn for years by a club/national legend, it should be enough to give Rafinha the drive to become the best player he possibly could."
Barca,39hzx3,kostkeon,5,Fri Jun 12 06:42:05 2015 UTC,I personally think no one should have it until we see which up and comers (or transfers) start to establish themselves/ earn it
Barca,39hzx3,dk1244973,5,Thu Jun 11 22:22:33 2015 UTC,"Busi wouldn't take the number 6. It should go to whomever Xavi wants to inherit it. Whether it's Samper, Roberto, or Rafinha (or anyone else) it should be Xavi's choice, like it was for Puyol."
Barca,39hzx3,SuperZero42,3,Thu Jun 11 23:07:36 2015 UTC,Samper plz  Or new signing (Gündoğan?)
Barca,39hzx3,Aj16ay,2,Thu Jun 11 21:21:58 2015 UTC,"If Iniesta doesn't take it, our next main midfielder should. Perhaps Pogba. Xavi's legend is beyond a number. We should be realistic. Andres should have dibs. If he doesn't want it, it should be up for grabs."
Barca,39hzx3,dilez9,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:28:57 2015 UTC,Who would take Iniesta's number then? I think we should just wait.
Barca,39hzx3,iniestas,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:51:38 2015 UTC,"The No. 6 will go to no one for the time being.  That number will be reserved for the next big midfield buy: Pogba, Ilkay, Koke, or resurrected Christ.  Raf, Denis, Samper are not only backups, but also have some things to prove.  Said in another way they could be gone after a few years.  Barca will wait, in my opinion, until next year to give the shirt to a more qualified player, read: the person who will eventually assume Iniesta's role."
Barca,39hzx3,cdrawesome,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:11:06 2015 UTC,Was honestly just thinking about it. The number might be taken by Iniesta since both him and Xavi wanted six. That's why Iniesta is 6 for Spain and Xavi is 8 vice versa. It doesn't matter really as long as whoever gets it deserves it.
Barca,39hzx3,ParathaReddit,4,Thu Jun 11 21:20:52 2015 UTC,You got it the wrong way. They both wanted 8. 6 is associated with a DM.
Barca,39fxuq,Illegal_sal,13,Thu Jun 11 13:33:46 2015 UTC,He's hardly a defender lol
Barca,39fxuq,Kluey,4,Thu Jun 11 16:12:27 2015 UTC,how does Pique have less than Alves if they both played for Barca since 2008 + Pique won a few trophies with ManU + won trophies with Spain
Barca,39fxuq,IapetusTheGreat,6,Thu Jun 11 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"Well, they both played at Barcelona since 2008, you're right. But you have to remember Alves is older. So all the trophies they won with Barcelona, plus the ones that Pique won at United, and that's it. But before Barcelona, Alves was at Sevilla, where he won the Copa and the Europa League and before that he was somewhere in Brazil where I think he won a few as well.   Edit: I don't believe this takes into account international play. Looking at both of their international honors, Alves has won Copa America once and Confederations Cup twice. Pique has a World Cup and a European Cup."

Barca,39i3uv,Chunky_mono,2,Thu Jun 11 21:36:21 2015 UTC,Last two paragraphs.....Imagine if Bassat had won! Barça's history would be completely different.
Barca,39g5l5,Illegal_sal,10,Thu Jun 11 14:30:30 2015 UTC,"This crushes my arguments over the past few days whether or not we need Pogba/Gundogan...   I think our current starting midfield with Rafinha, Sergi, Denis and Samper on the bench is perfect. Then Halilovic will come in after a loan (totally assuming) and also have great opportunities to play. Very happy they brought him back, and a year early at that."
Barca,39g5l5,Marchisio,5,Thu Jun 11 17:17:26 2015 UTC,"I still have the thought that Halilovic is the best replacement for Iniesta, he is very good on the dribble and plays a similar role to Iniesta. The main similarity though is the small agile frame that is good on the ball. He is probably the best direct prospect we currently have for replacing Iniesta, unless Messi moves back to that position."
Barca,39g5l5,FrostyGrass,3,Thu Jun 11 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"I have to agree, from what I've seen of him he has incredible control of the ball, is great at taking on players and is very attack minded. I hope in a few seasons he'll be a contention for a starting position. He's incredible.  Also, I don't want Messi moving back and I don't think we need him to. He's been much harder to defend coming in from the right and doesn't have to track back to the middle of the field to start up  plays anymore"
Barca,39g5l5,Marchisio,2,Thu Jun 11 18:27:52 2015 UTC,"I was just referring to what Messi himself said about midfield. But you are right about Halilovic has such potential, a very exciting player to watch."
Barca,39g5l5,FrostyGrass,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:04:14 2015 UTC,"IMO if we can get Pogba, we should get him because he's an incredible talent who will improve our team no matter where he plays."
Barca,39g5l5,A_F_R,3,Fri Jun 12 01:12:08 2015 UTC,Sport was reporting that he can't play untill January apparently.
Barca,39g5l5,IhateAngryBirds,7,Thu Jun 11 14:55:56 2015 UTC,"Yep.   If Denis Suarez (21) returns from loan at Sevilla this summer, he won't be able to play until January because of Fifa ban. [tmw via sport]  http://www.sport.es/es/noticias/mercado-de-fichajes/denis-suarez-podria-volver-barca-pero-jugaria-hasta-enero-4265822"
Barca,39g5l5,jklz,9,Thu Jun 11 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"In case anyone is looking for the explanation. It's because Sevilla activated the option to buy (6m), which Barcelona can block only by buying him back for 9M. Of course this means that Denis Suárez is a purchase, rather than a loan recall."
Barca,39g5l5,Hakob2,2,Thu Jun 11 16:42:31 2015 UTC,Does that mean Suarez agreed to a contract with Sevilla? That's kind of annoying if him agreeing to terms hurts us and he still did iit.
Barca,39g5l5,Marchisio,3,Thu Jun 11 17:03:42 2015 UTC,"Good point, even with the option to buy he would have to agree to it no? If that's the case he agreed to stay and ended up costing us more money"

Barca,39hrbj,ekandler,14,Thu Jun 11 20:15:38 2015 UTC,"Along with the fact that he has a chance to play more and start learning how to coach -- $$$$$.  Athletes have a very short career compared to someone who works and retires when they're 60-65, so I don't blame him at all for wanting to extend his career in Qatar and build up his nest egg as much as possible for his kids and grand kids and so on."

He will live like a king for three years, play in a league where he will be better than everyone else, and work on his coaching licenses.  I think all things considered, he is still a one club player. Qatar is not the same level, its like he went to go play in the minor leagues."

Perhaps he just would prefer to do what is right for him and his family, given he has helped lead the team a treble, or is that not enough for you?  Dani and Pedro both signed, my question still stands, do you blame them as puppet for ol bart?"
Barca,39ff7o,polechi33,6,Thu Jun 11 18:24:23 2015 UTC,"Bartomeu? He does what suits him. He has made over 100 public appearances. He's made electoral decisions. (not sure what he means with this)     Barça lost against Real Sociedad on January 4th. Messi held a meeting with the president on the 6th. On the 7th, Bartu announced he would call for elections at the end of the season. Since that announcement, he's had 70 media appearances (written, radio) and 34 post-game interviews. A covert campaign before the campaign started. And what happened this week, signings and renewals, is more of that. He even got the official FCB twitter account to retweet his 'I'm running for president' tweets after he had already stepped down. That's what Benedito is denouncing: the alleged fair play in the presidential race does not exist."

Anybody who TRULY hates somebody strictly because of what team they support has some serious issues. It's more of a football associated rivalry, fan-sportsmanship, if you'd like. I think it's healthy for the social aspects of the game and putting more emphasis on team spirit; to go up against your big arch-rival makes the game itself a lot more interesting and hyped.   That said, it's important that the ""hate"" is kept just like that; for the good of the sport and the fans. When it boils over to actual violence and people getting hurt is when it's gone too far.

Barca,39lu1r,cdn_brcafan,3,Fri Jun 12 19:04:35 2015 UTC,For me it is the way your team act on the field. They complain about every little call that don't go their way. Ronaldo is the worst at this. He is a cry baby and pouts all the time. Pepe acts like a POS and has no problem hacking down our players. Same thing with Ramos but to a lesser extent. Marcello used to be a major violator of this but he seems to have grown up this year and had a very good season as a result. There are few players in you starting XI that aren't cry babies. Every team has them but your are some of the worst.

Barca,39g6s8,RayMedia,8,Fri Jun 12 15:18:11 2015 UTC,Both of those words always confuse me. Could you explain what's the difference in PM? I'm serious btw.
Barca,39g6s8,robc95,3,Thu Jun 11 19:12:18 2015 UTC,"Of course. So ""less"" is used when you are talking about a lower/smaller/reduced amount of something that cannot be quantified, e.g. money, flour and paper.  Fewer is used when you're talking about a lower/smaller/reduced amount of something that can actually be quantified, e.g. Notes of money, bags of flour and pieces of paper.   Hope that helps!"

Barca,39fh2q,drotoriouz,8,Thu Jun 11 11:02:53 2015 UTC,Someone should let him know he won't be getting a nod at a bigger club anytime soon.
Barca,39fh2q,Marchisio,7,Thu Jun 11 15:27:25 2015 UTC,I think he belongs in the Premier League. He excelled there for a long time and had a great start to the season.  Not surprised he wants a bigger club after playing for Arsenal and Barca but he hasn't shown he's worth it. I just want to get at least 10M for him at this point...........God we suck at selling
Barca,39fh2q,polechi33,3,Thu Jun 11 13:19:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly, 10 mi would be good for him. Hopefully we can get a little more though."
Barca,39fh2q,nannulators,2,Thu Jun 11 14:20:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he hasn't shown he's worth it. The problem is that lots of players have come into their own since we bought him, which moved him down the list. No big clubs want him because they can afford better, younger players.   He needs to realize that if he wants to play, he needs to continue to prove himself again at a smaller club first."
Barca,39fh2q,Marchisio,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"I think we're kind of saying the same thing, but you're more polite about it haha. You said better younger players are worth the investment where he may not be, which I completely agree with. He also hasn't proved that he's worth the investment either here at Barca or even at West Ham where he was underwhelming the 2nd half of the season, which I would consider a smaller club."
Barca,39fh2q,nannulators,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:19:27 2015 UTC,"Agree. I mean.. he's built for the premier league. He's a solid bet for any time that's 6th place or lower. But why would any of the following teams buy him? They already have very capable players in the position he would play:   Chelsea? They have Cesc and Matic. Ramires too. Man City? Fernandinho and Yaya. Arsenal? Arteta, Flamini, Ramsey, Wilshere Man Utd? Fellaini and money to buy top talent from another top club Tottenham? No standouts, but several players just as good or better than Song. Same with Liverpool.   It's unfortunate he won't realize that these teams won't buy him. He was spoiled with playing at prestigious clubs. He could be again if he would do the work and clean up his name a little bit. All I can think about when I think about Song is a). solid at Arsenal, b). not bad at Barca but didn't fit and couldn't adjust quick enough, c). stupid red card in the world cup."

Barca,39ck6j,xscientist,7,Wed Jun 10 21:22:35 2015 UTC,"It's either a poor translation, or a just a very strange way of expressing friendship out of the blue, unless in response to a threat."
Barca,39ck6j,xscientist,3,Wed Jun 10 21:26:07 2015 UTC,"Probably you are right, I didn't want to share it at first but seeing Valdes's name I realized that has been an entire season without this former veteran of ours and he still remembers his old team mates. So I shared this."
Barca,39ck6j,Zaratthustra,4,Wed Jun 10 21:32:08 2015 UTC,"Not blaming you for sharing it, I just honestly want to know why Valdes would feel the need to express himself this way. Just seems strange."
Barca,39ck6j,Phantomchrism,5,Wed Jun 10 21:34:08 2015 UTC,"That last bit seems weird, I don't know why would he say something like that; I think the translation was probably poor. Unfortunately I can't find anything about this in English at this moment but I got the Spanish report."
Barca,39ck6j,Zaratthustra,2,Wed Jun 10 21:47:16 2015 UTC,aparently is a quote of himself in the reportage about Iniesta in Telecinco (a spanish channel).  So he is doing some publicity.
Barca,39ck6j,OriginalUsername30,2,Wed Jun 10 23:51:49 2015 UTC,"QUOTE: ""Pero en La Masía encuentra a alguien que acabará siendo su amigo del alma. Amistades como la de Víctor Valdés, compañero de Iniesta desde 1996 hasta 2014, fueron vitales: ""Yo siempre he dicho que es mi hermano y esto es más que un amigo porque a un hermano nunca vas a dejar que le toquen"", asegura el exportero del Barça.""  TRANSLATION: This is my translation: But in La Masia he (Iniesta) finds someone who turns out to be his amigo del alma (direct translation is soul friend, meaning they shared a very strong bond). Friendships like with Victor Valdes, Iniesta's teammate from 1996 to 2014. ""I've always said that he's my brother and this is more than (just) friendship because you don't let anyone lay a finger on your brother"", claims (and assures) Barcas ex-keeper (Valdes).  MORE FROM ARTICLE: He's just describing the type of bond they shared in the past, and it comes after a part where the article claims that it was hard for Iniesta to get into the club life at an early age, but he was commited to succeed no matter what. Then the article continues saying that Iniesta had a very slow and rough journey to get into the starter line of the squad, and that any other player would have gone crazy in the process. A reference is made to the final in 2006 when Iniesta was benched through the game.  ME: I hope this gives you some perspective, I just read a small part of the Spanish report that Football_Enthusiast posted, but there's a lot more in that article that I didn't feel like reading."

When it was Pique's turn on the mic, he started out with, ""Thank you to all the staff for your help..."" Followed by..   ""...and thanks Kevin Roldan! IT all started with you!""  Kevin Roldan is the Colombian singer who attended Cristiano Ronaldo's 30th birthday party just hours after Real lost to cross city rivals Atletico 4-0, the day they effectively lost the title to Barcelona.   As such, the Real fans all hate him and the Cules never let them forget who he is.   Pique's troll was genius and the perfect parting words."

Understatedly, him over Xavi offers enough of a size upgrade that the midfield is more solid, and set plays are slightly less dangerous.   However, he continues to throw away too many chances, and turn the ball over needlessly several times a match. I'm sure its an adjustment, but I hope it changes in the coming year."

As u/egcg119 mentioned his writing yesterday, I'd repeat -    He's getting great experience under Unai Emery, but playing as a no. 10 or a forward will not lend itself well to moving into Barcelona’s midfield three. A year for him to work with Luis Enrique directly and audition for the role of future midfielder could be worth more than minutes at Sevilla."

Barca,39f9jf,Flam1,4,Thu Jun 11 10:53:11 2015 UTC,I fully agree. Batra should be able to fight seriously for a starting place this season. We already have many world class defenders.
Barca,39f9jf,Mentosfruitcore,2,Thu Jun 11 13:40:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly, Barça already got enough players who are just perfect to play in that position so fetching another CB means one of our current CBs will have to go.

Barca,39f9jf,iagolima,5,Thu Jun 11 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"I think getting back Denis Suarez should be a priority. Montoya doesn't have a future in the first team, so I would happily do the trade you mentioned. Denis is young, he could be developed into a future first team talent, but he should be molded from the very beginning. As stated in that totalbarça article, now, with the transfer ban, is the best time to do so."
Barca,39f9jf,Marchisio,2,Thu Jun 11 10:43:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that Montoya won't stay at Barça. And about bringing back Denis Suarez, Luis Enrique is highly interested to play Denis at Barça so I hope the board will fulfill Lucho's wish to get Denis Suarez.   What's your opinion about Barça's attempt to get a new CB?"
Barca,39f9jf,El_Spacho,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:49:38 2015 UTC,What's your source on Enrique's interest in having Denis here? Just curious why you seem so certain. I would love to believe this.
Barca,39f9jf,beastcat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:23:00 2015 UTC,I'm not certain about Luis Enrique being interested in having Denis at Barça and I don't trust marca that much but the link that I've shared in my post says Lucho is eager to work with Denis.
Barca,39f9jf,polechi33,3,Thu Jun 11 15:59:29 2015 UTC,"If you would like to watch Dragovic play, your next chance is on Sunday when we play vs. Russia for the Euro-qualification. He will definitely start, but it isnt sure yet if he will play CB or CDM (as replacement for David Alaba, who is still recovering from his injury)."
Barca,39f9jf,Marchisio,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:08:54 2015 UTC,"I think Montoya should be sold and nothing else. Denis has responded well at sevilla under unai emery and trying to get him back will hurt his growth, I believe. I think he's a player that needs much playing time, and he certainly won't be getting much at barça for some time.  Rafinha is still competing for minutes and if we make a move for some sort of midfielder in the transfer market then it will impact playing time for our younger mids.  I say keep him there and to allow him to unfurl his talents and talons. And if he does grow a great deal, to be valued in 2 years for about 20-25 millions (I think very much possible) then to me buying him back for 9 millions is a sweet deal. Obviously the importance in all this is not money, but the nurturing of a football talent that is already making an impact in the first team for Sevilla.  Also, I don't know anything about dragovic. But we should focus on Bartra and verm. So, NO for dragovic."
Barca,39f9jf,polechi33,2,Thu Jun 11 13:15:03 2015 UTC,Our team is totally stacked with many talents so you are right about Denis finding it difficult to get regular playing time now. Additionally if Pogba really comes to Barça then it will be even more difficult for Denis to get enough playing time on pitch.
Barca,39f9jf,Marchisio,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:19:58 2015 UTC,"That is my problem with bringing Pogba in, I am not saying he is not good and wouldn't be nice to have him. Just that him coming will stop the development of Rafinha, Denis Suarez, and Halilovic.  And perhaps these youngsters might  leave us due the lack of oportunities.   If we get a midfilder, he should be with a set of skills similar to Xavi. We do not have one of those in our youth teams."
Barca,39f9jf,polechi33,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:21:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about Rafinha losing minutes, he plays a very different style than Pogba and Enrique is very fond of him. For now, Denis is at Sevilla for another season at least (as far as we know) and Halilovic will certainly be loaned out. I think having Pogba would be great with Xavi out the door and Iniesta aging."
Barca,39f9jf,polechi33,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:24:41 2015 UTC,"Pogba would be a great replacement for Iniesta, but Iniesta has a good 2-3 years left with us.   Denis is gone for now, but what are we going to do when he gets back next year?  Halilovic is 19 and should be ready for the first team in 2-3 years. We need to think about these things.  To replace Xavi, we need player who give us control and sets the time for the game. A players like Gundogan could do that for us. And let's mention that we do not have a promising midfielder with that capability coming throgh, well maybe Samper, but he will play as CDM."
Barca,39f9jf,ir7425,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:45:35 2015 UTC,"We honestly don't know if Denis will come back, Sevilla has excercised their option to buy. We have to shell out 9M to get him back and it's not certain that we will, as much as we all hope.  Also, we're not replacing Xavi, we don't play the same as we did when he was in his prime. Our midfield doesn't need his type of style anymore, we're more direct. Rakitic, Iniesta, Rafinha, Poga, etc. all fill the roles in our midfield that we need.  I don't care whether we get Gundogan or Pogba, but we do need another midfielder. Samper can play either DM or CM, he has the ability to control the game anywhere in the midfield, he just needs time to develop. He'll be an understudy for a few seasons until he's ready to take over, which can be when Iniesta is on his way out."

I doubt he will start for the next three years, if he slows down this year, Aleix will probably start the year next. This season is for Aliex to start to work on his RB abilities, and for Dani to be his mentor. Vidal and Dani aren't fighting for the RB, Dani knows it, Aleix knows it.   Nice to see Messi convincing one of his good mates and players to stay"
Barca,39aa7d,MSNFCBLove,14,Wed Jun 10 14:44:16 2015 UTC,I think Dani can compete. Look at what happened with Pique's form when we had good line up options without having to play him.
Barca,39aa7d,ShotgunToothpaste,6,Wed Jun 10 15:10:21 2015 UTC,Dani could always move into Adriano's role if he leaves.  Dani is very versatile.  Look at this season he played a false RB/CM.

Barca,39bohz,Chillidawg,40,Wed Jun 10 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"It's Alba, what is there to say? He's an incredible left back who gives his 110% in every game. His link-up play with Messi, Neymar and Iniesta has been great this season (same link-up that led to the opening goal in the CL final). He rarely fails to out-run his defender when doing a one-two or receiving a curved throughball from Messi. Saved a lot of goals this season with good last minute tackles and blocks. He's solidified his position and there's not a single player right now who could easily replace him."
Barca,39bohz,Robbzor11,16,Wed Jun 10 18:27:28 2015 UTC,"I think the only bad thing I could say about him is that he often receives great chances to score on attack and misses them.

Barca,39bohz,TryHardJelly,13,Thu Jun 11 10:45:57 2015 UTC,He has matured and grown this past season.I was excited when we signed him and although he would have slumps I knew there was not another left-back that would fit the club.He has been excellent thus far and his defensive abilities have really shined this season and his link up play is just getting even better.I think he will only continue to grow this upcoming season.
Barca,39bohz,somethingcool-1,9,Wed Jun 10 18:34:54 2015 UTC,"Massive improvement this season from Alba to be honest. I mean massive, however there still was a lot left to actually be improved upon.   Last season I actually couldn't stand Alba, it was one of those things where he just follows play recklessly, a bit like Alves used to be. A bit of this showed in the CL final actually (for the goal, not saying he was at fault, he wasn't but had patience been applied he would have covered that run).   He's impatient as a defender but I'll be damned if he didn't curb this enthusiasm professionally this year. He became patient, obviously his style of play still shone through what with all the interceptions and lung bursting runs forward as evidence, but he used that so much better to his advantage this year.   It helps when you have Busquets covering for you when you sometimes abandon your position but that scenario was so rare from him this year. It's a toss up between him and Pique for most improved player but I'll pick him because Pique kind of just rediscovered his Guardiola era form whereas Alba is now using what was formerly a liability as a strength."
Barca,39bohz,invice,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:50:46 2015 UTC,"The goal was a bit due to Neymar's fault as he should have tracked Lichtsteiner's run, as Alba came to press up higher."

I'm just saying once Lichtsteiner had intercepted Alves' pass there was no immediate danger. Marchisio was moving toward Neymar, away from goal. If Alba had recognized there was no immediate threat and decided to instead wait until sufficient cover had been offered, no cross would have been made. But yeah, Neymar was at fault because he should have been tracking that Lichsteiner run."

Barca,39bohz,Morcule,6,Wed Jun 10 19:01:12 2015 UTC,"Defensively, fantastic. Workrate, fantastic. Offensively, +-.  He makes great runs with his unreal pace, and a LW or LCM in our team, will always have him by his side. Techically he's not bad at all, but he's neither any special. I don't find that a very important problem, but one of his problems, IMO, is his lack of creative choices and end product.   ATM he is by far our best LB, with Adriano being totally out of it, and Mathieu not seeming to fit the LB-role here as he did at Valencia. But, at our B-team there is a little man called Grimaldo. Grimaldo is 19, and is IMO, showing more positive attacking skills than Alba. He's a better crosser, has much better technique and is more intelligent. He doesn't however have the stamina to run as much as Alba, neither does he have his defensive skills. But against a team that plays very deep, I would actually prefer the 19 y.o. But I also got to keep in mind he's playing in Segunda, while Alba is facing the worlds best.  But I'm very happy with Alba. He does have things he can improve on, but overall, good player. Wouldn't permanently replace him with anyone."
Barca,39bohz,rdesyo,2,Wed Jun 10 21:14:39 2015 UTC,"Was thinking about who the most underrated player on the squad is and in my opinion it is definitely Alba. He plays the role of 2 players, he's amazing."

Barca,39bohz,Mugiwara_Luffy,2,Thu Jun 11 12:08:25 2015 UTC,"I think he is one of the most consistent players in the team, rarely does a mistake.  There is a big scope for improvement in offensive capabilities though, he has to deliver better crosses(low ones or the header chances). So many times good chances created by messi or Iniesta(he is the fastest one and can get into such positions easily) are wasted because he makes lazy pass into the penalty area and we are left with a corner."
Barca,39bohz,wiggens,2,Thu Jun 11 20:06:35 2015 UTC,Alba is in fact a beast. I'm glad he did not dive as much as last season. he also looks like he is controlling his temper and maturing
Barca,39bohz,jklz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"I think I was a pretty big Alba critic, but he ahs improved so much in the past season. He of course wasted a couple of clear cut chances from one of those amazing Messi passes, but that's something he can work on.  What I was really worried about, was his defensive performances. He used to struggle a lot against forwards that were just as fast as him. This of course, because he mainly used his speed to save him out in defence. But this season he has improved significantly in every aspect defensively.   Of course we haven't seen him against someone as good as Robben yet this season, but I've been impressed.   Hopefully he will be joined by Grimaldo next season. The kid can learn quite a bit from Alba."

Although he doesn't make many big plays (which is probably why anybody who doesn't watch Barcelona thinks he's not good), he is a very solid defender. But not only that, he has good passing, quick decision making, and everything else that comes with being a world class LB."
Barca,39bohz,passerby-,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:47:14 2015 UTC,I like him more than Alves.
Barca,39bohz,mattb10,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:30:40 2015 UTC,"One thing that I want to say that isn't mentioned as much as it should is the triangle of Neymar-Alba-Iniesta.  They link up perfectly and all can overlap eachother everywhere.  If Neymar cuts in, Alba overlaps into the box.  If Alba cuts in, Neymar cuts in behind and Iniesta goes out wide.  It's amazing to see such deadly trios on both sides of the pitch"

Barca,39cjyf,PicopicoEMD,41,Wed Jun 10 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"Huge Neymar fanboy here, but the team really started turning things around once Suarez got his feet wet."
Barca,39cjyf,cholosmakingcupcakes,23,Wed Jun 10 22:24:23 2015 UTC,"Suárez, he contributed everywhere, not only with goals and assists,  but amazing workrate,  perfect work off the ball, making runs, defending,  he was key at set pieces.... Luis to is just too much, we are blessed"
Barca,39cjyf,godie,6,Wed Jun 10 21:54:30 2015 UTC,tricky question... but i agree with what you say.  Suarez workrate and constant movement allows neymar and messi to work.
Barca,39cjyf,Super_leo2000,9,Wed Jun 10 23:33:57 2015 UTC,"I love neymar, but it has to be suarez. He is always running and gives lots of assists. When Suarez is off, the load is mostly on messi."
Barca,39cjyf,jimtheguy69,8,Thu Jun 11 01:34:47 2015 UTC,I'd say Suarez contributed more in defence + chances created.
Barca,39cjyf,RayMedia,4,Wed Jun 10 22:42:03 2015 UTC,"This was like at LFC too, his presence made Sturridge and Sterling look like world class players because of all the work that Suarez did. Now that he is gone, they were back to being useless.  Suarez is absolutely amazing. I was hoping he might get to take some freejicks this season at barca but I gueks messi will be taking most of them.. SUAREZ Scored some awesome freekick goals while at LFC."

Barca,39cjyf,TheCornholio66,6,Wed Jun 10 21:59:41 2015 UTC,"Neymar always shows up in big games, he was massive on all big matches we had.  I'd go with Neymar"
Barca,39cjyf,IhateAngryBirds,3,Thu Jun 11 08:03:41 2015 UTC,"He just scored easy chances that other created for him, and when he created something he always messed up the last pass, he has to work on the last pass he gives its always not on point."
Barca,39cjyf,TimeFingers,9,Thu Jun 11 09:06:34 2015 UTC,"It would be unfair to compare them in my opinion. Neymar was consistent since day one while Suarez only started playing twice a week months later. I guess that worked in his favor, but let's not forget that Suarez also had a difficult start.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that there will inevitably be a drop in form when you play 50+ matches a season. Apart of being wasteful mostly in a few decided matches, I think Neymar managed to stay very sharp whole season long (except for one isolated period of 2-3 weeks).  So to answer your question, in 2015 alone it's probably Suarez by a small margin. 2014-2015 the whole season? - it has to be Neymar."
Barca,39cjyf,decho,3,Wed Jun 10 22:47:03 2015 UTC,"I think that Suarez was better.  Goals and assists, creating chances, key passes, creates space for himself and others, workrate, defending abilities.  Neymar had more of an impact on scoring goals but Suarez was the engine behind a lot of things and I honestly believe that Suarez is the second best player in the world."
Barca,39cjyf,mattb10,3,Thu Jun 11 03:46:51 2015 UTC,"Neymar is getting better but Suarez was beast in the short time he played. His touch and finishes are just lethal. Love watching Suarez, you never know what he'll do."
Barca,39cjyf,deepfunkysoul,2,Thu Jun 11 02:52:48 2015 UTC,"NEYMAR: scores in almost every big game and the decisive goals when it counts (clasicos, Copa, CL). Has the footballing connection with Messi & Iniesta that makes everything work"
Barca,39cjyf,mettacitta,2,Thu Jun 11 07:10:05 2015 UTC,"Suarez was more important for us (thanks to his selfless movement and deadly physical presence), but Neymar had better season (I hope that makes sence). Not just stats, I really think he matured into an incredible player and right now is the number three in world football."

Barca,39cjyf,broncosrb26,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:03:51 2015 UTC,Suarez and it's not close. He started out slow but he had much more influence on the game than Neymar.

Barca,39aphv,Illegal_sal,39,Wed Jun 10 13:49:47 2015 UTC,As much as I like Adriano his season was pretty poor.  If we're bringing in Vidal and promoting Grimaldo then this seems like the best move for him.
Barca,39aphv,elbossohogo,8,Wed Jun 10 14:23:04 2015 UTC,"I agree. If we can get a good amount of cash for him, I say we sell him."
Barca,39aphv,Mentosfruitcore,3,Wed Jun 10 14:57:10 2015 UTC,A player who's served us as well as Adriano has should be able to determine his own future.
Barca,39aphv,gblr,13,Wed Jun 10 21:47:50 2015 UTC,"Seems his best years are behind him. He's a great squad player to have who was extremely useful last season when we had so many injuries, he's basically a Swiss army knife. Thankfully we didn't need him to step in as much this season. Wish him the best, Roma is a great club."
Barca,39aphv,Marchisio,11,Wed Jun 10 15:00:09 2015 UTC,"he has helped us so much in the past years, his versatility was amazing, he played basically on every position except Goalkeeper (theres still time for that i imagine )    but right now his age is showing up in his performances ,and about form well.. its pretty difficult to be in form when you re not used regularly , not even as a sub ,  i  appreciate though  everything that he has done for us and how he never complained about lack of playing time , i think he deserves to go be  on a team somewhere else as a starter, he has done his job very well here at Barca"
Barca,39aphv,XsTream23,8,Wed Jun 10 15:51:01 2015 UTC,He has been a very underrated player in the squad over the last few years. Dependable backup player.
Barca,39aphv,lonestar_10,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:13:44 2015 UTC,"completely agree, scored some very nice long ranged goals aswell..."
Barca,39aphv,XsTream23,3,Wed Jun 10 21:09:59 2015 UTC,"Remember when Atletico were leading the league in Tito's season. They came to Camp Nou, Falcao scored first. We looked pretty toothless because they packed the box, then Adriano pops in the most ridiculous curled shot with his left from the corner of the box after which Atletico fell apart a bit and we won 4-1."
Barca,39aphv,ShotgunToothpaste,7,Thu Jun 11 01:48:40 2015 UTC,"This would be a great, and probably the best, move for every part. Grimaldo is awesome and shouldn't be playing in the 3rd division - and Adriano was declining but is still good enough for many top 5 in the league-teams around the world.  Really hope this happens. Grimaldo could get a decent amount of playing time with Vidal not being able to play for 5 months. He could use the upcoming season to fight for a spot vs. Vidal - and whoever comes ""last"" could be loaned out to a La Liga side."
Barca,39aphv,kezorN,8,Wed Jun 10 15:44:24 2015 UTC,"If Adriano leaves, Grimaldo and Vidal would serve as Jordi and Dani's backups, respectively. No?"
Barca,39aphv,roboto-sama,5,Wed Jun 10 15:55:25 2015 UTC,"Probably not, I see Vidal playing as RB and maybe on the attack. Other than Grimaldo, Mathieu and Vermaelen can play as LB."
Barca,39aphv,polechi33,3,Wed Jun 10 16:12:40 2015 UTC,Verminator doesn't have the pace though. Mathieu does so he would probably play there ahead of Grimaldo except in maybe early CdR games.
Barca,39aphv,Plateau95,3,Wed Jun 10 16:15:43 2015 UTC,Grimaldo will definitely be a backup to Jordi and I suspect that Vidal will fight for a spot with Dani and will slowly start taking over the position.
Barca,39aphv,astral_cowboy,0,Wed Jun 10 16:13:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how it would work out exactly, I mean both Dani and Alba are definite starters normally, but eventually Lucho has to start implementing Vidal and Grimaldo, for the future. Obviously Alba has got lots more years in him as he is only 26, but either Grimaldo or Vidal should be getting some playing time on that RB/Dani spot.  Much like this year, it was only Adriano who got a decent amount of playing time out of our non-starters, so I would suspect that Grimaldo would be called up to the senior team and then loaned out in the January window (we could need him while Vidal can't play). I don't think it's possible to develop and to keep four fullbacks happy (assuming Montoya and Douglas are sold), especially since two of them just won the treble."
Barca,39aphv,kezorN,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:18:12 2015 UTC,"Grimaldo is LB, he is not an RB."
Barca,39aphv,polechi33,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:11:39 2015 UTC,He would still be able to play RB.
Barca,39aphv,kezorN,2,Wed Jun 10 16:34:45 2015 UTC,Has he ever played on the right? Because if he can play on both sides that would be fucking awesome.
Barca,39aphv,_sic,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I've seen (and heard about) him being used at RB multiple times when covering for someone (patric? not sure) when he was injured. Obviously doesn't mean that he would be as good as he is at LB, but I'm 98% sure that he's played there before.   It's the same role, you just gotta get used to the new position on the pitch.

Nothing new. He'll pay the additional fines (on top of what he's already paid back) but I suppose he'll continue to be dragged in the media in the meantime.

Barca,39a9wm,Football_Enthusiast,12,Wed Jun 10 11:54:40 2015 UTC,"Then Spaniards get upset with Catalans wanting to leave the country. I am certain that if Messi was from Real Madrid, he would have no problem."
Barca,39a9wm,polechi33,3,Wed Jun 10 12:20:11 2015 UTC,"If Messi was from Real Madrid then he wouldn't face any of these problems. I think Messi isn't even aware about these legal terms upon which they are accusing him, and there must be some sort of misunderstanding; I hope Messi will be proven innocent.   I'm pretty sure that Real's precious Ronaldo, Bale, Rodriguez aren't any saint when it comes to legal issues but they won't face any problem since they play for the Real."
Barca,39a9wm,Football_Enthusiast,4,Wed Jun 10 12:41:13 2015 UTC,Fuck's sake this blind support of serious tax evasion is ridiculous.   He set up a series of elaborate shell corporations in multiple international tax havens. It was an elaborate and detailed attempt to defraud the country and evade tax with a clear paper trail.  Just because he's good at footy doesn't stop him from being a shitty person.   If he was a successful banker you'd be crucifying him but for some reason athletes/musicians get some sort of leeway because people like them.

Barca,39a9wm,Football_Enthusiast,2,Wed Jun 10 16:30:22 2015 UTC,"Not saying that Messi could never do such thing, but I think as famous athletes/musicians/actors or actresses etc. generate huge income so they employ professionals to manage their money, legal compliance and stuffs and sometimes these people can't do their job ethically and can mislead the person they advice. Perhaps Messi didn't know about these things all along.  However I'm mostly pissed because Spanish media is highlighting this only when it is about Messi, I've read that something similar to tax evasion case has been filed against Ronaldo too in Portugal and Spanish media is silent about that."

Ha really though, try to look past your own shitty logic there (I happen to remember a lot of people scoffing at ole bart for suggesting there were political forces who wanted to hurt the club) and get to what the truth is.  The truth being that just like in the Neymar case, Messi had some not great advisors who more than likely tried to be a bit cute with his money and a combination of the recent surge of populism in spain along with a tax code woefully out of touch with modern finance (even moreso than a lot of other countries like spain which is saying something) and you get Messi as a perfect target for this sort of thing."

Barca,39a9wm,Barca1919,9,Wed Jun 10 12:33:12 2015 UTC,"No, that's just sensationalism. The worst thing that could come out of this are the penalty fees (not that he cares) and the damage to his reputation.  EDIT: Technically, he could go to jail for it, but he won't is what I meant."

When the case was brought up earlier in the season, it was pushed back until the end of the year.  You can't simply avoid tax evasion just because you are a superstar."

Barca,39a9wm,K_in_Oz,8,Wed Jun 10 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"They are not denying that tax evasion was not done, point that others like casillas,Figo etc didn't face the same amount of harassment as messi. Tax frauds are usually done with settlements/fines. The Spanish are just jealous about catalan's success and this is their pathetic way of showing it. They have done many things like this earlier, hence people accuse them of harassment on messi."

Barca,39c08t,Football_Enthusiast,3,Wed Jun 10 20:52:18 2015 UTC,"Watched the Real Madrid vs Villarreal match this March, Vietto seems to play more like a forward rather than a midfielder to me. But Atletico are strongly linked with him as far as I know."

Barca,3980yo,shakira11,35,Tue Jun 9 22:38:35 2015 UTC,"So, you already gave us your favorite goals.  What are your favorite non-goal moments for Messi?  Plus, you have just completed your course work for you PhD in Messiology of the 2014/2015 season.  What is your expert opinion on how or if Messi has changed this season as a player?"
Barca,3980yo,zazzlekdazzle,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:06:50 2015 UTC,"What are your favorite non-goal moments for Messi?   Probably the fact that Dani Alves turned into a world class right back as soon as Messi started combining with him more often on the side.  Also the volume of his quality passes. Messi has always been a quality passer but this season he has been playing those final balls so often that it's startling.    What is your expert opinion on how or if Messi has changed this season as a player?   Almost two weeks ago I did a compilation of Messi's heatmap on a match-by-match basis over the season. To me it's easily recognizable where Messi started moving more to the wing to accomodate Suárez. I remember reading a while ago that Messi had no problem playing deeper as he gets older and it's clearly noticeable that he can from the way he has played this season.  Around December I said that Messi has declined slightly as a footballer -- I still believe that -- but that's a testament to how good he was around 2011 that even this time around he's easily the best in the world. He's less athletic but more calculated in what he does which meshes well with the teammates around him. In 2011 he needed to be the x-factor but in 2015 he needed to be the glue to hold the team together. Becoming a father has helped him mature on the pitch imo.  Thanks for the gold, by the way"

It will be better organized that way.  To get an idea of what I'm talking about, I've created this some time ago. I know it looks terrible but it can be made better and more compact.

Barca,39a7mu,whathappenstome,2,Wed Jun 10 10:56:15 2015 UTC,What's a soci and why not?
Barca,39a7mu,CorsarioNero,3,Wed Jun 10 12:57:08 2015 UTC,"soci is the official club member who have the right to vote in presidential election. You can become a soci if I remember correctly and am not mistaken by having a close family member who is already a soci, or something like that. If you do not fulfill the requirement, you can buy the commitment card for €137. After you get the card, you have to renew the card, personally, for three years straight. To do this, you have to come to Barcelona Supporters Services Office between June 1 and October 30. If you fail to do so, you have to start over again. If you successfully renew your card for three years straight, then you can formally apply to become a soci. correct me if I'm wrong and sorry for my English. Since it's not my native tongue."
Barca,39a7mu,whathappenstome,2,Wed Jun 10 13:34:20 2015 UTC,"It wasn't always like this. In August 2006, after our second Champions trophy, Joan Laporta started this campaign called El Gran Repte ('The Big Challenge'), which aimed to increase the number of socis as much as possible. My family became socis all the way from South America with zero issues thanks to this campaign: everything was done by snail mail and a few emails. If it wasn't for this, I would not have been able to see Guardiola's team or go to a Clasico later on."
Barca,39a7mu,ksalama,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:20:15 2015 UTC,"woah, you're lucky then. By the time I want to become a soci, the only option I have is buying the commitment card and renew it.

Barca,39a7mu,CorsarioNero,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:46:51 2015 UTC,"Isolating socis that live abroad is one of the keys to Rosell and Bartu's power. Their strength comes from penyas (supporter clubs) and local elder socis.    Shower them with tickets throughout the year, then have the year review assembly on the same weekend as the annual penya gathering. Socis go, cheer on every speech, then vote 'yes' to things like Qatar, the shady Neymar numbers, or the lawsuit against Laporta.  Meanwhile, if you're abroad and want to be a soci, you have to take the 'commitment card' 3 years in a row, which can only be done in person. Only then you can become a soci."
Barca,398d3s,HippoNigga,17,Wed Jun 10 00:07:36 2015 UTC,"First he renewed Alves and Luis Enrique and signed Vidal, that's some good work. Credit where credit is due."
Barca,398d3s,_sic,4,Wed Jun 10 08:17:02 2015 UTC,"Yup..., I am still glad this board resigned though. Hopefully Laporta will be back."
Barca,398d3s,polechi33,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:15:15 2015 UTC,"Until this season, the only thing that was better about Laporta's board was that it bought Ronaldinho (thanks to Rosell, who used to be on his board), hired Pep and eventually put a triplete winning squad out on the pitch. But beyond those good things there were also many bad things that are no different than what we've seen with the current board: corrupt contracts with Traffic (Kerrison and Henrique), deals with dictatorial regimes (Uzbekistan), around €70 m wasted on failed CBs (Thuram, Henrique, Cáceres, Chgryinsky, Milito), not to mention a whole lot of megalomania.   Admittedly, Joan was a lot funnier than Rosell or Nobito, but in essence he was ""la misma mierda"". Now that this board has brought in Neymar (who gives a fuck how - they pay millions in fines or go to jail, we still have Neymar, lol), Suarez and Rakitic, not to mention Bravo and ter Stegen, another triplete winning squad, nobody can complain they didn't take care of the football end. So I don't see Joan coming back as an improvement.   The truth is that whoever comes in next will be ""la misma mierda"". Always have been, stretching back as long as I've been watching Barça, which is a long time. Hell Nuñez and his son are in jail as we speak. But as long as it doesn't effect the football on the pitch, I don't care."
Barca,398d3s,_sic,5,Fri Jun 12 08:06:57 2015 UTC,"There was little they could do with Alves, after what happened in the stadium. Luis Enrique's case is less than logical. Would be nearly suicidal not to do anything about that.  Only the signing of Vidal is truly good work, imo."

They don't win any trophies? (Can't say that without smiling) Man U is already looking into the contracts of Ronaldo, Bale, Varane, and Benzema.  Does this mean they're all leaving? Of course not.  But Khedira is gone, and we're barely a week into silly season.  Casillas is rumored out.  Rafa is gonna want new players and Perez will be more than happy to sign some players before he fires him a year from now.    Long story short, this real team is getting a makeover.  Though it's true that might not be a bad thing for them.  Here's to hoping it is."
Barca,3967z4,elbossohogo,12,Wed Jun 10 04:35:42 2015 UTC,Good to know he will be around. It would be very bad if Barca had to get another coach for the 3rd year running.  No progress would be made.
Barca,3967z4,lonestar_10,6,Tue Jun 9 16:58:03 2015 UTC,What'd be worse is a treble winning coach leaving.

Barca,3967z4,Duke--Nukem,0,Tue Jun 9 23:08:44 2015 UTC,"I asked this question in another thread : Luis Enriqué was noncommittal during all this time and now decides to sign an extension, why ?  Probable answer: to cut the grass under the foot of Bartomeu. Not let him use keeping the treble winning coach as an electoral promis. Maybe."
Barca,3967z4,astral_cowboy,6,Tue Jun 9 16:05:29 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make sense. Lucho isn't against the board, no matter how much people want to stick with that narrative. Why would he be against a board that a.) gave him the opportunity of a lifetime to manage this club, b.) got him all the players he asked for, c.) stuck with him during the toughest of times, d.) still want him to stay even longer.   Lucho has also stated publicly that he's had the support of the president all this time.  I'm pretty sure Luis Enrique's words referred to other things such reflecting if he has the strength and motivation to stay another year, or because of family matters, or waiting until elections because presidents usually bring in new managers."
Barca,3967z4,Duke--Nukem,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:37:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification. I thought he was against this board; because this board fired the guy who brought him in.
Barca,3967z4,astral_cowboy,2,Tue Jun 9 16:41:12 2015 UTC,"It is inferred that he didn't like that decision, since Zubi is his friend. But I guess any professional, especially in a profession like the one he's in, knows that decisiones should be taken.  We'll never be sure of what really happened that got Zubi fired. Was he a scapegoat? Was he doing poorly and that was the perfect excuse of getting him fired? Where the players sick of him for some reason? We'll never know but judging by the results, the board was right (even if it had nothing to do with Zubi)."
Barca,3967z4,justafanpassingby,2,Tue Jun 9 17:02:06 2015 UTC,Few days before getting fired he(zubi) blamed barto for neymar saga and bad transfer decision and mess in the club
Barca,3967z4,ohpuic,2,Tue Jun 9 18:31:26 2015 UTC,It did seem like Zubi only went after Barto only once he knew he was getting fired.
Barca,3967z4,ravniel,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:32:45 2015 UTC,"I would reframe this question and pose it differently: why have Bartomeu and the rest of the board fought so hard to resolve outstanding business before resigning to participate in elections?  Did they conclude that Enrique served them better as an achievement (""we convinced him to stay"") than as a promise (""we'll convince him to stay"")?  Perhaps they concluded that, since he's now won the triplete, everybody in the election is going to back Enrique and he's no longer a useful wedge.  Or perhaps they're simply extremely confident that Bartomeu will be reelected, and so he's got the luxury of laying groundwork for his next term rather than worrying about what's going to win him the election.  I don't know.  I could see this move being interpreted a number of different ways, politically, and I'm interested to hear what people think."

Barca,395a9y,choss,7,Tue Jun 9 11:10:21 2015 UTC,He doesn't want to say he is staying probably so Bartomeu can't use him on his election campaign

Now there's even talk about him actually being renewed for 2 more seasons today."
Barca,395a9y,droid750,6,Tue Jun 9 14:06:47 2015 UTC,"It's just the way I see it, Lucho was close to Zubi, Barto sacked him. We'll see, I still think he doesn't want to be used, doesn't seem like the guy who wants to be part of political stuff.  edit: at least I hope he's not"

Barca,395a9y,corn_diggity,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:26:22 2015 UTC,"Well... the won't be another Xavi, but we need a player who gives us control. We do not have one with those conditions right now in la Masia. While Pogba and Verratti are great players, they have a different set of skills. I think the best fit is Gundogan.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXTh5IKHRFg"
Barca,395a9y,polechi33,3,Tue Jun 9 12:19:34 2015 UTC,"Love those players, especially Gundogan, but do you think a big name would want to come to Barca and not be guaranteed a starting spot in the midfield? I'm thinking they might just cycle in Rafina more"
Barca,395a9y,so_called_asshole,3,Tue Jun 9 18:26:40 2015 UTC,"Well.. we really need a player who give us control, currently we don't have one with the required characteristics. Rafinha, Iniesta and Rakitic are more attacking midfielder. Iniesta has sacrificed himself this year to kind of play a Xavi role, that is why almost everyone is saying he has had a bad year.   The other youth players we have coming are attacking minded too (Denis Suarez and Halilovic). So I don't see how Pogba would fit, even though he is a very promising young player. We should be more concerned about Pogba, regarding the point you made. With all the hipe about him, he will want ot be a starter, so who would you bench?   I think that in the other hand, Gundogan, specially after been injured for so long would be happy with coming to barca. And won't demand to be a starter. But that is just my opinion, we will have to see what happens.  Have you read the articles at http://www.barcablaugranes.com/ ? According you Renato Goncalves, who has really good sources at the club, it is almost certain that Gundogan will join Barca."

But saying he's never been stellar is kind of insulting to his massive contributions in the past.   Sorry I don't mean to call you out, but hopefully this isn't how most people feel about Pedrito ..."
Barca,395a9y,polechi33,8,Tue Jun 9 12:11:34 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind the injuries, the fatigue, and rotations. And who knows maybe Pedro surprises us? He is the best sub. His work rate is very high and we can use him as a mid too as Lucho did in many games"

Barca,395a9y,extrapao,3,Tue Jun 9 23:33:31 2015 UTC,Pedro didn't have the best start to the season but man he finished it pretty well for being a sub.

In previous games, Pedro has shown that he is a super sub who can fit right away. I also rated him high in both attacks and defences.   I also think Deulofeu is a flop if he's not the main man. I've seen him playing for Everton where Roberto Martinez tried to put him as main man, he rarely deliver (one exceptional occasion: when he scored against Arsenal to earn a 1–1 draw).   I'd rather have Tello back as backup for Neymar. His game with Porto against Sporting was phenomenal."

BUT HE LOVES THE CLUB AND THE CLUB LOVES HIM. Edit: The role Alves has in the dressing room is huge. He's always with Neymar and probably the biggest reason for his success. He's been friends with Messi since forever. He's the troll of the team and you need that.  Good to know that we're not another business model team, at least not fully. There is some hope left!"
Barca,395a9y,Marwanayman,18,Tue Jun 9 10:32:11 2015 UTC,"we're not another business model team   Honestly this is just good business.  His wages are high, maybe even too high given his age, however there is merit to rewarding players who have been on for a while and can continue to maintain their form.  This could have a knock on effect where a prospective signing will look and say ""well barca won't just drop me or try to ship me off the second I reach whatever age I am supposed to be dropped"""

Barca,395a9y,cdrawesome,4,Tue Jun 9 13:19:25 2015 UTC,"Even tho it's not really apparent, Pedro really loves the club, remember when Pep was in charge he was one of the main strikers along with Messi and Villa and now he only plays few minutes a year, anyone in his position would have left with no other thoughts and the best thing about him that he is such a great team player, I remember him passing the ball to suarez in open goals just to boost his confidence against weak teams and his assist in the CL final, any other player would attempt to score that but he gave it to neymar!"
Barca,395a9y,EvilNiko89,2,Tue Jun 9 15:06:12 2015 UTC,"I know Pedro loves the club.  We love Pedro.  My point is that Dani had better offers from other clubs for more money, I would also assume Pedro had some good offers too.  I am certain they both love Barca, but taken in the context of the totality of the discussion, they weighed leaving a great (greatest?) team to play for a good team and that was what really affected their decision most.  Again, it's business first and everyone knows it."
Barca,395a9y,cdrawesome,2,Tue Jun 9 15:08:54 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, they played in the most successful club in the history of football and whatever club they choose to go to they won't even get 1/4 of the trophies they won at barca"
Barca,395a9y,EvilNiko89,2,Tue Jun 9 15:19:47 2015 UTC,"Right - personally I would have made the same decision considering the options.  Going to AC Milan, for example, and playing in that league would be new and interesting but nothing compared to Barca.  That is why Xavi leaving has confused me.  I've lived in Qatar, it gets old pretty quick.  But maybe he wanted a change...I dunno."

Barca,395a9y,invice,2,Tue Jun 9 16:43:37 2015 UTC,"Let's hope so!   I personally think it makes more sense to just stay here, continue to be a fill in for our team in the next two years, then coach Barca B after that...but what the hell do I know I guess."

He may be staying for another year (ala Xavi) and then get sold when Sandro, Munir, etc. have more experience.  Dani leaving at this point doesn't really add up for anyone considering his wage requirements, age, and marketability.  Everyone having him stay - even though I can understand his qualms with the board.  Again, it's always business though and everyone knows it."
Barca,395a9y,NoFapMonster,18,Tue Jun 9 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"YES! 343 appearances and 19 titles - and fortunately the story doesn't end there! This is so important. It would have been a weakening of the team, if we had to play Montoya, Douglas or Bartra on the right back throughout the first half of next season.  Also, if the idea is that Aleix Vidal is our future right back, then Dani can help Aleix adapt to the position and the role over the next couple of season.  In general this is just great, great news for us!"
Barca,395a9y,e_schlanzz,26,Tue Jun 9 10:39:58 2015 UTC,"Lol Dani so dramatic. Renews on the final day and for TWO WHOLE YEARS. I love him as a player and the energy he brings along with his chemistry with Messi and Neymar makes him irreplaceable.   Also, I don't see Montoya staying now."
Barca,395a9y,babajafar,20,Tue Jun 9 10:37:43 2015 UTC,Fine by me. I love the fact that Alves is here to take Vidal under his wing (no pun intended) and show him how to work with Messi on that right side  Edit: and his locker room presence.  Unmatched.
Barca,395a9y,Christraegersspirit,9,Tue Jun 9 13:08:58 2015 UTC,Speaking of locker room presence...  Even Rakitic posted somewhere that he cannot imagine the locker room without Alves.
Barca,395a9y,darthvader7888,14,Tue Jun 9 15:38:59 2015 UTC,"So happy dani is staying longer. One of my favourite players and still one of the best in the world at his role, plus the chemistry between him and Messi on that right flank is invaluable. Visca el Barca!   Seems like a two year deal plus an extra year optional."
Barca,395a9y,mrnoor,11,Tue Jun 9 10:35:51 2015 UTC,Wow. Good news. If he starts sucking again Lucho can always give him the Pique treatment now that we have Vidal.
Barca,395a9y,zizzor23,8,Tue Jun 9 10:47:53 2015 UTC,"Best news all day! What do you guys think about this thought? We can't possibly have Alves, Montoya, Douglas, Adriano and Aleix Vidal.. Ooh and the talks about Pedro being schooled to RB are out the window now"
Barca,395a9y,UsernameAlreadyUsed,6,Tue Jun 9 10:53:01 2015 UTC,Thank god the Pedro to RB threads can end now. I never really saw a point to those discussions
Barca,395a9y,polechi33,3,Tue Jun 9 14:24:32 2015 UTC,"Douglas is not capable of performing well, he never will. Both should be sold or at least go out on loan, we still have Adriano as a third choice being the utility player that he is and even Bartra could fill in."
Barca,395a9y,cdrawesome,4,Tue Jun 9 11:44:55 2015 UTC,"I think we will sell Montoya and Loan Douglas. Hopefully Douglas does a decent job, so in a year's time we can sell him and get some money back. I think Adriano will stay, at least one more year, after that I can see Grimaldo taking his place."
Barca,395a9y,polechi33,2,Tue Jun 9 12:15:54 2015 UTC,Adriano can back Dani up until Vidal can permanently.  Then Vidal will take over in two years.  Other than that I don't see the point in keeping Montoya or Douglas...sell them both while we can.  If we loan then we have to pay their wages.
Barca,395a9y,cdrawesome,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on the deal, sometimes the team which is loaning the player pays his wages and sometimes is the team which receves the player. It depends on the deal. Also I think we should loan Douglas, not because I expect him to play for us, but because if he plays for a year we could make a better sell in a year. Honestly, he hasn't played this year, how much we could get for him? It is better to loan him and hopefully his price will increase a bit."
Barca,395a9y,polechi33,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:23:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  By how much would his price increase?  Not enough to warrant a loan where we would have to pay his wages.  He was a stop gap for Dani and Montoya in the beginning of the year, he served his purpose and won a Treble, it's time for him to move on.  Chances are if he goes out and plays mediocre, or worse, doesn't play well at all, the number will be the same to sell him.  There is nearly a 0% chance he will improve drastically enough for us to make our money back or receive a profit from such a transaction."
Barca,395a9y,elbossohogo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:06:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know, if he does a decent job maybe he can be sold for 2 mi. Why do you keep insisting on us having to pay his salary? That is not a set thing for loans, it has to be negociated."
Barca,395a9y,cadrianzen23,3,Tue Jun 9 15:43:04 2015 UTC,"I think a Douglas loan is the best move, and Montoya I don't think should be a part of the club anymore.  Might be that there were reports of an attitude problem with Montoya but ever since he's kind of come off as a dick.  Like in practice videos and such, but moreso during the treble celebration when everyone was happy he looked like he refused to clap for other players when they got the mic.  Sorry for the tangent, I don't hate Montoya but I think he's done son."

Barca,395a9y,cadrianzen23,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:16:20 2015 UTC,The fact that he has been garbage whenever we saw him and that he wasn't even considered a good player in Brazil? He is not Barcelona quality and it's unrealistic to assume he will ever be.
Barca,395a9y,UsernameAlreadyUsed,-1,Tue Jun 9 21:26:31 2015 UTC,How many times did we see him to where you could assess that?
Barca,395a9y,cadrianzen23,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"Enough. Some things are evident. Like I said, when even fans in Brazil did not rate him, how could we expect him to come good? It's improbable at best. He's also not some young talent, he's 24, he should be good already, but he isn't."
Barca,395a9y,UsernameAlreadyUsed,-1,Tue Jun 9 22:34:14 2015 UTC,"Right, so you're talking shit and are basing it on nothing.  I'm not saying he's stellar or even Barcelona quality, but you're severely underrating him like everyone was when that circlejerk was going on at the beginning of the season. It's irrational and annoying.   ""No one in Brazil likes him. Why should I?"" Nonsense argument."
Barca,395a9y,jairzinho,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:52:46 2015 UTC,"And you're downvoting someone you're arguing against, pretty childish. I'm not saying anything about 'liking' him, it's rating him. Big difference. I'm not irrational, I have seen nothing from him that makes me even the slightest bit optimistic that he's here for the future. I'm basing my opinion on the games that he played here."
Barca,395a9y,Jelboo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:20:47 2015 UTC,"I think that Montoya and Douglas are definitely gonzo, as is Adriano. Aleix can play RB with Dani and Grimaldo can back Alba up (along with Mathieu and Vermaelen."
Barca,395a9y,IhateAngryBirds,9,Tue Jun 9 14:36:58 2015 UTC,Awesome! An iconic player. He redefined the fullback position and has won so much with and for us.
Barca,395a9y,e_schlanzz,6,Tue Jun 9 10:38:35 2015 UTC,"First time Dani has proper competition for his position too, this is great, it will definitly get the best out of Alves"
Barca,395a9y,choss,2,Tue Jun 9 10:57:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think Aleix was brought in to compete with Dani.  Enrique wants Dani to teach Aleix the reigns.  Dani starts the majority of this season and the transition starts to occur next season, leaving Dani with the option to extend the contract and be in a Xavi-esque situation in his 3rd year"
Barca,395a9y,Robbzor11,7,Tue Jun 9 13:18:41 2015 UTC,"Amazing news, he is an amazing player but I think a lot of us are forgetting how important he is in the dressing room as well. He took Neymar under his wing and he is also Messi's best friend in there. Having him there is instrumental for the great chemistry of the team specially now that Xavi won't be there."

Barca,395a9y,sagrado_corazon,8,Tue Jun 9 11:04:28 2015 UTC,"Now we actually have a RB to challenge Alves, and he's not free to have shit performances, because then he'll be benched. He has had bipolar performances for a couple of seasons now, and has only really performed greatly during 2015.  If he loses this form, I'd be happy to see Vidal instead."
Barca,395a9y,prateekdwivedi1,2,Tue Jun 9 11:34:46 2015 UTC,"I said this above earlier, but I don't think Vidal was here to challenge anybody.  Dani will play the majority of this season while teaching Aleix the role he has to assume.  The actual transition starts to occur 2 seasons from now, with Aleix starting to see more and more playing time, leaving Dani with an option to come back for a 3rd year, knowing full well he'll be in a Xavi-esque situation at that point."
Barca,395a9y,polechi33,3,Tue Jun 9 13:26:14 2015 UTC,"Well Vidal can't play for 5 months. And I imagine it will be good for him to learn from Alves in the meantime, get some of his experience, and more competition on that RB spot will be good for both of them."

Barca,398wdv,Fifaman10,11,Thu Jun 11 04:23:09 2015 UTC,Montoya still has potential.  Cristiano Ronaldo is a top 5 all time forward.  Not renewing Abidal was the right thing to do.  Deulofeu is still our best forward prospect.  Mascherano should not be a captain.  We should consider offers for Bravo if they're good enough.
Barca,398wdv,gblr,16,Wed Jun 10 21:54:52 2015 UTC,neymar this season reminds me of cr7don'tkillme :x
Barca,398wdv,jl8912,14,Wed Jun 10 05:16:07 2015 UTC,"Neymar actually is the most promising player on the planet. Weird to say about someone who has just won a treble, scoring 39 goals in the process.  I think he has what it takes to become Messi level in his own style.  He needs to work on his passing and finishing. It is absolutely unacceptable that he hasn't delivered a single assist to Suarez this whole season. It's not like he didn't try... but his final passes were always poor.  I can't imagine what a player he'll become if he improves these two elements of his game."
Barca,398wdv,Duke--Nukem,6,Wed Jun 10 11:23:39 2015 UTC,"I feel confident his passing game will evolve over time.  He has already learned so much from Messi in the short time he has been at Barcelona, I hope he can keep his ego in check even after such an amazing season and keep learning."
Barca,398wdv,zazzlekdazzle,7,Wed Jun 10 13:50:38 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love his attitude. I was wrong about him.  The guy got even slapped by Xavi on the bus during the celebrations and didn't react.  His started the Messi wave on stage during Messi's speech... He declared that the Ballon d'Or has already an owner and that he only wishes to be on the podium... It's all great. Now, please work on that passing Neymar :)"

Barca,398wdv,Brompton_Cocktail,6,Fri Jun 12 23:43:46 2015 UTC,I think Neymar deserves more credit for what he has done this season.  The way people talk about how so much of his success is due to Messi  reminds me too much of what people  used to say how Messi couldn't perform without Xavi and Iniesta.  And I think it's OK that Neymar is not the world's best assister.  He does his job amazingly well and his ability to bring the ball forward with his dribbling is at the top level in the world.  His passing will improve with time.
Barca,398wdv,zazzlekdazzle,10,Wed Jun 10 13:55:20 2015 UTC,"A thread basically made for me! lovely! Lets go!  Pogba is massively overrated, and buying him would pull us even more in the direction of RM/PSG/Chelsea. I don't understand how people can support the idea of paying 90m for him.  He's not a Barca type player AT ALL, people just look at his status and potential, and think; ''WOW he has big potential, he can surely addapt our football, and learn many things, he's just 22!'' Some things you can't learn, but your born with. I can already see some aspect of the game where even Samper is better than him. Also; People think he'll replace Iniesta. Imagine a Pogba-Busquets-Rakitic midfield... Nope.  Mathieu's transfer isn't close to as good as people are making it. Take away his goal vs Celta and RM (I truly appreciate and respect him for those contributions), and he hasn't been special at all! He is poor on the ball, a poor passer, and he is not a smart player. When he plays he also has poor communication with others, and he'll often bump into them.   Thus scoring, what, 40 goals? Neymar still have been extremely wasteful, and missed very many sitters. I hope he'll become much better finisher, and he can definitely become a 55-+ goal a season player. I love that he's still young, and we're yet to see the best of him. So he'll defintiely improve.   Most will think this isn't an unpopular opinion, but after the Deportivo game, I can certainly say it is: Douglas is AWFUL, has no potential, and has nothing to do in this team.  And one last, just incase you haven't found a reason to downvote me yet: Roberto is a very poor player, and can only look remotely good vs small teams where he has no pressure at all. No control, no intelligence, no defensive/attacking skills. And I can't understand how people think he can compete for Xavi's spot.    ''unpopular OPINION thread''   Try not to forget that ;)"

I don't know If I agree, but I think while he has a ton of potential as of right now he's a bit overrated. A huge amount of his goals were tap ins. If we are gonna make fun of CR7 about it, we should be consistent. Still an incredible player of course, same as CR7, evidently among the top 10 in the world, but the tap ins make him look better than he really is. Suarez has been a way bigger help, and he has given him a bunch of assists that ended in their tap ins. So basically, while Ney's ceiling is super high, I think right now the number of goals is somewhat misleading, and he has a way to go still to be at Messi's or even Suarez's level."

Barca,398wdv,emasterman,3,Wed Jun 10 23:03:37 2015 UTC,"I think Messi would do well as a midfielder. Not as a false 9 but just as a pure midfielder. Maybe he'll be played there as time goes on, we'll see! But hoooly fuck the passes that Messi makes gives me boners on a regular basis. I thought Xavi was the king but some of Messis passes/plays are just...wtf? It's as if he sometimes has the vision of Xavi multiplied by 3!"
Barca,398wdv,Fandas,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:10:45 2015 UTC,"Haha I wouldn't say this is an unpopular opinion, Messi would probably do well anywhere on the field! When his pace falls off a bit further down the line I have no doubt that he'll sit deeper in the midfield for that outstanding vision and technique you mentioned."

Barca,398wdv,XsTream23,4,Wed Jun 10 13:07:05 2015 UTC,Neymar got really good skills but has unreliable finishing. I know he isn't too sloppy but a player with the prospect of being the next Ronaldinho shouldn't make awful mistakes in finishing.
Barca,398wdv,Football_Enthusiast,3,Wed Jun 10 11:30:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think his finishing has improved alot from last season, and now he is almost but clinical in his finishing."
Barca,398wdv,Mentosfruitcore,3,Wed Jun 10 15:07:03 2015 UTC,"He really has improved but he should be more precise in finishing, I know that he isn't a goal-poacher type forward but sometimes seeing his amazing runs towards the opponent box and finishing that with a poor shot disappoints me. But I'm hopeful that Neymar will excel even more at Barça than what he is now."
Barca,398wdv,Football_Enthusiast,7,Wed Jun 10 15:25:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't like Pogba in the champions league final, especially when he pushed Alves off the ball. He looks like the perfect Real Madrid player and not the type of player we need"
Barca,398wdv,hamed4321,23,Wed Jun 10 09:13:31 2015 UTC,"he apologized for almost every fouls he committed, like he knows that he should not fuck around with his future teammates..   would a rm player do that?"
Barca,398wdv,passion4indiegames,4,Wed Jun 10 10:07:05 2015 UTC,"True, I guess I am being too harsh on him"
Barca,398wdv,hamed4321,9,Wed Jun 10 10:13:05 2015 UTC,"it's weird but the final made me like him ! his fighting spirit, ability on the ball AND he can jump really high. I'd love to have him."

Barca,398wdv,JKapIsClueless,7,Wed Jun 10 07:32:27 2015 UTC,I think Hazard is better than Neymar
Barca,398wdv,DivineVibrations,38,Wed Jun 10 03:59:12 2015 UTC,"It's your opinion and you're entitled to it, but no way. It should be a crime to say such a thing."
Barca,398wdv,Unlucky_Rider,3,Wed Jun 10 05:42:29 2015 UTC,What's your reasoning behind that ?
Barca,398wdv,HippoNigga,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:12:22 2015 UTC,"Hazard is much much much more consistent, a better passer, and while neymar has been FANTASTIC, it seems like his stats are slightly inflated because Messi is just that good at setting his teammates up. How often do you see messi cutting in and playing an inch perfect ball over the top to either alba or neymar for an easy goal?  For me, they are the two best ex-youngsters(?) in the world, both top 10 overall, but i think Hazard edges it, i also think Chelsea's playing style in the second half of the season brought hazard down"
Barca,398wdv,DivineVibrations,9,Wed Jun 10 13:11:56 2015 UTC,"How do you explain Neymar's success with the national team ? He carried them through some shit, and Messi wasn't there."
Barca,398wdv,droid750,2,Wed Jun 10 15:00:11 2015 UTC,I've been saying this to my friends since January the same thing with the same reasoning. Neymar is being set up to be one-on-one on goal (sometimes without the keeper) in almost every single game - one area where Neymar is better I think is that he's more attack-minded.
Barca,398wdv,chillikebab,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:59:36 2015 UTC,I'm on the fence with Terstegen. People are saying he is the next great keeper but I can't help but notice that he seems to make mistakes and lack confidence at times.  In the CL final he got lucky with how he patted down a ball of a corner that ALMOST went into our goal. I still am not sold with him as a KEEPER where claudio bravo has made me feel safe.   There is no denying though that his ball skills are great and his start up play and distribution is top class. Still I worry if he lacks the actual goal keeping.
Barca,398wdv,rgadd,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:36:36 2015 UTC,"Cesc should have stayed. Or midfield should have been built around him. Cesc + Busquets + Masch, essentially a 4-2-3-1.apart from the occasional goal/assist This season are midfield has been anonymous in terms of offensive contribution."
Barca,398wdv,NahSoR,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:23:44 2015 UTC,"It's nothing wrong with the players in the midfield themselves, it's just that their defensive duties keep them creating like our MF used to. They help more in trasition now, rather than creating. But still:  Xavi 2 goals, 10 assist.  Rafinha 2 goals, 3 assist.  Roberto 2 goals, 1 assist.  Rakitic 8 goals, 10 assist.  Iniesta 3 goals, 8 assist.  Busquets 1 goal, 3 assist.  18 goals and 35 assists from the midfield isn't bad at all. Even though this may just look like peak Xavi one-season numbers alone. The midfield is different now. And I really doubt a double pivot with Cesc as AM would fix this in any possible way.   Actually, whenever we've played double pivot with Busquets-Mascherano, we've been horrible! And it doesn't help with Fabregas who puts in close to zero defensive contributions."
Barca,398wdv,Morcule,0,Wed Jun 10 16:57:05 2015 UTC,"Cesc had close to nil contribution in defense. Also, I think he was booed by the fans and felt like he wasn't being appreciated. That played a major role in him leaving, I'd guess."
Barca,398wdv,de4th_metalist,-3,Wed Jun 10 23:57:04 2015 UTC,I love Alves's play style and his personality but i think he should leave after this season just like Xavi :(

Barca,398wdv,jimtheguy69,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:55:50 2015 UTC,I don't really know. Its just my feeling he isnt going to play well next season like the last.
Barca,398wdv,phuongtv88,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:41:20 2015 UTC,"Ohh I see, well I think dani has one last season left and I'm sure he will play his heart out."
Barca,398wdv,jimtheguy69,-15,Thu Jun 11 02:48:46 2015 UTC,"I've said it before in the last thread here like this..  I think Suarez should have been banned for life after his third biting offense. Things like that have no place in this game.if it was his first, mayyyyybe second offense, then okay 4 months. But his third? Get outa here I personally never liked his character because of that (and the 2010 World Cup incident.) And I think if Pepe or Ronaldo had bit someone for a third time, plenty of people here would have been asking for their heads.   That said.. He, of course, was a HUGE part of Barcelona's success this season. I wasn't too sure he was fitting in the system well, and in some games he's still iffy on sustaining the mold, but his individual inspiration did create a helpful dynamic at times. So I can't knock him for that. Just those thoughts on what he's done tend to resonate in the back of my head, that's all.  Oh, and I'm not sure if this is unpopular but I think the people calling for Enrique's head in January shouldn't be allowed to celebrate Barcelona's successes or call themselves fans."
Barca,398wdv,fareswheel65,15,Wed Jun 10 08:59:26 2015 UTC,"That last part is where you lost me, anyone who claims that fans who criticized a player/manager who then turns things around aren't real fans loses any credibility in my eyes. Those fans had every right to want him gone, luckily things worked out the way they did and we all love him now."
Barca,398wdv,loqeh,-1,Wed Jun 10 09:23:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I think there's a big difference in criticizing the manager and demanding he be fired.. Everyone can criticize when it's warranted, which at the time it was, but to just jump ship and say he should be gone just a few months in despite being in serious contention for all trophies? Terrible in my eyes"

Barca,398thw,IhateAngryBirds,3,Wed Jun 10 12:30:54 2015 UTC,"ManUtd had a different type of deal than the rest, the takeout is less its not complete. The sponser gets a lot of the merchandise revenue.   Qatar and some other such sponsors don't take profit so the share is more helpful to the club, relatively."
Barca,398thw,iVarun,4,Wed Jun 10 13:18:49 2015 UTC,Isn't this only if the next board approve? And so far from what I understand all the candidates besides Bartomeu would oppose the deal
Barca,398thw,Aj16ay,3,Wed Jun 10 03:27:23 2015 UTC,"From the official website:   The Board was also informed of a proposal from Qatar Airways to renew the sponsorship contract that would continue their relationship until 30 June 2020.  This offer will be presented to the next Board of Directors, following the coming elections. Should the new Board give its approval, the proposal will then have to be ratified by the member delegates at the next Assembly, as set forth in the Club Statutes."
Barca,398thw,cdrawesome,3,Wed Jun 10 03:32:24 2015 UTC,"We should get more money than Man U period.  I would look for the board to find another sponsor with more cash to give in the near term especially considering what is going on with the 2022 games and FIFA.  Furthermore, it would be nice, in my opinion, to see a Spanish company like Iberdrola or Repsol on our shirt as opposed to Qatar Airways.  Having said that, people need to stop living in the past with UNICEF, the days of free sponsors and no cash flow from one of the most popular teams in the world is long over."

Barca,396cym,El_Barca,23,Tue Jun 9 16:20:36 2015 UTC,"Unbelievable how someone like Ivanovic, who failed to make it past a 10-man PSG, got into the CL squad of the season and Dani didn't."
Barca,396cym,fcueva-,11,Tue Jun 9 16:47:01 2015 UTC,"It's about which players that induvidually did the best job, not which players who was on the team that went the furthest. By your logic every player on the TOTS should be Barca players."
Barca,396cym,fcsnv,11,Tue Jun 9 17:08:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, and Dani was the best fullback in CL this season, dominating on his right flank."
Barca,396cym,Mentosfruitcore,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"My comment wasn't about who was the best, it was about the the mans reasoning behind thinking Ivanovic shouldn't be picked. I was hoping to see Dani in the TOTS too :)"
Barca,396cym,fcsnv,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:29:24 2015 UTC,By my logic? Dani Alves was far better than Ivanovic and by anyones logic should have been in the CL Squad of the Season. How can someone who didn't even make it out of the ro. 16 be performing better than someone who played til the final?
Barca,396cym,fcueva-,2,Wed Jun 10 02:15:38 2015 UTC,"I agree Dani did an amazing job. I didn't actually see Ivanovic play so I can't comment on which one should be in the TOTS. Perhaps Alves was better? What my earlier comment was about, however, was the flawed nature in your statement, saying that Ivanovic shouldn't be in the TOTS because he didn't make it to the semis. I'm not an expert or anything. I only watch Barca games (exept for internationals) so I'm not going to pretend I know who should, and who should not be in the team.  Edit: spelling"
Barca,396cym,fcsnv,5,Wed Jun 10 07:27:35 2015 UTC,"Well Pirlo got in, so I think this is voted by fans or something"
Barca,396cym,arayofhope,-2,Wed Jun 10 05:49:29 2015 UTC,"Well Pirlo got in   you're joking right? Pirlo may not be at the age where he is a complete powerhouse, but he is easily one of the best players for Juventus, whether he was invisible in the final or not."
Barca,396cym,fcueva-,4,Wed Jun 10 06:14:01 2015 UTC,"Lol what?  Have you even watched Juventus this year? The final was not an anomaly, Pirlo has been past it for Juve the past two years or so."
Barca,396cym,arayofhope,0,Wed Jun 10 06:15:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats why Pirlo has made over 100+ apperances in ALL competitions over the last 3 years. Please.  I guess they just start him cause he's absolutely useless and they just need to fill a starting role."
Barca,396cym,fcueva-,0,Wed Jun 10 06:17:45 2015 UTC,"Appearances have nothing to do with how well he has played...  Go ask the Juve fans, and see if they've been impressed with his performance this year."
Barca,396cym,arayofhope,0,Wed Jun 10 06:18:54 2015 UTC,"Ask fans? I'd rather ask Allegri, who actually sees Pirlo train and works with him day in and day out. I guess his start in the CL final was nothing but pity and luck."
Barca,396cym,fcueva-,0,Wed Jun 10 06:20:47 2015 UTC,"You just said yourself that he was hugely underwhelming in the final...  Like wtf man, is it that hard to accept that Pirlo has declined?  I can not believe that you actually think he was one of the top six midfielders in the entire CL season this year.  He's not even the best in his team."
Barca,396cym,arayofhope,-2,Wed Jun 10 06:26:20 2015 UTC,"When did I EVER say he was ""hugely underwhelming"" in the final? I said ""whether he was invisible in the final or not.""  I never denied Pirlo has declined, rather, I admitted it when I said he isn't a complete powerhouse anymore. And yet again, I never said he was the best in his team, I said he is easily one of the best players for Juve.  This has nothing to do with an affection for Pirlo. Simply, he, as well as many other players, deserve to be in the CL squad of the season. He made it, others didn't. I don't know why you're so mad and feel like you need to make shit up when nothing of the sort has been said."
Barca,396cym,fcueva-,0,Wed Jun 10 06:32:29 2015 UTC,"I think you're wrong. Pirlo has been one of the worst players in Juve this season. Since comparing midfielders with attackers and defenders etc isn't that useful, just compare him with their midfield. All the other three midfield-starters in Juve are superior/have been superior to Pirlo this season."
Barca,396cym,Mentosfruitcore,3,Wed Jun 10 14:44:07 2015 UTC,"I'm really happy that we dominated in every field. It really goes to show that we have a complete team. I do however think that Muller should be on there instead of Morata, and I'm not sure how I feel about Alba over Alves."
Barca,396cym,iniestas,2,Tue Jun 9 20:24:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, both Alba and Dani have been absolutely brilliant in CL this season, either one could've been picked."

You watch Busquets, you see the whole game."" - Vincente Del Bosque  It really sums up why people think that busquets is overrated, his game is so simple that others perceive him as not being that involved, when almost the entire game flows through him"
Barca,396cym,curious_cannon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:40:23 2015 UTC,Exactly. This sort of attitude pisses me beyond comprehension.

Barca,396cym,mekane84,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:09:24 2015 UTC,"Busquets has a much much harder role, and plays bigger importance in our team. Take Iniesta or Rakitic out of our side, and compare how we'll look, with without Busquets. The differance will be massive, because nobody gives us what Busquets does. You can say ''Mascherano?'' but we all know his level in that role, for us, isn't even remotely close to Busquets'. He constantly performs fantasticly, and IMO, was the real MOTM of the CL final. He, with Pique and Messi, is the most important players in our team.  It's your opinion though."
Barca,39767x,Chunky_mono,36,Tue Jun 9 19:15:14 2015 UTC,"The people who run La Liga once made up an ""MVP"" award to give to Cristiano after Messi was voted as player of the year in La Liga.  So yeah, this kind of thing never surprises me. But, who cares? Barça dominates their league and they have to eat a shit sandwich with every trophy that ends up in Camp Nou."

Barca,39767x,Andman22,11,Tue Jun 9 20:09:05 2015 UTC,Wow. I had to check and I can't believe they did that. And they didn't even keep up the charade by having the MVP award the next year either. So a one-time award to keep the cry baby happy. Just wow.
Barca,39767x,lookiebutnotalkie,6,Tue Jun 9 21:52:28 2015 UTC,Good to see La Liga adopting our Player Of The Month Other Than Messi formula.
Barca,39767x,xenmate,2,Wed Jun 10 09:04:29 2015 UTC,Who cares about these stupid awards anyway? Won't be surprised if the la liga 11 consists more of real players than barca. They did not even nominate messi for best forward last season. It is high time we stop caring about la liga awards.
Barca,39767x,Icarium_lifestealer,2,Wed Jun 10 08:18:45 2015 UTC,"If they gave us awards, it would be unfair. We would win most of them.  It would be like 50% barca 40% madrid 10% for the rest of the la liga players"
Barca,397whn,Lewisb23,15,Tue Jun 9 22:06:59 2015 UTC,It's really not even a question. He's simply not good enough for Barça
Barca,397whn,Aj16ay,14,Tue Jun 9 23:06:53 2015 UTC,He should stay with West Ham. No point in him riding the bench with us when he can start elsewhere.
Barca,397whn,lostkid182,10,Tue Jun 9 22:46:03 2015 UTC,West Ham actually wants to get rid of him. They loved him the first 6 months but he has been very lazy lately. There is no way he is playing for Barca.
Barca,397whn,JurijFedorov,2,Tue Jun 9 22:59:15 2015 UTC,Bilic will decide. Hammers are working on a big project.

As I'm gone on and watched football, I absolutely love the Barcelona football and have a strong love for the club. And with Dani Alves my favourite player in the world, I didn't know if I wanted him at Barcelona or to move to United. That being said, I'm still glad I'll get to watch him every week :D"

Barca,397gdr,Slaven4WHU,2,Tue Jun 9 20:20:28 2015 UTC,No way are we loaning players like alen halilovic and sergi samper to west ham. It would be a bad move for both the clubs. They can have deulofeu or adama if they want. For loan i mean.
Barca,397gdr,Icarium_lifestealer,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:27:22 2015 UTC,"Our youth players would be better off going on loan to la liga or the portugese league. They need to play in a team with a ""similar"" profile to Barca"

Barca,397gdr,Not_Tom_Brady,2,Tue Jun 9 22:21:11 2015 UTC,Would the style of play be good for them though? England is much different from the other leagues and the media would be pretty intense for a barca loan.

Barca,395e85,Illegal_sal,24,Tue Jun 9 11:16:59 2015 UTC,"We can say that he successfully passed the interview in Berlin.   During the final, I was laughing with my wife about him being kind towards Barca players, apologizing for tackles etc. Lol.   I hope we get him. But not for the reported 80m."
Barca,395e85,Duke--Nukem,11,Tue Jun 9 11:52:14 2015 UTC,I'd rather pay 150m than give him the ridiculous salary his agent's demanding.
Barca,395e85,darthvader7888,2,Tue Jun 9 11:53:34 2015 UTC,Really? What are his demands?
Barca,395e85,Duke--Nukem,11,Tue Jun 9 12:34:48 2015 UTC,"His agent wanted the second best salary on the team for him, only Messi would get more."
Barca,395e85,BlkSmoke,24,Tue Jun 9 12:38:04 2015 UTC,His agent can go fuck himself then. I hope for Pogba that he won't let his agent take shit decisions for him.
Barca,395e85,Duke--Nukem,9,Tue Jun 9 12:40:39 2015 UTC,"Relax, it's just a bluff to get Barca to sign. Agents almost always do this, it's to get the best deal for their player. I'm sure he won't cost 80m either. When you're trying to get someone to buy something for a certain price you almost always list it for higher, so you can talk your way down, and have the other person feel as if they got a bargain."
Barca,395e85,xFragg,4,Tue Jun 9 13:13:16 2015 UTC,I agree with you on this :)
Barca,395e85,Duke--Nukem,3,Tue Jun 9 13:14:20 2015 UTC,Yay :)
Barca,395e85,xFragg,4,Tue Jun 9 13:40:46 2015 UTC,"He will cost more than 80m. Juve have absolutely no interest in selling him, unless an ""offer they can't refuse"" arrives."
Barca,395e85,droid750,9,Tue Jun 9 14:25:03 2015 UTC,So let's send Don Andres to negotiate. XD
Barca,395e85,prateekdwivedi1,3,Tue Jun 9 15:42:49 2015 UTC,"He might have an interest in leaving, however, which at a certain point would make Juve want to sell. Keeping a player against his will is generally not a successful move."
Barca,395e85,DaWolf85,2,Tue Jun 9 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"When you're trying to get someone to buy something for a certain price   But they're not.  The principle you're describing holds true if you have a motivated seller: someone trying to get the best possible price for a sale that he actually wants to happen.  Juventus are an unmotivated seller.  They do not want this sale to occur.  The price is intended to deter buyers, not serve as a tool in negotiating the sale."
Barca,395e85,ravniel,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:25:53 2015 UTC,"Who's not to say Pogba doesn't want to come? Premier League is a no, Paris is a no, Real is a no, we won the treble and have Messi Suarez and Neymar. Who does Juventus have? I'm not trying to offend them, but we have a great team and we're making history. He's young and probably easily motivated to join us."
Barca,395e85,xFragg,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:02:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't say Pogba didn't want to come. That doesn't mean Juve want to sell him. I'm confused as to what point you're making, honestly."
Barca,395e85,ravniel,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:41:14 2015 UTC,"Like mentioned somewhere else on this thread I think, if Pogba wants to go, Juventus isn't going to hold him. The last thing you want in a club is having a player who has his mind set on another place. If he wants to go, Juventus know not many will accept the 80M, and will talk his price down. That's just my two cents tho, I don't know if this is the case with Pogba/Juve at all"
Barca,395e85,xFragg,2,Wed Jun 10 04:08:21 2015 UTC,"To be the second highest played player, it seems. His agent is trouble, I would much rather not go after Pogba becaouse of his agent, who happens to represent Ibra too."
Barca,395e85,polechi33,37,Tue Jun 9 12:39:14 2015 UTC,"Btw, keep in mind... that from today onwards, everythign you hear about transfer rumors is just candidates promising things, it's going to be some crazy weeks ahead of us with the election."

Barca,395e85,johan14cruyff,10,Wed Jun 10 05:45:22 2015 UTC,"Pogba is built like a tank, he has a really good physique. I have no doubt he's a good player, but how good are his passes and how well does his style fit with the Barca type of play?"
Barca,395e85,Phantomchrism,9,Tue Jun 9 11:36:19 2015 UTC,"Well look at this way... I would be petrified if I am a defender seeing Messi leading a fast break with Nemar, Suarez, Pogba and even Rakitic all running towards me...all of them capable of scoring from outside the box... I might even shit my pants.  He has that authority offensively... to me he was the greatest threat from Juventus side in CL final, whenever he got the ball I just felt uneasy. As for the defense, Barca play pressing defense as a team, and I think his physical presence is going to contribute greatly to the whole unit."
Barca,395e85,bezbol,6,Tue Jun 9 16:46:30 2015 UTC,"Agree completely on the uneasy feeling. I kept feeling and even saying ""Pogba please don't break our hearts before we even loved you."" I really think we'll end up getting him as the torch bearer after Messi-->Neymar-->. That shot he put on Ter Stegen from just outside the box had me shaking in my boots.   He is also pretty reliable on defense which some seem to overlook based on his offensive skills. They used him to mark Messi for at least part of the match, which is obviously a big compliment, and he made Dani look like a child when he won the ball back from him, which is sort of a compliment depending on which Dani is playing.   I really hope we get him. Future Ballon D'or winner I think. Could see him and Neymar fighting for it in a couple years."
Barca,395e85,LedZepGuy,2,Tue Jun 9 17:30:51 2015 UTC,"His strength and physique made a lot of our players look like children, I am not sure who can win shoulder to shoulder challenge against him..."

Barca,395e85,TimeFingers,6,Thu Jun 11 07:39:11 2015 UTC,From what I've seen he is a good fit. He was very good in the final I thought. He's fast as fuck too.
Barca,395e85,xenmate,8,Tue Jun 9 11:58:39 2015 UTC,His ball retention skills are incredible too. It's so hard to take the ball away from him. He just needs to work on his passing and the defensive duties and he will become the best midfielder in the world
Barca,395e85,Micste,4,Tue Jun 9 13:10:49 2015 UTC,"There is no better place to improve a players passing skills than FC Barcelona. He may not be complete now, but he's talented enough to adapt to every team. For the same reasons I was never worried about the transfer of Neymar."
Barca,395e85,marsh_randy,21,Tue Jun 9 15:48:21 2015 UTC,"Good, I much prefer Pogba for this Barca than Gundogan. He's fast, good vision, and a threat from outside the box. It's just what he need. A leaner, meaner version of Rakitic to pair up with the Croat or with Iniesta."
Barca,395e85,xenmate,23,Tue Jun 9 11:58:05 2015 UTC,"Rakitic has good vision and is a threat from outside of the box. We don't need an expensive Rakitic.   Gündogan is good at defending, dictating tempo, and also a great attacker. His vision, passing and final ball is much much better than Pogba's. His control is also better. He is also proven, and doesn't cost 90m.   Oh, and he doesn't bring a cunt of agent with him, that will only cause trouble."
Barca,395e85,Morcule,12,Tue Jun 9 13:04:51 2015 UTC,"It's not an expensive Rakitic.  If anything, Rakitic is a cheap Pogba.  Pogba is good at all the things you said about Gundogan, except not with a riddled medical history.  I doubt we'll pay that much for Pogba, but he is worth what we pay.  And for the love of god stop shitting on his agent, he's doing his job.  Agents represent the player in the best way they can, i.e. securing them the best contract possible.  His agent is demanding that he be paid so highly because Pogba is good and that's his job.  It's the (new) board's job to negotiate the fees and the wages so the two parties can reach a compromise."
Barca,395e85,e_schlanzz,3,Tue Jun 9 13:38:39 2015 UTC,"Raiola has a history of being a pain in the arse for us. He's not just doing his job, he's a problematic man."
Barca,395e85,EpicChiguire,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:02:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah sometimes I wonder who had the bigger head in that situation, Raiola or Zlatan"
Barca,395e85,e_schlanzz,10,Tue Jun 9 21:58:02 2015 UTC,"We need a player who gives us control. Pogba has a differnt set of skills than the ones we need on a midfielder. I am not against signing him, but we would need one more midfielder if we get him. Also he would stop the development of Rafinha, Halilovic and Denis Suarez. Finally, it seems clear that he is not willing to come in January, so do you plan to go a full year with Iniesta, Rakitic and Rafinha?"
Barca,395e85,polechi33,5,Tue Jun 9 12:38:02 2015 UTC,Denis Suarez is a Sevilla player and Halilovic will certainly be loaned out. He's not interrupting anyone's development as Rafinha plays a different style. Not to mention that Iniesta is 31. He's a star player for the future just like Neymar.
Barca,395e85,Marchisio,3,Tue Jun 9 12:56:21 2015 UTC,"We have a buy-back option on Denis Suarez, one which we will obviously use. In two years time, Iniesta will still be at Barca and the others who I mentioned will be ready for first team actions, if we have Pogba, where would they play?"
Barca,395e85,polechi33,5,Tue Jun 9 13:00:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that it will obviously be used, although I hope that's the case. Iniesta will have a Xavi type of season where he plays more as a sub than a starter. I hate to say it but honestly, if a La Masia product can't cut it then they don't deserve the minutes. We are the best team in the world and we can't simply settle for a lesser player because he's home grown. Yes, I think we should utilize the amazing youth system we have, but realistically it's not every single season that we bring up players that they will turn into Xavis and Messis and Piques. If Pogba is here and is better than Halilovic, Suarez, Samper, etc. then he should play above them."
Barca,395e85,Marchisio,4,Tue Jun 9 13:10:43 2015 UTC,"How are those young players going to prove themselves if you do not give them a chance? I agree that we can't just keep a player because he is from la Masia, that is why I think Sergi Roberto and Montoya should be sold.   And yes, buying Denis should be an obvious decision. Regardless if he stays with us or not, he is very talented and will be a good player. So worst case scenario, we buy him back and then sell him. We would make some decent cash for him.  Iniesta will have a Xavi like season? You do know that Xavi is 35 while Iniesta only 31, right? Iniesta has easily two more good years on him. And he will be a starter next season."
Barca,395e85,polechi33,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:30:26 2015 UTC,"If we bring in Pogba our midfield will be: Iniesta, Rakitic, Busquets, Rafinha, Pogba and maybe Sergi. Neither Denis or Halilovic will be here, maybe Samper as a sub for Busi. I think this is a great midfield that will give lots of minutes to everybody.  Iniesta is  declining. He has great games but he's not as consistent as he used to be. He had a pretty rough season but pulled it together luckily. He's only getting older and you decline pretty quickly once you surpass the 30s. I don't think he'll be starting every game after next season, which will leave some minutes for younger guys to show what they're all about.  We need to bring in another midfielder simple as that. Whether it's Pogba or Gundogan it's not a huge difference, I prefer Pogba though because of his physicality, ability to score from distance and potential to be one of the greats. Gundogan will be adequate and a great versatile player to have though."
Barca,395e85,Marchisio,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:15:01 2015 UTC,"It makes a difference, Pogba and Gundogan have different set of skills. It will depend on what Lucho wants, I guess."
Barca,395e85,polechi33,-1,Tue Jun 9 15:50:03 2015 UTC,"Also he would stop the development of Rafinha, Halilovic and Denis Suarez   FFS Pogba is 22! He is actually younger than Rafinha! You make it sound like we are buying an aging midfielder that will only be here for two years. Imagine if the board had the same mentality in 2013  and said ""Neymar would stop the development of some kid that might become the next Pedro"""
Barca,395e85,MayIHaveAHug,6,Tue Jun 9 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"We have no idea how Pogba would adapt to the Barca system until we see him play here, a lot of people had bad vibes about Suarez aswell and he turned out great."
Barca,395e85,Chillidawg,5,Tue Jun 9 11:44:36 2015 UTC,Exactly what I said on another post about Pogba. Everyone claims he won't fit the system but most of them have been wrong when they said that about Neymar and Suarez
Barca,395e85,Marchisio,8,Tue Jun 9 11:54:54 2015 UTC,"But the thing is, Neymar and Suarez are attackers, and don't have to excel in passing for example - they're both very good at it, no doubt, but with midfielders, we need someone who definitely excels in passing and keeping possession, or we will just end up becoming ""some good counter-attacking team"" and the philosophy will slowly be forgotten - in my opinion. At least that's my fears if we get someone like Pogba, who's great physically and attacking-wise, but he hasn't been raised with the passing philosophy and if the player isn't technically a good passer and has the vision to get out of sticky situations (like Xavi & Iniesta) without losing the ball, then I don't think that player is a good fit for Barca.  My point is, that while Pogba is an incredible talent, I don't think he's a good fit for Barca's system, and I'd much rather have someone like Verratti (yes yes PSG, we can't get him, bla bla) or similar types that excel in passing and vision."
Barca,395e85,kezorN,4,Tue Jun 9 12:52:13 2015 UTC,Spot on.
Barca,395e85,Morcule,5,Tue Jun 9 13:01:22 2015 UTC,"He's still young. Neymar's vision drastically improved in 1 year being here. In santos it was literally him just dribbling, with some short passes. Remember he learned from Messi. Pogba has Rakitic and Iniesta to teach him. The staff is still there, the possession based game is still there and always will be there. Enrique knows that, hell even Pogba knows. I honestly wish people would give him a chance, rather than say he doesn't fit. Maybe I am completely wrong, but you can't say he wouldn't fit, players like him (just like Neymar Suarez and Rakitic did) have the ability to be on our team, and learn the philosophy everyone cares about so deeply."
Barca,395e85,xFragg,4,Tue Jun 9 13:18:52 2015 UTC,"Rakitic is much much more a possession and passing player than Pogba though, so that comparison isn't that relevant imo. And I'm not saying that Pogba definitely wouldn't fit in, I'm just saying that I don't think he will be a good fit, for keeping possession for example.  I do agree that it would be nice to have some more physicality on our team, but not at the cost of technical ability in passing or vision - in my opinion you can see when players have a flair for passing and vision, like Verratti, but I've never looked at Pogba and thought, ""he sure has some world class passing and/or vision"". I think it's limited what can be taught when it comes to vision.  I wouldn't be unhappy with us signing him, because he brings a lot to the table for sure - but if he and his agent insists on him getting the second highest wages, then they can both fuck off :>"
Barca,395e85,kezorN,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:32:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly I've seen 10 games or so in which he's played. Like I said, he'll get better passing. Right now he's in Juventus, he can definitely get there by coming to Barça. I think we should both agree to not judge until he comes, because that's truly the only way to know if he fits in or not.   Also like I mentioned before, his agent is being a cunt to get the better deal for Pogba. If he wants 100K/week he won't flat out say it, rather he'll shoot high, so it can be negotiated down. Just like Pogba's price. They say 80m, but I'm thinking its more like 50-60m which for the most part is what everyone wants the board to spend on him. I just hope the new board can talk them down, and not actually spend the 80M+ second highest paid player. That would be dumb haha"
Barca,395e85,xFragg,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:40:24 2015 UTC,Indeed. Gonna be interesting to see who they end up signing.
Barca,395e85,kezorN,3,Tue Jun 9 14:04:09 2015 UTC,"And tbh Suarez's passing is not world class. It's just that we don't want him in a position to pass the ball, so his inability is not shown. The same will not be true for a midfielder."
Barca,395e85,invice,3,Tue Jun 9 13:03:18 2015 UTC,"Where would we play Pogba? He will be useful filling the spot Xavi played last year,  subbing on as he learns the system. However I'm assuming he wants a full time role."
Barca,395e85,the_maze,2,Tue Jun 9 14:25:28 2015 UTC,Iniesta isn't going to be able to start every game pretty soon. And lucho did a good job with rotation so I'm confident that we will be able to accommodate the addition of Pogba
Barca,395e85,kostkeon,2,Tue Jun 9 15:52:23 2015 UTC,I can see us buying Pogba for 70 million euros and including Munir on 2 year loan plus a buyout option.
Barca,395e85,wreckedhuntsman,2,Tue Jun 9 16:00:08 2015 UTC,"I think they should really go for Gündogan instead as it is more likely to happen than actually landing Pogba which would get REALLY expensive, plus Ilkay is a great player overall and would fit so good in Barcelona because his playmaking and passing technique is amazing."

Pogba indeed is one of the most talented young players out there and I want him to play great for Barça but I would be happy only if he comes to our club for less than what Barça offered (because I believe 80M Euro is too much).  I know that many will disagree and they think in modern football talented player should have really high transfer fee, but I disagree because I think for promising young talents who haven't proved/achieved so much, should never have such high price tag for transfer. Remember when Barça brought Ronaldinho (he was 24 probably) in '03 for 30M Euro, he already was a WC winner. I know inflation is there in the economy and since 2003 so many things have changed; Chelsea, Manchester City, PSG rose to power with their almost unlimited resource provider owners and I believe these clubs are the main reason behind this highly inflated transfer fee for signing new players."
Barca,395e85,Marchisio,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:51:55 2015 UTC,"He has certainly proved himself, he was a standout player this season for them in Italy and the CL.

Barca,395inw,SpoonOnGuitar,57,Tue Jun 9 12:04:22 2015 UTC,Pique.
Barca,395inw,DJWZERG,23,Tue Jun 9 12:14:16 2015 UTC,"Yep. Don't really understand why Masch is such a foregone conclusion in these kinds of threads. I'll be happy if he gets it but imo Pique should because a) seniority, b) he's been a rock solid leader himself and c) he's probably the best representation of Catalanism on the team currently, and that should be reflected in the leadership (yes I know Busi is Catalan but Pique is more vocal).  EDIT: Yes, I know Masch is passionate and talks tactics with Lucho (and did with Pep) in between breaks, that doesn't automatically make him the best choice for captain. Leadership is more than just shouting and looking intense, and almost all the qualities people talk about him having, Pique has too, he just happens to look calmer.   Pique matured a lot this year, and I think wearing the armband will help him more than giving it to Masch."
Barca,395inw,ohyeah_mamaman,9,Tue Jun 9 14:27:00 2015 UTC,Well if you look at Mascherano when the team scores a goal or if there is a break you will always see him talking with Louis so it makes the impression like hes the one who is more tactical
Barca,395inw,Hype11,3,Tue Jun 9 15:31:44 2015 UTC,It was same with Guardiola too I think. Even he used to interact with masche a lot.

Barca,395inw,5nakefork,11,Tue Jun 9 20:39:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree. The thing about Mascherano is, that he doesn't need an armband to take responsibility and lead his team. It just comes naturally to him, so he'll do it no matter what.   But with Piqué I think that officially making him one of the captains, he would try even harder to take leadership. I don't think it comes as naturally with Piqué, so if we could give him a little push it would probably work very well. He's been great this season, but I think that he could do even better, if we made it clear that we trust him and that we want him to be a leader."
Barca,395inw,Pek-Man,2,Tue Jun 9 15:36:52 2015 UTC,I agree. Pique needs a push. I would want him to take on captainship.
Barca,395inw,qgy683,17,Tue Jun 9 19:41:40 2015 UTC,"I like to think of Masche as the captain, without the captain's armband, whether it's here or on the Argentina NT."
Barca,395inw,xFragg,7,Tue Jun 9 13:20:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly correct IMO.  Armband or not,  Masche is a leader."
Barca,395inw,iReptaar,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:29:48 2015 UTC,"I've always held the opinion that the captain's armband is merely symbolic and not something that is completely authoritative. In the national teams they just give them to the best players, leadership qualities or not (Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar). On the pitch the players definitely know who to listen to.  Also i've always thought that the best position for someone to be captain is a CDM/CB, as they would always have a better position to read the game (IMO)"
Barca,395inw,curious_cannon,20,Wed Jun 10 07:49:49 2015 UTC,"I think Masche is the best and fair option, but Pique has had such a great year and has shown leadership on our defense.  I would be okay with Mascherano or Pique. Mascherano is such a studd that he doesn't need an arm band to be a leader."
Barca,395inw,polechi33,8,Tue Jun 9 12:53:09 2015 UTC,If seniority didn't matter Mascherano should be Captain.

Barca,395inw,pepetrillvia,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:27:40 2015 UTC,Probably Pique because he has the most active years and is La Masia product. Mascherano would be a great choice too.

Barca,395inw,VictorEremitaK,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:42:39 2015 UTC,"In many clubs, yes, but not here. Just look at the difference that Puyol and Xavi made. It wasn't just because they were good leaders, the armband, having the title of captain, made them use their leading qualities to help the team. It's like being good at a given task: You can do it every once in a while, but if you don't do it, it's fine. But if someone appoints that as your task and expects you to do it well, you will do it more often and with greater dedication. So the title of captain can be meaningless, but it can also be the opportunity to give natural leaders the position to make a bigger difference."

Barca,395inw,Zaratthustra,4,Tue Jun 9 15:28:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you are trolling or not, but in case you aren't then allow me to fill you in.  Xavi was our number 1 captain this season. If he was not on the pitch, Iniesta wore the band. Was he not present then Messi was in charge, and if he failed to show up then Busquets had the honor.  Regards to Argentina, Messi is the captain. I don't know the pecking order after him though."
Barca,395inw,Zaratthustra,2,Tue Jun 9 16:11:47 2015 UTC,"im not, i believe Iniesta at least in the field was our captain.  If you see (lets not sey tha whole run just the last two games) it was clear that Mascherano was the captain (hence my words of Messi being captain by name only) he was rallying the team, talking etc. Messi no.

Barca,395inw,fcsnv,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:20:09 2015 UTC,"In games were Xavi starts on the bench Iniesta is captain, because he is the vice-captain of the club AKA; the one that is captain when the captain is off the pitch. Since Xavi has been quite a lot on the bench this season Iniesta has probably worn the armband more, however, he is still the vice-captain. Haven't you noticed that if say Rakitic is subbed off for Xavi, Iniesta will give Xavi the armband even though he is still present on the pitch?"

Barca,396xyi,XsTream23,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:01:08 2015 UTC,"this is going to be a pretty big comment , sorry for that.  i ve been on this sub for quite awhile (almost half year i think) ,and i m glad i joined, the match threads are the best ones i ve ever seen ,credit to the mods for them , and also  the community here  is usually friendly   now to the point , i think the people around here have a picture of who my favorite player is ,due to the praising and posts i wrote about him  (Pedrito)  i think this season for the small amount of minutes he got he s done honorably well, best goalscorer + assister of the team only behind MSN (understandable) .  people on this sub have been quite harsh on him whole season long ,many times unfairly , criticising him for not making any impact when he got on the field which was quite ironic considering that the last games when he got on field as a sub he some great minutes filled with some amazing goals ( the bicycle kick spotlight of the season) and many assists or key passes . sure, some may argue that his contribution of the team in therms of goals may seem meaningless since the games he would be introduced on field would basically be over due to the quality of players we have on the team but i dont think it should take away some of the credit that he deserves for entering on the pitch with high spirit giving 110% of his energy for the team.  while it's true that the start of the season wasnt very good for him it was the case with the whole team, lucho experimenting , (i dont have to remind the first half of season how lucho was having a different lineup for every game)  i think he improved course of the season and i m super happy that he decided to stay with us showing character and love for the Club rather than personal glory.  i feel like there were many games in which he could have gotten on the field earlier or even play as a starter but sadly , he wasnt lucky enough i suppose , hopefully by next season he will play more.   also, to the people that hope for him to become superman magically over the night thinking about the days when he was in better form , they should take into consideration many factors such as playtime (he was a regular starter during that ""glory period "" 2009-2011)  , injuries (that made him drop in form)  and also the fact that the club bought superstars that costed him the starting position in the team, no doubt quality players but from a individual point of view, it made his progress a lot slower than he would have been, last year was a big example of how his form was improving benefiting from messi's injury  that made pedro a regular starter , he did really well for half of the season, sadly the other half was not so good but once again the blame should not be only on him, martino lost the team during that time and therefore we started getting into some terrible form + injuries.    even with that happening though, we were champions of la liga for 1 half, and only a wrong call from the linesmen from Leo's goal  made us lose the title on last match.  so as a ending,   i hope the fans will be more grateful for his contribution to the team and the fact that he decided to stay with us even though he could have easily become a regular starter on any other team and i also hope that when it comes to criticising a player (in this case him) they should take into consideration the factors i ve said.  Visca el Barca and Visca Pedrito"
Barca,396xyi,wwatermelon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:57:47 2015 UTC,I used to hate on Pedro all the time. At the end I'm glad he extended his contract.

Barca,396vxh,Flam1,14,Tue Jun 9 18:08:09 2015 UTC,Douglas should be sold this summer. Montoya sold or loaned in January
Barca,396vxh,Aj16ay,0,Tue Jun 9 18:13:32 2015 UTC,Nah loan Douglas.  Nobody will want to buy an average RB who's rode the bench all season
Barca,396vxh,e_schlanzz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:01:17 2015 UTC,"Why though? Either we loan him until his contract runs up, or try to sell him to a lower division team. By selling him we could at least recover a small amount(€1-2m?) And we wouldn't have to be bothered with loaning him every year"
Barca,396vxh,Aj16ay,3,Tue Jun 9 22:42:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying loan him every year.  I think actually we should just loan him this year, see if he can get playing time and show value, and then sell."
Barca,396vxh,e_schlanzz,0,Tue Jun 9 22:51:21 2015 UTC,show value   I don't think he'll do that. Whether we sell this year or next we're not going to get much money for him
Barca,396vxh,Aj16ay,5,Tue Jun 9 23:08:10 2015 UTC,"Listen, just because he's shit for us, doesn't mean that he's shit for every team.  I'm not asking for a profit on his transfer, but maybe we break even if we find the right team.  Remember he was only 4 mil"
Barca,396vxh,e_schlanzz,0,Tue Jun 9 23:14:47 2015 UTC,"Umm he really never was good for us, he was never even good for Sao Paulo because he's not a good player. That's why his signing was really weird"
Barca,396vxh,Aj16ay,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:34:16 2015 UTC,"yep, he is going to ride whatever wage we gave him. He wont accept a cheap move to another team because nobody will pay his wage"
Barca,396vxh,joesugarman,5,Wed Jun 10 16:33:49 2015 UTC,"Vidal seems like an useless transfer? The man can do a good job as a winger and now we have a proven player to cover for Alves (considering Montoya hasn't impressed a lot of culés and Douglas is not even an option) when we need someone for rotation/suspensions/injury, which is important because Alves is not getting any younger. Also Vidal will be able to learn from Dani while he's still at Barça.   IMO it's not an useless transfer at all and an important one to be honest."
Barca,396vxh,latino666,4,Tue Jun 9 18:57:02 2015 UTC,Well we have to remember that we can't use vidal immediately. I'm hoping by the time we are allowed to use him we will sell or loan both Douglas and Montoya
Barca,396vxh,TR1L0GYxx,2,Tue Jun 9 18:25:52 2015 UTC,Vidal is not a useless transfer at all.  Douglas should be loaned out and then sold in the winter or next summer and Montoya will probably be sold this summer.  This leaves Alves here to teach Vidal the ropes and let him slowly transition to the starting RB over the course of the next 2-3 years

Barca,395k4z,mettacitta,27,Tue Jun 9 12:19:05 2015 UTC,"Because Messi, Iniesta and Busquets came through La Masia. He'll probably become fourth captain I guess.  But Mascherano would be a great captain."
Barca,395k4z,fleamarketguy,11,Tue Jun 9 12:27:21 2015 UTC,He would be a great captain but I'd personally give that 4th spot to Piqué.
Barca,395k4z,Duke--Nukem,12,Tue Jun 9 12:30:01 2015 UTC,"Why? Although I like Piqué a lot, he can be too childish. Look at what he said about Ronaldo on Sunday. Yes I found it quite amusing, but Puyol or Xavi wouldn't have said something like that."
Barca,395k4z,fleamarketguy,17,Tue Jun 9 12:43:42 2015 UTC,I'm sure Piqué wouldn't have said that if he was captain.   Why Piqué? Because his passion for the club (as an institution) is comparable only to that of Xavi and Puyol. He's great with the fans and is becoming more of a leader. 4th spot  captain would be right for him and would do him good.
Barca,395k4z,Duke--Nukem,11,Tue Jun 9 12:48:02 2015 UTC,"Passion != leadership. We can't have someone who has had moments of switching off in the past (not this season particularly) be the one who's supposed to keep our boys disciplined on the pitch.   You don't become captain when the title is given to you. You have to earn it, and Mascherano sure deserves it more."
Barca,395k4z,fmn13,10,Tue Jun 9 14:40:37 2015 UTC,"He is slowly maturing, but not fast enough IMO to be named captain over Masch. Masch and Messi truly are the heart and soul of this team. Those two feature in almost every game. All the tactical instructions are given to Masch. Masch usually is in there breaking up scrums instead of instigating them.  Pique has shown more maturity in that sense--he's not longer the guy getting into people's faces after a bad foul, he's the guy breaking it up. I wish Busi would follow that lead."
Barca,395k4z,nannulators,3,Tue Jun 9 13:25:54 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind to have Pique as 4th captain for the next season. Why is he not right now? Probably the last few seasons he didn't show that he deserved it.
Barca,395k4z,oliver_newton,2,Tue Jun 9 13:12:06 2015 UTC,You have to act like a captain in order to become one on a team like this
Barca,395k4z,xavimafe,8,Tue Jun 9 12:49:45 2015 UTC,A bit of a banter in front of your fans after winning a second treble is cool for me :-)
Barca,395k4z,Duke--Nukem,2,Tue Jun 9 13:13:17 2015 UTC,Could you please recap what Pique said about my beloved Ronaldo. Apparently I missed something...
Barca,395k4z,marsh_randy,4,Tue Jun 9 14:26:23 2015 UTC,"I see where are you coming from, but Masche deserves it more. Personally I would like our four captains to be : Iniesta, Messi, Mascherano, and Pique."
Barca,395k4z,polechi33,5,Tue Jun 9 12:45:21 2015 UTC,"I also think that we could probably name Pique 4th captain, Masche is the man and doesn't need an arm band to be a leader."
Barca,395k4z,polechi33,3,Tue Jun 9 12:46:10 2015 UTC,No Busquets? That's a crime :(  Mascherano doesn't need to armband to be influential. Probably that's why he wasn't voted on last year.
Barca,395k4z,Duke--Nukem,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:12:11 2015 UTC,"Well we havd about 8 new players, who I assume voted for the obvious options. I think that if they voted again, the result would be different."
Barca,395k4z,polechi33,5,Tue Jun 9 13:55:02 2015 UTC,"That is not the real reason. Players voted at the begining of the season for the captains and perhaps they voted those three for the reason you mentioned. Also we had so many new players, who voted for the ""obvious"" options. I think if the voted again and taking into account the change Pique has had, I think that the four captains would be: Iniesta, Messi, Mascherano, and Pique."
Barca,395k4z,polechi33,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:48:29 2015 UTC,That would not have been the case at all since Xavi has been captain for years now.
Barca,395k4z,zizzor23,2,Tue Jun 9 14:19:02 2015 UTC,"No, last year the captain was Puyol and se vice-captain was Xavi. So.. yes after Puyol left, it seemed the obvious that Xavi would be selected the main captain. Iniesta, who was third captain became the vice-captain. So those are obvious options."
Barca,395k4z,polechi33,2,Tue Jun 9 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"Sure, we can get technical about it. I just don't see how Masche or Pique would take a spot over Xavi. That's the issue I have with your comment. He's a club legend, well-liked by the players, and a leader for us. I don't think either Pique or Masche would feel comfortable being named captain over Xavi."
Barca,395k4z,zizzor23,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:56:50 2015 UTC,I never said that either. Sorry if I was not clear enough. Probably this year Xavi and Iniesta would still be 1st and 2nd options and perhaps Messi 3rd. But I do think Masche would come ahead of Bsuquets.
Barca,395k4z,polechi33,2,Tue Jun 9 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"In reality, he's already been a captain in the field. The armband is more of a symbol. That said, he deserves the recognition."
Barca,395k4z,canadian028,7,Tue Jun 9 13:15:20 2015 UTC,"I would say Mascherano is a real leader on the pitch, but definitely not the only one. Maybe Puyol embodied every aspect of what a great captain is -- the leader, the figurehead, the father, the coach -- but I don't think any single player is all of those things on the team now.  One of Mascheranos great characteristics is that he doesn't need the armband to be a leader and a boss.  Maybe he cares, maybe he doesn't.  I can't speak about Iniesta, but Xavi and Messi have also been great leaders and captains, just in different ways.    It's probably obvious what Xavi brings to his leadership, and maybe Iniesta brings something very similar. For Messi, this leadership aspect is new for him, but I think he is good at it.  This season I think we have all seen how Messi can run a match and how the team follows and respects him.  He also gets in there with the refs and even was intervened physically when Godín was going to make himself some Brazilian barbecue with Neymar a few weeks ago.  I don't know if you saw the Messi speaking during the celebration on Sunday, but even though he was probably pretty drunk, he was very poised and really spoke like a captain -- about how the team have picked themselves up from a bad season last year, working through issues this year, and why this triplet was something to be especially proud of.  If Mascherano feels that he wants that recognition, then I think there should be a way to find it for him, but I don't get the impression that he cares that much."
Barca,395k4z,zazzlekdazzle,5,Tue Jun 9 13:21:02 2015 UTC,"I dont think it really matters. I know some places care about it more, but the armband is mostly just tradition and prestige. Not having it doesnt stop him from being a leader."
Barca,395k4z,ChinggisKhagan,3,Tue Jun 9 12:44:27 2015 UTC,"Based on his performances and attitude last season, Pique deserves the armband. But so does Masche and I would love to see Masche with the armband. But the beauty of Masche is that he doesn't need an armband to be a leader. He's a natural leader and both Pep and Lucho realized this and thus have been seen talking to him on the sideline during matches often.   Think of Masche as being the unofficial leader that the whole team, including coach, acknowledges. Besides, the system now is that players vote the captain so rest assured whoever is the new captain will be approved by the players themselves."
Barca,395k4z,cdn_brcafan,2,Tue Jun 9 13:46:16 2015 UTC,he hasn't been in the team longer than the la masia players and he is more likely to be benched in the future.
Barca,395k4z,Mr_Anderssen,2,Tue Jun 9 17:22:04 2015 UTC,Some players dont need an armband to be a leader
Barca,395k4z,Afghan_,2,Tue Jun 9 21:02:14 2015 UTC,"I think the most interesting answer to this question would be that he is considered a captain. Officially, he isn't a captain, but by the team, the fans and the coach(!) he is definitely viewed as a captain."
Barca,395k4z,palmandy11,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:50:27 2015 UTC,"Mascherano is the defensive captain and has been for a long time.  Remember all the goals we've scored since 2011 to have the camera pan back to see Masche talking with Pep, Tito, Tata, and Lucho?  As for the ""real"" captains: Iniesta, Messi, Busquets, Pique."
Barca,397km6,Football_Enthusiast,2,Tue Jun 9 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"When I saw it it was being explained in Castellano (normal spanish), but that video is in catalan spanish, and I can't tell what they're saying because I only speak castellano.  But I remember it as kids playing and being happy about the treble, and one says ""immagine if we where in camp nou right now"" and the other one says ""you are being delirious"" (closest translation I could find to ""tu flipas""). ""Then one says close your eyes and immagine you where there now"", and they start singing with the fans and then an old man comes in and starts telling stoires, and the whole thing ends with him telling them to go to bed, so they go to sleep and that weird song starts.

Barca,3967dt,chordnine,5,Tue Jun 9 15:26:25 2015 UTC,"our keeper situations is both good and awkward , for one side we probably has our best transition between our main keeper leaven and a new coming in our History (at least in the last 20 years), for the other side both are great and deserve the role of starter but i feel the sooner we put Ter Stegen in charge of the league season the better, he is gonna be our first keeper anyway why not doing so next season."
Barca,3967dt,Zaratthustra,5,Tue Jun 9 15:53:33 2015 UTC,I would simply switch. Ter Stegen gets La Liga and Bravo gets Copa and CL. If Bravo's form drops than give it back to Ter Stegen.
Barca,3967dt,brocccoli,2,Tue Jun 9 16:18:05 2015 UTC,When I first read that I thought it too arbitrary an idea but I after a bit of thinking about it I like it.  But I wouldn't be too quick to replace Bravo with Ter in all competitions.
Barca,3967dt,elanciano31,2,Tue Jun 9 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer if Ter Stegen got the Copa as well, to be honest. At some point we're going to have to start giving Ter Stegen the appropriate game times. If Bravo is ok with it then maybe in 16/17 we can do what we did with Pinto."
Barca,3967dt,Seffor,2,Tue Jun 9 21:12:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Ter Stegen's distribution and ability to play with the ball at his feet was a major part of our CL success. Although he had his nervy moments he kept us cool when we were pressed hard by some of the best teams in Europe. Bravo, amazing as he was in la Liga, can't offer that."
Barca,3967dt,Gaberam7,2,Wed Jun 10 00:52:58 2015 UTC,"Whichever keeper gets the league, the other should get everything  else: copa, ucl, both supercups, and the club world cup."
Barca,3967dt,gblr,2,Tue Jun 9 21:23:17 2015 UTC,It is not a problem. I bet ter Stegen would rather win CL each year than play all the games.

Barca,3967dt,broad_h2o,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:24:43 2015 UTC,Let him leave then if he is not pro Barca. Lent him to West Ham for 2 seasons until Bravo gets old. Easy.
Barca,3967dt,JurijFedorov,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:47:26 2015 UTC,"I think give the copa to bravo and the UCL and Liga to Ter Stegen. Yes Bravo did well in the league, but compare the average quality of opponents and importance of matches that both of them faced. Ter Stegen has ""world's best"" potential and that can only be realized by actually playing more."
Barca,3967dt,ksalama,-2,Wed Jun 10 07:13:09 2015 UTC,"I expect Bravo to leave either this summer or in January following the transfer ban. His decision to go to Chile for the Copa rather than spend an extra day celebrating the treble with the team speaks volumes to me. MaTS is the keeper of the future and everyone knows it. We will likely use him and Masip the way we used Valdes and Pinto, MaTS will get CL and League duty, Masip will play in the Copa."

Barca,3947hs,arijitlive,10,Tue Jun 9 04:23:11 2015 UTC,Neymar will share the Golden Boot for the CL with Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Barca,396qmg,lebronsucks123,3,Tue Jun 9 17:34:07 2015 UTC,I think it obviously depends up on Alves' vs. Vidal's form. I will say that I hope Vidal gets some playing time so he can develop.
Barca,396qmg,SubjectAndObject,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:49:03 2015 UTC,"If Vidal does get a chance to play, I hope he shows up big. It would be great if he happens to grow into a better player than Danilo. But that's just the bitterness talking."
Barca,396qmg,Seffor,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:06:06 2015 UTC,"The ideal scenario for me is for Alves to start about 80 percent of the games this year and have the transition to Vidal to occur gradually over the next 2 years, so that by the time Dani decides whether to extend the contract or not, he is in a Xavi-esque role.  Leader of the team, even though he plays limited mins"
Barca,396qmg,e_schlanzz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:06:59 2015 UTC,I think both Dani and Vidal should split playing time in the second half of the season; but how will they perform in the field will also influence the decision about who should start. I think since Dani is more experienced he should be given the first priority.

Barca,392m7q,johan14cruyff,3,Tue Jun 9 05:47:49 2015 UTC,He was tied for most assists in the Premier League with Gerrard in the 13-14 season. You are wrong.

Barca,392m7q,johan14cruyff,5,Tue Jun 9 06:00:02 2015 UTC,Is there alt angle available for Neymar's last goal vs Juventus?
Barca,392m7q,_FRANKENSTEIN_,4,Mon Jun 8 21:16:56 2015 UTC,"Lovely finishing.  I was just struck by how Suarez celebrates every goal as if it is his own, and Messi is almost always like, ""yeah, of course this should go in, no big deal""."
Barca,392m7q,sriramalka,2,Tue Jun 9 06:10:15 2015 UTC,he is so incredibly accurate with those shots to the side netting. He must really be a complete nightmare to deal with as a keeper
Barca,392m7q,tact8t88,2,Tue Jun 9 06:41:38 2015 UTC,"I really like that play where Messi sends a long ball diagonally over the defenders for Alba who puts it straight to the box with his first touch. We saw it in the Juventus game a couple of times too, first resulted in the opening goal and the second (Alba's pass) was just barely blocked by a Juve defender."
Barca,392m7q,vanNostrandby,2,Tue Jun 9 06:42:59 2015 UTC,"That happenes almost every game game this season. Messi has been creating those diagonal defense splitting balls to Alba so much it's just ridiculous. Most of the time Alba doesn't even have to control the ball, that is how incredibly accurate those passes are."
Barca,392m7q,watafaq,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:20:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it does, that's why I wrote ""too"". Messi even played those balls to Mathieu when he was the LB."
Barca,392m7q,vanNostrandby,2,Sat Jun 13 08:37:23 2015 UTC,Looking at this video it's almost impossible to believe that this Messi guy scored 58 of his own... And then there's still Suarez.
Barca,392m7q,ineeddineros,2,Tue Jun 9 07:57:22 2015 UTC,The best part about this video is every time he scores Messi and Suarez either run to him and hug him or immediately start celebrating. A selfless front 3 who only want whats best for the team.
Barca,392m7q,OverWeightPandas,2,Tue Jun 9 08:24:39 2015 UTC,Imagine if he didn't miss all those gimme he's missed this year. The goal tally for neymar could easily be 60

I think you've jumped the gun by calling these videos ""similar""...  edit: not defending the editing of these specific goal comps. they're pretty meh. But if there were three excellently edited comps of 2014-15 season goals for Suarez, Messi, and Neymar, I'd just hope that the mods would let them stand and let the upvotes rain upon them as testaments to their skills."

Go to their subs act you will find almost everyone saying that their full health squad could VERY EASILY beat our squad. I can't seem to understand if they have forgotten their pathetic performances against other teams, how Real was fucked by Schalke at their precious home, house they failed against Atleti everytime they faced them, how they lost against Valencia, house Bayern lost against Dortmund in the cup semis, how they lost 4-0 at their own home Against a pretty weak team, how their constant injuries were to blame on their style, even after having a squad who could field two world bearing teams, how Real's rotations were nothing.  All this and I have not included how e dominates Real in the air as well as on counters, how we defended amazingly this whole season, how lethal we were on attacking, how Real could have lost 4-1 5-1 in the home leg. They are so blinded by hate that they would say anything to discredit us of the winners we did.   I saw a Real turd commenting that their squad was the BEST squad, who broke the most records, forgetting that it was our squad which scored the most, conceded the least, had the best trio, won fifty out of sixty games, had the best winning percentage of all time, and ask this when we faced most probably the toughest teams in each leg of the CL. I am just fed up of these people.  Tl;Dr: Rant"
Barca,393a3a,invice,45,Tue Jun 9 04:51:03 2015 UTC,"As a bayern fan, though I do think the semis could've turned out differently without injuries, I still wouldn't dare say bayern are or were the overall better squad. Congrats on the treble. Also real turds a shit."
Barca,393a3a,gotzil,22,Tue Jun 9 09:04:16 2015 UTC,"I seriously respect your club even after the thrashing you gave us and I am a regular reader of your sub. But the current attitude of Bayern fans saddened me, as people there were blatantly saying that Barca did not play well, only the injuries gave us the treble. I know the semis would have been more interesting. You never know. But at least do not discredit us of what we have done. We played spectacular football in every match. Such display is rarely seen these days. Pep 's barca, heynckes Bayern are the only two teams in the recent times that come to mind when you talk about brilliant display. I just wanted a little bit of respect that's it."
Barca,393a3a,invice,12,Tue Jun 9 10:21:02 2015 UTC,"Do you have sources for what you say about Real and Bayern fans ? I checked their subs and the only posts I could find saying that Barça won only because of injuries were downvoted to oblivion. Of course they are confident that they can win next year but overall they seem to agree that barça was the best team this season (I mean, that's a no-brainer).   Of course you will find some shitty comments everywhere, even on this sub when Barça loses, but I personally think that comments on /r/soccer and team subs like /r/realmadrid and /r/fcbayern agree to say that Barcelona was unbeatable in the second half of the season and that we deserve our titles."

Big big big big big shout out to the coaching/fitness/medical staff who have kept us the most fit team this season. Every game I've always thought that even if we didn't score in the first half, we'd score in the second through either the quality of our players or the fact that the other team will be dead tired."

Wtf how can they be so ignorant when they are basing their arguments on it?
Barca,393a3a,invice,5,Tue Jun 9 15:27:44 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right, these so called fans are just disturbed by Barça's success and this is why they won't give Barça the credit for this wonderful accomplishment. They are claiming that Barça was lucky, I say being fortunate is a very important factor but it won't get a team straight 3 major trophies in a single season. Where were these losers 2 years ago when Barça were blistered with numerous on-pitch/off-pitch issues and struggling in all the competitions?   Are Real Madrid fans thinking that bringing all the high-profile players in the club makes their squad the best? Sure, based on the total value of the team but buying only the best player don't guarantee success which has already been proved their home game Schalke 04 (I seriously thought that Schalke would advance to the quarter-final).  I have no disrespect towards Bayern but some of it fans (they claim that they support Bayern before '10 but I think they started after '13 or some may be after WC '14) are absolutely disgraceful towards other teams. Winning Bundesliga and a decent UCL run is a really bad season for them so they want Pep out; they lost to a rather weak BVB in DFB-Pokal (they were a bit unfortunate I'd say) but still claim that if they had a fully fit squad they would thrash any team in the world is a bit arrogant gesture. I remember them losing to Real in both of the legs in '13-'14 UCL with their first starters or was that Pep's fault too?"
Barca,393a3a,Football_Enthusiast,5,Tue Jun 9 10:58:10 2015 UTC,"See, I don't give a rat's ass about other clubs and I know that I can't change their opinions. But the thing that hit me too hard was that goal.com article, and then seeing everyone convinced that all this was luck  people forget the magical display we put in week in week out. It's just a rant.   I mean, our coach and our main players were missing when Bayern thrashed us, but we never cried. Ask most Barça fans and they will say that Bayern completely undid us. We accepted that humiliation without any complaint. But now they can't accept our team 's magical display?"
Barca,393a3a,invice,3,Tue Jun 9 12:07:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, in '13 Bayern did better than us and we simply accepted that without making any excuses and now that we won treble some bitter fans from other clubs are saying we were lucky, if fact I'm quite pissed seeing even some Manchester United fans being unhappy about Barça's treble victory (they remember the last two UCL encounters where Barça outperformed MU both of the time).

So have others like Piqué, Alves and Busquets. Neymar is maturing.   Also, whenever we've lost games, we've come back much stronger and ensured that mistakes aren't repeated. Player fitness has been very important as well.   It's been an absolute pleasure watching them this season.   As for the summer, looking forward to the Copa America!   Cheers. Visca Barça!"

My biggest fear is lack of drive, but I hope Suarez's and Lucho's influence will help keep us motivated. It helps Neymar is relatively young too, and we should end up with Pogba or Rafinha in midfield quite regularly helping the team keep a hunger for titles."
Barca,393a3a,xenmate,13,Tue Jun 9 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the team will lack drive. Look at the joy of Xavi, Iniesta or Messi winning their 4th CL, they will never stop to give everything to win more. They are living for titles. Personally my biggest fear is injuries, it is the biggest threat to our team imo."
Barca,393a3a,henrax,5,Tue Jun 9 11:56:03 2015 UTC,"Completely agree.  Plus, extra motivation lies in the fact that no team has defended their CL title successfully since the switch to the current format, and you'd be crazy to say that this team doesn't have an adequate chance of doing that"

But I would question that the drive goes down.  I would say the drive stays the same, or grows, but so does the drive for other teams when they come up against us.  Next season, we aren't just FC Barcelona, we're European Champions FC Barcelona.  We'll have an extra target on our back, just like Real Madrid did last year and Bayern the year before that.  It's hard to defend the CL title because it's a long tournament and no opponent can be underestimated, especially when they have a chance to knock off the Champion."
Barca,393a3a,e_schlanzz,4,Fri Jun 12 13:49:23 2015 UTC,"The last three seasons the drive had died down quite a bit, so yes, it's always a concern."
Barca,393a3a,_sic,7,Fri Jun 12 13:57:11 2015 UTC,"I think the challenge will be developing consistency.  One of Lucho's biggest problems in 2015 has been not having any like-for-like subs, other than Xavi for Iniesta. Especially in the front line - there's no backup 9 behind Suarez and nobody who can replicate the dribbling of Neymar and Messi, which is so key to our system. Youth players could be key in that regard, being molded as understudies.  How Lucho deals with the youth is going to be crucial, especially in midfield. Does Rafinha start more frequently? Does Denis Suárez come back? Are both able to learn the system with a bit more discipline? Is Samper converted from pivot to CM - if not, what's his future with Busi here?"
Barca,393a3a,egcg119,19,Tue Jun 9 19:22:05 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest, single, difference this season has been Lucho, He rounded up the troops, got them into shape, got the best out of everyone, had rotations, fixed the Defense (with Unzue of course) changed our philosophy and here we are.   What we can improve on? Not letting teams adapt to stop us, which is why our old style (what I like to call Total Football Possession style) died, since everyone adapted to stop it. So continuing our fluid style and ability to play and beat teams.   This summer, Ill be watching the U20 World Cup (lets go USA!), the Copa America and the Guinness Champions Cup."

Barca,393a3a,godie,3,Tue Jun 9 04:09:35 2015 UTC,"No, the main reason why it died was because of Xavi, Puyol and Abidal aging, Pique and Pedro losing form, Villa getting injured and lack of motivation after winning so much."

Barca,393a3a,beastcat,5,Tue Jun 9 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"So! This team has come along way,  Luis Enrique has proved to be one of the best decisions throughout the season. He had doubters, coming from a celta and not much experience/ difficulty with roma as well.  but he has proved and brought life in to the players and our philosophy. He has managed bring out the best of Neymar.  He has managed to incorporate Luis Suarez in to the team after a lengthy ban and has had an exceptional mini season! He has given Messi more space to carry out all of his magic tricks!  He has helped create great chemistry between our trident and help built the best attacking trio in the world/ all time.  Has fitted Rakitic well, and brought xavi back in to form.  Has revitalized Dani Alves from the high calibre player we are used to seeing.  it took a while to breakdown Dani's rust but has stormed back in great fashion and his new renewal is well deserved! He has strengthened our defense to be one of the best in the world.  Pique has responded well and is back to superb form!  He and his assistant have brought back the technical abilities in set pieces, proving crucial to our La Liga tittle.  Hes shown that he can rotate our players to provide top physical conditioning for the long haul of the season.  and is willing to give youngsters time to develop in the team (munir, Sandro, Rafinha, Roberto?).  He has proved to be able to handle the heat, coming from the players and the board when things get tough and has won over the players trust and has signed an extension with the club for 2 more years!  overall, i never thought he would be able to do so much and in so little time.  It is unreal to me that everything has gone our way this season, with the management and trophy aspect.  Also, the renewal of key players like Dani, Pedro and Alba. and the overdue signing of a promising RB.  Also, The Future: i think this will be the most interesting aspect of Luis Enrique's tenure here.  We have showed a more aggressive and direct way to breakdown defenses and our opponents, but do we have a plan B? i think we will if we acquire a good holding midfielder.  A midfielder who can hold the ball and help our midfield kill with possession just like we did before.  being able to play 2-3 different styles would benefit Lucho and the team immensely.  If our opponents figure out one aspect of the game, we could incorporate a different tactical change just like when xavi would come on in the second half.  or we could start with a xavi like player then incorporate a faster direct team if need be.  The point is, i want Lucho to have many options, many ways to beat any team!"
Barca,393a3a,Dantae4C,5,Tue Jun 9 15:46:02 2015 UTC,"This might sound weird but I believe a big reason for this year's success was the transfer ban. Because it forced the board to went out of their way to get a bunch of new players, who all turned out terrific."
Barca,393a3a,zashuna,4,Tue Jun 9 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"I'll be watching the Copa this summer, though seeing as I'm not from South America, I don't particularly care who wins. I just hope both Messi and Neymar do well. My ideal final would be between Argentina and Brazil, with Neymar and Messi both scoring hat tricks and Argentina winning on penalties."
Barca,393a3a,Polemicize,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:26:30 2015 UTC,It's a shame Suarez won't be playing for Uruguay. The front three each playing for their respective countries in the same competition would be amazing.
Barca,393a3a,Duke--Nukem,3,Tue Jun 9 16:39:28 2015 UTC,"Lucho start was shaky. Not having Suarez didn't help. Lucho adapted well because he is not stubborn, when something didn't work, he didn't try to force things. He moved on and tried other things, kept the working one and so on. I think he should be also credited for the staff he brought in.   These young technicians and dope. They changed everything. From players diet, training, to players psychology even.   I think the team matured a lot. When the Messi vs Lucho thing happened, everybody showed maturity. Captains Xavi and Iniesta talked with both Messi and Lucho. The conclusion was: we are professionals here, everyone should be focused on the job. And that's exactly what happened. They talked the crisis out, as adults, as professionals and as club passionates.   And the crisis was over. And we won almost every single match.   Maturity was our biggest ally.   I'd like to think that we were also lucky. And luck is a big part in sports. We were lucky that Neymar turned up to be a genuine good lad, considering all the hype he was surrounded by. It must not have been easy for him, but he adapted and progressed very well.   Suarez. What a beast. He as well adapted very well, because he's mature now, the players around him as well, they made him feel part of the team since day one, Messi left him all the space he needed, because he knew he needs confidence. Maturity.   Unpopular opinion: Alves, who is already on massive wages, should take the offer if he really is happy here. He's 32, a 2+1 season is a great offer, even with no salary increase. He was shit last year, he has been phenomenal this season. Does he have 2 years left in him with the same intensity? I doubt it. And the club believes he has it. He should take the offer and retire here as a hero.   Final words: Visca Barca and Fuck Madrid! We'll win the treble again next year if everybody stays in place with the help of a new and better board."
Barca,393a3a,Football_Enthusiast,3,Tue Jun 9 21:35:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. But that inside conflict between our coach and player, I believe this was exaggerated by the press and media, may be there was a rough patch or little disagreement between them but I think it wasn't anything too serious like the way media showed that to the world.  I'm hopeful that the coming seasons will be really great for Barça and Luis Enrique will be very successful as a manager at Barça. Luis Enrique isn't done creating his real squad yet as Barça's current squad is going though a transition period now but let Lucho get his complete team in January '16 and then hopefully Barça will win another treble."
Barca,393a3a,Duke--Nukem,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:42:26 2015 UTC,"The media are doing their job. They need to stretch the news as much as they can. The fact is, there was an issue and it was solved.

I have a feeling he won't get loaned out, and he can try to play the CM role. Busquets won't have to shift positions, Mascherano can also play DM, and of course Samper himself. Even Roberto can play there if necessary. Xavi played as a defensive midfielder in the beginning of his professional career, and Samper could be adapted."
Barca,393a3a,jdloyola,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:17:09 2015 UTC,"My only worry, because this happens alot with many teams, is if we start to lose focus on winning every game and get overly-confident. We are the best team in the world again, but we can't get that in our heads too much. Everyone is human and make mistakes ofcourse. If we lose a game or 2 in a row, it means we learn from it and improve. And we shouldn't point fingers at players and the manager for who's fault it is. If we lose, we lose together. Next season, I don't want to see us freaking out and act like the team is going downhill if we lose games."
Barca,393a3a,tgames56,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:06:11 2015 UTC,"biggest difference maker for the season besides the obvious MSN is Pique. the dude was unreal this season. I can't count the number of times i thought man we are going to get scored on here, and then pique comes out of nowhere and saves us with a world class tackle. I think his leadership in the back allowed us to be really aggressive up front and hold that high line while still having one of the best defenses in Europe.      I really hope Rafinha can step it up next season, he is so important to the success of the club down the road. iniesta is getting old and won't be able to play at his level for much longer, and hopefully rafinha will show that he can be world class instead of just great.   I plan on watching the copa america. Messi made me a barca fan, so he also made me a Argentina fan."

This was a great season with a few ups and downs, but we were still most consistent overall. I'm so relived and excited to know that Dani and Pedro are staying. We're really going to feel the impact of the transfer ban and Copa America next season. Thank you guys for being so welcoming and helpful! I've been following Barca for a long time now, but I just recently joined reddit.   Also: I just want to get this off my chest. I hate that people discredit luis Enrique by saying that anyone could've managed to win a treble with our front three. Not every star studded team is easy to manage. Just look at Real Madrid (and to some extent, Bayern)."
Barca,393a3a,hectorinho,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:25:53 2015 UTC,"What a season!  I'm still riding a tremendous high. One of my favorite aspects of this team is how well they get on with each other. MSN genuinely like each other and they seem to love making chances for each other.  Seeing Pique back at the top of his game has also made me very happy. All I can say is great job boys, great job Lucho.  I am looking forward to next season!  As for this Summer, I will be watching the Copa America. I am a neutral so I will just hope for a great tournament. I always end up rooting for Peru because my best friend is Peruvian, and he is the one that got me into the sport.  I am hoping for a Brazil v Argentina or maybe Chile can make the Final."

New board, might mean less stress for both Lucho and some players, hopefully everyone will play their hearts out. As for improvements on the pitch... well, less matches of 2 halves.   What are you going to do with you football energies over the summer?   Copa America, try to get a new job, play games, watch movies."

Barca,392kju,droid750,7,Tue Jun 9 00:20:22 2015 UTC,"Either way, I think is this board's fault. They did not handle this issue properly. Last summer they should have hired a proper replacement, instead they got Douglas. Well... when they relized that Douglas was getting us nowhere, they should have signed an extension with Dani right away and not wait until now. Dani is just playing his cards, shame on this board."
Barca,392kju,polechi33,4,Mon Jun 8 22:27:38 2015 UTC,"Dani is just playing his cards, shame on this board   And theyre playing theirs. He isnt the only right back in the world that can fill that spot, and he's 32 already. He will have absolutely zero resale value and there's no guarantee he'd be a starter in 12 months time (with us just signing Aleix Vidal). Shame on the board if they were paying a player 8mil p/a until he's nearly 36!  Im a huge fan of Dani's, but the club has to act in it's best interest. 2+1 is pretty reasonable IMO."

Sadly, its the end of two great players: Xavi and Dani. The greatest RB in our history, hands down. As good as other replacements may be, they will never have the understanding that he had built with Messi and Co. over the years.   I hope to god I'm wrong and he accepts, but in any case if he doesn't, thank you for everything Dani, we'll miss you."

In fact apart from Mascherano, Lavezzi, Messi (Romero did well in the penalty shoot-out but he isn't very convincing as a GK) everyone else from Argentina team should be accused for ruining WC '14 campaign."

I am very excited to see him play in 2016 can't wait for this ridiculous ban to end. I think he will adapt to our system fantastically. His commitment will be unquestionable it seems! Welcome Aleix Vidal !!! Hope you have a great future at our club :)"
Barca,390t2p,MobyGlitch,19,Mon Jun 8 13:09:47 2015 UTC,Already a great attitude. Very pleased with this signing.
Barca,390t2p,Jelboo,18,Mon Jun 8 14:35:32 2015 UTC,"Is he allowed to play friendlies (pre-season), or does that require registration as well?"
Barca,390t2p,Duffer44,25,Mon Jun 8 13:36:35 2015 UTC,"i think he will,  non official fifa games should be ok for him"
Barca,390t2p,XsTream23,8,Mon Jun 8 14:21:52 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really good question. I hope he can play in friendlies. Also, could he possibly play for barca B/U19s?"
Barca,390t2p,CrippledCrip,6,Mon Jun 8 14:04:21 2015 UTC,Not for the B. Doubt he can play any official games until registering.
Barca,390t2p,vanNostrandby,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:35:45 2015 UTC,Couldn't the B team buy him technically and work with them then transfer to the first team in January.
Barca,390t2p,FrostyGrass,9,Mon Jun 8 17:48:39 2015 UTC,No. No Barca entity can register players to a team. The ban isn't only for the first team.
Barca,390t2p,imfatal,4,Mon Jun 8 18:00:42 2015 UTC,Oh I wasn't aware that makes sense.
Barca,390t2p,FrostyGrass,2,Mon Jun 8 18:03:38 2015 UTC,Suarez played a game during his ban against a national team IIRC
Barca,390t2p,Afghan_,2,Tue Jun 9 13:17:33 2015 UTC,I think so because Suarez was able to play in friendlies last summer because they weren't connected with FIFA.
Barca,390t2p,zizzor23,2,Mon Jun 8 16:38:04 2015 UTC,That was because we had appealed to CAS because of how harsh FIFA's ban on him was. We were able to get it reduced to where he could train with the team and play games like those.
Barca,390t2p,Marchisio,13,Mon Jun 8 17:12:30 2015 UTC,I'll gladly welcome anyone willing enough to sacrifice half a season to play for Barca.
Barca,390t2p,Schadenfreudean_slip,11,Mon Jun 8 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"Anyone have feedback on him? I'm not familiar with him.  Edit: Just took a look at his Transfermarkt profile and it seems that he's a winger who can play RB.  Is he a possible replacement for Dani/Montoya? I highly doubt we would purchase another winger with Pedro, Deulo, Tello, Adama, Sandro all waiting for minutes...I hope......."
Barca,390t2p,IhateAngryBirds,21,Mon Jun 8 13:30:59 2015 UTC,Yeah the prevailing thought seems to be he's the heir to Dani.

Barca,390t2p,polechi33,17,Mon Jun 8 13:51:18 2015 UTC,"He'll play RB. He's Alba mold, winger converted to fullback. Ridiculous pace and never-ending stamina as well, just like Jordi. Not the best 1v1 defender, but he's a warrior and he'll fight for every ball. Can be very dangerous overlapping in attack, his crosses are pinpoint (he got assists this season from RB against us and Madrid)"

This team has the potential to be the best Juvenil A team in years and that includes the one that won the UEFA Youth League last year.  Huge is that Oriol Busquets and Iñaki Peña join the team, both at age 16! And no Oriol is not related to Sergio :-)"
Barca,392iox,invice,3,Mon Jun 8 20:01:06 2015 UTC,How good are Oriol and Peña? I have not heard much about them. And what other juvenil a players could cause a difference this year?
Barca,392iox,invice,2,Tue Jun 9 04:24:19 2015 UTC,"Huge, huge fan of Oriol. He actually plays kind of the same way as Sergio. He's a bit more physically strong though (compared to kids his own age), which is also a big reason why he's already going to play at Juvenil A. His positional awareness is amazing, while he also has fantastic vision and passing.  Peña is probably the most talented goalkeeper at La Masia right now. It has been a while, but a few seasons back he made quite a name for himself when he stopped 6 out of 9 penalties in a shoot-out and after that he scored the winning penalty himself."

Knowing that if he comes out in support of the current board then he may be at risk when they are not re-elected.  Almost the best thing to come out of this treble is that any presedential candidate can't really use the signing of a ""big name"" manager or player to win votes. I think most Socis want Lucho to stay so coming out and saying i'll bring ""this"" manager in to replace him is more likely to hurt their chances than aid it.

Barca,3930th,ViscaBarca1899,2,Mon Jun 8 22:01:02 2015 UTC,"Grimaldo will put up some healthy competition for Alba, I'm really eager to watch Grimaldo playing for our first team; now I'm just waiting for him to be promoted."
Barca,3930th,Football_Enthusiast,2,Mon Jun 8 22:23:01 2015 UTC,"We should definitely give Deulo a chance this season. Being with the first team on a daily basis could help him grow further. If not, then Munir or Sandro should be the second forward off the bench.  As for the midfield, Rafinha will be the main backup and Samper should be after him. His versatility in the midfield will be key.   Defense is fine as it is. Only thing is that we'll have to stick with Montoya at RB until Vidal plays in January."
Barca,3930th,lebronsucks123,0,Tue Jun 9 04:04:43 2015 UTC,What's up with the Deulofeu hype? He's honestly not that good...  Sandro and Munir should be backups for the trident. Denis Suarez should be added as a midfielder who's able to rotate.
Barca,3930th,Kluey,5,Mon Jun 8 22:25:43 2015 UTC,"What's up with the Deulofeu hype? He's honestly not that good...   People hype him because he's the biggest attacking talent to come from La Masia since Messi. He's an exceptional talent that needs proper guidance to reach a level that can help a team playing at top level. Unfortunately this hasn't been the case yet, causing him to struggle for some time now.  I still have faith that Luis Enrique can sort him out and it might be possible that he will do so in his second season; having built a bit more credit than this season."
Barca,3930th,jklz,2,Mon Jun 8 22:50:28 2015 UTC,"I disagree about Deulo's ability here. His problem seems to be his attitude, if he's not the main man then his performance can suffer. Look at his performances for the Spanish youth teams and also the year at Barca B a couple of seasons back when he was a key member, even his form at Everton was good for a teenager but he was unfortunately riddled with injuries. This season at Sevilla he clearly lost the faith of Emery and his opportunities diminished."
Barca,3930th,efarfan,2,Mon Jun 8 22:38:36 2015 UTC,"Deulofeu is much much better than Munir and Sandro. I think having him play with MSN will humble him a bit. Let's give him a shot, I think we have a lot more to gain than lose."
Barca,3930th,Aj16ay,2,Tue Jun 9 02:47:51 2015 UTC,"Deulofeu is a phenom. If we can harness his raw talent into consistency and selflessness we could have one of the best forwards in the world, right out of La Masia. That's the hype about him"

Barca,392yoo,dank_ramer,4,Mon Jun 8 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"I am impressed by Pogba's performance in the final (Marchisio played really well too) and by no means I'm doubtful about Pogba's skill/ability but I still think 80M Euro that Barça previously offered for Pogba was way too much than what I think Pogba's transfer fee should be which is not more than 60M Euro. Pogba surely is highly skilled, knows what he does, his presence on the field in very noticeable and he causes terror in opponent half by his delicate movements with the ball but I believe that paying more than 60M or 65M Euro is too much for him but Juventus want to make fortune with Pogba's transfer and my speculation is at in the end Juventus will sell him close to or even higher than 90M Euro.   He is unquestionably a good player but I don't think Pogba should be signed by Barça at such a high transfer fee and I've read that Pogba's manager Mino Raiola demands to make Pogba the second highest paid player at Barça so I think if Real is still interested on Pogba, he might end up playing for them."
Barca,392yoo,Football_Enthusiast,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:17:00 2015 UTC,"I think real is going harder for Verrati, but it IS Real so they do t always have to make sense.   But to be completely honest, even if we did overpay, I think it would be worth it because then we'd have a complete team until raki and busi get older, so we wouldn't have to make another big purchase for years to come. But that's only if Barca doesn't spend frivolously afterwards"
Barca,392yoo,Football_Enthusiast,0,Mon Jun 8 22:23:39 2015 UTC,"Verratti might end up playing for AC Milan too although that possibility is quite low at this moment as Ancelotti rejected AC Milan's offer to return as the manager so Ancelotti won't convince him to move to AC Milan.  I understand what you meant, in fact after a very long time I liked a French midfielder ever since Zidane retired. He is truly talented but Juventus are playing really tough bargain (just imagine that for a talented but very young player with so many things to prove as of yet, Juventus turned down a whooping 80M Euro offer). PSG won't easily let Verratti go, but I suspect if they sell Verratti then they will surely sign Pogba because I think Verratti's departure will clear the way for Pogba's arrival at PSG."

El meu pare es un soci i jo crec que votara en contre de el Bartomeu. Diu que el equip va be pero es nota que no s'entenen gaire be entre tots. Tambe li agradaria cambiar de president per cambiar la imatge que tenim ara mateix de corruptes y mitg incompetents. No crec que li interesi molt la tornada de el Laporta, al final tampoc li agradaba."

Tens molt raó; jo crec que l'éxit de la temporada és una resultat dels treballs del equip, Lucho, i potser també Zubi...pero el presi no. Jo votaria contre el Barto també...jo sé que Laporta (si él actualment decideix de ser candidat) no és el president perfect, però hi ha altres opcions?

Supposo que es per que som mes joves i segurament no tenim experiencia amb presidents mes dolents de altres temps. Amb els pocs que parlo pensen que la junta son uns impresentables, pero mentres el equip sigui guanyan com ara, es poden perdonar moltes coses. Jo no crec que el Bartomeu sigui el proxim president.

Yo creo que la mayoria no quiere votar a Bartomeu otra vez, pero otras opciones como laporta tampoco les gustan mucho.

Barca,390tdj,xenmate,3,Tue Jun 9 07:54:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think Lucho is leaving. But he has to say he's not sure about continuing, since he will have to negotiate with a new president.  The number of socis that want Bartu out is growing everyday, but will probably decrease a bit due to the treble. Still, I know my fair share of people who have worked tirelessly to drive both Sandro and him out, and will not stop until it has truly happened.    Yo no creo que Lucho quiera marcharse de verdad, pero tampoco puede asegurar que continúa si al fin y al cabo todo va a depender  de la nueva Junta, con la que él deberá negociar también.  Si bien el número de socis descontentos crece día a día, al final hay muchos que se quedan en el triplete y listo. Pero yo conozco un buen grupo que no descansará hasta ver a estos tipos fuera."
Barca,390tdj,IhateAngryBirds,3,Mon Jun 8 17:24:08 2015 UTC,"As I understand it Lucho isn't happy with how Bartomeu treated Zubi, so he will likely leave if Rosell is re-elected."

Neymar   He was very good but not a completely proven success in the higher levels and lots of people had their doubts about him.   Rakitic   He is not a galactico type signing at all.  As I said already Suarez and Neymar are the only galactico type signings, and even among them Neymar is quite a bit different.

Unfortunately I couldnt watch his club games, as he is playing in Ukrania and they arent broadcasting his games here. He was great for our national team and is definitely one of the reasons that we are on the best way to qualifying for the Euro 2016. He is pretty fast, a good passer and technically gifted for a CB. I would say he is on a level with Bartra, but far more experienced as he already played CL with Basel and EL with Kiev.  It also would be surprising for me if we really buy another CB!"

Barca,38x6if,GraemeTurnbull,3,Mon Jun 8 08:53:44 2015 UTC,"But it still is much different. Firstly, Madrid as organizers of the trophy got a free classification and pass to 1/8ths of final (while the Champions of Spain had to play all the rounds). Madrid was 3rd in league in 1956 for example to Athletic. And they didn't win the league in 1959 or 1960 (Barcelona did) but still started in 1/8ths of final.   Next, the current format as a seeded tournament is made in a way that the best teams will end up playing at the end. In the initial format with one team per country plus (except Spain)  you could get to the final playing the Champions of Luxembourg, Cyprus and whatever other country was invited to the tournament, and maybe only play one hard game (which you still had to win).   It is highly impressive what that generation did, but that tournament was very different from this current tournament.   Edit: Here is a picture with the teams each one beat to win their 5 first CL's. Ignore the meme aspect of it."

It's interesting how much the club prioritizes Masia/Spanish experienced players. Is Vidal better at RB than some other players in Prem, Bundesliga, or Serie A? Probably not.   But you often hear of players struggling in new countries and never quite making it despite their talent. Maybe it really is that important, which is hard to see unless you're on the inside of a team. Pique did say that this dressing room has the best atmosphere he's seen, so maybe there's something to that. Just some thoughts."

Barca,38xyeo,boudo5,3,Mon Jun 8 10:31:13 2015 UTC,"If it counts, he won't be just waiting.

Barca,38ycvc,joesugarman,3,Mon Jun 8 10:24:19 2015 UTC,"Aleix is versatile, he can play as a RM, RB, LM & LB. He is also Catalan-born & talented, so it seems quite obvious to me why we signed him."

He often plays the ball upfront to the opponent's half like Dani Alves. I'm impressed and only time will tell whether Vidal is the perfect one to replace Dani. I'm really hopeful that Aleix Vidal will fit great at Barça. Wishing him all the best for his career at Barça."

The fact everyone wanted Alves to speak right after the captains (so much respect for him). Piqué's banter. MAtS speaking Spanish. Pedro speaking Catalan. This team is amazing. Vista el Barça!
Barca,38yhoc,pouty_mcpouterson,2,Mon Jun 8 05:47:06 2015 UTC,Translation of king Messi's speech? And Dani Alves : )?
Barca,38yhoc,eirik124,9,Sun Jun 7 23:44:42 2015 UTC,"King Messi: ""Good Afternoon(night). Being here, again, is incredible, after a hard, difficult year like the last one. We had trouble(hard time; costo mucho=costs us a lot) getting back up to be here again is something spectacular. We(you) have to enjoy it and (y bucho i think he says, idk what it means. Could be ""y mucho"" which means ""a lot""[in regards to enjoying it]). Like I just said, it wasn't(isn't) easy(note you can DEFINITELY tell in his voice when he says this that he's drunk off his mind), but I have no doubt we're going to continue, because this group has a lot of will and hope for continuing to achieve things. And like how I said last time(last time they won the treble) you wanted the three? Here are the three! Visca(Go) Barça and Visca(Go) Catalunya!""  Dani Alves: Good Afternoon(Night) to all. Firstly I wanted to thank all those teammates, all the staff,.... all of you, for making me happy in this club. I do not know how long this dream will last, I don't know if this is the end... I don't know how long it will last but i hope it's eternal while it lasts. Here I was happy and I am happy, and if I'm not here this is where I'm happy, because I am another one of you(fans). They(players, staff) have made me feel like one of you(fan of the club). Thank you very much, Visca(Go) Barça Visca(go) Catalunya y visca la madre(the mother, but when i have no idea what he was going to say because it gets cut off)  Hope this wasn't too confusing!"

Fav this video my friends, bad times will come again at some point, and this video tells the story of true champions spirit."
Barca,38ylre,SubjectAndObject,14,Sun Jun 7 23:11:50 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the elections IMO. Barto fired Zubi, the man who trusted Lucho and have a great relationship with each other. Zubi also signed most of the players Lucho requested when people doubted the signings.  I have confidence that he will stay. He wouldn't have asked for Aleix Vidal if he didn't intend to."
Barca,38ylre,viscaelbarca1899,3,Mon Jun 8 00:10:24 2015 UTC,"Lucho and Bartomeu have a good relationship. And we don't know if it was Lucho who asked for Vidal, AFAIK it's the sporting director (probably Rexach) who's in charge of finding the players that fit the sporting project the best (although the manager should have a final word on them and may actually suggest players)."
Barca,38ylre,astral_cowboy,3,Mon Jun 8 07:37:54 2015 UTC,"I think their relationship is purely professional. Despite what we thought about Zubi, he was loved by the players and coaching staff.   We don't have a sporting director atm, what we have is a transfer comittee, consisting of Rexach, Braida and a few others.  Jordi Mestre said today at Vidal's presentation that Lucho greenlit this transfer. The board is resigning tomorrow as they are calling for elections, so I'm pretty sure Lucho asked for him."
Barca,38ylre,viscaelbarca1899,14,Mon Jun 8 13:04:25 2015 UTC,"If Enrique decides not to continue because of conflicts with the board, then Bartomeu doesn't need to bother worrying about staffing decisions. He's gone."

We still have 3 cups in our grasp and we have an amazing team for the next season as well.  After yeats struggling with coaches and bad moments it is time to ride on that success for as long as we still have players in their prime, squeezing the last drops of the players that are getting old and shaping the young ones.  Letting Luis Enrique go is a potential disaster, and this drama is obscuring an amazing moment for Barca."

Now that LE has won the treble I'm think that whoever the president of the club will be after the election, he will try his best to keep Luis Enrique. I'm hopeful that LE will stay."
Barca,38ylre,Football_Enthusiast,4,Mon Jun 8 04:43:09 2015 UTC,I think the issue would be that Luis Enrique does not want to stay.
Barca,38ylre,IhateAngryBirds,4,Mon Jun 8 04:54:05 2015 UTC,"Even if he doesn't want to stay, I think our players and the board will try to convince him to stay. I'm hopeful about a positive outcome."
Barca,38ylre,astral_cowboy,3,Mon Jun 8 04:59:35 2015 UTC,"I had a feeling all comments would be ""he'll stay"", I'm sure he will considering he had a hand in signing of Vidal and renewing Pedro  but what if... Frank de Boer was rumored last year, he's a good coach, understands Cryuff philosophy, but worries me that our direct style thins year would not fit very well with Frank, and we would have a transition period yet again."
Barca,38ylre,elanciano31,2,Mon Jun 8 07:41:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll leave, although he deserves to leave if he wants to, especially after how the media and some fans treated him after Anoeta. Sure, he's the manager and managers get under that kind of pressure, but IMHO it was excessive and even disrespectful.  I still think he'll stay, though. He's an ambitious guy and will go for the six cups and the possibility of winning back-to-back Champions Leagues.   To stay on topic, if he decides to leave, Frank de Boer can be a good option. Also Klopp. And Löw. And Lopetegui."

Barca,38x1ej,EpicChiguire,6,Mon Jun 8 02:42:00 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you're talking about. I became a Barcelona-fan in the summer of 2006, right after Rijkaard's team had won the Champions League.   I had never been able to watch any other league than the domestic league (in Denmark), but I was able to watch the Champions League final that year, and immediately fell in love with Barça. But still, to this day, I don't feel like I was really a Barcelona-fan, when I watched Henke Larsson dismantle Sol Campbell and his friends in 2006.  But during that summer, we finally got some more TV channels and I was able to follow the team that I had just fallen in love with. What followed was first a mediocre season (2006-2007) and then a horrible season (2007-2008), but I still watched every single game and cheered whenever there was something to cheer for.  So when Guardiola was promoted and we destroyed everything in the 2008-2009 season, I really felt that I was being rewarded for sticking with the team, when in reality I could have easily jumped ship and started following any other team. But Barça was my team and that will never change."

Barca,38wp6x,Dr_JReko,4,Sun Jun 7 21:56:50 2015 UTC,"In his biography he doesn't say whether or not he drinks*, but he does talk about struggling with his weight when he first came to Europe. Apparently he knew next to nothing about nutrition and how to take care of himself as an athlete. But he asked around the club for tips and got where he needed to be. It sounds like he's been pretty vigilant about his fitness since then.  I think a combination of the super long suspension, therapy, and not having the pressure of carrying his team contributed to his improved behavior this season.

I can't take Alves leaving as well as Xavi (especially without a similar goodbye), and to top that we don't know what's going on with Luis Enrique.

Barca,38w8nj,Illegal_sal,118,Sun Jun 7 10:26:51 2015 UTC,"Masche, you were already a part of this teams history. You didn't need a bloody treble to be appreciated, you will always be remembered as a fucking warrior like Puyol who played his heart out week in, week out. You may not be Catalan born, but you bleed Blaugrana like the rest of the team."
Barca,38w8nj,honamdoh,27,Sun Jun 7 10:57:58 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you. I'd actually would like him to become third or fourth captain! What a guy, always plays like it's his last game."
Barca,38w8nj,sensei888,16,Sun Jun 7 13:52:49 2015 UTC,"He should be the next captain after Xavi but he won't be, probably end up Pique. I don't have a problem with that, I just think Mascherano is a warrior in Puyols mold who can rally the team."
Barca,38w8nj,ComfyRug,17,Sun Jun 7 14:19:37 2015 UTC,"One of Mascherano's great traits is that he doesn't seem to need the armband to take the mantle of being the leader. He is always the one that Luis Enrique was talking tactics with during the match.  Perhaps Puyol embodied every element of what a captain is - the leader, the figurehead, the father, the coach.  No one player is that on the team anymore, they are working with a different model of leadership and it seems to be working well."
Barca,38w8nj,zazzlekdazzle,3,Sun Jun 7 16:41:50 2015 UTC,"It will still be Iniesta. Unless you meant Pique taking that 4th captain role, in which case he will be since he's next in line in terms of years in club."
Barca,38w8nj,jrmartin500,5,Sun Jun 7 21:40:07 2015 UTC,Sometimes the real captains don't wear the arm band.
Barca,38w8nj,TR1L0GYxx,35,Sun Jun 7 16:03:25 2015 UTC,"Mascherano is a true leader, his presence and body language in the field gives courage to the other lads in defense. He has been playing as a CB although his true position is in defensive midfield, Barça will always remember his sacrifice. Hopefully Mascherano will continue playing at a top level in the coming seasons."
Barca,38w8nj,Football_Enthusiast,18,Sun Jun 7 11:08:49 2015 UTC,"No Javier, that will only happen when you finally score a goal. ;)  No, seriously though, for a long time I tended to sort of 'forget' about Mascherano, but in recent years he's been so impressive and courageous. A true leader who gives it his all every second he plays. We're lucky to have him."
Barca,38w8nj,Jelboo,14,Sun Jun 7 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"If you guys really notice, after almost every goal we score, Mascherano has some sort of secret talk with Lucho. It's like he is our secret Capita, and feels like they are discussing about not gettin carried away, and keeping things composed."
Barca,38w8nj,AL_LM10,4,Sun Jun 7 15:36:06 2015 UTC,not just Lucho..he had these talks with pep too..after almost every goal

Barca,38w8nj,alterpsyche,5,Sun Jun 7 16:59:35 2015 UTC,"231 matches and 11 titles. Trust me, Jefecito - you were already part of our history books!  When we bought Mascherano, we thought that we were buying a hard working, great tackler for our defensive midfield. What we ended up getting, was a world class centerback, with fantastic passing abilities (he sometimes reminds me of Rafa Márquez, with his diagonal passes), great leadership and a will to die for his team.

Barca,38xo8x,Januzaj7,22,Sun Jun 7 18:52:25 2015 UTC,"Please no, he would never play. I don't know why we're obsessed with loaning to Sevilla. Clubs like Celta and Rayo should be who we try for."
Barca,38xo8x,broad_h2o,7,Sun Jun 7 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. It obviously depends on many circumstances, but for all we know, teams like Rayo and Celta aren't that consistent and could end up fighting relegation next season. If that's the case, Rayo and Celta will forget about their good intentions of giving minutes to the kid and will just go for the players that offer the best chances of winning.   On the other hand, Sevilla will play in 3 competitions, so they'll need a lot of rotation. They also have a solid sporting project, which is something that we want because that means they at least have a plan for the kid. It's also one of the best teams in the world, so learning from players that are part of such a team could be an extremely great experience."
Barca,38xo8x,astral_cowboy,4,Sun Jun 7 20:35:45 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, Rayo and Celta will forget about their good intentions of giving minutes to the kid and will just go for the players that offer the best chances of winning   That wouldn't be the point of sending them to those teams. No matter what team we send them to, the club will (and should) pick the players that will give them the best chance of winning. Sevilla did that to push for CL spots, and Denis and Deulo ended up not playing much. The point is, at Celta or Rayo the standard is lower so someone like Halilovic could well be one of the best players, someone the coach will rely on win important matches"
Barca,38xo8x,Aj16ay,9,Mon Jun 8 07:17:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's a really bad idea, just look how it went for Deulofeu and Denis Suarez"
Barca,38xo8x,JurijFedorov,4,Sun Jun 7 19:03:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, bad idea. Those 2 barely got to play and they are good players. Celta Vigo would be a perfect option. Or an even lower club. It needs to be a club where they will play every week!"
Barca,38xo8x,JKapIsClueless,4,Sun Jun 7 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine with that, as long as there isn't an option to buy."
Barca,38xo8x,Aj16ay,6,Sun Jun 7 18:56:12 2015 UTC,"I absolutely hope not. Halilovic is not even as good as Denis nor Deulo yet, and neither of those got enough playing time. Would be a very stupid move from us, I'd rather loan him to a smaller team where he could be a starter"
Barca,38xo8x,jklz,3,Sun Jun 7 19:21:04 2015 UTC,"Alen barely made an impact with Barça B as a midfielder, so I really doubt he'd be able to do his thing at Sevilla. Unless they play him as a right winger perhaps. Wouldn't be a great idea at all."

Barca,38w7b9,IhateAngryBirds,18,Sun Jun 7 10:18:35 2015 UTC,He reminds me of Valdés. A similar stance of bravado and borderline arrogance. His habit of chesting a bouncing pass down and then goading forwards into coming towards him before he picks up the ball is both infuriating (in terms of me personally thinking it's poor sportsmanship) and hilarious (in terms of me personally enjoying unashamedly arrogant characters).
Barca,38w7b9,arkhamandcheese,3,Sun Jun 7 13:02:00 2015 UTC,"I sometimes think, does ter Stegen want to establish himself as a sweeper keeper?"
Barca,38w7b9,IhateAngryBirds,12,Sun Jun 7 10:28:02 2015 UTC,"He already sort of is one, he'll become more and more brave in coming out of the area as years go by"
Barca,38w7b9,YoSoyMilkChocolate,11,Sun Jun 7 12:22:45 2015 UTC,He has proved that how good he already is despite of being young and inexperienced. He has the potential to be one of the top 3 GKs of the world. I hope he will have a great career at Barça.
Barca,38w7b9,YoSoyMilkChocolate,17,Sun Jun 7 13:24:01 2015 UTC,"Great signing and so young too! I definitely want to see him starting league and UCL matches next season, as opposed to just having him play cup matches only."
Barca,38w7b9,jimtheguy69,7,Sun Jun 7 12:11:14 2015 UTC,I say it would be better if both Bravo and ter Stegen are allotted fair share of playing time in the next season. Matches should be allotted between them in a way that both of them get enough playing time and most importantly Barça should focus on improving ter Stegen's level of confidence and motivation as hopefully he will be the primary GK of Barça after three/four seasons. However I think Bravo should be given more playing time in La Liga matches as I think ter Stegen isn't ready yet to take charge of most intense La Liga matches and Bravo is just more experienced and does better playing La Liga matches than ter Stegen at this moment.
Barca,38w7b9,miralize,5,Sun Jun 7 13:35:58 2015 UTC,"If you read my other comment, MAtS is clearly ready, I disagree. The boy just won a UCL and Copa Del Rey at just 23 years old, extraordinary. He's a long term investment; he's proven that he deserves a shot at full time matchplay. Bravo is at his career peak right now while MAtS has unlimited potential."
Barca,38w7b9,NoNameJackson,5,Sun Jun 7 13:50:23 2015 UTC,"Naw I rather have to great keepers, sharing playtime is great."
Barca,38w7b9,EpicChiguire,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:52:42 2015 UTC,That would lead to inconsistency. GK's like all players need a consistent run in the team
Barca,38w7b9,invice,3,Sun Jun 7 17:35:35 2015 UTC,"Bravo does more than an excellent job at his position, so why bench him when you can have two fresh keepers at all time? Bravo is still the more experienced and arguably the more consistent keeper and those are the qualities you need in the league when Real are always less than 3 points ahead or behind Barca.   Ter Stegen is very skilled, but his age might still play a bad role in a more frequent game-to-game scenario."
Barca,38w7b9,ChoochiPastol,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:34:35 2015 UTC,"I'm hopeful that ter Stegen will be a phenomenal performer at Barça and he did achieve two great accomplishments despite of being so young. I know that he will do great in La Liga matches too but I think for at least one/two more seasons let him spit playing time with Bravo in La Liga. ter Stegen deserves full time matchplay at La Liga, true but let's not just bench Bravo because we have a new youngster who has potential to do great things. Barça have two really great GKs and it would be better for us if we use/rotate these two wisely."
Barca,38w7b9,invice,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:13:32 2015 UTC,"Why not CL for ter Stegen, Copa for Bravo and Liga for both?"
Barca,38w7b9,YoSoyMilkChocolate,12,Sun Jun 7 18:54:39 2015 UTC,"The better policy for us to manage these two wonderful keepers I'd to rotate then in every competition, thereby awarding everyone enough playing time and giving ter Stegen less risky games to try weird shit and thus increasing his confidence. Continue this for a year or two and then convert ter Stegen into the main goalkeeper with bravo stepping up in a few changes to either rest TerStegen or give Bravo playing time. Tbh I liked the present system but I don't think ter Stegen will have enough exposure if he just plays ten to twenty games in a season(copa +cl will make it around thirty games if I am adding correctly)  Edit: If there's any I'd in this text, it actually is is. On mobile and the stupid autocorrect converts is to I'D everytime."
Barca,38w7b9,invice,3,Sun Jun 7 12:48:36 2015 UTC,"Why not swap them for the next season, Bravo for the CL and CR,  Ter Stegen for la liga"
Barca,38w7b9,AdviceDanimals,12,Sun Jun 7 13:03:08 2015 UTC,"Because Bravo has been wonderful this season, and a good competition between them could actually benefit ter Stegen as well as us. Tbh I always wanted tervstegen to play the league but after seeing Bravo perform so well, I think that both keepers deserve to represent us in every competition. I know that continuous rotation could be harmful, but I think that the quality of these two players is too good to reduce any player's play time. I definitely could be wrong. Its just my opinion"
Barca,38w7b9,zizzor23,3,Sun Jun 7 13:09:31 2015 UTC,"IMO if we are to repeat changes need to be made. There's a reason no one has won 2 UCL's in a row. The first change is Aleix Vidal in at right back obviously (after January), but the second change could be MAtS in. He's won a Champions League and Copa del Rey already, he's clearly proven. Remember, he's a long term investment. Now that we know he's good enough to play at the highest level, it's time he should play full time. This season is as good as Bravo will ever be. MAtS has so much untapped potential; he can be the best GK in the world."
Barca,38w7b9,HippoNigga,9,Sun Jun 7 13:38:32 2015 UTC,Not taking any thing away from MAtS man. I love the guy to the extent that I was a bit sad when we signed Bravo as it meant that play time would be less. But Bravo has been wonderful and we owe it to him to treat him nicely. Remember that we treated even Pinto nicely even when he was not that good. We are more than a club. We can't reject the keeper who was so good to is this season. Increase MAtS playtime but w should treat Bravo the way he deserves

Barca,38zdoy,ewest,7,Mon Jun 8 03:03:04 2015 UTC,"Messi is almost 28 and probably has atleast 3 years as a forward left and I think for sure he'll stay till 2019/20. Neymar is really young but there is always that chance that he may leave after his contract is up. Saying that I'll say he'll stay just as long as Messi. Pedro and Suarez seem to want to stay at Barca now for a long time. With all these world class forwards, kids like Adama, Sandro, Munir and even Deulo won't make it into the first team enough to where they can develop their skills while gaining experience. Also they have potential enough to be world class so they won't want to be at Barca B. As much as I dislike how it happens, they should be sold with a buy-back clause and be allowed to develop like Pique, Cesc, Alba. In my opinion anyway."

Barca,38whec,broad_h2o,3,Sun Jun 7 17:05:59 2015 UTC,"I for one welcome the signing, he's Catalan, a Masia product, and versatile. To think, the only reason both Alba and Vidal are back at Barça is becuase Unai Emery turned them into full backs."
Barca,38whec,phildp,3,Sun Jun 7 18:44:40 2015 UTC,Just a reminder: Our last right back superstar was bought from Sevilla also and his name is Daniel Alves
Barca,38whec,Jelboo,4,Sun Jun 7 19:41:44 2015 UTC,"Oh well. Goodbye, Daniel Alves, you underappreciated legend. And welcome Vidal!"
Barca,38whec,astral_cowboy,4,Sun Jun 7 15:03:00 2015 UTC,"This isn't necessarily detrimental to Alves, since he still has an offer to renew which can sign it today if he wants to. On the contrary, this is a very smart move by the board, and one that I see as absolutely necessary since we have 3 RBs, 2 of which are in a rogue situation (Alves, Montoya). In a worst-case scenario, both of them could have left the club and would've ended up with Douglas as our RB.  In a best-case scenario, Alves renews, Montoya leaves, and we could have both Vidal and Alves as RBs, bringing in some serious competition to that position, and start phasing Alves out like Rakitic did with Xavi this season."
Barca,38whec,invice,3,Sun Jun 7 20:13:22 2015 UTC,"He is not underappreciated, this board is too messed up to identify his importance. And we should also consider the possibility of Alves being ridiculous in his demands. He is not getting younger, and a ridiculous contract is not something this board should do. Not taking anything away from Alves as it is his job to get a good contract, but we should consider this board's inability to committing to over paying"
Barca,38whec,Pek-Man,2,Sun Jun 7 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"Welcome, Aleix!  Sevilla-signings usually turn out to be great (Alves, Keita, Adriano, Rakitić) so I hope that Vidal will follow in their footsteps. He seems like a well rounded player, with a great mentality and a taste for victory. He has been an absolute key player for Sevilla this season."

Can't imagine what would need to happen to him so he wouldn't be there. Probably Ronaldo too, but he is not the guy who won the treble and he obviously won't play in Copa America, so I wouldn't be sure there."

Barca,38ve3m,Rahjhh5,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:03:36 2015 UTC,"my personal opinion - right it would be 1. Messi 2. Suarez 3.

Barca,38ve3m,jorsias,11,Sun Jun 7 15:09:50 2015 UTC,"People will use the ""goals scored"" argument. Imagine if we told Messi to stand in the middle and have Rakitic, Neymar, Suarez and Iniesta feed him senselessly. He'd end up w 60 goals a season. I wish the whole circlejerk would end, because even in his absolute prime Ronaldo cannot dribble, pass, or shoot like Messi. There's no argument at all"
Barca,38ve3m,xFragg,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:22:30 2015 UTC,"Oh it is a fair argument, since the Ballon d'Or is an individual award and goals give a numerical base for people to form their opinion on, even though they don't give a complete picture.  I don't think it's detrimental to his case to be fed 'senselessly' (just like we had Messi playing as our main 'striker' under Tito, where basically Pedro and Alexis opened a lot of space for him). If they do that, it's because he's able to deliver.   And sure, he has different qualities as Messi (just like Neymar and Suarez), but he still makes the most out of them. However, this year Messi will win it, without a doubt, because he's having a monstrous year both individually and collectively."

Barca,38ve3m,chelseaz10,21,Sun Jun 7 08:31:06 2015 UTC,"World class player, but it would really surprise me if he gets picked this year. Ballon d'Or is a popularity contest, but they also look at the trophies you won with your team, it's not an individual award like some people think. When you won the treble with a team and you scored 39 goals all season, I think you are pretty much set on that third spot."
Barca,38ve3m,honamdoh,12,Sun Jun 7 08:49:01 2015 UTC,Please tell me when Hazard won/scored in the finals of the FA Cup and the Champions League while scoring in 5 consecutive matches in the knockout rounds and ending as joint top scorer.
Barca,38ve3m,YoSoyMilkChocolate,-5,Sun Jun 7 12:08:44 2015 UTC,"Hazard - midfield. Chelsea no.1 player. Most chance created, most successful dribble, most successful pass in the final third, most fouled. Won EPL and league cup. 4th best player according to whoscored rating. I'm not saying he should definitely be on the contender instead of neymar but he have as much chance as neymar. It's not all about goals."
Barca,38ve3m,chelseaz10,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:53:47 2015 UTC,"Well I listed those achievements because that's exactly what Neymar did the equivalent of. He's younger, better and has more potential. Bar Messi, he could be better than any player we've ever seen."
Barca,38ve3m,YoSoyMilkChocolate,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:40:29 2015 UTC,"There's no way Hazard is a better dribbler/passer in the final third. Have you even seen Messi play?

Barca,38ve3m,xFragg,3,Sun Jun 7 15:24:31 2015 UTC,"I think his stats refer to the EPL (re: final third and chances and such), so obviously Messi would not be in the run for that stat.  I personally rate Hazard very highly, but Neymar was a key figure in a treble winning team, so he has very good chances of ending up higher up the list than him.   If titles were not a consideration, I would rate them currently about the same (different roles), but Neymar IMO has a very, very high ceiling and can still improve so much (while already being world class)."
Barca,38ve3m,ManoloBar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:58:08 2015 UTC,"Compared to messi in la liga he still edges messi in those area. Check whoscored, sqawka if you don't believe me. Of course,I'm not saying he's better than messi, messi is definitely better but what hazard has been doing he definitely deserve a chance as a contender as much as neymar."
Barca,38ve3m,chelseaz10,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:07:17 2015 UTC,"Man, if you are using stats, don't tell me to lookup something (where you already did the heavy lifting), link the source.  I could not find the final third stuff in either whoscored or squawka, I don't even think whoscored has the data you are mentioning (at least I don't see it).     Regardless, the point is not Hazard vs Messi, but likelyhood of Hazard being in the Ballon D'Or podium.  Would I be super shocked Hazard making it there? No. But I would be a little surprised, basically because titles are usually a huge consideration for it, as well as role in those titles. And Neymar was a key figure in the biggest title out there. And he also has Copa America coming up, where he can gather more accolades.  Hazard was a key figure in the PL, and League Cup. League Cup is usually considered a minor title in England (The Cup is the FA, IIRC), so that leaves a single mayor title. Neymar participated in a historic season where they won 3 major titles (I know the King's Cup is usually considered minor, but it is theoretically the FA Cup equivalent). I just don't see it."

We had just lost to Sociedad. Luis Enrique was being sold as a farce coach. People saying that we were a shadow of our former selves and that Messi was no longer the same. We were supposed to get crushed.  Then we came to the Atletico and the HUNGER, the DRIVE, the fucking DETERMINATION Messi and the team showed to prove them wrong. I will always remember that game as the game that made me love football.  My first HAS, just HAS to be Messi's second goal against Bayern Munich. Just for him to really show that fucker Neur who is boss. I have almost memorized Martin Tyler's commentary of that goal it is so fucking good.   More than all of that though I most enjoyed sharing all these moments with you fantastic, welcoming, and lovely people! HERE'S TO NEXT YEAR."
Barca,38wglv,rgadd,7,Sun Jun 7 14:47:21 2015 UTC,"The first goal against Bayern for Messi. I haven't been that exuberant for a barça goal since, well, maybe ever. Such an iconic goal for the club and Messi: undoing our former hero/coach, exercising demons for barça against Bayern and Messi against Germany, and really catapulted this team to the treble."
Barca,38wglv,Not_Tom_Brady,6,Sun Jun 7 14:19:24 2015 UTC,"That goal relieved Messi, at least his goal celebration after that tells me so. I've seen Messi being that ecstatic/pleased or showing that much emotion only after their WC '14 victory against Netherlands other than his first goal celebration against Bayern in UCL '14-'15 . Now that Messi as a Barça player won against Bayern, I hope that Messi will defeat the German National Team in the World Cup before he retires."

However, there was one moment that has stuck with me this season that I wish I could remember the details of. It wasn't a particularly important or game changing moment. In fact, this moment was more personally important than anything. I don't know who it was against, but I believe we were at home. Someone had just scored, I believe it was Neymar or Messi. As the ball was making its way outside of the net, in a fit of total jubilation and excitement for his teammates, Suarez rockets the ball back into the net before celebrating with everyone.  It was just such a sincere and authentic act, and I feel like it shows Suarez for who he really is. I'm a very new fan of soccer, but there has been something about Suarez that I had always liked, and I felt that the hatred toward him was misguided. Between the unconditional support he has for his teammates and the widely circulated ESPN article about him, I had found a favorite player."

And nobody dared to take it out for hours.   The second great moment happened after Barça received the cup. As Xavi and Luis Enrique were coming down the stairs, Cant del Barça started playing on the PA. And both of them started singing along, almost as an act of reflex.

Barca,38u27a,felixisfalling,48,Sat Jun 6 20:50:37 2015 UTC,"First I’d like to say, Juventus is a great team. They deserved to be here, I doubted them but I’ve never been more stressed out and proved wrong about them and their chances.  Such a great team, to get at this stage is no easy feat, they fought till the very end, they are champions.  Andrea Pirlo, maestro, the father of the game, such poise, such talent, every futbol aficionado loves your devotion and your spirit. You set foot on the pitch, delighted us with your presence and the field will not be the same without you.  It’s hard seeing you go, we love you!!!  Xavi, a legend, such a tactician and wonderful player. You have helped Barcelona turn into so much more than just another team.  Your talents, your vision and maturity is something that every Barcelona player and fan dreams of. We thank you so very much for being with us and staying true to your colors, and not leaving us when things got tough.  Now it’s time for you to start another phase in your life, and set forward another reunion in the future with Barcelona as a coach. We wish you the best in Qatar! Te amamos viejo! Visca Barca!  Edit: fuck guys, i'm so stressed out and wrecked from that match. my heads on fire! gonna go catch a run to relax! enjoy!! OMG i just realized THE TREBLE!!!"

Barca,38u27a,rgadd,28,Sat Jun 6 20:48:25 2015 UTC,"I agree, I thought Pogba was brilliant. I think he'd do great in a possession based style because his ball retention is absolutely world class. I don't know if there's anybody in the world better than him at fighting off opponents when he's on the ball. Really impressive."
Barca,38u27a,Duke--Nukem,19,Sat Jun 6 21:05:59 2015 UTC,Messi and Busquets.
Barca,38u27a,ace_boogie,8,Sat Jun 6 21:52:01 2015 UTC,"With Messi it is different, his is more down to his quick feet and center of gravity than pure strength which is what I'm talking about. As for Busquets, I honestly feel you could argue for Pogba but I will give that one to you, Busquets might just be the best."

Imagine if Suarez had started to listen to the fans who doubted him in the first half of the season (which was actually pretty decent for him). Imagine if Iniesta had left after a rough season last year. We wouldn't be here with a treble in our hands.

Barca,38u27a,booksaid,8,Sat Jun 6 20:50:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, let's put one of the shortest players in the back with the trophy where no one can see him. Perfect planning."
Barca,38u27a,TheGreatXavi,6,Sat Jun 6 20:51:44 2015 UTC,R/soccer is downright shit right now
Barca,38u27a,Tensten,10,Sat Jun 6 20:58:20 2015 UTC,so Messi is not making goal and suddenly there are so many ronaldo fanboys coming out their closet saying he doesnt do anything. Fuck them hes contributed all 3 goals. Fuck ronaldo fanboys
Barca,38u27a,exsorest,6,Sat Jun 6 21:00:36 2015 UTC,"Special praise for Pique and Rakitic. Guy who was our only defender who managed to win balls in air and to Rakitic wherever ball was he was there. Helping defense and then running with ball and feeding ball to Messi which later ended with goal. Also created good chances for Suarez, Pique and Neymar too. Goal was deserved for him."
Barca,38u27a,ATCule,7,Sat Jun 6 21:09:27 2015 UTC,The team really deserved it this year. We went from crisis mode and almost firing Lucho to equaling what our beloved Pep did in 2009. I still can't believe the crazy season we had. Let's all enjoy this day because we are gunna remember it for a long time. Visca Barca!
Barca,38u27a,Seffor,8,Sat Jun 6 21:28:14 2015 UTC,"This win was very bittersweet. I can't believe this will be Xavi's last game for Barça. We will never see his magical passes, and his enchanting ball control. We will never see his humbleness, and his respect to everyone. We will never ever have a player like Xavi. A leader on and off the pitch. A legend player, and a legend person. I'm glad he lifted all the trophies, one last time.   TO XAVI!   Gracias Xavi, Thank you!"
Barca,38u27a,giraz,8,Sat Jun 6 21:13:00 2015 UTC,"People are so quick to jump on the Barca hate train for embellishing, while ignoring the fact that the Juve players were doing cynical fouls all game. That's a joke."
Barca,38u27a,ae77,3,Sat Jun 6 21:24:43 2015 UTC,"The amount of comments everywhere saying that juve deserved to win are ridiculous and unfair. I think both teams today showed they deserved to be in the final and put on a great display, but we showed why we are the best in the world. The whole team showed up today, and what a special way to end this crazy season."
Barca,38u27a,darthvader7888,3,Sat Jun 6 21:56:30 2015 UTC,Nerve wracking second half. Juventus played great. Buffon is a legend. Marchisio is unbelievable.   We came through with a great team performance. Treble baby!
Barca,38u27a,Deadpool2003,3,Sat Jun 6 21:10:15 2015 UTC,"The record number of CL trophies for a single player is 6 right? Really hope Messi surpasses it but the clock's running against him. Can't believe he's already 28 :(   I don't think we'll win it next season since we'll be weaker with Xavi and Alves gone and the transfer ban. Plus a decline after winning a treble is only natural, only way to go from there is down. There's a reason no one has ever repeated the CL. Messi will be 29 then :( You never know though anything can happen when you have Messi on your team."

Said that... Going to Qatar and becoming an ambassador for them is an insult that erases anything he's even done outside of the football pitch, tarnishing forever his legacy, to be accomplice of the thousands of deaths and the slavery just for a few millions when you've made more than a hundred million euros already is just wrong... and i hope, he reconsiders it during the summer... even if is a naive hope... because its a lot of money for him and his family (1m net euros for each of his bros and father for whatever they will do there)."

Barca,38ub8i,milom,26,Sun Jun 7 08:58:10 2015 UTC,I love Neymar. Best signing in the past 2 years simply because he has so many more years left in him!
Barca,38ub8i,Kayhead996,12,Sat Jun 6 22:36:56 2015 UTC,and because there hasn't been that many signings? ;)
Barca,38ub8i,Hedegaard,3,Sun Jun 7 00:04:30 2015 UTC,Truly there have been some. He is the one talented kid the stuck.
Barca,38ub8i,cedula4,3,Sun Jun 7 01:30:02 2015 UTC,Well I was comparing him to all of our signings last summer too!
Barca,38ub8i,Kayhead996,3,Sun Jun 7 02:08:03 2015 UTC,I would argue Suarez and Neymar are tied.
Barca,38ub8i,MayIHaveAHug,3,Sun Jun 7 02:19:48 2015 UTC,I just think Neymar has the edge because he's still so young and his ceiling is huge
Barca,38ub8i,Kayhead996,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:33:08 2015 UTC,That's why I think they are even tbh. Suarez was IMO more integral to our success this season than Neymar.
Barca,38ub8i,MayIHaveAHug,2,Sun Jun 7 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"Although I agree that Suarez has been integral to our success this season, the biggest reason we got to where we were (besides Messi) was because of Neymar's role at the beginning of the season while Suarez was out and getting used to the side"
Barca,38ub8i,Kayhead996,4,Sun Jun 7 03:24:02 2015 UTC,"In the end MSN are a unit and the reason they were so good is because they have a great understanding. I just feel Suarez brings the same amount as Neymar going forward but brings other elements to the team. He presses like a motherfucker(notice Pirlo in the game? Probably not, Suarez made him ineffective), he ""liberated"" Messi, defends set pieces well and his movement off the ball is incredible.   My hope is 10 years down the road Neymar will still be with us and we'll look back on his transfer as one of the most important in our history but as of right now, Suarez is better."
Barca,38ub8i,MayIHaveAHug,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:04:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah you do make a good point, but I still believe Neymar is just as if not more as important than Suarez is to the team. Remember, Neymar just tied Messi and Ronaldo for goals in the Champions League and he's only 22!"
Barca,38ub8i,Kayhead996,2,Sun Jun 7 13:39:56 2015 UTC,Imagine if he stayed the rest of his career and didn't get fat and lazy (and injured) like the previous Brazilian prodigies and was so influenced by Suarez's tireless work ethic that he became the next generation's role model for it.

Barca,38ub8i,idonteversleep,6,Sat Jun 6 23:55:16 2015 UTC,"I would really like him to improve his passing as a fair amount of moves break down because it's one of his relatively weaker qualities. However, this has been a great season. Almost 40 goals for a 23yr old wide-forward - brilliant."
Barca,38ub8i,arkhamandcheese,3,Sun Jun 7 09:51:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. If he can improve his final ball to Suarez or Messi, He'll become an absolute beast. At the moment he is a bit lacking in that department which results into his lack of assists. But In terms of finishing off chances, he's already one of the best."
Barca,38ub8i,Abhi_714,3,Sun Jun 7 11:01:38 2015 UTC,"its quite ironic, last season he was assisting a lot more but his confidence in front of the goal was pretty low.  i prefer this version of ney anyday,besides that i have a feeling that the next year's version of neymar will be even better!"

Barca,38uwv3,Not_Tom_Brady,49,Sun Jun 7 02:13:05 2015 UTC,"Also a Juve fan. Congratulations on the win and a historic second treble, you guys deserved it.  It was nice to see that there was no bad blood between the teams before, during and after the match. The Suarez and Evra thing was a non-factor and everyone involved acted like a professional."
Barca,38uwv3,droidonomy,18,Sun Jun 7 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"Great team you guys have, absolute workhorse in Tevez. Pogba impressed me quite a bit, praying we get him. He plays with a lot of maturity(except in those silly fouls), controls the ball extremely well, and he'll only get better. Incredible how out of all teams like Chelsea, Bayern, Real Madrid, Paris, you guys made it. Juve should never be underestimated, but your team didn't cost the hundreds of millions all the other teams in your path did and you still made it. One of my great friends is a lifelong Juve fan, and if Barca were to lose to anyone tbh I wouldn't have a problem with Juve. Good luck!"
Barca,38uwv3,xFragg,10,Sun Jun 7 02:35:02 2015 UTC,Saw the match in a bar with bunch of Barca fans and the mutual respect with the few Juve fans that showed up was really great to see. It really reflected the historic posture both clubs have.
Barca,38uwv3,vizious29,6,Sun Jun 7 03:55:51 2015 UTC,Thank you! Super fun game to watch. I was comfortable for about 15 minutes then started to worry when Juve starting shooting. Then they scored and I was holding my head. Really tough game. I really like a lot of players on Juve.
Barca,38uwv3,Barca8,7,Sun Jun 7 05:55:14 2015 UTC,You guys played an amazing game. Fought till the end. Much love and respect to Juve. Hope to see you guys next year same time :).

Barca,38uwv3,justafanpassingby,2,Sun Jun 7 07:23:35 2015 UTC,"great final, i m proud of Juve's performances in last years, especially after being relegated they fought back and now they reached CL final.  if it wasnt for Barca qualifying i would have rooted for Juve (i have sympathies for them since the Del Piero,Nedved days)  for Pirlo and Buffon .  By the way, tell Vidal to chill out .   Better luck next year!"
Barca,38uwv3,XsTream23,5,Sun Jun 7 10:46:12 2015 UTC,"Go get them next year! You're no fluke. With Dybala by your side, give Buffon the CL trophy that he deserves."

I kept walking down the streets until I heard the match noise, I ran and found a small cofee shop displaying the game on a wall so I said hello grabbed a chair and sat, everyone looked weirdly at me but I thought that was because oh how well I was dressed while they were in flip flops and shorts, well..turns out that wasnt a coffee shop, but just some guys sitting next to their house with a projector while this unknown formally dressed dude grabbed a chair and sat in their yard.  I explained the situation and they all had a laugh and were very friendly and told me to stay and brought me drinks and a shisha (like a bong but not weed).

Barca,38u8vy,justafanpassingby,17,Sat Jun 6 21:47:28 2015 UTC,We beat Atleti 4/4 so you can make that 5/5
Barca,38u8vy,jairzinho,4,Sun Jun 7 00:53:40 2015 UTC,Who's the one we didn't beat in order to get the treble?
Barca,38u8vy,WillAlwaysLie,17,Sun Jun 7 00:07:42 2015 UTC,Barcelona beat them to get the treble as well. 👍

Barca,38u8vy,ctrlshftn,13,Sun Jun 7 04:40:54 2015 UTC,Hopefully we make it 6 trophies again like 08-09.
Barca,38u8vy,Baowsy,25,Sun Jun 7 16:27:40 2015 UTC,and madrid got nothing :) that just makes me happy!
Barca,38u8vy,YoSoyMilkChocolate,8,Sun Jun 7 00:56:33 2015 UTC,"TIL that Celtic and PSV have each won a treble.  I'm surprised that Real Madrid, AC Milan, Juventus, Benfica, Liverpool, and Arsenal have never won trebles considering the qualities of their squads throughout history. In Real Madrid's case I'm happy though, because we've won 2 trebles before they've even won one. Actually, Madrid hasn't even completed the domestic double since 88/89."
Barca,38u8vy,polechi33,4,Sat Jun 6 23:14:18 2015 UTC,Yeah... they only have two doublets in their 10 champions. So that shows that they haven;t really dominated the game when they won those champions. On the other hand we have three doublets and two trebles.
Barca,38u8vy,polechi33,4,Sat Jun 6 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"How many Real Madrid has? Wait...none! and on their 10 champions leagues, they only got two doublets. On the other hand in the 5 champions we have, we got three doublets and two tebles. It shows that we have dominated the years we have won the champions and have really earn it."

Barca,38uatt,TsaFack,15,Sat Jun 6 21:56:52 2015 UTC,"Of all the stats that impress me most, it's easily Suarez's assists.  I never thought the guy would setup others and be as unselfish as he was.  Can't wait to see what these 3 do over a full season."

Barca,38uatt,konoplya,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:07:38 2015 UTC,"I agree. He's still having those moments where he does something expecting a certain move or reaction from Messi, Ney etc and he doesn't quite have that chemistry with them yet. You can see the frustration on his face. The ""misses"" though have gotten less frequent, actually worked out for goals, and more and more narrow. Wait until he has the equivalent of a full season with these guys and he'll jump right in to that little pinball machine we run in opponents boxes. Then...holy crap watch out world. Those poor poor nets shaking at the thought."
Barca,38uatt,LedZepGuy,9,Sun Jun 7 19:12:20 2015 UTC,And 21 assists!

Every year so far that I've bought a copy of that year's FIFA, Barcelona won that season's Champions League.  My first-ever copy was FIFA 05 for PS2. Barcelona won in 2006. Then FIFA 08. Barcelona won in 2009. FIFA 10 for PS3, they won in 2011. I abused that version until I finally caved and bought FIFA 15 last September.

Barca,38tfr5,Hedegaard,3,Sat Jun 6 20:06:29 2015 UTC,That last one had to be a yellow for Bonucci. He cut Suarez's legs at the beginning of that move.

Barca,38tfr5,egcg119,6,Sat Jun 6 20:18:42 2015 UTC,Messi has had an amazing game whether he scores or not
Barca,38tfr5,giraz,5,Sat Jun 6 20:19:10 2015 UTC,Last Barcelona game for Xavi.  Tears will be coming.

Barca,38tfr5,arctiquer,4,Sat Jun 6 19:18:43 2015 UTC,That's one way to stop Messi. Ugh.
Barca,38tfr5,Traddwill,6,Sat Jun 6 19:29:50 2015 UTC,Love how Messi always tried to hold onto the ball when he goes down.
Barca,38tfr5,tgames56,5,Sat Jun 6 19:29:53 2015 UTC,Vidal with more fouls than all of Barça!
Barca,38tfr5,NoFapMonster,4,Sat Jun 6 19:49:26 2015 UTC,Prediction for second half: Vidal tackles more players to deal with anger over his haircut
Barca,38tfr5,Gaboni,5,Sat Jun 6 19:52:21 2015 UTC,fuck

Barca,38tfr5,xFragg,3,Sat Jun 6 20:36:12 2015 UTC,Neymar had to make up for the goal he was disallowed.
Barca,38tfr5,Zaratthustra,4,Sat Jun 6 20:44:14 2015 UTC,"I've been on this sub for over 2 years. Following every game, one eye on TV, one eye on the match thread. Feel great to share this with you all!!"

Barca,38tfr5,Vertical_Passing,10,Sat Jun 6 17:46:29 2015 UTC,"Predicted line-up and bench really. No surprises there.  And Xavi better gets his minutes, will be his 600th official game at senior level for club and country."
Barca,38tfr5,XsTream23,5,Sat Jun 6 17:48:07 2015 UTC,It would be easy to see Xavi coming on to defend a lead and calm the tempo. Hope it happens!
Barca,38tfr5,IhateAngryBirds,8,Sat Jun 6 17:49:27 2015 UTC,"Masip, Douglas, Montoya, Vermaelen, Sergi Roberto, Samper, Munir and Sandro didn't make the final squad for the UCL final against Juventus and will watch from the stands."
Barca,38tfr5,briliad,6,Sat Jun 6 17:46:33 2015 UTC,how weird would it be to be in the stands and one of those guys are sitting next to you.
Barca,38tfr5,tgames56,13,Sat Jun 6 17:53:06 2015 UTC,No Douglas? Lucho is experimenting today again ....

Barca,38tfr5,_FRANKENSTEIN_,3,Sat Jun 6 18:56:50 2015 UTC,Vidal is really asking to be sent off.
Barca,38tfr5,cydonian66,3,Sat Jun 6 19:09:55 2015 UTC,Can't see Vidal lasting the whole game honestly. He's acting very rudely for no reason
Barca,38tfr5,tgames56,3,Sat Jun 6 19:10:58 2015 UTC,not much from Suarez so far.
Barca,38tfr5,Zaratthustra,3,Sat Jun 6 19:17:24 2015 UTC,"I think there's something wrong with Messi, he's not running or dribbling :("
Barca,38tfr5,ohhlalaa,3,Sat Jun 6 19:22:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe saving energy, Maybe juve will press high late in 2nd half to force barca mistakes. Maybe barca will press late in the game,if one thing is guaranteed of messi its his sniffing power of a game dynamic,regardless of his fitness levels."

Barca,38tfr5,_FRANKENSTEIN_,3,Sat Jun 6 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"We need to score early in 2nd half, can't allow possibility of them scoring on extra time"
Barca,38tfr5,Milad731,3,Sat Jun 6 19:37:46 2015 UTC,Everyone's so focused on Messi that I'm not sure he'll score. He's taking what the game is giving him though.
Barca,38tfr5,watafaq,3,Sat Jun 6 19:42:02 2015 UTC,a little expecto patronum here some expelliarmus there and tie it all together with some alohomora and or wizard should unlock the defense.

Barca,38tfr5,YO_putThatBagBackON,3,Sat Jun 6 20:27:10 2015 UTC,Damn! Messi was running so fast that his momentum just took him ahead of the ball.
Barca,38tfr5,Not_Tom_Brady,3,Sat Jun 6 20:25:59 2015 UTC,don't know why they would sub morata off. that guy has a nose for goal.
Barca,38tfr5,LiterallyProbably,3,Sat Jun 6 20:30:38 2015 UTC,"Bonucci finally did what he was supposed to do. He hacked Suarez all game long, and finally injured him."
Barca,38v72w,footballwhileworking,11,Sun Jun 7 02:43:33 2015 UTC,I thought he was goin to have a press conference soon? And I'm 90% sure he's going to leave
Barca,38v72w,VOROBI,8,Sun Jun 7 03:39:24 2015 UTC,"He said he will make his decision after the CL final, so we should have it any time now. And, unfortunately, I agree with your odds..."
Barca,38v72w,iagolima,2,Sun Jun 7 04:01:49 2015 UTC,"It never even crossed my mind that while it was Xavi's last game for Barça, it could have been Dani's too."
Barca,38v72w,HappyHomecow,6,Sun Jun 7 15:28:47 2015 UTC,When I see him celebrating with all the players and staff you can only think that his mind is set on staying. Where will he find the chemistry he has with this team?  But I still think he's leaving after his talks on the press conference.
Barca,38v72w,Blaugrana1990,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:19:25 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same when he was celebrating yesterday night. I don't understand why he wants to leave. He will not go to a better team and he will most likely win less trophies. His teammates seem to like him too and he has a great connection with Messi on the field.
Barca,38v72w,Flam1,2,Sun Jun 7 11:02:32 2015 UTC,"I think his problem isn't with the team or anything like that, but more disappointment with how the board treated him and his contract renewals."
Barca,38v72w,QueenRitz,2,Sun Jun 7 13:41:53 2015 UTC,"But wouldn't the new board give him hope? I mean this board is shit everyone and their mom knows it, so why not sign with this board and work something out with the new one. There is no way Aleix Vidal will link up with Messi like how Dani Alves does. It's stupid letting him go."
Barca,38v72w,xFragg,2,Sun Jun 7 15:28:25 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, but I think he addressed the whole board-change thing by saying something like, ""The board change doesn't make my decisions, I do.""   I could be wrong though, I can't seem to find the original interview.... Does anyone else have it?"
Barca,38v72w,QueenRitz,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:27:27 2015 UTC,"He had said that he feels he has amazing support from all the fans and players, but not from the club. He feels he has been treated badly, and that the club only wants to sign him a new contract because of the transfer ban."
Barca,38v72w,Mentosfruitcore,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:21:36 2015 UTC,"That's like saying you want to leave your girlfriend becuase her mother hates you. If you love her, you stay."
Barca,38v72w,droid750,2,Sun Jun 7 13:24:28 2015 UTC,"If you by ""her"" mean the club, then it is ""her"" that he feels disrespect him.   You can find interviews on the web for more. He did say after the final that he ""would love to stay"", but that he doesn't know what's going to happen.  Let's just wait it out. If he truly wants to leave, for whatever reason, we can't do anything about it."
Barca,38v72w,Mentosfruitcore,3,Sun Jun 7 13:29:55 2015 UTC,I want him to stay but he''ll probably leave. Now would be right time for him to do so.
Barca,38v72w,-Token,2,Sun Jun 7 05:10:30 2015 UTC,"It has been reported that he's considering an offer from Italy and if the rumors regarding Vidal are true, then it's logical that this is it for Alves. A damn shame - as the greatest right-back in Barcelona's storied history, it would have been nicer if this felt a little more mutual a la Valdés, Xavi, et al, but I hope he enjoys the twilight of his career as it's well deserved."
Barca,38v72w,arkhamandcheese,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:22:57 2015 UTC,"If he were to leave, where do you think he would go?"
Barca,38v72w,AJMcCoy612,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:13:28 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go with him staying. Fingers crossed.
Barca,38u9t0,ir7425,8,Sat Jun 6 21:48:12 2015 UTC,That sucks as a player but SO AWESOME that he gets to celebrate in a different way. Fuck yea Barça!!!
Barca,38u9t0,YO_putThatBagBackON,5,Sat Jun 6 22:12:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I saw his broken photo earlier today after Juventus match in 2003, felt so bad that moment."

Barca,38u9t0,droid750,3,Sun Jun 7 06:31:50 2015 UTC,"Here's a photo  Btw, that was his last CL match as barca didn't qualify to CL the following season."

Barca,38u9d3,justafanpassingby,10,Sat Jun 6 21:44:33 2015 UTC,"He didnt cover well defensively, especially for that first goal. And i doubt they'll sell him for anything less than 70 mill with all this hype around him. He's not worth that kind of money, rather we spend it on the likes of verrati than him"
Barca,38u9d3,Mr_Constantine,30,Sat Jun 6 23:32:24 2015 UTC,"If James is worth €80 million then so is Pogba. Unfortunately that's what you have to pay these days to get the best young talents. Pogba, in my opinion, was great today and has been getting better ever since joining Juve. I would be very happy if he joined Barça."
Barca,38u9d3,imfatal,6,Sat Jun 6 21:47:44 2015 UTC,"Well James proved his worth ,he was the best madrid player this season"
Barca,38u9d3,DivineVibrations,20,Sat Jun 6 21:51:38 2015 UTC,"First of all, James was definitely not Madrid's best player. Cristiano was a scoring and assisting machine and when Modrić was healthy he was clearly the best midfielder. And second, I feel that Pogba has proven himself just as much. He's a key player in a top European team, he showed great ability in a CL final, and he was out on the 23 man shortlist for Ballon d'Or. Pogba has warranted a similar price tag."
Barca,38u9d3,WillAlwaysLie,3,Sat Jun 6 22:01:29 2015 UTC,"Lol some people here will say anything here to discredit Ronaldo. Let's not be delusional please. We all know who the best Madrid player was. Also, James has proven his worth but Pogba hasn't by reaching and playing well in a CL final?"
Barca,38u9d3,DivineVibrations,0,Sun Jun 7 07:32:25 2015 UTC,Ronaldo was best Madrid player in first half but James was pretty consistent(except first couple of months) and players quality should never be measured on the basis of no. goals scored
Barca,38u9d3,WillAlwaysLie,6,Sun Jun 7 07:49:59 2015 UTC,"Second, i hate the fucker and i think he has dropped a level since his manU and earlier madrid years, but he is still madrid's best as of right now."

Barca,38u9d3,EpicChiguire,10,Sat Jun 6 22:38:54 2015 UTC,Oh. I thought you were talking about James.
Barca,38u9d3,babajafar,-10,Sat Jun 6 22:40:26 2015 UTC,Ronaldo was better I think. But James was incredible. A future Ballon d'Or winner in the making. Pogba is nowhere near his level.
Barca,38u9d3,xFragg,12,Sat Jun 6 22:58:59 2015 UTC,Honestly I think he is at most worthy of 40-45M.
Barca,38u9d3,Filthy_Badger,6,Sat Jun 6 21:49:10 2015 UTC,"Emmmm... No. He's talented and all, but I'd rather develop our talent or buy someone younger. I don't know, with all this buzz around him and also Mino Raiola... I'd rather stay away from him."
Barca,38u9d3,SkintCrayon,13,Sun Jun 7 02:51:38 2015 UTC,I was honestly expecting alot more...
Barca,38u9d3,tajingu,7,Sat Jun 6 21:46:54 2015 UTC,"You have to realize he's a 22 year old kid playing against the best club in the world against the best trio in Spanish history goals-wise. He handled himself well, didn't look very shakey, except for that long pass that he messed up on the first touch. Remember he still has what? 10 years left in him before a decline. Neymar was the same last year, and look at him this year. IMO Pogba will only get better."
Barca,38u9d3,JurijFedorov,2,Sun Jun 7 02:39:49 2015 UTC,"Particularly in the first half, he looked like an 80m card machine. His foul on messi to earn his yellow was a temper tantrum anyone could see coming well before it happened."

Barca,38u9d3,xFragg,9,Sat Jun 6 21:54:01 2015 UTC,Veratti is a better fit for us. Great player.
Barca,38u9d3,JurijFedorov,10,Sat Jun 6 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"Pogba would give us a physical presence higher up midfield, like a charging bull. He's another line of attack, not that we need one based on today but I love how Veratti reads a game and he's more of a ""Barca player""."
Barca,38u9d3,TsaFack,2,Sat Jun 6 23:45:06 2015 UTC,"Por que no Los dos? I mean if you think about it, I don't want to seem like a galactico and encourage buying the most expensive in the world, but with Sergi, and Rafinha on the bench think about how good our midfield will be for the coming 5+ years. We don't need other positions, besides RB maybe. However it would bother me La Masia players would have a confidence drop, the flip side however is that they'd have more reason to push themselves harder."
Barca,38u9d3,iniesta123,3,Sun Jun 7 02:43:17 2015 UTC,Yes... you are right. But if we have to buy one it could be him. But personally I think Rafinha and Samper should get a chance first. If everything goes well they should become very good.
Barca,38u9d3,xFragg,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:07:48 2015 UTC,I haven't seen Samper play actually. What type of player is he? Is he more of a CDM or a CM? What are his strong points?
Barca,38u9d3,iniesta123,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:57:58 2015 UTC,The few matches I have seen in in he was very stellar. A bit of a Busquets role I think. It's hard to say how good he will become. But he is very intelligent and a team player.
Barca,38u9d3,efarfan,3,Sun Jun 7 15:40:20 2015 UTC,"He is definitely good and one game doesn't define a player, but he is worth 40m."
Barca,38u9d3,xFragg,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:54:45 2015 UTC,Especially if it's UCL final because everyone play with their hearts.Even average player play world class because they know they might not get this opportunity again.
Barca,38u9d3,efarfan,17,Sat Jun 6 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"Totally disagree with you on this. On a stage this big, it is very often that a young player will cave under pressure. Pogba showed great maturity and composure, his performance should not be written off as adrenaline."
Barca,38u9d3,Aj16ay,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:03:45 2015 UTC,i am sure messi could've done better than this
Barca,38u9d3,Kluey,2,Sat Jun 6 23:28:35 2015 UTC,"You're comparing Messi to Pogba right now. Messi was 10x better than Pogba at his age, there's no argument there. Pogba handled himself very well for a 22 year old. Most 22 year olds are graduating university, this guy was a starter for the biggest European club final of the season. Give him some props."
Barca,38u9d3,Aj16ay,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:45:16 2015 UTC,"Really, you're comparing world's greatest football player with an upcoming good midfielder"
Barca,38u9d3,nnug,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:36:02 2015 UTC,Especially if it's UCL final because everyone play with their hearts
Barca,38u9d3,Aj16ay,6,Sun Jun 7 08:32:04 2015 UTC,He was incredible. Got out of tight spaces constantly. Won balls in the air all the time. He's the best up coming midfielder in the world IMO.
Barca,38u9d3,egcg119,3,Sun Jun 7 01:57:54 2015 UTC,"People are quick to judge him. I understand the 80 mil is a lot, but you're buying a world class player with at least 10 years left in him. We paid 80 for Suarez and he has half of that. Granted Suarez is the best striker in the world, I feel as if Pogba is definitely top 3 young talents, behind Neymar. And he recently signed a 5 year contract w Juve which drives his price up. Not to sound like a Madrid douche, but shirt sales will also go up making the club more money. Pogba is a definite future top 3 for ballon d or as well in MY eyes."
Barca,38u9d3,Aj16ay,2,Sun Jun 7 02:56:23 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. He may not be worth it yet, but he will absolutely be worth more than that after a season or two with us. He will not only fit in nicely, but raise the level of the team."
Barca,38u9d3,lerhond,7,Sun Jun 7 03:29:14 2015 UTC,Too expensive
Barca,38u9d3,IhateAngryBirds,7,Sat Jun 6 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"Based on what? Unless you're the accountant of the club or something, ""expensive"" has no meaning.   If the club can budget properly and afford him, they should get him."
Barca,38u9d3,Seffor,7,Sun Jun 7 00:07:46 2015 UTC,"Just a personal preference actually. I despise Real's galactico idea/strategy, and we would be no different if we keep this spending up.  I'd rather give midfield chances to Rafinha, Samper, Kaptoum, and possibly make a more shrewd signing through Gündoğan or Óliver"
Barca,38u9d3,fcb3323,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:24:50 2015 UTC,Seems to be working out with MSN
Barca,38u9d3,godie,2,Sun Jun 7 01:24:57 2015 UTC,"If you spend €100m on the best players, it usually won't turn out bad. But like I said, it's a preference thing. I don't want to lose our identity with La Masia. I think Óliver has just as much potential as Pogba, especially in our system"
Barca,38u9d3,jairzinho,6,Sun Jun 7 01:31:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also, the thing with Neymar and Suarez is that their talent really can't be replicated, no upcoming youngsters are even close to that level.  Pogba? He's good, but Oliver Torres, Samper, Kovacic could be as good down the line, and the likes of Gundogan and Verratti are comparable now.   He's also not going to be a sure-fire starter with Iniesta and Rakitic around, whereas Neymar and Suarez were bought to slot right in. Doesn't make sense to spend 80m on a rotation player, and benching either Iniesta or Rakitic for Pogba is out of the question."
Barca,38u9d3,xFragg,0,Sun Jun 7 04:41:48 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't think we've been linked with Torres besides some (false?) reports that we would have first option on him because of the Villa deal. But I rate him so highly, I genuinely believe he will be one of the best midfielders soon. Also hope Kaptoum can recover soon because he's a talented player from what I've seen"
Barca,38u9d3,ILikeMiley,2,Sun Jun 7 04:59:16 2015 UTC,Make him change his haircut and then we can buy him. :)

I'll always have the memory of him picking the ball out of the net at Crystal Palace and him honestly believing that we could win 13-0 and fix the goal difference (Obviously, that fell into a nightmare as well).

Barca,38s3xp,honamdoh,28,Sat Jun 6 09:37:00 2015 UTC,"Nothing against Vidal, he's a good player. But I really wish they'd just reach agreement with Dani. He'd be the right back we need for the next season or two, no problem.  And although Vidal is good, I'm not sure he'll be able to fill Dani's shoes anytime soon. Let's see though."
Barca,38s3xp,beskidtbawler,5,Sat Jun 6 10:24:51 2015 UTC,"I heard the price alves was asking for was too high, maybe it was the right thing to do"
Barca,38s3xp,Mr_Constantine,0,Sat Jun 6 12:30:57 2015 UTC,"He could ask for quite a lot without it being too much, in my opinion."
Barca,38s3xp,beskidtbawler,7,Sat Jun 6 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"No, if for a new contract he asks for quite a lot - which is most likely - then its too much.  Right now we pay him 120,000 euros per week, thats more than Macherano (100,000), 26 yr old jordi alba on the other flank (75,000) and close to neymar's (150,000). And remember, alves is already 31 so he doesnt have many years to play the way he plays, also remember if he wants to renew this contract he'll want around double or so of the present salary meaning 225k or so.  I would love it if alves would stay (who wouldnt?) but i dont want the club bending to overpay him: Even though he's been amazing this season, he's been average and bad occasionally in previous seasons and he isnt getting any younger. Plus we have people rotting in the bench, getting paid for nothing throughout this season, that play his position: montoya, adrianodouglas.  Might as well use them."

Barca,38s3xp,polechi33,10,Sun Jun 7 01:55:44 2015 UTC,10 million feels quite cheap. Im guessing part of that might be not exercising our right to buy back Dennis Suarez.
Barca,38s3xp,ksalama,13,Sat Jun 6 10:24:34 2015 UTC,"That would be stupid. Losing out on a potentially great attacking midfielder, for a player who isn't even an actual Right Back.  They could just have a deal that doesn't involve Denis."
Barca,38s3xp,johan14cruyff,8,Sat Jun 6 11:20:10 2015 UTC,"It would be extremely stupid, hence why I dont put it passed this board to think of doing something like this. I hope when a new board comes in the first thing they do is pay that buy back option."
Barca,38s3xp,ksalama,2,Sat Jun 6 11:26:32 2015 UTC,"Doubt even they'd let him go for peanuts. Perhaps a Samper, Adama or Grimaldo loan is part of the deal?"

Barca,38s3xp,polechi33,5,Sun Jun 7 01:59:14 2015 UTC,"Alba wasn't a FB, neither was Juanfran. Worked out for them."
Barca,38s3xp,_sic,6,Sat Jun 6 12:15:27 2015 UTC,"Alba played as an FB for 3 years before we bought him. He didn't just show promise, he showed actual quality. Of course, Vidal could become one of the best and I'm not saying we shouldn't buy him. I'm just saying that we should pay them the total amount instead of giving away Denis."
Barca,38s3xp,johan14cruyff,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:18:15 2015 UTC,Who is saying we are giving them Suarez?
Barca,38s3xp,polechi33,2,Sun Jun 7 01:58:39 2015 UTC,"That will never happen.   Barca will pay Sevilla 10 million euros and there will be no add ons. There was speculation that the fee would be reduced by the inclusion of Denis Suarez, who is on loan in Andalusia, but that was not the case in the end. What is possible, although hasn't been spoke about yet, is that Sevilla could loan another player from Barcelona.    From SPORT."
Barca,38s3xp,egcg119,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:18:40 2015 UTC,"*if vidal is to be bought, selling Denis was part of the deal. But by no means we can never exercise the buy back, I think we will. We must!"

Barca,38s3xp,Kluey,3,Sat Jun 6 10:43:12 2015 UTC,What m8? Aleix is a great passer of the ball. Of course he's good enough to start lol
Barca,38s3xp,urbeer,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:17:03 2015 UTC,He's obviously a stopgap. Or a Montoya replacement if Dani somehow decides to stay.   Ugh... I wish we didn't let Danilo slip.
Barca,38s3xp,darthvader7888,3,Sat Jun 6 14:42:08 2015 UTC,"I understand this is bad in terms of Dani potentially leaving, but is he good enough to start over either Montoya or Douglas (serious question, obviously Douglas is our current least good option)?"
Barca,38s3xp,ohyeah_mamaman,3,Sat Jun 6 12:56:33 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, from what I've read and watched he is a very good replacement. He plays the same attack minded style of dani and is strong defensively."

Barca,38s3xp,polechi33,0,Sun Jun 7 01:53:13 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say Montoya is better than Douglas personally
Barca,38s3xp,mrnoor,7,Sat Jun 6 14:06:16 2015 UTC,Douglas sucked in the fucking Brazilian league and he got rekt by a third division team. Montoya isn't a world beater but he isn't THAT bad.
Barca,38s3xp,darthvader7888,3,Sat Jun 6 14:56:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly this, to me, feels more like Adriano's replacement than Dani's. Adriano is/was our versatile player who'd fill in anywhere if needed, but he's clearly not up to it anymore and (from what I understand) Vidal can do that for us."
Barca,38s3xp,AvocadoCake,4,Sat Jun 6 15:22:56 2015 UTC,"pff beat me by 15seconds, anyway it's odd, wonder if he'll join now or in January. And saying ""He will sign"" is also very odd considering we can't sign officially at the moment"
Barca,38s3xp,IhateAngryBirds,11,Sat Jun 6 09:38:35 2015 UTC,No probably a pre contract agreement.
Barca,38s3xp,IhateAngryBirds,9,Sat Jun 6 09:49:29 2015 UTC,Hope he doesn't get CL locked with Sevilla
Barca,38s3xp,CrippledCrip,4,Sat Jun 6 09:51:41 2015 UTC,I have to imagine there would be something in the agreement that he won't play in the CL with them. In which case that would screw us in the knockouts.
Barca,38s3xp,TechnicolorJarl,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:53:16 2015 UTC,I was wondering about that. Are we anticipating he will sign after our transfer window been ends?

Barca,38uvro,Zaratthustra,3,Sun Jun 7 02:20:26 2015 UTC,how bout that hand ball early in the game that would of most likely given barca a 2-0 lead
Barca,38uvro,brownsouljas209,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:54:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call that a penalty. His arm was along with his body, which is called ""natural arm position"". If it was stretched out, you can call it a penalty.  Another factor to take in judging this kind of situations is to determine whether or not was this a 100% goal-scoring opportunity. Neymar didn't shot that ball towards goal, so it wasn't 100% goal-scoring opportunity. If we look at it as a possible prevented assist, it still wouldn't be 100% goal-scoring chance because Suarez was marked."
Barca,38uvro,TheDInho510,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:13:38 2015 UTC,"I'd call it a penalty, for me it shouldn't be about whether it was intentional or not but whether it affected the direction of play, in that case it definitely did, just like the case with Neymar's goal"

Barca,38reg5,Oliverz5,19,Sat Jun 6 04:28:09 2015 UTC,This might be one of the most american analyses i've ever seen.
Barca,38reg5,syn69,-1,Sat Jun 6 08:39:55 2015 UTC,"How? Because they don't use imperial measurements? Because it's narrated by an American? Because it references a popular sport in the States? If Clyde Tyldesley did the same thing with imperial units comparing to rugby, you wouldn't say anything.  You can appreciate the beauty of the goal no matter what, so no need to tie demographics in to the mix. It's a great goal no matter how you analyze it, and the fact that well known American sports program took the time to look at this in this much depth matters a lot more than your pretentiousness on the internet."
Barca,38reg5,pcush,8,Sat Jun 6 13:51:55 2015 UTC,"This isn't really an analysis, it's mostly bringing up weird facts about his goal.   Mentioning that he touched the ball quickly 3 times, measuring the time the ball spent outside x distance of Messi and finding his margin of error when striking the ball doesn't help your understanding of the game at any level.   If you were to analyze this, you would talk about what allowed Messi to score this goal. Would man/zonal marking (whichever they don't use, I don't know) have been better? Did Bilbao press up too high? I'm not saying these are the right questions to ask since I know shit all about strategy, but you get my point."
Barca,38reg5,Poelsemis,3,Sat Jun 6 14:12:10 2015 UTC,When espn does these sports science clips they aren't analysing the goal from a tactics breakdown rather a scientific one. I know it's a little quirky but pretty cool non the less.
Barca,38reg5,moonstillidie262,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:29:06 2015 UTC,Spot on. I listened to the gary neville podcast with graham hunter on analysis and most pundits talk about the incident itself rather than how it came to be/how to prevent it from happening. The only interesting point in this was his acceleration with the ball which is insane
Barca,38reg5,tommym109,-5,Sat Jun 6 17:01:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call angles, measurements, and times ""weird facts"" per se, it's pretty much how like, everything, is quantitatively looked at.  While analysis might be the wrong word (meaning you've procured some revelations from the raw numbers using stats), the general gist is one of exploratory basic physics and the like.   Tactics are a completely different topic. They weren't approached in the video (save for ""3 players trap Messi on the sideline, each within 6 feet"") so why mention them? Your argument is invalid."

Barca,38ou46,ncocca,20,Fri Jun 5 17:49:46 2015 UTC,"It's meh. Anyone with decent football history knowledge though understands the difference between european cup and champions league. The difference is practically only in name as nothing else changed.  The important list is european cup and champions league combined. Gento leads that one with 6 titles, an incredible record that only Messi has a somewhat decent chance to equalise or even break. If he doesn't make it, I think no one will. Behind him there's like 8 players from Real Madrid's legendary squad that won five in a row and Costacurta and Maldini that lived through a lot of Milan's golden periods.  Then there are a few more RM players from the old days and the more recent magnificent Seedorf. After that, there are dozens with 3 and that's the jump that Xavi, Iniesta, Messi and Pique can make tomorrow."
Barca,38ou46,Eladir,2,Fri Jun 5 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"The difference is practically only in name as nothing else changed.    Not entirely true. Europa Cup 1 had only league title winners, so there were not multiple participants per country."
Barca,38ou46,jklz,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:48:53 2015 UTC,"Nope. From 1992 that was the last year as european cup to 1993 that was the first year as Champions League, literally nothing was different. The exact same format with only champions entering.  The change you are referring to happened quite a bit later in 1998 where multiple teams per country started competing and overall the format became similar to what it's been for almost 20 years now.  So to come back to my initial point, the name change from European Cup to Champions League was just that, a name change. Thus separating it as two different eras is wrong. Only reason it happens is because it suits the media's needs for pointless records etc."

Don't worry, I'm as culé as ever, and she's unsurprisingly as madridista as ever. I try to wind her up as much as possible though. The other day I got someone on /r/PhotoshopRequest to photoshop a barça shirt over her Real Madrid shirt when she was at the Santiago Bernabeu hahah. Almost stopped talking to me altogether😂"

Barca,38nex4,snk12,9,Fri Jun 5 10:21:47 2015 UTC,"The lineup is not the question, the real tactical discussion lies in the substitutions. If we have a lead by the 80th minute or so, I'd like to see something like Mathieu for Busquets, with Masche pushed to DM while Mathieu is in the back, or maybe even Mathieu for Iniesta with a Masche-Busi defensive duo. If we need a goal, I expect to see Pedro feature at around the 70 minute mark for Iniesta, and Messi dropping back into midfield."
Barca,38nex4,IhateAngryBirds,16,Fri Jun 5 13:19:38 2015 UTC,You don't substitute Iniesta if you need a last minute goal.
Barca,38nex4,coldblade2000,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:07:48 2015 UTC,"I also don't think it's a good idea to drop Messi into midfield if you're looking for a goal.  Better to put Pedro in for whichever forward is having an off day/has the tiredest legs, and keep the service to the front line as excellent as possible."
Barca,38nex4,godie,7,Sat Jun 6 01:45:16 2015 UTC,"I was just starting the discussion ;)  However, I feel like at 70th minute as you said we will try the good old  --Neymar---Suarez---Pedro--  --------------Messi------------  It will help control the game even further, maybe with Xavi in there aswell."
Barca,38nex4,camp_nous,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:50:56 2015 UTC,"Well I think that If everything go according to plans, the subs should be Xavi for Iniesta, Mathie for Mascherano depending of the kind of game he is having, I think the MSN will play the 90 minutes, and don't think there will be a 3rd sub unless we are facing some issues."
Barca,38nex4,godie,24,Fri Jun 5 16:12:38 2015 UTC,Was never any doubt on this lineup

Barca,38nex4,Duke--Nukem,13,Fri Jun 5 14:17:05 2015 UTC,"Or he was just a new manager figuring out his team while dealing with injuries and rotations. It's almost as though his goal all along might have been to have a set, healthy lineup for the season's homestretch."

Barca,38nex4,Duke--Nukem,18,Sat Jun 6 04:25:16 2015 UTC,ter Stegen HAS to produce the best game of his career. He was shaky in the Copa final and I am worried for the first time this season about our goalkeeper's performance.
Barca,38nex4,RayMedia,3,Fri Jun 5 11:02:23 2015 UTC,Yes I also hope he learned from that final.
Barca,38nex4,Duke--Nukem,7,Fri Jun 5 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"If I was Luis Enrique, I'd play Bravo. MatS is amazing but this will be his 2nd final..and it's not just any final, it's the CL final. On the other hand, Bravo has more experience. But what do I know? I'm sure Enrique knows more than I. Edit: why the downvotes guys?"
Barca,38nex4,invice,6,Fri Jun 5 12:56:40 2015 UTC,I'd go with ter Stegen. He helped us get to the final. Plus Bravo hasn't played in weeks. This GK setup is weird but somehow it's worked this season.   Next season I say make ter Stegen a full time starter. They're at the same level but ter Stegen has the age advantage. If Bravo doesn't like the Pinto role (which would be very understandable) I say thank him for his services and let him leave next summer (NOT this one as we can't buy). Don't think we can keep them both happy forever. It's a shame since Bravo was instrumental in getting us the league but we will have to pick one or the other eventually.
Barca,38nex4,TheDInho510,8,Sat Jun 6 01:17:37 2015 UTC,"I'd have done the same. Playing Bravo would be the logical decision. However, ter Stegen needs this type of games for his development and confidence. Let's hope he'll be up to the challenge; he knows he can't fuck this up."
Barca,38nex4,SyntheticDolphin,2,Fri Jun 5 13:07:43 2015 UTC,"He knows he can't fuck this up; therefore, it'll probably result in him thinking about it too much, which'll make him nervous."

Before the finals against Arsenal I had no clue what was going to happen, hence the feeling was rather balanced. Needless to add all those three finals ended in complete exaltation for me.  For some reason, I feel a little nervous about this one. I feel there is a lot riding on this final (no I'm not into betting at all). I'm anxious and restless and can't wait for this match to come closer to kickoff - We have put ourselves in the best position to win this, a fully fit squad, great team chemistry, the form running into this game etc. But I am by no means underestimating Juve, their midfield and Tevez upfront is a little bit intimidating. Maybe that explains my anxiety but then again imagine how intimidated some of their fans must be feeling.   Regardless of the outcome, this football team is my life and it will be till I die.

Barca has played against many 442 teams, so they are familiar with them. However, has Barca ever played (this season) against a 352 formation? Perhaps, Valencia comes to mind, but I don't think they used that formation. A team that is well trained in the back and has a great mid could pose a threat (if executed well) against Barca."

Barca,38ok0p,_sic,2,Fri Jun 5 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"Dani has had one of the best half seasons I have ever seen. The other night vs. Athletic he basically shifted to midfielder to help Messi shake his man marker and was absolutely phenomenal. He is a great player and a huge personality.  But...  He's put in 3 mediocre to poor seasons, all of which were peppered with occasional brilliance, because he is after all Dani Alves, but overall I stand by the mediocre to poor evaluation. That changed when his contract was up and he realized (over the summer) that no teams were willing to pay his huge salary. Suddenly he was motivated. Will he remain motivated if he signs another big contract? I don't know, but it's worth considering. When motivated he's the best RB in the world, one of the top  ever, behind Cafu, and an absolute dynamo as Sid Lowe writes. But he's shown tendencies to get caught up in other shit, on and off the pitch, and I'm not sold that we should sign him to a big contract if that means we don't sign a viable replacement as well. I would be happy giving him a modest, incentives-based deal (if he would go for that), while signing another player of similar quality who can be real competition for him."
Barca,38ok0p,YO_putThatBagBackON,2,Sat Jun 6 12:24:36 2015 UTC,Great article. Thanks for posting. Totally agree. I don't even want to think about a Barça without Dani. We have a really great squad right now and I'm hoping that the idiots on the board don't mess up and let him go.

Barca,38i93q,tonytetova,13,Thu Jun 4 11:49:30 2015 UTC,Yeah. I got totally surprised with this news. Now Dani Alves's turn.
Barca,38i93q,Duke--Nukem,36,Thu Jun 4 11:51:53 2015 UTC,I love this guy. His attitude is exemplary.
Barca,38i93q,Slapdash13,5,Thu Jun 4 12:16:07 2015 UTC,Yep. Its easier to be loyal when you're one of the best in the world and can play each week.  This dedication is awesome.
Barca,38i93q,wtf_is_karma,6,Thu Jun 4 16:16:10 2015 UTC,I think he meant that it's easy for regular starters to be loyal because they're playing all the time and Pedro's dedication despite not starting weekly is admirable.
Barca,38i93q,Icarium_lifestealer,23,Thu Jun 4 18:55:41 2015 UTC,"Great news for barca. Barca are lucky to have so many loyal players in the same generation. Seriously it tells us how important la masia was to the club's success in this decade. But the current board is destroying its reputation and going all galactico feels lately.   Anyway back on topic, i hope he gets more playing time next season. Either as a backup for MSN or starter alongside MSN (maybe as a RWB or RB). If we use a 3 man defense we can find a place for him."
Barca,38i93q,SpoonOnGuitar,77,Thu Jun 4 21:04:04 2015 UTC,"Unexpected, to say the least.   Great for the club and really shows this man's dedication to this club. He has really accepted his role. However, I still believe he deserves more playing time.   Perhaps time to try him as that right back?"
Barca,38i93q,invice,33,Thu Jun 4 12:46:57 2015 UTC,"To convert someone who has always played attacking football his whole life, who has striker's instincts, whose DNA dictates him to attack, is pretty difficult. The only thing working for Pedro as an RB is the fact that Barca plays a really high line, and its full backs are majorly playing the roles of wide wingers. All this Pedro can easily do, as he is a workhorse, runs around, will drop back even to defend.  The problem starts when you go into the defensive attributes. Will he know how to form offside traps at the right time to catch the opposition offside? Will he know when to go for the last man tackle, or the sliding tackle, or when to contain the attacker? Will he understand the concept of man marking to neutralize the opposition's attackers? An attacker has really less defensive duties, but when you are in the defense, you gotta be the best in the defense.  I would love it if Pedro became an RB for us, as I really really love the guy. But I don't have high hopes in this experiment."
Barca,38i93q,Icarium_lifestealer,2,Thu Jun 4 12:12:12 2015 UTC,"I am sure we can try it, pedro is really a hard worker and a decent player in defense. With jordi learning to become more and more aspects of the defensive play we can have pedro as an attacking RB (at least for now). Rakitic and pique will cover for pedro.  In the long run i don't see it working but if dani leaves i might be more comfortable with pedro at RB than montoya or douglas. A barca RB is not just an attacking rb, he needs to make lot of plays with messi and act as an extra midfielder sometime to allow messi some space to work his magic. That is why dani ends up having that much of the ball. Now do you see montoya or douglas doing that? linking up with messi? Pedro is more comfortable doing it. So i don't think it is that bad idea. We need to try, not much choice left at least until we sign a quality RB."
Barca,38i93q,invice,3,Thu Jun 4 12:28:52 2015 UTC,"But let us have a bit of patience, and give Montoya a little time. Maybe he might become good, and if he doesn't, replace him with Pedro, and go in big this winter to get a top RB"
Barca,38i93q,Icarium_lifestealer,2,Thu Jun 4 12:53:07 2015 UTC,"Even i am up for giving chances to montoya, but lucho doesn't see him as a barca starter ever. Don't know why."
Barca,38i93q,somethingcool-1,2,Thu Jun 4 12:57:23 2015 UTC,"He doesn't contribute much overall. I know he's a decent defender and all. Has a nice match up of age + talent and thus should look very promising, but it's not always the case. Especially with Montoya. Every time I've watched him he's just been decent. Not brilliant in any capacity. Look at Bellerin, I'm not too fond of him, but he has moments where he actually does brilliant things. Dani Alves has loads of this, Montoya is just a good squad player, never really thought he could be more than that."
Barca,38i93q,Icarium_lifestealer,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:05:20 2015 UTC,Yeah he never showed real talent to become a starter for barca. He was decent most of the time though.
Barca,38i93q,alrightythenkek,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:26:52 2015 UTC,What are top RBs right now?
Barca,38i93q,invice,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:57:34 2015 UTC,"None of the available ones are even near Dani Alves. The best options for us are Aleix Vidal, who is also a converted one from the right wing, Darmian who was really promising as he is young but his form in the last two years has been pathetic, Clyne iirc who is okay but not Barca level, Bellerin who is overhyped in my opinion, he I'd goods but not that good s Arsenal fans tell him to be, Danilo who could have been a good replacement to Alves who we lost to our dear rivals, Carvajal who Madrid won't let go even if hell froze over.   Not sure if I covered all but I think these are the ones that have been related to us in the past few months(except Carvajal). To be completely honest, right now Alves' form is so good that he is better than any of the listed ones. But due to our majestic fucked up board, he might not renew and that would not be good. Were are Barca, new players need time to adjust, to understand the team mates, to get the idea of the team movements. We cant expect a new transfer to start performing from the first day. Even players like Neymar and Suarez took time to adjust. So our best bet right now is to convince Dani to sign a contract, or else our right back position is going to be super weak...  That's the reason I want Montoya to succeed as he already knows the team and will need not much time to adjust if he plays good"
Barca,38i93q,somethingcool-1,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:23:16 2015 UTC,"Zabaleta/Lichtsteiner/Ivanovic/Marquinhos (younger alternative, since all I mentioned are older). A lot of ""top right backs"". Though arguably Marquinhos wouldn't really do much of what Alves does but he handled Neymar pretty well in that first PSG match. Zabaleta could with a little more discipline, but he's a little old to incorporate that into his game."

Barca,38i93q,IhateAngryBirds,7,Sat Jun 6 00:33:35 2015 UTC,Maybe Lucho's initial plan of 3-4-3 will come to play next season if Alves isn't renewed
Barca,38i93q,KrazerSK,5,Thu Jun 4 15:01:46 2015 UTC,The reason this team hit its peak in the final stretch of the season is due to rotations. I am sure Lucho will rotate as much/even more next season so Pedro should see his share of opportunities.
Barca,38i93q,IhateAngryBirds,7,Thu Jun 4 13:03:48 2015 UTC,"Perhaps time to try him as that right back?   Stop trying to make that happen, because it won't. Pedro doesn't have the defensive capabilities to play RB consistantly.  If theres any player who can play RB from the current squad, it's Bartra."
Barca,38i93q,pradeep23,2,Thu Jun 4 13:05:04 2015 UTC,"More playing time, definitely. However trying him as right back won't be such a great idea. He is perfect backup for Neymar/Suarez, specially considering injuries. Hope to see him play more."

Barca,38i93q,ANLProbe,-1,Thu Jun 4 15:16:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think he deserves more playtime. He already has MSN and Munir and Adama thirsty for minutes and first team material.

He was fundamental to us in the Guardiola era. Although he doesn't score goals for fun anymore, you'll rarely have a guy at your club willing to be your solid back up when he could easily get playing time elsewhere. I was so happy we he scored that bicycle kick earlier this year. This comment turned out to be way mushier than it was supposed to be, whoops."

Barca,38i93q,MobyGlitch,14,Thu Jun 4 12:14:44 2015 UTC,"Suarez won't play in the Copa America. His country ban isn't over yet.

Barca,38i93q,johan14cruyff,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:57:45 2015 UTC,"Sandro has the most talent at this point, and correct me if I'm wrong be he plays in the middle with Suarez, right?  Munir needs to add some weight to his body, he reminds of Neymar the first year getting pushed around a lot."
Barca,38i93q,cdrawesome,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:34:06 2015 UTC,"Raw talent wise, I think Adama is the best among the options, but he needs a lot of education in terms of tactical discipline.  Though Sandro plays centrally, it shouldn't matter too much in our first team, because the width is provided mostly by full backs and not the forward. Neymar rarely goes down the wing till the byline.  Either way this is only for few games in the beginning, so as to give some rest to Neymar and Messi after Copa America, but it's going to depend on the league schedule though."
Barca,38i93q,astral_cowboy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"I would argue, and you may agree, we will need to continue rotation next year as well considering the 60 games we played this year, the Copa America, and hopefully another 60 next year.  Certainly, and if Dani leaves, we will need to figure that whole mess out too...but that is for another day.  Berlin!"
Barca,38i93q,beastcat,4,Thu Jun 4 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"Theory: He might still want a transfer out, if the right opportunity comes. I guess the club renewed him: a.) Because they still see him as part of the project, and b.) As a prize for his loyalty -- in case he doesn't get transferred, he still has a place in the team. I guess the club will facilitate his exit if he wants, but he just won't go to any club.  So while this is potentially good news, I wouldn't be 100% confident that he'll be part of the team next season. Hopefully he does."
Barca,38i93q,astral_cowboy,4,Thu Jun 4 19:39:14 2015 UTC,"Expansion on your theory: A) if he still wants to transfer out, renewing a new contract could mean if clubs want his services, and seeing how there is no incentive to leave the club after a renewal. a team would need a decent sized bid to entice him to leave. good for both parties making sure he doesn't go to a team offering scraps like inter or milan.   B) a prize for his loyalty and possibly an evolution of pedro under lucho? could we see the old prolific and revitalized goal scoring pedro? :) :)  (:  (:  C) by renewing services of pedro LW, it enables us to spend more money on two transfers,two players for the RB position.  a Young prospect for example Bellerin, and a veteran ready player (ex. aleix vidal).  just saying hypothetical of course, more money for prioritized positions and possibly midfield too.

Barca,38i93q,IhateAngryBirds,5,Thu Jun 4 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Hasn't been in great form for a long time now and this season he has barely started since Suárez came back from his ban.

Barca,38i93q,jklz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:50:58 2015 UTC,I hope it doesn't mean we'll be selling one our B teamers
Barca,38i93q,godie,3,Thu Jun 4 12:44:23 2015 UTC,"I doubt they'd go as far as selling. They should be well aware of the qualities of at least Munir and Adama. What their general stance on Sandro is, I don't know but I doubt he'd be sold."
Barca,38i93q,TheLeoMessiah,5,Thu Jun 4 12:46:41 2015 UTC,"I love Pedro,  can't think of a better sub to have for MSN (someone willing to sit on the bench and that know the role). Lucho should give  him at least all Copa games,  like Pep did with Pinto"
Barca,38i93q,arijanbrkic,5,Thu Jun 4 12:52:47 2015 UTC,"The short memories of some people (especially on /r/soccer) is insane. This is the same Pedro who, along with Villa, replaced Eto'o and Henry, two legends, right after they left, and brought us to CL glory just like they did. He deserves this, and he's a fucking club legend"
Barca,38i93q,Hamarjadid,3,Thu Jun 4 13:39:19 2015 UTC,Not to mention he had a knack for getting goals against Real Madrid.
Barca,38i93q,laugher020,4,Thu Jun 4 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"Should definitely come PL. Gutted at this as a fellow Canary islander. He simply won't make it with the MSN in Barca, and he doesn't deserve to rot on the bench. He is a star"
Barca,38i93q,IhateAngryBirds,3,Thu Jun 4 23:01:46 2015 UTC,Fuck yes. I was so happy when i heard it! I hope he gets tot play more next season.
Barca,38i93q,egcg119,2,Thu Jun 4 12:22:30 2015 UTC,"That makes no sense, does this mean Adama, Munir and Sandro will go out on loan/be sold? Who knows anyway, any idea of his clause, if it has an amount played equalling lowering of his clause, our board seems to love them.  Also this means Lucho decided to stay, as they wouldn't have renewed him without consulting a new coach."
Barca,38i93q,jklz,10,Thu Jun 4 12:49:19 2015 UTC,"Some of them will go on loan for sure. But keeping Pedro always made sense - if we didn't, all of our attacking subs would be youngsters and raw. Pedro might not be great, but his experience makes him dependable, unlike Deulofeu or Adama.  The wild card is Deulofeu - I genuinely have no idea what will happen to him. I an see Sandro going on loan and Munir getting promoted, though."
Barca,38i93q,egcg119,2,Thu Jun 4 12:41:29 2015 UTC,"Latest rumours from England (Daily Star/Liverpool Echo, so could be bullshit) are that he wants to return on loan to Everton. Kinda contradicts the interview he gave a few months back where he stated he wouldn't go on loan again though."
Barca,38i93q,dirt-doggy-dog,2,Thu Jun 4 12:53:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I always view such stories as English papers hoping/selling what their fans want to hear rather than any sort of truth."
Barca,38i93q,jklz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:14:55 2015 UTC,"sevilla's unai emery said of deulofeu that he needs to learn to be less individualistic and play for the team, personaly i really like the kid and hope he learns to be more of a team player sooner rather than later. i think he has to talent to at the very least be a rotation player for barca be it next season or the one after (though admittedly a lot can happen in two seasons time, so who knows).  TD;LR i have no idea what will actually happen to deulo"
Barca,38i93q,04andrew22,2,Thu Jun 4 13:33:27 2015 UTC,"Also this means Lucho decided to stay, as they wouldn't have renewed him without consulting a new coach.   I do think Lucho will stay, but renewals and so on can easily be decided without the consultance of the coach.  I think Munir is the only one with a slight chance of joining the first team anyway from the attackers. Don't know what will happen to the other two, but I really doubt they'd be promoted."
Barca,38i93q,dirt-doggy-dog,2,Thu Jun 4 16:44:42 2015 UTC,"This is awesome news, and pretty surprising considering it doesn't seem like he has been very happy not getting a ton of minutes. Maybe this means a re-worked starting XI next season to include him more.   Either way -- thank you Pedro!!!"
Barca,38i93q,blashed,2,Thu Jun 4 12:48:07 2015 UTC,"perhaps not the most exceptional player on the planet but he's so reliable, dedicated, upbeat and hard working that you can't help but love the guy. really really happy to have him renew and can't wait for the next bicycle kick."

Barca,38i93q,snk12,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:35:33 2015 UTC,"I believe that too. I mean, he's been great for us, and I'm grateful to all he's done for us, but... He is no longer useful, I mean, all he does is running and running, just giving some assistance or scoring any goal every once in a while. Do you feel relieved when you see Pedro entering by any member of the MSN? Because I don't.   A madridista friend (yes) was telling me that when he was watching last year's Clásico that we lost (3-1) he saw Pedro entering and he was like ""yeah, now it's impossible for them to score"". I mean, he's a good guy and has done great things for us, and I like him as a person, but I don't think he's useful for Barca anymore. Not even as a RB."
Barca,38i93q,RenEffect,2,Thu Jun 4 13:04:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, and is not that I don't appreciate him because he has made a lot of important goals, but if he knows his role in this team which is giving rest to one the starters or filling the space for an injured player then we are Ok, I also think we should give more playing time to sandro."
Barca,38kwfd,egcg119,16,Thu Jun 4 21:44:55 2015 UTC,"Jordi Alba has been immense this season. In my mind, he has been without a shadow of a doubt the best leftback in the world."
Barca,38kwfd,-Token,3,Fri Jun 5 01:24:24 2015 UTC,2nd best behind Alaba this season i felt. Gaya got the nod in Liga team but most likely because they might not have wanted to overload the team with players from 1 team.
Barca,38kwfd,iVarun,7,Fri Jun 5 04:42:43 2015 UTC,"Typically I would have picked Alaba but considering the amount he's been injured this season and that when he does play it's not always at the LB position I felt Alba deserved it a lot more.    edit: changed ""little"" to ""a lot"""
Barca,38kwfd,-Token,3,Fri Jun 5 04:52:12 2015 UTC,I thought he was injured and paying in different positions?
Barca,38kwfd,_sic,2,Fri Jun 5 06:40:10 2015 UTC,"I don't watch Bayern as much as I would like to, so, can you tell me more about Alaba? What makes him the best?"
Barca,38kwfd,johan14cruyff,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:27:15 2015 UTC,"All round beast. Runs till the end, has great touch, can take FK's, can shoot from distance, good in the air, pacey, can play as a wide midfielder. True modern day FB. He hardly a weakness."
Barca,38kwfd,iVarun,3,Fri Jun 5 17:20:11 2015 UTC,"As someone who has begun following football from this season, I can't imagine a Jordi Alba that sucks."
Barca,38kwfd,InAnIndianAccent,6,Fri Jun 5 04:41:58 2015 UTC,"He's never sucked, he's just been really good this season."
Barca,38kwfd,mpinzon93,3,Fri Jun 5 05:14:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't had time to read the article yet, but I agree that Alba has had a spectacular season. He's always been a huge asset in attack, but I think this season he's been just as good in defense. I rate him as the best LB in Spain and among the best in Europe. I haven't watched Bayern play much this season, so I can't comment on Alaba, but I find it hard to believe that somebody has been much better and as consistent as Jordi this season."
Barca,38kwfd,_sic,2,Fri Jun 5 06:39:32 2015 UTC,"Taking into consideration the quality of the players, their involvement in the game and their replacements, I think Jordi Alba and Suarez share the position for the second most important player in the team.  In defense, the number of dangerous attacks Alba kills before they even form is pretty insane, and he does it so dominantly that they probably won't even count as interceptions, but as wrong passes. In attack, he has good connection with Neymar and provides great overlapping runs on the left wing. His first touch and control makes the Messi-Alba connection a dangerous weapon."
Barca,38kwfd,johan14cruyff,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:25:44 2015 UTC,"tremendously underrated. Currently, he's up there, if not the best."

Barca,38ih2b,XsTream23,11,Thu Jun 4 13:44:47 2015 UTC,Alexis comes to mind...I'm happy he's still playing well with the gunners but Pedro is a legitimate 'super sub' and I'm so happy he loves Barca so much that he's willing to play that role.

Barca,38ia4s,drotoriouz,8,Thu Jun 4 15:06:54 2015 UTC,Actually many Juve fans say Chiellini was not that great for some parts of the season and Barzagli is more consistent. Doesn't change much for us
Barca,38ia4s,Aj16ay,11,Thu Jun 4 13:43:18 2015 UTC,I know he's one of their best players but how big of an advantage is this for us ? who is his replacement ? I'll admit I don't know their squad very well.
Barca,38ia4s,Duke--Nukem,13,Thu Jun 4 12:05:43 2015 UTC,"Barzagli,Bonnuci and Ogbonna are replacements for him.Imagine that Pique is injured,we stay with Masche and Bartra/Mathieu/Verma(we have incredibly deep squad wow).Ogbonna is really bad,Bonci and Barza are pretty good but not on Chiellini's level"
Barca,38ia4s,Dellato88,25,Thu Jun 4 12:13:10 2015 UTC,"Chiellini being injured is not like losing Piqué. Bonucci is our best defender, Barzagli is arguably better than Chiellini as well, he certainly has been when healthy. It is unfortunate not to have a leader on the pitch but Bonucci-Barzagli can work very well for us."
Barca,38ia4s,gregTheDog,20,Thu Jun 4 14:22:34 2015 UTC,"Juventino here chiming in.   Barzagli is a world class player, I'd rate him higher than Chiellini tbh. What Barza lacks compared to Chiello is 1) Barzagli probably can't play a full 90 minutes at this level anymore and 2) Barzagli is not as imposing as Chiellini, who also helps Buffon marshal the defense. (What I mean by this is that Barzagli isn't as agressive as Chiellini, Barzagli's strength lies in his positioning and reading of the game)  As for Bonucci, well he's been our best CB all season.  Having Chiellini is more of a depth issue and also the fact that we won't be able to switch to a 3-5-2 mid game."
Barca,38ia4s,Dellato88,5,Thu Jun 4 14:36:56 2015 UTC,"I doubt you were ever going to go to a 3-5-2, Bayern did and were lucky not to be 2-0 down inside the first 20 mins at the Camp Nou."
Barca,38ia4s,zlos18,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:59:12 2015 UTC,I believe that in the event that we were to take the lead switching to a 3-5-2 mid game would've helped. Crowd the midfield and stop the supply for MSN. Then grind that win.
Barca,38ia4s,gregTheDog,3,Thu Jun 4 15:09:21 2015 UTC,Isn't your 3-5-2 like a 5-3-2? The few times I have watch Juve play Evra and Lichtsteiner play as wingbacks and stay down unless Juve have possession of the ball.
Barca,38ia4s,Dellato88,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:37:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would help, unless Evra and Lichtsteiner play deep, there would be too much space for the diagonal ball, which Neymar and Messi seem to have perfected this year. When Barca get overrun in the midfield Messi tends to play deeper. If Juve do overcrowd the Midfield then there defence will have to push up also, otherwise you are letting Suarez Messi and Neymar come short for the ball and allowing them to run at the Juve back 3. I just can't see Juve going Man to Man."
Barca,38ia4s,I_am_oneiros,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:20:23 2015 UTC,fair enough.  I haven't seen Barca play this season and obviously I can't compare them to the regular opposition we face where that tactic usually works.
Barca,38ia4s,A_F_R,2,Thu Jun 4 16:29:56 2015 UTC,"A 3-5-2 would basically involve you playing the Atlético (2013/14) game. Your free man would be at the back - Bonucci would play as a sweeper and start passing attacks from the back (his passing range is quite good, if I'm not mistaken). You'd probably play on the counter instead of trying to maintain possession. Tevez would drop back into the midfield to maintain numbers.  This would be quite unlike Bayern's suicidal one-on-one man-marking.  I could see you going 3-5-2 if (God forbid) Barça were a goal down. Not now though - I'm not sure Allegri will trust Ogbonna in such a high-profile game."
Barca,38ia4s,Dellato88,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:24:09 2015 UTC,"I watched some Juve games under Conte, Barzagli seem to be a major beneficiary of playing alongside Bonucci and Chiellini. He was allowed to be very aggressive going for tackles and interceptions knowing he's got cover.   How has he been doing this season now that Juve plays a back four again?"
Barca,38ia4s,Duke--Nukem,2,Thu Jun 4 19:25:41 2015 UTC,He's been injured most of the season. Since his comeback he has been solid as ever defensively though not fully fit for obvious reasons.  It took him a while to get accustomed to the back 4 but I think he got the hang of it by now.
Barca,38ia4s,invice,8,Thu Jun 4 19:37:41 2015 UTC,"If Chiellini is not able to go on Saturday, his replacement would be Leonardo Bonucci, another very capable defender. The problem: Bonucci tore his hamstring just two weeks ago, and while he has practiced normally this week, he's not close to 100% condition.   source: barcablaugranes.com  Edit: extra bit of info about Chiellini's importance to Juve:   @OptaPaolo just pointed out that Juve have won 71.1% of games with Chiellini this season (all comps). 45.5% without."
Barca,38ia4s,marsh_randy,8,Thu Jun 4 12:19:53 2015 UTC,"Barzagli and Bonucci are really good defenders, don't underrate them. For me, they could do the job for them. Obviously Chiellini is way better, but they are really good"
Barca,38ia4s,invice,6,Thu Jun 4 12:20:18 2015 UTC,I would even say that Barzagli is a better choice than Chiellini against Barcelona. But Barzagli will most likely not be ready to play 90 minutes after his injury.
Barca,38ia4s,Football_Enthusiast,2,Thu Jun 4 13:45:42 2015 UTC,"That's the only thing that Juve has not going in their favour right now. Barzagli is way better than Chiellini when it comes to defending against teams like Barca, but his injury makes it wrong."
Barca,38ia4s,Football_Enthusiast,5,Thu Jun 4 14:25:58 2015 UTC,"Leonardo Bonucci is most likely to replace Chiellini for the final, don't know much about Serie A teams but they say Bonucci is one of the key players for Juve's success in the current season. He probably isn't as same level as Chiellini but he is Italian (surprisingly Italians got a weird mojo going while playing against the Germans) and I think Italian defense can be tough to be broken but hopefully our offensive force will be enough to score at least couple of few goals against Juventus."
Barca,38ia4s,Duke--Nukem,8,Thu Jun 4 12:22:22 2015 UTC,"Bonucci is not the replacement, Barzagli is. Bonucci is always the first defender on the team sheet, he has been our best defender this year, and comfortably so."

Barca,38ia4s,papi617,2,Thu Jun 4 14:48:46 2015 UTC,The common opinion by people who watch juventus regularly is that Barzagli is a better option anyway and capable along with Bonucci. There are still questions however about Barzagli's fitness and they are freaking out about the possibility of Ogbonna getting game time.

Barca,38ia4s,gadesxion,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:52:30 2015 UTC,"There's no doubt that we had the most difficult run to the final. A PSG side with injuries is just as strong, if not stronger, than Atletico, Porto, and Monaco. Likewise, considering how deep their squad, the Bayern side we faced is just as strong as RM and Juventus. If anything, our good ""luck"" with injuries is offset by our bad luck with always drawing difficult opponents."
Barca,38ixpg,rgadd,12,Thu Jun 4 15:02:21 2015 UTC,"Aside from the legality of this, if you want to live stream anything from a t.v. you need a converter card with a coax or hdmi input to get the video onto your computer from your cable box or antenna. After that there are several options for you to stream your desktop, all will require a very decent upstream bandwidth. Acestream isn't too hard to setup and utilizes p2p if your internet speed isn't up to par, sopcast works also but is harder to set up. YouTube also has streaming options some people were using by making unsearchable channels for games last round of the CL. Not sure if you can still get away with that tho, they may have caught on..  I don't think streams for the final are necessary tho, it is usually is on a tv channel that you don't have to pay for unlike the other CL games, atleast in my country, and most people are not at work during the game since its on a weekend fyi."

Without Messi and Neymar starting in such an important match after Real lost their game.  Maybe we should have given him more time, but we had every right to be mad.

Now that Lucho has some trophies under his belt we can be in a worse situation next January and no one will call for his head. Hell, we can go trophyless next season and fans will still treat him a lot better than they did this January. I know I'll be much more patient with him next season than I was this season."

If the team was in the relegation zone for an extended period for example.  However given we were still in for three competitions, #Luchoout was the product of a bunch of spoiled little shits."

Barca,38i3fi,iagolima,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:25:57 2015 UTC,Lol no one would be dumb enough to get rid of a double or treble winning coach.   As for Lucho himself I believe he said that he'll talk about his future after the season's over but that he has nothing spectacular to say. He's staying.
Barca,38i3fi,darthvader7888,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:33:33 2015 UTC,"The problem is when you start mixing sports with politics and/or personalities. Do you think Perez fired Ancelotti, the guy who gave them La Décima, simply for sporting reasons? I agree with you that it is likely he won't leave, but with elections coming up, I'm not 100% sure he'll stay. Close to it, though."
Barca,38i3fi,iagolima,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:51:33 2015 UTC,Getting rid of Lucho would also be a bad move politically. Wanting to get rid of Lucho would be suicide for a candidate's election campaign.

Barca,38fd7s,azreik117,17,Thu Jun 4 06:23:54 2015 UTC,This goes back much longer than 4ish years so I'll do my best to ELI5 it to you.  Luis Figo played with Barcelona for 5 years (1995-2000) and then made a controversial move in 2000 to Real Madrid for more money where he played until 2005. He won the Ballon D'or trophy in 2001 as a Madrid player even though most of what he did the previous year was for Barca. He's seen as a traitor...
Barca,38fd7s,IVTD4KDS,8,Thu Jun 4 06:30:08 2015 UTC,"You forgot two important things. Firstly, he was barca's captain - an honour that is very rarely given to a foreigner at barcelona and secondly, he kept declaring his undying love for the club, even till the last couple of days before the transfer, only to stab cules in the back.   Transfers between these two clubs are practically forbidden as it is, but to have your best player sign for your hated rivals - biggest betrayal in football history.   There's so much more to this story though. Read it, learn about it (and figo's other shady transfer stories), watch the videos, the pigs head et all and embrace the hate for Figo. You must if you are a barca fan."

Barca,38jfcb,suck_on_my_weenis,2,Thu Jun 4 17:51:30 2015 UTC,"Alves and Alba would have shit positioning all the time. The reason why alves can vo forward is because blondie is always covering. No blondie means that alves leaves a huge space on the left. Alba is fast as  shit, but he'd also get caught out of position alot.   Imo, the better alternative lineup would be a 4-5-2, with messis as a cam behind suarez and ney. But even then, 4-3-3 would be better."
Barca,38jfcb,Morcule,6,Thu Jun 4 22:58:55 2015 UTC,"It's never happening because we already got a great tactic and there's literally no reason to change it.

There's no need for RM when we have Messi, and neither should Alba play that high up the pitch. We got Neymar."
Barca,38jfcb,RickAScorpii,2,Thu Jun 4 19:21:53 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but the midfield would be far too weak. Even at the start of this season we had problems because the two more attacking mids played wider, so Busquets had trouble being left alone there (and Mascherano didn't, so he looked better)."
Barca,38jfcb,lonestar_10,2,Thu Jun 4 20:04:40 2015 UTC,"This is obviously just hypothetical-- I'm thinking Lucho will probably stick to the tried and true 433 but maybe this is an interesting alternative to consider. A few notes:   Gives Pedro opportunity for more minutes. He could start at either of the wide midfield positions, or either of the wings if one of the forwards is out for any reason. Alba and Pedro (to me) would be a great fit for those wide midfield positions since they both have crazy workrates. They would have freedom to go forward and would have some defensive responsibilities but with 3 CBs + Busquets they would be covered well on the counter. Couldn't decide whether to start Iniesta or Rakitic. This could be a good change to allow iniesta to get into more of an attacking role again in which he can link up with the forwards like he used to a lot more.  Allows for a lot of rotation to keep players fresh. Dani can obviously slot into the RM spot. If Alba needs rest, Mathieu or Pedro can slot into the LM spot. Rakitic could slot into either center midfield spot IMO. etc. etc.    Let me know what you guys think!"
Barca,38jfcb,kostkeon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:08:07 2015 UTC,"So far the 4-3-3 is working pretty well, however having an alternative game plan is always a good idea."
Barca,38jfcb,cdrawesome,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:14:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But I just can't help but think that with Pedro extending his contract, there had to be some promise of giving him more minutes. He obviously won't start ahead of any of MSN when they're healthy, and I don't see him working as a pure RB but this seems like it could be a good alternative where he would have some defensive responsibility, but not too much.   Or maybe Pedro really is completely selfless and is content with the minutes he's been getting as a late sub...idk."
Barca,38jfcb,xscientist,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:19:01 2015 UTC,I do think Pedro will be used very often early in the season because Neymar and Messi will need recovery time from Copa America. Also think he'll be used for the UEFA super cup (if we win tomorrow) and the Spanish super cup.

Barca,38h9ls,ViscaBarca1899,4,Thu Jun 4 05:15:44 2015 UTC,:(  :)
Barca,38h9ls,Dark-X,9,Thu Jun 4 09:27:40 2015 UTC,Iniesta would be the one. He's starting to slow down a little bit. ): Possibly play half and half with who ever comes.
Barca,38h9ls,MSNFCBLove,4,Thu Jun 4 05:06:22 2015 UTC,I think Iniesta still has much to offer in the next two years (maybe more). Not to mention that rafinha could be lost to another team in a thiago alcantara situation.
Barca,38h9ls,Football_Enthusiast,5,Thu Jun 4 06:53:13 2015 UTC,"This season hasn't been that good for a midfield maestro like Iniesta but yeah, I agree that Iniesta has still many things to contribute at least for the next two seasons.  I say we better give our youngsters some opportunities to prove themselves on pitch, I think at least some of them will be just perfect for Barça if not all. And that's why we shouldn't rush about signing another midfielder right at this moment and better trust Rafinha taking over Xavi's position. If he fails to deliver what we expect from him then we can look for a new signing but until the January transfer window '16 I don't think it would be a good idea to seal the deal with a low cost but high risk player like Gundogan or a potential star performer but extremely high cost player like Pogba.  However Iniesta will not play forever so for the next three seasons he should be played carefully so that he doesn't fully tire out himself and Barça have enough time to prepare someone from La Masia to succeed Iniesta within this period."
Barca,38h9ls,Kluey,3,Thu Jun 4 08:58:17 2015 UTC,Iniesta will be moved to the role Xavi had this season probably. Rakitic runs out of gas after 60 and Xavi has usually come on to control things and put a lock on the game. Iniesta is more than capable of controlling the midfield like that. The insane dribbling and piercing runs from Iniesta are nearing the end.
Barca,38h9ls,JurijFedorov,2,Thu Jun 4 09:24:00 2015 UTC,What about Denis Suarez. He is only 21 but bossing it in the league.
Barca,38h9ls,johan14cruyff,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:59:26 2015 UTC,"If Pogba comes here, he will take Iniesta's role of this season (main starter) and Iniesta will take Xavi's role of this season (frequently used sub and rotation starter).  If Gundogan comes here, he will take Xavi's role of this season (frequent sub and starter in some matches), and if he proves worthy enough, then it can be same as the Pogba situation.  Above all this it would be best if we can get Verratti, but it doesn't seem like that move will happen.  Minutes this season (Liga + CL):  Iniesta : 2299 ( 28 starts, 6 subs )  Rakitic : 2833 ( 33 starts, 10 subs )  Xavi : 2102 ( 21 starts, 19 subs )  That's a pretty good distribution of minutes."

I don't know what others think but I've noticed that Italian football in general aren't that attractive to Asian football fans (I've found very few who regularly follow Serie A) and I've read somewhere that majority of the top EPL team's fan base are from Asia (there is a stat regarding most fans/supporters countries but at this moment I can't find the one that I've seen). And also Barça and RM are very famous is Asian countries, specially after '08 Euro and '10 WC, Spanish football followers are rapidly increasing (at least that's what I've seen in my country)."

Barca,38cbmb,latino666,7,Wed Jun 3 11:40:29 2015 UTC,Bayern apparently pulled out of the negotiations because Pep etc weren't 100% sure and his mediocre performance in the cup final was no good sign
Barca,38cbmb,JudLewD3,5,Wed Jun 3 13:06:03 2015 UTC,"He's performed okay since coming back from injury, but not up to his usual standard. It has to be remembered that when he came back he walked right into a Dortmund team which were in a big crisis, so it was never going to be easy for him to get going again."
Barca,38cbmb,Masterofknees,7,Wed Jun 3 14:03:54 2015 UTC,"2011-13 for two years he was very good and on track to reach world class status. Real Madrid was heavily rumored to have achieved a deal in summer of '13 to sign him in summer of '14 but they opted out of it later.  As soon as the '13-'14 season started, the back injury happened which was very weird and didn't allow him to play at all for 1year+. He returned this season mid October and he had a relatively full season. He didn't perform that well, though it's hard to say if that was on him or the team underperforming in general.  In my eyes it's a low risk high reward signing. Won't cost much, it might work wonders or be totally pointless like Hleb."
Barca,38cbmb,Eladir,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:16:38 2015 UTC,Agreed!
Barca,38cbmb,polechi33,2,Wed Jun 3 16:23:34 2015 UTC,"If he returns to his old form and doesn't pick up any further injury then he may be a good signing for Barça but he had been though a season long injury that cost him playing the WC so it will be tough but if he tries really hard I believe it may be possible for him to get his old charisma back. Although I'm still a bit worried about his injury, I'm really hopeful about Vermaelen's performance at Barça and I was happy when Barça signed him but his injury didn't let him play for us; I don't want something like that happens to any player ever."
Barca,38cbmb,Football_Enthusiast,2,Wed Jun 3 10:46:17 2015 UTC,"honestly i feel like arsenal and dortmund's medical staff are much worse then ours, just look at all those injury problems they've been having"
Barca,38cbmb,njastar,3,Wed Jun 3 12:41:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Arsenal but BVB players being too injury prone can be linked with their former coach Jurgen Klopp's playing strategy and tactics for the matches. What I've noticed in BVB's playing (under Klopp's management), they play really fast paced, high pressing, counter attacking football just too much and this certainly has taken its toll on their player's fitness. This type of football is very much energy consuming and may not be good for player's overall fitness in the long run even if the players are relatively young and healthy sometimes."
Barca,38cbmb,Football_Enthusiast,3,Wed Jun 3 13:27:03 2015 UTC,"This is just speculation, but I guess the rareness of injuries among our players can be attributed to a great portion to the style of play of Barca. By passing the ball before an opponent has the chance to tackle we avoid many fouls. Being technically supperior might also help our players. But our medical staff of course also deserves a great deal of praise. That's why I am not too worried about players with a reputation of being injury prone."
Barca,38cbmb,marsh_randy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:34:28 2015 UTC,"And he's not under Mino Raiola's management. Btw, there was a buzz that Raiola wanted to postulate for FIFA... can you imagine? That would be horrendous."
Barca,38cbmb,EpicChiguire,3,Wed Jun 3 17:01:57 2015 UTC,"They are two different players, Gundogan is more like Xavi while Pogba is more of the Iniesta Type.

Barca,38cbmb,polechi33,-8,Wed Jun 3 16:15:26 2015 UTC,He is pretty injury prone.  Edit - Down voted for stating a fact. Funny
Barca,38cbmb,vanNostrandby,11,Wed Jun 3 10:26:56 2015 UTC,I thought that was a myth. One lengthy back injury does not mean he's injury prone. Are there other injuries as well?
Barca,38cbmb,grubykoxu12,17,Wed Jun 3 10:38:31 2015 UTC,"It is a myth,Diaby is injury prone Gundogan suffered only one big injury"
Barca,38cbmb,Mr_Constantine,8,Wed Jun 3 10:54:47 2015 UTC,"How long was his injury? And he's 25 yrs old? still a quality player better than going for pogba who'll probably cost more than double of iikay's price.  Talking about youngsters, does this mean the likes of denis suarez arent in our plans for the future? (between ilkay iniesta and sometimes rafina, i doubt denis would be in our starting line-up)  Because i feel we should let our barca youngsters prove their worth, and denis has proven he can develop - with the right coaching - to fill the void of iniesta from his time in sevilla.   Am i the only one that feels this way? since when did we neglect giving some of our home-made playmakers a chance?     :( Lets not become a buying club, pls.  EDIT: Spelling"
Barca,38cbmb,vanNostrandby,3,Wed Jun 3 11:24:16 2015 UTC,"I was looking forward to seeing Denis at Barça. However, he doesn't seem to be ready to challenge Iniesta's spot just yet so they'd have to share those sub minutes with Rafinha which would hurt the development of both players. I think the best thing to do might actually be to buy him back in one year."
Barca,38cbmb,Mr_Constantine,3,Wed Jun 3 11:52:18 2015 UTC,"I think the best thing to do might actually be to buy him back in one year.   Thats summer 2016 right? i hope that works out. The way it looks, we are just looking to buy proven players (which isnt the bad thing) but it means our youngsters would not break into the first team, because there would always be a proven, older player out there that we can afford and we are not taking any chances by ""risking"" playing a youngster frequently.  I still believe in trying our youngsters out, the likes of iikay are great but we bought a player from croatia, uraguay, france, german. It wouldnt hurt to try out one of our own in a role that we've excelled in creating players for: creative midfielders. :)"
Barca,38cbmb,vanNostrandby,3,Wed Jun 3 12:14:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd like that more. But what if it becomes evident very early in the season that Denis can't cut it? Doubt Iniesta can play every important game next season. There's a chance, of course, of singing players in January but there are usually fewer available and they are usually cup tied. In this sense Gündogan would be a good choice in January also since he won't be cup tied. That is, if he stays with Dortmund. I guess the board is just playing it safe and making the deals they can."
Barca,38cbmb,FCB_TB,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:14:57 2015 UTC,Denis Suarez was bought. He is not our youth player. We just bought him while he was young. But not young enough to consider him a La Masia player
Barca,38cbmb,polechi33,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:28:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Denis is not a La Masia youth product but not because of his age. You have to spend 3 years in a team Youth academy to be consider a youth product fo that team."
Barca,38cbmb,polechi33,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:17:32 2015 UTC,Actually  Gundogan probably would cost 1/3 of what we would pay for Pogba.
Barca,38cbmb,darthvader7888,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:19:41 2015 UTC,"It's not that he's injury prone, it's the fact that he may have declined heavily because of that lengthy back injury."
Barca,38cbmb,vanNostrandby,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:02:09 2015 UTC,"And that's a legitimate concern, but not what /u/MSNFCBLove stated. At the moment Ilkay seems to be getting his form back and I'd expect him only to become better in the coming months."
Barca,38cbmb,grubykoxu12,11,Wed Jun 3 15:05:18 2015 UTC,You guys must remember that he was injured becouse he was the most important player in the team as 21/22 years old man.In Barca he propably won't play every game and top professionalists will take care of him.I just want to say that we don't need to worry.Bundesliga top player who must show that he can be as good as he was with strong Borussia is a thing that we want.
Barca,38cbmb,-Token,6,Wed Jun 3 11:09:16 2015 UTC,I'd hate to see him in a United Shirt. Come here Ilkay.
Barca,38cbmb,domi_28,4,Wed Jun 3 14:34:42 2015 UTC,"one of the main reasons why I want us to sing Ikay is because that means we wont sign Pogba. Ikay is great, he is a risk though after his injury, but I would hate for us to become the team to buy the most expensive players year in and year out. buying expensive superstars means players like Rafinha, Samper, D.Suarez will never get a fair chance and that's not what made us successful"
Barca,38cbmb,polechi33,5,Wed Jun 3 15:35:47 2015 UTC,"I agree, we need a player with the characteristics Gundogan has. Pogba in the other hand is a great player with a bright future, but I am not sure about getting him. If we get him we will have to sacrifice D Suarez and/or Rafinha."
Barca,38cbmb,buuya,4,Wed Jun 3 16:12:35 2015 UTC,"The only thing that worries me is his injury history. If they are behind him, he'll be a fantastic addition."
Barca,38cbmb,kezorN,8,Wed Jun 3 10:27:27 2015 UTC,What injury history?
Barca,38cbmb,AvocadoCake,4,Wed Jun 3 11:50:43 2015 UTC,"The one where he's been injured for 431/658 days since the start of his big injury, but that's not really the problem - the problem is that he hasn't exactly come back and lit the world on fire, he's been very inconsistent and far slower than he was before his injury. There was also a period of alleged laziness, but I don't really buy that. He's a risk, and relying on him for a season would be a potential disaster in the making.   That being said, I don't think we'd really be 'relying' on him should he be brought in considering youth integration of the coming generation is overdue as it is, and right now he'd be available for much cheaper and for much lower wages than the proposed alternative (Pogba, of course), and also willing to accept a role lower in the pecking order than Iniesta/Rakitic/any youth (including Rafinha/Roberto should either surprise) playing better than him at the time.  edit: regarding the pictures of Gundogan being fat that I linked, I just want to include a reminder that people were calling Suarez fat on his return"

Barca,38deqc,iagolima,8,Thu Jun 4 00:06:41 2015 UTC,"The best lineup is Busquets as CDM, Iniesta on the left and Rakitic on the right. However, Iniesta had a small disconfort after last match. Most reports say he's good to go, but we'll see. If he doesn't start, I think Xavi will in his place, probably moving Ivan to the left."
Barca,38deqc,latino666,11,Wed Jun 3 14:28:18 2015 UTC,"Moving Rakitic to the left leaving Xavi on the right would be a mistake imho. Leaving Pogba, Morata and Evra against Xavi/Messi/Dani would be naïve I feel."

Although there have been quite a few fantastic saves by the keepers (for all of them), so it would be nice to add ""off the post"" and ""on-target"" here as well, for a better image.  Still interesting."
Barca,38dduk,ManoloBar,5,Wed Jun 3 16:21:22 2015 UTC,I always though Ronaldo and Messi were bad free-kickers the last 2 years. I think Neymar is better even Xavi is better. But he is the king. He is not the best penalty kicker either. You could find the other stats too but they would improve all players stats somewhat.
Barca,38dduk,lelieth9,4,Wed Jun 3 16:27:01 2015 UTC,"Even though he is the king, freekicks should be taken by the best at it.   Freekick goals can really change an entire season. I have no problems Messi taking the penalties though, he is good at them, like 80% accurace."

Barca,38dduk,survivalothefittest,2,Wed Jun 3 17:08:13 2015 UTC,"Trying to find stats on Eto'o to verify that, but unable to do so :/"
Barca,38dduk,ManoloBar,2,Wed Jun 3 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"Anecdotal, but I always remember Eto'o being an average penalty taker. In the odd times when Ronaldinho wouldn't take them, I recall never being quite comfortable with Samu. It would be interesting to see the statistics."
Barca,38dduk,Aj16ay,0,Wed Jun 3 23:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, I also remember some of his misses. I guess Ronaldinho was better. I really think a 85% penalty stat for a team like Barca should be achievable. But it's not a huge deal as Real Madrid get twice the penalties we get."
Barca,38dduk,Aj16ay,3,Thu Jun 4 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"Messi's penalty conversion in the league this year is 5/6, Ronaldo (who I believe is perceived as one of the best penalty-takers around now) was 10/12.  Messi missed one in the CL (Hart with his amazing Golden Glove reflexes) and one in the CdR against Oblak (Messi actually sunk the goal as a rebound).  He also gave two penalty chances away, one in the league and one in CdR, so who knows what would have happened if took those.   Overall, I don't think it's too bad."
Barca,38dduk,egcg119,4,Wed Jun 3 16:42:17 2015 UTC,"To add to the discussion on who should take penalties, I would also mention that Messi, more than anyone else in Barcelona, can shoulder the weight of the pressure.  Not saying that he will never miss in a crucial stage (he has, and he will again, as all others), but that he can handle the fallout from missing. At this point, he is used to that absurd pressure."
Barca,38dduk,ManoloBar,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:52:49 2015 UTC,He is not bad at penalties. I just think even regular players like Balo are better at it. Messi is also okay at free-kicks but they are way to slow. If the goalkeeper is good he will usually reach it even if it is placed very well. While Ronaldo just can't seem to hit the goal. Ronaldinho and Deco were great!
Barca,38dduk,cea2015,3,Wed Jun 3 16:53:46 2015 UTC,I love Xavi but no way is he better than Messi at FKs. Although I agree Neymar and Suarez also should be given more opportunities
Barca,38dduk,ManoloBar,0,Wed Jun 3 17:08:47 2015 UTC,Xavi? He has scored 4 times. But on how many tries?  At least FIFA14 rates him: http://www.givemesport.com/378612-fifa-14-freekick-statistics-revealed
Barca,38dduk,TweetPoster,3,Wed Jun 3 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"Suárez was lethal with long distance FKs with Liverpool, we should let him have it if it's ~30m away"
Barca,38ddgz,ksalama,3,Wed Jun 3 14:14:16 2015 UTC,"They'll announce it next week, they didn't want to mix political stuff with the CL hype"
Barca,38ddgz,IhateAngryBirds,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:22:39 2015 UTC,"to add to this without makign a new thread, https://twitter.com/enricmasip5  retweeting like crazy today, basically all but confirming he's running  with Laporta."
Barca,38asdy,greenythebeast,22,Wed Jun 3 00:25:47 2015 UTC,IMO we should.
Barca,38asdy,Kluey,18,Wed Jun 3 00:28:55 2015 UTC,"I also thought it was a two year loan. Looking at the Rakitic transfer, it looks like Sevilla 'paid' 6M for Suarez and probably gave us a first year buyback of 6M, and a second year buyback of 9M.   For me, we made out like bandits with the way Ivan has played for us. Let him play another year at Sevilla, and if he shows progress, 9M is not a large figure, especially when we have most of the holes filled in the first team, and other than an attacking mid to start filling Iniestas shoes, we don't have a lot of buying to do in Summer 16."
Barca,38asdy,BarcaJeremy4Gov,3,Wed Jun 3 02:00:32 2015 UTC,"We wouldn't have a first year buy back of €6m. That would be this year, and we have to pay 9"
Barca,38asdy,Aj16ay,2,Wed Jun 3 02:29:53 2015 UTC,Right back if Alves leaves also comes to my mind.
Barca,38asdy,wish5138008,20,Wed Jun 3 03:22:04 2015 UTC,What a horrible deal. We should've never had placed that kind of buy back clause. Whatever though if we win the champions league I guess 9 mil is pocket change.
Barca,38asdy,tonytetova,4,Wed Jun 3 01:02:46 2015 UTC,How much do we get or earn approximately with a champions league win?

Barca,38asdy,dranani,9,Wed Jun 3 01:43:13 2015 UTC,So Juventus will have earned more money than us even if we win?
Barca,38asdy,A_Kind_Shark,12,Wed Jun 3 02:40:42 2015 UTC,"yes, because the spanish teams did better than the Italian teams so we have to split the market pool money and they dont."
Barca,38asdy,Neezzyy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:52:44 2015 UTC,14.5 mi for the champion and 10.5 mi for the team that loses.
Barca,38asdy,polechi33,8,Wed Jun 3 15:49:36 2015 UTC,I thought it was a two year loan? Or can they trigger the option halfway
Barca,38asdy,aleks19998,2,Wed Jun 3 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"They can but it would be stupid to do it. They know Barca would use the buy-back option. So they why would they use it know and lose Denis? Instead they can keep him an extra year and use it next summer, that way they get to have Denis one more season and still get their 3 mi."
Barca,38asdy,polechi33,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:48:59 2015 UTC,"This extra 3M actually Denis's yearly payment, not as part of actual transfer fee(6m Transfer fee + 3M wage)."
Barca,38asdy,ir7425,6,Thu Jun 4 07:52:46 2015 UTC,"Monchi at it again. Either gets a fantastic player for €6m, or gets paid €3m to loan him for 2 years"
Barca,38asdy,Aj16ay,4,Wed Jun 3 02:31:34 2015 UTC,Rakitic wasn't a part of this deal?
Barca,38asdy,mrnoor,3,Wed Jun 3 08:42:03 2015 UTC,"Kind of, this was done to reduce Rakitic transfer from 20 mi to 17mi. So now they would technically would be getting thier 20 mi."
Barca,38asdy,polechi33,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:46:02 2015 UTC,What?
Barca,38asdy,Aj16ay,2,Wed Jun 3 12:09:59 2015 UTC,In guessing the whole reason managed to get this deal with Suarez was because we asked for a lower price for Rakitic. Maybe not though
Barca,38asdy,mrnoor,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:44:16 2015 UTC,Yeah he was part of the deal. What's your point though?
Barca,38asdy,Aj16ay,2,Wed Jun 3 13:24:44 2015 UTC,Just that the whole reason for him getting a good deal was cause we got a good deal for Rakitic.
Barca,38asdy,mrnoor,2,Wed Jun 3 13:26:17 2015 UTC,It was like €18m. Fair price considering he was on his last contract year
Barca,38asdy,Aj16ay,5,Wed Jun 3 13:42:54 2015 UTC,We should pay the fee
Barca,38asdy,VOROBI,3,Wed Jun 3 01:11:47 2015 UTC,"Presidents say a lot of shit. None of this has come through official channels. Remember, Denis also has to agree to a deal."
Barca,38asdy,egcg119,5,Wed Jun 3 13:33:42 2015 UTC,Idk how easily we get pawned by other clubs wrt transfers. Extremely gullible in the market. :/
Barca,38asdy,ssathyajith,6,Wed Jun 3 04:07:31 2015 UTC,"What are we going to do? A 20 year old 5 places down on the depth chart has no value to us. On the other end, we are looking for world class talent for our first team, and if we don't get them a PSG, Chelsea or RM will, so we pay what we have to pay. Mid-table teams have much more freedom in bargaining in the window than top clubs."
Barca,38asdy,BarcaJeremy4Gov,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:52:35 2015 UTC,"You can't really say ,if got the opportunities like pogba and verrati,he might have done wonders  I think board is guilty because they really don't trust LA masia grads. And they try to buy marketable players and we are lucky that those players are really good and settle in our system and don't have egos like Madrid ones and play for team rather than themselves"
Barca,38asdy,justafanpassingby,2,Wed Jun 3 05:29:38 2015 UTC,"I think its the board who buys players that don't have egos ... why we always have to blame them for everything I mean yea hey have done things wrong but also things right, that's why we have the team that we have right now."
Barca,38asdy,TimeFingers,3,Wed Jun 3 06:36:05 2015 UTC,"Or he could have been another Bojan, or JDS. Statistically it's more likely he will turn into a Bojan over a Pogba.   La Masia isn't good enough anymore. Champions Leagues and Copa del Rays and League Titles; trebles and sextuples demanded by the fans means we can't develop talent on the senior squad getting first team minutes. We can't bring in a 17 year old Messi anymore and give him time to develop, we need a 22 year old Neymar, a 24 year old Suarez, who is already proven in top flight football.   I don't think it has anything to do with trust, it has to do with getting the best available. Pedro is a top 20 talent in the world, he starts on nearly any club in the world, but for us, he is a sub, and an injury rotation. To win the treble, to make it look like a video game on the pitch, we need top 5 talent, not top 20, and it's unrealistic to think that La Masia will always be able to produce top 5 talent, no matter how long they develop with the first team."

Barca,38asdy,suck_on_my_weenis,2,Wed Jun 3 00:27:03 2015 UTC,"Is this that bad? I mean, if a club owns a player they are more inclined to play him. More playing time means more progress being made by the players. If Suarez demonstrates his value and that he can compete in a club like barca, then 9 million is not a lot to pay. Or is that the wrong way to think about it?  Im genuinely curious."
Barca,38asdy,polechi33,2,Wed Jun 3 07:14:22 2015 UTC,"Not, you are right. And technically we would be only paying 3 mi, because Sevilla is paying us 6 mi for him. So we would be giving them their 6mi back and extra 3 mi."
Barca,38asdy,IhateAngryBirds,4,Wed Jun 3 15:43:04 2015 UTC,The fact that I got downvoted on another thread for saying our loan deals were retarded.....

Barca,38asdy,polechi33,0,Wed Jun 3 08:13:17 2015 UTC,"It is not that much cash, it is just 3 mi."
Barca,38asdy,philologum,2,Wed Jun 3 15:39:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but this is not a very good deal for Barça anyways. By the way, how do our other loans look like?"
Barca,38asdy,polechi33,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:36:08 2015 UTC,"I never said it was a good deal. When was the last time this board did a goal deal? I'll take 3 mi.   About our other loans:  Song did very well at West Ham. It seems that a few BPL teams want him, hopefully we can get back most of the money we paid for him.  Afellay did well in Greece, but because this is his last year of contract we won't be able to cash on him.  Tello did fairly decent at Porto. I think they had paid us 2mi for the loan and they have a buying option when the loan is over on the summer of 2016. They buying option they have is for 10 mi, they already gave us 2 mi, so they would need to pay 8 mi more.  (If you ask me, while Tello is not great but we could probably get more than 10 mi for him)  Deulofeu didn't have a very good year, as you probably know. I feel that he either would be given a chance with the first team or be sold, no more loans for him."

Barca,38cigh,xscientist,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"The biggest question, I feel at least, is what to do with Bale.  Ancelotti was shoe-horned into playing him this year even with a lot of midfield injuries.  That seemed to be the source of RM's biggest problems when James was hurt and after Modric went out for the season.  Juve has a very good squad, but RM wasn't doing a lot offensively in that tie or in the Atletic tie the round before.  My opinion..."
Barca,38cigh,cdrawesome,2,Wed Jun 3 17:38:53 2015 UTC,"It never seems like that front three clicked together. Sure, they will score because of who they are, but I felt they should have been far deadlier. Bale is so much better when he comes in a cracks one, but he pretty much looked for the line most times. Can't say Ronaldo is bad, but seems like he doesn't really bring out the best in the players around him and they are all walking on egg shells to not ruffle him.   Edit: defensively, I can see them needing a true defensive mid with Modric and James / whomever if front of him."
Barca,38cigh,DrJingles,2,Wed Jun 3 18:34:20 2015 UTC,"That's a good point.  People used to say the same about Messi and the 'E eto/Villa/Henry/Ibra stuff.  But with Ronaldo I can honestly just ""feel"" like he pisses his teammates off with his antics.  I think it's interesting from a ""what's going on"" point of view: tactics, personalities, ebb and flow of sports, life itself, etc.  Other than that I don't give much thought to RM as I'm sure you are as well..."

Nevertheless, I believe José Gayà (20 y.o.) and Juan Bernat (22 y.o.) would have done a good job as well.   Both Grimaldo and Gayà is born in 1995. Gayà has been a regular for Valencia this season and has done a great job, while Grimaldo is still in Barca B and will not become a starter for any of the top 5 teams in La Liga (Barca or loan) in the near future. This worries me a little as I've always regarded Grimaldo as a certain for our LB in the future. I know he can potentially become a star player for Barca, however with Gayá getting that much experience now I don't exclude Barca potentially going after him to succeed Alba in the future.   It would be awesome to have Grimaldo and Gayá in our team though (I think)."
Barca,3877se,Inspector-Norse,14,Tue Jun 2 11:45:16 2015 UTC,"Grimaldo is really good. We should trust him. We do not need flashy and expensive players to play for us. A little trust in the player can do wonders. And, if he is a flop, we always can buy good full backs. My main argument is that trusting La Masia graduates who are promising is the least we can do for an academy who gave us the world's best team to play (arguably).."
Barca,3877se,invice,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:30:08 2015 UTC,Yes of course. I just thought Gayá was way older than Grimaldo. It only worries me that Grimaldo is not playing first team football as he is one of my favourite players from La Masia. This will definitely change next season though.
Barca,3877se,Inspector-Norse,6,Tue Jun 2 16:51:26 2015 UTC,Awesome ! The best left back in the world.
Barca,3877se,HippoNigga,5,Tue Jun 2 13:39:23 2015 UTC,Great news.  The Energizer Alba is incredible and somehow underrated.
Barca,3877se,Turn_off_the_Volcano,4,Tue Jun 2 14:09:35 2015 UTC,Great news! He is one of the most consistent players on the team.
Barca,3877se,lonestar_10,3,Tue Jun 2 14:41:31 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I loved the day I found out we signed him, before that, counter attacks were our worst nightmare, we had no pace at the back, then he came and fixed it all up <3"
Barca,3877se,MSNFCBLove,5,Tue Jun 2 14:35:01 2015 UTC,That's terrific! Now give Alves what he wanted you twats.
Barca,3877se,philologum,5,Tue Jun 2 11:19:56 2015 UTC,"Wrong fullback to renew Barca, its alves' who's contracts ending soon!  But for real, I'm happy he's renewing. Easily one of the best left backs in the world, and his pace is an absolute lifesaver at times."
Barca,3877se,CrippledCrip,6,Tue Jun 2 10:20:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Alba is awesome, remember that assist to Neymar he had this season vs Atletico? Where he defended a attack with allegedly a handball and ran across the entire field just to get an amazing assist?  Edit: Here it is"
Barca,3877se,Chillidawg,3,Tue Jun 2 10:52:37 2015 UTC,He had an amazing 40-some-yard assist to Pedro last year that I'm having trouble finding video of. I think it was against Levante but I'm not sure.

Barca,389xvj,NeuralLink,13,Tue Jun 2 21:06:57 2015 UTC,"I love Neymar for his tricks and flicks, I hope he never stops doing them. As mentioned in the article, it's a psychological battle, and it's a fair one until a defender get offended and fouls Neymar hard. I love Neymars reaction to him being kicked and slapped aswell; just walking away not looking at the defender, not caring. This will enrage the defender even more (again fairly winning the psychological battle)."
Barca,389xvj,Chillidawg,4,Wed Jun 3 05:40:22 2015 UTC,"Yea the overreaction is just ridiculous. Any move is game as long as it's legal. Fuck you if you can't defend him.  I used to play at the turf fields by my college all the time, and the best way to earn the respect of someone was to embarrass them. I still remember the time my friend beat me using this move  This embarrassing reaction from the defenders to a bit of flair is foreign to me, and it saddens me."
Barca,389xvj,ncocca,4,Wed Jun 3 00:27:07 2015 UTC,"From what I saw on /r/soccer most people didn't have a problem with Neymar's skill.  That being said there were some who were seriously enraged about the incident.  Some were nearly tantrum level to the tune of ""it's insulting to be that flashy!"" ""He'd get stomped if he tried that in my Sunday league!"" ""Stupid Americans don't understand European football culture!!"" (Though the last one isn't wrong, it's just not the issue)  I think the way the Athletic players responded had something to do with the outrage.  They made it seem like Neymar just violated all of their collective mothers with that rainbow flick.  So surely with that kind of response from the defenders it was deplorable to demonstrate that kind of skill.  Yeah the fuck right.  Football is a game that doesn't change much through the years but this is one aspect that should evolve a bit.  The lack of protection Neymar saw after the incident was inexcusable, at least Busi was getting in the ref's ass about it, and rightfully so.    Long story short, defend better and you won't have to complain about getting beaten by an over the top dribble.  Until then, maybe try to join us in the 21st century.  It is incredibly frustrating to get bear like that but If it's legal and you get embarrassed, channel that rage into playmaking.  It's what you get paid to do."
Barca,389xvj,elbossohogo,4,Wed Jun 3 04:31:08 2015 UTC,"What I do know is this: Violence shortens careers. Imagine how close Messi came to something very serious when Ujfalusi decided his ankle was fair game. And don’t come at me with “The two situations are different.” No, they aren’t. Both instances are, at their base, a defender reacting to superior skill with violence. “Try and get past me, will you?”  This. Neymar isn't protected enough."
Barca,389xvj,imperuvio,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:23:30 2015 UTC,"His earlier antics have led to referees being a little more reserved while handing him fouls when he is hacked down.

His diving has almost vanished, and I really hope that something happens and players are protected from WWE players on the field."
Barca,389xvj,invice,3,Wed Jun 3 15:51:47 2015 UTC,Fuck respect. This has nothing to do with respect. The cunts were offended like pubescent bitches because they were butthurt. If they really wanted to hurt us maybe they should have defended better and moved on quickly because time was not on their side.

Barca,389xvj,YO_putThatBagBackON,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:08:06 2015 UTC,"It certainly shed some light on why the skill aspect seems to be lacking in English football. If showing skills earns you getting assaulted ""and rightly so"" and the focus is on tackles and other physical aspects I can see why the national team isn't succeeding. I remember someone English actually complaining about this on r/soccer. How skillful players are overlooked in the the English youth system and those with power/strength/size (whoever matures the fastest) will be favoured."

I would watch world cup and euro finals, but never anything else.  I distinctly remember rooting for Man U because they were the English team (same as me) but when Messi scored the 2nd goal I watched him religiously from then on. I remember saying ""how has he done that?""  I knew that Messi was the best player in the world before I watched the CL final, but seeing his performance and the praise he received afterwards led me to following Barca as a whole, and goals like the on Saturday remind me why I love this team, and Messi especially."
Barca,389yrz,matteog2,3,Tue Jun 2 21:34:22 2015 UTC,"First time I saw Barça in a Champions League final was in 2006. I remember being a nervous wreck before the match and during it. When we went down by one it felt like I got punched in the gut, lol.   I've always had a strong dislike for Arsenal, so not only would losing that match have been awful, but the fact that it was Arsenal would have made it 10x worse.  But after Belletti scored near the end of the match I went ecstatic, honestly it was amazing. Overall seeing Ronaldinho play during that entire Champions League campaign was incredible, and when I think back that's what I remember the most about that year, seeing Dinho play."

I've always played soccer and was obsessed over the 2010 WC. I did my research and decided that I liked Barca because of the players and the Mes Que Un Club philosophy but didn't follow up. My first game I watched was the 2011 Final. Since then I've been hooked and have never missed a game.   Perfectly a year later I randomly won a game used ball from my first ever Barca game, the 2011 Final in a sweepstakes. It is my pride and joy.  Barca hasn't been in a final since and I've stuck true and obsessed through all the ups and downs.   This year I will see my first game in person, the UEFA Champions league final. I'm going to be there! My number one bucket list item will be crossed off this week.  I hold Barca CL finals very close to my heart, they have a special meaning to me."

Barca,389yrz,decho,2,Wed Jun 3 17:57:25 2015 UTC,"The whole 2006 elimination rounds were so great. We were regularly watching all Barca games at a bar with friends. I was like 17-18 years old at the time. Good times.  The final itself was a mix of emotions. Most of my buddies weren't that much in to football but I can tell that everyone was truly enjoying it and rooting heavily for Barca under my influence hehe.   So on the day of the final I decided to gather everyone at one friend's place which was vacant at the time and the perfect place to watch the game basically. There was one huge problem however, there was no TV and we couldn't find anything decent. I ended up carrying one of those 20 kilogram old TVs to the other part of the town (where the place was). Shit that thing was so heavy I can still remember my hands were shaking throughout the whole first half.  The game itself i don't remember in much detail except of the key moments of course. 60 minutes in to the second half I became so tense that I was summoning all possible gods to come in Barca's favor. And then we all know what happened. Those two goals, I don't even need a video of them, I can play them in my head right now as I type this. Belletti falling on the ground in disbelief of what just happend, then all players coming over. And the rainy night couldn't make it feel less romantic as we talk about it now.  It was a wonderful experience overall. Unfortunately, we were still stupid teenagers at the time and the host decided to kick us out 30 minutes after the game for some reason I can't remember and I was extremely pissed off because the plan was to stay there all night and get more drunk. However, he's one of my best mates to this day and it didn't manage to overshadow the joy of winning the Champions league :)"

The 2009 final was held on a Wednesday and I remember being swamped with finals, AP exams and presentations since I was graduating high school that year. I DVR'ed it and got home and watched it but I fell asleep in the first 20 minutes and woke up as Messi scored the second goal.   2011 final was amazing, I woke up and watched it, cheered like crazy. I think my ex-gf's roommates hated me, I watched it at her house. Villa's goal made me ecstatic. I wasn't even nervous, I was so confident of that Barca team.

There are way too many to consider, so just picking goals out from a shortlist of 40 goals, I decided to make it a list of 25.

Barca,386bd9,ajaxmessi,5,Tue Jun 2 07:01:54 2015 UTC,"just made an account for this and guess this is the best place to ask for it (it's kind of my internet white whale as asked on the frontpage today):  2004(05) during Ronaldinho's peak at Barca there was a friendly against Ajax where Ronaldinho didn't play but instead a young, to me unknown, Messi wore the famous number 10 and scored a great (I think kind of lobbed) goal from abour maybe 20-25 m.  For the last few years I've been searching for a video of that goal but never found one so that I started to doubt my memory.  Did it happen and is there a video?"
Barca,386bd9,_FRANKENSTEIN_,6,Tue Jun 2 19:56:00 2015 UTC,"You asked me this at a good time.  I think you might have Messi confused with Eto'o.

Link - if you want to see the full PDF of the page, link. It's in Spanish.   Messi wore the famous number 10 and scored a great (I think kind of lobbed) goal from abour maybe 20-25 m.   This is what the report from Cadena SER (link) on 14 December 2004 said:   [...] Etoo [...] lanzó una vaselina desde 30 metros marcando su segundo gol por la escuadra.   Translation: Eto'o scored a 30-metre chip for his second goal in the top corner.    Ronaldinho did not play that match, and there was a goal that you describe...but it wasn't from Messi. Eto'o instead.  I hope this helps you. And thanks everyone for the kind comments."

Goosebumps!!!!!"
Barca,386bd9,Damiend,5,Tue Jun 2 05:02:46 2015 UTC,"I was at the game against Córdoba this past December, #10. Messi was in a sour mood. Earlier in the game, Rakitic (I think) passed a ball that Messi couldn't get to and it went out, and Messi was pissed, right in front of us. For that goal it was on the far side from us, and we couldn't believe the bring down, much less the nonchalant kick into the goal. That was our first day of a 12-day trip across Spain and I still say I could have returned to Texas the next day and called the trip a success."
Barca,386bd9,curious_cannon,17,Tue Jun 2 11:44:44 2015 UTC,"That goal against Madrid was absolutely incredible.  What blows my mind,  however,  is not what Messi did,  insane as it may be,  but the coolness of Busi. It's incredible how he just gets the ball,  does absolutely nothing as if he suddenly acquired control over the spacetime continuum and with it came a confidence that's he's untouchable. He sits there waiting for Messi to come collect the ball and do what he does best."
Barca,386bd9,Duke--Nukem,15,Tue Jun 2 04:23:22 2015 UTC,"What I still can't fathom about this goal is how did Busi even know Messi was supposed to do that? Do they plan these things in training (I can't ever imagine a training session going ""Just hold on to the ball until Messi comes and gets it from you""). After looking at the goal a hundred times I see that Busquets changes the position of the ball and his body shape just that little bit so that Messi has the perfect space to burst through."
Barca,386bd9,sault9,9,Tue Jun 2 08:49:21 2015 UTC,"Madrid players didn't think that he'd DARE to try that. When Messi got the ball, it was 1 vs 7 with enough space to do just that. He raped them. I couldn't believe it when it happened."

Barca,386bd9,tuput,2,Tue Jun 2 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"Actually, the title was not yet secured. Messi was not fit for the match, he was a substitute. You were losing 0-1 at halftime, and Messi was brought in the match at 58 minutes because Barça were very stagnant. 9 minutes later, a half-fit Messi scored this wonder-goal which for me was absolutely remarkable. Although it was not a major occasion like #2 (CL semifinale) or #4 (CdR finale), the context behind this goal makes it my personal favourite.  I remember watching this match live and I was amazed seeing this goal. Ray Hudson's commentary makes it even more special."

Nobody could do what he did last weekend, or against Madrid, the speed and deftness of touch in the run."

It will probably depend on Lucho and the players if he finally accepts the fact that he has to work hard, both in offensive and defensive"
Barca,387lc7,choss,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:31:47 2015 UTC,I always read about his attitude but I'm still confused. What's the problem with him? Is he cocky?
Barca,387lc7,Flam1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:52:47 2015 UTC,He's selfish and doesn't help a lot with defending. He's also a bit cocky because he was such an amazing talent at Barça B that he destroyed Segunda division defenses on his own.
Barca,387lc7,MSNFCBLove,9,Wed Jun 3 09:32:41 2015 UTC,"From Everton to Sevilla he has changed a lot, he is acting a lot more selfless now, with his deadly crossing accuracy, his pace and dribbling, and a good mind for how defenders work, how they challenge him, etc, i genuinely believe if he works hard and has the ability to change his playstyle depending on how Lucho wants to play him in different games, whether that means playing as an inside forward, deep lying winger, playmaking winger, he needs to be able to adapt.  He's still only 21, I can definitely see him being a starter for Barca one day, but he has to work harder to get it."
Barca,387lc7,Mr_Constantine,5,Tue Jun 2 14:11:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i still believe he can become a regular one day. But i wonder which position he'll play seeing as our attack has bench players like munir and pedro."
Barca,387lc7,MSNFCBLove,9,Tue Jun 2 14:21:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think Pedro will be staying, everytime I say that I get downvoted, but whatever, he deserves better playtime, and he just isnt his old self.   Munir is still 19, I think since Barca B got relegated, he will be loaned out for the season, to mature and develop, just like they did for Deulofeu."
Barca,387lc7,XsTream23,3,Tue Jun 2 14:33:03 2015 UTC,"i m trying to be calm here since he s my favorite player and i might be biased  but i m getting tired of people expecting him to be like he was in past.   with little playtime and  without* consistent minutes as a starter he aint going to be there so people should adapt their expectations according to his role at the team . last year he was heading to the right track since he was a regular starter for a good part of the season messi being injured and all was pretty good  till martino lost the team in the locker room (even with that  , managed to get his best goal scoring  season in La Liga )   as a sub, when the game is over and barca is in their cruise control mode, relaxed and conservative he is not going to improve either,  but considering his little minutes that he had this season still managed to slowly reach 4th top scorer of the team  , people might say some of the goals and statistics might be inflated from the copa games against Huesca  but only in la liga he has a decent number goals and assists , higher than all of his teammates  that benefited from a starting role ,pique being the closest"
Barca,387lc7,MSNFCBLove,2,Tue Jun 2 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"I dont think our expectations should change, when he does gets minutes now, he doesn't really do well with what he does. You could tell the game he scored the overhead kick, he rushed past Messi and Dani Alves (?) I beleive to celebrate on his own when they were arms running over to him. He's frustrated. Not many players can play well in his conditions.   He is a good player, but I don't know anymore, there isnt room for him to start, and if he isnt content with staying on the bench theres no use being selfish and forcing him to stay keeping him on a hope that maybe he will start again one day, it just wont happen.  EDIT: Most players who are trying to get into the first team or just better playing time dont try to go that extra mile and train extra hard, or work out why they arent playing like they used to / should be, Pedro is doing that right now... he has to work on his ability, i have no doubt that he can get back to his best, he needs to just forget the pressure, and train, work harder, listen to Lucho and most importantly, continue playing the way he knows how to, he has shown us hundreds of times how good he can play, and how well he fits into Barca, so it's his turn to get back into form, and become a regular sub with better minutes."
Barca,387lc7,XsTream23,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:06:07 2015 UTC,"that's your opinion .  i do agree abit on the frustration part (must be hard for him to be given onl 10-15 minutes per game in an average exception when MSN gets injured )  but he still celebrated with the team at the corner flag, probably wanted to show off feeling proud of what great goal he has scored.  funny how you say that he isnt doing that much as a sub,  most of his goals came as a power sub , goal vs Real Sociedad, Bilbao and a few more  (have to do some research  to tell you the whole numbers) came as a sub position.  by the way, guess who assisted Messi on the goal vs Atletico . exactly him.    people whole season long bashed the hell out of him for the poor start of season but when it was about praising he didnt get the credit that he deserved, in the end though, the numbers speak for themselves,  4th goal scorer of the team , 3rd goal scorer in CDR competition (2nd in the team equal with Leo ) , working hard, was the contributor to suarez first la liga goal  and so many more acomplishments ."
Barca,387lc7,MSNFCBLove,3,Tue Jun 2 15:22:35 2015 UTC,"Dont get me wrong im not bashing him, im just stating that he isnt at his best form, and he might be frustrated with his minutes/form and wanting to leave. Obviously if he wants to stay we dont sell him, but if he wants to leave, i feel like that might be the best thing for him."
Barca,387lc7,XsTream23,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:36:37 2015 UTC,"i wasn t suggesting you were, i was talking mostly in general, most of ""fans"" were doing it ,  understood your point though and i agree with it ."

People dont want to come to terms with pedro leaving, since he's been loyal and patient with us for so many years. If they were neutrals they would want pedro to get playing time since he's too good for bench. I too dont want him to go :("
Barca,387lc7,MSNFCBLove,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:43:42 2015 UTC,"I know about his history and how well he's done, and I don't want to see him leave either, but it just happens in football, theres no way he can get into the first team with MSN, and you can tell he's fed up of subbing, so I feel he might want to leave. I hope he doesnt though. ):"
Barca,387lc7,XsTream23,2,Tue Jun 2 15:11:17 2015 UTC,"he loves Barcelona though and i m thinking he might stay , i think Lucho will have a talk with him untill his contract ends and might try to convince him to not leave the team , if not though, i d understand, he s done his job and duty for the team , often unappreciated enough especially in last few years when his role and position at the club changed ."
Barca,387lc7,Aj16ay,5,Tue Jun 2 15:26:40 2015 UTC,I want him in the first team next season
Barca,387lc7,Marchisio,3,Tue Jun 2 14:52:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, and if his attitude doesn't change then loan him out come December and we can figure out what we do for a substitute."
Barca,387lc7,johan14cruyff,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:36:28 2015 UTC,"He is the kind of player who has lots of ability, but needs the tactical discipline to succeed. That is something you learn by playing with people like Xavi, Iniesta and Busquets, not by staying on the bench of Sevilla, where though the manager wants to help you, it wouldn't be his top priority because he knows you will leave.  But again, playing time is also very important in developing that aspect, and I don't think he would get any more playing time than he got in Sevilla."

Barca,386n6z,Duke--Nukem,21,Tue Jun 2 09:43:23 2015 UTC,"You can actually see how much relieved and happy Messi was after scoring that goal. The last I remember him showing such feelings was when Argentina won the semis penalty shootout. I had screamed so loud and for so long after that goal that I couldn't speak properly for the next week. But man, that goal after all the statements made by the Bayern players, bringing back the world cup memories... I was so so goddamn happy and excited that I can't explain.  Plus the added redemption for the 7-0, and the look on Neuer and Muller, seeing them loose made me so happy. The only person I felt ssorry for in that whole Bayern team was Pep only. Everyone else just reminded me of the world cup and the 7-0...  Messi's second made me explode :D"
Barca,386n6z,invice,13,Tue Jun 2 13:37:01 2015 UTC,Are you me ? because that's exactly how it went for me as well. I (sportively) hate those german cunts. Especially Neuer & Muller.  Messi's expression just sums it up for all Barca fans I guess :)
Barca,386n6z,Duke--Nukem,7,Tue Jun 2 13:39:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly, his expression is the best abridged form of all the feelings that goal let out of us cules. It was just enough to show the idiots that Messi is really out of this world. And seeing Germans crash and burn is just the next best thing."
Barca,386n6z,invice,2,Tue Jun 2 13:46:37 2015 UTC,"I've never hated Neuer but after reading what he said on Messi that was originally published in l'equipe, I've lost my respect on him, this is professional football and a true player would never show such arrogance."
Barca,386n6z,Football_Enthusiast,3,Thu Jun 4 20:27:43 2015 UTC,"I feel like as many goals as Messi scores, he knows when he's scored a really great one. Goals like this and the one against Bilbao make it evident in his celebratory response."

The last I remember him showing such feelings was when Argentina won the semis penalty shootout.   Totally agreed with you. Messi does celebrate after scoring goals but expressing emotions in that way isn't something which I've noticed in his goal celebration style a lot. But I believe Messi is still seeking redemption from WC '14 final defeat, just take a look at this and his celebration after his first stunner against Bayern shows probably from now on scoring against the Germans will be something special for him. And Messi's second goal in that match is still my favorite moment in this season."

Barca,386n6z,Football_Enthusiast,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:52:25 2015 UTC,"It just brings back really bad memories for me as that was the first time I saw Messi sad and depressed to a stage that I have not seen him. The look on his face when they gave him the golden ball explains everything. Bland, no expressions, no hope in those eyes of his, as if he had lost everything that night. It was to much for me. Seeing my best player, the person who literally never shows his emotions on the pitch standing there, looking as if the world had ended was too much for me.i dearly hope that I never see that look on his face ever again.tbh I hope I never see that look on anyone's face ever again"
Barca,386n6z,invice,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:11:01 2015 UTC,"The look on his face when they gave him the golden ball explains everything. Bland, no expressions, no hope in those eyes of his, as if he had lost everything that night.   I share the same sentiment, that golden ball was merely a consolation sort of price which I highly doubt could give any consolation to Messi and that proves how much he wanted to win that World Cup. It is true that he did everything he could, he dragged Argentina almost alone throughout the tournament (there were some others from his side who did fine but not everyone) and made it to the final after 24 years; but it was just too much pressure for him I think because matches after matches in WC '14 his team mates were relying too much on him and despite of wasting few wonderful chances to score in the final how come was it possible for Argentina to win that match? Its just sad that his team mates incapability cost him WC '14 final victory."
Barca,386n6z,Football_Enthusiast,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:31:35 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right. If only one Argentinian had just stood there with him to finish what he created, they would have won. But the team had only Messi and Masche as people who did some shit. Everyone else was just a spectator, and that can not win them everything. If Higuain can't finish a one on one from that far, then what can Messi do? People say that Messi just scored in group stages, but remove Messi and that yean would not even cross the round of eight"
Barca,386n6z,invice,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:56:11 2015 UTC,"Messi, Mascherano and Lavezzi were the people who did really well throughout the tournament. Higuain and Palacio both missed the best opportunities that would made them the world champion but alas these guys couldn't honor Messi's sacrifice and hardship. This pressure of playing the WC final being the best player in Argentina team was so intense for him that it was really hard for his nerves to deal with; did you notice that Messi retched during the final? What a shame the whole Argentina team couldn't take advantage of having the best player of the world playing by their side."

When I watched him duke out two dudes against belgium in the WC, I knew I wanted to follow this guy. To also add  I knew NOTHING about barca's history. I didn't even know how international football worked. I just watched on of their games and fell in love. I mean how can anyone call our style boring!

Barca,386n6z,beastcat,13,Tue Jun 2 07:17:44 2015 UTC,"i feel like this match is set up for suarez and iniesta. it will be interesting seeing iniesta dribble up through the middle and seeing how juve presses him. Also, with this messi, i wonder what magic trick he'll pull out of the bag.  Also, i think a Masche and pique at CB will be the best. I'm worried about tevez going forward and the great display and dribbles he had against madrid were impressive. i would like to pick mathieu over masche but i feel like pique and mathieu both have that last man mentality where they go for the same balls and get confused, or are delayed in reaction when playing together."
Barca,386n6z,Football_Enthusiast,15,Tue Jun 2 11:01:10 2015 UTC,"I think the Mascherano and Pique CB pair shouldn't be broken for this match. Tevez and Morata, both are in good form but I have faith on our defense, Juventus offense will hopefully be foiled by our defenders.   Suarez haven't scored any since the quarter-final stage so I hope he will score at least one goal in the final. And I'd expect Xavi to play this one last game for Barça in his deadly form. It won't be easy for him to pull out but I think he will put everything on the line to make Barça victorious.   And our Messi, '13-'14 season and WC '14 have been really hard for him go though so I firmly believe that Messi will do whatever it takes to win the glory. Not saying that Juventus will be an easy opponent to defeat but I hope Barça will win this UCL against all the odds."

Barca,386n6z,Football_Enthusiast,4,Tue Jun 2 15:58:29 2015 UTC,ney and suarez strengthened their relationship on attack   This is really crucial for Barça. I totally agree with you.
Barca,386n6z,invice,6,Tue Jun 2 16:06:56 2015 UTC,"I will never be confident in Mathieu. His play with the ball is too shaky, and he does not understand the Barca system perfectly. Many a times I have seen the guy try fancy stuffs, almost all of which lead to utter failures, and someone else has to clean up after him. He is a good sub, can do nice things, is pacey, and has height, but technically he is poor when compared to Masche. Masche's decision making supersedes Mathieu and he is less prone to get beaten. And, we do not need that much of aerial advantage over Juve. Masche can take care of that. He holds up the player he is responsible for amazingly.  Plus, Pique Masche is tried and tested week in week out in dire circumstances. Why to fix something that is not broken>?"
Barca,386n6z,beastcat,7,Tue Jun 2 13:30:58 2015 UTC,"Mathieu has had some exhilarating performances, especially in crucial matches, the madrid and this other game come to mind where he single handedly won us 6 points.  I think it really depends on the team we face, matheiu has good characteristics that can help us a lot with certain teams. Also, Its going to be interesting how matheius chemistry develops with our CB pairings over the next few years."
Barca,386n6z,invice,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"His goals do not hide the fact that he is shaky and not Barca level at passing and understanding the team play. Barca's passing is just too good, and he isn't equal to it. I don't say that he is not a good player, I just meant that he is better as a subwhen we have control of the game. He adds an element of randomness to our backline which should have amazing ball control, because giving up the ball there will leave the opposition one on one with keeper.  I do love the player, its just that I would prefer Masche due to his calmness and less mistakes. But thats my opinion, and it definitely could be wrong."

I have been a lurker on this sub for 4-6 years now (I don't remember when I started but it was in the early stages and a friend told me about it) but I have never posted anything. I have been a huge barcelona fan since the original ronaldo in 98. I have finally decided to make a reddit account and this is my first ever post. I figured this is probably the best platform to do so given the great month all us cules are having!  What a season this has been! Full of ups and downs especially in the first half. What a turn around though! I am incredibly excited for the match this saturday and fully believe we can pull this off. I love watching this team play. The front three are devastating, the midfield has come to life the past 4 months and the defense has been absolutley phenomenal! Its incredible how under valued and under appreciated the overall defensive performance of this team has been! I am excited about the future too. The talents coming up are phenomenal (samper, rafinha, etc), I just hope we continue to develop them and not revert to buying every great player on the market. The fact this current board will hopefully be leaving soon is also something to look forward to! What a great time it is to be a cule, we have literally only had 1 bad and 2 ""rough"" seasons since 08-09  Anyhow I just wanted to say Hi, I feel like I know a lot of you already from all the lurking here over the years. I will definitely be making more posts in the future."

Didn't see this when Bayern won CL due to half the Dortmund's starters missing. But when we came into the picture, its all due to injuries.

Barca,386n6z,Saltones,12,Tue Jun 2 07:45:23 2015 UTC,They're not supposed to be confident? Juventus can match Barca on every front except the attack. They know they can steal it if they setup well. The best team doesn't always win you know

Barca,387xj6,ImNotAnAlien,25,Tue Jun 2 18:27:17 2015 UTC,"Cristiano and Raul are egocentric. They'd rather have the team win 2-1 with their goals, rather than 5-0 without any goal of them   I'm not surprised about this   Iker once said that Fernando Torres was the most overrated player in Spanish football history.   Many people consider him a flop, but i can understand - if cassilas really said this - why he called torres overrated. He won highest goal scorer for a spanish team that didnt have many quality strikers but good passers from the midfield.   Cristiano is arrogant, but at the end is at least true to what he shows. On the other hand, Messi is false & provocative. Pepe & Ramos were abused in such bad words by Messi that no one imagined a quiet & seemingly good guy like him to say such things.   Well now Dudek, If ever messi said such words i can bet you guys said worse and certainly hurt worse"
Barca,387xj6,Mr_Constantine,17,Tue Jun 2 14:34:54 2015 UTC,"Okay. Casillas is sure hurt that Messi made him one of his b#*%#es (I have a lot of respect for Casillas, one of the few RM  players I don't hate, but I am putting that respect aside for a moment).  Your teammates fucking trampled over Messi time and again. Just because Messi used swear words doesn't mean he's hiding it all other time. In fact, your team has got the worst out of Messi who is quite down to earth and forgiving otherwise. There is a saturation point for even the most humblest of humans. And when they do lose their cool, you can't just forget all the times shown humility and just say 'he's arrogant but he hides it'. Fuck that argument."
Barca,387xj6,maskiwear,10,Tue Jun 2 16:18:41 2015 UTC,lmao the post on r/soccer is a mess. apparently trash talking players in a game means you're a terrible human being. poor madrid being bullied by those provocative barca players.
Barca,387xj6,jl8912,18,Tue Jun 2 16:40:14 2015 UTC,"I don't care at all what he says about his team mates, but it boils my blood that he brings in Barcelona into this. I know its to generate sales, but still... seething  I wonder how he would know about all the things that Messi and Guardiola's Barcelona got to, considering I don't think he ever played against us.  (Not saying our players are saints, because they clearly aren't, but these quotes imply that they are worse than the average footballer)"

Whatever he knows about Messi is what Pepe and Ramos said about him when coming back to the dressing room after having lost 0-5. No wonder it's not nice things."
Barca,387xj6,godie,8,Tue Jun 2 17:11:07 2015 UTC,"What a little bitch. Its funny that people even care to know what Dudek has to say. He is a nobody and will be forgotten in a few years time. On the other hand this team has etched itself into footballing lore. Years from now people will say, is X team better than the Barcelona team of the 2000's...whereas Dudek will be only remembered by his great grand children..if even."

We played so well and so full of confidence against the mighty Manchester United side, and we won it in arguably one of the grandest stadiums in the world.

Barca,3846j6,xscientist,13,Mon Jun 1 19:12:01 2015 UTC,"Oldest is Suarez at 28. With a proper back up and some luck staying fit, he can play for 5-6 seasons easily and at a top level too."
Barca,3846j6,Kluey,6,Tue Jun 2 00:27:43 2015 UTC,"5-6 seasons is stretching it a bit too much imo. Beyond 32, I think it would be difficult for Suarez to do all the work he currently does, running around, and all that. But 3-4 is  a really reasonable guess, as that can be expected from Suarez. And who knows, maybe Neymar turns into some beast like Messi, and these two start assisting him?? one can hope"

Barca,38334z,rocksteadybebop,9,Mon Jun 1 16:49:30 2015 UTC,I think either Neymar or James. James has been outstanding at Real

He said James might become better.   in a Neymar post   Still relevant to the post, as Xavi was discussing the best player after Messi retires/declines.   in a Barca sub   Exactly, on reddit, not in the Camp fucking Nou. You've probably never even been there anyway, you have no reason to be outraged you mug."
Barca,38334z,choss,8,Mon Jun 1 21:08:56 2015 UTC,everytime i see neymar play..all i could think about is how cristiano ronaldo played earlier at manu..
Barca,38334z,invice,23,Mon Jun 1 21:20:31 2015 UTC,"Me too. But to me Neymar is way less flashy than CR7 in Man U days, all I remember CR7 is moving the feet a lot but rarely going past a defender. If I see highlight videos of both I see most goals from Ronaldo are from long distance shots and free kicks than dribbles, whereas Neymar has more impressive dribbles highlight already."
Barca,38334z,Blazenbladez,5,Mon Jun 1 21:24:00 2015 UTC,"Neymar is a really wonderful player. At this young age, the guy already obliterates oppositions single handedly for his national team, which young C. Ronaldo never did. He is the creator and the executor there, and for Barca, the guy has very nicely blended in, combining with all others to produce orgasmic displays time and time again.Young C. Ronaldo was very good, but Neymar has been on another level at such a young age. He is a goal scorer, and even then, he is brilliant in team play, as was never seen in young C. Ronaldo. Neymar can show individual brilliance, yet his team play is nearly awesome. So I think that Neymar will go a lot far than people think, maybe not to Messi's level (the guy is god, no one can become god), but can easily come near or maybe even surpass present C. Ronaldo, or the best C. Ronaldo. Do keep in mind that this will happen assuming his growth in the next years to be good. Currently, he is quite behind him, but if I had to nominate someone to take that role in the foreseeable future, I would say Neymar in a heart beat."
Barca,382zuj,viscaelbarca1899,42,Mon Jun 1 14:09:40 2015 UTC,"I see him fully transitioning as a n10 as he gets older, and just before he retires (hopefully never!) he would be playing in a Xavi type role controlling the pace and the game play of the team since he has great vision and passing. That's my prediction"
Barca,382zuj,choss,-5,Mon Jun 1 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"His movement is the only thing that worries me about that transition.. he really only moves when the ball is at his feet or on its way to him. He's been better about it this year.. but as he becomes less mobile with age, it may be a problem."
Barca,382zuj,nannulators,10,Mon Jun 1 20:53:04 2015 UTC,"I kinda agree with you, he doesn't run too much now because it reduces his risk for injuries and conserves him for the long haul of the season. I've never really seen him run like a mid would so I don't know if he can do what Xavi does but maybe if he has 2 more physical midfielders that support him he can play that way."
Barca,382zuj,Tardigrater,5,Mon Jun 1 23:29:11 2015 UTC,He also seems to conserve a big bit of energy for the end of the games when defenders are more tired. Loads of his amazing goals are scored in the last third of the game.
Barca,382zuj,romanmoses,4,Tue Jun 2 00:14:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. there's nothing wrong with the reasoning for it and with the dependence on him as our main attacker lifted a bit, it hasn't been a problem. But that doesn't necessarily translate to playing in the center of the pitch.  I think you're right that it could work if we switched to 2 DMs, but until I see it, I'll always be a bit skeptical."
Barca,382zuj,nannulators,6,Tue Jun 2 13:35:17 2015 UTC,Do you even watch him play?
Barca,382zuj,Duke--Nukem,-5,Mon Jun 1 21:09:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I have for the past 7 years. Over the past 3 years or so his movement off the ball has decreased dramatically. This year he has been more active, but still restricted to less than 25% of the pitch a majority of the time. In one of the heatmaps that you posted yourself it shows that while he pops up more centrally on occasion, he pretty much limits himself to a very small slice of the pitch.   Most people in this sub could vouch for the fact that in the Tito and Tata eras Messi did a lot of standing and watching. Even still, he has bouts of standing and watching. His passing and vision are excellent. His dribbling (from the wing) is excellent. But his workrate off the ball is pretty horrid. There's nothing wrong with it because it works, but if he's playing CM in a deeper role a la Xavi, he needs to be moving a little bit more off the ball."
Barca,382zuj,nannulators,7,Mon Jun 1 22:04:22 2015 UTC,"Messi doesn't have to run all around the pitch, it's not his job. Messi's movement off the ball is excellent. Yes, he doesn't always track back but he gets involved when the ball is near his area and often drifts back or switches positions with Suarez and Rakitic."
Barca,382zuj,Duke--Nukem,3,Mon Jun 1 22:15:01 2015 UTC,"He rarely tracks back. He rarely defends. If he tries to dribble and loses the ball, he's not going to try to get it back unless he's pissed off.   He's only involved when the ball is near him. The reason it seems like he does more is because defenders constantly have to watch him. They can't just ignore him if he's standing out wide because he's always dangerous.  As a striker, you're right, he doesn't have to do the extra running. As a winger, though, he should be doing a bit more, and that includes defending. He hasn't been a player who presses fervently since early in his career. If he were to drop deeper and play midfield, he would have to.  Not saying he couldn't do it, but everything about the way Messi stands/walks when he's not on the ball and how easily he gives up when he could defend or at least apply pressure to someone are concerns for him transitioning to a midfield role. Good midfielders have to be more active than Messi typically is."
Barca,382zuj,nannulators,5,Tue Jun 2 13:15:20 2015 UTC,"I said ""not always"""
Barca,382zuj,Duke--Nukem,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:55:14 2015 UTC,"I think the guy above meant to show that Messi does track back and used the video to support his argument. The video is an excellent example of how Messi does track back, its just that he preserves himself and doesn't want to do that. In the video, Pep is shown saying that Messi is the best defender, because if he is determined to get the ball back, no one can do anything to stop him, and no one can rob him of the ball"
Barca,382zuj,invice,7,Mon Jun 1 23:02:24 2015 UTC,"I can see him being an upgraded version of Aimar when he gets older. I bet it was his childhood dream to become a player like Pablo.   Come to think about it, Argentina has been really blessed with the best AMs. Maradona, Aimar, Riquelme, Veron, Ortega... It's unbelievable."
Barca,382zuj,shanigan,6,Tue Jun 2 09:42:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it'll be at least few years before that happens. He doesn't look like he's slowing down any time soon."

Barca,382zuj,TimeFingers,0,Tue Jun 2 01:04:45 2015 UTC,i don't think he could be a traditional midfielder..with all that running..he now enjoys a much more free role..i have never heard of a midfielder with no defensive duty..he would probably continue his false 9 position but much deeper
Barca,382zuj,ankata,22,Tue Jun 2 06:32:50 2015 UTC,A no. 10 then? Riquelme did little to no defensive work.
Barca,382zuj,choss,3,Mon Jun 1 14:21:43 2015 UTC,Agree! He has great vision and passing.

Barca,382zuj,cesarfcb1991,2,Mon Jun 1 15:43:10 2015 UTC,Didn't Van Gaal play him out of positon? I remember people mentioning that before.
Barca,382zuj,philwelch,6,Mon Jun 1 15:44:27 2015 UTC,"He did. Played him as a winger. LvG took his anger out on him, since the board signed him and not van Gaal himself."
Barca,382zuj,romanmoses,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:37:05 2015 UTC,As I though. Kind of hard to blame Riquelme for that..
Barca,382zuj,epicstar,3,Mon Jun 1 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"In this case, yes, it's all on LvG, it's just that he's always been a pure no. 10. I'm not sure he'd adapt to van Gaal's (if he gave him a chance) or Rijkaards playing style/philosophy. He was the kind of player you build a team around, not a someone you expect to adapt to a total football variant."
Barca,382zuj,UsernameAlreadyUsed,13,Mon Jun 1 20:02:41 2015 UTC,Messi could probably play in a Pirlo role at age 40.
Barca,382zuj,TheR-Dog,2,Mon Jun 1 20:21:35 2015 UTC,I would love to see this. He has defensive capabilities—someone of note said he'd be the best LB in the world if he played there—but atm he doesn't interest himself much with defending. Who knows what could happen in the next 13 years tho...

They are a little bit like divas sometimes when you see them: they don’t like to defend. So it will be interesting to see how Juventus can create unhappiness in their game. These kind of players like to have the ball, they want to play, they want to enjoy movements, to pass the ball around. If Juve makes sure that can’t happen, as the game goes on they’ll become more and more frustrated and they can lose their discipline.""

Barca,382dwy,Marchisio,24,Mon Jun 1 12:46:10 2015 UTC,Please be true. We need Alves and he's done enough for the club to deserve w/e he's asking for honestly.
Barca,382dwy,imfatal,13,Mon Jun 1 12:47:16 2015 UTC,"Alves has been great. His understanding and especially friendship with Messi should be valued. But the club has to think about the bigger picture. Players wages and transfer fees have inflated a lot, if the board is thinking of bringing in a big signing (Pogba?) they should be hard in negotiating with Alves.   The good thing is both club and player want to find an agreement. I hope it'll happen."
Barca,382dwy,Duke--Nukem,15,Mon Jun 1 13:31:10 2015 UTC,"I would have Alves over Pogba any day of the week or month or year or millennia for that matter! We're not very spoiled for choice at RB and to be honest, we will never find anyone who has the kinda understanding with Messi down that right hand side. It is something that has developed over the years, something that no matter how much money you put in you can never buy, Messi ain't getting any younger and obviously Alves isn't either, it's in the best interests of everyone involved that he stays! We could get a younger/new RB and make that one compete with Dani's spot with the eventual aim of taking over, maybe he can see Dani and Messi together and be able to forge a teeny bit of what Dani and Messi share on the pitch.   For all his shenanigans, tantrums on the pitch and bad form displayed over the last few seasons, Daniel Alves is absolutely imperative to our system and virtually indispensable. I am for one, baffled as to why the Board didn't take care of contractual scenario earlier. We NEED him to stay."
Barca,382dwy,MobyGlitch,6,Mon Jun 1 14:08:41 2015 UTC,"Except Alves is a asking for a SHITLOAD of money and a 3 year contract, at the age of 32. A right back. You know sometimes when it gets this ridiculous it's better to let go. I'm sure someone like Bellerin could take up his place without too many issues, Messi can link with any decent player. And don't get me wrong i want him to stay, but for a reasonably price."
Barca,382dwy,droid750,4,Mon Jun 1 15:23:16 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I don't deny the fact that Messi can link up with any good player. All I'm trying to state  is that we can pay a little more money to retain an essential component in our system for some more time, in order for this system, which has been running efficiently for a good 7 years almost now, to remain in tact a little longer so that it can be phased out properly. Loosing Abi, Puyol, Valdes, now Xavi, maybe Pedrito and maybe Alves as well, is actually a disintegration of one of our most successful systems. It must happen gradually. It's imperative we usher a new, slightly different system, I must emphasize on its importance but It should be phased in.   Dani plays at a tactically very vital position for us and has been for years! Someone can TOTALLY come in and replace him and hopefully in a better way but we can not take that chance till January at least anyway. If he doesn't want to leave and is playing as well as he has been off late, we should consider that and paying a little more money won't really hurt the Board, think about it. Offloading Douglas and Montoya maybe, in the 16-17 season and bringing in a quality RB who can compete with Dani, eventually take over and have a Masia/B team prospect as our tertiary option will be a prudent and safe strategy to adopt, at least in my very modest opinion."

Barca,382rg8,Fifaman10,21,Mon Jun 1 13:02:29 2015 UTC,"I'm disappointed the video didn't end with THAT nutmeg.   Alves is such a beast, I hope he retires here."
Barca,382rg8,Duke--Nukem,6,Mon Jun 1 13:37:11 2015 UTC,Alves plays such an offensive role it's almost hard to forget that he's a defender.  'mirin that Ronaldo speed and athleticism tho. The one other player that reminds me of winger-Ronaldo is Angel Di Maria. (inb4 Di Maria is nothing like Ronaldo)
Barca,382rg8,InAnIndianAccent,8,Mon Jun 1 15:21:10 2015 UTC,Ronaldo is overrated 1 vs 1 tho
Barca,382rg8,eirik124,16,Mon Jun 1 14:01:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that, I would say he is very strong one on one but when you put him against a very strong right back like Dani or even two players, he struggles.   Another thing is that he just isn't as good as he used to be at dribbling...current Ronaldo has no chance of dribbling past Dani...however Manchester United Ronaldo could have definitely been a worthy challenger."
Barca,382rg8,ragdoll96,12,Mon Jun 1 14:13:00 2015 UTC,His only strength in one-on-one is his helicopter foot movement and immense speed. Even the former isn't that good anymore.
Barca,382rg8,VictorEremitaK,13,Mon Jun 1 14:28:13 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why players keep doing useless step-overs, just look at this video of C. Ronaldo, he never accomplished anything with them. The same for Neymar.   It's all about body movement, making your opponent thing you are going to the left and instead going the right. Now look at how Ronaldinho did it"

I did the same thing where I was only in Barcelona for the day on a cruise.   We went to the Sagrada Familia in the AM (to avoid the most tourists possible) and taxi'd over to the stadium afterwards. The stadium is maybe a 5-10 minute taxi ride from the port where most of the cruises dock, so you shouldn't really worry too much on your time.   Meander around the stadium's outside and enjoy the bars!"
Barca,385fg9,JWayneF,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:03:24 2015 UTC,So I shouldn't go first thing in the morning? I figured the city would be hype if we win so it would be worth it to get off the ship as early as possible. Are you saying lots of people get there at 9:30?
Barca,3844j5,maskiwear,23,Mon Jun 1 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"he will be training in these boots, and probably would have trained in them for weeks before agreeing to wear them for the game. Doubt he'd just put em on for the game for the first time"
Barca,3844j5,toomaszobel,3,Mon Jun 1 19:14:07 2015 UTC,"I've only seen him wear them literally about 4 times max. Not to mention the stud pattern on his last ones had to be changed to the old ones, and these new ones are completely new, and feature a 3D printed skeleton. I hope they give him an old pair of F50s with the same color way and design honestly, I couldn't give a shit about Adidas making money. Plus they don't even go on sale until July 1. Praying they don't affect messis performance."
Barca,3844j5,xFragg,6,Tue Jun 2 01:46:04 2015 UTC,"I may be completely wrong, but I think they usually wear ""black"" boots that mould/feel like the finished product. During training sessions, you can see players where these ""black"" boots."
Barca,3844j5,millionsofdollars,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"Nope totally correct. I think about it like testing cars. Honestly if I wasn't lazy I'd Google some pics for you, but when they test expensive cars such as Ferrari or Lamborghini, they put these ""camos"" so you don't see the details of the cars. The ""black out"" boots you see have the same concept, they need to test the model out without revealing details. However a lot of Asian websites are the ones to reveal leaks(not trying to be racist, but it's because they are mostly made in Asian countries). I knew about the Adidas X and Ace since maybe September 2014 maybe. And they released a couple days ago. The blackout boots that Messi wore I have only seen 4 times total. Honestly Adidas should have made him wear it more often, but I think he'd have a problem with that. The 2015 f50 AdiZero featured a stud pattern with 3 heel studs, with little ""teeth"" like textured sole plates in the front area. Messi didn't wear those and instead wore a pair with the 2014 AdiZero f50 stud pattern. Come to think of it, it was actually a 2014 AdiZero with the leather upper(messi has never worn synthetic) and the 2015 design. Messi is very picky when it comes to cleats honestly. Which is why to a regular person it might seem like nothing, but to someone who does a lot of research on this its worry some."
Barca,3844j5,xFragg,4,Tue Jun 2 04:25:23 2015 UTC,"I guarantee he will have an old pair to switch into in a moments notice if the new ones aren't working out well. Happens often in soccer, though it usually goes unnoticed."
Barca,3844j5,Not_Tom_Brady,4,Mon Jun 1 22:03:57 2015 UTC,"It'll probably just be a new color way of the current boots he has. It's a common occurrence and I highly doubt it does anything, it's just for show and more $$$"
Barca,3844j5,TheStallion420,3,Mon Jun 1 18:52:46 2015 UTC,"It won't, it's a brand new brand is of boots. This is the first time they're being worn in a match. I assume all the other Adidas players will be wearing other new boots too."
Barca,3844j5,D3r3k23,10,Tue Jun 2 00:35:12 2015 UTC,"Na messi has his own silo. Suarez will be wearing the Adidas X, Rakitic the Ace, Xavi the ace probably or his special predators, MAtS the Ace, and jordi alba the X I believe. Really sucky, because messi has only trained in his new silos 3 times that I've seen. They are also completely new designwise. The last generation F50s featured a new sole plate and messi didn't like it so he wore the F50s from the previous generation with the same design. Really shitty timing from Adidas to completely switch boots but who cares as long as they make money. Nike on the other hand released new Hypervenoms which Neymar had weeks to train in and even asked for a specific customized model, it's gonna be hard for them to do that for messi. Also I just realized I wrote a whole paragraph on boots"

I know at least 3 upcoming color ways of the new messi cleats that literally were announced today. I mean if you'd like I could go into detail about Messi or Suarez or Neymars cleats because I find them so cool honestly. Maybe im just weird tho"
Barca,3844j5,xFragg,2,Tue Jun 2 01:58:59 2015 UTC,Please do tell! Interesting stuff for me as well!
Barca,3844j5,YO_putThatBagBackON,2,Tue Jun 2 04:17:14 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I knew that but my wording was a little off."
Barca,3844j5,D3r3k23,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:48:32 2015 UTC,"Haha the amount of people interested in boots is so low, when it's the coolest aspect of the players honestly in my opinion. I love seeing all these new ""technologies"" that provide no sort of advantage whatsoever! However sole plates are a huge issue which is why I'm very concerned with the new Messi cleats. Bad move from Adidas to make him play in them!"
Barca,3844j5,xFragg,3,Tue Jun 2 01:56:11 2015 UTC,"There are a few things with boots that do affect your performance.  The design of the studs, The texture of the material and its grip on the ball, and the weight of the boot will affect how quick your feet will feel.  Messi's Adidas's are extremely light.  I'm not sure how this newer model is different, but you can bet it won't be that much different.  Can you link where you read this?"

Barca,3844j5,chickenmagic,0,Mon Jun 1 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"While I'm sure it can have some effect if you're used to something specific, I think that when a player is as good as Messi is, I can't see it being a problem. Honestly think he could play in crocs and still be the best player on the pitch.  I guess it also depends on how ""religious"" he is with his boots, if he gets unlucky a few times in the start of a game, and start wondering if it's the boots, I could see it be a problem, but again it depends on how much you believe the boots can change."
Barca,3844j5,kezorN,-8,Tue Jun 2 12:17:26 2015 UTC,"Every time he changes his boots ,his form dips. I hope this is not gonna happen in UCL  Edit:-I'm getting down voted for stating the truth."

Barca,3832dv,Football_Enthusiast,8,Mon Jun 1 20:05:31 2015 UTC,It isn't absolutely necessary but how about bringing up some new ideas in the way the honors of Barça that are shown in the sidebar? I'm no programmer or a graphic designer but I'm pretty sure that there are many Barça supporters who are creative enough to make something cool/innovative to display the honors in our subreddit.
Barca,3832dv,Football_Enthusiast,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe those redditors who are interested could put together some ideas for the mods to look into - I am a complete dork when dealing with web coding, but I'd love to see some options."
Barca,3832dv,_sic,2,Mon Jun 1 19:59:40 2015 UTC,"We are considering getting rid of the small individual trophies and replacing them with bigger gifs of the three major trophies that show the number of times the trophy was won on mouseover. There are just too many trophies won since /r/barca was founded ;)  If anybody has good gifs of the liga, copa and CL trophies (silhouettes in a neutral color like grey or silver) or knows  how to make them please let us know.  We're also open to other ways of displaying the honors, so if anybody has any ideas please forward them to the mods.   EDIT: For the time being I've added the individual liga and Copa trophies, but as you can see there is no more room for trophies on a single row."
Barca,3832dv,Football_Enthusiast,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:49:27 2015 UTC,I think the honors of Barça can be displayed in this way: Place each of the trophy icons (not small but medium size trophy icons) in the sidebar and hovering the mouse cursor over them displays the number of times Barça have won them. And clicking on them will lead to wikipedia page of Barça honors or List of FC Barcelona records and statistics.
Barca,3832dv,Football_Enthusiast,2,Tue Jun 2 12:22:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I mentioned we might do. If you can find any good quality gifs as I asked that would be helpful."

Barca,3832dv,_sic,2,Tue Jun 2 14:16:27 2015 UTC,"No, want them to look like graphics, not like realistic trophies. Like the icons we have, but larger, and perhaps glossier."

Barca,384vkb,JurijFedorov,2,Mon Jun 1 22:22:20 2015 UTC,The team did very badly. Terrible stats. Look them up. But I think that the problem is the same we somewhat see with Pep. He brings total football tiki-taka to teams that don't have the same players. That's what Lucho did. And that's why I am saying he needed more time. Roma today has bought shit players and are not good. Much better than under him but a long way from great.   Celta Vigo and Rafinha there were amazing as he had the right players.

Barca,384iij,tonytetova,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:00:04 2015 UTC,He also has more talent at his disposal this time around though. I feel like he will try and exploit our midfield and use our high pressure against us as he has more physical and tactically organized midfield. Can't be too confident I'm expecting a tough challenge and a PK shoot out doesn't seem too far fetched.
Barca,384iij,chaboi_1,0,Tue Jun 2 03:18:44 2015 UTC,Nah they'll park the bus after 15 minutes.
Barca,382i3f,imfatal,3,Mon Jun 1 11:30:33 2015 UTC,Its truly incredible how pretty much every goal except one or two tap-ins are either amazing or incredible. He has such a good finish and touch.   My goodness we better keep him.

Barca,38340s,IhateAngryBirds,5,Mon Jun 1 15:17:24 2015 UTC,"I think Lucho brought some stabilization to the team. As Rakitić recently stated about Lucho: he's been able to get the best out of the players. So in my opinion we're feeling comfortable off the ball just as much as we are on the ball; which is so relieving. With positive results comes the boost of confidence. Ergo, leaving the shakiness in the past; like driving into the sunsut and looking at your rear view. We're almost there, 1 more trophy to go."

I just wanted to point out the fact that I've seen many times in this sub people saying that Busquets is very underrated. Well, I don't think that's true. He's widely recognized as one of the best players in the world in his role, and even if he's not as ""flashy"" as some of our other players (although the back heel here was very neat), it's undeniable that his task creating chances for us and destroying our rivals' game and chances is very impressive.  I just like him very much! :-)"

He's on his own gaming platform and everyone else just so happen to be playing online with him. Does he need a fire team of 3 guardians to save the universe? It'd be nice. But can he do it alone?

There are plenty of resources and websites online:  http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/staff/players/neymar-jr/stats  http://www.whoscored.com/Players/50835/  http://www.squawka.com/players/neymar/stats  http://www.transfermarkt.com/neymar/profil/spieler/68290  Right now it says 49 matches / 39 goals. How much goals per game or goals per minute is that? Do some math on your own and include it if you have to :) Make it cool. Right now there is nothing I can't check for myself in a matter of minute.  2) Try to put those stats in a table with some cool graphics that blend with the rest of the image or try to align them in a nice way so that they look naturally placed.  3) The font you used is terrible. You can find some really nice fonts online. Check this website - http://fontsquirrel.com/ awesome fonts here and completely free (most of them). You can also check http://1001freefonts.com/ where you can type a word or phrase and it will render previews for you which would help you decide easier.  4) One more thing about fonts - their edges are too sharp. You probably didn't use Photoshop's anti-aliasing option. Bottom right corner of this image, set it to ""Smooth"" or ""Sharp"" to avoid results like this.  5) Your background is also questionable, to put it in a polite way :)  That's some stuff I can think of. Hope it helps. Cheers."

Barca,37zkrx,JurijFedorov,16,Sun May 31 21:06:02 2015 UTC,Xavi is humble on the behalf of Busquets. Busquets is the most intelligent player that has ever played the game. I think he is even more intelligent than Xavi while Xavi is a greater leader and passer. Busquets could be the worst footballer in the world and still play professional football. He will be a great coach when time comes. Xavi too. Those 2 will be coaches in Barcelona.

He doesn;t mean Busquets will take his exact position. Xavi meants that Busquets will be the leader of the Barca's tactics, he can do that from the DM, or CM, doesn't matter  We still need a great CM, not someone exactly but someone who can control the ball, like Verrati or Koke....and definitely not someone because ""he is great in the air"""

We already lost a player like Hector Bellerin, now more will probably follow.   I just hope whoever is the new president can stop the exodus. Loan the more kids out to Girona, which is really close to Barcelona so they won't be far from their families."
Barca,37za7t,CorsarioNero,11,Sun May 31 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"Bellerin wasn't a bad loss. We had Montoya who was miles better at the time, and Bellerin was simply offered a offer too good to refuse, especially when a talented Montoya was ahead of him.  Tables have turned now because Bellerin is getting chances after Arsenal injuries, while Montoya has been benched in the first team for three seasons in a row now. And it's not like Bellerin is amazing or anything, he's average, and Montoya would be alot better at this moment of time if he didn't get ruined."
Barca,37za7t,Morcule,17,Sun May 31 18:45:49 2015 UTC,"For having just turned 20 a month or two ago, I would say Bellerín is definitely above average. Don't just write him off to cement your point.

A great solid team made by Guardiola and Luis Enrique brought to the Segunda from the Tercera División, getting a great #5 position in their first season there.   Then the Eusebio era began, focusing more on individual qualities. Bad, but often real fun anyway; Deulofeu tearing up the league on his own was a great sight to see.   A shame that the lack of continuity in the system that rose them to their highest was the reaon for their downfall. It was expected, but it's sad nonetheless.   Hopefully next season we'll get a proper coach in front of the team, such as Oscar Garcia or Franc Garcia Pimienta (most likely him). It's going to be an interesting summer."

Barca,37za7t,jklz,4,Sun May 31 18:22:14 2015 UTC,Yeah that's true. I just wonder what we'll do with all of talented players that are too good for Segunda B
Barca,37za7t,tasmajdan,8,Sun May 31 18:31:20 2015 UTC,"If they are dead last in the Segunda División, can we say they are too good for Segunda B? Very few of them reached the level they should. Munir, Samper and Grimaldo are pretty much the only ones who proved that they should play at a higher level I feel. Sandro possibly as well, although he has been pretty average for the B-team as well."
Barca,37za7t,tasmajdan,5,Sun May 31 18:34:37 2015 UTC,"Well, those 3 along with Halilović who has a promotion clause. Also Adama I don't think will improve playing 3rd division"
Barca,37za7t,I_am_oneiros,1 point,Sun May 31 18:35:52 2015 UTC,"What is his promotion clause, never hear of such thing. Just curious."
Barca,37za7t,jklz,2,Tue Jun 2 05:51:22 2015 UTC,"His contract has a clause that says after 1 season at the B team he must be promoted. Of course there can be mutual agreement to stay at the B team, but after this relegation I'm sure he'll want to play at a higher level. Likely he'll be loaned out (rumours of Leceister and Sevilla)"

Barca,37za7t,Morcule,3,Tue Jun 2 07:11:55 2015 UTC,"I wonder how much of this is down to the fact that we're now increasingly buying players for the second team. The likes of Gumbau, Halilovic and Suarez have not come through the system but they've been forced to learn the system at a very high level (Segunda division is still quite high).  This affects the others also, because now they're forced to adapt to a different system just to accommodate these 'youth superstars'.  Basically our academy will soon end up like Madrid's at this rate. Produces good players but none of them will be in our first team."
Barca,37za7t,frasier_crane,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:06:23 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Gumbau and Cámara were starters this season in the majority of the matches, while La Masia players like Babunski and Pol Calvet only sat on the bench; this in my opinion should not be the case if you're trying to develop people for the first team."

Xavi, Iniesta, Messi or Busquets never played 2nd division for Barca B (Well Xavi did one season but was relegated).  The reserve team should be a platform for young players, not second Barca with all the presure to be the best team on their level. Lately we have gotten used to succesfull B team, but historically that has not been the case.  What we need, is to sign two, three experienced (around 25 years old), slightly above average players, ideally with Barca background to form a strong core for the B team. These players should help the coach to guide young players. But most importantly, we need to stop give a shit about the results. Those are absolutely irelevant. Barca B is a platform to help introduce our young players to big football, not to put them under pressure. They'll deal with that soon enough in the first squad."
Barca,37za7t,choss,1 point,Sun May 31 20:37:39 2015 UTC,to introduce players to big football is better to play against teams in a second division league and not a third....
Barca,37za7t,barcabastard,6,Mon Jun 1 03:30:27 2015 UTC,"What if this is not such a bad thing? I mean, in Segunda B players will be able to develop far from the lights of fame and will not think everything is done and get comfortable. Segunda B is a rougher place and imho a better place to develop as a person who shall join someday the first team. Remember players like Pedro or Busquets, they came from 3º division straight to the first team. Because that has been one of the problems of Barcelona B this year: young players who are already being drowned in money, interviews and sponsorships, players who are too young to fight in Segunda with far more experienced players than them. Let's see how this develops."
Barca,37za7t,choss,6,Sun May 31 20:59:23 2015 UTC,"They are also dead last in table with one game left to play, so far conceding 81 goals in the league this season, 17 more than the next highest total"
Barca,37za7t,theo_bromine,5,Sun May 31 17:50:40 2015 UTC,"So you guys are saying that Samper, Sandro, Grimaldo, Edgar, Halilovic, Dongou, Munir are way to good for 3rd division. But they still played like crap in 2nd division for 1 full year losing match after match and barely showing their talent. How is that possible?"
Barca,37za7t,Duke--Nukem,3,Mon Jun 1 00:09:11 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure nobody said Sandro, Ié, nor Dongou are way too good for 3rd division, they have all been poor. Halilovic and Adama have lots of potential but need a good coach. If you look at our attacking record, he have done alright. It's just the goals conceded that have been unacceptable. Samper doesn't play enough, and a big reason for our misfiring attacking talent is the awful midfield of Patric, Gumbau, and Camara"

He made great signings last year, especially the goalkeepers, but let's not forget his not so good ones."
Barca,37ylxz,frasier_crane,9,Sun May 31 18:13:29 2015 UTC,"No he didn't. Henrique and Keirrison were signed by Laporta's board; Txiki etc.  And I think coldblade meant his signings this season.  Vermaelen's shouldn't have been approved after he failed his medical, but let's wait and see how he does next season. If he becomes a starter and becomes our best defender (unlikely, but who knows), will he still classify as a bad transfer?"

He started both of those matches. He can be a good defender, and when he comes on, he can often have a nice game when coming in, or he can screw up we have also seen. But when coming on he's usually good.  He's a big man, but we don't notice his set piece skill too often (except from those goals)  But he's not AMAZING. That's all I said, I said AMAZING is not the right word. He is a SOLID or a GOOD sub. When he comes on, he doesn't make it easier for us, he doesn't calm the game down. He doesn't do great contributions, but he doesn't fuck up either. He's just there. Which doesn't make him AMAZING in any sort of way."

A culé can be easily satisfied, happy with everything, and mostly only look at the simple, and positive way of things. Like most here. People here are extremely positive. And I think that extreme positiveness(?) is blinding many people on certain subjects like on the coaches, players and board members.   I get just as happy like you others when we win, score, or someone does something great. But I often disagree when a player etc. get too much praise, or praise for things they don't deserve. And that's when I reply.  It's obvious I'm different from the normal stream of people here. But I will continue commenting, good or bad, 'till I get banned or kicked out.   I love discussing football, if people share my view or don't. I like having discussions with others with a different view, like here, to see WHY they mean this or that. But mostly now, people give two shits about even replying, they just downvote, and think ''take that!'', ''FUCK your opinion, I'm not going to say why I disagree though''.

You're still perfectly welcome to express your opinions of course, and downvoting on this website is out of control, but I find the claims to want discussion a bit disingenuous.   You've had every discussion on Roberto and Mathieu that could possibly be had multiple times, so what's the point of commenting?

Barca,37yx47,camp_nous,12,Sun May 31 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"Don't have time to leave a detailed comment right now, but the thing that stood out to me in this game was how Athletic Bilbao abandoned their no-holds-barred press from earlier meetings, which was vaguely reminiscent of the approach Bayern tried in the Champions League semifinal, and instead adopted a deep, counterattacking 4-4-2 in the style of Simeone's Atlético.  It'll be interesting to see which approach Juventus favors, pressing with its athletic midfield or resting on its organized defense."
Barca,37yx47,Tezemery,17,Sun May 31 16:13:34 2015 UTC,"They started off pressing quite high but they seemed to abandon it for the most part after they went 1-0 down.  I think Juve will sit back and absorb, I personally think they will park the bus for much of the night and counter with there quick players up front, I think they might have some success but Barca haven't really struggled against parked buses this season like they have in the past."
Barca,37yx47,HAL-9420,3,Sun May 31 18:26:05 2015 UTC,"Nice insight, I think Juve might park the bus, too. Check out my comment reply and let me know what you think."
Barca,37yx47,JurijFedorov,4,Sun May 31 18:44:01 2015 UTC,I'd guess Juve will use the Milan Pato tactic where they only have central attackers and now also a lot of long balls and high balls. That way they will only play 1 on 1 and hope that Pique or Mascherano will make a mistake. Not a great tactic but will amount to a few goals.
Barca,37yx47,HAL-9420,5,Sun May 31 23:59:39 2015 UTC,Let's just hope MaTS doesn't try to do a bit to much with the ball at his feet like he did during the copa del rey match because Tevez/Llorente/Morata > Inake Williams (sp?)
Barca,37yx47,shmenditt,5,Mon Jun 1 00:26:36 2015 UTC,Iñaki. But yea I dont think Marc will risk it like that again.
Barca,37yx47,HAL-9420,4,Mon Jun 1 01:55:26 2015 UTC,I think you're right. I'll bet Bravo had a word with him about that; possibly Lucho also. Either way he's gotten us this far in copa matches so I'm confident he won't take any chances when the treble is on the line.
Barca,37yx47,HAL-9420,6,Mon Jun 1 02:14:17 2015 UTC,"I completely agree about them switching to a 4-4-2 out of necessity to protect against our Holy Trident of Doom, though IMHO I thought they went more towards a 4-4-1-1; but that is neither here nor there.  What I saw in this game is that when Mathieu was not next to Pique, as a CB (I know Mathieu came in for Alba because he can also play LB) we didn't really have height in the box to defend crosses. For example we all know Aduriz is strong and tall (much like Llorente) and helped us out earlier by scoring an incredible bending header against puta Madrid (one of the few days I loved those Basque bastards). We also saw Aduriz won a few balls in the air because Pique was not on him.  What worries me about our UCL Final against Juve is that Llorente (Morata also, but he is a bit smaller) is a similar player (as I mentioned earlier) to Aduriz. I'm wondering what Lucho has got up his sleeve for our backline to prevent crosses being headed into goal.  Do we start Mathieu because of his height/ability to win headers? Do we go with Bartra who IMHO has a bit more defensive skill and awareness but is slightly smaller size wise? Do we stick with Masche because he reads the game so well?  Anyways, I didn't mean for this to turn in a massive wall of text or a UCL discussion; just my thoughts and would love to know what you guys think."
Barca,37yx47,egcg119,8,Sun May 31 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering what Lucho has got up his sleeve for our backline to prevent crosses being headed into goal.   How many times have we conceded from headers this season? Very rarely. Usually, Piqué ends up on the taller guy regardless, but Masch also holds his own very well.  I also don't remember Aduriz having any headers on goal in the final. He won some deeper in midfield, as hold-up play, but that's not particularly threatening. And the one header they scored off, Busquets was tracking Williams.  I think this is another case of delayed culer syndrome, concerns from past seasons that aren't really relevant to Luis Enrique's team. We've conceded very, very rarely off crosses and headers, and generally suffer more from small mobile forwards than big traditional no. 9s. We've played Dzeko, Ibra, Mandzukic, etc all in 2015 and none have been particularly dangerous.  Masch is the better defender and has earned his spot. He'll start."
Barca,37yx47,HAL-9420,2,Mon Jun 1 02:26:19 2015 UTC,"While I agree with almost everything you said (maybe I'm just anxious to win the treble again and am being overly critical of what I saw in our match) you'll remember one header that Aduriz won, on/inside the 6 yard box when Pique was not on him.  That header was not on goal but went just outside the far post and he (Aduriz) won the ball because of height/strength.   I'm not trying to get into an argument with you because we both bleed the same blood; I'm just weary of the fact that we know what Llorente can do with his frame and footballing intellect. Plus Morata is still, more or less, from Las putas and I'll bet he'd also love a chance at goal."
Barca,37yx47,egcg119,5,Mon Jun 1 03:06:50 2015 UTC,"I had a conversation with @euleri (a much smarter writer than I) on Twitter about Juventus' possible lineups, he pointed out that Juventus' 4-4-2 diamond is very narrow by nature, which would not suit them well against us. The shuttlers don't really go that wide, but instead look to dominate the middle. That's very different from how Simeone has trained Koke and Arda to play very wide and be comfortable on the touchline, for instance.  But if they cede the flanks to Messi/Alves and Neymar/Alba, they're going to have a rough time of it. He was wondering if Allegri might instead opt for a 3-5-2 - it may seem unorthodox to do three-back against a 4-3-3, but if they do it conservatively it's not going to be man-marking like Pep."
Barca,37yx47,kostkeon,9,Mon Jun 1 01:52:10 2015 UTC,"The first 20ish minutes had me worried because we were struggling to maintain control of the game and Athletic were doing a good job of pressuring high and cutting off passing lanes, but then Messi happened and it was all over from there. We had this moment during the game where we could've scored like 3 or 4 goals in a 10 minute span. Alves was immense once again, hopefully his form continues into the CL finals. Rakitic I thought was decent, but he was a major contributor behind the last 2 goals. Our front 3 are in their absolute prime right now and Juventus have much to fear for. Speaking of which, I really don't think Juventus will park the bus against us. They've only got one game to win it and parking the bus against a team who have tons of experience with parked buses isn't the brightest idea. My guess is that Juventus will press high and try to dominate the midfield in numbers. I remember their first leg against Real Madrid and I too was thinking that Juve will park the bus and catch them on the counter, but to my surprise Juve attacked tremendously well while defending solidly. If the rumour of Iniesta's injury is true, then I'd prefer to start Rafinha over Xavi, so we have a young, energetic midfielder to cope with the fast transition and pressure. Then for the last 25 minutes bring on Xavi to dictate the tempo and wear down the defenders. May the best team win the treble, VISCA BARCA!!!"
Barca,37yx47,pepetrillvia,5,Sun May 31 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"Messi is really incredible, he's always been this good but I think you really have to credit Lucho for managing to motivate Messi. You can really see the intensity that Messi is playing with in these last games, he's actively pressing and he seems like he's being more ambitious with his runs again. I feel like now you very rarely see him loitering anywhere on the field anymore; obviously his role in RW has a lot to do with the way he is now approaching his game, but I feel this is the hungriest I've ever seen Messi."

Barca,37yx47,abaasm,2,Mon Jun 1 01:07:23 2015 UTC,"I don't mind people using my name, but on reddit at least I think it's less confusing to just refer to usernames."
Barca,37yx47,Not_Tom_Brady,2,Mon Jun 1 01:17:01 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that everyone knew you.
Barca,37yx47,YoSoyMilkChocolate,4,Mon Jun 1 09:14:54 2015 UTC,Leo Messi's long balls across the field and over the top of the defense are one of the most impressive things I've ever seen.
Barca,37yx47,_sic,3,Mon Jun 1 11:49:19 2015 UTC,"I think we finally found the answer to the bus. It's the reverse field ball to the opposite wing that Alba and Messi consistently provide. Those two IMO are the two keys to breaking down Juventus' defensive setup, parked bus or not.  I can't believe that we're actually one match from the treble. I think this is actually the best Barcelona team we've ever seen, including the Guardiola days. I just pray that we'll get a victory in Berlin to cement that reputation."
Barca,37yx47,MSNFCBLove,3,Mon Jun 1 06:31:06 2015 UTC,"Against an actual bus (Athletic was not doing that) that option is hard to exploit because in a disciplined and determined block the defenders don't lose shape. A bus doesn't push forward ever, so that space Jordi runs into will be much smaller."
Barca,37znwu,Chunky_mono,26,Sun May 31 19:29:25 2015 UTC,"that's awfully specific, I mean which team other than us could possibly allow him to stay at Juve 1 more year"
Barca,37znwu,IhateAngryBirds,2,Sun May 31 20:47:20 2015 UTC,+1 to that.
Barca,37znwu,Football_Enthusiast,20,Mon Jun 1 04:44:23 2015 UTC,Lol he might as well have openly said Barca.
Barca,37znwu,cdn_brcafan,21,Sun May 31 20:58:36 2015 UTC,"I really want verratti man, more than pogba, more than gundogan"
Barca,37znwu,lionelmessi324,3,Sun May 31 22:37:49 2015 UTC,"Veratti and Pogba are both great. You know what you get with Marco. With Paul though, he adds a little more imagination, has a better shot, better in the air, and is stronger. Marco has what on Paul, a little better side to side passing? Can win back a few more balls?"
Barca,37znwu,efarfan,9,Mon Jun 1 18:32:39 2015 UTC,80m ? Please don't be 80m.
Barca,37znwu,Duke--Nukem,11,Sun May 31 21:16:34 2015 UTC,Sadly he probably will cost more than that.
Barca,37znwu,polechi33,3,Sun May 31 21:31:14 2015 UTC,"Probably?  There is an endless list of top teams after this kid. Remember, he is about the same age as Rafinha but with more upside and will bring more to the team today. Wouldn't be surprised if he cost us more than Suarez tbh."
Barca,37znwu,MayIHaveAHug,3,Mon Jun 1 03:16:54 2015 UTC,"You have a point, honestly I would prefer not to pay that much for him. But if he ends up been as good as it seems, I guess it is good business.  The only thing I would really have a problem with is if he really asked to be the second hightest payed player.  No way we should give him that."
Barca,37znwu,polechi33,3,Mon Jun 1 14:58:37 2015 UTC,"Even though Pogba might be really expensive, we have to remember he has a LOT of promise, and is already very good. Thinking beforehand if he is fit or not for Barcelona is not worth it (remember Suarez?). Also, sometimes it's not just about the player, but about the coach being able to make the best with what he has, and I think Lucho could do wonders with Pogba. So yeah, although I agree we shouldn't spend so much on a player when we have some La Masia talents to explore, I won't feel that bad if we do sign him.  But I must admit that reports like this make me worry a bit. I know it's most likely because he is young, but Ibra traumatized us a bit in the sense that personality can make or break a player in Barça.  Edit: I did some quick googling and very few reports are linking him to Barça, mostly to other clubs, so we shouldn't get to excited for the deal to go one way or the other, there's still a lot to come."
Barca,37znwu,iagolima,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:20:43 2015 UTC,"Does anyone here watch a lot of Juventus games? Is Pogba the kind of player who disappears for most of the game and creates one moment of magic, or can he help control the midfield and run throughout the game? I'm asking because I don't know. I don't want to just go off YouTube highlights and a few games. (I have watched quite a lot of PSG though to watch Verratti.)"
Barca,37znwu,iniestas,-1,Mon Jun 1 19:25:22 2015 UTC,"I hope we don't spend big again. I still think Suarez was too much. Neymar has ended up costing god knows how much. Valencia are still laughing from selling Mathieu. All brilliant signings but we are awful at negotiating.   Edit: First of all, I know each signing has been a huge success, I'm not denying that. I'm saying their transfer's could've been handled better. Also I'm just being picky, I mean we are 1/3 away from a treble!"
Barca,37znwu,BarcaAreTheBest,15,Sun May 31 21:24:13 2015 UTC,"Suarez price was just right, he's the best at his position. Neymar's price got retarded after the court stuff, otherwise it would have been fine too"
Barca,37znwu,IhateAngryBirds,2,Sun May 31 21:36:40 2015 UTC,"I thought Suarez would've been cheaper because of the WC incident. Liverpool wanted to get rid of him, his ban didn't help their cause, and he was being outlawed by the media. The Neymar stuff should never have happened in the first place. And before the downvotes hit, I LOVE SUAREZ AND NEYMAR, it's the barca's transfer negotiators I think should wise up."
Barca,37znwu,BarcaAreTheBest,2,Mon Jun 1 00:55:29 2015 UTC,"Liverpool did not want to get rid of him. Barca met his buyout clause for a reason.   If you recall, the whole Suarez to Barca saga was actually over a month long probably because Liverpool wanted to keep him."
Barca,37znwu,MayIHaveAHug,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:13:35 2015 UTC,"Good point, read up on it just now. My mistake."
Barca,37znwu,BarcaAreTheBest,15,Mon Jun 1 04:02:38 2015 UTC,"Getting them, even though we overpaid, was worth it. We are on the verge of a treble. And only god knows how good we can be next season."
Barca,37znwu,polechi33,4,Sun May 31 21:30:53 2015 UTC,"We do tend to overpay at times, remember Ibra? That had to be the worst deal of them all lol. But we also make good buys at decent prices (i.e. non-superstars). Where we are terrible at negotiating is when we sell players. In a market where players market price are grossly overinflated, we sure sell em cheap."
Barca,37znwu,cdn_brcafan,4,Sun May 31 23:49:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said.    Rakitic, ter Stegen, Bravo, all good prices and those are just this season.   The Fabregas transfer was confusing. We bought and sold him for roughly the same price... to Chelsea! The club that paid £50m for Torres."
Barca,380xm5,chandlerd23,3,Mon Jun 1 01:16:54 2015 UTC,"No one can say for sure until it happens, but it is pretty unlikely due to the reasons that you listed. I'm actually kind of shocked that anyone would say that they would absolutely, 100% for sure play the match. Like I said, nothing is certain.  As someone that will also be in attendance for that game, I can only hope that I am wrong and that all the all-star players will make an appearance! But I'm also not holding my breath.  Sorry I can't give a better answer, haha."
Barca,380xm5,athorpedo,2,Mon Jun 1 03:58:56 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt it. Messi is known not to play friendlies very often to get rest, and Neymar maybe. But with Cops America and Luis Enrique insistence on keeping his players fit all season long I doubt he would risk his star players for a meaningless game.  I expect them to field a starting lineup to prepare younger players and maybe do some tactical experiments. But anything is possible though, so who knows."
Barca,380xm5,mpinzon93,2,Mon Jun 1 05:55:54 2015 UTC,"if i was betting man, i would bet on them not playing... i will also hope they dont play as well..."
Barca,380xm5,rocksteadybebop,2,Mon Jun 1 13:08:13 2015 UTC,"This gets asked every year, and he never plays. If he does very rarely, but since the copa is nearby that is a definite no."

Barca,37yhal,Light_KraZe,22,Sun May 31 13:47:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they showed him icing that leg after the substitution. I hoped it was only a knock. Both Xavi and Rafinha will be a step down unless they pull off a wonder performance, something Xavi might still have in his back pocket. Probably we'll see both play but which one will start and when will the sub be made is a different question."
Barca,37yhal,vanNostrandby,23,Sun May 31 15:12:27 2015 UTC,Xavi vs Pirlo sounds exciting
Barca,37yhal,IhateAngryBirds,6,Sun May 31 16:20:55 2015 UTC,A worthy send-off.
Barca,37yhal,vanNostrandby,2,Sun May 31 16:26:05 2015 UTC,Watch Xavi score his final goal.
Barca,37yhal,TryHardJelly,39,Sun May 31 17:31:33 2015 UTC,Noooooo we need him :((
Barca,37yhal,Brompton_Cocktail,7,Sun May 31 14:03:10 2015 UTC,"Here we go again, just like with Suárez: he's injured/he's not really injured, he's playing/he's not-playing -- for the next 6 days. How can we know at this point if he'll be out for a match almost a week away? Football journalists have so little to write about in this part of the season the articles will be everywhere and say everything.  I am not sure my nerves can take it."
Barca,37yhal,survivalothefittest,17,Sun May 31 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"LE will shock Juve and play Douglas.  jokes aside, this is Rafa's great chance."
Barca,37yhal,passion4indiegames,18,Sun May 31 14:23:29 2015 UTC,Rafa over Xavi?
Barca,37yhal,okcomp,11,Sun May 31 14:31:24 2015 UTC,Xavi can't play 90 mins
Barca,37yhal,SanRedStudios,11,Sun May 31 15:24:44 2015 UTC,"Iniesta hasn't been playing 90 minutes in many matches either, he often comes off for Xavi. So it's nothing new to use a sub for that midfield position."
Barca,37yhal,hhbenaf,10,Sun May 31 15:34:00 2015 UTC,"If Xavi can't play 90 minutes then Rafinha will come on for him, not the other way around."
Barca,37yhal,Tezemery,5,Sun May 31 17:06:46 2015 UTC,"Other way around would be better I think, even though it won't happen. I think it's better having Xavi in the second part of the game rather than the first."
Barca,37yhal,Football_Enthusiast,5,Sun May 31 19:46:37 2015 UTC,"God forbid but if Iniesta really misses this match, then Rafinha Alcantara it is now your turn; please make us proud."
Barca,37yhal,darthvader7888,4,Sun May 31 17:36:15 2015 UTC,Fuck.   Xavi's gonna start if Iniesta doesn't. Hope he steps up for his last game.
Barca,37yhal,iagolima,3,Sun May 31 17:46:05 2015 UTC,"Rafinha, now's your time to shine man!"
Barca,37yhal,lonestar_10,3,Sun May 31 16:57:08 2015 UTC,"He has not been evaluated by the medical staff yet, so I'd still wait to hear."
Barca,37yhal,Not_Tom_Brady,5,Sun May 31 22:58:25 2015 UTC,"Hot damn, lucho playing mind games again! Now juve have to prepare for two scenarios. Brilliant."
Barca,37yhal,Morcule,2,Sun May 31 19:38:39 2015 UTC,"If he's out, which I doubt, it's obvious Xavi will start. He (Xavi) won't probarly last 90 minutes in his last Barcelona game, especially when this match is going to have some really high intensity with Juve's amazing midfield. I this tempo may prove a little too high for him, which can lead to two things when we are closing in on the 60th minute mark.  Lucho can take out Xavi for Rafinha, who will play a match bigger than he has ever played before, or he will do what I fear: Rakitic, Busquets and Mascherano in MF.   Double pivot has never worked out for us, and it has always lost us the control of every match it's been used. I hope he decides to give Rafinha his chance instead of this. But this is only a big if. Suárez was in doubt for the CdR-final, but he ended up playing well. I don't think this Iniesta situation will be any different."
Barca,37yhal,vanNostrandby,1 point,Sun May 31 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"I think Rakitic, Busi and Masche in midfield is as unlikely as Lucho using Pedro with the front three. Both possible solutions which Lucho has tried before but highly improbable."
Barca,37yhal,xscientist,2,Mon Jun 1 06:03:42 2015 UTC,Xavi/Rakitic was a contender for our best midfield pairing early in the season when Iniesta was off his game. I'm not worried. Rafinha is a fine player as well.
Barca,37yhal,frasier_crane,1 point,Sun May 31 23:23:30 2015 UTC,"Hopefully he'll be well enough to play, but Xavi is another great option, or even Rafinha, a more physical player to try to balance Pogba's strength."
Barca,37z773,Illegal_sal,29,Sun May 31 17:25:53 2015 UTC,"Yea I get what Lucho is saying but why should Ney be the one to ""understand""? Everyone should understand that teams are comprised of different players from different countries. Just because a Brazilian plays in Spain, doesn't mean that he has to change his style of play to please someone's pre-conceived feelings. Everyone is Spain should understand that soccer is soccer. Regardless of different styles of play. Styles not active sabotage. It's really a non issue and they should shut up and be better than complain and act out."
Barca,37z773,YO_putThatBagBackON,4,Sun May 31 20:15:05 2015 UTC,"The argument basically boils down to ""When in Rome""."
Barca,37z773,WillAlwaysLie,8,Sun May 31 22:56:23 2015 UTC,"The Asturian also had kind words for their rivals, Athletic: ""It's sad for me because they have deserved a title for a long time, but in the last few years they have come up against Barça and it's hard playing against a team like ours. They have once again shown that they deserve the cup""."
Barca,37z773,Not_Tom_Brady,24,Sun May 31 17:26:31 2015 UTC,"I wish lucho would have said something like: if the athletic player didn't want to get embarrassed, he should have played better defense."
Barca,37z773,Bowhayz,26,Sun May 31 19:37:17 2015 UTC,"Disagree with Lucho, but he is of course entitled to his opinion."
Barca,37z773,elanciano31,5,Sun May 31 18:19:33 2015 UTC,"The thing is he is correct though, the Spanish typically prefer more toned down play.  In Brazil it is just a way they express themselves on the pitch and it is appreciated, both there and in a lot of places.  Should Ney be clattered for it? No way, but it is still going to be a thing that gets brought up."
Barca,37z773,cdn_brcafan,16,Sun May 31 19:32:19 2015 UTC,Did these players forget Ronaldhino? Everyone loved him for his flair. Neymar shouldn't change his style just cause the defenders get embarrassed. As Lucho said the last time this came up when he defended Neymar: you can't take the Joga Bonito out of a Brazilian.
Barca,37z773,elanciano31,3,Sun May 31 20:33:59 2015 UTC,"i dont want neymar to change his style, I am jus pointing out that its a sentiment some will be vocal about"
Barca,37z773,cdn_brcafan,2,Sun May 31 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"In addition to being vocal they'll definitely be more aggressive on the pitch towards him. I just hope neymar can learn to keep his cool (i.e. not chase down the player and do a reckless tackle to earn himself a yellow), and that the ref penalizes aggression. Was shocked yesterday that the ref didn't give a single yellow to bilbao in that incident."
Barca,37z773,_sic,3,Sun May 31 23:35:04 2015 UTC,"In general people loved him, but I remember plenty of friends (here in Spain) criticizing him for trying to do a nutmeg every single time he had the ball. Another major difference is that Ronalidinho wasn't cocky like Neymar, he was just... happy."
Barca,37z773,philwelch,2,Mon Jun 1 13:06:39 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between flair and clowning on the other team when you're up 3-1 in a cup final. I like how Neymar is playing more cocky and more like he did at Santos, but that was unnecessary."
Barca,37z773,vanNostrandby,3,Mon Jun 1 02:26:35 2015 UTC,He plays like that no matter the score. And it's a good trick too when he pulls it off. The defender is left with two options: either foul Neymar or outpace him.
Barca,37z773,manniac,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:03:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think he is correct. In the same way that i haven't seen teams  stop playing on a 5-0 rout and measure their game not to score a 6th. Nor have i seen a lot of criticism for the ""humiliation"" of  doing nutmeg after nutmeg and scoring a goal."
Barca,37z773,elanciano31,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:37:06 2015 UTC,"i say he is correct because there does exist a sentiment in spain.  Does it make a ton of sense? nope, but some people feel certain ways about players expressing themselves on the pitch.  Like I said, I do not want neymar to change."
Barca,37z773,manniac,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:41:48 2015 UTC,"the sentiment seems to exist also in british football, and as you say it doesn't make a lot of sense; when you consider the other situations i outlined it makes even less sense, so lilttle it makes it a double standard.   i wonder if i should make this comment, coz it might be inflammatory, well... fuck it: i hope it isn't a racist issue. should it have been a basque rainbow flicking dani alves, would it have provoked the same reactions?"
Barca,37z773,JurijFedorov,4,Tue Jun 2 01:55:33 2015 UTC,So because there are more people with a wrong opinion Neymar should change his 100% legal playing style that wins us games?  Football is weird.
Barca,37z773,Ford_Imperfect,0,Sun May 31 23:49:02 2015 UTC,"You, and everyone with your opinion, are clearly missing the point entirely...no one wants him to not play with flair. Jeez you people just ignore the context of things and act condecending about it....asinine."
Barca,37z773,PerfectGentleman,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:35:59 2015 UTC,"I find that people who got offended at Neymar's trick are actually the ones belittling the Athletic players.  The trick was clearly done as a way to get past the oncoming defender and he was going towards goal. It's not like he was taunting the defender in the middle of the pitch with no good reason. It would be just like if Ronaldinho would try to use the Elastic at the edge of the rival area.  All of you cry of context, but keep ignoring that particular important piece of context.  If you think doing tricks toward goal in the dying minutes of a won game is disrespectful - wouldn't it be much more condescending if he's doing it at the start of the game? At least he thinks highly enough of the defenders to wait until the game is almost in his team's pocket to try it."
Barca,37z773,Ford_Imperfect,0,Mon Jun 1 15:52:52 2015 UTC,"No, while i entirely understand what you and every one are trying to say, That is not the point that the upset party is trying to make. Please dont get it twisted....i liked neymars move but people are just upset about it because they are old fashioned. Honestly this game is all about tradition history and and the sort so i get where the dissent is coming from. Its not about the flair or neymar or the rules... You grow up playing a fucking game and you know when its too much and what will upset people. Now you are welcome to say fuck your feelings but thats just how it is. I understand where the anger is coming from and i respect it. But i dont think its a big deal either at the same time...i just hate people like you coming and belittling it...yes we know neymar isnt the first footballer to do a trick move... Thats not the fucking point."
Barca,37z773,JurijFedorov,3,Mon Jun 1 18:49:19 2015 UTC,If people don't like a fresh exiting Brazilian style coming into Europe they should go back to 1950. Get with it already.
Barca,37z773,Ford_Imperfect,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:09:58 2015 UTC,Yea ok. Just trying to put perspective on it but yea you're right....
Barca,37z773,rocksteadybebop,4,Tue Jun 2 00:48:33 2015 UTC,I'm sure he's just being a nice guy about it. inside he was amazed.
Barca,37z773,maxverde,2,Sun May 31 20:46:49 2015 UTC,I still don't understand how that embarrassed them. It's not much worse than Messi dribbling through and slaughtering a defense with 10 minutes left on the clock. It's what they're being paid for...
Barca,37z773,_sic,3,Mon Jun 1 00:40:04 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right and it's good that Lucho and Piqué let him know that it's not just a few angry defenders who think that way.  Like I said elsewhere, the cultures that have arisen around football in different countries,  different parts of countries, or even specific clubs varies a great deal. In Brazil what Neymar did is completely normal, even given the game situation, but in Spain and parts of Europe it is not considered good sportsmanship to try a fancy flick like that in a match that is pretty much decided and that's why Atleti and Athletic defenders got angry at him. This is not to say that the way they reacted wasn't pathetic (I'm particularly disappointed in Iarola's reaction after what was the last match of his career), but I can understand why they were angry. How people in other countries feel about the situation is really beside the point, Neymar is playing in La Liga and will be held accountable to the social mores of this footballing culture.  At some point Neymar has to understand that he's playing in Spain and that if he's going to do that kind of thing the referee will not protect him from retaliation, because the referees are put off by it as well (even his teammates are a bit slow to defend him in those situations). In other words, while it's good that he has big balls and refuses to be cowed by violent defenders, he should just be smart and pick and choose the right time to do such tricks. For instance, Djalminha once pulled off a crazy sombrero vs. RM that had the entire country worshiping at his feet for weeks, but that was in the first few minutes of a match between Depor and RM, not at the end of a decided match.   Nuances are important."
Barca,37z773,_sic,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:28:06 2015 UTC,"The football pitch is a canvas. It should be free from censorship    It's not about censorship, it's about being smart. It might appear to you like he's winning some kind of psychological war, but your opinion might change if  some player breaks his ankle like Andoni Goikoetxea did to Maradona. Referees will not protect him if he is perceived as a player who shows up the opposition. This is far more important than many seem to realize. Eventually somebody will intentionally injure him.    The lack of professionalism and lapse in concentration is what Spain should be offended by, not the silly notion that it's offensive to do it using the ball, but perfectly ok when using words.   Like I said, the opinion of people outside the culture is beside the point, the culture is what it is and Neymar is playing in La Liga."
Barca,37z773,_sic,3,Mon Jun 1 14:13:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think you're idealizing Neymar as an ""artist"" too much, it's not just the tricks at the end of matches that pisses off the defenders, he's also extremely cocky on the pitch and talks a lot of shit throughout matches and makes ugly gestures to away crowds on occasion, much like Diego Costa or Cristiano Ronaldo. We've seen it many times this season (in fact the atléticos that I know IRL compare him to the Portuguese player in terms of being an asshole - I don't agree, but hey, I'm biased).   Now I've been pleasantly surprised that he doesn't back down from aggressive players, that's a huge plus. But on the other hand, I get the feeling he often goes looking to start shit and builds up  animosity during matches and that's why I think he gets so much more hate from opponents than somebody like Ronaldinho who was just as ""artistic"" (if that's what you want to call it) as Neymar or more. Psychological warfare? I guess. Effective? Perhaps. Necessary and worth the risk? That's a tougher call. I mean, I used to love Stoichkov for being a prick,  but I sometimes think that Hristo could back up his attitude more than Neymar can. I guess it boils down to this: I worry that players kneeing him in the spine is not going to be a one off thing in his career..."
Barca,37z773,vizious29,2,Mon Jun 1 14:33:27 2015 UTC,"The Athletic players got upset because they were loosing, when you're frustrated and loosing, very little is needed for an excuse to get mad. No need to get their panties in a bunch."
Barca,37z773,Polemicize,2,Mon Jun 1 15:56:16 2015 UTC,"That's absolutely ridiculous. Aside from actions which violate the rules of the sport, anything goes, and should go without immature retaliation from the opposition. What Enrique is saying and what the Athletic brats communicated is essentially ""change your playstyle and your effective skills to accommodate for the cultural norms and expectations of tradition"". Sorry, that won't fly in the modern world, and I hope Neymar does nothing to alter his style or flair like Enrique suggests."

Barca,37ymfx,Football_Enthusiast,3,Sun May 31 14:36:29 2015 UTC,Messi - tormenting defenders since he could walk. He ran his heart out that match and gave that perfect pass for iniesta's goal. I would love to get a hold of Messi 30 and Iniesta 24 jerseys...
Barca,37ymfx,cdn_brcafan,5,Sun May 31 15:38:10 2015 UTC,"I remember watching him play for Barça back in '06/'07, I thought he is just another Argentinian wonder kid who they named the 'New Maradona' will shine for a while until there is a new prodigy from his country shows up. Look how things have changed since then, now football fans love to name their promising talents 'The [insert name of a country/geographical region] Messi' (i.e. Swiss people call Xherdan Shaqiri 'Alpine Messi', Beckenbauer once called Götze 'The new Lionel Messi' etc.).   Back then I didn't realize that Messi would be so good one day that he is going to be considered as one of the best footballers of all time. He literally redefined the art of football whose split second brilliance can change the direction of the match in favor of the team he plays for, my goodness what an extra-ordinary talent he is. Thanks to the almighty that Messi plays for Barça. I hope Messi will play a vital role to make Barça victorious against Juventus in this UCL final alongside his two companions of Barça's famous offensive force."

Barca,37xz9y,vanNostrandby,3,Sun May 31 11:42:54 2015 UTC,I think he'll be fighting with Rakitic for that RCM-role.
Barca,37xz9y,Morcule,-3,Sun May 31 18:50:20 2015 UTC,"Iniesta hasn't done such a great season, imho. If we compare his numbers with Rakitic's, his partner in the midfield, we'll see that while Iniesta scored 0 goals and assisted one, Rakitic scored 5 and assisted 7. Even Xavi has better numbers with 2 goals and 8 assisted. I love Iniesta and he has been a key part of the greatest Barça ever (and the Spanish national team, too), but age just got him. I think he should be next season's Xavi and start from the bench, while Rakitic and hopefully Verratti play from the beginning."
Barca,37xz9y,frasier_crane,3,Sun May 31 17:58:37 2015 UTC,"That's because Iniesta has been given a totally different role from what he has ever had before. Now he must cover, run and defend much more, while he used to be very centrally and attack minded. Also Messi at RW instead of F9 has effected this, because now, even with Suárez, there's less options for him to pass and combine with, and he's limited to Neymar, Alba and maybe Busquets."
Barca,37xz9y,Morcule,1 point,Sun May 31 18:52:57 2015 UTC,You got it. He is the one who has sacrified for us this season.
Barca,37xz9y,polechi33,1 point,Sun May 31 21:35:53 2015 UTC,"Then maybe Iniesta's time has passed if another player would suit better to Luis Enrique's tactical demands. Iniesta has never been good defending nor finishing the plays, because his role was to serve as a link between the midfield and the attack and Messi and/or Rakitic are now doing that. I wonder if a player like Verratti who is more capable defending than he is (and younger) should be Barça's next signing, or even Pogba, who is physically a monster would be better in this new role. He is not a kid anymore and Barça needs to start looking for a young lad capable of replacing him."
Barca,37xz9y,frasier_crane,12,Sun May 31 19:10:24 2015 UTC,"""We are holding talks yes, but no decision has been made. I can't say more than that on this,"" That's all so he can pretty much talk with anybody."
Barca,37xz9y,grubykoxu12,-4,Sun May 31 09:57:55 2015 UTC,"Barça clearly needs a replacement for Iniesta, a creative midfielder, so Gundogan would be a great signing, although I'd rather sign PSG's Marco Verratti."
Barca,37xz9y,frasier_crane,1 point,Sun May 31 17:44:46 2015 UTC,Did you mean Xavi?
Barca,37xz9y,polechi33,0,Sun May 31 21:33:37 2015 UTC,"Iniesta has been doing the most similar to what Xavi did. This season Iniesta has played with Rakitic by his side, but the Croatian is more of a box to box player while Iniesta has played more static. But this job is not what Iniesta does best, so I think a player like Gundogan or even better Verratti would fit best here."

Barca,37x4xr,WillAlwaysLie,8,Sun May 31 03:55:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to disagree, but most Spanish commentators PLAIN SUCK (with the honorable exception of Alfredo Martinez): They are joking and/or talking nonsense during 85% of the match instead of focusing on the game. If you listen to the first three narrations, you'll see they are not commenting Messi's play until he's in the box, when he has already dribbled 3 players. It is also not unusual for them not to tell what the score is for like 20 minutes, so you are listening a match and you don't have a clue of what the score is unless you've been listening from the very beginning.  On the other hand, Argentine commentators (and Alfredo Martinez) will put you in the game, with a fast-paced narration that is a bit more ""overloaded"" with information, but I don't think it's a bad thing. You can get a much better idea of what's happening on the pitch even if you are not watching the game.  If I'm listening to a match on the radio I want to know what's happening during the full match, not to listen to something akin to a bar conversation (fuck Los Manolos!!) until something extraordinary happens."

But we are talking about Neymar, 1v1, trying to get into the opposing area. It is his style of play: from the first minute, to the last, he does little flicks, and dances on the ball, and heel flicks, and such.   Bilbao player's should know Neymar's style by now. I am fairly certain he would have done it in the first minute, if he thought that he could get away with it.  Sidenote: it was a foul by the Bilbao player, and several of them deserved yellows for later revenge kicks. Ridiculous loss of control by the ref there."

Barca,37w6c5,Tropicum,9,Sun May 31 12:27:17 2015 UTC,"Not to mention Neymar grew up playing a lot of street soccer, and you can already tell he is a very flashy player, whether he's losing 10-0 or winning 1-0, he's going to want to do this, and there is nothing wrong.

Barca,37w6c5,xFragg,7,Sun May 31 00:26:25 2015 UTC,"True. I see some people on /r/soccer saying ""obviously this guy defending neymar hasnt played in a sunday game or only plays fifa"" , thats stupid.  You are comparing yourself, that plays football for fun to defenders who train their whole life, who get paid to keep an attacker from scoring while avoiding a yellow/red card.  Neymar did the right thing, whether he was trying to get foward to score or he was just showing off, the defenders did the wrong thing and embarassed themselves.  And some /r/soccer posts saying ""there was no need to do this as its humiliating, they were already losing 3-1 and it was close to full time""....do these guys watch real madrid matches? Madrid always try to add goals even if they lead by 3-0, why dont people complain? and where were these people when ronaldinho was embarrassing defenders like this, but more often?  Arsenal won 4-0 around that same time, if sanchez did a nutmeg towards their goal at the dying minute would people react the same way?  Dribbling is part of sports, if bilbao defenders cant handle humiliation thats their problem."

Most of his yellow cards have come from stuff like that.    But this is a totally valid play, on a game that could have become closer than it already was at 3-1.   Also, I think that this time Neymar probably knew that Athletic defenders would lose their shit, which in turn would help cool things down for Barça's defense."

If I was Neymar and I was thinking the best way to get past you is doing a fucking rainbow flick, I would do it 10 times out of 10 no matter the score or occasion.  You don't like it? Then get the ball of me and continue, I don't see why I would have to change my style of play to suit yours, that's just retarded."

Barca,37w6c5,zizzor23,17,Sun May 31 05:33:27 2015 UTC,People at soccer are calling Neymar a jerk for it. I honestly can't see what he did wrong.
Barca,37w6c5,JurijFedorov,11,Sun May 31 00:16:53 2015 UTC,"He wears a shirt with a Qatar ad on it, he must be Hitler. Nah but seriously they were talking about how it's cunty to do it... But not cunty to want to fight a 23 year old for having fun. Ok. Great logic. Neymar didn't do anything wrong. He did the same thing to James in the Clasico and I believe the score was 0-0 or 1-0. I swear then they want to pull the Ronaldo card. I'd clap the shit outta Ronaldo if he did that. That's not cunty. Celebrating your 5th goal against Granada as if you won the World Cup..."
Barca,37w6c5,xFragg,3,Sun May 31 00:23:48 2015 UTC,"Well it's not ""cunty"" to celebrate a 5th goal. How many times does anyone score 5 goals in a game?"
Barca,37w6c5,fmn13,9,Sun May 31 00:34:25 2015 UTC,If you're beating a team already by 5... When they're lower mid table.. celebrating a 5th is pretty unsportsmanlike. I understand hugging with your teammates but Ronaldo's celebration is a little over the edge. But I see what you're saying.

Barca,37w6c5,invalidwat,16,Sun May 31 14:23:19 2015 UTC,I wish Lucho backed Neymar instead of saying that he shouldn't showboat in Spain.
Barca,37w6c5,Seffor,3,Sun May 31 01:46:33 2015 UTC,The odd part is that this happened once before and Lucho did come out and back him. I believe he said something along the lines of if you take the joga out of a Brazilian he is no longer a brazilian. Don't recall the exact quote. Not sure why he didn't back him this time..
Barca,37w6c5,cdn_brcafan,1 point,Sun May 31 07:09:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I understand the point though. Ney's flick was untimely, from certain point of view, that made him showboat. The team was on the verge of winning the game, so yeah, MAYBE just MAYBE, Bilbao saw it as an attempt to humiliate, not to get through the defender. But it's his style, so it's not a showboat in a way."
Barca,37w6c5,whathappenstome,5,Sun May 31 02:01:36 2015 UTC,Regardless I would have liked to see him support his players.
Barca,37w6c5,Seffor,0,Sun May 31 02:20:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I wish he hasn't as well as we ran out of subs and neymar was walking a very fine line."
Barca,37w6c5,vooglie,7,Sun May 31 05:00:06 2015 UTC,I didn't know you could get sent off for a rainbow flick.
Barca,37w6c5,fpvmtimbdbo,3,Sun May 31 09:27:35 2015 UTC,I was meaning more attracting injury causing foul
Barca,37w6c5,vooglie,3,Sun May 31 11:26:22 2015 UTC,"The only problem I have with the flick is his ""style"" seems to be more about holding the ball too much in the attacking half and giving up the ball to regularly.  The flick is a corollary of that style.  So, in my mind, it's not about him trying to get past the defender in that situation, moreover I see the lack of moving the ball upfield, as opposed to try and dribble past everyone, as the real problem."
Barca,37w6c5,cdrawesome,3,Sun May 31 01:18:55 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear that entertaining is how Neymar understands football and I can't reproach him for staying true to his Brazilian roots (people forget that Ronaldinho also tried to nutmeg players pretty much every time he touched the ball). I also think what he did was not so extreme as to warrant the entire Athletic team reacting that way.   That said, if Neymar is an intelligent player he will learn to read match situations better. First off, in Spain, especially some parts of Spain, football ""etiquette"" (for lack of a better word) is understood very differently than it is in Brazil. Athletic in particular is a team that has a history of playing no-nonsense, extremely physical football (some would say dirty), and their fans love hard working, humble team-oriented players, only recently have their teams featured highly skilled players like Herrera, Muniain, etc. What I mean is that the club and its fans understand football in more of an English way. I'm not saying that Neymar shouldn't play with Brazilian flair, but with what I just said in mind, if a team is frustrated during a match and waiting for an excuse to be provoked why give it to them? Eventually some asshole is going to injure Ney like they did Maradona. Sure, the guy who did it will be in the wrong, but not much good being right will do Neymar if he's out injured for a season..."
Barca,37w6c5,_sic,7,Sun May 31 09:03:45 2015 UTC,"Stop calling people at /r/soccer butthurt, theres a huge amount of them defending him while some antis are butthurt. The issue is that Luis Enrique and Pique came out and said he shouldn't have done it, especially Luis Enrique's comments. If i was Neymar I sure wouldn't feel happy about my own teammate and coach not backing me. Its a game be artistic with it not fucking mechanical, thats when it gets boring."

Barca,37w6c5,TweetPoster,2,Sat May 30 22:18:53 2015 UTC,"The only thing that was a ""problem"" was the completely absurd loss of control in that game by that disgustingly horrible referee. Was he high? Did someone pay him? After all the Bilbao players got in Neymar's face (after fouling him), flicked his ear or whatever they were doing, the referee did nothing. And then from then on out, they all fouled the shit out of Neymar and the referee just didn't want to give second yellows to anyone. He easily could have gotten hurt."
Barca,37w6c5,harloss,2,Sun May 31 03:59:47 2015 UTC,"During that incident, the ref lost total control.  Because he only cautioned one player, Neymar thought he wasn't being protected so immediately went and fouled someone hard for a bit of revenge.  Then he got fouled hard.  Then Busquets went crazy and it was just breaking down all over the place.  All because the ref was soft.  Have some balls man."

Football is (or at least I see it as) shape, meaning the way it's done; magic and tricks meaning more than the score. I want to see Neymar and Messi because they make football beautiful, not Ronaldo for example because he may score 60 goals per season, but there's nothing beyond those numbers: no magic, no fun. Football itself is Messi and Neymar's moves, and how frigging beautiful they do it!"

I fully understand why Bilbao got mad.  If you play on the winning side and your teammate does that, it's... hilarious and such a diss."
Barca,37xrcy,MSNFCBLove,13,Sun May 31 07:39:21 2015 UTC,"Luis Enrique has been to Italy managing As Roma for one season. I think he has at least some idea or strategy regarding playing against the Italian clubs but however Roma didn't do very well under his management but it was his first season in Italy. Of course he is now managing a far better team so it should be slightly easier for him to formulate an effective strategy to face the Italian champion this time.  I don't follow Serie A but Juventus advanced to the final defeating RM in the semi-finals which is by no means an easy task. It is true that they were a bit lucky in the second leg and on paper RM were better than the Juve but in football stats and records aren't the only thing that determines the result of the match. Italians have always been unpredictable in football (I know we are talking about a club but still they represent Italian football).   Juventus advanced to the semi-final by a close victory against Monaco and look how they survived their battles against Real. What I've noticed in their playing is they got some decent players who can make things tough for the rivals. I quite liked Vidal, Morata, Marchisio, Chiellini. Tevez and Lichtsteiner looked fine as well and they got some veteran players like Pirlo, Buffon who can be troublesome in the match. I think the key to defeat Juventus would be to score at least two goals within the first half and Barça need to make their defense really solid so that Juves can't get past our defense. I hope our offense is strong enough to pierce the Juventus defense and score couple of goals.  I'm hopeful that Barça will win the '14-'15 UCL."
Barca,37xrcy,Football_Enthusiast,8,Sun May 31 08:07:25 2015 UTC,"Could not have said it better myself man. However, Ancelotti never changed up Real Madrid's game plan at all in 2015, teams were figuring them out very easily. I feel like Juventus weren't that great, they had a lot of wasted opportunities, but only because Madrid's defence wasn't great, especially with Ramos in DM.   Juve play a style of football that can be compared to Atletico to an extent. They love to go hard, flock the midfield and play their own game no matter who they verse.  For me this is a midfield battle, they have arguably some of the best midfield players in their team that can change a game on their own, so we have to watch out for that.   Possession won't be a thing in this game, maybe 60-40 for Barca, I see this being a very exiting end to end game where there will be a couple of goals. I predict a 2-0 or 3-1 for Barca.  Suarez is the key to this match for Barcelona though. He is going to get a lot of chances, if Juve try to play like Bayern did with the man marking, Suarez is going to walk all over them.  And with lichtensteiner on the right against Neymar, that's a pretty simple matchup for Neymar tbh, lichtensteiner likes to track forward, but is slow to get back from what I've seen, so let's hope Neymar has his passing and shooting boots on.  Messi for me might drop back a bit and play a right midfield kind of role, and become an inside forward at some times like he usually does.   All in all I'm exited to see how things go!"
Barca,37xrcy,Football_Enthusiast,10,Sun May 31 08:35:38 2015 UTC,"In the second leg at Bernabeu I felt at one point that Bale wouldn't stop until he scores one but Juventus were lucky that RM didn't score any after that penalty otherwise RM would have easily won the match. Juventus really had hard time playing against Real but at in the end fortune is also needed to win a match.  Midfield battle might be intense in this game and also I'm hoping that Juventus will have really tough time dealing with our offense. Suarez should score at least one this time, hopefully Neymar will shine in such a big match like UCL final and I think Messi might play his cold assassin style game again; I mean just a moment of his brilliance can get the match in favor of Barça so I think Juventus are having tough time figuring out how to stop our offensive force.  I'm pretty sure Suarez and Neymar are both quite exited to play this UCL final as they've never been to such a big stage so undoubtedly they will try their level best to play their best game. Hopefully Barça will triumph in the final."
Barca,37xrcy,SkintCrayon,2,Sun May 31 09:03:54 2015 UTC,I had the same feeling about Bale. In the end he just couldn't deliver a proper finishing
Barca,37xrcy,cdn_brcafan,3,Sun May 31 10:36:57 2015 UTC,"Man was he close though. That 2nd leg was so nerve wrecking, seeing madrid launch attack after attack."
Barca,37xrcy,vanNostrandby,5,Sun May 31 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"Over a two legged tie, I'd be confident in a Barça win. Only 90 minutes means that luck, mistakes and moments of brilliance count for so much more. If Juve score first and relatively late, I can see them winning 2-1 (with a late header from Pique after conceding due to chasing the goal). If Barça score first, they honestly should be able to take it from there. It should be relatively easy to control the game after scoring since Juve can't really press up that high due to the three amigos and long passes to them.  I'm kinda glad Suarez didn't get a goal yesterday, he'll really be looking to score one in the final. Ter Stegen however looked a bit shaky and I think his distribution will prove to be a very important factor in the clash."
Barca,37xrcy,Football_Enthusiast,6,Sun May 31 08:19:29 2015 UTC,"Barça must score at least two as early as possible to avoid any last minute risk. Suarez hasn't been scoring any since the quarter-finals stage but I'm hopeful that he will score in the final. ter Stegen did look a bit shaky in the CDR final but it was his first final match in his professional career I think, so it is normal to be a bit nervous but I think now that he knows how does it feel to play a final thus hopefully he will be more confident playing his next final which is UCL '14-'15.   I seriously believe that ter Stegen is a really good signing for us, he has real talent to reach his maximum potential to be one of the top three GKs of the world. I really hope he will do great at Barça in the coming seasons. And yes his ball distribution will be really crucial for us. In our match against Bayern in the first leg of this season's UCL, around 10-15 minutes Suarez got a one vs one chance that was initiated from ter Stegen's goal kick following Messi's header that directed the ball to Suarez, this kind of reminds me Klose's goal against England in WC '10. I'm hopeful that Barça will be able to score something similar to this with Stegen's superb distribution ability and our offensive agility and precision.  Defeating the Juves won't be that easy but I really hope that Barça are going to win the treble in Berlin this June."

Barca,37xrcy,Duke--Nukem,10,Sun May 31 16:43:08 2015 UTC,"Against Juventus, we should be very careful not to concede first. We aren't used to it now. And against their defense, it'll be very hard. The game needs to stay open, we need to score first.   If Pirlo plays as shit as he did against RM away, we'll be fine.   I am more worried of Tevez and Morata. The Argentinian is a workhorse and the little ex RM cunt is great in build up play and finishing.   To the treble! Visca Barca!"
Barca,37xrcy,Football_Enthusiast,4,Sun May 31 12:35:10 2015 UTC,"Against Juventus, we should be very careful not to concede first.   This is really important. I hope Barça will pierce Juventus defense and will score the first two goals of the match and afterwards Barça can have good control of the game.  Both Tevez and Morata are in form so we need to be extra careful about them. Although I haven't watched anything significant in Pogba's playing as of yet which probably is due to his recent injury but we need to keep an eye on him too. I can't say anything about Pirlo as of yet, his downhill performance is probably due to his age which I think won't get better anytime soon.   But nevertheless Barça shouldn't leave Pirlo any space and also successfully neutralizing Vidal and Marchisio will be helpful for barça because Barça dominating the midfield means it will cut off feeding the ball for Juve attack thus they will have to try harder to get the ball near to the d-box."

Barca,37vyrn,InAnIndianAccent,61,Sun May 31 01:30:39 2015 UTC,"Not sure the ""MOTMOTM"" rule still applies... It's obvious Messi is no mere man.  Personally I think good on Neymar for having a bit of guile at the end, poor reaction from that Athletic player to it though. Did descend in to a bit too much of a raged end though, unfortunately for the memory of the game.  On for the treble, with no injuries before the tough test in a weeks's time. I thought we controlled the game less after Xavi came on, but you could tell that thoughts were turning to the Juve clash.  Visca Barça!"
Barca,37vyrn,robc95,16,Sat May 30 21:21:02 2015 UTC,"I see nothing wrong with what Neymar did, he thought he could pull it off and he went for it.   On the other hand, the reaction from the Athletic players was a tad bit stupid, but hey I'll give them the whole ""heat of the moment"" benefit of doubt. But they went on and on until it turned into a complete rage fest. The ref was either half blind or wasn't doing his job proper.   Big respect to Neymar for getting up and just walking off. Zero reaction to the whole episode.   All in all, a match well played and a job well done. 2 down, 1 to go. On to Berlin, let's bring the missing piece of the treble home."
Barca,37vyrn,Deep_In_Thought,4,Sat May 30 21:43:53 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean about Neymar walking off and having zero reaction, I agree with you about his reaction being good just walking away, but he did then sprint to the other side of the pitch and make a rash foul, so I can't say he did nothing."
Barca,37vyrn,robc95,23,Sat May 30 22:22:50 2015 UTC,All the pushing and fouls and Busi gets a card. Dumb ref.
Barca,37vyrn,pureeviljester,20,Sat May 30 21:27:38 2015 UTC,Seriously. Did he not see Mikel San Jose going crazy at Neymar for nothing?
Barca,37vyrn,isleepinmathclass,17,Sat May 30 21:29:53 2015 UTC,Yeah agreed. San Jose's reaction was appalling and deserved a yellow.  However Busi was foolish to get a yellow. Piqué showed a good bit of leadership in calming him down and getting him away to be fair!
Barca,37vyrn,angelo994,4,Sat May 30 21:57:59 2015 UTC,Busi did overreat pretty hard. Still others should also have gotten yellows.
Barca,37vyrn,auryn0151,54,Sat May 30 23:30:31 2015 UTC,Neymars showboating at the end was glorious!

Barca,37vyrn,SoupBowl69,57,Sat May 30 23:47:13 2015 UTC,Messi scores winning goal of La Liga.  Messi scores two goals in Copa del Ray Rey final.   Worlds best player no doubt !
Barca,37vyrn,1-800-FunkMaster,29,Sat May 30 21:23:33 2015 UTC,And the Champions League final next week... If you know what I mean ;)
Barca,37vyrn,TextBasedCat,46,Sat May 30 21:29:22 2015 UTC,"I had a guy today tell me that Ronaldo was better than Messi this season. When I asked him why, he said: (I swear this is true), ""Ronaldo: 48 league goals, Messi: 43 league goals, therefore Ronaldo is better than Messi"".  And I said, ""Good point"".  There is no point arguing any more. If people think Messi is not the best in the world, they are either stupid, or deluded, or angry, and none of those things can be solved.  Messi is the best. Everyone who has a shred of sanity knows that."

Barca,37vyrn,_FRANKENSTEIN_,-14,Sun May 31 11:47:37 2015 UTC,its highly subjective because they are such different types of players.
Barca,37vyrn,mekane84,21,Sat May 30 22:00:42 2015 UTC,Not even remotely subjective
Barca,37vyrn,vooglie,-20,Sat May 30 22:20:59 2015 UTC,"you probably don't even realize it then.  Messi is a great dribbler in tight spaces, he has a lot of highlight reel goals because of this.  Cristiano is a better decision maker, makes fewere turnovers, is better in the air, and a more clinical finisher.  its not as eye opening or exciting, but he's just as effective as Messi in games that are less open with tight defending.  messi is unbeatable in an open game though."
Barca,37vyrn,mekane84,11,Sat May 30 23:10:53 2015 UTC,"What leads you to the assumption that Cristiano is a ""better decision maker""?  I'm biased as a barca fan, but seriously, you're deluded if you truly believe this..."
Barca,37vyrn,scoobysam,14,Sat May 30 23:21:23 2015 UTC,"Cristiano better decision maker, fewer turnovers and more clinical? Bullshit. He's better in the air, and that's it.  http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lionel-messi-is-impossible/ this shows how much better Messi statistically is. That doesn't even count the magic Messi produces on the pitch."
Barca,37vyrn,vooglie,6,Sat May 30 23:13:08 2015 UTC,"Cristiano Ronaldo is a poacher. He's a damn good one too. Messi is also a clinical finisher, but when he drops deep into midfield he becomes a Pirlo-esque playmaker. Even without his dribbling abilities he is a fantastic player. Take away Cristiano's finishing and physicality and you're left with a male model."
Barca,37vyrn,philwelch,2,Sun May 31 08:06:11 2015 UTC,"Clinical finisher? When Messi's role was to bang in goals left and right he scored 96 goals in a calender year, 70 in a season. Madrid fans like to talk about how Ronaldo's positioning is way better because he scores alot of tap ins, but when messi broke that record, he scored dozens of tap ins as well. Messi is 5'7"" and has the second most headers in Europe, for me, that alone speaks volumes about his attacking positioning. I dont want to bring up the whole PK argument because it gets childish sometimes, but jesus if you dont think Ronaldo's goal talley is a bit inflated because of them then you're delusional. Messi has already showed he can score goals with his eyes closed, and its astonishing that he can keep up with Ronaldo's numbers even from a much more playmaker and defensive role than he's had in years.   Decision maker? If by decision making you mean deciding to disappear when his team needs him the most yeah, that man is a genius. Your argument is that Messi loses the ball more (i dont know the actual stats but i'll take your word for it) but when Messi is involved in every single aspect of Barca's attack and has the ability to take players on more often and thread more passes then of course he'll lose the ball more, but for every one time he loses the ball he creates 3 goal-scoring chances, this is why people have been saying the distance between Messi's quality of play and Ronaldo's quality of play is so huge despite Ronaldo having a few more goals, what they are able to contribute to their team is incomparable.  Ronaldo IS much better in the air. He has a monstrous leap and is truly an athletic phenomenon. I think he is the most dangerous player in the world in the air by quite the distance. No argument from me.  That said, I think Messi is such a master of all trades, people are trying to desperately grab at things that Ronaldo may SEEM better at so that the debate can seem much closer than it actually is, Messi has proved his goal scoring ability just as much if not more than Ronaldo, he has proved that he is a genius at getting himself into the right places to score and create just as much if not more than Ronaldo, and he has proven that he can do all this and stack on all the dribbling, creativity, defensive contribution, control of the game and overall ""highlight reel"" capabilities on top of his game MILES better than Ronaldo.  Basically, Messi has shown that he can play Ronaldo's current role even better than Ronaldo can, barring being that insane ariel threat that Ronaldo provides. But since he can do so much more than that for his team and is currently doing so, i think people forget that Messi has already ""been there done that"" with what Ronaldo has done in the last two seasons.  Think of it like this, Ronaldo has beautiful shiny blue and green diamonds on display, Messi has those same diamonds on display, but they are sitting behind his sparkling rainbow diamonds. People who want blue and green diamonds can still go to Messi's shop because he has them too, but they may forget that he has them since its his rainbow diamond stealing the show, so they try to tell you that Ronaldo has the better green and blue diamonds when it probably isn't even true"
Barca,37vyrn,DivineVibrations,9,Sun May 31 18:16:52 2015 UTC,"This is ludcrious. First of all, it's not impossible to compare players that play different positions. Messi is better than Rakitic, even though Messi doesn't play CM.  Second of all, they both are very similar types of players. They're goalscorers and creators. They don't have much defensive duty.  You can't watch what Messi has done to Bayern, Atletico and now Bilbao this month and not say he's better than Ronaldo. It's not just about goalscoring numbers. As I heard it put today - the best players don't go on and score the 5th goal when you're winning 4-0. They score the goals that matter."

Barca,37vyrn,AdviceDanimals,12,Sat May 30 21:23:23 2015 UTC,"The good: We won another trophy, and are on our way to the UCL final in hopes of a treble. The way the team played the first half, we'd crush anyone. Holy shit, Messi. One of his best of all time.  The bad: The refereeing, my god, the refereeing! I was legitimately concerned someone would get hurt. The number of yellow card fouls on Barca players that just went unpunished, for me, is worth a fucking serious punishment for that referee. I mean, disgusting referee. I even had a friend of mine who doens't particularly like Barca watching with me say the same. It was absurd.   My blood boiled over when Neymar tried the flick, and got shoved down, and then all the Bilbao players came over and started grabbing at him, flicking his ear/face or whatever the fuck they were doing, and getting in his face, they looked like a bunch of hooligans from a ghetto. Then... The referee..... Did nothing.  Lastly, I think we should be at least slightly concerned that the tempo seems to drop when we go ahead. Yes, I know, maybe the players were thinking about the UCL final up ahead, and we were winning 2-0, but the tempo definitely dropped, and it's the same thing against Bayern, and the same thing against several other teams all season. I hope if we go up on Juve (which I think we will), that we will bury them early."
Barca,37vyrn,harloss,6,Sat May 30 21:48:49 2015 UTC,That we had the full squad healthy at this point in the tournament is probably a result of turning down the tempo when the game is won. The one time it failed though was against Sevilla.

Personally, I like it every time Neymar frustrates the hell out of opposing defenses and piss them off like this. It may have been a little over the top, but oh well. It didn't work.   Xavi was such a great sub to bring on into this game. It's such a tribute to his career that his last three matches with us are all finals with the potential for him to add an additional trophy to his already illustrious career. That being said, with the #6 shirt being open next year, who takes it? Would Iniesta move over and take it over but then that leaves the 8 and who would be deserving of that?"
Barca,37vyrn,zizzor23,4,Sat May 30 21:53:46 2015 UTC,I say retire it for a while. At least until a new midfielder comes in.

Those are the rules So, it will have to be given to a player, it's just a matter of who gets it.   Edit: That was part of the reason why Puyi requested Busi getting the #5 shirt"
Barca,37vyrn,zizzor23,1 point,Sat May 30 22:01:40 2015 UTC,We can retire it until the other numbers from 1 to 25 are filled and a new player comes in. We can definitely retire it until January lol.

Barca,37wb2q,Hexascrub,9,Sat May 30 23:29:20 2015 UTC,Madrid sport shows needed something to distract them from the game and they are using the whistling of the national anthem as main talking point.    Example: https://youtu.be/U0zW8_947So
Barca,37wb2q,QuikZilver,3,Sat May 30 23:08:53 2015 UTC,Watching it just for Roncero talk about Neymar
Barca,37wb2q,OmarLittleComing,1 point,Sun May 31 00:00:52 2015 UTC,Roncero is very quiet this season.
Barca,37wb2q,tabacal,2,Sun May 31 03:26:47 2015 UTC,"Wtf, this is some 1984 shit there."
Barca,37wb2q,whywhy1,3,Sun May 31 16:24:37 2015 UTC,"At first I thought it'd be about messi or Xavi, but I'm realizing this is about Catalonia and Spain correct? Because Spain has a king? Sorry not very good in foreign politics"
Barca,37wb2q,xFragg,7,Sun May 31 00:30:53 2015 UTC,It's a double entendre. The headline makes reference both to Messi and to the fact that Catalans (and Basques) aren't very fond of the Spanish royal family.
Barca,37wb2q,de4th_metalist,1 point,Sun May 31 01:07:41 2015 UTC,I've never understood why though. Why all the hate towards the royal family?
Barca,37wb2q,MatlockJr,3,Sun May 31 08:41:20 2015 UTC,"I assume it's because the royal family represents a unified Spain, whereas they want independence."
Barca,37wb2q,de4th_metalist,3,Sun May 31 09:18:20 2015 UTC,Any reason they want to break off from the rest of Spain?
Barca,37wb2q,vanNostrandby,6,Sun May 31 09:25:46 2015 UTC,"I suppose they consider themselves their own ethnic group and as such a nation within a nation of people. I'd say it's somewhat natural to form countries based on people living in a certain area for many generations if you look back at the history of governing, wouldn't you?"
Barca,37wb2q,de4th_metalist,1 point,Sun May 31 09:55:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fair enough."
Barca,37wb2q,CourtofLapels,1 point,Sun May 31 12:43:17 2015 UTC,"""own ethnic group"" is not the case. Catalonia is composed of many different, non-competing ethnic groups, and as such is not specifically driving for independence based on ethnic ties. Such a drive harks back to Nazi ideology. Catalonia's independence motives are driven by unified linguistic and cultural heritage, as well as political and economic factors. But being ethnically ""catalan"" has very little, if anything at all, to do with nationalistic and thus independence-separatist sentiments."
Barca,37wb2q,vanNostrandby,1 point,Sun May 31 16:38:39 2015 UTC,Ethnicity has everything to do with nationalism.
Barca,37wb2q,CourtofLapels,1 point,Sun May 31 16:43:00 2015 UTC,"They are two overlapping but not mutually inclusive expressions of human existence. I do not accept that they are directly, or even obliquely, synonymous."
Barca,37wb2q,vanNostrandby,1 point,Sun May 31 21:04:28 2015 UTC,"Well obviously. Which is why I didn't write ""ethnicity is nationalism""."
Barca,37wb2q,MatlockJr,3,Mon Jun 1 04:04:13 2015 UTC,"It goes back many centuries, but more recently the Catalonian region produces a big part of the GDP so they see themselves as propping up the rest of the country. They have their own language (dialect), culture, and I think a regional government. They're calling for a referendum on independence, and it is gaining momentum, but I think it will be a long time before it happens, if it does at all. Still, the people can dream."
Barca,37wb2q,de4th_metalist,2,Sun May 31 11:43:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. I don't know about the politics of it but football would surely suffer. I read somewhere that Barcelona and Espanyol wouldn't be able to take part in La Liga."
Barca,37wb2q,CourtofLapels,2,Sun May 31 12:46:21 2015 UTC,"And catalan-speakers in general feel persecuted by the more radical Spanish speakers outside of Catalonia proper. They also view these same radicals and reactionaries as possessing the primary functions of power within unified Spain. Because they feel that they cannot express themselves save on Catalan soil, and because that soil has a confusing web of loyalties and political allegiances binding it in ways that make proxysmic self-expression virtually impossible without layers of filtration, they wish to separate themselves from what they feel unjustly bound to."

Really, going over and talking shit and slapping Neymar because he does a fucking trick THAT IS PART OF FOOTBALL? Bunch of shitheads.  They started fouling him constantly and playing dirty way before he started doing ""tricks"", and then they suddenly have the RIGHT to play tough guys when he does a fancy flick? Do they expect him to just take every fucking kick to the leg and be okay with it?  Fuck these pathetic assholes, pissing me right the fuck off."

So we will be playing Athletic Bilbao for the Spanish Supercup next season.  IIRC, in the old days if a domestic double happened you were automatically awarded the Supercup trophy."

Barca,37xajj,I_am_oneiros,0,Mon Jun 1 06:01:10 2015 UTC,Oh so it's going to be Athletic? Thanks for the clarification. I've read that we'll play against the runner up and automatically thought it'd be against the Liga runner up. I was pissed that that will offer a chance to real Madrid to win a trophy although they didn't deserve to be in a super cup match.   Glad it's Bilbao!!
Barca,37w6xs,A_Kind_Shark,5,Sat May 30 22:23:18 2015 UTC,No one would have blamed a talent like Suarez for taking on the shot. That he has both the awareness and the team spirit to lay it off for Neymar just proves how awesome he is.   He'd rather win than have the personal glory and he has the intelligence to make amazing team decisions in the moment. We are lucky to have such a talent.
Barca,37w6xs,auryn0151,3,Sun May 31 02:19:07 2015 UTC,Yes! 99/100 he would have scored if he shot there. I fucking love him for how he is so unselfish and how he's really comfortable with his team mates and with Barça's play style

Barca,37w8j1,giraz,2,Sat May 30 22:37:58 2015 UTC,"From what I understand it's not about them giving him more money or a longer contract, it's the fact that they only decided to renew when they were hit with the transfer ban. Before that they showed no interest and were even allowing other clubs to negotiate with him."
Barca,37w8j1,harloss,3,Sun May 31 01:03:23 2015 UTC,"I know we're all massive Messi fans, I have three Messi jerseys myself.. But doesn't this look like maybe some poor defending?

Barca,37zb0h,someschmoe,23,Sun May 31 17:54:09 2015 UTC,Umm... When the fuck did you start watching FC Barcelona?
Barca,37zb0h,Jelboo,11,Sun May 31 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"For me it's not so much about the trophies, it's the way they played.  Peps team played fantastically beautiful, lots of possession, held the ball at the back and made teams go out of their game plan. And also brought the best out of the players like Pedro, bojan and created messi's role.   This lucho team is fearless, they go out and overwhelm teams, they're fast and lethal and have the best trio in futbol ever. He has revitalized players like alves and xavi has looked great under him. The same with Matthieu and was able to plug in Suarez in his first year. He's also brought back messi. I haven't seen this highest messi form since the Guardiola era.  So for me it's which style do you like better, and for how long Luis enrique can keep at the helm. Many coaches fall apart after a few seasons once everyone figures out their game plan. Can he adapt and keep them on their heels. The only coaches i know from my own small and concise knowledge that rival these two Are Cruyff and Sir Alex Ferguson"
Barca,37zb0h,beastcat,2,Sun May 31 18:26:08 2015 UTC,"Case in point for me, was 2011(?) CL final vs United. Never have I seen a team dominate possession so much, and it then I really fell in love with Barca."
Barca,37zb0h,oviforconnsmythe,1 point,Sun May 31 21:01:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think Pep's team is smart, incredibly skilled in their passing and very well controlled. Lucho's team works harder, is more physical and is fitter. Either way I honestly think what they both really excelled in is how they managed to motivate their players and get the best out of them, as well as getting them to work with each other and provide for one another as a team."
Barca,37zb0h,limewired,3,Mon Jun 1 00:23:11 2015 UTC,Lucho is 1/3 of the way to equaling Pep's greatest season trophy wise.  Edit: 6 trophies in a calendar year is what I am referring to.
Barca,37zb0h,Not_Tom_Brady,9,Sun May 31 19:33:27 2015 UTC,Lets not..
Barca,37zb0h,IhateAngryBirds,13,Sun May 31 18:14:53 2015 UTC,"Fine...  Pep created the arguably the best team of all time, that team was the most beautiful thing to watch. The 2 teams are different, I still feel Guardiola approached matches better than Lucho, as Pep could completely change the strategy on the field without making any sub. Pep basically set in motion what would become our standard for years to come, even now, Busquets would not be Busquets without Pep, same with Iniesta, Xavi, Pique, hell maybe even Messi would never had become as goodas he is without him.  If you want to compare them, you can say Pep's Barca was all about finesse, controling the match, looking for the perfect opportunity and exploiting any weakness the opponent had, while Lucho's is about brute force, which fully utilizes the skill of our forwards to break down the opponents, unlike with Pep, where the midfield was the heart of the team."
Barca,37zb0h,IhateAngryBirds,6,Sun May 31 18:17:17 2015 UTC,Couldn't have said it better myself. I seriously don't understand why this is even a discussion. No other manager would have been able to do what Pep did. Yet some people think Barca magically became this great team.
Barca,37zb0h,BarcaAreTheBest,3,Sun May 31 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"Alright I'll try explain this in a slightly different way which is based upon the perspective of how our team performed on pitch under two different manager's guidance/leadership/control and my approach/philosophy regarding the comparison of Luis Enrique and Pep Guardiola is not based around winning trophies.  I think Pep is really a great tactician. When he started as the Barça manager he knew what he could to do with some of the greatest football talents the world has ever seen and he perfectly utilized his competitive advantage to build such a team that was able to stun the realm of football with their superior possession style play (I think it is safe to say that Tiki-Taka rose to fame under his leadership) and stellar performance on pitch.   No wonder he properly used his prime Xavi/Iniesta 'the two great midfield maestros' and he had access to a great leader like Puyol who safeguarded the Barça defense perfectly. Not to mention there were some others who did contribute to create the Pep era Barça success but nevertheless Pep was able to bring out something from his players with his superb strategy that enabled Barça to earn a fairly long term dominance in European Football.    About Luis Enrique, I think it is still too early to compare his achievement/performance with Pep. One thing for sure that Luis Enrique is still behind Pep Guardiola in terms of tactical expertise. But LE appears to be a smart man and he knows what is needed to be done to get his team starting for a brighter future. I'm pretty sure that LE hasn't done building the team he wants but still doing really good work.   With transfer ban and few of our important veterans who have already started to see the twilight zone of their career; amidst all these rough patches LE still is doing his best to motivate his disciples to perform their best, he successfully has injected the hunger of success in his players so that they strive to achieve success and for that they work a lot harder; and this is what makes our team play as a whole team rather than waiting for one individual performer to do the job for the rest of team.   It is easily noticeable that when our plays on the field, their body language and their intensity of playing on pitch, their attempts to quench their thirst to be victorious etc.; all these seem quite remarkable. Although LE is lucky that Barça's offensive force have been working like the way it should and Messi still works as a charm on pitch but then again we can't forget the unsung heroes of our team (i.e. both of our GKs have been doing really well, our weak defense suddenly became solid and I think these aren't just co-incidences but the result of our coach and other coaching stuffs hours of hard work with our players) behind this performance.  I hope Luis Enrique will do even better with our team in the coming seasons."
Barca,37zb0h,Football_Enthusiast,2,Sun May 31 21:15:17 2015 UTC,"How good is Guardiola, when Luis Enrique is about to match his greatest achivement?   Guardiola's greatest achivements, isn't what he achived trophy-wise. It's what he created.   Humiliating every single ''top'' team he's faced.   We struggled both home and away to Valencia, and didn't humiliate them at all. We also struggled away, and a little at home, to Real Madrid. I think humiliating is pushing it, but it's undeniable that he has proven a great record against top teams.    how much of Guardiola's success was just Messi being amazing....   Enrique is currently winning a treble off Messi's argueably greatest form ever, and IMO we're more Messi-dependant in our success than ever. And I doubt Messi would be AS good, smart and all that, without Guardiola.    I think this side is clearly superior to the 2011 one   I don't know why on earth you would think that. I honestly don't.   Enrique has been great, no doubt about it, but what Guardiola gave this club... Not just trophywise, but in general... its just out of this world."
Barca,37zb0h,Morcule,2,Sun May 31 19:33:29 2015 UTC,I'm just wondering how much of Guardiola's success was just Messi being amazing and Iniesta and Xavi being in their prime    And how much of Enrique's success can be attributed to having Messi Suarez and Neymar?
Barca,37zb0h,Aj16ay,-4,Sun May 31 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"That's exactly my point. How much of it is good coaching and how much of it is some of the best players of all time doing their thing, especially when Guardiola has found little success without Messi at his disposal?"
Barca,37zb0h,limewired,1 point,Sun May 31 19:03:32 2015 UTC,"Well, case in point real madrid has Gareth Bale and Cristiano together, but the team isn't playing well together. It might have a lot to do with the way the see each other, which I think will have a lot to do with the coaching and how they train together, they all need a motivational voice behind them from the coach."
Barca,37zb0h,BarcaAreTheBest,1 point,Sun May 31 19:07:57 2015 UTC,"Without Pep, none of this would have been possible. The manager's that come and go will always be carrying on what he started, until one day the essence of this team has gone. Look at it this way, what did Pep start off with? And what did Lucho start off with? Don't get me wrong Lucho has done a great job with this team, but Pep built it's foundations."
Barca,37zb0h,TimeFingers,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:25:57 2015 UTC,"Both managers injected their own spirit to the team, you can compare this Barca to the Luis Enrique player, and the Guardiola Barca with Guardiola player. Personally I like the Luis Enrique style more, cuz its direct and they also control the game, we have more varieties to add to the game."
Barca,37uasu,rubensandwich,46,Sat May 30 13:24:51 2015 UTC,"2 reasons. First because as you listed, when Attack and Defense are that strong, in relative terms the midfield appears not as solid.    Second, the tempo and control is not there like it was in the past. Iniesta being sub-par has been massive reason for this. Rakitic and Sergio are 2 midfielders. Having a 3rd one on top form there would make things even more better.   Its a relativist statement. Barca's midfield is not bad, its one of the best in the world, its just not as good as other parts of the team, or as good as it was in the past seasons."
Barca,37uasu,iVarun,3,Sat May 30 13:35:12 2015 UTC,So do we just bench Iniesta? Or what should be done?
Barca,37uasu,zzlew,14,Sat May 30 13:44:50 2015 UTC,At the moment we don't do anything cause Iniesta is playing wonderfully
Barca,37uasu,KangoKid31,4,Sat May 30 14:12:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not, his presence and creativity on the pitch is still a great asset to the team."
Barca,37uasu,iVarun,10,Sat May 30 13:48:51 2015 UTC,"Personally i don't now, glad the coach makes these decisions in big games. Iniesta has had his worst season ever. But who would we replace him with in a big game. He has been bad but not a disaster. He just needs rest, he has been playing since 2011 non stop and Iniesta is a delicate player physically. I am very confident he'll be back to his former self next season."
Barca,37uasu,domi_28,21,Sat May 30 13:50:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree with ""Iniesta has worst season ever"" Iniesta's role simply changed, and he has been more than excellent for his new role (the reason he's still the starter in a treble chase). Iniesta plays so much deeper now defending and when attacking he plays a supporting role to neymar and alba instead of him dribbling through himself. If Iniesta was dribbling up himself while neymar and alba are up, he could have similar numbers as before but we might not be chasing a treble right now. thats all"
Barca,37uasu,iVarun,-1,Sat May 30 16:06:50 2015 UTC,"Not really.   I have watched Iniesta since he was not even a full member of the 1st team. This season is without doubt the single worst he has had in his life, bar none. There is no debate on this.   And it has little to do with the position he plays, He has played multiple positions in his career, some which weren't even natural to him like a left winger in recent years.    Its to do with his play. He is misplacing simple passes, unable to hold onto the ball properly, have less dissecting passes, losing the balls/possession, lack of tempo and drive and much more.   He is just too tired and its showing."

Barca,37uasu,iVarun,-1,Sat May 30 19:25:16 2015 UTC,"So which was the worst of his career?    Even the ones he had in his 1st season, he was better in terms of skill and tempo and drive. Iniesta has misplaced more pases this season than in his entire life. Even this match he is doing it.   There wasn't a season when Iniesta was worse, in fact even when he was injured in season like 2009-10, he was still immense whenever he played."
Barca,37uasu,I_am_oneiros,1 point,Sat May 30 20:18:34 2015 UTC,"Whoscored is the worst possible way to judge defensive players. It places too much focus on attacking moves and dribbles, both of which Iniesta is phasing out of his game.  As an example, look at whoscored rate Fazio (at Tottenham). He's one of the highest rated players in the league but has been piss poor."
Barca,37uasu,domi_28,1 point,Sun May 31 03:28:17 2015 UTC,Your analysis of his position is simply not right
Barca,37uasu,iVarun,1 point,Sat May 30 23:10:28 2015 UTC,"Then you need to read my comment again to grasp which my analysis of him was.   It had nothing to do with his position. Iniesta is good enough to play any attacking/midfield position.    He is bad because of his actual play. Facets of which i listed and its true.   My timeframe of judging Iniesta is not 2011 or 2009, It goes back to when he was not even a 1st teamer."
Barca,37uasu,abaasm,0,Sun May 31 13:25:36 2015 UTC,"Do you think he can or needs to be used the same way as xavi this season? If so, who would get regular minutes in his place? Maybe masche busi raki as the starting mid?"
Barca,37uasu,HoboChique,3,Sat May 30 15:47:32 2015 UTC,"masche busi raki   That's too defensive, though. Too slow. We need the pace of build-up that two attacking CMs can give. The only replacement I can see as of right now, on our bench, is Rafinha. Rafi Raki Busi, Iniesta as a super-sub."
Barca,37uasu,InAnIndianAccent,2,Sat May 30 15:56:34 2015 UTC,Rafinha really showed some good skill and vision against Deportivo.
Barca,37uasu,HoboChique,3,Sat May 30 17:29:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.   Also, just for clarification purposes, I'm not saying Iniesta shouldn't be a starter next season, I'm saying I think Rafi is the best option when Iniesta doesn't start."
Barca,37uasu,XXIV24,6,Sat May 30 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"I think most people might think that because when you compare the midfield to the front line (applies to the back as well) you're going to see a difference in terms of recognition. Surely it could be stronger, but I think the area is fine at its current state."
Barca,37uasu,R0b1nh0,6,Sat May 30 13:51:39 2015 UTC,"They're doing the dirty work. Just as important as MSN but they get less fame. Happens with tons of things. The big stars, important people, .. always get the fame"
Barca,37uasu,survivalothefittest,4,Sat May 30 14:21:26 2015 UTC,"People say this because they don't include Messi in the midfield.  People either see it as a liability that a ""forward"" is doing so much of the creative work and moving the ball forward (what Xavi and Iniesta used to bring the the game), or they just don't notice it and see that the current midfielders are not that good at these things as they used to be.  Alves also does a lot for moving the ball and setting up plays, but he is not in a midfielder position either.  Maybe it's better to say Barcelona functions in a ""post-midfield"" world now."
Barca,37uasu,harloss,5,Sat May 30 14:05:28 2015 UTC,"Anybody who calls our midfield ""weak"" is deluded. It just isn't on the level that it was with Xavi and Iniesta at their peak forms, but that's not fair, because no midfield will probably ever live up to that one, at least in terms of tiki-taka control.  I think people say this because, the way Barca creates goals now, has changed. It used to be midfield ---> Messi. Xavi or Iniesta would get the ball forward and try to find a forward, Messi very commonly. Now I know this is a generalization, and people far overestimated the number of assists they gave Messi, but, the fundamental way we attack has changed - it seems its far more often Messi, Neymar and Suarez creating the goals together, instead of the midfield doing it for them."
Barca,37uasu,NostalgicRogue,0,Sat May 30 15:22:35 2015 UTC,Defender > Midfielder > Forward > another Forward > Goal  Dani's haircut  ???  Trophies
Barca,37uasu,pepetrillvia,4,Sun May 31 02:25:54 2015 UTC,"When we dominated, it was made very obvious that it was because of our midfield, prime Xavi, prime iniesta and young busquets absolutely ran shit in the midfield and controlled the entire game. The only reason our midfield is really considered weak now is because the offense doesn't run through them controlling the game nearly as much. Since we can attack and be direct or even counterattack there is less of a need to control for 90 minutes. Of course it's worth considering that the Spanish national team bounced out early in the World Cup despite their midfield talent, and that pep has such a dominant midfield in Bayern. I would say that our midfield is still top 3 but there is a lack of emphasis now on control and more focus on the offense and the defense."
Barca,37uasu,petnarwhal,9,Sat May 30 16:58:05 2015 UTC,It's odd considering we have the best defensive midfielder in the world..
Barca,37uasu,Tezemery,2,Sat May 30 15:19:54 2015 UTC,"For sure but him and Iniesta have been victims of the change in system, they have been playing a certain way since they were probably 12 years old and suddenly its changed and they are still adjusting."
Barca,37uasu,ir7425,1 point,Sat May 30 17:34:21 2015 UTC,"Not a sudden change & not a new role for Iniesta. All his youth level, Iniesta played as pivot. In UCL final 2006, he played as pivot. Infact, he started to play more attacking role since Rijkaard's last years."
Barca,37uasu,OriginalUsername30,-1,Sat May 30 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"Do we? I rarely see Busquets in dream teams or team of the year. Although he is great, I don't get the ""elite"" vibe from him."
Barca,37uasu,petnarwhal,8,Sat May 30 17:12:07 2015 UTC,"He may not be as flashy, but he is definitely elite. Who would you consider better? Busquets won't score screamers or give 40 m through passes, or have a last man slide tackle, but he is always a step or two ahead of everyone else. Today, look out for him.   Why is he so good defensively? Mascherano has highlight slide tackles, but Busquets doesn't need them. Before the opposing team gives the pass, he has already positioned himself at an optimal position to either intercept the pass or make it difficult for the player to receive.   What about offensively? Again, one step ahead. Before receiving the ball he knows his surroundings. He knows if an opponent is behind him, and where his teammates are. This is why he can give passes with barely thinking, or dribbling an opponent. It is extremely difficult to take the ball from him, both due his ball control and long legs. I don't know if this is still true, but there was a stat some years ago that he was the player who most yellow cards had provoqued.  TLDR: he is not a YouTube/fifa elite player, but he is every coaches dream player."

Barca,37uasu,Football_Enthusiast,2,Sun May 31 10:58:55 2015 UTC,Isn't that what makes him so good though? He's just the perfect oiled cog in the Barca machine. Won't be noticed when we're on our game.
Barca,37uasu,cdn_brcafan,3,Sat May 30 18:21:09 2015 UTC,"Our midfield used to orchestrate our deadly offense but that midfield charm is gone now. I see that there is a missing link between our offense and the midfield and somehow our current midfield can't play its role properly as it should.   Previously we used to have creative and technically strong midfielders who would play and move the ball forward and would feed the ball to the offense which we currently lack. Nowadays Alves is often very active playing a role to feed the ball to our offense and then our offense does the rest of the job.   Alves isn't supposed to play that upfront but he does that to keep the ball rolling in the opponent territory. Rakitic is good who impressed me by his box-to-box midfielder style playing (he doesn't do that all the time but I think he has the capability to do that) but himself alone isn't enough to pull the task.   I believe Iniesta still has some gas left for contributing in our team but surprisingly he hasn't had a good season, I hope his performance in coming seasons at Barça will be very good. Extraordinary midfielders like Iniesta or Xavi is very tough to find and right at this moment Barça simply don't have that midfield control, creativity, domination like past."
Barca,37uasu,call-me-shirley,2,Sat May 30 14:39:00 2015 UTC,"The midfield isn't what it used to be when xavi and iniesta was in their prime thus why we've had a number of games this season where we have no midfield control. Off course, we compensate with our front three and our wall at the back. We have become beasts in counter attacking.  Personally I'd like to see the midfield control come back so that there's less chaos in midfield which happened in a number of games this season and gives me heart attacks. So the profile of a player I'd like to get is someone with passing ability, vision, able to hold the ball and dictate play. Koke, Verrati come to mind."
Barca,37uasu,Not_Tom_Brady,2,Sat May 30 14:41:00 2015 UTC,Because stats. Our front three do everything that adds up to numbers. I think that is why.
Barca,37uasu,choss,2,Sat May 30 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"Because the reference point for most of is is xavi, iniesta, busquets... Which was the best midfield in the world for years"
Barca,37uasu,d3fr4gm3nt,2,Sat May 30 15:12:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily say ""weak"" but probably is less impressive. We have the best players of South America up front, our defense and GK are finally performing the way we always wanted (and more).  I also think its due to the new style. Before our game depended a lot on the work of Xavi, Iniesta and Busquets, whereas now it depends more on the verticality, the ball moves faster from the GK to the front 3."
Barca,37uasu,Amiga73,2,Sat May 30 16:38:46 2015 UTC,I don't think Barca's midfield has the same dynamic it used to have. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Barca's style of play has changed substantially with this new team.   Especially with Messi being the play maker this season that we have seen. We simply do not have the traditional division that is there between the mid and and the forwards. Yes our traditional mid fielders have been a little off mark. But It has not impacted our game.   It is not like messi has been forced to be a playmaker. Rakitic has been great. Iniesta perhaps not as effective but overall it has been good. But we will need a replacement soon for Xavi. I hope it isn't Pogba though.
Barca,37uasu,BarcaAreTheBest,2,Sat May 30 21:09:46 2015 UTC,"Speed. Not the fastest midfield in Europe in fact one of the slowest. Great with the ball but can be dominated by faster midfield's. Not the tallest and can easily be beaten in the air.   Busquets is great at positioning by defensively he is week on the ball. He is poor in the air and can get easily pushed off the ball. Good passer but crap shooter. He can have acres of space in front of him and he will just jog or run at a slow pace. Iniesta very good on the ball, runs into space, good passer , poor shooter. Rakitic very good on the ball, runs into space, good passer , good shooter if he decides. But he is slow. Xavi great passer, poor shooter, sometimes runs into space but slow.   Because of the poor shooting most teams would just fall back and wait for them to pass and mark Messi with 2 players. Because of the pace , other teams know that even when they have the ball they can easily catch up and defend. This is why the often put 3 to 4 players on Messi and 2 for Busquets, Iniesta and Rakitic.  People often forget that when Toure played for Barcelona he would always attack the space and often scored. This is why they are looking for a box to box midfielder who can defend and attack at pace. The more attacking the midfield the more space Messi, Neymar and Suarez will get as teams will have to use more players to handle the midfield."
Barca,37uasu,Hexascrub,2,Sat May 30 21:53:28 2015 UTC,"Rakitic is dynamic. He can attack, defend and is a true box-to-box midfielder. Iniesta isn't the best at defending, but hey he's don Andres. Busquets is great at defending in the middle third of the pitch, but around our own box he isn't as great. Considering where we are I don't think the midfield is weak, it's doing the job and seems to be working."

Barca,37t9ip,Spookylives,12,Sat May 30 05:16:24 2015 UTC,"I'd never consider taking an Italian club lightly (assuming they are capable enough to put up a good fight). Taking victory for granted playing against the Italians will be a moronic gesture. I always believe that to win a tournament a club don't have to be the best among all the participants but they have to play their best which may not help to win a tournament all the time but still will yield very good result. Here Juventus are no exception, they have reached to the final by their own virtue and I'm pretty sure that Luis Enrique got some knowledge under his belt about The Italian Job due to his involvement with AS Roma so I believe it is highly unlikely that Barça are considering Juventus as an easy opponent.  Moreover nowadays in Italy Juventus are the Bayern Munich of Serie A who dominate all the other clubs in their domestic league. They have got some decent players, they convincingly defeated Real, they have already won Scudetto and Coppa Italia so they got a chance to win treble, few of their players have sweet memories of winning WC in Olympiastadion, they got two veteran Italian players who probably will never play together in any UCL final; so their motivation to win UCL this season will be as much high as ours. We may have bitter past; but I'm optimistic about Barça winning treble this season. I am hopeful that Barça will triumph and win '14-'15 UCL."
Barca,37t9ip,Football_Enthusiast,4,Sat May 30 07:00:16 2015 UTC,"Situation in 1994 & 2015 are completely different. In 1994, the team has been winning things for years. They lacked something.  While in 2015, the team is reinforced. They haven't winning they used to for 3 years. The team is very much concentrated & focused to win titles. Unlike 1994, many of the key players of this team has literary won nothing in their whole career. For example, Neymar, Suarez & Rakitic have just won their first Liga title in Europe. The players are hungry. They KNOW why they failed in the past. They are eager to make this up."
Barca,37t9ip,ir7425,4,Sat May 30 07:57:36 2015 UTC,Suarez actually won a shield with Ajax.
Barca,37t9ip,skecr8r,4,Sat May 30 08:50:48 2015 UTC,I doubt he really considers that as a title of his own though. He left in the winter and was banned for a while for biting Bakkal as well I think.
Barca,37t9ip,jklz,2,Sat May 30 09:09:49 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I forgot about the ban."
Barca,37t9ip,skecr8r,2,Sat May 30 09:15:49 2015 UTC,"We can't take things for granted, if it was any other team we were playing in the final I think I would be a lot more confident but we know exactly how Juve will play and that is incredibly defensive but trying to hit us on the break, if they score first the game could be very difficult.  I think in all honesty Juve were at least a bit lucky to get where they are, I wasn't fully convinced of them against Madrid and at the Bernabeu they could have been 3 or 4 down in the first half, they looked absolutely horrible but Italian teams have shown time and time again you don't have to play well or be the best team to win and that should scare any Cule."
Barca,37t9ip,Tezemery,1 point,Sat May 30 13:49:11 2015 UTC,Yeah don't talk about luck. Reminds me of the Chelsea win in 11-12.
Barca,37t9ip,Football_Enthusiast,1 point,Sat May 30 13:57:31 2015 UTC,"I agree that Juventus didn't look good against Real at Bernabeu and to be honest Real could have fetched an easy victory if they didn't waste numerous chances they got throughout the match (Bale was looking desperate to score and he was real close from scoring at least one). But you've got to admit that to achieve a victory a team does need to be a bit fortunate, doesn't matter how good a team is, they must have a bit of good luck to grab a victory.   Italians are really unpredictable, I remember in '06 WC nobody thought that Italy would win the final and before their semi-final match against Germany I thought Italy's campaign for this WC is probably going to be over now but damn they shut the Germans with their extra-time stunner goals. Barça better be careful with the Juves. I hope against all the odds, Barça will win '14-'15 UCL."
Barca,37t9ip,iVarun,3,Sat May 30 16:34:33 2015 UTC,"Barca and overconfidence go hand in hand. Even in recent years, the team doses off massively once utter dominance has been established, mid-matches."
Barca,37t9ip,iVarun,2,Sat May 30 13:32:19 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about Lucho's Barca, I feel this approach is much more pragmatic and the team wouldn't keep on pushing to up the scoreline post half-time if it's high enough. We go into cruise control mode and make sure there isn't any risky play. We've been punished vs Valencia and lost the Bayern 2nd leg too. This strategy wouldn't extend to the finals IMO. The players are hungry and fit. They'll win the matches without any complacence creeping in."
Barca,37t9ip,TwoTecs,2,Sat May 30 13:44:50 2015 UTC,"Not Lucho-specific, its just a Barca thing, i have seen this for as long as i remember watching Barca and its not even the normal drop in tempo that teams get after getting 3-0 or more up. Its just something different. It can happen to the team at even 0-0 or 1-0. There is such confidence in the team that they just take the play too easy and its bites the team occasionally but not every-time which is why it persists i guess."
Barca,37t9ip,romanmoses,1 point,Sat May 30 13:48:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I agree this has happened at times post a hectic match schedule (and always post international breaks) and when the team went into headless chicken running mode (Tata's second half and the Jordi Roura tenure). Back then, we were just completely out of new ideas to overcome an opponent. It is absolutely not the case this season."
Barca,37t9ip,TwoTecs,1 point,Sat May 30 13:54:25 2015 UTC,I think we have learned our lesson; just look at our record after that. We faced MU two times in the final and did not throw away the second one because of over confidence.  Edit: words.

He has potential to be the next Eto'o, so I say loan him out to a team that can encourage and mature him."
Barca,37tblm,JurijFedorov,-1,Sat May 30 06:19:59 2015 UTC,He hasn't proven himself yet. I think I am disappointed in him as people said he was the new Eto'o. He is still a great player but for Stoke not Barca.

The reason I suggested this is because I want him to get back to his glory days, but I don't think it will be here, when the transfer ban ends I feel like he will leave. He loves this team too much to leave during the ban though, that's for sure."

Barca,37qfek,domi_28,5,Fri May 29 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"my friend if you are interested to watch some really crazy barca games, I recommend you check out the manita performance of Cruyff's team back in the early 90's, imo as good as the treble 2009 team. The one with Stoichkov, Romario and co. Or even better if you want to watch a really really exciting game watch the Atleti v barca game where remuntada really started!!"

Barca,37qfek,Tysox,8,Fri May 29 17:20:02 2015 UTC,People are heavily underestimating Bilbao. Suarez should play IMO.
Barca,37qfek,polechi33,7,Fri May 29 18:28:48 2015 UTC,I think he was just assuming Suarez won't be100%
Barca,37qfek,TheStinger87,2,Fri May 29 18:22:20 2015 UTC,I would prefer doing it like in the second leg against Bayern. If we get a relatively comfortable lead in the first half we should sub suarez for pedro

I'm staying in the Sants area and they had a parade earlier this afternoon with full marching band, drums, the whole 9 yards. I talked to some of them, most said they don't even have tickets, they're just there to chill outside the stadium. The locals in our area were chill, everyone smiling and happy because the Athletic fans were actually a lot of fun. Lots of car honking, but it's mostly banter I think. The only people who looked unimpressed were an old Catalan couple sitting on the park bench as they marched by haha.  I took some pictures and videos, I'll upload them tonight after I get back from the match."

Barca,37qx40,Delta_culer,2,Fri May 29 21:50:43 2015 UTC,So they always boo it before the games? Or specifically because it's the cdr final?
Barca,37qx40,criticaljalapeno,12,Fri May 29 22:19:12 2015 UTC,They don't play the anthem at every game. They are playing it because it is the final and it's the Kings cup which means he will be there.
Barca,37qx40,Eamo,14,Fri May 29 22:23:58 2015 UTC,The Spanish flag should never fly at the Camp Nou.

Barca,37rwoa,drotoriouz,3,Fri May 29 22:08:55 2015 UTC,you'd think that by Spain voting for Blatter (allegedly)that would carry some weight. I guess not.
Barca,37rwoa,JurijFedorov,3,Fri May 29 22:25:34 2015 UTC,FIFA has been doing weird things lately. So them only going after Barca is nothing that surprises me.

Barca,37r0jm,Chunky_mono,3,Fri May 29 18:23:51 2015 UTC,Wonderful article. Finally a football article that has new info on things.
Barca,37q28r,Illegal_sal,26,Fri May 29 14:28:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree, Messi scores the 5th goal. But he also scored the other 4."
Barca,37q28r,iagolima,41,Fri May 29 14:32:30 2015 UTC,"The quote in OP misleading. The discussion says - Great players don't score the 5th goal when you're winning 4-0, they score when it matters most."
Barca,37q28r,ir7425,7,Fri May 29 15:10:38 2015 UTC,My favorite Messi goal is the fifth goal in a 5-0 :)
Barca,37q28r,survivalothefittest,5,Fri May 29 16:14:32 2015 UTC,Perfect illustration of a performance and a match where the statement Goals don't define how great a player is is true.   Messi was the best player on that pitch that night and he didn't score any goals.
Barca,37q28r,iVarun,3,Fri May 29 18:33:19 2015 UTC,the two passes for el Guaje Villa were breathtaking though.

You don't need these fat old men telling you Messi is the GOAT. Objectively look at his stats compared to any other player in the world, or form your own opinion by actually watching him on and off the ball."
Barca,37q28r,maaaze,11,Fri May 29 17:44:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're talking out of their asses. What they are saying is actually important. You can score the 5th goal in a 5-0 win (but what they are really saying is that you can score a lot of goals in a 5-0 win) and have amazing statistics, but what makes a really great player is scoring when it matters."

The Spanish Footballer Association (AFE) has already agreed to the proposed date The bigger issue here is the renegotiation of TV deals, and LFP has already started working on those.   Hopefully this means the fixture will be available at a time closer to when the english FA does. Spain usually takes about a month longer, which can be a hassle for those of us who plan vacations around these dates."

Barca,37qowc,navidjaan,11,Fri May 29 17:05:54 2015 UTC,"I don't see this move. First of all because he isn't even a RB, he's played there a couple of games and has been called for the Spanish squad (as a midfielder) and suddenly Barça rumors appear to be the next RB. I don't buy these rumors."
Barca,37qowc,MixMixed,3,Fri May 29 18:33:55 2015 UTC,He's Catalan and he looks very good as an attacking right back. Im buying the rumours.
Barca,37qowc,ChinggisKhagan,2,Fri May 29 21:58:49 2015 UTC,"He may be catalan but he played for Espanyol's youth team, plus we should get a real RB that has played more than 5 games on that position and knows how to defend also."
Barca,37qowc,MixMixed,6,Fri May 29 22:07:08 2015 UTC,"He played at La Masia for a couple of years together with Jordi Alba. Also, he has been playing RB for 8 games this season, all towards the end of the season, including games against Real Madrid and Dnipro, where Coke has been available.   It's obvious that Emery is converting him to a RB, just like he converted Jordi Alba in to a LB. Remember Valencia's left side for most of 11/12? Alba was their LW'er, while Mathieu was their LB."
Barca,37qowc,MixMixed,1 point,Fri May 29 22:51:58 2015 UTC,"He didn't even have a chance, he played for one year and they got rid of him when he was 13.  I only recall Fiorentina's 1st leg and the Europa League final. Against Madrid he played in his natural position. I insist, those two games he's done great, but it seems to me that he has to play more as a RB to demonstrate he is a top one and can play for FCBarcelona as a starter.  If not we can use Pedro :P"
Barca,37qowc,MixMixed,1 point,Sat May 30 10:08:56 2015 UTC,"I'm currently doing a video on his season, so I'm watching all his games.

Barca,37qowc,ir7425,1 point,Sat May 30 03:46:00 2015 UTC,"Many?  And also, I'm not saying it is like the main reason he wouldn't come. It is a reason, which makes it even less likely to happen."

Barca,37qowc,ir7425,1 point,Sat May 30 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"Cuenca nor Deulofeu have played for any Espanyol team. Bartra played once when he was 10 and since he is 11 he's been at the club. Tello is the only one that I can accept because he played for Espanyol B. Plus, any of them are currently on this years squad (except Bartra) and haven't been a continuous starting player. Loads of more ex-FCBarcelona players play at Espanyol than viceversa."
Barca,37qowc,MixMixed,1 point,Sun May 31 01:10:29 2015 UTC,You are right on Deulofeu. But Cuenca was in Espanyol academy during 2001-03 according to wikipedia.   Loads of more ex-FCBarcelona players play at Espanyol than viceversa.   Current Espanyol captain Sergio Garcia is La Masia graduate.

Barca,37qowc,honamdoh,1 point,Fri May 29 18:48:36 2015 UTC,"So he fits our style, then? You don't see our full backs act like defenders. Vidal was an attacking full back and he was solid. Just like he also was vs Real Madrid where he also played at RB."
Barca,37qowc,Morcule,1 point,Fri May 29 22:54:31 2015 UTC,Can't see any other realistic choice besides Bellerin.
Barca,37qowc,broad_h2o,3,Fri May 29 18:20:06 2015 UTC,"You're also focusing heavily on the ex-Masia angle. There are plenty of decent RBs out there - Seamus Coleman, for instance. There are complications with adapting in such cases, of course, but it's silly to limit our thinking so strictly."

He did score some wonderful and important goals and his celebrations were so sincere.  However, I think he is more of a poacher striker than an attacking winger, which is where he ended up playing regularly. I felt like he under-performed much of his time here, sadly. He came and left in an offside position."
Barca,37mbq1,Alfrodo,3,Thu May 28 22:26:35 2015 UTC,"well..  if my memory serves me correctly i think that at Valencia he was used as a central striker ,he even scored a few against us"
Barca,37mbq1,XsTream23,3,Fri May 29 00:19:31 2015 UTC,"Of all his roles, I think his absolute best is indeed a second striker, playing a bit behind and to the left of another central striker. He does poach some excellent goals regardless, but second striker he's just a different player. The way him and Torres used to combine for Spain on a consistent basis... :)"

While he fits the bill, he offered plenty more to the attack, such as assists, movement of the ball ( Messi's assist in the 5-0 against Madrid), and long range goals ( the beauties against Madrid and United). Eto might be a better poacher, and Suarez is a stronger forward,  but Villa is the most intelligent and the best finisher(pre leg injury).  El Guaji was a sexy motherfucker."
Barca,37mbq1,Mefsha5,2,Fri May 29 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"Both goals he scored in the 5-0 versus Madrid were poacher striker goals: Beat the offside trap and then beat the keeper 1v1. Don't get me wrong, he's much more than just a poacher striker - I agree he has a great long range shot and other qualities, but so did Eto.   I stand by my original point that he is better suited in counter-attacking system running into space as a poacher striker than playing attacking winger in a slow-build up system he was often used in with us."
Barca,37mbq1,Alfrodo,15,Sat May 30 03:45:50 2015 UTC,"Easily one of our most beloved players in recent memory. We miss you, Villa."
Barca,37mbq1,YoSoyMilkChocolate,14,Thu May 28 20:13:58 2015 UTC,"When I first got into Barca I remember liking David Villa the best.  I enjoyed his attitude and style of play, especially after the third versus Man U in the UCL Final."

Barca,37o08o,ragdoll96,16,Fri May 29 08:50:59 2015 UTC,World cup final is less important than Champions League Semi-final?
Barca,37o08o,lebanesepro,6,Fri May 29 10:22:03 2015 UTC,Barcelona > Argentina. Messi didn't have a decent backing and the other forwards were practically absent in the World Cup final. Had they not been it would have been a similar situation to the semis this year. Neuer can only last so long and Messi proved that three weeks ago.  Edit: just read your username. Are you living in Lebanon or abroad?

Barca,37o08o,smash-smash-SUHMASH,3,Fri May 29 15:33:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry but WC Final is equal to more than 5 UCL Titles if not more at the least. Neuer didn't fail at that stage, he even made Messi shoot wide in the Final. Neuer won that duel fair and square."
Barca,37o08o,iVarun,9,Fri May 29 11:34:45 2015 UTC,"I consider the Champions league to be more difficult cup and even if it wasn't, quantifying one world cup as equal to 5 european cups is the logic of someone who just fell out of a time machine from sixty years ago.  edit:sp"
Barca,37o08o,elanciano31,7,Fri May 29 12:42:18 2015 UTC,"No its not.    Walcott was on great form last season. Then he got injured and missed the WC. He was ready to take part in the later stages of UCL this season again.    All the while he will only get 1 more chance at his peak to play the WC, if his team even qualifies for next tournament.    Players care more for their countries and fans because of nationalism. Club competition comes every year. So a player misses out this season, big deal, within 5 months they are again playing at it.    Elite players get to have like 10 cracks at UCL or League titles if not more.    A player is lucky to even get to participate in a single WC, let alone play at it at his career peak. And this is the same for everyone, its not one player or team being challenged in this way. This creates much more pressure.   European club football due to it having many opportunities has a game style which is much more open, meaning there is much more space because managers take more risks because 1 defeat is not the end of the world and because the other team is also taking risks and both teams have elite players assembled form all over the world.    This means there is more space and for modern players getting space makes things easier.   1 defeat in a WC or even an non-WC International and the NT manager is in danger of getting the boot. At the WC the pressure is immense, many orders more than a club game, be it UCL Final. The space is hard to come by and fewer moments decide the tie. There are not Barta's, Deulo's or some B teamer's at the WC. Its the best there is. There is no room for mistakes. NONE.   WC is the pinnacle of the sport."
Barca,37o08o,iVarun,-1,Fri May 29 16:03:53 2015 UTC,"You are arguing for the value of something just because it comes along once every four years which is wildly arbitrary.  The annual nature of the Champions League does not dilute the fact that a squad that wins a champions league final is far more often than not, superior to a squad that wins a world cup because you can sample the best talent from more or less anywhere.  There are no bartra's or b teamers in the world cup?  Thats a bit of a broad statement given people like Gotze and Schurrle, neither of whom were starters at club level (Shurrle is now bc he is back at wolfsburg).  There are also plenty of players who only get into a world cup by virtue of there being nobody else better than them who has the same passport.  There are a lot of players on shitty WC squads who care quite a lot about their nation I am sure, it doesn't make them good.  edit: You can argue something is more important because the people who run it decide to do it every four years if you like, but I am going with level of talent as my barometer."
Barca,37o08o,elanciano31,2,Fri May 29 17:02:20 2015 UTC,"Pressure in not arbitrary metric. It is as core to football as skill and talent.    Having a loaded squad is not guarantee of talent. The mid 2000's Galacticos proved this.    WC has all sorts of squad, lower ranked ones does have players who are not elite but they give their all, the best of their lives, more than those set of average players would ever give in a club game. And this gets magnified for elite teams and players.    The timeline is same for everyone, its not 4 year for 1 team or player and 2 year for another. Everyone is tested and tested more."
Barca,37o08o,iVarun,-1,Fri May 29 17:13:17 2015 UTC,"actually yeah pressure is totally unquantifiable, some players may feel none while others may feel nothing but pressure.  Were the galacticos that much of a failure? they won the champions league in 2003, what else should they have done, have Madrid secede so they could compete in a world cup?  Maybe exchange it for 5 european cups?"
Barca,37o08o,elanciano31,1 point,Fri May 29 17:21:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe the CL is harder to win, but would you honestly rather Barca win the CL than your country win the world cup? Not being a dick, it's just I've never met anyone like that."

Barca,37o08o,criticaljalapeno,5,Sat May 30 21:53:37 2015 UTC,I'm saying it wasn't down to Neuer succeeding as much as it was to Argentina failing.
Barca,37o08o,ragdoll96,-2,Fri May 29 12:11:05 2015 UTC,"Context was 1v1. Because its not like Messi won alone against those other players teams who were mentioned above like Kompany Hart Koke.    Neuer won 1 duel at the most important stage.   By the collective argument, Neuer didn't really fail at the UCL stage this season as well because it was more Bayern with their injuries(more severe than Argentina's) failing than Barca and Messi twisting the knife.    Can't have both sides of the argument. The former is what was inferred by the user SkintCrayon."
Barca,37o08o,iVarun,-1,Fri May 29 12:19:37 2015 UTC,Then in that case you can't use a game where Messi was playing for Argentina when it's way different than the Messi in Barcelona.
Barca,37o08o,ragdoll96,2,Fri May 29 14:32:48 2015 UTC,Why not. Neuer's level was different as well. You are overcomplicating the context.  Kompany Hart Koke said/inferred they'll shutdown Messi. As did Neuer. As have numerous other people.     Messi won the duels this season and he lost a few in the past. Case closed. There is no he was at that level doing that or his team was at that level doing some other thing. Its the same for everyone.
Barca,37o08o,iVarun,0,Fri May 29 15:58:04 2015 UTC,"Realizing here that our ways of comparison are way different. We're better off dropping this. My idea was that for there to be a comparison you'd have to have similar circumstances, like, say, comparing a Bayern vs Barca match to a Bayern vs Barca match. It just makes more sense to me."
Barca,37o08o,ragdoll96,4,Fri May 29 16:16:32 2015 UTC,"The WC is faaaar more prestigious, I agree. But I would argue that the level in the CL is highter than the one in the WC."
Barca,37o08o,cesarfcb1991,1 point,Fri May 29 13:18:06 2015 UTC,Are you fucking serious? It's the other way around. You can sure as hell say that Messi would trade another sextuple for a World Cup. Without a single doubt in his mind. You're delusional.
Barca,37o08o,ragdoll96,0,Sat May 30 11:40:22 2015 UTC,You're the one who's delusional if you think I'm implying that the Champions League is more important. Read the other replies.
Barca,37o08o,ragdoll96,1 point,Sat May 30 11:48:58 2015 UTC,"Then you shouldn't word it like that in your initial comment. ""failed when it was most important"". You're an idiot if you think this comment doesn't convey that you think CL > WC Final."
Barca,37o08o,ragdoll96,1 point,Sat May 30 11:52:36 2015 UTC,"Messi and Neuer met in the Champions League 3 times. (In one of the 4 matches, Messi was missing due to injury.)  They met twice in the World Cup. (2010 where Germany won 4-0 and 2014 where..... well... you know)  In the CL, Neuer succeeded once out of three times (the 4-0 in the second leg of the 7-0 disaster), in the other two matches Messi did his job against him, whether by scoring goals or by providing key passes/assists.  In the WC Neuer succeeded both times.  Do the math.  Either way, since you're resorting to insults just to try to increase the size of your e-balls, we're better off parting ways. And if you still think it makes me an idiot because I think I know what I meant with my OWN comment, then so be it."
Barca,37o08o,vooglie,1 point,Sat May 30 12:23:32 2015 UTC,"Ok, so the math is that Neuer beat Messi twice in the Champions League (4-0 and 3-2 a couple of weeks ago) and twice in the World Cup (4-0 and 1-0), whereas Messi succeeded once (3-0). So the math gives us 4-1 to Neuer. What's your point, exactly? I think your argument is doing the opposite of what you want it to do."
Barca,37o08o,-Token,1 point,Sat May 30 12:35:19 2015 UTC,"My point is that the ""once out of 3"" the dude was talking about is what I considered to be the Champions League history. The 3-2 doesn't even count as Neuer beating Messi considering Messi was more of a second assistant to the two goals and the rest of the game was downplayed so hard.  I wasn't talking collective history between the two, and if you'd read the replies like I'd asked, you'd know that I don't compare the two completely different stages (CL and WC) to each other due to different team compositions and conditions."

I'm eager to watch Samper and Grimaldo playing for Barça; I hope they will fit perfectly for our team.   Denis Suarez will probably continue playing on loan at Sevilla and Deulofeu too may be but nothing hasn't been decided as of yet.

Interestingly, Luis Enrique didn't call Grimaldo for a single time this season even though he called player like Ie, Diagne, Camara & Gumbao. With Vermaelen fit & Adriano & Mathieu staying, it will be tough for him to get playing time."

Would be funny though if they use our dressing room, because you know how above each number's locker there is a list of all previous players that wore that shirt number? Can be quite intimidating actually.  Don't know who exactly Bilbao's #10 is but I can imagine him casually tying his shoes in the dressing room before the match, looks up and sees the list - ""Messi, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Romario, Maradona"".  - ""FUCK..."""

Barca,37l4gj,XsTream23,8,Thu May 28 16:51:49 2015 UTC,"Leo will not let us down, but I admit I particularly like how he plays when it looks like he's trying to make a point."
Barca,37l4gj,survivalothefittest,6,Thu May 28 18:29:25 2015 UTC,"I think he will be trying to make a point, in trying to win the treble as well. If that makes sense."
Barca,37l4gj,kezorN,8,Thu May 28 18:58:25 2015 UTC,i dont think messi or anyone on barca needs someone from another team to get them motivated.
Barca,37l4gj,rocksteadybebop,8,Thu May 28 18:02:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think it takes smack talking to fire him up. It just takes a big stage and worthy opponents. He is like Goku, and everybody else is Krilin."

Barca,37kx11,Illegal_sal,35,Thu May 28 11:23:08 2015 UTC,Suarez is ready. Suarez is not ready. Suarez is ready. Suarez is not ready.  I guess we won't know until the finals.
Barca,37kx11,vanNostrandby,48,Thu May 28 12:05:44 2015 UTC,Schrödinger's Suárez.
Barca,37kx11,I_am_oneiros,18,Thu May 28 12:23:22 2015 UTC,The staff is playing this so close to their chests that papers are just throwing out shit and hoping it sticks.
Barca,37kx11,rocksteadybebop,12,Thu May 28 12:02:24 2015 UTC,"We have Pedro in case Luisito is not 100% ready for CDR, id rather focus on CL but i m sure that a player of Pedro's quality can substitute Suarez with success ."
Barca,37kx11,XsTream23,6,Thu May 28 12:32:33 2015 UTC,"I dont understand why we dont put pedro on the LW, play Neymar in center, and keep messi on the right"
Barca,37kx11,CL95,1 point,Thu May 28 20:04:38 2015 UTC,"i thought of it too but Neymar body isnt really suited for that (not that Pedro is ,Suarez is the most suited for the #9 role ) but i think for his style of play he works better as a winger Taking  1 on 1 the Right Back  and after that cut inside , same goes for Messi , so its better for both of them to play on wings and letting Suarez/Pedro taking on the cb's freeing up space on wings"
Barca,37kx11,XsTream23,-2,Thu May 28 20:33:54 2015 UTC,I'd still want to see Rafinha as false 9 if Suarez can't play
Barca,37kx11,IhateAngryBirds,22,Thu May 28 13:21:41 2015 UTC,Pedro is more proven
Barca,37kx11,gblr,2,Thu May 28 13:29:33 2015 UTC,Rafinha played false 9 at Celta quite a few times and did really good
Barca,37kx11,IhateAngryBirds,27,Thu May 28 13:39:23 2015 UTC,"No time for experiments, perhaps we can try that next year."
Barca,37kx11,polechi33,6,Thu May 28 13:54:15 2015 UTC,"i know, i ve seen quite some matches of him at celta  but with xavi leaving i think we should get rafinha  used to the midfielder role more often since i have a feeling we ll need him  a LOT  more next season"
Barca,37kx11,XsTream23,3,Thu May 28 13:43:47 2015 UTC,Messi played false 9 in cup finals a few times and did really good.
Barca,37kx11,floopyloopy,2,Thu May 28 15:20:07 2015 UTC,Rafinha played on the wing mainly at Celta
Barca,37kx11,domi_28,2,Thu May 28 17:55:10 2015 UTC,Pedro scored twice last time we played Bilbao in a Cup Final.
Barca,37kx11,Epsilon76,9,Thu May 28 14:29:47 2015 UTC,That's like 3 years ago
Barca,37kx11,IhateAngryBirds,5,Thu May 28 16:01:06 2015 UTC,"That's not a fair point of comparison.  Edit: if you think that's a fair comparison then you have to acknowledge that Pedro scored more goals against Bilbao in finals than Luis Suarez. Therefore start Pedro over a healthy Suarez, right?"
Barca,37kx11,Not_Tom_Brady,6,Thu May 28 14:59:35 2015 UTC,Messi would play false 9 and Pedro would go on the right wing.
Barca,37kx11,floopyloopy,2,Thu May 28 15:19:06 2015 UTC,"Messi has not played False 9 when Pedro was in the field lately, he keeps to the wing most of the time, and Pedro is not efficient as a centre forward."
Barca,37kx11,IhateAngryBirds,9,Thu May 28 15:20:36 2015 UTC,There's no way in hell Rafinha starts over Pedro.  I don't know what else to say.
Barca,37kx11,floopyloopy,3,Thu May 28 15:27:35 2015 UTC,"and Rafinha is....  i think Pedro as CF of course is not as good as a natural #9  and we re not talking about an ordinary #9, we re talking about the Best one in Luisito.   I Think in last few games he had a more than decent performance especially in game against Atletico.   I mean he gave the winning assist ffs.  Against Depor the team didnt force that much ,was happy with a draw but Pedro did offer the Pass for Neymar which could have finished but chose to be selfess and pass to Messi. Not to say that rebounded shot that got saved by the Depor Keeper (was an amazing save tbh)"
Barca,37kx11,XsTream23,2,Thu May 28 15:53:27 2015 UTC,We might end up with another Cesc-y situation.  Our attack is fine without a false 9
Barca,37kx11,Dark-X,5,Thu May 28 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like the fact that there are not many credible transfer news happening because of the ban, has made newspapers resort to flipping coins to decide if Suarez is fit or not, but always with ""has not been ruled out""/""not entirely fit"" just in case."
Barca,37kx11,ManoloBar,4,Thu May 28 13:09:51 2015 UTC,I'm confident that a top 3 of Messi Neymar and Pedro can do the job nicely.
Barca,37kx11,Damiend,3,Thu May 28 16:10:59 2015 UTC,"If he's fit he should play.  But they need to make sure he understands if he doesn't feel right he needs to TAKE HIMSELF OUT.  Reguardless, if he does play we should tweak our tactics to turn him into a less mobile poacher.  Pedro is more than capable, but risks do have to be taken."
Barca,37kx11,gblr,3,Thu May 28 13:54:23 2015 UTC,"This worries me too, Suarez always wants to play and that might backfire. Who knew having a player that's too dedicated to the team might be a bad thing..."
Barca,37kx11,iagolima,1 point,Thu May 28 14:56:28 2015 UTC,This back and forth will keep Athletic  on their heels as far as preparation goes.

Barca,37mkok,Chunky_mono,5,Thu May 28 18:55:10 2015 UTC,Well we are no longer the Underdogs :P
Barca,37ks33,SalQ,39,Thu May 28 10:24:04 2015 UTC,"This is not another Douglas, he's a huge talent. BUT, 15m? We have many talanted midfielders around his age, and I think it would be a uneccessary transfer. Amir Nathko, Denis, Halilovic, Samper, Rafinha, Alena, Ayoub++   Also wish that if they intend to buy youth, they'd go after more spanish youth. We could've got Marco Asensio, great player for Mallorca, but Zubi didn't want to pay 3m, so Madrid got him instead..."
Barca,37ks33,Morcule,12,Thu May 28 11:40:50 2015 UTC,"And will he go straight on loan? From what I'm seeing on YouTube, he's way too good for Liga Adelante B if Barca B goes down, but not good enough for the first team."
Barca,37ks33,Harb0,7,Thu May 28 11:44:01 2015 UTC,"Probarly one season at Barcelona B to get a little barca-feel, with call-ups for the first team in easier games, and a couple training session with them a week. Then a promotion that would lead to a loan.  That seems to be the case for our talents now-a-days.   And Barca B will likely be a much better learning platform next season, if we get a Masia-caring Presidet (Laporta).  Then Vinyals will hopefully fired, and the exit of poor players like Gumbau, Patric and Dongou."
Barca,37ks33,Morcule,2,Thu May 28 12:13:09 2015 UTC,I remember the days when Dongou was considered to be the next Samuel Eto'o :/
Barca,37ks33,ChoochiPastol,0,Thu May 28 23:33:47 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen in the last La Liga game Douglas is actually pretty decent. I hope we will use him more often next year, as well as Danis, Halilovic, Samer, Rafinha and many more. Not like in the same game, but we gotta give our youngsters some play time."
Barca,37ks33,Tropicum,0,Thu May 28 11:46:19 2015 UTC,"Douglas literally did one decent thing, and that was that run. It doesn't make him a decent player. I'd prefer if we sell him, because like he showed vs Huesca (3rd div), he's not really good.  Of course you can say ''he gets little playing time'', or ''it was only one game''. But just because he's a FCB player, he don't have to be good or decent. Clearly a corrupt transfer because he was even considered average in Brazil!  I'm not the biggest fan of Montoya, but if it's one RB who deserves to play next season (if Alves leaves) then it's him.  And Denis won't return. He will stay another season at Sevilla."
Barca,37ks33,Morcule,6,Thu May 28 12:07:50 2015 UTC,"Clearly a corrupt transfer because he was even considered average in Brazil!   And the company that had his rights : Traffic, is also now in troubles cuz of the corruption thing that's going on there."
Barca,37ks33,TimeFingers,2,Thu May 28 12:24:34 2015 UTC,It would be nice to know if Traffic is involved here too.
Barca,37ks33,CorsarioNero,4,Thu May 28 14:11:09 2015 UTC,I agree with you. Douglas has no level whatsoever for Barcelona.
Barca,37ks33,EpicChiguire,9,Thu May 28 18:14:17 2015 UTC,"You judging Douglas based off of his performance against Huesca is literally the exact same thing as him judging him based off of his game against deportivo. Jokes aside, there is clearly not a single person here who thinks that he should start next season over Montoya, but we have only seen him play in 2 games so there is really no way to prove or disprove his quality. Even if he was a corrupt transfer there is no reason that he should be sold. Give the guy more opportunities to prove that he deserves to be here before claiming that he is unworthy. You can recycle the same claims that he was average in brazil all day, but I doubt that you actually watched him play before he came here. The guy went from being in Brazil to training with the world's best players every day, until we see how good or bad he really is there is no reason to sell him. Especially when you consider our lack of depth at RB for next season, not to mention the fact that he seems to get along really well with Neymar and all the other Brazilians on the team."
Barca,37ks33,pepetrillvia,-1,Thu May 28 12:19:39 2015 UTC,If we had got Asensio last year we wouldn't need to be talking about Alves replacements now.
Barca,37ks33,jairzinho,8,Thu May 28 15:36:21 2015 UTC,Asensio is a midfielder bro
Barca,37ks33,Morcule,11,Thu May 28 15:40:48 2015 UTC,"Found a highlight video. Apparently, he only turned 18 this year, which means he's born in 1997.   edit: an even better video with even shittier music!"
Barca,37ks33,Harb0,6,Thu May 28 11:42:50 2015 UTC,"He actually looks really good, he hasn't got the pace but he uses his technical skills to his advantage really well. His passing looks really good aswell."
Barca,37ks33,adamdabadboy,20,Thu May 28 12:08:38 2015 UTC,"Anyone know anything about him? Can't say I've heard of him.  I linked to Rafael and his view on whether this news is reliable or not. He linked the original tweet in his tweet.  ""Gérson's dad Marco Antônio has just publicly confirmed that there are serious negotiations involving Gérson with Barcelona. More than rumors"""
Barca,37ks33,domi_28,9,Thu May 28 10:25:30 2015 UTC,My Juventino friend just told me to F@#k off when I told him about this. He says Juve was following him for months and they think he's the next big thing in Brazil. I guess that's a good thing
Barca,37ks33,QuadriplgicLeviathan,2,Thu May 28 17:57:51 2015 UTC,He'll cool off in a week... but then the UCL final will make him hate you again.
Barca,37ks33,TimeFingers,10,Fri May 29 14:34:24 2015 UTC,"Read something about him on Mundodeportivo and someone commented this:   It is not an winger but a left-sided midfielder, high quality. Very technical, and big stride. I do not know what he would cost or fees that may have but he has quality ; indeed, physically and technically like Pogba. If Pogba costs 100 and he maybe 20 or 30, it is certain that seeing one and  the other there is less difference in quality than in price."
Barca,37ks33,Harb0,11,Thu May 28 11:49:16 2015 UTC,"Well, this isn't really fair. Gérson is born four years after Pogba, and we have no idea what Gérson will be worth four years from now. Four years ago, Pogba still played for Manchster United U18s, and had barely even featured for the senior squad. Gérson has already played 15 games for Fluminese according to Wikipedia, and Fluminese is a pretty solid team."
Barca,37ks33,TimeFingers,8,Thu May 28 11:53:27 2015 UTC,well I don't know him ... this comment was from a Mundodeportivo user ... I just watched this video
Barca,37ks33,Harb0,2,Thu May 28 12:03:39 2015 UTC,"Should've read your comment more specific, but my point still stands. I don't know if there's a similar highlight video of Pogba four years ago, but I very much doubt it's much better than what we're seeing from Gérson."
Barca,37ks33,TimeFingers,1 point,Thu May 28 14:52:01 2015 UTC,"Yea I get your point, he has talent if we get him I'm sure the club will help him to develop better."

I admit my focus is on Barcelona and I might've missed him, but I'm really concerned he might be another Douglas.  Edit: I did some googling and apparently he's got good promise, he's not just some random player, he apparently did really well in Brazil's U-20 team. It seems Juventus is interested in him as well. Anyway, we'll see how this goes."
Barca,37ks33,Aj16ay,4,Thu May 28 10:50:00 2015 UTC,"he apparently did really well in Brazil's U-20 team   Well that's a bit reasuring, wonder if he's signed for Barca B at first."
Barca,37ks33,morais96,2,Thu May 28 11:32:45 2015 UTC,"He just turned 18, I bet he goes to the B team first. Or likely will be loaned out, can't see 3rd division football helping him much"
Barca,37ks33,egzon27,4,Thu May 28 11:58:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a Fluminense and Barça fan and i believe you guys should be interested in this.  Gérson started playing for the Brazilian u-21 with only 17 yo, the youngest player in the team. He also got a spot on the Fluminense starter 11 squad in the beginning of 2015, he showed that he has potential to be a great player. He's not very fast but he's quite strong and very skillful (kinda like Toure). I think that his best attribute has to be his cleaver passing and ball control...  If you guys have any questions about him let me know.   PS: Sorry for my English. Is not very good, i know..."
Barca,37ks33,morais96,1 point,Fri May 29 02:50:21 2015 UTC,Are these rumours true?
Barca,37ks33,TweetPoster,2,Fri May 29 07:16:55 2015 UTC,Well... it seems to be. Juventus was interested in him as well. The media in Brazil claims that Barça paid €3 million to acquire a right to be first to have the chance to purchase the player in January.
Barca,37ks33,JurijFedorov,3,Fri May 29 12:37:27 2015 UTC,"@RafaelH117:   2015-05-28 09:27:36 UTC  Fluminense wanted at least €15m, and Globo is usually extremely reliable. twitter.com     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]"
Barca,37ks33,NorthwardRM,3,Thu May 28 10:24:55 2015 UTC,15 millions is a bit to much. But he is better than Douglas. He looks like a young undeveloped Pogba or Yaya Toure. But he needs more years before he van get his chance in the first team.
Barca,37ks33,droid750,5,Thu May 28 13:19:19 2015 UTC,I just feel like we have so much talent in the B team that I'm almost sure some will have to leave to develop elsewhere. Then again to be fair Douglas in his last appearance didn't look too bad. He seemed to improve over the last year a bit.
