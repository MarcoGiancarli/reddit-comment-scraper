TBY/AR are fine to cross-seed with, & you should continue to do so with new releases, but of course you'll always get to TL when there's plenty of seeds there already.  Since you have a seedbox try seeing if you can seed parts of packs, maybe cross seed the individual movies from other trackers (e.g. this-movie.rar in this-awesome-pack).  People always hit the packs (especially noobs, unfortunately) so if you do any partial seeding on a few packs with a seedbox you will build buffer.  Even more-so if the packs contain popular movies that people always download sooner or later.

If anything, this stupid policy only enables scammers to scam more people. Sell the account, password recovery, repeat.

I doubt the fact that account buyers get doubly fucked (by staff and sellers instead of just by staff) bothers the staff of those trackers.   Again, if this policy helps reducing/eliminating account selling, surely more trackers would adopt it. On the contrary, AFAIK mostly only small-time, minor trackers adopt this no email change policy.   Surely every proposition must be weighed on both its pros and cons.

Also, maintaining a tracker isn't all it's cracked up to be, it's work and it's finding nefarious ways around things like handling donations among other things. Niche trackers worry about this less, but it's better to air on the side of caution with reverse proxies, visiting the dark places of the Internet for temporary CCs to verify PayPal, getting a burner phone and keeping it inside a cage to prevent it from getting signal when you don't want it to verify PayPal. The tinfoil hat can go on for days. I'd do something else, make a new tracker code base and distribute that, it's perfect legal and it's needed. That's what we've been doing, rewriting a front end and backend for our tracker that we'll release openly. It's more fun than maintaining one that's for sure."

I know the high sentences are for commercial piracy, E.g. for people who make a lot of money from copyright infringement, but even so if it did ever get passed in parliament it would put pressure to increase other copyright infringement punishments too in order to fall in line. I wonder if even David Cameron (the UK Prime Minister) could honestly say he has never pirated anything in his life be it music, video, applications or games? Even if he owned a copied music tape in the past it counts as piracy.

trackers,3dss9p,GWiz-GGn,3,Sun Jul 19 14:50:39 2015 UTC,Reach higher user classes. I expect there'll be dedicated threads in better forums where people can offer invites - and they do so in higher user class forums due for rarity/difficulty to maintain ratio forums.  BTN still recruit but where from is not public knowledge. It's reasonable to think that they recruit only from the top (TM?) user classes. Keep enjoying and contributing to trackers and you are bound to find their thread(s) eventually.
trackers,3dss9p,richbordoni,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:21:11 2015 UTC,Thanks much!
trackers,3dss9p,richbordoni,8,Sun Jul 19 10:21:09 2015 UTC,"It's great that you want to be a part of the private tracker community and contribute, but it sorta seems that you have a skewed attitude towards it. To me your post reads like you just want to collect BTN and PTP for the sake of epeen or due to their popularity. The flags for this is the number of times you name drop the trackers you're on and your userclasses. This is doubly strange as the PU invite forums (since you claim to be a PU or similar on multiple trackers) ARE THE ABSOLUTE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR GETTING INTO OTHER TRACKERS. It's what they're designed for: so people who have established themselves as dedicated members of the tracker community can be recruited to other trackers in the hope of increasing the number of good users on each tracker. I can't understand how you think you would be able to get on to new trackers if you:   1. don't want to use the recruitment threads on trackers to other trackers 2. don't want to chat with members to make friends who could provide you with invites   Literally the only other way of obtaining an invite without doing one of those two things is to buy one, which you should know by now is the worst possible option. No staffer will recruit you if you're not active in chatting on IRC/forums because they will never see you.  For some real advice on how someone could actually improve their own standing in private trackers:   Engage in forums and IRC. Maybe IRC isn't your best option, but forums allow for slower typing and exchanges. It increases your presence and can be a great source of knowledge in just these types of things. Setting an avatar helps a lot in this, too. Use your account for torrenting: Seems obvious, but nobody wants to recruit collectors. Downloading lots and seeding lots are all you really need, but uploading new content always helps, too. Having good stats to show for your work and time is always a plus in recruitment. Ratio is not the most important thing: Made this a separate one 'cause it's one I feel is pretty important and many people don't understand. Having a ratio around 1 is great if you're active and downloading a lot. A ratio of 200 with only freeleech snatches looks like you're just gaming the system for epeen purposes. Seedtime is also much more important, which you'll see especially on trackers like BTN. Enjoy the trackers you're currently on: if you have a tracker you really like, dedicate yourself there. Post in forums, give suggestions for other users looking to reach PU where you are, upload new content, just be active. You said that you already have most of your needs/wants covered, so my best suggestion if you're looking to make a name for yourself in the tracker community is to work where you are and build yourself up there. If you're PU/elite you've already placed some groundwork, so it'll be much easier than starting somewhere new. Heck, most of the reason that I'm staff now is that I joined GGn way back when 2000 users and torrents was considered a milestone, then just chatted with people and had the time and dedication for things like uploading, pointing out bugs, helping out as FLS in support forums, then torrent moderation, and somehow ended up where I am now.   TL;DR: chat on forums/IRC, upload, seed, download, use the PU recruitment threads, but don't just do it for epeen."
trackers,3dss9p,ChurchHatesTucker,2,Sun Jul 19 03:37:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughtful reply.  I agree with everything you said and I never said I don't check recruitment threads--just that it's impossible for me to do chat and irc because of slow typing with arthritis.  I'm doing everything you say otherwise and I check the invite forums, but BTN and PTP have no presence where I am and I understand why they aren't recruiting (and I would as you say never cheat to get an invite--which would probably backfire anyway). I've also carefully given out a lot of invites to others.  I've heard everyone say just be patient and do good and things will come round--I'm just maybe wondering if they haven't turned round after a certain amount of hard work and time--maybe there's something else to try?  I was thinking of getting a friend to type for me in chat/irc but I hesitate because that would technically violate the rules too."

Honestly, if I'm interpreting your first post correctly you've only been in private trackers for 6 months, that's a pretty short time. Being patient really is your best bet now.  If forums and IRC are difficult due to arthritis, and it seems like you're on the computer a pretty good amount of time, I wonder if you've considered any sort of chat-to-text software? It would be much easier than having someone else type out everything for you and sounds like it could be applicable in other aspects of your life."

trackers,3dppvp,Kafke,0,Sat Jul 18 10:19:51 2015 UTC,I was actually about to reply to /u/Formaggio_svizzero with something along that lines. It's understandable if the release was only in vinyl (back when it was common/popular/the only thing).  But I'm talking more about music that's released now. Pretty much 99.99% of it is at some point edited/touched digitally. Which means the vinyl release is almost always a lower quality.

trackers,3dppvp,Kafke,0,Sat Jul 18 11:48:32 2015 UTC,"Ultimately the advantage of vinyl is that it's an analog format, as opposed to the modern digital format. This means that all the sound is still stored correctly and pretty much exactly the same as it's recorded (think a smooth gradient/wave as opposed to steps/stairs).  The problem is that if you have analog sound, you need to play it through solely analog means, making sure it never gets converted digitally. So from recording to playback, it all needs to be analog.  As a consumer, analog would be the ultimate version to get, as it's essentially untouched. However, if there's a digital edit somewhere along the way, that smooth analog sound gets converted into the typical digital format, and there's no point in putting that back on analog, since digital is now the better container for it.  And given that most artists now a days edit digitally anyway, or have some sort of digital interaction with the sound (be it microphones, computers, or some other thing), it's pretty much always going to be that digital format in the first place. Meaning there's no real reason to get vinyl when a CD works much better.  It's kind of like going from Wav/lossless to MP3/lossy, and then pushing it back to wav/lossless thinking it'll be better quality.  Point is, that if it's only released on vinyl, it's fine (obviously). But if it's released on both, might as well grab the CD."

trackers,3dppvp,Error400BadRequest,0,Sat Jul 18 15:21:17 2015 UTC,"Which means the vinyl release is almost always a lower quality.   Actually, no. Different mediums are mastered separately, and for most music, the vinyl release almost always of higher quality, even if the medium itself is worse.  The loudness war is to blame for that.   You get a nicer master, especially since the type of people that buy records aren't going to tolerate a bad pressing.   Some forms of music are exempt, like classical performances, simply because of elitists attitudes(not unlike vinyl) and dynamic range is so important to them that an over compressed recording wouldn't be tolerated, so the CDs are the better purchase."

And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin. However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and it's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you're wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of stuff."

Keep your account secure and don't enable those shitheads."
trackers,3dqlw4,skullmuffins,2,Sat Jul 18 14:58:26 2015 UTC,"Yup, in fact this is pretty much the only way they get into accounts on the big trackers.  It all starts with poor management of a smaller, unknown, fringe tracker with a decent user base.  Trackers that aren't the big ones (PTP, WCD, BTN, AHD, etc) but are still sort of known.  For whatever reason their database leaks.  Devs there didn't know anything about security and passwords weren't hashed and salted.  So now these people have access to a username/email list and corresponding passwords.  They just try username/password combos until they get in on the big sites.  Accounts that were successfully entered usually remain in the hackers hands for a week up to a few months.  Occasionally you see accounts trade hands right after it was breached, but more often you can see a patter of breach -> wait -> trade/hand off/sell.  They eventually sell the accounts off to other account sellers or to the final buyer.  Or they keep accessing the site periodically and send out invites."

trackers,3dqlw4,Booksaboutstuff,4,Tue Jul 21 10:52:38 2015 UTC,"I know of at least two viruses that were uploaded to trackers in order to try to steal accounts. One was when someone installed an OS that was torrented and started getting strange hit and runs on his GFT account, and the other was with BCG, but I believe /u/pjcnet should be able to describe that incident better than I can.  Long story short, people go to great lengths in order to try to steal tracker accounts."
trackers,3dqlw4,pjcnet,2,Sat Jul 18 15:43:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, in late 2013 a hacked account (an account with a stolen password logged in by an authorised user) was used to upload a game that included malware that at the time was only detected by one mainstream antivirus product, the malware totally compromised the victims PC, usually without their knowledge allowing the hacker access and control. I suspect the plan was to infect lots of members so their passwords could also be stolen and then they would probably upload more malware infecting even more members. Luckily for us we spotted it straight away and was on full alert. A couple of other hacked accounts were then also used to try and upload the malware again which I spotted immediately before they were even initially seeded. These uploaders all had their accounts suddenly logged into by an IP address in a specific part of the world, none had uploaded before and the games came with a renamed setup.exe and another smaller EXE that infected the victim before running the real installer. The couple of compromised accounts were from members who already had the malware on the their PC which I believe they got elsewhere, I sent them cleaning instructions and their accounts were obviously made secure. The attempt at infecting and compromising masses of tracker accounts fell flat on it's face before it had really started and who knows what else they would had stolen from their victims once their whole PC was compromised.  It doesn't matter how secure a site might be, there is still the chance of being compromised by keyloggers, other very nasty spyware or even malware that allows remote access to the PC unless there is advanced 2 tier security (more about this later). Also if you allow members to upload games or applications you have to be extra on the ball. Edit: Some banks and organisations use additional security that enforces an additional security check when logging in from a new IP address, E.g. a text message code to sent to a registered mobile phone which they have to confirm or sometimes it could even to their registered email address (this isn't as secure however as this could also possibly be compromised)."
trackers,3dqlw4,T0ddl3s,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:13:23 2015 UTC,"Trackers that allow everyone to upload (such as mentioned GFT), even new users, are at bigger risk ofcorse."
trackers,3dqlw4,Booksaboutstuff,5,Sat Jul 18 16:50:37 2015 UTC,"Of course they are, but what's the alternative, making a dedicated ""uploader"" class? I think I'll stick with the model used by BTN, WCD, PTP, GFT, GGn, BCG, etc. The whole idea of making it harder than nessecary for users to upload their content never really appealed to me.  Additionally, in the GFT case, no torrents were uploaded to GFT in any part of that. The user downloaded a virus from a windows 7 torrent from a different (I don't know that detail) tracker that then logged login info for GFT."
trackers,3dqlw4,pjcnet,2,Sat Jul 18 17:08:40 2015 UTC,"True and how do you earn ""uploader"" class status? By consistently uploading good quality content as one of the standard ""user"" classes.   You could restrict uploading until a person has been a member for a certain amount of time, but they could still try to upload dodgy content when they are eventually able to upload and this doesn't really help if their PC becomes compromised and they get their password stolen after they've been a member for a good while. Also this can prevent some excellent content from being uploaded and some members may not bother later if they can't upload straight away.  I don't believe the malware was initially downloaded from BCG either that allowed the hacker to compromise their account to start with."
trackers,3dqlw4,Booksaboutstuff,2,Sun Jul 19 16:42:44 2015 UTC,"Most of the trackers that I've seen that have ""uploader"" make users apply for it before those users can upload a single torrent. Additionally, those are the ones most relevant to the debate regarding whether new users should be able to upload things from the get go. Personally I believe that users should be able to upload from the start for many reasons including the ones you have pointed out.  As for the BCG malware case, I only heard it second hand, but the way I heard it was a user (either intentionally or not) uploaded a torrent with a virus, which then infected those who downloaded it and caused them to upload infected torrents. It was stopped pretty quickly though."
trackers,3dqlw4,pjcnet,2,Sun Jul 19 16:56:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I replied regarding the BCG malware case from late 2013 to you further up, but a compromised account that I believe was compromised by using malware already on their machine that they got from elsewhere was used to upload a game with the same malware attached where it was intended to infect more people to steal more accounts, and then upload more torrents to infect even more.

Most invite forum staffers and even some sellers refer people to other movie trackers instead now; saying it's not worth the hassle breaking PTP invite rules.  Also, most of the people stealing/hacking accounts were the same small group of offenders (like 5 major people, 2 of those I'd say were responsible for maybe 80% of hacked accounts).

I donated to the Year PCVIP package hoping to get rid of the begging announcements but those of us know that was not the case. They beg you even more and then say sorry you wasn't suppose to get that announcement and of course even after that we still get them. So yeah, I got suckered once."

trackers,3dkcxu,revengemaster,3,Sat Jul 18 21:35:42 2015 UTC,"Huh? I take you think I'm someone you know. Never even heard of that site you mentioned, nor have I tried to run a torrent site. I get everything I need from public and private trackers. So I'm content with what I get from what I have.  I don't need to con people of money by running a site such as Bitsoup. I actually have a great job and have no need to trouble myself in the web of lies that other sites owner do.  I'm here for one reason to enlighten the users of Bitsoup and to watch them burn in the process. Nothing more."
trackers,3dkcxu,beg4funds,-3,Fri Jul 17 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"When you get bored with this crap mate Bitsoup will still be around. Can’t see why you are so bothered, nobody  has to donate but the people who do  are doing so as they know they have a good clean site with a good structure. If the owners are making a bit of cash so what, the whole thing is illegal and everyone who ever download a pirate film is a crook, yep even you Mr Clean!!. So go to your ''great job'' and tell your work colleagues how dishonest you are, tell your family and friends you are an internet thief.  Ask your amazing brain ''am I any different from the people I accuse of dishonesty ''?"

But they don't, but consistently try to con people into paying with whining and threads, stating that they get barely by and closure is near every other day. In addition to that, they have the worst community I've every experienced, making North Korea the land of liberty and free speech in comparison - every critical member in sight is banned, every thread asking questions closed and/or removed.  It's good reddit is there to prevent people spending money on con artists without knowing - but if they'd deliberate do so, be my guest."

trackers,3dkcxu,Soupar,5,Sat Jul 18 21:53:33 2015 UTC,"Wow, right straight to personal attacks. We know you're one of the staff over at Bitsoup, You went straight to a defensive position on every post you made so far. Too bad you can't ban us from this site for speaking our minds. Anyone can see this by viewing your name and posts: revengemaster  And you're delusional, I never said I was bothered by them, I thought I made that perfectly clear in my last post to you. I will quote it for you again as I know some people are a bit slow with reading comprehension.   I'm here for one reason to enlighten the users of Bitsoup and to watch them burn in the process. Nothing more.   I don't recall ever saying I was Mr. Clean and never downloaded, I download all the time. I've even donated to public trackers as they don't beg me for it each and every time I visit their site. I even share things with my colleagues at work. What I don't do is beg them for money and cry about how badly I need money and make up excuse as to why I need it.  P2P/Torrenting is about sharing, not making money. Greedy people want to make money, people who run a torrent site for the pure satisfaction of sharing don't beg for donations multiple times a day. Specially people who've already donated to them. You'd think after we donate the begging would stop on our end, but it doesn't it remains the same. Constant begging!  The only thing I agree with you on and its only a partial agreement, They do have a clean site. As far as structure, it may have been good a decade ago, but that site is a dinosaur when it comes to friendliness and usefulness. Coding is seriously out dated and needs a little TLC, its looked the same for over 10 years now. You'd think with all the donations you guys beg for, the site would've gotten at the very least a face lift. Which doesn't cost anything, all you need is a coder, but I forgot you don't have one. You guys are bringing one in the fall...lol"

It's yet another cry wolf on top of masses of previous cry wolves, people are sick to death of listening to it, most won't believe a word they say and it's entirely their own fault.   Trust has to be earned and they have already proven that they most definitely can't be trusted with previous blatant lies I could go into and I did mention one extremely serious breach of trust on my last comment to a previous thread about them.

trackers,3dk2uj,willism,6,Thu Jul 16 22:20:42 2015 UTC,"No easy way currently, thought technically possible. uTorrent keeps all it's info in .dat files which are Bencode files. The resume.dat holds the stats on a per torrent level that you could parse regularly and get all the upload/download info for each torrent. Then settings.dat has the global stats.  The problem would be parsing the .dat files using a script and storing all that info. A quick google shows a python package that looks like it's able to parse Bencode files https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bencode/1.0.

trackers,3de62j,walter218,7,Wed Jul 15 22:33:20 2015 UTC,"A lot of other people have made good points re: HnR vs Ratio rules, and they're totally right. BTN has probably one of the strongest HnR rulesets around, and they require seeding for a long time.   But also, I think the nature of the content is relevant. A lot of people use BTN to keep up to date on currently airing TV shows. If you're a user, and you go to BTN, you likely go there to download episodes of shows that are still happening. Many users probably also do it for season packs way later, but I bet most do one or two TV shows in real time. And if you do that, two things are true:   The individual files are relatively small. Anywhere from 250MB (Last Week Tonight with John Oliver SD rip) to 1.4GB(Mr. Robot 720p rip). That's not a huge drain on your seedbox or hard drive space.  And if you're gonna watch that episode, you're definitely gonna want to come back and watch next week's episode. And so you're gonna keep seeding that file for at least a week, probably more. So when the bulk of users want to watch it, there will also be the bulk of seeders ready to serve up kickass upload speeds. As the episode gets less leechers, the seeders will also go down in turn.    Another big reason is probably that BTN has really strict class rules. It's much harder to become a Power User and Elite there than it is to become a PU or E on PtP, for instance. And also the point system is way less inflated. It takes months, if not years, of seeding to get to the point where you can invite another user or buy a class upgrade or whatever. That's just not true on PtP. With a seedbox constantly seeding 12-15 1080p movies, it takes a little less than 3 weeks to accrue the BP necessary to buy an invite."

I don't think that's necessarily true. Getting PU on BTN is just a matter of time, whereas with PTP, you actually have to upload new content, and make sure it gets approved. Most of the easy encodes are already taken care of, so one of the more straightforward ways of getting a new upload is to find an obscure DVD of a foreign language movie from ebay and upload that. In any case, that takes work and $$, which could be a significant activation energy barrier for some people.   With BTN, the easiest way to rank up is to seed the huge bluray season packs (I'm talking > 100 GB) for shit tons of points. The bonus points also get a monthly multiplier, so by month 3, you're looking at geometric returns. All you're spending is hard drive space. Then there's the snatch requirement, which I don't think is too hard either - just use the same technique as the one at EMP for maximizing bonus points."

trackers,3de62j,littleGirlsblouse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:10:46 2015 UTC,"BTN uses an alternative system of required seed time. other trackers that do have ratio requirements don't necessarily need to do that, that's just what they chose to use. I think required seed time is better than required ratio.   with required ratio, users can only download something after they've built up enough buffer, but they can't build buffer until they've downloaded torrents to seed. this catch-22 makes it harder for new users to download stuff, and deters the less-than-savvy computer users from using bittorrent. another pitfall of this system is that there is no guarantee that anyone else will download the torrent while you're seeding it, and if there are other seeders with faster internet or a seedbox, you'll have even less opportunity to regain the buffer you spent. yet another pitfall is that the required ratio only applies to your sum total of upload/download and not the individual torrents. this means that a user with a large seeding pool can afford to download a torrent and then promptly delete it, leaving the torrent with one less seeder. it also means that if you manage to download a large torrent with little activity, you'll have to wait a long time before you can download another torrent. every ratio-based tracker I've been on has had to give new users upload credit and have freeleech events to alleviate these problems.  with required seed time, users can download anything, and delete torrents once they've reached their individual goal. if no one else downloads a torrent while you're seeding it, you're not inhibited from downloading other stuff, and you're not in competition with seedboxes or people with faster internet."

And people who are annoyed will do things like throttle it to an extremely low bandwidth because they don't agree with the system.  HnR is only one way to solve retention issues. Karagarga, PTP and BTN all have reasonable HnR policies, and yet they have good retention. Why? The system was designed well. People are motivated to seed. Simple.  There are better, subtler ways to solve retention issues. Seedbonus for older torrents is one example.  You reward users for seeding long-term, you don't place unnecessarily harsh conditions on them."

trackers,3de62j,evgenetic,5,Thu Jul 16 00:17:05 2015 UTC,"ptp has a laughable retention for bigger torrents like remuxes    This is partly due to the fact that demand for remuxes is very low, since transparently encoded 1080p  versions satisfy almost everyone's quality threshold. This is why you see the GP torrents get so heavily seeded (that plus the double points don't hurt either).  Remuxes are just too big to be worth it for most people. IMO, if increasing retention for those is a desirable outcome, maybe something like THC's where torrents with less than 5 seeders become freeleech till there are 5 could work. PTP could restrict this only to remuxes and full bluray images to help retention. I am sure there would be a lot of people out there who'd want those gazillion bonus points you'd get from seeding those huge files."
trackers,3de62j,FapsAllTheTime,2,Thu Jul 16 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"On a tracker that is not ratioless, I think it is best to have both a bonus point multiplier and a seeding multiplier for torrents with few seeders. So you get X times the number of bonus points AND you get X times the number of bytes uploaded for the torrents with few seeders. Without the seeding multiplier, some people will throttle the upload speed on the torrents. But with a large enough seeding multiplier, people will want to upload as many bytes as they can, since they get X times the return per byte seeded.  Which brings me to my next thought. I like ratioless trackers, but if a ratioless tracker is having difficulty keeping older torrents well-seeded (and not throttled on the upload), then perhaps a compromise is in order. Have ratio requirements, but relaxed. Rather than having a requirement of ratio greater than 1, try something lower, like 0.5 or even 0.25. WCD's system of lowering required ratio if you seed back more is decent, but complicated, and probably not workable for movie trackers where the files are much larger. But just doing something simple like lowering the required ratio from 1.0 to 0.5 may be a good compromise rather than going ratioless, which might not work well for movie trackers."

trackers,3de62j,evgenetic,6,Wed Jul 15 22:18:55 2015 UTC,"No. A month-long HnR wouldn't help much. For something that's 5 years old, you'd need a 5 year HnR time to make sure there's retention.  The problem is incentivizing users to perma-seed stuff they like, NOT forcing people to seed the latest release for an additional 2 weeks. Seed bonus helps with this.  Some trackers also have an ""average time seeded"" and/or ""average amount seeded"" requirement for advancing userclasses. This encourages people to keep seeding what they have."
trackers,3de62j,Dark-tyranitar,-4,Wed Jul 15 23:49:59 2015 UTC,"No. A month-long HnR wouldn't help much. For something that's 5 years old, you'd need a 5 year HnR time to make sure there's retention.   the idea behind longer minimum seed time is that you can sort of entrap more people into seeding things. it's not linear as you portray it, it's probabilistic, if that's the right term. you have a much higher likelihood to pass the torch before it fades (for torrent to get snatched and be seeded for another month) when you have a bigger minimum seeding window to begin with."
trackers,3de62j,evgenetic,2,Thu Jul 16 00:05:49 2015 UTC,You're really digging yourself a hole here. 1 month seed requirement is ridiculous.
trackers,3de62j,thepipebomb,-1,Thu Jul 16 07:43:29 2015 UTC,"people on wcd seed for years, I'm not proposing anything that otherworldly."
trackers,3de62j,evgenetic,2,Thu Jul 16 11:01:46 2015 UTC,"They do that voluntarily. If you force people to seed everything for such long periods, people are going to resent it."
trackers,3de62j,Dark-tyranitar,-2,Thu Jul 16 11:51:22 2015 UTC,"lol, not at all, without seedbox you have to seed everything forever on wcd or otherwise you won't be able to download. that's not what i'd call voluntarily."
trackers,3de62j,evgenetic,3,Thu Jul 16 13:25:44 2015 UTC,"It's voluntary. If you have a seedbox, you can hop on freeleech for a week and then delete it. If you don't have a seedbox and don't want to get one, you have to seed for longer. You still have a choice.  The current system on WCD gives people a choice. Think about it - if everyone on WCD was required to seed long-term, then the people with slow connections would never get any upload. Even on the old torrents, people with seedboxes will get better peering and upload speeds.  There are people who perma-seed, and people who don't perma-seed. If you try to force users to follow weird rules, then people will invariably cheat or game the system (or worse, leave your tracker)."

trackers,3dei9x,mogoxx,2,Wed Jul 15 23:51:06 2015 UTC,The .nfo of the proper or repack is suppose to state the reason the other copy was nuked. That's a scene rule. If you search corrupt or cburns pre db you can find the reason as well.

I mean, a special occasion is nice, but sometimes it's just because it stirs up tracker activity.  I mean, who really needs an excuse to throw a party?  A site wide freeleech allows users to grab things they were otherwise unable to due to ratio constraints and, conversely, seed the crap out of those things and gain ratio.  Sometimes a site can stagnate with everyone with files and ratio never getting leeches and everyone without ratio never being able to download anything. Site wide freeleech stirs it up, redistributes ratio, and generates internal interest, often in things you'd never otherwise think of grabbing.  Call it 'ratio armistice day'."

trackers,3dap44,BlxckLikeMe,22,Tue Jul 14 20:28:02 2015 UTC,"If you know go and are able to extend chihaya to dump the stat diff's into a table compatible with gazelle, i would probably recommend trying it, its much more well written than ocelot is and much nicer to use otherwise (coding/deployment/etc). Basically chihaya doesn't write stats anywhere permanently by default, you must implement this interface if you expect it to work on a private site. I would argue that Go as a language is MUCH easier to grok and extend for people who don't know C/C++ and are more used to php/python. Afaik there is no complete chihaya->gazelle module/interface made public yet. I believe this runs on windows too, which could be good if your dev's are windows based, but a minor point.  If you don't want to do that just stick to ocelot for now, it is more tailored to private sites than chihaya is anyways. Doesn't support ipv6/udp though. This is for sure the simplest solution if you are using gazelle and not a experienced coder.   I've actually worked on ocelot quite a lot. My fork has a generic db interface now to support postgres, thorough instrumentation, sentry support, and a few other performance/optimization tweaks plus a total overhaul of the code style to something not insane. Even with all this I would still take something else though given the option.   FWIW, i have also written a tracker in go as well (not based on chihaya), its tailored to private sites though. Its currently being used for ToTV and will be available here soon: https://github.com/ToTV/mika . It handles things like bonus point calculations in realtime instead of batches to ease load. Additionally it does not use SQL backends, its a write-only redis backed system which exposes a json api so the frontend can communicate with it. So far this system benchmarks quite a bit faster and with more consistent response times (especially in go1.5).  If you have any more specific/detailed questions let me know."
trackers,3dap44,totv_toor,2,Tue Jul 14 21:53:26 2015 UTC,"redis is in-memory right? I guess it could scale (eg. for something the size of what) with big RAM servers being cheap enough these days, but wonder if it's really necessary. What are your thoughts on recent Postgres releases with JSON support?"
trackers,3dap44,puzzlingcaptcha,3,Wed Jul 15 10:07:22 2015 UTC,"The redis active dataset needs to fit into memory, yes. However, it uses a relatively small amount which is quite manageable, even when scaled up since i make effort to only store small and required values. Redis is also backed to disk periodically, and is the primary store for the torrent stats.  Postgres is fantastic, but i don't think the JSON(B) columns are very helpful for the tracker itself. There is a lot of utility when using them for a web front end though for example user settings data can be a good use of jsonb columns. Still, if you know your data model and it will remain basically static, stick to standard column types. JSON(B) attributes are mostly useful for columns that could contain user or more freeform data. Essentially, don't try and recreate a document store like mongo using pg+JSONB and you be good."

trackers,3d9gx3,member122,6,Tue Jul 14 15:25:31 2015 UTC,"FLAC and DTS-MA both are lossless formats so rest assured there is no loss of quality either way. Only question that remains is one of device compatibility as FLAC seems to be a bit lacking there.  For stereo and mono tracks, FLAC usually compresses very well over DTS-MA or even the lossy core for that matter, and is thus preferred for encodes/remuxes and such. Differences are marginal for 5.1/7.1 tracks.  If you want the raw stream itself, you can always convert your FLAC or DTS-MA track to pcm wav with something like eac3to."
trackers,3d9gx3,BartonJunior,3,Tue Jul 14 15:45:48 2015 UTC,I guess my question would be why would you take a DTS-HD MA track and create a flac file? So if I have a bluray that has several audio tracks and one of them is DTS-HD MA why would I eac3to a flac file? That is what appears to be happening for the remuxes I'm referring to.
trackers,3d9gx3,BartonJunior,7,Tue Jul 14 16:31:01 2015 UTC,"The size differences between FLAC and DTS-MA for a stereo or mono track can be enormous. I've seen FLAC compress anywhere between 3-7 times over DTS-MA for 16 bit audio and somewhat less for 24 bit.  If you're preparing the remux for playback on a PC, FLAC would clearly be the way to go.  For 5/7.1 tracks, the size differences between DTSMA and FLAC are minimal and don't really warrant a conversion unless the track on the BD was raw pcm to begin with."
trackers,3d9gx3,BartonJunior,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"Right, but then it's not really a remux? Chalk this up to my ignorance in audio containers/codecs. On the physical disc the audio files are in what container, or what extension? With a program like MakeMKV you are remuxing the m2ts (h264,MPEG-4, etc) file with the audio file (DD, DTS, LPCM, etc). So these remuxes I'm seeing with flac in the name have been converted into that format from the original DD/DTS/LPCM container? I'm just trying to understand. I just want what is on the disc and before I download a large file I want to make sure it is source."
trackers,3d9gx3,hghh,3,Tue Jul 14 16:58:03 2015 UTC,"In case of video, merely the container is changed. (usually mkv), codec remains the same (mpeg-4/avc).  Audio can be converted from lossless to lossless, depending on what suits best.  The conversion between formats, such as pcm -> flac or dts-ma -> flac is lossless so you're essentially getting what was on the Bluray/Source itself. Put your mind to ease about this. Just make sure the remuxing process itself is thorough (like in case of dts-ma, using a dts decoder is important so that it's not the lossy core that ends up getting transcoded)  No conversion should be done for lossy formats however, such as DD/AC3 as you mentioned and they should be passed through as is."
trackers,3d9gx3,312c,4,Tue Jul 14 17:04:16 2015 UTC,"Groups from HDBits use FLAC for their remuxes, even when there's 5.1 or 7.1 audio. Groups from AHD and elsewhere use FLAC only on mono/stereo tracks, but keep DTS-HD MA for the surround main audio.  FLAC is more efficient than DTS-HD MA, so you save a bit on the filesize, but you sacrifice hardware compatibility with it. You can bitstream DTS-HD MA, but not FLAC.  In either case though, your audio is not being touched, just converted to a different codec, losslessly. You can choose what you want, so just get what you most prefer, based on what your setup can play."
trackers,3d9gx3,kotekzot,2,Tue Jul 14 22:15:31 2015 UTC,"Usually this is done when the audio is LPCM, as flac is far more efficient at compression and maintains the exact same data"
trackers,3d9gx3,upinthecloudz,3,Tue Jul 14 15:40:25 2015 UTC,FLAC is a lossless codec.
trackers,3d9gx3,1260540811,2,Tue Jul 14 15:37:35 2015 UTC,The 'remux' refers to the video stream being repackaged into a new container but otherwise untouched. On some trackers a flac conversion is used for the audio because it's easier to play back on PC with free programs and identical in audio quality to the original DTS-HD MA.

trackers,3d8fn1,T0ddl3s,-19,Tue Jul 14 10:15:00 2015 UTC,"Dying trackers is not good for anything. What you do get is a centralized tracker system where more and more focus can be put on fewer trackers rather than hiding in the masses.   it's an absolutely great thing for users. less trackers=less content fragmentation, better retention and speeds and so on, no need to be registered in 20 trackers to get the stuff one needs.    there's no such thing as hidden trackers, this subreddit is completely public, everyone who needs to know of trackers' existence already knows it. centralized trackers are in more danger of being chased by copyright but backing up stuff and moving to different servers is not that huge of a deal for competent admins."
trackers,3d8fn1,evgenetic,5,Tue Jul 14 12:47:04 2015 UTC,"Less bigger trackers might be good for some members, although many members prefer a smaller and friendlier community where they can make closer friends, it's not just about filesharing. It's also easier for anti copyright infringement organisations as they have fewer and bigger trackers to concentrate their resources on and they're also more likely to have a bigger case against them. The bigger the tracker the harder they can fall and there's also more to lose. You might argue that competent admins can move to different servers Etc to avoid being shut down, but ultimately if they keep playing cat and mouse from authorities they are ultimately risking very serious prosecution that could even end with a prison sentence. In a lot of ways a more sensible admin (well owner) will shut down the site and tracker before it comes to the serious prosecution stage, many private trackers have shut down before the sh*t really hits the fan and usually the owner will then avoid punishment or even if there was still a prosecution it would be a lot less severe.  If there's lots of smaller trackers and they knock one out then at least there are always others that can fill the gaps and new trackers can also flourish."
trackers,3d8fn1,pjcnet,-4,Tue Jul 14 14:54:31 2015 UTC,"if hundreds of small trackers wouldn't be so busy competing and instead consolidated their trackers AND their efforts for anti-copyright trolling measures the users would have benefited hugely and they would be much more secure.    there is some truth in the ""not keeping all eggs in one basket"" argument, but keeping them in HUNDREDS of baskets is just stupid and counterproductive."

I think they will take the last of these last hope donations and part ways with the users.  GFT is a shame to see go because they always had such good coverage of scene spam; the best. Scene trackers have been going the way of the dodo from last year. The trend in private BT is away from scene and towards P2P groups.
trackers,3d8fn1,ShameAboutTheFace,16,Tue Jul 14 09:50:45 2015 UTC,"Not really, they have taken a sudden loss by having their funds and main donation method suspended when these funds would had usually paid the server fees. In an emergency they have quickly setup a temporary Bitcoin donation method instead with only a very limited time to replace some of the funds that were lost. If they survive in the short term it will give them time to setup a better alternative donation method where more members will start donating again and hopefully enough will come in again each month for long term survival. GFT might not be as popular as it used to be, but it's still a good tracker that deserves to survive."
trackers,3d8fn1,pjcnet,2,Tue Jul 14 18:27:06 2015 UTC,"Almost majority of trackers face this, which depends on many factors. IMO these are few:   Community: In this things like how friendly staff, active community, no of torrents, active interactions in forums & IRC, extra features to adhere users, layouts etc matters. Types of users: Person is actually on X number of similar tracker (this will result in low active users unless the tracker is out of crowd or have something to offer while others not), and don't forget we are humans. Methods: eg. If you only offer bitcoin, you will loose other members who use only Paypal   So, what we can do?   If you it's affordable then support. Have blazing UP speed? Race them up and seed for others like you. Creative? Let admin's know how you can improve and support in any way. (Beware they are mostly busy, so knock them first ; )   Happy Sharing!"

trackers,3d8fn1,thepipebomb,2,Tue Jul 14 09:34:11 2015 UTC,Sadly they've been in trouble almost on a monthly basis trying to find donation to cover costs. Fact is most people use trackers without much concept of the time or money required to run them. where GFT is small that becomes harder as they don't have the userbase to support it.
trackers,3d8fn1,Gh0stnet,4,Tue Jul 14 12:07:14 2015 UTC,"They also don't have anything I can't find elsewhere. TSH is as fast or faster on pretimes and they have more p2p. BTN is better for tv, PTP for movies, ect.  GFT was one of my first trackers many years ago, but if they can't afford to keep it going they should just shut down. Don't expect people to continue to donate to a site that doesn't fill any niche and isn't even the top tracker at what they do. Staff there doesn't have the greatest reputation either.  Just my 2 cents."
trackers,3d8fn1,thepipebomb,8,Tue Jul 14 15:06:49 2015 UTC,"It'd be a shame to see them go, ratioless trackers are rare and from a user perspective especially on smaller trackers not having that as a worry is a huge plus.

He was the only staff at any tracker where they handled bans correctly. They saw that another tracker had sent a gban, disabled me, responded with everything they knew (including what the gban said against me, which is great as no other tracker would even tell me what I was accused of), interviewed me and the staff member at another site who had issued the ban, researched the details personally, and then said I was okay and gave me my account back after apologizing for any inconvenience. I believe they even convinced the mod there to recall the ban, as the next time I spoke to him he said he misunderstood things and let me back in. For anyone wondering, I wasn't guilty of really anything save misunderstanding a part of the rules that was poorly phrased.  Every other site refused to inform me of the details of said ban, and just said something like ""well don't do anything here and you'll be fine"", which kinda makes a gban worthless, and counts a bit of a security risk IMHO.  With that said, the staff there do ""joke around"" and might offend some users. I can easily understand where some users might get the wrong impression from that. However, when it comes to stuff that really matters, they do a very good job."
trackers,3d8fn1,Booksaboutstuff,2,Tue Jul 14 21:34:16 2015 UTC,Paypal isn't a viable option for trackers it follows no banking laws at all and can freeze or enforce foolish rules and standards on you for some very arbitrary reasons. For the average person paying for ebay items it is seamless but for things that rely on it they are a good processor. I deal with them for work and they are a huge pain in the ass so imagine how it is on the tracker level where it's legal standing is questionable at best. Try reading the paypalsucks website you'll get an idea what people using them as a gateway go through.  As to the staff are asshole most users can't tell you even who staff are so to form an opinion typically you run afoul of the rules in some way.

trackers,3d8fn1,Gh0stnet,-3,Tue Jul 14 16:15:02 2015 UTC,"We will most probably never really know whether opening signups was a major contributing factor or not, but you shouldn't really had been severely voted down as you have been so far at the time of writing as it is very possible. Open signups are risky in a lot of ways for private trackers and I personally hate opening, but sometimes it can become necessary if referrals alone or other recruiting methods aren't enough to sustain the number of active members against natural wastage. When you open signups you can gain weeks of referrals in a relatively short time, but the problem is who are you letting in? Not only is open signups a moderator's nightmare, but obviously it can be much worse as it can advertise an opening for anyone who has negative intentions towards the site and all private trackers have enemies.  Edit: PS: I'm interested to know why people have brutally voted konsta22 down to -8 at the time of writing for his comment above, while I'm voted to -3 for agreeing with some of it. I know as a senior member of staff at a popular private tracker that open sign ups really do increase the risk of something negative happening to a private tracker and there's been times where I have strongly suspected incidents wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for open sign ups just before, so why do people seem to disagree with that?

I say it varies greatly as if you've been taking on more members you are likely to also lose more, especially if there's been open sign ups as some will join and then not use their account after perhaps downloading 1 or 2 torrents. The time of the year can also have an impact and obviously how popular the site currently is makes a big difference, if a site is very sought after and it's very hard to get an invite more members are likely to value their account and will try to hang onto it.

If you want to download like a movie now you get in an easy to join tracker , you get your movie and in 10-20min you watch  it, you don't have to WAIT months , BUY a seedbox , download music you DON'T want cause their freeleech and after all that Finally get your movie and get to watch it.  There are easier legit ways to get invites  and get your content(OTHER than music, but even music most of the stuff is on rutracker anyway).

You can get in via the interview channel immediately (for most other good private trackers, you need to wait for open signup or you need an invite from somebody) What.CD has an extensive Wiki system (hundreds of articles to read) which covers many area of bittorrent and private trackers including the basic and advance bittorrent techniques, Thanks to their dedicated staffs and dedicated team members. You will learn a lot of useful stuffs that you probably can't find anywhere else. What.CD has one of the best bittorrent communities, The forums and irc are very active. you will get help from other users/staffs almost immediately if you ask on the forums or irc help channel. What.CD has one of the best invite forums so it's your gateway to other great trackers."

Then grab on and ride the wave. But be patient. That's all. And start uploading stuff so you'll get to PU. Ebooks are easiest and least competitive in my opinion.

Usually when you're kind and are giving invites out generously to everyone, it'll come back and bite you in the ass, sooner rather than later.  I gave a redditor an invite to a very good music tracker, because I was in a generous mood, and the guy simply used it for a hit and run venture.

The interface is pretty much the same & it's actively maintained. 2.2.1 is lacking in some really basic features that I really wish I had at this point, i.e. being able to rename specific files inside a torrent, being able to add a ""path"" column to the torrent list, etc. If I weren't 5000+ torrents deep on my uTorrent list, I would have switched a long time ago.  If you insist upon using uT 2.2.1, BACK UP %appdata%\uTorrent DAILY. Last year my resume.dat got corrupted without warning and I lost my entire 4200+ torrent list. Just shut down the client one day & when I loaded it back up, poof. List is gone. Not only did my resume.dat get corrupted, but so did the backup that uTorrent automatically generates (resume.dat.old).  Because of this I've set up a free program called FreeFileSync to mirror my %appdata%\uTorrent folder to two other hard drives daily. I had to learn the hard way. Don't make the same mistake as me.

trackers,3d4b6n,pjcnet,4,Mon Jul 13 17:42:44 2015 UTC,"No you are putting words into my mouth, but the way the Human Development Index is calculated is determined by a complex algorithm that they decide, if they varied the algorithm or used different statistical data the outcome can be altered to show results closer to what they want to portray, this is the nature of statistics. Governments doctor statistics all the time even though they try to pass them off as actual fact, a government's statistical figures can often appear very different to the figures that an opposition party will portray. In this case the Education Index is calculated using adult literacy as one of the important factors and this is then used in the main formula, but they could have made adult literacy more or less of a determining factor in the formula, also different types of data could have been used instead or as well that might have been better or worse in specific countries to modify the overall outcome while still being just as convincing and I'm sure there's many different experts that would have calculated the value in different ways. Also how did they measure adult literacy in the first place as this alone is a statistical figure that could be doctored? For instance what determines whether an adult is literate or not, you could say someone is literate if they can read and write a very basic sentence, or you could state that they're not literate unless they can write a 1000 word essay with hardly any punctuation or grammar mistakes, but each method of determining adult literacy will produce very different results.  There are so many things you could doctor with a complex statistical formula like this that has so many statistical figures used within it. You couldn't go to the extreme of making a 3rd world country look more developed than for instance the USA, but you could alter it enough to make the gaps look different and perhaps to change around the positions of countries that are not so far apart in the table. Also the way the data is collected to be used in statistical data can be doctored in various different ways.  Edit: Finally I ask how many people truly fully understand the formula or even look at the formula when presented with the results? What is the Human Development Index? To most it's just a figure that they are expected to simply trust, but if people don't totally understand how it's calculated and also exactly how all the data has been collected they are just taking their word for this ""magic"" calculation."
trackers,3d4b6n,312c,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:54:41 2015 UTC,"i don't quite follow you, that index is calculated in an identical way for each participating country. it's a simple formula based on life expectancy, education and gni per capita. and those are naturally derived from the data that the local institutions collect and provide, but you have to trust the un people that they have the means to determine whether they are given proper and credible data or some forgery. i mean, everything can be doctored and faked, i could be a ukranian, 50 y/o, pedophile preying on young torrent users who frequent this reddit, but you know, it's unlikely, as UN is unlikely to use seriously poor or doctored data. making a sandwitch would be a hell of a scary ordeal if you'd mistrust the people who are responsible for its ingredients.

You would need to be fluent in fairly advanced mathematics to understand all of it properly.   but you have to trust the un people that they have the means to determine whether they are given proper and credible data or some forgery.   In the same way as we trust Governments to give us accurate statistics which opposition parties often disagree with. Anyway they   probably are trying to be accurate in this case, but the way it's calculated is just one of many possible ways something like this could be calculated and measured, and as I said before I'm sure many different experts would have calculated it in different ways.

This should solve 90%+ of issues with folder structure, naming etc. https://github.com/JohnDoee/autotorrent  for the on-complete to start cross-seeding, look at rTorrent and events. setup, autodl on all sites you want to x-seed, dl auto from primary first, it grabs + loads torrent torrent completes, autodl picks up the same release, but you have delays set before it loads it into rTorrent/uTorrent. Use autotorrent to add those torrent files and x-seed  macguffin is used for auto-uploading, are you uploading or just x-seeding?  folder / naming structure, rely on autotorrent again."

trackers,3czmcd,johndoeez,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:19:13 2015 UTC,"so yeah the formatting of the post sucks so it may have lost a bit in translation, for instance in the first section point 3-6 are sub points to point 2.... Anyways so right now I don't have any auto-downloads, I do cross-seed but everything is done manually. as for the windows box, it's purely a jumpbox at this point to load the .torrent files. What I would like to do is automate as much as possible the downloads, automate cross-seeding for both archived and extracted torrents , and automate uploads if possible."
trackers,3czmcd,restlessyet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:16:11 2015 UTC,"i can highly recommend you to setup nginx and php on your rtorrent box and then set up the rutorrent webui, its very similar to utorrent and has alot of addons. for security i recommend a self signed certificate and httpauth. you can then upload torrents manually via the webinterface. you could also mount the ftp watch directory to your local machine with some proprietary tools so you dont have to ftp manually all the time.  if you actually want do autodl then install autodl-irssi, most good trackers have an irc channel listing new torrents for this. there's also a rutorrent addon for it available to fully configure it.  for extracting etc. just take a look at the rtorrent postprocessing options, should feature everything you need and there are plenty of examples available on the net  edit: for cross seeding you could just change the tracker url in the active torrent via rutorrent."

trackers,3cwxpv,sapiophile,-1,Sat Jul 11 16:07:24 2015 UTC,First thing that comes to mind is businesses should be using an internal CA that of course will be self signed and not automatically trusted. Normally you would push trust for that out by policy though.  Also any personal site can have a self signed and it really doesn't matter if you verify it as it doesn't have anything of importance to MITM from it. Though nowadays you can get trusted certs for free so that isn't a major problem now.
trackers,3cwxpv,Balmung,2,Sat Jul 11 17:29:59 2015 UTC,"businesses should be using an internal CA that of course will be self signed and not automatically trusted.   Actually, it will be automatically trusted if it's deployed properly, by adding the business's own CA cert as a part of the OS on the business's workstations. To the user (on one of the business's workstations), the site will work and verify just like any other TLS site, with no warning or interruption of any kind, and that's good.   any personal site can have a self signed and it really doesn't matter if you verify it as it doesn't have anything of importance to MITM from it   Errr, wat? That's quite a bold claim. How can you know if ""doesn't have anything of importance?"" What if it's some free software developer offering downloads of a program they wrote - without a good chain of Trust, a MITM could insert malware into the downloads offered and own all the visitors' computers. And of course that's just one of a thousand possible problems with assuming ""it really doesn't matter.""  The fact is that a TLS trust warning absolutely does invite MITM attacks, and if you don't understand why or how, or why that can be a serious problem, then I invite you to learn more about how the HTTPS PKI works, and what a Key Substitution attack is and how Key Trust works in general."

trackers,3d0xcx,watrutalkingaboot,2,Sun Jul 12 16:29:19 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'll try to answer your questions based on the benefit of the private tracker community:   The ideal ""good ratio"" is any ratio that is close to 1.0 with enough buffer for future use. This is quite difficult for most users since maintaining a higher or lower ratio is usually a lot easier. If your ratio is a lot lower than 1.0, you download a lot more than you upload. Your download privilege might be disabled or your account disabled if no improvement within a period of time. If your ratio is a lot higher than 1.0 with more than enough buffer for future use, you are seeding too much or your download is too low. Download is important for other users in private trackers (esp trackers that you can't pay for your upload credit), you help other people maintaining their ratio if you download more. If your ratio is too high or you have too much buffer than you can use in the next few years, you should stop seeding the torrents that already seeded to > 1:1 and still have many seeders (popular torrents) but you continue to seed the torrents that have small seeders (not so popular torrents) Be prepared to keep and seed everything you download as long as you can especially the older torrents with low seeders. Ideally build a home seedbox with big storage space and seed 24/7, reseed when people need the files that you download, and try to upload new torrents or fill the requests. Commercial seedbox is usually not needed. I am a member of the trackers in the picture for only 1 year but I will continue to seed as long as these trackers exist http://i.imgur.com/PDVVod7.png"
trackers,3d0xcx,javcz,4,Sun Jul 12 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"1) As /u/Pikashou/ said, depends on which tracker you are. Most private trackers require at least 1.0 ratio (you have uploaded as much as you have downloaded). At least I would try to keep my ratio at 2.0.  2) Seedbox, especially if you don't have a good internet speed."

trackers,3d0xcx,bearigator,3,Sun Jul 12 17:05:36 2015 UTC,"Seedbox is a torrenting remote machine, where you can download torrent usually higher speeds than your home internet connection.

trackers,3d0xcx,Shepherd7X,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:17:47 2015 UTC,"For someone starting out in trackers I have to ask a newbie question.   Recently my usenet system has become unreliable because of missing articles, so I have come back to torrents. I have an annual subscription to PIA (VPN). Other than bandwidth considerations, why pay the cost for a seedbox when you can use a VPN for what I would imagine as better security from an IP logging standpoint?"
trackers,3d0xcx,sharkaccident,2,Mon Jul 13 13:11:49 2015 UTC,"One of the main reasons to consider a seedbox is for seeding. It will run 24/7 with an insanely fast upload speed, so keeping ratio will be a lot easier with a seedbox than a home computer."
trackers,3d0xcx,Shepherd7X,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:36:34 2015 UTC,"Because most private trackers ban IPs connected to PIA and other VPNs. They do this to prevent account sharing, promote seedboxes(which are faster), and eliminate banned users from coming back. Anonymizing your IP pretty much goes against everything private trackers value. With a seedbox, it's not your IP, but it's still just ONE IP address attached to you.  Also, seedboxes provide a whole litany of excellent automation features. For example, I have these two programs called CouchPotato and SickRage running on my mediaPC, and so I can basically type in any movie or TV show name, and they'll automatically find a corresponding torrent with the right quality on one of my private trackers, DL that torrent, and upload it to my seedbox via BTsync. My seedbox then downloads it lickity split, and copies it to a new folder named ""Completed"" or something like that. Then BTsync syncs it back to my media PC, and CP and SR move the files and format them nicely into my library folder hierarchy. The seedbox will also then wait until I've seeded the file for long enough or for enough ratio, and then remove it, creating space for incoming torrents. It pretty much automates the entire process, and I can be hands off.  I just type in a movie/TV show name, come back in 20 minutes, and it's ready to watch on my living room flatscreen in 1080p with 5.1 surround sound. Amazeballs.  Welcome to the future"
trackers,3d0xcx,_Shibboleth_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:29:26 2015 UTC,How do seedboxes address anonymity? I would be concerned about leaving downloaded trails of information that lead back to you.
trackers,3d0xcx,sharkaccident,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:01:19 2015 UTC,"So since most seedboxes are in european countries that couldn't give a rat's ass about US copyright law, they don't have to respond to subpoenas.   Here's a more detailed primer on how the production company's lawyers would go about investigating you, if you use a seedbox on a private tracker.   They'd have to get in the tracker in the first place, or flip someone who's in the tracker. Then they'd have to seed/leech enough to stick around, and also collect IP addresses from torrents of their choosing. This alone would be very difficult, seeing as they'd have to balance getting the torrents they're interested in while also keeping a S/L ratio and not seeding torrents that aren't their company's intellectual property. Then they'd have to take those IP addresses, and run them through a database/IP reverse lookup to see where they are and what Internet Service Provider they're associated with. At this point, if you're just seeding from home, you're boned. They have your IP, they have what Internet Service Provider you use, and they can send letters to that ISP requesting you be fined or kicked off the network or whatever. But usually there's like a 5 strike policy (see here), like with Comcast. But comcast will willingly give up your name, address, etc. to the lawyers, and they /could/ sue you. They probably won't, but they could. If you're using a seedbox, though, the IP address reverse lookup would just return your seedbox's company. And since that company is incorporated in the Netherlands or Denmark or wherever, they don't have to comply to the subpoena for your information, and they won't have any deals with any companies to give you 5 strikes. They're not a part of the Copyright Alert System. They won't say jack. And so if you're the lawyer, what can you do now? You could subpoena the ISP of the Seedbox company, who probably wouldn't comply anyway. And what would that give you? Packets. Pieces of data that are going between you and the Seedbox. But if you're using BTsync, via SFTP, those packets are encrypted. It just looks like you're exchanging data, but they would have no way of proving what kind of data, or whose data. They couldn't prove in court that you're downloading or viewing their movies. And if the european ISP won't comply, then they have no way of getting the packet data in the first place. (SFTP is File Transfer Protocol based upon SSH public key encryption, so it's very very secure. Snowden leaks showed that the NSA can sometimes crack it, but they'd need a national security letter first. And your client/server exchange would have to be out of date, or you'd have to be using less than 256 bit encryption keys, which is unlikely.) You could also subpoena the private tracker, who would say ""fuck you."" You could also go for the state-side angle, and request the many ISPs in the US give the RIAA or the MPAA the data of any users that are regularly using FTP or SFTP. But why would the ISPs comply? There's no legal compulsion in this case, there's no habeas corpus of evidence showing they've done anything wrong or that their users have. And even if they did turn over your packet data simply because you do SFTP on a daily basis, what does that mean? You could be running a totally legitimate scientific data sharing enterprise. Or putting your family videos on a server in the cloud. SFTP is a hilariously common protocol. It's not identifiable traffic like bittorrent. It's not even suspicious. They could also massively subpoena every credit card processor looking for anyone who has done business with the seedbox company, but what does that prove? They can't prove YOU personally have downloaded THEIR movie, because there's this big black box of which IP is which seedbox is paid for by which credit card. Because the Seedbox company doesn't have to respond to subpoenas. And paying a seedbox company money, in and of itself, is not illegal.   So basically, seedboxes are just another layer of security, that is /basically/ impenetrable with current copyright statutes. They can't prove that you ever actually possessed their copyrighted material, because the IP addresses associated with the traffic are useless, and the mechanism by which the movies are transferred to your home is heavily encrypted."

trackers,3d0xcx,sharkaccident,2,Wed Jul 15 19:07:35 2015 UTC,"1) You should try to upload as much as you download 1:1,anything above that is a plus not a must.  2) You don't need a seedbox, you don't even need to have a great connection. What you want is to join a tracker that suits your needs. If you have a slow connection there are plenty of great ratioless trackers."
trackers,3d0xcx,Arguti,0,Sun Jul 12 18:29:25 2015 UTC,"good for you is usually above 1 or whatever is above the minimum tracker requirements so that you'll be allowed to download stuff. good for other people on the tracker is something different entirely, if you'll bring some rare, high quality movie to the tracker but download some 150gb blu-ray hobbit trilogy your ratio will plummet, but the hobbit trilogy is something you can get pretty much everywhere and the film your brought is a rare thing. so you can see that ratio doesn't necessarily show how beneficial of a user you are.   that you may not need the hassle of private trackers at all as open, public trackers such as rutracker will most certainly cover pretty much everything you may ever need. in general small private tracker are a pretty dumb thing as they basically misuse the torrent technology that's all about sharing the load and instead they put a lot of burden on a small amount of users (you can already see the suggestions to buy seedboxes, hdd space and other expenses of time and/or money) instead of relying on a big number of users that will both guarantee speed and content retention."
trackers,3d0xcx,evgenetic,-5,Sun Jul 12 22:13:25 2015 UTC,"1) Depends on which tracker you are. A good share ratio is like 5 on IpTorrent (or more if you want, it is really easy to get a good ratio on this one), but 1.5 on What.CD (for a weekly use).  2) Spend money or not for seedbox or/and internet speed and storage. It's important to keep a nice ratio, it may open many private tracker's gates. If you dont have a nice speed (at least 10Mb/s in upload), you'll be limited on a lot of trackers."

trackers,3d0xcx,Shepherd7X,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:04:47 2015 UTC,"Yes a seedbox will by nature be a protective measure, as you're torrenting with an IP address completely unrelated to your ISP.  Edit: downvote away, this is entirely true."

trackers,3cwst3,Watermelon_Salesman,12,Sat Jul 11 13:30:18 2015 UTC,"TL is deliberately set up to be difficult and if you click around people's profiles you'll notice lots of 'VIP' users with ratios of 0.01, who have been paying to leech since the late 2000s.  It really depends how much you want to keep the account/whether you have alternative trackers. The get out of jail free card would be to pay for the three months immunity and then build up so much buffer with a seedbox that after three months you never have to worry about ratio ever again. Not saying I support that option, but as far as I know TL doesn't use the cash to DDoS other sites."
trackers,3cwst3,Mosphoran,6,Sat Jul 11 13:51:53 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why I let my TL account die off.  I managed to get past the 5GB barrier by cross-seeding, but it left a bitter taste in my mouth. It's a blatent attempt to force new users to donate.  OP: Let the account die off, get an account somewhere else. It's not really worth it."
trackers,3cwst3,slashrslashtrackers,-5,Sat Jul 11 19:17:25 2015 UTC,I gave up nearly instantly. The problem is that they don't let you even cross seed for the time restriction.
trackers,3cwst3,The_Monodon,10,Sun Jul 12 13:18:02 2015 UTC,"Cross seed, bro. Been on it since December and have a great buffer without paying a dime."
trackers,3cwst3,beyond1,5,Sat Jul 11 15:35:51 2015 UTC,This is how I did it. I think I have terabytes of buffer using cross seeding and a seed box to jump on new torrents.
trackers,3cwst3,ri4162,5,Sat Jul 11 16:33:35 2015 UTC,That's how I'm doing it. I just joined. I cross seeded 5 torrents. In just a few days my buffer is now 15GB and I have no wait times. It works.
trackers,3cwst3,Vincent9756,10,Sat Jul 11 17:38:36 2015 UTC,"I don't see much point in crosseeding if you find a good general tracker, large enough and with relaxed policies, just use that.  Why encourage TL with it's strict rules and toiling to keep their stuff seeded while others do the same and keep this whole unpleasant experience going?  I see the point of crosseeding from a general tracker to a niche tracker but from a general tracker to another general tracker doesn't make a lot of sense.  I can't recommend IPT cause they have unfriendly ratio rules also. I can recommend ratioless trackers because it's what I enjoy:TSH, ncore even GFT (for general trackers) and should you split your upload bandwidth for TL:NO , just use all your bandwidth on those trackers because they deserve it for being awesome and keep their stuff seeded as long as you can after the limit  and don't look back at trackers like TL cause filesharing is supposed to be FUN!"
trackers,3cwst3,WiNNyBHDtv,3,Sat Jul 11 15:38:54 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly.  The only general tracker I'm still active on is bB. All the ones with scene autouploads suck - they have to pay for scene axx and seedbox, and half the time they are scummy or (like TL) have policies designed to force you to donate. Also scene autouploads are always RARed, and I don't like keeping RARed files just to seed anyway.  I've realized that most of my needs are fulfilled with specific trackers. For the few things I can't get on the niche trackers I post a request on bB. Never failed me so far."
trackers,3cwst3,slashrslashtrackers,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:23:01 2015 UTC,"I can't recommend IPT cause they have unfriendly ratio rules also.   IPT has a bonus system that pretty much makes it a ratioless-like site dude. keeping ratio on ipt is effortless, and i have a 2mbs upload."
trackers,3cwst3,evgenetic,6,Sat Jul 11 16:31:59 2015 UTC,"Certainly not impossible, plenty of people are on TL.  However I'd say it's not a good first tracker at all, you absolutely need to know how to cross seed & have at least 1 other scene tracker to cross seed with (e.g. something like TBy, AR, etc.).  Starting out as long as you cross seed popular torrents (new TV/movie, etc) you'll build buffer no problem.  There's also the seedbox route, if you have a seedbox you'll build buffer quick.  For what it's worth, TL does force people to learn how to properly maintain ratio without freeleech or bonuses.  If you can manage that on TL then other trackers will be a piece of cake."
trackers,3cwst3,brickfrog2,2,Sat Jul 11 15:16:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't really think it was that hard to make it as a new user at TL when I joined years ago, and I still use them somewhat regularly. Just grab the latest episodes of the most popular tv shows and/or the most popular new movie releases as soon as you can and then LET THEM SEED. You'll have to have a little patience and leave things up for a while (not just a day or two), but there are always late-comers at TL. A seedbox would make life easier, but I know from experience that you can do it without one."
trackers,3cwst3,innocuous_name,7,Sun Jul 12 12:10:05 2015 UTC,"I've said this before on many other threads but I think that TL is a good first tracker.  It forces you to learn good habits, like building a buffer, cross seeding, etc.  Every time I join a new tracker, I build buffer the same way that I learned on TL.  Yes, the cross seed has to be the same, but if it's off by a bit, you can just grab the difference.  In my experience, it's almost always the .nfo file that's off."
trackers,3cwst3,thornside,3,Sat Jul 11 15:00:42 2015 UTC,"TL is a good first tracker.. forces you to learn good habits, like building a buffer, cross seeding, etc.   a) You need to have another tracker for cross seeding. How do you think that TL can be a 'first tracker' then?  b) No seed points. So how about telling the seeders that seeding is a good habit and gets rewarded the way top trackers do?"
trackers,3cwst3,SilverSw0rd,3,Sun Jul 12 12:49:20 2015 UTC,You can use public sources to cross seed.  It's really not hard.  Not all sites give you bonus points (like what) so learning to build buffer without then is simply good practice.
trackers,3cwst3,thornside,5,Sun Jul 12 16:53:23 2015 UTC,"TL is a good first tracker. It forces you to learn good habits, like building a buffer, cross seeding, etc.   Learning all these habits is great, but it sucks as a first tracker. The barrier is annoying to deal with, especially for someone who's new to private trackers and may not have access to many other scene trackers."
trackers,3cwst3,slashrslashtrackers,0,Sat Jul 11 19:18:50 2015 UTC,"The barrier is pretty easy to get over with a minimal amount of effort, with no cross-seeding needed, if you play your cards right."
trackers,3cwst3,robertblackman,3,Sun Jul 12 04:49:32 2015 UTC,"There is still time, but you have to work at it. You can cross seed popular torrents from other trackers as soon as they come out (e.g TV shows prime time US) and you will quickly get upload credit."
trackers,3cwst3,FredJoh48989,0,Sat Jul 11 13:38:27 2015 UTC,Except he can't do that if they aren't 100% matches. TL is not worth it imo.
trackers,3cwst3,idonteversleep,4,Sat Jul 11 14:00:03 2015 UTC,Can't you mark things that don't match to not download and then seed the rest?
trackers,3cwst3,displayerror,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:44:50 2015 UTC,Yes. I just had to do with a season pack for Outlander. 1 mkv file didn't match and I didn't have the NFO. I just unchecked them before I started the torrent.
trackers,3cwst3,Vincent9756,3,Sat Jul 11 18:25:19 2015 UTC,TL is not worth it imo.   I agree. I joined only because people said it was good general tracker so I signed up during the very recent open invites period.  I don't like that they don't unrar scene releases and it seems to take them longer to get WEB-DLs than my other tracker(s). I won't be using them. I just wanted to see what it took to get started (Some people make it sound impossible. It's not. It's just not worth it if you only want TV and Movies. Much better and easier options out there.)
trackers,3cwst3,Vincent9756,2,Sat Jul 11 18:36:10 2015 UTC,"1 thing which always worked out for me in TL is that the games are leeched the most. For example, I have been seeding GTA5 from the day of its release - 9th May ( i did not get it fresh from the moment of release but latched on to it after like 2-3 hours) and till today I have seeded more than 300GB on Kimsufi seedbox without adding any other torrent in between.  So i'd say watch out for New Games on TL as TV-series or movies will die down quickly but games will be still hot for a long time."

trackers,3cwst3,byronbb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:33:55 2015 UTC,"Torrentleech has always been like that. They've set up the rules in a way that it's almost impossible for new users to get a good ratio... Add it to the fact there is not point system like you said, and it's a zero sum game, which means some users won't be able to reach a ratio of 1 in every single torrent.  I don't understand why people don't talk about it, as it's basically extortion... IPT begs you for donations but don't force you to donate. TL forces you to do so, and the proof is the SHEER amount of VIP with ultra low ratio for a long time.  For those users who say that were able to get to a good ratio with cross seeding, what's the point of being a member of TL in the first place? If you have to actually download torrents from others trackers in order to upload to TL, it kind of defeats the purpose..."
trackers,3cwst3,Rodusk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:45:51 2015 UTC,"As everyone else has said, cross seeding is the best way. I've never had a seed of and have a very healthy buffer on TL"

trackers,3cwst3,culdesacked,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:16:04 2015 UTC,"The easiest would be to for example find a new release somewhere else, let us say a new TV episode that just aired. It has to be the exact same release in the exact same format. Essentially the same torrent, just with a different tracker. Then you download that from that some place else. After that you simply download the torrent from TL, add it to your client and simply point it to the already downloaded data. I got completely out of wait time with like three torrents through this exact method, and didn't take me more than a couple hours with a seedbox."
trackers,3cwst3,Martin8412,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:51:38 2015 UTC,Except that doesn't fucking work because up loaders will modify a release just enough so that you can't cross seed and since the tracker doesn't allow you to seed what you have while in wait time you're screwed on uploading anything over a few kb
trackers,3cwst3,Zazamari,3,Sat Jul 11 15:20:29 2015 UTC,"You do realize that you can exclude the differences in your client, right?"

trackers,3cwst3,Zazamari,4,Sun Jul 12 14:51:17 2015 UTC,"The TL wait times are only for downloading, not uploading.  You absolutely can grab a torrent's data from another tracker & cross seed it onto TL for upload.  re: mismatched .nfo files, usually you can mark those as do not download & seed the rest (I think that still works on TL?  It's been a while since I've dealt with wait times).  But technically that doesn't happen with all TL torrents, there are a lot that just match 100% without worrying about the mismatched .nfo file issue."
trackers,3cwst3,brickfrog2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:58:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the site is a money grab. Granted, I think private trackers have every right to wanna make money off that I don't begrudge them that. They're providing a service that is more or less free of charge in terms of $. But their whole set-up is designed to trap you, essentially if they are your first tracker. The options you mentioned, VIP and seedboxes just make it harder. The VIP doesn't help you build ratio on its own and getting a seedbox just makes it harder for other new users to build buffer.   If you already have a another general tracker in which you're cross-seeding from, sticking with that seems to be a better choice. Anytime you can ""donate"" for HNR/leech priviledge/upload credit it is no longer a donation, its a purchase. Which I think really goes against the way private trackers should work."

Maybe x264 as well, but they're a tier below HDB in my opinion."
trackers,3cvnkl,Booksaboutstuff,2,Sat Jul 11 05:06:39 2015 UTC,"x264 is meh unless you want 576p and can't get on PTP.  Besides they have really ridiculous rules about keeping their internals exclusive and threaten to ban anyone who shares internals elsewhere. Really? You're a filesharing site that... doesn't like people sharing your files?  It's a really misguided policy, they could have gotten some exposure from the shared encodes if they weren't so uptight about it."

HDB, M-Vids, Exigo, and, of course, lets not forget the whole of the scene. This doesn't nesecarrily mean they're all bad sites. I don't agree with the exclusivity policy, but all that was asked is ""Recommend me some movie trackers with high quality actively uploading internal groups? (Trackers besides ptp, ahd, and hdt)."" I personally believe that x264 fits the given criteria, although it is certainly below HDB.  The main problem is that OP listed most of the good movie trackers already."

Yes, there are other sites that allow exclusive uploads, but x264 highly encourages exclusives, to a point where literally all internals are exclusive (in my experience - i left the tracker so it could have changed since then).

trackers,3cwwiu,pjcnet,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"BCG and GGn are considered as the top 2 private gaming trackers by the majority of people, some people prefer BCG while others prefer GGn, but ultimately it would be great to be a member of both if you're a serious gamer. BCG is invite only, but has an IRC #invites channel where members are allowed to give out invites to others, but you have to be patient as members giving out invites aren't always available and it's up to members what they ask for, but normally proof that you're a good member on other private trackers is required. GGn is also invite only, they did have an application process, although I'm not sure whether they're taking any more applications at the time of writing.  If you can't get into either of the top 2 there is bitgamer.ch which is currently open sign up I believe. BG.ch was launched back in 2013 after the original and awesome bitgamer.su very sadly shut down suddenly on New Years Day 2013. The new bitgamer.ch isn't run by any of the original staff however and has so far never been as popular, but they have improved considerably and the site is also a lot more active than it was a year ago for instance making it a reasonable starting tracker for gamers. Another possibility is Pleasuredome which I believe is also open sign up at the time of writing, they're not considered as a top tier tracker, but it might still be worth a look. since I've never been a member there however it's difficult for me to advise further.  I'm personally not into animes so I can't really advise on this, although I see you've already been advised AnimeBytes."

I remember dialing in on a 14.4 kbps modem and downloading the newest Adobe Photoshop, version 3.0.5.  First time Layers had been added to the software, and they were truly amazing.  And there was so much software.  Anything you needed, that BBS had. Eudora Pro?  Got it.  Netscape Navigator Gold (yeap kiddos, you had to BUY web browsers back in the day).

trackers,3csyg7,catvllvs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:42:38 2015 UTC,"Hence my comment about quality control. If a site is allowing people to upload fluffed up files ""for ratio"", there isn't any quality control."
trackers,3csyg7,molotoviphone,0,Sat Jul 11 22:08:53 2015 UTC,"Actually, in the case of many trackers, that's just untrue. WhatCD users browse Bandcamp looking for free albums to upload all the time, and there's certainly quality control there.   Also, on bibliotik, the first 100 files someone uploads are usually done completely for the purpose of just uploading.   Yet these two trackers gave strict quality control policies"
trackers,3csyg7,catvllvs,2,Sat Jul 11 22:25:24 2015 UTC,You're not understanding.  Why allow a 128k rip of something from a 64k source? You cannot add something to that 64k source can you?  It has nothing to do with uploading for ratio as such but allowing people to add useless filler for ratio.  I will absolutely guarantee you WCD does not allow this.

I think that should be extended to all ebooks etc. MyA and Bib are both amazing, but I LOVE Gazelle. I just do.  For some reason, these trackers are run by people who aren't as into Gazelle, and I find that weird and frightening. I'm sure it'd be next to impossible to migrate either of these to a Gazelle framework, but I just want a Gazelle tracker.

Most of my Bibliotik uploads aren't from Overdrive, but from a smaller electronic library that uses the same DRM.  Most ebook lending services are very similar to Overdrive because almost all of them rely on the same Adobe DRM and servers. Of course Adobe DRM is shit, but the important point is that book publishers are ok with lending their books in that format. If you use something else, even if the DRM is stronger, you still have to convince the publishers. Much easier for everyone to use Adobe.  This means you can use the same Calibre DRM removal workflow for not just Overdrive, but almost all borrowed ebooks. It's pretty great."

If you are in an environment where you absolutely can't afford to even have a tiny risk of receiving such a letter, E.g. you are using your employer's Internet and you'd lose your job if you got caught, then a secure VPN that doesn't keep logs, or better still a good seedbox would still be recommended, but I wouldn't torrent on such a connection if the risk was ever that great.   Always remember to check the rules on any private tracker regarding VPN usage. As you know most allow VPNs for seeding and leeching, but a lot don't allow them for signing up / surfing the site.

Plus if you post a complaint they ban you because they can't fix it.  Most other trackers however can handle these kind of things and do. private sites track stuff public doesn't so it is easier to find anyone who might send these letters and get ride of them. Typically smaller sites aren't the focus of DCMA stuff though it is easier to go after big public ones it's easier to farm data out of with no side effects.

trackers,3cnh9q,FallenAege,2,Fri Jul 10 02:25:53 2015 UTC,"That machine is still in a different league to what would be required for a fairly busy average sized private tracker, this maybe good enough for testing purposes with just a couple of users during development, but it just wouldn't have the resources to do much else.  There is a massive difference however between the best Phenom processor and the poorest. Even if the Phenom processor was the best possible, E.g. a Phenom II x6 1100T 6 core running at 3.6 Ghz, then it would still be underpowered as the processor is quite a few years old and was never designed for server multitasking, but it's probably a much lower end processor which be could as low end as a first release Phenom x2 duel core running at just 1.8 Ghz.   3GB of memory is ridiculously low and it will probably be slow outdated DDR2 memory too.  You'd want a decent Intel Xeon processor and at least 32 GB of RAM, a SSD is highly recommended and ideally you'd want a gigabit pipe (with around half guaranteed), you could get away with a slower pipe, but the response times would be noticeably slower. If you were going to cut corners by running SQL on the same server you would definitely need a SSD, but ideally you'd have a separate SQL server. Bitsoup use Cloudflare (this costs $200 a month for reasonable DDoS protection) and they would therefore also need a reverse proxy server as unfortunately Cloudflare doesn't natively work with trackers. This additional server wouldn't need to be as powerful as the main server, but it would still need to be semi decent."

That software they are using is garbage and a complete cluster fuck of redundant code.

trackers,3cnh9q,jaimsteekurk,2,Fri Jul 10 04:50:21 2015 UTC,"It's nothing personal, but getting coders is sometimes awkward as private trackers have to be very careful who they give root access to. Normally you would want to know someone very well and have them earn their trust as a member of staff for quite sometime before allowing them full access and even then it's still a risk. You might say I'm paranoid, but if a coder with full access fell out with the owner and was the wrong type of person imagine what they could do. Yes there are ways of coding with only limited access, but it's very awkward. Anyway most private tracker owners will turn down a coder as soon as they mention a cost unless they're desperate."

So after 9 years of being with them, you'd think my offering my help would put their minds at ease just a bit. Limiting access to strictly php files is very very easy to do. But I guess the owner doesn't even know how to do that. I suppose all he is good at is collecting money from people.

trackers,3cnh9q,beg4funds,5,Fri Jul 10 00:43:13 2015 UTC,"The worst thing of all was when Bitsoup posted an announcement pointing to a thread where they promised never to ban anyone for their opinions. They also promised not to remove the thread. I wrote polite constructive criticism on the thread under their amnesty agreement and so did many other members, shortly later there was an extremely nasty and very childish hate announcement laying into everyone that dared to write on the thread, it had been removed despite their promise and myself + many others who replied to the thread voicing their opinion was banned not long later also totally against their promises. Only a very dishonest owner would lie and entrap people to reply under an amnesty and then use this to ban anyone who wrote an opinion that was even slightly against them.  Apart from this we've seen numerous announcements threatening closure, so many it's cry wolf and they try to make non donors feel guilty. I've seen promises they will stop the daily begging on more one occasion too, yet they lie every single time and continue. If you can't trust Bitsoup to keep to an amnesty you most certainly can't trust them with anything else what-so-ever like how much money they really have taken in donations. I suspect their donations are less these days however, partly because of losing Paypal and they want to recoup their losses, but mostly because of their constant begging, lies and blatant deception which is entirely their own fault.  It is a great shame as Bitsoup WAS a good site that has been around for 12+ years, the owner and some staff have however proven that they will not change so the only hope for the future of Bitsoup is if it got taken over.

trackers,3cj9qt,Izlandi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:11:17 2015 UTC,"Meh. The problem isn't ratio, retention time can solve that easily. But  for example, i can't be bothered to seed a 1 hour and a half movie for a couple of years just to get some leechers and actually reach that fair 1/1 ratio, considering 100 others or maybe more with the same 1 gbit bandwith  as me or higher who are also overseeding that torrent on a disproportioned tracker where the number of torrents is ten times the number of users. Even though in the rare case when i do download from those places, i seed it for 1-2 years.... I might do that more often with full tv shows, but with single movies, not so often, maybe i download a few to keep my account if i really need it, but for a daily basis...nah. I don't collect movies, i watch and delete them at some point, I use trackers where there are copies of these movies that interest me, close to that quality, i download from there, i keep them seeding for a couple of weeks - 2-3 months tops, ratio 4-10+, then i move on to others. If i would have unlimited space, i would permaseed everything.  Sadly, the 1 YB HDD (or maybe even SSD, who knows?)  isn't invented yet to suit my needs properly.  Back on the matter, here's a quick tip on TL or simmilar trackers: Cross seed everything you can, everything popular, popular games, popular movies,  eventually with a little effort, you'll get there. Or go with ratioless trackers alternatives and don't worry about a thing other than seeding time which is quite fair most of the time imho."

trackers,3cj9qt,mogoxx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:53:02 2015 UTC,Trackers do have have user limits to keep whatever hardware configuration running at peak efficiency. Also a tracker is only as good as it's active users so if the account is unused you're not part of a swarm and thus not helping the tracker at all. Plus there are security concerns low use accounts are suspicious by nature and most users use free emails to signup which also are subject to inactivity times. If you don't use the tracker what about the email? What happens if the email goes back into the pool and someone else picks it up?

But that's just me, i'm good with mainstream stuff, i don't need top notch everything.

AHD, even if it really has top notch everything, it is not for me, i preffer using my unlimited bandwith rather than downloading things which will take up space on my limited, at some point, hard drives.

Anyway if you are interested you can grab the source code here and then follow pretty straight forward guide on how to deploy it on heroku, only change second to last command from  heroku ps:scale web=1   to   heroku ps:scale worker=1    Hopefully this will be useful for you :)"

At my viewing distance there was no perceptible quality difference between 576p and 720p for me, so the quality was just as good at a MUCH smaller filesize. It's not only old CRT TVs that 576p is for, it's any smaller TV from before the whole home theatre craze. Most people I know never bothered to upgrade to big HDTVs as well - what's the point since they generally watch TV (which is still mostly SD)?"
trackers,3ccoqj,Photon_Man62,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:50:56 2015 UTC,How far away from the TV were you?
trackers,3ccoqj,o24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:18:09 2015 UTC,"3.5m, 40""-42"" screen."
trackers,3ccoqj,Photon_Man62,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:19:14 2015 UTC,See my other reply to this comment. You would need to be 4.3m away for 720p to be no longer worth it.
trackers,3ccoqj,o24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:20:38 2015 UTC,"That chart doesn't contain 576p. It only shows that 720p is worth it compared to 480p (which was true in the case of my setup). Even so, it's just for reference and is meaningless compared to a blind test."
trackers,3ccoqj,Photon_Man62,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:25:20 2015 UTC,You're within 4.3 metres so 720p is still worth it regardless of where 576p stands.
trackers,3ccoqj,o24,0,Mon Jul 13 12:06:14 2015 UTC,In 100% of cases watching the file you download on your PC monitor would be better than a CRT television.
trackers,3ccoqj,o24,-1,Wed Jul 8 11:37:55 2015 UTC,"576p looks totally perfect on a 42 in TV.  Even looks great on larger TV's as well, and the file size is usually 2-2.8 gb.  I live in Thailand where the internet sucks and having a file half the size that looks identical is pretty huge for me."
trackers,3ccoqj,legendairy,4,Tue Jul 7 15:56:51 2015 UTC,"I hate to argue semantics, and they may look good... but, simply and by definition, 576p encodes don't look perfect."
trackers,3ccoqj,wildaman1,-1,Tue Jul 7 19:08:38 2015 UTC,"In this context they do, since they are transparent compared to 720/1080p on such TVs (unless the person is sitting right next to it)."
trackers,3ccoqj,Photon_Man62,0,Wed Jul 8 01:55:42 2015 UTC,Unless they are sitting three metres away from the set then 720p is worth it.
trackers,3ccoqj,o24,0,Wed Jul 8 11:43:13 2015 UTC,"On my old TV (3.5m distance, 40""), I could see the difference between shitty low bitrate SD television and high-bitrate encodes from Bluray, but there was no perceptible difference between 2 high-bitrate encodes (576p vs 720p).  Old LCD sets from the time when they only started gaining popularity, along with 720p resolution (~2005) just did not have good enough picture quality for there to be immediately noticeable differences. Even just in the next few years picture quality improved a lot since LCD became the consumer standard. 576p is an excellent compromise for people who have such older setups.  EDIT: Fixed the distance."
trackers,3ccoqj,Photon_Man62,0,Wed Jul 8 13:08:20 2015 UTC,You have terrible eyes then. If you can't tell the difference between 576p and 720p at 1.5m then you might as well stick to a streaming site.  I still have an old ('04) 'HD ready' LCD in my room for the odd movie and I can tell the difference two metres away in my bed.
trackers,3ccoqj,o24,0,Wed Jul 8 17:20:10 2015 UTC,"Looks like you were right, I just measured the distance and it was 3.5m after all. It looks much closer and more cramped IRL."
trackers,3ccoqj,Photon_Man62,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:08:55 2015 UTC,"As you can see here, you would need to be 4.3m away for 720p to be no longer worth it."

Shame that the tracker is nowhere near as popular as it once was, but there are usually between 4 and 6 new, great 576p encodes a week."

A filesharing community that doesn't like people... sharing their files? Seems hypocritical to me.  Ironically, if they let people share their files outside the tracker they might be able to gain more exposure and have more interest in their tracker.

trackers,3ccoqj,slashrslashtrackers,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:05:46 2015 UTC,Yeah. I think they wanted to be too exclusive. I still use them primarily and love all their encodes but I can usually find what I want elsewhere If somewhere else releases first. I'm currently on Blu Evolution but their site notice says they are closing next month if they don't get enough donations.   There is one site I forgot the name of. They were super exclusive. They didn't even want their name broadcast onto the Internet. I had a login and then lost it. You log in through some fake pipl site. Very interesting. Loved the site but can't get back in now.

The best example I could recall was it's inability to move torrents from thier original download location, and resume seeding. If I move the files and then 'relocated' them with the GUI, it wouldn't do anything and just start redoanloading the files. This was a common complaint online and had no solution.

I understand why some private trackers do this, but it doesn't make it the right thing to do either. People should never be punished for what they might do.

You are not any more special than us. Only you were born in the right country financially   Why are you so certain that everyone in the US has a good connection?

I have shit peering and I'm seeding over Wi-Fi with a laptop.  Despite this I survived on all my trackers (some of which are top-tier/respectable trackers) with a good ratio, through a combination of seedbonus and cross-seeding.  If you are willing to put in the effort, you do not need a good connection to survive on a tracker. The fact that you DO have a good connection (1Gbps as you mentioned), and yet are unwilling to seed, says a lot about you as a person.  Yes, it took me effort. I had to be patient and not download everything I wanted. But I played by the rules and did not cheat.

GFT bans users for inviting users from certain countries, but allows all of them to signup at open signup, because it's easier to go through and clean everything in one big sweep than it is to continuously do it throughout the year. WCD is the exact opposite. The countries banned from the interview can still be invited by users since the users are responsible 100% for their invitees. Many other sites have similar systems where they allow certain countries entrance, but only in certain ways. Personally, since staff manpower is one of the main concerns for that, I feel that this is much better than blanket country bans even though it still isn't quite fair, and probably the best solution at the moment."

The important thing is by not blocking counties you are doing the right and fair thing. People should be treated as individuals and only be punished for things they have done, not for what they might do based on statistics of others.  Blocking countries is like locking up specific immigrants in a Western country, not because they've committed a crime, but because a statistically higher proportion of them may have committed crimes in the past.

trackers,3c3szm,meeper88,-2,Sun Jul 5 05:10:11 2015 UTC,"I look at it this way. I try to go by it with 2-3 facts that are hard to disagree by themselves. That does not mean that the reasoning is found/solid - that is up for discussion.   Interviews/Invites/applications always come with an associated cost. The cost is the risk of introducing a risky user to a community. The administrators and responsibles of the relevant trackers perceive those countries as introducing another cost. This does not mean that they disagree, when we say it could be a handful of bad sheeps causing mayhem on a far greater scale than in other countries. This only means that admins have not found a way, to ""lower"" the cost of introducing people with home IPs in those countries (regardless of ethnicity). The administrators would have to allocate resources for those ""higher"" cost countries. They believe that in the time, one ""problematic"" individual is introduced, two or even ten ""unproblematic"" individuals can be introduced.   I can relate, why they choose to do this.   I think the midway solution would be to irc ban/open sign up banning a country, but allow the invites to be given out via members.   Particularly in the case of WCD banning countries from interviews, this is absolutely understandable and none of our business. It would be absolutely fair if they only offered interviews to Germans or Koreans, because maybe they only have German or Korean interviewers. Often, people with the mere lack of English skills can be problematic. That does not say the kind interviewers will reject to take it upon them to interview those individuals. However, this means that it costs them four hours of potentially ""wasted"" interview time, instead of two - solely because of the lack of English skills.  Now what would be racist? If people from Romania could get into some trackers by sending in a non-Romanian ID/passport."
trackers,3c3szm,Gh0stnet,4,Sun Jul 5 12:37:00 2015 UTC,"Once you get to PU+ level on respected trackers, they have forums where you may be able to request or apply for invites to other trackers. But since you're from one of the countries with high levels of problematic uses (Romania? Brazil?), you need to prove that you're a good member first.  My suggestion would be to focus on one or two trackers and put some effort in there: participate in the forums and IRC, upload content, make sure you have a good ratio with a decent amount of download (someone with a 1.0 ratio and 200gb down is often more appealing than someone with a 1000.0 ratio and 10gb down).  In choosing which trackers to focus on, I'd suggest searching for that tracker on this subreddit and seeing what their reputation is; some trackers have bad reputations or bad invite forums and are essentially useless for getting elsewhere.  Then, of the trackers that you're on with decent reputations/forums, focus on the ones that have content you're most interested in.  Finally, you'll see places on the net that'll offer to trade or sell you invites - don't!  When you're caught, you'll be permanently banned from the tracker in question, and possibly other trackers as well."
trackers,3c3szm,T0ddl3s,6,Sat Jul 4 15:54:57 2015 UTC,one mod here posted stats and the number of bad users from certain geographic locations is rather appalling. When the numbers get to high it is a risk verses reward scenario. Staffers would rather not ban anyone and their time can be better spent working on the site. Sadly it makes no sense to police a lot of bad users to find the rare good one and when your site is run entirely by volunteers you need to pick your battles so to speak. I guess the better question is why it the torrent culture in those countries predisposed to such behaviours? Trackers have relatively simple rules to follow and they all boil down to the same thing... be a good user.

trackers,3c3szm,T0ddl3s,5,Sat Jul 4 15:56:51 2015 UTC,"This has been discussed in the past, but I will go over my opinions on the subject again.  Statistically there are more ""bad"" members (mainly members who break the rules) who join private trackers from certain countries, like it or not this is a fact. I can understand why some private trackers blacklist countries, but I personally do NOT agree with it. Blacklisting is in my opinion prejudice and it's not fair to assume that a person is going to for instance be a ratio cheat just because a higher proportion of members from his/her country have been ratio cheats in the past. Blacklisting is effectively punishing people before they've done anything wrong.  One country that is commonly banned is Brazil, yes I have come across a lot of ""bad"" members from Brazil, but there are also some excellent uploaders and outstanding members from Brazil that would have never been able to join if the whole country was blacklisted. Also even though the percentage of bad members is higher than many other countries (probably partly due to Brazil having slower average speeds than many countries), the number of ""bad"" members are still in the minority overall.  Edit: minor typo ""bee"" to ""been""."

Streaming services that are country blocked are not blocked because of prejudice of users however, it's often to do with licencing of specific programmes / movies and also many services like Hulu have Ads that are targeted to people living in specific countries, the advertisers pay for a particular coverage and this in turn pays for the service. It's not really a fair comparison to where people are prejudged on their risk that they might break the rules and be a bad user when they haven't even done anything wrong when the only deciding factor on the judgement is the country they happen to reside in.   Edit: I could get work and move to Brazil, but then suddenly I'd be frowned upon regarding joining private trackers and I could even find myself banned from some despite already being a good member, yet I'd be exactly the same person."

trackers,3c3szm,its_not_funny,0,Mon Jul 6 10:42:45 2015 UTC,"Wait what?  Those two threads are a big discussion of two vocal camps that oppose whether countries should be blanket banned or not. You have one party arguing that   In the example of Romania, they cause more work than other countries. That is why they are excluded (they can't pin-point the black sheep closer than the entire country). Others argue this is unfair to all the good Romanians (for example)   The same thing applies to any banned country. Some of the most upvoted and most controversial posts were:   The problem is, that even discounting account sharing shenanigans like those you described, some things, like ratio cheating, are still disproportionately high for Romanians from the stats I've seen. And because that's done on a passkey system as opposed an ip based system, this couldn't be caused by an ip change from the ISP. Now I'm not saying all Romanians are bad; infact, I have a friend in BT who is a Romanian and won't hesitate to describe how unfair things are if you bring up the subject. Unfortunately, it appears that, for whatever reason, there is a higher percentage of bad Romanian users than in most other countries, which means that sadly the whole country suffers as a result.   and   The scenario I had in mind is like this: a user gets banned for ratio cheating, waits a few days and creates a new account with a new e-mail and IP address and does more ratio cheating.   and   What is important is that we should EDUCATE the Romanians about the rules so they become good users and use their bandwidth power for good purposes. We shouldn't throw demeaning and exaggerated insults because those won't bring any kind of positive result! I made countless threads criticizing Romanians but I always limited my posts to clear proofs/facts that anyone can observe not mysterious statistics from a person that is clearly racist.   and   You can't ratio cheat by mistake and they agree to read the rules after joining. There isn't much you can do if they don't give a fuck. (...) Romanian isn't a race.   and   Also, don't forget that: HDB has a romanian moderator, chd had a romanian moderator and a romanian administrator, ftn had a romanian moderator, etc. Perhaps you should quit with all the hate and realize that nowadays with 1 Gbps lines at home here in Romania, we're getting legit upload speeds all the way. People are people, different types, some will share, others won't even care.   The other thread has a lot of information from the people that end up deciding these things. You can replace India with Romania all day long. People here are not caricature-racists (the responsible ones).  The big question is if a tracker is ethically allowed to block a nation from participating in that tracker. Or better phrased: Is it worth-while, offering less of the applications/invites/user numbers in an attempt not to exclude a certain nation.  ""Romanians"" just have the strongest of reputations here. You likely can replace them with Brazilians or Turkish people at will. Frankly, all of the countries that got computers and internets over night and never had time to learn and develop a netiquette for these things.  Hint: I, too, am also affected by his with one of those nations/ethnicities. I will not elaborate on which one, as I think it simply does not matter if this is about Romanians, Turkishmen or Marsians."

As to the racist card I hear that a lot but staff runs off logs files it is purely statistical data. When you're looking at numbers it doesn't take a lot to start to see patterns especially when they are high. The better question is what in those cultures as far as torrents go makes them act in such a manner?

It is based on scarcity of access and race speeds for the most part which is totally irreverent to 99% of those using the site.   There was a point on all the trackers that country bans didn't exist so everyone was on equal footing but the sad reality is when you ban 3/4+ from certain areas you begin to re-evaluate. You have no idea how much work goes into running a large tracker most take it for granted as long as the content is there and thing works no one thinks twice of the hours that go into working it and that in most cases is done for free by volunteers. So what you call lazy having never work one is staff prioritizing workload to be more productive. What you call racist is purely statistics, same way insurance companies drop high risk users. What we need is those regions to change their way of thinking so the numbers shift in the other direction.

To my knowledge there is no high level spam filtering being done. All unknown emails arrive, so far.  I cannot set up notification, but I urge trackers to enforce activity and use PMs. E-Mail should only be used as 2FA.  Honestly... there is no alternative to Tutanota. With recruitments, I usually offer my real GMail address on top, so in case the recruiter is suspicious about the name ""Tutanota"", he can use that email.

This is likely unimportant for the majority of /r/trackers users. Depending on what you do and where you do it from, it might be imparative, though.  Also, their ""normal"" email address is usually something people do not tend to just throw around. Sure GMail's filtering mechanisms are from another planet. But still, I remember having to change my email addresses over and over again.  In the end, it seems adequate to keep a work email, a personal email and one for internet things. The internet things email might need some splitting up. Think of this: Maybe people can duckduckgo your real name using your email address in combination or without your nick name?

No. But it does mean that if you're looking for furniture that's one of the best places to be. By simply saying that it has the ""biggest selection"" and ""lowest prices"" you're ignoring that some people may not want the exact thing that Walmart has, or that, in plenty of cases, Walmart doesn't have the lowest prices.  Besides, if you're just going by most content and most users public trackers take the cake. Millions of torrents compared to the couple 100k that IPT has. Not to mention that RuTracker is still around, which IPT would still lose to on the ""statistics don't lie theory"".

Of course i visit these sites once a week, i want to check what's new and what can i download.

Only tracker I'm looking for now is PTP, I suppose, but I haven't heard anything about them that comes across as high maintenance.

""Ratio-cheating = perma-ban"" is almost always highlighted in bold too.   I agree with you (partially) - some users will make a genuine effort to change. But this burden falls on the staff - which of the 100 cheaters are going to change, and how many are just going to try another form of cheating? As volunteers, staff don't have time to educate and rehabilitate cheaters into better file-sharers, especially since the good trackers have hordes of people knocking on their doors."

So the only conclusion is that there's a subset of Romanians that get a kick out of cheating the system.  In defense of Romanians though, I will say that it's very likely that the ratio of cheaters among international Romanian torrenters is much larger than that of cheaters among all Romanian tormenters. My guesstimate is that out of several million Romanians who torrent, less than 1/20 bother themselves with non-Romanian trackers. And that minority of Romanian torrenters that are on international trackers overlaps to a relatively large extent with ""wiseguy"" torrenters, who are attracted by such things as tracker prestige.  Also, I think that another reason tracker staffs are less reticent to ban all Romanian users is because Romanians are less likely overall to financially support a tracker.

trackers,3bv1cp,Bosiveh,4,Thu Jul 2 20:17:02 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. If someone is seeding from one location and downloading that torrent from another, the tracker wont give him himself as a peer. You can still manually add it, but that will get you banned."

trackers,3bv1cp,mildlyincoherent,0,Sat Jul 4 03:22:03 2015 UTC,Staff are unlikely to give out information to third parties.  There's no way of us verifying that that person is indeed your friend.  And we don't like to give out private information about our users.  IRC is his best bet.
trackers,3bv1cp,whiskybearapocalypse,3,Sat Jul 4 23:54:31 2015 UTC,"I run two seedboxes with some of the same torrents on both. Not an issue.  I had to idle the entire day before someone sorted me out. I think it depends on the problem - mine was really random and technical (ie, not just uploading bullshit or letting my account go dormant) so I guess I had to wait for a specific person to deal with it, rather than just one of the admins who was around."
trackers,3bv1cp,SAKUJ0,5,Thu Jul 2 15:47:36 2015 UTC,"of course no way of knowing   I'd say waiting until the staff that was responsible for disabling you shows up the same time that you are there is a way of finding out at least.  That might be at some time today. Or at any time in the future. I would just try to forget about it and idle 2-3 hours every day at different hours a night.  If this does not work for you, you should try to get a backup tracker or similar. Think of this like sending in your defect motherboard that still has 20 months warranty. They tell you to wait 2-6 weeks. There is nothing that you can do about it. Calling them twice a day won't help. Just follow their instructions and be patient. if you can't live without a motherboard for 2-6 weeks, try to use your laptop or grab another one for the time being."
trackers,3bv1cp,Rhodanum,3,Thu Jul 2 21:19:49 2015 UTC,"Getting disabled on WCD could cause OP grief down the road, if they don't manage to recover their account. I had to deal with that problem myself: got disabled three days after I joined through an invite and instantly figured that it probably had to do with someone else in the house already having owned an account (there are four of us on the same Internet connection).   Long story short, we're almost a year on since then and I haven't managed to so much as bring up the problem on IRC, much less get any sort of definitive answer. I ended up going to ridiculous lengths, such as connecting to IRC through my phone, setting it up so it would ring if my username got mentioned and sleeping with the phone next to my pillow. No luck.   The end problem is that even if I've given up on recovering that account, it's still a black mark against me when I want to join other trackers. For example, when I tried to join AHD through the invite forums at AnimeBytes, I got asked if I had been disabled on any other private tracker and I was honest. The response, naturally, was that I couldn't be invited until I resolved the situation at WCD somehow."

To the op just be patient they will get to you in the irc it may take a day or two but I'm sure will help you sort it out.  Good luck!
trackers,3bv1cp,SAKUJ0,14,Thu Jul 2 12:09:58 2015 UTC,It does take a while. I even believe people (mostly) when they say that they have been checking in every day over 4-8 months and that they are being ignored most of the time (though I do not believe this to be representative).

The downside is that it's often over 10GB but they are all very well seeded and it's easier to maintain ratio on BBT than AB. AB's OST torrents are very poorly seeded in general. Exceptions are stuff banned on BBT but allowed on AB after all."

trackers,3btgpu,thatkidPB,10,Thu Jul 2 00:33:25 2015 UTC,"Private trackers are mainly private sites that you get into after qualifying for. Most require maintaining a ratio and following rules, but others don't. The main ways people qualify for these trackers are:   Having a friend that is already in a tracker that has access to invites. This is a lot of people's starting point on trackers.  Access to invites through a power user + class official or unofficial but rule abiding invite thread. This is achieved after putting some work into maintaining/gaining ratio for 1 month +. I may go over that later. Application/open interview - while most torrent sites do not feature an application or interview process, many do. Surprisingly, these also happen to be some of the best trackers for content areas. Animebytes(Anime) has an application, and Myanonamouse(books/audiobooks) and WhatCD(best music source) have an interview process.  Getting ratio proofs. Your ratio proof is your uploaded/downloaded, and it is good practice to have 1.0+. You should also have a normal amount of content downloaded based on the specialty of the site. A ratio proof is generally a screenshot of your profile as well as a link to it.    I rank it last because I'm on 10+ trackers, at least 5 of which I consider high quality in their content area, and not a single one required a ratio proof aside from the site I was invited off of. People will recommend joining open signup trackers, but the only permanent open signup tracker that was ever worth anyone's time was Empornium.   Some good places to start:   WhatCD. You said waffles FM was something you wanted to be part of, and they are very similar. However, whatCD is very easy to get into comparatively, whereas waffles requires an insider or a high up user class thread. For whatcd, head over to their interview prep site and learn up, and then take the interview once you're confident. I also hear they have amazing connections all around the tracker world.  RuTracker - If you can handle Russian, this site is the second best for music. I have uploaded from here to waffles. Seeds aren't as good as What or waffles after a year or two, but content is good. It's also open signup.  Myanonamouse - you may not like audiobooks and ebooks, but this is certainly a place where they're to be had. They're not a retail source(see bibliotik) and their economy is nonexistent, but content is unparalleled. There is so much here, and it was my first tracker. It also has great power user forums that can help you move on to other trackers.  IPT/Torrentleech/TSH/bitleechers:   You're gonna want a general tracker, or at least I think you do.    Pros: IPT has the best content seeding of these general trackers and is easy to get into. There is some donation advertising. You also should have no problem building ratio - even on a slow connection freeleech gets tons of activity.    Cons: terrible reputation in some circles, ratio proof is worthless if you were ever to need one.    Torrentleech pros: good pretimes, excellent seeding.    Cons: not easy for new users to start(16 hour wait until you donate or get some upload by cross seeding), no community    Torrentshack pros: Excellent pre-times. Ratioless as well as no hit and run rules   Cons: may shut down for lack of donations, periodic massive site problems   Bitleechers pros: I think they just opened signups. Ratioless.    Cons: unknown"

But I'm sure theres still a lot of upload opportunity I downloaded the last set of FL torrents  about a week and a half ago (80 torrents) and got about 2.5 gigs of upload from that, granted thats not much but it also cost me no buffer, so something to consider"
trackers,3bldzy,juryk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:23:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I caught it about 4-5 hours after the announcement and have gotten about 25gb from my seedbox so far. I can't be disappointed however as it's taken me a big chunk of the way towards the ratio required for power user, and it's obviously still seeding, even if it's much slower now."

trackers,3bldzy,cuddle-buddy,3,Wed Jul 1 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"Great timing indeed.  I joined ~1m ago, well into the last free leech event, and got a few gigs nothing more.  Jumped into this one two hours after the announcement, grabbed all freeleech flac/v0's and viola, 33GB of uploads.  Plenty of buffer to grab what I need, which to be frank, is depressingly few after using rutracker and private forums for a number of years."
trackers,3bldzy,yfph,3,Wed Jul 1 01:37:47 2015 UTC,"Something quite unrelated to this freeleech situation, but I noticed that I went into this thinking that I'd just download whatever music I already had on my phone but in better quality, and I remember feeling like I'd need to branch out a bit to keep my buffer in check. Pretty Awesome how easy the site makes it to find good new music. I'd never heard an Electronic style album that I liked until today. I can only imagine that the actual Staff Picks are probably quite good themselves."

trackers,3bldzy,waIeIe,4,Tue Jun 30 23:04:59 2015 UTC,"Took the interview :) It's a pretty fun process, the interviewers are all nice, and you learn a lot. Definitely worth giving it a try."

It probably won't be too much, but it's enough to offset several albums worth of download data. Definitely leave them seeding for a while into the future, it helps a ton--nighttime included.  I don't think you have anything to lose, so hey, why not?"

trackers,3bldzy,Shepherd7X,2,Wed Jul 1 17:23:11 2015 UTC,Wish they didn't have such a heavy emphasis on seeding. It's very discouraging as a new user. I can't complain though. I went HAM during the last site-wide freeleech.

trackers,3bldzy,_86JR_,2,Tue Jun 30 08:27:13 2015 UTC,Feral Hosting - Deluge 1.3.11
trackers,3bldzy,Shepherd7X,2,Tue Jun 30 10:55:44 2015 UTC,Do you recommend Deluge over RuTorrent? I just got a Feral SSD and I am using ruTorrent as well as a seedhost RuTorrent box. I don't find ruTorrent is very agressive in getting into the leech swarm though. Not seen higher than 50mbps in upload on the SH box.
trackers,3bldzy,_86JR_,2,Tue Jun 30 14:16:45 2015 UTC,I would recommend it yeah. For your Feral box you can have multiple clients installed so set up Deluge and see if you like it.
trackers,3bldzy,Shepherd7X,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:57:12 2015 UTC,"I tried it before on my seedhost box - the only thing I didn't like is I was only able to add one torrent per time in the GUI, otherwise I had to ftp in and drag them over to the watch folder :/  In ruTorrent I have added 150 torrents before in one go through the GUI..."
trackers,3bldzy,Rolpege,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:28:27 2015 UTC,"In the thin client, which is the desktop app GUI (I guess you that's what it's called :P) you can drag the torrents right into the program. So just select them all and drag them into the program and they all load in at once."

trackers,3bldzy,Rolpege,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:26:43 2015 UTC,Last week they upgraded it. I think they did it on every server but if somehow they skipped yours submit a ticket and I'm sure they'll upgrade it.

trackers,3bldzy,Shepherd7X,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:52:56 2015 UTC,I'm curious if there is a reason you prefer deluge over rutorrent? I use the latter.
trackers,3bldzy,jodoji,0,Tue Jun 30 16:03:54 2015 UTC,"Deluge is a lot more aggressive at getting peers, so it tends to seed better, especially on new torrents. It is pretty unreliable with lots of torrents though. What I do is send stuff to Deluge, and after it starts to fill up I move it to rTorrent if I need to continue seeding it. So I use Deluge as my primary client and rTorrent for ""archive seeding."""

trackers,3bldzy,Jasperbeardly11,17,Tue Jun 30 07:11:44 2015 UTC,"Okay let's be honest, seeding the FREE-LEECH content that has hundreds if not thousands of seeders has absolutely no impact on the health of the swarm. Especially if you plan on ultimately deleting it after getting some quick upload.  That said, I have no problem with you doing so. I'm doing the same, because I want more buffer that I can ultimately spend on requests. Just don't pretend you're helping the community by seeding these torrents because there were enough seedboxes on these to max anyone's download speed many times over 5 minutes after these staff picks were announced."
trackers,3bldzy,Shepherd7X,4,Tue Jun 30 07:17:18 2015 UTC,Your buffer is at least 1.3TBm which is more than enough for 6500 FLAC albums at 200mb each. The average length of an album is 50 minutes. So it would take you 7 months to listen to all that.  Why don't you spend any of it?

trackers,3bldrl,SilverSw0rd,27,Tue Jun 30 04:04:44 2015 UTC,Step #1 of operating a BT tracker - It is VERY important to have a reverse proxy in front of anything that links to a service controlled / operated by a US/EU based company.  Some good tips here - https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/3bbsmp/what_is_the_cost_of_running_a_tracker/?sort=confidence
trackers,3bldrl,iN0M4D,5,Tue Jun 30 04:53:58 2015 UTC,Or even better: don't centralize the whole private trackers scene at CloudFlare and get back to using piracy-friendly ISPs.

trackers,3bldrl,312c,3,Wed Jul 1 02:01:51 2015 UTC,"Neither does CloudFlare. And this matters for a private tracker... why?  I assume you are mistaking multicast for anycast, which although helpful for big scale DDoS mitigation, is not needed at all. In the example I given of Ukrtelecom, they have a fuckton of free inbound capacity available from residential customers."
trackers,3bldrl,Nyr7,-4,Wed Jul 1 04:07:57 2015 UTC,"Yea, I typed the wrong thing.  PTP's had upwards of 50 gbps throw at it for continued periods of time, not many hosts are going to put up with that without a CDN, especially not one that maintains a residential network."
trackers,3bldrl,312c,4,Wed Jul 1 05:03:05 2015 UTC,"Ukrtelecom can tank 50 gbps easily, don't underestimate an ISP with millions of customers. And a CDN is not about DDoS mitigation, is about getting content as close to the customer as possible.  To be realistic, any serious ISP selling DDoS protection will be able to tank 50 gigabits, specially since it's a private tracker and they can drop all UDP and just filter TCP.  Feel free to contact me at any time in the future if you guys need help with DDoS mitigation by any chance."

Seems like a rather big chink in their business."

trackers,3bpxa9,mataleo,8,Wed Jul 1 05:06:12 2015 UTC,"For the love of God, don't start a private tracker. Don't get me wrong, I love the communities, but you are heavily underestimating the requirements to be able to run a private tracker. You'll need a server for the backend, for the frontend, backup servers, a decent setup for load balancing, the knowledge to make everything HTTPS-compliant. When you master all of that, by then you'll realize you should expect to pay at least 300€ per month if you want to do it even half of decent. If you are contemplating whether you should pay 20$ for a frontend, you're not halfway ready to take the task on.  I'd see the potential if you already took the initiative yourself to see which frontends are available, tinkered around with a few options to see which one you like, of which you understand the source code and trust you can continue building on it. And if none of them seems good for you, you need to have the potential and knowledge to start an IDE and tinker around with it to see if you can make something that looks a bit like a frontend within a few days, and if so, you develop that. And that's when you realize you need an actual dev team, server maintainers and designers because it's too much work for you to handle.  Don't underestimate the skillset of the people setting up private trackers."
trackers,3bpxa9,medEng0,3,Wed Jul 1 15:33:49 2015 UTC,"True, there's loads of people who say they want to setup a private tracker, but the vast majority give up during the very early stages when they start realizing what is truly involved.  Firstly the op could buy a cheap dedi from somewhere like online s.a.s. (online.net) or hetzner just to develop and test at first, then loads of money isn't wasted during development. It's a great way to learn everything first and decide if it's then feasible to go all the way later. If the op can't get it running, E.g. hasn't got the ability to achieve it or realises there's just more to it than expected, then it can be just put down to experience without spending too much. The op would need to learn how to setup a LAMP server if he/she doesn't know how to do this already or similar (E.g. Nginx which is considered by many as better than Apache) for a start and then go from there. The op won't need too much power without actual members and he/she won't even need to worry about where the server is located or host T&Cs as no copyright laws are broken unless it goes live.   If the op got a test system working as detailed above then a good proportion of the work would be done and the op could then consider transferring to a live system. He/she would have gained a lot more experience by making it this far, it would also show determination showing that he/she may have what it takes to run a private tracker after all, but the op would then have to very carefully consider how the live system is going to be finally setup and what host to use that is tolerant of filesharing sites. DDoS protection should also be considered as very important these days and there's more to this than just using Cloudflare. Finally the op will need at least a few staff to help if it ever got very close to the going live stage, but once a test system can be demonstrated the op would be taken a lot more seriously.  Edit: added to it before being rated."

trackers,3ber6t,slashrslashtrackers,9,Sun Jun 28 17:14:19 2015 UTC,"Piggly why not set up scheduled interviews every week, like MAM? Perhaps every sunday and thursday or something like that, reduces the load on bB interviewers and makes the wait less unbearable!"
trackers,3ber6t,SAKUJ0,2,Mon Jun 29 00:53:45 2015 UTC,"All it would accomplish is, in the end, the same amount of interviews will be held (as many as the interviewers have time). Granted, the wait time would be far remedied. However, that wait time would not just disappear, but instead turn into a queue, as they can only do a finite amount of interviews per week.  The queue would fill up with people who would otherwise simply lose interest. Really commited people would now face wait times of ~ a few months.  This way, if you were commited enough to idle the next ~ 72 hours, chances are very high you would get an interview.  The worst of all: Now imagine people followed that instruction (that might very well turn out to be worse in retrospect) - now you will a) have to organize the weekly thing with tickets, assigned interviewers etc. and b) you would require one big further requirement by the interviewers. They would have to commit.  Interviewers are scarce as it is and it speaks for bB and WCD, that even the best trackers offer utter ""newbies"" (in the good way) entry to their realms. Now imagine we would have even less, because of that.  In the end, I can recommend to queue up at different times and while you have time here and then. Have some chats, show you are nice already. It is well worth the wait.  We should be glad, this is offered to begin with. Even quite high user classes cannot issue invites (which they have), as of now. It would be reasonable, to close the interviews for the time being and it just is awesome, how this is not being done.  Thanks, staff!"

trackers,3ber6t,Rebeleleven,6,Mon Jun 29 14:20:20 2015 UTC,"Hey Piggly, why doesn't bB have an interviewer schedule? For example an interviewer pick an hour or two a week when they'll be interviewing, and then display that schedule in the interview channel so people don't wait hours. They can just come back at that selected time. Then maybe just interview the first 5 (or whatever) that show up.   Could all be easily done by a shared google spreadsheet. And I'm sure some of bB members would volunteer to be interviewers pending your guys' approval. I know I would haha."
trackers,3ber6t,bB_Piggly,7,Sun Jun 28 23:42:21 2015 UTC,"Well, the current situation is why we don't have a schedule.

Seriously I think you'll find there's a lot of luck as volunteers work around real life, you could come on and be really lucky, or staff may not be available for ages. There maybe times and/or days where you have more chance however, I don't know if anyone who knows Bb might be-able to advise further.

trackers,3bckox,lackrays,11,Sat Jun 27 23:31:14 2015 UTC,"Hilarious as it was, this may have sobering consequences on filesharing and piracy.  The worst-case scenario is further scrutiny by regulators - if people are making money from selling others' copyrighted content (don't give me that ""you're paying for bandwidth not content bullshit, the bandwidth is used for illegal content), MPAA and the corporate cronies are going to be scrutinizing torrenting even further. Private trackers are probably going to ignore this software, but if this becomes big ISPs may start to look even more closely into torrenting, since you're running a business off their bandwidth. That's bad for filesharing in general.  Fortunately, I don't think this will ever be a big thing. People who are already on private trackers are going to laugh at it for obvious reasons. Majority of people on public trackers are leechers who throttle upload and immediately delete the torrent file once leeching is complete - I really don't think they'd be willing to pay.  What I view as a possibility is that this might end up filling a small niche. There are people who might ""sell"" content that is rare on public trackers (basically any non-YIFY encode from >1 year ago), and there might be some buyers who don't know about private trackers or can't seed back for some reason (ie ISP data caps)."

I will always keep my account totally hit and run free with a good ratio (unless ratioless) on all the private trackers I'm already a member of, I will gradually progress up the ranks to a certain point, although I don't really have any goals while doing this.  PTP will eventually have to accept some new members over time as it doesn't matter how popular they are, it's a fact of life that there will always be some natural wastage (it might be slower if they're very popular, but there will still be some), the same is true in any club, organisation or anything else where people join. Because of this their active members will gradually diminish unless they're replaced so you can be sure that one day invites will be reopened or there will be another way to recruit new members.

trackers,3b27d4,BasilF,5,Thu Jun 25 16:00:11 2015 UTC,"Snatches are always the hardest for me. I upload my own caps from time to time but my uploads are generally niche, so I get few snatches, 50 if I'm lucky. I should get a bit more serious about things and not be so slap dash."
trackers,3b27d4,bezdancing,2,Thu Jun 25 16:12:25 2015 UTC,I just went through everything in my head just to come up with the fact that we are in agreement (except for the snatches I guess - those should be fine regardless of time or seedbox. You just need to snatch more - as there is no average seed time requirement that could go down)
trackers,3b27d4,SAKUJ0,-1,Thu Jun 25 16:19:45 2015 UTC,"There are several criteria you have to meet to advance user levels.   Total data (Upload+Download) Bonus points Snatches (# Downloads + # times uploads snatched) Time on site Total seed time No Hit and Runs   For new members, bonus points are tough because there is a monthly multiplier that you have to wait to accumulate.    For medium-term members, snatches are tough because most people don't upload anything and just rely on download snatches to increase that total. You only get 1 snatch for every download. Whereas if you upload something, you're pretty much guaranteed a minimum of 50 snatches and possibly a lot more if it's something popular.    If you have a high-powered seedbox, total data is pretty easy to get. When you have a 1Gbps upload line, you can just snatch everything and seed the shit out of it.    I won't pay for a seedbox (though I wouldn't mind a free trial to see if it's something worth pursuing), so that's the only one holding me back. At my current rate, I'll still get there in not too long.    At the end of the day though, the user class really doesn't mean anything besides growing my e-peen."
trackers,3b27d4,Bob_Chiquita,2,Thu Jun 25 21:47:36 2015 UTC,"Edit Later on I confuse daily quota with monthly. Better skip this post as the ones later add a great deal more to the discussion. I'll leave this post up for posterity.  My point is (someone else posted the data), let's assume you are new at BTn and decide to go for Overlord.   You will need three years at the very least. You will need to snatch 35 000 torrents, which is roughly 35 every day. This process will likely be automated by snatching all torrents, or at the very least the 34 most popular torrents, as they are uploaded. Those 35 snatches you have to seed for roughly 8 days.   Hmm having gone through it, yes you seem right. 100 TB total data are like 100 GB every month. Frankly, that seems like nothing, in comparison.  I suppose, a lot of people struggle with the data, as they have not joined BTn and instantly thought ""YES, I will become the Overlord"" - but instead have been a good member for ~ 2 years. They likely did things from a worse connection, for a good amount of time during those 3 years.  Thanks for elaborating - the other reply gave me actual numbers. I hope it is O.K. for us to discuss the Overlord rank in public."
trackers,3b27d4,SAKUJ0,-1,Thu Jun 25 16:35:51 2015 UTC,"There's a little more to it, but yeah that's the gist of it.    You're supposed to upload to get snatches, not just download 50 things a day and delete them when you can.    Your calculations for the data is a little off. If you are assuming 1000 days (~3 years), then you're looking at 100GB per day, or about 2.8TB per month.  Also, your total time seeded only counts for active torrents. Meaning if you delete a torrent, you lose the time seeded from your total.    The goal is more to get you to contribute to the community by uploading and to seed as long as possible.

trackers,3b27d4,Not-the-One,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:39:39 2015 UTC,"I find trackers to be a lot like EVE Online.  You can expand horizontally. Cover more trackers. You will fill up according to your needs. Within only two weeks of tracker participation, you can cover virtually all your needs:   Movie .torrents: AHD, HD-T or TC TV .torrents: ToTV, MTV and Usenet or FoTV Music .torrents: WCD Community aspect bB   This horizontal progression is much like in EVE progressing from Frigates to larger ships such as Destroyers, Battle Cruisers, Battleships or even larger. Maybe you will learn to enter a Titan in a decade, but you will likely not be able to do a whole lot with it.  Then there is vertical progression. At one point, you will specialize in what you do. You might skip all horizontal progression and instantly try to be the master of Frigates. Man, they are PvP beasts. You will likely spend years just on Frigates, if need be. Or you wait until you get to battleships to rat better.  Currently doing the vertical progression on that list. Part of the reason is that I do not see how hard-to-get-in-trackers would recruit people who have not been at least six months on a well-respected tracker. I like the vertical progression game. People should not rush it, here, though. In EVE, specializing in Frigates is always great. In trackers, you might first want to find out if that place IPT is really a good match for you, before commiting into its vertical progression (does it fucking have one, to begin with?)  All that being said, people who complain about how hard it is to get into private trackers, get the fuck out of here."

I literally teared up on WCD (I found a couple of friends from 15 years ago, where we had an argument and never talked again. They made an album and I saw their cover on WCD. Just high-school garage stuff, and they never did anything again)  How often have I heard ""Wait until you see PTP"" when I was blown away by newly reached archives.  1-2 weeks pass, you get used to it. It's like that new HDTV that blows your mind away because it is too big. Three weeks later and you cannot remotely imagine having lived without it."

trackers,3b27d4,SAKUJ0,0,Sat Jun 27 01:18:33 2015 UTC,"I view WCD/BTN/PTP as kind of the holy trinity for media, and I'm honestly happy to just be a member of each site with a good buffer; pretty much anything I ever want to watch or listen to is but a few free clicks away. I don't engage much with the community aspects, though, primarily out of a fear that all forums have a non-zero chance of accidentally upsetting someone/getting dragged into a flamewar, which would be a really shitty way to lose your account. I'm very content to consume content at the lowest user classes and maintain a respectable buffer.  Got disabled from TC due to inactivity pruning about a year ago; I guess that proves that I didn't need two dedicated movie trackers, I suppose PTP has everything I need. It's a shame, and several hundred GB of my buffer has vanished, but honestly I'm pleased that my slot in the total user-count has hopefully gone to someone more active who will enjoy it more. This is also why I've never seriously pursued Waffles - although I'm curious, it probably doesn't actually offer anything new over WCD. And at the end of the day, I suppose I'm in it for the files in the actual download, not the Bittorrent scene. Whenever I've signed up to other varying-grade private trackers during open signups, I've just found I don't need to use it - I've already got everything I could ask for.  My first love will always be bB, though, who taught me everything I know of private trackers. It's a fantastic community, the kind of place where moderators who delete a bad (non-rules-compliant) upload you've made will PM you with help and encouragement on how to do better next time. I still check here first for everything, and it's the only place where I upload - to help build up the site for those not on other trackers. It's the only place I'd legit want to hang around the forums and climb the user classes. Just celebrated four years of my account!  My only serious remaining goal is probably Bib. I know almost nothing of the e-book scene, but I can see myself getting hugely into it and uploading lots of purchases to build ratio; I love reading, and have access to far, far more obscure-ish content not already on the tracker than I would at, say, WCD."

I got into ThePlace because I found some of Hypnotica's shit on Demonoid a decade ago.  From there, I found IPT, which lead me to WCD, which lead me to TS, which lead me to MyAnonamouse, and on and on and on...  The only tracker I'm interested in checking out that would just be a repeat of what I already have access to is ToTV, and that's because I'm excited to see something challenge Gazelle after all this time.

Oh boy, come on it is not that bad. I can absolutely relate with all the horror stories. But it is not like you stop talking to other people for the fear of getting robbed or raped.  We hear a lot of abusive staff etc. If you think before you write and try to always help rather than to be a dick, there is virtually no way for backlash. Just do not get too invested.  But you are missing out, and so is the community. It's sad that people are actually afraid to participate in some of the best communities to discuss music / movies and television.  Whenever people just irk you the wrong way (the least bit) absolutely ignore them. And I mean literally, throw them on your IRC ignore lists and blacklist them on the tracker sites if you can. Really, they are not worth your breath and directly to blame for you being afraid to talk. How fucked up is it if somebody is scared to comment on things?

Probably closer to the truth, it's just more community than I actually need/have time for - sad, but I already spend too much time on reddit, I can't add regularly posting in 4 forums on top if I still want to see daylight. I do search the forums for technical info quite a bit though (like homebuilding a HTPC), so they definitely come in handy. I just don't necessarily have a great deal to add.

Is it not like a factor 10 or so more than Elite in terms of requirements?  To get there, you likely want to automate stuff, according to rules. Or take joy and patience. Just keep doing what you do. It sounds like you got Elite in 1-2 months. Divide the TM requirements by ten and do your month's duty every month.  Think of TM and TW as this: An incentive. It is great that there is always a rank for 99.999% of the user base that they will likely never reach. It literally gives them a carrot to chase (which is good for everyone and can be quite fun if done the right way).  People seem to hate a seeding average system for instance. I suppose it is because it is not as fun as bonus points. You feel like an ARPG player, acquiring gold, runes, gems and scroll fragments. You maybe make an Excel spreadsheet just to check your BP income and see if you are on track for that user class you could reach in 36 months :p"

It's only a few US $ a month and it'll keep you going for a long while after.  I mostly snatch FLAC, though, which is a double-edged sword - it uses far more buffer to download, but in return you get far more upload when it (eventually) happens  If you can't afford a seedbox, just leave your torrent client running 24 hours a day.

It likely cost you more time than you would need to work to make those 3 bucks just posting here and coming back at me in another reply)  Edit Why I suggested whatbox is that of the big providers, they offer the smallest numbers for the same price. On WCD you do not need any quota or storage. You do not even really need speed, as initial swarms are limited by the uploader's speed. With Whatbox, you pay premium for some nice stuff. For comfort.

Sounds like you tried to use rTorrent (which is quite intuitive since it supports more torrents per client). It sadly does not work with pyWHATauto / auto-DL. I am sorry mate :(   is there really such a big difference between whatbox and feral seedboxes?   Not at all. They are both the créme de la créme.  One thing to keep in mind, there is not magic at play. What do I mean? Usually those torrents have 30 initial peers. Do you know what the sum of all ratio will be? 29. That means, in average, there is only a ratio of ~ 0.95  So for every ""me"" (4.0 initial ratio), there are 4 poor souls that can only reach ~ 0.25 ratio.  They are likely trying to save 5 bucks a month. On average I only get like ~ 1.5 ratio initially (it really varies) - but that is only the initial ratio. You keep things seeding for a week, and that is when they propell to 5.0+  Also damn, being informed about new releases through your bloody Plex library is fucking awesome.  So yeah, you do not need any tools. The first step is to slap on Deluge and just F5 the new torrents page. Once something CD + 2015 + FLAC turns up, spam download it.  Make sure you get ~ 0.5 ratio on those. That is the requirement. You do not need to be one of the 2.0 guys. 0.5 is enough. Once you can reproduce this, you automate. If you cannot consistently get a ratio of ~ 0.5 with Deluge on initial swarms, spam Feral support. That is what they are there for. Ask for your money back, if they cannot fix it."

trackers,3b27d4,SAKUJ0,-2,Fri Jun 26 12:56:03 2015 UTC,"You watch new torrents for following criteria:   Year: 2015 Source: CD Format: FLAC and/or V0   The trick is to grab those within the first 10 seconds when they get uploaded. This only works with Deluge - do not bother trying with rTorrent. Take my, WCD staff's, Feralhosting's and Whatbox's word for this, instead of discussing this.  You will be in the ""initial swarm"". ~ 30 people battling the ratio wars. When the battle is over, all Feral user's will sit at 1.0-4.0 ratio (sometimes 10.0-20.0). There will be some people with a cheap seedbox that sit around 0.6-1.0 ratio (the average will be (less than) 1.0).  This nets you an easy 5-10GB pure buffer every day (that is extra credit above 1.05 ratio, which is necessary for the higher user classes). If you aim for a ratio of 0.6, chances are you do this Deluge dance for a couple of days and then can forget about WCD stats forever.  Of course, it is reasonable to automate this. There are different tools.   Some make use of RSS, like FlexGet. They are not WCD compatible (as they are too late to the party) Others make use of IRC announces (auto-DL). They will get you to the party 2 seconds into the upload. You need that for WCD   Now, you cannot just blindly trust any tool. They are just a tool. You would not throw your hammer towards your HDTV and expect it to mount itself on the wall through magic. So you do things manually, the first ~ 5 times. Make sure you have a positive ratio. If that works, you enable auto-dl. You still have to sit next to the computer and literally wait until new torrents come up. Because if you leave auto-dl running unattended and do not know what you are doing, you might just ruin your ratio forever."
trackers,3b27d4,randi_rona,0,Thu Jun 25 23:04:19 2015 UTC,"So you do things manually, the first ~ 5 times   You mean having #announce open, and manually sending .torrents from there to deluge ASAP? or I'm mistaken?   Source: CD   no WEB?    This nets you an easy 5-10GB pure buffer every day (that is extra credit above 1.05 ratio, which is necessary for the higher user classes). If you aim for a ratio of 0.6, chances are you do this Deluge dance for a couple of days and then can forget about WCD stats forever.   Yeah, I'm already PU there, and aim to get elite and enough buffer to not worry for few years, really."
trackers,3b27d4,romeyroam,2,Thu Jun 25 23:59:25 2015 UTC,"You mean having #announce open, and manually sending .torrents from there to deluge ASAP? or I'm mistaken?   Exactly. To elaborate - sometimes it matters a little bit, if you get it in in 2 seconds or 10 seconds. You will play catch up for half a minute, if you are a little late. But that will just mean you lose 0.1-0.2 ratio.  But - usually it does not matter, because the actual uploader will be ~ 30 seconds late. For a ""proof of concept"" you do not need to be Lucky Luke.  IRC announces are ideal, because you can be binged whenever something gets posted (or get a notification on your desktop environment / smartphone)   no WEB?   You can go all the way and adjust things. The only requirement is that another user has to have the same automation set up. I can tell you right now, WEB is also automated by many people. But WEB is less restrictive. With CD, you get less torrents (I'd say 20 albums every day). You do not want too many. It's all a ratio goldmine either way. You will have to be responsible and tune things down. You should not do this in an attempt not having to long-term seed things.   enough buffer to not worry for few years, really   Try to balance this, if you can (we cannot tell you any more than to follow the rules). The rules say it is preferrable not to have too high a ratio.  I try to stick around 1.15. If I cannot download enough, I set my Deluge up to stop seeding my auto-dl stuff at a ratio of 0.6 or 1.0 (I still want the new stuff :p I love them). How awesome is that? One of those 30 people in the initial swarms actually says ""I want only 0.5"" - that means two others can have 1.25 in return.  Edit: When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all  You can actually steer your ratio. A ratio of 1.15 is always better than a ratio of 9.0 (no matter what people say).  With your auto-dl settings, monitor around. If you follow the new torrent page, you will quickly find out what other criteria people have. If you are an Alt-Rock nut, chances are you might want to be less restrictive with alternative rock and grab older things, too or whatnot. Maybe you hate Hip-Hop. Why grab it to begin with (we are assuming ratio is easy now, for people that can automate things the right way).  Heck, if you start this fun game, it is not far fetched to pipe your automation to auto transcoding and auto upping of V0. Free user classes all the way (: (check with the rules what is allowed)."

Dividing the amount of data you have uploaded by the amount of data you have downloaded gives you your ratio. A ratio of 1.0 is healthy because it means you have downloaded as much data as you have uploaded. Ratios significantly under 1.0 are unhealthy because it means that you are not contributing as much to the community as you are taking from it. Ratios significantly above 1.0 are also unhealthy because it means that you are “hoarding” upload instead of giving back to the community by downloading more.

There used to be Newzbin to find content but they got shut down. There are newer sites of course but I haven't had much luck with them.  I also use a VPN that plops me into the middle of an internet exchange. The company I host with ignores DMCA notices, which is nice. That said, I've never received one either.

So grab any VPN/Seedbox/VPS that is cheapest, has the traffic/quota and allows you to do what you want. With seedboxes, you often pay premium for disk I/O. With VPS, you often do not have a middle man, who is O.K with what you are doing.  If your current location is O.K upload wise (I somehow doubt that. If you had 100 mbps, you would likely have mentioned that), there is no reason to pay for storage / disk i/o elsewhere.  PIA might be a bad idea. I have heard better things about AirVPN. They are very transparent and are more focused towards the BitTorrent protocol (do not get me wrong, I use neither so cannot really vouch). But at least they have some decent documentation about how to forward ports and I have a decent picture of what speeds I can expect.  All that being said, a seedbox costs 10 bucks (let's say 15) and a VPN costs 5 bucks. WIth a seedbox, you have all seedbox benefits (like running a plex media server). With a seedbox you get additional storage. With a seedbox you get a VPN. With a seedbox you have quotas that you will not get close to from home.  Might be worth to pay 10 bucks instead of 5, to err on the safe side. Especially since most VPN providers blackmail you into paying a year in advance (as that cuts the price in half). I very much enjoy how seedboxes do not ask for twice the price, just because you want to test their service for 1-2 months. The most I know is Feral. They give 33% extra storage if you pay for the next year in advance."
trackers,3b2aed,SAKUJ0,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:00:07 2015 UTC,"My upload is 20mb which is ok for me. I'm not a very heavy user anyway.   I'm still edging towards VPN. That said, what seedbox are you talking about that costs 10$, includes a VPN, allows PMS and includes a reasonable traffic quota?  Thanks"
trackers,3b2aed,SAKUJ0,2,Thu Jun 25 13:45:30 2015 UTC,"kimsufi? but it's a dedi really, not a seedbox."
trackers,3b2aed,Lazarus-,0,Thu Jun 25 14:44:08 2015 UTC,"I would not call Kimsufi/OVH/Hetzner a ""middle man"". Quite far from it. That being said, I, too, would always go with a custom solution, such as Kimsufi, as I have the know-how and with a seedbox you (partly) pay for that.  Even if you go with a dedi, OP is looking for an ""end-point"" - such as via AirVPN. This discussion is about a seedbox having this end point functionality in it automatically."
trackers,3b2aed,escalat0r,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:42:12 2015 UTC,"I am a fan of going the 15 rather than 10 bucks route with Feral, Whatbox, ByteSized and similar.  I have seen other seedbox providers, that have plans that start from 10 bucks up. Seedhost I suppose?  I have not explored the seedboxes, that allow me to save 20-30%. I am amazed of what service we get for 15 bucks. I am a fan of grabbing them ""here"" and ""there"" - when needed.  Usually, you want to long-term seed and a permanent seedbox is not required for that.  However, when you pick up cheaper seedboxes (cheaper than 15 bucks), the first thing that suffers is storage capacity and disk input/output (a thing which you did not list as one of your three requirements). So I suppose the 5-10 buck seedboxes could work just as well, as long as you are reasonable with your CPU needs.  I don't see any seedbox host complain about not transcoded PMS usage (assuming they give you a secure shell to begin with)."
trackers,3b2aed,mannibis,2,Thu Jun 25 15:40:42 2015 UTC,"PIA is fine if you actually know what you are doing. I've been with them for 3 years and it works fine with torrents. If you were okay with seeding files before using your home connection then the VPN would work fine and give you more privacy overall online if you stay connected to it 24/7. Like some have said a lot of torrent sites don't allow you to use the VPN to browse their site (This is very stupid and don't support sites that do this and refuse to use them) so be warned and make sure you know the risk of this. If you don't have axx to hard to get into trackers like BTN, What.cd ETC then you should be fine using a VPN. It's only the hard to get into trackers that care about it."
trackers,3b2aed,escalat0r,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:41:20 2015 UTC,I would probably just set the torrent client to use the vpn though
trackers,3b2aed,mannibis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:59:35 2015 UTC,"Not sure if that is possible with a VPN, a VPN usually tunnels all your internet traffic (your browser, torrent client, OS updates etc.) through it, I wouldn't be aware of a way to do that just for one software.   You could do that with a proxy, PIA offers one.  I'd check out how you want to do it and look through /r/VPN or the Torrentfreak Link, these are good places to start and there are more providers than just PIA."

Since many (most actually, at least the decent ones) Seedbox providers will bundle in a VPN and some also offer a Usenet reader as additional software for your seedbox.  You could grab a free usenet account (they usually have limited download speeds which shouldn't matter too much as your seedbox will download it 24/7 and limited retention, which obviously can suck).  I'm with Seedhost.eu at the moment, they offer SABNzbd and a XSUsenet offers a free usenet account with 10 days retention and 1Mbit download, you could get multiple free accounts or a cheap block account but I personally don't miss Usenet that much."

I like detailed donation inquries as long as they are transparent. I do not like the part where they mention ""having to find other ways"". In the end, what I do, is I just stay away from the community and leech at minimum HnR on such trackers. This included HDA. If the begging reaches me, I would rather try to invite 1-2 people I trust and who I believe will donate.  I really like how GrindingGearGames approaches this. I know very few people who have dumped tens of thousands of dollars onto that game. And they never regreted it. And people salute them.

trackers,3aztjp,cyberden91,0,Thu Jun 25 23:19:34 2015 UTC,"I know. I believe it was even merged into upstream for a while. However, they still do not implement an API giving CouchPotato reliable (and secure) access to their database. That seems to be a requirement to be added as a Sonarr or CouchPotato provider these days.  The current TehC and HD-T providers for CP rely on parsing the web pages and you are entering your credentials in plain text on your host.  They work quite fine. But it is usually better to have a proper API - despite it being a rare occurrence of a screen grabber / page parser breaking.  I actually happen to have forked the TehC custom plugin so as to return better Release Names in the search results.  All that being said, for movies I usually prefer having the .torrents grabbed manually to have a portable watch folder for rtorrent/deluge and to perm seed that stuff.  HDA filled the perfect niche of stuff I do not wish to keep forever. I suppose I will cave in and use the HD-T custom plugin. HiDt is likely better quality than HDAccess anyway (I hope this is not insulting, I really like both groups a lot - but HiDt releases seem to be compared with TayTO or better releases regularly)."
trackers,3aztjp,SAKUJ0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:04:25 2015 UTC,That's true. Html parsing is really a last resort possibility and you have to give your credentials to your CP instead of an api key...

It maybe better to get the site online as it is and then work on a new site alongside in the background including the scripts for importing the database, then when everything is finally ready and tested it would be time to take the old site down, import the latest database (the import script would have been tested with an older import before) and then launch, this method has the least downtime.

trackers,3b1did,iN0M4D,0,Sat Jun 27 00:58:35 2015 UTC,Since it is for staging the site would not be under full load and therefore run just fine. I have a Gazelle test site running on $2 worth of VPS resources locally so it is possible.

And one that you can buy anonymously, and won't give over your db (encrypted or not), and accepts anon payments?  That doesn't even fit with DO's model, and they're far from anon or secure.  With all due respect, you're completely ignoring any of the real life facets for this.  Once it stops being a theoretical exercise, and starts being something that could put your staff in jail and risk the security of 35,000 people?  There's a lot more involved than just the cheapest level hosting.  Else we'd just throw it up on a personal server."
trackers,3b1did,mildlyincoherent,-1,Sat Jun 27 08:17:57 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, this is crazy. You're not facing any public load so the cron jobs are not massive and the CPU/RAM on a $2 VPS is plenty.  You can buy any VPS anonymously, prepaid credit cards are available anywhere and last I checked Tor/VPN is not very expensive.  Ignoring the obviously large security through obscurity advantage of no one giving a damn about what you do on a VPS, having a host hand over your database to law enforcement requires a court order. Once law enforcement has a court order you have been fucked for a while already and there is nothing you can do about it at that point. The cat is out of the bag, so to speak and they likely already have the main server since no hosting company on Earth can refuse a court order in their jurisdiction."
trackers,3b1did,o24,2,Mon Jun 29 08:25:15 2015 UTC,"A staging server by its very definition has close to a live copy of the database from production...that's what it means.  So yes, the chron jobs will still be intensive.     Security through obscurity is an atrociously poor security plan.  And any tracker operator who relies heavily on it shouldn't be trusted with user data.  If you create your own tracker you can do so as you choose.  But forgive me for not wanting to be so incredibly flippant about the security of 35,000 people.  Nor the prospect of jail time."
trackers,3b1did,mildlyincoherent,0,Mon Jun 29 15:16:15 2015 UTC,"Cron*  Additionally, the cron jobs for site activity are not tough enough to push the limits of a small VPS. The web/tracker load and user database activity are what tax resources. None of that is present in a staging environment.  I didn't argue that security through obscurity should be relied on heavily, nice cherry picking though. I merely pointed out that an anonymous VPS not facing the public internet adds zero extra risk to site security and writing it off as an option because of the law enforcement argument would require law enforcement to be looking in to PtP already in which case you would all already be fucked.  Keep working on the logic though buddy."

trackers,3azzmf,PowerTorrent1234,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:01:04 2015 UTC,up the paranoia (which you can on just about every tracker known to mankind) and you'll be set.
trackers,3azzmf,SAKUJ0,2,Thu Jun 25 03:50:50 2015 UTC,"That argument (""being part of a tracker [site] is not illegal"") is quite flawed.  Where I live, it is enough to be registered on a private site that keeps logs to consider that actual evidence for copyright infringement. Source: I was accused in court in a situation like that. All that ""this is technically not illegal"" bullshit is wrong on so many levels. Most of which, you are fucking giving legal advise for any jurisdiction on this planet without knowing jack shit.  You should feel bad. You are not entirely wrong. Historically speaking, your approach is quite safe - unless you do one of a whole bunch of things. That ""safety"" goes away where actual law enforcement gets into play (rather than just copyright trolls).  ""God oh boy, better register on this TOR based BitTorrent tracker that distributes child pornography, because /u/PowerTorrent1234 said that technically .torrent files are not illegal - it is what I do with them that is illegal!"""
trackers,3azzmf,PowerTorrent1234,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:10:43 2015 UTC,show me a source where it says its against the law to be a member of a tracker?  and if you are a tracker that distributes child porno you deserve everything coming to you.
trackers,3azzmf,SAKUJ0,2,Thu Jun 25 19:26:54 2015 UTC,"TL/DR It is not against the law to be a member of a tracker or even to grab the .torrent files or to upload them. However, tracker stats can be used as evidence against you. Technically.  A tracker logs very concrete information about what you ""snatched"" and when. It also has very concrete information about what you are ""seeding"".  Now, technically speaking, ""snatched"" is not ""infringed upon a copyright by downloading content you could pay for in retail"" and ""seeding a .torrent"" is not ""hosting copyright infringing material"" per sé.  But everyone knows it goes hand in hand. Unless you have administrative privileges or manipulation is at play, you snatching a .torrent coincides directly with you downloading the hash-linked material.  You will have a hard time convincing a court that you acquired your tracker stats by other means than actively infringing copyright, exactly like your log details you did.  That being said, there is currently nobody accusing you of doing anything and while that is the case, tracker stats cannot be used as ""evidence"", whether it technically is ""evidence"" or not.  A court, in many countries, will even extrapolate your criminal behavior over an extended period of time just by using a sample of a particular period of time, if they can prove you have been doing illegal things for years. (They catch you smuggling illegal substances and it turns out they can prove through payment records that you have been using that smuggling route twice a month exactly at that day and time for the last two years and your payment coincides with the amount of drugs you smuggled).  Yes, they can and will accuse you of having smuggled not just once but over two years, if they believe that. If you actually did do that, good luck on talking your way out on technicalities. ""Technically I could have been visiting my good friend Sergio, you cannot prove Jack Shit"" is more a line in movies, if you have been to court."

But having said that, since you pointed out that there are no ways to donate anonymously I'd be cautious. But for new users it wouldn't be a good decision to donate blindly to a tracker you've never joined, and don't know who the staff are. I'd definitely suggest getting an invite via the IRC channel or some other way first. You can always donate later if you want to but I'd definitely be cautious.. especially since they have a means of letting users ""buy"" accounts.

You really have to contribute beyond seeding what you take (probably infinitely to be worth it) to do well. I think you should be able to just seed what you download and be mostly OK; you shouldn't be penalized with lack of upload credit for not being able to upload since the ratio is already like 5000:1.  I hear about these credits on other trackers that you can get even for just seeding at all (i.e. without uploading, just being in that state) that you can exchange for upload credit. That makes so much sense and it makes me frustrated that What doesn't have it."

trackers,3at5dr,ScrewAttackThis,2,Wed Jun 24 03:01:47 2015 UTC,if you grab every freeleech torrent and seed 24/7 you will certainly see upload credit. (also make sure you're connectable)  part of why what is set up that way is to encourage people to add new content and fill requests
trackers,3at5dr,webtwopointno,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:43:16 2015 UTC,Is there any way to autodownload all the FL torrents?
trackers,3at5dr,Fatvod,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:43:31 2015 UTC,"there are scripts i'm sure, google or search the forums.  I use a browser extension such as downthemall! that downloads every available download on the page. go here for a list of all freeleech torrents: https://what.cd/torrents.php?freetorrent=1"
trackers,3at5dr,webtwopointno,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:59:19 2015 UTC,It's part of why what is so successful. You have to seed in the hops you can get those few megabytes of upload credit to download more content. They do more than enough freeleach that will net you quite a bit of upload. I have 150gb from just FL.
trackers,3at5dr,xTheDeathlyx,3,Wed Jun 24 03:19:59 2015 UTC,"Freeleech doesn't net you upload unless you're one of the seedboxes way up there in speed. Plus, downloading crap you don't want to get upload really shouldn't be necessary. (If you do want the freeleech content, more power to ya I suppose)."
trackers,3at5dr,jtaylor991,4,Wed Jun 24 03:45:57 2015 UTC,Not true.. I downloaded about 50 FL torrents that weren't fresh and have gotten about 10gb. All about the waiting game.

trackers,3at5dr,xTheDeathlyx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:38:09 2015 UTC,it has nothing to do with luck. it's time and connection speed. if you have a slower connection you'll need to seed for longer periods of time. i got a 20gb buffer the last round of FL
trackers,3at5dr,lrn2cs,0,Thu Jun 25 18:32:34 2015 UTC,"Right, the seedboxes virtually monopolize most of the seeding with their speed. I might see up to one or two megabytes a week with 20mbps upload."
trackers,3at5dr,jtaylor991,2,Thu Jun 25 19:05:02 2015 UTC,That's not true at all. I have a ratio of 4.73 on a 4.92gb file. That means I've uploaded 23gb. I downloaded this file May 18. This means I've averaged 6 KB/s upload and this was on PTP.
trackers,3at5dr,lrn2cs,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:20:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the point of making it difficult to get upload is to ensure that as few torrents as possible get deleted for inactivity."

The so called ""shitty questions"" could be there to see how you react, or perhaps just to make it a little more fun, a common one is private tracker staff asking a potential new member to draw something for an invite.

I see you mentioned this in a different branch altogether.  I partly understand your point that you waited all that time just to find out the tracker wasn't what you personally wanted, but it doesn't change the fact that they are volunteers giving up their own time to interview people like yourself to give you the opportunity to join what is essentially a free service and you offer them absolutely no gratitude in return. They do this because they want to recruit good new members to their community which they obviously feel passionate about. What's more you could have done your homework to find out more about baconbits first before getting to this stage, there's plenty of places on the Internet where you could have found out more information about them and you would have realised that they're a good starting private tracker. In other words if you've been active on private trackers for years and especially if you're on top tier trackers, then there is unlikely to be a great deal for you on baconbits in the way of content, so unless you particularly feel that you want to become involved in their community you probably wouldn't want to seek an invite."

One fact is that people are watching 720p x265 as we speak. The required bitrates are quite promising (a fifth of the x264 version - if not far less).  Edit Getting x264 ready took what? 2 years? x265 is already being developed since 2013. It is considered absolutely stable. If anything needs time, it is likely the hardware and spreading of H.265 itself.  All that being said, all the hardware limitations do not apply to 720p x265 content at all, to my knowledge. I am glad if somebody corrects me on this one. Sure, your first gen ION/atom will not handle it. Your desktop will, though.  Pretty sure in 2-3 years we have decent hardware decoders for h/x265, would you not agree? Going on a x264 crusade to migrate rare content right now, would be stupid. x265 will be an improvement so vast, chances are migration happens automatically.  Also, I know people who were dumb enough to transcode their existing libraries to x265 720p and use them right now. Yes, utterly retarded and a huge quality loss. But compression is insane."

Nobody reasonably intelligent is going on a crusade to convert existing content, especially not transcoding existing XviD/x264 releases because that is by definition a lossy conversion.  The compression of x265 is pretty decent, the quality and compatibility is currently not. People also watch YIFY rips. A LOT of people. I don't care what most people do, I care what people who know what they're doing do, and I don't think there's anyone who genuinely thinks x265 > x264 right now.

So, in other words, same BluRay source, same bitrate, the quality of x264 will be better than x265?  I thought, the only reason not to prefer x265 over x264 was the compatibility aspect. To my knowledge, there are no GPUs (yet 1-2 exceptions) available that can give VDPAU-like hardware decoding capabilities. So people end up having to rely on their CPU, which only cuts the job for 720p content right now.  If you are saying, the quality of x265 at same bitrate/source etc. is simply worse than x264, then I will certainly look things up / try things out. In that case thank you.  Hope you do not think I am arguing with you, here. I find your input to be informative and we are in 100% agreement concerning the things that I indeed understand. Like YIFY rips."

If someone uploads a dupe, report it. Done.  There is already a tracker out there where everything is x264. Actually, quite a few of them. I don't get the point of this change at all."

trackers,3api87,RedDunce,8,Mon Jun 22 21:18:50 2015 UTC,"The difference is 128kbps mp3 was never the STANDARD or the best option at the time. XviD was. Pretty much every SD movie prior to the late 2000's was encoded with XviD. Sure, there is occasionally a 128kbps radio rip that surfaces for an album that is pretty much impossible to buy, but that is what the forums and IRC are for.  Also, XviD is a codec, not a quality. It may be an inferior codec at the same size...Kind of like another codec: mp3, when compared to ogg vorbis. In other words, to me this would be more like What banning MP3s to push the superior ogg vorbis codec. Of course mp3 has more compatibility (although...so does XviD) and is more widely used and is the scene standard, but from a technical standpoint, it's inferior, just like XviD."

You understand, this is not comparable in any way? On WCD, chances are you make a request, somebody buys the album and it is on there.  The rule with bitrates above 192 kbps is very sane. Why? 192 or higher is not reliably proven not to be transparent anymore.  So WCD considers everything below 192kbps lower quality and everything above that transparent enough.  This is not so with TV. Take Futurama, for instance. You cannot just argue that anyone who would want to upload a SCENE release from 2000 could just buy the DVDs and do a perfect x264 rip. We might actually be getting there, things are really easy these days even for ""monkeys"" with handbrake etc.  But they really aren't comparable (yet).  You should never expect 128 kbps rips, as there is human error involved. Human error that is 100% avoidable. There is nothing wrong about an old XviD version - if and only if no better version is available. It was the bloody standard for half a decade.  Also, MP3 bitrate is a direct measure of quality. Technically speaking, XviD/DivX says nothing about quality, whatsoever.  That is like arguing WMA files would have lower quality than MP3 files in general (which is a stupid argument).  Edit also I would argue that series like Friends or The Daily Show with John Oliver are just as enjoyable with lower quality. Take the ridiculous statement. Imagine we take quality to zero. We end up with no picture. Friends and John Oliver is still enjoyable. Now do that with music. You end up with no sound. Damn, suddenly there is no music left to enjoy.  Also your WCD argument is inherently... sorry it just is ignorant. WCD does allow bitrates below ~ 100 kbps. Just not for fucking music. Please, try to be a bit more open-minded about this. Because having music below 192 kbps is left for retards. Do you really want to watch your Friends seasons at 120 GiB 1080p remuxes per season instead of a sane 4-25 GiB. Then, you just dedicated 1.3 TiB of your storage for Friends episodes."

Trust me, nCore banning people from uploading XviD won't change Jack shit in terms of what content is being produced. No offense to them, but they're practically irrelevant from a content PRODUCTION standpoint. They're a great resource for existing releases, but they (along with just about any general / scene tracker) really don't have any sway in terms of what content gets released.  The only people still producing XviD encodes from sources are individuals who can't play x264, or who release to places that prefer it. The only places that actually have any impact imo would be Rutracker, IPT (where most big releasers do both), PTP (which allows XviD to coexist, but where the userbase heavily encourages x264) and ""the scene"" (which already uses x264 as its standard). You're acting like a tracker like nCore outright banning a codec will influence anybody to stop using / releasing it. That's just not the case.  Imo it's an unnecessary rule change that wastes both staff (who will now have to do this whole manual approval process, and also moderate torrents more strictly) and uploaders time."

During those years, a lot of XviD videos were created. Nobody is replacing all of them. Nobody will replace all of them, no matter what an arbitrary tracker decides - even if it is BTn.  Heck, what about daily shows from those years? We have no fucking sources for them. Should we ban them all and remove them from history?  So, they should be allowed to exist.

The Scene releases by the rules on which all participating groups must agree, I believe many scene groups are aware that some of those rules are outdated but making concensus between all those groups is not easy to achieve.   In our p2p world thanks to torrent protocol people don't have those problems, even if you lose your connection you will not lose what you have downloaded. It would be good to know why so many trackers still choose to upload rared releases instead of unrared? The only reason I could think of are pre times, If tracker chose to upload unrared their pre times would be slower by few minutes and it would look like other trackers are better than them so they would be less l33t, but 0day trackers for those few minutes of faster pre times pay higher price in lower retention of torrents, because seedboxes stop seeding those releases after few days and move on to newer things, the users who download from home are those who keep torrents alive for years, but why would anyone waste hdd space to store useless rar files, so people just stop seeding after short while.   I believe all 0day trackers would improve their retention and would have healthier economy if they choose to be more user friendly and unrar releases before uploading them to the tracker, but it's not only for the scene hard to leave old ways behind, or maybe trackers have other benefits from rared releases of which I'm not aware of"

I thought that the scene origins are from late 1970s when they used bbs to share files?   As for changing rules I wasn't necessarily thinking about rar archives but in general, like I believe the scene is aware that p2p groups produce better quality encodes, or that p2p groups are able to ""crack"" some modern games using emulation which is forbidden by scene rules and changing the rules could improve all that. I wasn't trying to argue that rar archives aren't useful for the scene rather that they are unnecessary for p2p.  Edit: Trackers auto bots after downloading rar archives can use scripts to automatically unrar releases and upload them that way, the process would take few extra minutes, but only users with seedboxes and with auto downloading scripts give importance to those few extra minutes and that's only for those users who want to cross-seed to other trackers as soon as possible, majority of regular users wouldn't start downloading the moment torrent is uploaded to the tracker anyway."

Since almost all uploads on scene trackers are done by bots who also seed it then less space for longer seeding would be available and you would also have to make sure there was space enough for un-raring too.

trackers,3al5ly,EraYaN,13,Sun Jun 21 11:11:16 2015 UTC,"Private trackers are obviously very restricted as to which hosting providers they can use and in what countries. For a fairly large and active private tracker like Bitsoup you need a fairly powerful server to handle a LAMP setup (please look it up on Google if you don't understand this) along with running the tracker which uses a lot of resources in itself, some will have a separate server for MySQL and a SSD is recommended for better performance. A cloud server for the money you claim would probably just about run the site if there was barely any active members, E.g. for staff testing purposes only, but as soon as it became even slightly active it wouldn't be anywhere near sufficient and if it was setup as on a cloud server it would need a fortune in resources if it was allowed to use what it needed from the cloud and it wouldn't be feasible.   On top of normal server costs many trackers like Bitsoup have been forced to pay additional costs for DDoS protection. Bitsoup like quite a few private trackers use Cloudflare and for any sort of reasonable DDoS protection this service costs $200 a month on it's own. I won't go into full technical details here, but private trackers who use Cloudflare also need yet another server for everything to work properly, it doesn't have to be as powerful as the main server, but it's another significant additional cost on top of everything else. There are also other smaller costs that I haven't mentioned.  Edit: typo, sever corrected to server."

And it pipes the stuff though to a cluster/single server running php-fpm preferably (or on the same server). Or something written for the job in any language really, be it a script language or something native (The only thing I never got any good performance out is ruby (Redmine in my case, damn that stuff is easy to get slow)). It can also handle SSL/TLS termination although there are some load balancers that are better at that.   nginx isn't some magical wonder solution here and it irks me when people claim nginx can solve everyone's problems.   Of course it's not, but in the case of a php app running not as a module (I just never liked the way that worked), Apache is basically just sending the requests through (Fast)CGI anyway. Nginx is just better at that.   Please provide a detailed breakdown, including costs, location and specifications of your deployments/servers and where we can purchase them for the same cost.   For the quick break down:   3 servers running mysql cluster 5.5 (7.3 i think) (all masters, using the cluster version) Average 60€/mo for the 3 of them, depends on the season, if there are a lot of orders it can spike to 100€/mo. I think the databases are about 1 GB on both servers, it is mostly reads, maybe in the future they will switch to a different server from mysql because of that. Standard A1's, it would be cheap to go for azure tables, but that would require a software change and developers are expensive (doesn't look good on managements report I guess) 1 storage account serving static documents (they receive an id and serve a file (over http)) (About 1.5 TB right now, pretty low traffic mostly, couple of high write blobs (logs)) about 30-50€/mo (local redundant) 2 webservers running both a nginx (1.6.x) and php-fpm (5.5.x) install on the same machine, but as most stuff is database heavy the biggest load is on the mysql cluster. These are scraping by with A1 instances. Sure they are loaded something like 60% all (work) day, but it's pretty even (minus the break time) (about 50 to 70 €/mo) 1 azure DNS load balancer (I think we spend less then 5€ a month on dns queries)   Note: all systems are running a flavour of *nix. Windows server takes a little more power. Note2: Sure it is not very globally active, really just MS EU-North datacenter to office building and surrounding cities, it could have been hosted on premise but it was too much of an investment for them, while they would have had better performance, the report queue can take up to 2 full minutes to get a 50 page pdf report.  The system is basically one static template (doesn't run through php), one js file, one css file, 4 images and a sprite sheet (font). All cached by the browser for a long time. The rest is json requests and direct download requests to the azure storage servers (after a json is received with the url). The system is mainly used for document storage and retrieval and incident recording (very small but many database rows) and the reports on that. So the webservers are optimized for caching and handling a lot of requests but very small ones. The reports ar ethe one thing that is really server intensive, thus we queue all of them to wait for less load and ping the user when the report is ready for download (from the storage account)  All services are hosted in the northern Europe region. All running on Microsoft Azure managed by an in-house ""tool"" that I think just uses SSH tunnels to execute scripts and uses powershell commands for anything azure related. I don't think they took the time to do it using the ""proper"" API. It's also a very slow tool.  Now I am the guy mainly there to tell people when it stopped working and the guy who set up most of the configs in the dev environment before we pushed that almost 1 on 1 to the production environment, really just a couple of weeks of testing and messing with config files and testing again, I won't presume to be a cloud service expert, but regarding the costs, we have a monitor running on a screen for them that shows the azure account page costs (you know those fancy bar graph things) and on the other end some ""performance"" metrics (just to have something move I guess)   The other ones I have set up are mostly either small (read running on less than 100€ a month) or dead (management's vanity projects anyone).   Technically you can, but you would be foolish to do so and it would be taken down very quickly and easily.   Well fair enough so really the only difference is the fact you get taken down, I have never dealt with questionable clients no idea on the take down policy used by microsoft/amazon. The way I see services is mainly it is just a bunch of requests wanting to get answered. Doesn't really matter what they are, I have found Azure and AWS especially to be pretty damn scalable. (With pretty low effort)   Exactly.

With respect, you're assuming this is way easier and cheaper than it is. If it was really that easy and cheap, everyone would be doing it. The fact they aren't speaks volumes.   Never said it was easy and besides the number I made up are ""educated guesses"" not irrational. Now I'm not on BitSoup, so I have no idea how actively all their users are hammering the servers. But 200 requests per second is A LOT of users. And again it's not easy, that is why I have a job. (I really don't want it to be easy either)  I have started little hosting projects over the past years (donation based) I always started with ""extra"" money to keep it running for at least a couple of years, all of them have died out after I lost interest, but is was not really a problem raising 100 pounds a month with about 100-120 active users, a tracker with many more should be able to do better. I know that relation is sadly not linear, but is should be doable with thousands of users, if not you are not important enough for your users so you might as well quit.   Comparing a donation based tracker to an actual deployed project where there is financial backing, paid staff, redundancy, etc is ridiculous. You're trying to compare apples and oranges.   It does not really make a difference where the money comes from for the provider they will bill you all the same, in that sense they are very much comparable.  I'm very interested to learn about the real numbers involved with trackers, you need a mysql server right next to your (double?) tracker software hosting boxes? Or are there all in ram trackers?"
trackers,3al5ly,EraYaN,3,Sun Jun 21 15:23:53 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly, you lose (most of) the ""connection memory"" Apache takes. And it pipes the stuff though to a cluster/single server running php-fpm preferably (or on the same server). Or something written for the job in any language really, be it a script language or something native (The only thing I never got any good performance out is ruby (Redmine in my case, damn that stuff is easy to get slow)). It can also handle SSL/TLS termination although there are some load balancers that are better at that.   ""Connection memory""? LOL. Please. Deploying nginx will do nothing to help reduce your PHP usage, which is where the bulk of the work goes on a tracker site. Again you're elaborating unnecessarily trying to make your responses sound more educated and intelligent than they actually are.   Your original point was to use it (nginx) to somehow save money or gain more performance. You are wrong. Let me reiterate; switching to nginx may save you some RAM (and even a well tweaked Apache installation can be comparable) but it will not help overall performance at all. CPU is what you need here for PHP processing. There is no magic bullet or solution for this. No drop-in replacement that will magically reduce the consumption at all. Optimization only goes so far. Caching is, of course, not a possibility, but ultimately you just need more CPU power behind it.  You appear to assume requests per second relates to static images or files that nginx can otherwise serve directly. You are very wrong.   Of course it's not, but in the case of a php app running not as a module (I just never liked the way that worked), Apache is basically just sending the requests through (Fast)CGI anyway. Nginx is just better at that.   Except no it's not. At all. PHP still needs to be invoked and the script processed, and nginx has no bearing on that what so ever. You have the false illusion of performance benefits here.   'Snip your breakdown of usage' ...   So with your breakdown I can already see your initial quotes are and were bullshit. Remember, you said the following:   500 dynamic request per second or 2000 static ones for like 10-20 € a month   Yet you're spending almost 5x more than that (and more) doing apparently less. Funny, really. Called it.   Well fair enough so really the only difference is the fact you get taken down, I have never dealt with questionable clients no idea on the take down policy used by microsoft/amazon. The way I see services is mainly it is just a bunch of requests wanting to get answered. Doesn't really matter what they are, I have found Azure and AWS especially to be pretty damn scalable. (With pretty low effort)   And with this you've perfectly demonstrated your utter ignorance on the subject matter. This isn't simply a hosting issue. There are many logistics involved in running and managing a tracker. You don't get to pick and choose your infrastructure based on price, availability or location. These aren't simply ""requests wanting to get answered"". There's a lot more to it than that. Security, protection and other factors come into play.   but is was not really a problem raising 100 pounds a month with about 100-120 active users, a tracker with many more should be able to do better.   100 pounds a month is certainly achievable. The problem is, it's likely going to cost you a lot more than that to run a decent tracker. Most of the popular sites I've been a part of rarely meet their donation goals every month. Yes, even the very big and well known ones. It's hard to maintain any decent infrastructure when the money isn't there.  In fact, I believe only one site I use actually gets enough from donations every month to cover costs.   It does not really make a difference where the money comes from for the provider they will bill you all the same, in that sense they are very much comparable.   What? How can you even respond with such a ridiculous statement? Of course it matters where the money is coming from.  These projects you've worked on likely have significant funding behind them. It's not as if you're going to live month to month wondering if your bills are going to be paid or not. With some trackers it's like that. If donation targets are not met, the rest of the money has to come from somewhere doesn't it? Is that your pocket? If not, the servers will get shut down. It's really that simple. It's irrelevant that the provider bill you. What a very, very strange response you've given there."

Not all though, I have been in the position (back when I was hosting game servers, damn never again NOW THOSE are expensive (€ to user ratio)) that every month it was the question if we could continue. It was a response to your apple and oranges statement. I meant to say that a provider will not bill you more depending on who you are (at least not where I live). So the infrastructure is definitely comparable in the end it just a webserver or a collection of webservers.  For the rest I guess you are right. Tracker software apparently sucks ass to host...

Well we switched on some projects and made it impossible of one dude with some nasty packets to kill the server in a couple of minutes. Sure both can be killed, every server has its fair share of problems.

I'm actually honestly curious, I was fighting with some varnish and memcached and for most pages it actually helped a lot. Only things that didn't work were the user specific pages. Now this was a smarty (php template engine) based website so we could cache using smarty as well (parts of the page). But why wouldn't you want to cache stuff? It can speed thing up by a fair amount.

Possibly because it's a common and popular language. PHP is nowhere near as bad as you believe, or are making it sound. Yes, you may have used it 15 years ago, that just speaks volumes as to its popularity and longevity.  PHP has never been ""bad"". What's ""bad"" about it is how easy it is to develop and code for, which results in lost of people writing very bad code. As a scripting language it's perfectly fine.  Put it this way.. Facebook uses PHP. That should be enough of an advertisement if it ever needed one."

I think a better testimony for PHP than facebook are private trackers. They are some of the biggest targets out there.  However, I always had the feeling that it is easy to do things the wrong way with PHP.

As it stands, Bitsoup is a dysfunctional Dinosaur heading for extinction. Where the hell will I get my scene releases now? Ohh that's right, anywhere I want. Unlike those mostly brain dead sycophantic Vip's it would seem. :) And for the record. I donate to trackers...Good trackers, not BitSoup. So I am not just a cheap ass."

No coding needed to make that site.  That's why the game site looks a 1000 times better than Bitsoup. Of course some of the colors in that theme they chose to use is clashing and some of the text is hard to read. I doubt they even know how to change any of that. If they can't code PHP on their site, they will never be able to customize the IPB code as its a bit more difficult to code.  Bitsoup has looked and felt the same for the past 10 years and never has it changed. The only thing that we get to see new on a daily basis is those Begging Messages for donations. Oh wait, I forgot, we did get new icons for the categories."

Its not funny at all they are sending to the same place : a little insider knowledge for you, ive been with bitsoup pretty much since the beginning and like most member's have learnt to block out the begging, ive donated a few times as and when, built a ratio based on the deals and the platinum memeber ship half price last decemeber, if they reset, that's the straw that will break the camels back for me, im gone. but they are all interlinked , in fact server wise they are neighbors hosted in Canada , despite what they may lead you to believe  however, what a lot of people don't seem to know is rexxy is the CEO for what used to be called moxie hosting, its a different name now but its the very sean corbin, and i lovetorrents is also hosted by them, im pretty now they are called moxie colo, this has always been the case even since the dragonheart days (who im pretty sure is there in the back ground just in god mode ( a common mode in TB source based web sites such as bitsoup Its this point that irratates me about bitsoup, i once had a torrent site ( didnt last long) hosted by them, this is how i got to know rexxy, dragonheart and the sysop of i lovetorrent, i cant remember his alternative name but remember his first name was shamus, i love torrents and the site i used to run came on the back of the closure of firefiles (anyone remember that one?) also moxiehosting, the server i rented was a about 300 a month, wasn't very busy so suited , but as an invested interest of corbin i honestly don't see bitsoup servers costing much at all, just a little extra income for him and the fact that he refuses so quickly to be more transparent about sever costs makes him all the more dodgy - he was a twat end back then and still is, im not a recently disgruntled customer of moxie by the way, this was about 2010, i stopped giving a shit years ago  Just a bitsoup member who has had his last nerve grated on by the ""reset ratio"" thing :)"

The funny thing is, Rexxz is using IPB on the money laundering site known a gamerzmuse.com he created a month or so back when they lost PayPal. I have no clue as to why he wouldn't use that software to incorporate Bitsoup into it. As that software is a thousand times more efficient than the software he currently uses for Bitsoup.

After the whole drama between them and BTN we've stopped calling them the scourge of the earth, whether that's good or bad for private trackers as a whole we don't know.   But IPT reigns atop the list of general private trackers when considering everything but community(when community encompasses owner). They have the most seeded content delivered the fastest, with the largest user base. Almost everything is seeded for longevity. It's mostly because of their large user base and how easy it is.   People can talk up Torrentleech all they want but it is anything but friendly to the ratio of new members. Others are difficult to get into and generally have the same content as IPT.

After such a long period of time, and knowing full well that the IPT cunt continues to steal peers from them on an hourly basis right in front of their eyes, one would have to assume that that there is nothing being done....that they (FiLELiST) have given up even trying...that eliminating the current peer thieving accounts and then monitoring for possible future peer thefts is clearly WAY over their head(s).  I have posted on their website, asking why the peer stealing continues, and all they could muster was a meek and mild ""we're trying, but it's hard to catch him....blah blah blah"".   BTN found a way to stop the peer stealing...SCC found a way to stop it...trackers with good SysOps / coders / developers all find a way....but FiLELiST can't figure out how to do it??  This is why it's my opinion that FiLELiST Administration has unofficially 'thrown in the towel' with regard to the peers theft.  All that being said, if I were you, I wouldn't download or seed ANY popular international torrents (popular movies, TV shows, etc.) or ANY XXX torrents from FiLELiST because, if you do, I can guarantee you that IPT & Co. will be stealing (using) your bandwidth to seed those same torrents (which were stolen from FiLELiST, along with the peers) on IPT & Co. trackers such as Scenetime, TorrenTing and Torrentday.."

You want somewhere between 18-24, though some grainier encodes can lie between 14-18.

I should add that HDB are by far the best purveyors of quality. It's mainly their trumping rules that set it apart from AHD though. TehC has great encodes, as does AHD.

Is it animated?) and so there is no one size fits all approach to what the ""right"" settings are.  Using comparison screenshots (source vs encode1 vs encode2 vs encode3) helps tremendously.

Slightly better than the PTP GP's I've downloaded. That's because AHD encoders actually compare and look for the best source, so if the European Blu-Ray has better quality they encode from the European BluRay rather than the American one. Sometimes if quality differs they use hybrid sources too, splicing parts of different encodes together to get the best source.  D-ZON3 is an AHD internal, but his 1080p encodes are so good that even some people on public trackers know that his encodes (at least the ones that have leaked out) are the shit."

When splicing is done, you match the right frame from 2 different encodes and replace the frames you want. It's entirely invisible to the human eye.  It's NOT like a fan edit where they cut out bits and pieces of the movie so it becomes different. This kind of splicing only improves the picture quality, the final edit is the exact same runtime as the original sources.

trackers,3ag5v9,Coop_the_Poop_Scoop,10,Sat Jun 20 01:33:19 2015 UTC,"I think the Scene is all about seeing which group can release a movie, an album, a TV episode, an application, a game, etc the fastest. Only one release is allowed to exist, so whichever group releases first, their release will be THE release. Doing so will gain them respect and reputation among the Scene community. But of course there are certainly ways a group can ruin their own reputation, for example, releasing a game with a broken crack, releasing a movie or a TV episode with glitched audio and/or video or shit picture quality that doesn't meet the Scene minimum quality guidelines (which aren't really that good to begin with), etc. Those releases with get NUKED and when that happens, any group can then release a PROPER, which basically is a proper version of said release.

trackers,3agq4h,o24,-1,Fri Jun 26 23:32:07 2015 UTC,You can just change the main folders' name and get a new hash
trackers,3agq4h,onsite,2,Sat Jun 20 01:43:41 2015 UTC,"Entirely true.  However, if you're still seeding that folder, you can't change the folder name and reseed.  You can reseed the same folder and generate a new hash if you vary the piece size, of which there are only a few really viable choices, depending on the file size.  You can, however, create another folder and hard link the files into it and then create a new torrent.  If seeding across multiple sites this ends up being a unique folder for each site and can be difficult to manage unless you create a potentially complicated directory structure.  mktor eliminates the need for any of that."

Especially, since trackers can close (TvT).  What speaks for MTV is their insane retention. They are making quite an effort to enable that. Donation money does not go to some sysop's amazon account (not saying any other tracker's donations go there) - but to make this possible.  So once something is sucked into MTV, you can be sure it stays there.  To me, the tracker is just the platform. We cannot cry wolf and complain about how trackers do not technically do anything illegal and instead say their users do - while at the same time not contributing to the tracker ourselves.  The users are making the content and MTV does quite a good job of enabling them to do so. This speaks even more for ToTV. One day, ToTV will utterly boom and people will be sad if they miss that."

I meant the first sentence as a good thing.  Imagine BTn had to close its doors one day to the other (a bit like oink, or TvT - not comparable I know, but bare with me). In a circumstance like that, something will replace BTn.  I am not saying ToTV will make BTn pointless or anything. I am saying, if BTn disappeared (for whatever reason), ToTV would be a great platform to migrate to. I suspect it will do far better than waffles, when compared directly to BTn, as well (though that is pure speculation)."

trackers,3agzte,SAKUJ0,2,Sun Jun 21 09:59:58 2015 UTC,"My point is, it is the users responsibility. Not staff's responsibility. If you believe, that too few users upload, start uploading yourself.  Often, staff and contributing users are the same people, there is obviously a huge correlation - especially in the beginning.  But you are literally asking for staff to make sure content is there. Why should they contribute stuff that they do not want on their own or do not deem otherwise popular?  If every user just contributed his one favorite, missing show/season to a tracker, there would not be much missing, soon enough.  MTV, ToTV and even BTn are just a platform. You make a point that the user bases are what make a tracker and I absolutely agree, but you are one of them.  Once a tracker grows in content, it grows in users and then again it grows in content etc. If it keeps growing (and I believe MTV still wants to grow quite a bit), you will not have stuff missing anymore. Bots will automate that process - but the site is so new, the user classes are not even implemented yet.  Have some patience, give it time. Having people contribute more can be achieved by giving them an incentive."

So b4 telling them to join in you need to tell them what they're getting now not what they might get after they complete a request app and wait for days or after years of buildup , if they want to do that that's fine but they need to know what they should expect if they were to get an invite today."

A place that basically has the most popular elements of all music, games, TV, and movies.   I do download mostly scene video, but I also play games, for example, and sometimes I can't find very basic or popular titles on TL."

That's because the next season is up: Now the fanboi group in the forum (the only people left who can speak up w/o getting banned) are discussing a site ""re-boot"" with a reset of all ratios, i.e. getting more $$$ from members who did a lot of uploading to build their ratio or already paid $$$. And how this scam could affect future donations, esp. with the site closing down every other day :->  But remember it isn't all fun and games: As REXXZ writes in their payment faq: ""After doing business with our members for over 11 years, you can rest assured that we have your security in mind and is priority one - our very own welfare and security depends on it"".

I read your post and to be honest, what you said in that thread was not degrading nor rude. Your post was made in a polite way and to the point and they didn't like being called out. So they banned you.  Which is my point, go find a better site, there are quite a few out there that are much better than Bitsoup and don't constantly beg you on a daily basis for donations.  They are so full of crap, they now feel that their torrent site is legit and all content that they post is of legal nature. Saying that all scene groups pay for their content they post...lol Little do they know if you go to the store and buy it legally, doesn't give you the legal right to make a copy and post it to millions of people, you are still breaking the law and no matter what the admins of that site say, their site is just as illegal as the next. Hell their cams of movies shows that laws are being broken.  If you use a VPN you can visit any site you wish and download anything you like with the same amount of security that Bitsoup claims that they are superior  above all other torrent sites.  I use a VPN and have been downloading from public torrent sites such as Extratorrent, Scenetime and Kickass for many years and never once got a warning, so piss on Bitsoup and be glad you are no longer part of their money scamming site.  As for viruses, if you have your own protection, then you need not worry about that either, which is another thing Bitsoup feels they are superior over other torrent sites. And I must say, I've never downloaded a torrent that had a virus. I think they just make this crap up to make insecure people feel more insecure about leaving their sorry ass site."
trackers,3abd8z,ezodo,2,Thu Jun 18 20:05:53 2015 UTC,"Well, your bad tbh. It's clear that bitsoup has a spirit of open and honest discussion like Stalin's Russia or Kim's North Korea. You just don't talk openly to such leaders, and that includes bitsoup's site owner or pet mod.  They depend on bullshitting users by saying that things will get really really bad in the near future if people don't pay them, but they can rely on bitsoup staying open and sprawling (otherwise people wouldn't commit to a long-term investment into masses of credits).  What annoys me is that they don't follow their own rules, that's because content praising their donation scam system treated in a much nicer way on their board than criticism even though both violate the site rules."
trackers,3ae8hs,Narhen,4,Fri Jun 19 12:11:31 2015 UTC,"24 hours is not really a long time for a private tracker, depending on tracker and content. Some trackers are also heavily populated by seedboxes, which have higher speeds. Bittorrent protocol favours these faster connections, while avoiding slow home connections. As long as you are connectible you don't have to upload any data for it to count as seeding time either.  Basically, private trackers are generally much harder to seed on. Most trackers have rules for minimum seeding time and/or ratio, but you never have to achieve a certain ratio within a certain timeframe, so don't worry about that. Your best bet is just to be patient and get used to the fact that you will not be able to instantly download terabytes worth of data."

trackers,3ab8td,lukefwjross,2,Thu Jun 18 23:37:43 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend setting up XAMPP. You'd only actually use apache out of that and it wouldn't do anything to protect you in terms of security. If you're concerned about people trying to brute-force your login you may want to look into Fail2Ban. Otherwise just make sure you use a strong password.  You should also look into setting up https if you're not doing that already so that people can't steal your login when you're on untrusted networks.

trackers,3ab8td,ScootMulner,2,Fri Jun 19 14:21:47 2015 UTC,Another option is setting up a VPN for your network. The advantage is that you can use keys to control access and you get access to your entire network. It can be a bit more cumbersome to login since you first need to connect to your VPN before you can access the website.

trackers,3a9nq7,mogoxx,2,Thu Jun 18 22:08:42 2015 UTC,"A good member is willing to donate all their money.....NO before you vote me down I'm only joking, lol! Obviously a respectable private tracker needs a certain amount of donors to cover expenses and donors are greatly supporting a private tracker as without them a private tracker simply wouldn't exist, but there's many outstanding members that are greatly supporting private trackers without ever donating a cent. What these members give is just as important, if not more so than donations as without them the tracker also wouldn't exist and they passionately put personal time and effort into supporting the tracker.  Staying fairly active, keeping a good ratio and sticking to the rules helps a private tracker. It is good enough to keep an account in good standing and you are a good member by doing this, but some of the very best members upload well described content to the site themselves as well, it doesn't have to be big releases either as there's normally loads of members racing to upload them after they're pre'd / released, instead it can be more obscure content, anything that other members might want that falls within the content rules. An excellent member will also get involved in the community, they will often use the IRC / shoutbox and forum where they'll become well known amongst other active members and staff, they'll also often help other members with queries Etc. A good member cares about the site, they will get involved where-ever they can, make suggestions and will also often report anything they see wrong to the staff to help out too. These members are what makes a private tracker community and I only wish every private tracker owner / senior staffer would also see this and fully appreciate them.  Update: To answer the other question, well good stats / ratio proof is still often used to get into other sites where there's invite threads Etc, but if you became a well known and respected member of a private tracker as I've described you will also make friends and this may well open up avenues into other private trackers too, sometimes you could be offered invites for instance without even asking or expecting it as you will have earned people's trust, this doesn't just happen over night however."

The error ""access denied, leeching forbidden"" is from the tracker so leeching is forbidding by the tracker not by you. It could be for any reason which I do not know because you didn't mention what tracker, what's your ratio there .. etc.  Now as for the client, it doesn't check the data, because you say so and because the fact that the error is for forbidding LEECHING so the data is not there. At this point, I'd really suggest confirming that you pointing the right data to the right location with same name, hash .. etc"

trackers,3a6sdy,Narhen,6,Wed Jun 17 17:55:17 2015 UTC,"Every private tracker has it's own ""economy"" of sorts, along with ratio rules for what amount you need to share back.  Some trackers are considered easy to seed on, and others are more difficult. On some private trackers, you can add a new torrent and seed back many more than 1 copy in 24 hours. On other trackers, you may only get very little uploaded in that time, due to several different factors. It all depends on the tracker you are on, you will learn which are easy and which are hard to seed on with practice. And you can learn which torrents to hop on early to get good upload too.   And then there are also ratioless trackers (BTN is a good example) that have different requirements : seed time. In this case you are required to seed your torrents for a total amount of hours before you may stop or remove them from seeding. The seed times vary for different trackers.  Basically, read read read when you join a tracker and take your time - you'll learn what the requirements for seeding are and how to meet and exceed them.  Some offer bonus points and other ways of rewarding people who have slower connections but constantly seed torrents to keep them alive and kicking.  As far as torrent clients go, I really like uTorrent 2.2.1 - you might want to give that a try before anything else, it is much better than recent uTorrent versions.  There are also clients like rTorrent and Deluge, you may need slightly more experience to configure those, but they are excellent choices if you are looking for something a little more rich in features and plugins. They also handle at least several thousand torrents very well, in my experience.  Good luck!"

Well there are many and I like them in that order     Deluge Transmission-Qt >> Special version for windows, I'm not sure if it's allowed on any private tracker, you have to check before using it. qBittorrent     Seeding is keeping the torrent active on your client after it completes, in that way, your client makes the torrent's data available for others after your client finished of having them.  Ratio, is your upload amount / your download amount so if you downloaded 5 GB and uploaded 10 GB then your ratio is 2 which equals 10/5. How to find these amounts, well, on your client of course, whatever you use.

Gaming servers usually take up totally negligible amounts of bandwidth, even with a lot of users. Even something like a web server hosting downloads won't have that much traffic as long as only a few people are using it. Torrents on the other hand will pretty much run with all the bandwidth you give them all the time, so they're pretty easy to identify.  Even encrypted on a VPN, if the network admins care then it won't be hard to figure out what's going on. Constantly downloading/uploading at 20MB/s from a server that is owned by a VPN hosting company is going to get you busted. Even if they can't prove you're torrenting and you have the excuse of ""oh, just a backup program"", they can still probably tell you to cut that shit out and stop eating all of the bandwidth.

trackers,3a5su2,ellisgeek,2,Wed Jun 17 15:23:56 2015 UTC,I have a cheap seedbox however I only have 100GB. The people I'm rooming with also use private trackers but if we had the option to expand as we need it rather than say pay ($25 a month) for 400GB of space we aren't going to use for quite a while. I would want to just get a 1TB hard drive for $80 and split that between the room and just torrent thought the RPi. If I need to throttle the Pi during the day I will (something like 10 MB/s possibly). It's just so that I'm saving some money and having the option to expand as needed.

trackers,3a5su2,grebfar,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"You can, actually, but it takes some tweaking. You have to have it set up so that the server does not route all of its traffic through the VPN. You then set the torrent client to bind all of its traffic to the VPN network interface but listen for the WebUI on the local network. So actual Torrent traffic will go over the VPN, but control traffic to the WebUI or RPC will go over the local network, which you can then set up port forwarding on your own to make accessible. This can get awfully complicated if you don't know a lot about networking, but it is doable.  You can also do it with a reverse-proxy bound to the local network that forwards to the WebUI on the VPN, which might be simpler."

trackers,3a26ze,digitalfence,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:02:04 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what the speeds are from VPN services. As far as the client on your end is concerned, your limitation is that VPNs are generally a single-threaded, high CPU utilizing process and you will only get as much bandwidth as one core of your CPU can encrypt.  I've been able to push approx 200Mbps through an OpenVPN connection on my laptop when I messed with the encryption settings a bit. But that was where it topped out for me, and generally where it tops out for most people that don't have giant Xeon servers as their VPN gateway."
trackers,3a26ze,SLVRRR,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:44:59 2015 UTC,"A few things to think about;  usually you can torrent but cannot browse with a VPN, thus you have to do something to separate them, either at the routing end,  application interface settings (if available,) with really cludgy utilities or with a VM.    If you go the routing route, the cap is going to be your routers processor.  Often the best case is an ARM SOC.  OpenVPN is still single threaded (for the current time,) so even if you have a multi-core consumer router, you're still really limited.  I have pfsense, and built my own specifically for a VPN.  I get 96Mbit/sec on a single core of a (Jetaway JBC311W93 with pfsense) Intel Mobile Celeron N2930.  If I could run multiple logins with my VPN provider, I could easily fill the the pipe, a couple of times over  Encryption, even pretty bog standard encryption is very very CPU bound, and I wouldn't want it using a core personally, or messing around with an unnecessary VM"

It is particularly poor for P2P compared to AirVPN. And frankly so are the other well-known VPN services.  Using the VPN for stuff besides torrents can be a real pain. Particularly since (as someone else mentioned here) most private tracker sites do not allow you to browse their web sites using the VPN. There is a guide named ""Traffic Splitting: Guide to Setting Up VPN ONLY for Torrenting on Windows"" in the ""How-To"" section of the forum at AirVPN that may be helpful."

Install openVPN and you're good to go.  Most people here will suggest you to go with the usual VPN providers. The problem is you get thrown onto a VPS with hundreds if not thousands of other users. Why not just rent the VPS by yourself and share with no one?"
trackers,3a26ze,SLVRRR,2,Tue Jun 16 18:07:19 2015 UTC,Because from a discovery perspective you're the only one on the VPS and the VPS provider can hand over your details as the renter of that system?

Good marketing, I guess.  Usually what happens is that a VPS/Dedi provider will just terminate your service or - more likely - ask you to switch to another provider if your DMCA letters flood their inbox.

Not having precedent does not mean it's not likely to occur at some stage. If / when the IP based canoes become savvy enough to identify the same swarm participants as providing copies of multiple works from the same IP clients, VPS or seed boxes could be targeted to take out high profile targets for large sums.

But that has nothing to do with the security provided by providers based in other countries.  If we're talking about larger rewards, busting a service like PIA would be way more rewarding than going after the small VPS host, which happens to possibly provide services to 50 filesharers total, don't you think?

You are as equally exposed as running through your ISP if a copyright troll decides to squeeze the VPS provider through a discovery process.   Also, depending on the country in question, your ISP laws may be worded to cover service providers, meaning it could be extended to local VPS providers.   Should you be one of these people hosting thousands of torrents on a VPS, you're equally as exposed if the landscape shifts even a little. Any other service that separates user activity from user details is going to be better in the face of requests for information or a legal challenge.

This should be very interesting, you wrote that once before, I just assumed you had no idea what you are talking about, but now I'm curious. I would go ahead and tell you why this is wrong, but I don't want you to pull that ""I never said that""-bullshit again, so go ahead and explain to me why you made that statement and why you think it's true.  As for the other stuff you wrote, they are true, however they are not relevant at all here. Again I'm not sure why you bring up random stuff that has nothing to do with what we are discussing here."

At this point it's very clear that neither of us is gonna back down.  OP asked a question and I answered, I think he deserves a better service, but there will always be people who are willing to pay more for less(speed, security, flexibility), and that is absolutely fine.  I just hope that people soon realize that all that is needed is a slight landscape shift and users of bigger VPN services will be the first to be exposed. It happens will all services every few years, you can't be that surprised anymore.  Since I won't be replying anymore, I want to address my last quote myself, look up NAT IPs. Some providers even offer switchable NAT IPs, no one would be able to identify you through discovery. You don't even show up often enough for them to connect any dots.  Anyways, have a nice day!"
trackers,3a5e0i,felixdakhat,16,Wed Jun 17 10:44:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't describe how to do it to a 10 year old. They have better things to do with their time.  The differences you are describing are usually only come up when different sources are used (different blurays etc). When it comes down to colour levels this is pretty subjective. However the level of detail in different sources is easier to judge. Take a look at facial features / hairlines and skin and you should be able to see the difference. If a group has fucked the colours in encoding from the source (without explaining why) then that is just a fuck up.  Most screenshot comparisons though are to illustrate the levels of blocking, banding, halos and grain shift when compared to the source and other encodes. Good encodes will minimise these at the lowest possible bitrate while maintaining detail. Scene encodes will usually have pretty evident artefacts of these kinds which shouldn't be obvious in a good p2p encode.   The level of grainshift will generally be obvious everywhere when you flick between screens. Detail loss is often very evident in hairlines and facial features. Things like banding/blocking and halos are generally most pronounced in dark scenes or high contrast scenes. Look these artefacts up if you don't know what each of them is. You have probably noticed them in the past though.    A lot of the time the difference between good p2p encodes is just that the grain shift is less at a lower bitrate for one of the encodes. This is a pretty minimal difference especially as the grain is often pretty arbitrary in the source anyway (there just isn't the level of detail in the source for the transfer).  A higher bitrate is never an indication of a better encode on its own. If the picture quality isn't better than that is just a waste of space."
trackers,3a5e0i,glomph,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:20:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation, particularly on the screenshot-related issues."
trackers,3a5e0i,DarkEnlighten,2,Wed Jun 17 16:36:06 2015 UTC,"someone pointed out that PXHD, for example, has 4gb-8gb 1080p encodes (h.264/mp4). Do you think they might be better in terms of quality compared to 20gb 1080p encodes?   In nearly all scenarios no, unless they've majorly screwed around with the encoding.  Now onto why bitrate is important as a marker of quality. With current algorithms for x264 (even x265) there is only so much compression that can be done without a degradation in what you see visually. Having a higher bitrate gives you more data to work with to more accurately produce the image of the source material.   As far as quality goes - having had access to AHD's internals - they tend to be visually transparent (or very close) at about 50% of the original source size. Sometimes more, sometimes less depending on the film (whether it has loads of action scenes or is primarily static), grain and the transfer itself. This means for 1080p it tends to go from 12GB-20GB in size.  As to PxHD, you'll notice that they aren't always faithful to original colours and tend to have banding issues. Just to give you an example I'll give you a comparison between an AHD 1080p internal and a PxHD 1080p internal:  John.Wick.2014.1080p.BluRay.DTS.x264.D-Z0N3 (14.8GB)  John.Wick.2014.1080p.BluRay.x264.AC3-PxHD (4GB)  If you look, you'll notice the colour palette is different on the PxHD, and there is noticeable banding on the right hand wall and left hand painting reflections.  Where PxHD shines is when you have bandwidth caps or a slow connection. I have to admit you do get a lot of bang-for-your-buck metaphorically in terms of PQ for the size - but they are definitely not transparent.  Bottom line: If you have the time and data to spare - going for well known internal groups from HDB & AHD will tend to net you encodes that are visually very close to a remux (at about half the size). They are worth archiving if you want to. Scene tends not to be as good - simply due to the fact that they optimize for speed which tends to reduce quality.   As to choosing between internal groups - if they're top tier ones (i.e. HDB and AHD) then in all likelihood there'll be a very (if at all) marginal difference. The only thing to note is sometimes is they might use different sources (ie. different countries or different releases) so look into that. If it's all the same - honestly, go with whichever is the smallest."
trackers,3a5e0i,Arguti,0,Thu Jun 18 00:34:19 2015 UTC,"I can understand people's OCD for perfect encodes but really, if you can barely notice the difference comparing screenshots why bother?

Also, you can't see frame problems and other things from a screenshot."

trackers,3a5e0i,tyrrannothesaurusrex,-4,Wed Jun 17 16:38:59 2015 UTC,"Filesize/bitrate by itself is not a guarantee of quality. Optimizing transcoding methods, including longer encodes will result in smaller files for a given perceived quality, but not all encoders do this to the same degree.  In my experience, the smallest file of the highest resolution, ie 1080p, will give you the most bang for your buck. Keep in mind even huge bloated 20GB encodes are still lossy re-encodes from a lossy source. It is not analogous to a lossless audio track for archiving. Unless you can see the quality degraded during playback, stick with the smallest release.  edit: please downvote this if you love your bloated 1080p transcodes."

These can normally be earned by seeding even if there are no leecher earning you upload credit in the traditional way. Exactly how they work can vary depending on the private tracker, but bonus points are usually exchangeable for upload credit and sometimes other perks. A few private trackers will even give you upload credit for idling on their IRC chat.  A common way of earning a lot of upload credit fast is to fill requests on private trackers that have request bounties, but even just uploading any acceptable content can help greatly towards your stats. As a new member you are unlikely to be-able to compete by uploading brand new content that's just been pre'd as you probably won't be fast enough, but you might be-able to find some older and more obscure content that you could upload at your leisure that many members would still enjoy."

trackers,39z5j8,Vita_non_Victus,0,Mon Jun 15 23:48:46 2015 UTC,"First, you're correct, Lastpass has some advantages over Keepass but I think you're missing the point regarding the advantages of Keepass.  Closed Source: The issue of closed vs open source is transparency. With open source anyone can validate the code, look for vulnerabilities and backdoors. With closed source you just have to trust the vendor. In a security program, especially one holding all my passwords, that openness is a big point in favor of open source. For my word processor, not so much.  Cloud-based: Using remote servers to store the data has it's advantages. I prefer to keep control of my data by storing it locally, with local backup. ""LastPass is one of the biggest targets on the internet"" and that's the point. My local PC is not on anyone's radar, security through obscurity.  This is a balance between security and convenience. As with most things, the more convenient it is the less secure it is.   I have never had a known breach   Yes you did, just now  :)  Kidding aside, no site has been hacked, until it has. Everyone's PC runs fine, until it doesn't. Something not happening yet is not a gauge of the likelihood of it happening in the future."
trackers,39z5j8,312c,3,Mon Jun 15 23:51:54 2015 UTC,"You are right.  I still have never had a known breach, somebody managed to get a heavily encrypted copy of my master password and possibly passwords. That is only half of what is required to access my accounts (Yubikey) and by the time anyone could possibly figure out what my master password is it won't work because I have changed it anyway.  As for KeePass, this isn't an issue with KeePass itself and more of a user problem but I see people store their password vaults on Dropbox (and similar platforms), which in my opinion is worse than how LastPass stores our password vaults.  With the closed source stuff, I know you're not an idiot (I assume you're a desktop techy for your occupation). Do you avoid closed source systems for everything you do? I use VMware (closed-source) over Xen (open-source) because it is a better product. I am confident in their ability to keep on top of vulnerabilities so I don't need to audit their source code (and nor would I have time for it). Just because KeePass is open doesn't mean it is safer. Do you personally sift through the source code to see if you can spot any vulnerabilities? Would you even know how to spot a vulnerability? I'm sure as shit that I wouldn't and I have at least some basic programming knowledge. I've never seen any publications  in regard to an audit of KeePass unlike TrueCrypt 7.1a (https://opencryptoaudit.org/)."

Mux is short for multiplex, which can be thought of as a joining of several usually synchronised tracks - audio or video - along a timeline.  A simple example would be a stereo recording, which is just 2 separate audio tracks intended to be enjoyed together.    A multiplex stream can be demuxed, that is the separate streams can be extracted, and subsequently recombined - remuxed - discarding any that are not required.  A blu-ray source may include multiple foreign language soundtracks, commentary tracks, and subtitle tracks which are not required by most, as well as separate extras.

The most common problems with remuxes will be missing subtitles, because most sites have shitty quality control for subs.

Remuxing takes nowhere near the skill and time that encoding does and is rather easy in comparison. Unfortunately there's still a vast majority out there that manage to fuck it up. Looking at you HDAccess."
trackers,39yqig,Dozerplex,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:32:03 2015 UTC,HDA? Care to explain more how would a shitty/screwed remux look like?
trackers,39yqig,Dozerplex,2,Tue Jun 16 07:29:05 2015 UTC,"Aside from not including all subtitles and commentaries from the best source, they include dupe audio. Lossless and lossy. They include tracks they claim to be commentary when its just a lossy audio track. They don't include forced subtitles. They improperly label forced and default subtitle tracks.   The list goes on. They're fucking useless. Its not hard to fuck up a remux but they seem to do a magnificent job of it.  They're all about speed and they do a good job at being the fastest, but if they took an extra 2 minutes when remuxing they could do the job properly."
trackers,39yqig,akanosora,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:05:28 2015 UTC,Their encodes are quite good though. Not sure about the remux.
trackers,39yqig,SAKUJ0,-1,Tue Jun 16 12:34:30 2015 UTC,"They make a compromise between speed and quality, so people consistently have access to better-than-scene quality content, while they wait a few days or weeks for the goodies to come. There are other groups, like WiKi, that focus on the same thing. Afaik legion, phd etc. go towards the similar direction but that is half-knowledge now.  Check the file-size. When RARBG calls their releases ""Remux"" they are really small. And they call their 720p releases also ""Remux"". Internal groups can call stuff whatever they like. For the big and good groups, a remux is practically a remux. AHD describes remux as the ""créme de la créme"" - and that might even apply for RARBG (relatively speaking).  Maybe I get something wrong, here.  I really like HDA. Their whole site is revolved around content you throw in before the good stuff is out, so your family can finally shut up (and frankly, with some movies I do not really care about quality, but it is rare that I watch them to begin with)."

Within 15 minutes of it appearing on tracker my rss feed will pick it up place it in the folder specified and run the program in the background to automatically extract so that PleX can pick it up.

trackers,39utxh,SAKUJ0,2,Mon Jun 15 21:18:13 2015 UTC,"You are asked for ratio proofs in recruitment or sanctioned invite threads. They state explicit requirements. If you meet them (sometimes they can be quite steep), your ratio and stats is completely irrelevant.   Case 1 Official recruitment   There is a list of 1-5 requirements usually. They speak for themselves. Recruiters just go through the list. Read the requirements (they are usually very objective) and ask a question if things seem subjective (unless they tell you not to do so).  Most recruitments are actually quite forward as you earned the recruitment.   Case 2 Class restricted invite threads that are sanctioned   If I ask you for links to your profiles then I want to gain trust. I want to get a picture of you (with lower paranoia). I want to make as sure as I can that you are the person that you say you are and tell truth about the rest.  I would require you to meet other requirements, as well. Usually, that step is really easy. Not having any warnings and being of appropriate user class on the current tracker is enough.  If somebody offers you an invite, he has no hidden agenda. He wants nothing in return. He just wants to make sure he will not get in trouble for making a leap of faith. He is really not all that worried about your future stats as long as you keep by the rules. Since he does things right and has good requirements on class restricted forums, 9/10 invites of his are likely very active and contribute a lot to his trackers, making it a better place. He can live with 1/10 people losing interest / becoming inactive."

If you have warnings / are below the minimum required ratio your ratio is ""not good"" as in ""bad"" and not as in ""could be better"".  2 GB can be both ""good"" as in ""not bad"" or ""not against the rules"". Alternatively, it can be considered ""bad"", as with 2 GB it shows you have not used the tracker at all, yet.

trackers,39utxh,plunkt,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:59:51 2015 UTC,"It varies depending on the private tracker, but most people consider anything above 1.0 as a fairly good ratio if you've downloaded a reasonable amount and a minimum of a 1.0 ratio is a good standard rule if you're thinking of submitting any ratio proof. Many trackers will have a lower ratio requirement for an account in good standing, but a 1.0 ratio is usually the highest minimum requirement demanded in the rules of a private tracker. You will however often need higher than a 1.0 ratio to optionally progress to higher classes on many private trackers.  Regarding total transfer, how this is used also depends on the private tracker, many will only enforce a ratio requirement after you've downloaded a certain amount and some will enforce ratio in increasing steps, E.g. there's no ratio requirement if you've downloaded less than 10GB, a 0.4 ratio requirement after downloading from 10GB-25GB, a 0.6 ratio requirement from 25GB to 50GB and a 0.8 ratio requirement after downloading 50GB. Some will take into the account the amount transferred or sometimes downloaded or uploaded as part of a requirement for progressing to higher classes and some will even have achievements with some based around the amount transferred / uploaded / downloaded."
trackers,39utxh,shillyshally,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:58:03 2015 UTC,"1.10 is the perfect ratio (technically 1.05, but be over it a bit).  Try to keep as much buffer over 1.05 that would allow you to replace everything at once if you lost all your HDs. Backup your .torrents  This only applies for you if you wish to remove .torrents as quickly as possible (HnR time or required ratio met).  A better way is just to ignore the concept of ratio entirely and to seed everything indefinitely. Of course, sometimes this is not feasible or might require help of Usenet. It would also be a stupid idea on trackers like HDA - they serve content that you are likely to replace when better versions come available.  But that is how I fair right now. Keep seeding forever and only remove things to trump them. That way, you cannot possibly keep your ratio so low, but it would not matter. Shoot for the 100s.  If you were absolutely selfish, you would try to generate a buffer of 1-2 TB and then ignore the concept of ratio altogether. Most trackers want less selfish people, though."

Some of us are uploaders so it's natural we'll have high ratio. So don't worry about it.

trackers,39xj3z,312c,5,Mon Jun 15 18:17:52 2015 UTC,"Well. the way I see it, people will only use the client to seed, which will result in them earning almost nothing. You can use any other client to download files for free, so why would anyone choose to pay for it?"
trackers,39xj3z,Amosqu,-10,Mon Jun 15 18:25:35 2015 UTC,"You would only choose to pay if you actually got a better quality service.  Consider your example of everyone seeding for payment on lots of content (and earning almost nothing as you say), well then that means that IF you pay, you well get all these peers servicing you, while you wouldnt if you didnt pay, because a lot of people wont just seed without a benefit (e.g. maintaining ratio).  I think that is the best I can explain it I am afraid."
trackers,39xj3z,neobenedict,7,Mon Jun 15 18:34:15 2015 UTC,And how would this prevent fake seeding?  Something which the bittorrent protocol has no way of dealing with at all.
trackers,39xj3z,Martychann,-7,Mon Jun 15 18:36:14 2015 UTC,"By that do you mean people send garbage instead of the real content?  If so, then the protocol does actually protect against that already, BitTorrent really wouldnt work otherwise, as people could game the tit-for-tat policy. The way that is done is that each piece has a unique hash which is found in the torrent file, which the downloader already has at the begining (or magnet link, doesnt matter). When a seeder sends a piece, the leecher computes a hash digest of this piece, and compares it to the hash in the torrent file. The cryptographic security properties of the hash function means that you cannot effectively generate false data with the same hash. This is something which has been in BitTorrent since the beginning."
trackers,39xj3z,jakesaccount,5,Mon Jun 15 18:40:00 2015 UTC,"No, a client can report it is a seeder, but not actually have the content.  They would be paid for making it available, then never actually transmit anything."
trackers,39xj3z,tmstms,-10,Mon Jun 15 18:41:55 2015 UTC,"That is not possible, it is a tit for tat protocol, so a seeder sends a piece, then the leecher makes a corresponding payment is made for only that piece (a typical torrent has hundreds or thousands of pieces), if no payment is made, then the seeder obviously doesnt transmit the next piece. This is basically how tit-for-tat already works, except you send pieces both ways, no payments."

If certain movies do not require decent quality and are required to be available in Turkish, Welsh and Papa-Guinean, then chances are that the scene release is the most likely to have them.  In either way, there are lots of groups like HDAccess or WiKi that try to get out releases sooner than 2 weeks after the sources come available. They should be preferred over scene releases every time."

trackers,39pd6c,BeardedBlaze,5,Sat Jun 13 15:33:24 2015 UTC,"Just a couple notes: there are websites out there that will sell you invites to various trackers.  Do not ever buy or trade for an invite.  When you're discovered, you'll lose your account on the tracker in question, and any other account you make with them will also be perma-banned once discovered.  You may also be perma-banned on other trackers as well.  Secondly, you mentioned always seeding back to 1:1 on public trackers.  You should be aware that, unless you're grabbing a newly-uploaded torrent, seeding back on private trackers will take a lot longer - think weeks and months instead of hours or days.  So when you join a site, don't immediately start downloading all the old rare material that you've been lusting after for years: you'll just end up in a ratio hole, desperately hoping someone will download that old torrent from you so that you can grab something else.  Instead, bookmark any older torrents that you want, and focus on new or freeleech torrents.  As you gain excess ratio (buffer), use that to grab the older material you want.  It's slow getting started on most private sites, but just leave everything seeding for as long as possible and you'll be fine."

trackers,39pxyf,redditforgold,3,Sun Jun 14 07:36:11 2015 UTC,"Just listen to /u/markthegraves Usually:  2gb-720p is for iPod/iPhone/Android users  4gb-1080p FAT32 users  8gb-1080p Those who wants an ""extended"" quality  I'm too suspect to talk about PixelHD. I heart P.HD... I'm probably the peasant user who have the most seeding torrents there. 730 torrents atm. (They actually doesn't show that stat for me. I'm using the total bonus points stat to predict that.) If you want a comparison, here it's Hellboy 2, from one of the latest torrents I downloaded:  7.5Gb HDB 720p internal vs 1.8 Gb P.HD 720p Mobie:  http://someimage.com/compare/zxWmpDM/RnaynmW  (I cropped because P.HD preserved it 1280x720. Missed a black line at the bottom but the PQ was not altered. As you can see, the artifact problem is bare minimum, some colors differ, and the blur due to encoding on the Mobie is actually good -- Check the edges at the internal)  Due to the resources (one 24"" monitor, 32"" TV) I have at my home, downloading between a 1080p and 720p doesn't make any difference.  I even learned all the mp4 thing and I usually encode some of the torrents myself. Tagging mp4s is art. Too bad only approved uploaders can upload @P.HD  http://i.imgur.com/jVcUBGW.jpg  But that's another story.  EDIT: I still have some big encodes and even Full Blurays. (seeding 1,255 torrents @ PTP, for example)   But I think P.HD is great, specially for the casual movie watcher. I can confirm that the banding on bigger screens is high, so I never watch P.HD on my parent's TV (50"")  EDIT2: About the releases appearing elsewhere... They doesn't appear only because they doesn't fit in mostly private trackers rules, not because they are bad in quality. P.HD is just an specialized tracker. One in their own, I think."

They contradict all of their own ""rules"" in every expletive-laden post.   They wonder why the forums are dead. It's because we all tried to give you constructive criticism and you shut us all down.  I was suckered in to donating for them previously, I believed them and wanted to support them. But no more. They've cried wolf so many times and treated their own members with such lies and disrespect that enough is enough.  How can they threaten to go out of business IN THE SAME post as offering insane amounts of ratio??? WHY WOULD ANYONE DONATE???  Their post the other week ""WHO LOVES BITSOUP"" was so transparent that it made me laugh out loud.  Then they make posts saying ""No more begging"" but the ENTIRE POST IS A BEG!!!!  They run a promo saying ""THIS IS THE LAST BIG RATIO PROMO SO GET IT NOW!"" and then they start one the following day for EVEN BIGGER RATIOS.  Get your house in order if you want to earn back the trust of your members. Then you'll see a realistic number of donations coming without all the begging and threats.

With nothing but popular scene releases arriving late, and no releases from any decent p2p groups being uploaded. Not that quality rips ever really do get uploaded there. And retention of seeders is way down with lots of dead torrents  Basically you have to be a VIP donator to upload, so the owner shot himself in the foot there. Why would you upload after just being given a bazillon gigs of upload credit for donating?

trackers,39jy5t,Demos423,7,Fri Jun 12 07:44:10 2015 UTC,"As a 7 year veteran on bitsoup, I've watched an awesome community turn to shit.. There used to be actual discussion in the comment section and people were eager to offer honest feedback and if someone needed help it was offered in ample amounts. Over time (probably due to censorship and threats from mods) the site has turned into a bunch of robots saying ""thank you"". Personally, I stopped commenting after they made uploaders ""anonymous"" and took away uploading rights for 98% of their userbase.  These were the first steps they took at becoming a ""paysite"". They essentially put a choke hold on the principal of torrenting by taking away our voice. Some people chose to upload content (which is the life blood of any torrent site) and some people contributed by seeding a good ratio. Now they have a couple of ""robots"" with seedboxes controlling all of the site content, which means seeding doesn't even matter as much as it used to. The only choice we have now is to donate and its bullshit! I used to be proud of that place and felt like my contributions meant something and I got a good feeling knowing I was part of something positive.  All of these changes have been orchestrated by a greedy sysop that thinks he's smarter than all of us. These changes have left us with stale content, a bitter community, and its personally left me with a bad taste in my mouth.. Changing the site rules to accomodate their new paysite model will and has already blown up in their face. I just hope when the dust settles that the owner will wake the fuck up and realize that no matter how hard he wants this to work, it never ever will, theres far too many other places to go.. Plain and simple."

An incredible number of rules, and even bullshit catch all rules like when I got banned for violating ""a mods express wishes"". Yes, that was a written rule.  I like bitsoup, but I wish I could find a better place. I tried Torrent Leech, which I thought was a higher level tracker, but the selection isn't great and the search engine is fucking awful.

To me it seems seeding doesn't matter at all. In comparison to other sites, the content is very low except for the popular tv series - as you stated, probably controlled by the site robots.   That's why they'd like to become a ""pay for (illegal) download"" site if they could, they just fear ""legal issues"" as their main pet mod stated in the forum which means the police kicking their front door in.

Their latest daily broadcast is titled ""Summer Shutdown required?"" and explains on how you urgently need to donate so they don't shut down, but can rely on them staying open (or otherwise users wouldn't commit to paying $$$ for credits they cannot use anymore).  Interesting though how they deny wanting to become a pay site to get the heat of their asses, even though they previously made clear in their forum that they'd like to have mandatory ""donations"" of ~10$ a user a month and only ""legal issues"" prevent them:  Of course, for security reasons, they cannot tell us how large their costs are and how much profit they make by scaring people into paying them or else. Remember the owner runs multiple sites, and making money from all of them.  --  We all know what Bitsoup stands for. We all know there are costs to be on-line. We all know when we come to bitsoup 90% of what we seek we find.  Day in day out one thing is for sure. What is so sure you ask??  Simply put each day when a member wakes up for the day Bitsoup is there waiting.  As each member goes to sleep Bitsoup is there waiting.  We're always here when you need us, but this is beginning to be a one-sided story.  We all know some say who cares if bitsoup closes. We all know many say they love bitsoup.  Many of you have spoken as to how much you love Bitsoup and what it has to offer. For that, We would like to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  We have been asked to not beg. We have been asked to not offer insane credit.  Weird thing is we have not been asked to stay on-line. Don't care if we stay alive that's ok too.  End of day Bitsoup needs donations. We hear this all the time.  If you think Bitsoup is a dime a dozen tracker have a look around. There are many old sites like us that are nowhere to be found. But yet very few sites like us are still around.  There are new sites that come and go but not many can say they going on 12yrs old.  With the epic lose of funding in April/May that has yet to be recovered. We thought that the community would rally and get us back on track. We have listened and stopped begging. All this has done is dry up what little we have to fund.  These actions have caused us to be in the worst funding drought in Bitsoup History.  this is not about begging or desire for money. All we are seeking is the lost funding from April/May. Due to summer is here things will only get worse unless we can shore up some funds to cover bills during slow season.  We are there again today. Costs have gone up yet funding has gone down.  If you want to see us survive donate. We need donations every day.  Bitsoup time is now. Funding is a never ending story. You ask us to stop begging why beg if not need to  Bitsoup is a true dinosaur that just wont die. If you care. Consider our current promo. *Or just send a donation and want nothing more than knowing you help bitsoup stay alive. Some have fear that if a donation is made site might still disappear. I can assure you Bitsoup will always be here in some form. While we rather it be online for all to enjoy rest assured we will always be there for those who support is in many ways including *donations.  We hope we have earned your respect and trust with the changes we have made so far, and with more to come we can only get better and more secure. And though there are some who say we are always begging for funds (and rightfully so unfortunately) the site has liabilities that have to be covered every month or we wont exist one day. Our members have always supported us and we hope you will consider to continue to to so.  Some have been spreading bullshit about us becoming a pay site. I will make it clear that this option will never happen. No one will ever be forced to spend money to be on bitsoup. We rather people want to support bitsoup.

That's because that site only costs them a few hundred dollars at most to run a month. Not to mention they do have more than 1 site on the same server and with them puling in thousands of dollars, they don't want to know how many thousands they make on a monthly basis and take the chance in losing that profit as the members wouldn't donate as much as they do now if they knew the real costs of what it takes to run that site."
trackers,39jy5t,beg4funds,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:23:27 2015 UTC,"To keep you entertained: the site owner challenges you to step into his honey trap and get banned! If you join the irc channel and voice your concerns, that means you didn't learn from the recent ""honest and open"" discussions in the forum which resulted in the threads being deleted and members warned or banned :-)  So here it is for all you to read, those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear! Even if you aren't a bitsoup member don't you feel pity for the poor site owner, having to write a begging broadcast every day to keep his profits up?   Remember: If you pay the ransom, the threats will disappear and no ""reboot"" with ratios reset will be required. But of course the site is near closing anyway every day ... oh no, wait, it isn't, bitsoup will be always there for the members who call it home or no one would buy huge credits :-p  --  For many people, Bitsoup is a place to call home. For myself and the staff Bitsoup is our lives. The first year of Bitsoup was insane. We made enough donations in a month to cover the entire year. This allowed us to expand into what we are today; a large torrent community who has survived the test of time. And we are still here nearly 12 years later.  I'm afraid to admit that over the past few years or so the impact from the damage done in October of 2012 is still showing its ugly head today. I have been accused of being a scam artist, a liar, and far worse. My personal life has been aired out by haters and the stress alone has been very impacting. To be honest, I am getting a little tired of having to come on the site every day and attempt to make people understand that regardless how much content you may enjoy from Bitsoup it comes at a cost.  I'd love to offer all the great services to every Bitsoup member, yet we have had to keep some great services as a reward for our donating members who become VIP or PCVIP. If more members would support our cause and community, we could offer all the great options Bitsoup has to offer to everyone and be a real all-for-one community.  The books of pages that I have to make to get people understand and support what they use could end and give me more time in working on Bitsoup features and making it better. We have been stuck in idle for far to long.  Sadly this isn't the case. People who are clueless run around saying things that damage Bitsoup. Some say we are scammers. Others say we are just money hungry. Support the cause. Site cost never go away. In fact they only increase with each passing year.  We're close to covering April but we still need to cover May/June A real treat would to be covered until Sept This would give us some badly needed breathing room to come up with new formats that more people will enjoy and ensure we are able to stay online and not have to broadcast these announcements every bloody day.  We spent quite a bit of time getting our own credit card system up and stable. Yet many dont trust it. So what else can we do? Just throw in the towel? Close down? People say I give empty threats. This isnt fact. Its more of at the last minute people do support what they use and we just barley cover what we need to stay online.  This format must change. Summer is here and things are far worse than before. You all know this. We see a little increase of donations after we send a broadcast but yet dies right after. Why do we have to work so hard for a donation when what you ask we provide.  Should we do a Bitsoup reboot?  I spoke about this reset all the ratio set on site? it has been nearly 12 years. Take bitsoup in a new direction. Yet again none of this needs to happen or should happen. The cost of a coffee a month is all we need from a large amount of members than what we collect now from the few who have to carry the site for everyone else.  So here is what I offer. Have a little trust in Bitsoup. Help us replace what was lost in April/May/June and and ensure enough support until Sept. I will guarantee no further threats, begging, or anything else but basic weekly promo announcements until our next Fundraising event which is Sept. That is what your donation ensures. #1 site is safe  I will follow these terms only if people step up to the challenge and help replace what was lost. We had such a good start to 2015 funding was stable we didn't have to beg but with Paypal locking us out we ran out of the funds we had for rainy day.  Sunday Night I will be in our chat room for a open town hall. Watch to bitch? Want to offer support come chat with me and as long as you keep it clean your voice will be heard.  So the choice is up to all of you the members.  20TB Summer SLAM: Donate $30 and receive 20TB Credit"

trackers,39jy5t,kaalki,2,Sat Jun 20 09:59:24 2015 UTC,"You know your on a pretty shitty site when the owner promises to stop threatening the membership if they send him money. I have torrented for 10 years and have never seen this kind of behavior at any other private tracker.  More disturbing is the blind following of staff, and most VIP members, to the type of site it now has fully become. Think 1930's Germany and the Hitler youth. Sieg Heil REXXZ! I mean, when the home page has links to guides on how to use your credit cards to donate, the forums are filled with nothing but pro donation threads, and the site looks, and basically functions the same as it did in 2005, you know the sharing ship is sinking. Pay to upload, pay for RSS. And for what? Crap dime a dozen scene releases that are all over the web. Hell, you cant even stop a torrent for 10 minutes in case it updates and you get a hit and run. When Site upgrades over 10 years primarily mean new icons and a donation payment system now totally controlled by the owner, you have to wonder what the monies go on. Seriously. There's a reason they got on the shit list with ISP's and lost their PAYPAL set up. Because they are a for profit, large scale operation."

trackers,39fzfb,pjcnet,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:38:44 2015 UTC,"Christopher Lee was a stunning and legendary English born actor and there's so many excellent movies he starred in of all types. One of my favourites is the original Wicker Man (1973) where he played alongside another amazing British actor, the late Edward Woodward who sadly passed away in 2009. After the dire remake of The Wicker Man starring Nicholas Cage was released in 2006 (this really was terrible and in my opinion an insult to the original classic) what was intended to be a sequel to The Wicker Man was produced called The Wicker Tree (2011), sadly however Christopher Lee only played a cameo role in the sequel however which I understand was due to his poor health. The Wicker Tree was 100 times better than The Wicker Man remake, but in my opinion it still didn't come close to the original classic which I must have watched around 25 times. Christopher Lee was also the last of the great Hammer horror movie stars where he was well known for playing Dracula.  RIP Sir Christopher Lee, 1922-2015."

trackers,39fx1j,SAKUJ0,7,Thu Jun 11 23:06:29 2015 UTC,"Aside from the trackers that those P2P groups (generally) are internal to, I'd say AHD and PTP.  AHD has their own internal groups but they do allow stuff from other trackers as well, and they allow coexisting so it isn't like PTP where only two 1080p and two 720p encodes are allowed for each movie (and their different editions/cuts). So that is a big plus factor, you get a lot of different encodes to choose from from different P2P groups. Then again the internals there release superb quality encodes so if you're on there you'll probably get their stuff anyway which are partial freeleech as well.  PTP on the other hand, well you'd get P2P releases super quick. Their users are really quick in uploading stuff. And the staff moderate the releases really strictly to ensure the best quality possible.  Other trackers worth mentioning are TehC and TSH as well. You can get P2P releases there fairly quickly. TehC is a movie tracker so TehC being the quickest compared to TSH.  Last but not least I'd just like to add that it'd be better to join a tracker with their own internal release group(s) if you'd want the fastest P2P releases, that really is a no-brainer.  AHD would probably be the best tracker for this, as their groups are one of the best and it really is easy to get into compared to other notable trackers such as HDBits, and BTN (for TV) with their own internal groups.  As for your more specific question regarding DON's GoT releases, they are internal to HDBits so they release over there and their releases get uploaded by other users to other trackers. I think for DON's encodes you can try MoreThanTV, ToTV, and TSH.  Unfortunately I don't really know the difference in upload time when it comes to comparing BHD to them. I'd think a TV tracker might get them faster, since BHD is more focused on movies? So maybe someone on MoreThanTV and ToTV can answer this for you.  BTN and HDBits would be the best tracker overall for the quickest TV content but they are also currently one of the hardest to get into, HDBits being the hardest. If you're new to trackers I'd suggest gaining more experience first before you look into joining those two trackers. Then maybe you can try BTN :p. Both trackers (BTN and HDB) have internal groups that release TV encodes on there. Though a group named NTb however is internal to both BTN and HDBits."

HD-Torrents - the best imo for movies and tv.  Bit-HDTV - for new p2p releases, this is one of the best. totally underrated though since they don't force anything to users and don't being assholes.  Frehson.TV - gets the don releases faster than any other and scene releases too.

Most universities forbid torrenting over the university's internet: it uses up a lot of bandwidth that they're paying for and it attracts lots of MPAA/RIAA notices.  (Yes, I know you use private trackers, but the rules were put in places due mostly to public tracker users and universities generally won't distinguish between the two.)  Penalties for torrenting on campus range from an informal warning through disciplinary action through expulsion.

It would have resumed a while ago were it not for the actions of a certain someone.  For a while when we were hovering around our 35k user limit, existing members were able to use their invites when we were below 35k users (usually happened after nightly inactivity pruning).  And then someone decided it would be an awesome idea to hijack PTP users' accounts in order to steal peers and echo them to a public tracker established only to attack PTP.  That is when we closed invites altogether and began implementing significantly more strict account security requirements, some of which are still being rolled out.  When the security updates are all completed we will look at reopening invites, and much later resuming recruitment."

You are the one who brought up someone having ""access to"" passwords to try. I was simply asking you to explain where you think they are getting this ""access"". It seems that you are saying that it is coming from passwords on other trackers.

Betamax was a superior format to VHS, yet look who won out.  Availability trumps quality.  Also, it's not like MP3s are bad.  --v2 is transparent for 99% of listeners."
trackers,39dh4d,Stephonovich,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:11:52 2015 UTC,"MP3 is bad because it achieves transparency at much higher bitrates than other codecs, not because it's impossible to achieve transparency with it. If we were to not adopt new codecs before they achieved universal compatibility, then we would never adopt new codecs at all."
trackers,39dh4d,kotekzot,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:18:33 2015 UTC,"True, but I think the incredibly cheap storage makes it a non-starter.  No one cares that they could save a few MB on a song, and the massive amount of hardware dedicated to MP3 means it's not going away anytime soon.  That said, Apple is big enough that AAC and ALAC will also have support for the conceivable future."

You stop complaining   I just hit an elitist interview process   Would you rather us have no interview process at all?  We've passed at least 21k users in interviews (""at least"" because counts weren't accurately kept in the early days).  So none of those people would have accounts, nor would any of the users in any of their invite trees....we're talking probably close to 100k accounts, thanks to the interview system alone.   cassette tape approval forms   We do not have those.   the community's dogmatic and authority-worshipping attitude about these policies when it comes to discussing them   Most of these general policies like you're complaining about have been in place (albeit updated/amended) for more than 7.5 years.  You're not anywhere close to being the first person to complain about how the site is run, and you surely won't be the last.  So yes, it gets a bit old debating them time and time again with people new to private trackers that think they have it all figured out.  Yet, it's because of these policies and the professionalism with which the site is run, that we're still around after nearly 8 years and are stronger now than ever before.  By all objective measures (and most/all subjective measures), What.CD is better than every other tracker in existence, and that will never change.  Not to mention, we have done more to benefit the torrenting community as a whole than anyone else, as well.  TL;DR: You're complaining about everything that makes What.CD such an amazing place.

I came for an enthusiastic community of music fans on an organized and takedown-free site and I just hit an elitist interview process followed by things like cassette tape approval forms and... well, meanies.

You, the community, have been as active as ever and during this time, you've helped upload 45,000 new torrents, made nearly 200,000 forum posts and spammed an incalculable number of messages in our many active IRC channels. We hit a huge milestone in March this year when we reached 100,000 torrent uploads (twice...) and that means we've now got over 180TBs worth of data being distributed on the tracker spread across 5 million files. We have our invaluable uploaders to thank for these impressive stats and we sincerely appreciate all the hard work you've put into helping the site.   In the past twelve months, we've seen the addition to our staff team of REDACTED as a Moderator and the expansion of our Developer team with REDACTED and REDACTED. Along with these past additions, we'd like to take this opportunity to welcome REDACTED to our dev team! Many of you will have seen him running IDC and assisting with Games, so be sure to give him a warm welcome to our staff team and we're looking forward to what else he can add to the site. We've also seen our community staff team growing with our new App Reviewer class who have processed almost 3,000 applications in the past two months and some reshuffling of our Forum Staff team to assist in forum moderation. Thanks as always to these dedicated users for going above and beyond what's expected of them.  We've had a couple of successful contests too, most recently with our AnimeBytes Top 50 Anime Collage #4 and we're happy to finally be able to announce the results~ This year's collage was incredibly successful with five times as many people participating as any previous year and over 7900 votes in total. With more voters came a lot more variation in the results and there were 802 distinct anime voted for (probably; the votes haven't been as thoroughly checked for duplicates as in the past due to the sheer quantity of them) with first place getting over six times as many votes as last year's first place. In the past, as few as six votes were required to place in the top 50 but this time around the lowest ranked anime in the collage got 39. We have REDACTED, REDACTED and REDACTED to thank for helping count the results and so without further ado...  Here is AB's Fourth Top 50 Anime Collage and here are the complete results. Have fun seeing what's changed as well as checking out how your favourite shows fared!  Most recently - and perhaps our biggest change to the site in the past year - we've seen the testing of airing anime torrents. We're pleased to announce that this test run has helped us iron out some bugs and that a complete rollout is on track to be implemented in time for the next anime season so look forward to that!  The past few weeks have also seen the implementation of Delicious stylesheets as official stylesheets! Designed by REDACTED last year, these have been run as a community project up until now with the source code available on Github and significant contributions by REDACTED, REDACTED, REDACTED, REDACTED, REDACTED and REDACTED. Hundreds of users have previously used the externally-hosted ones but now it's possible to pick them in your profile settings. Here's a sneak peak for those interested in them:  Click the image for a full-sized preview  And to round off this celebration, we'll be having a week's worth of site-wide freeleech ending on the 15th!

This guy is doing god's work by telling you what quality of anime you should download (most of the most recent ones it will be 720p). Basically, HVFULL = 1080p, HV1280+ = over 720p but below 1080p, HV1280 = 720p.  Madoka Magica (TV series + 3rd movie), Code Geass (R1 + R2), Parasyte (TV quality) are all series I joined. TTGL is supposedly also a good show."

trackers,394yra,34895348573857348759,2,Tue Jun 9 12:22:36 2015 UTC,Use myanimelist to get the titles in Japanese and check the blogposts. It's a little tricky because sometimes there are multiple results which all look similar. This is when I check whether the date of the post matches the airing dates on MAL.  As an example here you can find that Nisekoi was originally made in HV1280 (720p).
trackers,394yra,adamkex,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:32:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the site, but as far as I could tell this would only apply for encodes which have TV as a source, or does it affect Blu Ray rips also?"
trackers,394yra,lilke,2,Tue Jun 9 12:35:49 2015 UTC,Blurays are 1080p however the source may not be. I've never put that much thought into it but as far as I know most animes aren't made in 1080p. Keep in mind that 1080p files are sometimes massive. I just replaced a 45gb torrent with a 15gb one. It would be interesting if someone else more knowledgeable could have some input.  Here's a thread on animebytes about quality https://animebytes.tv/forums.php?page=1&action=viewthread&threadid=10724

trackers,394yra,lilke,2,Tue Jun 9 12:50:24 2015 UTC,You're welcome! Just keep in mind that some anime actually is 1080p (HVFULL) or above 720p (HV1280+) which is why I use the website. Attack on Titan is one of those animes which is HV1280+.  http://anibin.blogspot.se/2013/04/1_9225.html
trackers,394yra,adamkex,3,Tue Jun 9 14:26:32 2015 UTC,"Searching about this online I found this comment which I think is useful so I will just copy/paste it here:  ""most modern TV anime is originally drawn in 720p resolution or close to it so there's no reason to pick 1080p over it. If you go for the larger resolution all you're getting is a questionable quality upscale and larger file size for what is most likely a lower quality version of the 720p one. In regards to movies the situation is a bit more complex since they may have been drawn using a larger resolution to target the large movie screens and 1080p may be worth it.  Bottom line: Stick with the resolution that's closer to the original one for the source material (720p for TV shows usually, Movies it's on a case by case basis). The reason is quite simple: doing your own upscale virtually always trumps having it done for you by the broadcaster. Technology evolves and when someone comes up with a better upscale algorithm it's best to use it on a clean(er) source."""

As for my personal recommendation, I'd definitely go with Hokuto no Ken/Fist of the North Star. That series pretty much pioneered the action genre in anime."
trackers,394yra,Spweedoo,2,Tue Jun 9 15:16:37 2015 UTC,If it's HV1280+ then you want to get 1080p. An upscale is better than a downscale.

It takes some time to get a ratio there because there isn't enough traffic, but if you grab some fairly active stuff it goes good.

trackers,391ppa,usr_bin_env,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:58:54 2015 UTC,They beg for donations. Also seeders are very low. For example some of the new content only has 1 seeder.

It also has a 48hr hit and run policy. But personally I would go with TSH instead.

It's just not built that way, and who you connect to is based entirely upon your chosen level of security. Plus, freenet allocates a certain amount of space of the users hard drive to store data, and this works because of the extremely small number of people using freenet. Millions of people use torrents and this simply wouldn't work.  As for Tor, I explained in another post that torrenting over Tor slows the entire network down for everyone using it. It's a shit thing to do, and you shouldn't do it or encourage it. i2p is where you're on the right track, to a certain extent. This would work for sites like tpb, sure, but not for private trackers. Those can only really exist exactly as they do now, none of the protocols out there like Tor, i2p, or freenet allow staff to determine if it's one sole user using the account or not."

I was referring to accessing torrent sites over Tor, (or I2P, or Freenet, etc.).  Not running torrents over Tor.  With all the domain takedowns in the clearnet eventually a lot of these sites are going to need to exist via hidden sites IMO.  If people need to use the Tor Browser just to get to TPB, KAT, etc, that seems OK to me.

Tor is slow by design because of the nodes your traffic passes through to reach it's final destination. When you torrent over Tor, you slow the entire network down for everyone using it.  The purpose of Tor is anonymity and to circumvent censorship, not to pirate things.

If you'd be interested in a seedbox you could check out /r/seedboxes but if you only torrent occacionally a VPN would probably work better for you.  Alternatively you could try to join a private tracker, you wouldn't necessarily (imho) need a VPN/Seedbox but it would definitely give you more protection. If you're interested in this please take a look at the sidebar of /r/trackers, there is plenty of info there and look around this subreddit, your questions have most certainly already been asked. I can always reccomend to start with Baconbits, a private tracker created by redditors, you would need to gather some of these internet points to be able to take the interview. Look at /r/baconbits for further info on that."

trackers,394prs,catvllvs,2,Tue Jun 9 06:34:31 2015 UTC,Is there anywhere better than What/MAM for this kind of stuff?
trackers,394prs,molotoviphone,3,Tue Jun 9 06:40:57 2015 UTC,Since piano sheets shit down MAN became the definitive source for sheet music torrents. It does have some film scores
trackers,394prs,AS7RONAUT,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:59:59 2015 UTC,"MAM is really the only place to get sheet music since pianosheets shut down. If you want to listen, check out LzTr :)"
trackers,394prs,tmstms,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:26:48 2015 UTC,"You know this right? http://imslp.org/wiki/Main_Page  It's only for music out of copyright though, but it should cover a lot of older orchestral music."
trackers,394prs,balthcat,2,Tue Jun 9 11:37:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the main issue is that relevant orchestration usually isn't out of copyright yet :(  I work in film music, so I usually like to read more modern stuff than the older literature.  I think I might just bite the bullet and spend 1,000 to get a yearly pass to the university library."

trackers,394prs,balthcat,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:51:16 2015 UTC,mya has interview
trackers,394prs,Amosqu,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"What.cd does in fact allow scores and while I don't benefit from them personally, I would encourage you and others who are members to cross pollinate to What.cd."
trackers,394prs,Amosqu,0,Sat Jun 13 06:52:14 2015 UTC,"Waffles and MAM have the most, since Pianosheets shut down.  What doesn't allow sheet music.  Edit: Nvm, it was under ebooks."
trackers,394prs,Amosqu,5,Tue Jun 9 18:59:43 2015 UTC,What doesn't allow sheet music.   This is blatantly untrue
trackers,390x65,34895348573857348759,5,Mon Jun 8 13:10:46 2015 UTC,"Dopesmoker is an excellent pick, recommend it highly."
trackers,390x65,Noizla,2,Mon Jun 8 20:31:23 2015 UTC,"Also recommend Dinosaur Jr. Green Mind isn't as good as some of their other albums, but it's still great."
trackers,390x65,Skyforsense,2,Tue Jun 9 00:11:02 2015 UTC,Thanks!!
trackers,390x65,Shepherd7X,2,Mon Jun 8 13:30:54 2015 UTC,"what do you consider tons? I've got 600 megs already, but I wasn't there I think for 10 minutes after announcement."
trackers,390x65,waIeIe,2,Mon Jun 8 14:06:08 2015 UTC,Oh well. How big pipe and which client do you use? I've got 4GB so far.
trackers,390x65,generalaid,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:18:29 2015 UTC,"yeah, but what parameters do they have."
trackers,390x65,waIeIe,0,Mon Jun 8 15:52:45 2015 UTC,"I got a problem with waffles, been there more than a month, 25gb+ upload & 5gb+ download and still haven t been promoted to power user, is it normal?"
trackers,390x65,BXLSZY,2,Mon Jun 8 15:55:39 2015 UTC,ratio above 1.05?
trackers,390x65,waIeIe,2,Tue Jun 9 08:56:03 2015 UTC,Yep 5.16
trackers,390x65,312c,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:59:58 2015 UTC,Did you upload a torrent? Need at least 80 gb upload as well.
trackers,390x65,waIeIe,2,Mon Jun 8 14:37:09 2015 UTC,It is not necessary to upload a torrent on waffles. The requirements for power users are:  25gb+ upload/ 5gb+ download and member for at least 4 weeks
trackers,390x65,hd909,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:40:05 2015 UTC,So use their support forum...
trackers,390x65,stainslemountaintops,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"I will, I just wondered if it was a recurrent issue. I ll give it more time"
trackers,390x65,idonteversleep,-7,Tue Jun 9 03:04:23 2015 UTC,People even download staff picks at Waffles given how easy it is to maintain an acceptable ratio there?
trackers,390x65,MechanicHippie,8,Tue Jun 9 09:01:40 2015 UTC,Well some people also download them because they want to listen to new music :)
trackers,392wxz,ChuckieC,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:33:42 2015 UTC,"Lol, just gave some away in /r/invites. Check over there or open a request."
trackers,390blj,acfman17,5,Mon Jun 8 09:04:30 2015 UTC,This keeps getting asked every few months. Yes there is a demand for it. Someone needs to get on it.
trackers,390blj,UnbornVisage,5,Tue Jun 9 02:10:01 2015 UTC,There are paid podcasts? lol
trackers,390blj,AS7RONAUT,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:20:48 2015 UTC,The only one I know is Hardcore History.
trackers,390blj,defan752,2,Wed Jun 10 03:15:12 2015 UTC,"I know OneofUs.net has paid podcasts, as does Giantbomb.  It's content I'd enjoy, but don't necessarily feel like paying for.    Feels weird having to explain this.  I want them for the same reason you would want any podcast."
