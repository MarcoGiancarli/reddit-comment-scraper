I believe shift by itself is already used to prevent interacting with an intractable block (like a chest) when placing another block on top of it, and it's likely that ctrl by itself and alt by itself already are also used for other special purposes. That's why a 2 key combination should be used for this."

Just a couple of problems (with solutions) though:   I don't think another block should be added JUST for mazes, this could be fixed by making it into obsidian. If we make it into obsidian, that is A LOT of obsidian, and a bit too overpowered I think, the solution to this, would be to make it into a special type of obsidian that instead spawns something like a silverfish or endermite when mined rather than dropping a block.  People could mine to the center, your solution is to add a zombie-like mob to give debuffs, but I don't think that would be very effective, what if we added something similar to the elder guardians in the center to give a debuff?    I also have some suggestions of things to add:   There should be traps throughout the maze, like tripwires that shoot you with poison arrows or other types of the new arrows which would work as a way to obtain some of the new arrows naturally, although not many. Also maybe add some one way door things, something you can only pass through one way, and cant come back out, although, this might be too difficult.    Overall, I think this is an awesome idea, and very unique, and I can see myself very annoyed at the fact that I died and lost my items in a maze, and have NO idea how to get back to them, and I look forward to that in a game, because currently, minecraft is a little too easy."

I'm not sure, If someone wants to mine all that obsidian, then good luck to them. Alternatively, slab the outskirts of the maze and make a farm in the middle. I personally would want a way to get these new blocks. Especially that new light source. Surely if a hostile mob spawned on you every time you tried to mine a block, then you wouldn't be able to mine the blocks right? [Try to mine, Whistler spawns, Gives you mining fatigue, Mining fatigue weirs off, Repeat]. I was thinking of ways to do this, and I decided the whole enderguardian technique wouldn't work to well as it's range, even if adjusted would work on players above or below or just outside the maze, and as this is surrounded in stone, it would be very hard to get into the maze. I suppose this could be altered to only effect the 39x6x39 structure though.   I do want traps, and I wanted a way to add them without making them obstruct the maze. I also would want to add them in a way that doesn't make pats of the maze recognisable.  One way doors could work too, I was also thinking that there could be a random lever placed in a random part of the maze that opens up another path, most likely the path to the main treasure room. This way the maze is more dynamic.  Thanks for your comments :)"

They should have a mechanic more unique than ""run at you at a snail's pace and inflict a debuff if they actually get past your sword"". The debuff is especially bad at preventing you from mining through the walls as a Whistler actually has to get close enough to you to use it, which is difficult when you're so effective at keeping melee mobs out of range and can place blocks freely even with Mining Fatigue to block off passages (and simply wait out the debuff to continue mining through everything).  Also not fond of diamonds as loot, those are already too common for the uses they have.   Otherwise, so long as the unique loot given by the chest is good and the mazes are randomized, it's a pretty good idea.

minecraftsuggestions,3ds5zb,skidbld,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:55:52 2015 UTC,"Emberstone is pretty cool.  Sparks are kind of boring, and the Nether needs hostile mobs way more than it needs passives.  Obsidian beaches are kinda cool.   Blazing crystals are interesting but will probably end up being worthless, seeing as durability is far more desirable when enchanting items than enchantability is (you get longer-lasting yet still excellent enchantments, as opposed to getting excellent enchantments more often yet on a short-lived tool)."
minecraftsuggestions,3ds5zb,PhilosophicalHobbit,2,Sat Jul 18 23:41:23 2015 UTC,"Well, the nether has a trade off. The nether isn't as dangerous mob-wise as the overworld. Less mobs spawn, and non-passives spawn extremely rarely or in structures. The consequence is that other dangers and obstacles are present (lava, getting lost, chasms, fire) and there is no peaceful time, like daytime in the overworld.  But there needs to be, in my mind, a bigger rank up on the dangers in the nether."
minecraftsuggestions,3ds5zb,skidbld,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:46:39 2015 UTC,"Almost all hazards in the Nether are stationary and can therefore be avoided (blazes/wither skellies aren't, but they're tied to netherforts which are); Ghasts are the sole exception, and they have terrible accuracy. The only real danger is getting lost which isn't exclusive to the Nether and is avoided by using F3.  ""Safe time"" in the Nether is virtually all the time due to the low threat that Ghasts pose (Creepers are worse than them and they exist in the Overworld's ""safe time"", too).  The Nether needs hostiles more than anything because of the low threat it poses overall; there's absolutely no reason for the Nether to be comparable to the Overworld as you are saying, much less safer as it is in practice."

minecraftsuggestions,3ds5zb,derpyness2435,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:15:44 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of the Spark and the Emberstone. Perhaps the Emberstone should also give off a small amount of light, like the amount that redstone ore gives off when you step on it.  I would like to see the Nether include some analogy of wood and a class of craftable tools, ie: Quartz tools.  The wood would be some kind of scrawny, dead looking tree with thorny leafless foliage that damages anything that touches it, so you would have to use an axe to cut through it. You could only plant the trees on soul sand, gravel, or netherrack, and the tree itself would be a gnarled mass of thorny foliage, low to the ground, with only about 4-6 wood blocks mixed in. One advantage of this ""Nether wood"" would be that, unlike other kinds of wood, when it catches fire it burns forever like Netherrack, but never burns up. It can still be used for fuel however. These trees would occur in small mini-forest patches on the lowest elevations of the Nether, just above the lava-sea level.  Quartz tools would be stronger than Iron tools, but with less durability. This reflecting the hardness of quartz and its breakable crystalline structure. Some Quartz armor might be nice too.  And while we are modifying the Nether, simply adding some different Nether biomes would be nice. Just to change things up from it all looking the same."
minecraftsuggestions,3ds5zb,thelink225,0,Sun Jul 19 16:46:50 2015 UTC,You know what i find funny? the fact that despite the nether being advertised as this hell realm of infinite despair. i survive longer in there then in the over-world. i find the dimension way to peaceful.  Sparks shouldn't be passive. They'll make blazes useless. I think they should be fast creatures that chase you and light you on fire on contact.
minecraftsuggestions,3ds5zb,CheesyDorito101,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:27:58 2015 UTC,Obsidian beaches don't make sense because there is no water in the nether. But I guess that it doesn't matter because it's just a game... I like the idea anyway. But also I think that the sparks light you on fire idea is also good because it's pretty easy to survive in the nether. I also think that sparks shouldn't drop anything. Kind of like endermites and silverfish.

minecraftsuggestions,3ds731,Muzzle_Flash767,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:15:29 2015 UTC,Yeah like maybe give it a durability of around 3 so if you need to make a trip to say find sheep or find a water temple you can have an easy portable bed. But if you are going on a pilgrimage for say you'll either have to take multiple sleeping beds or brave the nights. This would be further enhance if they didn't stack.

minecraftsuggestions,3ds731,Muzzle_Flash767,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:07:19 2015 UTC,"Ya. I was thinking 3-5 would be a good durability.

In some mini-games, people steal all your iron when it is already smelted, inside the furnace. If it already follows this pattern, the enchantment tables can do it too.  The only problem is that, differently from the furnace, which has a global output, the enchantment table shows different results for each player, and if two of them click at the exact same time, there would be a conflict (besides that more people sharing the same lapis could cause some confusion). Almost everything in the game has a reason to be like it is, so maybe that's why the developers made the lapis session-based.
