The meshes on the hatches stopped magnetic (or otherwise) charges being effective."

For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty at Valhey, France. On the afternoon of 14 September 1944, Sgt. Sadowski as a tank commander was advancing with the leading elements of Combat Command A, 4th Armored Division, through an intensely severe barrage of enemy fire from the streets and buildings of the town of Valhey. As Sgt. Sadowski's tank advanced through the hail of fire, it was struck by a shell from an 88-mm. gun fired at a range of 20 yards. The tank was disabled and burst into flames. The suddenness of the enemy attack caused confusion and hesitation among the crews of the remaining tanks of our forces. Sgt. Sadowski immediately ordered his crew to dismount and take cover in the adjoining buildings. After his crew had dismounted, Sgt. Sadowski discovered that 1 member of the crew, the bow gunner, had been unable to leave the tank. Although the tank was being subjected to a withering hail of enemy small-arms, bazooka, grenade, and mortar fire from the streets and from the windows of adjacent buildings, Sgt. Sadowski unhesitatingly returned to his tank and endeavored to pry up the bow gunner's hatch. While engaged in this attempt to rescue his comrade from the burning tank, he was cut down by a stream of machinegun fire which resulted in his death. The gallant and noble sacrifice of his life in the aid of his comrade, undertaken in the face of almost certain death, so inspired the remainder of the tank crews that they pressed forward with great ferocity and completely destroyed the enemy forces in this town without further loss to themselves. The heroism and selfless devotion to duty displayed by Sgt. Sadowski, which resulted in his death, inspired the remainder of his force to press forward to victory, and reflect the highest tradition of the armed forces."

DestroyedTanks,3dua56,Exxec71,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:06:23 2015 UTC,"Here is a better explanation.   Technically, since thermal imaging devices capture infrared signatures at the mid-infrared range they can be considered a sub-class of IR detectors. However, the major difference between these technologies is that they differ in how their detection takes place. Infrared detectors require an active signature to be received, whereas thermal devices record the current signatures of the devices based on their current heat pattern. Both have their applications in security, surveillance, and military technology. The thermal imagers have the added bonus of not having to carry its own active beam in which to ""see"" in making it invaluable to operations where secrecy is of the essence since it is virtually undetectable.   Also I believe it was night vision and IR as one probably blanked the screen and so switching could help resolve what they see in order to confirm clean kill or not."

Also because the turret is facing rearward, you can see the storage boxes on the turret many main battle tanks would have.  In comments and that thread, it's suggested that bmp autocannon ammo would produce the same effect as a 125mm round(s) :> ATGM perhaps but bmps may not have that, as you can also see in many videos and footage.

HESH will shred BMP's and older generation tanks with non-laminate armour as well as any HEAT round will, and performs far better against man-made structures and fortifications. Where HESH falls flat is against dismounted infantry in the open: It produces barely any frag. Great for supporting friendly infantry in urban areas but not great for killing people smart enough to hide in a hole in a field, as infantry tend to do (annoyingly)."

It's time to admit that HESH is excellent for certain roles but in this day and age is a bit over specialized."

Two members of a British tank crew were killed and two critically injured after their Challenger 2 tank was fired on by another Challenger tank in southern Iraq. A single tank round took the turret off the tank in the misdirected attack, which happened on Monday in pitch darkness.  The two dead men were members of the Queen's Royal Lancers, part of the First Royal Regiment of Fusiliers battle group. They were named as Corporal Stephen Allbutt, 35, from Stoke-on-Trent, and Trooper David Clarke, 19, from Littleworth, Staffordshire.   http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/26/iraq.rorymccarthy1"
