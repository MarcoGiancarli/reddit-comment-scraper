My plan is to use it to isolate memcached instances in a multi site environment.  Ex:  Web server hosting multiple sites has firewall rules for each user account allowing access to a single port on the memcached server/cluster.  The memcached server has a firewall rule only allowing access from the web server's private IP.

I'm not saying it's the fault of the cloud providers (correlation != causation), but there is something about deploying to the cloud that increases the frequency of insecure deployments. Could be the images don't get updated, could be that it's seen as a black box that doesn't need a sysadmin, could be that more of the latest (and potentially insecure) software gets deployed to the cloud; there are a lot of variables but that's not what I was trying to focus on, all I can say for now is that the majority of these NoSQL database issues are seen in the cloud."

Often they'd be people with experience and at least some knowledge of security.  With the rise of Full Stack Engineers (jack of all types, master of none) doing everything, and how unsexy security is, it's extremely likely you've got people running your service who have no clue why it's bad to have a database server bound to an Internet facing interface, especially when it means their tools can talk straight to it!"

You can lock it down in jetty to certain IP addresses, but AFAIK it's not really designed with authentication in mind.  It's certainly a lot different than setting up logins in MSSQL, Postgres, or other RDBMS. Is there a design reason these FOSS NoSQL/search indexers aren't interested in logins?

Even Graylog2 which relies on MonoDB and ES make it ""super easy"" with drop in VMs which can activate any of the roles. Even their ""the right way"" guide doesn't link directly to guides which talk about the proper way to setup a ES cluster with auth, health checks, etc.  I mean, yes, the onus is ultimately up to the engineer setting it up, but I do feel there's a rhetoric of ""drop in easy"" which clearly has some consequences."

The issue has three parts:   Cloud Providers making it easy to accidentally expose services to everything. On Amazon EC2 for example you have to work hard to expose a service to the world and it warns you every step of the way, but many hosting places don't bother; Software Providers delivering software with insecure defaults. This usually isn't the fault of the actual provider these days, what happens is that the provider makes some basic tradeoff - for example no auth but local-only connection (which is fine in most cases), then someone packages it up and changes the default settings to something else when they do it, either as a demo VM or whatever; People who are new to this stuff doing whatever it takes to just get the damn thing to work. They're often in a perfect storm of a lack of security knowledge, a lack of secure ways of performing the action they want to do (like the ssh forwarding switches) and poor infrastructure (dynamic IPs, no VPN bastion etc which mean they can't make use of simple solutions).   The problem really with this and other related articles is that they tend to be interpreted as ""<software> is bad"", but in practice if you design something for widespread adoption you're going to get this kind of shit happening, we don't have any mechanism to prevent it without impacting on people who know what they're doing.

There are a large number of ways passwords can leak, sorry you are not familiar with most of them.  Malware is only one.  Poorly designed websites and applications will put clear text passwords in places they don't belong.  Secretaries still write them on sticky notes.  The vast majority of people do not use hard to guess passwords.  People reuse passwords from site to site.  Maybe you think many of those issues can be dealt with by password managers and education.  That's true, but congratulations, you have failed security and usability 101.  How many decades have we security people been trying to educate people about secure passwords with almost no success?  It doesn't work.  Web site designers can enforce a higher standard that resists the people Factor by using 2FA or related technologies.  Security involves defence in depth, it is a basic principle.  If you have a website designed to alert operations when somebody continually gets their password right yet gets the 2FA Wrong, and if you combine that with account lockout or similar defences, then the system can effectively defend itself against something that a single complex password does not do.  In this case the 6 digits issue does not matter: the attacker gets a few tries and then done, and operations immediately knows something is not right.

The author is falling into the trap of thinking about a single person and a hacker only targetting that one person, rather than the big picture (lots of people, single hacker).  Let's look at the real world use-case.  Most people use the same password, or few passwords, for everything. When some crappy site gets hacked, that stores their password in plain text, then the hacker has access to a huge list of usernames (email addresses) and passwords. With many users in this list, their gmail, facebook, paypal, and dropbox accounts have now also been compromised. It's accounts like these that are the mother-lode. In fact, every site they use (via a password reset to sent to their gmail account) is compromised. Ouch!  But, each of those sites support 2-factor. If enabled, said hacker will move on to an account that is actually immediately vulnerable.  Why would a hacker spend ""3 days"" brute forcing a single account, and risk getting caught/ip banned/etc, when the next user in the password dump is probably vulnerable?  Therefore, for most people (i.e. the same ""most people"" that use the same password for everything), 2-factor is the difference between 1 random forum account being compromised, that nobody cares about, and that same person's entire online life.  There are ways to protect brute-forcing not locking a given account. IP-based rate limiting is simple and very effective. A given IP address can only try 1 login attempt every 5 seconds. Job done. The real user can log in from their own IP first time, without problem.  Time based login does add security. This forces the 2FA password to change every 30 seconds. If it didn't change then anyone discovering the 2FA code, by any means, ever, could use it. Also if it didn't expire, then someone could use an old and unused code that they saw on their friend's phone screen later.  The semantics don't really change the fact that 2FA works very well.  It's not hard to back up. I printed out the QR code for each of my Google Authenticator codes and shoved them in my safe."

Individually it was a strong password. But as soon as stratfor was hacked and the list of usernames (usually emails) and passwords in plain text was leaked, that strong password was shit.   2FA is good because it stops low-effort hacks caused by the failure of users like me (I'm not tech ignorant, but I'm lazy enough to re-use a password I thought was good enough, and I trusted the security of at least one website more than they deserved). Fortunately the email and password combo I used was not the same one I use for anything sensitive, but it did lead to someone hacking my blizzard games account. Worst of all, at the time, I didn't have 2FA set up for the gmail account involved, which had only recently become available. If someone had wanted to do some serious damage to me  (rather than just steal my wow gold) I could have been in for a lot more trouble.   2FA for gmail, or for my blizzard games account (which are both now available and I hope, widely used) would have saved me from any comprimises even though I didn't follow best practices for security. It's extremely easy to use (app on my smartphone that I never do not have in my posession) and it's good enough to prevent low-effort hacking attempts.   2FA is great because generating lots of strong, unique passwords is literally impossible for human beings. I'll be totally honest, I still re-use passwords. Maybe one day I'll get around to resetting every login I have to something unique and get a password manager (I'm sure as hell not doing that without a manager) but frankly it's a hundred times easier to just use 2FA for anything that has to actually be secure."

netsec,3du7su,XANi_,2,Tue Jul 21 01:03:57 2015 UTC,"At it's core, U2F requires hardware element that provisions public key pairs and protects the private keys from unauthorized exfiltration or use. That's a smartcard - it just happens to be designed to work with existing web authentication use cases (e.g. a Google account).  It actually does a much better job of this than a traditional smart card would (assuming authenticating with a public key in the manner of SSH was somehow supported by Google accounts) because it uses a different key pair for each origin/application, which means the authentication system cannot be used to track user behavior across multiple sites/services. While it is technically possible to use a different SSH key for each service (and some people do), it is a significant amount of extra effort (and is not well supported by commonly available smart cards) so users often reuse the same key everywhere. This would be a serious privacy concern on the web. So I think U2F is not only a smart card that lets you log in to your Google Account, it's actually superior to the status quo for public key authentication.  If you want to spring for the Yubikey Neo/Neo-N, you can get lots more features including support for using the device as a GPG or PIV smartcard, but that's neither here nor there."

netsec,3du7su,homakov,2,Sun Jul 19 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"I am starting to wonder if you even know what 2FA is and what the real benefit is. The true benefit of 2FA is that in order to authenticate (proof that you are being you) yourself, more than one type of proof is used.   Let me give an example. In an ideal world, when you sign in somewhere, only you know your password. A long time information systems relied on that. Recap: user X enters the correct password. It is enough proof that hser X is indeed user X.   Unfortunately, the world is not as ideal as it seems. People aren't always as aware as they should be. Passwords like Welcome01 are more common than they should be. People click on attachments in e-mails being keylogged. People click on links in phishing mails authenticating themselves to the wrong service. Possibilities for blackhats are almost infinite to obtain the password of user X.   That is why more and more services don't only rely on the magic password only user X is supposed to know. Because that is not the world we live in. The services have a sense of realism.   Instead more than one thing is asked in order for user X to authenticate himself. That is what 2FA is for. If implemented well, the 2nd form of authentication is not relied on something the user knows, like a password, but something the user has. Like for example a smart card, token, mobile phone. This makes the probability of user X actualy being user X higher.   Is it bulletproof? No it isn't. I guess nothing really is. At least it is more bulletproof than not asking for other proof.   That is first thing.   I seriously doubt your professional knowledge when you started talking about the keylogger. If implemented properly, the 2nd proof of user X being user X, can only be used once. And guess what. User X just used that one time. Good luck with your keylogger. It just proven itself worthless because of the 2FA.  Don't get me wrong, 2FA doesn't solve all problems. Especially not with web based application the weakest link becomes the session identifier, the cookie. If an attacker manages to steal your cookie and thereby hijack your session even if you have 100FA, you are pretty screwed. So bulletproof no, better than nothing? Pretty sure!"

netsec,3du7su,homakov,2,Mon Jul 20 23:53:33 2015 UTC,"As already stated, it isn't bulletproof. However thrreats you are describing are far more advanced than just stealing someones credentials.   Actually, with what you describe even if you have a passeord manager with a real big passphrase, you will also be screwed.   Thereby what you are proposing is: let's also skip the password. People will get in eventually.  That is where you are actually wrong. There is no such thing as bulletproof security. The goal is to make it aa hard aa possible for an attacker to gain access to an asset you own. 2FA makes it harder and needs more advanced hacking techniques, so it actually is an improvement.   When you talked about a password being something you have (neurons in your brain etc) and is thereby the same as a smartcard/hardware token, you are also wrong. If I just send you an image of my password in cleartext written out on a piece of paper, it is knowledge you also posess and is enough to give you access to my account if it is the only form of authentication. If I send you an image of the 2FA smart card, you cannot. Because you don't own the thing. That is the difference between knowledge and posessing something. And therefor there is a difference between the two."

What makes a numeric OTP strong enough is that you need the computational power to test all combinations within the time window it takes for the OTP to change.

Security Keys are a 2FA device that fixes most of the problems that the article points out:   Minimal hassle No eavesdropping/phising risk Nigh-impossible to bruteforce   It does all of this because it's not an OTP generator, it's a USB crypto device.  You plug it in and/or tap on it to activate (depending on the model), and it establishes a secure connection to the target server to verify you.  It still isn't good if the machine you plug it into is compromised, but even there, you can limit the impact by requiring the key to be periodically reused: even if they use a keylogger to grab the password, they still don't have the key's credentials, so they're limited to the one session.

netsec,3du7su,homakov,7,Sun Jul 19 16:43:38 2015 UTC,"The ONLY way to ensure users have strong passwords is to generate passwords for them. 2FA essentially does this, while preserving the user's illusion that they are in control over their password. The main flaw is that the authentication factor is too low entropy in some systems. Others (like SSH which can use a proper PKI certificate as its second factor) don't suffer from this issue. It's not an inherent flaw with 2FA, it's an implementation failure.  You're entirely correct that there's really only one factor: some sequence of bits entered by the user. You're also correct that 2FA systems are mostly equivalent to password managers from a security perspective, but I think that the feeling of control is critical from a usability perspective.   You (feel you) control who has the 2FA token (or your phone). You don't (feel you) control your passwords in a password manager, the program does! That makes password managers scary, especially after years of being told to never write them down anywhere. Changing the narrative is harder than adding the new factor."

And a bad user experience is going to lead to them making poor choices, or moving to another service/product.  A certificate with an 8192-bit RSA key would provide an extremely secure authentication method, but it would be incredibly slow and inconvenient. A password of ""12345"" is extremely insecure, but very fast and convenient. The optimum is somewhere in the middle, finding it is important.   So even though in both the 2FA and password manager systems you control some aspects of the system (you have physical posession of the token/phone/password database) you don't control others (you don't control what the 2FA code is, you no longer have the passwords memorized, etc). Which feeling the user has more strongly will determine their preference for the system.

It's also fantastic material, and you can work through all of it if you have patience and a general sense of 6.004-level material, but it's probably more than you need.  Most MIT CS classes have publicly accessible class websites, by the way, so you can look at the official class website if OCW doesn't have the material you want.

Would that give an error?   If fragmented memory is a thing, is there an exploit that takes advantage of it?"
netsec,3dj5lk,hotdoghorse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's possible. One thing that helps a bit is virtual memory / paging: each program doesn't directly see physical memory, but sees a view where each virtual page is mapped, individually, to a physical page. (Basically, there's a large lookup table called the page table, that's cached in the CPU chipset.) While it's common (and there are vague performance increases) to have a block of pages in virtual memory correspond to a contiguous physical block, there's no requirement. The kernel can set things up so that, say, virtual address 0x401000 maps to physical address 0x101000, virtual address 0x402000 maps to physical address 0x105000, and virtual address 0x403000 maps to physical address 0x103000. So there are gaps between the physical pages, and they're even out of order, but we still have three pages of contiguous virtual memory.  In addition, you have way more room in virtual address space than physical address space, partly because you have one address space (that is, virtual-to-physical mapping) per program, and partly because very few 64-bit computers have 264 bytes of actual RAM. So you get more freedom to have fun with the address space; giving everything plenty of breathing room in virtual memory doesn't actually waste any resources.  There is a somewhat pedantic distinction in UNIX between the ""heap"" as traditionally defined (aka the ""program break""), and anonymous memory mappings. The ""heap"" is actually required to be contiguous virtual memory, extending right after the program's own code. Modern implementations of malloc will either use the ""heap"" or just make new, unrelated mappings using mmap, depending on various factors like the size of the allocation. In casual speech, unless you're implementing a memory allocator, people tend to refer to either of these sources as the heap.  Hopefully that made sense; virtual memory confused me for a while until it ""clicked"" and I don't really understand what I did other than keep staring at the concept. :)"

Being able to recognise ethernet preamble or that 0800 is IPv4 can save you a hell of a lot of time. Especially if dealing with an embedded system and debugging something like bad roll-over when reading from block ram.  Same with hex conversions - you can get to the point where you can do it faster than typing it into a calculator even for large numbers. It saves a huge amount of time when you're standing over a colleagues desk trying to spot the error & avoids the whole clumsy lean over and use their keyboard standing up kerfuffle..  Base64 admittedly is something you rarely come across. But it is still good to know how to do it manually.

It doesn't need to be captured all at once. This gives a lot of flexibility for the attacker.  There are also still ideas on how to improve the attack.

After all, that's what we security folks always tell them (I do hope we have some effect on them!). So phishing is not possible.

The other is a malicious website that downloads a JavaScript agent to your browser.  That agent can't access your cookies for the victim website, but it can sniff traffic between your browser and any target website.  By sniffing traffic, it will capture encrypted versions of your cookie sent to the victim website.  It can then replay those encrypted cookies with modification and try to deduce the real cookie value.  I think that's how it is supposed to work, but let author confirm.  At least that's how BEAST works.  Is it practical?  That malicious JavaScript would have to live in your browser for 75 hours, and your session would have to be alive on the victim website for 75 hours.

But certain videos simply do not stream at the same rate and if you follow the trend of which videos are lower quality streams on PC you see a consistent trend that supports that theory.

Although personally I don't really agree with:     Use UUID instead of sequential IDs for Primary Key at least for users:   as just a ""no-brainer"" choice. You should be ensuring at all times that it is not possible for the user to bypass your security by fiddling with your URL and the benefits of having your ids as simple numbers during debugging or bug reporting is very useful when developing smaller scale or low traffic systems. Specifically GUIDs are great for replication/sharding/horizontal scaling but I don't buy into the wisdom that their use is better security. You could argue that having GUIDs means that some developers might just rely on the users inability to guess them as security instead of actually dealing with the problem of your site returning sensitive data upon user's guesswork."
netsec,3d5med,_tpyo,2,Tue Jul 14 15:17:21 2015 UTC,"Hi _tpyo, thanks for your compliment and sharing your thoughts. You're right regarding if the user knows the ID, the system must block unauthorized actions because we're talking about security by obscurity. However, security by obscurity, even being weak, is still a defense layer. It increases the time that an attacker would need to invest, if for example, he finds a vulnerability that lock users accounts just by sending their IDs.  If you take the Kerckhoffs's principle ""A cryptosystem should be secure EVEN if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge."", note that there is the ""EVEN"" word, which means that obscurity actually works for a certain degree, and as the point of the article is to provide security insights for applications developed from scratch, change the type of the primary key in a later point in time may be costly. So, setting UUID at first sounds like a good idea for me but not only for security points, for the other advantages from a software engineering perspective as well."

What irks me is the idea that someone would be willfully ignorant of the potential of the exploit because they're using GUIDs and therefore think themselves secure as technically they are no more secure. By all means if you're in a rush and creating a site where security is less important then use the GUIDs and ignore everything else around them because you don't care that a 1337 hacker could exploit it as long as some uneducated gimboid that's trying to edit URLs by hand cannot. However what is important is that you're appreciating that trade-off and marking it. My worry is reducing the lesson into just the phrase ""GUIDs are more secure"" isn't precise and can be harmful as a rule of thumb."

netsec,3d579k,sarciszewski,3,Tue Jul 14 09:57:48 2015 UTC,"To prefix this: I do not know what I am talking about when it comes to crypto. This is just my understanding and is probably flawed, I welcome any corrections  This is true and you're right, it's generally a good idea to use existing code but I believe that's also the point of this library - it works around the existing .NET implementations, which are assumed to have been built securely and tested by Microsoft. Whether you trust that or not is up to you, but talking about it as though the whole implementation is new is a bit misleading  I generally agree with the push to limit LOC that needs to be reviewed which is partly why I'm so fond of Rust's model of only relying on ""unsafe"" code where absolutely necessary. As far as I can tell, the intent of the author is to limit LOC so that the library can be far more easily reviewed and can be reviewed by anyone   For example, this is his implementation of secure RNG: https://github.com/sdrapkin/SecurityDriven.Inferno/blob/master/CryptoRandom.cs  I'm not an expert so I can't tell you if that's good or bad, but the file itself is so short that someone else can do so far more easily than if the entire RNG engine had been re-implemented  Additionally, if the pre-requisite for any crypto library is to have been peer reviewed and used for a long time, then it's going to be impossible for any new library to ever exist. If you're running sensitive production code then yes absolutely use BC, but for people like myself that aren't running any kind of critical system, using an alternative library is fine and can be a good way to push the field forward"

I've also performed several code audits for cryptography applications for Paragon Initiative Enterprises.  Their CSPRNG code is secure and in line with best practices. It pulls data from the OS's entropy provider and returns an unbiased value.  I haven't audited their entire library, but their CryptoRandom.cs file appears to be as secure as a .NET library can be."

Moreover - as i said - if is using MS Code you are severely limited on the platform you deploy your code.  Anyway, this still is build on top of a lower level API - there is still enough room for bad crypto.  And as i said, just compare the contributer and community size from BC to this project - you would never ever use this lib in a production stable environment - sure there is no harm if you are just toying with something and want to try the lib out - but apart from that you wouldnt use it - there isnt any real support - any real Q&A or anyone that has used the lib for years.  There is a reason why you can count basically all crypto libs for different platforms on one hand."

Vulns still show up   The arguments against BC are so weak   Besides the fact that this library uses the BC crypto providers, as already pointed out, there is a real problem with straight up using the BC API.  Time and time again on engagements, I've seen people use the BC crypto library wrong and insecurely. It's painful to look at.  That's not to say that simply throwing this library out there will solve it. In fact, I don't think it will. You can't really solve people's fundamental lack of understanding of what they're doing, by simply providing a nicer API. That simply postpones the problem, as people can deliver things by understanding even fewer things."

Where I currently work as an attempt to secure license options they are storing the licenses (as literally a list of tuples - {id, enabled}) in the embedded system. The embedded system is on the same carrier board as the x64 SBC communicating with a direct Ethernet link via TCP/IP.  The licenses are verified when entered then stored in a user accessible database as {ID, Enabled} tuples. This fires off a trigger to re-send the information to the embedded system. Its sent as a list of tuples. The messages are ""encrypted"" because according to the tech lead there is a serious risk of someone sniffing them. When I say encrypted, they are sent as PGP messages as a string. Yes with ""--BEGIN PGP MESSAGE--"" and all. I am not in any way joking. They are ""encrypted"" using a public key saved on the server in a user readable file. They are not signed.  On each boot they are queried back from the embedded system again encrypted with another public key. The private key is hard coded into our byte code.  I brought up that this was fatally flawed the moment I heard about it. That the embedded storage gave us nothing. That the link to the embedded was just about the only thing a user would struggle to access. That we wanted authentication, not encryption. That anyone bothered enough to modify messages in flight could craft their own with the public key which wasn't even at least in the byte code. And worst of all, that anyone trying to steal licenses didn't have to bother because all they had to do was run ""UPDATE.. SET ENABLED=true WHERE ID = .."" on the database & it would even go and store them persistently in the embedded system for you..  It then gets worse. In automated tests the options code hung the entire comms link. I made the mistake of mentioning it was probably the CSPRNG waiting for entropy. They replaced the seed with a hard coded byte array to test my theory. That ended up being the fix..  I applied for new positions that night. I start in August. On the plus side it is pretty convenient when working with a release system not having to bother generating a license to test something option related..  *Edits - Grammar / Words"

So ServerNameIndication was implemented (SNI).  So if I understand that correctly.  I go to Reddit.com, and my browser sends a request to 198.41.209.141 with the hostname.  The server reads the hostname and supplies the correct certificate.  Then the encryption process begins.  I don't think putty sends the initial host name portion but not by a place I could easily check.    tl;dr In the URL https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/3d0ra3/tunneling_data_and_commands_over_dns_to_bypass/ct1o3e1?context=3, -- https://www.reddit.com would be sent in the clear, in order to allow for the browser to retrieve the SSL Cert.

netsec,3d0ra3,jbl1,-2,Sun Jul 12 22:53:59 2015 UTC,"IPS can also be a serious liability as well, if an attacker finds a way to cause a self-dos as a result of tricking it into blocking access that would otherwise be authorized."
netsec,3d0ra3,GregoryPanic,0,Mon Jul 13 05:47:51 2015 UTC,Any tool misused or misconfigured can be a liability.
netsec,3d0ra3,AngryRoaringAnt,2,Mon Jul 13 15:31:24 2015 UTC,"Not really what i'm saying though.  One of the defining features of an IPS is its ability to take action against a detected threat without a human in the loop.    Causing an IPS to DOS its own network is more of a ""feature"" than a ""misconfiguration"".  If one is able to determine the configuration of an IPS, you can naturally craft traffic that will can cause serious disruption.    This is why most people scoff at OTS ids and ips technology.  It's not that they aren't useful, it's that whenever a sentence starts with ""My IDS/IPS will..."", you're almost certainly about to say something that needs ""Except if...""."
netsec,3d0ra3,GregoryPanic,2,Mon Jul 13 19:16:13 2015 UTC,"Well. You still have to configure an IPS unless you rely on some kind of black box sold as a silver bullet. This was just my point.  It's still a game of cat and mouse, but a proper configuration should not allow an attacker to raise a DOS.  Anyway, in the worst scenario, it's still better to have some outage of a server and to take measures to solve this than to have its data being leaked to some unknown attacker imho."
netsec,3d0ra3,AngryRoaringAnt,2,Mon Jul 13 20:04:37 2015 UTC,"I'm continually surprised at how many people think that IDS/IPS is the bleeding edge of network inspection.  I got yelled at the other day because I didn't get a sig in ON THE SPOT for the latest flash vulernabilities.  When I tried to explain that the endpoint solutions were a better fit for detection a very important person got hella pissed and took me to task in front of his staff.  Thankfully higher-ups were briefed on the situation and told the dbag to back down.  Still, Mr. Bag was CONVINCED that IDS was the absolute best tool for the job (seeing as he would know a lot about tools seeing as how he is a massive tool.)"

The way I see it is yes, endpoint sigs should be created and may work better....BUT, detecting and blocking a threat the moment it hits your wire before it reaches your endpoints is also important, maybe even equally, depending. Like having AV, hips, ips, fw and your web proxy detecting the same exploit kit variant. More sigs the better, usually ;)"
netsec,3d0ra3,siliconmon,2,Thu Jul 16 00:46:32 2015 UTC,Which IPS?
netsec,3d0ra3,lowermiddleclass,2,Sun Jul 12 23:51:00 2015 UTC,Agreed. This is a pretty common practice among certain groups to exfil data. We monitor for this type of activity; it is pretty easy to spot.
netsec,3d0ra3,cod3n,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:05:07 2015 UTC,"Joking aside, I think we need to be careful as a community to not assume that people have these kinds of things in place.  The value of a good IPS/IDS might be obvious to us, but most of the people here work in netsec (i.e. an employer has realised the value of netsec) and we are reading about our work to further our knowledge. This puts us in the top 1%. The other 99% are relying to a cheapy firewall to try and stop things like this."

netsec,3d0ra3,defconoi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:36:37 2015 UTC,"I've heard this as a concern from customers lately.  I've had some success in detection where DPI fails (after all, it is DNS...) by analyzing outbound traffic patterns on a network for DNS not sourced by an organization's known DNS servers.  This addresses the first case.  If the attacker is savvy enough to actually register a domain and list the nasty DNS server as the authoritative server for the domain, as pointed out in the second case, then it comes down to looking at traffic pattern of DNS in general.  In most cases, this type of thing is likely to show up as a steady plateau of DNS traffic that likely does not look like regular DNS.  NetFlow is handy for this type of metric."
netsec,3d0ra3,skoorbevad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:01:52 2015 UTC,You'll be surprised at the number of times DNS is not filtered or firewalled....
netsec,3d0ra3,silentxor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:52:53 2015 UTC,Splitview DNS also helps detect and mitigate this as the compromise host can't just directly C2 to the DNS server directly they have to go through a central DNS source. Tie some good DNS threat intelligence and DNS protocol enforcement onto there and you have a pretty decent defense. Nothing is perfect but the advantage is now you have one central location do to behavioral based analytics on.

netsec,3d0ra3,cod3n,-1,Sun Jul 12 18:00:38 2015 UTC,"Cool, but not very effective. One of the problems is that you are using a ""unknown"" DNS server, which usually is not allowed by strict setup. One way around this is using a valid domain with extremely low TTL on TXT, aes256 it and query the domain at 8.8.8.8? Then just wait for the domain to get blacklisted.   As for firewall, I assume you are talking about a IPS and not a traditional layer 4 FW, where you basically can tunnel anything over udp53?"
netsec,3d0ra3,Eplox,6,Mon Jul 13 00:01:29 2015 UTC,"Read the whole piece, the article goes on to outline a mechanism for relaying data through the victims DNS server by registering the host running dnscat as a primary authority."

netsec,3d0ra3,andreashappe,0,Sun Jul 12 19:45:29 2015 UTC,"DNS was never the issue for us. We block outbound DNS for all except the local DNS servers. If you want to query DNS it can only happen recursively through our domain controllers.  That being said, nothing to stop someone from using port 80 or 443. Pretty much impossible to lock down those two ports."
netsec,3d0ra3,presidentjim,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:37:34 2015 UTC,And this is why people should stop trying to re-invent the wheel. Port 80 or 443 work just fine! Shells arent always needed until you establish a foothold.

The newer stuff works similarly, they just have more intelligence in deciding what to save for analysis and what to discard. What you are doing currently makes sure that they save most of your traffic - just in case.  Personally, I think that for the moment the snake tactic works best. No one notices the snake that slithers in high grass. There's so much insane babble on the Internet that you have to do something very specific to raise a flag. That's where your risk profile comes in. In case that has changed some day, I will get serious about encryption. If a valid and usable product exists. If I had actually valuable data, I would have already switched my mode of operations.  It's a bit like a game of poker, really.

That way people can discuss recent events (like the Hacking Team breach and leaks), but still get decent moderation and removal of nonsense and image macros.  /r/pwned does not really suffice for this. It only covers breaches, and not really issues like NSA tech/leaks, and also doesn't have much quality control. Any breach, tiny or large, is there.

A few things we'd like to note, in specific: we've made it a point to draft and include a flowchart of our moderation process, to help our users/submitters understand what each submission goes through in terms of QA.  Further, to increase the transparency of our process, we've begun using a number of link flairs to indicate the removal reason of a submission; this was actually introduced in the recent netsecond update.  Additionally, we've added a couple more flairs to help easily distinguish meta content, submissions containing classified content (please, immediately modmail us upon discovery so we can flair the link as soon as possible), AMAs, and more.  I may have hidden one extra link flair to play with, but that's beside the point.  don't tell sanitybit  Anyways, please let us know if something can be clarified or expanded upon further - we're willing to listen to good suggestions.

The only real risk that pinning mitigates is MITM from an otherwise trusted organization/CA operating in bad faith. The risks introduced by pinning, however, can be fairly significant if you're not careful:   Pinning the CA can mean accidentally breaking your app if you switch issuers (e.g. PositiveSSL -> GeoTrust) Pinning your own cert means you can break your app just by getting a cert reissued/updated (if aren't able to reuse the same keypair)   While both risks can are manageable with some planning and knowhow, most organizations have to have their arm twisted to just use TLS at all. Those that do often fail to properly maintain their certs, contributing (I suspect) to why you see so many apps using blind trust managers. Adding yet another set of hoops that everyone has to jump through for TLS use isn't going to help adoption, though adding some OS-specific API hooks to simplify pinning might be a good middle ground.  All that said, I still have pinning enabled in my app (since it manages healthcare data) despite having an otherwise routine certificate update blow up in my face.

These lists are curated by Apple/Google/Microsoft/Samsung, etc. You can also manually add certificates to this list.  Typically when you use SSL in an app, the app will just ask the operating system if a given certificate is valid.  The problem is that as an attacker, you can install your own certificate into your device and proxy the connecting through yourself. So as far as the app is concerned, the cert is valid, but it doesn't know that it's not talking to the right place.  Pinning is where the app developer will explicitly embed their certificate into the app itself so that regardless of how compromised the device or network is, the app knows that it's talking to a safe place (except in this case where the app itself was modified to skip that check)."

So you could create a cert for reddit.com signed by (an obviously invalid) ""AddTrust External CA Root"" that you just fabricated on the spot, and use your non-CA cert (validly signed by StartSSL) in the alternate validation chain. Normally clients will reject such a cert chain because your non-CA cert declares that it cannot be used for cert signing, but since it's in an alternate validation chain, this check was being skipped.  I could be wrong though, I haven't looked that far into it, just going by the blurb on the CVE. I think creating an ""alternate chain"" is more complicated than just having a cert declare ""I can also be validated by ..."". Going by this sec.stackexchange post, alternate chains are entirely at the discretion of the client."

I figured I was the only person not using ForwardX11Trusted   Heh. I thought for quite some time that I was using untrusted forwarding and was impressed with how seamlessly it worked. The debian manpage for ssh says:   For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY extension restrictions by default.  Please refer to the ssh -Y option and the ForwardX11Trusted directive in ssh_config(5) for more information.   Only the ssh_config manpage mentions the distro default:    ForwardX11Trusted          [...]          The default is “yes” (Debian-specific).    Debian bug: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=781469  Debian has that default because of https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=237021 - in 2004, when untrusted X11 forwarding was introduced and became the default, Debian changed the default ""since it seems immature and causes far too many problems with existing setups"".  Looking around a bit, I get the impression that most people just use/recommend -X for X11 forwarding? But given that both Debian and Ubuntu have this distro default, that probably doesn't mean much.

Doing a very complicated ""diff"" on the internal and external IDS alerts, I could map our own network with better effect than launching internal discovery scans.   We were getting scanned at-least once or twice an hour, if not more, so f***-it.  Let the kiddies do our job for us... If someone was too aggressive, then I would block them.

The low-level code updating the encryption password needs to be changed to avoid it as covered in the article. The initial encryption (either during the boot if it's enabled by default or via the Security menu) doesn't require a lockscreen password and doesn't prompt for a password. The drive is encrypted with a randomly generated key and only that is encrypted with the lockscreen password/pin/pattern if one is set. If one isn't set, the drive is still encrypted with the key only protected by the hardware security features.  CyanogenMod 11 made significant changes to encryption such as completely removing the link between the passwords, but CyanogenMod 12 does not as they didn't make any significant changes to Lollipop's overhauled encryption support. Breaking the link completely would now mean losing the benefits of encryption being enabled by default."

They'd also have to take an alternate approach like this to preserve the nice properties of encryption by default. CyanogenMod starts fresh with every major Android release and splitting the passwords was one of many things that didn't make the cut for porting.  I expect that CyanogenMod would be open to merging this feature but upstreaming it into AOSP itself would be a lot better. I haven't had much luck getting Google to review/merge my patches lately though. I have a few low-level hardening changes stalled with no further response after the initial review and so far there's no response to the split encryption/lockscreen password patch. It's not a big deal from my perspective because it just means it will be on the list of CopperheadOS features instead of a list of features that have been upstreamed from it."

Zmap is generally network bandwidth limited in just about every application. If it takes 14 days it means you're trying to scan too much or you need fatter pipes in your network.  Edit: One more thing, they released an updated version around august of last year that sped up the scan rate 10x. How long ago did you try using it?  Edit2: I missed the ""VM"" statement. The VM is going to heavily limit any kind of zmap activity and ruin any kind of benefits you get from using zmap. Zmap uses linux kernel bypasses and zero copy methods to do all its network traffic management manually. Those speedups are entirely negated by using a VM because you're forcing all the traffic through the host OS's kernel. I'd suggest getting a live CD/DVD and using that for scanning."

netsec,3bq96e,InverseX,102,Wed Jul 1 08:41:27 2015 UTC,"Hi! Author of the paper here. One of the more important improvements compared to other methods is that you can inject the frames remotely and without a Wi-Fi device. As a practical example, you could upload an image to imgur (as long as the service does not compress the images; this would change the data) and send a link of the image to a victim. Downloading the image would then result in frames being injected on the network as long as the network is open and supports aggregation. In the paper I provide an example how you could do a host scan in this manner, but that's more tricky to pull off because many firewalls block egress traffic when there is no matching incoming request."
netsec,3bq96e,Natanael_L,40,Wed Jul 1 08:51:40 2015 UTC,"So let's say as an example there's a local device with remote code execution holes, maybe an unpatched printer, even if only unprivileged as long as there's network access - you're saying then that just loading a prepared image unencrypted over open WiFi would cause traffic injection that could cause code to execute on that device, entirely independently of what happened on the original client? Opening up for a remote shell into the network? My laptop wouldn't know anything happened?"
netsec,3bq96e,Natanael_L,34,Wed Jul 1 09:47:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are right; this should work. What will happen is: the AP will aggregate the image data intended for the original client (laptop). If the printer supports 802.11n it will still need to check all of these frames to see whether there are any destined for it's MAC address (or the broadcast MAC address, which worked in the cases I tested). If corruption causes the malicious inner frame to be interpreted it will be accepted by the printer and you could exploit the code execution hole. You are also correct that the laptop wouldn't know what happened for multiple reasons. One of which is that perceiving a frame as being corrupted can depend on your physical location within the network. Finally, I should note that some frames (e.g. ICMP) require the sender MAC to be set to the MAC of the AP. The attacker could look up this MAC in a database such as Wigle.net. Other frames (e.g. Beacon) will be accepted by all receivers regardless of the sender MAC. For this reason, devices which have vulnerabilities in their SSID field parsing logic are especially vulnerable to this attack. If you happen to have / know of a device with such vulnerabilities I would be interested in testing this in practice."
netsec,3bq96e,sprkyco,12,Wed Jul 1 11:50:44 2015 UTC,"Could this be exploited via for example a video stream? HTML5 ad videos, or trying to reuse a viral video? Then you'd have a larger number of packets that it could work with."

Normal people just want to get to Facebook, and don't even know that they don't know the implications of what they're doing, and wouldn't know where to begin in researching it.  Open WiFi being unencrypted is sloppy for so many reasons. The lack of an initial shared secret is obviously problematic, but it doesn't prohibit all forms of security. If you encrypt and authenticate the traffic using an exchanged session key, you can at least say that it will be difficult for an attacker to tamper with connections after they are made, even though it is possible for an attacker to jump in and hijack connections when they are first made.

netsec,3bq96e,gsuberland,7,Wed Jul 1 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"The idea is that the access point would have a long-term asymmetric key (e.g. RSA keypair) on it, generated for that particular device.  The SSID of the AP is currently just a textual identifier (e.g. ""StarbucksWifi"") but that's not to say that it couldn't be changed to include other information. Instead of a 32-byte SSID, it'd instead by a 64-byte SSID with a 32-byte user prefix (the name of the AP) and a 32-byte hash of the AP's public key as a suffix. Then, when you talk to the server, it sends over its public key and you hash it, and compare it to the SSID suffix. If it matches, happy days. If it doesn't match, reject it.  Once you've got a public key from the AP, you can then use that to exchange a secret (e.g. a session key) which can then be used to encrypt and authenticate the rest of your traffic.  Of course, this isn't perfect. There's nothing to stop someone unplugging the real AP and setting up their own AP with a ""StarbucksWifi"" prefix, using a different public key hash suffix. Your client would still just show ""StarbucksWifi"". You also can't trivially set up anything like pinning to prevent this, because there are legitimate situations where you'd want multiple devices with different long-term keys with the same name prefix, e.g. different branches of Starbucks. It also gets complicated if you want to set up a mesh network in this scheme, unless each node in the mesh is simply a dumb relay. There are also problems with generating enough entropy to produce strong long-term certificates on embedded devices, especially shortly after boot, since they are inherently deterministic machines with no real variance between individual units - this has been a consistent problem in hardware products. But, as I said at the start, it's way better than the current WiFi standard."

The downside is that you have to compute DH parameters on every new connection, and that might be expensive on embedded hardware, and could possibly be a remote DoS vector.  side note - it's cleaner to say DHE rather than EDH, because [a] it's easy to mistake ""EDH"" for ""ECDH"", and [b] you don't have to decide on whether to say ECEDH or EECDH when talking about the elliptic curve variant"

Users will receive an encrypted connection to the hotspot and will be able to access the network without logging in and out, making for a seamless roaming experience.   Another article offers little more information, other than they'll be priming people further to use anonymous USB charging stations and that they are taking it seriously:   O’Donell assured us that the network “takes into account sort of every major potential attack out there for a wireless network.” He downplayed the risk of rogue access points, saying that the LinkNYC network has been fitted with safeguards against it. “The fact of the matter is, this is not a new security threat, it’s been around for ten-plus years and it can affect any major service provider out there. We do take this seriously and we actively shut those down,” O’Donnell said.   It also mentions they're using HotSpot 2.0 (802.11u), which talks about its added discovery ""feature"" (read: metadata):  HotSpot 2.0 PDF   A significant change with 802.11u is that connectivity to multiple “home” networks can be advertised using a single SSID. For example, the “PublicHotspot” SSID could be used to advertise  that a Hotspot has the ability to automatically authenticate subscribers of a number of fixed or mobile operators.  In 802.11, clients learn about AP networks via beacons and  probe response frames. Each beacon or probe response carries  information about the AP’s capabilities in a component of the  frame called an information “element.” Naturally, the 802.11u  protocol focuses on enhancing network discovery by adding new  information elements to these frames.

The reason these exists is because data is included in-band with the commands.  This same issue is available to many multi-layered protocols where the eventual total payload does not separate the commands from the data.  In WiFi the payload data being transmitted at the physical layer is in essence delivered within the same security context as the command data.  Since it is not independent from the data that is interpreted as a command, an error in a transmission can lead to the false interpretation of that payload data as a wifi command.  Little Bobby WiFi Tables everywhere...  Speaking of little bobby tables, this made me think of the ""bit squatting"" hack  We know bit errors happen right?  We also know that SQL commands are issued in the billions (billions of billions??) every single day.  We know that most sql tools will build queries that strictly parse the data so that it cannot interfere with the commands.  INSERT INTO users (`username`, `password`) VALUES (""prozacgod"", ""#);drop table `users`;--"");   It turns out that a single bit error that could evaluate # to a double quote, end the escape string and execute the drop table..  '#', ' ', '&', '*', '2', 'b'  Those are type-able characters that could achieve this.... and is (in spirit) very similar to this wifi attack."

On the other hand, the TLS protocol is a byzantine horror of unnecessary features shoehorned in by committee just in case someone might want them someday, and OpenSSL's implementation of that whole mess is trying too hard to provide all of the specified features at the expense of complexity and code bloat.  That's your real problem, and my read was that that's what S2N is trying to fix.

Who is to say that the code you're looking at isn't turned off during compilation, when compiling for certain other targets? Just finding a file with that statement in it doesn't mean much, other than some part of the library could use openssl. And quite clearly, from the article, they say they support multiple backends.  The whole point of this library is to provide a new, replacement TLS protocol implementation (the part that keeps getting hacked in OpenSSL), using the crypto implementations (AES, SHA, etc) from the backend library of your choice.  It's just like they wrote their own SSH implementation, but allowed you to use OpenSSL, or LibreSSL, or BoringSSL, etc, for the crypto functions.

They say ""go and build your own copy of whatever you want to use as libcrypto, be it openssl, libressl, boringssl, etc. Here are the instructions to do so"".

CBC can be implemented independent of the cipher transform ... etc and so on.  Granted s2n is using a small portion of the *SSL libraries but it still means people have to support OpenSSL.

What they really need to do is that + community based individual script whitelists which would be available to use (but not enabled by default.)  You might even be able to auto-generate those lists by randomly disabling scripts and having an option to undo those random deactivations then use people's choices of when to undo those as flagging that reactivated script as relevant but to strip out everything extraneous.  Add this with some intentional curation by trusted sources as adblock lists and other such compilations are made and you'd have something around as easy to operate as noscript but a hell of a lot more secure.

Many of the highlights have already been addressed - for example, we now ship devices with Ubuntu 12.04 and keep the kernels up to date. We also have perfected the 10.04 -> 12.04 upgrade process and this can now be done on any field device.  I need to obtain permission to speak publicly about the crypto stuff.

It doesn't just allow access to the device to compromise future backups. It's everything. Compromising the device would let an attacker take down an entire business for days while off-site backups are retrieved and restored.

netsec,3bk2hg,dicknuckle,17,Tue Jun 30 12:18:18 2015 UTC,"Because in the world of embedded devices, QA moves slowly and nailing down every edge case on a new release of Ubuntu while also keeping up with new feature development is difficult to do with the limited resources you have. Even for profitable startups like us, hiring test engineers, getting the right processes in place, and developing a good sense of what to look for takes a lot of time.  Example: Ubuntu 12.04 changed the way partition devices are named in Device Mapper. If my memory serves me right, 10.04 always named it ""<volume>p<n>"" where ""<volume>"" is the base volume name and <n> is the partition number. In 12.04, they're named ""<volume><n>"" if volume ends in a letter, and ""<volume>p<n>"" if volume ends in a number. Dattos deal with tons of image files and partitions so even though the code to implement this logic was simple, finding every location in the code where it had previously been hardcoded as ""<volume>p<n>"" and changing it to call the ""generateParititionDeviceName"" function was a long task.  I'm not sure if anyone has yet begun work on porting all the Datto sauce to 14.04 LTS on local devices. I'll ask tomorrow.  Hopefully this clears up how things work.  Edit: Also, 10.04 was supported until April of this year. We transitioned away from it a year before support ended, and have now rolled out an upgrade process. I submit that while this isn't quite bleeding-edge, it shows that we do keep up with the Joneses."

It's the responsibility of binutils (ld.bfd / ld.gold) to enable RELRO and neither supports doing that by default, regardless of configuration options. Some distributions like Hardened Gentoo use patches to enable these features by default.  Partial RELRO is a consequence of lazy linking, which will probably be disabled by default in the future anyway. For now, you need to manually disable it to get the most from RELRO. Lazy linking significantly hurts performance at runtime due to the requirements it imposes on position independent code. A tiny reduction in linking time isn't as important as runtime performance.  It's not yet possible to reap the performance benefits of disabling lazy linking, but it will be:  https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2015-05/msg00225.html"

I'm not sure if it's the same as other devices using normal file systems. I'm guessing it is.  The reason you don't want to simply hook the read() is because you'd then have to perform a path traversal to check whether the file being read is the one of interest. This requires locking, cpu overhead, corner cases.  Anyway, we're basically in agreement :) the read can probably be hijacked.  One solution I'm mentally toying with is signing the hash + random input. So you open, write a random value, and the module signs this value + hash with a private key living in the kernel (loaded at runtime into the key retention service?). The reason for adding a random value into the equation is to prevent a simple replay. This means the file's value will always be unique and so adds complexity to the reader.  This moves the problem to carving the private key out of kernel memory. At least it raises the bar for in-host detection.  Just some thoughts."

netsec,3atvmb,rseuv2,30,Tue Jun 23 18:30:34 2015 UTC,It doesn't need to. It just needs to foil fully automated analysis and increase time/cost to figure out threat level and avenues of attack.

netsec,3atvmb,crashish,5,Tue Jun 23 13:50:46 2015 UTC,Does this actually crash Cuckoo? The one screenshot that shows a crash merely shows that the application itself is crashing and not the sandbox.
netsec,3atvmb,brenocunha,13,Wed Jun 24 04:22:59 2015 UTC,"Yes it does, Cuckoo's ""sandbox"" implementation (cuckoomon.dll) is injected into the application's process address space, thats why you see the application crashing."

netsec,3atvmb,brenocunha,2,Tue Jun 23 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"Technically it would be a different crash (not a bug), as anticuckoo intentionally corrupts cuckoo's code in order to crash it.

netsec,3atvmb,crashish,2,Tue Jun 23 21:46:28 2015 UTC,"Obviously different bugs can cause different crashes, and most bugs/crashes won't be intentional. As I see it, my primary question remains unanswered: what is the practical difference between this intentional crash and any other arbitrary crash that might occur during an analysis run? Again, the screenshot is unclear, but I suppose one way to answer this would be to find out if the crash log reports that the fault occurs in cuckoomon.dll or in anticuckoo.exe. I'm also curious what Cuckoo's report/error output looks for the case of an anticuckoo crash vs an arbitrary application crash."
netsec,3atvmb,brenocunha,4,Tue Jun 23 22:39:41 2015 UTC,"ok, I dont get you... what do you mean by practical difference? a crash occurs when an exception isnt properly handled. To assess the difference between two crashes you will have to debug them or analyse their crash dumps.  So how am I supposed to tell you the ""practical difference"" between the crash caused by anticuckoo and a non-existent arbitrary crash?  Maybe i got you completely wrong and this is what you want to hear:  The crash caused by anticuckoo will only happen when it executes under Cuckoo, not when it infects real people desktops.  While an arbitrary crash caused by a buggy application would occur in both scenarios.   Again, the screenshot is unclear, but I suppose one way to answer this would be to find out if the crash log reports that the fault occurs in cuckoomon.dll or in anticuckoo.exe.   By what i've read in anticuckoo readme, the crash occurs in Cuckoo's HookHandler, which is the hook call gate setup by cuckoomon.dll. I'm not sure whether HookHandler resides in cuckoomon.dll code section or is dynamically generated. But yes a quick look at the crash would tell you, unfortunately I also dont have the setup handy right now."

Put admin into the user box and put another junk SQL query into the password box, you'll get an error response like this:  You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '1'=='1 --;'' at line 1</p><p>SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = ''' OR '1'=='1 --;'   It may take a few tries or queries to get it. A lot of the time it just returned a null value:  [] So you can see they're building a query and setting the password field to   password = ' '   Format a SQL statement that always evaluates to true and keeps escapes the quotes ' '  $somecode 'somestring'   Could be escaped like this:  ' $somecode 'somestring   When input into the box it will read as:  '' $somecode 'somestring'"

This allows you to see the error message aswell at the bottom of the response.  Additionally, it makes it very easy to modify the post request.  You could also set burp to intercept the response from the server to see the response, but its a PITA to do additionally requests this way but less of a pain then examining wireshark data."

Whereas an email with targeted (industry-specific or person-specific) language is probably going to receive deeper investigation.

netsec,3aunhj,Agadius,3,Tue Jun 23 18:08:51 2015 UTC,"In general, virustotal or similar services are not opensource, which sometimes matters. If you take  the case of antiviruses for instance, you do not know how they are configured nor which options are passed during a scan. Heuristics or archive uncompression options may have been disabled to run tools as fast as possible. You can miss some suspicious files that way.  IRMA is presented as a platform but it should be seen as a framework instead. It runs analysis on multiple files and displays the analysis reports. You can extend your private instance with your  analyzers  (cuckoobox, disassemblers, etc.). As a reverser, if you feel that virustotal-like services lacks for analysis (entropy over a binary as a toy example), you can (easily?) add it."
netsec,3aunhj,_kamino_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:47:16 2015 UTC,If the threat attacking you is advanced and highly targeted they may watch for submissions to virustotal or for new malware hashes on security mailing lists. A lot of places will abort their operations or pivot into other ways of maintaining persistence once they realize they've been detected.  By not submitting this information you prolong your ability to detect and observe the behavior of the attacker.

netsec,3aoxxd,PaulSec,37,Mon Jun 22 08:53:29 2015 UTC,"Hello and thank you for sharing my blog post.  Note that 15 instances(it was really 16 because one wrote the unique password but spelled it wrong with one char, f15624b8b4abtc instead of f15624b8b4sbtc) are cases were someone has sniffed the exit traffic and then logged in with those exact credentials. This number does not seems like much and it's actually lower because some has sniffed several times(like the one in India) but what's really worth mentioning is the amount of extra traffic I got to my site.     So let's say you are visiting your website through 1000 exit nodes one time per node you should of course get 1000 unique visitors, but this is not the case. This is because the node is sniffing and then inspecting what type of site it is but does not try to login or what ever. There's a difference between active and passive sniffing.    So I do have another project coming up that will test this. Instead of POST'ing, I will only GET unique (juicy)URLs and if these get more than one hit I know which node is sniffing. The ""leak""-method will also be tested which GET's or POST's unique binaries(pdf/exe/elf) that need to be ran in order to make a connection.     Anyway, this project has made some discussion. First of all I'am not trying to shut down any exit nodes, I'am trying to warn users that Tor is a bunch of proxy-servers ran by (mostly)anonymous users and you need to be aware of the typical issues that proxy-servers have.   Secondly, this problem can be fixed on both sides - sysadmins needs to implement HTTPS on places where you GET or POST sensitive information, exit operators need to be more informed that sniffing traffic is in some cases illegal and highly immoral, Tor-users needs to understand the risks and Tor Project can start to test this method to detect malicious servers.     I've talked to phw about this and also reported some of these nodes, but be honest, why should they shut down just because I say so? This is OK and this means that we'll need to work towards another solution.   I do think these controls are important and I highly value this research. Tor has come a long way but there are still things that can be improved."

One other method I'm trying is fetching 10-15 sites over HTTP first over my standard Internet connection and then over Tor for comparing how much they differ.   Sometimes I'm also using SSH-MITM."

Now I will make it even more legit by actually putting a real PHP-script that allows a user to send money to a specific bitcoin wallet and this allows me to track the hacker even further.  I have some other thoughts but I'll see what I do.     I do not think this is nation-state govs because this attack method is way to obvious.

There is always the possibility of traffic correlation by the likes of 3 letter agencies and such (this has been detailed ad nauseum particularly after the Snowden revelations...), but within the confines of what you can reasonably expect any VPN to protect against, I've yet to come up with any improvements I'd like to see them make re: security/privacy."

If they're transparent about governmental requests, don't keep logs, and provide full encryption then I'd take that over a shady free proxy service with a questionable user agreement.  You could also trace your traffic to make sure it goes where it should go and capture traffic going to to the VPN to make sure it's encrypted before it arrives. If not even they know what you're up to then I'd say you're pretty safe. It would just be the website owner/government trying to figure out what one specific person was doing in a group of several thousands or more. The only thing they should know is that the VPNs IP contacted the site. They can send notices all day and still come up dry."
netsec,3am8zy,warproxxx,15,Sun Jun 21 19:01:12 2015 UTC,How is it possible to verify that any VPN provider actually doesn't keep logs and actually is transparent about government inquiries?  Do you have a real verifiable basis for trust or are you just leaning on the VPN provider's reputation?
netsec,3am8zy,universal_linguist,20,Sun Jun 21 20:59:38 2015 UTC,"If you haven't heard ""X VPN released information leading to DMCA notice"" or ""X VPN released information leading to a raid"" in the news, like HideMyAss, then it's safe to assume that they are not going to give up your activity at this time, even if they are logging it. As I said, it is based off their track record. If you can't trust anyone on the web to handle your data, even if it's encrypted out the ass, then you shouldn't really be on the Internet. So, yeah, my trust is leaning on the VPN provider because their entire business is on the line if they start outing people.  EDIT: If you're ultra paranoid then find a VPN that lets you sign up and pay anonymously. Even if they keep logs, if you're taking the right measures, it won't point back to anyone with concrete proof. Just some gift card that was paid for with cash. It wouldn't hold up.  EDIT2: If you're ultra ultra paranoid then wear a hood and dark sunglasses when you buy the gift card with cash.

Worst case scenario: they follow the trail back to the public place you connected from and ask questions. Maybe there's a video showing the general direction you walked away from the place. This is why you mask your identity to those around you and the cameras. The alphabet soup isn't all powerful. People have been and still do evade them all of the time. Also, in the US at least, they wouldn't even be interested in tracking you down unless they saw that you are tied to a (possible) terrorist organization, a high profile (most likely violent) drug distributor, sex slave trading, pedophilia rings, spying for another country, etc.. So unless you're checking out some truly shady places on the deep web, I wouldn't worry about being followed around by a couple dozen suits.  Other countries can definitely be a bit different, but if you follow those guidelines closely you should get by pretty much anywhere. Just choose your associates wisely, keep them to a minimum, keep your own mouth shut, and coordinate your activities in a manner that gives whoever could be out to get you less or no time to react.  If you're trying to evade a **AA notice, then having just a VPN will suffice.  edit: word"

netsec,3am8zy,everywhere_anyhow,3,Sun Jun 21 19:08:21 2015 UTC,"Ah OK, I thought you meant to say that running TAILS in a VM is more secure than running it natively, which goes against their official stance AFAIK.  Though I'm conflicted whether I'd recommend combining a VPN with Tor at all if you live in a place where you don't have to fear repercussions for using anonymizing software (etc). The benefit of introducing a fourth hop just seems really minor compared to the effort, regardless of the side the VPN is on. (Different case for high-opsec cases where you use an anonymous VPN sandwich in a public network, but people who need that kind of anonymity don't need to get their information from places like this.)"
netsec,3am8zy,andi707,3,Sun Jun 21 19:15:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely not. The most secure option is to use it how it was intended to be used.  Well, with TOR, there is always the chance that you pass through enough governmental nodes to lose your anonymity. If your traffic is encrypted due to the VPN then your anonymity stays intact because they'll have to try going through the VPN to find you which could prove very difficult for them, if you chose a good VPN, as I've said."

If you're using a public machine somewhere then just watch what data you put in the machine, send it through a (reputable) proxy, and mask your identity as much as possible to the cameras within the internet cafe/library/whatever.

Nor was I thinking about these things at any point before now within this thread. If you're going to get onto the topic of privilege then I believe talking about larger systemic issues in the world would be more prudent. The internet, after all, is not the driving force behind my privilege. Telling everyone to check their privilege is utterly pointless. Working in ways that actually promote change in these various demographics should be your focus. Not cherry picking and hoping to make people that much more class conscious. That's only going to irritate people. If you go around blaming individuals for cultural problems, it's only going to strengthen the cultural problems because you come off as hostile and part of a separate group/tribe. Or they may already be class conscious and doing whatever they can with their privilege to help those less fortunate.  My main point though is that in these areas you will be using sneakernet anyways if you're smart. No one that's working against oppressive regimes is going to be doing it out in the open on their internet. So it would be a non-issue. However, fixing the issues that make this a non-issue would make your posts make a bit more sense to me. If it's just a poor demographic without an oppressive regime then a proxy + HTTPS, and making sure you keep things not so personal, will suffice until we fix the larger systemic issues. Also it would be smart to completely avoid all servers hosted within problem countries.  If I offended you, my bad. I'm already on your side of the fence though (I assume you're a socialist/very left-wing). Just taking jabs. No need to take it that seriously.  edit: Grammar."

Stegosploit works when you click on a direct image link. In some (slightly unique) situations, a webserver can be tricked into accepting an improperly formed image.   The best example (I think) is if the image is accepted without a file extension. Some webservers will then serve that content up with a ""octet stream"" content type.   If the uploaded content hits your browser without a file extension and with an ambiguous content type, your browser will try and guess what the content is. In the case of Stegosploit, it's formatted in a way that makes your browser think it is HTML, and will then execute any scripts contained within that HTML.  The hiding of HTML in an image is pretty cool, but nothing too crazy. Browsers sniffing content poorly with ambiguous content types, also cool, but nothing mind blowing. Abusing websites that allow user uploads by uploading non-permitted content, again, cool but not crazy. When you put them together though, it's pretty sweet.

netsec,3ahwil,d4rch0n,8,Sun Jun 21 17:31:54 2015 UTC,"Side channel attacks are going to be dependent on the OS, the software, the data source, the noise, the time you have to monitor data and how much you get, what capabilities you have to trigger code paths, etc.  Check out the Hands off my laptop attack. There's a few things that they need to be able to do besides get the chassis potential   We found a way to cause GnuPG to automatically decrypt ciphertexts chosen by the attacker.   So, let's say you take a known software and version (GPG pre-patch for this attack), and you can trigger it to decrypt. At each stage in a loop it might go through one branch or another, and the sequence of CPU instructions are known and distinct.  Let's say you have a ton of other stuff going on messing with your data, like other instructions executing. Maybe if you tell it to decrypt something specific 1000 times, you might be able to denoise that data and pull out what is specifically running when it tries to decrypt that ciphertext. Much easier if you know what you're looking for too, if you know exactly which operations execute in which sequence that will tell you the code path they took, thus letting you know whether you randomly guessed the first bit of the key or something like that.  Now, keep in mind that GnuPG patched this in software to resist the attack. That shows how dependent some side channel attacks are on knowledge of the software, and it having some specific profile that leaks data.  What I'm trying to say is that it very much depends on what you're attacking and how, and other instructions running in parallel might be able to be filtered out, but it completely depends on factors like, if you know what instructions might be executing based on what you're attacking, and how much data you have and how noisy it is."

For the hands off my laptop, I think their example scenario is that you might send them an email they'll decrypt, and have some way of measuring their chassis potential when they do (through far end of ethernet, dangling USB cord, touching the laptop with your hand even). Another side-channel attack might involve sending a request to a server and measuring the response time, over and over.   And to determine what version of a specific software they have, it completely depends on the software. Maybe you could determine their openssl version through their ssh banner.  Side-channel attack is just way too vague to say what you know, what you need to know, and what you're measuring. Some implementation is leaking data somehow, and you're detecting that through any number of ways, working with whatever type of noise that attack has to work around."

A natural candidate countermeasure is to induce key-independent load on the CPU, in hope that the other computation performed in parallel will somehow mask the leakage of the decryption operation. Figure 28 demonstrates the difference in the frequency spectra of the the acoustic signature of the second modular exponentiation during our attack resulting from applying a background load comprised of an infinite loop of ADD instructions being performed in parallel. As can be seen from Figure 28, background load on the the CPU core affects the leakage frequency by moving it from the 35–38 kHz range to the range of 32–35 kHz.

Attacker sets up a MITM attack on the website (details irrelevant). Attacker uses OCSP to obtain a ""valid"" OCSP response. Certificate owner revokes the certificate. User browses to the website, gets MITM'ed. The MITM proxy sends them the cached ""valid"" OCSP response. Browser doesn't know the certificate was revoked.   Note that without OCSP stapling, in step 5 the browser would query the CA directly, and get a ""revoked"" OCSP response, and therefore know the certificate was revoked."
netsec,3afufa,immibis,13,Sat Jun 20 03:29:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, that attack is possible for as long as the stapled response is valid, which shouldn't be more than about a few hours to a day. However,   When that response expires, a new one can't be created, because the certificate is revoked. If you have a cached OCSP response that's still valid, and the server is not using stapling, the attacker can MITM the conversation between the client and the CA and respond with the cached response. Stapling does not make this any different. If you don't have a cached OCSP response, and you're not using stapling, you can MITM the conversation between the client and the CA and not respond at all, as if the CA were down. Every browser responds to this by failing open, because nobody trusts the CAs to run a 100% reliable OCSP responder. So if you merely MITM the response and don't say anything, the cert is presumed valid. If browsers failed closed, then every website would be constrained to have no more uptime than their CA's OCSP responder, which server admins of large sites would not accept.   Since a stapled response only needs to have been retrieved once in the last validity period (hours to maybe days), and presumably the CAs can run OCSP responders that don't have downtime lasting for hours, this operational concern isn't present with OCSP stapling. Cryptographically, stapling and not-stapling are equivalent, but in practice, stapling helps OCSP get deployed, which is better than OCSP not getting deployed.  The mustStaple extension takes advantage of this operational willingness to use OCSP, by putting a marking in the certificate saying that an OCSP response must be stapled to the certificate for it to be considered valid."

I think it is basically a slightly overengineered technical solution to the political problem that CAs want to charge for certificate renewals, but if you specify this OCSP stapling thing that is totally not a certificate we promise, the CA engineers' bosses don't ask them why they're signing certs for free.  To be fair, the OCSP key can only sign statements that an existing, valid certificate is in fact valid. The CA private key can be used for either renewing existing certs or signing new ones, so it's quite a bit more risky to hook up actual renewals to an automated system. But if the OCSP responder goes rogue, the worst it can do is revert back to the pre-OCSP state of things, by sending a positive OCSP response for everyone: it can't start attesting completely new certificates.  So I can see a bit of a cryptographic argument for OCSP, and a bit of a financial argument for recouping the costs of CA signatures (which need to be handled with care) but not OCSP signatures (which don't need as much care)."

This is wrong, there are infact delta CRLs used for years - it just depends on trustcenter/authorities to use them.  Also the largest CRL i have known 3 years ago was just shy of 200MB - it is not an issue to download it nowadays (ok it would be impractical for clients todo so, but for this reason you have meta OCSP server who simply do the job for you and you can ask them via OCSP whats up) - but it is impracticable to go through each record again and update your local records. For example having a java server processing these CRLs was a huge pain in the ass because the memory required to read these CRLs was exponential.  The second issue with ""cached OCSP"" is - depending on the trustcenter - all OCSP are already cached for a while - i have worked and implemented different providers and not all of them would update their result in real time when i revoke a certificate. All in all it is still much better than the usual 1-3 days it takes for a CRL to be published from a trustcenter with updated results."

netsec,3a15x6,_rs,3,Tue Jun 16 12:32:13 2015 UTC,Amazing.  But can you tell me are web browsers potentially more vulnerable as they are more complex. I mean is it possible that for example midori or rekonq are potentially less buggy than firefox or chromium?
netsec,3a15x6,P-e-t-a-r,4,Tue Jun 16 14:08:51 2015 UTC,"Browsers like Midori have less attack surface, but they also lack sandboxing and sophisticated exploit mitigation features. They do have most of the attack surface anyway, because they're almost all based on Blink, WebKit or Gecko and have nearly all of the features. There's probably lower hanging fruit in the much more niche libraries they tend to use too. The GNOME platform libraries aren't exactly well-maintained, and that's what stuff like WebGL is sitting on top of. Chromium has a lot of auditing, fuzzing and hardening work applied to it.  For example, Chrome on Android has a couple features that aren't in lighter WebView-based browsers, but the WebView is based on Chromium anyway and those browsers don't do any sandboxing like Chrome. The main difference is just the UI and services like profile synchronization that aren't significant relative to the enormous attack surface elsewhere."

netsec,39x6yo,Travlow,12,Mon Jun 15 16:47:49 2015 UTC,Not really.

This is defeating the inspection after the decryption.

netsec,39x6yo,snail_tongs,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:47:42 2015 UTC,"Good point.  However, errors resulting in a failure to decrypt the traffic would throw up a ton of reg flags. The goal as an attacker is to hide your activity within normal traffic. Deviating from what is normal is a sure fire way to get yourself caught. I wouldn't expect to see encrypted traffic hitting my sensor after it's passed through my MITM. That shouldn't be hard to spot at all and would surely warrant some investigation.   Looking at the entropy of a packet's contents, conducting vowel analysis, or developing something using Zipf's Law to try and determine if the data resembles English language would do. We already use Zipf's Law in some tools looking for randomly generated domains in malware traffic.   IMO, it would be easier to try and defeat an IDS signature looking for a meterp session than trying to defeat the decryption itself."

SSL meterpreter traffic will be decrypted, but PA is unable to identify what kind of application data because of the XOR'ing. So traffic will be identified as ""Unknown-TCP"", which should be blocked by a well tuned firewall.  Edit:  Good way to avoid SSL inspection is making PA believe your traffic is Healthcare or Finance related. In most countries you are not allowed to decrypt that kind of traffic. *cough: https://urlfiltering.paloaltonetworks.com/testasite.aspx"

netsec,39swuj,Cozy_Conditioning,5,Sun Jun 14 18:54:37 2015 UTC,"Let me try to explain this again.  The OS (or OS integrated key store) uses your password, via a key generation algorithm to encrypt a key that is the master key of your key ring.  The OS or key store then loads that master key when you login.  The OS or key store, provides an API that allows programs like Chromium to save sensitive data like credit card numbers, passwords, etc.  In saving those items, your master key is used to encrypt them.  Typically the storage is also partitioned on a per application basis, so if you have /usr/bin/chromium that is saving the data, you'd want /usr/bin/chromium to be the only program which could retrieve the data.  You can also use code signing to make this more secure, tying the signature of the program to the storage.  When the user logs out, the master key is vacated from memory obviously.  Thus, the password to access the saved sensitive info is simply your login password, and your sensitive information is encrypted in such a way that only your user logged in can access the information.  When you login to your user account, you are logging into your key store.  This is terribly common.  It's used on Windows, OSX, and more recently Linux.  It's a tried and tested security model for storing sensitive information such that you don't have to ""login"" to individual programs, nor do you have to encrypt your home directory.  Which if you're familiar with encrypted home directories, they work on the same principal.  The key used to encrypt your home directory is protected by a key derived from your password.  This simply encrypts sensitive information like logins and credit card info without taking the performance hit of encrypting your entire home directory, and with the added bonus of potentially partitioning storage between apps so that every binary you run doesn't have access to your encrypted home directory (as plain text since you're logged in).  Please, please, Google this.  Learn about it.  Stop getting salty and start learning.  You can start by following OP's link and then clicking on the other implementations and then Googling those platform specific APIs.  The only reason I bothered responding to this whole thread was to avoid disinformation like what you posted in your original comment from being spread.  If you look at their Windows implementation, here's the function it uses.  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380261(v=vs.85).aspx  ""Typically, only a user with logon credentials that match those of the user who encrypted the data can decrypt the data. In addition, decryption usually can only be done on the computer where the data was encrypted""  So one of their additional points is simply that it combines a system level key with your user credentials key, making it doubly hard to simply export and decrypt the data without having both root/admin and the per user credential."

For example, you see a regular user logging into another user's machine with different credentials with wmic(even worse, a privileged account)That is highly suspicious. Normal remote logins are usually handed by lsass. More importantly, why would john.doe be logging in a remote machine using jane.doe's creds?  The only caveats are that you know what is using wmic and who should be logging into what. Also, you need to be actually looking at security audit logs with something like Splunk. AV nor HIPS won't catch shit. Not out of the box like most companies have.  It's fun seeing the shift from custom malware for stuff like recon and lateral movement to built in benign windows tools like wmi and powershell. Hell, even older methods like bitsadmin downloads and malicious lnk files are coming back. Everyone is busy looking for zero days and advanced malware, they're not noticing.

Using PGP you'd again have to worry about scale, generating new key pairs for every victim so as not to compromise the entire operation.

Over time you can make easily over $200,000 per year.   Currently we're in a CNO bubble. The pay scales are pretty insane, especially for CND guys. I think the CND bubble will pop in the next 5 - 8 years and the salaries will line up more with a typical sysadmin, but for a good developer on the CNE/CNA side of the house who has certain tags on their SCI, the pay (especially on the contractor side) will probably be a 6 figure minimum in the next 5 - 8 years.  The allure of the work is pretty strong too. You get to play with technologies that are pretty cutting edge, and tackle hard problems. Your code isn't just an academic exercise, but actually gets used in a real world setting that has real consequences and does some good for the benefit of your country.

netsec,399tlw,dream_in_code,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:54:51 2015 UTC,I think you may be missing the point. It's not md5 hashing the file and then sha1 hashing the md5 hash. Two separate hashes would be produced which would be compared independently of each other.
netsec,399tlw,badsingularity,3,Wed Jun 10 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"And if the resulting number of bits is shorter than the number of bits which would be produced by a single solid hashing algorithm, the chances of collision are greater. Simple statistics."

netsec,399tlw,Douglas77,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:01:05 2015 UTC,"Obviously you would need to compare both.  Every file would have both a SHA1 and an MD5sum documented.  If you manage to make an MD5 collision, it's going to be useless unless you can also get the same SHA1 collision."

netsec,39c0m2,ryley7,2,Wed Jun 10 19:14:09 2015 UTC,"The rationaile behind this is following.  ince the days of Orange Book in 80's three rules have been golden in IT security: authorize, audit all information usage, and never let uncontrollably the information out of the secure domain. Implementing properly access management, watching users, and limiting the tools works still nowadays when implemented correctly.   The leaks of the past a few years each one of the previous failed. The users had baffling access to the information, there were oversights in auditing, and it was somewhat easy to move the information mass out of the secured domain. Leaking was downright easy, and getting caught was not certain.  I took recently a look at different products meant for file access auditing, to solve the part ""audit all information usage"" in cases where the information systems can not be adapted (COTS). There seems to be a surprisingly large amount of products with different feature sets and value propositions. Some of which have pretty steep prices and highly evolved features.   I got the inspiration to develop my own very simple tool, just for learning new skills and for the heck of it. A few hours of wading through MSDN, nerve wrecking C/C++ programming, tuning and it's ready. Quality is a bit so-so (there might be at least memory leaks, although I attempted to catch them) and I had no accurate specifications, but here it is!  With this application all file accesses (creation of low level handles) cause an event that is logged at centralized log management system. I did not implement hashing the files or gathering them, because it probably has a direct impact on the performance of a desktop, but it would be trivial to add as a feature.  After the information is in the centralized log management system, it is relatively easy to generate for instance weekly report of all the file accesses of users. In AD environments one could fetch information about managers, push the data through a good PDF template, and email the reports. As outcome the managers would get weekly reports of what their underlings have accessed.   When the awareness of the previous would spread, that would raise the bar to even attempt anything in the higher security environments. The impact on the overall security in the long rould would be more significant than the actual technical feature. The information security tools work best when they have a psychological impact. Absurd but true. It's not always the best to crank some technical bolt all the way.  On the other hand, some privacy should be guaranteed to the users by limiting the tool. At least in lower security environments this might come across, because employees probably nowadays have limited rights to use employer's computers for their own matters, for instance accessing banking services while on lunch break.  I would appreciate comments, code review, bug and feature reports, etc!"

netsec,395nsu,tripmi,6,Wed Jun 10 07:41:39 2015 UTC,"Why does being a member of /r/whitehats have any sway over whether or not we're good moderators, or even if we're experienced in security? I've found bugs in software from all sorts of vendors, yet I'm supposed to feel bad for not finding bugs in Reddit specifically? Seriously?  To address your actual point, and not your edit: we basically try to keep the quality as high as possible, and mainly focus on major security issues, academic-level security, and useful tools. That's not an exhaustive list, of course, and we assess things on a case-by-case basis. But we have 130k+ subscribers averaging a few hundred active at any moment in time, so we rely upon the automoderator and other quick-fire tools to help us out. This doesn't always work out 100%, but it's better than letting everything through (right now we have about a 60:20 ratio of bad to good submissions per week - can you imagine that kind of noise getting through?). Even more annoying is that the bad ones that do slip through the net usually get upvoted like crazy due to all the hyperbole and clickbait involved, so we look like dicks when we notice and delete it. While upvotes are a good indicator of popularity, they're not always a good indicator of quality.  Articles which paraphrase the actual research, especially from sites like The Register and other populist news sources, are usually automoderated and removed because they're non-technical (content guideline: Always link to the original source). This is a basic guideline that's easy to follow and keeps the content good here. The hyperbole and exaggerations that media outlets tend to apply to research is not constructive, and we frown upon it - link to the actual research and let people make their own informed decision as to the impact, rather than saying ""New iOS Bug Lets Hackers Steal Your Children!"" (content guideline: Titles should provide context). We get a lot of these kinds of posts (see Katana's comment below) and we usually just nuke them with prejudice because it's an effective solution that doesn't take up a lot of time.  YouTube videos usually have very little technical content, and just act as ""proof"" of a bug without actually explaining the bug, which isn't the kind of content we want to promote here (content guideline: Content should focus on the ""how.""). Sure, if the video is some kind of tutorial series, then that's probably ok here, but then we've also had cases where posts were very thinly veiled marketing campaigns which we had to take action on. We've also had other cases where the content has been borderline appropriate for here, but the comments within the thread have just been unmanageably noisy, so the thread got deleted. This obviously isn't ideal, but at the end of the day we've got limited time and resources to put into moderation (which is volunteered, I might remind you) and spending it all on one already borderline-relevant thread is a waste.  As far as /u/chiniwini's post goes, I can't find it in the archives, but the exact same link was posted 7 months ago (edit: turns out his post came 2 days after that one, so it was deleted as a duplicate). Keep in mind that automoderator is literally automatic, with the intent that we can manually judge it after the fact - it's just a filter based on some rough heuristics. I imagine the reason is that slideshare is usually greylisted, due to getting lots of bad content from there in the past. I don't know the details as to why it was removed in this case (it looks ok to me) - maybe it just slipped through the net after it got canned by automoderator, and none of us remembered to approve it. We're only human. Maybe the title was bad. I don't know.  Hopefully this explains our moderation process a little better. As I noted before, this isn't exhaustive and often things are complicated, but if you have a specific complaint about a post that was deleted then bring it up with us either by modmail or in #r_netsec on Freenode and we can discuss it. We're usually blunt in our responses, because we're busy and have other things to do, but we're (mostly ;)) not assholes."

Still, I think my point stands about them using EMET to collect data on what kinds of operations trigger various anti-exploitation heuristics."
netsec,394qla,gsuberland,3,Tue Jun 9 20:16:14 2015 UTC,This should help improve the coverage of tools like IDA since I assume the entry point of all functions will be marked in the CFGBitmap. There's a bit of overhead introduced to virtual function calls though and it sounds like the CFGBitmap could be fairly large with potential for a lot of cache misses on virtual function calls?  This will still have issues on software with JIT though? What's the workaround.. ROP using full functions (VirtualProtect followed by memset?) that fill the bitmap with 1's or cause the JIT engine to generate gadgets for you?
netsec,394qla,blackhaze,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:26:05 2015 UTC,"If the target function generated is dynamic (similar to JIT technology), the CFG implement doesn’t protect it. This is because NtAllocVirtualMemory will set all “1” in CFGBitmap for allocated executable virtual memory space (described in 4.c.i). It’s possible that customizing the CFGBitmap via MiCfgMarkValidEntries can address this issue.   From the full paper linked by /u/gsuberland here. So you're basically right. When NtAllocVirtualMemory is called, it sets all bits to ""1"" unless SEC_WRITECOMBINE is present on the virtual memory space, in which case the bits are set to ""0"". In the latter case, MiProtectVirtualMemory can be called to change a range of virtual memory to executable (if I read it correctly)."
netsec,394qla,aksfjh,2,Tue Jun 9 16:33:58 2015 UTC,"The paper doesn't mention it, but there is actually a Win32 API (SetProcessValidCallTargets) that maps to the NtSetInformationVirtualMemory call they mention.

netsec,394qla,robertito42,2,Wed Jun 10 13:28:28 2015 UTC,"It's an implementation of control flow integrity for indirect calls (function pointers including those in virtual function tables). It prevents some forms of flow control hijacking to an extent. This is a similar LLVM feature, although it's not as mature and featureful:  http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html  EMET can't do anything like this because it doesn't have the necessary information from the source. It can only implement some runtime exploit mitigations, not ones that require extensive static analysis."

We've been running malware from VirusShare through it, and we haven't seen any of these packers yet. We've stuck with about 500 samples, mostly using proprietary packers and different versions of UPX, and we've been busy refining the tool to work in as many cases as we can. With the dataset, we've hit about 91% where we're able to unpack some form of code or data, about 85% of which have full PE headers in-tact, but this narrow set has left us blind to any packers that are outside of it.

netsec,38wl43,thinkst,78,Sun Jun 7 13:14:10 2015 UTC,"From your research paper:   As an aside, although Reddit tried hard to prevent users from seeing the actual vote scores of a post, we were able to discover a method of divining a story’s score. We were able to create an oracle out of the user preference that sets the users score threshold (posts below the threshold are not visible). By repeatedly changing this threshold, we can determine whether a post’s score was above or below a certain number and were able to narrow this down to an exact score.   That's an interesting technique and one I hadn't considered.  I'm not sure how to defend against that except perhaps making that threshold fuzzy in the same way that the actual scores are?"
netsec,38wl43,kim_jong_com,26,Sun Jun 7 18:28:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, just seems like an oversight in not fuzzing that value as well. I don't think it would be that hard to patch.

netsec,38wl43,catcradle5,15,Sun Jun 7 21:52:57 2015 UTC,"Does not sound trivial to me. If we fuzz it too much, we lose utility (scores don't matter at all). If we randomize fuzzing too often (per view, per vote, per reply etc., or some combination), it might be possible to get a hundred sample and get a good mean estimate. If we don't randomize fuzzing too often, (publicly visible) score+fuzz becomes the actual number people are interested in anyway, and nobody cares about de-noising it. So ... dunno. I'd like to know what others think."

You might not be able to tell what's exactly happening, but it would look different from a regular post.   In addition to sockpuppetry, being able to see where the traffic for a particular submission was coming from would/could help identify vote rings & vote manipulation. If I'm a mod for /r/worldnews and I'm seeing a submission about Tibet receiving a disproportionate amount of referral traffic from some Chinese website, I can head on over to that website and see if the traffic is genuine or of they're over there telling people to brigade the hell out of the post."

If you want to stop story manipulation then get rid of mods and provide redditors with rankings of most downvoted stories, most zeroed stories  and other rankings that would bring back transparency to reddit. Also bring back real total vote counts on stories.

You can have local or network storage attached to a Plex server. And if you do have media on a network share you still have to know how to mount that media in the OS of your choosing that Plex is running on."
netsec,38s7o0,PBI325,3,Sun Jun 7 03:01:29 2015 UTC,"Those features are nice, but I don't need any of them. I have a decent TV, but my phone has the nicest display of anything I own. It's higher resolution (ignoring the subpixel pattern here) than my source content even and AMOLED gives such nice blacks. Transcoding my untouched BD remuxes defeats the point of me making such rips in the first place.   I also don't need to transcoded, even to stream said BD rips to my original RPi. That's by far and away my most underpowered device yet it handles high bitrate h264 just fine.  Remote streaming as in streaming across the internet? Because I'll go back to the bitrate of my media. My internet isn't going to handle that, and I don't like quality loss (or I'd have reencoded them in the first place). That sounds cool though.   Playback tracking across clients works with Kodi if you have Kodi act as a server (much like Plex). I've never bothered because I haven't cared much. I rewatch shit all the time, so I'm not bothered by what I have and haven't watched. I just watch what I want to watch instead.   Client support. Hmm. I guess Plex has Chromecast, but Kodi has RPi. Both are the same price. I'll call it a toss-up since I own both.   As for the network setup, I meant that, to my understanding, Plex handles the connections between your Plex server and your Plex clients, yes? I believe you can actually do this with Kodi as well actually, but I doubt it's as intuitive. But that's just from my impression of Plex without having ever used it. See, for my Kodi applications, I just point to a bunch of Windows shares on my network for media whereas with Plex, you could just throw Plex server on the same machine that has all your media and let the clients and server figure out where they are on the network. Samba is admittedly not the most robust or user friendly protocol in the world, so I can understand the appeal of avoiding it if you don't want to deal with setting up proper network sharing."

The main feature of plex is indeed streaming over the internet, without that I'd say it is pretty similar to other apps. I haven't used XBMC in a while but adding data is pretty much the same, you select the folders you want to share and select the category. For streaming you can login to the plex.tv site which finds your server IP automatically or you can set a static server IP to look for. I forget the XBMC setup but since you are just using it on the lan they are all pretty much identical (point client at IP of server).

Only the source of PHT looks ""itchy"". I always thought, Plex was mainly PHT. I abstracted that to PMS running on some form of XBMC like fork - where I believed XBMC was pretty bad at how it stored media information in its database. A dedicated server that can run Plex with 2TB storage costs ~ 15 bucks a month. Once you get a dedicated server, people send all shit kinds of packages towards you. You start locking down your server very quickly, as you are worried. Doing, what Plex does on my own (with my own MySQL server etc), quickly turns into a no-go to do on my own, without a tunnel. It was annoying, upgrading a media file and the likes. It would mess around with watched status and the likes. A seamless UX accross its UI's. The magic triple horizontal bar, play and shuffle buttons that are virtually everywhere (they have to extend that a bit further) and are simply missing in XBMC. Unlike many tools that are lacking a queue button (i.e. the iOS music player), Plex embraces queuing songs and has 2 methods of doing that. TvTunes just works. It did not on XBMC for me (it crashed XBMC over and over again with a low probability). This one is very puzzling, as I believe Plex uses TvTunes themselves. I legally get thousands of music videos that are seamlessly integrated into my library without my doing anything. I always thought the Plex Web App was something like the XBMC Web UI. It is not. It is the heart of Plex. You do everything from there and its UI is also close to perfection. You have to completely swap over to Plex to start appreciating the Web App. Phoning your dad and giving him a user name and password... It was pretty nice. Plex replaced iTunes and Windows entirely for me (not kidding).   I will always remain an XBMC advocate. There will always be many, many reasons to run XBMC. One thing, though, Plex is not a simplified version of XBMC. They serve very different purposes, goals and user bases. I would even say XBMC is the easy one. It is the thing my dad can use (unlike Plex). I would have to set up Plex for him, whereas with XBMC, he can go on Videos and play his video files.  There will always be some functionality like karaoke, 3d support or that random add-on that allows you to do X that can make Plex halt. XBMC performance (both video and UI) is better than Plex Home Theater performance. With the UI it is day and night."

Plex can be preferable as an app on multiple devices if you like the extra features (like mobile synchronization or exposing your local content to the public).  In the end, there is hardly anything that you can do with Plex, that you cannot do with Kodi (except for the automatically added music videos and film extras). However, exposing Kodi securely to the public (if that is what you wish to do) is not fool proof.  More so, maybe you want your dad to share the content.  In essence, the main reason to use Plex is transcoding (particularly audio as DTS is not licensed on mobile devices). But yeah, you can install them, point them to the same directories and have watched status synchronized via trakt or similar.  Whenever you want to try Plex, you can fire it up and test it.  If you prefer the Kodi UI over Plex's (which I did), then you might want to wait until the day comes, where you share things with your brother or you want to transcode stuff or prepare stuff to watch on the train.  But after I got used to Plex's UI, I started to prefer it. Skinning is a big reason, why Kodi could be preferred on your main HTPC, though."

You approve some certs and those are assumed to be trusted.  The root certs that you trust have a corresponding private key held (hopefully) securely by the Root CA.  Any certs signed by that private key for any domain will be trusted automatically by your system.  They can also issue intermediate signing certs that are just as trusted by your system as the Root CA.  The problem is that they can't issue an intermediate signing cert that only works for your domain.  If they could, you could pay for a cert for your domain and sign for each machine on your own (delegate signing for a limited number of subdomains).  Without name constraints being enforced, if they did this you could issue valid certs for microsoft.com or any domain.    I have no idea why they fell short here."

The ciphers used for TLS or encryption in HTTPS in general are not that very same private key?   sign for each machine on your own   Each machine would be the hosts that you want certified, I suppose.  Those were those details. I take you for your word when you wrote    just as trusted by your system as the Root CA   So I assume those certificates are only trusted by your system, not by any public system."

netsec,389ydn,Bergur,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:25:50 2015 UTC,"Concerning SSL/TLS, why does it matter that the key-pair has been vetted for? During the initial handshake only public keys are exchanged correct? I just don't see the point in introducing a third party.  edit: A quick google tells me that a CA only exists to vouch for the server identity. What other options are there if you don't trust the CA?"
netsec,389ydn,csirac2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:46:25 2015 UTC,"Thinking of SSH, it supports configuration of certificate/CA trust much like (but separate to) HTTPS CA infrastructure. Out-of-the-box though, you have the option of manually verifying fingerprints over a separate channel of your choice (out-of-band), or just blindly accept the fingerprint of your first connection (in which case you'll get warnings if it ever changes).  There's two issues CAs try to solve though. There's the source of truth in terms of server identity (""this cert is really a real cert for this domain"") and trustworthyness (""this cert is signed for people who really are who they say they are""). The current CA business model means that second part is completely broken, except perhaps EV certs from reputable CAs (but how often are you given a choice on which CAs you trust?)...  CAs are terrible, but nothing has jumped out to replace them. DANE was invented (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities) but it took an eternity and apparently has flaws rendering the effort which would go into its adoption questionable (http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/01/15/against-dnssec/). I had some vague optimism that something blockchain-derived, like namecoin would become a credible alternative...  https://namecoin.info/  https://okturtles.com/  ... but progress is slow, and doesn't solve trustworthyness at all: http://www.indolering.com/okturtles-dnschain-unblock-us  Perhaps a rating/reputation thing could become involved. Search engines actually kinda do this indirectly for us a little bit already through result rankings, but such things are constantly being gamed.  You could say that fundamentally, passively consuming CA trust is a real problem. But this is the only option for 99.9999% of people. Even if you did care, there's barely any visibility into which CAs your operating system, browser or application stack are actually trusting, even amongst developers. There's never been a nice way to curate which root CAs for example you've been using (and perhaps cull the list based on the fact you've never hit any sites using certain CAs), although I have been impressed with Windows Server's (admittedly basic!) cert UI on the rare occasions I do windows. But that's just for server admins.... the only thing that seems to scale is blindly and passively consuming all those CAs. It's bizarre that we should think of (nearly) all of the thousands of CAs as equally trustworthy other than the ones browser vendors eventually get around to blacklisting.  Another tangent is people playing with turning cert fingerprints into ascii art over the years. You'll notice ssh-keygen and pgp as well can show you ascii art versions of your pubkey. The idea is perhaps that by making the fingerprint a visual artwork, if you see it regularly perhaps you'll spot when it changes... but that won't scale to more than a tiny fraction of internet users.  Edit: another often overlooked function of CAs is Certifiate Revocation Lists. This function really got a workout when Heartbleed hit; but CRL checking continues to be a source of bugs and, ironically, vulnerabilities in modern software."

When asked how they could afford it, they said they were raising VC money or something and told people to stay tuned for a premium paid service soon.  Being a free, fast and ""too good to be true"" service for more than a year (or two), they gathered a massive amount of users. Now they are trying to monetize them by providing a paid option that gives them more country exit points and possibly priority bandwidth.

The exact relevant texts from their FAQ (before they changed it after the 8chan drama):   Hola is a collaborative internet -- it works by sharing the idle resources of its users for the benefit of all.  Hola removes these bottlenecks by securely caching content on peers as they view it, and later serving it up to other nearby peers as they need it.  Hola is a network of peers that help each other to access sites, thereby eliminating the need for servers, and thus operating without costs.   Observations:   Only very loose mention of the ""peer to peer"" aspect. Focus is on the purported benefits, not the drawbacks. No explicit mention of you sending/receiving requests on behalf of others (something that isn't obvious to the average user, as ""peer to peer"" to them means just communicating with peers, not for peers). No explanation of the legal risks associated with the above.   So yeah, they've gone far enough to say ""well, technically we told the users in the FAQ"", but that's about it. Indeed, almost none of their users appeared to be aware of them being used as an exit node."

From memory, both Transmission and qBittorrent (though not 100% sure on the latter, but I've certainly seen it in more than one client).  But even if they didn't - torrent technology is generally understood, and it is understood by most users that you're also uploading. Back when this wasn't the case, magazines and websites generally included a warning.  Whereas Hola is completely unfamiliar technology to many, and indeed most users don't seem to have a clue what the implications are. Hola doesn't make any real attempt to explain it, either.  Additionally, torrents have only ever caused you to upload the things you downloaded; ie. you have always had control over what exactly you're uploading. With Hola, that isn't the case - it could be making any kind of request to anywhere, and you have absolutely no control over it.   But I don't really understand the label of ""vulnerability"".   The vulnerability label doesn't really apply to the 'exit node' problem - rather to the tracking IDs, and the various RCEs. It's just that they all happen to be together on one page :)"

It will break just because you decided it wasn't worth for the poc not to break it :P   No, not quite. The PoC works by abusing the ""start VLC"" command in combination with the ""move file"" command. So you have to overwrite the VLC binary, because:   If you don't do so, you can only start VLC, and not 7za (because it's at a different path) If you try to 'move away' VLC first, both the 'start' and 'move' calls are completely disabled, because vlc.exe is no longer there.    Ps: did you write the poc ? I'm confused with the compressing / decompressing of cmd.exe. What's the point ?   I didn't write it, but the compressing/decompressing is basically a very roundabout way to 'copy a file', as there's no native 'copy' method offered by the Hola API. Moving cmd.exe would be likely to break core Windows functionality, and that's probably not what you want :)   Edit: I've seen people think they were safe because the exploit didn't work for them.

netsec,37rit3,SpiderFudge,34,Sat May 30 00:37:31 2015 UTC,The problem with turning to P2P for anonymity is that instead of hiding your own (probably legitimate) traffic is that your computer relays (potentially illegal) traffic for other people. It is basically the same as letting strangers use your WIFI but on a global scale. Don't be surprised if police bust in your house with a search warrant for child pornography. At least with TOR you can decide not to be an exit node and still preserve your anonymity. However many popular sites are blocking the published TOR exit node addresses and researchers have found a ways to de-anonymize TOR traffic making P2P not so great for anonymity. https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-16/dc16-presentations/defcon-16-evans-grothoff.pdf

netsec,37rit3,Centime,2,Sat May 30 13:54:15 2015 UTC,CORS policy won't fix it. Their loose CORS policy only makes it incredibly easy to exploit. The problem is the browser same origin policy only really protects cookies it doesn't help to preserve IP based authentication. You can use DNS rebinding to subvert the browsers same origin policy when there is IP restrictions. So you create a server that listens on 6864 with a domain like random.attacker.com and a small DNS TTL then after you serve the page you change the DNS for random.attacker.com to point to 127.0.0.1. Then when the browsers makes ajax requests it will start to send them to 127.0.0.1 instead of your ip address but the ajax requests will be completely legal because they are going to the same domain.

It only works because it isn't widely enough deployed that improving the spam software is cost effective. If enough people end up using it, it will stop working.  RBLs are part of the industry standard solution, but so is SA, and a whole bunch of other stuff. Machines get added to RBLs because they send spam, that means that they will always have a delay and rely on some method of detecting what is spam and what isn't.  It's possible to build a decent system at the moment using just RBLs and greylisting, but there are fundamental limitations in how good they can be, SA doesn't have those limitations because it can perform arbitrary checks. If you want to design a mail system that is guaranteed to be able to deal with spam in the future, it needs something like SA."

netsec,37ko5v,ivosaurus,18,Thu May 28 16:57:04 2015 UTC,"Crypto-ransomware constructed using best security practices will use asymmetric (aka public-key) cryptography, in a way that the victim machine will never see the private key. (For instance, they could request a new key from a C&C server, and receive only the public portion, which is all that's needed to encrypt. Then, if the authors feel like honoring the ransom, they can send down the private key in response to a Bitcoin transaction.)  In practical pubkey solutions the (slow!!!) asymmetric component is used to protect a randomly generated symmetric key for each file. If you knew a priori that the malware would be running you could try to pull the symmetric keys out of RAM as they're being generated. This would be a lot of key material to store depending on how many files you have on your filesystem, and makes the sketchy assumption that you're aware that the malware will be deployed and do its thing - which will not be true for ~100% of users. (Also, if you had this kind of capability, why wouldn't you simply not let the malware run in the first place?)

netsec,37mcu3,william_knows,3,Thu May 28 17:59:26 2015 UTC,"On a slightly related note, has any US only (not large multinationals like Cisco or Verizon) organization ever become CREST certified? if so, mind sharing how? Is it even possible? (I think I previously read CHECK requires employees to be UK citizens for at least 5 yrs, which makes that one pretty clear)  The downside to the current UK CREST/CHECK approach is for companies with UK roots or clients (who have trickle down requirements like ""providers of my provider must be ___ certified"") CREST and CHECK act as protectionist policies or at least a filter against foreign small/medium businesses. Limiting competition like this doesn't align well with the stated goal of raising the bar on test excellence overall."
netsec,37mcu3,bNimblebQuick,3,Thu May 28 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"/One of the authors.  As far as I'm aware, there aren't any US-only companies. However, one thing of note is that they are primarily focused on the UK and Australia, and that each appears to be treated separately rather than as a unified whole, with respect to who qualifies as a CREST member company (if you look on the respective websites there's different lists of companies).  CHECK is UK only, as it's focused on providing pentests to public sector bodies.  Protectionism was a common criticism from some non-CREST (and even some CREST) companies during the study for the reason you stated and others; however, equally there's a clear benefit of having such organisational certification for clients, and there's evidence it is driving professionalism.  In the situation you describe, an argument could be made that the key to resolving this lies with the clients themselves, and their perception of industry offerings.  There's too much variation, and too much ambiguity in what service is going to be delivered.  Even if these issues still remain within the CHECK and CREST schemes, this status does provide an easy, and one of the only, baseline requirements for clients to set to give them some assurance about service offerings."

netsec,37mcu3,NAntill,1 point,Thu May 28 20:09:39 2015 UTC,"Not a problem. Happy to answer any questions.  In my opinion, the issue you describe is the unfortunate side effect of a much bigger issue.  The one of service models.  The requirement for CREST/CHECK is just symptomatic of this.  It can of course contribute to the problem - the issue you highlight about membership leading to a loss of drivers for improvement was evidenced throughout the study.  Clients were still unhappy with the consistency of CREST/CHECK offerings, but it does give them ""something"" in the form of assurance.  In effect, it is no different to any other industry.  Potential clients may specify certain organisational requirements as it's too difficult and risky to verify competence in any other way.  ISO 9001 and ISO/IEC 27001 are classic examples of this.  For penetration testing, the unfortunate situation is that currently there aren't really any other organisational ""standards"" (consortia/private in this case) for organisations to do this outside of those  In an industry where both providers and clients are unhappy with what is being offered as services, it is easy to understand why clients will cling to and demand the one rung of assurance that they can.  Naturally, this doesn't mean they're better than all of the non-members.  There may be many companies providing superior services, but for a client, there's just less risk involved this way, unless a provider has made a name for itself another way.  As I say, however, the problem stems from the industry's failing to provide consistency in offerings.  Until clients feel confident about the quality of services they're offering, this will be increasingly common."
netsec,37mcu3,cybergibbons,1 point,Thu May 28 21:28:51 2015 UTC,"I was actually very wary of the report based on the title, but it was a really interesting and unbiased study. A lot of this also extends to consulting in general; client's don't know what they want, providers don't want specifications telling them what to do, everyone's deliverables suck (except ours, ofc), etc.   Only nine providers (seven organizations) stated that proof-of-concepts were included within their reports (e.g. a single command or script that can be queried or executed to demonstrate the issue), with clients describing their presence as rare.    That's just straight disturbing. NDA's aside, I feel like that deserves naming and shaming, it's a deplorable practice that makes your client less secure (they can't verify if they've actually fixed something) and is also very conducive to vague hand-wavy findings that you can't prove actually exist.  I really hated the random pictures in the report, feels like whoever put them in there went to a stock photo site for 'information security' and just started grabbing stuff. The rest of the format was nice."
netsec,37mcu3,coldwaterq,5,Thu May 28 22:20:34 2015 UTC,"From my perspective, there is a bit more to it.   Remediation becomes to literal or focused when developers see a single POC.  Example: A XSS POC  <script>alert(""Vulnerable to XSS"");</script>. I've seen cases where developers ignore the ""solution"" or ""recommendation"" section to whitelist input  BUT RATHER develop a filter to remove angle brackets.  Well, if your URL encode the angle brackets, guess what, the XSS payload works again.   Including POC exploits can lead developers to defend their applications only the POC and not address the root cause. Just another perspective from ~6 years of pentest experience."

It's that or they'll go and collect data from a bunch of breaches, collect accounts with e-mail addresses belonging to the same mail provider, and then dump it out. We saw this back last fall when Yandex, Mail.ru, and Gmail were all reported as ""hacked"" (and subsequently reposted again and again in /r/netsec) even though in reality they were just stolen via other means.

netsec,37gajk,ColinKeigher,3,Wed May 27 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"One of the interesting things I have found while going through the data I have collected over the past few years is the reposting of database dumps   Colin is absolutely correct and makes a great point. In fact, I omitted a brief ""lessons learned"" section on this post for brevity. This was #1.  There is an incredible amount of copy-posting for ""popular"" breaches. It's very common for groups to re-brand dumps as their own. In the case of this post, the numbers presented (such as # of emails, hashes, etc.) are all the unique values (thanks, Elasticsearch!). Total values would be much higher.   I'd be curious what sort of duplicate level such as what I have seen Jordan has seen within his work.   A great question. Really, when it comes to storing and tweeting - not much. The reason being twofold:   Computing requirements - duplicates are difficult to detect since they are not, in fact, true duplicates. ""Hacked by xxCallofDutyxx"" becomes ""Hacked by XLeg10n"". Hashing won't work.   So then, perhaps I could compare found emails? This is also very expensive. There is often cases where the re-posting contains fewer, more, or different records from the same dump.   It is a different dump - Since this is for security research, I don't just want to discard a re-post. A duplicate tells me that group x is actively seeking out records and claiming them as their own. This is an attribute we can use in the future when defining group behavior.   Colin, if you've found a way to handle this with Canary (another fantastic platform!), please let me know!"
netsec,37gajk,ColinKeigher,2,Wed May 27 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"My approach is different as I am actually storing the data within MySQL (MariaDB really but I digress)--although next week I am going to have a beta test with Elasticsearch in front of it to improve the overall search.  The way the database is laid out, I have it setup to store data the following way:   Raw text table - where the actual text retrieved is stored Source table - where the source of the data is kept associated with a hash of raw text Objects table - any extracted data is then stored as a separate item   There are a few helper tables associated with that to relate the raw text to the objects too. There are no more than five tables handling everything with the data itself.  What Canary does is if a sample is requested, it pulls the text and all of the sources associated with the hash. What becomes related is all the hashes  associated with the objects in one of the helper tables, which allows me to go into the related data for the sample and see all of the results. It has some speed issues so to speed it up I don't go beyond 50 results from the objects.  A technique I experimented with a while back was to reduce the amount of raw text stored by breaking everything apart by newlines and storing each line and its associated hash within a table and then creating an ""assembler"" table to assemble the text as a whole. Instead of just primarily comparing the objects I'd then just instead compare it at a line by line segment. The problem with this approach is that you can end up with a lot of garbage results too but a new project I am working on from time to time will possibly make use of it since the issue isn't as bad for it as it would be for say Canary.  If you're at DEFCON this summer, let's meet up. :)"
netsec,37gajk,4kidsinatrenchcoat,2,Wed May 27 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"That's similar to how I store things, separating out the metadata I care about.   I am going to have a beta test with Elasticsearch   You'll really like it. Searching over free text is a major use case for you and I, and Elasticsearch does that very, very well. Just be sure to have some kind of interface to Elasticsearch, and don't just expose ES to everyone. I have mine going through an nginx reverse proxy for basic auth.   A technique I experimented with a while back...   That's an interesting idea - I can see the pros and cons. This is something kind of similar to what /u/StrangeUSB mentioned. You could do something like tokenizing the text into things we care about and then do some kind of distance calculation or fuzzy hashing. It's a tricky problem, for sure.

But after playing with it, found it was really easy to get going. This individuals use-case made sense, so what the heck.   In the end, on Linux systems its a nice isolated location to have access to all the Kali tools someone might be used to. On OS X systems, its supported but I think anyone that has used Docker before will be aware of the limitations. Not having access to the kernel extensions means on OS X its running virtual box on the back end and at that point you might as well go for a full VM install instead."

This pretty much started changing in BT5 once we would go around and see that so many people were using BackTrack installed with no real in place update system. Obviously this was bad for everyone.

Things like NetHunter started as interesting experiments and then grew into really large projects of their own with a large number of users. I am a creature of habit, so I will likely stick with VMs. But I have a friend that is a Linux admin of Centos systems and he was messaging me about how useful this is for him as he can spin up a container, run some tools, then remove it without screwing with the base OS.

Timing covert channels are a really problematics, not only using it to exfiltrate data but as also to detect and mitigate. To exfiltrate over the LAN is ok, the network is kinda predictible but over the internet an small flip-bit caused by a high latency in some hop can screw your data. An easy way to mitigate is to add random lag between packtes in a very paranoid secured network segment.

Or I guess if the intent is more on a stenography attack, where you are trying to hide in plain sight by attaching your private data to non-suspicious data, so a pcap wouldn't show anything unless you analyse the timing. This would also work well to get through a f/w that is blocking all TCP/UDP, but letting ICMP through.    I would classify this as a very realistic side channel attack, I'll keep it in my bag of tricks.    What can be done to prevent it, while allowing the network to function normally? Whitelisting?-maybe.  Traffic shaping proxy?-prob not, it would just reduce the speed of transmission by increasing the spacing between packets. Other ideas?

One great thing about the internet is the wide availability of security research tools. These tools encourage the advancement of security worldwide. I invite you to find a list of major web security vulnerabilities uncovered in the past decade. I bet at least half were uncovered by members of the public. Additionally, many major companies offer ""bug bounty"" programs, paying users to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities uncovered in their software. If export of security tools from the US were restricted, hundreds of thousands of vulnerabilities could go unpatched by companies until black-hat hackers exploit them maliciously. I urge the Department of Commerce to reconsider this proposal."

Their strategy to do this is by targeting weaponized offensive capability. Their key discriminator on whether something is weaponized or not is evasion. If the technology attempts to evade detection--it's dangerous and must be controlled. If it doesn't--then it's probably just harmless research proving a point/advancing the state of knowledge.  I suspect they'd consider the current proposed rules to be compatible with bug bounty programs and vulnerability research."

I thought this would be great because most companies will start and interview with , ""so has xxx explained what we do here?"" and I can retort with ""actually I did quite a bit of research on your guys and during that I found YYY, ZZZ, blah blah"".  This plan backfired every single time I did it and they all had pretty much the same response which is: ""This guy creates his own problems to solve"", as if I introduced the bad code or leaked the info or left the staging servers wide open.

netsec,36s24z,walloon5,5,Fri May 22 13:17:08 2015 UTC,"Well the trick of moving money between cards is kind of a classic race condition problem - adding to one balance, and subtracting from the other.  There are a lot of ways to address it, simple things like a flag - flag one card to ""receiving a balance"", flag the other to ""sending a balance"" - and to and from which card, and once things look ready - delay - then move balance, reset flags to ""sent/received"" then delay, and unset flags. Could still be seconds, but a race condition could be avoided.  I like that he tried a kind of fun three card confusion.  But anyone, people that have programmed online games (like muds) know about item and gold duping and this is a similar simple problem. Also, computer scientists study these things more formally so they really should know it if they're a programmer.  Point being some of this complexity can come back to a programmer.  Sometimes where things fall short though - truly - is beyond one programmer.  Sometimes what happens is you get a database, designed by someone else, and you're not allowed to change it at all. And then start with a simple system of cards with balances. And one web site. Then years go by. Someone wants to transfer balances, it starts as a manual process. Eventually someone adds to that process but isn't allowed to add flag fields to a database so they do their best with some cookies. Then someone adds a load balancer, but doesn't let it decode certs and it hides the true client source address, etc. Then the madness gets worse as code grows and grows beyond it's original scope, barely working, scaled to hell, managed by people that inherited the system and don't know it all that well and definitely are aware that it sucks bad, but have no budget to fix it .... etc :)  Then testing like you suggest starts to help because the mess has become a black box where anything could happen."

Granted the reality of the situation, the level of moralizing here is outrageous - it only works on people who are already willing to do the right thing. Attacking someone who comes forward is punishing the good for being the good. If people can leave Starbucks with free food, it's Starbucks' problem alone.  Nature is filled with many creatures murdering each other over scarce resources (even trees poison and strangle each other). Humans also have their predators, which is why people tolerate abuse and rule by governments - predation by other governments, bandits, warlords, or criminals would probably be worse. As any security expert or risk analyst knows, anything that can happen does happen, perhaps with some frequency modulated by economics. That we feel murder is wrong didn't stop people from building the atomic bomb. Starbucks should be thankful the OP didn't sell his exploit to money laundering organizations. Their normative rules for how predators should generously stop predating are childish.  (Note: If you think people accept the rule of law for moral reasons and not for practical reasons - ask yourself why ~90% of the population drives as far over the speed limit as they can get away with.

People don't need to do this stuff out of the goodness of their heart. If anything, giving freebies like this encourages companies to be careless and not spend money on proper testing. This isn't like finding a bug in a piece of open source software where exploiting the code has no effect on anything but your system; you're literally breaking their system, despite your non-malicious intent.   I'm really glad that there are honorable people out there like this guy, but it doesn't mean that I think it should be legal. Rules of engagement should always be clearly defined, and if you haven't done that, you should be open to the legal consequences.  I completely understand why someone would do this. Realistically, hackers will always be out there, and if you want to take the risk of anonymously submitting something like this without causing any loss to the target, then in a certain light that's a pretty charitable thing. It doesn't make it (nor should it be) legal though, just like making entry to someone's home without permission."
netsec,36s24z,Kratzyyy,14,Thu May 21 21:19:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm, you make a convincing argument.  Maybe the best of both worlds is what we have now, you need authorisation to do it legally unless an organisation specifically allows you to responsibly disclose the vulnerability (like Facebook's bounty program).

Legally you have no claim to test that security but an obvious motivation to do it. The companies on the other hand don't want to risk an issue with a production environment if someone hits it and ontop of that; every unauthorized attempt looks malicious in the eyes of a company.   Bug bounty programs are a pretty nifty middle ground. Most that implement them likely do third-party security audits as well but realize that one organization may not (will not) catch everything. Everyone is pretty compartmentaly specialized. By offering up prizes to white hats it allows a much broader skill set to look for problems.  It'd be nice to see more companies go this route.   The holy grail would be a company that sets up a mock production environment with dummy data to be used as a 'security playground.' It doesn't need to be an exact copy with clusters or anything but a dumbed down version of their most critical infrastructure that can be a sacrificial playground between testing and operational deployment.

I wouldn't try SQLi on random systems, I wouldn't try exec or overflows or whatever - but I'd try XSS because it's effectively exploiting myself and I don't see race conditions or public access that large of a problem (unless it can cause real quasi-tangible damage to the system itself)  It's like accessing a public resource which displays phpinfo versus accessing a (for some reason) public resource with a ""delete database"" button. I'd not push that button, obviously.  I think intent needs to be tied into a lot of these intrusion laws, as well as damage. If no damage occurs, or if the damage can be repaid easily (in OP's example, it'd be like $10) there shouldn't be the threat of federal prosecution hanging over their head, especially with disclosure.  Civil penalties I could see if it reflected the true cost (I'll sue you for $10!), but you just stated you don't find it morally wrong but you also want it illegal. I can't wrap my head around that at all. How do you want people put in prison for something you don't find morally wrong and which can be reworked to prevent harm for both parties involved?

Instead, I contacted an unnamed industry security leader who urged me to work directly with Starbucks.  He connected me directly to a Starbucks security engineer.

But since Starbucks doesn't sell franchises, they may not notice at end of month.  The way these programs are profitable, is they expire credit. They do this in one of two ways, depending on the regulations in the area they are operating in. A lot of jurisdictions treat stored value as real money, and many of those jurisdictions don't allow you to simply expire it. So, you can   Expire the credit after x months.

So, this profit should be accounted for and audited at some stage, and if all else fails, then this will be where the fraud is measured.   It should be noted though, that some companies are notorious for not managing this properly. I'm not sure about their state today, but airline loyalty programs used to be well known for not managing this correctly. I know of some that didn't even run liability reporting. All of the loyalty or stored value balances are business liabilities, it's money you now owe to your customers. So most companies will account for this and manage it accordingly, it should be no different from taking money out of the till, but saying anything about how Starbucks manage this would just be speculation."

Just one (minor) remark:   Theorizing a bit more, what happens if the domain controller doesn’t belong to the same network segment as the clients? If that is the case, an attacker can use ARP Spoofing to poison the ARP tables of both switches and hosts, redirecting the traffic meant for the gateway to a MAC address of the attacker’s choice, impersonating the domain controller.

This type of attack has long been a weakness of Tor's security, primarily from countries like China.  Sure, Tor's developers say it is not meant to withstand attack from a ""global passive adversary"", but we have enough evidence that such organizations exist to be working toward solving that goal. With my tinfoil hat on, I sometimes wonder if the reason Tor has not integrated these types of features officially is from an implicit (or perhaps conspiratorially explicit) agreement that Tor can live as long as it's vulnerable to this type of analysis. Tor: works well if your adversary is a third-world country. Not so well if you're a big one."

netsec,36n0zi,jc_sec,11,Wed May 20 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"Do not pay the threat.  Immediately remove the impacted system from the network and remove the threat.   It is not always the best idea to immediately remove ransomware from an infected PC. In many cases once removed, information used to decrypt files can be lost and the person affected may not have any chance of recovery. This is even more important for businesses. I would actually recommend the opposite until you know what you are dealing with.   Restore any impacted files from a known good backup. If there is a decrypter available in the response kit. Attempt to use this.   Only use the decrypter for your specific infection, do not use one for another variant. Using the wrong decrypter could potentially further the damage to the files, ensuring 100% that there is no option for recovery.  One more thing. Your CryptoLockerDecrypt folder has a tool for TeslaCrypt, not CryptoLocker. It is really really really important with this type of malware that you get the name right, since encryption implementations vary greatly between cryptoransomware families. Also, keep in mind this tool is for older (before April 28, 2015) variants only and has not been updated for the most current ones.  If you want to add anything else or have questions about existing content in your kit, you are welcome to PM me and I'd be happy to answer.  Good effort, but you really do need to do some more research and spend time personally analyzing the malware you choose to give advice on to make sure that what you are telling people is correct. Or just ask an expert on the subject, most of us will spend time helping an effort like this as long as you have a commitment to ensure the information is not potentially harmful."

netsec,36n0zi,lawrenceabrams,4,Thu May 21 02:30:22 2015 UTC,"Some comments/feedback on the kit .   CoinVault - I guess something is better than nothing, but the keys Kaspersky have recovered are a very small subset. Many people tried it and could not get their keys.  New versions of CoinVault no longer work with that site. CryptoLocker - This ransomware doesnt exist anymore. Yeah, there are infections that pretend to be cryptolocker, but they aren't actually the real thing. Your included content on cryptolocker is obsolete and unfortunately won't be helpful anymore. The original cryptolocker was taken down around June 2014. DecryptoLocker - This tool by fireeye is supposed to be used in conjunction with their https://www.decryptcryptolocker.com/ site. You go to that site, submit a encrypted file that was encrypted by the original cryptolocker and it will try and find the decryption key for you.  These keys were retrieved through Operation Tovar.  Once you have the key, you can then use the DecryptoLocker program to decrypt your files.  Once again, this only works on the original cryptolocker and has no benefit for any other ransomware. You really should ask the devs/authors before including people's works in your kit. I would have said yes if you asked about my CryptoLocker guide being added, but asking permission would have been appreciated. TeslaDecrypt is not actively maintained as far as I know.  A newer decryption tool has been released called TeslaDecoder that works on all variants of TeslaCrypt (ECC, EZZ, EXX variants). http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/576600/tesladecoder-released-to-decrypt-exx-ezz-ecc-files-encrypted-by-teslacrypt/   Last, but not least, we all know that paying the ransomware is not the right thing as it only encourages them to make more. At the same time, tell that to the Doctors Office who just had all their medical records encrypted or the mother who has all of the pictures of her deceased son encrypted.  These are real examples from people I have spoken to, and for them, paying the ransom wasn't really an option.  If you have questions, feel free to send me a PM or contact me at BC."

Sure, it's theoretically a lovely idea - but in the real world, you do what has to be done.

However, finding any classified material on unclassified networks in a secure facility is a problem. Reading the news or articles like this that contains classified data on your unclassified work computer is treated like a breech.   Edit:  Also, this guy is grandstanding. IPsec isn't used for classified data. Haipe is. And to that end, I find it doubtful that any Haipe vendor supports gssapi."

IIRC, those clarifications indicated that they can't restrict what you read on personal computers outside of secure facilities due to first amendment rights. The tone of the document I read indicated that the problem was moreso about preventing classified material from entering unclassified networks in secure facilities, since any time that occurs - working or reading the news - it's a security incident.  That said, I can't find that guidance right now so I'm having a hard time remembering the details.

Accidentally coming across something doesn't count, you can't be blamed if CNN plasters top secret documents on the screen.   But if you actively seek it out then you are in violation of your agreement with the government. Doesn't mean it'll trigger any kind of investigation or loss of clearance but when it comes time for a re-investigation or upgrade you may be asked something like ""have you ever gone to wikileaks or any other public source to look up classified information?""

The paper states:   We have found serious security weaknesses in all major components of IPsec. As always in security, there is no prize for getting 90% right; you have to get everything right. IPsec falls well short of that target, and will require some major changes before it can possibly provide a good level of security.   And:   We strongly discourage the use of IPsec in its current form for protection of any kind of valuable information, and hope that future iterations of the design will be improved. However, we even more strongly discourage any current alternatives, and recommend IPsec when the alternative is an insecure network. Such are the realities of the world.   I'd say ""lambasted IPsec"" is an accurate qualification of what Ferguson and Schneier did throughout that paper, i.e., criticize the design of IPsec."

I believe only looking at plaintext base station broacasts would be classified as ""radio communications that were transmitted for use by the general public"" but you could have to fight about that in court.

Divulgence of certain radio communications that were transmitted for use by the general public (such as over-the-air radio and television broadcasts).   What kinds of interception and divulgence are prohibited?   A person selling or publishing a recording or contents of someone else’s wireless phone conversation.   What about equipment used to intercept radio communications?

Exceptions for ""well, s/he never accessed call/message content"" won't be there, but prohibition of snooping on infrastructure might be. This kind of vagueness appears to be the standard, where I am (having wasted weeks at a time trawling through legislation unrelated to this discussion), it seems to be a kind of future-proofing system which law writers use - ""leave it up to the judge"". It's definitely worth reading relevant laws (and there is rarely technical content in these laws, instead they define terms, sketch out penalties and delegate actual rule-making to an external authority which you then must also read!) - for yourself, in whichever jurisdiction you happen to be.  Besides, even if your local Telecommunications laws do not appear to specifically target such things, you may find your radio spectrum licensing authority has an opinion on it. For example, here in Australia the Radiocommunications Act, whilst it has specific penalties for emissions (transmissions) of any kind which aren't covered by one of the approved licensing schemes, also talks about ""use"" of spectrum - which includes receivers. Thankfully for some decades here in Australia, operator/apparatus licensing appears to be usually not required, however the licensing system is still set up to be able to issue receive-only permits/licenses. It wasn't always the case - Australia had banned (or failed to legalize) even plain old CB radio until the early '80s; it's easy to forget that the freedoms we have today weren't always there, and may just as easily disappear again when lawmakers get jittery."

We actually don't encourage vendors to pay researchers less, but we do work with our customers to decide what they will pay out. Which means some companies pay out more and others pay less, due to a variety of different reasons:  Some companies have a higher budget than others for a variety of reasons, whether that's because they have a higher allocation out of their security budget, they're more comfortable with bug bounties, or something else. For the lower bounty payouts, sometimes it can also be customer education about the space, where companies need to learn more about what dollar amounts are fair and what amounts are needed to attract researchers and get the results the company wants.  Many companies get started with bug bounties and start with smaller rewards, and after they've become comfortable with the concept and are happy with the results they get, they increase their payouts/rewards.  There's a bunch of different variables at play here, but we do work hard to advocate for the researcher and we do want to help researchers make more. We can do that through higher payouts on programs, more programs & options for researchers, and we just recently started rewarding our top 3 researchers with bonus payouts every month.

Is that not what I wanted? While I understand the argument from an untrusted server perspective with SSH or website logins, why would I not want to be able to prove I created and email when I sign it?

netsec,35qy9f,gsuberland,8,Tue May 12 23:30:13 2015 UTC,"The keyword here is non-repudiation. Digital signatures inherently provide it, and do so without limitation. By demonstrating authorship in the context of forgery prevention, you are also saying ""I wrote this"", which provides non-repudiation. Since your public key is public, and must be so in order to allow verification of authenticity, the recipient is free to distribute the signed message to anyone else and show that you wrote it.  Limited non-repudiation, i.e. a system whereby you can provide some kind of contractual proof of authorship to only a subset of entities without leaking that proof to others, is a much more difficult goal. I suspect that it's an open problem, because it appears to fall into the same problem category as copy prevention and self-destruction (DRM, essentially), which are known to be unsolvable by classical computers.  The only technique I can potentially conceive of which may provide limited non-repudation and message authenticity simultaneously is a construct similar to ephemeral key exchange, though I'm unaware of any concrete solution."

They can simply share the authenticity record trail back to your long term key.  Keep in mind that most threat models in limited non-repudiation designs include cases where the content of the message is disclosed by the receiver with the intent of demonstrating that you said something. If you don't trust the receiver, but also want to provide that receiver with some proof, it's very hard to find a solution that survives the fact that any data on the system is free to be copied."

However, instead of signing the ephemeral keys, participants simply exchange both unsigned keys ( gA , ga ) and ( gB , gb ) to calculate three shared secrets: gaB , gAb , and gab.  By then using all three shared secrets as one combined seed to the initial KDF, we accomplish the following:  Increased Forgability. Since there are no signatures involved, anyone could take A’s public key, make up an ephemeral keypair for A (“a” in the diagram above), combine that with their own identity key and ephemeral key (“C” and “c”), and produce an entire forged transcript – even if they’ve never had a conversation with “A” before. Now anyone is capable of easily producing a forged message from anyone else, whether they’ve actually had a conversation with them before or not.  Maintained Forward Secrecy. Since an ephemeral handshake is part of the KDF seed, the compromise of an identity key will still never result in the compromise of previously transmitted ciphertext – or even passive observation of future ciphertext.   Axolotl's PFS can really only be compromised by a third party being part of the key exchange, being in control of the target's computer.  https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/wiki/ProtocolV2 https://github.com/trevp/axolotl/wiki https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/"

That being said, it doesn't really provide any non-repudiation at all, whereas ""true"" limited NR solutions should be able to provide NR for a selected subset of users without those users being able to prove anything to someone outside that group."
netsec,35qy9f,Natanael_L,1 point,Wed May 13 12:45:10 2015 UTC,"It allows both participants to verify who they're talking to, and if at least one of them discards their ephemeral secret then nobody can prove anything about the authencity of the plaintext log. The ciphertext log is as I said previously as useless as a fake one. Is that not enough?  The initiator of the chat only knows the responses from the other person is real because he knows the source of the ephemeral keys (the key exchanges he took part of). Because nobody else can be certain of the source, they can't know any part of it is genuine."
netsec,35qy9f,gsuberland,1 point,Wed May 13 12:47:25 2015 UTC,"Right, that provides authenticity and anonymity by eschewing non-repudiation. That's great for anonymity, as is the point with this article, where NR isn't a design goal.  The difference between authenticity and NR is that NR requires a participant to be able to prove to a 3rd party, after the fact, that something was said by someone. Authenticity just proves the identity of the person sending messages to one person, with most practical solutions providing NR purely as a side-effect. The algorithm you described goes out of its way to provide authenticity without NR, which isn't the same as providing authenticity and limited NR (i.e. a proof that can be provided to a preset group of people, but that is meaningless if shared with others).  As an example, let's say I work in an organisation and have a private conversation with someone. The original intent is that only they can decrypt the message I send to them. They could later send the message to someone else along with the digital signature to prove that I sent the message. That's non-repudiation, because I can't deny that I sent the message. Now imagine that we want to limit the non-repudiation to people within the organisation, such that only they can be given a proof, but people outside cannot. You still need NR inside, but you also need plausible deniability against outsiders. That's limited NR."
netsec,35qy9f,Natanael_L,1 point,Wed May 13 12:59:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, I thought you were asking for something else.  I've seen ring signature based schemes for providing NR to chosen entities. Haven't looked closely at them, though. You derive a treshold keypair from the keys of the group members that are meant to be able to validate the signature. Don't know all the rest of the details, however. IIRC they're designed so that only the holders of the private keys in the group can verify the signature.  Edit: You can always create anonymous keypairs for signing, and then only prove ownership of those keypairs to selected group members via key exchange scheme similar to three-DH. Then they can validate all your signatures, but nobody else can confirm it is from you."

netsec,35jqt3,Abraxhas,2,Mon May 11 14:26:34 2015 UTC,"But to your original question, no, not really.  I've set up a VoIP solution for my previous company utilizing FreePBX.  Our trunk service was located about 2000 miles away and we didn't have too many problems."
netsec,35jqt3,theeyeinmyface,2,Mon May 11 14:56:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely within the realm of possibility.  Some points:  1) There's a time and place for cloud hosted servers.  Your PBX isn't one of them.  It should be on site, preferably virtualized, and set up with some sort of high availability across multiple hosts.  My previous company was a call center environment receiving ~1000 calls a day.  If that service went down, it was going to be a huge issue for customers and for the bosses who didn't want to pay ~20 cell center employees to browse Facebook.  2) FreePBX makes things relatively easy, but there's still a learning curve on it.  Spend a couple of weeks to read everything you can about VoIP.  3) Make sure you set up your phones on a separate VLAN.  At first, it'll seem like its not worth the amount of effort it takes to do that.  But the increase in security and call quality is well worth the investment.  4) Depending on your use case, don't expect to save a ton of money.  Where self hosted PBXs shine is when you have multiple users who make very few calls.  When every user is an additional $20/month on an unlimited plan, they add up.  If you transition to paying for everything yourself, including your trunk fees, the marginal cost of each individual user is negligible, but the per minute cost might be comparable to what you were paying for your cloud service.  We ended up actually paying a couple of hundred bucks more per month, but that was worth the tradeoff in terms of our increase in capabilities, ie a proper call queueing system, queue monitoring software, phone call coaching and recording for QA, the ability to make automated appointment reminder calls, to do self service user querying, to do queue placeholding, etc.  5) Realize that if shit hits the fan, you're liable and you can't pass the buck to the service provider.  But it sounds like you're the boss anyway..   6) You'll probably want a redundant network connection.  If your network connection goes down due to, say, a storm, people should still be able to reach your telephone number.  7) I always recommend Flowroute for the trunking service.  They were extremely helpful when I didn't know crap and was trying to set things up.  And they're pretty affordable.  8) Finally, I assume you know this as this is /r/netsec, but always keep security in mind.  Lock down your PBX to internal IP addresses only, make sure there's no way to reach it externally.. if you absolutely have to expose it, for a branch office, for instance, make sure you do it over VPN so everything is encrypted and there's no external exposure.  Make sure you set up some sort of rate monitoring or country filtering with your trunk service, and disable auto-repay.  Waking up to a $10,000 phone bill because your PBX was compromised overnight is not fun.  That's all the nuggets I have right now.  Its extremely rewarding, but also very challenging.  It can also be risky.  But when you get everything up and running, and realized you just saved thousands and thousands of upfront costs combined with thousands of recurring monthly costs, its pretty cool."

You could brute force the key if network joining is on but it's basically an encrypted end to end serial port for all intents and purposes.  AES is fragile but afaik still unfeasible to break.

Time and time again, I see companies building embedded systems and they have been pen-tested by ""experienced"" and big companies and they get complete and utter crap back because the testers simply aren't able to grasp even the basic differences.  Take some smart-meters. They are joined in a mesh network. Anything in that mesh network is entirely trusted. Customer A and customer B have no partitioning at all, no data is signed or authenticated beyond the mesh network. Capture one device, and you can inject spoofed data into the network without even having to touch the RF or encryption side of things.  Or many alarm systems, which have the same AES key used across every single device manufactured.  Or the implementation of smart LED street lighting I have looked at, where again, there is a network protected by decent security, but capture a single node and you can change the address and node type without any issue.  Or the typical mobile app scenatio where the developers have totally failed to implement any controls once you have access to an authenticated device.  Claiming device capture isn't a threat is overlocking a huge number of threats and is nothing short of idiotic. Keep at it though, becuase it is what is making me money."

If you manage to capture an end point you've limited the amount of damage that can be done is easily mitigated by requiring access tokens on the end device.  Just because these idiots didn't doesn't mean that's not being done.  If you manage to add a bad coordinator to the network then I would say there is something very wrong with the implementation indeed.  If I wanted to do it I would mic or thermal cam the device, extract the key, add a router to the network to get the configuration of the network with the key you just extracted, then proceed to pwn the ever loving fuck out of the network.  More work is required if the service running on the network requires authentication, which it should, this is so basic I can't believe there are production networks that DO NOT have this in place.

The issue is not with the underlying HA protocol (Z-Wave), it's with an HA controller toolkit he used to create his own controller.  ""Z-Way"" is not an HA protocol, it's an API 3 dudes cooked up and are selling to people making their own HA systems on Raspberry Pi.  This controls  Z-Wave home automation devices, and they communicate via a well-tested AES encrypted secure channel.  The Z-Wave HA devices that you'd think of (switches, thermostats, contact sensors, locks, motion sensors, etc, etc) run the one standard Z-Wave chipset and would not have any local API outside of that provided by the reference chipset manufactured by and licensed from Sigma Systems.  None of the major home automation controller vendors that I am aware of (Vera, SmartThings, Wink, etc) utilize this ""Z-Way"" stack.  So yes, if you rolled your own HA platform on an RPi and for some reason chose to use code from these dudes, then yes it's insecure.  So is a server with authentication turned off.  To say that Z-Wave Home Automation Devices are somehow insecure as a result would be like saying the Internet is insecure because somebody somewhere once had a server running without authentication turned on.  All the author has discovered is that the roll-your-own home automation controller he cooked up relied on insecure code and he'd probably have been better off purchasing a pre-cooked solution as he didn't understand the security trade-offs the authors of this stack were making."

In the article, everything is labeled correctly and the described problems are real. Perhaps the author could have been more clear regarding where the security problem is, but frankly:   While this weakness in the Z-Way package [...]   is pretty clear to me. Even the title clearly speaks of Attacking Z-Way controlled house devices. No problem here except the name resemblance.

Answer   Summary  A Bomgar-specific Vulnerability Report has been issued May 5, 2015, by CERT under CVE-2015-0935.  Bomgar Remote Support version 14.3.1 and possibly earlier versions deserialize untrusted data without sufficient validation. An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary input to at least one vulnerable PHP file, and authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary input to multiple vulnerable PHP files. When malicious data is deserialized, arbitrary PHP code may be executed in the context of the PHP server process.  This is the same vulnerability which was reported against PHP under CVE-2014-3515.  Remediation  Customers are advised to upgrade to Bomgar Remote Support Release 15.1.1 as soon as possible.  Customers who cannot upgrade to 15.1.1 immediately due to change request cycles or other reasons are advised to make plans to upgrade to 15.1.1 and to apply the patch for CVE-2014-3515 in the short term. This patch is designed to be applied in production without disconnecting clients or otherwise disrupting service."

Can you explain how you think part of the key is being leaked? Would the same leak be present if I chose p and N at random and then applied the same divide-and-nextprime operation?

The only possible way I could see this compromising security is if two different people have the same message in the certificate. This technique would be acceptable to implement as a security solution as long as the modulus that you are using is private and no one else has access to it. In regards to the keyspace reduction - it would not necessarily weaken the security either. If I am understanding this correctly, the reduction between the two prime numbers that you are generating are random and only the bits in the middle are changed. After that, the lowest bits are adjusted after changing the middle bits to make it a prime number again. And as the author has stated before, the new prime will always be slightly bigger than N/p.  If this is the process that is being followed then the keyspace reduction is negligible."

I'll be glad to contribute.  One thing I thought of immediately was that the Parsers should be classes and should probably implement a Parser interface, that way the code contract of what a Parser does is clearly defined and new Parsers can be added by the community easily.  A ParserTrait might be helpful too.  I envisioned something like this:  interface ParserInterface {      // define contract }  trait ParserTrait {      // boilerplate/generic helper methods that all Parsers can utilize }  class SpamCopParser implements ParserInterface {       use ParserTrait;      // SpamCop specific implementations of interface methods      // And optional utilization of ParserTrait generic helper methods }   Just a random thought.  It might seem like over-engineering, but I believe a design pattern similar to this would work very well in the long-run.  This is something that could be done regardless of whether you build it off a framework like Laravel or CakePHP, etc.  I didn't want to add that as an issue right now in your github repo since so much refactoring is going to happen when you switch to an MVC framework, but maybe something to keep in mind."

The first sentence of the article states that this is about exploiting the body of software known as 'The Windows Kernel' .. and then goes on to explain how to use a 3rd-party driver to run shellcode using standard techniques like stackoverflows, use-after-frees, etc. The article has very little to do with exploiting the Windows Kernel other than knowing a few specifics of how to make calls in the kernel. The techniques and ideas presented aren't anything new - use-after-free? Stackoverflows? These are the most widely studied classes of bugs in all of software development. They're day-one in any software security course.  I did read the article and I didn't find anything new in it. That is why I wrote my comment. Maybe I'm in the wrong here - maybe there's value in it for other readers here.  Even at that, the article does a very poor job of connecting the dots for anybody that would actually be learning how these exploits work; anybody attempting to learn how to spot such mistakes when writing software or to defend against such mistakes would probably find themselves just that much more confused.

Could you show me how the 'use-after-free' part of the article actually shows you how to exploit a use-after-free? I think it doesn't, but I'd honestly listen to any argument otherwise. It just says that you can, shows you the functions it calls that perform the allocation, the use, and the free, but doesn't explain any of the details like exploiting a use-after-free. Like I said, if anybody actually wants to learn how to use this stuff, or how to prevent the mistakes that make these possible, or how to defend against them - you know, actually learn something, they can't because this is a horrible write-up devoid of insight.  Take for example the 'Arbitrary Overwrites' section:   There are various places where the attacker value can be written for effective execution such as HalDispatchTable+4, Interrupt Dispatch Table, System Service Dispatch Table, and so on.  ...  write_what_where.where = HalDispatchTable+0x4  ...  hola = ntdll.NtQueryIntervalProfile(inp, byref(out))   If you actually wanted to learn something, you'd connect the dots. Why does overwriting HalDispatchTable do anything useful? Why does invoking NtQueryIntervalProfiledo anything useful? If the point of this article was pedagogy, then they should've included the analysis that indicates the connection between these two - that calling NtQueryIntervalProfile from user land causes whatever is at HalDispatchTable+0x4 to be called in kernel mode. When combined with the ability to use the arbitrary memory access bug in our victim driver (which they don't even show) this finally allows us to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.  A much better writeup of this technique can be found here: http://poppopret.blogspot.com/2011/07/windows-kernel-exploitation-basics-part.html  So, again, I ask what value this write-up provides? If you need to know how this stuff works already to understand the article.. then you arrive at a logical contradiction - you can understand the article, but you already knew everything in it so it provides no value to you; or you don't know how this stuff works, and so the article doesn't make sense to you and so provides no value to you.  Who would benefit from reading this article but someone who just needs a refresher on how these attacks work?   What a laughable comment from someone likely in academia.   I don't work in academia.

In other words if you put data maximization as a constraint the question to the designers would be how do you respect privacy given this constraint?

There's always competing interests when you're designing something, and I think it's valuable to provide people a tool in the form of this card-based exercise to help them think through potential privacy issues in various ways. Guidelines and best practices are all well and good, but this exercise is more about application of the guidelines, regulations, best practices, etc in a real world scenario. Where the rubber meets the road so to speak.    Companies who want to sell, trade or otherwise keep their customers data are going to tell their designers to build in the features they want or they'll find someone else who can.   Of course. I agree there. That's why if privacy aware moral individuals don't stop privacy violations in the design stage, then we do have to fall back on things like regulation...oversight...etc. That doesn't mean we give up on helping people practice privacy thinking in their designs.

netsec,352jmi,aydiosmio,2,Thu May 7 12:53:18 2015 UTC,"You seem to be confusing collisions with preimage attacks.  MD5 is vulnerable to  fatal collision attacks, as shown here but there are no practical preimage attacks. The attacker cannot just directly get something that produces a particular hash, given only the hash itself. They still have to hash different guesses until they find it. They can ""break into your account if they have the hash"" if your password is weak and/or if you used the hashing algorithm in a way that is unsuitable for password hashing but that applies just as much to SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512, etc. as it does for MD5.  In practice, the success of password cracking does not depend on ability to find collisions. It depends on how long it takes to compute the final hash for a password because that determines how many passwords you can try in a particular timeframe. There are algorithms that are specifically designed to be slow, such as bcrypt and scrypt, so they are preferable for password hashing. But if you do have to use a fast algorithm, it depends on how many rounds you use and not so much on whether you use MD5."

MD5 isn't a good password hash because it's not computational expensive but I don't have a problem using it to verify if the large file I transferred between two computers is corrupt.  You've always got to consider the threat level in security. If you're really worried, use two different hash algorithms.

Then instead of treating that as a prototype and figuring out how to simplify it he declared it done.  U2F is neat in that it ties the authentication to the browser's encrypted connection to the server such that it can't be reused in any other sessions, blocking all replay attacks (which traditional OTP is vulnerable to) and effectively blocks all credentials phishing. A PIN protected physical U2F token is among the most secure authentication methods out there. Physical attacks against the token is the ONLY practical class of attacks against it."

You'd think there'd be some relational restrictions in the DBMS at least.  Also, maybe this is just a product of culture differences, but did anyone else get a ""hey look, I just committed fraud, lol these guys are morons"" vibe from the writing style?"

Not fraud directly, but from what I've heard the Indian authorities are not so picky on having probable cause."
