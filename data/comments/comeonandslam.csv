Shifting the first is much harder, though, as I can't get Space Jam to Bm without heavy distortion. If I can't figure something out, I think I might just have to grin and bear the lack of harmony there.   Mercifully, I have most of the track planned in a way where I'm only using the main singer's voice during the bits in Bm, so that makes it a bit easier in that regards."
comeonandslam,38z747,WLLMWM-phil,2,Mon Jun 8 13:38:23 2015 UTC,Space Jam parts should come in a couple seconds earlier with the other track you have; but overall it's solid. Just some audio mix levels just need to be shifted a little better so everything has a stronger flow. The song you picked is quite energetic; so I'm looking forward to the final result.

comeonandslam,38urp0,ToiletNinjas,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:18:21 2015 UTC,"hey, the first one i ever made, so there's that, but I don't understand how it's particularly lazy, since other than matching bpm and creatively reordering sections of the song, there's not much else you can do.   I mean, i didn't just overlay the tracks, matched bpm and called it a day, i did reorder/duplicate/repeat as well.   I've looked through the sub and that's pretty much what everybody seems to be doing. What else can you do?  Changing pitch to match the keys? I can see that.  I mean there's only so much you can do to the slamjam track until it stops being slam jam, in my opinion."

Even if it's your first and not a masterpiece it's still a great idea. I think you should try and time the two choruses separately so they aren't singing at the same time. That's my preference anyways.

Other suggestions: use the yellow curved text style from the Space Jam site's navigation buttons to display the site name, and use some more of those sweet planet icons (and jammin' mid-90s lingo).

comeonandslam,34zjek,Flashynuff,2,Wed May 6 14:13:14 2015 UTC,"It just doesn't suit me. Although the idea behind this css is a really great throwback, it isn't visually appealing at all. But I'm also a fan of simplicity (I really like /r/amiibo 's css for example) so feel free to disregard my opinion, I guess. It was also really nice of whoever created the css to donate it to the sub so I'm not complaining either.  What I don't approve though is that we can't see videos previews anymore."

comeonandslam,349tdy,AfroNinja117,3,Wed Apr 29 22:04:31 2015 UTC,"This is so close to being excellent. Some suggestions: overlapping lyrics are difficult to do right. Cut out the Space Jam chorus girls. The second verse REALLY clashes. When in doubt, cut one out. There are a couple parts where the background music of both clash, first instance is in first verse.    That all standing, it's still damn good and a valiant effort!"

comeonandslam,33zwyr,mcpower_,5,Mon Apr 27 07:09:33 2015 UTC,"First listen: sounds great! I don't know half the songs, but it sounds pretty coherent.   There are double-vocals at 1:11, but they are distinctly different in terms of pitch and Gangnam Style's vocals are notably different to the english vocals. Another instance of double vocals are at 2:56, but the low vocals of Space Jam and high vocals of whatever song you're mixing makes them pretty clear.  One minor thing is that you used the ""ah haa"" drumbeat for when you used Space Jam percussion. The ""ah haa"" drumbeat is significantly more percussion-heavy than the others, which is fair, but the ""ah haa"" itself seemed like it was clashing a tiny bit, especially with other female vocals. Even with so, I didn't notice the ""ah haa""s after listening for a while when you used other songs.  Other than these very small complaints, really good mashup."
comeonandslam,33zwyr,Dapplegonger,1 point,Mon Apr 27 09:46:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the feedback! It's really helpful. The Ah haa part was a little dificult as I'm not the best with eq's. It was hard enough trying to make Timber sound much more fuller.

comeonandslam,33owqr,Warskull,4,Fri Apr 24 22:19:25 2015 UTC,"There was a game for the SNES called ""Barkley Shut up and Jam!""  It was a decent game, fairly good graphics for the time.  However, the title was very memorable.  It (along with Space Jam) inspired a fan made RPG titled ""Barkley Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden.""  The soundtrack was all Space Jam remixes.  It very much popularized the idea of Space Jam remixes.  The game is legendary."
comeonandslam,33owqr,HulkThoughts,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:57:47 2015 UTC,"The real reason is because he's so much more irrelevant than Jordan. Jordan is much more of a known figure, so its much more humorous for it to be Barkley. It's like he was just this side character, but now he's the forced face of the entire thing, just because he's a minor player."
