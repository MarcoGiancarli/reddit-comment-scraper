SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,Shonosuke,171,Tue Jul 21 14:24:31 2015 UTC,"i think a lot of these folks don't realize that what they're dealing with is/might be really serious?? like they just think it's something normal and it's only on further inspection, with the help of sca, that ""woah ok i should see a doctor"" is realized. people who have been on sca for a while probably know a lil bit better, but there are still a whole bunch of people who get recommended here from other subs thinking that their problem must be something normal and skincare-related we can help with."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,scifiemo,73,Tue Jul 21 14:47:11 2015 UTC,"I think you're spot on. To a lot of people, skincare means just this, finding out if you can self diagnose or help yourself before going to an MD (or for some, like me, you have an MD appointment in 5 months because derm offices...).   I really don't see the point in complaining about it. It's an open skincare sub."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,babyblanka,19,Tue Jul 21 15:52:29 2015 UTC,"exactly! it's really not a big deal, especially when you take all of this into consideration. they're here for some skincare help just like the rest of us!"
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,scifiemo,82,Tue Jul 21 16:38:24 2015 UTC,"Dr costs money, internet is free. This happens all the time in vet med. People wait until the last possible second to seek medical care and by then the issue has progressed and requires more treatment, diagnostics, therapy, etc, and ends up costing the owner way more than if they came in at the beginning.  So, yeah. Anyone can seem like they know what they're talking about on the internet, and while I'm sure there are some extremely knowledgeable people here, nothing is a replacement to seeing your doctor. Your doctor knows you and your health history and can give you better advice than someone on the internet."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,rvtjess,26,Tue Jul 21 14:27:54 2015 UTC,You can also wait months for a doctor's appointment...
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,euphoryc,11,Tue Jul 21 16:24:56 2015 UTC,"And... Skin cancer is a real issue - A spot, pimple, wart, mole, or white head that does not go away can be cancer.  How often do people on the internet say ""spot treat and it will go away"" ...  schedule a doctors appt now so that if it gets worse in 1 month, you have a plan, canceling an appointment is better than dying."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,krystyin,48,Tue Jul 21 17:02:02 2015 UTC,"I understand the concern, but like you said, people are usually very good with ""see a doctor"" responses if something looks way above our pay-grade.  So really, here are the options to address your problem.  A.) Complain to the mods, and the mods become more diligent removing these sorts of posts. As for the user? We have no idea if they will see a doctor or keep trying home remedies from Pinterest and make it worse.  B.) People continue posting, and we continue telling them to go see a doctor. At least they're getting outside feedback to tell them to see a doctor, when previously they might've been more reluctant to do it.  Personally, I prefer option B."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,toxik0n,45,Tue Jul 21 15:10:27 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, many people (I am thinking of the United States since that's where I live), don't have access to unlimited, affordable healthcare. Even with good insurance, a dermatologist visit is not always covered if it doesn't meet the ""medical"" requirements set by the insurance agency, since insurance often specifically states that they do not cover what they consider to be ""aesthetic"" complaints. For someone with bare bones insurance, or no insurance, they may not have the ability to get to a doctor, so they turn to the Internet to find out what's wrong or to troubleshoot what they consider to be non-life-threatening issues. Many people still don't know what a staph infection looks like, or that they should seek immediate medical attention for one. Since things like that can start out small and only causing localized pain, they turn to SCA.  Most people are pretty good about pointing out that someone should see physician assistance for anything that looks chronic or serious (including moderate to severe acne), but the reality is still that not everyone has reasonable access to doctors."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,privatecaboosey,5,Tue Jul 21 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"Primary care physicians would be able to diagnose and treat a lot of the skin infections and other conditions people ask about on here. As would physicians or nurse practitioners at urgent care centers, free community clinics, walk-in clinics, or student health centers on campus."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,Sallycat727,5,Tue Jul 21 15:29:19 2015 UTC,"-.- saw a GP to get help with a known skin condition I have and his response was ""well I don't know anything about that - you need to see your derm."" And now I'm getting a $200 bills in the mail from him for literally nothing. So pissed."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,shewhoentangles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah frankly I'm fed up with the derm because, since my insurance views almost everything skin related as a cosmetic issue, I pay tons out of pocket for tiny amounts of topical medications which may or may not work. Unless I have a serious issue, I'm not going to the derm."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,biryanii,5,Tue Jul 21 19:25:28 2015 UTC,"/r/fitness has a rule for not asking for medical advice. I understand the important of sharing information, but in the end people should still go to all these:   Primary care physicians would be able to diagnose and treat a lot of the skin infections and other conditions people ask about on here. As would physicians or nurse practitioners at urgent care centers, free community clinics, walk-in clinics, or student health centers on campus.   There's really no good balance out there. I'm guilty of searching and asking for medical advice on here, but one should always try and go see a professional first."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,Ukhai,8,Tue Jul 21 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty reasonably priced primary physician (I think), but it still costs me $100 to walk in the door. Then if I need something like (generic) anti biotics, it costs $20-$30 more. Plus another $100 for the follow up To some people that's nothing. To others $230 out of their pocket means they don't make rent that month."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,MissPippi,6,Tue Jul 21 16:54:04 2015 UTC,"I understand that. I guess where I'm coming from is that I'm a grad student with limited income, bare bones insurance (because that's all I could afford), and a chronic disease that means I need to see a specialist every 3 months.  Yes, things would be 1000x easier with good insurance and money. But, with a lot of creativity it is possible to keep health costs down. For example, I can get my required lab work done at my student health center instead of the doctor's office and save ~$100-$150. It requires me to spend a lot more time and effort coordinating between the two, but in my experience doctors are very understanding of different situations and willing to find solutions if they can.  The reason I listed out all those options is so that someone who maybe thought they don't have any real access to a doctor might see an option they hadn't thought of."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,Sallycat727,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:38 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Those are awesome options for people who they are available to. People should definitely look into any ways to bring down the cost of their out of pocket expenses. Most notably by avoiding ER and Urgent Care centers unless it's something that really can't wait for an appointment.
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,MissPippi,6,Tue Jul 21 18:22:45 2015 UTC,Did you not read her post?
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,optogirl,8,Tue Jul 21 15:35:38 2015 UTC,"Yes. She said that insurance might not cover dermatology appointments and that people with bare-bones insurance or no insurance may not have access to doctors.   All the things I listed are alternatives to seeing a dermatologist. They are also generally less expensive if you cannot afford a ""traditional"" in-office doctor appointments."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,Sallycat727,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, so what about the ppl with no insurance?"
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,optogirl,4,Tue Jul 21 16:01:02 2015 UTC,"Pharmacist, nurse, free walk in clinics and so on. Any medical/ health professional is better than totally unqualified people on the internet. Many conditions have very similar looking differential diagnoses and we cannot even examine the issue in person or run any tests.  What we should be doing on SCA is limited to suggesting/ recommending cosmetic actives/ products to treat or as an adjunct to prescription only products for already diagnosed/ provisionally diagnosed skin conditions.  Whilst it is important to remember that not everyone has access to a free doctor, it is also important to remember than many do or that a dermatologist is not the only route to medical care."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,Firefox7275,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:00:59 2015 UTC,The suggestions apply to both people with bare bones insurance and no health insurance.
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,Sallycat727,5,Tue Jul 21 16:12:27 2015 UTC,AFAIK they would still crazy overcharge ppl w no insurance
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,optogirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:15 2015 UTC,"Community clinics or free health clinics would not. Doctors are generally willing to negotiate payment or give discounts to patients with no insurance if they are asked. If you are a college student, prices for the student health center are generally inexpensive because every student pays a fee that helps subsidize the cost."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,Sallycat727,33,Tue Jul 21 16:23:27 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering what you think should be on the sub?   In the past few days there is a lot of meta discussion about what we're not allowed to talk about - so what would be here, then?   Someone thinks they have dry skin, or rosacea, or acne, but then feels bad about posting because of complaints like this.   I'm just wondering what the solution is. Don't post until you've been to an ER to confirm that it's acne? Don't post until you have a routine that works 100% without any friendly advice from anyone else? Definitely don't mention adverse events from tanning...   This is getting silly. Everything skincare. Everyone is included, if they feel as if they're following the rules, I don't see the issue."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,babyblanka,8,Tue Jul 21 16:34:52 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more and honestly posts with the tone of OPs are why I'm so glad I found the asian beauty sub. Theyre very kind and helpful and don't get short when people ask for help.
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,biryanii,6,Tue Jul 21 16:55:54 2015 UTC,"Yup, as soon as I found AB I pretty much was done with SCA. People here are so put upon by having a post appear! Why?! Unsubscribe if you don't wanna see stuff! I want to see people having skin-care successes and I want to help people having skin-care trouble. I love when newbies get into it -- and newbies have questions! (Which is the only reason why I'm still subscribed here.) This kind of meta post just makes my head hurt. Why bother if people annoy you so much?!"
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,silliestsloth,4,Tue Jul 21 18:38:48 2015 UTC,"I think OP is talking about non acne related issues. Like, ""I have had this festering, weepy infection on my leg for 6 months, what should I put on it?"". /r/Dermatology exists as well as /r/AskDocs."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,GiveMeABreak25,6,Tue Jul 21 17:49:51 2015 UTC,"But it's not always that cut and dry! I posted here once about the slightest redness on my cheeks and everyone was like WTF Y U NO DOCTOR?!?! ROSACEA!  It was uneven skin tone, people. Why have a subreddit about skincare if you don't want to talk about skincare?"
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,silliestsloth,3,Tue Jul 21 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"Again, yes-skin care (can't speak about your personal experience-but, that's why we shouldn't be diagnosing) which is usually synonymous with your face/acne etc. My example I gave was things not related to acne or things going on on your face."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,GiveMeABreak25,2,Tue Jul 21 18:55:48 2015 UTC,"I read it as a little bit of both - but as many of the responses here say, not everyone knows what's what.   So, if the post (like the beard one) says that there's bad acne, that means that the OP thinks he has bad acne and nothing more. It's a learning curve. Then people explain what the problem is and move on. Again, still don't see the point in complaining about it. A lot of people post in multiple subs to get multiple lines of feedback, don't particularly see anything wrong with that either."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,babyblanka,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:58 2015 UTC,"Like I said in my comment, I don't think OP is talking about things possibly confused with acne. The beard thing was legitimate."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,GiveMeABreak25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:33 2015 UTC,It's just the common example since it just came up today. I clearly don't see this as such a looming issue as the OP does.
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,babyblanka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"A thousand times this. Sometimes subs spiral into bitch about everything mode, looks like that's where we find ourselvse now."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,Contronatura,52,Tue Jul 21 16:57:26 2015 UTC,"i think its because people think of it as a ""hey since this a subreddit about skincare maybe someone has had it and lemme know""  most of the time its just a pimple and not everyone can go to the derm/doctor for skin problems or in general so they hope someone here might have experienced what they have.  i feel its harmless really."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,ummmmnahhh,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:34:02 2015 UTC,"But it's not harmless. If someone has a bacterial or fungal infection, treating it incorrectly could make it much worse."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,Sallycat727,28,Tue Jul 21 14:37:27 2015 UTC,"Some people are more unfamiliar with what is/isn't abnormal. You definitely see a few instances of people recommending at home treatments, but the hivemind downvotes those and otherwise people generally offer speculation about what it may be and say go to the doctor.   The guy with the unhealing wound in his beard today genuinely seemed to not think his problem was as urgent as it was, coming here and hearing a chorus of voices saying he needs to go to a doctor ASAP may have saved him from doing serious damage to his body or health assuming he decides to listen.   It might be worthwhile putting a note on the sidebar about when to definitely seek urgent medical attention. Treating a fungal infection improperly is definitely a bad idea, but they're probably less likely to require a same day appointment if it isn't easily obtainable."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,bewareofunicorn,2,Tue Jul 21 14:47:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with you for cases when it looks really bad, the hive mind is generally good about recommending medical treatment ASAP.  However, there are always a ton of posts in the new queue about weird rashes that never go away or spots that showed up overnight. At least my experience on the sub has been that those posts don't get much attention and the recommendations are usually things like neosporin or cortisone cream.  There really needs to be something in the sidebar about medical advice and when to seek professional medical treatment. I know that the mods removed the rule barring medical advice, but they really need to give some direction about the whole issue."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,Sallycat727,9,Tue Jul 21 15:04:16 2015 UTC,"This is just a possibility, but people may not realize that what they have is a lesion or staph. If we're trained to think red bumps on our face are acne, then that's what they're gonna think."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,katniqp,22,Tue Jul 21 15:51:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think that it happens super often? Correct me if I'm wrong, but while there are certainly some cases, most pictures here are just pictures of acne (at different levels of seriousness). And for those cases, I'd rather them post here and just be told to go to a doctor then not post at all and wait even longer. Cuz they must not realize that they should seek medical help, which is totally understandable. Skin is weird. shrug"
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,EverythingIsAHat,5,Tue Jul 21 14:56:48 2015 UTC,"You need to consider that not every person on Reddit has access to even the most basic health care....sometimes asking strangers on the internet is the only way to get an answer or make a decision on how to move forward. Your viewpoint is one of privilege and while I can understand that your rant is coming from a place of concern, you can't condemn people just because they might not have the same options as you do."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,she-huulk,15,Tue Jul 21 18:39:20 2015 UTC,"Must be nice to live in a situation where ""just go to the doctor"" is an option. Hate to break it to you but that's not the case for many people."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,Contronatura,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"Serious question though: so what happens when someone here ""diagnoses"" an infection, possible cancer or other infection? So, they don't go to the doctor. So, how have we helped with that?"
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,GiveMeABreak25,16,Tue Jul 21 17:52:22 2015 UTC,"OP, I think this is much more appropriate for this sub. I would prefer this sub to be about actually helping people than a congratulations circlejerk. Seriously, the top post on this thread is almost always a ""before and after, my skin is now perfect"" image album. OK, that's great, but that person no longer needs assistance. Then posts for advice get buried."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,mmencius,11,Tue Jul 21 16:26:05 2015 UTC,"Saying people shouldn't be asking in the first place strikes me as very harsh. If someone doesn't know what's wrong, they don't know it's something too serious to ask the internet about. If they do know what's wrong, then they'd go to the doctor and not ask here. So the only people posting questions like that are the people who don't realize they have something serious and are most in need of more information. It's a bit of a catch 22, which is not a situation in which we want to put people with serious health problems and insufficient information to treat them!"
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,eukomos,13,Tue Jul 21 16:29:48 2015 UTC,"Are you telling me you have never showed something to a friend and asked, ""What is this?""   Or described your sickness feelings to decide if a doctor's visit is warranted?  Obviously we are not doctors. Obviously people know they really ought to see a doctor for a doctor's opinion. But for some people, simply asking a friend (or a subreddit, which is just a lot of friends) is the casual first line of defense.  Often people just want to talk through their decision to see a doctor, which costs a lot of time and money for many people."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,bshift1,2,Tue Jul 21 16:21:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Although it's unwise to give medical advice, I can't imagine the last time I didn't mention an ailment to my friend/coworkers. Sometimes you need to hear, ""you need to see a doctor"" before you take it seriously."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,Bitey_McSharkerson,13,Tue Jul 21 19:01:21 2015 UTC,"I agree. I hesitate to reference the ""old"" SCA, but I think the ban on asking for medical advice was prudent. Anything with considerable facial swelling/open wound etc is not for a skincare forum to deal with. It's for a medical/derm professional. There are lots of databases with photos and information on the serious cases (which probably also tell you to see a medical professional) and if you can Reddit you can find the information online posted by institutions, not the random (but lovely) people of SCA. For less serious/urgent things, like maybe asking about product irritation vs. rosacea, that's fine.        SCA is ""Everything skincare!"" not ""everything that could ever happen with skin and skin diseases ever."" Edit: wording"
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,melorga,4,Tue Jul 21 16:47:28 2015 UTC,"Have you just never had problems with doctors before? It sure sounds like it. First off, it's not easy for everyone to even have access to derms, because of wait times and insurance and whatnot.   More importantly, I'm not sure if it's just where I live, but every single time there's been something wrong with me it's been a nightmare trying to get an accurate diagnosis. I had a fungal infection a couple years ago that got really bad because after visiting 3 separate doctors about it, none of them realized what it really was and they gave me medicine that made it even worse. I finally found a doctor who didn't have their head up their ass and got it fixed, but by that time I had had an embarrassing, extremely painful rash on my face for about a month. In hindsight, I feel like if I had just posted a picture here then it could've been identified sooner. Maybe, maybe not. I also self diagnosed myself with keratosis pilaris from the information on this sub, and it's improving thanks to the recommendations I read on this sub. Again, this is something that multiple doctors,  including a derm, failed to diagnose. The derm wanted to put me on antibiotics for the rest of my life because he thought it was allergies. I'm not dumb so I realized that was a bad idea and just thought I had to live with it. It's thanks to this sub that I don't.   So what I'm saying is,  it's important to remember that rarely is anything truly black and white."
SkincareAddiction,3e2opf,akumahime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:18 2015 UTC,"I think the same. I do not have any serious issues like Akne (which should be talked about in a dermatology subreddit), but just oily skin, which I want to control.  Also subscribed, I do not read the subreddit anymore, cause it is mostly before/after pics of dermatological diseases.  Edit: Another thing that annoys me even more is the circle jerk about certain brands, which feel like 4-5 people are bought by those companies and repeat the marketing slogans and promises (I am looking at you Paulas Choice)."

When looking in the mirror, stand as far away as you would when you're talking to someone, or at a meeting with someone, or whatever.   This is generally what they see.   When we look at ourselves, we lean in and pick apart and get very detailed. Generally speaking, most interactions don't happen that way, you know?   Also, I've had bad skin for years and years, sometimes my friends will tell me that I look great because compared to my former skin, I really do look great!

SkincareAddiction,3e311s,babyblanka,5,Tue Jul 21 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"Not only this, but take note of the lighting in which you are looking at your face? Bathroom lights tend to be bright (the better to see you with, my dear) but that kind of lighting is hardly ever used in other settings because it is so exposing (think restaurants, bowling alleys, homes). Be careful to not judge yourself too harshly when you have bright light hitting you from every angle, because as soon as you step out of the bathroom you step into much more flattering light."

I think maybe that's our cue to sit down, take a deep breath, and try to summon a little confidence if we can. :) It's rough living in a world that judges us so harshly based on how we look, but if you're getting consistent feedback that your skin actually looks pretty great, it might be a good idea to try to internalize some of that positive message."

Whenever my friends see me without makeup, they think I have pretty normal skin, but all I see is my huge pores, tons of closed comedones, and PIH. I think this is caused by 2 things. 1, People tend to be much harder on themselves than they are on other people. I almost never notice notice when someone I'm talking to has mild acne, but as soon as I have a single whitehead, it needs to die and getitoffmyfaceNOW. 2, we tend to look at our face at a much closer distance than anybody else will. The only time I really see my bare face is before I put my makeup on, from my vanity mirror that's like 6 inches away from my face, plus a magnified mirror on the other side (that thing is the devil.) No one is that up close and personal with my bare face, ever. So all the ""imperfections"" I notice are practically undetectable to someone that is a few feet away from me.

SkincareAddiction,3dzw5n,eatingham,98,Tue Jul 21 16:33:05 2015 UTC,I suspect a bit of laser work there.
SkincareAddiction,3dzw5n,bluesky557,29,Mon Jul 20 22:50:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, some cosmetic procedures definitely seem suspect here!"

SkincareAddiction,3dzw5n,jlesnick,15,Mon Jul 20 23:42:13 2015 UTC,Are we against those procedures here? It seems like just another way to make skin look healthier.

SkincareAddiction,3dzw5n,Nowin,3,Tue Jul 21 03:49:03 2015 UTC,I'm not saying that he hasn't had work done... but it's not really that abnormal for someone to have very little to no loose skin around the age of 52. If anything I'd just suspect that he might have had fillers under his eyes.
SkincareAddiction,3dzw5n,bewareofunicorn,2,Tue Jul 21 15:31:20 2015 UTC,"He's only 50. Maybe he doesn't drink to excess, gets enough sleep, and wears sunscreen."

SkincareAddiction,3dzw5n,lackingagency,10,Tue Jul 21 03:40:06 2015 UTC,I've never seen true anti-cosmetic procedure rhetoric here. In fact I think people generally seem curious and just like to speculate/observe possible results on different people/skin types. We had a Botox thread a few weeks ago that was very positive.
SkincareAddiction,3dzw5n,jmgree,2,Tue Jul 21 05:10:12 2015 UTC,"Not at all. If I had the money, I'd be all over lasers! But to point it out is to say that just sunscreen and moisturizer alone will probably not make you look that good at 52."
SkincareAddiction,3dzw5n,bluesky557,6,Tue Jul 21 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"I dunno, but it's fun to speculate. But celebrities, especially an older lot, probably do a facial before an event, so it's hard to judge a good PS from a good facial and makeup (and lighting + photoshop). Lol  I clocked a lower facelift and maybe a cheek augmentation with a filler or fat. Which I think looks great. I think there is a belief in plastic surgery circles that an early facelift/necklift is very practical, from what I can tell."
SkincareAddiction,3dzw5n,lackingagency,7,Mon Jul 20 23:50:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's anything wrong with plastic surgery. If he has had work done (I suspect he has, but all that is is my own suspicion), the work he's had done looks amazing. What does make me sad is when there's bad plastic surgery, because it encourages ""corrective"" plastic surgery that often winds up complicating, instead of fixing, the problem."

I doubt that he wakes up in the morning 365 days a year looking like that."
SkincareAddiction,3dzw5n,nursebad,14,Tue Jul 21 15:03:32 2015 UTC,Is it very odd that I find his smooth skin unnerving? It seems he has a little bit of babyface with the facial structure and it's just a bit uncanny valley with the grey hair.
SkincareAddiction,3dzw5n,eisenkatze,39,Mon Jul 20 22:31:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe a tad controversial, but maybe it's because the ""beauty standard"" for men, especially as they get older, is to be a little more rugged looking. For instance, Daniel Craig played one of the most dashing characters in cinema, and no one would describe him as looking youthful. Maybe from the neck down, but other than that...  I would speculate that if we were looking at a woman who had smooth skin and kind of a baby face while rocking the gray hair we would think that she looks really nice for her age."

SkincareAddiction,3e0gtc,JimiEnt,5,Tue Jul 21 14:14:05 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, there are definitely areas where smoking among teens is very prevalent and considered ""cool"". However, teen smoking rates in general have been steadily declining for a few decades, with the lowest point being the last two years.  This article suggests that while cigarette smoking has gone down for high schoolers, cigar smoking has become quite ""cool"". It possibly does have soke correlation with lack of or under-education, as states like West Virginia has almost a 20% rate of smoking, where as other states like Alaska, Florida, and New York have rates under 12%."
SkincareAddiction,3e0gtc,lynxnloki,4,Tue Jul 21 14:31:52 2015 UTC,"The other thing folks don't seem to be aware of is there appears to be correlation between smoking and income level. Which might explain higher smoking rates in poor states like WV. Low-income folks don't smoke because they think it's ""cool"" or are ""uneducated"" (at this point nobody is unaware that smoking is bad for us) -- they smoke because it's a cheap way to relieve stress when you have no time to take a vacation and no money to see a doctor. :/"
SkincareAddiction,3e0gtc,swampdebutante,3,Tue Jul 21 17:22:48 2015 UTC,"That is a pretty broad brush.  I have 3 boys and they think smoking is old fashioned, and smokers are idiots - which kind of sucks since their grandfather is a smoker."
SkincareAddiction,3e0gtc,hippopotapants,3,Tue Jul 21 14:31:21 2015 UTC,"My 6 year old nephew found out recently that I used to smoke - I quit a year or so ago. His response was ""doesn't that mean you'll get lymphoma??"" I had zero idea where he came up with 'lymphoma' but I had a really hard time responding. First, I didn't want to frighten him into thinking I was definitely going to get cancer. ""Well, I'm 27, so having quit so young means there's a really good chance I'll never get sick from it."" But I also didn't want him thinking smoking wasn't a big deal. It was a hard conversation to have, I needed an adult."
SkincareAddiction,3e0gtc,britneymisspelled,3,Tue Jul 21 14:59:49 2015 UTC,"Yep - kids are pretty well-versed in the reasons not to smoke.  I know my kids went through the DARE program,  but even before that they would come home talking about the reasons not to smoke.  My father-in-law is a chimney,  and the boys are just repulsed.  Last year they saw my brother (who is in his 30s) smoking and told me ""I thought he was smart - it really changed the way I look at him.""  We had to sit down and have a conversation about people making personal decisions,  and how it isn't always directly related to their IQ. Like you - I am glad they don't want to smoke,  so I don't want to discourage their line of thinking entirely,  but I also don't want them making big sweeping character judgements based on one poor choice."
SkincareAddiction,3e0gtc,hippopotapants,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:05 2015 UTC,"Accurate though, so many teenagers still smoke and a surprising amount of university students smoke. Thankfully smoking is in decline but it's still considered cool to some people."

I went on vacation once to the Caribbean as a part of a large group and there were some people who would actively avoid all sun activities.   They passed on the  snorkeling,  the beaching,  the ocean stuff and stuck to the evening activities.   I'm like come on.   How much of your life are you missing out on?

SkincareAddiction,3e0gtc,CaptainCatbee,9,Tue Jul 21 13:08:27 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you.  Tanning does increase the risk of skin cancer.  It is definitely something you would not want to do everyday.    That being said, I think its worth assessing your own individual risk and evaluate the life experiences you are forgoing in order to avoid the sun.  Actively tanning everyday is a poor decision, but it cannot be held to the same level as tanning once in a while.  (Like going snorkeling or tanning a picture on your back.)  Also, the parts of the population that do naturally tan have a significant lower incidence of skin cancer.  For example, Caucasian males have a incident rate for melanoma of 13 per 100,000.  The incident rate for Asians is 0.2-0.8 per 100,000 and the incident rate for Black folks is 0.6-2.6 per 100,000. Source.  Melanin blocks the absorption of UV rays through the skin and those with naturally more melanin are more resistant to the sun's carcinogenic and aging effects.  Source  All I am trying to say is that tanning=skin cancer/ aging is a very simplistic view on a complex topic.  There are many factors that contribute to these effects.    Also, I think that while avoiding unnecessary sun exposure is good for all people, I do believe that one should evaluate the risks and compare that to the life experiences that they may be missing out on.  Don't go tanning every single day, but don't miss an opportunity to swim along a reef either."

Oftentimes one cosmetic product or gadget alone gives minimal results. Check out the free and comprehensive guide on the Owndoc website.  I microneedle for anti ageing but have been lazy a while now. This is in addition to a solid routine containing sunscreen, retinol, vitamin C and niacinamide, plus trying to balance internal intake of nutrients."

It's only the last year or so I have noticed, and it isn't wrinkles which fuss me- they are a sign of a life well lived, it's the bloody sagging, I am starting to look like deputy dawg. It isn't easy as I am exposed to the elements quite a bit, although I am pretty fit and eat very well..."
SkincareAddiction,3e3ano,Firefox7275,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:26 2015 UTC,"You might try facial exercises, some swear by that for sagging. But you definitely need to get a handle on sun protection: broad brimmed hats, applying and reapplying broad spectrum sunscreen,switching up your lifestyle to spend more time in the shade or only in the sun early and late in the day. Microneedling won't work where collagen and elastin are still being destroyed. And I certainly would not go the AHA route, being photosensitising."

SkincareAddiction,3e3ano,n1jntje,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe further clean up your diet, the more exercise you get the more of every nutrient you need: minerals, vitamins, essential fatty acids, antioxidants. Loads of oily fish, other seafood such as molluscs, whole eggs, low sugar fruit and non starchy veg in the full rainbow of bright and dark colours. Minimise sugar and processed/ high glycaemic index carbs because they may contribute to glycation.  Sadly a tan confers a very low level of protection. Apply and reapply the full recommended amount of that sunscreen. Various antioxidants support the role of sunscreen, check out the ingredients Wiki at /r/skincareaddictionUK/"

SkincareAddiction,3e3ano,n1jntje,2,Tue Jul 21 19:55:34 2015 UTC,"I just ordered a dermaroller and used it for the first time last night! It's generally discouraged on this sub because if you don't know what you're doing you can do more harm than good, but I've watched a ton of youtube videos and read a lot of info, and I'm only using a 0.5 mm roller. I'm only using it on my forehead where I have some scarring from picking my skin, so not for wrinkles, but it's supposed to be really good for that especially with larger needle sizes.   I use a vitamin C serum right after because the dermaroller boosts absorption, and it soothes your skin nicely. After my first use I don't notice any diminishing of my scars but I plan to use it 3x a week. You do notice some plumping and a bit more radiance as the skin renews itself by the next morning. Be sure to sanitize and look over your roller for any damaged or bent needles before you use it because this can damage your skin.  My best advice would be just to read as much as you can about it and decide which roller size is best for you, you may want to start smaller and work your way up if you don't notice any results. 0.5 mm and smaller can be used up to 3x a week, while larger sizes only should be used 2-3 times a month."
SkincareAddiction,3e3ano,lunchboxthermos,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:57 2015 UTC,"Much of the YouTube stuff is out of date, check out the free and comprehensive Owndoc guide.  You don't need increased penetration of a well formulated C serum, for example research suggests a 15% CE ferulic achieves skin saturation in just a few days. Be careful which product you choose, you are increasing the penetration of ALL the ingredients including those that have no business IN the skin."

SkincareAddiction,3e39dj,khoobam,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:00 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely choose sunscreen over walking with an umbrella. Sunscreen would be so much less of a hassle! With a good SPF 30+ broad spectrum sunscreen and sunglasses, you should have no fear of going outside.  If you're wary of chemicals, choose a good physical sunscreen (it'll say physical on the bottle, and you can still get broad spectrum protection). The ones made for babies are often physical and very ""low-chemical"", if you're worried about that. Since you're going to be putting sunscreen on the baby anyway for beach or park visits, I really don't see the harm in protecting yourself now."
SkincareAddiction,3e39dj,restlessgrad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:30 2015 UTC,Your options are to prevent more damage are to 1) wear sunscreen or 2) become a vampire. Try the Asian sunscreens and I think you'll change your mind about the 'feel' part of wearing it.

I've found that it is pretty good at resurfacing the skin- it will take a while but it helps a lot.  Some of my smaller scars are gone (I've been using it for years)  For very deep scars there are techniques derms use to reduce the scarring, but for over the counter I'd recommend the GA."

SkincareAddiction,3e2sk7,EverythingIsAHat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:54:04 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, ""fast"" and ""acne scar removal"" hardly ever go hand in hand. And it sucks ha :( Check out the sidebar post about PIH for some recommendations. I agree with another poster that glycolic acid has been a big help, and there are other ways as well."
SkincareAddiction,3e2sk7,EverythingIsAHat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:51:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help. What are the other ways? Just wondering.
SkincareAddiction,3e2sk7,Lyannis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:45 2015 UTC,"https://reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/pih  Here's the link I mentioned for a great (and I think recently updated! Yay!) run-down of all the ways that you can try to get rid of scarring. You'll see that the first thing listed there is sunscreen, which sounds like a pain but is very important. Sun makes your skin darker, and that's what you're trying to avoid! Plus, you basically can't use treatments like glycolic acid without wearing sunscreen every day.  Read through the page, and let me know if you have any other queries :)"
SkincareAddiction,3e2sk7,AnnieB25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:24:04 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for the help! Sunscreen would be new because I live in a sunny country but never bothered putting sunscreen on.
SkincareAddiction,3e2sk7,PrincessCate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"Oh the horror!! lol, I think we're kind of on the same page, I also live in a sunny/hot as f**k country and I never bothered to use sunscreen until a year and a half ago. I have a hole patch of acne scars and pih in my right cheek, and I don't have the money to do a microdermabrasion, so for now, I have to suck it up and embrace it (good luck that my worst scar lies in a dimple that I have, so it mostly falls unnoticed). Good luck on your journey and have patience ;)"
