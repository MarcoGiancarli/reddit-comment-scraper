People are welcome to fill out the 2nd and 3rd tabs so we can try to aim for car/track combos where everyone has the content.   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aI7qONG6NKbUZbGbrOT3gWFjcnQHjLP7Bvk5KUPnsxY/edit?usp=sharing  Edit: Google Doc is now available for anyone to view/edit

iRacing,3e3leu,Brewer74,2,Tue Jul 21 20:57:37 2015 UTC,That could work. Maybe just start with a Thread each Monday that has the Track/Car/Weather combo and people can post times. We'll see if it grows?
iRacing,3e3leu,WhyDoISuckAtW2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:49:15 2015 UTC,Would there be a gentlemen's agreement to use the iR baseline setup? I see the first two times are using the baseline (or at least they say they are.)
iRacing,3e3leu,RogueRAZR,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:03:28 2015 UTC,That's a good point. Fixed or open? It may be a bit of work verifying the times too. I'm am keen however. Would be a good way of competing against racers from other timezones too
iRacing,3e3leu,DeathbyAndy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:20:16 2015 UTC,Open should have the requirement that you share the setup when you post a fast time!
iRacing,3e3leu,tstraw48,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:46:47 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I'm thinking. Open set ups but you must share if you make tweaks. It will also be on the honor system. Prizes are only T-Shirts and Stickers so people don't get out of hand.

iRacing,3e5w9v,Stokealona,2,Wed Jul 22 05:01:00 2015 UTC,"Basically they're tracks they've scanned but don't have time to finish because of bigger, more profitable projects.  Here's a post from Tony about techtracks.  Because of demand, often from real-world drivers for testing, one of the things we are talking about doing is creating a new section or brand in the track section of web site area called ""tech tracks"".   In this section we would have driveable point cloud versions of tracks that members could buy for say $5 bucks (price to be determined). Then, if and when we release a fully finished version of track we would take away tech version of track and issue a $5 credit or whatever it sold for to whoever bought it they could use the credit to put towards finished version of track. (If they wanted or could use credit for something else)   We would not use tech tracks for any official racing FYI. The only tracks we would release as tech tracks are tracks that are scanned and production work done to make them ""driveable"" yet they are not on an immediate list to get finished. We absolutely would not make a track we are working on and plan to finish in near term a tech track for example like a Montreal, Kansas, California or Bathurst. Also some contracts will not allow us to release tracks unless finished.   Examples of possible tech tracks would be Long Beach, Moroso, Willow Springs, NJ, Miller, etc.  Again not to say that we are not going to build these tracks, just for one reason or another not in immediate plans and again the above are just examples as we have these tracks in close to driveable states.   On a side note, we do hope and at this point planning to work heavily on Long Beach next year but like everything, that is subject to change.   We might start with Long Beach as first Tech Track in next build. If you have no interest in this, just ignore it as not impacting anything else and like I said for various reasons, some members have interest in testing on these tracks and things like that. Maybe privately would even want to race on or something."
iRacing,3e5w9v,TannerMcC,4,Wed Jul 22 05:16:57 2015 UTC,"Also this post was from 2013, so as you can see they planned to finish Long Beach in 2014.. then the ring came along, now le mans... etc etc etc"
iRacing,3e5w9v,TannerMcC,2,Wed Jul 22 05:19:00 2015 UTC,"too bad, I love racing on Long beach. It's a lot of fun with the Star Mazda"
iRacing,3e5w9v,Alibambam,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:01:12 2015 UTC,I understand why we have test tracks. I was just wondering the specific reasons why they never finished them two tracks.
iRacing,3e5w9v,TannerMcC,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:32:15 2015 UTC,I figured the post answered that... Long beach and nj were not licensed to be released only upon completion. Other more important tracks came up that will be more profitable. So they release uncompleted tracks  so they can get some money for the work they put in. Then move on to their money makers with plans to finish these tracks when they have time. (Won't be soon with LeMans)
iRacing,3e5w9v,bouncebackability,3,Wed Jul 22 06:00:08 2015 UTC,"New Jersey I can understand, but I really think they've missed out massively with not finishing Long Beach. it would be great to have a proper street circuit on iracing."
iRacing,3e5w9v,SOGorman35,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:17:33 2015 UTC,"New Jersey I'd have to imagine just doesn't hold the level of interest to justify putting development into when tracks like Monza, Nurburgring, Le Mans, etc. are or were on the agenda.  It was always my understanding (and someone correct me if I'm wrong) that the issue with Long Beach was that the number of buildings surrounding the track was too complex and would be too demanding of a system to be able to display smoothly."
iRacing,3e5w9v,namnamhars,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:22:23 2015 UTC,I might be wrong but I seem to remember reading somewhere that they were planning on finishing Long Beach in the future some time. Can't find where I read it though.
iRacing,3e5w9v,GTVIRUS,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:25:27 2015 UTC,"Long beach required too much development time, as the amount of unique buildings needed to be modeled pushed the time required to approx. 3x a normal track.

After rookies promotions only occur every 12 weeks. However you can speed this up by getting your safety rating above 4.0 at which point once your mpr is complete you get promoted straight away  cup cars i believe are an A licence series."

If your goal plain and simple is to get to Sprint Cup, then run as many clean races as you can and get your SR up to B 4.0 and you're there. However, from what I've heard, it's likely you won't have much success as you're going to be in a very powerful car with very fast competition, and you may be overwhelmed. Take this with a grain of salt as I'm in D, but I'm taking my time, learning slowly as I go working my way up. This way, when I do get there, the learning curve may not be as steep for me, as I'll have learned about setups and familiar with the tracks, etc...

I hate the short tracks, so only did a few races that week. Back to Charlotte, and didn't qualify, so I would start near the back, hung around in 7th to 10th place and wait for the inevitable crash up ahead. Within 2 days I was D class level. Ran a couple of races at Bristol, again stayed back near the end, earned enough SR to get D4.0. Now worked my way up to B 3.70 and should have my B4.0 pretty soon to get my A licence.  I prefer the faster longer tracks for Nascar type vehicles, but absolutely love the short tracks in Indy. If I was you, look at the schedules coming up for the cars you want to run, try and get your licence up using the cheapest possible means, then choose the route you want to tack to get you higher. The trucks in C class are great fun, but at times can be difficult to control...  OH If you don't want to race to get your MPR, you can do time trials. They also give you a little bit of SR, as long as you don't crash etc.  No matter what, get out there and have fun, be a clean driver and be a gracious winner and loser!"

I've been on iRacing for a couple of years now, and as long as I've been here they have offered a half-off membership deal twice a year - once in the summer and once in the winter. I have no reason to believe they won't continue to do that.  So once you're a member, you can take advantage of that deal when it comes up again. There's no reason to pay any more than $49 a year for a membership.  p.s. If you're talking about Steam, then I have no idea. I'm talking about on the site itself."
iRacing,3dz8yk,Sasken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Great info ... have they offered this existing members half-off deal yet this summer?  I didn't go thru Steam. It made no sense: more expensive and the site gives you Steam keys, if you want them."
iRacing,3dz8yk,Sasken,2,Mon Jul 20 19:35:22 2015 UTC,Yeah the most recent half-off deal ended June 30. So your timing isn't great. The next one is usually Black Friday (I'm not sure what the date for that is; I'm not American). So you might have to pay for a few months before it comes up again.
iRacing,3dz8yk,HerpDerpenberg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:43:11 2015 UTC,"YMMV,  but I still renewed my membership for half off after the 30th because I forgot about it. The codes expire but they typically are bad at disabling them on time. So if you find old codes,  give them a try first."
iRacing,3dz8yk,ZeeNewAccount,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:13:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, they had the half price deal up last month and it was up for a few weeks, but it appears to be over now. The thing is when it comes up you can purchase more than 1 year at that price if you want."

iRacing,3dyu8x,iFap4DaytonaCoupes,3,Mon Jul 20 19:34:20 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. I've called their customer service support line several times and they were incredibly cooperative and helpful. I've also had an experience with one of their writers from InRacingNews who flipped his shit and tried to crash into everyone in the race, and they were super helpful and communicative about the suspension process and how I go about submitting a protest I didn't even want to make but felt I had to for the sake of the crazy motherfucker who snapped and went insane (he was litterally swearing at everyone and threatening people saying that he worked for iRacing and that he would have us all banned... it was like nothing I could conceive of....) P.S. for the record I wasn't the one who downvoted you TannerMcC"
iRacing,3dyu8x,TannerMcC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:50:14 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with being downvoted.  In my experience iRacing customer service has been very poor. When I've had them completely ignore technically issue emails. Things like getting black flags for illegally entering/exiting pit roads when you don't even go near pit road. A simple ""it's a known issue"" would mean the world. Otherwise i just feel ignored.  In addition their lack of communication and inconsistency on big things is worrying as well. The NIS the last 2 weeks had the completely wrong settings the first night of races (cautions somehow were using old winston cup rules). Instead of posting on the forums saying it was fixed, or even letting uses know they were aware of the issue ti was up to us to communicate among ourselves what was going on. They responded to 1 or 2 peoples support emails and they were the ones who had to let everyone else know what was going on. Basically we had to wait until we entered the next race to know if what it was set up correctly. As far as the lack of consistency, the Daytona 500 this year was a joke. The first 4 of 7 races went off without a hitch but the 5th one caused the site to crash so they just cancelled and revoked everything. The same thing happened a week or 2 later. iRacing said nothing. On the week of Sonoma in the NIS iRacing servers were incorrectly logging users as in a race and it was causing major crashing issues. Not only did they not issue a public statement on it but they once again did nothing about the hundreds of users who were unable to race.  This stuff really bothers me. I couldn't in good conscious say to a friend ""iRacing is great"".  I guess I feel like its amazing and having one thing about it be SO bad sticks out to me."

iRacing,3dyu8x,shadowofashadow,4,Mon Jul 20 18:54:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's how it works irl. A mechanical failure is beyond the drivers fault. I've never seen someone get suspended for blowing an engine, leaving oil on the track and other cars wrecked because of it."

The damage is dictated by the the service (iRacing), currently it's rubbing DX9 and soon it will be upgraded so a better looking damage model can be presented - but let me tell you, you clip a wall running Indy, or you turn into someone in a 200mph turn at Daytona - you are going to know about it!

iRacing,3du27e,Chuk182,5,Sun Jul 19 13:51:29 2015 UTC,Your strategy in rookie street stocks should be to finish the race with 0 incidents so that you don't have to run in that cesspool anymore.  Rookie street stocks barely counts as racing.

iRacing,3du27e,SockShots68,2,Sun Jul 19 22:41:25 2015 UTC,I'm of the opinion that racing is your lowest priority in rookie races. The only way you should be passing people is by waiting for them to wreck. It's not worth the headache for a series you probably won't touch again once you're out. Just get your SR and go home. Plenty of time to rebuild your iRating later.

iRacing,3du27e,Gus_TheAnt,6,Sun Jul 19 15:28:53 2015 UTC,That's incorrect. You do get iR but it doesn't show up while you're a rookie. It's hidden but it's still being counted

iRacing,3dp9rq,IronDiggy,2,Sat Jul 18 08:26:22 2015 UTC,"Not bad, I like your transition from the black (with the water paper filter?) to blue, it gives me some ideas.  I've painted all the road cars I own, so the MX5, Solstice, SRF (though I recently noticed I only finished one side, whoops), Skippy, and the RUF.  The thing that gets me is I tend to spend 3+ hours making a change only to find that I don't like it. I've also painted a few of my cars a few times. I've honestly probably spent more time painting than I have on the track. Best $50 car painting simulator I've ever had though."
iRacing,3dp9rq,IronDiggy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:49:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure what a water paper filter is, to be honest. I'm using GIMP, not Photoshop.  In short, I templated out each part of the car as its own layer, so I can insert pictures and whatnot without having it bleed over into other parts of the car. I just duplicated layers for the sections I wanted (in this case, each side of the car is its own layer) and faded from fully opaque to fully transparent, just in opposite directions, on each one. If you put different stuff on each of those layers, it makes it ""bleed"" from one design to the other.  Regarding the 3+ hours thing, are you painting an entire car and then loading iRacing to check it out? If you are, pull up your car on the track and have Photoshop export your image to the car paint file. You can send the export without saving the base file, so if you don't like it, you can always go back. Just export, alt-tab to iRacing, move the camera, hit the texture refresh button. Saves me bunches of time and effort if I can see something's not going how I want it.  I've been racing mostly, but it's true that this is turning into a pretty expensive car painting game. =P"

Same thing is true for most of track side besides skippy.  Goddamn I love iRacing, but fuck if I don't hate it at least as much because it so rarely is able to deliver due to too small amount of racers. Please for the love of god, drop the prices, let us pick up seasons for $50 with all the cars and tracks or something similar.

If they made everything cheaper I bet a large proportion of the current player base would riot and demand refunds etc.   Personally I think the pricing is the reason the racing is so good, and my last few seasons cost less than $50. But then I like to really focus on one car only per season rather than trying to be fast in everything at the same time."
iRacing,3dpkgx,seaweeduk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:22:34 2015 UTC,"True, you don't have to invest much after you've spent a few years gathering the tracks, honestly the price of the cars is okay because you're gonna spend time on them, learn them properly and so on... My problem is that if I wanted to fully participate in one season now I'd have to buy $150 worth of tracks, next season I would only have to buy a few and it wouldn't be a huge amount then...  One suggestion I'd have is have $50 starter packs, one for oval, one for road which include all the current seasons tracks and you'd be only able to buy them once to get you properly started. Sure few people would bitch but I believe most of the player base is mature enough to understand that more active participation is better for everybody.  I don't think quality of the racing would suffer too much as long as the sim is still relatively expensive."
iRacing,3dpkgx,Annoying_Arsehole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:13:57 2015 UTC,"That $150 seems high to me, I know when I did my first season in the skippy it came to around £50, and the next seasons were cheaper maybe I was just lucky with the tracks that season or I'd purchased a few separately prior to that.   Honestly I think the tracks are worth their price anyway, when I compare iRacings representations of the tracks to other sims they are leagues ahead of the competition.   I like you starter pack idea though definitely, give people enough tracks to get 8/12 weeks or something and the Skippy or SRF. iRacing pricing only gets really scary if you want ALL the content. I don't care for oval at all, and I try to only buy cars if I intend to run a season with them."

iRacing,3dj967,racefan78,10,Thu Jul 16 18:42:29 2015 UTC,The amount of new content being announced these past few weeks is really great to see. One thing you can't say about iRacing is that they're content to rest on their laurels.
iRacing,3dj967,Eburon,6,Thu Jul 16 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"I enjoy it but am afraid it will dilute series participation even more. I'm okay with the amount of content as is, once the dynamic surface is added they really should look into improving their graphics and looking for a new influx of simracers. We need more new people."
iRacing,3dj967,Qel_Hoth,3,Fri Jul 17 00:01:50 2015 UTC,They're already heading in that direction. A new Physical Based Rendering system came out on few cars last build and should be on more next build. A new particle system is in the works as is DX11.
iRacing,3dj967,retroly,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:36:25 2015 UTC,"Remember, the more you push up the base specs the fewer people can play."
iRacing,3dj967,Eburon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:55:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about pushing up the specs, current engine is outdated and they should be able to get more out of the same hardware setup. Both graphics and physics hog more resources than they should, resulting in a lower fps. If they invest in high level devs who are able to optimize the code we would be on an amazing path. I bet you could boost graphics with at least 50% without having a frame loss. And probably 100% if you would start from scratch with some top level talent.  I am not top level talent but I do now for a fact that iRacing's hit detection could be made more reliable and while adding performance at the same time by using different techniques to calculate how cars now they're hitting each other. But that's at the core of the sim, so changing that would mean changing everything built on that principle.  This isn't easy or cheap and it might not be possible in the business plan of iRacing. But the continuously adding to a core limits you in the long run. Especially when that core has a couple of issues.  The fact that arcade racers look so much better has something to do with lack of calculations in the physics section of the game but also a lot with allocating money to their graphics section, because that is what's selling the stuff."

iRacing,3dj967,sparkblaze,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:21:44 2015 UTC,I thought this only applied to the Super GT Honda? as it's a very competitive manufacturer series out there - all the SuperGT manufacturers I think are seperated by GT300 teams in the pit lane.
iRacing,3dj967,HerpDerpenberg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:47:37 2015 UTC,"I thought it was both?  I don't see why one team being super secret wouldn't allow another team to get their car data to iRacing.  Either way, it was a PR nightmare because they announce BTCC cars and all the BTCC tracks and then a ""whoops we can't get the data"" statement."
iRacing,3dj967,Bakkster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:46:44 2015 UTC,Neither Honda nor BMW ended up providing iRacing with data on their BTCC cars. It's especially confusing because the BTCC cars have identical suspensions as provided by the series. It's weird that they'd be so secretive.
iRacing,3dj967,TheRealOEM,10,Fri Jul 17 20:24:24 2015 UTC,"This is good, but I wish they'd release an LMP1."

iRacing,3dj967,Swarley133,5,Fri Jul 17 09:00:14 2015 UTC,Fantastic news. I'm guessing the 2.0 will straight up replace the Star Mazdas and the 3.5 should be a ton of fun and offer a nice alternate series for the B license open wheel drivers.  Some great stuff coming to iRacing in the near future. Now we just need a proper touring car ladder system.
iRacing,3dj967,scottstev2708,9,Thu Jul 16 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"My worry is too many series than the population can handle. Both of these cars will have to be single-make and between Star Mazda (which could retire tbh), and Indy Fixed, there's a lot of options for open-wheel racers who don't have the time to work on the Williams set-up. THat's not even counting the vintage Lotus series.   With closed-top who could add them to either GT3, GT1 or multiclass, but I fear there'll be a lot of unofficial races in some open-wheel series."
iRacing,3dj967,HerpDerpenberg,6,Thu Jul 16 19:20:04 2015 UTC,"I think this is a legitimate concern. But the long term solution is not to limit the car choices, it's to attract new users. I think hopefully, as the amount of cars and racing disciplines available in iRacing grows, it will reach a critical mass of sorts where it begins to funnel in enough users to populate more series."
iRacing,3dj967,Bakkster,2,Thu Jul 16 19:26:26 2015 UTC,"But if there are too many races with not e ought participation,  nobody comes.  I. E.  The Kia is a good example of a great car that nobody cares about and is only surviving because it drives with the caddy in official races."
iRacing,3dj967,mmm1kko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:46:15 2015 UTC,"The Kia is the opposite: a car that would have a modest following for a few good races a week like the V8SC, Lotus, or Radical, except it's trapped with the Cadillac so you rarely find a race with more than 2 Kias. The SRF's participation struggled when it was in an MC series as well, but its participation instantly doubled when it got its own series back.  So long as there are enough well-populated series that users know where they can always get a race (Skippy, GT3, etc) it's alright to have a few less popular series for the people who really like the car to schedule their time to race."
iRacing,3dj967,InZomnia365,5,Fri Jul 17 20:39:23 2015 UTC,"I really hope they'll somehow attract more racers to the sim, but I doubt its doable with the current pricing model. Make it $50 for car+seasons tracks or something and it'll be more attractive but still pricey compared to competition. Or double the sub cost and make all content free."
iRacing,3dj967,soestrada,3,Thu Jul 16 19:35:45 2015 UTC,"I think the issue with adjusting the cost is that some long-time users will feel entitled to be reimbursed in some way.  Easiest way would probably be as you say, include more content beyond rookie content in monthly deals (maybe you could pick a series along with a 3 month sub, and all the content for that season would be included)"
iRacing,3dj967,HerpDerpenberg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:29:27 2015 UTC,If they feel entitled that's their own problem.  I don't think that's an issue. There was a somewhat big price reduction a few ears ago. Tracks used to cost $25 and cars $15 apiece.
iRacing,3dj967,AR-47,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:54:22 2015 UTC,"It's always been that though.  You look at games these days that release for $60, then have several $5-10 DLC that push the game to $100-$120 range.  Then they'll release the ""game of the year"" edition and include everything for $40-$60 price tag.  I mean, sure, the guys who spend thousands of dollars to own all the content will be pissed, but I'd just be happy if I could get more people in various splits.  Many of the races that have low attendance are ghost towns and I'd love for the racer base to double or triple."

iRacing,3dj967,mexicannascar,2,Fri Jul 17 16:59:55 2015 UTC,"One suggestion on the forum which I think would work is have SM on north american tracks only, and FR2.0 run on European and international tracks only.

iRacing,3dj967,vmaxmuffin,4,Thu Jul 16 19:00:31 2015 UTC,"Star Mazda, nowadays Pro Mazda, were 5s off the LMP2 times at Indy GP. FR3.5 are 8-9s quicker than LMP2 times at Spa (about 5s at Red Bull Ring). So it's a big step up from the Star Mazda.  The FR3.5 is basically a GP2 car (1.5s off at Spa, 2.3s off at Red Bull Ring) which is why Carlos Sainz was able to move up to F1 after winning the title last year."

iRacing,3dghwb,Elemento1991,2,Thu Jul 16 02:15:25 2015 UTC,"56 degrees? In my mind that's pretty extreme. I think I have mine set at around 30 degrees and mine is fine. There's a slight angle change but you'll never get rid of that completely simply because you're dealing with 2 different flat surfaces converging on one point. The best you can do ultimately is fine tune the bezel compensation to best suite all circumstances.  The up shot in my opinion is that I don't feel that you need to create a monitor angle that feels like the monitors are wrapping around you. Not only does your brain not need that for the immersion factor, but the more extreme the angle the worse that angle change is going to be, and the more useless those side monitors are going to be for any other function or game-type.  Try a much more subtle, and generically useable angle, and you'll probably find it does little or nothing to spoil your sense of immersion. You should find this lessens the angle change that you're having problems with.  Also, be sure that your bezel comp is right. I know you said you've set your bezel comp but there is a bit of a trick with iRacing. I have an AMD card so I set my bezel comp for all programs in the bezel comp tool in CCC. I don't know about anyone else, but I find that in order for bezel comp to carry through to iRacing correctly I have to set the bezel comp settings within the iRacing screen settings, to zero; otherwise the bezel comp gets screwed up.  The reason for this is that when you tell iRacing to set the bezel comp, it has no idea that you've already set bezel comp in your graphics settings for you GPU, so it applies bezel comp on top of and in addition to the bezel comp that you already have in place.  So make iRacing believe there is no need to adjust bezel comp (assuming you've set it up already in your GPU settings), and it should be sweet.   I mention this in relation to your problem because it could be that you haven't actually checked to see if bezel comp is the cause of your issue (you know, by watching a tree or railing go by your bezels as you drive along), because you may have just automatically assumed bezel comp is not the issue because you had already set it up in your GPU settings.  Worth a look."
iRacing,3dghwb,Revenant_40,2,Fri Jul 17 03:26:50 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the detailed response. I messed with it some more yesterday and managed to get the outer screens fanned out to 45 degrees but that's the most I can get until my Obutto comes in at the end of August. I did go through replays frame by frame to make sure my bezel alignment was pretty much perfect. Fanning them out a bit more definitely helped a lot. I think I've also just started to adjust to it, instead of doing mental math to try to figure out where the car is from screen to screen, I just sort of know now after about 5 hours of racing. I had a 21:9 monitor before moving to this 48:9 setup, it's definitely far more immersive. Absolutely incredible in an open wheel car. I think I may have just needed a bit of time to adjust, and I'm sure it will work even better in the Obutto."

What I'm talking about is say I'm makings a sharp right hander and looking for the apex on my right side screen. As the kerb crosses the bezel, it changes direction by about 15 degrees. I plugged in all my measurements. I don't know if widening the ""wingspan"" would lessen this effect?"

What may ~not~ be universal is the ""control interpretation"" driver, which is what makes the wheel actually send commands that make sense through the OS to the game. Those can sometimes even be shimmed by third parties to get things to work as well.  From a quick google search, there appear to be some older posts about kexts being released by third parties to get FFB and the H-shifter to work correctly for the G27 from around 2012/2013. Whether or not they work in newer releases...well, you'd have to dig around or just try it.  But just wanted to say here that there's nothing in the ""design"" of any peripheral that makes it Windows-only these days, it's just whether or not you have interpretation drivers for the controls to not be discarded by the OS."
iRacing,3dflg1,oldspiceland,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:04:30 2015 UTC,"I guess I was ambiguous in the post. I get what you're saying. I meant that the wheels are created with Windows in mind.

iRacing,3deu4k,A_Confused_Owl,3,Wed Jul 15 18:43:37 2015 UTC,"Lots of really fast drivers use G27 pedals. There are definitely better pedals out there, but you don't HAVE to have them in order to brake well.  Make sure your brakes are calibrated properly in iRacing, and experiment with the Brake Force setting - click Options in iRacing and it's on the top left. I have mine set at 1.95 and it seems to work OK, but find a setting that works for you.  It also sometimes helps to press the gas pedal a tiny bit to make the car more stable under braking. It's not very realistic, as that would probably destroy the brakes in a real car, but it helps in iRacing."
iRacing,3deu4k,Sasken,3,Wed Jul 15 18:51:31 2015 UTC,"I also recommend playing with the Brake Force setting. I have a DFGT which doesn't have the best pedals, but I do ok and rarely have problems with lockups.   Also, what do you wear on your feet? If you are wearing shoes, then maybe try bare feet or socks. Shoes just don't give you enough feel IMO."

iRacing,3deu4k,ennuiday,2,Thu Jul 16 11:31:40 2015 UTC,"It just takes practice. I wouldn't go out a race right away if your having this issues as I can be troublesome for the people around you as well as a gamble of your iRating. I recommend just going out on your own or in open rooms and doing some practices. Follow the fast guys or watch their replays and see where they brake. Try to feel out the car and build your muscle memory. Muscle memory is often over looked but I think I tend to focus on it because I also play some guitar and muscle memory is huge in music. If you are locking up every other corner, you are essential programming your brain to lock up the brakes every time. Start slow and work your way up to the limit, back off again once you pass it. Threshold braking is what you are looking for, and it will take a while to get the feel for it. Threshold braking is where the tires are moving just slightly slower (a few mph) than the car is. Eventually you will be able to identify when your doing it right. I'm not sure how I can tell, whether it's through FFB or just motor/tire sounds, I know when I hit it right."
iRacing,3deu4k,pexeq,2,Wed Jul 15 20:16:17 2015 UTC,"You might want to try http://nspace.hu/soundshift/  It can give you an audible ping at different braking thresholds.  You could set it up so that you hear two pings when you reach 50% (or whatever) breaking, and then you'd know to stop pressing.  After a couple days using it, I was much more confident modulating my brakes."

Sit there and observe from their point of view for a while and see what they are doing differently. Here are some questions to ask yourself while watching: Are they braking? Are they simply lifting? If so when and where? What section of the track are the in? Do they stay there through the turn or do they move in/ out? How agressive (or gentle) is their turn in? All of these are very important, and there is much more to oval racing than just turning left. Once you start to get faster find more populated sessions or start running carb cup and see how you do around other cars. It can be a lot of work, but it is very rewarding (and this is coming from a guy who prefers road haha)."""

The mindset to keep at that level is just to get the license level up, practice practice practice, race clean, start from the pits if you need, just get that SR up however you can. I've since had to suffer some hand surgery, but I'm sitting at a D 3.6 with my minimum participation high enough to give me a C at the end of the week. I don't think I've had a race or TT where my SR has gone down, and my most recent race (with sore hand) I had 4 Incidents in Qualifying and just 1 in the race itself to give me .20 SR increase."
iRacing,3deu4k,RaceBird,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:51:01 2015 UTC,"I found with my g27 pedals it was difficult to get consistent braking in cars without abs, the linear spring makes it difficult to judge how much you're pressing the pedal. I would highly recommend getting the gteye spring for the brake at least, it made me a lot more consistent."
iRacing,3deu4k,unreflective,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:19:40 2015 UTC,"+1 for the GTEYE spring, that and learning to back off the brake as my speed decreased helped me a lot in skippy and star mazda"
iRacing,3deu4k,Haff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:41:29 2015 UTC,Is it corner entry your losing it? thinking you maybe carry to much brake into the corner (trail braking) and the cars rotating around. Need to brake in a straightline with the Skip with no trail braking through corners.
iRacing,3deu4k,Silent_Hastati,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:13:52 2015 UTC,I had a specific problem with my g27 brake pedal in iracing. A little bug which caused lockups on some cars with less than 1/2 pedal travel. Solved by fully depressing and releasing the brake pedal as soon as you get in the car each time in the pits or on the start line. Could be worth a try?

Biggest problem is that I don't think there are any legit racing wheels that will work with a MacBook, so you'll have to download the drivers to use an XBox controller, and it's pretty much impossible to do anything but Carb Cup and Rookie Oval with that."
iRacing,3de9ic,Racing121,4,Wed Jul 15 16:19:55 2015 UTC,"They just released a new video about dynamic racing surfaces - that has to happen first since they wouldn't do a dirt surface that isn't dynamic.  So they are paving the way for dirt. They even talked about on the road surfaces that the cars can throw rubber marbles and those will be the same for all cars. That would be the beginnings of moving dirt around the track, creating ruts, etc.  I wouldn't even say soon, but once Dynamic surfaces his iRacing, I don't think itll be too far behind."

Even if they do decide to do it, it could take a couple of years.  What I'm saying is, don't get too excited just because of a survey question."
iRacing,3de9ic,SmokeFan96,2,Wed Jul 15 18:53:13 2015 UTC,"Well I think the fact that it's thrown on the survey means that if the demand is big enough that they're already possibly considering dirt and trying to see how they could get it to simulate possibly.  I know it could, but the OP is a little misinformed on the whole situation."
iRacing,3de9ic,Sasken,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:03:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it has been on their ""maybe someday"" list for a while. There is definitely a demand for it (not from me, but from a lot of the short track oval guys anyway). So it's smart to try to identify the size of that demand so they can prioritize it.  But there was a lot of stuff on that survey so people need to realize that iRacing is a relatively small company and there's NO way all of it is getting done no matter how many ""yes"" responses they get.

iRacing,3dc27g,broncobiker,3,Wed Jul 15 04:19:04 2015 UTC,"I race ovals in real life - dirt and asphalt. This was an extremely predictable wreck.

iRacing,3dc27g,broncobiker,2,Wed Jul 15 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that it wasn't predictable at all. The car going into the infield could have turned the wheel towards the track, or hit the accelerator and spun back towards you, and given how close you were to the grey car it could have done just about anything to get closer to you.  I'm not saying you don't lift normally, I'm just saying in my opinion (which I'm sure you appreciate me giving you unsolicited so much :P ) you should have lifted in this situation."

iRacing,3daas3,TheZandala,3,Tue Jul 14 18:55:34 2015 UTC,"Looks good to me, I think you'll be happy with the performance.  My only slight concern is the power supply, it MIGHT be slightly undersized.  That video card pulls about 275 watts on it's own, that's close to half your allotment.  For $10 more you can get another 150 watts..  If you ever have aspirations of running a second video card (your motherboard doesn't support it, so you probably won't), you're definitely undersized.  However, this is an opinion, you are probably okay as you are.  That's a quality power supply."
iRacing,3daas3,cincydash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:13:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback. I've heard mixed opinions on that power supply so I wasn't sure what to think. Would I need to add a second video card in order to run 3 monitors or VR? I could upgrade to a crossfire compatible motherboard for only a few more dollars.
iRacing,3daas3,cincydash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:23:45 2015 UTC,"Looking at the other comments below, I agree going i5 might save you a few bucks with little if any performance drop off.  I think CPU intensive applications like Photoshop benefit from the i7, gaming doesn't.  That being said, I'm not sure video encoding for streaming would benefit from the i7 or not.    I think you're fine with the R390 for VR or triples, especially at 1080p.  I haven't made it to triples yet (I'm rocking a single 22"" monitor at 1080p on a GTX460 or 480 at the moment) so I'm not sure what it would take, other than what I've read.  I've read iRacing is getting more and more GPU intensive, especially with the latest tracks (and larger tracks).  I wouldn't spend more money on a video card than I could swallow having to upgrade in 12 - 24 months.  If Amazon has a good deal on a 970 tomorrow, I might jump for it.  Edit:  to better answer the dual video cards question, I think you're fine with one.  From what I've read, SLI (nVidia) or Crossfire (AMD) isn't recommended with iRacing.  You could run dual cards and have two monitors on one card and one monitor on the other and split the load, but, if I'm buying new like you are, I'd go with one good card.  You can always add a second one down the road.  If you want this option, it may be worth upgrade your motherboard and power supply to accommodate it, or you can stick with what you have and just upgrade the video card later."
iRacing,3daas3,cincydash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:45:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, that's good info to have. I guess I just need to read up on the differences in performance for the i5 vs the i7 in streaming to see if it's worth it. Thanks again!"
iRacing,3daas3,cincydash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:56:47 2015 UTC,"Doing a quick search on the iRacing forums (which I recommend you do as well if you haven't already), looks like the i7 is recommended for streaming, as it's very good with multitasking."
iRacing,3daas3,Mister_Akuma,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:15:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been digging around as well. Seems like the i7 is the go to for streaming any sort of processor intensive game. Looks like i'll probably be going with the build as I originally had it listed."

I have an AMD 270X (which runs iRacing with everything maxed completely smoothly), but I have been looking for an upgrade to be able to run VR, and the 970 seems a great upgrade without needing to even swap my power supply."
iRacing,3daas3,greatfloat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:39:46 2015 UTC,I get good results pushing 3x 1080p monitors with a GTX 980.  The other item to consider is the upcoming DX11 upgrade.

I stream 1080p 30fps using my DK2 on an ""old"" i5 3750k @ stock and don't have any issues. I'm using the Nvidia codec(?) thing to encode with though. Not sure if AMD has something like that as well? If not, the i7 might be a good idea."
iRacing,3daas3,shadowofashadow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:19:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, that's encouraging! I'm not particularly married to the R9 390, it just seems to be the most highly recommended card in that range over at buildapc. Do you think I would get better streaming performance if I went with the equivalent 970 instead?"
iRacing,3daas3,SOGorman35,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:22:03 2015 UTC,I don't really know. I'm not familiar with the AMD cards really. Haven't had one for probably 10 years.  Any of them would run iRacing very well though. And after a quick google search it does seem like AMD has something similar regarding streaming. It's called Nvenc for Nvidia and vce for AMD.

The random weather and in session qualifying has shaken things up a lot. Really any of the GT3 cars are fun, and even the BMW can be really quick on the shorter technical tracks.   GT1 has been fun in the few races I've run. It seems like the Aston and C6R are evenly matched this season with the Aston having a slight cornering advantage and the C6R having a slight advantage on the straights.

High participation, great track selection, and an overall fun car to drive. I'd say it's an intermediate difficulty car. Not as easy to setup and get around as the Skippy, but a whole lot easier than the IndyCar and F1 cars.  I'm not sure how familiar you are with the different schedules, but participation is a huge factor for a lot of us. Most Star Mazda races go official, while only a few F1 races do. If you can make the scheduled race times that the communities have agreed upon, it's great, but you have to do research for those ones."

If you're into open-wheelers and want to do the open-wheel progression, I can't reccomend it enough.   For the GT route, in the past I'd recommend the Ruf Cup but this season it's undergone some changes (gone from open to fixed) and subsequently a lot of the community (which really made the series shine) dropped out.   With the addition of the Aston this season, GT1 has been one of the most active series in iRacing and both the Corvette and the Aston are a blast to drive. If you're looking at Blancpain/IMSA, do GT1."

iRacing,3d6a6y,iampogi,4,Mon Jul 13 21:21:27 2015 UTC,"1) Practice like you're in a real car at a real track with real people. The majority of guys jump into a new car and track combination and promptly wreck over and over again, slowly dialling back until they quit wrecking. Every lap you wreck is a big waste of time. It means resetting and then doing another outlap and then getting the tyres warmed up again and up to pressure before you can do some more meaningful testing. Go out and start slow and build up gradually. Ideally, you shouldn't be wrecking at all in practice. Practice consistency and it will follow in races.  2) There's a group called 'Practice Pals' which is an effort by Ken Lindberg from Band of Others (twitch.tv/bandofothers) and he encourages group practice sessions, mostly in GT3, where drivers routinely pit out together and simulate racing one lap at a time to get better wheel to wheel preparation for the races.  3) It's a good time to jump into a race when you can drive a race distance in practice without crashing."
iRacing,3d6a6y,jrebs,2,Mon Jul 13 21:26:46 2015 UTC,"Agree with all of this, especially the last point. You don't have to be fast to join a race. In fact, it's probably best to do your first races before you've learned how to drive fast. I've noticed that personally, the best way to improve lap times is to start from the pits in a race and practice lap after lap with the extra incentive of SR and gaining positions on cars that don't manage to finish the race. Not a long term strategy, but a great idea of beginners. Also helps eliminate those pre-race jitters that we all get.  There's also this great video from Empty Box about learning new circuits."
iRacing,3d6a6y,greenslime300,3,Tue Jul 14 08:21:41 2015 UTC,When going on a new track make sure you can drive an entire tank solo without going off track.
iRacing,3d6a6y,Eburon,2,Tue Jul 14 00:04:08 2015 UTC,I usually feel ready to race when I'm rarely getting off-tracks (and never due to lack of control) and when I'm consistently running within a second of my optimal.
iRacing,3d6a6y,FragginDragon,2,Mon Jul 13 21:32:32 2015 UTC,"Well you're not in any danger of being lapped in the short races offered for rookies so you're not that dangerous, at least if you can keep a stable and predictable line so that faster drivers can overtake you safely. In your first race I'd hang back at the first corner just to avoid causing a traditional clusterfuck and after that just drive your own pace and let other people crash and make mistakes and improve your position that way.  You aren't gonna overtake anyone on speed alone with your current times so consistent safe driving will get you up some positions.  Get iSpeed and use the lap analyzer, there you'll be able to see and compare your times with other people. While some aliens will beat you by 10 seconds usually winning drivers drive a consistent 1:45 or so at laguna. Analyzing and comparing the laps will tell you what gear you should be in, where to brake, where to simply lift off of gas etc.  My optimal time is 1:45.1 currently but in competition I don't really do any better than 1:47, it is too risky to drive at my absolute current limit during races, better improve the limit during practice and then just step it down 1% so I can be safe."

If you can ghost most of a race with no incidents and your times are consistent, then join a real race."

The MX5 is a nice little car, it can be frustrating as you need to 'carry momentum' through corners or you will get bogged down on tricot, however it is that very fact that makes the car a perfect beginner car; if you learn proper corner exiting you are halfway there!   After a few weeks you will claw your eyes out wanting to get on to a faster car - like the Skippy - but stick with it! I studied all the fixed MX-5 track demos I found find and tried to mimic lines, brake points, and gears. This was a huge help for me. I also read a lot on the racing forums and watched the iRacing youtube series Racing School.   I wrote this article yesterday on learning the Skippy. Some of the lessons may be applicable to you and the MX5.  Best of luck and keep racing!"

iRacing,3d6a6y,ktbandit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:11:43 2015 UTC,"I Use iSpeed. For practise each week I typically run 5-10 laps until i have completed a clean lap thats suitable for comparing my lap times to others. I then go to iSpeed and review the lap against someone quicker (approx 1sec) checking mainly gear, braking points, full throttle point, lines and mid corner speed. I also record my optimal sector times agaisnt this lap to see what i need to find in each sector and to also itentify what sectors to focus on. I'll then run 5-10 more laps or until i have done a decent lap then go back and compare with either the same lap or a better one and update my recorded sectors. Once i have done this i run a few more laps then im ready to go. I typically don't run many practise sessions as i find slower drivers get in the way and ruin my runs. However with this dynamic weather im starting to run them more as your no longer compared laps with the same weather in iSpeed."

Time Trials.... yep, they're boring, but a challenge in itself. Rather than practicing on your own you can meet your participation, collect some SR, and really learn how to keep the car on the track. Take your pace lap slow, learn the course, try to figure your braking spots, take the first few laps slowish, get faster and faster every time. It's rewarding when you knock .2s off your previous fastest lap 4 or 5 laps in a row, and they're all 100% clean laps."

iRacing,3d7ed7,Obesity_,7,Tue Jul 14 02:33:44 2015 UTC,It didn't appear you let off the gas or braked.  I'd say you're both equally at fault.

This is rookies so there's no point assigning blame or complaining in either side, only an opportunity to learn.

As a recent Rookie, and my previous racing experience limited to being 10s off pace in Forza , I'm finally competitive.  Focusing on only the MX-5, and the base tracks, I'm about 2-3s off alien pace.   I don't know where your interests lie, but if you really want to learn how to sim race, and are interested in competing in the best online racing experience (outside of quality league racing, obviously, which iRacing also offers) available, I can't recommend iRacing enough.  That said, if you're more interested in a single player experience, Raceroom Racing Experience is a great choice, as, of course, is Assetto Corsa.  Somewhat under appreciated, Game Stock Car Extreme, also provides some of the best base content available, at an amazing price.  BTW, regarding iRacing's controversial pricing structure, it's been almost free for me.  I love racing in the upper Mazda Cup splits, and although I will someday branch out, I'll only buy the content needed for those series.  Very few members own all the content, nor do many members race in more than 2 or 3 series in a given season.  Moreover, most find those series they enjoy, and stick with them, only buying new tracks as they rotate in during a given season.  Given my enjoyment, and time spent, iRacing is the most economical gaming experience I've ever had.  I wonder how many of the naysayers are actual members, or ex-members who truly found the found the service financially unacceptable.  Hardware, on the other hand, has bled me dry.

Some here have adviced you to get another racing sim before you go to iRacing. I won't recommend that. iRacing is different from a lot of other racing sims in its very core and approach to racing. My best advice is for you to decide whether you want to potentially throw a bit of money out of the window. If you're willing to risk that, then go right ahead with the promotions in the sidebar. (They should still be active). That's the best value for money.  Now, IF you do sign up, prepare to be frustrated. You will struggle to feel comfortable even in the rookie car. You will spin and crash like you've never done before. You will be painfully slow. And just when you get that magic race where it's all coming together, you may get spun or crashed by someone who just has their first online race and makes a mistake and catches you in doing so. You should really be prepared for an experience like you haven't had before, both positive and negative. I can only speak for myself, but it's so frustrating to see other persons ruin your lap and/or race. But it's also the most rewarding game I have yet played. Putting a few good laps and watching the time to the guy in front of you drop is so satisfying. Catching up with him and putting in a clean move to overtake even more so.  I'm still fairly new to iRacing with only about three months of racing, but I love it to bits. Feel free to ask me anything you would want."

iRacing,3d4udt,Brewer74,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:45:54 2015 UTC,Give it a shot. A three month sub won't cost too much if you can't get it on a free trial. You won't be able to race the advanced cars for a little while so you won't be spending money on cars and tracks for the rookie races.  Keep in mind that a lot of the rookie races are filled with people who don't care to promote or don't care to continue playing for long so your opponents won't be the best or most cordial. You will get a good feeling of you want to keep going with it though.
iRacing,3d4qf0,Dirt_Track_Racer,2,Mon Jul 13 14:43:34 2015 UTC,Congratulations.  That was the strangest race I have ever seen from iRacing.

iRacing,3d4qf0,Ass-Packer,2,Fri Jul 17 17:07:07 2015 UTC,It was definitely interesting! One of the most fun races I've been able to run!
iRacing,3d41co,duck74UK,4,Mon Jul 13 10:17:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, because iRacing treats any incidents that happen in a short amount of time as the same incident, with the highest severity incident being the one that is actually applied.  Example: When you go off track (1x) and then lose control (2x) You actually only get the 2x (and iRacing will display a message to the effect of ""Loss of control (1x -> 2x)"" showing that the severity has been upgraded. So theoretically, the most you can get from any one incident is 4x."
iRacing,3d41co,TheKrumpet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:29:44 2015 UTC,"Indeed. It kinda keeps you in an incident state for a little while to prevent it starting counting again (which is why you can go off-track without a penalty when the ""off-track (1x)"" is still showing in the message box."
iRacing,3d41co,InZomnia365,2,Mon Jul 13 11:01:30 2015 UTC,I was in a series of incidents on Saturday that ended up wracking up 12 incident points.. I love racing the Laguna track and I did a rookie race against my better judgment. I worked my way from 9th to 1st and the second place guy didn't like me passing him for the lead. He rear ended me twice in two turns which gave me enough damage to spin out in a third turn hitting a wall gaining another x4. It was just long enough to let the iRacing incident cool down happen and give me more incidents.   It was and will be my last ever rookie race.
iRacing,3d41co,MysticalMuffDiver,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:04:26 2015 UTC,Did you get a replay?  Did you report?
iRacing,3d41co,oldspiceland,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:13:18 2015 UTC,"Some other things about incidents:  1) if you tap someone a 0x, but then they lose control and get an incident, your 0x can turn into something bigger.  2) you can actually go off track quite a bit if you are going slow and not get any incidents for it. for example, you spin out and as you are coming to a stop get 3 tires off the track. going slow and getting back on the track is possible with zero incidents."
iRacing,3d41co,WhyDoISuckAtW2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:17:26 2015 UTC,i think the speed threshold for incidents is around 25-30 mph
iRacing,3d41co,kaluh_glarski,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:05:56 2015 UTC,You can only get a max of 4x from one incident.
iRacing,3d41co,AndrewCoja,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:53:45 2015 UTC,No and no. I don't think it was truly on purpose. Just an idiot who has no clue breaking in dirty air means break more. I mean it felt on purpose since he hit me the second after I took first but that's my own fault for taking rookies. Some people should just stick to need for speed
iRacing,3d41co,MysticalMuffDiver,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:04:19 2015 UTC,No. Max is 4x

With regard to the monitors, if it was me, I would be looking for a monitor with a better response time around the 1ms mark.

iRacing,3cz6ji,Sputnik420,2,Sun Jul 12 02:51:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say any wheel is better than no wheel. See what's on the used market (Craigslist). I picked up my G27 at a discount, around what I would have payed for one on eBay minus shipping. I've only ever used my G27 with iRacing so I can't give you any further opinion other than I enjoy my G27. I plan on upgrading the pedals eventually as they're my least favorite aspect."
iRacing,3cz6ji,cincydash,2,Sun Jul 12 03:25:33 2015 UTC,"DFGT and G27 wheels are very similar, many users claim DFGT FFB is even better than G27s and has more buttons. The pedals however are crap, so consider yourself warned. I had DFGT for 8 months and they worked for me very well, great starter package.  Now I've moved to Thrustmaster T300RS and the wheel is superb, but again pedals are crap. I'm in the process of saving for something with loadcell, but for now it'll do.  You could go this route too. Buy something you can afford and save for pedals upgrade later."
iRacing,3cz6ji,theebe,2,Sun Jul 12 06:59:20 2015 UTC,"due to a kid/dog ""incident"" I am now without any wheel at all  (im good at elecronics).   I don't 'spose you could fix it? Failing that ... you know you love racing. Have some patience. I would suggest waiting and only buying something good you will use forever. In the long run, you will save more money and get your ultimate rig faster. But you do the math and see where you come down.  For example, starting with $200 and saving $50 a month:  A) buy a DFGT for lets say $200 now, it will take you six months to get the $300 for the ""Fanatech 911gt2 OR a Logitech G27 set"" you want. At the end you have spent $500 and have a G27.  B) If you don't buy anything now it will only take two months to get the $300. Only two! And at the end you have spent $300 and have a G27. But it's two months putting up with a gamepad or something. Your call, but I know what I would do."

iRacing,3cy28k,Acurus_Cow,5,Sat Jul 11 20:33:05 2015 UTC,"/r/buildapc is the place to go. For specifics for pretty much all gaming, including racing sims, I'd go with an i5 processor (I've read Asseto Corso is now recommending i7's but I'm not sure if you'd see a big difference), 8GB of RAM (you can go 16GB but don't know how beneficial it's be), pick a motherboard that includes the features you want (I like ASUS), an SSD hard drive, and as much video card as you can afford. I'm an nVidia fan personally. GTX 970 with 4 or 6GB should be plenty for triple screens, 980's are the new sexy thing but you'd be going way over your budget...you may even with a 970.   Get a good power supply, PLEASE don't skimp here or you'll regret it. Cases are a personal touch. You don't really need a DVD drive for gaming but if you want one, get one.   If you need monitors, I can't really give a recommendation. I'd say three 24 or 27 inches, usually Newegg or someone has a good deal on them occasionally. Amazon has their big sale on Wednesday, you may find some cheap.  Windows 8.1 is solid, upgrade to 10 once it settles and games appear to be running proficiently on it."

iRacing,3cw9tv,ShinZero,3,Sat Jul 11 10:58:01 2015 UTC,Usually a year of membership costs $100. But they discount it pretty often. Steam sometimes has its problems with different currencies. Your best bet would be to buy it from their website and then request a steam key.

If you don't respect the vehicles you're driving and the inherent danger involved, you're liable to injure and potentially kill someone.  Sure, the driver of the Corvette should have been punished post race. He made some poor judgments but that is NEVER a justification to wreck someone intentionally."
iRacing,3cts1t,greenslime300,5,Fri Jul 10 23:46:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. the Vette was beside him for WAYY too long. Porsche needed to immediately back off from blocking as soon as the vette's front was beside Porsche's rear.  The vette actually passed the porsche and the porsche was still not letting up? Not cool.

iRacing,3cts1t,True_Racer,3,Fri Jul 10 20:27:16 2015 UTC,"You can see the Porsche get loose coming off of 2. I would say this is less of ""driving him off the track"" and more ""dropped the hammer a little too early.""  I always root for the Corvettes, but he got what was coming to him.

iRacing,3cts1t,True_Racer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:44:53 2015 UTC,"It's ridiculous because the meter for determining acceptable driving isn't what happened after the fact, but the damage that could have been done if it had gone wrong.  For instance, that three-wide pass earlier in the clip could have absolutely demolished that GT. Later on, the pass in the pit out lane? Completely unnecessary and extremely dangerous, especially so because he did it coming over the blind crest of a hill.  Magnussen made multiple moves that were very dangerous and inconsiderate. He's lucky the Porsche waited until the final straight to wreck him, and he's lucky he even managed to post an official finish."

iRacing,3cts1t,my_dick_said_this,-1,Sat Jul 11 18:37:07 2015 UTC,"So your experience is limited basically to a game.  I spent a lot of my youth racing. I understand racing hard and trying to win with firsthand experience. The urge to do something like that is really strong.  But you don't do it because you wouldn't want it done to you if the roles were reversed, and because you have to face that person again later on the track. Even worse? If the group of racers was really tight-knit like mine was, and you have to face them in the pits after the race.  In the end, you are participating in what amounts to a game, and you've got to remember that, even if you're being paid for it. If you do that kind of driving, no one will care about the position you finished in, but the risky stuff you pulled to get there.  Yes, spinning the Corvette was a prick move, and was dangerous. Sure. But after the overly aggressive manner that Magnussen was driving with, it boils down to a Chris Rock quote (paraphrased): ""I'm not saying it's right, but I understand.""  I never intentionally caused any crashes, but then again, I never had anyone doing that kind of stuff in an attempt to get past me.   Moral of the story? Just because you CAN drive in a certain way by the rules doesn't mean you SHOULD."
iRacing,3cts1t,Speedly,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:30:26 2015 UTC,No. Not limited to a game. Are you a professional? Doubtful. You have no more understanding of the situation than I do.

iRacing,3cts1t,DeathHaze420,2,Fri Jul 10 23:36:12 2015 UTC,but he got what was coming to him   Bullshit. You don't put a car in the wall like that intentionally. It's not only unsportsmanlike; it's criminal behavior.
iRacing,3cts1t,greenslime300,5,Fri Jul 10 23:41:04 2015 UTC,"It isn't criminal, but is unsportsmanlike. Driving Jan all the way over to the wall for the love tap at the last corner put another driver in danger, which makes Bergmeister no better than Magnussen was being that day.  Actually, given that Bergmeister was repeatedly creating dangerous situations by blocking a very determined and obviously faster opponent, I even more affirm that they were even. I get racing for position and racing for points, especially in the final race of a season where it matters...but I remember watching that race when it happened and to be totally honest, there is no excuse for Bergmeister driving Magnussen to the wall.  If you have a problem with how someone is driving, you take it up with the officials, you don't take it out on the track. Drivers don't get to determine that, the officials do. Bergmeister should have just driven through, and whether Magnussen would have gotten past or not, he should have gone to the officials. I highly doubt given the situation that the officials would have sided with Magnussen, especially since they had ~immediately~ penalized him for the pit-out pass. Instead, Bergmeister put another driver's life in danger, as well as possibly others by driving Magnussen intentionally into the wall. No thanks, compared to that, Magnussen was a downright gentleman."
iRacing,3cts1t,oldspiceland,2,Sat Jul 11 00:49:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with your comment as far as the ""don't take it out on the track and let the officials deal with it instead"" point goes.   Where I differ from you is that if you've got a slower car in front of you but fail repeatedly to make the pass cleanly, then you in fact are the slower car (in theory, obviously not in pure MPH).  It is the overtaking car's responsibility to execute a pass cleanly and safely. Taking defensive lines is well within a sportsmanlike path to victory - it's not like the Porsche was weaving all over the place in an effort to overtly block the Corvette."
iRacing,3cts1t,Speedly,2,Sat Jul 11 06:52:21 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is the overtaking car's place to pass cleanly, but there were a few situations there where Bergmeister made a clean pass impossible by coming off line (Including where he went wide with Magnussen on the outside and got on the throttle too early) and made making a clean pass more difficult intentionally. Bergmeister could have still walked away from all this the ""Bigger man, better driver"" purely by ~not~ running Magnussen into the wall however, he'd done nothing on the level that Magnussen had...but that was way past anything Magnussen had done to that point, even with the love tap just before. The reality is that Bergmeister really even went beyond pushing Magnussen up to the wall, and when Magnussen nosed ahead was when he turned him completely by turning into him again.  Magnussen didn't try and wreck Bergmeister...he just acted like an over-aggressive idiot trying to get around him. Bergmeister did try and wreck Magnussen...essentially twice within the span of 10 seconds. It's difficult to see, especially in the clip provided, but at the very end, Magnussen has pulled ahead of Bergmeister ~despite~ being driven up almost against the wall, and has kept his car off the wall. Bergmeister then applies more pressure into him to spin him. That's really two separate actions as there was nothing ""defensive"" about Bergmeister driving hard left into Magnussen to push him up against the inside wall, and nothing ""defensive"" about him not letting up when Magnussen was past him anyways. Both of them should have been penalized.  I do concede your point that if you can't pass, you aren't faster though."

But in practice, if you're all over me and pulling dangerous moves like that and are sure to crash someone, I'm gonna make sure it's you and not me that ends up in the wall.  I'm not saying Bergmeister is without fault - certainly a large part of that lies in his hands, and yeah, he definitely turned Magnussen on purpose. But it very well could have been avoided if a lot of those moves never happened."

Still doesn't make it right, but I understand.  And until the final straight I don't think the Porsche did anything wrong as far as racing the corvette goes, it was great defensive driving. The corvette cut track to pass the Porsche once. Then just straight up hit him out of the way on the last corner, I don't think that is acceptable in any type of racing....neither is running the opposition into the wall but that's a whole other conversation.    I may be in the minority here but, if the corvette would have beat the Porsche to the line he should have had his win taken away for his move in the last corner.  As it stands they were both very in the wrong at the end of the race.  I don't know if they were or not, but they both should have been heavily punished for their actions on track, if only because of the final lap."

I don't think it would have been deserved, but the officials likely would have done it. However instead, Bergmeister went hard-left off line to drive Magnussen to the wall in an attempt to win the drag race...then when Magnussen got past, Bergmeister put even more pressure on him, knowing it would cause him to spin.

It was honestly my biggest fear with the track iRacing. Monza is infamous for first lap accidents and iRacing has no shortage of impatient and egotistic drivers.

There should be a ""Pastor Maldonado incarnate"" achievement after crashes like the one on the screenshot :P"

I'll move out of someone's way when they are obviously faster than me, rather than deal with them pressuring me and ruining my race.

iRacing,3cvrw2,arsenicfox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:41:01 2015 UTC,Irating would probably be a better status of driving ability. Safety rating merely means they've worked on not wrecking. Doesn't mean they worked on not wrecking while being fast.
iRacing,3cvrw2,sim-racingcouk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:48:23 2015 UTC,"How about this as an idea.  If you've been hit at a specific corner every race as you approach said corner, drive as you normally would but as you are doing so dab your brakes very gently while accelerating.  This should either freak the car out behind you so they change lines or warn them that possibly you brake early for the next corner.  You won't lose any real speed but the flashing of your brake lights should act as a warning to car(s) behind you.  If I saw a car doing this in front of me I would either change my line e.g. think about overtaking them in the braking zone, having made my actions clear to the driver in front by moving my car in a position to suggest this, or I'd back off and let them have the corner."

iRacing,3cvrw2,bouncebackability,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"Another little tip that I like to use is that when you enter a race session.  I don't drive before a race.  I will sit and scroll through other drivers, especially ones that I don't know.  I will look at how they drive and make a judgement call on who to steer clear off if possible.  The judgement call I make may not be correct, but I like to glance at other drivers so I can try to predict who could be dangerous at the start of the race or if people are going to be wild when I get near them."

iRacing,3ct9iz,MrSn1ck3rs,2,Fri Jul 10 16:21:47 2015 UTC,Welcome to iracing Feel free to ask away For series typically each car has their own series which have their own season championship that lasts 12 weeks.   As far as what to get depends on what you want to drive road or oval? Open wheelers our coupes? short track or big track(oval) after you know what series to start in you can then buy the tracks that are coming up in that series schedule and buy in 3 or 6 chunks to get discounts.  As far as mistakes i would recommend getting ispeed which is a free data software that you can use to review your lap details with yourself or to some of the best drivers cheers hope this helps
iRacing,3ct9iz,True_Racer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:00:15 2015 UTC,"The problem with ovals in my opinion is that to progress you really need to buy short tracks at the start as the series available at lower license levels only really cater to them. Personally I find them great for learning car control but too frenetic to get into groove and enjoy the racing. And when you get to the longer ovals you need to again invest more money. Ofc there is the carb cup with more longer ovals but it doesn't contribute.   I guess the current system is good because it prevents somewhat total retards from getting into the faster cars in large ovals and causing total chaos, but its just annoyingly expensive."

Seriously if you are safe, but slow, don't let that stop you having fun.    A lot of the newer drivers will pull out of a faster guys way in practice, trying to be kind and helpful.  But if you are a faster driver it leaves you nothing to do.  If you are predictable with your actions, just do your thing, faster drivers will have no issue getting around you and will not resent you in any way for being slow."
iRacing,3ct9iz,Annoying_Arsehole,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"If you can keep a stable 1:47 or even 1:50 you can easily do the few races required to get to D class license without causing any danger, the race is only 10 laps at laguna so nobody is gonna lap you.   When I did my first few races I didn't bother qualifying and started near the last spot, I let the ones behind me past on the starting straight and avoided the usual mess of the first corner. After that I just drove my own race at my own pace and finished around the middle due to the other drivers crashing etc.  3  clean races are enough for promotion too, so just do it.  My optimal lap says currently 1.46 at laguna, which isn't really all that good and my best is 1.47.something too. I just can't figure out how to carry my speed properly through the cork and the following corners yet, I lose around 2 seconds there. I need to put some hours too into figuring out my lines, but I've generally noticed that when you just get how to do a corner you've had problems with you often cut an entire second of your lap time."

iRacing,3crzf6,_Moose3,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:22:52 2015 UTC,Try emailing the staff with you story they are usually pretty good in that regard
iRacing,3cqwgz,dospaquetes,9,Fri Jul 10 01:30:55 2015 UTC,I thought it was a pretty good move honestly. IMO you gotta go for the gap (as Senna says) if you want to win races. On the other hand it won't always turn out that way and will sometimes end in tears. Only experience will get you to the point where you will be able to tell before making such a move as to how it will end up.
iRacing,3cqwgz,chillbrojeff,8,Fri Jul 10 01:37:59 2015 UTC,"I have to say that that Senna quote should be deleted from history if possible. The sole quote is responsible for so many wrecks in iracing it's silly.   EDIT: nice pass btw, has nothing to do with Senna."
iRacing,3cqwgz,PudiKator,3,Fri Jul 10 09:50:51 2015 UTC,It's a great quote. The problem is that amateur drivers often see a gap where it doesn't truly exist. OP got very lucky to come out of that ahead. 9 times out of 10 that ends in disaster for at least two of the drivers.
iRacing,3cqwgz,greenslime300,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:49:22 2015 UTC,"Once a quote becomes more abused than used properly it seizes being good, imo."
iRacing,3cqwgz,PudiKator,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:29:02 2015 UTC,"I agree, I was lucky. especially since 3 wide on oulton park is... pretty much the whole track. Although when I went for it I was going so much faster than them I probably would have cleared both guys before the turn, had I not missed that shift out of pure stress. But yeah, got pretty lucky in the end. didn't ruin the other guy's race either, there was no contact and those two kept battling till the end"

You made no contact and the other driver who went in the grass should have slowed if he wasn't able to maintain a line. Of course, if his other alternative due to factors only he knows was to make contact with you? Kudos to him for choosing the grass."

iRacing,3cqwgz,Wallykahuna,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:20:30 2015 UTC,"For sure. Fraps eats up resources and also saves in huuuge files by default.  OBS might require a little bit of tinkering to understand and get right, but it puts a lot less stress on the computer and you can pretty easily define your videl quality (I have tl fine-tune that for every video because my upload speed sucks, for example)."
iRacing,3cqwgz,sim-racingcouk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:24:04 2015 UTC,"Looked pretty good to me.  Only problem like you mentioned was the missed shift at the start.  If you hit that shift you clear them both before you even have to do any hard work.  It is nice for you to learn the limits of aggressive driving early on.  Just remember that you can make crazy moves, but you have to respect the space of the other cars and you will do fine."
iRacing,3cqwgz,sim-racingcouk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:40:44 2015 UTC,"I was so tense trying that move I only shifted when I heard the rev limiter... could have saved me a few drops of sweat  Yeah I'm determined to learn fast, I hate being slow and I hate even more being a nuisance to other racers. Obviously I probably won't reach the pro/wc level but I still want to battle like the best"
iRacing,3cqwgz,RileyF1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:00:47 2015 UTC,"The two guys battling left you room to go through the middle.  If they didn't want you there, they should have closed the gap.  However, at 11 seconds on the video, you could/should have left the blinker on the right a tad more room.  If he hadn't blinked, you could all have been in a world of trouble.    But I don't think you did anything wrong, like others have said, there was a gap...  Just be mindful that if you go three wide and approach a corner you need to leave a car's width either side of you.  I feel you didn't quite do this to the blinker, but you got away with it."

iRacing,3conjt,BillCuttingsOn,5,Thu Jul 9 15:16:21 2015 UTC,"Best advice I can give you is a lot of reading at the start, learn what things do and the cause and effect of them. I work with cars for a living and understand what does what which gave me a huge advantage to iracing.   After you have done some reading start playing with your setups, only adjust one or two things at a time so you can notice the difference it makes.   Also if you are unsure what something does or will do to your car my best advice is to MAX out the setting then do a lap, you should notice the change.  Then set it to the MIN setting, do a lap and you will see the adverse effects. From their you will start to understand it better and can adjust to your liking.   Here are some links that may help.   http://www.racelinecentral.com/RacingSetupGuide.html  I personally like this one, I also own a lot of carroll smith's books -  http://performanceforums.com/forums/showthread.php?67203917-Some-great-suspension-tuning-info-Thanks-Carroll-Smith-RIP&amp;highlight=carroll%20smith"

It's a luxury to be able to enjoy it and if you're really so broke that you can't afford the $4/mo it costs (when buying yearly at black friday), then you have greater problems and might need some time away from the simulation to focus on the real world and making your way in it.  I watch a lot of iracing streamers and watch a great deal of the less popular ones as well. I have only a few hard rules that will preclude me from watching a streamer and one of them is donation soliciting.

If you can put up consistent 18.3s with no incidents then you're doing pretty well, honestly, and only about a second off pace. There's a groove you have to find to be really quick there, which will allow you to get back on the throttle earlier. Try and follow the blackened section of the track around and just find a rythym and a line that suits you, make your turns as wide as possible and get back on the throttle as soon as you safely can."
iRacing,3cf5ak,oldspiceland,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:08:42 2015 UTC,I have been on iracing for a few years now and I run about everything on the oval side but I really like the national car.

iRacing,3cdkm0,cactoidjim,4,Tue Jul 7 02:06:14 2015 UTC,"That's kind of unique to the SRF. It really doesn't like to be over-revved. 5500 seems to be the ""magic"" revs for shifting once you're out of 1st.  The other main trick with the SRF is that it has a LOT of trailing-throttle oversteer. If you lift off the gas, it turns. You can use that to overcome its natural tendency to understeer. If you watch the fast guys, they do a lot of their steering using the throttle.  Obviously if you overdo it, you end up spinning a lot."
iRacing,3cdkm0,Sasken,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:23:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I've noticed that. I try to do it sometimes if I'm in trouble, but usually I'm already too far gone.  So you're saying that, as a rule, with other cars the later the shift the better?"
iRacing,3cdkm0,Sasken,4,Tue Jul 7 02:34:03 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the other cars work the way you describe: you shift near redline.  The SRF is just a goofy little car. I wish the 5500-rev ""rule"" was documented somewhere because everybody starts out revving the crap out of it and wondering why they're slow."
iRacing,3cdkm0,teh_cheat,2,Tue Jul 7 02:38:16 2015 UTC,It's in a stickied post in the sub forum including detailed shift points as the optimal rim varies by a few hundred through the set of gears.
iRacing,3cdkm0,oldspiceland,3,Tue Jul 7 05:52:59 2015 UTC,"The best tip really is learning to stay on the throttle through turns some. You get some serious yaw out of the Speccy simply by modulating the throttle. If you gas it, you will straighten out of most situations that the tires haven't broken loose yet on, and if you let off the throttle she will want to rotate for you like a ballerina.  She's a blast, but the other trick with the speccy is knowing that the really fast guys have acclimated to how the car drives and are taking full advantage of some of could otherwise be considered disadvantages."
iRacing,3cdkm0,BraKes22,2,Tue Jul 7 02:50:38 2015 UTC,"The original (as in, not super) late model has a sweet spot in the RPM range about 1500-2500RPM below redline. The Macca likes to change gear a little below the last red light on the wheel, the mustang is best shifted at the Amber light on the tach, and the cup cars like to be shifted about 700-1200RPM below redline.  Each car is unique and as you move through iRacing you'll kinda find your niche and begin to consume all the info there is about the cars in it and around it."
iRacing,3cdkm0,sim-racingcouk,3,Tue Jul 7 04:45:15 2015 UTC,"With the SRF it is vital to get good exit speed from a corner, due to its lack of power, you will also be suprised by how little brake you need to use in the SRF, as you need to keep momentum up.    The thing I notice the most when driving the SRF is that the slower drivers tend to brake very late and very hard, so they lose all speed and then release the brake pedal like it's a switch.  This then causes instability due to the weight transfer and they either spin, or lose even more speed trying to get the car under control.  You have to be smooth with your inputs, when braking for most corners you are mainly using the brakes to balance the car and transfer the weight to allow you to drive through the corner, again due to the cars lack of speed.  As the old mantra says, ""smooth is fast.""    The SRF is quite a unique car, but if you stick with it, it should teach you all you need to learn about car control."
iRacing,3cdkm0,Phr00t,3,Tue Jul 7 02:52:17 2015 UTC,"Echoing the sentiment here, how and when you release the brake pedal is equally as, or more, important than when you start braking."

I have to start thinking of this and being smoother."
iRacing,3cdkm0,sim-racingcouk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:10:05 2015 UTC,"If you find you are one of the slower drivers, it's usually because you are over-driving the car.  So therefore going in too hot and not getting on the power early enough, this is why the faster drivers can easily overtake you on corner exit, because they are more in control of their vehicle so are able to get the power down a lot earlier than yourself and are powering through corners, rather than powering out of corners."
iRacing,3cdkm0,B2O-Duke,2,Wed Jul 8 00:36:42 2015 UTC,"If you want to improve your lap times I'd suggest start saving and reviewing your replays. I actually create YouTube Videos based off some of my races and because I like to add an external view (to the right of the virtual mirror) I see myself doing a lot of stupid stuff.   There are a lot of areas to pick up time by just adjusting little things for instance, I've gained time by getting off throttle a slight bit sooner prior to corner entry. The reason why is the car is much more settled and I don't have to fight it on corner entry.   Also, do everything you can to get on the throttle at or before apex. Even if it's just a little throttle it's a lot better than no throttle at all or even worse, braking because you cooked it into a corner.   Like you I started off 7+ seconds away from the fastest times and now I'm down into the 3'ish second area (sometimes as low as 1.5 early in the week).  ...and I'm not a great driver by any means.   Incidentally my response is not SRF specific."
iRacing,3cdkm0,True_Racer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:40:46 2015 UTC,Brake 10% earlier and 90% as hard this will allow you to keep the car more balanced giving you more grip in the corner and better consistancy
iRacing,3cbu7g,Veloccity,7,Mon Jul 6 18:20:07 2015 UTC,"Just had a very similar experience. Been practicing off and on for almost a month but couldn't build up the courage to practice on a live server. Finally on Sunday said to hell with it and after another hour or two of testing alone I finally took it to a practice server.  At first I was terrified around any other cars and psyched myself out into a couple wrecka. In the evening I decided after all the time I put into Lime Rock in the MX5 it was now or never to get into a race before the series moved to another track.  On the first race I didn't qualify and gridded last of course. I was so nervous it took me about five seconds to get my car to first gear on the start. I avoided a massive five car wreck by inches on lap 2 and was thrilled. Then, just like you, I was worried about the car behind mr going into turn 1 and missed my turn in and ended up on the wall. After repairs I got going with a wide open track. I was happy with incident avoidance and hoping to build SR, but nerves got the best of me and I took T7 too fast and totalled the car on lap 11. Hadn't wrecked there in hundreds of laps, huge bummer.  An hour later I registered again, again started last, and let everyone get ahead. My average lap time was 1:05 which is about 3-4 seconds higher than my average in practice, but I had 0 incidents over 20 laps and just by not crashing I earned a 4th place finish.  Even though it was totally uneventful and I was alone most of the race, it was absolutely thrilling in a way that CoD or Halo or even Starcraft can't match. My arms were shaky after the race from the adrenaline.   I have been dawdling around in Assetto Corsa for about a year, mostly because of the Oculus Rift capability. Getting into iRacing was very frustrating and challenging at first because it requires so much more finesse and you can't just wing it right away in the supercars. But now, after spending weeks and months reading beginners guides, watching videos, and slowly figuring out how to be consistent, wow. Seeing it come together is so satisfying. Not only was this my first online race but the first time I felt like I really 'got it.' I am hooked and I can't wait for more. Looking forward to just doing test laps at Laguna Seca while prepping for races there. Pretty insane to be so pumped up about solo practice sessions for an online game.  PS sorry for typos, on my cellphone on my lunch break. Can't wait to race!!"

I have been in competitive events for what feels like my whole life, but never expected to get that feeling in a random hourly race at 9:00pm on a Sunday. Hah!  Yeah my average lap in-race was 1:03.9 or something like that, much higher than my normal. Nerves I am sure!  I would describe my experience in Assetto Corsa as being more twitchy than my experience so far in iRacing. I love the XBow but some of then cars are damn near undrivable for me.

I've gotten in some pretty decent laps around Lime Rock but find I'm always 3 to 4 seconds slower during the race. Of course, I'm mainly trying to avoid the crashes and put together clean laps, but even on open track I find I'm slower. I guess it's just a confidence thing in learning to race and go fast. Either way, I'm having a blast too."

My race pace is for sure slower.   My next goal is to be able to qualify (or even run a lap) in the 1:00's and get very consistent with 1:01's, trying to achieve closer to that in race. Long ways to go!"
iRacing,3cbu7g,Sofaboy90,2,Mon Jul 6 20:40:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing, it's great to hear perspective from a fellow Redditor, and also from a fellow newbie.  I too ran Lime Rock, heck, road racing period for the first time this weekend.  I've been practicing ovals on iRacing previously, and decided to venture into road racing.  While I'm not very fast (1:05s, 1:06s mostly), I feel your sentiment about nerves and getting accustomed to racing around other drivers.  The racing I have had is great; while there are wrecks and self induced incident, the racing is typically good.  I can see things getting much better once one graduates from rookies."
iRacing,3cbu7g,Imprenzia,2,Mon Jul 6 20:11:06 2015 UTC,I am working on my SR now. I like the TT's because even a single incident (off track 1x for me) resets your lap counter. Frustrating but a great way to keep within the limits and practice clean laps.
iRacing,3cbu7g,Eburon,2,Mon Jul 6 20:45:32 2015 UTC,Just go slower and hit your apexes and lap times will come down. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.

iRacing,3cbu7g,SOGorman35,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:32:42 2015 UTC,"i got my first paycheck the last week and i decided its time to get into iracing, i also found this free 3 months code. i started racing a lot on okoyama because ive seen a lot of people on youtube drive it frequently in combination with the mx5 (not an oval guy), so i did train that the whole day. im still racing with my xbox360 pad, im pretty trained with that thing, never had the money to buy a wheel so now i got about 5+ years racing experience on that thing on several simulators. driving the mx5 was amazingly easy, at least in perspective of what i expected. so i told myself fuck it, ill go for a race, turns out nobody was driving that combination but i did see that laguna seca is on the mazda challenge schedule so i trained that track. unlike okoyama however i did know laguna seca from many other racing games, i didnt like it that much but you if theres no choice you might just deal with it. so at the begining im doing 1,47s looking how hard i can push, tricky track. going onto youtube, finding people doing 1,40s and im like wadafa. so i trained that track like 25laps before saying fuck it, ill just do a race. so i was the only one who made a qualifying lap so i started first, GREAT! unfortunately i tested the game and tried to see, if i could already start before going green (-.-) and yes it worked....and i got a stop and go penalty...the first lap went clean, i go into the box and wait like 1 minute and finish the race cleanly, not too exciting but hey i finished clean and my 2.5 rookie rating improved by a bit. 2nd race as far asi remember also was fairly clean, started 2nd, finished 2nd. the 3rd race however was pure chaos. i cant remember 100% how it went but i did start 2nd again, clean first lap and then i was going wide, coming back as 5th. overtaking the next 2 fairly quickly again, overtaking the 2nd guy and there i was about to take back my first place...and im fucking crashing in that first corner on laguna seca into the first guy even tho he left space for me to overtake, i still dont ahve the hang of that first corner and sometimes go wide. so the 3rd guy overtakes us both, since i didnt spin im 2nd, only few laps left i try my best to get onto him again, i know im faster than him. so im going and going almost overtaking him in the last 2 rounds and then it happens. second last corner on laguna seca im going to far spining...DRAMATICALLY...i finished 5th .. there was nobody faster in that race than myself and i fucked it up, i also ended with 16 mistakes, so almost making those 17. that was by far my worst race. my last race was also pretty bad, started 4th, about to overtake the 3rd guy and i slowly go onto him with me ending up spinning and wrecking my car. i thgought he was kicking me out but watching the replays of both cars, its hard to give anybody the fault. 3minute pitstop ending 10th out of 12th ..   im currently racing the mazda mx5cup on laguna seca as rookie, and i need friends badly. none of my actual friends play any racing games, i kinda feel lonely on that genre, would be awesome if id have anybody to talk with"
iRacing,3cdti8,gsxr1371,3,Tue Jul 7 03:21:32 2015 UTC,To fast track to any license you need to meet the MPR and have a SR of 4.0. It is only going from rookies to class D that you can fast track at 3.0 SR
iRacing,3cdti8,SkippyZA,5,Tue Jul 7 03:51:28 2015 UTC,If you can't get a SR of 4.0 you will have to wait until promotions go out at the end of the season which will be on September 14th
iRacing,3cdti8,kamiwut,2,Tue Jul 7 04:09:52 2015 UTC,"You need to reach 4.0 SR for instant promotion, or wait until the end of the season for promotion at 3.0+"
iRacing,3cdti8,nalyd8991,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:10:04 2015 UTC,"Regular promotions happen at the end of every season (three months). Each racing season is 12 weeks, followed by ""Week 13"" which is a off-week where theres a bunch of fun races and only a few rookie-centered official races. Promotions occur at the end of Week 13. I believe this season ends in the middle of September.  However, theres a ""fast track"" feature in place. If you achieve a Safety Rating of 4.0 (for D, C, and B class licenses. Rookie license only requires a 3.0), you will get instantly promoted.  Its not that easy, as the  higher you get the less SR you will get as well, but its certainly faster than the (close to) 3 months of waiting youve got since you just missed out on promotions."

iRacing,3cbz1r,laurik1299,2,Mon Jul 6 18:53:15 2015 UTC,"I run a McLaren in the GT3 class, but I must say that the Skip Barber is the most fun car in the entire game... so I would aim for that.  The lift-off oversteer is quite special to race, and something you won't find in other cars, but it's a blast, with very close racing and the series is quite popular and usually very populated."
iRacing,3cbz1r,eobet,3,Mon Jul 6 19:53:09 2015 UTC,Second this. The Skippy is one of the most rewarding cars.
iRacing,3cbz1r,tstraw48,2,Mon Jul 6 20:02:44 2015 UTC,The lift-off oversteer has been tamed down considerably with the latest updates (it's almost non-existent now). It's still huge in the SRF though. It's pretty much the only way to get that car to turn...
iRacing,3cbz1r,Sasken,3,Mon Jul 6 21:06:32 2015 UTC,"If you want relatively respectful and considerate racing, I suggest you consider the Spec Racer Ford series. It's also economical since you already own the car and they try to keep the track purchases to a minimum.  GT3 races can often be wreckfests, especially in the splits you're going to be getting in with 1250 IR. I'm not saying they ALL are, but it's the most popular road series and the cars are very fast and relatively easy to drive. So people get way over their head very quickly.  The SRF isn't a cool car and it isn't a fast car but it's some of the best racing on the service. (I raced it for many seasons before I decided to concentrate on the Skip Barber)."
iRacing,3cbz1r,Sasken,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:58:18 2015 UTC,"I was in the OP's shoes last season.. I had just started and made it out of rookies.  SRF was on a free track (Charolette Road, like it is this week) so I jumped in.  The guys there were super friendly and more than willing to share tips and setups with a complete newbie like myself.  The Forums have tons of lap guides and setups as well.    Long story short, I still haven't ""advanced"" out of SRF.  I did some TT's to keep advancing my license, but I've never run an official race anywhere else.  The people are great and the racing is close.  Eventually I imagine I'll move on, and take all the experience I'm learning in momentum conservation and driving at the absolute limit with me.  In short, it doesn't need to be fast to be exciting...  It's the only car I race and I'm not going anywhere anytime soon!"
iRacing,3cbz1r,ASKobayashi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:25:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of people think they have to ""advance"" like it's an MMO or something (and they have to level up). I have ""A"" licenses on both sides, because I had that attitude. But on the road side I've only really seriously raced D-class races (SRF for a long time and more recently Skip Barber).  When you find something you enjoy, there's no reason to ""move up"". I have raced the faster cars and I just don't like them as much as the Skippy."
iRacing,3cbz1r,Sasken,2,Tue Jul 7 13:45:04 2015 UTC,One thing all idiots have in common: they're not fast over the length of a race.  So practice and outqualify them and you'll probably won't find them on your path.
iRacing,3cbz1r,Eburon,2,Mon Jul 6 21:52:18 2015 UTC,"The skippy is great, I also enjoy the caddy and others as well. But really half of the learning is knowing how to avoid the idiots, sometimes it's unavoiadable but it'll do you good. You learn to spot them and keep distance, let them pass etc. rookies will try and pass anywhere (and crash) Vets will stalk you and plan their attack"

iRacing,3cbz1r,arsenicfox,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:13:55 2015 UTC,I got out of rookie last season my self and this is my first full season.  My end goal is to race in the IMSA series.  What I am doing is racing the Soec Ford racers.  It's a good group of guys that are respectful and engender helpful.  I am also facing the Solstice in the Grand Turing Cup.  It give me experiance with racing in mult class racing.
iRacing,3cbz1r,nomnamless,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:31:00 2015 UTC,"Similar situation here. I advanced from Rookie to D, after 2 clean races in the MX5 cup, 2 clean qualifying sessions and 2 clean time trials. It only took a weekend to escape Rookie, but now I'm at the situation where all the series need a cash investment.   I'm tempted to try the Skippy, but I have hardly any of the tracks. Ditto for pretty much each of other D class series.   I filtered by by C class, and I have my eye on the Indy Car fixed road series. That sounds like a lot of fun.   My main problem will be getting my MPR up. The only series I can really run without paying money are the Rookie ones.  I might just buy the Skippy and one of the upcoming tracks and do enough races there to hit my MPR. I'm not sure which of the  upcoming tracks is the best though. I really don't want to have to pay cash for a track I mightn't like and mightn't run again."
iRacing,3cbz1r,v3ttel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:34:05 2015 UTC,"Hi laurik, congratulations on making it out of Rookie Class, now the fun really begins.   I'm sure all of us iRacers at one time or another have felt your level of frustration and if I'm to be honest, you'll feel it again and again. Fortunately however it's offset by some of the best racing you'll experience anywhere so the good far outweighs the bad.   I've not raced Skip Barber so I can't comment on it as my progression was Mazda, Cadillac, Ruf C-Spec, McLaren/BMW. Each and every series had it's share of ups and downs but to be honest, the worst of them all has been GT3 by far.   You would think higher license classes would make for better drivers but you'd be dead wrong. See the issue is those that never practice in Rookie's, D-Class (etc, etc) don't change their habits so they cause issues wherever they go.   Then there are the straight up ""wrong place, wrong time"" incidents you'll get caught up in. I wouldn't let it get you down because it's a numbers game. You put more numbers into the same size track there is more opportunity for chaos especially when you add a world wide community with drivers of varying skill levels and dreaded netcode.   The best thing you can do for yourself is be smart about when you choose to race.   If you find yourself in lower splits then don't sign up for a race that will split 3 or 4 times. You will end up in a race full of lunatics and your license will suffer. Instead, run some Time Trials to gain SR and complete your MPR and run races that won't see you running with a bunch of lower split drivers.   Also, and I can't stress this enough, be patient!!!   If someone is clearly having issues in front of you, give them lots of room to screw up and yourself lots of room to react (even if that means stopping on track). This isn't Days of Thunder, you can't aim for the wreck because the chances are they won't be out of your way when you get there. You oftentimes need to be prepared enough to drive through the grass to get around wrecking cars; anything you can do to keep your car clean."
iRacing,3cbz1r,B2O-Duke,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying :) I'll try to be more patient, but I usually get greedy and I get competitive all of a sudden. For example, if a racer is behind me and he's approaching, I try to play as competitive as I can to mantain my position, even though it's not good for my SR but I like to experience sometimes. I usually get an off-track for that, for being under pressure and misleading my opponent's skills. Another example, if there's a crash in front of me, I usually stop accelerating but I'm not braking either, because I know I can escape the crash without incidents, but sometimes it happens that the accident is approaching into my direction and I struggle so much that I sometimes frontally hit it. Thanks for the advice though :)"
iRacing,3cbz1r,B2O-Duke,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:21:33 2015 UTC,"It's really difficult to not be competitive in this environment because it is racing after all lol. You just need a firm understanding of what your end goal is when racing.   If you're there for SR then do everything in your power to keep it clean and stay out of trouble. That may mean letting an aggressive driver pass but more often that not, if they're good aggressive they'd get past you anyway and if they're bad aggressive they'll just crash.   Assuming they crash out you don't want to be near them and there's a good chance you will be if he's trying to dive bomb at every opportunity.   These things have a way of taking care of themselves so it's best you just drive within your limits and defend of course but don't do so where it's negatively impacting your license or worse, putting you in a position to be protested (I've seen it happen).  Crash avoidance is another area that's touchy to some because there are some who say ""you can avoid every crash if you drive properly"" and others like me who think not every crash is avoidable (most are however).   All you can do is drive smart and put yourself in the best position possible to react to whatever happens around you. This often times does mean slowing down a bit however but ask yourself, is it better to lose a few tenths or Pit for a Black Flag?"
iRacing,3cbz1r,moge,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:16:57 2015 UTC,"Like many here I would recommend the Skippy. I am D class and have found the raced to be pretty clean. The skippy is pretty predicable to drive and, if anything, you oversteer the car off a corner rather than understeer so you don't get many mid-road pile ups.   The Skippy is also easy to setup as most setups ally across multiple tracks.   My career hopes are open wheel, specifically the Star Mazda so the Skippy is a great car to get into open wheel racing with."

iRacing,3cbz1r,Acurus_Cow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:25:38 2015 UTC,"it gets so frustrating when I'm surrounded by a lot of racers which I can't trust.   The only way to avoid incidents, is for you to avoid incidents. Don't blame other racers, that wont get you anywhere. You have to do what you can do to avoid incidents.  Be alert, give them plenty of room, don't race close, and watch them spin out in front of you."
iRacing,3cbz1r,gutterboy,2,Mon Jul 6 21:22:17 2015 UTC,"Agree, I went from rookie miata to skippy and pretty much all I race is the skippy.  I used to get mad, but now I find myself accepting there are going to be incidents with an open class like the skippy.  I have gotten much better at spotting when others are going to make mistakes and to give them plenty of room.  So many times I will be be one the gearbox of someone or in a pack that is battling, notice some risky moves by a car, and just back off a little.  They will either make a mistake themselves or they will take out the guy they are trying to pass.  There are ""idiots"" in F1, wrecking millions of dollars worth of car.  Of course there are going to be ""idiots"" in iRacing, you just need to learn to spot them better.   Out qualifying the riffraff is the most sure fire way to avoid incidents but gaining experience of running in a dicey pack is also a valuable skill.  That said, I have also had amazing side by side racing through multiple turns with rookie drivers or lower ranked ones. The respect for clean racing is far greater in iRacing than I have ever had in another game racing against strangers online."

Easy to race close, dynamic drifting is a cinch, and a big onus on clean racing.  I've done a bit of time in the spec, but don't really enjoy it. Not enough lock - but oversteery setups are the fastest :(, unbalanced, and that asthmatic engine. I'd rather race the mx-5 any day!

It has much higher participation than the SK Modifieds, and it's open setup so you can practice working on sets (something you have to do in the series you're interested in).

iRacing,3c5nzy,tommy44vercetti,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:40:10 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend getting modifieds.  When you buy modifieds, you get both the SK and Tour mods, so you will have another series to run when you get your C license.

iRacing,3c3sb9,johnny_tapia,5,Sat Jul 4 21:45:42 2015 UTC,"I understand the frustration of those complaining. Nothing worse than starting an official race, hoping to raise your SR so you can get promoted to the next license level, and some dimwit tries to go four wide in Turn 1 and wrecks the whole field, and you end the race multiple laps down with a loss of SR. Annoying as shit."
iRacing,3c3sb9,taidana,2,Sat Jul 4 17:08:36 2015 UTC,"Lol, the worst is if you only have time for one race and it is a road configuration on an oval course.  Inevitably, someone from the back will plow through the whole feild going straight in t1."

I have a feeling road guys would get just as bitchy as oval guys if we had a 5 minute full course caution every time two cars came together.  As was said in other replies, a hotkey for driver mute is the best thing you can do to avoid the sandy vagina syndrome people get during a caution.

iRacing,3c4ncf,Elemento1991,3,Sat Jul 4 19:10:12 2015 UTC,"I swap between different cars often. Sometimes you learn things from other cars that you can apply to other cars.  For example, the Skippy teaches weight transfer and keeping some throttle on while turning. And the Lotus 79 takes this concept to a higher skill level.  Once you find a series you like, try to run it every week and see how high up you can make it in the series standings.  Make friends with people who are fast with you and are consistent.   Higher splits and leagues with people you respect and challenge your skill make for some of the best racing you can get today."
iRacing,3c4ncf,WhyDoISuckAtW2,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:13:02 2015 UTC,I agree with you there 100%. I'm actually in a league on Project Cars and the competition is tight and clean. I usually do pretty good there but iRacing is a whole new challenge. I'm not sure if the drivers are faster or if I'm still getting used to its physics but iRacing is much less forgiving that's for sure.
iRacing,3c4ncf,sim-racingcouk,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:49:11 2015 UTC,"I swap between different cars often   This is not necessarily a bad thing, but without driving one car for a long period of time, you are very unlikely to master it.  The fast guys in the SRF tend to have driven just the SRF with the baseline setup for a whole season before they even think of playing with setup, so that they have a 100% understanding of what the car can do and what it can't.  I'm not saying you shouldn't drive what you like, but to be really fast in a specific car, I personally think you have to understand it fully before you can become one with it, so to speak."

iRacing,3c4ncf,BGaviator13,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:58:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I pick one each week.  Practice, qualifying, and racing put together are about as much time as I have for iracing each week right now.  Just running random races and starting in the back hurts my stats too much.  I run fixed Indy but lately I've been working on road irating, which I've gotten from 600 to about 1000 running Skippy in the past month.  That series is at Oulton and Indy is at Gateway.  I don't have those.  I do have Suzuka so I could do Star Mazda but with the holiday I'm pretty busy.  Maybe tomorrow."
iRacing,3c4ncf,sim-racingcouk,2,Sat Jul 4 22:31:47 2015 UTC,"Just need more time to develop. It's not uncommon to get faster and faster and then plateau. A lot of the top guys on the road side went through the same thing. They got to a point where their progress slowed down and they had to bust their ass to get the last little bit.   Time will bring the improvements you're looking for. Do more practicing, do more races. You'll get even more comfortable with the car and you'll be able to ask it for more without crashing."
iRacing,3c4ncf,sim-racingcouk,2,Sat Jul 4 23:03:00 2015 UTC,"I know I need to get more consistent, that's definitely one area I need to work on.  Do you guys have any pointers for continued improvement or is it just practice, practice, practice?   You answered your own question.  You need to practice on consistency.  This means throwing out the notion of speed.  It's not about how quick you are, it's about how consistent you can become, this in turn brings speed and skill.  Although it will bring speed, you still have to leave this thought to one side.  To become consistent, you have to be smooth and get into a rhythm that allows you to do the same thing over and over again, lap after lap after lap.  You can't really do this if you are balls to the wall the whole time (unless you're alien) so you have to find a compromise.  Say balls to the wall is 100% then you need to step it back a little, not a lot, but a little, to say 97%.  This way you are fully in control of your vehicle, you hit you marks every time and consistency comes.  Once you have consistency, speed will come and you'll realise that what you thought was a ""flattening off"" in your learning curve is the start of a whole new curve."
iRacing,3c4ncf,ZeeNewAccount,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:55:47 2015 UTC,"Thankyou for the detailed response, and that is what I need to do. I guess I've been programming into my head, faster, brake later, throttle earlier, this whole time I've been learning to this point. It's probably time to back off a bit now and trust my instincts instead of trying to push harder than I think I need to. I should focus on refining my techniques for a bit and get better at left foot braking as I usually right foot brake still after the straight aways and I need to get used to iRacings sequential without automatic blip. I'm still heel toe-ing the CTS-VR.  There's a guy in our racing league on project cars that runs world record lap pace almost the entire races and I think that might be why I've been trying to push so much harder. He was a GT Academy finalist. I was one of the front runners before he joined and I can't seem to find the extra time that he does to stay competitive with him. I have no clue how he does it, at some tracks he's 2-3 seconds per lap faster than the rest of us and that's including some of our guys that are like 8-15th position across all players on the time trials. It's been driving me to push that much harder as I do aspire to actually race one day, even if I have to fund it myself, but I suppose that skill may come in due time."

At the end of the day, everyone wants to be the fastest, but essentially you are racing the track.  Forget that some people are quicker than you, because by the same token there will always be people slower than you.  It's all about what you can do, not what others can do.  Their times should just be used as a guide.  If you can get to their pace fantastic, but not everything in life is possible, sometimes you just have to hold your hands up to the fact that some drivers have more talent than yourself, however hard you try."

iRacing,3c2ing,gsxr1371,6,Sat Jul 4 03:56:01 2015 UTC,"To cut a long story short, carb cup is the only series where races are NEVER official (official meaning it counts for iR and SR).   In addition, any race in any other series with 8 or more competitors is classified as official, as are all qualifying and time trial sessions (which count for SR but not iR. TTs count for TTRating but no one really cares about it). Some series (can't remember which, but they're lower participation series) have 6 of more as the requirement for going official.   When you join a race session, I think near the top right of the screen it will say if it's official or unofficial.   It's also worth noting that whilst races that don't go official don't count for iR, they do still count for SR (although at a 0.35 multiplier IIRC)."
iRacing,3c2ing,vmaxmuffin,2,Sat Jul 4 04:26:55 2015 UTC,"To add on that, TT and Warmup counts for SR, but  at a lower rate. I believe  qualifying is full SR rate? If not, its atleast higher tham warmup. Also, practice sessions never count for SR or iR.  On the small text box next  to the green button, it will either say ""race"" or simply ""unofficial race"". Thats how you tell, if youre wondering (if theres about 6-8 ppl etc)."

I'm just not afraid to be aggressive in my charge to the front. You have 23 laps or 25 laps in B class to get to the front. I'm not going to pussyfoot around the track for 20 laps and pray I get to the front in the last five and hope there's no caution.

Good amouny if corners, relatively quick laps = lots of SR.

Once you get to A you'll see what I mean... No way you'll be running only the A-car.  iRating and having fun is all that matters at some point, haven't looked at my s/r for such a long time.

iRacing,3c2wa5,nonothing,10,Sat Jul 4 19:12:10 2015 UTC,no you missed his point. A class is not an indication of skill. Irating is.
iRacing,3c2wa5,C-POP_Ryan,2,Sat Jul 4 11:32:38 2015 UTC,While the point that iRating = skill is accurate. Your post read like you assumed the OP means A class can (or should) only race A class.  The real problem is what the top post said. Some people get A class and think they're hot shit and g we t pissy when they lose some SR.  Last season I tanked to 1700 and C 1.7. I'm B 2.3 and jumped to 2300 IR in 3 weeks. It's always in flux. Gotta remember there's always another race to improve :)
iRacing,3c2wa5,nonothing,3,Sat Jul 4 12:19:52 2015 UTC,"Hitting A Class is easy as shit stay clean and finish the race.. It has no indication of skill at all or time spent on the sim.

Anyway,  if anyone thinks that an A class has no rights to be in a D class series the they're not understanding what the class system really is.

iRacing,3c2wa5,kaluh_glarski,2,Sat Jul 4 14:09:39 2015 UTC,Yup yup. IR matches people.  SR is there as an INITIAL buffer for jumping to the 'more difficult' cars.

Plus having 700ir in class A just means your put into a lower split with others around the same irating and it has no effect on others much much much quicker than you.."
iRacing,3c2wa5,Eburon,2,Mon Jul 6 16:01:51 2015 UTC,"It's a self-regulating problem.  People with high SR and IR who join lower races have a higher chance of getting into an un-avoidable incident.  At high license classes, incidents hurt your SR even more.  At higher iRating, if you don't win (or get high up in the ratings), you risk losing a lot of iRating.  Just run your own lines and take care of yourself. It's unfortunate you ran into one, but they'll learn their lesson."
iRacing,3c2wa5,WhyDoISuckAtW2,0,Sat Jul 4 08:35:13 2015 UTC,euh what... chances for incidents are a lot higher in lower class races because it's way harder to predict other drivers on the track. You don't know if they just started iracing and just lack experience or if they are lunatic drivers stuck in lower license levels for a reason.
iRacing,3c2wa5,arsenicfox,2,Sat Jul 4 09:26:29 2015 UTC,chances for incidents are a lot higher in lower class races because it's way harder to predict other drivers on the track   Indeed. That's why A licenses hate incidents more than B licenses - the penalty is higher. You can't maintain an A license by getting incidents during races. And racing lots of rookie races is too risky of a venture to keep your A license.

I got out of rookie and got into the K&N car and bought 2 tracks (sadly don't have anymore money for iracing at the moment), and since the tracks are short tracks I didn't know that you change into 3rd gear. When I asked after the race all of the higher up guys started telling me that I'm an idiot and moron for thinking that you stay in 4rd gear. I asked nicely, I always went out of the way and let the faster drivers pass and you get this shit after the race for asking a question?  I really didn't know what to think."

Did you really just join a race and then have a bunch of A class drivers call you noob over the radio the whole time? Or is there more to the story than that?

Before anyone jumps the gun and tells me to get a checking account. Yes, I have a checking account, but no, I do not have a debit card linked to it. As a student who pays for school through physical checks, I have never needed one. I have only run into a handful of games ever that requires you to link a card to a paypal account and it's unfortunate that iRacing is one of them. Even when trying to purchase subscriptions through steam (at twice the introductory cost), you are still prompted to pay using a line of credit. The excuse stated that you need a card to be able to make recurring payment is completely untrue, and is an unnecessary extra paywall that is probably keeping many people out of the game.

iRacing,3c19i4,Sasken,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:13:40 2015 UTC,"It would kinda suck, but the best solution you can probably do for that is to build a bracket to mount the wheel onto. The bracket should be designed with a post that goes up the centre between your legs and it is affixed to a flat board which goes UNDER your legs (this keeps the whole thing anchored). At the top of the post, another board is attached horizontally on which to mount the wheel. Pressure from your legs closing on the centre board and your weight on the floor board would keep the thing relatively stationary, but definitely a very suboptimal way to drive, especially because working the pedals will move your steering wheel around."

iRacing,3c1rx1,Elemento1991,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:12:02 2015 UTC,"You can race your way out of rookies. I did so last night. Not sure what split you were in, but if you say you were the leader, it shouldn't matter, sounds like you're fast enough to get away from the mid pack shenanigans. It's about accident avoidance, seeing a situation and reacting appropriately. Step one, get off the gas as soon as you think something is up. So what if you lose a position or two? It's better than an incident. Step two, turn the wheel to go either high or low of said accident, wherever the accident isn't. Locking up the brakes won't help you, and may make you part of the accident. These things sound simple, but took me a few instances of becoming part of an existing accident to figure out. Once you get a feel of avoiding accidents, your SR will skyrocket.  I was fortunate enough to have enough iRating and qualify well enough to be in the top split most of the time, but there were still accidents. It's about getting the feel and developing an instinct for getting around accidents and avoiding collisions. There is no magic pill, it's just seeing a situation develop, and get around it.   I posted a thread asking for tips for accident avoidance here last week, some good tips:  http://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/3bmh8w/anyway_to_practice_accident_avoidance/"
iRacing,3byc25,JMagnani,3,Fri Jul 3 04:08:12 2015 UTC,"For LRP in the MX-5, I'm guessing it's 4th->3rd thats getting you.  The entry speed for that corner is too high to go into 3rd before you start turning, what I tend to to is shift about halfway through the corner. (go past the first apex, stabilise, shift, go into the second apex)  As a bonus, a lot of people in rookies will slow enough to enter the corner in 3rd, so once you've got the line right for 4th->3rd cornering, it opens up some passing opportunities, just make sure you can hold it first. (And make sure you can get alongside proper during braking)"
iRacing,3byc25,pznz,3,Fri Jul 3 06:16:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's the 4th to 3rd that gets me around the corner. I'll try the shifting half way through when I get stabilized, thanks!"
iRacing,3byc25,pznz,3,Sat Jul 4 03:54:51 2015 UTC,"As LAborn_TXraised said, you do have to be careful downshifting in a corner. So you do have to make sure you are stable before you shift.  This can mean leaving it a lot later than you think you should. Sometimes I get into third before I turn into the second apex, sometimes I am starting to accelerate before I get into third."
iRacing,3byc25,LAborn_TXraised,2,Sat Jul 4 04:08:01 2015 UTC,Gotta be careful downshifting in a corner. That's a great way to spin.
iRacing,3byc25,pznz,3,Fri Jul 3 17:55:40 2015 UTC,"This is true.  My advice was more for a ""this specific car in this specific corner (or complex of corners, since it's 1-2)"" situation where third is a gear too low for entry (Can lead to spinning blowing the engine, or sometimes spinning even if you shift while pointed straight) and fourth is too high for exit (this car really bogs down with low revs).  And there is a point between 1 & 2 where you can get the car stabilised enough to shift safely."
iRacing,3byc25,RileyF1,2,Sat Jul 4 04:13:44 2015 UTC,Either turn on auto blip or blip the throttle manually.
iRacing,3byc25,RaceBird,2,Fri Jul 3 04:10:24 2015 UTC,"might be down shifting to soon, maybe delay it or try holding it in a higher gear until you feel confortable."
iRacing,3byc25,randomkontot,2,Fri Jul 3 04:22:06 2015 UTC,"Probably this. If you want to try it, simply don't downshift. Just brake and keep in fifth and see if you make the corner then. If you do, you probably downshift way too early and lock the tires. Also, if you're new to simracing it might be best not to try rev-matching and heel-toe just yet. Use the paddles with auto clutch and auto blip for a little while."

If so, try being smooth with your inputs as otherwise the weight transfer of the car will kill you pretty much every time.  Although the brakes help to slow you down, think of them more as helping you to balance the car rather than an on/off tap of stopping power, this might help."

iRacing,3bvd3t,AndrewCoja,5,Thu Jul 2 13:58:32 2015 UTC,My desk was falling apart after about a week of use w/the CSW.  Crazy strong.
iRacing,3bvd3t,LewisKiniski,2,Thu Jul 2 14:57:29 2015 UTC,Did you upgrade from another wheel? What are the main differences you feel? I have a GT2 but I'm always tempted to drop the cash for a CSW or t500.
iRacing,3bvd3t,shadowofashadow,10,Thu Jul 2 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"From the G27.  It's hard to describe the differences.  When I got the G27 I thought it was really nice.  But there really isn't a comparison in build quality when you're talking about something like the CSW.  It's roughly 3x the price, and I'd say it feels proportionately (3-5x) better.  Build quality as in, it's metal and not plastic, it's heavy, the wheel turns smoother, the force feedback is smoother - not as in mass-produceable.  But when I go back and turn the G27 now, it's just apparent it's a budget rig even though it didn't feel that way when I first got it.  When you turn the wheel you get this weird... plasticy?... sensation in the steering column that you don't get w/the CSW.  I'm pretty sure the G27 will have fewer reliability issues:  I can already hear the fans in the CSW chirping sometimes and things like the USB plug doesn't go in very tight and can fall out if the force feedback shakes it hard enough.  Plus table clamp is super-heavy and really inconvenient.  If you're using a desk with a keyboard tray, be prepared to have to remove it when you want to use the cumbersome table clamp.  That shit is so inconvenient I literally just said fuck it and bought an Obutto R3volution and three monitors within a week of the CSW arriving.  The general consensus of ""upgrade pedals first"" is 100% correct.  If you don't have load cell brakes, fucking get some now.  It helps so much.  The wheel is more of a comfort thing IMO.  I hate the baby wheel diameter of the G27 and grabbed the F1 Carbon, GT, and Oval rims and I like them a lot.  The F1-style wheel is really cool, but surprisingly tough to get used to (your hands are at 3 and 9 o'clock and you can't move them).  I never realized how much I wanted to move my hands when using the G27 until I couldn't w/the F1-style rim.  The GT wheel is my favorite.  The quality of the GT & Oval wheels are okay I'd say.  The wheels themselves are nice as well as the material that covers them.  I bought some gloves to keep them clean.  I'm a little disappointed by how big a pain in the ass it is to swap things out on the Universal Hub but whatever it's an infrequent hassle.  Overall I'd say if you're in ""this is my hobby"" territory, go ahead and get whatever the fuck you want (so long as you can afford it).  And be prepared to want/have to spend more like I did.  If you play other games a lot, don't have a ton of room in the house, spend a lot of time doing other hobbies (guitar etc.), or think you'll get bored or something - maybe stay away.  This stuff gets really expensive when you end up dropping money for cockpits and such.  But even in that case, if it's your hobby - fucking do it if you want to.  Even with all this stuff, iRacing is still probably less expensive than golf where you need club memberships (or pay through the nose per round), clubs every year or two, balls, clothing, and the like.  I'd also say that considering the problems I've had with the CSW, I in no way regret my purchase (okay, maybe the need for the cockpit sucked but the cockpit is so cool I'm already over it) but it made me appreciate how good the people at Logitech are at what they do.  That wheel is affordable, feels great to someone that hasn't used something like the CSW, and is compact, convenient, and reliable all for ~$200.  Edit:  just noticed you aren't OP /u/antnx.  Linking him here because he may find this useful."
iRacing,3bvd3t,LewisKiniski,3,Thu Jul 2 18:42:47 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for such a detailed reply. Bummer that even after spending all that money parts of the CSW still feel a little shakey. I had the same experience with my GT2 and clubsport pedals. They are nice but something just feels slightly unpolished about them. I always feel like they could have issues any moment.  Anyways, thanks again. I think the major reason I'd want to upgrade is the wheel rim size. The GT2 wheel just feels so tiny."
iRacing,3bvd3t,shadowofashadow,2,Thu Jul 2 18:46:30 2015 UTC,"Well I solved the table clamp problem by hard mounting to my new rig, I have a tiny piece of tape dealing w/the occasional disconnected USB plug, and the fans only chirp occasionally.

iRacing,3bvd3t,aliencougar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:28:38 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're looking for tho. Have to understand that, yes, pedals do make you faster, but a stronger, bigger wheel does add more nuance to the ""dull"" iRacing FFB. :) A G27 only puts out 2.5Nm. A Fanatec wheel is 7Nm. The Accuforce is 13. And you can build an Open Sim Wheel that can output around 20Nm.   ;) So, it's not just for show anymore. [According to David Tucker, the G27 is rated at 1/10th the average strength of most of the FFB forces they send]"
iRacing,3bvd3t,arsenicfox,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:42:32 2015 UTC,IMO the brake pedal feel is a more drastic change.  You can get the same FFB response from a G25/G27 but it will just be at a lower torque.

Currently,  I'm running CSR Elite pedals and a G27 wheel. I think a minimum setup needs a load cell pedal with clutch (for standing starts a clutch still works for sequential cars) and a 900° rotation wheel.   Outside of the low FFB strength of the g27, you can solve small wheel diameter with a hub replacement kit."

Kits are selling now for $1025 us shipped that include everything except for a rim and a way to mount the motor. The kits are even solder free, you just need to attach a few connectors and flash some firmware. A rim can be had for $100 through fanatec and you can buy a nice mount for 60 euros from Martin Ascher. You would probably want to add paddles or buttons to your rim but it's not too tough. Alternatively you can have Sam Maxwell build you a beautiful rim.   In any case you could have build the wheel on a budget for $1200 and still have money for clubsport pedals."
iRacing,3bvlz9,duck74UK,5,Thu Jul 2 14:49:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's going to depend. You have to think carefully but quickly. Assume where the racing line is. How far is the car behind you. Sometimes I can adjust my racing line if you stay where you are, but blind corners are a bad place to sit.   Also, when you get hit, or slide off track, do not be afraid to just sit on the brakes. A lot of people just let the car fly around, not realizing they could actually remove a lot of collateral damage by just sitting on the brakes (example: that car that's spinning in the infield that ends up just flying up the track at 150 MPH) Sometimes just getting out of the way helps too.  Example: The NIS B Class race at daytona.  https://youtu.be/bu9p7ZekxUM?t=2575"
iRacing,3bvlz9,arsenicfox,2,Thu Jul 2 16:05:10 2015 UTC,That's my default on ovals. Hold the brakes until it comes to a stop and there's no traffic. Then move to the apron. Figure out what's next from there.
iRacing,3bvlz9,LAborn_TXraised,3,Thu Jul 2 16:13:28 2015 UTC,"""When You Spin, Both Feet In""  If your car is out of control with no hope of regaining any sort of control, you slam the brake and the clutch. This makes your car at the least go in a straight line, as the rotation of the wheels will no longer be forcing you to lurch in unexpected directions.  Of course if you're in a car with an agressive ABS setting (such as possible in the GT3 cars), this isn't particularly helpful."
iRacing,3bvlz9,Silent_Hastati,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:15:35 2015 UTC,Usually your best bet is to just slam the brakes so the car slides in one direction and is easily avoidable.

If its my fault, I am somewhat passive in recovery of the vehicle and how I make it back on track.  If its not my fault, I am a little more aggressive when doing this.  Either way, if I dont smash up the car or anyone else then I see it as a victory, or atleast as much of a victory that you can snatch from the clutches of defeat.  : )"

iRacing,3bo834,CatchingCoyotes,0,Wed Jul 1 05:28:23 2015 UTC,"Semi-related, have dynamic tires been implemented yet? As in building heat through scuff and restarts being sketch as your tires are cooler? (Been away from iRacing for awhile)"
iRacing,3bo834,b3ttykr0ck3r,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:29:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. Tires heat up and cool down depending on your driving style. If you're tires get to hot, you can let them cool down again by easing off in the corners."
iRacing,3bo834,b3ttykr0ck3r,0,Wed Jul 1 06:51:51 2015 UTC,So is tire scuff/building heat in pace laps beneficial then? (I hesitate to even ask this question because of all the possible things that can go wrong with inexperienced drivers not knowing what they are doing and just doing it to look cool)
iRacing,3bo834,b3ttykr0ck3r,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:04:16 2015 UTC,"Weaving during the pace laps does not work. You don't get as much heat in the tires as dragging the brake and throttle. And as you said, doing this in the virtual world does only create dangerous situations.   Weaving is also more used to clean the tires I believe."
iRacing,3bo834,arsenicfox,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:19:11 2015 UTC,"Weaving does 2 things in real life. We use it to both clean (scuff) and heat. The heating is not as significant but can seriously mess up your restart if you don't.   The best way to put heat in the rear tires on pace laps is to allow a gap between you and the car in front, mash the gas to spin the tires a little and get on the brakes hard when you start to get close. Hard to describe but simple in practice.   We use the Hoosier F53 tire which gathers heat rather quickly, it just doesn't retain it all that well and the tires have a rather short lifespan, about 50-70 laps on a .395 mile track is considered average for race tires."
iRacing,3br2gb,kaluh_glarski,3,Wed Jul 1 13:40:13 2015 UTC,"Keep your line as best as you can. If you start having really bad issues, just get off the track. I have a small issue where, occasionally, I'll get a long blip. It only happens every 3 hours or so, kind of spontaneously.  I honestly blame the fact that I'm tethering with an iPhone (instead of a Moto X like I used to do) and that seems to cause an issue. Cause iPhones have horrible connection problems. :(  But yeah. Just keep calm. Pay attention. If it gets ""bad"", you should get off the track. You'd have to make that judgement and deal with the consequences though. :)   [Though sometimes they yell at you and get everyone riled up and it wasn't actually your fault. They could've had a dropped connection too. Can sometimes also be server blips. Etc. Lots of different causes.]"
iRacing,3br2gb,arsenicfox,3,Wed Jul 1 13:50:22 2015 UTC,Tethering at all will give you a bad connection if you're using the mobile data connection

iRacing,3br2gb,arsenicfox,2,Wed Jul 1 19:58:30 2015 UTC,"well if I know about it, as in everyone else disappears occasionally, I just get right out of it, and park until I know the cause. But I also know that you cannot always tell if you have a problem.  I can recall one skippy race where suddenly the car infront went crazy and disappeared. When he reappeared I had no where to go and hit him, Looking back I should have been even more cautious,  but the guy complained I'd done it on purpose, and was threatening a protest. I explained he vanished but he was having none of it. I saved the replay I had just in case, although nothing ever came of it.  In fact I doubt the replay kept the warping anyway.   Shit happens like that, and sometimes it can't be helped"
iRacing,3br2gb,bouncebackability,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:32:21 2015 UTC,"yea when people start blinking or when the whole field disappears thats when I know it time to be on high alert.

iRacing,3br2gb,Silent_Hastati,2,Wed Jul 1 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"What's happening is your upstream bandwith is being choked, while downstream isn't. This happens quite frequently with DSL because of the low speeds of such connections (3mbps/1mbps DL/UL isn't unheard of), so whats happening is your internet cannot handle all the outgoing packets, but can handle the incoming ones just fine. The best bet is if it's a shared connection to properly set up QoS on your router to give the iRacing machine priority."

It's unfair as well IMO - I had one of those at Interlagos last week in SM. You really have to get close on the last tight turn before the main straight to get ahead. The guy in front was all over the show, blinking off for a few secs constantly and driving really loose, and running low downforce so I couldn't pass."

iRacing,3br122,AndrewCoja,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:41:48 2015 UTC,I think some of the cars do have live tire temps. Otherwise it's just what the game measures when you stop in your pit box.

Ive always wanted, not live (second by second), but updates each time you cross the line (similarly, the estimated laps in the fuel black box would behave the same). As it stands, its hard to know if youre tires are actually worn a lot, or youre just overheating them."
iRacing,3br122,TheSturmovik,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:18:17 2015 UTC,"Well you have to remember, even if you could, in real life the only readings you could get from your tires would be pressure and temp."
iRacing,3br122,InZomnia365,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:02:06 2015 UTC,"Even that would be beneficial though, as there is some correlation between that and tire wear.

iRacing,3br122,TheSturmovik,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:08:31 2015 UTC,RUF for example has tire pressures on the dash.

iRacing,3bpiza,bahnzo,3,Wed Jul 1 02:53:54 2015 UTC,"My last racing was with RFactor and that popular online site for racing. I couldn't stand that place, how racing was policed and how racers allowed to cheat and wreck with impunity. I'm sure iRacing isn't that way, but anyone care to comment on just how strict policies are there?  Cheating and wrecking are enforced by your safety rating and a reporting system. Your safety rating is determined by how many incidents per race you have. Incidents are determined as going off track (1x) losing control (2x) and hitting other cars (4x). If you get more than 17x in a race you are disqualified.  Having a good safety rating is imperative to going up the licence classes.  If you have a major issue you can report someone by saving a replay and filing a complaint with Iracing. They will then have someone review the replay and deal out punishements, if appropriate to the offending party.  How's the server stability?  Server stability is mostly good. Although after their last update some people, including myself have had a few issues with being disconnected. but on the whole it is quite good.  I'm mostly a road racer. When I see stuff about iRacing it seems to focus on the ovals. Am I going to have a harder time finding races/series, especially here on US evening time?  No that should not be a problem, there is plenty of road action to be had. http://www.iracer.info/ shows how many people participate in each series.  Is there any demo? And what about cars and tracks...can I try them before I buy them?  No there is no demo. The best way to start is to look out for promotions where you can get a discounted 3 month subscription. once you are subscribed you have access to the rookie cars and tracks. So you could go through the rookie series on both road and oval without spending any more money. Any additional cars or tracks cannot be tested before purchase unfortunately.  And when is the Nordschleife due out? I can't race a sim that doesn't have that track.  Not sure about that one, I think I remember hearing November possibly?"
iRacing,3bpiza,Obesity_,2,Wed Jul 1 03:57:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I saw the free 3-month code on the sidebar, so that's good enough to give it an install.   I'm really hoping that even the slight ""pay to play"" kinda helps enforce some common sense. I realize we all make mistakes, but the other place(s) are just too stupid anymore and I can't bother spending hours in practice only to be wrecked by someone. Hoping the rating system really works here."
iRacing,3bpiza,Obesity_,2,Wed Jul 1 04:03:41 2015 UTC,I think the pay system definitely does keep some people away. That being said don't be disheartened if things get loose in the rookie leagues. That's where everyone is still learning and mistakes will be abundant. After that it definitely improves.
iRacing,3bpiza,randomkontot,2,Wed Jul 1 04:11:30 2015 UTC,It helps a lot. Oval racing seems to mostly be better represented here on this subreddit. You won't have any issues finding races.   Just be mindful that because of the free trial you might notice a lot of crap racing in the rookie series. Just stay safe and get to D class and it will improve a lot.
iRacing,3bpiza,MyNameIsTrue,2,Wed Jul 1 06:23:02 2015 UTC,"Don't race for position in the rookies. Race for a clean sheet. You could finish first in ten races with ten incidents in each, and the guy who raced four or five clean ones will get promoted before you. There's no bragging rights in winning in the rookies, it's like winning the best looking turd contest."

iRacing,3boz1o,Elemento1991,2,Tue Jun 30 23:41:29 2015 UTC,"Looks like you're over-slowing for a few corners. The caddy actually turns in fairly well as you lift off the throttle just to get some weight on the nose (sometimes you might need to apply a feather of brake to achieve this).  Also try smoother pedal inputs. Sometimes having a tiny bit of throttle just before the apex allows you to roll more onto the throttle slowly and track out nicely.  Finally, try iSpeed. It lets you see what faster people are doing with their pedal/steering inputs and you can see where you're losing the most time."

This is probably your biggest time waste."
iRacing,3bob8e,FriendInElektro,3,Tue Jun 30 20:39:45 2015 UTC,You will get cleaner racing with the legends than on street stock.
iRacing,3bob8e,wygo,3,Tue Jun 30 23:12:37 2015 UTC,That would work and it's exactly what I did. Once you do 4 truck races you will get your MPR and get your C license since you have the 4.0 SR.

iRacing,3bob8e,Ass-Packer,2,Tue Jun 30 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"I just did this at the end of last season. I wanted tho run some Indy car oval races, so I did street stock until I got D 4.0.

iRacing,3bob8e,pleaseexcusemytpyos,2,Wed Jul 1 03:51:58 2015 UTC,You don't even have to buy anything to get your C license if you're willing to wait. You can get your license to D 4.0 and then wait until Week 6 when the C Class Street Stocks run at USA International Speedway (Free car + Free track). Run 4 time trials to meet your MPR. Boom.

iRacing,3bob8e,retop56,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:01:41 2015 UTC,Oh OK then just get D 4.0 and you can race trucks. I would suggest you do 4 time trials in Trucks to complete your MPR and get a fast-track promotion to C license so if you wreck in your first truck race you won't have to grind your SR back to 4.0.

iRacing,3bm5c7,tstraw48,2,Tue Jun 30 12:45:26 2015 UTC,This was what I was gunna say... iRacing emails me for almost everything lol
iRacing,3bm5c7,thisguysmokey,4,Wed Jul 1 16:43:13 2015 UTC,lol...because iracing is the only company in the world that does this.
iRacing,3bm5c7,TheRealOEM,2,Tue Jun 30 14:30:08 2015 UTC,"Its a common thing. NBA League Pass does it, World of Warcraft does it, and those are only the few ones I use that I know about. Atleast iRacing is the most open and visible about it with a big button right under the subscription button. NBA League Pass was absolute bullshit and didnt even have a way to cancel it without sending them a fucking email."
iRacing,3bm5c7,InZomnia365,2,Tue Jun 30 18:24:52 2015 UTC,I don't see what the issue is. You are adding your details to iRacing for a subscription. If you check the definition for subscription it is:   the action of making or agreeing to make an advance payment in order to receive or participate in something.   I am also pretty damn sure that it is stated in the terms and conditions that you accept when you sign up for the service.  Ignorance is not an excuse  Edit: Just looked at the subscription page and it clearly states this on the page:   Subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel your membership in the My Account section of the website.
iRacing,3bm5c7,SkippyZA,3,Tue Jun 30 12:48:51 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a scam, the auto renew option should be off by default. I got some frustated friends who got a mounth of iracing for free and forgot to turn it off. iRacing just lost some potential iRacers there."
iRacing,3bm5c7,_Deh,4,Tue Jun 30 10:52:32 2015 UTC,Why leave your credit card details in it if you don't plan on using the service? Seems pretty careless?

If you give your credit card details to something, it only makes sense that you should find out if/when it will charge you.   You may as well be saying that you gave your credit card to some stranger and now you are pissed because they decided to use it."

iRacing,3bm5c7,kaluh_glarski,4,Tue Jun 30 23:02:55 2015 UTC,At least turning it off is easy. There was a time with Xbox where you literally couldn't turn it off. You had to call them and even then it was a huge hassle.
iRacing,3bm5c7,shadowofashadow,6,Tue Jun 30 14:20:28 2015 UTC,"Almost every system that has a renewal system like that has auto-renew turned on by default. Elder Scrolls Online [At least it did before it was free to play], Adobe Creative Cloud, Team Treehouse.   Seems to me like you just forgot to tell your friends about auto-renew. I, however, have had several people try iRacing and love it, and remembered to inform them of auto-renew."
iRacing,3bm5c7,arsenicfox,3,Tue Jun 30 12:20:06 2015 UTC,I do agree it shouldn't turn back on. They do make it clear that it's going to auto renew and its not hidden to disable it so I can't fault them on that.

If I tell a service I'm not goint to auto-renew, why would they just go and assume I want to auto-renew the next time i want to play for a 3-month period. I still don't and never will. They're after my money and not in a very honest way."
iRacing,3bm5c7,Paleman81,8,Tue Jun 30 12:41:15 2015 UTC,You're signing up for an iRacing SUBSCRIPTION on a 3 month basis. Not just buying 3 months. So of course it's going to set it to auto-renew  It's your own fault for forgetting to change it

iRacing,3bmh8w,cincydash,4,Tue Jun 30 12:20:35 2015 UTC,"The advice here is good, but one thing that hasn't been mentioned is learning to predict accidents.   There is no ""one thing"" to look for when trying to predict an accident, but the more you race the more you should be able to feel something bad is about to happen. Is the car ahead of you all over the track? Diving in too hard? Getting loose on exits? Cars ahead going 2 or even 3 wide? A slow car being approached by some faster cars? There are many things that can signal trouble is coming soon.   If you can start to ""smell"" an accident coming up, you can make it easier to react because you've already started doing the mental preparation. You have already started to think about where it may end up, what your escape route is and what you need to worry about during your maneuver. Avoidance is easier at USA because the speeds are lower and the car can come under control more easily. Things happen much faster at Charlotte, but on the plus side it can also be easier to smell trouble coming.   The points about practicing braking and different lines are good, but I think that being able to predict a problem is just as important."
iRacing,3bmh8w,bozboy204,3,Tue Jun 30 14:28:29 2015 UTC,"There's only a few things you can do without other people around crashing:  Run different lines occasionally: instead of turning the corner normally, pretend there's a huge pileup at the apex so you need to make your line more like a diamond shape. Also take the absolute outside line as if you're 3 or 4 wide. If you practice this so that you can do it smoothly, then you'll instinctively achieve the same thing when there's an incident in a race that requires you to change your line.  Practice hard braking, both in a straight line and while turning. Once you can do it fairly smoothly, practice hard braking down to a slightly lower speed, letting off the brake and changing direction, and then braking hard again.  These are the most common things I end up doing during  accident avoidance.   Unfortunately you'll find that some people are completely incapable of avoiding you even when they see you braking in front of them, but this doesn't always happen or sometimes they freak out so much they hit the wall solo and miss you. But it's all you can do really. It happens less at higher ratings."
iRacing,3bmh8w,WhyDoISuckAtW2,2,Tue Jun 30 12:39:41 2015 UTC,"When i see a crash and smoke ahead of me, i lay off the gas and i start braking to give myself more room and time to react but the guys behind me proceed to fucking rear end my bumper cause theyre still going flat out. Thats the only problem i have with braking hard to avoid a collission. Ive done it 3 times where i braked so i could just coast by the collision, but nope, all 3 times it just created a bigger accident lol"
iRacing,3bmh8w,TML_Skidd,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:47:02 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm afraid of.  Or locking my own tires up and adding to the collision.    I realize I'm not the caliber of driver that NASCAR drivers are, but typical they tend to get off the gas and manage their way through the accident.  I try to do the same, and end up making contact anyway."

You could also go into a practice session with other drivers.  Honestly, if you qualify and race up near the front you won't have nearly as many problems"

I don't believe it's bound by default, go into your control options and you'll be able to set it under ""In-Car Systems"". I forget exactly how many push-to-passes there are, perhaps someone else can answer that here.   It's most effective to use it exiting corners before long straights for obvious reasons."

iRacing,3bl7dd,vmaxmuffin,3,Tue Jun 30 03:32:55 2015 UTC,"To add to what u/4InchesOfury said, it used to be 10 pushes to pass per race (as it is in the real world), although that is a lot in a short race so I'm not sure if they've still got it that way. IIRC there's a counter on the wheel that tells you how many you have left.  You can use it whenever you like, to attack or defend, or even to push on an in/out lap to jump a car in the pits. It's not like DRS in F1 where you can only use it when you're within a second of the car in front."
iRacing,3bl7dd,frdalton,2,Tue Jun 30 04:53:17 2015 UTC,"To fill in some details the others have mentioned.  You get 10 per ROAD race, none on the ovals.  This number is the same between the longer open races or the shorter fixed races.  The number on the far right of your wheel shows how many you have left during a race session, or how many you have used in a practice session.  P2P does not work in qualifying sessions.  As for the amount of boost, I'm not sure about the actual HP numbers, but it feels kinda like a draft even if you don't have one.  You'll notice at the end of the straight that you're a few hundred RPM higher than you would have been."

iRacing,3bi6wh,ShotgunFelatio,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:06:13 2015 UTC,"Nice!  I never played 15, but 14 was virtually undriveable for me with a controller, never tried it with a wheel.  I ended up getting frustrated and quit playing it.  From what I understand, the game is designed by a team in Europe that appears to be out of touch with the sport.    I also recognize the expense and effort to create an in depth racing game with 29 different tracks, three different series, with the projected interest and monetary return for console gamers may not balance each other out.  Other sports, such as football, baseball, soccer, and hockey are probably easier to adapt field to field and rink to rink, whereas every race track is different, some more drastic to other.    I'm not even sure NASCAR 14 is even suitable to arcade gamers as, again, with a controller, it's virtually undriveable.  Most arcaders want to jump in and drive.  There's a market there, hopefully someone can take the lead on it.  I feel like iRacing is doing a great job addressing the hardcore sim racing market."

iRacing,3biwlb,jordan7741,2,Mon Jun 29 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"This is excellent advice. Let the other guy try to shove his way through other people.

iRacing,3biwlb,robun,3,Mon Jun 29 16:51:29 2015 UTC,Is it normal? Yes. Many people try to win the race in the first few corners. Is it acceptable? It really shouldn't be. Most of the super aggressive drivers in the opening laps seem to be the ones who get wrecked out and complain loudly about it.
iRacing,3biwlb,Homem_do_Bussaco,3,Mon Jun 29 16:31:32 2015 UTC,"I just try to avoid these drivers. They will dive at any chance, and I let them go because I won't risk my race for one position. 80% of the times they end up crashing, rant and disconnect."

iRacing,3biwlb,RileyF1,3,Mon Jun 29 16:39:02 2015 UTC,On the first lap that's definitely what you want to do. Even with stronger competition.
iRacing,3biwlb,bozboy204,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:35:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it shouldn't be unacceptable. Some of the best racing I've had is when being super aggressive on the first lap but then  again I do race in the top split, pretty much everyone is very aggressive but just knows what they're doing."
iRacing,3biwlb,bozboy204,2,Tue Jun 30 03:41:17 2015 UTC,"This sounds like your opponent got too aggressive and left no room for error on either your part or his. If he clipped your rear and spun you out, then he wasn't past you. So long as you were in front of him, he is the one responsible for avoiding an incident. That doesn't mean that the car in front can be all over the track and blocking, but so long as you were racing a predictable line, it is his responsibility to either pass you safely or back off until there is a better chance to pass.  That being said, you can't trust your fellow drivers and echoing the sentiment of others, it can be better in the long run to just give up the position early. Let him drive aggressively and recklessly. He is almost certain to push too hard and take himself out, maybe even another driver farther up the track. So while it doesn't sound like you did anything wrong, it can be more practical to just give up the position, especially since it is only lap 1.   For drivers like your opponent, the mentality of going in super aggressive on lap 1 will likely get them several positions on lap 1. That doesn't mean that it is smart, because they are also risking a crash on lap 1 much more often than other drivers, and over time they are going to put themselves out of contention of a lot of races before they even complete a lap.   Even in the Skippy series the races are long enough that giving up a position or two on the first lap isn't going to jeopardize your finishing position at all. If you're faster than them, it will sort itself out. If you give up the position and can't catch them then you should be happy that you are free from a losing battle and can now focus on your race without an opponent up your butt.   TLDR: Fighting for every inch on lap 1 isn't wrong, but it is often more practical to let things settle out first. Lap 1 crashes are the most frustrating, so it generally pays to be more cautious than not to avoid them. Give yourself the rest of the race to make up that spot."
iRacing,3biwlb,pleaseexcusemytpyos,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:39:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that helps! I think for me, the confusing thing was that I had the corner going in, he overtook during and swung back out of my blind spot so I clipped his rear. So I think it's kind of both of us.  My problem was that with all the other cars around, I didn't even notice him (or I would have just let him have it). I was busy avoiding the cars on my right when suddenly he was there on my left, swinging into me. I think the lesson here is, take a little time to check who's being aggressive and make a mental note to avoid them at all times :)"
iRacing,3biwlb,Rascal2pt0,2,Mon Jun 29 19:48:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a normal racing incident to me. Awareness comes with experience, and running a single monitor setup makes it harder to know what is around you (I'm in the same boat). As you race more you'll get better at predicting which drivers merit trust. Lap 1 is the hardest lap as everyone is close and pumped up for the race.   The best way to learn patience is to see it actually work for you. Letting a car by, then passing them later after they took themselves out of the race is a great feeling."

iRacing,3biuub,lethaltyrant,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:58:59 2015 UTC,The one email mentioned UDP it may be a port thing. See if you can do any port forward or even attempt to use a DMZ in your router if you have one. Also virus/malware protection or even firewall may block it. I know you say its initially working but I have started playing something and later realize my windows firewall was asking me to allow or block the game. Also other apps on the phone could interfere maybe. There have been apps I have seen after uninstalling or installing phone runs completely different. Just listing things I would try in your position. Lastly I might try a factory reset on my phone and just install that one app see if it works and start installing other apps to make sure nothing stops it. Good luck.

iRacing,3bh9ta,Sasken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:36:13 2015 UTC,Try lowering your min force for your FFB in iRacing.
iRacing,3bh9ta,SkippyZA,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:26:07 2015 UTC,"The problem comes from the fact that the wheel is trying to center itself, but it has no way of stopping once it has; thus inertia carries it slightly past the center point.  It then has to immediately correct the other way, rotates past the center point due to inertia, and the cycle continues.  Unfortunately, short of upgrading to a direct-drive wheel, your only option really is fiddling with your FFB settings until you eliminate it as best you can- it may never fully go away with a gear- or belt-driven wheel."
iRacing,3bh9ta,h3r4ld,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:36:59 2015 UTC,There's a stickied thread in the dalara sub-forum on the iRacing forums with info on how to fix the wheel shake

iRacing,3bh9ta,nashbar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:41:00 2015 UTC,"[Force Feedback] steeringFFBSmooth=1.0  This applies some smoothing to the FFB output, and is the only good way to stop a car that chatters too much from banging your hands to pieces. Damping will only make the problem worse, so use this instead. However before you apply smoothing make sure you are not overdoing it with the min force slider. The number is an odd one, you want to set it to 1/n where n is the number of samples to smooth, so 1/2 or 0.5 smooths two samples, 1/3 or 0.33 smooths 3 samples, 1/4 or 0.25 smooths 4 samples and so on. Going much past 1/5 or 0.2 is only going to add latency and not improve things at all for you. Oh and the default of 1/1 or 1 means one sample, or no smoothing at all."

iRacing,3bfrus,FriendInElektro,21,Sun Jun 28 20:56:07 2015 UTC,"One thing that always should be stressed the most when crashing, is to slow down. So while you did a good job holding a steady line and moving away from the crash, I recommend just slowing the car down some more. You did a good job. It was 65% bad luck. Rest was just not enough braking. Good job on asking for advice! That's what were all here for!"
iRacing,3bfrus,Swagdonkey400,8,Sun Jun 28 23:39:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed. You did very well in not trying to just plow through the crash. Yes, you probably should have slowed down sooner/more, but in the end, it was almost entirely bad luck that got you.  It doesn't make you any less wrecked in the end, but at least you did what you could."
iRacing,3bfrus,Speedly,3,Mon Jun 29 04:58:15 2015 UTC,"One word answer, brakes."
iRacing,3bfrus,sim-racingcouk,5,Mon Jun 29 05:26:57 2015 UTC,Almost impossible to tell just from that gif and now further information. Did you slow down when you saw that the 3 car spinning?   (Short track) oval racing can be tough sometimes. People crash and you have nowhere to go. Just learn from every wreck and you'll develop a spider sense for this.
iRacing,3bfrus,Niellie41,2,Sun Jun 28 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, I did but I didn#t think he'd go into the wall."
iRacing,3bfrus,Acurus_Cow,4,Sun Jun 28 21:29:12 2015 UTC,"If anything you could have noticed that the 3 car was going to have a crash before he hit the wall and backed off even more than you did.  Looks like he had a pretty good slide there for a while before hitting the wall, and you hitting the breaks. Hard to see in the gif though."
iRacing,3bfrus,LordVoldee,2,Sun Jun 28 22:28:09 2015 UTC,"The best thing to do is brake, slow down and fast. I'm assuming this is a rookie race or at least a relatively low irating group. So, with that said, you cannot predict what people with no experience will do. Some will crash and jump straight back onto the raceline right away. Losing a couple seconds from braking is much better than potentially ending your race."
iRacing,3bfrus,nomnamless,2,Mon Jun 29 01:12:35 2015 UTC,"Looks like it would have been hard to avoid, about all you could have done was slowed down a little more to see what the 3 car would do.  After it made contact with the wall you could have gone high to avoid it."
iRacing,3bfrus,jakeremore,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:41:52 2015 UTC,"If you were in a D license or above race, I'd say no. If this is rookies, ESPECIALLY the USA track then you always wanna give the other rookies more space. I noticed you went two wide there going into the turn which is normally ok but I don't trust any rookie, specially there.   In your case you had that guy on your inside go forward and start the entire incident. That's on him, but if you let him by and stood behind him you could have dodged the wreck on the inside instead of being caught out on the outside with nowhere to go. That's nitpicking though."
iRacing,3bfrus,screampuff,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:32:03 2015 UTC,"That was bad luck, but it's hard to tell without seeing your in car view.  For one the big problem is that there are no cautions in this series, which is a huge fail on iRacing's behalf. It's supposed to be a simulator but I don't know of any oval racing series that doesn't have cautions.  You could have slowed down more, or taken a low line when you saw the cars in front spinning."
iRacing,3bfrus,CreepyVanMan_1,5,Mon Jun 29 00:42:02 2015 UTC,"It's a rookie series. If there were cautions, the race would take 80 hours, and have 5 green flag laps lol"
iRacing,3bfrus,Sarstan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"Not honestly a lot you could do. Yes, slowing down would have helped a lot, but in the heat of the moment it's not realistic to think you'll slow down to a safer speed (and watch yourself look several spots in the process). The general idea is when a car goes up, it's going to come back down in an oval race. You damn near got away with your line honestly, and diving down would have been a bad idea in most cases including here. Just chalk it up as bad luck. You did a great job holding your line under pressure."
iRacing,3bfrus,Eburon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:51:29 2015 UTC,"nope, not that much as the guy spins once you are passed the incident, I would have been back in the gas by then. But I have to say, turn off that ""ideal"" racing line. It's not ideal at all and will hold you back. Especially when you're racing close it's hard to see it and you will miss your marks and have no clue about what's happening on the track.  edit don't know where the downvotes are coming from but seriously turn off that ideal racing line. Anyone telling you otherwise shouldn't be giving out advice about simracing."
iRacing,3bitbe,Steven8992,9,Mon Jun 29 16:03:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly (and I'm not sure which car is you, OP) to me this seems like a racing incident.  It sucks, but it happens.  Totally avoidable, but fault on both sides."
iRacing,3bitbe,h3r4ld,5,Mon Jun 29 17:27:02 2015 UTC,"it doesn't really look intentional OP, looks like he just out braked himself, at least he straightened you back out haha!"
iRacing,3bitbe,lagatron,5,Mon Jun 29 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, for Christ's sakes. You got nudged and spun the car.  I'm starting to get exasperated with the number of videos on here complaining about a relatively minor crash. If he had dropped down and just absolutely driven it up through you into the wall, then I would have understood.  It's racing. Contact happens. It's Bristol. Contact happens. Just get on with your life and keep driving."
iRacing,3bitbe,Speedly,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:49:27 2015 UTC,"yea i love watching videos but this is pretty minor, even for Bristol this is about as vanilla as an infraction gets.  driver could probably catch back up honestly just have a little bit hotter tires for a few laps"

iRacing,3be3zi,Nevil-Clavain,3,Sun Jun 28 12:48:53 2015 UTC,"If I do not feel like racing or spectating I will search for drivers who need spotters and spot for them in a race.

I will call out laps remaining, lap times, cars left/right/clear/etc, distance in time to cars in front/back, watch for wrecks/incidents involving cars i front of my driver, etc.  some drivers also like to request info like lap times of car they are chasing or that is chasing them, pit strategy (spotter can also servce as a ""crew chief"" and set pitting options for the driver! pretty cool)  OT, does anyone use DashMeterPro app?  I only found out last week that it works for the car I am spotting!  I was not getting lap completed/remaining and some other info, but maybe because I turned it on mid-race out of curiosity to see if it would work with spotting."

iRacing,3be3zi,Urinat0r,2,Sun Jun 28 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"Communication and reliability, and also knowing the physics of the collisions. A good spotter will be able to tell you where you need to be on the track to avoid a wreck, while also still telling you where the other cars around you are."

iRacing,3bcma9,ZeeNewAccount,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:32:05 2015 UTC,Problem is that it's expensive. As a kid I got hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of a 5 dollar foot/soccerball. That doesn't mean one should pay 500 dollar for the thing. And that remains the problem for iracing.
iRacing,3bcma9,Eburon,2,Sun Jun 28 15:23:46 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, I think that's part of why people treat the racing with respect. You don't pay that much to treat it like any other racing sim."
iRacing,3bcma9,Eburon,2,Sun Jun 28 15:30:02 2015 UTC,Oh it has it's perks no doubt about that. Increasing the average age for example.
iRacing,3bcma9,arsenicfox,2,Sun Jun 28 15:32:36 2015 UTC,"Not really a problem tho. It's not exactly designed around kids, more around the people who spend $68,000 on a full motion simulator or $2,000 on a direct drive wheel.   Not really a problem when you are not it's assumed audience. It's for sim racing enthusiast, not gamers."
iRacing,3bcma9,arsenicfox,2,Sun Jun 28 17:06:10 2015 UTC,"That's like saying the problem with enthusiast RC cars is that they're too expensive compared to one you bought your kid at Walmart or saying you had hours of fun with a pool noodle as a kid vs the expense of a jet ski.   Yes, it's virtual. Yes it's a game. But it is a game designed as a simulation for people who are serious about racing who may not have the time, money, or maybe have other reasons they can't visit real life courses (such as weather).   That's just how it is. Otherwise, I'd say play rFactor 2. It's got better physics for the time being (as IRacing does have some upgrades in the pipeline so I'll reserve judgement until then) and it's cheaper.   But seriously, some people have spent over $6000 (computer, monitors, wheel, pedals, h-shifter, seq-shifter, etc) for a game I've maybe spent $1000 on in 6 years. And I've gotten hours of amazing racing out of it. Know how many I've gotten in assetto corsa? 12 minutes.  RFactor 2? 2 hours not including AI races.  Whereas I've done almost 300+ races in IRacing. Not for lack of trying in the other games either. I looked into leagues, asked friends to play, hell I even bought rFactor 2 for a few of my friends. It's just a pain in the ass to setup and sometimes takes a lot of time to do.  :) IRacing can be expensive. But they are a niche product and are still the only ones that offer what they do."

Go through the controller settings reading their description. There is one that is made for low turning angle wheels and it allows you to map the range of steering much higher when going slow. This will fix your issue.   But yeah, the wheel will make the real difference. It is mighty hard to race without one."

But then Tim Wheatley, previous NR2003 Indycar modder and now developer at ISI, handed out codes for iRacing trial services.   I thought ""well, if an nr2003 modder is into it""   And I was horrible at it for a long time. It was hard, it didn't have the grip I expected. I didn't understand.   But eventually I practiced and, honestly, 6 years later I love the service. It's grown so much since then and their support for users in the community is phenomenal. Just we've had a bit of a stretch with negative Nancies spamming the forums as of late, so some people are on edge.  Anyways, i hope your next race is better!"
iRacing,3bd8lc,arsenicfox,3,Sun Jun 28 03:57:07 2015 UTC,"IRacing isn't filled with these types of people. Just happens that 1/22 people in iRacing is like that. But that happens in any form of racing, even in real life. In either case, sorry that was your first experience. :) hopefully the next one will be better, but there are some ""eh"" days."
iRacing,3bd8lc,arsenicfox,2,Sun Jun 28 03:48:58 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, to be fair, 2 of the 4 races I had were quite clean and close racing."
iRacing,3bd8lc,TannerMcC,2,Sun Jun 28 12:02:55 2015 UTC,That's actually really good for rookies xD   Also mind that a lot of that has to do with what split you're in. Higher splits are usually cleaner and faster racers ;)
iRacing,3bd8lc,ZeeNewAccount,5,Sun Jun 28 14:13:49 2015 UTC,"Some Thoughts that came up reading this   Anyone with under a 1500 iRating most likely has an ego far bigger than their race talent. (There are of course exceptions) ""I'm gonna protest you"" = Just words. I've been on iRacing for 7 months, done 1000 races and been told about 20-50 times that they'll report me. Never have I gotten an email saying ""someone has filed a protest against you"". iRacing doesn't punish unless its something REALLY obvious and they're even more lienent in rookies. Finally, more than likely if someone is yelling at you they're just blowing off steam. It sucks spinning out, crashing or doing something wrong. It's easier to yell at someone else than to blame yourself. The drivers that become good are the ones who look at bad things happening around them and adjust how they drive to avoid them. You don't find those drivers at Rookie, D Class or C class levels.  Today i was in an endurance race with a damaged car and I was attempting to let the leaders by, i pulled nearly off the track and still the guy rear ended me. I messaged him and said ""what are you doing!?!?"".. he sent a message apologizing and said he didnt realize I was slowing to let him past. Then tonight in a GT1 race him and I raced within a second of eachother for almost 30 minutes and many hugs were had post race. Its just emotions of racing."
iRacing,3bd8lc,ZeeNewAccount,3,Sun Jun 28 04:14:22 2015 UTC,The drivers that become good are the ones who look at bad things happening around them and adjust how they drive to avoid them.    This is the bible right here.
iRacing,3bd8lc,ZeeNewAccount,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:46:00 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for explaining those things. I honestly had no idea there were even channels for protesting until he threatened me with it. I guess I just have to get out of the lower licences as quickly as possible!"
iRacing,3bd8lc,bozboy204,2,Sun Jun 28 12:02:26 2015 UTC,"Well, this is the good and the bad of iRacing. Could you imagine those emotions happening to you practicing in Project CARS? Of course not, because after iRacing, offline racing is as dead as dead.  iRacing is as real as it gets short of strapping into a real race car. You'll have to learn to control your own emotions/reactions all while predicting the actions of others and sometimes dealing with volatile people and situations. That is why it is fun. Who cares if you can beat a group of drones lumbering around in approximately the same way that they'd do if you weren't even there. You're racing real people and real people do weird, unpredictable shit sometimes."
iRacing,3bd8lc,rancer890,2,Sun Jun 28 10:56:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah true. I come from a decade of rFactor, so I have lots of experience racing online, but I guess the more real consequences elevate emotions in iRacing a bit more."
iRacing,3bd8lc,dilkington11,2,Sun Jun 28 12:00:54 2015 UTC,"My advise (and it is common advise): don't spend a minute more than you have to in a rookie series.   As soon as you move over to a D class series like Skippy or SFR, your experience will improve. The lowest of the low get stuck in R, so get away from them as fast as you can."
iRacing,3bbqqp,ProdigyInventor,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:24:40 2015 UTC,Hard to diagnose but just to raise some suggestions for you: * Download the latest version off the website.  * Use some thing like CCleaner to remove the old version off your pc. * Double check the setting in the pc app are the same as the settings inside the preferences settings on the phone app. * Try keeping the phone powered rather than just battery power (I connect mine to the pc via usb cable while in use). * Check any power saving features on your phone that may be going into a lower power mode after a few minutes of idle time.  That's about all I can suggest man. Good luck with it. Its a great app. I run it fine for hours in GT endurance races for the awesome fuel calculations. Hope you get it sorted.

(I presume this is how your connecting) I run DashMeterPro on my tablet via a secondary WiFi network in the room (The tablet is within 2 meters and works perfectly with no delay) but if for some reason it connects to the main WiFi router down the other end of the house (Quite weak connection) it works fine at first but gets horribly behind pretty quickly.

iRacing,3bahr5,RampageElephant,2,Sat Jun 27 09:42:12 2015 UTC,"Happening to mine too, coincidentally since the new season began. I figured it was a problem on iRacing's end with the updates."

iRacing,3bahr5,CFRAmustang,2,Sat Jun 27 18:19:06 2015 UTC,"Happening to me too. Just have to click option before I go race and it's all good. I have a Fanatec though, so my guess is that it's an iRacing issue"
iRacing,3bahr5,Memn0n,2,Sat Jun 27 21:41:12 2015 UTC,I have this problem after my computer hibernate. Oddly it's only the brake pedal that does it. All I have to do is press the pedal all the way down a time or two before going in the game. Probably some issue with the driver that they won't bother fixing.
iRacing,3bahr5,lukeatron,3,Sat Jun 27 11:16:19 2015 UTC,"Yup I have the same issue. Annoying as hell when I forget to do it and use my brakes while in a pack... Slight toe-in? Nah, lets push 'er in all the way!"

iRacing,3b8opj,Rascal2pt0,3,Fri Jun 26 21:37:45 2015 UTC,Skippy is a good car to learn from regardless of what road path you do. But don't forget the Mx5...especially when iRacing scan the 2016 version. :P
iRacing,3b8opj,rancer890,2,Sat Jun 27 03:38:48 2015 UTC,Skip Barber is an excellent series.  When you go up a license class it does indeed take 1.0 off. Otherwise you would be at 4.xx in the new license and could just do the MPR and be immediately promoted again.
iRacing,3b8opj,Sasken,2,Fri Jun 26 21:39:41 2015 UTC,The Skip is awesome.  Everyone should run at least one season in the skippy.
iRacing,3b8opj,trackday,2,Sat Jun 27 10:04:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Skippy is being promoted as the D class car, but the SFR is really a great option here. The community is excellent and the car itself will teach you a thing or two about throttle control."
iRacing,3b8opj,ZeeNewAccount,2,Sat Jun 27 10:09:35 2015 UTC,"The SFR is a tricky car to drive, at least for me it is.  I din't get a chance to race it at Watkens Glen because I just din't feel comfortable with the car.  Every time I'd hit the brakes the back end would want to come around on me.  feeling much more confident with the car this week at Suzuka, let's just hope I get a chance to do a race this weekend."
iRacing,3b8opj,nomnamless,2,Sat Jun 27 21:50:13 2015 UTC,"Right on. Suzuka East is an ideal track to get to know this car because there is minimal braking; it's all throttle control which is the key to unlocking the SRF's greatness.   Don't give up on this car! Once you learn it, the spins rarely happen and driving it to its limits becomes like walking. The benefit to it is that you will learn to be a much more precise racer than you will in other series. Your throttle skills will improve greatly and you will take this skill with you to the higher series.   Also, as mentioned... SRF has arguably the best community of all the series at iRacing :)"
iRacing,3b8opj,ZeeNewAccount,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:11:05 2015 UTC,"I ran the SFR for a few laps, the Skippy feels like a more natural progression to me.  Within a few minutes I was able to do faster laps than the MX on Okayama, so now I'm working on getting my times lower."
iRacing,3b8opj,ZeeNewAccount,3,Sat Jun 27 23:40:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, well the Skippy is a faster car than the MX5. It is faster than the Spec as well."
iRacing,3b8opj,justintolerable,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:16:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly the same boat here. Just got promoted (which feels awesome, doesn't it?) and started on Skip Barber. Loving it - I actually enjoyed the MX-5 loads, but this is fantastic."

iRacing,3b8opj,Grimatoria,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:28:02 2015 UTC,Set tire pressures at 152 for all four tires (22 psi I think).  For me it makes the car so much more drivable
iRacing,3b8opj,654456,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:07:19 2015 UTC,So how did you get promoted to D without getting to 4.0?  Do you not have to wait till season is over like in oval?
iRacing,3b8opj,v3ttel,2,Sat Jun 27 02:38:48 2015 UTC,You get promoted out of rookies immediately when you hit a SR of 3.0.
iRacing,3b8opj,LordVoldee,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:20:09 2015 UTC,"As 65446 Hit 3.0 and meet the req of 2 races or 4 TT's.  From what I understand it's their ""fast track"" you used to have to wait till the promotion period.  Had I played non stop I could probably have left rookies in a day but needed more time to get used to the car."
iRacing,3b7t74,29af,6,Fri Jun 26 17:43:25 2015 UTC,Don't use the driving line.
iRacing,3b7t74,Ass-Packer,2,Fri Jun 26 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"I'd say that the driving line option is good for new users to get a feel for the braking zones, but beyond that it's pretty useless."
iRacing,3b7t74,nomofica,3,Fri Jun 26 18:28:37 2015 UTC,"I have found that the line cuts the learning curve of road courses pretty much in half, but once I learned the course I could go much faster without it."
iRacing,3b7t74,DiscGolfer947,2,Fri Jun 26 18:53:37 2015 UTC,"After you get your bearings in the sim you should really just keep it off all the time, even on tracks you've never been to.  If you have trouble finding the correct lines it's a better idea to find a replay on the forums or compare your lap to someone else's in iSpeed."
iRacing,3b7t74,talkingbeans,2,Fri Jun 26 18:58:26 2015 UTC,"It does have a good use - when using it to learn a track, if you're ignoring it to learn the line, you can still use it as a track out guide. If you're exiting a corner and notice that you're crossing the driving line and heading up the track way faster than it is, you're probably heading for the wall. I like it for that, keep yourself from having to pick up a new car every couple of laps while you learn. Ignore it for learning the track, but use it to avoid wrecking."
iRacing,3b7t74,Ass-Packer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:36:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe more in road, but in oval you definitely want to learn to drive without it."
iRacing,3b7t74,LordVoldee,2,Fri Jun 26 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"I wish I knew how to control the car with the throttle. It took me much longer than it should have to learn how to not spin out on every turn. The key is throttle control. Learn to left foot brake and rev match. If you ever try road racing, learn to heal toe."
iRacing,3b7t74,shadowofashadow,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:52:34 2015 UTC,"I was reading some stuff adjusting for better depth perception, frame rate, force feedback feel, etc.    Try to set up so that your monitor is as close to your wheel as you can get it. The goal is to have your wheel line up exactly with the wheel on the screen.   Then you want to get your FOV setup so that your viewpoint is realistic for your seat position. Use the in game calculator or this one www.projectimmersion.com/fov/ to get your FOV.  It might feel a little close but it's going to make it feel the most realistic. Most people increase their FOV a bit to get some more peripheral vision and sense of speed, this is up to you, but using the recommended FOV will definitely help with your perception of the track and the car."
iRacing,3b7t74,shadowofashadow,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the website suggestion, but which game did you choose as iRacing isn't an option."
iRacing,3b7t74,arsenicfox,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:54:47 2015 UTC,Well iRacing has an FOV calculator built in so I'd suggest using that. You should be able to use the calculation for one of the other games that uses the same FOV type and put it in there.  I'm pretty sure iRacing uses a horizontal FOV so you should be able to use the number that site gives you for pCars.
iRacing,3b7m4j,retop56,4,Fri Jun 26 16:52:41 2015 UTC,"I ran about 10 or 11 of the blancpain endurance races last season solo and survived all but one or two. Don't be too proud to let guys go. There are plenty of people on the track who don't have a good survival mentality and you don't want to desperately hold those guys at bay because eventually they will smoke you and then say ""sorry, didn't think you'd brake so early"".  If it's early days in an enduro I'll happily hold back a little to have a safe space in front of me and I'll let racey guys go. I usually get those spots back over the course of the race by being consistent and not screwing up my pit stops."

iRacing,3b7m4j,cuntalist,2,Fri Jun 26 17:01:49 2015 UTC,"Consistency is the key, obviously. Also make sure you do enough testing ahead of time to know your fuel strategy, that way you don't have to worry about it during the race. What car are you running?"

iRacing,3b7m4j,racefan78,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:40:59 2015 UTC,Sounds about right. Good luck out there. Just try to survive the first stage of the race. Once the cars spread out more you can improve your pace.

iRacing,3b7m4j,jrebs,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:48:20 2015 UTC,Yeah. Although I've been pondering the idea of double stinting the tires at the end since one stint is shorter.
iRacing,3b7m4j,TannerMcC,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:55:09 2015 UTC,"That does sound pretty crazy but refering to my teammate's sprint race this week, I believe we calculated he was using about 3.4L/lap which would mean 29 laps which I put at about 61-62 minutes at a tidy pace. So, a 2-stop in the Ruf should be quite possible, and I'd suspect any car can probably make it as long as they run the tank right down and get a full fill. The time spent slowly moving down pit lane and stationary (tyres and fuel are separate in GT3) which make this estimate even more comfy."
iRacing,3b7m4j,talkingbeans,2,Fri Jun 26 23:28:28 2015 UTC,Remember your irating is not effected by the race but your safety rating is. So take your time.
iRacing,3b7m4j,TannerMcC,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:24:09 2015 UTC,"Does this go for all Blancpain Endurance races, or is this because he's a solo effort and will be treated differently / possibly DQ'd?  Second part of question - CAN you run it solo or will you just be disqualified at the end?"
iRacing,3b7m4j,emersonlakeandlagoon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:29:51 2015 UTC,"This goes for any multi-driver races. The iRating code isn't designed to work with multi-driver races. I've read somewhere that they're working on it but for now these races are exclusively for safety rating and championship points.  You won't get disqualified at the end, I believe the rules that required multiple drivers is only for the road warrior series. Someone else can confirm or correct the second part of this statement."

It screwed up weather (in a given race, different drivers can have different weather) and it caused iRacing to crash for a lot of people.  I recommend not racing until they fix it (which hopefully will be soon). If you do choose to race, realize that there's a good chance that you will not be able to start and will lose iRating.  They really screwed up this time."
iRacing,3b7xq8,Sasken,3,Fri Jun 26 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"Before taking any of the other advice in here, go to the main iRacing home page.

iRacing,3b4rbz,robun,7,Thu Jun 25 23:35:43 2015 UTC,"Next time definitely get a replay. Retaliation against another person is a direct violation of iRacings terms of service, even if the original person ""intentionally crashed"" to begin with.  If he indeed reported you, it might actually be beneficial as once you explain your end, he may actually get himself in trouble. I would not be worried though, the iRacing team is very good about getting both sides of the situation before issuing any punishments. Part of what makes this game and its community so great."
iRacing,3b4rbz,RogueRAZR,4,Fri Jun 26 00:35:51 2015 UTC,What an absolute asshole that guy is.. Man I feel for u dude I've had one of those races.. It sucked... I got tag teamed by two guys that we're trying to destroy me and I still managed to get 2nd but G damn. Nothing gained at all
iRacing,3b4rbz,ProdigyInventor,3,Fri Jun 26 01:32:44 2015 UTC,"So, to get this straight, you had to brake-check because another driver brake-checks and someone rear-ended you. Then, in a fit of rage, he intentionally wrecks you.  Yeah, I'll echo everyone's replies and file a protest. A helpful habit is to enable the sim to ask you to save the replay of the entire session. One, in case you want to go back and take screenshots. Two--and very helpful--when situations like this arise. This way, you can go back, go into a specific time period/lap and splice a quick, 30-second replay. It also helps to save a replay of the incident that triggered the retaliatory wreck, this way, the iRacing staffers get a better understanding of what's going on. That's what I've been doing when something of this nature arises."
iRacing,3b4rbz,tommy44vercetti,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:28:45 2015 UTC,"To be clear, and fair, I was in the right hand (outside) lane, and I am not certain he is who rear ended me. I believe he was on the left lane, and when I had to dive to a stop, got hit, and couldn't accelerate back up to pace with the car in front of me due to the damage I think he went past me. Sadly, I don't have the replay or I'd double check. Given the incident points I accrued versus the driver that did the retaliatory wreck, that appears to be what happened.  To make that clear, again: Based on the 9x I got, and the 4x the driver who did the retaliatory take-out got, I believe it was another driver that rear-ended me at the beginning of the race, meaning the guy who took me out was never contacted by me until the 4x that he took when he shoved me off the track. Again, that is the best of my memory, and I will be enabling automatic saving for replays in the future. I'm not trying to say I'm blameless (I could've been following further behind the car in front of me to avoid having to brake-check, etc.) I'm just trying to wrap my head around the mindset of taking another driver out, especially given that I was already several laps back."

iRacing,3b4rbz,y2kse,2,Fri Jun 26 11:17:02 2015 UTC,"You might try sending some PM's to other drivers that were in the session to see if you can get a copy of the replay.  You could also still try filing a protest, referencing the comments on the voice chat.  I don't know how far that will get you without the replay, though.  The other thing I would say is to go into the sim options and check the box that prompts to save replay on exiting a session."
iRacing,3b4rbz,y2kse,5,Fri Jun 26 01:22:40 2015 UTC,"The other thing I would say is to go into the sim options and check the box that prompts to save replay on exiting a session.   I'm definitely doing this. Easier to delete replays once a week or so than to have exited flustered and be totally lacking a replay.  Having read over the guide for filing a protest correctly, I doubt that I could get anywhere by protesting him without the replay though. It is good to know though, that I'm not totally crazy in being stunned at that reaction. I've literally never had anything like that happen in iRacing before."
iRacing,3b4rbz,bouncebackability,2,Fri Jun 26 01:26:00 2015 UTC,"You can protest for foul language spoken over voice chat without a replay.  iRacing keeps voice chat logs for a short amount of time.  It might not be successful, but at least puts a protest on the driver's account.  The other big reason to keep the replays is as a defense in case you get protested."

iRacing,3b0bxo,scubar,2,Wed Jun 24 23:09:39 2015 UTC,"Having a proper racing seating setup is pretty big for a sim racing career because comfort is a really important part of focused, consistent driving. You want to be comfortable and you want your inputs in the right positions and you need them to stay in those positions. Whether you buy a product or build something is up to you. There are many great home-brew cockpits out there and the sky is the limit, but there's also still a cost involved and the time and energy spent on such a project is not trivial. If you love building projects and have the facilities, then a home-made solution is probably a very good route. If you live in an apartment without a workshop or major power tools, an Obutto might be a better choice.  The Spec Racer, like the Skip Barber, is a car with a pretty unique driving characteristic. It wants to oversteer off throttle and understeer on throttle. So, you'll want to get your braking done early and then be throttling out of the corners much earlier than with a typical car - often before the natural apex of the corner. It's all about momentum, and you'll find with more and more practice you'll carry more speed through the apex and lap times will drop.  The best thing to do when it comes to track time is to get on the open practice servers and spend time around other cars. Follow some stronger drivers in the replay mode and see their lines and their braking points. Follow them on track when you're comfortable and fast enough. If there's a guy in your open practice server who's very fast, don't be too shy to ask him to watch a few of your laps and give you some tips. On the road racing side of things, people tend to be very happy to help newer drivers develop. Improving your consistency is better for both of you, since he's liable to be lapping you in a race in the near future. :)"

It will help your depth perception immensely and help you get faster much quicker. If you are running one monitor about 2 ft from your face, you're probably going to be running the lowest FOV possible which I think is 42 or 45 degrees. The idea is to have the monitor seemingly be a window in the the car to represent the actual size of said car and the virtual world you're driving in. It helps tremendously in gauging how far things are from you and how fast to take corners.  There are a lot of other tips folks will give you, but that's a huge one. Definitely recommend waiting on adding monitors and thinking about getting a consumer Oculus Rift (or currently Developer Kit 2). I use the DK2 and it's worlds above using trips in my opinion.   One last pointer - a set of pedals with a Load Cell brake is going to be the upgrade that makes the most difference in lap times overall. As a beginning you probably don't need a new brake set, but it's something to consider if you're really struggling to get up to pace.   I have these and they rule. You don't need to clubsports which are much more expensive!  Good luck!"

iRacing,3b0bxo,Acurus_Cow,2,Thu Jun 25 12:48:50 2015 UTC,"I can try and give some pointers based on my experience getting out of rookie with the same mentality recently.  Sounds like you already have a good idea of the line and break points for hot lapping. So I'd say you are more than ready to jump into a rookie race.  The only thing that matters in rookie races, is avoiding other people crashing, while staying on track your self the whole race.  If you do that, you will get a good finish, and move on up. You have to be extremely aware of the other drivers, they will break early, they will break late. They will dive in on your inside from nowhere. They will go on your outside and spin. They will ram into you from behind, etc etc. Don't trust anyone!  But as long as you are super aware and carefull, you should do fine. Don't worry about going fast, just don't crash, and do your best not to get caught up in other people's crashes. You will most likely not be able to avoid everything. I know I didn't. But that's not necessary.  I started out in the Mx5 though, I suspect the spec racer races to have much more mayhem than I experienced.. :)"
iRacing,3b0bxo,shartie,2,Thu Jun 25 14:14:02 2015 UTC,"Just like real life all you need is practice and patience. I don't believe a huge racing setup is needed to go fast IMO. I have a full racing rig and also GT wheel attached to a desk with a cheap office chair and I can run the same lap times in both, I do prefer the rig on long races and desk for short. But again that is just my opinion.   What you need to do is adjust the drivers head rotation percent in the app.ini file, this will allow the drivers head to turn when the car slides and gives you a sense of a real life drift/slide. Most people don't know about this and some hate it but I love it, it has gotten me out of some close calls when I'm in a corner to hard and the view will start to shift away from center which let's me know I'm about to loose control and gives me a second to lift off and correct.

iRacing,3azydj,v3ttel,8,Wed Jun 24 21:23:40 2015 UTC,"You are definitely going to get your fastest laps in the first 1-5 laps if you're running low fuel. It's definitely car to car. Which car are you using?  That being said, in the RUF, I can start with a full tank and fresh tires and run my fastest laps of the stint about three-quarters of the way through (on lap 30 of a 40 lap stint) with a good combination of low fuel and decent tire wear. 5 laps later though the tires really start to fall off.   I also agree with jrebs that you could be getting some heat wear. During endurance races (Again Gt3 cars) I tend to go ""fast"" or ""push"" one lap and off another to cool the tires a bit. This just also helps from a philosophical perspective since I actually tend to drive a bit faster when I allow myself to relax...  Great question though!"
iRacing,3azydj,iFap4DaytonaCoupes,7,Wed Jun 24 21:46:34 2015 UTC,"Most likely you are suffering from heat degradation, rather than tyre wear. Sliding around a lot heats the tyres up more and results in reduced grip over time. The more noise they are making, the more you're hurting them, generally. Some amount of noise is expected, but in general I find most cars can be managed quite well over a run (on road side) with smooth driving."
iRacing,3azydj,jrebs,5,Wed Jun 24 21:33:51 2015 UTC,You shouldn't worry about tyre degradation in the MX-5. I am assuming this is the car as that is about average lap times for Okayama and Lime Rock. The MX-5 has short races so just push hard all the way through the race.
iRacing,3azydj,DarkElf12,4,Thu Jun 25 00:55:12 2015 UTC,"Not sure why this has been down voted. I did a lot of time in the MX-5 when I first got into the service, and I was able to set fastest times on the last lap.  It's a sprint race, you don't have enough time to do huge amounts of damage to the tyre. Sure, it might drop off a little if you're really pushing, but for the average new comer, don't worry too much about tyres."
iRacing,3azydj,sdizzle23,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"I think the main issue is that I am seeing drop off (even after 5 or 6 laps). Interesting though, it seems to be much more noticeable with the MX-5 Cup than with the other cars I've tried (like the Spec). Maybe it's my driving style is particularly hard on the tires in the MX-5. I'd love to find the exact cause though, because I would like to get it sorted before I try to move into the higher license races."
iRacing,3azydj,sdizzle23,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"It may be your lack of consistency. Being able to put in laps all within .1's of one another is tough, and it requires a lot of practice. 6 laps of Okayama is tough, as the track is basically two tracks in one. The first section has long sweeping bends, and from corner 5 onwards it's basically a short twisty track.  I would highly doubt you are pushing hard enough to make any noticeable difference to your times with regards to your tyres.  Basically, practice, practice, practice, and then practice some more. As a new comer, if in doubt, everything is your fault ;)  Hope that helps."
iRacing,3azydj,IIIIIbarcodeIIIII,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:28:32 2015 UTC,"It might very well but that, but I think I'm consistently hitting my track markers (at least not enough to vary my times by 2-3 seconds anyway). I completed my first ever race (finished second with no incidents - Woo), and i noticed the guy in first had a similar pattern of drop off to me as the race progressed. It may also have been because he was a couple of seconds down the road and managing his pace. I'm adopting the fact that if something is wrong, it's probably my fault.... but I'd like to make sure I'm not beating myself up for no reason :)"
iRacing,3azydj,RampageElephant,2,Thu Jun 25 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what you're describing is over-heated tyres, probably from over-braking and sledging the front wheels/sliding the rear.  As long as you don't over-drive, your tyres should easily do consistent times for 23-24 laps at Okayama Short (for instance) before dropping off.  In some races (especially short ovals) conservation of tyres is incredibly important in order to attack in the last quarter of the race.  As always, focus on smoothness. Smooth is fast, fast is loose."
iRacing,3azydj,dewmsolo,2,Thu Jun 25 02:34:34 2015 UTC,"I believe it has less to do with the tires and more to do with mentality. When you first race a track (ever or for a particular session) there is no set best lap time, so you have nothing to compare against. You will intuitively start with maybe a 1:03, then progressively improve. You can't continue to make fastest laps over and over and its more of a mental obstacle. Maybe on your 4th or 5th lap you will begin to think, i can't just keep making faster and faster laps that is impossible, then nerves kick in and over analyzation of the track begins. When you do your 5th fastest lap in the following (6th) you will be like ""where did i brake (on any given corner) that got me such a great time? i don't quiet remember (Because you were racing off instincts). At this point i will usually have a 15 minute brake to clear my head, then when i come back to the game i think. Ok, im just going to try and get close to my best lap and then do laps consistently at this time (whatever time is your best). Once you manage that then and only then can you improve and the best lap you made in the first few you did when you originally started.  This may not be the reason why you're  struggling but diffinetly a factor for me when i find i've made a best lap i cannot beat or get close to. Hope this helped"

Here is the official explanation from iRacing of why this is not possible: ""The contents of the .sto files aren't what you at all expect them to be. What's in there has to be stuck onto a car running within the physics engine, and many of the values you see in the garage are actually measured off of the car. It's not like there is anything near a 1:1 mapping of the setup values and what is contained within the .sto file. As such there is no way to view a setup contained in a .sto without exporting it from a running physics engine (which is what the garage screen does).""  shameless plug: http://iracingsetupviewer.com/"

Nice to meet you!  I'm fairly new to iRacing and have been thinking about learning setups.  (I have no idea what I'm doing with them so far)    I have a background in binary analysis and RE.  Quick inspection of the file format doesn't show much..   I only have SRF sto files at the moment.. they all start with (02000000 A0020000 02000000) Which is probably a magic number.. the A002 part looks like little endian 02A0 which is close to the length of file.  It Might be a length tag, but hard to say without looking at other sto files.  It appears to be followed by compressed data...   It most likely wouldn't be that difficult to hook the file open and trace through to see what it's doing to decode the file.  Its most likely just compressed.. once the decompression is figured out its probably trivial to figure out the format from there.. I'll try to look into it at some point, but honestly between work and learning how to be a faster racer, I don't think I'll have that much time for it! :D"

I think it would add so much to the strategy of endurance racing to be able to look at the data and decide we can push an extra lap or two this stint, or yeah I think we can double stint the tires, etc, and be able to have these conversations with the driver and the rest of the team (again, like in real life).  As it is now, I (as an engineer) can't tell how worn my driver's tires will be (and thus when exactly they need to pit) until they're already in the pits, which doesn't really do me any good."

Currently in endurance racing you just take tires every time because it takes way less time than a full refuel.   About the live telemetry thing- as it was explained to me a while ago they are worried about people making programs that sense micro changes in temps over super short periods of time and adjust the steering/throttle/brake to suit for better driving.

There could be an argument that he hung back to pre-empt the start, but that's not evident in a replay. We can't tell at exactly what point the green was shown (given the length of the field it seems like he launched at a legitimate point in time). Everyone else was sleeping or hesitating and either way he didn't really break any rule. Similarly, no rule would be broken if one of those cars chose a more inside line to stop him from doing that.  Edit: Just to clarify, I think it's stupid to do this kind of thing at the start and I'm the first person to hang back and try to survive the early laps, but I still recognize that it's generally within the rules to do this as long as you don't launch earlier than you're allowed and don't run into a car that's in front of you.

iRacing,3ava7o,_Moose3,2,Wed Jun 24 16:58:49 2015 UTC,"Well, when I was originally making that build, I did have an i5 4460 selected (currently the cheapest modern i5) however I swapped it for the i3 4360 - one of the fastest i3s, if not the fastest - for cost reasons. That said, the savings is only $30.  Regarding whether you need the upgrade, well I don't know anything about the requirements for a quad core. The i3 has hyperthreading, which to cut a long story short basically means that it has two physical cores (with two physical threads) and two ""virtual threads"". Don't know how it works, but Windows sees it as a quad core AFAIK. But obviously that's not going to be as good as a true quad core, so going with an i5 is probably going to give you more longevity. I run an i5 4570, which is only marginally faster than the 4460, and have had no issues with it in any game so there's that. It's your money, your decision. If paying that extra $30 is not a big deal, then go for an i5.   P.S. For some reason the RAM I had selected in the above build is no longer in stock, so just swap it for any 2x4GB kit such as this one."

iRacing,3atw4s,bouncebackability,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:55:01 2015 UTC,"Well, at least it isn't last on the ranking. Being in the middle is kinda disappointing in my opinion."
iRacing,3atw4s,Qel_Hoth,0,Tue Jun 23 15:30:56 2015 UTC,"It's a great track to drive, but it's one of the more difficult and it's very narrow. Racing can be hit or miss there depending on who is with you."
iRacing,3atw4s,Didarab0cchi,2,Tue Jun 23 18:04:13 2015 UTC,"To be honest with you, Brands Hatch isn't too narrow, you can easily go 3 wide, and even 4 wide if you are crazy enough."
iRacing,3atw4s,Didarab0cchi,2,Wed Jun 24 10:23:57 2015 UTC,Brands Hatch was used in the Srf 2 months ago and it will be used in IMSA this season. That said it's an unpopular track due to the off track limits that force you to shortcut to be competitive.
iRacing,3atw4s,TannerMcC,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:04:33 2015 UTC,Are the off track limits broken?
iRacing,3atw4s,nashbar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"They are set to the old Brands Hatch rules where everyone used lots of run off and the track boundaries aren't very clear. Because of that you pretty much have to risk off tracks everywhere. On the real track they fixed these issues last year and don't allow anyone to cut the track so much anymore, Iracing hasn't updated this yet."
iRacing,3atw4s,seaweeduk,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:46:35 2015 UTC,As someone learning the track you basically have to try random lines and cutting the course in random places to see what you can get away with. its annoying.
iRacing,3au352,sweber011,4,Tue Jun 23 14:52:39 2015 UTC,"GT1 is the place to be this season. Huge participation, you will get races all the time and lots of shared sets on the forum. The C-Spec is a really awesome car but Ruf Cup is not worth it this season with the fixed set."
iRacing,3au352,Didarab0cchi,3,Tue Jun 23 15:38:23 2015 UTC,Some people like (and indeed love) fixed sets.  You can jump RIGHT in the racing and it sure makes the argument of set come out of the equation and you can only blame yourself for being shit at driving.  That being said. There are so many GT1 sets shared you're basically running fixed with 7 different sets. Just find one that works for you (and learn to tune to your driving style helps :D)
iRacing,3au352,nonothing,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:54:43 2015 UTC,"That's the difference though, you can take a set and make small adjustments for yourself. Skippy, Slowstice and some others are fixed by default anyway so there is no need to make other cars fixed."
iRacing,3au352,Didarab0cchi,2,Tue Jun 23 21:40:01 2015 UTC,They made Skippy fixed! It had 6 adjustments. It's a great way to learn to set a car up.  Literally all I use is the back page of Mark Ursel's Star Mazda setup guide on every car. Let it take a season or two to come. You have to let yourself feel what the car is doing instead of drive it. I don make a lot of changes. And I couldn't tell you what reduces cornet entry understeer off the top of my head. But with 30 minutes in practice I can be 'done' changing a set.
iRacing,3au352,nonothing,3,Tue Jun 23 21:52:29 2015 UTC,The Skippy is still open.

There's a 30+ page thread on the C-Spec forums arguing this, but just because you're on the same setup doesn't mean you're on equal footing.  If the setup doesn't match my driving style, but it matches yours, you'll instantly be at an advantage.  It's why you can try an alien set and be slower than a ""normal"" set. This isn't oval racing where a setup is the be-all end-all."
iRacing,3au352,4InchesOfury,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  It certainly give people the ILLUSION of the equal footing.  Too many people blame things external to their failures, especially in iRacing. Ive seen too many 'he wrecked me' and 'this set isnt good enough' when the one thing that you can fix is yourself."
iRacing,3au352,nonothing,2,Wed Jun 24 18:21:31 2015 UTC,Depends on what you're looking for and willing to put into it. The RUF Cup is now fixed so you don't need to build setups or understand how to set up the car and tweak forum setups. The GT1 series is open (for now) and will require you to either build the setups on your own or pull one off of the forums. There's already a bunch of guys sharing setups in GT1.

iRacing,3au352,b0xii,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:04:08 2015 UTC,i like the ruf cup this season because im not too good at fine tuning a setup and I feel like a good setup is worth seconds a lap.
iRacing,3au352,JAMES_SHUNT,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:03:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I ran my seasons with one set for every track, no adjustments at all. Once you feel comfortable, you shall keep it :)"
iRacing,3au352,apfeltalk7,2,Tue Jun 23 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"I run every car at baseline.  I dont know Shit about setting up cars and it seems like a lot of work.  I just want to drive.  I have never felt anyone had that much of an advantage over me in setup.  For a newer racer like me, the time I would be spending setting up the car is way better spent running practice laps.  Maybe I am wrong, but I feel like setups seperate the top 1% of drivers, everyone else is seperated by driving skill."
iRacing,3au352,taidana,3,Wed Jun 24 00:37:21 2015 UTC,That's right! Well I only adjust brake bias to my liking. That's all :D

iRacing,3au352,thisguysmokey,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:02:31 2015 UTC,"Changing the setup in the Caddy can help you improve your time. In the C-Spec the setup doesn't affect speed in any way. First week of the season was in Montreal, the same track we had in the Road Warrior (open setup) the week before. The fastest racelap in the fixed car was 1 tenth faster than the fastest lap in the open car. In qualifying the open lap was 3 tenths ahead because you could take fuel out. The setup in the C-Spec is purely about feeling but there are many fixed guys who don't know the car and just assume they are slower because of the setup."
iRacing,3au352,Didarab0cchi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:45:50 2015 UTC,"Setups are very important... can indeed cut lap times by seconds, though not as important as driving skill."
iRacing,3au352,b0xii,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"Unless you have something majorly wrong, like max wing at Monza, setups don't make that much of a difference on the road side. I'm running the Ford GT GT3 this season and have only made minor setup adjustments to make the car more comfortable to drive. I was about the same time off pace at Zandvoort as I am in every other road car I've driven."

iRacing,3atjmo,laurik1299,10,Tue Jun 23 11:50:22 2015 UTC,"You got to be careful when watching videos on Youtube. Tire models and baseline setup changed since then. I think some of the best lap visible on YT are not possible anymore due to too many changes since then. If you want a good reference, check the forums for recent replays, go in open practice and spectate the driver with the best time or just spectate race. As for spinning out, do you spin on corner entry or exit?"
iRacing,3atjmo,Memn0n,9,Tue Jun 23 12:18:06 2015 UTC,Slow down.  Don't change gear in the turns. Get lots of practice before you go out and gamble your irating away.  Okayama is an issue but the fast right into a slow left at Summit Point was no problem?  That's interesting.
iRacing,3atjmo,emersonlakeandlagoon,4,Tue Jun 23 12:18:18 2015 UTC,"PRACTICE.  That's it.  If you can't run a full race distance in a practice session without going off track once, to be perfectly honest you've no business being in a race session.  At that point (as you've seen), you're a danger to yourself and others.  Remember that everyone you're racing against is a real person.   They have an irating and Safety Rating that they're trying to protect, too; when you cause a crash in a race, you affect them just as much as you affect yourself.  Maybe they have to get to work and that was the only race they could do that day.  How would you feel if you were in that situation and someone crashed you out in the first corner because they didn't know what they were doing?  Do yourself a favor, do us all a favor, and practice safe driving before you start racing.  You'll thank me and more importantly thank yourself in the end.  EDIT:  Also, with a new build just being released, the videos you find on YouTube may not be accurate or possible anymore.  It's the second week, everyone's still getting a feel for it, too."

iRacing,3atjmo,arsenicfox,9,Tue Jun 23 12:48:31 2015 UTC,"No Offense* does not signify it will not offend a person. That said, the person above is absolutely correct.   Your end goal should be to be consistent. You have to be consistent to be fast. I've won against several people who were much faster than me simply because they would always make a huge mistake.  But hey, you asked for tips as a beginner. Not our fault if you don't agree with them. shrug  And as someone who, recently, has had less time to race, he's correct in also being considerate to other racers. They spend money just like you to get enjoyment out of sim racing, often because they don't have the time or money to go and do it for real (like me.) This is a surrogate for that desire. Not perfect, but it does the job and does it pretty well.   We are all humans. And a lot of people don't treat each other like ""just on the internet"". It's a culture. You can adapt to it or find somewhere else to race. In either case, like any group, just be respectful. You can learn a lot of good info just from being nice. :)"
iRacing,3atjmo,h3r4ld,4,Tue Jun 23 13:22:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you; really, I couldn't have said it better myself.  Honestly, /u/laurik1299, I really do hope you listen to the advice you're being given and become a better racer.  Not so that we can all feel better knowing you won't wreck us out, but because I guarantee that you'll get so much more enjoyment out of iRacing.  Do it for your own sake.    The community is amazing, as well as an amazing tool to have at your disposal.  It's actually one of the few advantages of simracing over real racing: you've got thousands of people who are more than willing to watch your replays, offer you advice, help tweak your setup.  They'll practice driving side-by-side with you, practice overtaking and defending with you, even go half-speed to lead you around a track you're trying to learn.  They'll do this, and pretty much anything else you could possibly need, if you ask nicely and genuinely want their help.    Ask any driver - any real driver - and they'll tell you that great racing comes from all the drivers respecting one another, both on track and off.   Respect your car, respect the other drivers, respect the process of going faster, and the fact that it will take a long time, and watch how much better everything gets.  This isn't just a hobby, it's a way of life.  Welcome to the family :)"
iRacing,3atjmo,h3r4ld,6,Tue Jun 23 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"My point being you should be able to race without spinning.  I race once a day some days, all day on others.  That has nothing to do with it.  You asked for some tips as a beginner; I gave you one.  Apparently, you don't want my advice, despite the fact that you yourself said   I've just started playing iRacing ( yesterday )   EDIT: By the way, you're telling me you ""never have an accident by yourself,"" but according to your post:   I spin out nearly every lap"
iRacing,3atjmo,aliencougar,3,Tue Jun 23 13:22:58 2015 UTC,I have noticed this attitude from the new players requesting advice.  We dole out golden eggs from toilet time only to be spit on in response.  Who asks questions and then gets rude with the people helping them?  Keep spinning out on one of the easiest tracks in the game.......I DONT CARE.  Mellinials suck.
iRacing,3atjmo,h3r4ld,4,Tue Jun 23 14:08:42 2015 UTC,"It goes further than iracing; in general, if you ask someone for advice don't get pissy with them if you don't like the advice they give.    I think a lot of new racers tend to get upset when they ask for advice and everyone says ""Practice more"".  They think its general, they think its been said before, they think its cliched, and it is all of those things.  However, its oft-repeated for a reason. There are no shortcuts in racing, as there are no shortcuts in life.  The only way to get better is to practice.  If you're not willing to put in the time, you will never improve, and to be perfectly honest worsen the experience for the rest of us.  There are plenty of other sims that don't require the level of commitment of iracing; use them.  EDIT: That being said, getting angry right back at them isn't the answer, either.  You were that bad at racing once, too, as was I."

All the advice in this thread is pretty solid, if you don't agree with it you certainly don't have to implement it, but when you ask for advice as a new driver in iRacing don't argue that they are wrong.  If they are giving bad advice another racer will certainly call them on it or correct it.    Everyone thinks they are Arton Senna/Dale Ernhardt/Michael Schumaker when they first start and then realize they aren't as fast as GT or Forza made them think they are.  Don't worry about catching the guy in front of you, be smooth, and study the drivers that consistently win with low or no incidents in the race and you will see more wins and podium finishes as you move along."

I followed your advice, and I managed to finish on 3rd with 2 incidents. What I've discovered is that I was driving too aggresive, which was making me lose control so easy and, eventually crash. I've also discovered that ~80% of rookie players are making the same mistake I was doing, going aggresive and spinning out, that's how I managed to go slow at first, on 12, and finish on 3, just with safe racing.

In the sporting code, it explains it further at 2.7.2: ""...Note that incidents are counted throughout each session, including during the cool-down period after the checkered flag has been shown.   Your Safety Rating is what matter to get out of rookies.  The win is nice and fun, but if you rack up those incident points after the race, the only wins you'll be celebrating will be in Rookies."

iRacing,3ar7u7,LKincheloe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:49:17 2015 UTC,This. I think if they were to limit it to only offline practice sessions there wouldn't be much of an issue. Emphasize that you must compete online to continue to advance. Just a couple of cars running laps is all that is needed. It would be great to practice passing and such without pissing real people off.

You throw a kart in with a slight bit of error and there's no grunt to cover your mistake, you lose momentum and you get passed.  It's a different type of challenge IMHO.  There are high powered high torque cars that take careful throttle control, and there are karts which take careful braking (only rear brakes), a slight bit of oversteer while turning, and are more a discipline in maintaining momentum without mistakes.  Not to mention they're really snappy, you have to have incredibly fast reaction times to catch them whereas a car with a real suspension will have a fudge factor."
iRacing,3ar7u7,JordanCothran,3,Mon Jun 22 22:41:13 2015 UTC,"And also its very competitive bumper to bumper racing, it is a great tool to beginners to iracing. But maybe im a little bias to karts since i race them irl and i think it would be amazing to see something you drive in the game"
iRacing,3ar7u7,OtisThePirate,2,Mon Jun 22 23:56:21 2015 UTC,Don't karts require a lot of body use and body control though?
iRacing,3ar7u7,LAborn_TXraised,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:49:19 2015 UTC,"thats the part that I'm not sure about, how to simulate something that takes a lot more than your arms and feet."
iRacing,3ar7u7,kaluh_glarski,2,Tue Jun 23 18:48:19 2015 UTC,Yeah until they can sim all that it won't work in something aiming to be extremely realistic like iRacing. That's why I feel dirt oval and rallycross are the best options. It causes a dirt model to be created as well so we can have proper off track as well.
iRacing,3ar7u7,LAborn_TXraised,3,Tue Jun 23 19:01:31 2015 UTC,"I said yes to AI purely down to the fact I have no time anymore to practice and race online, and would still like to make use of owned and future content.  EDIT: Just to add to this, I feel for us older users who are low on time, AI would also help iracing maintain funds from us who enjoy the sim and content.  Hell maybe even have a AI only tier for subs to attract some old users back?"
iRacing,3ar7u7,tartan_special,2,Tue Jun 23 11:53:13 2015 UTC,"I like the qualifying before the race that is now being implemented, even though i'm pretty bad at qualifying. when they first bought it into the star mazda, they didn't get rid of the warmup so that was frustrating. But they removed the warmup for the skip barber now. which is good.  Other stuff I mentioned, is that races that are under an hour long, should happen every hour.  I reguarly race against the ai in so many other games, but ai is not a reason i'm registered for iracing. I think it will have a big negative impact on the product if they were to implement it."

But might aswell get the ball rolling?  Daniel Snørteland  I would prefer the McLaren,  But I have all of the cars except for the HPD.  I would be available throughout all the 6 hours.  Id also just like to take half a minute to inspire people who click on this post but are hesitant to commit; it is so much fun. Organized endurance racing puts simracing into an entirely new perspective for me, and you really get to feel like youre part of a team. Ive participated in all the official endurance events so far this year (24 and 12 hours), and its been a fantastic experience. Plus you get to work together with, and get to know other people from all over the world. That last part is especially important for me. Ive met a lot of cool and likeminded guys through this initiative by Mr. Bouncebackability. In the end, the result is secondary. Its all about working together, having fun, and doing the best you can!"

Provided I do not go on holiday - fairly unlikely - I will be available for the race.  Peter Battams  Mclaren  All others - Ruf second choice.  Available for the whole 6 hours.  As u/Inzomnia365 - one of my team mates from the Sebring 12h - has already said, an event like this really takes sim racing to a whole new level and meaning. It's really not about the final result but the fact that you finish. I was lucky to be in a team with two extremely friendly guys and we managed to get the car to the end in not too bad shape after a few unlucky incidents. I myself was probably the least experienced on the team, yet I surprised myself by completing two 2h long stints without major incident which is what it's all about!   Just for the record I'm still yet to turn a lap on the Glen, but will be hammering it for the next few weeks until I can do consistent and more importantly safe laps, just like I did for Sebring.   Bouncebackability makes this all possible and it's great that he's doing it again for us, thank you so much!"

iRacing,3aqlob,arsenicfox,2,Mon Jun 22 20:19:20 2015 UTC,"The way they're doing it is along the lines of rFactor 2's ""Real Road"". They're not just adding ""multi-groove racing"". They're adding dynamic track temps based on lighting/shadows and driving line. The tracks will also build rubber based on the driving lines of you and other drivers in real time, and can be affected by weather/etc.   Source: Many Many developer forum posts that I can't look up while at work.   If rFactor 2 is any indicator, this will be awesome. :)"

Now I am able to compete at the front in the top split and I can still see tons of challenges ahead.

I know these answers are frustrating to hear but I recently made the switch to partitioning a 20Gb windows bootcamp and run iracing through that. I find I get far better performance running on the native operating system for iracing and it gives you the bonus of running additional programs like ispeed.

Anyway, somehow I ended up in the top split with all these well-known iRacing names like Pablo Lopez and Jorn Jens and a lot of the big teams were present (Radicals, Redline, etc.).  Anyway, I had a heck of a start and was lying in 4th position on lap 1. Coming up on Stavelot, I got a tankslapper and couldn't correct it. I went into the wall and bonuced back on track with a horrified face.  I managed to wipe out all the high ranking iR guys in one fell swoop. All those guys who I've watched countless times via streams or YouTube crashed into my MP4 and left the server swearing.  Never felt so tiny and so bad about a f*ckup."
iRacing,3acn9a,Arfman2,9,Fri Jun 19 11:38:18 2015 UTC,"24 Hours of Daytona earlier this year.  My roommate (a very fast driver with two SCCA Solo championships -- last year's title came in the largest field in history, and he edged out Bryan Heitkotter for the title) was one of the drivers on my team, and chose to use his own computer and monitor in his room instead of using my home built cockpit, which I would have preferred him to do since it has wired ethernet instead of wifi, 3 screens instead of 1, etc.  His setup was a gaming laptop plugged in to an HDTV via HDMI.    Anyway, the wireless router in my house at the time was not as strong as I wished, and one of the problems that caused was that the Chromecast in my living room would lose the Wifi signal, which would require it to be unplugged to reset.  Well, my girlfriend decided around 4 hours into the race that she wanted to watch Netflix on the living room TV.  Chromecast didn't work, she unplugged it, and her iPhone then defaulted to the next closest Chromecast, which happened to be plugged in to his TV.  So, 4 hours into the race, we've gone from 36th on the grid to 9th overall in a GT3, had absolutely no problems, and then suddenly as he's going through turn 4 at Daytona at 170+, his screen goes from iRacing to Netflix and he slams the wall.  These endurance races in iRacing are full of crashes because people don't understand that to win them, you have to go absolutely problem free.  That was our only real incident of the race, and we spent 20 hours trying to play catch up with a damaged car.  We still finished 4th in class, but should have contended for the win."
iRacing,3acn9a,SOGorman35,7,Fri Jun 19 12:30:06 2015 UTC,Hitting the gas as soon as the light turns red. I've seen lots of other people do it since. I actually think it would be nice to change it to the way they do it in F1 with the red lights counting down and then they go out.
iRacing,3acn9a,emersonlakeandlagoon,5,Fri Jun 19 01:59:55 2015 UTC,"I used to do this at first.  I even did it when I actively thinking about not screwing it up.  It's just a major, abrupt change on screen and I couldn't help but react to it.  So I added a couple triggers in my brain:   Grid:  uncheck any fuel/tires then sit patiently Red:  clutch in and rev Green:  drop clutch   This way I could still do something at every point, and there is no danger of moving when the red lights appear.  It's a trick I learned in Starcraft.  Getting supply capped all the time?  Associate building supply with warping in units such that once you warp something in, you always build supply.  It takes thinking about it out of the equation and automates the correct action."

iRacing,3acn9a,jeremyfunktrain,6,Sat Jun 20 00:06:25 2015 UTC,"I have a couple. Streetstocks at Charlotte. On the formation lap Ive got my left foot on the brake pedal just so I don't tap the person in front. Race goes green and I'm trying to shift up but nothing's happening. After giving it a couple of goes plus getting rammed from behind I realise that I was hitting the brake not the clutch. Engine blew 2 laps later.  Mazda cup at summit point. Got the run on someone down the finish straight. Get excited to make a legit pass on someone for once in rookies. Move along side and think I've got the pass done. Move back to the left side of the road, he's still there and I take us both out. That replay was cringeworthy."

I've gotten to the point where I can always avoid scraping the wall no matter how hard the push, but i tend to lose a stupid amount of time.

iRacing,3abemx,tommy44vercetti,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:12:41 2015 UTC,"Easiest way for an IndyCar oval rookie is to just practice the aero push in open practice so you can feel how the car behaves. Just practice with randoms in groups of 2 or 3. That's usually the first thing I do when I practice a new week. Practicing without traffic is pointless and a waste of time, because you're in traffic more often than not, especially if you are a beginner.   When I started IndyCar ovals, I practiced 150-200 laps on each oval with different scenarios (all related to passing, traffic, clean air, and just what lines I can take well and what not). I think I did that for half a season before I got comfortable with the car.   Aero push is something I find really hard to explain. You feel the push around when you are between 0.8 seconds behind the car ahead or less.   If you notice my inputs this race, I start decelerating to make the turn and avoid getting pushed up. I want to prioritize making the turn and try to keep 60-70% throttle. If you are 0.1 seconds behind, you are way too close if you aren't attempting to make a pass. You need to learn when to lift (you probably need to lift earlier in your situation) and focus on getting on the throttle early on corner exit so you can stay close to the car ahead of you."

iRacing,3a6ukh,_Deh,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:17:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not the OP but I'm an accountant.  If you wanted to add some more series like C-A or some ovals you need to:  Continue the schedules in A-E and the tracks in J and K right below where they end now.  This is simple.  Just type in what you need.  Also add the tracks you added on the front page to the table of prices on the price tab.  The prices are on the track purchasing page.  The by week tab doesn't need to be updated until next season.  And the tricky part is to change the vlookup formulas in column F and G.  If you click on cell F2 for example the formula comes up in that bar on top.  Do you see after the first comma where it says prices!$A$1:$B$28?  That means it goes into the prices tab and looks up from A1 to B28, and the dollar signs mean it doesn't adjust when you copy the formula down the rest of the column.  If you add tracks to that list down to the 35th column for example you could change that formula to look to B35 instead of B28.   Same idea in column G which looks up in that list to the right from J2 to K29.  Leave everything else in that formula the same.  A shortcut I just learned recently would be to change it to A:B instead of $A$1:$B$whatever.  Should search the entire columns.  Since there aren't any charts down below these ones that should work.  You can easily copy the formula over and over down that column by holding down on the fill handle, which you get to by clicking on the cell you want to copy and then there's a little box in the lower right corner that appears and you drag it down however far you want or double click and it will go however far the data goes."
iRacing,3a58hy,IIIIIbarcodeIIIII,4,Wed Jun 17 09:26:41 2015 UTC,"I simply can't ignore the awesome sound of that V12. I like my V8s but, dat V12... It's music to my ears!   I own the Aston and not the Vette. Haven't raced yet but will be when I get home from uni.   Really it's a personal decision. The cars seem pretty equal from what I've heard: the Vette is a bit more slippery in a straight line and has more torque (so more initial ""punch"" coming out of the corners) but the Aston is better on the brakes and (I think) better in the corner.  Edit: should stress I haven't personally validated what's in that last paragraph. It's just what I've heard/seen in videos."
iRacing,3a58hy,vmaxmuffin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:02:50 2015 UTC,"Car comparison is correct. The Vette has more torque, the Aston has more downforce making it better on the brakes and in the corners but slower on the straights.   Having tried both I prefer the Aston's characteristics but it seems to be slightly slower over a lap this week (watkins glen) due to its extra drag. I find it easier to place exactly where I want and be smooth with.  I will stress we are not talking huge differences between the cars, they are fundamentally the same.."
iRacing,3a58hy,Turnermator13,2,Wed Jun 17 18:23:37 2015 UTC,"I had the same dilemma a couple of days ago. I ended up buying them both, then tried them for a few laps around Spa on the first day.  First was Aston as I was biased towards it and I have to say it didnt wow me like I thought it would. After maybe 10 minutes I've switched to Corvette and I've fallen in love with it instantly. I was practicing in Corvette all week 13 in preparation for start of official series so I didnt have the chance to get back in Aston, but I intend to. It seems to be easier to handle and a lot of people chose it over the Corvette and that says something.  From my very limited experience Aston has better brakes like /u/vmaxmuffin says. Its clear difference between the cars, but Corvette somehow, over the course of a lap, catches up despite braking early. Also, I like the sound of Corvette better, its just beastly.  GT1 is a wreckfest right now, but I'm hoping it will get better when dangerous elements leave it for something else. I think GT3 will still be more popular this season. We'll see in a couple of weeks how's the participation after the dust settles."

However, I just want to say...ever hear those massive thundering V8s that Mercedes has these days? The Vette is like that, so deep and throaty it sounds like a 1940's fighter plane engine. It's a tough 50/50 for me..."

The cars drive a bit differently but the balance seems to be really, really good. Last night I saw 5 C6Rs and 5 Astons in the top 10 of a top split GT1 race. The vette has more top end pull (I tested both cars with minimum wing at Daytona and got about 10kph more out of the vette with no other changes to setups), but the Aston is a bit more nimble."

iRacing,3a58hy,YNOTtheTIGER,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:22:07 2015 UTC,i have both and have raced both but i prefer the aston over the vette.  i have never been able to jump in a car and race it so hard so early than i have with the aston.  the vette feels a lot better than it used to with the newer tire model but the aston feels more stable under braking and on turn in.  i think it has a bit more understeer but its still faster through the turns.  and that mufuckin V12 sounds godly
iRacing,3a58hy,lagatron,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:09:15 2015 UTC,"I own both, but I always found the Corvette to be undrivable and I'm slow on it. On the other hand, I'm doing quite well in the Aston, which is perhaps easier to drive (at least for me). And, dat V12."
iRacing,3a6eae,Freezerburn26,4,Wed Jun 17 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"Well you probably should be asking in /r/simracing since this is a group of people who are mostly going to agree that iRacing is the best sim out there.  In any case, if you are interested in competition, nothing compares to iRacing. Nothing. Anyone who tries to argue that is decidedly wrong.  If you just want to drive around in any car at any track you can and aren't too concerned about quality competition, then Assetto Corsa or Project Cars are popular modern racing games which offer the ability to run a vast number of cars and tracks at a lower price. The online experience is way behind iRacing and the important factor here is that only iRacing (through its subscription based service) provides a sim as well as a tremendous community and officially sanctioned leagues, match making, competitive races several times per hour, etc.  In iRacing you can log on and decide you want to run a race, choose from a list of several dozens launching in the next hour or two and then get dropped into a race grouped together with similarly skilled drivers. Any other game you have to find your own community in which to race and in the best of cases this will mean racing a scheduled event at a particular date and time."

I started with F1 2014 (just to focus on track markers and on being smooth on the throttle, as without TC, it's pretty tricky). I then moved to R3E (as it was free). I couldn't resists GSCE after that, mainly due to all the various types of F1 car available. I found the force feedback and the realistic physics to be excellent.  Last Friday I finally took the plunge to sign up for iRacing because of the 3 months free offer. I've only done open practice and ghost qualifying, but I could be reasonably competitive (between 8th and 17th of 30, usually) during Week 13, where most of the guys were having B, C or D licenses. I would learn towards something a bit more forgiving for a month or two, to start off, and then start ghost racing in iRacing. Good luck!"
iRacing,3a6eae,DiscGolfer947,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:21:04 2015 UTC,"iRacing was my first sim.  I got a wheel for f1 2014 then remembered about iRacing and went and got a subscription.  One if the best decisions of my life....even though it's costed me about 3 grand (in content, triple monitors, a new PC (which I planned on doing anyway, but this was half of that sum), and upgraded pedals) over the last 2 years.  I wouldn't take back a single cent I've spent on it.  Edit: and the biggest thing is practice. Practice, practice, practice, practice...did I say to practice yet?  You never want to be that guy that wrecks everyone right off of the line going into turn one.  I did 3 days of private test sessions before I ever hoped into a practice session with other cars.  And another 2 days before I did my first race.  Also, don't get discouraged for being slow. Unless you're a superhuman you will probably never be able to compete with the best drivers on the service.  Just race your races and you'll almost always find a car (or 20) that are similar pace to you and have a great time.  Nothing is more fun than battling side by side with the same driver for 30 minutes to an hour, even if it is for last place.  I believe they are running a three month free trial promotion for new members right now as well (or something really cheap, like 5 bucks) so just pick it up and if you don't like it it won't be a big deal.

I strongly recommend, if you're here for ovals, to buy the DW12 and try it out once you get your C license.  It took me about a season to get from Rookie to there, but the Indycar is truly the best there is in oval to me, especially if you're not inclined towards stock cars."
iRacing,3a2onx,shartie,2,Thu Jun 18 20:20:26 2015 UTC,"Welcome! You probably already saw it, but there's a half-price deal right now on re-subs so you could buy another full year (which will be added on to the time you already have remaining - nothing is lost) for $49. This is the best price you will get on subs. It will be at this price again in November, but now is the time to add another year if you're thinking you're going to stick around (hint: if you like competitive racing, then you should stick around). :)"

I mostly drive the McLaren GT3 car, but these GT1 cars are a different kind of beast. Im not sure if I like it more than GT3, but it definitely was fun. Im much more interesting in GT racing than open-wheel, and it seems like the GT1 series will have decent participation which is always a plus."
iRacing,3a2z29,InZomnia365,2,Wed Jun 17 04:49:27 2015 UTC,Hell yeah! Love the race times. The community in the vette was amazing. I hope GT1 can carry that and not be as nuts as GT3 can be.

Add that to the fact that GT3 has been quite stale for  a while (in terms of BoP), and how they slowed us down in the latest build, I think GT1 will do well. I think it will benefit a lot from the new integrated  practice/race system because you can see how many might be intetesting."

iRacing,3a1i4o,Memn0n,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:29:58 2015 UTC,The renewal period depends on what you bought. You bought the 3 month subscription so it renews in 3 months. If you buy a yearly subscription it'll renew in a year.

iRacing,3a2vyq,awesome682v2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"Last Season i raced both to limited success, This season Ill probably just race the modified and maybe dab little into the Tour Mod.  Street Stocks are fun because they drive like bath tubs and everyone is stuck with the same thing. You don't have to worry about sets so you need less practice time. However this brings less skilled drivers since its easier, atlas thats how Ive seen it.  Mods are in my opinion one of the most fun cars to drive on the game. Ive loved it since I've driven it with the baseline at USA. I suck at setups, however people are friendly and share setups if they see you trying in practice. Theres the setup shop where you can get an older setup and tinker from there so you don't have to start from scratch. Racing wise, if your in the top split its usually really good. And since there is no cautions if some idiots wreck they won't bunch the field back up and cause another accident. (that is the worst part about C street stocks is the caution fests, even in top splits)   Seeing as you ran the C class last season you shouldn't have to invest in many tracks as the schedules pretty much identical. Give the Mods and chance and I'm sure you'll love it!  Either way good luck on the track and have a good season!"

iRacing,39xb0d,alc277,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:10:09 2015 UTC,"I stopped using monitors. DK2 only now. Can't go back. It's too much fun even if there are some downsides. For example, you don't have the ""cheat"" of the ""virtual mirror"" which effectively gives you no blindspots. When I'm racing the DW12 I can probably only see about 20% of what is behind me to the left and right because the mirrors are very tiny -- I have to give people a little more room than I would otherwise which is arguably a good thing. But the thrill of looking to the right as you slingshot past someone on the backstretch to judge when you can pull back in to traffic never gets old."
iRacing,39xb0d,plaguuuuuu,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:13:22 2015 UTC,So I can get a DK2 and not have to worry about monitors at all. Even for the desktop in windows?
iRacing,39xb0d,Kubi74,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:37:28 2015 UTC,No you'll still need a single desktop monitor. The DK2 doesn't work automatically as a desktop monitor. There is a virtual desktop application but it's easier in my opinion to just use a regular monitor for members.iracing.com.  The biggest piece of advice I can give to people is to plan on mounting the camera sensor on a separate tripod or mount. Your driving will likely cause the camera to shake in very small amounts if your wheel is mounted to a desk.
iRacing,39xb0d,tjb1,2,Tue Jun 23 18:13:18 2015 UTC,There's no real reason to go overboard with the hardware IMO. I'm using an office chair and a g25 personally because my budget goes on my IRL car..  The only thing I'd like is a triple monitor setup or a wide single. Peripheral vision is important.
iRacing,39wc7m,Memn0n,3,Mon Jun 15 09:35:53 2015 UTC,"I think its a case of not learning everything. When you open the garage suddenly there are loads of options, I'm not someone who is good at making setups either, but I've been trying to do it gradually.  For example, I try and get the default setup and run a race stint, then just focus on tyre pressures, nothing else, until i understand why the change I've made has made a difference. So decrease it by 5 clicks, see what happens, run a race stint, is it better or worse? and then change it again. This narrows down the range for me to focus on. Then I add something else to the mix.   This doesn't always work. Sometimes basics like Brake Balance, or Wing, or Gearing are super obvious and need changes. But I think a lot of settings aren't going to make a massive difference to my lap times over a full race, or in the case of a GT3 for example, problems can be solved through more basic setting changes.  The Skippy has only 5 settings available to change, so I guess thats a really good place to start, understanding how tyre pressures change the handling, how the SPO changes etc."
iRacing,39wc7m,bouncebackability,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:08:39 2015 UTC,"That's what I figured out. I guess some of the options are going to influence 90% of the car, while the rest will just be there to help 0.1sec here and there on specific races. Also, I guess that the gear ratio is also one of the most important to adapt to each track ?"
iRacing,39wc7m,bouncebackability,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"yeah definitely, but its one of the easiest to get right, you should just reach the rev limit at the end of the longest straight in top gear, while some circuits and cars you may want to use 1st for the slowest corner, but I suppose this depends on how good the car is out of slow corners.  But then adjusting things like wing will then affect your gear ratios.  I'm not expert mind you"
iRacing,39wc7m,trackday,3,Mon Jun 15 14:52:54 2015 UTC,"This is something I had posted on iRacing before.  Fundamentally, the tire that is pushed into the ground the hardest is going to give the most grip.  I have been tuning my own sim cars for about 10 years now, and a few years ago a bulb went off in my head, these are the results:  My method, starts with this:   Corner Entry: Adjust rear rebound.   Rear breaks loose on turn-in - Increase rear rebound (Assuming you have moved brake bias to the front enough to make sure that isn't the problem)   Too tight on turn-in - decrease rear rebound.   Mid-corner Rotation: Adjust sway bars. The soft end gets the grip, i.e. decreasing front ARB increases rotation, etc.   Corner Exit: Adjust Front rebound.   Use maximum front rebound that will allow the rear to grip on exit. In other words, don't just zero out front rebound to get rear grip, you want to increase front rebound until the rears start slipping a little too much, then back off a little until tires get desired grip on exit.   After all that is said-and-done:   If all those adjustments still don't get you where you want to be, then you probably need a spring adjustment. For example, if the car is STILL too tight going into corners and mid-corner rotation, then it is time to go to softer front springs.   I usually have minimal compression dampening on both ends also, btw. Compression dampening simply keeps suspension from working properly, IMO.   These are the PRIMARY adjustments. These need to be followed by camber adjustments and tire pressures (looking at your tire wear). Caster radically effects your turn-in crispness, I like less, not more, usually. Ride height gives further control. Adjust aero as it becomes apparent how it is effecting your car at high speed vs. low speed. I.E. your car's suspension adjusts the handling at low and mid speeds without lots of aero effect, so the aero is tuned to match the great handling you've dialed in for the slower and mid-speed corners.   After you do all this, it is time to go back and play with tire pressures a little....experiment.   Fundamentally, the lower, softer end of the car gets the grip."

iRacing,39wc7m,plaguuuuuu,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:26:02 2015 UTC,"Compression damping is pretty important too. Too high is bad, but too low causes oscillations after going over kerbs or bumps, or in extreme cases in s bends and the car will be unstable in transitions  'critical damping' is a useful concept as well. Damping should usually increase as spring rate increases and vice versa"
iRacing,39wc7m,Brapplezz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:11:40 2015 UTC,Read about what certain things do. And then just go into practice and change your setup for the track of the week. This takes alot of trial and error but come race it may mean you can be faster through the corners.
iRacing,39wc7m,Falcon140,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:51:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like bump stiffness, rebound stiffness etc is not something that I would sense easily. Maybe if I eat the curb and I'm sent airborne, I'll understand that its something that needs to be checked, but I'm not sure I would feel the difference in every corner."
iRacing,39wc7m,Gian_Doe,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:22:58 2015 UTC,"You just have to know what to look for. If you change it and your car suddenly picks up understeer mid corner or the tail gets light under braking, then the weight isn't transferring like it needs to and the shocks will dial that in."
iRacing,39wc7m,thisguysmokey,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:09:14 2015 UTC,For most cars bump and rebound are typically minor compared to other settings.  But in my experience the dampers become a prime tuning area in cars with very little suspension travel.  Formula 1 and Star Mazda for example.  Dampers are one of the first things I mess with when tuning those types of cars.  But in a car like the Miata dampers are one of the last things I mess with.

I use telemetry Motec and iSpeed to tweak my setups. There is a Sim Racing Setup Analyzer, but I find it not that helpful for me.   There are a lot of other resources out there for other games that apply for iRacing, the principles remain the same. Stick with one car, and know what it likes and doesn't like. The setup for the RUF is completely different of the Z4, so don't go switching cars, it'll mess you up.  I don't even bother to race the Williams F1, it's too complicated for somebody like me who really doesn't know anything about mechanics outside of simracing."

iRacing,39wc7m,sim-racingcouk,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:41:28 2015 UTC,"Best advice I can give you is a lot of reading at the start, learn what things do and the cause and effect of them. I work with cars for a living and understand what does what which gave me a huge advantage to iracing.   After you have done some reading start playing with your setups, only adjust one or two things at a time so you can notice the difference it makes.   Also if you are unsure what something does or will do to your car my best advice is to MAX out the setting then do a lap, you should notice the change.  Then set it to the MIN setting, do a lap and you will see the adverse effects. From their you will start to understand it better and can adjust to your liking.   Here are some links that may help.   http://www.racelinecentral.com/RacingSetupGuide.html  I personally like this one, I also own a lot of carroll smith's books -  http://performanceforums.com/forums/showthread.php?67203917-Some-great-suspension-tuning-info-Thanks-Carroll-Smith-RIP&highlight=carroll%20smith"

iRacing,39wc7m,Sasken,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:16:23 2015 UTC,When you are testing your settings make sure you save a new one after each improvement and label with a good detail on how the car feels. That way you have something to go back to if one of your adjustments goes crazy and you can't remember what you did or what it was before.

My method was to check each thing that could be changed, look at the description, and write it on a sheet of paper. Not word for word, but what I understood it does.  On my current sheets, it looks like a list of possible changes, with in front of each a list of ""+"" saying what it does when I augment it, and a list of arrows saying what happens when there is more of this on the front (or left) than on the back (or right).  When I'm tuning my car, I just ask myself about the improvement I would wish. Something like ""My car is unstable on braking here, it's dangerous"", I check my papers to see what I can do, I click once or twice on one button, then I check if it did the trick by doing a few laps."

As I understand it, the GT3 Aston will be a distinctly scanned and developed car. If that's correct, then it will be almost guaranteed to be a separate purchase due to the cost of doing that."

iRacing,39nvct,hckyplyr606,2,Sat Jun 13 20:56:17 2015 UTC,"Driving it for the first time, down to a 1:41.6 or so practicing on race fuel, normally drive the Skip, and before that the MX-5. The top guys in the practice sessions I was in did 1:40.0.   That said, observations:   The thing is really heavy and bad at braking, but it helps to brake very hard and very early with big throttle blips like Obesity_ said.  Tires heat up from 125F to 220F over the course of a run, and get MUCH less grippy over time. The fastest laps are the first couple out of the pits.  People on the forums talked about brake bias being a big deal and adjusting it over a run as fuel came off, because I guess the tank is in the front and the weight distribution changes. I haven't tried this, but I have had a hard time braking later in runs; I just chalked it up to tire temperature.  Throttle control is not as hard as it seems; you really can learn to predict when the back will step out and get onto the throttle more gradually in those places. I have no experience with high-powered cars and did fine with it. The hardest thing is the change with temperature, because it'll step out in a place where it was fine just a few laps earlier.  It takes a LOT of throttle to stabilize, and there is a LOT of off-throttle oversteer. If you are trying to save it from spinning, DON'T jump off the throttle; stay at least at 30% and often more, and countersteer extremely violently. (And rip the wheel back to center even more violently when it comes back.)"

I used one posted by yassine something.  Apart from that you could maybe play with the brake bias, I was having it get loose under braking so that helped a bit.  Probably the biggest thing that helped me was giving it a big blip on downshift. So I left foot brake and give the throttle a good slap on the downshift. That settles it down a lot more.   Finally get your braking done early, I found if I went too deep there was no real saving it.  This was my first week driving it however so certainly no expert."

This will begin on Monday at around midnight. At the minute, due to week 13 all events are ""rookie"" events. But once the 12 week season starts everything will be in specific categories dependent upon your license level. Personally I would just use this week to get used the car that you intend to drive for the upcoming 12 weeks. The learning curve can be quite steep, even if you know what you are doing. So I would suggest just driving one car to start with and trying to master that. Divisions are related to iRacing, for example to be a division 1 driver you need to have an iRating of around 3000."

Now, to answer the SRF vs Mazda Cup vs Solstice part of the question, this is Week 13. iRacing operates on a 12 week season - 4 per year. At the end of a season, a new build with updates and often new content is released, and Week 13 is a ""fun"" week that allows people to try out new content or unusual car/track combinations, while giving time for the devs to iron out any major bugs that appear with the new build. During Week 13, only one official series is run in each of Road and Oval (to allow people to raise their SR above 3.00 to graduate to the next licence before the next season). Normally on the road side they run the MX5 cup - like usual - however this season they changed it to the SRF, just because.  Divisions are assigned at the begining of a season based on iRating. You compete within your own division's points championship in each series, although not that many people actually care about championships from what I can tell. However, this has no affect on who you actually race against in a race. It is also completely unrelated to licence levels (although faster drivers with higher iRating in higher divisions will tend to have higher licences, and vice-versa). The Rookie series is always open to all licence levels (except Rookie Street Stock on the oval side, which is Rookie and D only), however usually you won't see higher level drivers in your races because they would normally be running in higher level series. That doesn't mean they don't run in rookie series ever - I sometimes will pop into the fixed MX5 Cup for fun, as a B class Road driver - however normally you still won't see these people because usually they have a higher iRating and will be placed in a higher split for races. Now, back to Week 13 - as I said, there are only two official series (where iRating and Safety Rating count) in Week 13 - one oval, one road. At 12:00am Tuesday we'll switch over to Week 1 of Season 3 and it will be back to business as usual. Side note - Speaking of official vs unofficial, in normal seasons almost all series are official - the exception being the Carburetor Cup. Qualifying and Time Trial sessions are also official. Any hosted/league races are unoffical, as are all practice sessions and any official race that fails to get the minimum number of drivers (6 or 8 depending on the series). I have no clue. Post in the iRacing forum if you can't get it to work."
iRacing,39nlzs,vmaxmuffin,2,Sat Jun 13 05:36:31 2015 UTC,"It will be back to normal on thuesday.  The rookie road car is the Mazda MX-5 The first track of the season with this car will be Summit Point Raceway, for a 15 laps race.  So in the mean time, launch a test session with the right track and the right car and get ready.  Just to get you in the mood, here is a short presentation of the track from the last season : http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3304818.page  You are ready to race when you can do a race length entirely on the track, and can manage to stay on the inside line/outside line everywhere without crashing (will be important when you will be passed)  And here is a very important link to bookmark : http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/1354827.page#2946101  Have fun :)"
iRacing,39nlzs,wygo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:44:05 2015 UTC,"Many thanks to all for the replies. I see that Week 13 is over now and things are looking more like I had expected, so I don't feel so hopelessly lost.  I'm going to spend some time going through all those recommended videos and have read through the pre-race briefing. I can't wait to jump into the Mazda Cup. I spent a good while in the Mazda at Lime Rock, and have seen a few more of the tracks on the schedule. I plan to do a couple of hours of practice before jumping into every race. I'm hoping to just keep it on the track, rather than pushing as hard as I can and ruining my SR. It seems like getting out of rookies is difficult and you can get a decent finish by just not crashing. In terms of the championship, can you do the same round more than once? Is it your best points score that count? And also, in terms of qualifying, does your qualifying time determine which split you are in, or how does that work? Can I qualify today and race tomorrow?"
iRacing,39nlzs,rancer890,0,Thu Jun 18 09:54:14 2015 UTC,"Next week. This week is Week 13...I highly recommend that as a rookie, you do not race anything official :)... Divisions don't relate to licenses. There are 11 licenses on iRacing, from Division 1 to Division 10, and Rookie. When you start iRacing, you are in the Rookie division. When you get your D-license (Rookie 3.0 safety rating), you move to one of the 10 divisions which is dependent on your iRating (basically helps the system put you into a 'split' based on a number). I don't know where the cutoff numbers are, but the higher your division, the more 'skilled' you are. It isn't an exact science, but for now, just focus on getting out of Rookie next week (3.0 safety rating). Anyone can race in the Rookie road series (MX5 Cup), but only those with a D-class license with a 4.0 safety rating or under can race the Rookie oval series (Street Stocks). But usually on Week 13 any license can race in the Rookie series (in this case, the SRF and the Street Stock).  I have no idea. :P"

I use the short throw version of his previous design and it's a great solid piece of kit. His newer design (V8 Supercar style) looks even better still, though it's a bit more pricey. I think the older unit is still available. Something to consider if you can't find stock on what you're looking for. I don't know anyone who has been anything but really happy with their DSD hardware (not that I'm saying Fanatec isn't good - I use a CSW V2 personally and love it, too)."

iRacing,39k93m,sdizzle23,4,Fri Jun 12 08:53:15 2015 UTC,"Your best 8 weeks count. The points are averaged, so if you race 4 times your best result counts. Race 8 times and it's the average of your 2 best etc etc.   Therefore simply racing more doesn't mean more points. The higher the average irating of those in the race the more points are awarded."
iRacing,39k93m,welded_sheep,3,Fri Jun 12 09:22:10 2015 UTC,Also you will want to look at high strength of field (SOF) races.  The high SOF races will give more points per race then less populated races.
iRacing,39k93m,Distantsound,4,Fri Jun 12 11:34:24 2015 UTC,All of this results in most of the championship contenders doing at most 4 races a week.

iRacing,39jq41,arsenicfox,2,Fri Jun 12 09:03:02 2015 UTC,"Even better if you speak up via mic. I've had one guy screaming at me and looked at the replay one time. I pointed out how it was on my screen, giving detail, even degrees of the cars facing. I told him i'd gladly share him my replay but that i was sorry it happened. He cooled down and spoke how this was his 3rd race in a row where something like that happened and how he often gets taken out in the same turn.   We had a nice chat. Sometimes just talking normal and not getting defensive helps in the long run. :)"

iRacing,39jq41,Bakkster,2,Fri Jun 12 15:16:20 2015 UTC,I think it's worth responding to the protest to explain your side of the issue. I am going to assume you're a relatively new driver and that is something they will be able to see and might consider. It might not overturn it but I would still give my side of it for piece of mind.
iRacing,39jq41,trey_chaffin,2,Fri Jun 12 07:25:18 2015 UTC,"One more bit of advice, always save your replays. Check the option that always prompts you to do so.  Can't show your side of the story unless you have the replay."
iRacing,39jq41,trey_chaffin,2,Fri Jun 12 18:33:29 2015 UTC,Ever since I was bullied into shutting up by an iracing high ranking employee I generally avoid dealing with the protest system as much as possible.

iRacing,39jq41,MysticalMuffDiver,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:45:01 2015 UTC,"Had an issue with an employee where I did not know he was an employee and was joking with him in race.  He got mad, issued me an official warning.  I told him I did not know he was an employee and I was just joking around (as I had not broken any rules).  He didn't care.  I posted in a forum on iracing (without using any names) where there were some people that helped me from time to time that I had an issue with an employee and how do I contact iracing to discuss it (as he had access to normal reports on users so I did not want to use that route).  Again no names no details just that I had an issue with an employee.  Within 5 minutes of me posting that it was deleted and I got another message from him saying that he could get me in trouble for posting that on the forums.  He did give me the contact info to appeal the warning but he made it clear it would be a waste of time and it would probably just end up with me in more trouble."
iRacing,39jq41,kaluh_glarski,3,Wed Jun 17 05:57:31 2015 UTC,In the top corner of the screen a little emblem will appear if you're going the wrong way. You don't have much time to react though.   To be honest though it might just worth accepting the lesson and using the week to practice. Its tough early on but you have to accept a lot of practice to get good.
iRacing,39jq41,arsenicfox,0,Fri Jun 12 05:49:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice. I did see the warning but it was too late.  I am not sure which lesson I should be learning. I put in at least 60 laps before trying to qualify. Yes, I made a mistake and spun but this is not the point. There was no malicious intent or retaliation involved in the incident."
iRacing,39jq41,TannerMcC,2,Fri Jun 12 06:16:46 2015 UTC,If you hit someone don't just log out and let that be the end of it. You need to apologize when you hit someone. An apology goes a long way when you are ruining someones race.   You also didn't practice enough if you couldn't tell which is the right way.  The wall should be on your right and the infield is only a handful of turns.
iRacing,39jq41,TannerMcC,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:02:36 2015 UTC,"Well, you couldn't have known at the time but if you have a feeling someone is going to protest you, you should save a copy of the replay yourself.  If I know I've done something stupid, even without meaning to, I immediately try to apologize, and if the person ive wronged doesn't respond, I'll send them a private message. Doesn't take a whole lot of effort to at least try to smooth things over, and being able to race for that week instead of losing out is worth a try"

iRacing,39jq41,arsenicfox,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:21:31 2015 UTC,"What license are you, how many races have you been in? Sometimes they will be more understanding if you're a new driver.  That being said, I'm confused how you could run 8 clean laps to qualify and yet not know the correct way to drive on any part of the track at Charlotte, it's not exactly a track with turns that aren't distinctive and being able to run 8 clean laps in a SRF indicates to me you at least know somewhat what you're doing.   HOWEVER, I'd recommend calling Nim. I've heard of people calling him and getting out of suspensions (but very very stern warnings are handed out.. ""Happens again it'll be a much much longer suspension"". IE I believe you, but don't prove me or yourself wrong.  I think if you called and said you made a mistake and got lost in the infield. Then explain you've talked to other drivers in the service and they've explained the proper ways to handle this situation from reentering the track in a safe manner when you're SURE you know where you are instead of guessing and if you do make a mistake immediately apologizing and contacting the driver you had the incident with (whether it be in the forums or in game chat, I prefer a forum message just because it gives a chance you write move and be more thoughtful). If you did this I think he might see that you learnt your lesson and are genuinely attempting to make up for your mistake and be more likely to reduce the suspension.  Also I'd recommend contacting the driver who you hit and apologize to him, if you can't remember who it was just message everyone in the race."

I spun into the infield behind the crest of T6. All I could see was dirt. I thought I was on the other side, and was headed onto T6-T7 straight, towards the back. Turns out it was the T5-T6 straight. I edged in to get a better view but it was too late and couldn't avoid the oncoming car. I'm sure this sounds suspect but please give me the benefit of the doubt. This is all from memory, trying to reconstruct what happened.   I wish I had a replay to show you my point of view. There were simply no reference points to pick up my position.

(Sort of like a Saleen Mustang or Calaway Vette except Ruf is actually considered a manufacturer)Because they are technically a manufacturer iRacing was able to buy a license from Ruf which gives us Ruf's car which is essentially a extremely beefed up Porsche 911 Turbo which is the RWD and AWD versions in iRacing. Then iRacing added the specs and wind tunnel data from a GT3 Porsche and applied that data to the Ruf and created the Ruf Track, similar idea with the C spec.

iRacing,39h7eu,jrebs,2,Thu Jun 11 18:29:46 2015 UTC,"I think so, but I've never tried it. I don't keep Steam running (just launch it when I want to play a Steam game) so I've never had it running while in iRacing.  I think you have to ""install"" iRacing on Steam in order to be able to launch it, and I've always been nervous to do that. iRacing is ALREADY installed (and working perfectly) and I don't want to fuck around with it."
iRacing,39h7eu,jrebs,2,Thu Jun 11 18:31:44 2015 UTC,"Yes you can only launch it from the site, installing it in steam will just have you go to the site whenever you click. The only reason I activated it on steam is so I can see all the hours I spend in iracing."
iRacing,39h7eu,jrebs,-5,Fri Jun 12 04:29:54 2015 UTC,And it's still a terrible deal...don't buy from steam. PR-BLANCPAIN2015 = 3 months free if you sign up directly.
iRacing,39h7eu,jrebs,5,Thu Jun 11 18:17:48 2015 UTC,This 3 months free is only for NEW memberships.
iRacing,39h7eu,jrebs,-5,Thu Jun 11 18:20:26 2015 UTC,So? The price being offered even with the discount is very high. Anyone who knows how iRacing works knows that paying anywhere remotely close to full price for sub is throwing money in the shitter. Every summer they usually offer a discounted re-subscription deal (because that is when a vast many users are nearing the end of a sub cycle since it went public in August 2008). And better still is to buy your subs in Nov during black friday at half price. I just add another year every november for $49 USD. Just over $4/mo.
iRacing,39h7eu,Sasken,2,Thu Jun 11 18:24:30 2015 UTC,"I'm getting way more than 50% discount at the memberships deals right now, did you even tried the link i posted?"
iRacing,39hn9y,Alibambam,2,Thu Jun 11 19:51:05 2015 UTC,Ridiculous. I have completely avoided all Week 13 activity and have been privately practicing at Watkins for week 1.  And a quick tip: turn off auto blip for GT1. Both cars perform considerably better under braking and acceleration w/o it. You will need to teach yourself to manually blip down - only took a week of practice for me to get confident with it.
iRacing,39hn9y,yourdp,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:42:12 2015 UTC,"How do you like the car on NTMv6? How it compares to the last build?  Before Aston came out I was sure I'll get it in order to participate in new GT1 series. Now I'm leaning more towards Corvette.   BOP looks very promising, cars are pretty close from what I read on the forums."
iRacing,39hn9y,theebe,2,Fri Jun 12 09:08:13 2015 UTC,"I've only had about an hour with it (and I only drive Vette) but the car feels more sticky - able to point and shoot better. That feeling also came from running 2015S2 sets and not the new Vette baseline which is dramatically different (new ballast and ARB sensitivity).  The ability to power slide has been amplified with the NTM carcase heating which more accurately portrays how the GT1 drivers command the car around the course. But this behavior can also lead to some abused rear tires giving you trouble mid to end race.  As I always do, I'll post each weeks GT1 race and will do my best to provide commentary on how the car feels!"
iRacing,39hn9y,yourdp,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:25:33 2015 UTC,I know. I saw 3 cars hitting each other on my inside and decided to cut my losses and just take the time penalty instead of crashing out

iRacing,39hn9y,WhyDoISuckAtW2,3,Thu Jun 11 20:22:55 2015 UTC,Unofficial races means you don't get penalized for mistakes or losing. So people don't try as hard to keep it clean.

I can't knock buying an affordable wheel with a logo on it. These new products are just absurdly priced for a console wheel. Sure you can use it on the PC but they have built them for console users..

iRacing,39jfg2,arsenicfox,-2,Fri Jun 12 13:50:33 2015 UTC,I didn't qualify for a race but I was a half second faster than everyone.  Not even exaggerating. I was passing a guy on the straight away and he clearly turned into my right rear. So I caught back up to the same looking car and spun the wrong guy out.    I felt bad and decided that wrecking ruins the game and im never doing it again
iRacing,39jfg2,MysticalMuffDiver,12,Fri Jun 12 14:56:18 2015 UTC,What the fuck is your malfunction to think it was a reasonable reaction to begin with? I hope you never come back to iRacing because frankly you don't deserve it as a service. You obviously joined the service without reading the sporting code.  Be the bigger man and take the spin. There is an option to protest for a reason. For all you know the guy just didn't see you and drifted slightly into you. It could also have been a phantom contact from netcode. YOU SHOULD NEVER INTENTIONALLY SPIN OUT ANOTHER RACER.   I don't care if I get downvotes for being so abrasive to you.. That kind of behavior should give you a perma ban. This is an expensive service and I pay my hard earned money to avoid assholes like you.

iRacing,39fk4t,vmaxmuffin,2,Thu Jun 11 11:41:22 2015 UTC,Only thing you do need d class for is to meet your MPR (minimum participation rating). Basically 4 races or 2 TTs and 2 races IIRC. These have to be done at your licence level (I.e. D class) or above (when you get to D4.0 you can enter C class races and do your MPR there).
iRacing,39fk4t,sicou2,2,Thu Jun 11 12:59:18 2015 UTC,Basically 4 races or 2 TTs and 2 races IIRC   Note: it is 4 races OR 4 TT's. Not a combination of both.
iRacing,39fk4t,thefool808,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:18:29 2015 UTC,"What /u/vmaxmuffin is saying is:  In order to be promoted beyond D Class (i.e. to a C Class license), you need a safety rating > 3.0 AND you need your MPR (minimum participation credits).  You can work on your safety rating in any race you are eligible for, including anything at or below your license level.  However, you can only gain MPR by racing at your license level.  You can view your MPR status at the bottom of this page: http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/CareerStats.do"
iRacing,39fk4t,SkippyZA,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:07:47 2015 UTC,"ok great. I have been away from iracing for about 3 months and wanted to get back into it, focusing on safety rating and then once getting into the swing of things go back up to D class and work on my MPR. Just wasn't sure if it was worth my time to race with rookie class cars or not. Thank you /u/thefool808, and /u/vaxmuffin. clears it up."
iRacing,39fk4t,DeathHaze420,2,Thu Jun 11 13:52:17 2015 UTC,No point in worrying about safety rating right now unless you want to get to C class. You can't get demoted to Rookie class. Once out of rookie hell you are safe.   Rather focus on getting your iRating up a little so that you can get out of the bottom splits. Higher split races normally bring better and cleaner racing too which bring up your safety rating.
iRacing,39fk4t,awesome682v2,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:28:22 2015 UTC,O.o really? Hells yes! I've been so concerned about getting my SR up to avoid being dropped to rookie lol. It's made enjoying as oval very difficult with all the pile ups.  I thought for sure I would drop down to rookie and miss a week or two of the late model series. Thank you
iRacing,39fk4t,Fuzzwah,-1,Thu Jun 11 18:24:01 2015 UTC,just be aware the lower you are under your licence level (say a A licence runs a D class race) you will lose more SR
iRacing,39fk4t,shitcock55,6,Thu Jun 11 13:16:50 2015 UTC,"I used to think this as well, but after some explanations in another thread, reading over a heap of info and digging deeply into my own stats I've corrected my thinking.  The only thing that matters when it comes to SR is Corners Per Incident. The reason it seems like higher license drivers get punished more for incidents in lower licensed events is two fold:  1) they're required to maintain a higher CPI 2) races in lower series tend to be shorter; thus less corners  Here's the graph which shows the CPI requirements for each license and SR level:  http://www.fuzzwahracing.com/2015/05/corners-per-incident-for-each-license.html"

iRacing,39e485,Scrimps,11,Thu Jun 11 03:21:23 2015 UTC,"iRacing is a multiplayer simracing service as opposed to just a simracing game, it's entirely multiplayer (no AI, but you can do solo hotlapping). The multiplayer experience in other sims really doesn't compare unless you're involved in a league, and with that comes time commitments and other hassles, iRacing is really the only option out there for clean, pickup multiplayer racing.   There's a license system and a code of conduct which keeps out the riff raff, it (usually) stops the trolls and assholes from wrecking you out of races.   Each season has 12 weeks, each series runs one track a week. There's a championship system if you're into that, you get points from 8 out of the 12 weeks of a season (meaning you can have 4 drop weeks) and you can be ranked among those in your division.   There are a handfull of cars and tracks that are free with a subscription, there's a three month free promocode going on right now (PR-BLANCPAIN2015) with that you'll be able to run a good bit of free content before deciding whether you want to invest more into the sim.   iRacing is probably the most expensive consumer sim out there, to own 100% of the content (which is completely unnecessary) you're looking at over $1,000. You can get away with a full experience (depending on what series you're interested in running) for much much less than that. There are post on the subreddit breaking down the best ways to spend money in iRacing but if you have more questions about it I can detail them here.   It might be worth trying other sims like Assetto Corsa or Raceroom before iRacing, to see if you have an interest in it. Nothing can really beat a clean multiplayer racing experience though, can't replicate the feeling of adrenaline that you get from racing against actual people."
iRacing,39e485,4InchesOfury,3,Thu Jun 11 04:08:43 2015 UTC,"He hit most of the good points. One thing I would add is if you're are watching racing for crashes then something like Project cars would be better but if your a pure racing fan that enjoys the on track battling, strategy and racer aft then iracing is where you want to be Also if you have a little extra money I would recommend getting a load cell braking system as that simulates actual braking (pressure based) opposed to a linear brake pedal that comes with the g27."
iRacing,39e485,True_Racer,2,Thu Jun 11 04:53:40 2015 UTC,"A few more points to add to this post...  The cost of iRacing often seems overwhelming. It's (USD) $11.95 per car and $11.95 or $14.95 per track, and on top of that there's your subscription for the service which starts at $12 per month and the best deal is two years for $179. However at least twice a year iRacing will have a promotion for half price one or two year renewals, and often deals for buying credits for the sim (something like $20 credit for $15), so there's ways to save. You can also save money by buying smart - which means buying only cars and tracks you need, and also always buying content in groups. You get 10% off when you buy 3-5 pieces of content in one go, and 20% off when you buy 6 or more. Most people try and buy cars and tracks in groups of 6 to take advantage of this, so just buy smart.  All this being said, if you think about the cost of iRacing compared to real-world motorsport, it's insanely cheap - even compared to karting or taking your daily to a couple of track days. That's the way you need to think about it - as a hobby, rather than just a game.  Definitely take advantage of the 3 months free deal. I did when I first signed up (it was a different promotion at the time but same 3 months free), and it's plenty of time to try out the free content with no risk to see if iRacing is for you. Be aware though that the rookie series races on both road and oval sides of the service are full of people with no clue when it comes to racing - generally wreckfests. So it's not the best representation of what it's actually like to race in iRacing when you reach a higher licence level."
iRacing,39e485,vmaxmuffin,2,Thu Jun 11 05:01:08 2015 UTC,"not OP but have a question. i did the 3 month deal for 5$. that ran out like 1-2 months ago.   so i got more sim gear, got a rig, and been practicing alot getting better in other games pcars AC etc. what do i do now for iracing? so to get back in i need to pay 12$ monthly? because those two times a year arent really soon i dont think.  is it just 12$ to play iracing again in rookies?"
iRacing,39e485,chimpyman,2,Thu Jun 11 10:00:43 2015 UTC,You cannot use the service if you do not have an active subscription regardless what your licence level is.
iRacing,39e485,nomofica,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:31:03 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the three months free is only for new accounts so yes you would need to pay. On the website they're currently advertising half price memberships but I believe this is only for new ones.

Basically I got 2 years for 90$ on black Friday, and bought the 18 extra bits of content for about $190-$200 ish. That was spaced out over a long time. In august there is usually an extra credits deal at some point (looking at past sales) so I will be buying that to get the Nurburgring and a couple more cars at the end of this season.  It's very expensive compared to normal games but for me, iRacing is worth every penny. I hate AI and never race them in normal racing games so iRacing is perfect for me."
iRacing,39e485,WillSimRace4Food,5,Thu Jun 11 12:13:00 2015 UTC,"/u/4InchesOfury gave a pretty solid answer without getting bogged into details.  Couple other things I'd add on:  Don't worry about the $1k estimate on content -- that only would happen if you bought every piece of content one at a time. There is a discount when you buy 3 pieces at once, a bigger discount at 6 pieces, and an even bigger discount when you hit the 100% completion. Add in the annual or biannual credits sale (spend $75 get $100 credits) and it gets even cheaper.  For example, two new pieces of content came out this week -- I think they were both $12.00 each. But because I'm a 100% owner, the after-tax cost was about $16.00. Since I'd bought the 4-for-3 credits deal, my real cost was only about $12.00. Plus, you can receive up to ten dollars in credit a season just by racing.  Secondly, there really are very few reasons to be part of the 100% club. Content is essentially broken down in to road racing, short track oval, NASCAR oval, and deprecated content (there are a couple of cars that are no longer used and a couple of tracks that aren't part of the official racing). If you're a road racer, you may never wind up at the high end of the ladder for short track oval, so you don't need that content.  Finally, a little bit of judicious planning and not only will you limit yourself to just a couple of pieces of content every quarter but you'll get a whole lot better at competing in iRacing (one of the biggest mistakes that people make is racing too many cars before they've really learned how to run in iRacing -- stick with one car until you've really learned it and it'll pay dividends later on in your racing and you won't have to buy as much content)"
iRacing,39e485,BarnacleKB,3,Thu Jun 11 05:12:03 2015 UTC,"When you want to start virtual racing you'll soon run into a number of different things.    There is no sim out there with good graphics, good physics, good multiplayer and a good pricesetting   So you'll have to choose:   Simracing or Sim/arcade or Arcade (I assume you've chosen the first, but the driving experience is completely different compared to the last two, it can be a bit of a challenge at first) To oval or not to oval, Iracing is your only choice here in my opinion. Even if you've never seen an oval race, don't dismiss it, I started watching my first nascar race after joining iRacing and finding it extremely fun to do if you're somewhat lacking in the time department. Hotlapping: Go with Assetto Corsa, great tracks, good graphics, good car feel, horrible singleplayer racing due to lacking AI, mediocre multiplayer, at a good price Single player offline racing: Go with rFactor 2 or (Game) Stock Car Extreme, both have mediocre graphics, but great AI, also a broad spectrum of cars available at a reasonable price Multiplayer racing:  Iracing without a doubt, where I compare previous titles with other games, I compare iRacing to real world racing. This is the first title that makes get's me shouting after a winning a race or going after somebody who wrecked me without apologizing. It's closer to go-karting with some friends then it is to gaming.  Downside of iracing: price, I guess I spent around $800 on cars and tracks, this while the cars and tracks of rFactor or Assetto Corsa feel better for a tenth of that price. You can hotlap in iRacing, but having Assetto Corsa I see no reason to do so as it's an inferior experience.   In the end nothing beats the iRacing experience for me so it's worth the money. But it's highly dependent on the type of racer and person you are, I've got a job, I consider iRacing a hobby, so I spend a bit more. However if you're a kid with limited amount of funds, you might want to give those other titles a try, you'll get more bang for your buck"
iRacing,39e485,Eburon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:18:06 2015 UTC,"How it works -  You pay a subscription fee to race ( months or yearly and also look for promo codes to help save money.) when you first start you race as a rookie in oval, road or both. You will get a few cars and tracks with your subscription to help you get started. As you race more and more you will get a better license and then have to buy new cars and tracks.   As for racing, you race only against other people (no AI) and you mainly focus on your SR and IR (safety rating, I rating) Good clean racing will raise Your SR even if you finish in last and if you force youR way to a win with lots of contact you will lose SR. Your Irating is affected by your position at the end of the race and you need to focus on this to promote you license.   Seasons - every season last for 12 weeks and will feature a new track each week. Their is also a week 13 which is when they release new things to iRacing and allows you to test them out.  You can view each seasons racing schedule at anytime to see when and where they are racing. Some series will follow the real life series schedule ( nascar, indy car) and others don't. When you start racing a series you will earn points like in real life racing and at the end of the season you can see where you stand worldwide.   Their are also 2 types of car setups, the first one is a fixed setup where all the cars are the same and you can't adjust anything. You start off in these as a rookie and will continue on as you get better licenses.  The other is a open setup, with this setup you have a base setup and you must test and tune to get a better car setup for the track.   Finally is the different types or racing events. First is practice, as you can guess you just practice the track and SR and IR are not affected.  The second is time trial, during this race it is just you on the track racing to keep consecutive lap times. Your SR is affected in this, if you race 30 laps with no issue it goes up and if you wreck you will loose SR.  Next is qualifying, you don't have to qualify to race but you will start towards the rear of the pack. If you do quality you will be place towards the front with the qualifying pack ( I recommend doing this cause it will get you to the front at the start and avoid all the wrecks towards the rear.) You will only need to qualify once to count for the week event, you can qualify again if you want to get a better time. Last is the actual racing, it can be any where from 20 to 400 laps (depending on license) during the races you want to drive as clean as you can to get promoted (this is a bit hard to do as a rookie because others tend to try to hard and wreck alot) you just need to play it cool and you'll be fine.   I'm sure their is more to tell you but I think that is about all you need to know to get started. I personally have been IRacing for 5 years now and love it and have not been disappointed by it."

Let me explain, racing is very very hard. When I decide I will race in a week it's because I know I have at least 8 or so hours to practice on my own during the week not competing so I can do 3 or 4 races on the weekend. It takes a lot of effort and patients and enjoying racing and sitting in a simulator for hours at a time are not necessarily the same thing.  Consider buying the force gt wheel for $125 USD it is more then enough for starting out on and your not out $230 if you don't enjoy the game as much as you'd like."

Been playing games for a long, long, long time and have invested more in certain titles then $1000.   I don't plan on buying all the content at first, and I have a job so I am not worried about dropping money when I have to.   I am very much interested in the actual racing and tuning aspect of the sims, and have no real interest in crashes.   You guys should really take some of this and make a quick FAQ out of it for new players like me. Lots of awesome info here.   As an MMO player the subscription model actually seems reasonable compared to some of the games I have paid for."
iRacing,39e485,randomkontot,2,Thu Jun 11 11:53:51 2015 UTC,"You can't go wrong with iRacing then. Heart pounding, sweaty palms, deep breathing. That's what I get when being in a good position and having someone breath down my neck (or opposite). You really don't get that in Assetto Corsa (as an example) because there is nothing to gain from winning and nothing to gain from losing. Also, you're not likely to have many close battles in other games unless you find a league with a lot of people of similar skill compared to your own. iRacing does all that for you.  People might have explained this already, but in MMO terms your iRating and Safety Rating can be compared to your level in a MMORPG. You start at the bottom, being able to only run the rookie series (which if I remember correctly leaves you with a grand total of two cars for road racing). As you race along your safety rating will increase or decrease. Running off the track, hitting something (or someone) will incur incident points to your race. If you gain 17 you're disqualified, but anything up to that will still affect your safety rating negatively. Run a clean race without even leaving the track (1 incident point) will give you a high safety rating boost after the race. Have a crap race and crash someone (or get run into by someone; iRacing has a no-blame system so you'll get points even if it wasn't your fault) and your safety rating will decrease.  After a set interval your safety rating will cross the border where you either gain a license class (D -> C) or drop one. This can be seen as ""leveling up"" as increasing from D to C will allow you to run the Star Mazda car, which is quicker than the Spec Racer Ford or Skip Barber that you could run at D class.  The other aspect, which is the MOST IMPORTANT factor in how great iRacing is, is your iRating. Whereas safety rating only decides what cars you can run, iRating determines how good you are. You can have an A license and race F1 cars and still be very slow and have a very low iRating. You can have 16 incident points and get a serious blow to your SR, but if you finished first your iRating will still increase as much as it would if you finished with 0 incident points. Your iRating determines which playes you'll play with.  If you would start today and be put in a SoF race (strenght of field, the average iRating of all the racers on the grid) you would most likely both be a hazard to the other players as well as being left in the dust instantly. It's not fun. At the same time, having a really high iRating and being placed with people at 5-600 will mean you will leave everyone at the starting line and simply hotlap your way to victory. Also not fun. However, having started out and being at ~1000 iRating (or whatever you end up at) and being placed with OTHER people of the same skill level means they're as good as you are. They won't leave you in the dust, and they won't be moving chicanes for you. You get tight, fun, and most importantly exciting racing. It's hard to find that in another sim.  If the cost doesn't bother you (and it shouldn't if you're working), you can't get another sim until you start joining leagues. It's easy to pick up and play whenever you want to and it will almost always be a sufficient challenge when you do.  I don't think I've spent more than $150 USD over a year or so on iRacing and that's like.. A pizza per month. I can easily spare that money to get the adrenaline pumping once in a while.  EDIT: Man, I'm rambling. This became a lot longer than I was planning."

iRacing,39dar8,Hat_Experience,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:38:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the slow response. SoftTH is software that allows you to use several monitors in any configuration without having to have matching monitors as most (all?) software from video card manufacturer's require. All of the rendering is done with one card but you'll need a second to output to a third monitor should your card only have space for 2. You can use a really cheap card for this as it does no rendering. I am using 3 horribly mismatched monitors (22"" and 20"" 16:9, 19"" 4:3) as these are what I had available but they still function wonderfully considering I have hardly any money in the setup. My rig is pretty basic with an i5 2500k @ 4.6GHz, GTX 460 @ 820 MHz and 8 gigs of ram and I STILL get 60 fps (high would be nicer, of course) with enough eye candy on to enjoy the scenery running 3 screens. Like I said, its not perfect but its functional until a bigger budget is available.     Shaun Cole did an awesome overview for Inside Sim Racing that can show you how to set it up as well right here.  You can find the software and donate at SoftTH.net.  Feel free to ask if you have any more questions. I will answer to the best of my ability."

iRacing,39c0vq,Sasken,2,Wed Jun 10 19:44:05 2015 UTC,"It's good to point out though that the skippy has the most 'usual' schedule coming out of the rookies because of what Martin has set up (and it looks like it will continue for the foreseeable future).  For OP, with the skippy they have implemented a sort of 'track rotation' schedule where they try to maintain a bit of consistency on a three season cycle. Once a track is on the schedule you can be sure it will stay on the schedule for at least 3 seasons as well as they always have 3-4 free tracks every season. This means that you can run 'official' seasons (+8 weeks) multiple times without buying a lot of content every single season.  They also do a loose polling of the community to see which tracks they would like on every seasons schedule and it works well for them. I'll be interested to see next season if the community wants to go all out at the nurburgring GP or the nordschleife. Hopefully we start experimenting more with short track and alternate layouts.  Basically, outside of Rookies the skippy has the cheapest and most consistent schedule, just check out the forum... a user named Martin Peck has laid out everything in supreme order."

What ever the distance from the center line of your monitor to the center of your head is, is length 'r' (radius). Assuming your outside monitors will have their sides touching the inside monitor's sides, the distance from the center of your head to the center line of those monitors should be the length 'r'.  This should effectively provide you with a perpendicular (90 degree) angle from the center of your head to the monitor."

iRacing,397l5b,samwrocks,5,Tue Jun 9 21:15:31 2015 UTC,cannot stress this anymore
iRacing,397l5b,tomolart,13,Tue Jun 9 21:53:20 2015 UTC,"The thing you don't want to hear is the following. If you have a hard time getting your sr up, it's because you're not nearly safe enough or you don't practice enough.   First: don't start in the freakin pit, I don't know who thought it was a good idea to advise new players to start from the pit but it's not worth it, you only get lapped sooner or you catch up with really crap drivers who gathered at the back after the first couple of corners.  Always qualify: at least the faster cars behind you who didn't qualify have only themselves to blame for not getting passed you. And you won't have to bother with the majority of reckless drivers.  The only time you should start from the pits if you see your qualitime being WAY slower than the pack, and even then you really should be practicing in stead of racing.  And don't worry so much about it, things don't get better if you got promoted, you need more clean corners per incident to keep your S/R up, if you can't do it with slower cars in D you won't be able to do it with faster cars in C"
iRacing,397l5b,Eburon,2,Tue Jun 9 21:55:57 2015 UTC,The amount of incidents you can get away with while maintaining a D 3.00 is insane.  Keep practicing and you can fast track next season with little effort.
iRacing,397l5b,AR-47,2,Tue Jun 9 23:27:25 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, especially in my thought to give the Spec Racer a try so readily.  I'm mostly an Oval guy so the nuances of road racing are coming a bit more slowly, but I'd had a good 4 weeks in the Skippy and was hoping to be in the IndyCar oval and road series.  One of the tough parts for me has been the gaps between weeks where I own tracks for the Skippy, going a month without getting a single road race requires a bit of a brain reprogramming coming from the fixed oval.  I appreciate the advice.  I don't really have anything to lose with what I do the rest of the week so I might get some more practice in and give your suggestions a shot."
iRacing,397l5b,slobbishbodysfw,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:21:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely, if the SRF and SBRS are giving you troubles with just the SR, the DW12 is not where you want to be yet.  Give the Skippy another season, learn some more conventions, and actually race.  SR shouldn't be gamed, since it's actually a decent metric for how safe you are on the race track.  As you get better, it will get better, not the other way around.  So yeah.  Run races, start on the grid after you qualify, and learn really well how to race on the road.  You can't learn how to avoid situations if you never encounter them."
iRacing,397l5b,LastImmortalMan,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:19:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly! I can race the skippy pretty confidently, I can hold my own in the mid-pack of the top split and feel like I have great control with the car.  I've recently moved over to the indycar and oooh boy is it a different beast. I can just finally run consistent safe laps (slowly) and the learning curve is a lot higher (but a lot of fun).  The skippy is by far and away my favourite care for tight and close racing, if you have other skilled drivers around you it is a constant battle."
iRacing,397l5b,Urinat0r,4,Wed Jun 10 23:15:55 2015 UTC,There doesn't seem to be time trials this week... Can i get SR from qualifying?
iRacing,397l5b,4InchesOfury,2,Tue Jun 9 21:13:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, qualy is actually better for SR."
iRacing,397l5b,ProdigyInventor,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:30:33 2015 UTC,"So u don't have to race to gain sr, u can just qualify?"

iRacing,397l5b,4InchesOfury,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:06:41 2015 UTC,"For ovals it's a bit different since you can only do a limited amount of laps for qualifying. It did count, but probably not enough to make a difference to your SR."

The rookies and some D class guys don't understand that when the SRF kicks sideways you want to add throttle not brakes. So many spins, especially on lap one at lime rock. The last two races have had lap 1 crashes that took out at least 10 cars."

iRacing,397hix,bigbobnukes,2,Tue Jun 9 22:41:29 2015 UTC,Sounds quite unique to me.  In my opinion they seemed to have put a bit more audio depth into this car.  I think perhaps what you're picking up on is the whine of the straight cut gears.  Those do sound the same as every other race car.
iRacing,397hix,YNOTtheTIGER,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:31:13 2015 UTC,Certainly doesnt sound like the real life V12 monster it is.

I wouldn't be surprised if it was in fact a recording from the GT3 version and they just used it for the GT1 car.  Kind of how they keep using the same sounds for the V8SC despite both cars sounding completely different.   https://youtu.be/JVUvxLzn0hI?t=3m42s

There is a black painted ad on the wall going into turn one that I use to know when to let off, coast the car towards the bottom, and then get back on the gas just before the middle of the turn.  Going into 3 there is a white line painted across the surface, I start coasting maybe a car length or two before that line, and get back on the gas before the middle of the corner. In 3 & 4 especially you'll see the groove in the track, make sure to adjust your speed to stay in that groove or below it or else you'll smack the wall going into the quad oval section."

In the C car I never brake at any of the bigger tracks. You just have to keep momentum up. K&N car should be same thing for this size track
iRacing,396ap2,Swagdonkey400,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:38:56 2015 UTC,"Did a bit of truck racing today.  I barely brake in the trucks.  Honestly I'm faster without braking, but I'd rather lose a hundredth of a second every lap than screw up one lap and lose a second.  Less of a chance of screwing up.  A and K&N I brake a little more in.  Braking helps quite a bit in later laps with less tires."
iRacing,396ap2,AR-47,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:48:09 2015 UTC,Yeah in the tire model that just came out I think braking will actually be required a lot more. Just to get the front end to settle and have a good exit.
iRacing,396ap2,Swagdonkey400,2,Thu Jun 11 18:28:50 2015 UTC,"speed at ovals is all about time on throttle.  the sooner you can get back to the throttle, the more speed down the straights, and repeat.  the fast guys can perfectly balance speed into the corner, coast, and feed the throttle back gradually to get max speed by the next entry point."
iRacing,396ap2,ClarksonianPause,2,Tue Jun 9 17:43:36 2015 UTC,"That car lacks a lot of on power acceleration especially when it gets into the lower rev range. The trick to keep that car fast is to preserve momentum but not going so fast that you are sliding the tires or scrubbing speed. Typically you'll let off earlier so that you can get back to the gas faster.   Also, it seems like a quick lift and back to full throttle works you are actually costing a lot of speed as you are scrubbing tires. Try to gently get back into the throttle slowly as you go around the turn.   I haven't driven the set up yet but I'm usually back to full throttle by mid corner/apex but I get there slowly during the turn in transition."

The Rookie series are still available, to allow Rookies to accumulate any needed SR for promotion.  The rest of the series are not offered during this week, and there's a bunch of ""fun"" races instead. Most people don't take these races too seriously so the racing can be pretty chaotic.  Since iRacing is updating the application during every Week 13, there can be bugs and service interruption. So it's a good idea not to race this week unless you're prepared to lose SR and IR: the server could crash right in the middle of a race.  There's a big notice on the main iRacing page about Week 13. Of course right now you can't see it since they're updating."
iRacing,395zwl,EddieGrant,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:56:17 2015 UTC,"So rookie series are available to accumulate SR, but it's not a good time to race because you'd lose SR due to the servers.. catch-22 much? :P"

iRacing,395zwl,Sasken,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"It's a risk, definitely. It's basically a last-chance opportunity before the new season begins.   I recommend to everybody to get their MPR and SR before Week 13 and don't race any official races in Week 13 because a lot of drivers have kind of a ""holiday"" mentality during Week 13 and the racing can be ... iffy.  That being said, the Sporting Code is still in effect and you can still protest intentional wrecking. But it's safer to just avoid the risk."
iRacing,395zwl,EddieGrant,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"Alright, I only just signed up this week, so good to know. Any other hints for a rookie?"
iRacing,395zwl,Id10t3qu3,2,Tue Jun 9 20:20:13 2015 UTC,"There's conflicting views as to what you should do as a Rookie.  Some people say to start from the pitlane (wait the full 60 seconds until the grid button says ""missed start""  then enter the race by clicking that button).  This way, especially if you're not sure about your pace, especially on road races, you can drive for safety and not worry about incidents on the first few corners.  However, this doesn't totally prepare you for what rookie is about, which is learning how to predict where trouble is happening and react accordingly.  I'd say you're in some ways better off just racing, not going too crazy or anything, but actually mixing it up, taking your lumps, and get better at driving safe.    Iracing gives a quote sometimes, Races aren't won in the first corner, but they're often lost there.  Take that to heart and back off if someone is being aggressive, oval or road.  I've scored some solid finishes by letting folks go past when they have me and watching them wreck out laps later when they run into someone who won't yield."

iRacing,395mfn,awesome682v2,2,Tue Jun 9 14:17:56 2015 UTC,1.)Well I mainly do that because i dont have a three screen display and i've just gotten used to it.   2.) When I have recorded myself racing i try to not make the video longer than it needs to be with as much commentary as i can provide(which is little because im usually concentrating on the car) if i put the T.V prospective in it would make my video double what i would upload. ex if the race lasted 15 mins thats probably a 17-20 min video. that would take me to about 40 mins which is to long for most people and they think the race is that long  But this is just my Opinion.
iRacing,395mfn,awesome682v2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:48:41 2015 UTC,"Don't want to sound like I'm attacking you, but I want to respond point by point :P  1.) I'm not sure what having three screens has to do with it. I only have one, and I found it to feel much more immersive once I turned off the visual wheel. I don't think you could do it until you had your wheel calibrated just right though.  2.) I was, in my head anyway, thinking a separate video, not the two chained together. :)"
iRacing,395mfn,awesome682v2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:16:25 2015 UTC,i understand this. I mainly use my ingame wheel to make sure my wheel is working properly and i also use it becase i dont like being up on top of the car with the FOV the game suggests with my monitor. then i would see the point in takeing the wheel off.  as of the second point that is something i can consider as well as it seeming like a fun idea. ill have to record today and do that and see how it feels

iRacing,395mfn,tstraw48,6,Tue Jun 9 14:06:10 2015 UTC,Not liking the FOV is a matter of what you're used to. This is why a lot of video people out there use external gauges . ;) Takes a while to realize the monitor is a window not your face. Your face is your face :D

iRacing,395mfn,vmaxmuffin,2,Tue Jun 9 14:29:11 2015 UTC,"As a YouTuber you want to keep the steering wheel turned on so your audience can see your steering inputs.  Otherwise, for them, it's a less emursive experience.  When you're driving you just get used to it and you never even see the wheel.  However, when I drive the Ruf I have to turn off that gigantic wheel or else it will distract me.  My guess is that because the majority of people watching iRacing videos are themselves iRacers, therefore they want to watch what the driver is doing more so than a TV perspective.  A long time ago I got into the habit of including both in my videos.  Shameless YouTube plug to follow.

iRacing,395mfn,LUK3FAULK,3,Tue Jun 9 19:18:44 2015 UTC,Alt-K allows you to move all of the HUD elements.
iRacing,395mfn,nomnamless,3,Tue Jun 9 22:44:01 2015 UTC,That would be ALT+K to move the boxes around on the screen.
iRacing,395mfn,shadowofashadow,2,Tue Jun 9 23:51:08 2015 UTC,"it depends on personal preference i guess. people who dont use a proper fov can leave it turned on  since the wheel in the simrig isnt matching the scene in that case anyway. but people who set everything up correctly (fov and position) can gain immersion by turning it off. before using the rift i didnt use a proper fov since my 22"" single monitor setup wasnt perfect for it. it didnt add to the immersion to turn it off since i couldnt match position and fov i a way that it really felt right on such a small monitor behind my wheel. i tried a few times but i didnt feel it would work for me.  since using the rift i have it turned on in every case because it feels weird to sit ""inside"" a car without any wheel.   2.) Why do people never post TV 1 (2, 3) perspectives? It's much more fun to see what's happening behind and ahead of the driver (at least I think so) rather than directly from the drivers seat.   i personaly dont like videos form the outside perspective. i always like to see what the person was seeing when he was driving. it feels faster and sometimes it can be misleading to see the outside position when viewing. its more immersive for me as a viewer to watch a video form the drivers perspective because it makes it easier for me to understandt the decision the driver makes in different situations. i also feel like i can judge and learn way more from the lines the driver i am watching takes.   edit: since you have asked some others here about the rift. if you want you can ask me here too."
iRacing,395mfn,rancer890,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:28:54 2015 UTC,Hey what kind of PC do you need for Oculus? I feel like I'd rather invest in that instead of monitors...
iRacing,395mfn,MysticalMuffDiver,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:43:06 2015 UTC,oculus have recently released their recommended specs for the cv1 (which will be out in q1 2016). the recommended minimum hardware should be build around a gtx970 or 290x.   those can be found here: https://www.oculus.com/en-us/blog/the-rifts-recommended-spec-pc-sdk-0-6-released-and-mobile-vr-jam-voting/  i personally would advice to wait for the consumer version if you dont have additional money to burn. but thats easy to say as a dk2 owner ;-) i couldnt resist ordering the devkit last summer. but i can tell you that i will order the cv1 as soon as possible. i am now at around 140-150 races with the dk2 and i will never be able to go back to a monitor.

iRacing,393chs,Execrat0r,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:32:51 2015 UTC,You could alt-tab and withdraw from practice while you were still in it and then register for something else.  The only problem was that it didn't give you a timer for when the race starts like if you're in a test session.
iRacing,393chs,notinabasement,13,Tue Jun 9 22:34:04 2015 UTC,"Here are the release notes for tomorrow's release.  Website:   Ultimate Pay is no longer available as a payment method. All viewable future sessions are only viewable up to a specific view date range. Fixed a bug where uploading setups for a fixed Hosted Session with specific foreign characters could interfere with parsing. Fixed the Firefox no-data bug. Added an ""Accept"" button to the league ignored requests page to allow the admins to ""unignore"" and accept the request. When clicking ""I'm still here"" on the hosted sessions page after the timeout, the sessions will refresh properly. Opting out of league PMs and Emails now works as intended. Making edits to a team that hasn't been assigned a team ID should now properly fully create the team. A button to launch the graphics config has been added to the settings panel. Fixed a link where IE users were having trouble when revoking team invites. Fixed a bug where selecting to drive certain cars in a team multi-car hosted session could cause errors. Popular races now have an additional filter to show sessions using only the content that the user owns. The Cars, Tracks, and Tech Tracks pages are redone with filters. Fixed a bug where, under specific conditions, the race planner could bug out and not show sessions.   Registering for Race sessions will place you into an Open Practice while waiting   For many series, if you register for a Race session more than a couple minutes prior to the session's scheduled start time, you will be automatically placed into an Open Practice session. This way you can get onto track, instead of waiting for the Race session to launch. Note that the splits for your Race session will not yet have been formed. So there's no guarantee that the other drivers you see in your Open Practice will be in your split. In fact, some of the drivers in the Open Practice might have registered for it directly, and won't be transferring to your Race session at all.   The simulation will notify you when your Race session is ready, and present a green [Race!] button on the Session screen. Clicking on this button will disconnect you from the Open Practice session, and connect you to your Race session. Only then can you tell with whom you have been grouped. If you do not click on the [Race!] button, the simulation will automatically switch you over to your Race session shortly prior to when you must grid your car for the race, or sooner if the Race session also has an embedded Qualify session.  Simulation:  Updater   When you run the iRacingUpdater it will ask you to install the Microsoft Visual C redistributions for x86 and x64, if you don't already have them installed on your computer.   Auto-Config   Added a drop-down to the auto-config dialog to choose which display adapter to use. It attempts to recommend NVidia/AMD cards over Intel to help with laptops.   Networking   Change how the simulation configures its network connection to the race server. This might reduce the possibility of ""error occurred on network device"" messages, and disconnections from the race server.   Race Points Given Field Size   We improved the calculation of race points awarded so small field sizes don't hand out too many championship points. This also reduces the advantage of high iRating fields in awarding championship points.   Logitech ARX   We now support Logitech's ARX interface. ARX is a simple communication layer provided by Logitech that allows communication between an application on the PC and your Android or iOS based device. It basically allows us to act as a web server sending pages to your phone, along with a simple bidirectional communication channel so we can push live data to the phone and receive inputs back. For further information and details on how to use or create something for ARX, please go to this forum thread: http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3316230.page   Graphics   Improved frame rates with a more dynamic adjustment of detail levels when many cars are on screen. We are beginning to convert some of our cars and tracks to using physically based rendering (PBR) shaders to give more accurate looking cars and tracks. In this release the new Five Flags Speedway track uses these new shaders, as do the new Aston Martin DBR9 GT1, and the updated Chevrolet Corvette C6.R GT1 and updated Legends Ford '34 Coupe.   Race Control   Show the driver the amount of time they still have to yield in order to clear their ""gained time by shortcutting, slow-down"" furled black flag. Fixed a bug where sometimes incident report messages would incorrectly say there is a limit of 17 incidents. During qualifying at medium, long and superspeedway ovals, doing a burnout no longer gives an advantage.   Split Times   Add in an option to load split time files from other drivers and cars for you to compare yourself against. The ghost car now lights up the brake lights.   UI   Added the C (CPU) meter to the L/Q/S/P group on the Session screen. The CPU meter is only displayed if you have manually enabled it in the ""XXX Dev Use Only"" section of app.ini.   Triple Screen   Fixed a bug where headlights could draw with strange artifacting problems when the field of view is greater than 170 degrees. Fixed a bug that broke mouse driving when using triple screens.   Telemetry   New live telemetry outputs CarsPosition, CarsClassPosition, PlayerCarPosition, PlayerCarClassPosition, CarIdxPosition, CarIdxClassPosition, CarIdxTime, LapLastNLapSeq, LapLastNLapTime, LapBestNLapLap, LapBestNLapTime, DCLapStatus, DCDriversSoFar.   Sharing Setups   When you share a setup from the Garage, all different types of car that should be able to load your setup can now actually see and load your setup (for instance, the two V8 Supercars, or the NASCARs).   New Tire Model   Dave has a new model of the tire carcass that does a much more accurate computation of the tire's stiffnesses. Amongst other things tires now respond much more correctly to tire pressure changes. This is what is called a ""Version 6"" tire. Most of our road course cars have been updated with this.   Chassis Torsion   We can now model the fact that a car's chassis can twist due to forces and torques acting on the car. But only a few of our cars have been updated with this so far.   Weather   Reduced wild wind direction swings.   Cars:   Added new sponsor logos for Pep Boys, People Against Distracted Driving (PADD), iAnalyze Racing, and Max Papis Innovations (MPI). Revised Club Scandinavia logo.   Aston Martin DBR9 GT1   Now available for purchase. Will be classed with the Chevrolet Corvette C6.R GT1.

iRacing,393chs,HerpDerpenberg,3,Tue Jun 9 12:27:35 2015 UTC,GT1 begins!  GT3 rebalance!  So many good changes!  I wonder how they modelled the chassis twisting? Surely every car's chassis has a different amount of stiffness to it?   I imagine it will make transient manoeuvres (especially over bumps/dips) feel a bit more weird.
iRacing,393chs,WhyDoISuckAtW2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:52:05 2015 UTC,"Actually should make it fee less weird tbh. Get rid of the ""pogo"" effect"

iRacing,393chs,seaweeduk,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:50:35 2015 UTC,Woo!
iRacing,393chs,arsenicfox,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:31:46 2015 UTC,"Or would it just depend on the setup/chassis? Surely the twisting would absorb some of the torque being applied to the car, but the chassis wants to return to its normal state, and if it is twisting back but the tires/dampers have settled into their chassis-twisted state, you'd feel it wobble a bit?  I don't know, I'm just guessing. I can't imagine the twisting is very great (for most cars?). Then again it's probably fairly fast acting anyway."
iRacing,393chs,WhyDoISuckAtW2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:30:36 2015 UTC,"It should feel normal. A car is actually like that. Basically imagine driving a wooden box on wheels. That's essentially what we're driving now. Now obviously the springs and dampers handle things, but those still act upon the chassis. This should add a bit of ""expansion"" upon the chassis flex. A good example would be what rF2 has. :)"

Right now, that's there reason for not supporting anything but rotation. [Also mind that most wheels are super weak. This is a 21Nm force wheel. A G27 only outputs a max of 2.5ish  That's about 1/10th. And it has to compress all the highs and lows into that, so I don't really blame iRacing for that when i think about that the lowest force wheel in iracing is about 12Nm... lol.   They do go for absolute realism. Which goes for force feedback. Don't want to ruin the experience for people with $2000+ wheels. Wouldn't blame em."

Even if it does save a bit of cash, it saves you nothing if you end up using less than 100% of the tracks you bought at once.    I would buy a track if I wanted to run it that week.  That way I'd immediately feel my money's worth in learning and racing the track.  It's easier to justify the cost since you get immediate entertainment value for the money."

iRacing,390d8w,DeathHaze420,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:34:20 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't really know how the ""season"" works.. In Rookie I just joined races at Lime Park whenever I had time, and felt like it. There were races every hour.   Is that how the season works as well?

iRacing,390d8w,AR-47,2,Mon Jun 8 23:52:50 2015 UTC,"No, not quite.  Seasons last 12 weeks, usually, you will need to participate in a certain amount of races per week. It is usually best to participate in races that will have a high strength of field (this will help to increase your iRating and match you with drivers at your skill level) You will also earn championship points for your division. If you do more than say 5 races in a week, only your best 4 results will be counted towards the championship, more info here: http://faq.iracing.com/category.php?id=3  You can check the iRacing forums for the series you want to race in to see when the best SoF (Strength of Field) races are. They are mostly on Saturday's and Sunday's around/after 13:00 GMT.  If you apply for a race session and there are only say 4 drivers, this would not be counted as an official race and you wont receive any championship points. Depending on the track a certain number of drivers need to sign up for the race to become official.  If you participate in 8 weeks of the 12 week season you can earn credits which can total $10US."

iRacing,38x5k4,tommy44vercetti,8,Sun Jun 7 16:29:40 2015 UTC,The updates you downloaded are so that you can race against those cars even though you haven't purchased them.

iRacing,38waq9,thirdhonk,5,Sun Jun 7 10:58:08 2015 UTC,"I doubt we will get soft body physics but as someone else mentioned we should be getting an improved damage model soon which should hopefully add some cool features.  The reason I don't think we will ever get soft body physics (keep in mind this is merely my speculation) is because if I recall correctly it takes quite a bit of processing to handle everything going on, and considering that not everyone on iracing has a great pc that may cause issues. I can only imagine what a huge wreck would be like."
iRacing,38waq9,Pfunk39,6,Sun Jun 7 13:44:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a computational mathematician that works on racing simulations, not for games but for engineering, and this kind of thing is really hard to implement realtime with current computer technology.  Most games use very simple contact interactions and don't use arbitrarily deformable objects for a good reason, it's very computationally expensive.   I think we will have simple 'undeformed' and maybe a few different fixed 'deformed' models in gaming for a very long time.  Computers simply aren't capable of doing these calculations quickly enough right now in addition to doing all the other calculations to run the base simulation.  From the few videos I've watched either BeamNG slows time when computations can't keep up with realtime display, or the player is slowing time for effect, but I really think it's the former."
iRacing,38waq9,dirtyuncleron69,4,Sun Jun 7 14:24:38 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, but the physics seen there are still a long way from running on top of iracing with decent graphics, tire models, and framerate.  Deformable models would be amazing to have in gaming, but there's a reason it's not widespread right now"
iRacing,38waq9,dirtyuncleron69,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:31:03 2015 UTC,It's only realtime until you have too many segments being simulated at once. Works fine for a vehicle or three... but I've heard by 8 vehicles it starts chugging. Can't get 60 cars at Spa using soft body physics.
iRacing,38waq9,Bakkster,2,Sun Jun 7 14:43:30 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty ok with the damage model. It would be nice to have more since bad wrecks aren't very realistic at this point. The damage happens, but it isn't shown. The actual crash physics for hard wrecks needs to be updated badly, and it would be nice for visual representation, but not necessary."
iRacing,38waq9,doveenigma13,2,Mon Jun 8 16:15:41 2015 UTC,"From what I see from beamNG, there's one, maybe 2 cars in each picture. So we probably will have issues scaling this to 40-60 cars.   Apart from that, iracing needs to send all the data when people pile up to every client. They need to make sure that each client is synced ( we don't want people on the back crashing into phantom debris or trunk), keeping in mind that not everyone has a gigabit internet connection, there's packet loss and different latencies.  Obviously every car would have to be rebuilt from the ground up to support the new model. There would have to be extensive remodeling so you can actually see what's under the side panels you just ripped off, drastically increasing the hardware requirements for the game. (And no, you can't just take a CAD model and dump it into a game and expect it will work)   Even if they spend years perfecting all these issues, (the cones you can bounce around is an early test to see how debris can be synced) they probably have way more important thing to take care of, like perfecting their tire model or driving model. They would have to spend all this money and time to have prettier crashes that barely change their core gameplay . (Not saying that a game about smacking cars into each other isn't fun, but it's not iracing)"

iRacing,38waq9,euronate,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:44:28 2015 UTC,It's supposed to be included in the DX11 update whenever that happens.  It will include pieces of debris falling off of cars after contact and 'a better damage model' according to iRacing.
iRacing,38waq9,shelbs187,5,Sun Jun 7 11:03:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, that'd be the one. In all honesty I think it's more important for the damage model to realistically (and consistently) affect the car physically, rather than visual effects, nice as those would be."

iRacing,38u2vw,someoneinsane,2,Sat Jun 6 22:51:51 2015 UTC,"No problems!    Brake Bias: I haven't used this in the DW12 (since it's only for Road and so far I've only raced in the Fixed Series), but a lot in GT3. Brake Bias just helps with the balance of the car when you use up a lot of fuel and your braking points change a bit because the car is lighter.  Fuel Map: Just an oval setting to help save fuel during cautions (or save fuel in general). Not very important to me so it's set away from my wheel (which should have your important functions during a race). Front/Rear ARB: Probably one of the more important things on IndyCar oval racing. The two left red buttons are used together to reduce understeer/push and the two right red buttons are used together to reduce oversteer/loose.    Do understand that you can't change anything in Indy Oval Fixed."

Have you guys at iracing updated the sounds engine? The downshift and overrun noises sound better. No new sound engine.   Day and Night transition in this build? Day and Night transitions are due after DX11 is implemented.   Why was RUF Cup fixed? Tony explained in the forums why the RUF Cup is fixed, we'll keep an open mind to bring back OPEN in the future.   Any graphical changes this build? Yes on graphical changes, switching to a new lighting system, debuting with the Aston Martin, new Legends, and the Corvette so far. It’s a physical based rendering system.   Why release the GT1 Aston first? We released the GT1 Aston first because the Corvette is quite lonely by itself.   Is graphics even a top priority? Graphics is definitely a priority, currently working on how physics affects graphics, aka the physical-based rendering system. Also working on a new particle system.   What changes are made to the V6 Tire Model? New V6 Tire Model changes: driveability, tire degradation, and vehicle response.   I would like to know if the future of iRacing is to please the masses of gamers... Or if it's to create the most realistic and immersive form of racing. So many companies are making moves in their development to ensure they are reaching the masses, They have become more worried about the money than creating their original goal. My fear is that iRacing may cater to the masses rather than creating year after year, a more REALISTIC and IMMERSIVE racing experience... Many can't afford a race car and all that is involved , and iRacing is the next best thing. I don't want a game , I want a racing simulation. What outlook does iracing have in 2015 and moving forward? The latter, we want to achieve the most realistic form of racing possible.   When Will the New Surface Model be released? New Surface model to be released by the end of the year.   Any news on the Nurburgring? Nurburgring is coming along on schedule, shooting for a Fall release date. The GP and Nordschelife will be $14.95 each. (regular price) If you own both, you can also drive the combined for no extra charge   Have you got any plans at all to finish Long Beach? Yes we plan to finish Long Beach   When will we get the Mercedes AMG GT3? Mercedes due next year, we're already working on it   Which layout will we be getting for the Combined Nurburgring, VLN/24hr, or the Full GP and Nordscheleife (like Forza)? We haven't determined the final layouts yet, but will try to provide as many as we can   What ever happened to the a new Daytona Prototype? Daytona Prototype is in development, one of the next two cars to come out.   MP4-30 coming this year? We're trying to get the MP4-30 out this year.   Is the camry going to be an update to the exsisting car or a whole new car? The new Camry is a free update, will replace the old car   DX11 still on pace for the end of this year? Working on it, trying to get DX11 out by end of the year.   What about the 2 Other missing Aston Martins? It depends on what Astons we get car data for.   How is the F1 car coming along? 3D modeling is underway, physics guys started on the new engine for the new F1 car.   Tony said about plans probably being part of this year Simracing Expo? Any news about this? Would be so cool so see Tony and Crew again   We're going to the Sim Expo again this year!   Any plans to update the Indycar damage/repair model to where the rear wing assembly is replaceable in full? We're working on an all new damage model for all cars   Do you have any plans for updating Oculus Rift support with the new optimised SDK? We'll get to it, yes   What about other BMWs? You said that there are 4 licences. No new BMWs planned in the short term, working with other manufacturers   Any news on the re scans of pocono and michigan and when we might get them? No news on that, sorry.   Have you thought about rain implementation someday? We've thought about rain, yes   When should we be expecting a new tire model on the Gen6 Cup cars? Shooting for September build for Gen6 v6 tire model   What’s the lowdown on these new Legends? This new Legends car has been graphically rebuilt from the ground up, with the new physics based rendering format   Is the new Legends car free? Yes, the new Legends car is free, will replace the old one.   Anything on the new MX5? We'll be building the new MX5 soon, and yes it will be free.   Any updates upcoming to Star Mazda or Legends sounds? Star Mazda, Skip Barber, and HPD all have new engine sounds in this build, and we did some tweaking to the Mazda.   Will the new Camry be free? The new Camry is free if you own it already.   Are you planning on more GT1 cars by any chance? We'll see how popular the new GT1 series becomes. The Corvette is getting the new PBR lighting model as well.   When will the build be released? Shooting for Tuesday 10AM for this new build.   Any news on an xfinity camry? Xfinity camry is coming…   Will we get day-night transitions before 2016 when the endurance WC series starts? We aim to deliver Day-Night transitions after DX11.   Can we please have a Euro-acceptable NIS Open time? Like 7pm GMT or something? - Asked on behalf of everyone in Europe with kids!!

iRacing,38sffm,Noofnoof,3,Sat Jun 6 12:25:33 2015 UTC,"Some things I'm finding interesting:  It looks like they're putting their development time towards things that:   1) are in a high demand, and  2) will have big impacts on the simulation, without taking too long to implement  I think this is why we get the funny answer about rain. When you think about simulating rain accurately, it's not just ""water #mm thick on the track, therefore coefficient of friction is reduced by X"". Real water on tracks have different puddle depths, affect different paved surfaces differently, have really weird effects when drying/getting wetter, and not to mention the tire treads which complicate all of these things. The amount of time needed to accurately model water is bonkers. Better that time spent on something else for now.  DX11 will likely give the game quite a different look. With day-night transitions being done after DX11, I think it's safe to say shadows and lights sources will look much better in DX11 than they do now.  The Ring won't be cheap for the whole thing, but it's possible some series just won't ever race a particular version of the track. For example, you can imagine IMSA running the full course layout, while rookie MX5 may only ever do the GP layout. It's definitely in high demand, though, so I wouldn't be surprised if there was a promo code for it in the future, perhaps even a few months down the line if they wanted to get all the kinks out first. Same with the DB9.  Similarly with Long Beach, the time spent to model the city for the track is perhaps better spent on tracks with higher demand - likely why we're seeing the Ring being finished before LB, even though work on LB started ages ago. LB may not be a popular road course when finished, and there aren't thousands of people complaining about not having LB in iRacing like there are for the Ring.  More cars: a lot of the time on the forums, you see iRacing staff commenting that they would love to model more cars, but car owners aren't letting the developers have the car to model it!. If you or someone you know owns a race car and you want to see it in the game, get them to reach out to iRacing staff!  Damage model, road surface changes (marbling, temperature): can't wait for this! It'll really spice things up for longer races. Imagine purposely changing your line for a few corners because part of the track has changed! If only we could pull a Bathurst and pause the race to re-pave turn 2!"

iRacing,38pl8t,arsenicfox,3,Fri Jun 5 19:36:55 2015 UTC,"The thread contain information in the form of responses from David Tucker of the iRacing staff involving an issue with the FFB in iRacing.  Post #1   I have spent many happy hours driving over every kind of curb I can find, and as many rumble stripes as I can safely hit at various speeds and I can say that in my experience (limited to a few street cars) is that it is highly unpredictable whether or not a curb is going to move your wheel and in general you don't feel anything (in the wheel*) at all, and rumble strips never have an impact on your wheel.  Now on the freeway you always get a violent jerk when getting onto rumble strips because (at least around here) there is a graduated road surface that steps down right before or after the rumble strip. And of course rumble strips telegraph a vibration to your wheel but that does not result in a rotation of the wheel and for now all we send to the wheel is rotation (since that is all the motor can achieve). I can say that the rumble strip force is fed to the tires so it is having an impact, just not the one you were expecting.  There is probably some value in translating vibrations and bumps into rotations of the wheel so you can recapture some of that feel you get from a real car (the non rotating feel) however most wheels do a poor job of reproducing high frequency data (like vibrations) so there is little to be gained by doing this. And it would not be technically correct, even if it did feel nice. Products like SimVibe are a great way to add in the missing buzz in your hand in a more correct way.   They also went on to speak about their older tracks in this one, about how their older tracks are not that great with rumble strips, and how they've gotten better with it. Also asked that people tell them about issues with strips rather than whining about it."
iRacing,38pl8t,bwfluv,3,Fri Jun 5 19:52:01 2015 UTC,"As for why the grass is so lively compared to the curbs, the reason is that all 4 tires are getting hit with different bumps in the grass and that is causing the front wheels to jerk side to side. Also the grass is really modeled as a bumpy piece of asphalt with lower grip. In real life the ground is like a sponge, deforming under your tires, but we don't currently model that (or we would already have dirt racing finished )   In my neighborhood we have beveled curbing that angle out at about 40 degrees from the road. I drive over those curbs as often as I can (when my wife is not with me ) and It always surprises me that they don't just kick the tires back towards the road. Occasionally they will but I can't figure out the circumstance that causes motion in the wheel.   The same goes for speed bumps, I take them at angles some times and it is very unpredictable when they will turn the wheel and when they wont. They always bang me around but I can usually drive over them using only two fingers on the wheel without needing to correct my inputs."
iRacing,38pl8t,Eburon,2,Sat Jun 6 02:30:48 2015 UTC,Updating this with quotes and info [WIP - Gimme 10 minutes]  Will update with information on FFB settings when I get home at around 5-5:30.
iRacing,38pl8t,Eburon,2,Fri Jun 5 19:37:16 2015 UTC,"The next post talked about wheels.   ... You have to realize that some wheels, like the G27 output 1/10th the force of a real car. We scale up the forces with a non linear compressor but that does not quite boost the small forces by a factor of 2 or so you are still miles away from where you need to be.   The CSWv2 [Fanatec] outputs a peak of 7 Nm or about half what a production car can output and 1/4 to 1/8 of what a F1 car can do. You have to get up to the AccuForce before you hit real life force levels and to cover all cars (half the cars?) you need to go even farther than that.  As others have put it already, driving with a properly sized wheel gives you incredible detail that is lacking in most of the other titles. My hope is as time goes on the wheel makers will catch up to us and start producing more high torque wheels for lower cost. We do our best to accommodate the weak wheels, but we can only take it so far before we ruin it for everyone.   Found this interesting as he does point out later that the G27 outputs at around 2.5Nm. The weakest car in iRacing (the SRF?) is able to max at around 11Nm."
iRacing,38pl8t,Eburon,2,Fri Jun 5 19:56:30 2015 UTC,"Responding to a comment curbs affecting drivability and how they prevent people from using them IRL, and that a high volume rumble might fix it. That person started their post off as ""The problem is, IRL curbs influence your racing line"":   The thing is in real life you feel the harsh curb in your body, along with taps against the wall and bumping fenders and bottoming out and many other things that our members do on a daily basis without thinking twice about. The cure is to give everyone a motion platform that will hurt them when they do something silly, but that is probably never going to happen. [IM SO DISAPPOINTED]  I have thought many times about adding in our own simple base shaker logic that would drive one shaker through the LFE channel (sub woofer) so you could either feel the rumble when you smack into a wall or your shaker could vibrate you. I have avoided this for several reasons. [Modified this to make it easier to read] * Don't want to cut into anyone's market * I don't have lots of free time to address this * We don't have much control over the LFE channel with our current sound API.  * But it's on the list! ... ... I have often wondered if something like the g-seat would give you that sensation of vertical motion that tells you your in the air now, without the cost and craziness of a full motion platform.   I cut a few lines out of this one. Most of it is discussing how no simulation can give you that ""gut wrenching sensation of bouncing off of a curb at 200mph."" And how most people use that gut."
iRacing,38pl8t,Eburon,2,Fri Jun 5 20:07:22 2015 UTC,"Thread Part whatever  Yes, I think that would be the case. I expect at some point in the future that higher quality wheels will come with a base shaker or other actuator mounted on them to replicate bumps. Fanatec has vibratory motors in the rim of there GT3 wheel and I have often thought about driving them through physics. Part of what holds me back is that they don't really do a good job of 'thumping' you, they vibrate at a high frequency with little control over there intensity, so you can't really replicate the one off bangs from hitting a curb or bottoming out. Something with more punch to it that could also reproduce subtle vibrations would be better. And of course something that is more universal than just one or two wheels would be nice as well.   Another idea I have thought a lot about is if your body can tell the direction of the bumps, so if you mounted a shaker horizontally and vertically on the bottom of your chair, could you feel a difference. If we had three independent axis with which to produce bumps, and you could distinguish each form the other then we could replicate all the high frequency sensations you feel in a car, which in my mind are more important than the low frequency surges and tilts that a motion platform reproduces.   Anyway we have come a long way in the past 10 years but there is still a long way to go in recreating a truly immersive environment. I'm hopeful that new ideas will continue to come into the market and allow more realism for all of us.  Thread part whatever 2   David, you say the torque at the wheel hardly changed, but that is a relative and objective statement.It looks like the curb had about a 5Nm impulse. 5Nm appears to be roughly 10% of total range of steering forces seen. While not huge I think that is significant and would certainly be noticeable from the wheel. I think it is one of those things that is not major and the idea people have that the wheel should attempt to jolt 90* is not correct, but if the effect was implemented properly a ton off immersion would be added.   Whatever you see on the plot is what was actually sent to the wheel. I did not take much time to analyze it because it does not seem to line up well with the actual impulse from the bump. Anyway 5 Nm out of 30 nm scaled down to 2.5 Nm at the wheel results in a force of only 0.4 Nm or basically the equivalent of picking up a small bag of chips."
iRacing,38pl8t,Eburon,2,Sat Jun 6 02:34:59 2015 UTC,tldr?
iRacing,38pl8t,maneaserban,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:32:17 2015 UTC,"Taken from David Tucker:  Well your wheel is a good one for the price, but it does fall squarely at the bottom of the list of wheels that actually work. There are lesser wheels but they tend to have very poor force feedback that can't accurately reproduce what we ask. With that said it is more than sufficient to be competitive, just not good enough to be truly immersive.   There are several settings that we provide to help the weaker wheels along. I will try to summarize them for you here and hopefully that will help you out a bit.    Min force: some wheels, like the g27 have intentionally deadened there response to small forces in order to reduce oscillations. Min force just adds the min force amount to all forces sent to the wheel so that the force seen at the wheel is large enough to overcome this 'dead zone'. It is a bit more complicated than that but not much. If you set this too low the wheel feels lifeless over small bumps, but too high and it tends to rattle around when driving straight.  Non linear: this attempts to boost small forces at the expense of larger forces in order to make the smaller forces more noticeable. Imagine that you had a 7 Nm wheel on a 14 Nm car, in that case the non linear curve would be attempting to make the smaller forces realistic while sacrificing some of the fidelity of the larger forces that could not be realistically replicated anyway. On a 2.4 Nm wheel like the g27 that is a steep hill to climb but still it helps a bit. This will amplify any oscillation that the min force slider introduces, so it is important to not set min force too high while using the non linear option. However they are complementary and can be used together.  Damping: don't bother this is not realistic. I left it in because it has always been there and people seem to like it.  app.ini [Force Feedback] steeringDampingMaxPercent=0.1: this is an alternative to the damping slider that simulates a friction effect. This can add weight to wheels like the g27 giving them a more solid feel and making things less rattly. I really like it, but it does nothing to improve our force feedback, just makes your $200 wheel feel like a $400 wheel.  app.ini [Force Feedback] steeringFFBSmooth=1.0: setting this to 0.5 or 0.25 or 0.2 in order to smooth out the rattles in the force feedback. The smaller the number the smoother it gets, and the more latency you introduce. This is really only needed if you drive a car that has a bad case of the rattles because of a physics bug.  Force: this is the main slider you want to mess with and the only one you should tune on a per car basis. Min force sets the lower end of the force range, and this sets the upper limit. You want to set that limit as low as you can (higher on the slider) without running out of room and clipping.    Finally on the weaker wheels, many drivers adopt a different grip on the wheel, some go so far as to only hold the wheel with a single finger and thumb. The tighter you grip the wheel, the less sensitive your hands are to force and the less you can feel."

iRacing,38okgn,anamericandude,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:30:24 2015 UTC,"For the Corvette C6R GT1: for upshifts, just press shift. From first gear to second without traction control and turning the wheel HEAPS, the rear end doesn't really kick out from the shift. It does kick out from the stupid amounts of low end torque and being in a low gear, however.  For downshifts, you don't need to use the clutch. A blip of about 10-15% on throttle will kick it down while holding your downshift button. So it's not like you need to mash the throttle. If you don't blip, the revs need to get really low for it to downshift on its own without a clutch.  The cars have lots of torque, wide tires, a good chunk of downforce, and a fair bit of weight - at least that's how they feel to drive. No ABS, but you pretty much floor the brake pedal when braking from a long straight, and then slowly release the brake as you turn in, and get ready to use the throttle to help rotate the car at the apex/turn-out.  For comparison sake, I would say the vette drives like the cadillac but with much bigger balls and wider stance.  They are more difficult to drive than GT3, but not like Lotus 79 difficult. The basic concepts for handling are still there, you just need to be a bit more cautious with pedal inputs in GT1."

Controllers are a piss poor way to drive a car. A majority of these people would be using them though.  Console players want something easy to jump into. Some might want a real simulation, but if they do they should just grab a steam box when those come out.   There are SEVERAL other things they should be working on first. Like the New Surface Model.

I don't think it's very likely - I'm no expert, but the whole subscription-based, regularly updated service approach seems at odds with the console 'buy it once and that's that' way. Having said that, as consoles become more and more like mini PCs with 'proper' internet connection, downloaded patches seemingly common, and even similar inside bits, perhaps it's more plausible than it seems. I don't see that it would have much of an impact on the average PC player if it were to happen.   What this question always throws up is this slightly rabid 'PC Master Race' madness, with certain folks leaping to the defense of their PC-exclusive game as if it's under threat somehow. How anyone can honestly say things like ""console gamers won't understand x"" or ""the physics of [sim] will be too hard for console gamers"", I'll never know - as if 'console gamer' is the name for a particularly low IQ level, rather than a term for someone who sits in front of a slightly different box of electronics. I haven't owned a console since the PS2 but I know enough to be pretty confident that the current generation has plenty of grunt for iRacing (though perhaps AC will lose a bit of polish graphically compared to high-end PCs). I can't believe for a second that there's not enough of a market to warrant to release of a 'proper' sim on a console, and the argument that anyone who really wants to play one should 'just get a PC' is hilarious.  Finally, consider this: there's a constant stream of new users on /r/simracing posting up new threads saying things like ""I've been playing Forza/GT but then I heard about iRacing, AC, etc. - which should I get?"" The fact that the Forza and GT series are so successful is not necessarily an indication that they are as much 'sim' as a console gamer wants/can handle - couldn't it just mean that that's the best they have right now?

So don't run the exact same line through the corners, try to catch some wind, preferably on the left side of the car, if he's hugging the aprin take a wider line.  Also never lift, and that's a tip for many many out there, drag your brake to bleed off speed, keep your throttle all the way down. Same for other fast tracks.   And a key thing in Indy: tire management, you can hug the inside and keep everything closed as the pole, but you WILL run out of tires and end up in the wall or see people fly past you in the last few laps.   6th gear on Texas only needed when drafting."

I believe the reason in the gen 6 cars to tap the brake was something about torque in the engine but I don't think that applies due to the high downforce aspect of IndyCar. I'd be interested in seeing the advantage if there is one but I've never seen it. I will continue lifting for now.

I guess if you keep your car clean and run consistent, clean, ""let everyone who's driving like crazy by"" races, you can improve your SR, sure."

iRacing,38gv05,brasspanels,4,Thu Jun 4 03:03:49 2015 UTC,"As a rookie: f**k all the other rookies out there now.  If you crashed out of the race quit instead of throwing donuts and crashing other drivers.    I have been racing about a week and a half now, and I fear I will never get out of Rookie.  I am really careful, I don't care what place I finish in, I let other racers have as much room as humanly possible; other people wreck though and I guess I suck at avoiding.  How one can be asked to avoid 10+ accidents is beyond me though."
iRacing,38gv05,Furiou5,6,Thu Jun 4 03:29:45 2015 UTC,"When I was in Rookies (not that long ago - 9 months?) I remember it being bad, but not that bad. I wonder if it's got worse since? I had some really good races at USA International. Maybe because of my timezone (Australia) I was being placed mainly with more dedicated people from abroad and/or other Australians/Kiwis? I don't really remember it being full of us downunderers but IDK.  The real trick to rookies is accident avoidence. You get good at avoiding wrecks (or at least I did). Qualify up front if you can and try and race away from the pack with other fast people, that generally worked for me. I don't believe in starting from the pits because it kinda defeats the purpose of rookies - you're supposed to learn accident avoidence - although if you are qualified at the back of the field then it's usually not a bad idea.  Also /u/brasspanels turn off the virtual racing line, if you use it you learn to rely on it - which is not a good thing. It's usually not the fastest way around either."

iRacing,38gv05,tmoitie,3,Thu Jun 4 12:21:19 2015 UTC,"How to get out of rookie:   Do Charlotte weeks only. Don't grid, start from the pit and be prepared to wind your way through a few T1 wrecks. Don't follow cars too close, and watch ahead for any potential wrecks. The moment you see smoke ahead or a car start to spin, get off the gas. Start trying to predict where the spinning cars are going to go and plan a route through. Only once you're full through a wreck do you get back onto the gas. If a car is approaching to pass you, go high, let them through, lift off to allow them to pass as quickly as possible, then get into their draft and prepare to avoid their wreck.   In the lowest splits this'll get you into the top 5 easily too.  Edit: I got out of rookies about 4 years ago. I've signed up for a free 3 month account and I'm gonna attempt to do it again. Wish me luck!"

I was never damaged enough to warrant even a pit, but was still DQed.    At this point I am realizing that I am 33(fuck birthdays at some point ok), and I don't have the time to play games with people borrowing credit cards from their mom's in order to do something I like.

iRacing,38gv05,SuperZapp,2,Thu Jun 4 23:37:15 2015 UTC,"As a former rookie, practice the tracks, especially @ USA. If you do race, coz who doesn't want the thrill of testing your mad skillz, then start from the pits to avoid the main pack and if you are going to be overtaken, move to the high side and stick there until clear. The people overtaking you will be gratefull. Once you are confident, have decent lap times and race skills are there, start on the grid.   To get to a position where you are winning in rookies, improve your iRating to get to the top split (where the experience and generally cleaner drivers are) and also qualify. Once you get pole, you can usually win the race, otherwise you will have to wait for a crash or mistake in front of you as overtaking is difficult and usually the pole sitter is skilled enough to defend their position.  I am a road racer, but dabble in ovals for fun and seem to win a lot of them using the above strategy now."
iRacing,38gv05,Alibambam,2,Thu Jun 4 05:11:47 2015 UTC,Sometimes I wish you could still drive as a C/B/A class in rookie stock. I love doing crash avoidance
iRacing,38gv05,bobfuse,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:52:46 2015 UTC,"The only thing I had to do was Qualify in the top few and all was good except for a few races, clearly accidents when running full throttle around Charlotte (I've never ever had a problem on USA, just dont try win in the 1st half of the race, you will pass people by the end). People tend to run right next to one another on that track in SS simply because the car has like no power. You literally have no room for mistakes. And people will call you out for stupid things, like a guy had me pinned inside on the tri-oval bit (front straight at charlotte), the guy in front let off a little so he didn't spin on the grass, I went slightly right, and let off to avoid him, half a car width if that, instead of going into the grass and spinning, the guy on my outside was on my door barely leaving enough room for my car between the grass and him, I pushed him right a bit and he slid, could not save it, attacked me because it was my fault he wrecked, mind you he/we also took out 4th - 10th on lap 5/20... My point is just give people room, I races NiS @ Charlotte recently too, no problems going side by side, 3 wide sometimes without trouble, because everyone knows 1 crash = 20mins in the pits and a slow car.  Whatever you do but, whatever position you are in, DO NOT GIVE UP THE INSIDE LINE. As soon as the guy in front of you goes wide enough get inside him go for it, but putting your front spoiler next to his back spoiler doesn't give you right for position.  Main point : everyone knows 1 crash = 20mins in the pits and a slow car at higher licenses. So people aren't be so stupid."

iRacing,38b7n1,paranoidguywithafake,7,Wed Jun 3 02:18:00 2015 UTC,"If I'm correct (I may be wrong!), SR is determined by how many turns you take sucessfully compared to how many incidents you earn.  Longer races mean more turns total, meaning incidents take less SR away."
iRacing,38b7n1,Dirt_Track_Racer,3,Wed Jun 3 03:17:51 2015 UTC,"Nope! That's how it works.  Longer races in faster cars also lets you turn more corners in the same amount of time.  The trick is you have to be a better driver to still build your iR while in the faster cars, and they're generally more difficult to keep on the track.  That being said, SR is a sham. There are countless sub 1000 iR drivers with A4.xx ratings. You can build your SR by: going super slow in a race and not going off track; watching netflix and doing time trials; constantly running slow Q times.  SR comes and goes like the tide, if you drive well, it'll rise.  iR on the other hand is a tricky beast :D. You have to be better than the other drivers on the track at the time to get it."
iRacing,38b7n1,nonothing,3,Wed Jun 3 14:47:39 2015 UTC,"The higher class races tend to be longer.   Also there's the NASCAR iracing series which is C on up, full or half length races.  The Blancpain races are a decent length if you prefer to turn right."
iRacing,38b7n1,emersonlakeandlagoon,2,Wed Jun 3 02:22:25 2015 UTC,"You don't have to do anything for SR, just drive cleanly. A long race just has more corners.

I'm currently racing in Xfinity class B fixed, and have raced for a couple of weeks on C trucks and National Impala in D. Some tracks are really demanding in throttle / steering aspect. And quickly degrading tyres do not help in keeping the same line / speed throughout the whole race, so don't be fooled by easy full-throttle Charlotte in Stock Cars!  As for your question, I went National Impala in D, then C fixed trucks and now Xfinity in B (also fixed), and enjoyed (almost) every minute so far. See you on track."

I have also tried USA Intl Speedway in the stock car, and I found it quite hard to get fast times consistently. What I meant is that, for the most part, minor mistakes like running wide will not cost you the race. Sure, you lose some time, maybe a few positions, but in comparison hitting grass in the SRF will most likely result in a spin and a very close and brutal encounter with the wall."
iRacing,387qui,ironweed,2,Tue Jun 2 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"I would say that oval racing is all about minor mistakes that cost you whole race :D Field on road spreads quicker (not always) and catching some grass while running wide can result in spin, but often you just lose a second, or maybe not.

iRacing,387qui,vmaxmuffin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:38:43 2015 UTC,Yeah. The only full throttle tracks with the more powerful stock cars are the superspeedways (Daytona/Talladega) but then of course you'll have to learn all about bump drafting. :p
iRacing,387qui,easy22,2,Wed Jun 3 10:46:31 2015 UTC,"I'll also recommend the DW12 for fun racing on ovals. It's hectic and often work up a sweat just from the intensity of the racing. If you prefer the stock car route, the Xfinity car is my favourite. I find that because it's generally not as loose as the trucks and not as powerful as the Cup car, it often produces good racing. Plus the races are longer than the truck series and with fewer wrecks.  Edit: thought I'd add I used to be like you. Now I not only love oval racing in iRacing, but I also watch the IndyCar Series religiously (used to not bother with ovals because I found it boring) and I also watch most NASCAR races. I guess I appreciate where the difficulty in the racing aspect comes from now, whereas before I couldn't see it."

Always look to see what you can do differently to avoid these type issues and your average finish will improve. Once I stopped laying blame on other drivers and started looking at what I did and what I needed to do differently to avoid the issue. My results really improved.
iRacing,387rl9,24-Fan,0,Thu Jun 4 13:50:56 2015 UTC,"Both.    The 3 car didn't need to be that close and the 4 shouldn't be forcing people up the track when they have a run. Contact was made after the 4 started coming back up the track and the 3 had the overlap. It's clear the 4 knew the 3 had a run as he stayed low through the tri-oval.  The 4 didn't give the 3 a lane on the top even if they didn't make the contact earlier as he carried on coming up the track.  All could have been prevented if the 4 held the low line and the 3 had left a bit of a gap.   To all of those blaming the 3, you are wrong, watch it again and slow the video down, no accident is 100% one drivers fault.  On a further note, turn your racing line off, you'll learn nothing by using it.  Edit: No surprise for this subreddit that I get downvoted for being right."

The steering wheel is for turning the car, it's not something to hold on to for balance.  Practice holding yourself in your seat with your body's core, and maintain a feather-light grip on the wheel.   The only way you'll get over it is with practice. Run some time trials or practices and work on moving the contracted muscles from your arms to your body."

You already see why it's happening so all you can do is fix it by reminding yourself to relax your wheel grip while you drive. It plagued me for quite a while but I've managed to get pretty good at it now. I do 3hr endurance road races in the blancpain series (driving all 3 hrs solo) and seldom have the problem any more. If I do get it, it's brief and gone within a few hours of the race. You might also reduce the level of FFB force you use. I keep my wheel very light now and that's probably a big part of how I've eliminated the issue."

iRacing,385kge,anon2413,2,Tue Jun 2 11:30:15 2015 UTC,"As others have said, D class cars aren't used much above D, but some people spend years driving them and never feel the need to drive higher licence series'. In particular, the Skippy's have a loyal following and is the most populated road outside GT3.  One thing that could potentially save you some money is skipping a licence level. You can skip a licence level by advancing to a high enough SR then getting your MPR in the next licence level up. It works like this: Say you are class D, you do your normal class D races, get enough SR and get a C licence. Then keep going in your D class series until you get a SR of C 4.0. You can now race in B licence events. After 4 of those, you will get a full B licence without ever doing a C class race.  For existing accounts, there are 3 ways to save. 1) Buy content in bulk to get volume discounts. 2) several times a year (maybe 3 or 4) you can buy $25 or $100 credit for $20 or $75. 3) At least once a year you can get half price subscriptions for $50/year.  You can also earn up to $10 a season ($40 a year) by completing full seasons in a few different series. Time trials don't count for credits.  I spent quite a bit in my first year of iRacing, but now I have most of the road content I generally only buy a new track or car a few times a year (maybe 4-6) as they are released, and with the half price membership it comes out pretty good value (to me!).  You can spend as much as you like! I used to race in one race a week, a broadcasted SOF race. I'd spend 3 nights driving 1-3 hours per night beforehand preparing and qualifying. But lots of people will practice for an hour then race multiple times in a week. I can't do that, I feel too underprepared and hate not maximising my potential. Now I know the tracks and cars better it takes me less time, but especially at the start expect to spend a couple of hours getting up to speed at a track. (Sticking with one car for a while helps a lot with this.)"

iRacing,385kge,Sasken,4,Tue Jun 2 13:04:06 2015 UTC,"""Are most of the early purchases also useful for later?"" - there are only so many tracks. Most tracks are used in multiple series. So in most cases you will use a track at least a couple of times a year. Cars, on the other hand - it's not uncommon to buy a car, use it for a series, then never use it again. Or buy it, hate it, and never use it again.   ""How much stuff can you get for free/cheap with promo-codes?"" - not very much. You get some free content when you join. Most promo codes are aimed at new users only. The main promo code for existing users is a half-off membership offer that comes twice a year usually. That means the annual subscription is about $50/year. There are also discounts if you buy content in bulk and once you own a certain amount of content.  ""How much time do you spend?"" - depends what you want to do. I probably practice an hour to an hour and a half a day. And I usually race 2 or 3 times a week. That's on the road side. I dunno what oval guys do.  ""What is the cheapest way to get a subscription?"" - there's currently a free 1-month (or 3-month? I'm not sure) offer. Then the half-price deal comes at least twice a year. There's no reason to pay more than $50/year for a subscription if you pay attention."

I have all the road courses and have raced on all of them, but make sure you buy them only as you need and min lots of 6 to get the discount.

iRacing,385kge,arsenicfox,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:45:06 2015 UTC,"In terms of time cost:  If you're going to avoid Oval racing, you'll probably want to spend a lot more time practicing before races. Road courses are just harder in general and you'll want to spend more time learning each corner of each track. There's ""learning"" a track and then there's really learning it where you aren't making mistakes, and as you're beginning it can be hard to know when you're ready to race.   I would suggest a good ""qualifier"" for race preparedness is being able to complete a time trial - in order to do that, you'll need to complete a set number of laps in succession without off track points or accidents. The number of laps is dependant on how fast the car is you're driving and how long the track is. So a long track with a slow car would ask you to complete the lowest number of consecutive laps, and vice versa.  This is also a good (but slow) way to increase your safety rating as if you complete the session with zero accident points, you can typically bump your safety rating by .04 or .05 each time.   Monetary Cost: I would suggest the skip barber as a purchase for sure and maybe the Spec Racer Ford if you're feeling flush. DONT buy cars you can't race yet unless you can really afford it. As was mentioned, you might end up hating one of them.  the Skippy is really fun once you get the hang of it. Watch youtube videos to understand the limits of car control and shifting, and then you'll get the hang of it over time.  Tracks: many of the formula 1 tracks are popular across series, and many of the new tracks are popular across series with the exception of Circuit of the Americas due to the fact that it's as technical as fuck and not many people enjoy it for that reason. I personally think they need to apply a bit less slippery of a surface, as I find myself inexplicably spinning out in some of the low speed corners where downforce isn't helping you.   Popular pay tracks that run across many series right now: Donnington Park, National Autodromo Monza, Autodromo San Carlos Pace (Brazil), Spa, Daytona, Road America, Road Atlanta"

I would suggest going to the centripedal circuit. OR if you really can't stand that go to a REALLY heavy braking track like Montreal or Monza with a huge long straight - Monza is actually amazing for learning braking.   BUT don't just run the track - instead, pick a brake marker (try 250 at Monza) and just practice applying the brakes right at the 250 marker and trying to slow down in the shortest distance possible, get a feel for the different ABS numbers    I usually have mine cranked up between 9 and 11 (I run the RUF)  and just practice practice. also practice some more. make sure you're modulating the brakes with your foot to experiment with what the car does under that weight transition"

iRacing,384k40,KillerInYourCloset,0,Tue Jun 2 12:08:36 2015 UTC,If you were a very high speed- say 180mph and wanted maximum braking you should be able to hit 100%. At low speeds you should lock the wheels at about 80%
iRacing,384k40,JordanCothran,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:29:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed, for me the rule of thumb is how much downforce is on the car at the moment you want to hit the brakes.  This goes for cars with and without abs.  If there's a lot of downforce on the car because you're going very fast, lay into the brake pedal initially and then lift off the brake as it slows and downforce is removed.  Slowly lifting off the brake will rotate the car into the turn too, so you kill two birds with one stone.  Want it to rotate more, let off of the brake more, want it to rotate less, let off the brake less.  The way I like to drive a perfect brake and turn in will have you releasing the brake right at the edge of the tires' adhesion and the same lift off the brake should be rotating the car into the turn perfectly so you hit the apex.  It's like hitting a baseball right on the sweet spot of the bat, so satisfying."

Also the Skippy guys use a rotation system where they use paid tracks 3 seasons in a row, so if you plan on driving this car for a few seasons you should have a look at the rotation in the forum so you don't have to buy 6 tracks again next season."
iRacing,382mgq,Hemiltonne,2,Mon Jun 1 14:43:59 2015 UTC,"I did, that's why I bought Oran Park iirc. I just didnt think that I'd still be lacking so many tracks for next season.

iRacing,383ssk,brasspanels,2,Mon Jun 1 17:28:56 2015 UTC,Get off the bottom of the track along the straight! This is seriously the most frustrating line I watch people run on this track. You burn off speed coming out of turn two by holding inside tight and you have a poor entry into turn 3 where you lose more speed. I've caught up to packs by running the proper line while they're drafting each other.

iRacing,382kvc,Hallaghan,6,Mon Jun 1 12:00:30 2015 UTC,"First, concentrate on getting around the lap without spinning. Be smooth and slight with your controls. You shouldn't be jamming the gas/brakes, and you shouldn't be throwing the steering wheel around (yet). Identify the corners you're having trouble with and take them slower than you know you can just to get round.  Once you're confident about keeping the car in form, start to experiment with faster lines/speeds. Try out iSpeed for comparing your gearing/brake points/turn in with the insanely fast laps.  Don't get wound up if you're 5s+ off the fastest pace. Once you've got the car into compliance you'll find you can catch up pretty quickly, but don't get impatient.   A few other tips:   When you're spinning in all corners in Mazdas you're steering too much for the speed of the car. If you can't reduce your steering angle and make the corner, slow the car down a bit more. Experiment with different turn ins and concentrate on hitting the right apex. Plan the gear for each corner. Of the tracks I'm relatively competitive on I have the gear memorised for every corner. If you're not using auto blip you'll need to blip on downshifts in the Mazda/Caddi or you'll spin the tyres & that easily causes spinouts. Once you're not spinning too much get into online practices. Following cars & being followed will make you faster.   Edit: Also, Laguna Seca is hard. Turn 2 is difficult, turn 5 spins me out all the time, the corkscrew is brutal and the turn after is tricky to get the hang of. You may be better off with Lime Rock Park which the Mazda cup is running next week (starting in 8 hours)."
iRacing,382kvc,tmoitie,5,Mon Jun 1 12:56:08 2015 UTC,"I think the big take away is to be as smooth as possible on all inputs and learning to manage throttle while under braking. Learning how to release the brakes on corner entry was the biggest speed improvements for me because maximizing the corner speeds is really where I find my time (at least in the skippy).  Honestly one of the greatest things for me has been upgrading hardware, I know guys are fast on older setups and with single monitors but moving to triples allowed me to have much much more confidence in my driving and I see at least a 2 second increase in pace when I use triple monitors, so that is something to think about.  As a rookie the biggest problem I had, and the one I see the most, is people over driving the cars. It is nice to compare yourself to fast drivers but they are driving on the limit and as a rookie you just can't do that. I can't count how many times I raced all weekend and hit a wall and could not progress or improve my times... with a day break and coming back at it with a fresh attitude I can usually consistently increase my pace while it seems like I am going slower because I would minimize the total required input per lap, being smooth really is king."

iRacing,382kvc,speedkinduci,3,Mon Jun 1 12:44:13 2015 UTC,"First and foremost head to the forums and make sure your wheel settings/field of view and graphics settings etc are all setup correctly.   Once thats done, i'd say the only real tip is to practice and learn. don't be afraid to use the driving aids, braking markers etc especially if you are new to a track.   Remember a race distance in the cars mentioned i'm guessing is around 15 laps in length so make that your goal to do 15 laps without a spin. Don't worry about how fast you are going, just concentrate on consistent lines and over time the speed will come.   Also if you are new to iRacing safety rating is more important than being quick if you wish to progress beyond the rookies."
iRacing,382kvc,shadowofashadow,3,Mon Jun 1 13:03:06 2015 UTC,"I know some people won't like this but even consider racing until you feel totally comfortable and can run at least a race length number of laps without going off track.  A lot of people like to just jump in online but you're just asking for trouble if you do that. You have to run a lot of laps on the track you're going to race on in the same car because you need to be consistent. Anyone can hit a fast hot lap but if you can only manage 2 laps without spinning you're not race ready.  Biggest tip for getting race ready is to watch some replays of fast laps. Get an idea for the line you need to take and then copy it, slowly going faster and faster."
iRacing,382kvc,LastImmortalMan,2,Mon Jun 1 13:08:32 2015 UTC,"@shadowofashadow, thanks for the tip but don't worry about that. I know I'm far from being ready to race yet, I'd just be in the way and it wouldn't be good for no one to have me there in such conditions.  For now I'm really focusing on just driving in test mode to learn because I'm really bad atm :D"
iRacing,382kvc,RileyF1,2,Mon Jun 1 13:17:02 2015 UTC,"Don't forget to ghost race actual events to give yourself some confidence, it really helps because you can get behind the leaders and see which lines they take and how they battle each other (and different lines they take in those battles). Watch how they deal with back markers or get around cars that are obvciously slower, watch the mind games and the 'tricks' that they do to try and position the cars around them. Good drivers can manage the track around them and make other drivers (usually) do what they want them to do.  Join online practice sessions, don't be affraid to be slow there or to get into accidents, you'll learn more about drafting and how to avoid collisions in practice, try to run at least 100 laps at speed before getting into a race!   Good luck, when you can I would move on to the skippys because they skills you learn there are invaluable to the entire service!"
iRacing,382kvc,chimpyman,2,Mon Jun 1 15:37:28 2015 UTC,"Just don't worry about how quick you are at first, because fast people will completely demoralize you at first.

iRacing,380xl8,Mike2g,3,Mon Jun 1 01:16:40 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind I qualified 7th overall when you read this, so my standards are a little extreme. :)  Friday night I came in 5th in top split after I became a sandwich with the outside wall and got sidepod damage which slowed my car down by a tenth while racing the leader. Luckily I could hang in the draft and pulled out a top 5 on air.  Yesterday night I came in 2nd in top split after battling Scott McLaughlin (New Zealand V8 SuperTourer Series driver in real life) for a good number of laps but lost when I was banking off of Scott being lap or so short on gas and instead a caution came out with four to go. I couldn't get the run out of 3 and 4 on the one lap shootout on worn tires.  All in all it was a success but I was so wishing for a win this weekend.

iRacing,37xyo0,cuntalist,8,Sun May 31 09:38:55 2015 UTC,"I made pretty much the same transition as you (G25 to CSR Elite Pedals) and all I can say is it takes time to get used to it. It is better, and you will end up being faster and/or more consistent, but it does take time.   If there's anything in particular you're having trouble with (any particular situations) let me know. Otherwise, the only general thing I can think to say other than just to keep doing laps is to think about how a load cell works. In a real car (particularly in race cars without power brakes, but it still applies in road cars to a lesser extent), the amount of force with which you push on the pedal with your foot is translated, through hydraulics, to force on the brakes, which effectively is a force pushing against the motion of the car. So the force from your leg is proportional to the stopping force of the car. So if you want to stop gently, just press lightly on the pedal (in racing terms, this is usually when you're trail braking into a corner or if you're just trying to settle the car before a fast corner). If you want to stop hard, push hard. Don't think about the angle/position of your foot at all (as you do with a potentiometer pedal)."

iRacing,37xyo0,YNOTtheTIGER,2,Sun May 31 16:28:08 2015 UTC,"As Vmax says, you can rest assured that a load-cell based brake is definitely a superior input method. It does take a bit of getting used to. I have the G27 pedals, custom mounted, but I modified my brake with an APElectrix load cell. It took me the better part of a week to feel quite confident with the new input, but it became quickly apparent how much better it is using pressure rather than distance of travel to operate the brakes. Give it time and you will get used to it. Also remember that you can calibrate it to use whatever amount of pressure you wish. I always set mine to a level where I need a firm push to get full braking but not as hard as is possible, because I like a medium weight pedal or so."

He can't make a pass on the outside on L1, it's a LONG race.  That being said, I'm all for giving positions earlier, especially to an aggressive driver.  I thought that yellow car was going to cause something :D"
iRacing,37ui1r,djfil007,4,Sat May 30 16:45:00 2015 UTC,Justin Kiebler is annoying as shit.
iRacing,37ui1r,jjhassert,3,Sat May 30 20:13:48 2015 UTC,clean move on your part.. just unfortunate that they didn't get the notice that you were there in time.  or maybe you were distracted with all that clutter on your screen... damn that's a busy HUD (or is it only seen on your stream?)
iRacing,37urtb,anamericandude,7,Sat May 30 15:54:18 2015 UTC,"Report him for blocking. The end incident is debatable though, I imagine."
iRacing,37urtb,cuntalist,2,Sat May 30 16:37:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, I am new to iRacing, havent done a race yet or anything. But why is Blocking illegal?"
iRacing,37urtb,KindSadist,3,Sun May 31 02:26:02 2015 UTC,Blocking is essentially using your mirror to see where the person behind you is going and weaving in front on them.  It's a very dangerous move that often results in both drivers getting their race ruined.
iRacing,37urtb,MyNameIsTrue,4,Sun May 31 02:43:34 2015 UTC,"Yes he was blocking, but you rear-ended him at the end. That puts you at fault. He is an obstacle in your path, and you should have known that he was going to block you again, and braked earlier to avoid it. There was no overtake opportunity there, IMO. No point in protesting it as you'll only get the default response of ""accidents happen"" and ""we will contact the driver to let them know they are under observation"", when in fact they do nothing."

iRacing,37urtb,someoneinsane,5,Sat May 30 16:31:48 2015 UTC,"In my opinion? It probably is blocking. He seems to keep taking unconventional lines to hold you back. The first time it just seems to take a very defensive line, which is ok. But later on he it seems he's moving from his racing line to interrupt yours, and that's textbook blocking.   I can only imagine how annoyed you were during this."
iRacing,37urtb,Speedly,2,Sat May 30 16:41:10 2015 UTC,"It's blocking. That incident though was all you, he just took a defensive line on the inside, and you pretty much dive bombed him. It's perfectly fine to brake earlier than normal if you're taking the inside line, as your minimum apex speed has to be lower than normal."
iRacing,37urtb,awesome682v2,1 point,Sun May 31 05:36:11 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely report for blocking. iRacing is the end authority for this kind of thing, and it's not like you have a completely baseless claim.  Worst case scenario is that they say it was a racing incident. You kinda don't have anything to lose by reporting it, so I would say give it a shot."
iRacing,37urtb,True_Racer,0,Sat May 30 20:33:21 2015 UTC,in my opinion its technically blocking. but after the first defensive move it looked like he was running his line. In most series your aloud to make one defensive move
iRacing,37urtb,jrebs,-17,Mon Jun 1 02:05:28 2015 UTC,Using the driving line automatically  puts you at fault

iRacing,37urtb,True_Racer,5,Sat May 30 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of using it, but it can be good when you have absolutely no idea what the track layout is. You shouldn't use it in race but rather to practice on your own with a baseline driving line so that you can go from there and develop your own. Ignore that other guy, who's just trying to be a jerk about assists."
iRacing,37urtb,arsenicfox,1 point,Sat May 30 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"I am typing this in the nicest voice possibly imaginable:  ""Practice"" and ""learning your braking points"" need to come well before registering for a race."
iRacing,37urtb,Speedly,0,Fri Jun 5 02:19:09 2015 UTC,"Let me clarify, me using the braking line as a reference for my brake points during Spa was my choice because I felt much more comfortable using that than using a reference off the the side of the track.    I had plenty of practice before racing and was perfectly comfortable going more than a race distance without incident.  I used the driving line because it gave me a much easier visual aid to reference for my brake points.  I don't see why this is so much different than using a marker on the side of the track but apparently it is.  I'd say I appreciate the advice, but I didn't post this to get unsolicited advice.  If I knew it was going sucha  big deal I would have just disabled the driving line before recording the replay."

iRacing,37x5r7,ClarksonianPause,6,Sun May 31 16:50:07 2015 UTC,"The reason why you hate the rookie class is because you're trying to be competitive instead of safe.  Iracing doesn't care if you win the race, they care that you brought things back in one piece.   The only way that you will get promoted is to put your ego on the shelf, and race cleanly - even if that means finishing dead last."

iRacing,37x5r7,Monkaaay,2,Sun May 31 17:03:12 2015 UTC,"It's natural to take a dip in IR when you're new. I did the same. Eventually, if you're safe you'll also be fast since crashed cars rarely win races."

iRacing,37x5r7,ThunderSevn,8,Sun May 31 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"So at the very start, I think you shouldn't have dove in there like that. Too aggressive, in my opinion. There was barely room and you plunged in there. Not sure what you were expecting by doing that. When you two touched on the front stretch you should have been lower as well.  He was following the right line, the low car needs to be nearly on the grass on those two minor bends. At the end, he should have given you a lot more room because you had the line. But honestly, given the prior two altercations, I wouldn't have been giving you a whole lot either.  So all in all, yeah, it's rookies for everyone."
iRacing,37x5r7,519meshif,3,Sun May 31 03:55:29 2015 UTC,"Part of being a good driver is knowing when to safely overtake another car. Poking your nose in down low like that, in Rookies of all classes, is a recipe for disaster."

Usually a throughput error is something on your end or somewhere in between and out of their control. Trust me, I had my own series of issues with that and I bitched to iRacing about it and they gave me a list of things to try and lo and behold a router firmware upgrade completely got rid of the issue. It also seems that there may be some ISPs (allegedly it's quite common in europe) who do some sort of connection reset on all their clients at some time in the early morning hours. I was made aware of this because I race a lot of endurance sim racing and in the Spirit of VLN series last year we had a few races where a lot of drivers had throughput drops. Like 6 or 7 or more drivers dropping almost simultaneously in the same race. It was eventually shown that these guys were all from the same region and the drop occurred at the top of an hour and someone claimed to have learned that this was some sort of ISP reset for clients who hadn't reset in the past X (probably 24) hours. It was suggested that a router reset before a long race would prevent this from happening since the ISP would see that you have a fresh lease.  It's annoying shit I know, but I watched three separate indy500 races on streams and so no notable connectivity issues going on (just major bad driving issues)."
iRacing,37t60y,jrebs,2,Sat May 30 05:26:27 2015 UTC,"I will reset my router before the next one, but I don't think it has anything to do with being in Europe. The other guy that got dropped is based in New York. And apparently a guy from Carolina got dropped as well."
iRacing,37t60y,jrebs,3,Sat May 30 10:06:27 2015 UTC,"Well, there were well over 600 drivers in the event, so it's not sounding like a big server-side issue to me."

iRacing,37t60y,arsenicfox,1 point,Sat May 30 10:47:42 2015 UTC,"Throughput errors are often the work of your own internet, sadly. It can depend on your ISP, how much bandwidth you're using (which is why Skype is stupid for gaming as it's pretty unoptimized high bandwidth usage, I wish ya'll would realize this and use teamspeak instead) and, again, can vary on the time of day and if your ISP, or even more notable, the connections between your House, your ISP, and the route from your ISP to iRacing.  I remember one time an entire part of the country couldn't get on our DayZ server cause the route was causing a loopback. Wouldn't connect to our server. Had to wait for the reroute which can take a few days due to DNS changes. Fun times."
iRacing,37t60y,True_Racer,1 point,Sat May 30 14:30:38 2015 UTC,"DNS has nothing to do with routing.  ""Re-routes"" that take a couple days indicate that it wasn't a ""re-route"" but a primary node being dead in the pathway almost on top of either the origin or destination. Anything in the middle dropping would be a re-route in a matter of seconds (60-75 seconds, to be specific) and it is 100% automatic, no human intervention required. The only time a person is needed is if your ISP is either two guys in a garage, or if the failure occurs within the datacenter of your server host or within two ""hops"" from your CPE at the origin.  There's a ton of misinformation in this thread about how internet works, so just to be clear with this: The internet is not a series of tubes. It is not black magic. It's fine to take guesses at how the internet works but unless you understand basic routing then don't give authoritarian statements."

iRacing,37pn19,lukeatron,-2,Fri May 29 18:05:37 2015 UTC,"Lol for thinking that's anywhere close to the startup procedure of the current generation of F1 cars.  They are insanely complicated machines.  It takes a team of engineers and a truck load of equipment to get one of those engines from cold to running without destroying it.  I really would love to have that simulated, but even then, it would have pretty limited replay value.  Given how much work it would be to do, it hardly seems worth it."
iRacing,37pn19,mav3r1ck92691,1 point,Fri May 29 18:12:42 2015 UTC,"No, starting it is about that simple...  before starting it they need to pump heated oil into it, because the engine would seize otherwise.  But an engine is an engine...  It is still a normal combustion engine (well the cars are hybrids now), just a really really really high performance one with really tight tolerances."
iRacing,37pn19,lukeatron,-1,Fri May 29 18:15:41 2015 UTC,"There's a whole series of starts, stops, revs and holds to get the different parts of the engine to heat up evenly.  Once they've got some heat into the metal, it's a lot easier to restart.  Even after that, there's quite a lot to manage with the power units.  It really comes down to how much they want to simulate.  My feelings is you either do all of it or it's just a game."
iRacing,37pn19,mav3r1ck92691,8,Fri May 29 18:25:25 2015 UTC,"Most of this is not done by the driver...  Since you brought up realistic flight sims (which I am heavily into), think about the stuff that the ground crew is required to do that is not modeled in.  Look at DCS: A-10C.  Do I have to remove all of the ""remove before flight"" tags?  Do I have to load ordinance?  Do I have to pull chalks?  Do I have to remove weapon safeties?  Do I have to enable the battery externally before starting it internally?  Do I have to connect and disconnect ground power?  The answer to all of the above is no.  It does have a very complicated startup, but it is an attack aircraft with multiple weapons systems, twin turbine engines, quad redundant control systems, an internal navigation system, fly by wire flight controls, etc.... It is not a car, with an internal combustion engine...  I mean, this is a racing sim, not ""Pit Crew Simulator 2015."""
iRacing,37pn19,lukeatron,-3,Fri May 29 18:47:33 2015 UTC,That's fair but the drivers are very busy in the cockpit none the less.  It is a car with an internal combustion engine and then a whole bunch more.  It seems to have calmed down a bit but last year when these cars were new a lot of the drivers were actually complaining about how much work they had to do that had nothing to do with driving.  These are guys that were driving what were already very complex cars the year before and they were still saying the current cars were vastly more complex.  As a fan of that type thing I'm sure you see the value in having all of those details simulated but you have to admit it's a fairly niche interest.  I think most people wouldn't have the patience for it.

The Blancpain GT Series is one of the premier motorsports series at the moment, and with F1 becoming increasingly less interesting, Im not that surprised. Every big sports car company has a GT3 car now, and continues to develop new models all the time. Its a good thing for GT racing I think.  I can see how people arent huge fans of it in terms of iRacing, though. Mid-split Blancpain races arent exactly known for the racing quality (which is a product of how relatively easy it is to be OK fast, and how popular the series is). But its also a very entertaining series with a lot of awesome cars.

iRacing,37pn19,mav3r1ck92691,1 point,Fri May 29 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"Well when you buy the Ruf you get all 4 versions.  You would race the Ruf Track in GT3.    If driven properly, the McLaren CAN be the fastest, but it is not going to be unless you hit every corner on every lap perfectly.  The Ruf and the BMW are about even in the right hands.  The BMW is more stable, but the Ruf has the acceleration."

The fastest of the fast times are often set in the McLaren rather than the others, but its a very different story in a race-length situation (it has quite a few issues that the other cars dont have to think about as much), and as such is also generally seen as the most difficult car to drive.  The cars are balanced in terms of performance, but they have different characteristics and issues to deal with. The McLaren isnt really much harder to drive than the others, but its harder to do the same kinds of times that the other cars are doing during a race because of the mechanical issues it currently has."

We'd get the slow down penalty, but it would clear itself almost immediately.    We didn't do it except to avoid traffic since I'm sure someone would protest our last place cheating."
iRacing,37qn7a,ManNotHamburger,1 point,Fri May 29 20:42:33 2015 UTC,"There are quite a few places in GT3 cars where you can cut the track and ignore the black flag because of the upcoming sector is pretty slow. You can for example cut the first chicane at Zolder and the black flag will be dropped somewhere before the back straight.  What happens if you cross the finish line on the last lap with a black flag? Ive always wondered, but never taken the chance to try it out (contrary to what it sounds like, I dont cut the track intentionally :P)"
iRacing,37qn7a,InZomnia365,1 point,Sat May 30 02:12:46 2015 UTC,My friend actually found this out last race.  If you finish with a black flag the time is added to your final race time.  So he went from 5th to 6th cause of the penalty.
iRacing,37qn7a,rspeedyr,1 point,Sat May 30 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting... So that time that he got added (although Im guessing its not a static time) is probably what is going to show for us with the update, then."
iRacing,37qn7a,InZomnia365,5,Sat May 30 02:22:27 2015 UTC,"I wonder how the slow down timer will work? If you get a slow down penalty are you going to have to slow down 2 seconds? And what is that 2 seconds based off of, your opimal sector time, your average pass or.....?"
iRacing,37qn7a,True_Racer,5,Fri May 29 19:52:02 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the logic will stay unchanged from whatever it is under the hood now.  It's a small plus that we'll finally see some kind of progress indicator.  People will also work out exactly how it works.
iRacing,37qn7a,ManNotHamburger,2,Fri May 29 20:44:00 2015 UTC,Yes. This is based on your (or overall) best/optimal sector time. That's why the black penalty for cutting is so ridiculous long in the first lap. There is no reference time yet.
iRacing,37qn7a,Niellie41,1 point,Sat May 30 07:00:45 2015 UTC,"Upon reading the post title, I just assumed there would be a timer on the black flag, like, how long you have to slow down before you get a pitlane penalty.

And have both that and the ghost car available in the replay so you can pay better attention to it. Oh and I'm trying to bring in the delta bar to the replay as well, so you can see gains and losses on a frame by frame basis. I'm not 100% sure that I can get all of those working, and I'm a bit confused about what it means to have the delta bar in the replay but hopefully we will have a lot more to show next season.  Anyway the goal is to basically bring more of the telemetry into the sim, without overwhelming you with a bunch of squiggly lines.

iRacing,37qy7u,Beefchief99,8,Fri May 29 18:08:32 2015 UTC,"There's cheating in any online game. But I have been with iRacing for a bit over a year and I've never suspected anybody of cheating. There are guys who are crazy fast (if you race Skip Barber you'll see some of them). I watch them drive and I think to myself ""wow, that's impossible"". But I never think they're cheating. They're just that good.  On the oval side, apparently some guys will do burnouts against the pit wall to warm their tires before qualifying, which is a protestable offense. So you'll hear about small stuff like that. Some people feel like ""if you ain't cheatin you ain't tryin"" but that's mostly just guys talking big.  I don't think there's any widespread cheating: hacking the game to increase grip or whatever. If there is, I haven't encountered it. My guess is that if there is such a thing it's in the higher profile series not Skip Barber.  Here's a really good article about how iRacing polices cheating: http://www.iracing.com/iracingnews/iracing-news/iracing-qa"
iRacing,37qy7u,Sasken,3,Fri May 29 18:32:20 2015 UTC,"I am pretty confident there isn't  cheating going on especially in the Skippy. All the aliens post replays of their laps and post them to ispeed. They get analyzed by lots of people and any cheating would probably come to light. There was a big hubbub about drafting in qualifying last season, but the new format got rid of that concern."

iRacing,37qy7u,thyusername,2,Sat May 30 03:26:05 2015 UTC,"iRacing is totally online and dependent on their server infrastructure. It requires server-side components and the contents on your computer are DRM/encrypted. The downside to this is that you MUST have an internet connection active to log in and start a session. The upside to this is that it is nearly impossible for anyone to come up with a way of cheating. A few years ago there was a case of someone who had found a way of cheating (a few people). iRacing became aware of this (since they can see from the server side of things the type of stuff your computer is doing with the sim) and they collected data for a while. Eventually, a few people who had picked up on this activity made a bunch of noise about it on youtube and on the iracing forums and this unfortunately meant that iRacing had to blow the issue open sooner than they might have wanted. It resulted in all of the offenders being banned and a stern warning going out about similar behaviour in the future.  Iracing also limits the possibility of exploits by making sure they only give reasonable information out via the API. For instance, you can't view real-time tyre temps from the API. There's a delay of some 6 seconds or so. This prevents anyone from running software that detects micro changes in tyre temps and responses by altering inputs, etc."
iRacing,37qy7u,jrebs,1 point,Fri May 29 20:44:40 2015 UTC,I remember that. Some pro drivers were talking about what cheats they were using over voice chat. Someone had recorded it.   Idiots.

So outside of one or two SOF races it's not that active.  Multiclass series will be doomed by default untill iRacing realizes that splitting 10 cars into 3 splits because there are 50 people driving the top car is just going to make even less people drive those cars."

iRacing,37nr1s,wmahan,1 point,Fri May 29 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"Select the series as if you were going to ""Race Now"". On the left of the series panel, select stats. Then select Qualifying results and display all divisions.  To my understanding, you can find what the lowest split you'll be in (lowest meaning Split 2 is lower than Split 1). Take wherever you placed in Q times and divided that by 33, then round up to the next whole number. That is the LOWEST split you will be in. Obviously, anyone can achieve the 1st split, if the enough people in front of them don't race. For example, if you are the 137th fastest Q, your lowest split is 5 (137/33=4.15, thus rounds up to 5).  If you look at the third image, find which time your Q time is faster than, and you'll PROBABLY be in that split."

iRacing,37noyk,xdarq,3,Thu May 28 23:50:56 2015 UTC,That's strange I actually found the solstice easier to drive to be honest.  I think with the Mazda you don't have to clutch to down shift? So maybe your not hitting the clutch enough for the downshift in the solstice? That's the only reason I can think of for getting stuck in neutral.  You can always hit the clutch again to try and get it in gear.

iRacing,37noyk,thisguysmokey,1 point,Fri May 29 03:00:57 2015 UTC,It seems like maybe the Solstice is just unforgiving when it comes to rev matching? If the revs aren't right on during the downshift it's like it just goes into neutral instead of completing the shift. I do use the clutch when I downshift in the MX-5 but it was very forgiving when downshifting as long as I wasn't going too fast. Maybe this car requires heel-toe to drive properly. I should probably learn that but it's too bad that the G27 pedals are so small.
iRacing,37noyk,Obesity_,1 point,Fri May 29 00:42:08 2015 UTC,"Not too sure, maybe someone whose fast in the solstice can chime in. I'm not mega fast in it but I don't really find any issue with big downshifts like turn 1 etc.   I'm definitely not using heel and toe either. Perhaps not slowing the car enough before shifting?"

For the Skippy, you lift on upshifts.  Downshifts you can just jam it down through gears without blipping or using the clutch.    I made a video on how to drive different iRacing transmissions awhile back."

iRacing,37k8tu,MAD_JIHAD,3,Thu May 28 09:26:04 2015 UTC,"It's a sequential dog box, you don't need to clutch it. Pull the shifter, then either do a quick lift or wait until the car hits the rev limiter, that unloads the transmission and it shifts."
iRacing,37k8tu,Bakkster,1 point,Thu May 28 12:25:12 2015 UTC,Does the unloading of the transmission via no clutch give any speed boost over lifting?
iRacing,37k8tu,MAD_JIHAD,1 point,Thu May 28 15:18:20 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by 'via no clutch'?  I believe the fastest way is a very short throttle lift just before the rev limiter (optimal RPM is a few hundred below the limiter). Not sure it's a significant improvement over just letting it hit the rev limiter, though I haven't driven the Skippy in ages."
iRacing,37k8tu,Bakkster,1 point,Thu May 28 16:26:42 2015 UTC,"Going up to the rev limiter used to be just as fast.  A couple of years ago that supposedly changed so that it doesn't grab the next gear as quickly as if you just lift.    For more variety, you see guys every once in awhile that stab the clutch to upshift without ever lifting."
iRacing,37k8tu,ManNotHamburger,1 point,Thu May 28 18:26:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know that you need to blip the throttle for every down shift. I blip for all down shifts myself but often with not a lot of throttle (no clutch). But i think it does help especially if your shifting early and getting high revs. For upshifts i use the clutch with full throttle, others choose to lift of without using the clutch. I don't know if either is quicker but its more of a personal preference."
iRacing,37k8tu,RaceBird,2,Thu May 28 07:11:58 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""not a lot of throttle (no clutch)."" ?  EDIT:  I went with just using auto blip for now until I develop better car control, I'm trying to do too much at once for my coordination to comprehend."
iRacing,37k8tu,Bakkster,1 point,Thu May 28 07:31:17 2015 UTC,"Don't use the clutch at all, when shifting the Skippy. Just lift a bit on the throttle while holding the upshift (or wait until you hit the rev limiter), and blip a bit of throttle with no clutch on the downshifts.  The iRacing model takes your shifter input as which direction you're pushing the shifter. With a dog box transmission like this, the car will shift as soon as you unload the transmission (that's what the blips are for), no clutch needed for the synchros to match the speeds."
iRacing,37k8tu,ZeeNewAccount,1 point,Thu May 28 12:27:59 2015 UTC,"As far as the on or off throttle up-shifting is concerned, why don't you try it on a track where you get consistent lap times and see if you gain or drop time on the straights?"
iRacing,37k8tu,ZeeNewAccount,1 point,Thu May 28 09:46:51 2015 UTC,Consistent lap times are completely alien to me at this point in the game.  My clean laps vary from each other by at least 2-3 seconds.
iRacing,37k8tu,randomkontot,1 point,Thu May 28 10:14:19 2015 UTC,"Well, to add my 2 cents then, I upshift on throttle (however, I race in FSR not Skip Barber). I can not imagine how power shifting would not be faster than lifting during a shift, but at the same time I also doubt it makes that much of a difference."
iRacing,37k8tu,thisguysmokey,1 point,Thu May 28 11:07:09 2015 UTC,It's simply because the Skip Barber won't let you upshift while on the throttle. The only time it does that is if you hold the gear-up button pressed while hitting the rev limiter. It's not instant though so you will be on the rev limiter for maybe half a second or more before the shift happens. Therefore it's faster to lift slightly when shifting.

iRacing,37ka6d,chris_whitney,5,Thu May 28 06:26:44 2015 UTC,"You asked for a walkthrough so here goes.  Note: please make sure you have watched ""going faster"" youtube videos which I've linked below or something so you have an understanding of what braking points, turn in points, apex and track out points are before reading this.  A little mantra thought I've kept in my mind lately has been to focus on doing what it takes in every corner so that I can get back on to full throttle or close to full throttle at the apex of each corner, it means that I need to do as much work as possible to have the car steady and stable as soon as I reach that apex point, doing all of my braking right up to the apex and that it might mean trail braking into it, whatever it takes to be smooth and be able to get power down to maximize my speed on the straights:   Walkthrough:  Turn 1-2 chicane, you need to really practice your threshold braking so that you can brake at or just before the 100 meter marker without locking up. Make sure you are staying as close to the left side of the track as possible under braking and then turn in so that your right tires pop over the kerb on the right and that your speed and car control stays smooth so that you can also attack the left hand kerb. This involves continuing to slow down the car between the first and second kerbs. You should aim to be back on throttle at the left hand kerb which is the apex, while using discretion so as not to spin your wheels up. Track out to the right rumble strip and try make it all the way around Curva Grande (turn 3) with as little steering input as possible.   Turn 4-5 variante chicane, I brake just before the 100 meter marker, again making sure my threshold braking keeps me from locking up or I'll be going too fast to clip the left hand kerb which is the goal here. once you clip this kerbing on the left (practice taking as much of it as you can without getting an offtrack), you should wait till all 4 tires are back on the tarmac and then get the power down, trying to take some but not all of the right hand kerbing and getting power down as early as possible creating a smooth right handed arc out of the chicane and towards the next corner which is the first lesmo. At each of these chicanes, the core of the philosophy is to straighten them out as much as possible.   Turn 6 (Lesmo 1) is a long right hander. You are trying to maximize your EXIT speed for this one, so make DAMN sure you are actually hitting the inside apex and are not off by a foot or even an inch, be smooth with your right turning steering input, and you want your turn in point to be right at the grey cement on the left hand side that's in the grass or just before it if you are having trouble hitting the apex. Wait to get back on throttle until you clip the apex, and then squeeze back on throttle to maximize your exit, and don't be afraid to be out on the green turf. Again, practice this exit because you can actually get away with dropping a tire before you get hit with an off track. You don't want to drop this tire, but it's better than being a few feet in the other direction.  Turn 7 (Lesmo 2) - Though we want to carry as much speed from the first lesmo into this one, what's most important is the exit speed of the Lesmo 2 so that you'll gain time down the Curva del Serraglio (the straight past the church). Try braking right at the 50 marker before the lesmo 2 and turning in late. Use all the space you can on exit to straighten the steering wheel back out and keep the power all the way down this straight.   Turns 8-10 Variante Ascari is VERY tricky. You need a combination of threshold braking that evolves into trail braking to the apex of turn 8. Start by practicing your trail braking and brake at the orange paint on the right side barrier, dragging slight brake to the apex of turn 8, evolve this into a threshold brake just before the 100 marker and (the opposite of squeeze) ease off the brakes just barely clipping the left apex of turn 8, sweeping back to the apex of turn 9 and get back on the throttle at that turn 9 apex (if you've gotten on throttle earlier, then you're not carrying enough speed through turn 8) and then back to the left hand apex of turn 10 and now track WAY out. The whole time, you're trying to move the steering wheel as little left and right as possible, straightening it out and using the kerbs to help your ""straight line"". You can track way way way out of turn 10 across the astro turf without getting an off track.   Turn 11 - Curva PARABOLICA (I know its supposed be like parabolic, but it's more like diabolical!!!)... my favorite right turn on this track (there are so many right's! lol). Brake late between the 150 and 100 meter marker, I brake about halfway down the strip of dark green turn that's on your left side by those markers. Brake in as much of a straight line as possible to find an appropriate speed where you can turn in without losing the rear end and carry as much speed towards the apex as you can. Clip the apex LATE, like just a few feet before the right side kerbing ends, and then immediately try to straight the wheel out as much as you can, tracking out and riding the kerb ALL THE WAY... you should be pointed at the RIGHT HAND of the track just a little left of the pit wall, and then with your car, drive a diagonal line all the way back down to your braking point at turn 1! THEN DO IT ALL AGAIN!!!  Good luck, and remember with the skippy, it's fast in AND fast out, not just slow in fast out. You've got to carry your speed because this car is just too underpowered otherwise.   If you're having trouble understanding any of the lingo, go check out ""Going Faster"" and The Ultimate Speed Secrets which is a book available on amazon and a worthwhile read!  If you are having trouble executing any of these things, you might try practicing the limits of this car to find your threshold braking and the point at which the car breaks loose. Two things to practice: 1 come down the straight and choose to brake as HARD as possible at the 250 marker. Try it again and again until your braking distance is as short as possible, this involves modulating the brake by squeezing it and letting it go until you find the sweet spot to stop the car in the shortest distance. 2 drive down a straight way at a steady speed (choose 45 MPH), start weaving back and forth and feel the amount of steering input needed to turn the car, what do you need to do to actually get the car loose? learn from these lessons and apply them on your hot laps!"
iRacing,37ka6d,iFap4DaytonaCoupes,1 point,Thu May 28 22:52:32 2015 UTC,"This is a great walkthrough. I use slightly different markers but they are not far off. My best undrafted is a 13.8. The best hint here is to adjust your brake point back until you can get and stay on the throttle at apex. If you have to wait after apex or lift once on  the gas you will lose a ton of time down the long straights that follow. Once you get that down keep the same braking point but try and get off the brakes earlier to carry more speed into the apex, while still allowing you to get on full throttle at apex. Finally, if you are only doing 2:20's I suspect you are not using the whole track. Go to the forums and watch the posted fast laps and follow their lines. Good luck."

It is important to brake early so you can cut the chicanes a bit (don't everdo it, you'll get a penalty). Use your engine to slow you down, so shift down fast while approaching the corners. But again, don't overdo it as you can easily blow up your engine by doing that.  That's basically it. Gave me roughly a 2s faster time in the end. You have to compromise the first corner of a chicane to get a better exit on the second one due to the straights that follow up. It is not that important on other tracks but in Monza basically every chicane ends up in a very very long straight (or at least full throttle passage). So if you fuck up the second corner of a chicane you'll lose speed (and therefore time) until the next corner, which in Monza is miles away."

Is it because these tracks were popular in recent years and people got tired of them? or are there other reasons I'm just not aware of? This is only my second season (first full season)."
iRacing,37goys,speedkinduci,1 point,Thu May 28 01:51:24 2015 UTC,"Those tracks, along with VIR, are difficult to learn and very hard to master.  After that it is kind of a vicious circle; they're not popular so they don't get used much, so people don't learn them, so they don't get popular....."

I connected the amp to a sound card on my PC, and assigned that audio output to extension mode in SimVibe (shifter channel, not that it should matter).   From there, I clipped the 4 wire connector from the PC fan, connected red to red, black to black on the buttkicker amp and ta-da,it works!   I did try to run 2 fans off the same channel and ended up frying a fan that way. I think next on the list is to try with a more powerful amp, and try to locate a stronger PC fan, or maybe experiment with 12V Marine blowers"
iRacing,37isq3,dilkington11,1 point,Thu May 28 10:21:39 2015 UTC,I think there is a better way for you to do this rather than use a force feedback channel associated with your audio card. You should pretty easily be able to attach your fan (or a number of them) to a PWM output on a microcontroller. Use iRacing's API to ascertain vehicle speed and vary the duty cycle of the output with that speed to get a more precise recreation.
iRacing,37i7z9,wmahan,2,Wed May 27 20:43:57 2015 UTC,Weight jacker (WJ) moves the RR up or down. You could think of it as a wedge if that's easier. Moving the WJ up (RR up) makes the car looser and moving the WJ down (RR down) makes the car tighter. WJ is typically used to make minor adjustments to the balance of the car over a fuel run as well as to help combat aeropush (although there is no way to get rid of aeropush without absurd amounts of downforce).

iRacing,37fswz,Haff,6,Wed May 27 09:00:31 2015 UTC,"Wait for session to start, dont join it yet. After it started go to ""Find Official Races"" and select ""Watch/Ghost/Crew/Spot"" > ""Road series races"". There you will find all sessions in progress.   You can join them if you have content. Ghost racing means you can see and race with others, but they wont see you and you cant touch them and vice versa. No SR/IR can be gained or lost in this mode. Very useful for beginners.  Shifting is personal preference. Some people like clutch/H-pattern for immersion, some will run paddle shifters in all cars. Aids like auto-shift, auto-clutch, auto-blip are slowing you down, but not much. You will have to drop them eventually, but for now get used to handling of MX5. With practice you will get better and you can turn them off.  FOV is very important. Use in-game calculator or one of many calculators online. Looks like you are using ultra-wide monitor so keep that in mind, it will be relevant when calculating proper FOV."
iRacing,37fswz,theebe,1 point,Wed May 27 09:57:28 2015 UTC,"Great tip about the ghost racing, will have to give that a shot for sure. I am indeed running ultrawide so it's always in mind (especially because it's not ""friendly"" to all games). Feeling really comfortable in the MX5 though, just need to really fully learn at what speeds and situations I can afford to drop a gear lower, seems to be an issue of mine playing it safe with gears."
iRacing,37fswz,QuadroMan1,1 point,Wed May 27 10:48:44 2015 UTC,"You'll get good at managing your gears through sound alone.  Usually shifting down at a braking point is a given, I always just shift down until I hear the RPMs are back up (without being at the shift point yet obviously)  Then once you learn the track you'll start knowing what gear you need to be in at the track out of each turn."
iRacing,37fswz,novaquasarsuper,1 point,Wed May 27 19:27:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm still a little squirrely when I throw it down to an optimal gear in some corners, went two races without anything too bad from that happening though, got lucky at least 3 or 4 times and was able to save it without losing much time (drift master pro in the making?).  I'm using the H-pattern shifter so I've got a tendency to skip gears to save time shifting (and I'm 99% sure I'm shifting at bad times quite often too). I've always enjoyed watching the ""slower"" street cars and man is that MX-5 fun as heck to drive."
iRacing,37fswz,Eburon,1 point,Wed May 27 21:21:16 2015 UTC,I've been racing over a year and didn't know about this. Thank you!!!
iRacing,37fswz,sim-racingcouk,3,Wed May 27 18:45:52 2015 UTC,"There is no reason to be worried, it's a good thing you're feeling this because you'll be among those drivers who will improve a lot. There will be be too many starting off overconfident and wreck everything in sight, then they'll either go back to practice and get more cautious or quit.  The important thing for a beginner (and the experienced) is knowing the track blindfolded. One empty fuel tank in practice is what I consider minimum for a new driver. Know the place where cars lapping you can easily pass and where it's hard, so you can let them past before a technical section or you can pick the right side of the road to let them get past without disrupting their race too much.  You will make mistakes, and you'll get yelled at. But that will die down soon enough with your attitude. And that is why you have the rookie series, brake when you see accidents happen, don't try to squeeze through gaps. Give room to people you don't trust on the track, or who are too pushy behind you, sooner or later you'll see them parked in the wall."
iRacing,37fswz,Eburon,2,Wed May 27 11:20:32 2015 UTC,"Really good advice and I would agree really strongly with the statement, ""There is no reason to be worried, it's a good thing you're feeling this because you'll be among those drivers who will improve a lot""."

Thanks for the tips and kind words."
iRacing,37fswz,AndyBatch,1 point,Wed May 27 11:54:28 2015 UTC,"never ever worry about safetyrating, it comes natural when you race smart. If you have a hard time with safetyrating it has to do with your ability to spot trouble early and it's really easy to fix, look up the track, ready to brake when you see drivers battling in front of you, staying out of trouble... and especially in rookie it's so easy to gain sr once you get these things down and get comfortable on the track. You will bruise some people, there's no way around that, just be apologetic and move on, even if they don't."
iRacing,37fswz,Rugby8724,2,Wed May 27 12:24:50 2015 UTC,"Being apologetic is in my Canadian blood, and I never intend on jumping into a race without being comfortable in the car on that track."
iRacing,37fswz,Rugby8724,1 point,Wed May 27 14:58:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. Also, one other key skill is looking way farther ahead then you'd usually do street driving. If you see three wide going into any corner in anything other than a high-level series brake check or at least lift. You'll either pass the wreck, or someone has way more pace than you could safely match.   Once you start getting a feel for racing safely, you'll be able to prevent the vast majority of accidents. You can still get rear-ended, but even those you have some control over by letting the risky people by and passing them once they've exceeded their driving ability."
iRacing,37fswz,ZeeNewAccount,3,Wed May 27 14:18:36 2015 UTC,"More than anything, don't get discouraged if you have a bad race. You can only learn so much in practice. We all start somewhere and are usually sub par when do start (or in my case, 1 year after you start). Wins and podiums will come!"

iRacing,37fswz,Gus_TheAnt,1 point,Wed May 27 22:21:14 2015 UTC,"One more piece of advice...When learning a new track, go watch a race or practice. Who ever is the fastest guy on the track, go watch him take laps from the cockpit view...it will give you a good idea of the line you want to be using."

iRacing,37fswz,jorgethetalkinggoat,1 point,Thu May 28 01:19:19 2015 UTC,"TBH, I got over the overly polite, scared to race in close quarters with people period with iRacing when I started racing half in the bag/completely shit-faced. Seriously, it worked wonders for me. I even won a race in a decent split in MX5 when I was so drunk that I couldn't even see straight. You see, if you practice enough, you can lap just as fast when you're drunk because it's all muscle memory at that point. But what you probably need is some aggression and some ""fuck you"" when it comes to defending positions. That is where the alcohol can really help.   I was fast and consistent from tonnes of practice, but I lacked the balls to really fight for position and fight off attackers. Alcohol demonstrated to me that being racey not only provides better results (including wins), but it's also a little safer.   Anyways, it's a thought."
iRacing,37fswz,arsenicfox,1 point,Thu May 28 10:43:34 2015 UTC,You can miss the start of a race and start from pit road.  But really the only way to get accustomed to racing with other people is to either ask people to race with you in practice or just jump right in a race if you feel like you can keep it on the track.  Most of Rookies is about avoiding wrecks and getting out of Rookies.
iRacing,37fswz,arsenicfox,3,Wed May 27 09:12:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, starting from the pits was what my dad suggested, I suppose then it'll feel more like practice, and I won't have to deal with the pack of other rookies spinning themselves out and clipping me with them on the way (actually did this in practice to my dad).  Should I enable voice chat? I have Sennheiser Urbanites, so while the mic does work on PC there's no mute toggle like a traditional headset built for computers (since it's built for phones). How does the voice chat work?  EDIT: just looked at the voice controls, will just map it to one of the wheel buttons I suppose, should be able to find room (aside from having ""sorry"" mapped to everything like the Canadian I am)."
iRacing,37fswz,ZeeNewAccount,1 point,Wed May 27 09:17:00 2015 UTC,"Yo, starting from the pits is a terrible strategy. You will come in contact with and have to pass the worst drivers that way and that is all but guaranteed. Keep in mind that worst doesn't mean slow, it just means worst. These are the drivers who are most likely take you out of the race through stupidity that will be difficult to predict.   Also, you need to get used to the standing start. No way around it.   Finally, when all is said and done, you will probably average 5 positions higher if you always start from the grid with a representative qualifying time. Why wouldn't you want to finish higher?"
iRacing,37fswz,Dark1ing,1 point,Thu May 28 10:52:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely enable voice chat. If the leaders are coming up behind you, ask them where they want you to go so you can do your best to stay out of the way. Remember, your goal in Rookies should be to get out, worry about wins and finishing position when you're higher up and more comfortable racing around other people."
iRacing,37fswz,thisguysmokey,1 point,Wed May 27 10:20:13 2015 UTC,"Right on, thanks for the tips. I intend on doing road course racing so just skipping qualifying hopefully puts me at the back and I can hang there for a bit rather than starting from the pits."
iRacing,37fswz,ZeeNewAccount,1 point,Wed May 27 10:50:14 2015 UTC,"And if they don't have voice or text chat enabled, then what? Or if the leaders are embroiled in a battle, will they have the time to tell you where to go? Especially if they are much quicker then they won't know which corner they'll catch you at.  As a backmarker you should drive your normal line and remain predictable for the leaders. If you're on a straight then you can pull over safely and slow down. Or if they come up behind you into a corner, treat it like a normal overtake for position and give them room to pass, normally on the inside."
iRacing,37fswz,True_Racer,1 point,Wed May 27 11:14:21 2015 UTC,"As a backmarker you should drive your normal line and remain predictable for the leaders.   This a billion times. I can't tell you how many races are ruined for both parties when a backmarker panics and makes a sudden movement thinking they are helping.  If you are on a long straight, by all means, slowly pull over. Otherwise, run a line that isn't going to result in everyone wrecking. It cuts both ways. Slower cars are learning how to stay out of trouble, but faster guys (and there's a lot of THIS that can be, esp. in rookie classes) can sometimes be pretty bad at actually passing cars."
iRacing,37fswz,ZeeNewAccount,1 point,Wed May 27 13:53:04 2015 UTC,"Great to know. I've mapped the ""pass left/right"" calls on my wheel buttons for added bonus too."

iRacing,37fswz,Fermani2,1 point,Wed May 27 12:20:01 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the general consensus from the answers I've gotten. I was even a little hesitant on joining my first Open Practice, and actually had someone get riled up at me for something I didn't even do.  Story: I spun out and had a slight collision with the car behind me who (unknowingly to me at the time) actually ended up being my dad, so I pressed my ""sorry"" key and went to the pits. At the exact some time someone else on the track got absolutely creamed by another car, so he went off thinking it was me that hit him, used some colourful language that I'm sure broke the sporting code and quickly learned to check his replays before he goes calling people out. Anyway, it was practice so I'm not sure why he cared so much in the first place, but that's my story of my first Open Practice session."

I just found it super bizarre that someone would go mad over a crash in practice, but he did get just absolutely creamed."
iRacing,37fswz,Fermani2,1 point,Wed May 27 21:16:52 2015 UTC,I spent a decent amount of time in Mazda Cup as I was in no rush to get out and I would say that kind of behavior is either rare or I was blessed. I only had a couple of bad experiences in my time there and I  stayed there by choice for 4 months.
iRacing,37fswz,Fermani2,1 point,Thu May 28 10:59:07 2015 UTC,"Dude go for it, I was in a similar boat to you and was very nervous at first, Ive only ran about 14 races but I already feel much more confident, and one more decent race from leaving Rookies!  One thing to bear in mind is that perhaps the worst thing that can happen is that you crash on the first corner and total your car (this happened on my first race at Laguna Seca), you basically take 4x incident points and then get towed back to the pits for the worlds longest pit stop.   After that you will re-join and everything will have calmed down, then as long as you get around the rest relatively cleanly your SR will go up.  You are allowed 17 incident points in a race before you are DQ'd, and I had a couple of races where I had 10-11 incident point and my safety rating still went up, so you have to be pretty messing to lose SR.  Your times for Okoyama are also fine, i'm only about 1.5s quicker than you and I came second earlier - my first podium :)  So that's it, I expect to see you on the track soon :)"
iRacing,37h7i9,h3r4ld,2,Wed May 27 16:43:24 2015 UTC,"If you are the leader, as long as you keep a steady pace you can do what you want.  However, you can't brake check the whole field or anything stupid like that.  Personally if I am starting a rolling start I would let the pace car get a little bit ahead towards the end of the pace lap, so that when it turns into the pits I can either keep a steady pace until I choose to go, or I can power out of the last corner early and get an advantage over the people that are still coming through the last corner."
iRacing,37h7i9,sim-racingcouk,1 point,Wed May 27 20:16:39 2015 UTC,"If you are on pole in the fastest class, then maintain the pace car speed and go whenever you want to between the pace car pulling off and the green flag.  I recommend that you do not slow down from the pace speed or there will be a big wreck and drivers angry at you."
iRacing,37h7i9,Gorbash91,1 point,Wed May 27 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"Bunching up the pack is what a leader does sometimes in hopes that the guys behind him will all cause a massive wreck and he will run away with the lead early. In general, I like starting at the earliest allowable point (either the last corner or when the pace car swerves off track to the pit lane). This allows the start to string the cars out better and go single file earlier (a bit safer).  If you're leading your class which isn't the fastest class in the race, I suggest allowing a gap to open between you and the next class ahead during the pace lap (3-5 seconds for instance). You're not racing those guys, so there's nothing lost here, but it gives you more of a safety buffer if the cars ahead of you get into a big wreck."

iRacing,379iph,PETC,2,Mon May 25 23:53:41 2015 UTC,"Concentrate on your braking points and not locking up. Some, like the corkscrew, you need to slow waaay down for, others are little to no braking and throttle lift, but not completely or you're likely going around.  Do some CLEAN laps at 40-50% and move on from there. Laguna Seca is very much a track that rewards people who know the track very well.  Practice,  practice, practice!  I've been lapping around Laguna since the days of the Playstation 1 and I still mess things up occasionally. I do find it is a track that requires being in your happy zone to find consistency."

iRacing,379iph,quasio,1 point,Tue May 26 00:41:15 2015 UTC,"its a hard track, my only advice would be more practice and maybe finding an experienced player to practice with. also good laptimes are important but when you are in the race its more about consistency and just running clean.sometimes the winner will be the safest guy."
iRacing,379iph,AndrewCoja,2,Mon May 25 23:59:06 2015 UTC,"I guess I got traumatized at my time at ACRL, where I would put like 10~15 hours of practice in a single car/track combination to end up with times that were still 10 whole seconds above optimal, then to see people complaining ""God my laptimes suck, I don't think I'll be doing this race"" with times 2 seconds above world record"
iRacing,379iph,arsenicfox,1 point,Tue May 26 00:02:15 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about other people. Some people aren't happy unless they have the fastest time ever. Lap times aren't everything, consistency is. You can run the fastest time ever and it won't matter if you put it into a wall in the next lap. Focus on being consistent. Slow lap times that are consistent over the whole race will put you ahead. Especially in the lower races. Many people you race against might throw in really fast laps, but they will also make a mistake later in the race and crash out or end up behind you. I get a lot of my positions from people crashing out."

iRacing,379iph,True_Racer,1 point,Tue May 26 17:20:39 2015 UTC,"Even if your not doing really fast laps as long as you can keep it consistent you will probably do ok in a race.  I would watch some of the videos on the I racing forums, particularly the weekly rookie Mazda cup thread.  Also jump into an open practice and try and hang onto other guys going round the track. I always drive better when I'm chasing or defending.   With the corkscrew I try to stay straight along the strip near the 3 board. Slow right down. Get down to the apex for the left hand part. Then look for the trees on the far side of the track to mark your turn back to the right. You could even watch actual cars going round the track. See Tudor championship at Laguna seca on YouTube or something."

iRacing,379iph,AndyBatch,1 point,Tue May 26 00:06:59 2015 UTC,Check that your wheel is set up correctly that can help (does the steering wheel of the car match your actual wheel rotation). Could also download iSpeed to compare yourself to others. Otherwise as others have said Practise and Patience
iRacing,379iph,DarkElf12,1 point,Tue May 26 00:09:25 2015 UTC,"Seconded on iSpeed. I absolutely suck at road racing,  but iSpeed keeps me back marker competitive. It also helps give me a slight edge on oval."

iRacing,379iph,RileyF1,1 point,Tue May 26 01:57:23 2015 UTC,Sound like you need to concentrate on setting up braking points and using references such as the tree in the corkscrew.   There's tons of walkthroughs for this track.  Find one and pay close attention to the minimum cornering speed.  I couldn't believe how slow I was hitting apexes when I thought I was already at max speed.   ...Oh and use ispeed. I think sim racing news or Iracing posted video on YouTube of an hour long seminar showing you how to use  ispeed. That was super helpful for me getting the most out of it. I would post a link to the video but I'm on mobile.   If I remember when I get home I'll post a link to a good walkthrough that really helped me get fast on this track.
iRacing,379iph,randomkontot,1 point,Tue May 26 02:22:20 2015 UTC,"If you're 3 seconds away from your optimal then you shouldn't even be trying to go fast, just keep it on track and be consistent."
iRacing,379iph,propast,1 point,Tue May 26 07:26:25 2015 UTC,If you can do 1:52 consistently for 20 laps you will get a good placement (top5) in rookie series. It's more about not crashing than posting lap times.

iRacing,379iph,arsenicfox,1 point,Tue May 26 11:09:05 2015 UTC,I don't see that anyone has mentioned iSpeed yet so I would suggest taking a look at that. It'll allow you to load up your laps with other people's and from there you can see where they hit the brake and get on the gas. iSpeed improved my times more than anything else (other than just practice).

iRacing,379iph,FastCarsAndSlowWomen,1 point,Tue May 26 14:09:35 2015 UTC,"One Corkscrew-specific suggestion is to look for the tree on the left of the track as your reference point. There's a tree with two trunks that as you're going over the first apex is a good reference point for when to start turning right again.  More generally, focus on consistency rather than speed. Don't try and lower your optimal time, focus on getting every lap near the same time. Slowly that'll start to drift towards your optimal, and consistent but slow is always better than inconsistently fast.  And one more thing to remember, as bad as you think you are, there's probably someone out there who's worse. The fact you're putting the effort in to learn new things already puts you ahead of the curve."
iRacing,379iph,redpedals,1 point,Tue May 26 12:51:21 2015 UTC,"I just went through your struggle. I too played a bunch of AC before coming to iracing. I did have some prior experience running laguna seca in GT5/6 but not much and I can tell you something important:  Your doing something wrong..  I noticed the braking in iracing is very different, perhaps you are losing tons of time there? Maybe you're not driving the MX-5 itself around properly? You need the maximise the your exit speed on every corner, the car does not get up to speed easily. But get into a practice session and drive right on someone's tail and figure out where you're losing time.   I too struggled to lower my lap time but after 5-6 hours you should be able to hold a good race pace. Give this a try, it's what works for me:  -New track comes out for MX-5 -Hot with ghost car for an hour or so -Join an open practice and try to follow someone's line -Find two people racing each other in practice and follow them -Back to hot laps with ghost car -first race, put yourself in the back  This is pretty much my routine every week for the new rookie track and it works great for me. I hope you find a good pace man, nothing like going wheel to wheel with another driver."
iRacing,379iph,Mister_Akuma,1 point,Wed May 27 03:36:49 2015 UTC,"Another thing that is helpful is watching replays (YouTube is easiest) of people doing a hot lap in the car/track combo yo are looking for.  It shows you wear to brake, accelerate, and what lines are fast through turns. Take that info and work on it from there, bagging a little earlier than the example videos as you get used to the breaking."
iRacing,379iph,dilkington11,1 point,Wed May 27 04:12:26 2015 UTC,"Many mentioned setting up your wheel correctly, specially check that you are not experiencing  clipping, this is a helpful guide: http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/2023748.page  I'd like to add a couple more things:   FOV. Having this set up correctly is key to get curves right, don't oversee it. EmpyBox did a great video explaining it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yYeiAHsdr0&list=PLAywC4hctMbmu_9J6vSewjmIoaLtj-Bry&index=6 Learn the track looking for visual references. Laguna Seca has reference breaking points marked and apexes indicated with red strips, use them as a starting point, and afterwards start adjusting according to your pace. Another great suggestion from EmptyBox (I really like his videos LOL) is to drive some laps slow, to check this things out  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFqHjR7wkuQ&index=8&list=PLAywC4hctMbmu_9J6vSewjmIoaLtj-Bry   If you are consistent in your lap times and drive safely, get on a race. I  was in your same situation, but being consistent, specially while playing with other fellow rookies, is key, a lot of drivers just crash on the first curve, or spin afterwards, stay focused and you will get great results. I ended up finishing on the top 4 several times because of this. Just let other faster drivers pass you safely, and concentrate on doing clean laps."
iRacing,3781fm,Chirp08,2,Mon May 25 17:13:38 2015 UTC,"No policy change, but they did change the user interface in the last update. That was more than a month ago though.  I think there are bugs in the ""what's hot"" and ""race planner"" things (whatever they're currently called - I don't use them so I'm not sure). Sessions don't always show up where they should.   I always use the ""Race Now"" tab and just pick the series from the dropdown. That always seems to work, unlike the other tools. So I suggest you try that - if you still can't pick a session from there, and you're sure it worked a month ago you should contact support."

iRacing,376f97,QuadroMan1,4,Mon May 25 07:01:40 2015 UTC,"Just keep practicing. The skippy is a great series and car to learn on. When in practice session go into the view of other drivers and watch their lines and where they break and are on the accelerator. After that focus on getting your lines down and braking points down at a little lower speeds and gradually increase your speed. Eventually try to follow a faster driver around some, keeping like 2-3 second distance, sometimes people will drive you around if you find a good session. You will keep improving, it just takes practice! Don't lose your patience and it'll reward you! Have fun out there!"

I rushed through the Rookies to get here.  At first I found the Skip the be very intimidating as it was harder to control, but after a few races you get a much better understanding on how the car works. Each race I seem to learn some new technique to make my laps fast.   Stick with it and you will get better. After 1 complete season the 2nd season will be much easier as you already know the tracks so you can spend more time on racecraft and less time learning to stay on the track."
iRacing,376f97,SkippyZA,1 point,Mon May 25 09:14:07 2015 UTC,The cool part about the skip is almost every technique can be used in almost any other car :) throttle control is super important as you can get quite a bit of wheel spin if you just slam down on it

iRacing,373w51,tommy44vercetti,1 point,Sun May 24 17:39:52 2015 UTC,The setup is awful this week. A bunch of guys on the forum were praising it earlier in the week but now I think the consensus is that there's no way to avoid the iRacing wiggle of death off turn 4 w/o going obscenely high or staying tucked up another car. It really sucks too cuz A class had a really good setup
iRacing,373w51,Gutsyisland,2,Sun May 24 18:05:43 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that's just the track. Death wiggle is poor driving man :P NASCAR gets it in real life too
iRacing,373w51,arsenicfox,1 point,Sun May 24 18:10:33 2015 UTC,Someone mentioned in the only Class B Fixed race I've entered that two rounds of trackbar to tighten the car up and it would have been perfect. I may have to test it out in an open practice session after the Indy 500 ends.
iRacing,373w51,tommy44vercetti,1 point,Sun May 24 18:16:24 2015 UTC,Eh... I just have an issue with the way the sets are themselves. For some reason I just can't drive hire they're set up. Open sets are fine but I don't always have time to mess with set ups you know?
iRacing,373w51,Gutsyisland,1 point,Sun May 24 20:35:28 2015 UTC,"Me neither, that's why when I race in a session that doesn't have a default setup, I just find one on the forums."
iRacing,373w51,tommy44vercetti,1 point,Sun May 24 21:15:37 2015 UTC,Trucks and cup cars were tight while class B was loose.  You basically had to drive it carefully as possible until around 20 laps in when the tires are worn enough.
iRacing,373w51,AR-47,3,Sun May 24 18:26:57 2015 UTC,Even if you watch the NASCAR races it's fairly common for you to lose it coming out of 4.   That's just the nature of racing man. You're going to have wrecking at every level. You just have to get better at avoiding the avoidable ones.
iRacing,373w51,lolninja481,1 point,Sun May 24 17:27:20 2015 UTC,Charlotte is a mess in every class. For whatever reason I have much cleaner races in places like Dover and Richmond. Probably because people don't buy those tracks thinking they're going to be wreck fests.
iRacing,373w51,Mr_Pigeon,2,Sun May 24 23:46:22 2015 UTC,"I actually think Charlotte is a reasonably difficult track. Steep banks, flat straights and very quick transitions means keeping the car balanced is difficult. Compared to Richmond, where the speeds are lower and banks are shallower, and to Dover, where the straights are also heavily banked so transitions are much less of an issue, I think Charlotte is quite difficult.  Richmond has become one of my favourite tracks FWIW, so maybe I'm just comparatively good there. A few seasons ago it was the first track I raced in the Class B car and I had a decent amount of success so maybe it just suits me."
iRacing,3712dl,QuadroMan1,14,Sat May 23 21:41:31 2015 UTC,If you're three wide in rookies one is probably already sideways.
iRacing,3712dl,doveenigma13,4,Sat May 23 22:52:40 2015 UTC,"It ended up being me when the one on my left passed too close and sent me spinning.  All I want to do is finish and these guys are racing aggressive when they can barely get a clean lap in, because of that I usually end up letting people pass if they're riding me really hard.  Only .09 points left to 3.0 SR at least."
iRacing,3712dl,doveenigma13,6,Sat May 23 22:59:09 2015 UTC,"Avoid other cars like the plague. Let them pass and when your racing in a higher class, they'll still be there in rookies bumping people for wins."

iRacing,372tei,someoneinsane,1 point,Sun May 24 10:13:16 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're using the BMW? I don't drive GT3 usually. Firm up the rear arb's and springs, and soften/loosen front arbs and springs the help the car turn in more. Brake bias is of course personal preference, more front bias will transfer more weight to the front, but a more rearward bias will help with rotation, but might also wear the tires more, these are things you'll find out with practice.  Ultimately setups are personal preference, so putting in more laps and making small adjustments to see how it affects the car is most important. You will only go fast in a setup that you're comfortable with."
iRacing,372tei,eobet,1 point,Sun May 24 21:57:58 2015 UTC,"We ended up putting in about 70 practise laps on the official practise server for the BE this morning. Got back to getting regular 1:28s, and then when the race started up, the settings were changed again. How on earth is that fair? You set your car up for the race only for them to go with a completely random setting. It didn't seem to happen in any of the other Endurances that we ran. They all followed the same setting for the Sprint races.   Sucked so hard. We had been especially looking forward to this race as my team-mate lives down the road from the actual course, plus it is his birthday weekend so it fell nicely for him until the actual racing part."

iRacing,372tei,welded_sheep,1 point,Mon May 25 10:01:22 2015 UTC,You can see the weather for all practice sessions. It shows default weather to me. Are you sure you didn't join a sprint practice session by accident. It happened to me before.     Edit: I guess you guys are Team CAT? Seems like you joined the right practice session. I would be surprised if the weather was different in just that one session but it's not showing weather for finished practice sessions. Also your race pace doesn't look too different from the practice session. The difference is probably due to fuel.
iRacing,372tei,Didarab0cchi,0,Mon May 25 10:35:44 2015 UTC,"No, definitely the Endurance one, because we were sharing the car. We had the race fuel in the car to get the 1:28s.  If you look at my races during the week (after your impressive detective work) you'll see that I was getting an average lap time of  ~1:29.9 with fastest of ~1:28.6. Same set-up for Saturday's race and could only get fast of 1.29.7 and average of 1:31. Sunday, after working on car to suit temperatures, which then changed again (even the track looked different with the sun lower and road glare) I again got average of 1:31 and fastest of 1:29.7.   Even early in the week, when I still wasn't used to the track, I was doing better than I did during the Endurance. I'm not the fastest driver in the world, but together we are competitive and consistent so we believed we were in with a chance at a podium, or at least a top 5. Especially after getting two podiums during the week. Just kinda sucked, is all."

I think I'm going for the F1 since that's what my team is into but I would really love to become a Blancpain pro, I really enjoy endurance stuff. It will be a tough decision.   I assume you're going for the Blancpain pro license?"
iRacing,36zf2c,teh_cheat,1 point,Sat May 23 22:44:04 2015 UTC,Yes i will try for the Blancpain license. Having 1 pro license doesn't qualify you for all pro series. Trying for both series at the same time is possible though.

A) I don't believe you're having the issue i'm about to describe, but a blown engine makes the same collision noise. Since you're awarded collision points, however, it makes me a bit more curious.  B) Netcode: The game uses a lot of optimizations and ""guess work"" to make online racing FEASIBLE. (So, even though iRacing may seem wonky, it's still much more stable than other games like Assetto Corsa), which includes a ""prediction"" code.  This prediction code tries to predict where you and other cars are going mid-packet, sort of like mouse smoothing or things like that. When it does, occasionally it flips out especially if someone like yours or the other cars connection is poor.   But like I said, save a replay so we can see, but sadly in the world of the internet (and the piss poor internet we have in the USA), it's possible you were racing along side someone not in the UK (based on your name), who had a poor connection, and suffered from an issue from one of the various network issues."
iRacing,36z7h8,arsenicfox,2,Sat May 23 11:17:50 2015 UTC,Without replay i can't tell for sure but it sounds like netcode to me. If you or the other driver had a high ping then contacts can happen even  if you left enough room. Always look at your ping at the start of a session and drive accordingly. You should also make notes of people around you with a high ping and keep your distance to them.

I have everything maxed out except for the secondary shadow thing (can't remember the exact name).

iRacing,36vqmr,someoneinsane,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:48:19 2015 UTC,"The GT3 series is the most popular road series by far, there's a RUF(porsche), BMW, Ford GT, and McLaren MP4-12C. Next season(in a week) The new GT1 series with the Corvette and DBR9 is likely to be similarly popular.  However I would recommend that you master a D class car or even the Mazda, so that you learn better racecraft in slower cars so that you're significantly more prepared for the faster GTs. The Skip Barber and the Spec Racer Ford are the most fun and challenging cars to drive when you practice and learn how the physics work to help lower your lap times."

While you might be uncomfortable with a low fov (especially with a single monitor) this helps IMMENSELY in being consistent. It's not a magic tool that will instantly make you faster. In fact, it might make you worse at first. But having a proper FOV for the size and distance of your monitor creates at least a close to 1:1 ratio for size and distance in game to real life. So a car or turn that's x-feet away looks and feels like it's x-feet away. Which helps when you FIND that sweet driving line that makes you fast to be consistent and hit it more often.  He also has some episodes on the different types of driving, how to use your brake to go faster, and FFB Clipping. (Speaking of which, once you get into iRacing I'd recommend you get Wheel check. Not all FFB is the same but I found a sweet spot between heavy ffb and clipping with my strength set to 20ish and my Min-strength set to 10. Keeps it heavy, but reduces smaller FFB while stronger ones come in. Also, don't listen to others and keep your G27 profiler settings at 100% strength. Apparently this ""107%"" bug was fixed by iRacing some time ago and 107% just screws it up according to the devs.   Also, EdRacing.com has some good G27 tips and tricks, as well as some skip barber tricks if you ever get into that.   Be prepared to be humbled. People will be better than you. Or wreck you cause Rookies. shrug you'll learn to dodge them. ;)  The problem is you'll get ""meh"" racers in all games. But, iRacing has at least some pretty consistent races. I, personally, don't usually have a problem. You'll always get that one race though.   :D Anyways, hope you have fun!  (I'd also recommend TradingPaints. It automatically downloads custom skins for other users. Helpful if you want your own sponsers and stuff cause you can upload your own too :D)  There are also plenty of leagues to join if you want a more organized group. ;)"

Project Cars feels like Need For Speed compared to iRacing !  I have played Forza 2/3/4, GT1-2-3, Grid, Grid Motorsport, Project Cars and a lot more much older (oldest being GP2). Nothing comes close to iRacing in terms or feeling like you're actually racing on a track with other drivers. And I'm not only talking about physic engine, it's also the competitive approach of the game. You have to wait for a specific scheduled time to bo able to race. Which means that it's important not the screw up because you can't just leave it and join another lobby 30seconds later."

iRacing,36tkto,BillCuttingsOn,6,Fri May 22 00:32:10 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I was in rookie Street Stocks but I ran so many laps around that track I can remember quite well what I was doing.   The hardest thing for me to learn in oval racing was how to use the brakes. As a road racer, I was used to - in the majority of cases - braking hard in a straight line, getting the weight onto the nose of the car, then turning in whilst easing off the brakes.   In oval racing, this is not what you want to do. Most of your speed on ovals is found by keeping your corner speeds up, rather than maximising your braking and acceleration like you do in road racing. Generally, for all ovals (assuming you can't drive them flat out) you want to either just lift off the accelerator or just lightly brake (maybe 10%).  It depends on the track but often this is done just before or while turning in. Then, when appropriate (obviously depending on the track), you want to slowly start getting back on the gas, so that you don't spin the wheels (in higher powered cars) or hit the wall without having to go on and off and on and off the throttle - one smooth progression is best.   To be more specific in the case of street stocks at USA International, I was simultaneously lightly braking and turning in just before the lights that you can see at both turn 1 and turn 3. Get the car down as close to the yellow line as possible, then at about the halfway point start getting on the throttle. In this car there is not a lot of power so you can get back to full throttle fairly quickly."
iRacing,36tkto,vmaxmuffin,2,Fri May 22 07:13:24 2015 UTC,"wow that is an amazing description on what to do at that track. That should help me very much as I was doing exactly what you said, braking like it was a road course. thanks so much! cant wait to try those techniques out :)"
iRacing,36tkto,doveenigma13,4,Fri May 22 07:31:09 2015 UTC,"For street stock?  Don't downshift and learn to trail brake better. That track is all about braking and steering to keep speed, not accelerating."

iRacing,36tkto,arsenicfox,1 point,Fri May 22 02:11:32 2015 UTC,I am one of the fast ones there. Don't downshift and minimize wheelspin and slides. It kills your tyres otherwise

iRacing,36ssbw,SmkyBndt29,1 point,Thu May 21 22:06:45 2015 UTC,"Open series have longer races, higher SOF, and less packed racing.  That means more corners, more personal space, and less wrecking."

iRacing,36ssbw,RS496,0,Thu May 21 22:36:06 2015 UTC,"Additionally, the races are longer distances (at least they were back when I ran trucks). More laps = more turns = more SR gain possible. Shorter race with fewer turns means that the same incident count results in a higher SR hit."

iRacing,36ti4l,BillCuttingsOn,3,Fri May 22 00:09:08 2015 UTC,Ultimatley using any of the assists will slow you down compared to not using them so i would avoid using them at all. This inlcudes auto blip which isn't as good as going it youself but your on ovals so that autoblip isn't much of an issue. But i haven't acually used them so not sure how effective they actually are
iRacing,36ti4l,RaceBird,1 point,Fri May 22 00:17:53 2015 UTC,"okay thanks, ya im going to turn them back off it really affects my acceleration."
iRacing,36ti4l,arsenicfox,1 point,Fri May 22 00:28:44 2015 UTC,Yeah. Assists are more there as general guides not meant for speed.
iRacing,36ti4l,Mr_Pigeon,1 point,Fri May 22 01:04:11 2015 UTC,Ultimately using any of the assists will slow you down   I tried turning off auto clutch for a road course. Once.   Heel-toe braking is hard.
iRacing,36ti4l,RaceBird,1 point,Fri May 22 01:34:45 2015 UTC,"Yes i done heel toe for a while in the V8 but couldn't maintain a consistent brake pressure, although i was faster then i was with autoblip and righ foot breaking i didn't have the confidence.  So im now learning to left foot brake and blip the throttle with my right foot"
iRacing,36ti4l,Mr_Pigeon,2,Fri May 22 03:35:52 2015 UTC,I like a loose race car so right foot braking is just asking for trouble for me.   The fact of the matter is that auto clutch will probably make you faster unless you want to invest in some top notch pedals that will make heel-toe plausible.
iRacing,36ti4l,trackday,1 point,Fri May 22 12:38:06 2015 UTC,"None of the cars require heal-toe to downshift manually without assists.

iRacing,36py0r,someoneinsane,1 point,Thu May 21 15:58:52 2015 UTC,It's really popular among a lot of people in these series. Some people who usually are at the front but are not consistent complain about it.  Will probably make more sense when they use Dynamic weather and other various things. :)
iRacing,36pty7,RS496,3,Thu May 21 04:02:05 2015 UTC,"Whatever makes you happy, some are able to run both but it will require more time to practise. I tried running both but found it difficult to adapt between the two. But one thing by running both it will cost you more money as you will need to buy both the road and oval tracks (not to mention cars) and if you race enough you will need just about every track as they rotate."

iRacing,36pty7,Eburon,1 point,Thu May 21 18:45:37 2015 UTC,One of the major reasons for choosing oval (if you like both sides) is that you don't need to put as much practice in to run up front
iRacing,36pty7,RealPleh,1 point,Thu May 21 06:21:20 2015 UTC,"This.   Ovals are very much based on rhythm so once you have a line and a set up you can go pretty fast and be competitive.   There are so many variables in road racing that rhythm is not as important, neither is set up, but personally I find race craft to be the real winner.  I race both with an A licence, I have aspirations of becoming pro in both within the next year so it is possible to do both and do them both well."
iRacing,36pty7,TOAST2218,-1,Thu May 21 15:25:56 2015 UTC,I feel oval is more toxic during crashes as in people being angry when they put themselves in stupid situations. Road people tend tp just shrug it off if it was not intentional and keep racing.
iRacing,36pty7,AndyBatch,3,Thu May 21 13:18:17 2015 UTC,I feel road racing is just as bad. Plenty of times have I seen fingers being pointed post incident. Toxicity and type of racing are mutually exclusive.

iRacing,36mpfy,tunka60,2,Wed May 20 14:48:03 2015 UTC,Are you trying to get the best frame rate? No way to help you without knowing your system but it goes without saying that the lower the graphics settings the higher the framerate.
iRacing,36mpfy,nomofica,2,Wed May 20 15:03:55 2015 UTC,Sorry!  My system  iMac mid 2011 bootcamping win 7 100 GB partitioned Processor i5 2.7 GHz Video ATI / AMD (Radeon  6770M with 512MB Screen 27 in; 2560x1440 RAM 4GB  in the sim i have all checked except mirror and shadows and run steady at 60~70 FPS
iRacing,36mpfy,shadowofashadow,2,Wed May 20 15:20:09 2015 UTC,"60fps is just fine. The biggest thing you want to avoid is changes in frame rate, so it's best to limit yourself to the typical lower end of your FPS.  If you're steady around 60-70 I'd just limit it at 60. Or reduce some graphic options like crowd detail and lock it around 70."
iRacing,36mpfy,arsenicfox,3,Wed May 20 18:21:34 2015 UTC,"I would personally say anything above 60. 144fps on a 144hz monitor is pretty awesome too. Because it is important. I personally run at 130fps~ on a 60hz monitor. Seems to help with inputs too. But much higher is kind of a law of diminishing returns at that point.  You can get away at 30fps though but at 150+ mph, there is math to show that the frames can differ by almost a few feet/meters. =/ Which isn't good."
iRacing,36mpfy,Revenant_40,0,Wed May 20 15:03:15 2015 UTC,"I'd have to disagree that you can realistically get away with anything under 60. I don't have the source to link but there are some threads somewhere in the iRacing forums where one of the devs talks about how in iRacing (as in a number of other racing sims) steering input lag is tied to FPS.  There is a technical explanation to this in terms of refresh rate that I can't recall the specifics of, but generally, the lower you go with FPS the more likely input lag will creep in. And that is true input lag, not just a pseudo lag because in one moment you're seeing your car in one spot and in the next instance it's somewhere else with nothing in between.  Upshot being if you stick above 60 (and ideally 80+) then input lag won't be an issue.  But for OP, I average between 80 and 140 depending on track, cars etc, and sometimes in rare extreme circumstances get down to 60 (triple screens), and while it's visually noticeable when it happens, it won't kill a race."
iRacing,36mpfy,arsenicfox,2,Fri May 22 04:02:22 2015 UTC,Oh this is true. Just... 30FPS is the minimum I would ever consider racing with....  (And I hit 144 :P)
iRacing,36nodh,Frostav,10,Wed May 20 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"I feel for you, as I know getting taken out in a race is irritating but it's getting pretty tiresome to hear someone get wrecked and then come whinge about now ""no one knows how to drive in this game"".  Try racing on public servers on any other sim and see how you get on. Part of racing is learning to choose your battles and sense when those around you need some extra space. Sure you'll never be 100% in the clear of idiots, but I have been at it for almost 10 years, almost 7 years just on iRacing with about 350 races and I have to think back pretty hard to the last time I got wrecked by a foolish move. I think it was 1-2 months ago in a GT3 sprint race at Road America. I've raced in 7 or 8 3-hour GT3 races (by myself) and have yet to be taken out by a foolish move in any of those. Several of them were 40-50 car grids. Yep, there WERE wrecks on track, but somehow I always manage to not get caught up in them. After a while, you have to see that I'm not just getting lucky every single time.  Anyway, sorry for turning your rant into my own rant, but it's kind of a tired rant to just say ""people cannot drive"". You landed in a race with a few tools. If you think it was blatant, protest it. Now dust off that skippy and go try again unless you're ready to quit.   first skippy race   and   (I) spin out in turn 9   If you hadn't spun out, you wouldn't have been hit...

iRacing,36nodh,fuzzyfuzz,2,Thu May 21 00:08:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, you hold the brakes to stop, but it is not ideal in the middle of the track.  The skip car is VERY hard to avoid a collision in at speed as it is fairly slippery.  As another posted, it's racing, this happens sometimes.  This is not what every race is like.  Further more, the skip series is a low license level, so you need to be in one of the top splits to avoid the new guys.    If you are fast, qualify and race with the fast and skilled drivers."
iRacing,36nodh,mav3r1ck92691,2,Wed May 20 20:33:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the skip is hard to suddenly change direction while at speed as it doesn't like the sudden shifts in weight accross it. I had a race back at Summit Point and the car in front spun so i rolled off the throttle to avoid and all i did was rotate my own car and crashed into him. Would have been better off to carry the same speed as normal and may have avoided him."

iRacing,36hr1j,MixMastaPJ,3,Tue May 19 14:02:45 2015 UTC,"I've tried using the DK2 for other racing sims and while it's definitely usable I found the eyestrain that comes from trying to focus on something blurry too much to use it in practice. The blurriness in general makes it hard to really see what's happening as you look out ahead on the track.  There's also the issue that you rely on you periphery a lot when driving in real life, but the Oculus' peripheral vision isn't that great. You'll have to turn your head further towards whatever you want to glance at than you would in real life.  Because of the resolution issue in particular I have a hard time recommending the DK2 to just anybody. If you're dead set on getting a DK2, be aware the consumer version of the Oculus Rift is coming out Q1 2016 which is supposed to be a massive improvement in every single way."
iRacing,36hr1j,Why485,6,Tue May 19 16:10:57 2015 UTC,"I race IRL. I got iRacing to help with training and went out and bought a nice big single monitor.  The single monitor, for me, was unusable. You cant look ahead through the turns like you're supposed to and its really hard to make any kind of speed/distance judgement. I got really frustrated that I just wasted so much money.  So I bought a rift DK2 and ...WOW. That is what real racing is like. I couldn't be happier.  You'll want to buy the best videocard/cpu you can afford. I asked people in this sub to help me build a gaming PC in december and this is what they recommended.  http://www.reddit.com/r/simracing/comments/2os5jx/build_a_dedicated_pc_for_iracing_for_1k_15k_for/  Hope this helps!"
iRacing,36hr1j,Shiftgood,2,Tue May 19 15:17:24 2015 UTC,"Wow, this review really makes me want to go DK2 now... does the lower resolution really make that big of a difference seeing things up ahead?"
iRacing,36hr1j,welded_sheep,3,Tue May 19 15:19:41 2015 UTC,I really wouldn't buy a dk2 when commercial releases of VR kits are due by the end of the year. Heck the consumer rift is less than a year away. Alot of money to throw at something that's a placeholder Lots of the top drivers have nothing more than Dfgt and a single monitor. Just food for thought.
iRacing,36hr1j,thefool808,1 point,Tue May 19 16:12:15 2015 UTC,"The low resolution makes it harder to see far in the distance, which makes learning new tracks a bit harder.  Once you know a track it isn't a problem for driving, but it's still noticeable and doesn't quite look awesome.  Doesn't matter to me, though.  I choose my rift over my monitor every race.  It really gives a better sense of speed and (obviously) immersion.  The consumer one will be out around Q1 2016, so at that point you'll be buying another one and putting the $350 DK2 on the shelf.  It's your call if you want to spend the money again that soon.  My suggestion would be to play with a monitor until you get used to iRacing and get used to the tracks and series you want to play."

As for hardware, just get an i5 4690K and an R9 280 or GTX 960 for the minimum graphics.  There's a lot of room for lower specs of that's too expensive."

So bumping up to a 700 or 800 series should be good to get what you want. iRacing isn't as graphics intense as top AAA titles so you can do well without top of the line hardware.
iRacing,36biu7,HerpDerpenberg,2,Mon May 18 03:51:19 2015 UTC,i5 4690k and 970 with same monitors everything just about maxed except grandstand and off track stuff.  The gsync makes a world of difference.   There are 970's with triple Dr and can be found at a discount after the whole fiasco.
iRacing,36biu7,firststate,1 point,Mon May 18 03:52:51 2015 UTC,"I'm running 3 ROG Swifts on a single 980. I had to get this one because it was the only one I could find with 3x DP that could also run an accessory display off the DVI. The 970 will likely be enough, but you might not be able to connect all of the displays or enable G-Sync if you don't have 3x DP."
iRacing,36biu7,WePwnTheSky,1 point,Mon May 18 01:29:47 2015 UTC,The one I was looking at getting does have 3x DP connections along with an HDMI and DVI connection just in case I want to use a fourth monitor later.  What kind of frame rates are you getting on the single 980 and what settings are you running?
iRacing,36biu7,WePwnTheSky,1 point,Mon May 18 01:39:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on the track. Some of the older ones run at +100fps or at the 144fps frame limit, others I've seen drop me as low as 60fps with a full field on track. The thing is, with G-Sync enabled, it doesn't really make any difference. It all feels incredibly fluid. This is all with my settings maxed out on a i7 4790k and no overclock."

iRacing,36biu7,taxcheat,2,Mon May 18 08:13:37 2015 UTC,"It depends on the monitor's frequency range, but generally the frame rate can dip to ~35fps or so without stuttering on gysnc. (I use one Acer 4k gsync)"

The 290 was enough for consistent 80 fps most of the time aside from a few dips into the 40s.  30s never happened.  I'd say for triple 1440p you want either a 295x2 or 980 to keep it above 60 fps."
iRacing,36biu7,DiscGolfer947,1 point,Mon May 18 19:09:10 2015 UTC,With everything completely maxed out my 970 keeps over 80 about 95% of the time.  With tweaking it stays pinned at 100fps (where I have it capped). And that is for triple 1080p screens.  I would say you would be better off with a 980 for triple screens at 1440p.
iRacing,369bgh,maneaserban,3,Sun May 17 12:59:01 2015 UTC,"I literally just made my first reddit account just and comment on this read. Been a long long time lurker here and now it's time to give back.   You can and I am running two 23"" monitors and one 4k 28"" monitor on a gtx650 ti boost in a triple screen setup. This setup works in AC as well as iracing. It was not easy as LightningWing mentioned most people think it is impossible. I has able to do this using the nVidia control panel but first setting my 4k monitor to 1080 then telling the video card that all three monitors should be seen as one monitor. My resolution is now 3840x1080 and it works with these games.   To answer the OP's question yes the different sized monitor thing works but it's weird. I have my 24's moved about 6 inches forward with a slight 5 degree angle on them so when I lean back in my chair the sides of the monitor look the same size as the further back 28"". It did take a couple hours to get used to the different depths and I think the further back you sit the better (as it negates the difference in depth). OP you should really go for it, it is night and day having a large FOV but if you have more patience than I do wait for the VR tech to come out in in 6 months. Your going to spend $150 on this monitor for in imperfect setup when you could save that money and put it toward a new VR headset which will hopefully revolutionize sim racing.   Finally I just want to say thanks to the sim racing community, you guys on here are freakin awesome!"
iRacing,369bgh,FastCarsAndSlowWomen,2,Sun May 17 18:33:33 2015 UTC,"I looked into this a while back. You want everything to look correct, almost like you had three 27"" monitors, but the outside two are covered up and only show 24"".  There is a way to do this with SoftTH, and it shouldn't be too hard because they are all the same resolution.    You can setup softTH like you had qty-3 27"" monitors, then tell it where you positioned the two 24"" monitors. That way the image and scale will be correct for the 24"" monitors.    I don't have time to dig through my bookmarks right now.  If you want more info, let me know and I'll take the time to see if I saved the page."

It wouldn't work..  and it took me a while to understand why.   Look up monitor polarity on google.  Turns out if you want a surround setup to work your monitors needs to have the same polarity.  (basically  it's like bloodtypes for monitor). Lots of people will tell you theres no problem because those people got lucky and the monitors they mixed together happened to have the right polarities.
iRacing,369bgh,Patbach,-6,Tue May 19 06:37:29 2015 UTC,"you can do this, but it would require an AMD card. Nvidia doesn't allow for mixing resolutions.   i'm not sure if the side monitors would scale up to match the size of the 27"".

I would say that it's no problem in the rookies, just yield when close racing even up to D-class racing. If you're sensible, as in using the brakes when somebody crashes in front of you, even if that means giving up a few spots, you can be better than half of the pack.  But the main thing why I would recommend looking for a cheap steering wheel on second hand markets, is the fact that only then you'll get a sense of what simracing is about. It's like playing baseball with a tennis racket so you can hit the ball, but is it still baseball? Simracing is one of these things that needs a little commitment and adjustment because it's so different from what others claim to be racing games."

iRacing,366z2j,True_Racer,3,Sun May 17 01:03:14 2015 UTC,Welcome to iRacing. You can use a controller but it does put you at a big disadvantage. Charlotte may not to bad with the controller but once you get into some more of the technical oval stuff you will start to struggle.
iRacing,366z2j,arsenicfox,2,Sat May 16 19:42:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I'm definitely having more trouble with the short tracks, but the more I practice the better I run. I'm having the same trouble at them with not using the full range of the analog stick with steering, resulting in less precision and a more twitchy feel. If I can get that figured out I'd be in better shape, that's for sure."
iRacing,366z2j,Mr_Pigeon,1 point,Sat May 16 20:11:35 2015 UTC,Get a g27. $200ish will provide you with years of awesome. You won't regret it. At least not till you try the higher end wheels. Great entry level tho. :)
iRacing,366z2j,arsenicfox,1 point,Sat May 16 20:51:13 2015 UTC,I just moved up from a Momo to a G27 after 4 years in iRacing. Holy shit is it easier to drive these cars with a proper wheel. I never thought I needed it until I saw one for $150 a few weeks back and jumped on it. I'm averaging 15% better lap times so far cause I can loosen up so much more.
iRacing,366z2j,Mr_Pigeon,1 point,Sat May 16 21:23:56 2015 UTC,Equipment is important. ;) I'm upgrading to a fanatec wheel soon. Got the club sport elite pedals.Way better than the stock g27 pedals.
iRacing,366z2j,teh_cheat,1 point,Sat May 16 21:33:22 2015 UTC,Yeah the brake pedal on the G27 is stupid stiff. I would be making some adjustments if my IRL car had a pedal like that.  Otherwise they're pretty solid and extremely accurate.
iRacing,366z2j,Mr_Pigeon,1 point,Sun May 17 15:39:34 2015 UTC,"Whaaaat? Stock g27 pedals are all super easy to press compared to real cars. Maybe full g27 force is more than your average ""easy braking for a stoplight"" in your street car but you would probably have to put a fair bit more pressure in to lock up."
iRacing,366z2j,teh_cheat,1 point,Mon May 18 15:40:08 2015 UTC,Okay is my load cell messed up or something? Cause it's way harder then my friends CSR pedals... And much harder than any late model I've raced.
iRacing,366z2j,Mr_Pigeon,2,Mon May 18 18:17:17 2015 UTC,I run my cspv2s to the max potential of the load cell; I did some approximate moment arm calculations and if the load cells are 50kg the max braking force at the center of the pedal is about 60 lbs including my damper/spring from an rc car fully preloaded. I run them this way because if there are 1024 steps between full and null and you've got it set up for say 10 lb max and mine is at 60 lb to be as precise in braking as me you have to have 6x as good pressure sense in your leg as me.   I also believe lots of the cars I race (vintage f1 and other downforce cars) have brake pressures in real life that exceed my pedals capabilities so I'm shooting for realism as well.
iRacing,366z2j,LastImmortalMan,1 point,Mon May 18 21:10:40 2015 UTC,Well I'm not sure how to calculate it but I rested a 100lb dumb bell on the pedal and it pushed it in about 1/3 of the way. I have to use probably 80% of my full arm strength to push it in with my hand.
iRacing,366z2j,bozboy204,2,Tue May 19 15:15:41 2015 UTC,"Race with a stick until you can save up for a wheel! As long as you feel you are being safe on track and not racing over the technical limits of the controllers input then you should be fine for now!   If you wanted to ever venture into serious road stuff you will need a wheel though, and triple monitors eventually!  IRacing is not a cheap game to begin with, if you stay with it then don't compromise on your input method as they provide so much valuable feedback!"
iRacing,366z2j,bozboy204,1 point,Sat May 16 20:22:50 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the site and good luck in your races. To answer your questions:  1) You absolutely should get a wheel and pedals. The difference in the amount of control you can have over your car with a wheel is incredible. There are just so many small adjustments you can make with a wheel that are much harder to pull off with a controller. I played Forza and other racing games with a controller for years, and looking back I don't know how I was able to do it.   A controller also makes it much easier for you to hold your line, which is incredibly important on the oval side when you are racing two wide. If you can't hold your line (staying high, or staying low and not pushing up), you'll cause wrecks that you could have avoided with a wheel. Getting out of rookies is probably 90 percent avoiding wrecks, don't make your job any harder.   2) Back when I was running rookie street stock, my qualifying time was 37.443. This seemed to be about an average time, so I'd say you have some more time that you could shave off. SS at Charlotte is all about hugging the inside line as tight as you can. In the actual SS races at Charlotte it is nearly impossible to pass someone if they hold the inside throughout."
iRacing,36671n,Rimio,11,Sat May 16 15:18:27 2015 UTC,"I doubt it was intentional. Intentionally trying to wreck someone usually ends up with the offender in the grass/wall as well, and going off at that spot is a death sentence.  Also, the Miatas like to be blipped on downshifts. That may be what happened there.  I would mark this one up to stupidity."
iRacing,36671n,Speedly,3,Sat May 16 15:56:09 2015 UTC,"This is just driving without enough practice and experience, it happens. BUT if you had more experience and practice he wouldn't be nowhere near you to ram you. It goes both ways"
iRacing,36671n,Eburon,1 point,Sat May 16 20:45:05 2015 UTC,"As I said, he was so close to me because of a mistake I made earlier. So yes, technically, if I had more experience and had not screwed up, he wouldn't have been there. But your logic suggests that in order for me not to be at fault I should be the fastest driver on the grid, so no one could stay on my butt."
iRacing,36671n,Eburon,1 point,Sat May 16 20:54:09 2015 UTC,"Well yes, if you don't want drivers unable to handle situations like that close to you. When you practice enough, you're fast enough to race among drivers who won't hit you there. But we've all been there you know, most crashes are avoidable, even if you're not at fault."
iRacing,36671n,kaluh_glarski,1 point,Sat May 16 21:04:34 2015 UTC,"It's not the most helpful advice, but it's the truest you'll find in rookies unfortunately. Any rookie can know all of their braking points absolutely perfectly on an empty track. Throw a car in front of them and some folks quickly forget where they are and get locked in on the car in front of them.  It happens, but that's why we keep practicing our race craft :)"
iRacing,36671n,ARfandude,2,Sun May 17 14:14:45 2015 UTC,"My point of view....when I'm not near another car I have the throttle pinned through that right hander. The car will get loose and hard braking makes the car aim right so I'll blip the throttle to get it to aim left ready for the left hander. I don't do it when there's other cars nearby because I use a lot of the track doing that. That driver didn't have enough space between you and him to get slowed. Just a small mistake on his part, not intentional."
iRacing,36671n,XxHaagxX,3,Sat May 16 19:56:11 2015 UTC,"I haven't mastered that corner that well :). It works ~80-90% of the time for me, which is too dangerous for race conditions, so I prefer to lift.  I was a bit mild on that corner, tho."

But then, looking at the replay I noticed the guy actually braked then gave it a little gas, hit me and just coasted on the outside of the corner.  Should I have stayed on the inside and let him pass? It seems overly defensive, but I'm getting the feeling that's how I have to be in rookies. I hope D will be a little better."
iRacing,36671n,schtick01101,4,Sat May 16 15:34:39 2015 UTC,"I would have let him pass, but I never win races either. As long as I finish I am happy."

iRacing,36671n,jrebs,5,Sat May 23 00:32:37 2015 UTC,"Two things   Staying inside there is actually the fast line through that corner. Unless you noticed this driver bring overly reckless or making many mistakes like this before you there's little you can do in this situation. If your goal is simply ""how could I avoid the 4x here"" here's what I would have done.   I would have noticed him gaining on me way to fast under braking and I would have lifted my foot off the brake. Yes I'd run way wide and lose time and a position but I'd only get 1x. When a driver makes a mistake this badly around you sometimes some sort of incident point is unavoidable."

iRacing,360ox0,Memn0n,8,Sat May 16 15:36:47 2015 UTC,"Racing after less than a week is a pretty quick start! I took longer than that. Spend more time practicing so you are more confident with the car and track, but also find populated practice sessions so you can get used to driving with other cars on track, without the consequences of hurting other peoples races/iR/SR. Once you are more comfortable driving with other cars, go racing again. You will still be a bit nervous, but that's part of why iRacing is so appealing, I just don't get that feeling from other sims but I always get a little nervous before races in iRacing."
iRacing,360ox0,david-4,7,Fri May 15 04:29:21 2015 UTC,"I definitely understand your frustrations. You're right, not everyone is cut out for road racing. Everybody has their preferred discipline. However, I'd urge you not to give up after only a couple races. I was abysmal my first 4 or 5 races with the miata when I first started, and though I'm nowhere near a pro, I've gotten to the point where I can race enjoyably. Just a couple words of advice here.   People are gonna wreck you, especially in the rookie series. That's just something you have to accept and realize that while frustrating, it doesn't mean you're a bad driver. Also, you're right, practicing the track is a great idea. But remember that you're doing so alone, and therefore only practicing the ideal line. Next time, try practicing going really wide on some corners, racing off the line, etc. Practice that and you'll find that no matter where you are on the track or who is around you, you'll be able to adapt.   As far as getting lapped, the best advice I can give is to be predictable. You're already miles ahead of most rookies since you do let the leaders past. On road courses the best place to do this is the straights. If you see someone coming up while you're entering a corner, just come out if the corner off the racing line and slow down a bit to let them by. No worrying about flying off the corner or ruining their braking points.  Just keep at it and I guarantee you'll get better and enjoy it a lot more! I love oval racing, but sometimes I just have that unshakable desire to turn right :)"
iRacing,360ox0,modern_knight,6,Fri May 15 02:52:28 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I got iRacing to road race, having little interest in ovals. I just tried ovals one day (Rookie Street Stock) and found them surprisingly fun and a lot easier to drive so I've been doing them more often than road races."

iRacing,360ox0,GT86,4,Fri May 15 03:38:31 2015 UTC,Try running the inside and far outside lines on some corners. To give you and idea of what to expect when making a pass or being passed in terms of the difference in corner speed / grip.
iRacing,360ox0,allgood2386,5,Fri May 15 07:33:43 2015 UTC,"Took me over 2000 miles of racing before I could really pass or be passed with consistency. If the guy in the back hits you and your slowing down ultimately its their fault. Yes you should be doing your best to get over but leaders need to learn to have patients in traffic and to be frank 99% of the people your racing are not that good to care about that time.   Don't be frustrated, it's very very hard but once you get it down a bit, well it's still hard but you can complete races most of the time.  Edit: Also I think your batshit insane, how is racing 3 wide for 80% of a race with a spotter screaming still on the right still on the right less stressful to raod racing where after the 2nd or 3rd lap you usually have at least 2 seconds of space either way ;) It isn't you just need to be more confident in yourself and get a few more laps in. The part I definitly think you need more of is practice. Ovals, very easy to get into, but very very difficult to be fast. Roads,  hard to get into but easier to be fast (in lower splits).  Edit 2: And as a beginner in rookie splits don't worry about letting them get around you in or before the corner. Take your line as normal CAREFULLY check the the leader isn't going around the long way after the corner then move over and tap the brakes or just tap the brakes and let them get around(and I mean tap)."
iRacing,360ox0,Obesity_,3,Fri May 15 10:59:22 2015 UTC,Maybe try not to stress out so much about what the leaders are doing. You don't have to throw your race away just to let them past.  I'd say just take your lines into the corner and let them past on the straights. Remember it's their responsibility to make the pass safely.   Also I'm just starting out as well. I had some good finishes the first couple of races but the last couple I have finished at least a lap down after tangles with other cars. All you can do is make sure you can drive the track properly and if other people wreck you that's just how it goes. I know the frustration though.
iRacing,360ox0,Opiate_of_the_Massas,2,Fri May 15 04:08:26 2015 UTC,"Please don't give up!  You have a great attitude for racing. You might try some live practice sessions where you can just cruise around and let people overtake you to get a feel for it. What helped me the most were time trials.  Time trials force you to avoid incidents at all cost.  This really helps develop car control and before you know it your lap times will start tumbling.    Keep at it and have fun, man!"
iRacing,360ox0,bozboy204,2,Fri May 15 05:19:27 2015 UTC,"There is much more preparation and practice required to be competitive in a road race compared to oval. This isn't saying that oval racing doesn't require skill, it very much does. It is just the fact that there are more opportunities to lose control of the car, miss a braking point, push wide, etc..., than there are in an oval. Rookies road does a good job of showing you how much harder it is than you thought.   There is a great video emptybox has on youtube about learning a new track. In it he talks about how in order for him to feel comfortable on a new track, it takes him several hours of practice for a road course, and under an hour for an oval; and this is for a guy who has years and years of practice sim racing.   I would recommend first looking at results of races in your series (in this case, Rookie Mazda Cup). Look at the fastest laps and average laps that the drivers are putting in. Try and get your times as close as you can to those numbers. There are video guides on youtube for the MX-5 which do a turn by turn walk through that discuss the line, braking points and other general tips. Get comfortable with the car and the track.   Others have recommended open practice sessions where you can practice with other drivers on the track. This is great advice as you can practice passing/being passed, and following someone close without wrecking. If you screw up, it won't affect your ratings. Do these sessions until you feel less nervous with cars around you.   It may seem like a lot of work and practice just to run in an official race and it is. This is what most of the competitive racers out there are doing for all the series. A lot of people take iracing very seriously, especially once you get out of rookies and are into the paid content.   You seem to have the right mindset for iracing. It can be a lot of work to be competitive, but the reward is real. Few games can match the feeling iracing gives you for pulling off a good pass or getting a good result in a tight race."
iRacing,360ox0,WhyDoISuckAtW2,2,Fri May 15 09:42:47 2015 UTC,"Can you post a replay or video of your driving? I can give you some pointers.  The main thing about sim racing that makes it difficult is that you can't feel the weight transfer, so you need to rely on FFB, sound, and straight up experience to get an idea of what each tire is doing.  The miata can be hard to spot when it is having issues. Have you tried the Skip Barber? The ability to see the suspension moving around gives you a better idea of the weight transfer happening, AND the car is setup so that weight transfer has a huge effect on the grip of the tires. I highly recommend using it. It's difficult but it really forces you to learn what's going on."
iRacing,360ox0,allgood2386,3,Fri May 15 09:51:38 2015 UTC,Gotta get out of rookies to get into barber. Also I wouldn't say the skippy is easy to drive.... in fact I'd say it's horrible to drive(and why I recommend it for every one coming out of rookies). You get a better idea of weight transfer because if you let off the gas you go into a spin imo ;)  I'd say get decent on the mx5 and take a few podiums then move on to skippy when you have a little bit of confidence because it will surly be wrecked in t1/2 of limerock =)
iRacing,360ox0,LastImmortalMan,1 point,Fri May 15 11:11:53 2015 UTC,"The skippy is a student car though, it teaches a lot of different aspects of racing and does it with low aero and no setup requirements so that the racers can focus on the actual racing and not the setup.  The biggest leap for the Skippy is learning how to race with open wheel cars, bumping usually ends in the wall where it is a lot safer to do in the Mazda.  You definitely get a better idea of weight transfer and understanding the load on the tyres initially in the Mazda though and I still think it is a great car to learn on and become consistent with before moving on to the skippy."

I think you need to spend more time practicing different lines and car control.  I've heard doing 2-300 practice laps is not unusual. Think of it like real life, you wouldn't be doing side to side racing until you're well experienced."
iRacing,360ox0,LastImmortalMan,1 point,Fri May 15 11:48:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even if I've raced at a track before and consider myself experienced I still go around the whole track on just outside and just inside lines during practice to learn different techniques and attack points. Knowing how to be quick in the least optimal circumstance is great for rookie practice (avoiding other rookies does not give optimal lines)."
iRacing,360ox0,Nevil-Clavain,2,Sat May 16 00:37:03 2015 UTC,I would recommend to stop trying to go fast and just go safe. Learn how not to crash and get out of rookies as fast as possible.

You have to learn when you need to pull out of a battle or concede corners where as with the Mazda you can squeeze it into a lot of places it probably should not be."
iRacing,360ox0,ADT_Clone,2,Sat May 16 00:38:38 2015 UTC,"The only way to improve is to keep racing, make mistakes and learn from those mistakes.  It takes years before you can be fully confident with all aspects of a road race."
iRacing,360ox0,FragginDragon,2,Fri May 15 13:47:20 2015 UTC,"A little tip that helped me in rookies. When you're on the grid, try and make a routine. In rookies my routine was this;  1) Hit F4 and F5 and TURN OFF re-fuelling and tire swaps (even if you wreck in rookies you'll almost never need them). 2) Wait calmly until the lights come up.  3) Once the lights are on screen shift into gear 4) Once the lights turn on start revving  I actually practiced this 10+ times in private sessions to get me comfortable with starts, as well as driving a few laps deliberately off line at each track to get comfortable with it (learn the braking points etc).  As for being wrecked by people passing you, that's to be expected in rookie. You're getting passed by fast people who don't necessarily have full control of their car. Scary, eh? The best thing you can do is stay on line and let get the other person to drive around you on the straights. Being predictable is more important than getting out of the way. Blue flags are for information in iRacing as much as people scream about them not being that."
iRacing,360ox0,shadowofashadow,1 point,Fri May 15 13:57:34 2015 UTC,So does that F4 and F5 thing limit what will be done in pit stops? I'm assuming that if you do this and then need to pit it will only be for car damage?

iRacing,360ox0,rancer890,2,Sat May 16 00:40:52 2015 UTC,"OP, don't feel so bad you suck at road racing. From personal experience, I felt I was bad too at road racing. Made the first mistake of just jumping into a race (oooops XD) without much practice and ended up ruining my irating, my SR, and my confidence. I think my road iRating went down to 835 (that's pretty bad) and was around 1100 when I just quit road racing for 6 weeks last season and went to ovals exclusively.   I went as high as 1976 (I got 300 iRating from my Gateway races in the National Impala and IndyCar) then my oval iRating went down to my current level, 1674.   Haven't raced much oval (well, not as much as last season), but lots of road racing! Proud to say I'm at 1769 and hopeful to reach 2k road.  So TL;DR, take a break from road racing, learn some oval racecraft (you learn a lot about racing side by side in close quarters) and you can take the information you learn from ovals back onto the road side. If it can work for me, it can work for you."
iRacing,360ox0,_Shorty,2,Fri May 15 14:38:35 2015 UTC,"Practice, practice, practice. I've been on iRacing since 2009 and I still get nervous sitting on the starting grid every single time. Sounds like you just need more seat time to get into the swing of things. The more familiar you get with a car the less you have to think about driving it. That lets you concentrate more on the other cars around you without worrying about yourself. And the only way to gain that familiarity is to practice, practice, practice. Don't give up. Just drive even more. ;)"

I completely understand how you feel, even though I'm already a C class driver, I managed to wreck another driver in the Skip Barbers because they were ridiculously slow during the second to last corner at Oran Park today. I became ridiculously frustrated at myself for not having any patience in what for me was a flat out corner.  Just take a little break from iRacing for a few days and come back to it refreshed, see if that makes a difference, it did for me in rookies."
iRacing,360ox0,Memn0n,1 point,Fri May 15 04:03:17 2015 UTC,"What I usually do if I see someone much faster coming, or someone lapping me, coming much closer right before a corner, I usually keep my line into the corner but try to let him by at the end of the corner by going wider or hugging the inside line after the apex and not accelerating until he's next to me or has completely passed me (depending on the track/corner)."
iRacing,360ox0,Gus_TheAnt,1 point,Fri May 15 07:55:21 2015 UTC,"In my experience people are cut out for ovals or road. That's not to say you can't do both and be good, but a lot of racers are more inclined to one or the other."
iRacing,360ox0,P-Nuts,1 point,Fri May 15 08:26:11 2015 UTC,Don't race until you can turn the entire race distance in practice with no incidents (except maybe the odd 1x where the track limits are particularly strict) and all your lap times are within ±0.5s of your average.  Don't worry so much about chasing the last few seconds of lap time until you're really consistent.
iRacing,360ox0,randomkontot,1 point,Fri May 15 09:36:29 2015 UTC,"Don't be so rushed to let leaders past you. You don't need to let them through when it's a bad time to do so (i.e. in a corner complex etc). Just wait for the next straight and very obviously switch to the other side of the road from them and ease of the throttle to let them pass you. Also check your mirrors. If the guy behind you seems to swap sides to pass you, obviously you stay where you are. Unless you're horribly slow though, the faster car isn't likely to be able to get inside you before he can see that you're moving over.  But yeah, if there isn't a good time to let them past you, then stick to what you're doing to stay out of harms way. It's their responsibility to pass you safely, EVEN if blue flags are waving."
iRacing,360ox0,Steepslider,1 point,Fri May 15 13:05:23 2015 UTC,"Go slow to go fast, later on (as I like to say).  Start practices at a good pace but not to a racing pace.  Learn what the car does or doesn't do, play with it.  Practice alone .... without other cars on the track.  Crash a 1000 times but learn a bit with each.  With time and watching the iRacing videos you will start to understand why the car does what it does.  Slowing increase your speed while keeping good form.  When you can do this start practising with others.  Try practices and races early in the morning when there are fewer cars racing.  There will be less carnage and more room.  Your confidence will slowly climb.  Focus is key for racing and focus only comes with successful practice/racing.  You will find your focus improving and nerves diminishing.  Don't give up and remember to smile."

The problem with oculus is that it still looks like you're looking through a keyhole and doesn't fill your entire FOV.

iRacing,35uq4f,hikinkycat,7,Thu May 14 17:11:50 2015 UTC,That was actually one of the most realistic looking wrecks I've seen on iRacing from a physics standpoint. No one barrel rolled at 5000 rpm or went flying into the stratosphere.
iRacing,35uq4f,racefan78,3,Wed May 13 19:16:15 2015 UTC,A lot of racing sims really do seem to phone in the crash physics especially when cars get airborne (I guess it's because that's a really rare situation in a normal race). BeamNG is the only sim I've seen where cars actually behave realistically when airborne.
iRacing,35uq4f,MysticalMuffDiver,3,Wed May 13 19:38:45 2015 UTC,My favorite part is the dude in the white car who bumped me and then somehow wrecked half the field while I drove off.  Getting through this race with no incidents felt amazing after a terrible Mazda cup race wherein I had 15 incidents (I can't drive worth a damn and this game is awful for my nerves). Oval racing is a lot less stressful.
iRacing,35uq4f,MysticalMuffDiver,1 point,Wed May 13 17:53:23 2015 UTC,Are you using a controller?   I'm new to iRacing but I have made B license on the road since the beginning of season 2. I'd be happy to practice with you and offer some advice.
iRacing,35uq4f,MysticalMuffDiver,1 point,Wed May 13 18:11:47 2015 UTC,"No, I use a G27. However, I use the paddles with the auto-blip aid on (no other aids); I can use the shifter just fine, but I can't get it to work with iRacing. I also don't use the clutch for that matter--learning how to manipulate the throttle and brake along with the wheel and possibly the H-box is enough of a challenge already! I plan to use the clutch eventually, but remembering all that footwork is a little overwhelming.  I've only had this wheel for less than a week though."
iRacing,35uq4f,Poison_Pancakes,2,Wed May 13 18:14:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't use the H-shifter on my g27 either. I like the paddles. If you are actually interested in getting back on the road, send me a PM and I'll add you to run some practice.   Remember slow in fast out!"
iRacing,35uq4f,FragginDragon,1 point,Wed May 13 18:17:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll think of sending you a PM later.  I know basic driving skills--even before I had a wheel I played sims like Rfactor and Assetto Corsa on a gamepad semi-frequently, it's really the fact that I'm in serious competition where a screw-up can result in SR dropping or fucking up the race for other racers. I get super-nervous when I'm around people and end up getting frazzled. iRacing is intense, man.  I also just plain didn't practice enough, I was braking for corners you can take flat-out and in the wrong gear nearly every corner for half the race."
iRacing,35uq4f,FragginDragon,1 point,Wed May 13 18:19:57 2015 UTC,That will definitely do it! You have to practice or you are just going to ruin someone else's race and your own. iRacing is definitely intense. My nerves used to get to me in corners but I've started to settle in nicely. The GT3 series has been good practice for building trust in other drivers.
iRacing,35uq4f,nomofica,2,Wed May 13 18:21:50 2015 UTC,"I shamelessly use paddle shifters too. To operate a manual transmission properly it's critical to be able to feel the linkage and mechanisms, and the G25/27 just isn't up to it.  Also the pedals are atrociously positioned for proper heel/toe."
iRacing,35uq4f,MWisBest,1 point,Wed May 13 20:57:46 2015 UTC,Take all of what I'm about to say with a grain of salt because the game is about having fun at the end of the day and if you aren't enjoying yourself you should just do what is fun for you;  I would recommend going through the pain of learning the H-Shifter now. You might have to do a hundred practice laps to get it somewhat down now but you won't feel like doing that once you're fast with a paddle shifter. You can also definitely be faster without aids too so try it out and learn to heel-toe.   It's pretty hard at first but when you start to make it work it is very very satisfying.
iRacing,35uq4f,screampuff,1 point,Thu May 14 03:55:22 2015 UTC,"I already know how to use the H-shifter semi-decently. It's just that iRacing wont let me set it up correctly since it demands that I set Neutral and Reverse (the G27 shifter doesn't have a dedicated reverse setting and doesn't pick up the stick in a neutral position as neutral gear). Maybe I did it wrong, I dunno.  Also I thought paddles/sequential gearboxes in general were faster, which is why practically every supercar/racing machine uses them these days."
iRacing,35uq4f,Roshki13,3,Thu May 14 04:04:52 2015 UTC,"G27 shifter does have dedicated reverse. Push (vertically) down on the shifter and move it to the bottom right corner (where 6th would be otherwise). That's where it is on mine anyways.   You're right on your second point too; Paddle shifters are almost always faster, yes, but the miata you're driving in the spec series doesn't have a sequential shifter in real life.   Paddle or H-pattern though, learning to heel toe is going to help you out in the long run. I also find it useful to skip gears in braking zones in the miata because the ratios are so close. Again though, YMMV. Play the game the way that makes you happy, I'm just offering my 2c. :) I look forward to seeing a new racer out there."
iRacing,35uq4f,TChapman500,1 point,Thu May 14 04:17:46 2015 UTC,"The G27 shifter doesn't have a dedicated reverse setting    Yes it does. Push the shifter inward and into the sixth gear slot. You really should read the manuals to things you own.    and doesn't pick up the stick in a neutral position as neutral gear)   Again, yes it does. Clutch in, neutral position, clutch out. iRacing does not require you to set a neutral gear. It requires reverse through sixth. It automatically detects neutral if no other gear has been triggered."

I skipped class C by having over a 4.0 class D for nearly an entire season, so I was able to run class B races and was immediately promoted to it. Took another week to get over 4.0 to run class A with a B license. I'm not sure if you can do that anymore. I still don't have any class C cars :)  Most of the guys running A events aren't ready to be in those races IMHO. But that doesn't mean they can't run a safer setup and get some experience mid pack. Especially 1.5 mile ovals, they're pretty easy races.  I have no regrets running class A events immediately. My first couple races were below 20th position finishes. Eventually about 6 months later I got my pro license. I was stripped of it about 2 years ago after not entering any races for an entire season - I was out of country for 4 months :(   Haven't had the time to work on getting it back since.  Closest I've ever been to relegation was having a 2.5 SR after 5 races in a row that I was wrecked on the first lap. I submitted 5 protests in response. It took about 2 weeks of passive racing to get it back to 4.7. Not fun."
iRacing,35t9pw,Rimio,6,Wed May 13 09:19:11 2015 UTC,"You're far away from being screwed. Practice alone until you can go 30 minutes without any incidents. then go into O.P. or even a race. Don't qualify, and maybe even start from the pits so you can avoid the crashes in the first few corners. from there on try to drive as consistent and clean as possible. Don't worry about your position, it's the clean driving that counts towards your SF. That way you can easily get the D class before next season.  Btw: You start with a SF of 2.50"
iRacing,35t9pw,peccadilloz,4,Wed May 13 09:35:04 2015 UTC,"Can I rant just a little bit? Stop giving the 'start from the pits advice'. All it does is helps new people shoot out of the rookie leagues and I really have no issue with that on principle but learning to start a race is a skill you SHOULD learn. I can't tell you how many times I've been rear ended on the start even in higher leagues, then look at their profile and SURPRISE it's the 8th race of their career and they are in mazdastar/indy.  I get it, I'm being a cranky old man and I really don't mean to be a dick about it but learning to start isn't something people should be skipping =/  edit: also fyi you don't need to wait for a promotion if you get your rating up to like 3.75, it will bump you up mid-season if you ever want to get into a new series =)  ./endrant"
iRacing,35t9pw,allgood2386,1 point,Wed May 13 22:25:14 2015 UTC,Rant approved. I can't believe how many people on here or the forums give this shitty advice. Learning to read other drivers in a stressful environment as a start is a vital part of racing. Don't skip it for the sake of your SR.
iRacing,35t9pw,dencker60,3,Thu May 14 10:43:36 2015 UTC,"Your safety rating is based on a basic formula: (# of incidents)/#of corners taken  As far as incidents go, you get 1x for going off track, 2x for contact with a wall or track object, and 4x for contact with another car. There is never blame assigned with incident points. It doesn't matter whose fault the contact was, all cars involved get the same 4x. There are pros and cons to this, but the idea is that it is far simpler to implement SR this way than trying to program in a way of assigning blame. If someone is intentionally wrecking or causing problems of some sort, there is a protest system where iracing will look at the replay footage and judge for themselves if the offending car should be warned, suspended or banned.   The more clean corners you take without incident, the higher your SR goes. The only other thing that matters for this calculation is what type of event you are doing. An official race has a multiplier of 1.0, unofficial .50, pre-race warmup .50, time trials and qualification .35. I could be wrong on the multipliers (and someone can correct me), but you get the idea.   In a typical rookies road race, you can expect to gain about .15 SR per race if you get 0 incidents. I don't know what the break even threshold for incidents is in a race with a rookie license, my guess would be somewhere between 5 and 9.   For someone just starting out, I would recommend practicing by yourself until you can run the track without any incidents (no off tracks or anything) for at least half the race distance, if not the entire race distance. For an online race you want to be comfortable enough with the car and track that you don't have to think too hard about braking/turn in points and can focus instead on the other drivers.   As many have said before me, in rookies it is more important to focus on racing clean than finishing high. If someone wants to pass in rookies, just let them pass. Odds are pretty good they'll wreck soon anyways and give you the position back. Just focus on turning clean laps consistently and your SR will get to where it needs to be (rookie 3.0) and then you'll have your D license. Once you have your D license you will never be a rookie again and your iracing career has truly started."
iRacing,35t9pw,bozboy204,1 point,Wed May 13 09:44:02 2015 UTC,"That is encouraging news :). Thanks for clearing things up.  So far I can't drive more than 4-5 laps without incident (I get too eager in optimizing a corner and spin out or cut grass). I like OP better than Test as it gets me used to traffic, but I'm considerate of other racers - since the event I managed to avoid all car contact. I help faster racers pass me and I sometimes get the treat of overtaking someone who's slower :D.  As far as I've seen, OP incidents don't affect my SR, so I should be ok with this strategy, right?"
iRacing,35t9pw,bozboy204,3,Wed May 13 09:59:58 2015 UTC,"Open practices don't affect SR, so you are free to drive in them without fear of ratings hits. Open practices are definitely good for getting used to other cars. I find that I prefer to practice by myself for a good bit until I feel I know the track before I start dealing with other cars. There is nothing wrong with your approach and the more you practice the better you'll do in you actual races."
iRacing,35t9pw,Gus_TheAnt,2,Wed May 13 10:54:44 2015 UTC,"Remember that in a race its better to finish three laps down with no incidents rather than try and push it too hard and wreck yourself and others just to finish high in Rookies. Qualifying and finishing position dont even matter in Rookies, its all about getting your Safety Rating up. Just practice by yourself, or with other people, whatever you prefer. Remember that a lot of people in Rookies dont realize finishing position doesnt matter, and wont give an inch and will take five and wreck you both, so give up the spot if they're coming up on you quick."
iRacing,35t9pw,Bakkster,1 point,Wed May 13 11:14:39 2015 UTC,"Your goal for the rookie series should be to complete all laps with fewer than 9 incidents total. That is safe enough to be promoted.

I could be wrong on the multipliers (and someone can correct me), but you get the idea.   I was under the impression that warmup counted pretty much like open practice, meaning it isn't counted at all. I could be wrong, but I think when you get incident points in warmup you'll notice that it doesn't show (x/17x) or whatever the incident limit for that race is."
iRacing,35t9pw,nomofica,2,Wed May 13 12:47:58 2015 UTC,"The warm up and the race are technically two different sessions, so it would not show up in the race session's incidences. They do very much count for or against you, though, and carry a weight of 0.5. The only sessions that have a 0.0 SR multiplier are private and open practices."
iRacing,35t9pw,bozboy204,2,Wed May 13 15:44:27 2015 UTC,"Warmup incidents definitely count towards SR. If you go to the bottom of a race results page you'll see there is a separate results part for the warmup and it has incidents noted as well as times. They don't count as though they were in a full race, and they won't go towards you're in race limit for incidents, but they still count towards your overall SR."

iRacing,35t9pw,Eburon,2,Wed May 13 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"People often scare you and pay way too much attention to safety rating. If you drive like one does as in real life, safetyrating hardly ever becomes an issue. Look ahead on the track, brake when you see trouble don't try to power through a wreck. Give and take with competitors, don't force yourself ahead of others, wait for the right opportunity. And know the tracks you're racing, first time on every track go in offline practice and drive a tank of fuel dry. All these things will result in a decent rating.  Surviving the rookies youtube series is one of the absolute best collections of guidelines preserving s/r."
iRacing,35t9pw,sim-racingcouk,2,Wed May 13 12:38:31 2015 UTC,"If you need to raise your SR the easiest and safest way is to do Time Trials.  Make sure you don't get any off tracks, so drive below your ability and drive for the whole 30 minute session and you will increase SR.  It's pretty boring but sometimes it just needs to be done."
iRacing,35t9pw,arsenicfox,1 point,Wed May 13 18:18:13 2015 UTC,"Also, don't forget, your SR is based on your last 100 corners/races? something like that."

That will bump of the system reqs and you'll need to get a nice computer to run all of that stuff (triples or VR).  After that you will likely want to build a cockpit or some sort of comfortable racing set up, which costs money too.  That doesn't even count the 1000$ you might spend if you really enjoy a 3-4 different racing series and want to keep up with the seasons.   Still cheaper than real world racing though, and no other game matches the online experience."
iRacing,35t0i5,someoneinsane,0,Wed May 13 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"First I would recommend you try rFactor with some mods like the Skip Barber or GT cars or any racing series that you enjoy, set everything to minimal assists.  If you can comfortably race against the AI(they're going to be a little aggressive) and you enjoy the challenge then get iRacing. You don't have to be fast, just make sure you can hold a line and not hit other cars or go offtrack. If you don't want to buy rFactor, you can also try Raceroom Racing Experience and Copa Petrobras de Marcas on Steam.  Keep in mind that sim racing games are significantly more difficult than Forza or any officially licenced NASCAR or F1 games on console. iRacing will be very frustrating in the beginning, but with practice and some patience you will soon be running clean, competitive races against other drivers with similar skills as you."

iRacing,35s1mm,Bakkster,1 point,Wed May 13 14:43:44 2015 UTC,"The thing is everyone has the same crap setup in fixed.   That's the issue with fixed, for me. If I think the setup feels like crap, I'm not going to want to drive it. I'm not going to feel comfortable driving it, and will likely have more incidents as a result.  I prefer a car I enjoy driving   So its down to the driver, 100%.   That really depends on the car. IMO, the cars with lots of downforce settings are the ones where a bad setup can lose lots of time to a good one. Cars like the C-Spec and Kia do not gain a lot of time through setup work. At the very least, the time gained through setup is less than the difference between an average driver and a competent one.   That's part of what bugs me when people who are far slower on the fixed setup ask for a 'level playing field'. The field isn't necessarily any more level for most drivers. It does put everyone on the same setup, but that doesn't mean the guy who spent less time on his setup in the Open servers will be any closer to the rest of the pack if he can't handle the Fixed setup.  And I think that's the disconnect that makes fixed setups so popular yet so reviled: drivers who think the fixed setup will make them faster relative to the rest of the pack, who really should focus on driving the car. Not that there aren't very quick drivers in very quick cars who want to drive with other quick drivers on an equal setup, but I get the impression that's the minority (practically by definition)."

It doesn't take too long to get used the tracks and most of them I've raced on more than once in previous seasons. I don't routinely compete for wins, and I'm fine with that. But I'm good at keeping the tires from burning off and I'm usually in the fight for a top 5 because of it."
iRacing,35s1mm,Bakkster,1 point,Wed May 13 20:24:54 2015 UTC,"I think the IndyCar (and other high downforce cars) are the ones where a fixed setup can make sense. Downforce setups are more difficult and time consuming to make, and if you get them right they do make a big difference in overall pace.  My issue is with cars like the Kia and C-Spec being fixed setup. Their setups are not difficult to make, don't significantly affect pace, and drivers share these setups freely on the forums. They're poor choices for fixed because it's unnecessary. I'd rather leave fixed setup racing to the cars where a setup for each track is necessary to compete, rather than these cars where one setup can last a season."
iRacing,35s1mm,cmdnascar,1 point,Wed May 13 20:36:25 2015 UTC,"i think it makes sense to move C-Spec to fixed or scrap it all together. There are currently 2 series using C-Spec with open setups. Ruf Cup and IMSA. I think it makes sense to combine those although I imagine some people won't want to be running with the faster prototypes in the IMSA series. I have no experience with the KIA, never did buy it."
iRacing,35s1mm,Tex-Rob,1 point,Wed May 13 21:01:47 2015 UTC,"Two series with the C-Spec makes more sense than the IndyCar with four... Two open series, one being multi-class can work if set up properly. Though it's nice there's another option to run open for the car at least, sadly MC series hurt for participation for their own reasons.  With the Kia, the issue is that we already have a fixed setup FWD car: the Jetta. The Jetta has always been fixed setup, because the series it came from was fixed setup. The Kia has setup options, but we're not able to use them in official series.  And that's my issue, why not let the drivers who want fixed setup race the Jetta, while those who want open race the Kia?"
iRacing,35s1mm,lagatron,1 point,Wed May 13 22:03:55 2015 UTC,"In the DW-12 I use iRacing's fixed setups as baselines and have transformed them into race winning sets. Some sets are pretty bad (Iowa), others were already excellent (Motegi), but most are good baselines. They just usually have not enough front downforce and somewhat inefficient rear aero settings."

iRacing,35s1mm,quardlepleen,2,Wed May 13 14:39:52 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat but I just download setups from the forums. Problem solved.
iRacing,35s1mm,teh_cheat,1 point,Wed May 13 20:00:27 2015 UTC,"right thats what i do too, but if everyone is just hounding around the one setup that gets posted by some random,  hows that any different than just running a fixed set.  i like messing with setups on the weekend or when i have more time.  but usually all i can get in is a race maybe two on the weekday.  i just feel like setups play into the hands of people who have a lot more free time."
iRacing,35s1mm,Tex-Rob,1 point,Wed May 13 20:14:10 2015 UTC,"It's different in that the guys who want to, can spend the time working their setup. I download a set, then sometimes I'll spend 15 minutes to tweak at most 1 or 2 variables.   We'd have fuller fields this way, too."
iRacing,35s1mm,thebaconlard,1 point,Wed May 13 20:36:25 2015 UTC,"It's about options, not speed. In most series you see at least a few setups get posted on the subforum for the car, giving anyone who is willing to take 5 minutes to look a nice range of things they can try without being stuck with one thing that might totally suck that week. On the road side it's mostly about comfort with some exceptions so I really don't like adding more fixed road series. Oval I don't mind because the gaps are so much smaller, but I am not so serious on the oval cars so I take it casually over there.   Both road and oval have room for open and fixed setups, but IRacing needs to carefully consider what they make fixed or not. It makes no sense to neuter the C-spec, it is a drivers car that really needs the options and has sets regularly posted on the forums so there aren't any problems right now. Especially not being able to change brake bias is going to kill the fun, you really need it to keep the car balanced throughout a fuel run. I was considering spending a season in it this summer but I absolutely will not run a fixed road series as my full time series.   I think a fixed gt3 (still keep open) would make a lot more sense. Keep the more casual people in the fixed series but give people the options. It's not like gt3 is hurting for attendance."
iRacing,35s1mm,jrebs,1 point,Wed May 13 21:50:56 2015 UTC,"My big issue is the inability to use in-car adjustments. Oh, and you can't even adjust brake bias...or tire pressures...I'm very picky with those settings, and they're very basic. =/  RUF/GT3 cars need brake bias adjusting during a race. These cars are really sensitive balance-wise when there's a big change in the weight of the car when it's light on fuel."
iRacing,35s1mm,jrebs,1 point,Wed May 13 15:03:28 2015 UTC,"I agree that is a bit silly.  I think you should be able to have a fixed setup but allow brake bias to be adjusted.  It should allow basics like ARB, brake bias, fuel load even in fixed IMHO."
iRacing,35s1mm,itghisi,3,Thu May 14 17:41:51 2015 UTC,"I am mainly racing roads, and I think I'd prefer most road series to be open setup. Maybe an open Global Series would even out the huge imbalance of Caddy and Kia participation, knowing that you have to work on a setup for the car, and can't just jump into a race spontaneously (since the Caddy is free). The Kia would be a blast to race with open setup. People have different preferences when it comes to road setups, so yeah.. I would want more open series out there!   Agreed about the oval tracks. I am lost there. And slow."
iRacing,35s1mm,lagatron,2,Wed May 13 01:07:02 2015 UTC,"I would definitely try more Global Challenge if it went open setup. Heck I might even buy a Kia.   No one on the road side learns some serious setup until GT3. Although I do think the Mustang is a good bridge between series like the Mazda Cup and Global Challenge to the GT Cup. There's some things to change, but it's not overwhelming.   I just feel with more fixed series popping up the iRacing community won't ever learn about setups...road or oval."
iRacing,35s1mm,jrebs,3,Wed May 13 02:06:01 2015 UTC,"I am strongly opposed to the Ruf Cup going fixed mostly just because it's a terrible car to go fixed with. In general I agree that there should be a small selection of fixed series for the minority of drivers who believe that they have a better chance there (which I don't believe is true but don't care to debate it since it's subjective).  I do believe that the Ruf Cup is the worst case for fixed setup because it's an extremely delicate car on braking and brake bias is an extremely driver-specific preference and not a performance preference.  Anyone who thinks ruf cup fixed is a good idea, go jump into open practice right now at Sonoma and try driving some laps in the standard baseline setup and tell me how much fun you have. It's pretty awful around there and the car really needs a lot of work to even be remotely nice to drive at this track. A fully fixed ruf cup means no choice on anything, including brake bias, which I think is essential.  If iRacing would fix their software to allow in-car adjustments in fixed series (which would be realistic - almost every race car has a bias knob in the cockpit), then I would have no issue generally but I still would prefer it left as is. The open format of Ruf Cup is the reason the forum is so active with so many drivers sharing tips and setups and enjoying good racing. Without any tuning available, there will be little to discuss in the forums and I really believe a lot of newcomers to the series will be turned off by the feel of the car when they have no way to improve it. Try sonoma and see."
iRacing,35s1mm,lagatron,2,Wed May 13 01:49:35 2015 UTC,"Not a C-Spec driver, but I can't imagine not being able to adjust BB with these cars. I hope a lot of people leave Ruf Cup Fixed to tell iRacing that you need it open setup.   You get faster with practice rather than setup, and then you can tailor your setup to your driving style. Fixed setups only tailor to a specific style, and they force everyone else to adjust. You're only denying people a chance to learn about setups and that's definitely not something iRacing should be doing."
iRacing,35s1mm,jrebs,0,Wed May 13 02:23:43 2015 UTC,"^ yep.  Sadly, even if the passionate drivers who have kept this series alive for the past year all bailed out, it wouldn't matter much because iRacing knows that just putting the 'Fixed' stripe on the series banner will attract scads of drivers who don't usually run it. So participation will appear to be better, but the quality of the series will have suffered greatly."
iRacing,35s1mm,7SEALS,2,Wed May 13 04:26:46 2015 UTC,"IMHO create a new GT3-Fixed and put it on Class C would be a better idea. Would clean-up the current GT3 a little (bottom splits are awfull), would attract more people and wouldn't kill the current GR3 since participation is pretty good."

How though, do you think, could iracing attract new drivers without making it fixed?  To me a fixed series says that the best driver has the most potential to win and not someone who has been able to practice the set up the longest."
iRacing,35s1mm,WhyDoISuckAtW2,1 point,Wed May 13 20:35:00 2015 UTC,"For starters they could fix the scheduling to make the ruf cup series less conflicting with other popular road series. For instance, if  you want to run either of IMSA or Blancpain, you can't do ruf cup because it conflicts with both. If it ran on the opposite hours it does now, this wouldn't be the case.  The perception that 'practicing the setup the longest' makes people fastest is rather fictional. Practicing the CAR is what makes people stronger. I have been driving the car since october last year almost exclusively. I've driven almost 100 official races in it and I've been in at least a dozen private league endurance races. I have never once made my own setup. I just use what is around on the forums. The best drivers in the series all share their setups. The baseline is OK, but sometimes it isn't suitable for some tracks and the brake bias setting is not ideal for most drivers when they get better with the car. You'll find the c-spec is really tricky on braking and the better you get at maximizing the braking, the more important it gets to find a bias setting that works for  YOUR style of driving. Some people brake differently by preference or as limited by their hardware (load cell vs pot, etc).  I think the best thing iRacing could do now is build setup sharing into the sim or the member interface so that it doesn't require going to the forums to find one. That is apparently the biggest obstacle to people who complain about these issues.  An added point of frustration is that the Ruf Cup is already a reasonably well-attended series that manages to put a lot of official races on every week with the current drivership. If it is believed that fixed will bring in new drivers, there are other road series in FAR greater need of new drivers. V8SC, Lotus 49 and Lotus 79 are all similar cars (lacking driving aides) which have brutal participation and need attention far more than ruf cup.  The the comment that you replied to and presumably downvoted didn't say that the series would degrade because of new drivers, it suggested the series would degrade because of the departure of many good drivers who are very active in the C-spec forum offering not only setups but also assistance to drivers. If you check out the C-spec forum and look at a few threads over the past several weeks you will find countless instances of people sharing replays and and asking for and offering guidance on how to improve. The top drivers in the series who are competing for the overall championship are the first to offer help because they all genuinely care about helping everyone learn and enjoy the car. Part of enjoying this car is being able to make little adjustments to suit your style. Lacking ABS and TC like many other cars makes it very difficult to harness even in ideal conditions."
iRacing,35s1mm,Turnermator13,3,Wed May 13 20:56:08 2015 UTC,"Fixed setups and open setups are really just dependant on how much time you have to sink in. A few years ago, I didn't have a problem sitting down for hours at a time working on a setup. Now I just don't have the time do that. I only get to race once in a while, and really just don't have the time to sink into building a competitive setup.  That being said, there is no better feeling than building your own setup and winning with it. My first open setup win was at Texas oval in the Class C trucks. Not only did I win, but I pretty much dominated the entire race. Of course there was a late race caution which put us with two laps of green flag racing at the end. Was tough holding onto the first place position, but it felt great winning. All those hours running laps to build your setup finally feel like they mean something. I spent countless hours working on short run setups, long run setups, working on my restarts, running fast on the high line, fast on the preferred line, and pit entrance/exit. The feeling of all that coming together for a win is amazing, and you almost feel like you were at an actual NASCAR race and you just won a big race in front a huge crowd of fans."
iRacing,35s1mm,Legend13CNS,1 point,Wed May 13 01:59:17 2015 UTC,"I understand the time issue. I did a Silverstone Sprint and Endurance race. I didn't have time that week, so I just downloaded a setup and tweaked it. But that week was bad, and not doing my own setup played a part (me not knowing how to be fast there also played a part XD).   I feel that ovals are much more challenging to setup than road racing, because being slower 0.1 seconds per lap on an oval is a lot worse than on road. So I get why fixed exists on ovals, because setup does matter. The Fixed Setups in the trucks (haven't tried the higher series much) and the ones in the IndyCar ovals seem decent at least.    But on road racing, unless you're racing DW12 or F1, setup is only to fit your personal driving style so you can drive it the way you want. And like jrebs said, no in-car adjustments...."
iRacing,35s1mm,Bakkster,3,Wed May 13 02:44:09 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you what. I'm new to iRacing. I've started in fixed series like everybody else. I dont know jack about setups. When I've moved from starter fixed series to more advanced ones.. learning new cars with baseline setups was hard. Cars understeered a lot, I couldnt get them to turn and after number of laps they would crap out on me, I would loose grip and I was clueless. Sounds familiar so far, right?   For me it was only logical to take advantage of open series format and look for custom setup. So I did. I've visited forums, downloaded 2 or 3 setups and took them to practice. It was so much better. I could finally enjoy all those beautiful cars. Never had a problem to find setup for given weeks track. Never had to tweak setups to my liking. They were always much better than the baseline.   This should not even up for a discussion. This is not the case of figuring out the right or the wrong way. Fixed is against the very core of this ""game"". Why spend time and effort to get data for cars to simulate them as close to a real thing as possible only to handicap them later by not allowing to change the setup? Why are we even discussing it when there is only one answer because its plain as day?   Do you really really want to drive baseline setup? In open series you are free to do so. Do you absolutely have to take away any possibility of tinkering with the car for everyone else? No, you dont. Will fixed series make you faster? Will it make easier to jump in a race? No, it wont.   There are 20-something pages, over 500 posts in Cspec forum majority of which written by people smarter, more articulate than me. You can find all the reason and evidence you want there. If you have any comprehension of written english you can only reach one conclusion - open series are the way to go.   TL;DR  I'm lazy.  I dont know setups.  I never had problems finding setups.  BUT  I wont force other people to drive crap baseline setup.  I wont tell people passionate about their car to go drive other open series on the service.  I wont try to dumb down the most advanced simulator on the market."
iRacing,35s1mm,CalculatorAmbassador,3,Wed May 13 08:15:46 2015 UTC,"IMO, the crux of the debate is this:  Are we entitled to be competitive in cars we are unwilling or unable to setup?  There are several layers to this one:   Is being 'competitive' a right for everyone, and how is it defined? Should drivers who can't set up faster cars instead take the option to drive slower cars which they can set up? Does a tuned setup actually make the drivers faster?   Quick anecdote: A few years ago, I was in open practice at Road America. There were several drivers new to the car asking for ""a good setup"". I had only made a few minor comfort tweaks to the baseline, so I reloaded the baseline to show them what could be done on their standard setup. Within a few laps, I had set a laptime 1.5s faster than any they had done, proving the setup was not holding them back. That lap was also half a second faster than what I had been setting with my modified setup. I went back to the baseline after that.  So, the assumption that drivers who are faster must be on a better setup is one potential fallacy. The idea that a custom setup will necessarily be any faster is another. Even if you get a fast driver's setup, there's no guarantee you'll be able to drive it (which is the same issue for fixed setups, really).   And finally, there's the question of whether drivers who can't set up a given car should instead run a slower car that they can set up and feel competitive. On the one hand, sim racing is supposed to be about fulfilling dreams about driving cars you'd never be able to otherwise. On the other, it's a competitive sport and at some point you're going to find someone better than you willing to put in more time to compete.  So, what's the solution? I've felt there are generally two improvements that would make people happier:  Fixed as a sub-class - Similar to various GT3 series that have Pro and Pro-Am categories running the same car, do the same with fixed setups. Fixed and Open setup cars would share the track, but there would be separate standings for drivers who stick with the baseline setup (though they'd also be shown in the overall standings). There would be some tweaks needed to handle how points and iRating worked, but it might show that the Fixed setup isn't so bad after all, and it gives a chance for drivers with either preference to race a populated series.  Limited setup instead of fixed - I've long said I'd rather see limited changes to the cars. In general, the stuff that's difficult to learn are aero and suspension. So fix just the aero package, ride height, spring and shock package, etc. Then leave open a few simple tools for each driver to adapt the setup to their personal style. Brake bias, one ARB, TC/ABS, and steering gear for instance. The hard work is done already, and none of the changes affect pace significantly. You've simplified the process while leaving choice."
iRacing,35s1mm,iracer46,2,Wed May 13 20:33:22 2015 UTC,"I love to tweak setups.  If the car doesn't feel quite right, I make a little change and it's better.  However, the participation in fixed series is really good.  C street stock used to be open.  The participation is much better now that it's fixed, but there goes that learning opportunity.  Maybe you could start with Legends setups.  They only have a few basic things that you should be able to handle since you can tune a road car.  The tracks are all pretty similar so you only need change gearing and maybe 25-50 pounds of spring to adjust to a new track."

iRacing,35mkp0,anygivenname,7,Mon May 11 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"Hey dude, that's a pretty respectable home-brew cockpit plan. It must have been super low cost and relatively easy to do. The chair looks like it won't be too nice for any sort of long sittings, but I imagine you can/will upgrade that in the future. You could probably get some decent padding and just staple it into the wood.  The swing-away shifter mount is a good idea. I inverted my pedals a few years ago and couldn't go back, but I do find my angle needs some adjustment. Your angle looks really good on the pedals. I would recommend, however, a strip of angle bracket or something screwed into the floorboard at the position you want your heels to sit. I find it valuable to have some kind of notch to plant your heels on while you drive to keep your feet in a consistent position relative to the pedals."
iRacing,35mkp0,jrebs,2,Mon May 11 19:23:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, Thanks! I did go out and get some padding for the seat which was a must. The pedal bracket is a good idea, I have found that my heel does slip back sometimes and was wondering how to fix that."
iRacing,35mkp0,RogueRAZR,2,Mon May 11 19:27:23 2015 UTC,"Comparing your pedal setup to my RX7 IRL, you might try adjusting the pedal mount so that its slightly more vertical, then lowering the pedals maybe a 1/2"" or so. From your rig it looks like the pedals are almost vertical when extended, however in my car they are vertical at about the 50% travel mark."

iRacing,35oc30,Tempyy,1 point,Tue May 12 04:28:55 2015 UTC,"The track changes every week, each season is 12 weeks long, 4 seasons per year.  If you want setups you should look on the iracing forums, a lot of people who post here seem to not even know they exist,"
iRacing,35oc30,RileyF1,1 point,Tue May 12 04:37:06 2015 UTC,"If you are interested in getting promoted to C ovals, you'll need to buy one of the D class oval cars. The street stock is only in rookies and C, and legends is only in rookies. Even if you run a ton of rookies events as a D driver, you'll max out at D 4.99 because you need a minimum of 4 races in a D event to get promoted. Either the National or Late Model car will work, but you'll also likely need to buy tracks for the series. I think the Late Model runs more on the short ovals, so that may be better suited for you.  As for open vs fixed setups, it all depends on what you want out of a series. The fixed setups are easier to get into and you don't have to worry about anything technical. The open series require a lot more work and practice with the car and you'll have to spend some time reading about how various setup changes affect the car. There are usually some helpful people on the forums to either give advice regarding setups or share the setups they are currently using, but remember that the setups they share work their driving style and not necessarily yours.   Iracing isn't cheap at the outset because there is a lot of content and most of the free stuff dries up pretty quickly once you get out of rookies. I've spent 300-400 on it so far and I know there are others who have spent much more. If you love racing it is worth it for the consistency and quality of the racing/content and the ability to find a race pretty any time you want.   Edit - Apparently I'm wrong about promotions and what the users below me say is correct: you can race in a series C race with a D 4.0 license and get promoted from there."

I'm not too excited about the money I have to spend though, especially if I want to run the three monitor setup with a racing seat, the chair I sit in kills my back lol.

iRacing,35oc30,bozboy204,3,Tue May 12 06:42:39 2015 UTC,"My recommendation is try and find a series you want to run in and just commit to that. I made the mistake of spreading myself very thin early, and having a lot of content that didn't really match up with any one series. Just recently I've found the Indy ovals to be a lot of fun so I've bought in to that and the damage to the wallet is a bit lower now.   I run a single monitor and it works fine. Triple monitors would be better, but 2 more monitors + new graphics card is too much. I race in a reclining office chair and never really find it to be uncomfortable. I don't think a racing seat is really necessary, I would prioritize content first, with triple monitors second."

iRacing,35oc30,AndyBatch,1 point,Tue May 12 21:46:55 2015 UTC,"What /u/bozboy204 said isn't 100% accurate. You can achieve a B 4.0+ license without ever buying content.  Drive the Rookie Street Stock until you achieve a D 4.0+ license. From there, you can drive in the C-Street Stock Series, whenever they race at a free track (Charlotte, Thompson, USA, Lanier, and Oxford Plains). Earn your SR points in those weeks and you'll break into the B license levels.   Both Road and Oval are designed where someone can race in Rookie, then C-series, and then achieve the ability to race in the A-series, without ever purchasing over base content."

In crappier quality of racer series like the GT3 you'll get a LOT of dives into the chicanes because they're hard braking zones. Makes racing crap but great for driving.  GT1, I just cant get over how much better all the drivers are. Down to 1200 iR everyone is extremely respectable. I'm looking forward to seeing the series grow with Aston but hope the racing can level out to stay the same. Thankfully Watkins is first next season but still...we'll have some wreckers."

When I upgraded to my AMD FX-6300 and 8GB RAM my fps improved with the same graphics card. I can't explain that one.   Anyway this build over at PCMasterRace looks like it'd get you very close to maximum settings at 60fps. Probably go for R9 280 if you plan to run triple monitors"

What I meant was actually maybe a bit for aimed towards bottom split. Maybe some series don't attract ""bad"" players because they are a bit more difficult and therefore lower split will actually be already high level/quality race.  Does this sound like something that's happening in some series ?"
iRacing,35lk5p,PudiKator,2,Mon May 11 15:01:49 2015 UTC,Perhaps you should try the SRF then. It's not super hard to drive but the skill ceiling for pushing the car to its limit is pretty high. Plus - bumps by reckless drivers around you aren't likely to ruin your races unlike in the Skippy. If I'm not mistaken the SRF is on Charlotte atm so you can try it out without investing any money. :)

iRacing,35lk5p,jrebs,3,Mon May 11 16:07:53 2015 UTC,"On any given day in any given series you could grid up beside a pro or a complete yahoo. It doesn't matter if that's in the FW31 A series or the MX5 rookies. If you race in the more popular series such as Skip Barbers or GT3, then there are usually splits and if you have a good enough iRating to reach top splits you will generally be matched up with better competition.  The reputation about GT3 is a bit unfair, IMO. I've only started running the series with any frequency this season and it's a lot better than people would have you believe. I think many of the complainers about the series are themselves the types of drivers who help the drama happen by refusing to ever back down from a fight or now when to choose the right moment to go for it.  It doesn't matter which car you drive, you start to develop a sense for when some car around you is not a worthwhile risk and it's often better to let that guy go than try desperately to keep him behind you so he can punt you in 2 laps and then say a trite 'sorry' as he continues on down the road. I've been iRacing for almost 7 years and I assure you these guys can be found anywhere.  Now, if we want to discuss where the highest level of competition is, it's going to be mostly in the most active series. GT3 often has 3 or more splits and so the competition is amazingly well matched all through the fields. In the Ruf Cup there is a very large number of extremely solid and sporting drivers but the total numbers aren't nearly as high as GT3 and so splitting isn't very good except on weekends and you will usually be racing against a smaller number of guys at your level unless you're quick in the car. I still have always found it to be among the best racing I've found on iRacing anyway, though. When it goes to fixed setups next season (if they actually push through with that horrible blunder), it will probably be a lot sloppier and a lot of the strong drivers are likely going to ditch it for another series. :("
iRacing,35lk5p,greenslime300,2,Mon May 11 15:03:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply! Seems like I'll have to practice a lot more and work on my irating and hope for the best that my SR wont get decimated in the process :p
iRacing,35lk5p,jrebs,1 point,Mon May 11 15:29:08 2015 UTC,"practice a lot more   This is always the key. If you keep putting in your seat time, your iRating will average out to where it belongs which will put you around the right level of competition. Safety Rating will, over time, become a non-issue. Anyone who's a sane driver and practices enough to keep the car between the lines without major struggles will be able to maintain a decent SR. Mine always hovers in the A 3.x range. Some bad races will drop me down a bit, maybe to the A 2.x but then it rises back up easily enough. A few good races and I am back in the A 4.x range. Either way, I recommend not worrying about any of the ratings and just do what you said: practice a lot and have fun in your races."
iRacing,35lk5p,greenslime300,1 point,Mon May 11 15:53:20 2015 UTC,"The reputation about GT3 is a bit unfair, IMO. I've only started running the series with any frequency this season and it's a lot better than people would have you believe. I think many of the complainers about the series are themselves the types of drivers who help the drama happen by refusing to ever back down from a fight or now when to choose the right moment to go for it.   I don't think I've done a single GT3 race where I haven't witnessed a wreck, either in front of me, behind me, or involving me. Even though it's a B class series, there are a lot of drivers who seem to have gotten to that point without ever practicing racecraft. The first five minutes or so of most races seem to be more wreck avoidance than actual racing.  I'll admit that I'm in the lower splits (iRating is hanging around 1500, I don't have the time to dedicate to boosting it) and it's probably cleaner in the upper splits."
iRacing,35lk5p,jrebs,3,Mon May 11 23:46:11 2015 UTC,"It's important to consider the context, though. GT3 is typically grids of 25~ cars with 3 or more splits. This means that the spread of irating is VERY tight within a single grid and the speed of the drivers is very close from front to back as compared to any other series with lower participation where the gaps will be much larger from front to back. Add to this the power of the draft and it means that GT3 races produce very close, evenly matched racing every time out.  If you've ever watched real life touring cars, or more appropriate the real life supporting series to touring cars, such as the Ginettas, then you'll find that wrecks in front or behind or involving you are rather a fact of life when you have 20+ eager amateurs racing closely.  And yes being in a lower split may or may not have an impact on this stuff, but the point is that GT3 creates really large, closely matched grids racing on fast tracks with fast cars that have both ABS and TC for days.  In any event, I have done maybe a dozen GT3 sprint races and I've done about 6 or 7 endurance 3hr races and sure almost every race has had some drama somewhere on the track but that's hardly different from any other series I race in. I have only been caught up in a couple of wrecks so far myself in the sprints and a couple in the enduros. Half of those wrecks could have been avoided if I'd identified the dangerous guy beforehand and just let him go. The others were pretty much unavoidable from my end but that's going to happen sometimes, all the way from MX5 rookies to real life Formula 1."
iRacing,35lk5p,greenslime300,1 point,Mon May 11 23:56:47 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I've just noticed that in my experiences with GT3, I've seen plenty of amateur lap one heroes, more often than I've seen them in most other series.  I'd probably enjoy GT3 more if I ever ventured outside of the RUF."

He'll be the first to tell you that he's not the quickest guy out there, however he's pretty consistent and relatively experienced, so I've found simply watching his videos and seeing how he races a good learning experience that has improved my driving, particularly on ovals which I'm not as familiar with."
iRacing,35ipv7,vmaxmuffin,4,Mon May 11 08:40:43 2015 UTC,"Your number 1 goal right now should be to get out of rookies ASAP.  I've found that the best way to do that is start from the pits and just take it very easy.  No need to push, just cruise around a few seconds off pace and focus on getting as little incidents as humanly possible."
iRacing,35ipv7,anamericandude,2,Sun May 10 23:54:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Alternatively, if you can qualify fast enough to start at/near the front, and then maintain a decent pace to stay there throughout the race, then do that. Not qualifying/not being fast enough to be at the front puts you in the dangerous mid-pack area, which is where you are most likely to be taken out by other people who are reckless, ignorant or both.  This way is the ""more fun"" way of doing it, but obviously it depends on you already being a relatively fast/experienced driver (you don't have to be amazingly fast, just fast enough). It puts you with the other faster rookies who (generally) I found to be better racers - probably because, like me, they were reasonably quick but had only recently began using iRacing, so they were in the Rookie stage.  This is the way I got through most of my rookie races, but it only worked for me because I'd already been racing in other sims for several years and I had the speed. It may not work for you if you have less experience in other sims.  Generally if I didn't qualify in the top 25%/first 3 rows (whatever was a smaller portion of the grid) for a race I chose to start from the pits instead."

iRacing,35jmwu,7SEALS,1 point,Mon May 11 22:36:16 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about finishing the race in a high position. Just worry about finishing the race cleanly. You will be surprised to see just staying out of trouble will most likely land you top 10s or even better. Start from the pits in the back and stay behind the field and avoid the wreckers. Give everyone a ton of room and make your line super predictable. If you are going to pass someone low, jump to the low line way before you make the pass. Always assume the person in front of you or behind you is going to wreck into you. If someone behind you is getting aggresive, let them by immediately. Give them the preferred line and get out of the way. Chances are they will wreck someone ahead of you and you will get your spot back.  If you really want, you can grind the time trials. Those are races by yourself against the clock and you gain SR by doing those."
iRacing,35jmwu,7SEALS,1 point,Mon May 11 01:19:41 2015 UTC,Thanks man. Usually I stay way inside so they know I'm going to stick my nose in. Just did that to get the lead literally 5 minutes ago but he came across and I spun. I'm new to this stuff so how do I do time trials?
iRacing,35jmwu,hikinkycat,1 point,Mon May 11 01:39:23 2015 UTC,"When you select ""race now"" to see all the available time slots for official races, there will be four buttons above the time slots. You should see ""race"" ""qual"" ""TT"" and ""prac"". Click the ""TT"" button, which stands for time trials and will show you a list of available time slots for time trials. I think time trials are every five minutes if I remember correctly.  You are by yourself for the time trials, don't worry about going fast just complete clean laps. If you wreck or spin out you can lose safety rating. It can feel like a grind, but just use the time to get a feel for the car in different parts of the track."

Funny thing is, when I got to C, I did one 94 lap race and now I'm nearly B Class. Also, when you get to C, you can no longer race in Rookie Street Stock.. so be ready to jump into real racing. However, they have their own Street Stock series, so you may need to buy a track to get your MPR time-trial/race. If not, buy a track that you will use further in the season in something else (I got Kansas for back to back weeks in Trucks/Gen 6 cars).. I think Trucks are at Charlotte this week, so you may want to try to hurry to D 4.0, buy a truck, then do 4 time trials at Charlotte."

Just because you weren't at fault doesn't mean you didn't do anything wrong and couldn't have avoided them, the common denominator here is you. This especially seems the case with you calling everyone else a moron.  What is your iRating? I find you need to be at least 1700 to get away from the clowns, and if you aren't that high then there's a good chance you're one of the clowns whether you would want to admit it or not, if that's the case you just need to go back and work on the fundamentals."
iRacing,35isfg,screampuff,4,Mon May 11 01:40:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this guy.  I just started a couple weeks ago, and my first few races, I would just apoplectic after getting hit by some asshat.  Then I started saving every replay and reviewing every contact incident after each race.  I was really surprised how often a small mistake on my part that at least contributed to the incident.  While, a lot of the time, maybe a more experienced racer would've given me room, or been skilled enough to avoid me, in almost all cases it usually takes at least some contribution from both parties to cause an incident.  Maybe a lot of the OP's incidents are 90% the other guy, but I bet if he looks hard at them, he can probably find his 10% contribution and work to eliminate that.  I guess another way of thinking about it is this: if the other guy is 90% responsible, it will take a big change (and will probably be almost impossible to change him, because he's stupid, and you might not ever encounter that individual again), but that 10% change for you is pretty small.  You can definitely do something about that."

iRacing,35isfg,theebe,1 point,Sun May 10 21:48:39 2015 UTC,"I'm too lazy to check if there are inc/series stats somewhere, but if there's a series known for wrecks and reckless drivers its GT3 [along with HPD drivers in IMSA series, but its multiclass].  There are dangerous drivers everywhere so you cant expect clean races in certain series when someone recommends you one, but I'm pretty sure they will be cleaner than GT3.  After rookies I've done a few races in Spec Racer and Global Challenge, one season in Skip Barber, one season in Ruf Cup, one season in Radical and currently I'm in Radical and Star Mazda. If there are splits I'm in the bottom one for sure.   Spec Racer was surprisingly clean for a D series, Global Challenge was abysmal, Skip was clean-ish [talking bottom split], Radical has no splits, but its clean, Star Mazda bottom split thanks to in-session quali is decent as you leave slow guys behind before 1st corner.  I tried GT3 when Ford GT GT3 came out and it was as bas as Global Challenge so I've tired my luck in private leagues, but it wasnt much better so I gave up on GT3 altogether. At this point for me its a waste of time to practice, quali and get taken out on pace lap or L1T1. Maybe when I can reach higher splits I'll give it another try.  I'm no expert tho, listen to what others say and try to figure it out for yourself. I'm sure there are plenty of drivers happy with GT3 or Global Challenge for example."

But the last 3 races I entered, 2 from the back and 1 from the front were all 0 incident. There were people spinning but I didn't see any ramming and even went side by side and nose tail into turn 1 at Charlotte more than a few times without incident...

iRacing,35isfg,vmaxmuffin,1 point,Sun May 10 21:50:46 2015 UTC,"I gather you're predominantly a road racer, just out of interest have you tried the oval racing side of the service? I was originally a road racer, but I decided since I had iRacing and was paying a subscription that covered both sides, I would give oval racing a try. Apart from enjoying the option of the different style of racing (I now race both roughly 50/50), I found oval racing improved my road racing consistency. It taught me accident avoidence, because (generally speaking) you run much closer together on ovals and when crashes happen it requires more skill to predict and avoid them (as the walls keep cars on the track, like a street circuit, and speeds are generally higher).  You may find oval racing will improve your accident avoidence in GT3. I recommend Indy Fixed for this due to the high speeds, high participation and generally high number of wrecks. Either go there straight from the Rookie Street Stock (by getting to D4.0) or through Late Models first."

Like the V8 Supercars, Lotus 79, FW31, etc. You occasionally get the one lap heroes that try to win it on the start but most of the time the racers have a lot of respect for each other. I raced in the second split SOF race on monday for the V8 Supercar at Bathurst. The two leaders were battling it out very hard from the start and always gave room. The lapped cars know that they are slower and dont fight. Some got stuck in awkward positions across the top of the mountain but the car behind respected that and waited till a straight to get past. Easy 0 incident."

Off track is the other drivers fault.
iRacing,35isfg,AR-47,1 point,Sun May 10 20:39:42 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with your first two points, but there definitely should be instances where contact doesn't result in a full 4x.  When you're racing NASCAR and the big one happens it's kind of bullshit that you get a 4x for something nearly unavoidable.  I've also seen plenty of bullshit in Indycar races where a yellow flag comes out, I brake hard to avoid the wreck, and someone behind me is trying to gun it through the wreck.  Indycars have way better brakes than stock cars and should be used.  Kind of ranting here, but the take-home message here is incidents during yellow flags or crashing into spun-out/wrecked drivers should be a 1x or a 2x."
iRacing,35isfg,Execrat0r,3,Mon May 11 03:04:52 2015 UTC,"Stop thinking of incident points as apportioning blame but rather think of them as a cost.

Seriously fuck those guys. They create a negative feedback loop with qualifying which is the reason half the field doesn't qualify. A lot of people when asked why they don't qualify is ""I dont want to be infront of the over aggressive non-qualifiers who will run you off the road"".  I'd say Oval should just have this done immediately for all the series. Not like oval qualification takes any amount of time anyway.

iRacing,35bvvb,HerpDerpenberg,2,Sat May 9 12:55:51 2015 UTC,Here is the preliminary 2015 Season 3 schedule. The official schedule goes live on June 16th on the membersite.   Some notes about the schedule:   The NASCAR open truck and nationwide series are not on here because they are still running from season 2. The NASCAR iRacing open and fixed series are not on here because they are technically active Season 1 seasons. The GT1 schedule will have the Aston Martin in it. Ruf Cup is now fixed setup. If you would like to drive this car in an open setup season you can do so in the IMSA series. Sprint car and Silver crown schedule is not updated yet. National Series now has qualifying attached to the race sessions Super late model now has qualifying attached to the race sessions Blancpain Sprint Series now has qualifying attached to the race sessions    All seasons that have qualifying sessions attached to race sessions will have dynamic weather.
iRacing,35bvvb,Fuzzwah,0,Fri May 8 21:45:10 2015 UTC,Ruf Cup is now fixed setup. If you would like to drive this car in an open setup season you can get stuffed or go get killed by newbs in HPDs.   ಠ_ಠ
iRacing,35bvvb,jrebs,2,Fri May 8 21:52:35 2015 UTC,I recently joined a Ruf Cup team and they're all going to be very pissed off about that. One of the big advantages they had was the time and effort that went into developing their setups.
iRacing,35bvvb,Fuzzwah,3,Fri May 8 21:54:01 2015 UTC,"It's also a series with no shortage of openly shared quality setups. All of the fast guys in that series happily share their sets every week to give everyone something nice to drive and because they know road car setups don't make you fast, they let you be comfortable.  There's a poll up in the C-spec forum which shows an unsurprising overwhelming majority opposed to the change. Hopefully this won't be a final decision since we're still so far from S3."

The setup page allows for users to press buttons to try differing levels of FFB. :)  What you are experiencing is the default way that the G27 works. Any settings you want to change (such as the degree of rotation) should be done in the Logitech Profiler, not windows controllers. Windows Controllers just allows for you to check to make sure that Windows is properly detecting the wheel, and the ""wheel turning"" is just an old gimmick logitech left it from old software. :D  TL;DR: There is no calibration page for the G27 other than the Logitech Profiler, but the wheel itself self-calibrates at detection. Settings are all changed in the Profiler. What you're experiencing is by design."

iRacing,35a32t,lukeatron,2,Fri May 8 13:34:12 2015 UTC,Does this behavior change when you get into the sim?  Mine will be stiff like that between the time I first plug it in and go into the sim.  Once the sim takes control of the wheel the FFB relaxes and it can spin freely.  Stays like that after I exit too.
iRacing,35a32t,arsenicfox,2,Fri May 8 14:26:32 2015 UTC,"I would change the Logitech profiler rotation setting to 900 (it's in the global game options in one of the drop down menus at the top)  In game, I often make the rotation 872 (as this seems to be the most common ""FFB"" rotation, it kind of rubber bands at the end)  This gives it a closer 1:1 feel.  The wheel will often be stiff UNTIL you're in the car in the game. Sometimes games like pCars just don't let go of it either. Don't know why.  :) any other questions?"

iRacing,352g3j,hikinkycat,3,Wed May 6 22:27:37 2015 UTC,"I got this news from hackernews, the top rated comment over there is this:  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9498029   I was able to get a demo of the Crescent Bay prototype (hand-built tech demo of the consumer version) at PAX East this year. I've also tried the DK1 and DK2.  If you've been playing with the DK1 or DK2, the consumer version is fundamentally better. Do not assume you know what the state of the art is until you've gotten your hands on a preview. I don't know exactly what the resolution differences are, and I don't care - it's not the relevant spec to compare. It's gotten to the point where resolution is ""good enough"" to trick the mind and anyone who says otherwise is bikeshedding.   They've gotten the screen door effect under control. With head tracking implemented and drift solved as a side effect, two huge problems are gone. Their low-latency head tracking stops people from feeling nauseated like they did with DK1. I could barely stand without wanting to vomit after playing the Doom demo. The only game I could play for any length of time was a simple platform jumping game called Rift Rush.  I don't know what they consider their largest hurdles, but from my perspective the hardware/software problems are solved for now and they need excellent made-for-VR content. When done well, the effect is stunning - in one of that calmer, more exploration-oriented demos I just stared at the light glinting off a metal bowl as I moved around it for at least 30 seconds.  But the difference between ""good"" and ""mind blowing"" was often the result of things that nobody has thought about before. In the movie-like demos, sometimes I missed things because I had my back to the action. In VR movies, the user controls the camera and needs to be told where to look; that's a problem nobody making movies has ever faced before. Even Pixar's demo suffered from this - the action was too spread out for the screen's field of view."

Back when iRacing was in its infancy I was in the hayday of track creation for NR2k3, and recreating tracks from satellite imagery in sandbox was one of my specialties...I thought for sure when they were looking for employees originally I would be a shoe in, was gonna be my big break...never even got a reply call or email. Was definitely one of the more disappointing things in my life. I realize now just knowing sandbox wasn't really what they needed, if I had a degree/experience in actual 3d modeling/design then maybe things would have been different.   On topic.. very excited to compare their rendition of the ring to AC's, which is already absolutely stunning."
iRacing,34xxyh,ConeDodger,2,Tue May 5 17:12:58 2015 UTC,Did you actually apply?
iRacing,34xxyh,solaris79,3,Tue May 5 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, but at the time I was 17/18. Who knows I could have been pruned out of the system just based off of that. It's all good, just wasn't meant to be. Just found it really interesting to find out they do indeed still use that software, because I could never get concrete answers on that either."
iRacing,34xxyh,ConeDodger,2,Tue May 5 18:17:34 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for sharing."
iRacing,34xxyh,solaris79,2,Tue May 5 20:03:27 2015 UTC,"From how iRacing tracks look in general, I think the AC track will seem more ""alive"". Its pretty easy to notice duplicated textures etc in iRacing, and in general their tracks are a  bit clearer, but also a bit dull."
iRacing,34xxyh,InZomnia365,5,Wed May 6 13:27:26 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who's concerned about the horrors that this track will do to ones safety rating :).
iRacing,34xxyh,occupied_name,12,Tue May 5 15:17:39 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not. It's basically just a winding road, constant back & forth cornering without many opportunities to pass (single-file procession) and large curbs to discourage you from going off or dropping wheels... I think that once you get the line down, it will be a big boon to your SR. Tons of corners + 0x = big SR gains."
iRacing,34xxyh,Fatt_Rascal,2,Tue May 5 17:06:52 2015 UTC,"With incident point limits, pretty much every race on the Ring will be a boost in SR so long as you dont spend a huge amount of time in the pits."

iRacing,34xxyh,CrashMatt,3,Wed May 6 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"I'm still not really getting it, the Nordschleife is an amazing track, but not for racing. It's great for hotlapping. Every race on the track is fairly boring because most drivers just don't get enough tracktime to learn the nuances of the corners.  I live about two hours from Nurburg (and Spa, Zolder and Zandvoort :p ) and I drive every couple of months a couple of laps on the Nordschleife, and it's great fun. I love to drive the track in AC, but in iRacing I don't really see the point."
iRacing,34xxyh,Eburon,2,Tue May 5 21:53:58 2015 UTC,"I agree. Everyone thinks they want to race on it, I'm confident that after the first season of excitement the full course won't see a lot of action outside of special events."
iRacing,34xxyh,Fuzzwah,3,Wed May 6 04:47:03 2015 UTC,However the GP track should kick ass in GT3 cars.
iRacing,34xxyh,ABusFullaJewz,2,Wed May 6 07:26:32 2015 UTC,"I agree, the GP track should be great in a number of series. I'm excited to race it in the Mustang for the Grand Touring Cup."

It's not all that hard to learn... Think about it, you learn a bunch of other tracks like the back of your hand in this sim, and that all adds up to a lot more than the 12.9mi that is the Ring...

iRacing,34xxyh,YNOTtheTIGER,4,Tue May 5 21:37:42 2015 UTC,I think the difference is in demand.  Nordschleife has a lot more demand than Long Beach.
iRacing,34xxyh,slobbishbodysfw,2,Tue May 5 22:07:58 2015 UTC,"There is a decent demand from a lot of iRacers for iRacing to finish Long Beach.  However, since we have been told repeatedly that they can't, for technical reasons, properly create the track and the surrounding cityscape as they wanted the majority have shut up about Long Beach.  That being said, since they are able to create the full Nurburgring I think they should revisit the Long Beach tech track to finish it."
iRacing,34xxyh,YNOTtheTIGER,2,Wed May 6 02:23:08 2015 UTC,Would be a great track for IndyCar and GT cars

iRacing,34u9gs,nyaanyaanyaa,4,Mon May 4 16:43:54 2015 UTC,"Yep that sounds right. If you've got auto clutch and auto-blip you only need to press the paddles. Downshifting sounds reasonable too. A common mistake is downshifting too early. Some cars won't let you do that, others will spin right round."
iRacing,34u9gs,randomkontot,5,Mon May 4 17:09:24 2015 UTC,"But don't do it too late also, downshifting is an important part of being fast through the corners as you can reduce speed without touching the pedal and keep the max amount of grip possible. But don't fixate on that right now, just keep it in the back of your mind when you're comfortable in the car and looking for those extra tenths."
iRacing,34u9gs,Eburon,1 point,Mon May 4 22:56:46 2015 UTC,reduce speed without touching the pedal   Do you mean without touching brake? If you mean it helps to slow the car down when you brake it's wrong.
iRacing,34u9gs,Hindulaatti,1 point,Thu May 14 16:04:02 2015 UTC,"no I worded it wrong due to my bad english, I meant downshifting at the right moment gives you more mechanical grip under braking."
iRacing,34u9gs,Eburon,1 point,Thu May 14 18:41:16 2015 UTC,Better yet; it makes wheel rotation smooth so no lockups can happen if you brake correctly.

iRacing,34u9gs,itghisi,0,Mon May 4 18:53:52 2015 UTC,I use a Momo and use no aids. I actuate the clutch with a button and blip myself. Actually much faster than you would do with a clutch pedal.
iRacing,34u9gs,SgtMustang,0,Mon May 4 19:28:42 2015 UTC,He said increasing realism.
iRacing,34u9gs,SirBensalot,2,Tue May 5 15:59:58 2015 UTC,"I wasn't responding to that. I interpreted his comment as saying that you need a G27 to clutch or manually blip, which is totally untrue, you can run no aids on almost any controller.  No need to downvote me for that."
iRacing,34u9gs,SgtMustang,1 point,Tue May 5 20:44:54 2015 UTC,Never downvoted you.
iRacing,34u9gs,SirBensalot,2,Tue May 5 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"As long as you use the aids you are doing just fine. If you want to drive without aids you have to use the clutch to shift (either buy pedals with a clutch or just map a button on your wheel), there is still no need to lift on upshift though. The Mx5 also requires a blip on downshift. This could be the first thing for you to learn as it doesn't require a clutch."
iRacing,34u9gs,Didarab0cchi,4,Mon May 4 21:43:48 2015 UTC,"Shifting in iRacing differs from car to car.  Since you have autoclutch and auto blip turned on for your Mazda then you don't need to lift off the gas.  Also of note:   I have the auto-blipping option on, as I don't have a clutch pedal.   A clutch pedal is not required for throttle blipping/rev matching.  For instance, the Lotus 79 doesn't require you to do any left foot clutch work.  To downshift all you have to do is give a light tap on the throttle as you gear down.  Also, also:   I use the pedals paddles on the back of the DFGT to shift up and down.   Paddles for hands.  Pedals for feet. It's a small different but makes for confusion.  Good luck on the track!"

Still struggling a lot with downshifting (too many things to handle at once in a corner) and end up in Neutral a lot. Also, seems like sometimes you dont reallyneed to blip, and sometimes not blipping will send you into the grass. Still trying to figure out when to and when not to blip (and how to properly blip as a matter of fact)."

I wont race until with aids any more, I think it's better to learn it as soon as possible to not get too used to driving the easy way!  I got used to left foot break, I need to learn right foot breaking at the same time as I learn the whole blipping thingy ! It feels like I went from ""Piece of Cake"" difficulty to ""Nightmare"", but I think it's better and will make me a better driver faster !"
iRacing,34u9gs,Memn0n,1 point,Tue May 5 14:28:52 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest things I found out in the MX-5 would be making sure your RPMs are low enough to downshift. If they are too high, and you downshift, your tires will be spinning too fast for the lower gear, resulting in your tail whipping out."
iRacing,34tjn1,Fact_or_Fake,6,Mon May 4 13:10:44 2015 UTC,"People intentionally wrecking or driving backwards is very rare. More common in ovals though, but still not very common.  The G27 is great bang for your buck if it's ~150-200 USD and has a H-shifter and clutch for immersion."

There are plenty of people that can't drive to save their lives, but mostly just idiots, not malicious. Iracing detects if you are driving the wrong way and will DQ a driver for going the wrong way pretty quickly.

With a single monitor I would think you could run about medium setting with close to 60fps (we could help you with what graphic setting you need and don't need  The G27 is not the best wheel but is probably the best for the price and I would make a guess that about 20% of iracers us that wheel.   Rookie class is not iracing do your best to get out of rookie as fast as possible. The higher the safety liscence the less jackassory and rookie class has probably 90% of all iracing  jackassory Cheers Matt

I did any race I could get into to get my license. I did no practice but this isnt very good for new drivers. I had rFactor for a year and a wheel for a good half a year before I joined iRacing. I was able to top 5 in my league most races cleanly.   Basically for you maybe stick with the Mazda get some more practice there. Then move into the Skippy. This is a great car to learn car control. It is very different to other cars in driving style. Likewise the SRF is the same. You could even race the Mustang if you want to as a tin top instead of open wheeler. Then move to the Caddy. Then maybe Advanced Mazda or RUF Cup. Then finally by then you should be able to get B class.  It takes time for some people. For me it took about 2 days to get to C but I then lost it as I was concentrating on winning more than safety. I very rarely played the game for a month so maybe a week for me to get to A if I played it everyday.
iRacing,34ougw,Memn0n,1 point,Sun May 3 10:43:43 2015 UTC,The Caddy is a hard car to drive.  There's lots of C and B cars that are way easier to drive.  Try the production car challenge or SRF.
iRacing,34ougw,someoneinsane,1 point,Mon May 4 16:09:13 2015 UTC,I had fun recently trying the SRF for the first time. I think I'll stick to that for the moment. Not really to spend lots of money on cars/track as long as I'm not 100% sure of where I'm headed. SRF is at Charlotte (which had me doing my best race result in the Mazda) this week. I think its the right time have a go with it.
iRacing,34ougw,theebe,1 point,Tue May 5 11:59:23 2015 UTC,"FOV you can adjust with [ ]. The setup is pretty understeery for me personally, but that's just because it's the step up from rookies to help newbies out.  Also every race i've had is quite insane because Laguna Seca is a free track, so all the rookies who just promoted will be in this race, resulting in stupid amounts of incidents. For me the same guy spun out in front of me on the pace lap, spun someone out, and also ran into the back of me into the Corkscrew. Also Laguna is really thin and difficult for a rookie."
iRacing,34ougw,jaymobe07,1 point,Sun May 3 04:19:52 2015 UTC,Yes but for me my field of view has to be 45 and this means I cant see any corners really. Its terrible. Yeah I had the same pretty much.

iRacing,34ofiy,Mouse_for_life,1 point,Sun May 3 01:19:04 2015 UTC,"Get the TX or T300RS instead. They are more refined than the T500RS in FFB and overall design, smaller, quieter etc.  If you want PC/XBone capability go TX, for PS4, T300RS. Buy new not used as the newer ones have had reliability improvements.  With the money you save on the Tx you can buy a new rim AND the T3PA Pro pedal set (Basically T500 pedals but with the conical brake mod included). My personal choice for rim would be the All-purpose leather TM28 wheel or the F1 wheel if you exclusively do open wheel.  Either way you'll see a massive increase in FFB quality from the G27."
iRacing,34ofiy,SgtMustang,1 point,Sun May 3 08:57:04 2015 UTC,I was under the impression the F1 wheel can only go on the T500RS?

iRacing,34ofiy,kingsfan7205,1 point,Mon May 4 14:05:04 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the guy saying to get the TX or T300RS instead. Those wheels are cheaper for a reason, they aren't as good quality. It's not as huge of a difference if you get new pedals, but I still think the T500RS is better and I'm also but positive if the F1 wheel is compatible with the 300 or TX.   I have the T500RS with the F1 wheel and love it. Granted they were expensive and if you buy them new they cost even more, but I found a great deal on Craigslist. Depending on the cars you drive you might also want the TH8RS stick shift, but skip it if you only use cars with flappy paddles."

iRacing,34ofiy,JiiPlays,1 point,Mon May 4 17:53:26 2015 UTC,The T300 / TX wheels are only cheaper because of the pedals. T300 / TX with the T3PA-PRO pedals would be far more viable option in my opinion as I have experience on both T500rs and T300

iRacing,34l4ym,rancer890,2,Sat May 2 04:09:36 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity what red flags did you see?  It's a different game and in my opinion that's fine. iRacing won't be for everybody just like PCars, AC, etc won't be either. I'm getting it for my PS4, if iRacing had LMP1's I probably wouldn't though."
iRacing,34l4ym,devhow,3,Sat May 2 14:31:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not really a fan of the bumper cars AI that pCars has. It's not even the physics and what not with the game, because it was always going to be a simcade since this is also on consoles. It seems like they don't really respect you on the track. And even on 100%, they are sometimes very slow.   But the AI is make or break. I think I will rage quit the first race and never touch it again if I get this game lol."
iRacing,34l4ym,rancer890,4,Sat May 2 14:55:10 2015 UTC,"I've personally never played with AI that was capable of not running me off the road.  I played 100s of hours of Gran Tourismo (3, 4, and 5) before I had a PC and could play proper sims and never really had an issue with the AI, and from everything I've heard PCars AI is slightly more competent than Gran Tourismo's AI.  Also, I heard people speak goldy things about the AI in sims like GSCE and rFactor but when ever I see people play them online they are constantly running off the road and hitting each other, along with the player.  AI is never going to be perfect, but they are usually at least predictable, unlike real people on iRacing.    With all that said, I still think iRacing is the best sim out there (mostly because of the online multiplayer), but AI still has it's place, and I see myself buying PCars pretty shortly after release, but probably not on launch day, as it fills a very empty GT/Forza style racing game genre on the PC and that's something that I really have been missing since I quit playing on consoles."
iRacing,34l4ym,DiscGolfer947,2,Sat May 2 15:36:17 2015 UTC,"I really like the AI in Marcas, so I hope when I get the other Reiza titles, they're good as well.   Having better AI than the Turismo Train isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. ;)  I probably will get pCars in its lifetime, but when there are mods to improve the AI with its consistency and aggression. iRacing isn't the most realistic either, but it's fun. pCars just doesn't look fun to me."
iRacing,34l4ym,rancer890,1 point,Sat May 2 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for elaborating. While iRacing scratches my racing itch, it doesn't cover everything I like which is where Project Cars looks to fill that void. I think I can have both coexist on my gaming shelf though.

iRacing,34igtc,aliencougar,5,Fri May 1 12:59:09 2015 UTC,"Rake can also change by CP being more rearward, so at speed your ride height will not only change with throttle, but by downforce as well. The more DF your spoiler (or the rear in general), the more rearward your CP will be and it will effect rake.  Alternately, the more DF your splitter makes (or the front of the car in general), the lower your front ride height will be.  These are only velocity dependent changes, so cruising at full throttle they should remain constant (barring any splitter to ground height disturbances, or body roll, which both change DF)  Spring rates also have a big effect on rake with DF, as even with a completely F/R neutral CP, lower rear spring rates will cause steady state ride heights to be lower in the rear (delta compared to front).  Throttle interactions are pretty quick, and can be influenced by the dampers, which means that really stiff (in compression) dampers in the rear will 'hold the rear up' longer when you get into the throttle.  This is a transient effect though, and won't effect straight line ride heights, only letting off / applying throttle quickly.  Keep in mind that I've only listed factors for longitudinal transient weight transfer and down force effects of rake.  Spring rate and damper settings still effect mechanical grip and vehicle balance in the same way they always do.  Super speedways though are usually about minimizing drag and still getting enough DF and balance to maintain full throttle everywhere.  Negative steady state rake is not always bad, as it gets your spoiler out of the wind, which means less drag and more top speed.  If you have to lift though, more DF may be worth the drag penalty.  I'm not familiar with the iRacing changes you are allowed to make for your series, or how the equations for DF / Drag / Ride height are structured, but in general this is how it works on stock cars (I am a NASCAR Vehicle Dynamics Engineer)  This is kind of a ranting answer, but I hope it helps."

Now I can tighten it to heck and it doesn't move at all.  The desk is a 4' formica countertop from Home Depot, cost like $30 or something. I drilled a 3"" hole in the middle for the center monitor and the sides are just attached to the sides (you'll need to pick up the side trim or some 1x2s).  You can get a better look at it in my rig video overview @ 3:42.  I REALLY like the individual mounts, I have a lot more flexibility to get a good FoV. Typical triple monitor stands are very restrictive height wise and angling out the two side monitors. I have mine at 50* right now and 168* FoV. It also allows me tons of room under the monitors for my keyboard and mouse and anything else if I'm racing or just gaming. It's like the monitors are just floating above my desk, lets me really get the center monitor close, there's no stupid stand in the way.  So order those on amazon, run to home depot and get that counter top and a 3"" hole saw, or a jig saw, and get your ass racin!

iRacing,34fs8d,anamericandude,6,Thu Apr 30 19:53:34 2015 UTC,"Upshift flat out, no problem. Downshifting you can either use clutch (heel-toe, naturally) or not (blip). It's generally a matter of driver preference. Heel toe is going to be a bit more reliable IF you're good at it. Blipping on downshifts can be tricky and until you get really used to the car it can result in missed downshifts which can very often make you blow a corner.  My method (I have driven the C-spec pretty much exclusively since last October) is to blip very heavily and shift very early. When I downshift, the car pops and sputters against the limiter (and sounds oh so delicious) and I get my gear. Basically as long as your rear end doesn't kick out, you're not shifting TOO early. Some of the fastest guys in the series use heel-toe (Yassine, for one). I like lfb and blipping because I am quite dependent on using throttle while braking to maintain stability with the rear end.  I find the trickiest part of the car is the braking. Tyre grip is at a major premium and it has a way of vanishing rapidly if you blow your braking markers. This is very much a 'slow down to go fast' type car. Drive it smoothly and with respect and it will show you a very good time!  Just to get a visual idea of how I shift, here's a lap around Suzuka racing against my teammate in the Ruf Cup last season (onboard cockpit view with input graph shown). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzX8p_CopPE"
iRacing,34fs8d,jrebs,2,Thu Apr 30 20:04:42 2015 UTC,Thanks a ton!  This is exactly what I was looking for.
iRacing,34fs8d,crazyjockey,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:30:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can flat-shift (i.e. just pull the shifter) when you're going up through the gears.    Going down through the gears requires heel-toe in real life.  I also heel-toe in the sim.  In iracing you can get away with just pushing the shifter (i.e. no clutch or blip), but I've always found that it makes the back end unstable during braking because it can cause the rear wheels to lock momentarily.  You can also just blip (i.e. no clutch), but I think that's slightly less efficient than heel-toe because it means there are short periods of time where you are on the throttle and brake at the same time.  I personally have never been a throttle-braker: I've never needed to, and it isn't a skill that transfers to real life anyway.  I wrote this post a while ago that contains some other useful info for people who are learning the C-Spec.  Hope it helps!"
iRacing,34fs8d,jrebs,1 point,Fri May 1 04:43:57 2015 UTC,"slightly less efficient than heel-toe because it means there are short periods of time where you are on the throttle and brake at the same time   o_O  That's partly what makes it more efficient. When you heel toe there is invariably fractional time spent transferring the foot from flat throttle to heel-toe braking. With left-foot braking you could already be applying light brake as you start to lift throttle. Heel toe is a great method and perhaps preferable, but not for the reason you're arguing, I think."
iRacing,34fs8d,crazyjockey,1 point,Fri May 1 05:04:51 2015 UTC,"That's partly what makes it more efficient   The initial transition from throttle to brake can be done more quickly, yes.  What I'm talking about is the blipping: because the gears are still engaged, you're applying brief moments of acceleration with every blip while you're trying to slow the car down.  The best you can hope for with that method is blipping just enough to unload the transmission, without blipping enough to cause acceleration.  That requires a very small blip, and in practice you'll spend the majority of time either blipping too much, or not blipping enough to unload the transmission (which will result in a failed shift)."

iRacing,347jy3,jon-burrows,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:38:11 2015 UTC,I use iRduino (long thread but totally worth it). It is basically a little LCD screen with shift lights connected to an Arduino board that is connected to your PC. You can set up whatever information you want to be displayed on the LCD screen. I have my Water/Oil temps displayed for plate racing and MPH/RPMs displayed on other tracks.  You can also use iBuzzer G which does a million things and is probably the most useful iRacing app I've found. One of the things is does is it will tell you when your gauges are flashing AND it will send a pm to your drafting partner or any teammates you also want to know about your temps.  Before I set that up I just used DashMeterPro on my android phone or tablet.

iRacing,340ora,plaguuuuuu,3,Tue Apr 28 07:57:55 2015 UTC,"""Strength of Field"" races. It's when the lads with the higher iRating gather up to make a higher average iRating split that will yield more championship points (and thus have the potential to be the races that decide the championship).   Often this also means that particular race will have more participation and more splits, although that's not necessarily the case."
iRacing,340ora,soestrada,6,Tue Apr 28 08:30:38 2015 UTC,"The track selection for the Ruf Cup this season has lowered participation. That said I've done 3 official races at Indy this week, each with around 15 runners.   I'm quite serious about running the Mustang in the GTC this season and have done 5 official races at summit point this week.   As others have said, it's all about being able to run at the popular times."
iRacing,340ora,Fuzzwah,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:27:35 2015 UTC,"I guess I just find it frustrating how much it drops off between the popular cars and the other ones. A 'fairly popular' timeslot in the skippy will have ~50-60 people in it, so you still get good splits. A really popular time is pushing 150 and you get huge splits.  I've realized I have more fun in those because the races are closer and the chances of posting higher and not losing IR is much better too. Things like the Mustang and RUF are really just waiting until you can get a full field, but the IR of that group will range from 4000-1200, and if you're on the lower side you should resign yourself to sitting at the back and eventually succesfully finishing and losing IR."

Sometimes a series is a ghost town because of a certain track that people don't want to bother with because its hard.  GT3 is always populated and tons of fun.

All those numbers back up where I was feeling anyway: caddy, skippy, mx-5, bmw in gt3, and maybe the ford spec racer.  I just really wish I could race the RUF or mustang. That's more than enough series for one person, and no way could I run in all of them every week, but I want to run something more powerful than the MX-5 that isn't open wheel, with higher license class people, and there aren't really any options for that without doing GT3.

iRacing,340ora,AR-47,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:11:37 2015 UTC,"At the start of last season I sat down and picked cars that I could see myself running a season in (6 iirc). After about 30 minutes of research I found that really, none either fit my personal schedule or participation didn't warrant my own participation or rather, the time spent practising.  If those factors work for your personal situation, great. If not, you're well out of luck. As a result I've not done an official race in months.  Series and cars do get moved about from time to time. But that doesn't always mean it will suit you better personally."
iRacing,340ora,Bakkster,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:37:10 2015 UTC,"A lot of series need to become multi class to boost participation.

iRacing,340ora,Mopar_Madness,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:50:27 2015 UTC,"The problem is, multi class can kill a car's participation just as easily. If you usually get 4-10 people interested in the car as a single class, it'll go official about half the time. However, if you put it in a MC series, it'll go official all the time, but many races will only have 4 cars in the class. Nobody wants to race in such a small class, so entries go down, feeding back into the cycle until it's possible you're only getting 1-2 car grids except for the SOF times.  Multi class doesn't solve that issue, the only thing that really helps are rescheduling or redesigning the series to be more attractive, or reworking the car to race directly with others (Ford GT3, for instance)."

iRacing,33zxur,RealPleh,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:24:40 2015 UTC,Yeah! I love the Late model way more than the Xfinity and Truck. maybe because I like short tracks more than big tracks. I think it is a tough series because it open setup and there's no cautions. It does take a while to get up to speed and be consistent for 50 or so laps consecutively but it is still a lot of fun and if you keep it out of the pits you can get a decent finish

iRacing,33wbaz,DeathbyAndy,3,Sun Apr 26 08:10:06 2015 UTC,"Learn to read. I said IF a crash resulted. The crash that DID happen was in no way his fault.  He did not TAKE the line of the other car, he took it AWAY. IRL there is a strong chance that would go into review by track staff.  As far as locking his tires up, this is a clear indication that he overdrove the corner. Sure it make work once or twice but even iRacing is getting better at tire models and it will affext the handling of the car greatly. Too hot, loose as hell; too much wear, loose as hell; uneven front/back or left/right wear, loose as hell or tight as shit depending.  Bottom line: if you read my comment, I did applaud him and even said I would do it too if conditions are right. I did say however be careful how and when you use this because others will not take kindly to it and may retaliate.  SOURCE: This is my second job. I am the lead mechanic and car setup man for a race team based out of Virginia. I constantly have to analyze my driver's line and actions to make the appropriate adjustments to both the chassis and tires.  EDIT: Also he did not ""hold the inside line"" he invented one. For that particular corner, the line he took is not an established racing line, hence the hard brake amd damn near 90 degree turn. That is a common misconception of rookies. Just because you are inside doesn't mean you have a ""line"". Most road tracks only have one racing line in the turns. Hell, look at the RHR-Bourdais incident from NOLA. Bourdais didn't have a line. He invented one."
iRacing,33wbaz,b3ttykr0ck3r,4,Sun Apr 26 14:01:09 2015 UTC,"Overdriving a corner is in first place bad for tire management and braking temps. You reffered to it as ""a dick move"". This implies to me unsportsmanlike behaviour, e.g dive-bombing, pushing someone off track and so on. This is not generally given for overdriving.  Also I don't get why someone should take such a move not kindly? At 0:24 the closest car is just behind the 100m mark and yellow has already overtaken him completely. Additionally this is way before the turning point for the first corner. Everyone has enough time to react and adjust to the yellow car. Plus, as the red/white car there are two scenarios for yellow. A) He misses the corner completely and overshoots it or B) he will barely make it and hug the left tracklimits (left from driver perspective).  What happened? Yellow held the inside as he was positioned on the straight. He doesnt even swerved to the outside to have a better line. He even did better that expectet as I watched the video the first time.  Why are we talking about racing lines? Its not like two cars are going wheel-to-wheel through a corner, where both are taking their ""lines"" and giving space to each other. Yellow took his own line for turn 1 and he slowed down drastically to hold the inside of the corner, so the others car, would have enough space on the outside. He was even thinking of THEIR space on the track. I don't see how anyone from the guys involved could blame yellow.  RHR-Bourdais: If you are reffering to the accident also involving Pagenaud, I also can't agree with you on that. I think you are a bit rigid on that racing line thing or maybe that is a kind of drivers ethos agreement in the US? Bourdais is basically just holding the inside line (yes it is a valid line, he is not swerving from left to right, like the racing line flows, because he would challenge the space from RHR and Pagenaud). The clear causer of that accident is RHR, because he is challenging Pagenauds space while he is all the way beside him. RHR should have positioned himself way more in the middle to make it a 3-wide.  P.S: I upvoted you, because you could very well explain your opinion, even though I am not agreeing with you. Cheers.  RHR-Bourdais-Pagenaud: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wXWWE3Udzg"

EVERYONE has a difference in opinion, and the one that really only matters is that of race control.  But yes I think this is a driver ethos thing because even among my team, we are all not in agreement with the RHR incident.  At the end of the day, this sport rewards the bold, and I am truly impressed he made that work, well done OP."

While not technically illegal, it IS a dick move and had a crash resulted, you would have been at fault since you are the overtaking car."
iRacing,33wbaz,b3ttykr0ck3r,10,Sun Apr 26 08:11:33 2015 UTC,"where does he took the line of the leading car? He even overtook him before the corner completely. He held the inside line. Locking the brakes is his own problem and managing the tyres afterwards.   The crash that resulted is NOWHERE his fault. It was misjudgement by the white/black driver, he could easily avoid the crash.  Well done clean move."
iRacing,33wbaz,thecluelessguy90,3,Sun Apr 26 12:03:07 2015 UTC,"oh yeah 100%, probably hit the brakes too hard (hence lock up), perhaps due to the bricks filling my pants weighing my brake foot down.

Small improvements make much bigger lap time changes than in road racing, where its a combination of the line you drive and the setup you have, and depending on the type of driver you are there can be many different strategies.  In circle track racing there are generally one or two setup and line strategies for each track, and it's hard to come close with anything else."

iRacing,33wrsq,hikinkycat,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:16:45 2015 UTC,Some were quicker than me but a program called ispeed is helping me a lot. It analyses your line and throttle braking etc and allows you to conpare with saved laps from others (that will be quicker). Its a great way to check where the differences lie. My advice is find a lap about half a second faster rather than the fastest and then see what the differences are. It may well be one corner where the line is wrong or you brake too early.
iRacing,33wrsq,mrgreen72,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:22:47 2015 UTC,"I'm doing the same--I just think it's funny that you'd defensively say ""actually I can be faster"", when you started a thread on Reddit to ask why other people are faster than you.

There's a pretty good guide to using it called ""one second at a time"" on the forums, though it's written from the perspective of road racing.

Of course, a lot just stay in Skippy, or SM, or Indy. I don't do Indy on road, but I do so on ovals. There is also Lotus 49 and 79 series.   GT -> You can practice more with the Solstice, or you can try racing with the Mustang or Jetta (go with the former imo). In C-Class, there's Advanced Mazda, Corvette Challenge (which I don't recommend yet - until the Aston GT1 comes out), Ruf Cup (Porsche Carrera Cup), and V8 Supercars. If you like MR cars, you can get the Ruf (there's Track and C-Spec that are used in official series). At B-Class there is also the Blancpain Sprint Series with 40 minute races in the BMW Z4, Ruf Track, McLaren MP4-12C, and the Ford GT all to GT3 spec.

iRacing,33vibv,theebe,4,Sun Apr 26 02:06:08 2015 UTC,"Schedule suggestions for next season are supposed to be done by May 4 I think. That means in a few days you on forums there will be a list of tracks you need for next season.   Some tracks are more popular, but if you can wait a few days do so. Check forums for the series you want to race next and see what they've picked for next season.   Then cross-check with other series and you'll see which tracks are best bang for the buck.  Out of 12 weeks only 8 weeks count so if you want to compete for points you need only 8 tracks per series/per season. They change every season, but not all 12 are changed, some stay for more than one season.  If you need to buy something right now I'd say Spa, Watkins Glen, Road Atlanta and Road America, Sebring and Suzuka are probably the most popular [dont quote me on that]. Thats 6 tracks so you get 20% discount if you buy them at once.  I'd suggest you wait and pick a series then check forums for next season's schedule and buy tracks for it. It may very well be that out of 6 tracks I mentioned only 2-3 will be used for your series."

Just for the record, the Skip just finished with Road America and Sebring in the rotation for now, and Suzuka has one more season. So half that 6 is a waste for the Skip, but could be great for a different series or two or three.  That's the reason people need to narrow down their car and check the official forums and the series' schedules.  There's a budget post on the forums that explains all this with updated info, but I'll leave it for the reader to find the link."
iRacing,33vibv,tomolart,1 point,Sun Apr 26 07:43:01 2015 UTC,"reddit is a lot of fun. Now go read the iRacing forums too. For example, the Skip has a good explanation of the track rotation used. If you buy a track for this season, that post will tell you how many more seasons you will get in over the next 3 seasons.  If you are not sure which car you want, then just stick with the freebies; you can run the MX in Advanced at C, even! (and here is their 2015 schedule.) The free SRF has a strong community too. Or buy a car or two. Get mostly tracks by digging through schedules. Some series are voting for tracks now, so who knows? (Although those posts may show you what tracks are likely to show up next season.) Some (like the Skip) have more info already posted in stickies and stuff.  The 8 of 12 (a few series are less than 12 weeks) is not just for competition, but once you race D-series and above, you earn credits towards future purchases if you do the 8.  With the Skip (for example), two tracks are from the free ones, and the post I linked will show you tracks coming up. Because of the rotation, you probably don't want the ones ending this season. They are still voting on the tracks which will appear on the rotation (for 3 seasons) next season. (Another reason to check out the forums, especially for the series/cars that interest you.) If you started now (S2 in the Skip), Oran Park and Monza are still yet to come and you will get two more seasons out of them.  If you start any series now, you won't get 8 out of 12, though - we're nearing the end of week 6.  However, there isn't any reason to stop racing in the Miata with the rookies just yet. If you improve your skills and IR and all that, you will find yourself in better splits without rookies and a different level of driving. Go for D, sure - but all the higher letters really mean is that you have more choices to spend your money on, especially with cars. The more cars you race, the more tracks you need."
iRacing,33vibv,JKraems,1 point,Sun Apr 26 07:21:11 2015 UTC,"If you want to try and cut costs, like others said, look at the schedule and work out which tracks get used the most (suzuka, watkins etc) so you'll get to use them the most in different series without having to fork out anymore cash. as far as cars go, decide on what you wanna drive, and see which cars are used in multiple series, as you dont need to buy the car twice to use it in a different series."
iRacing,33u7ug,olioli86,3,Sat Apr 25 17:55:57 2015 UTC,"SR is in effect for all official qualifying, warm ups, and post race until the final racer finishes his recorded laps.  Most of those are not full SR though; they are multiplied as follows:     Oval qualifying 0.35 Road qualifying 0.5 Time trial 0.35 Official race warm up 0.5 Unofficial race warm up 0.35"
iRacing,33u7ug,ManNotHamburger,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:15:22 2015 UTC,"1) Yes, SR is in effect at all times in any official session, with the exception of Practice sessions.  This includes the warmup, as well as after the checkered flag (so don't think that as soon as you cross the finish line, crashing won't matter).  2) This question gets asked a lot.  There are races other than the official series- there are leagues, and there are hosted sessions.  For official races, you are limited by the content you own as well as your license class.  For non-official (i.e. League or hosted sessions), you are still limited to the cars and tracks that you own."
iRacing,33u7ug,h3r4ld,2,Sat Apr 25 18:00:25 2015 UTC,So SR doesn't factor into official practice sessions?
iRacing,33u7ug,hikinkycat,2,Sun Apr 26 01:51:47 2015 UTC,"Nope; IR and SR are not in effect during official practice sessions.  You can spin, crash, and go off track as much as you want while you learn a new track during practice, you won't be penalized.  That's what practice is there for!"

iRacing,33t025,CrashMatt,7,Sat Apr 25 09:23:51 2015 UTC,"I think this is just a cold, hard reality of hosted races. Yeah, it sucks, but if I'm in a 20 lap hosted race with the Gen6 at Talladega and I get wrecked, there is no reason for me to continue. Yeah, I might get repaired up, but I'm going to be a lap down, slow, and in the way. There is nothing to be gained by me taking up space on the track, so I yield for those who have kept their noses clean.  Plus, I can maybe go catch an official race.  Is it sub-optimal? Sure. But it's just the nature of the beast."
iRacing,33t025,Speedly,2,Sat Apr 25 17:33:02 2015 UTC,I only race hosted races because it gives me the flexibility to drop out of a race if life happens. I don't quit if I get in a wreck but more often than not I have to back out of a race because I have to attend to something. If it wasn't for hosted racing I wouldn't use iRacing online at all.
iRacing,33t025,skell15,2,Sat Apr 25 10:14:20 2015 UTC,"I appreciate this and it is difficult to meet everyone's requirements but I guess what prompted this post was a race I entered today started out with well over 20 cars and we were down to 4 cars by the half way point. I would suggest it's highly unlikely that 16 people had ""life"" issues, most of them hit the wall or each other and just quit out, it's just disappointing."
iRacing,33t025,7SEALS,3,Sat Apr 25 10:37:34 2015 UTC,I quit if I wreck or am super off pace. I have a limited amount of time to play. I'm not going to waste it by being a back marker.
iRacing,33t025,sim-racingcouk,2,Sat Apr 25 13:47:28 2015 UTC,"Not sure why your pace matters.  You are always racing the track.  If you happen to come first it's a bonus, but by quiting you are missing out on track time, stick with any session you enter and just drive, it's the only way to improve."
iRacing,33t025,pipboyforpipgirl,2,Sat Apr 25 15:09:11 2015 UTC,If I end up as a back marker I just race myself to get faster lap times or try different lines.

iRacing,33t025,ADT_Clone,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:20:10 2015 UTC,"I definitely disagree. So I should limp a damaged car around and chance being in the way of those whose equipment is intact just so I can ""race the track"" (at a reduced pace) and risk causing another incident?"
iRacing,33t025,iracer46,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:36:44 2015 UTC,"Most hosted generally have atleast one or more fast repairs....  Get it back to the pit and then get back out there........... I have to confess I don't race oval much, I guess that ""racing the track"" is pretty dull on your own in this case more than road but you still never know how the race will pan out."
iRacing,33svos,MyNameIsTrue,5,Sat Apr 25 08:06:31 2015 UTC,"I'd do the practicing in open practice, just let the gridding driver to warm up before green light and make a sandwich or two. :) The team has a combined incident point limit, but each driver has any affect only on their own SR. The SR is calculated from incident points / turn. If you drive a clean race, naturally you go around more turns cleanly in a 3 hour race, than in a 20 minute race. The blue flag is more of a notification for you, that someone with a faster class car or a lapping car is withing 2 seconds behind you, be ready to let him by when you can. It's polite and just common sense to facilitate a pass for a faster lapping car to the best of your ability, even if its going to cost you some precious tenths of a second. You can't get a black flag or any kind of a penalty, if the car behind you doesn't make the pass.   Good luck out there, keep it off the walls. ;)"

However after the new website changes released at the beginning of this season I was no longer able to do this. I sent a ticket in as I had added money to steam in order to pay for a track but all I got in response from support was that apparently this was never a feature and that I could not have done this...

iRacing,33psok,Noofnoof,9,Fri Apr 24 14:45:26 2015 UTC,"That's not a nice place to have an incident. Not the greatest move trying to go up the inside there, would've waited until the straight."
iRacing,33psok,RileyF1,9,Fri Apr 24 16:21:57 2015 UTC,"If all of you think the blue car is in the wrong, you all have a lot to learn about race craft...  Even if the green car makes it alongside, what will happen next?  He doesn't have the racing line or any sort of line to make the next right hander, so everything they have done is pointless.    Wait for the bottom of the mountain, get a better exit from the left handed corner and pass them on the straight or round the fast right at the end of it."
iRacing,33psok,sim-racingcouk,3,Fri Apr 24 16:24:14 2015 UTC,Indeed. Just sticking your nose in and barging someone out of the way has nothing to do with racing.  Maybe that works in NASCAR but thankfully that's the exception.
iRacing,33psok,Nevil-Clavain,3,Fri Apr 24 19:25:00 2015 UTC,"Who cares who is in the wrong? It's still an argument regardless...  The only thing you have control over is your own car, if you can't figure that out to avoid ALL wrecks and not just ones that are 'your fault' you'll never get better."
iRacing,33psok,screampuff,10,Fri Apr 24 18:37:01 2015 UTC,"The ""blue car was in the wrong"" commentators have no clue about corner rights.  You get them not when you stick your nose in, but when you have proper overlap (conventionally - one's nose should be up to the driver's position).    Green car stuck its nose in but had no rights to the corner. 100% Green's car fault, no question about it.  If you think otherwise, you should go read up on passing etiquette.  That said, on official servers it's self-defeating to turn-in on people w/o proper overlap on any track.  That just gets you damaged.  At Bathurst it ends your race.  Turning in on people w/o proper overlap only makes sense on iRacing in long-running leagues with strict stewards and severe punishments.  P.S. Bathurst week in the SRF? Maybe I should try to do some races after a waaay too long of a break."
iRacing,33psok,AWES0M-0,5,Fri Apr 24 15:24:29 2015 UTC,"If you watch closer, just before we brake I have a lot more overlap than was present at the point of contact. I braked earlier than them, because I was expecting to go 2 wide through the corner, and you can't do that at full speed. I had the overlap and then they wanted to pretend I wasn't there, brake late, and then I ended up with nowhere to go but tagging their back corner."
iRacing,33psok,Didarab0cchi,7,Fri Apr 24 15:28:39 2015 UTC,"You had corner rights there for sure. Not the smartest corner to attempt a pass with these draft machines, in the heat of a race i would probably try it as well though."
iRacing,33psok,piggybaggy,2,Fri Apr 24 16:55:22 2015 UTC,I think he was just trying to keep his car on the course. You did a good job setting him up and putting him off the racing line but if you would have made room then you could have been on the throttle much sooner than him.
iRacing,33psok,AWES0M-0,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:12:11 2015 UTC,"I don't see it.  IMO, never in the gif above the overlap even approaches sufficient.  If you have better pictures from directly above - post them."
iRacing,33psok,sim-racingcouk,2,Fri Apr 24 15:38:22 2015 UTC,"No idea why you are getting downvoted, you are the only person talking sense.  This is not an overtaking spot.  Blue car has the racing line, the green car can fake there, but you can't make the pass, it will result in an accident 95% of the time.  The only time you make it through there is if the car on the racing line - the blue car - gives you the position and there is no reason why they should.    It's just bad racecraft to even attempt the pass there.  You have to understand that at times, even if you are faster, there are still places you have to be patient and wait it out."
iRacing,33psok,MysticalMuffDiver,6,Fri Apr 24 16:16:21 2015 UTC,They were even going into the turn and green broke a little sooner than blue. How does that give blue the inside rights?
iRacing,33psok,AWES0M-0,0,Fri Apr 24 15:32:47 2015 UTC,"They were never even. The green car at most had a 1/4 car length overlap, that doesn't entitle the green car to the inside line.  By the book, that is.  Sadly, the attitude ""I stick my nose in and then either you yield or I take you out"" is the norm on most official servers.  Hence, what I said above about what the blue car should've done.  Still, doesn't change blame assignment."
iRacing,33psok,AWES0M-0,3,Fri Apr 24 15:41:50 2015 UTC,"I think you're taking some fringe opinions as legitimate.   iRacing forums are full of people who know little about motorsports and are just defending their latest move that someone has called dirty.  The general rule of thumb - corner rights after your nose is up to the driver's position before turn-in.  The majority of real-life events are stewarded that way.  If you want to live by different rules, that's okay,  iRacing isn't gonna be bothered with live stewards (or policing this after, cause it would expotentially increase the load on them) and there are plenty of fun leagues that don't care."
iRacing,33psok,AWES0M-0,5,Fri Apr 24 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"Overall, attempting a pass there is 100% dick move (unless lapping someone with your competition close behind).  Have some patience, there's a loooooong straight coming up in a few seconds."
iRacing,33psok,MysticalMuffDiver,3,Fri Apr 24 16:01:00 2015 UTC,Which car are you?
iRacing,33psok,MysticalMuffDiver,2,Fri Apr 24 15:43:03 2015 UTC,"Nah, I've figured out in this sub, whichever car you are, you were wrong. :)"
iRacing,33psok,MysticalMuffDiver,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:55:21 2015 UTC,Blue car was clearly in the wrong.. The green car had a run and the blue car pinched him in the corner..  I watched this gif 15 times and not one time did I think that green car screwed up. The guy had his line and the blue car pinched him.. There is a ton of track on the left side and the blue car paid the price of not using it.
iRacing,33psok,firish,4,Fri Apr 24 15:02:53 2015 UTC,"If I say I'm the Heineken car, will the downvotes stop?   I knew taking the inside into that corner would be risky, but I was basically level as we approached the corner. I braked earlier than I normally would, expecting to have to take a different line. They plowed on as if I wasn't there and there was no way I could brake any harder to avoid contact without spinning."
iRacing,33psok,MysticalMuffDiver,2,Fri Apr 24 15:08:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely. I changed my downvote to an upvote for you. You can't make a post like this and hide your identity.

iRacing,33rj2v,nyaanyaanyaa,8,Fri Apr 24 22:54:11 2015 UTC,"Times don't really matter since your first races should be all about consistency. So that being said, I'd say you are OK to start racing once you can do a race distance in practice without having any problems. In open practice you should also spend time trying to run with other cars to get a feel for how things change in the braking zones and otherwise when you're racing other cars. It's very different from lapping mostly alone and in the races you will be exposed to a lot of it very suddenly.  Don't worry about wins, ballsy overtakes, etc. Just try to make a good impression in your first few events and you'll find surviving with a clean results will automatically give you good finishing positions in the low ranks. If you're very comfy around traffic then you can start pushing for results if that's what you're into. Getting racey in the rookie series has inherent risks. Lots of people there will also be new and won't have a proper understanding of how to adjust around traffic. So even if you're a bit quicker than a dude, it's often better to just follow him closely until he makes a large enough error for you to easily clear him. Having a guy right on your bumper can be pretty scary and dangerous depending on said guy."
iRacing,33rj2v,jrebs,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:20:15 2015 UTC,"As a rookie myself, however with some online racing experience, I will partly disagree with you. I do acknowledge that a fair bit of racers in the rookie class are... unpredictable, at best.   However, since joining iRacing two days ago, I can definitely say that I have had my share of close, fair, respectful racing. Don't be afraid to go close with someone just because you're rookies. It's perfectly doable. Might one of you fuck up? Sure. Is the possibility bigger than in the higher ranks? Probably. But you will have to learn how to do wheel-to-wheel racing somewhere, and in my opinion the rookie class is there for us all to learn every aspect of racing. Be that in clean air or sniffing the rear part of the guy in front of you. As long as you stay to what you're comfortable doing and observe your opponents, you can have perfectly good, close and exciting racing as a rookie."
iRacing,33rj2v,dencker60,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:16:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't say everyone in rookies is crap, I just said there will be some guys in some races you need to be on your toes around. In every race there are a few decent drivers a few horrible ones and a mix of in betweens. I spectate a lot of rookie races for amusement. :)  Yep, it happens in every series. The only point I was trying to make was worry about keeping your car pointed in the right direction and not how fast it gets there. Once you are comfortable driving, then just jump into racing and the pace will come. It's when you're looping the car consistently every race that you should think about more practice first."
iRacing,33rj2v,jrebs,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:40:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know. My previous post was probably a bit ranty. Rookie racing is indeed a mix of horrible and decent drivers. I just feel that on here and the forums, there can at times be sort of a ""rookie-shaming"" theme going on, basically telling rookies to stay put and not race anybody. I'm just posting my views as someone who is currently in the rookie class (Just got my D license, but still). I have had several races that were extremely fair and close.  I do agree with you though, I've actually changed my strategy a bit and seen improvements in my positions. Before I used to push hard for low 1.24s on Charlotte, now I aim to do low 1.26s without pushing as much, and I do overtake a lot of the spinning/crashing cars. Focus on driving the car properly, albeit a bit slower, has helped me a lot :)"

iRacing,33pxzz,jrebs,0,Fri Apr 24 20:00:39 2015 UTC,"Wait, so When that f1 car comes out, there will be no more of the williams F1?"
iRacing,33pxzz,Kubi74,3,Fri Apr 24 20:02:56 2015 UTC,"The Williams car will still exist on the service and be driveable, but it would be quite natural to assume that iRacing will update the official Formula 1 series (Class A, Pro and DWC) to use the newer F1 car. You can be sure if they didn't, 99.99% of the drivers therein would complain.  As it stands now, the Williams is quite an old car in F1 terms. Also note that iRacing typically offers a credit to people who purchased a car near the end of its life in the official series'. So anyone who buys the FW31 now with the McLaren already announced will likely get $5 credit. So that would make it about a $4 expense to race the FW31 from now until end of its life (if you have the 25% discount and if my assumptions are correct)."

iRacing,33q0ny,devhow,7,Fri Apr 24 15:45:47 2015 UTC,"I would say that a few things need adjusting. I see that it's at about $500 and you could build a great system for that price. It also depends on if your in the states or not as prices vary greatly over sea's   Starting with the CPU. It is a older processor, but it should do just fine for iracing. If you wanted to branch out to other games like asseta corsa or project cars, I would say that you need something beefier like an i5. The CPU fan will be fine, but it's a bit on the spendy side. If the CPU comes with a default fan, you should use that instead, but if you want something queiter Noctura makes awesome silent coolers that don't break the bank. As far as RAM goes, you should definatly do 4GB as a minimum. You will find your game hard pressed to use just 2GB. Optimally 8GB is the current standard for most PC's, but Iracing will be fine with 4GB. SSD'd choice is awesome, I've got one and I fucking love it. The case is a great choice for what it costs.  The power supply is way over kill for this system, the custom sleeving is amazing to have, but this funding could be moved elsewhere. RoseWill makes awesome Power supplies that would fit well here. you really only need about 450W for a system without a beefy Graphics card. If you plan on moving up to something else later, it would be great to get a 850W, but that's mostly for high end duel card setups. Now the GPU, the 8400 should be a bit of a step up from what your describing, but you could get a pretty nice card once you balance out the prices for this. For $150 you can find a new GTX 750 Ti that would work very for Iracing. if want to do used (which is not a bad option) you can find Radeon 7950's, gtx 760's and gtx 670's that has a huge performance boost over the 750. many used cards are well taken care of and can be found off of ebay for some good prices.  If you want me to price out a build for you, I'd be than happy to help!"
iRacing,33q0ny,LightningWing,2,Fri Apr 24 17:03:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah totally agree with that, definitely worth saving some money from the power supply and CPU fan (the stock one will be fine) and spending it on more RAM and a better GPU.  I would also say that an SSD is not essential and you could save a bit more by getting a standard HDD, which would also give you more space. Yes, SSDs are pretty awesome but not very good value at the moment."
iRacing,33q0ny,Mancowpig,3,Fri Apr 24 17:17:28 2015 UTC,"Why are you spending more on your CPU fan than your actual CPU?  Edit: Also if you are trying to go for a budget build then don't spend money on an SSD. IMO, that is a luxury and luxuries are not for budget builds.   You only need like 500w PSU with that build.. No need to go for such a large PSU."
iRacing,33q0ny,MysticalMuffDiver,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:17:06 2015 UTC,"Here is a ~$400 build with newer parts that you can use as a start. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7OIOnAavC0  Feel free to swap some parts if you like, he has other builds at different price points to look at as well.  Also I don't know how good iRacing Linux support is, you might want to look into that first."
iRacing,33q0ny,Watchboy0,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:12:02 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I'll probably end up using Windows instead because I don't think I've seen anybody on here talking about how it runs on a Linux machine. Thanks!
iRacing,33q0ny,belchium,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:46:29 2015 UTC,"First try and get some feedback on the Linux version of iracing. It is is officially 'unsupported'.   For a build with that budget, I'd be inclined to spend less on the PSU, SSD and cooler and more on the graphics card, processor and RAM. Getting a non-OEM processor often comes with a fan- like with the intel i3. The SSD is nice but a bit of a luxury, you can add one later if you want to.   I've tweaked your build with some of my ideas. It's a little cheaper too but I think will serve you much better for iRacing, maybe in general. If you want to spend a little extra I'd say substitute the HDD for your SSD of choice."
iRacing,33q0ny,pleaseexcusemytpyos,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:14:28 2015 UTC,"This is a good recommendation.   Here is my build. http://pcpartpicker.com/p/H2QZrH   It runs iRacing at max settings and more then 200 FPS, although I set it to maintain 90 FPS as that is faster than my monitor can refresh.   Looking at the original build, I would get a better processor and use the stock fan. Spend that $60 on a better processor. You should also do a minimum of 4GB of ram. I you are on a limited budget, I would swap out the SSD for more ram. Also, I am not familiar with that GPU, but at that price, I'd wonder if you wouldn't do better with just using the integrated graphics from an i3 or i5."
iRacing,33mfjy,ASKobayashi,8,Thu Apr 23 18:34:28 2015 UTC,"Welcome! 2 years as your first sub?! That's commitment! I hope you have a good time.  My only advice for the start is to get as much time on track as you can. Get into lots of busy practice sessions to get experience around traffic. Driving a good line is important but knowing how to drive offline around slower cars is critical for survival.  Also, don't let your safety rating or irating (once you are out of rookies) become something you fixate on. Rating and SR and results will all come with time and you should just enjoy the experience for now. You're going to have some ugly races. You're going to get wrecked in turn 1 a few times. It happens to all of us, so be ready for it, try to avoid it, and when you can't avoid it just stay off the microphone, bandage your wounds and come back for another one.  Someone mentioned a nice quote to me the other: It's not knowing how to win but knowing how to lose well that will be the path to success."
iRacing,33mfjy,jrebs,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:54:14 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent quote and great advice!    I don't think Im ready for actual racing (and putting my SR on the line) just yet.  In practice, I've been fairly pleased with my results overall, but I have a real tendency to want to spin out on the last corner before the straight.  It's just too easy to either come in too hot into the uphill right hand corner, hit the brake cresting as the long left starts, or get on the gas too quickly.  They all end up leading to a spin.  Driving me nuts but having a great time with it anyway!  Practice makes perfect..."
iRacing,33mfjy,AR-47,0,Thu Apr 23 19:02:59 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that focusing on SR is bad, but focusing on iRacing isn't as bad.  I fast tracked from D to A class in ovals and road and at one point my road iRacing was only 500.  My Oval iRacing has gradually recovered and is slowly getting good, but roads are still brutal.  Learn how to drive fast or you'll get stuck in bottom splits with people who wreck the most."
iRacing,33mfjy,jrebs,4,Thu Apr 23 19:15:23 2015 UTC,"Focusing on iRating is decidedly bad, IMO. It's something that will end up where it belongs once you've done some dozens or hundreds of races. Fretting about losing or gaining it is just a needless distraction."

iRacing,33mfjy,rancer890,3,Thu Apr 23 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"Well hello!  Based on my experience, find something you enjoy. By that I mean, figure out what gets you happy after racing. For me, I tried to be competitive, and am by no means a slow racer, but at the same time, I'm not going beat any world records. It took a while for me to realize that. So instead of focusing on being hyper competitive, I'm just there for a good time! I would much rather drive a clean race with fun battles and come in 6th than be hyper aggressive and finish higher up in the grid. What you can also do, if you have the time, is get into some form of league that has a nice community (such as the reddit league, for example), and have a blast! Of course, don't forget to try and get higher license levels to get whatever car you're aiming for (for me it was the GT3 field).

Quite frankly, I have better things to do than worry about trying to be the absolute top finisher.  One thing that really hooked me was one of the first practice sessions I ran, I spent 5+ laps trading positions with another driver.  I'd get too excited and overshoot the turn in, then get taken.. so I'd spend the next lap trying to pressure the other racer into making a mistake.  Now I'm no expert driver, but in that whole time we never even had contact.    That sort of thing never happens in Gran Turismo.  Maybe that just means I'm too willing to fall back vs fighting to keep my position, but as you said, I'm in it for the laughs... I don't have anything to prove to anyone! :D"
iRacing,33mfjy,AR-47,3,Thu Apr 23 22:04:28 2015 UTC,"Welcome Mr. Kobayashi. I am glad you have committed for so long and you are enjoying your stay at iRacing so far. :)  You ask for tips, I give you tips:  1) Practice. But make it worthwhile. This means practice the track, practice being near and racing other cars, practice wreck avoidance, practice passing and being passed safely. And of course, practice being around some names you might see during a race and how they take their lines, etc.  2) Do oval and road. If I didn't do ovals I wouldn't be confident as I have now with being with cars side by side. And that is with road and oval. A lot of people (including myself) discounted ovals early...just to end up loving it (and some actually went to ovals exclusively). I have a lot of respect for oval drivers because I can't drive some of the oval cars to save my life. And try racing a NASCAR Sprint Cup car on a road course like Sonoma or Watkins Glen...it's the hardest thing to do. :)  3) Use the iRacing forums. There is a wealth of information like setups, and general banter among people in a specific forum. Immerse yourself into the community and iRacing will be even more awesome than it is for you right now. ;)  4) Be open to what you want in your iRacing career. As said above, some people end up in entirely different series or disciplines. I wanted to become an IndyCar driver, but I ended up in GT3 for road and IndyCar for ovals. IRL, not everyone makes it to F1, but they can make a career in Sports Cars, or IndyCar, or from open-wheelers to Stock Cars...try a bit of everything and you'll stick with something you enjoy. :)  5) Race within your limits. Understanding your strengths and weaknesses is very important. Knowing how much you can push is more important than pure speed over a short period of time.   6) Be a willing learner. You will be overwhelmed when you start a new series, and you might have to learn some things. When I first started GT3, I spent 7 hours doing practice and setup before I attempted a race. This week I just asked thebaconlard for a setup because I was too lazy and tired and generally a noob at Silverstone vs Road America (lol) but I can still adjust to my liking because I know how to tweak it. You might have to learn new cars and tracks, and even setups, but if you spend time to learn, you will figure things out eventually. I'm not even very good at setup (honesty, most guys aren't that good at setup), so if I can do it, you can too. ;)  7) When you are more experienced, don't care about SR and iR. Honesty, if you can keep the car on the track and not be reckless with divebombs, your SR and iR will take care of itself!  8) If you read the above 7 points without skimming, good job. If not, reread. Because if you haven't even read this without skimming, I'm sure you didn't read through the Document and Tools tab on iRacing. ;)"
iRacing,33mfjy,lagatron,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:59:43 2015 UTC,"Hello there!  Great list!  I actually did read every single point and had a good laugh when I got to the last point.  Regarding 3 and 6) How quickly should I start paying attention to setups? This is one area I've always pretty much avoided in Turismo, and I can only assume it is far more involved in iRacing.  That being said I'm an engineer (albeit not mechanical or automotive) so I revel in technical details.  It's more a matter of feeling like my laps are consistent enough to evaluate a technical change.    Re 4) Currently I think GT3 is my destination though I'm not acutely aware of all the options out there.  While F1 is cool I don't particularly enjoy racing it in turismo.  Re 7) I still have some learning to do here.  I spun a few more laps last night in some heavy traffic.  I was able to avoid pretty much all the wrecks around me, but at least once I could see that the guy in front of me was going to wreck but I didn't back off and let it happen.  Instead I kept my line since I was having a good lap.  This was a mistake as I ended up having to swerve and ruin my lap anyway.    Speaking of turning a few laps last night, I'm super happy with how it went! Won my practice session @ Charolette in the mx-5.  Fastest: 1:24.550 Average 1:25.574 over 17 laps!  I don't really know how that compares to all you long time iRacers, but I felt like i was slowly pushing my lap times faster and faster and it felt amazing."
iRacing,33mfjy,wizzems,2,Fri Apr 24 13:59:51 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks. ;)  3 and 6) I would say focus on your driving first before going into setups. Since you are still a rookie (trust me, once you get into D-Class, you are still a rookie ;)), it's best to focus on becoming a better iRacer than setup. Besides, if you move up from the Mazda Cup to let's say the Production Car Challenge (with the Roadster and the Solstice) there's not much to setup anyway. It's all down to your driving ability. :)  I would say once you feel confident in the slower cars (MX5 Cup, Solstice, Skippy), you can try the Mustang. I only bought it a couple days ago haha but from what I see it's easier than setting up for example a GT3 car. My first question is always: How do I make my setup go faster? Then it's usually ""How do I make my car consistent over race distance?"" Then you change settings again. It's great that iRacing has different tool tips in the setup to tell you want each change does.  4) GT3 is a good series, even though some drivers are a bit wreckless. You can go from MX5 -> Solstice -> Caddy/Mustang -> Adv MX5/Vette -> GT3. Or be like me and go from MX5 -> Caddy -> GT3. Best thing is that there's no magic formula to get to a series . But learn all you can from the lower series.   7) Yes, avoiding wrecks is important in Rookie. Maybe you can get some side by side racing, but it's best to feel your way through in the early going and analyze your opponents in the first couple laps. In wreck avoidance, it's better to slow down to help you analyze the situation rather than the Days of Thunder ""Drive Through It"" mentality lol.   And nice work at Charlotte Road. The best thing is, the more practice, the more faster and comfortable you will get. If you can manage that over race distance, you will definitely improve. Because I can see you got the right mentality as a rookie. :)"

Lap 1 + 2 - go slow, Look at the apexes and ripple strips and what could be the most efficient lines Lap 3> - build up speed, when coming into a corner, pick a braking spot such as a set of cones, a distance marker, change in sponsorship sign on the fence - depending on your graphics settings there will be a varying number of these handy markers. See how you go around the corner and adjust your braking point accordingly (sometimes i have to say okay, wait a tinnnny little bit after the 2 marker for example).  It's important to remember however that if you catch a slipstream down a main straight, you will be travelling faster than usual and your breaking point will need to be adjusted. Similarly, Taking an inside line into the corner will require a different braking point depending if you are trying to dive down the inside or simply hold someone off"

iRacing,33nyzf,randomkontot,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:04:11 2015 UTC,"As said by others it's all about learning the track at first and then it's about finding markers that work for you.  Try not to use shadows as in time they will move. Look for brake markers boards, curbs, rubber marks in braking zones, trees, bits of dirt, trees, signs, specific letters on signs  anything you can use.  I sometimes even set my gearing so that when I am about to red line or it's time to change gear it's time to brake for a specific corner. The other thing that makes braking more consistent can be better pedals.  You will generally find it easier to be consistent braking with a load cell pedal compared to say the standard DFGT pedals."

Winning is fun sure, but if it's everything you should re-evaluate.  Also agree, everyone could use a good talking to a therapist. Honestly, it will help.

iRacing,33n42u,iracer46,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:14:11 2015 UTC,"I'm going to give you some advice that's frequently given in League of Legends, which is a very different sport/game but it's still relevant: you need to learn to manage your mindset.  You are on tilt, which means your frustration is causing you to perform poorly and stopping you from improving. You're burnt out. Your situation will not get better until you remember that the main reason to race is because it's fun! You've lost touch with that fact and you need to give yourself a break. Forget about trying to win and trying to get the best times for a while. Take it easy, practice without putting pressure on yourself, and just have fun driving. I promise you that you'll see a huge difference once you get that load off your mind and get your mentality in check. Mentality is EVERYTHING.   After a few days or a few weeks once you're feeling better you can start pushing yourself again, but once you start getting angry you need to stop for the day and come back tomorrow. You're only hurting yourself and your driving by getting frustrated and continuing to race. You WILL NOT improve in that state.  In League, we say: First, play to have fun. Then, don't play to win, play to improve. Winning will come naturally after that."

We need more people like you [and Aaron T.] so keep it up guys wether your videos are live commentary or something else entirely.  Back on topic. I'm sitting on some iracing credits pondering purchase of 3 road courses or 2 tracks/1 car.

Monza is an AMAZING track in this car and I thought I made a reasonably fun promotional video.  If this was a inappropriate video for this sub Im happy to refrain in the future. What qualms do you have with it?
iRacing,33ilmb,Speedly,2,Thu Apr 23 03:23:27 2015 UTC,"All I saw was a video with (basically) nothing but a lap at Monza. There are a lot of people who fly in here, dump a video from their stream in a feeble attempt to bump up their numbers on their channel, and are never seen again.  If you're trying to drum up interest in the GT1 series (something I wholeheartedly support!), please say so next time!"
iRacing,33ilmb,Speedly,5,Thu Apr 23 03:29:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry. The video description had all that info in it. I wanted the video to be more about the race and the excitement.  I should have left a comment or been more verbose. Certainly with RES you don't catch the description. My bad.  Thank you :) I'll do better in the future.  I try to be a very active participant of here and /r/simracing. I do want my channel to grow obviously but I want it to be a two way street.

You can continue to do as you do and I shall do the same.  I'd suggest you might repel viewers with your occasional very drunk streams. You would probably argue that you don't care about viewer counts, but I am doubtful of this given that you just state viewer counts in your reply, so it's obviously something you pay attention to. With the high volume of people trying to get viewers for their youtube channels and streams, viewers will be much more quick to dismiss a source that doesn't deliver well based on a first impression than to continue giving it a chance to find out if maybe some of the other videos are worth their time.

iRacing,335yqo,hikinkycat,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:21:21 2015 UTC,I'm curious (I'm new to iRacing). About how much % is overusing/underusing your tires? Thanks
iRacing,335yqo,tstraw48,2,Mon Apr 20 03:08:58 2015 UTC,"Well you want to be able to make a full fuel run on a set of tires without completely obliterating one tire.  (Oval info) What I use tire %s for is to do a short run 15-25 laps and then look at the percentages to see where the car will go. You want as even across the rights as you can get. And you can sometimes change the wear by shifting your line around a bit.  Main points I look at: If the car has less % left on the right front, I'll be tighter later. Vise versa for less % left on the right rear, I'll be looser later. It can aid you in setting up cars without having to do really long race runs to find the setup. (Same way NASCAR teams do it. Tire temps & looks)"

iRacing,335yqo,JKraems,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:39:32 2015 UTC,"Well there's no set 'critical' point.. It depends on your setup. On most occasions 4 tires are better, I have had it work out a few times in my favor for pulling a 2 tire stop and getting really good track position. I would say if you're doing a 10-15 lap run, 2 tires can hold on as strong as 4... but you need a good handling car to make it work as well."
iRacing,335yqo,arsenicfox,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:07:22 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how many laps you've been on them. Its more a personal thing, see how long you can run a set of tires and check the tire wear when you think you've had enough."

iRacing,334keq,bigbobnukes,7,Sun Apr 19 14:08:47 2015 UTC,I've done both and prefer the triples. In iracing you can render all three screens so no stretching or warping is evident.  And personally i found it was easier to get a better field of view for what I liked.    I had previously used a 50 in tv which worked well but I was always sitting too far away.  If I had to do it all over again I'd wait for CV1 and will probably pick one up when they start shipping.
iRacing,334keq,ahlersprix,2,Sun Apr 19 14:32:05 2015 UTC,"This. I'v recently gone from using a 55"" TV to 3x 27"" IPS displays. You get a much better sense of immersion from the triples as they fill your periphery. In saying that, I only race in my DK2 in iRacing. The resolution will get better with CV1 or the Vive but even in my DK2 it is a next level experience and when racing ovals where the res isn't so important, the nose to bumper racing is heart pounding."

iRacing,334keq,SirBensalot,5,Mon Apr 20 15:33:36 2015 UTC,"I would go for triple screen and it is what I prefer.  On closed cockpit cars, you're not gaining much with a larger monitor, just more roof/dash view and a little bid wider view.  With triple monitors you get a lot more of your sides, which allows you to not need look left/right and you can use your peripheral vision.  If you're calculating screen distance and screen size in iRacing, each view is going to get you a 1:1 ratio.  Otherwise you'll have a steering wheel that's not proportioned right and just doesn't make you ""feel"" like you're in a car.  To grasp this visually, I put up some pictures.  The red is your 23"" triple screen view and green will be your 45"" view.    Here is a combined view showing what view points you'd get with both monitor setups.  Notice how the larger monitor will get you a wider view than a single 23"" monitor, but you don't gain much vertical besides more roof above and then arms and your feet below.  Here's a standalone 45"" view  Here's a standalone triple 23"" view  Notice that you see everything you need in the triple screen mode, but are cut off a bit on your 45"".  Now this isn't EXACTLY what you'll see.  Because if you sit your screens close to you and wrap them around you, you can see further out both side windows.  Which is another advantage to a triple screen over a single screen."
iRacing,334keq,HerpDerpenberg,5,Mon Apr 20 04:45:06 2015 UTC,"Triples.  I went from 65"" to 3 27"" and would never go back.  I was going to wait for CV1 but was tired of waiting and figured I had a year or more for the bugs of CV1 to be worked out."

iRacing,334keq,Krazykorean827,2,Sun Apr 19 14:59:27 2015 UTC,Triples but only for a sim rig. Being able to see cars to the side of you and the apex in the distance is great. I prefer one large screen for every other genre though.

iRacing,32z5do,Ayemeagan,8,Fri Apr 17 23:01:48 2015 UTC,"I think the term you are looking for is ""cockpit"". This cockpit is called the Obutto R3Volution, it is very well known and many sim racers have it: http://www.mainperformancepc.com/product/obutto-gaming-cockpits/obutto-r3volution-gaming-cockpit/  It is on the higher end of your budget, shipping will probably put you at $800.  If you actually meant just the seat, Playseat is a great choice. It is again, used by many sim racers and has a great reputation. They have many to choose from. Here's a link: http://www.playseat.com/gaming-seats"
iRacing,32z5do,mason07,5,Fri Apr 17 23:12:03 2015 UTC,"Ditto on the Obutto, probably the best option there is for the price and they are widely used in the iRacing community. I cant wait for my Ozone I pre-ordered to get here in June-ish"
iRacing,32z5do,XxHaagxX,3,Fri Apr 17 23:18:39 2015 UTC,i would avoid seats with center posts. You husband might only have two pedals right now but i'm sure hell want to heel toe in the future and center post makes it bothersome. I've gotten Playseat when i was a stinking noob and it just doesnt break so there is no reason to replace it!   Also i got my triple monitor stand from http://www.sim-seats.com and it's a solid piece of kit at a reasonable price. I think they sell seats too. I dont own one but based on my experience with their monitor stand - which is well done - i think its worth bringing into discussion.

iRacing,32vf3j,Execrat0r,3,Fri Apr 17 01:06:21 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the comparison to AC, but I own all of the GT3 cars in iRacing and if I could only own 1, it would be the BMW.  It is the easiest car to handle in my opinion, and it is always competitive.  Some tracks suit certain cars over others, but the BMW has a nice balance that feels good on every circuit I have driven it on over the last 2 seasons."
iRacing,32vf3j,redpedals,4,Fri Apr 17 03:26:07 2015 UTC,"One of the things I really liked about it compared to other GT3 cars was the fact that it was fairly hard to get the back to fly out, it seemed to essentially stick to the track. Would you say that the iRacing version behaves similarly?"
iRacing,32vf3j,david-4,2,Fri Apr 17 03:43:51 2015 UTC,It has probably the slidiest rear end of the GT3 cars in iRacing. The McLaren and RUF have mid/rear engines and so a lot of rear grip. The Ford is similar to the BMW but I haven't driven it enough to really tell you.   I would agree that it's the most consistent performer and it's the easiest to drive to it's potential.
iRacing,32vf3j,slobbishbodysfw,3,Fri Apr 17 04:00:21 2015 UTC,"To tag along with this.  The RUF, since it's rear-engined, has a lot of power-off oversteer.  The BMW has a bit of power-on oversteer, but that can easily be compensated for with TCS and minor setup changes.  The weight problem in the RUF is much harder to balance out."
iRacing,32vf3j,redpedals,2,Fri Apr 17 13:18:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, if you have never driven a Rear Engined car in a sim before, the RUF can be a bit of a rude awakening (although, it is good fun once you figure it out and you also get the CSPEC when you purchase the car)."
iRacing,32vf3j,AM150,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:53:11 2015 UTC,"I always find the RUF to feel the most responsive and nimblest of the GT3 cars (I've driven them all, only spent significant time in the RUF and BMW). The BMW feels like I'm fighting it's weight, the RUF feels like you can make it dance."
iRacing,32vf3j,redpedals,2,Fri Apr 17 23:52:28 2015 UTC,"I would agree that the back sticks veey well under braking and midcorner.  Since it is the only front engine gt3 car in the game, you can lose it coming out of the corner if you get on the throttle too quickly (compared to the RUF, which has all the weight in the back so it is more difficult to brake and trail brake, but gets out of corners with more ease).  The throttle of the bmw is not that hard to manage, though, and easily the best all around performer imo."
iRacing,32vf3j,MAD_JIHAD,3,Fri Apr 17 15:54:13 2015 UTC,"I think empty box did a comparison video and said they were very similar, or was it another car?  Edit: From my experience with the L49 in both games, they have a lot of similarities but the AC one feels like it has to much grip, even on a non optimal track surface."
iRacing,32vf3j,AR-47,2,Fri Apr 17 05:42:29 2015 UTC,I bought the iRacing Lotus 49 after loving the one in AC.  Felt like I was driving on ice first time I used it.  The Assetto Corsa one feels like iRacing's Lotus 49 with modern brakes and tires.

iRacing,32t0v8,RileyF1,6,Thu Apr 16 14:45:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, and I would also add that the whole ""start from the pits"" popular advice is ruining higher classes, because you can clearly see that some people never learned to hold their line in pack, yet they are class C for some reason.

iRacing,32t0v8,AMDnoob,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:37:32 2015 UTC,"while its a good thing obviously its still luck involved in doing that.  you can race as clean as you want when there is someone behind you that completely misses his braking point he is going to take you out.   the right approach is trying to race clean as you did. but you are only in 3 races and you will learn soon enough that you cant finish every race with 0 incidents.   also i would like to add that often when people are talking about how hard it is to survive rookies they are talking about ovals. surviving rookies there is obviously harder since its way more wheel to wheel and sideby side with people who are not confident and experienced enough to do that.  still, congrats on getting your road licence. keep enjoying you time in iracing and mabye join us in the skippy series and we might see us sometime on track."
iRacing,32s17l,ecstone,10,Thu Apr 16 06:29:28 2015 UTC,"I found road rookie to be much more manageable than Oval. If things get bad you can at least avoid other drivers for half the race by starting from the pits.   Gateway on Oval basically gives you no chance to avoid idiot drivers.

iRacing,32p0td,Squiblez,11,Wed Apr 15 15:38:06 2015 UTC,"it all depends on how competitive you want to be. To be in the top splits, you will certainly need some dedication. But the bright side is that any amount of time of you can find will be enjoyed on iRacing.  Recently i`ve stepped up my hours to be more competitive in a private League (iRacing Brasil).   But don`t get me wrong, there is a lot of fun races on lower splits as well, you gotta know your limitations (time and skill) as this is a game that really pays off to practice a lot."
iRacing,32p0td,O_Solid,5,Wed Apr 15 16:03:38 2015 UTC,"Some tracks I just 'get' and I'll spend 3/4 hours practicing.  Some car and track combo's I'll spend 12/15 hours until I am comfortable going in for a race.   Do bare in mind though, that although you may feel you have mastered a track/car there will ALWAYS be a faster line, faster setup etc etc for you to try.   I truly feel that, that is the JOY of iRacing!  TL;DR - as much as I can, and I ENJOY putting in the practice."
iRacing,32p0td,cuntalist,3,Wed Apr 15 15:51:33 2015 UTC,"To add to your good advice, once you get into your first race on a new track you will need to think about where it is safe to overtake or not.  I made the mistake of trying to overtake at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve after the long straight going into the braking zone.  Had my first major cock up there.  Learned a valuable lesson from it."

iRacing,32p0td,kh1818,5,Wed Apr 15 16:05:49 2015 UTC,"My schedule changes week to week, and I play as my free time allows.  Since you haven't played in 2 years, it may take ~5 hours or so to get used to the feel of the sim again, maybe less.  After that, I would recommend referencing the forums for track walk-throughs.  For example, this week I decided to jump into the spec racer ford season.  If you go to iracing forums -> spec racer ford, you can find a thread titled ""Weekly challenge - week 5 - phillip island"".  In there you can find a car setup made for that course to use, as well as videos which talk you turn by turn to help familiarize yourself with the track.  Utilizing the setups found in the forums as well as watching the videos can really help reduce the amount of time required to be competitive in races.  Having never done Phillip Island before, I practiced for about 2 hours before attempting my first race, and ended up winning.  So really, iRacing can be fun with just several hours of investment per week, sometimes even less.  The more hours you rack up, the better you get over time as well."
iRacing,32p0td,ArcticEngineer,3,Wed Apr 15 15:54:22 2015 UTC,"Ah thanks for the info. I didn't realize the forums were such a good resource, i can't wait to dig into those course walkthroughs."
iRacing,32p0td,BGaviator13,3,Wed Apr 15 22:50:16 2015 UTC,All up to you. You put as much time into it as you want to or can and make the most out of it.   One good thing to do since most of the road series are open setup is to grab setups off the forums and tweak them to your liking. It could take hours of practice for one series just to build a competitive setup. Almost every road series besides the F1 series shares setups.
iRacing,32p0td,Vulfilla,3,Wed Apr 15 15:52:01 2015 UTC,"You can usually get shared setups in practice sessions if it looks like you're putting the work in and ask nicely.  Just never ask for a setup during warmup. You might get one, but people will start treating you different if you become a repeat offender that just shows up with little practice and asks for setups."

iRacing,32p0td,Itsjorgehernandez,3,Wed Apr 15 16:17:24 2015 UTC,"I started up last fall and I am primarily into road racing as well.  Obviously, the road courses take a little bit longer to get down, but it shouldn't be that much work to get yourself ready to be racing safely.    To compete consistently in a single series, you will need to race once a week (say a 1 hour commitment, roughly).  To practice and qualify would probably be another 1 to 1.5 hours (whether it is right before the race or at a different time is completely up to you, your qualifying session can be at any time during the same week, before your race).  In all, about 2 hours a week total split between 2 different sessions.  You won't be the best out there, but it should be enough to have some good battles and have fun given that you are a prudent, patient racer.    The more you race with the same car, the quicker you will learn tracks and the more competitive you will become.  In general, you will also begin to learn tracks more quickly with general experience across different series.  Also, watching replays of the faster cars in open practices will help you learn the racing lines/ braking points much faster.    Good luck and I hope you have fun with it!"
iRacing,32p0td,Tex-Rob,2,Wed Apr 15 15:53:25 2015 UTC,I really only race on weekends. I work 14 hours a day so I'm just exhausted by the time I get home. Usually Saturday's the best day for me. All you really need to invest is an hour or two for one or two races plus qualifying if you're into qualifying...
iRacing,32p0td,skell15,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"As someone who started earlier this year I will add to what others are saying from my point of view, and what others sometimes neglect to mention.  I'm 37, have been playing racing games a long time.  So, I know a handful of the tracks from games, but even the tracks I know the turns at, are much different (more realistic in iRacing).  I think the hardest part about iRacing early on is being both new in the cars, and new at the tracks.  I have gotten really comfortable with tracks like Lime Rock, Summit Point, Monza, Laguna Seca, etc so that when I want to race them in a new car, it's not near as bad as it was earlier.  I also find it easier to go back to certain cars, because of the amount of seat time I have in them.  For instance, the Cadillac, I didn't race for over a month, and then picked it up again for Monza and had one of the fastest qualifying times at the start of the week, and was getting top 5s in the top split races.  So my point is, lack of time will limit you some, but it gets better the more experienced you become.  Look at people like Matt Orr (EmptyBox), he jumps around from road to oval, in almost every kind of car and does well.  Sure he's a good driver, but he's also been doing iRacing for over 5 years I think."

iRacing,32p0td,P-Nuts,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:31:34 2015 UTC,"For me to feel prepared... it was about 1-2 hours of practice before I would put in before doing qualifying and a race.  I find if I don't put in an hour or more, I don't have the focus and consistency I need to actually enjoy the full race experience.  I end up making silly mistakes and getting frustrated, and that ruins it for me.  Due to my personal time getting split up so much (family with young child, and another expected at the end of this year), I had to put iRacing on the shelf for now.  But I'll be back... once those kids have consistent sleep schedule and I can commit the time I need.  I look forward to my return and seeing how much iRacing has progressed."
iRacing,32p0td,speedkinduci,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:59:50 2015 UTC,"I find I need 100-200 laps practice before I'm fast and consistent at a new track/car combination, but plenty of people seem to manage on much less."
iRacing,32p0td,maneaserban,1 point,Thu Apr 16 09:02:19 2015 UTC,"To answer the Squiblez question in short i would simply say as much as you need before you feel you can run your choice of car & track for race distance without spinning or crashing.   For some this will take no time, whilst others will need a lot more practice. It's also obviously car and track dependent.   Personally i race many classes each week and generally do little practice other than about an hours worth prior to league event races. That works for me as i'm already comfortable in the car and on the track. Generally my main goals of practice are to get some consistency and to locate exactly where the track limits are on certain sections. Must avoid those slowdown penalties ;)"

It will give you a good baseline understanding of what the various adjustments ""should"" do to the car. (Side benefit - if you're a racing fan, it will really help you appreciate what is going on as you watch F1, Indycar, etc.)  I'm usually about ~1-1.5s/lap off of the aliens in iRacing, so usually what I'll do is borrow one of their setups from the forum and then tweak it a little to fit my driving style."

I do better when I have a teammate to bounce ideas off of as well as verify what I am feeling from changes.  Another good part of that was someone to just sit and chat with and make the whole process less tedious.  That is what always allowed me to spend any real amount of time working on a setup.  If you find some setups being shared on the forums, which I've never had a problem finding, then use those and adjust as you see fit.

And another one there.  I honestly wish they'd turn down the track-off boundaries in iRacing.    Very cool about seeing the WEC race - great action between Porsche and Audi.  I'll be down at COTA for the WEC race in September.

I've no real complaints about the iRacing system except in spots where the track boundary isn't obvious.
iRacing,32o3xv,Fuzzwah,3,Wed Apr 15 13:47:41 2015 UTC,"It feels like to me that on tracks with lots of paved run off, they make the off-track boundaries tighter than say a track with grass or gravel, so that drivers who driver mostly tracks like COTA don't end up with an SR advantage."

iRacing,32o3xv,Pill_Cosby,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:04:53 2015 UTC,"It's not ""never cross a line"" it's ""only cross the line if you have to""   Taking a 1x to avoid an incident or something is no big deal and only having an incident like that won't hurt your SR. If you're dropping wheels all over the place it becomes an issue, but that's not how you'd be driving in real life is it?

It wasn't until I heard the second one, shortly after seeing the second one, that I realized what was going on.  But that got me thinking, are there many games that factor in the discrepancy between the speed of sound and the speed of light?  The only one I know and remember that accurately portrays the delay between seeing something happen and hearing it happen is Rise of Flight.  I remember being really impressed by that since I can't remember encountering it in any other game.  And it can actually be sort of important when it comes to dogfighting in sims, since in other sims you might hear the guns/cannons firing at you with no delay and can take evasive action based on the sounds even if you can't see the tracers right away.  So as you might imagine, it can give you a little unrealistic ""advantage"" in that you can take said evasive action that much earlier if you happen to get jumped without noticing (or hell, even if you do notice and they have you in a tail chase and they're on the edge of being within firing range)."

I've actually watched quite a few ArmA videos because I've been contemplating picking it up, but I have to admit I never noticed the sound delay before.  Probably because it's natural in real life, so when it happens in game or in a video of a game, I probably just don't notice it since it's not exactly unnatural."

iRacing,32l0de,aliencougar,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:12:39 2015 UTC,"Obviously any adjustment will affect handling to some degree, whether you feel it or not. Lowering the car with no other changes will lower the center of gravity and will affect various other aspects of geometry.  To answer your question, though, I think if what you're trying to do is change the right height and as little else as possible, then you want to play with spring perch offsets (of course...this depends which car you're using). Spring perch offset is how high the suspension is mounted. So if you decrease this number, then you are essentially raising the body of the car and vice versa when increasing the number. As you move the offset up (lowering the car), you may need to stiffen suspension or make other changes to account for the ride height (bottoming out, etc)."

Now here me out on this, but sometimes you need to let a setup sit for 24 hours and then evaluate if you like the changes or not. Often in practice if you turn a bunch of laps in a tight car and then switch to a neutral setup it'll feel really loose and icy, and vice versa. But then you come back 24 hours later and the car feels fine. If the suspension already felt good, and the ride heights are where they need to be, you may just need to tune your driving after making an adjustment."
iRacing,32l0de,Vulfilla,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:33:44 2015 UTC,"I am trying to keep the rake the same by lowering all four corners at a time. Iam still pretty new, but I figured I would get the car sitting as low as possible and then come up a bit in the rear to control downforce."
iRacing,32l0de,Vulfilla,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:47:29 2015 UTC,"If you lower all four corners at the same time, and stop when one of the corners starts blinking, you haven't affected the rake. If the fronts are yellow and you continue decreasing the rear heights you will definitely be decreasing the rake, and vice versa.   Most of the short track cars handle best with maximum rake, speedway cars either have some rake for downforce or should be at minimum rake to reduce drag. It's more of a fine line on the larger tracks."
iRacing,32l0de,rugbybro2,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:51:13 2015 UTC,"Why does the bristol gen 6 baseline setup have so much negative rake?  I noticed the same thing at Martinsville.  My garage sheet says the ride height is lower in the front than at the rear, but you can clearly see alot of negative rake on the car in the replays.  Is there a reson for this?  Do gen6 cars need to have negative rake at short tracks for some reason?"
iRacing,32l0de,modern_knight,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:31:02 2015 UTC,What car? If its the cup car you want to be on the shock springs and use the packers to control the ride heights in the corner. Run max arm asymmetry to keep the lf pinned.

iRacing,32gjql,randomkontot,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:42:33 2015 UTC,Fair point
iRacing,32gjql,Vulfilla,5,Mon Apr 13 18:01:53 2015 UTC,"real life   That's only F1 to my knowledge, it's advisory in other series too.  Honestly, I think that having compulsory blue flags would be terrible. Requiring drivers to move out of the way is going to create situations where drivers get a blue flag, panic or just plain don't think, and then move off the racing line and braking way too early, right in to the path of the leading car who was about to pass them.   Drivers are much more predictable when they just follow the racing line like everyone else. If they want to move out of the way, that's great, but I'd like for them to do it in their own time when it is convenient to them and the leader like what occurs right now. If the leader is getting fed up and wants you to move immediately, they'll let you know that too but it's a rarer occurrence than people make it out to be.   The only time blue flags ever really cause an issue is when a fast car has an issue and ends up in the same group of cars they were running with previously, but a lap down. Which is really specific to be accounting for in a rule."
iRacing,32gjql,Nevil-Clavain,3,Mon Apr 13 17:44:10 2015 UTC,Actually the US is the outlier in this. Every other series in the world enforces blue flags. And rightly so. I'd like to see it in iRacing too but I agree it is not feasible.
iRacing,32gjql,bostromnz,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:43:34 2015 UTC,"Is it really an F1-specific rule?  I'll admit F1 is mostly what I follow; I just assumed it was the same in other series as well.  Also, I could definitely see where it could cause problems with inexperienced drivers not knowing what to do, but then again, there are plenty of things inexperienced drivers don't know how to do (up to and including 'drive a car' in some extreme cases)- wouldn't this simply be one more part of racecraft to be learnt?"
iRacing,32gjql,cuntalist,5,Mon Apr 13 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"In America (SCCA Specifically) the Blue flag is an advisory flag that there is a fast car coming up from behind (faster car, class, etc) not even necessarily a car lapping you either. Drivers are not required to move over, but that said it is common courtesy to let them play thru so to speak where it is safe and when you can signal to them your intentions. Otherwise, hold a predictable line and not make sudden changes."
iRacing,32gjql,Vulfilla,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:08:40 2015 UTC,"Huh, I didn't know that.  Like I said, I just sort of assumed it was a universal thing.  Why is observation of a blue flag required in Formula 1 then, I wonder?"
iRacing,32gjql,cuntalist,3,Mon Apr 13 18:11:41 2015 UTC,Well in F1 i means Bernie Says move if you ask me.
iRacing,32gjql,emersonlakeandlagoon,4,Mon Apr 13 18:14:17 2015 UTC,If only I had thought before I drove....
iRacing,32gjql,SuperZapp,2,Mon Apr 13 19:57:14 2015 UTC,"Overtaking is hard enough in F1. Nobody wants to see a car pushing for a podium held up for several laps behind a lapped car. Personally I think blue flags should be enforced but that requires sensible drivers, i.e. pulling out of the racing line on a straight and not suddenly slowing."
iRacing,32gjql,BGaviator13,2,Tue Apr 14 21:51:06 2015 UTC,"Also, to jump on to this, what about yellow flags.   Can you still pass whilst they are being displayed? Real life racing you aren't allowed... But in iRacing?  Tia.   Sorry to OP for jumping on to this btw, and sorry I can't help!"
iRacing,32gjql,Vulfilla,2,Mon Apr 13 17:31:51 2015 UTC,"Another good point, actually"
iRacing,32gjql,Vulfilla,2,Mon Apr 13 17:38:30 2015 UTC,"Technically, according to rules atleast, it's illegal to pass under a local yellow. However, I haven't ever actually seen this enforced nor have I ever seen a situation where it would need to be enforced so I don't know.  I assume you would be told to give the position back if you entirely passed another car under a local yellow."
iRacing,32gjql,pipboyforpipgirl,3,Mon Apr 13 17:46:09 2015 UTC,Any redditors wanting to give this a try in a hosted session?
iRacing,32gjql,pipboyforpipgirl,2,Mon Apr 13 17:54:42 2015 UTC,I think this would be very hard to program correctly.  I know in other games when the blue flag is on I'd get black flagged as soon as anyone was even remotely behind me.  It's too much of a judgement call to automate.
iRacing,32gjql,midlifemomo,0,Mon Apr 13 18:00:42 2015 UTC,"Perhaps if it was a reasonable time limit?  I.e. you have 1 minute (or whatever) from being shown a blue flag to let the car behind past, otherwise receive a penalty?"

It is going to be running with the Corvette next season.  The GT3 V12 Vantage will be next.  Then there is another 2 Aston Martin cars which they haven't announced yet.
iRacing,32b285,maneaserban,2,Sun Apr 12 05:37:02 2015 UTC,"Do we have to buy each one separately, or will they be added to the original purchase as a single package?"
iRacing,32b285,InZomnia365,1 point,Sun Apr 12 19:17:14 2015 UTC,"It depends. I don't know Aston Martin's lineup, but if they release say a V12 Vantage GT3 and a V12 Vantage road car or GT1/2 (again I don't know their real lineup so I'm just making up examples), you'll probably only pay once. If it's a different car model, a Vantage and a DB9, you'll probably pay separately. That's how they've done it before."

iRacing,32dha9,Dr_Teflon,2,Sun Apr 12 21:51:15 2015 UTC,My Profiler settings are the same as yours except for 2 settings:  Damper Effect Strength (the 3rd slider) down: my setting is 100%. I believe that with this setting you can then let iRacing control damping. It probably doesn't make any difference since we both have damping at 0 in iRacing.  Enable Centering Spring (the 1st checkbox): mine is not checked. You don't want a centering spring on a steering wheel in my opinion.  My iRacing settings are also similar with the following differences:  I have the Use linear mode checkbox checked  My strength is 4.0 and Min. force is 4.0%. But I don't like really strong FFB so that's all about preference.
iRacing,32dha9,Sasken,2,Sun Apr 12 22:36:38 2015 UTC,I run the same settings in the Logitech profile.   In game I use 15 strength and 14 min force.   That min force was what the wheel check util advised when I ran it.
iRacing,32dha9,Fuzzwah,2,Sun Apr 12 22:36:55 2015 UTC,"http://www.edracing.com/edr/Logitech_G27.php  This is what I used. I did crank up the force more for my liking. It's still a bit jittery, but I think that's the nature of the beast with out having a belt drive."
iRacing,32dha9,theendoftheinternet,2,Sun Apr 12 22:41:36 2015 UTC,"I worked using this one as well, but I would make the min-force somewhere between 10-15 based on wheel check. I run around 20-22% and modify on the fly based on feel."
iRacing,32bxso,Kubi74,2,Sun Apr 12 13:47:37 2015 UTC,"4 of any D-class race, even 4 of the same. Thy have to be official and be at your license level. Rookie races won't count towards promotion. Of course, it all counts for SR and IR."
iRacing,32bxso,midlifemomo,2,Sun Apr 12 13:55:20 2015 UTC,thanks!
iRacing,32bxso,del13r,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:13:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Promotion relates to 2 things. Firstly, MPR or Minimum participation requirements, where you have to enter 4 races of the same class of your license. Once that is fulfilled, the next thing you need is to have your SR above 2.0 to avoid being demoted to a lower license at the end of the season."
iRacing,32bxso,midlifemomo,2,Sun Apr 12 19:12:04 2015 UTC,"Disagree with what? You paraphrased what I said, and added more about what can happen at the end of the season. We both missed the fact that higher-level races can count too.  So, thanks for agreeing with me and adding more info for the OP."
iRacing,32bxso,midlifemomo,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"It's all good. My answer was directed at ""4 different races needed?"" By clarifying that those 4 can't be rookie, I probably did confuse the matter and suggest rookie races don't count at all. SR always counts."
iRacing,32bxso,theendoftheinternet,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:53:58 2015 UTC,You can enter races above your class if you have a 4.0 and they will count towards mpr.
iRacing,32bxso,theendoftheinternet,2,Mon Apr 13 10:24:08 2015 UTC,"A bit of misinformation in here. Del is right for the most part.   I have no interest in racing at the lower levels and am fast tracking to gt3. If you go the the page that lists all the available series, you will notice that series that are higher than what you are currently allow to run, but they will state that d4.0 or c4.0 can run in them. These races will count towards your mpr!  For example- I am currently c3.47 and I am not a fan of any of the c race options and I don't want to buy a car just to get through the license. So I can drop back to rookie Mazda, start from the pits, cruise around in the back taking it slow until I hit a 4.0, then I can go to the gt3 cars, which require a b license, run 2 clean races to keep my sr higher than 4.0, and I will then get the b license.   I hope that run on sentence is not too hard to understand.   If you not having races with less than 3 incident points, then you are racing and not advancing. Don't worry about irating if you are not where you want to be license wise."
iRacing,32bxso,theendoftheinternet,2,Sun Apr 12 23:02:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, just so I am clear... why would you need only 2 races and not 4?"
iRacing,32bxso,del13r,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:58:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not at the computer, but I think you need 2 races or 4 time trials to advance in most licenses. I could be very wrong."

iRacing,325wb2,Tex-Rob,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:44:14 2015 UTC,"This is true, but an explanation would help.  Basically, if you only know how to take one line, you're going to get good at hot lapping.  In a race, when you are forced to take turns at differing lines, you're not going to be good at making it stick.  First turn pileups is the first thing that comes to mind.  You've got to figure out how to adjust, and in your defense, a lot of that can only be learned in actual races."
iRacing,325wb2,mav3r1ck92691,4,Tue Apr 14 17:18:15 2015 UTC,"Seriously, turn it off haha.  I used to use it for the same reason, but it actually hinders you.  You will learn that line, then have to re-learn the right lines.  Go out a bit slow, and make sure you are getting around the track and hitting your apexes, then adjust as needed and bring up the pace.    I used to think I absolutely needed to use it to learn a track, but now I am able to just do a couple slow ones and start pushing the pace hard."
iRacing,325wb2,Sasken,3,Fri Apr 10 22:26:33 2015 UTC,"The driving line is disabled at higher license levels. I know it's disabled in races at ""C"" class, but still enabled in practices. It's possible that it's also disabled in practices at higher license classes.  Unfortunately I don't think that rule is documented anywhere. The best way to test this theory is to try a practice session at another track in the same car. If the line isn't available there either then it's a license rule. If the line works somewhere else then it's probably a bug."
iRacing,325wb2,Fuzzwah,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:55:04 2015 UTC,"It isn't based on license level, but on the particular series.

iRacing,321j8f,JKraems,2,Fri Apr 10 15:03:45 2015 UTC,You can only get 0x-2x from hitting stationary objects. Also even if every time he hit the wall it was worth 2x it would only be 2x total since it only takes  the highest points from the same incident. For example you lose control (2x) hit someone hard (4x) and fly off track in the same incident. You're only slapped with the 4x for that.

The same colours apply, they are just greyed out (dimmed). So if you're going by the pits and you see a blue number that is greyed, that car is a lap down to you and they're in the pits.  ALSO, it's a bit different in multi-class racing where each class has a different background colour. So if you are in the Mustang, say, all the Mustangs may be on a yellow background."
iRacing,320daf,Sasken,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:12:39 2015 UTC,"And any other car considered in the ""same class"" would also have the same color. :)   Eg. If you did a multi-class race using the Indy Cars, NASCAR A class, NASCAR B class, and Trucks (which sounds fun now), each series would have a specific ""background"" color :)  So a Chevy and Toyota A class car, despite being separate cars, would have a specific color. The trucks would have a specific color. But within the same ""series', they'd have the same color.  Now, obviously some series involve multi-car races already, so those already exist in their own form as is. :)   Hope that answers a question or two."

iRacing,31ytll,sm2016,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:31:00 2015 UTC,Michigan is a good track too! I quite enjoyed it when I raced there the first time in Week 1. I quite like the high line there.  But I think tire degradation at Charlotte makes it more exciting than Michigan. I was lifting near the end to control the car and I think others just drove their cars too hard so I got some freebies.

iRacing,31ytll,MafjoM,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:37:51 2015 UTC,They basically turn themselves but the learning curve at Michigan isn't as bad as you'd think and the stock setup is great. The reason the draft balance is great is it gives you 2 mph in the straights but makes you 2 mph or so slower(or a lane up or two) in the turns so the time actually balances pretty good and makes it harder to lose the draft. That makes it more competitive than most drafting ovals while allowing for more passing and less follow the leader.   Plus it's fun to frequently be the only D class against a lot of As and still be relatively good.
iRacing,31ytll,MafjoM,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:43:15 2015 UTC,"In some other tracks on the DW12 oval series, aero push is terrible. But here? It manageable and racers can actually race instead of worrying about aero. :)"

Before you downvote me (har har, see what I did there?), hear me out...  By implementing a custom style to hide (not disable) downvoting, you only visually hide it from a subset of users of the subreddit. Anyone who wants to downvote a post can still easily do so by disabling custom styles or by using the front page aggregate of their subscriptions. If you are truly suspecting that there are butthurt users who are downvoting just to be dicks, these are the users who absolutely WILL NOT be stopped by such a change.  The users who WILL be stopped from downvoting by this change are most likely going to be the innocent well-meaning community members who are trying to downvote a post which legitimately deserves to be downvoted because it is spam, offensive, etc. Because of this, I see this as being a change for the worse and not for the better. The people you see as problems are the ones who will be the least impacted by it.  Personally, I always have subreddit custom styles disabled because I really dislike having every subreddit I use laid out totally differently and often very non-aesthetically."

Inflammatory posts, obvious trolls, or jerks just venting at another driver after a wreck are all the types of things that merit downvotes and, again, you have only taken the downvoting power away from the few people who would never use it maliciously anyway."

iRacing,31uu9y,AR-47,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:34:36 2015 UTC,Its been a few months since I have put any seat time in but  what I would recommend is start out slow and each lap push more as you gain confidence.  I gained the most time watching replays of the leaders in a race.  Look at your braking points and entry angles on replays and make corrections based on what you see.  Also looking at tire temps and wear are good indicators of over driving or under driving the car. If the tires are squeling in the corners than you are over driving.
iRacing,31uu9y,jsapp,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:44:09 2015 UTC,here is a helpful video for USA  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af0NYHtCvyI
iRacing,31uu9y,Rugby8724,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:20:45 2015 UTC,"I second what Xeno said. Also remember that slow/smooth is always faster than the opposite. Don't fall into the habit of flying super hot into the corners, braking hard, then trying to get back on the gas. You may feel like you're setting quick lap times because you're hitting the corners at a higher speed, but you're expending way too much energy at that point. What I've found increases my lap times is when you hit your braking point for the corner, roll off the throttle and gently roll onto the brakes as you turn into the corner. On tracks like USA you don't need to stay on the brakes long, so let off the brake and let the car coast for a moment (maybe applying 5%-10% throttle). Aim the nose of the car towards the apex while you're doing so. Once you feel the front of the car ""bite"", where you're confident giving it throttle won't cause too much understeer, go ahead and roll back on it as you come out of the corner.   Keep practicing this and it'll all eventually click. You'll have that one super fast lap where everything will make sense, then it's just a matter of fine tuning everything to fit your driving style. You'll learn to recognize the perfect angle of the nose in relation to the corner where you can hit the throttle hard and plant yourself on the way out. Hope that helped, and have fun!"
iRacing,31uu9y,modern_knight,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:04:46 2015 UTC,"I was also wondering about driving lines, do you go high or cut it as close to the apex as possible? How do you know?   On Thompson in particular the Stock seems to have a lot of oversteer on throttle."
iRacing,31uu9y,modern_knight,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on the track, I usually come in high, then get back on it as soon as I hit the apex. Look on the map of the track, watch replays, and you'll find where that apex is. Once you've got that, look for visual clues from the cockpit when you've hit that point.   As far as the oversteer, that's why you have to balance throttle and steering. 100% steering should have little to no throttle, and 100% throttle should have little to no steering. The tires can only provide so much grip. So when you're turning, you're asking your tires for lateral grip, therefore decreasing the amount of grip available for acceleration. All that to say, throttle should be gradually applied as you straighten the wheel. 100% turn == 0% throttle, 50%==50%, 0%=100%. I'm not sure if that's making sense haha, I'm terrible at explaining things."

iRacing,31w74d,Glockshna,3,Wed Apr 8 17:12:53 2015 UTC,I think the only point of iRacing on Steam is to try to attract new members (which from what I have heard is a complete failure).  Otherwise there's no point - just run it from the browser like you always have.

You then ""activate"" the game using that steam key in Steam's menu to ""Activate a CD-Key"" and allow steam to download the iRacing client. When signing into iRacing from Steam's ""Play"" button, it will take you to a place to login with your steam account. Then when you login, it should ask you for the Steam CD Key you got earlier, so use it again here (it's a double CD-Key Auth). Then you should be able to sign into iRacing using your steam account. :)  Do apologize, I would include the actual page they discuss this on the forum if It wasn't blocked at work."

iRacing,31vjji,mtojay,4,Wed Apr 8 14:21:20 2015 UTC,"Since I still happened to have the page open, here's the release notes:   Framerate Improvements    Improved shadow volume performance at night tracks, when driving near large  groups of cars, such as during starts and re-starts.  Dynamically reduce the level of detail of cars and pit related objects, when  driving near too many high detail objects, such as during starts and restarts.  Added some clamping to the level of detail for mirrors and cockpit camera to  prevent detail level from going too high when it shouldn't.  If both the virtual mirror and cockpit mirrors are enabled at the same time, the rear-view cockpit mirror is now lowered in priority to be after the side mirrors. Now you can say you want 1 cockpit mirror and the virtual mirror, and you get the driver side cockpit mirror and the virtual mirror, instead of the rear view mirror and the virtual mirror.    Screenshots    Fix the giant screen shot code so that it works again.    Fonts    Fixed the Charlie Brown font so it will now display properly.    BMW Z4 GT3    Fixed bug where final drive ratio was not transmitting to opponent cars properly, causing incorrect sounding opponent engine rpms.  Updated baseline setup.    Chevrolet Impala Old Class B    Updated darlington setup.    Ford GT    Maximum perch offset for both fronts set to be equal.

iRacing,31vjji,emersonlakeandlagoon,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:47:36 2015 UTC,I was two tenths up on my best lap time and one corner from the line when I got kicked off.  Only in a practice server thankfully.
iRacing,31vjdi,rusty_shackleford14,2,Wed Apr 8 14:20:11 2015 UTC,"As always, practice, so you can predict when your tires starting to go. Then see how much laps you can do driving your qualify marks and lines before your tires go, and compare it to a stint where you take a higher line, where you go off the throttle a bit earlier, where you go on the throttle a bit later, where you brake more smooth preventing locking up.  Sound is an excellent indicator, more squeaking = more tire degradation.   For example: In California I know I can make up time lost by not hugging the line in 3 and 4 at the end of a run. It'll give me two extra laps and much quicker laptimes then competitors who ran the inside for a long green run. And nothing beats the feeling of knowing you're so much faster than somebody who ruined his tires by hotlapping. If they try and stay with you they'll wreck.  But this depends of course on how the race is going, you'll be screwed if it's a wreckfest."

iRacing,31vjdi,Tex-Rob,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:05:49 2015 UTC,Understeer less.  Run 0.2 seconds slower at the start so you don't run 1 second slower at the end.
iRacing,31vjdi,Sasken,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"In fixed, it's not really about preserving your tires.  It's about lifting just the right amount once they are worn.  The tiniest of lifts will make the car turn, and your lap times will often be close to unaffected.  Also, try and keep clean air on the front of the car as much as possible.  If you are having to steer hard to keep your line in a draft, you're going to overheat/overwear your tires.  Even if the guy in front is 1 foot off the yellow line, that 1 foot of clean air on the front of your car will make a big difference, or you could go higher but the push can be worse up there, so you just have to adjust as needed."

iRacing,31qj00,ProdigyInventor,2,Tue Apr 7 11:51:24 2015 UTC,It's B class road licence but do lots of practice before actually racing. Also be prepared for carnage depending on your irating. GT3 series is awesome but notorious for lots of bad driving. It all depends on the split you get into in the end though!

iRacing,31qj00,BGaviator13,2,Wed Apr 8 11:39:49 2015 UTC,Basically yes. League racing is usually ran by well a league on  a hosted server and provides the most customization. Like last night in a V8 supercar league I participate in we had instead of a flat out 40 lap race two 20 lap sprint races. It was a lot of fun and usually people will try and race a lot more cleaner but can also race a lot more since the incident points dont count toward anything and are usually pretty high!

I subbed to iRacing back in 2009 but I didn't take it seriously until about 2011 where I worked my way up to the Indy Road series. Back then I didn't really care about iRating so I just raced for the fun but at the end of 2012 I pushed to the A F1 series and became one of the charter members of Friction Racing.  2013 S2 was a learning season and 2013 S3 I pushed for the pro series which I managed to sneak by and get. I was feeling pretty confident in myself when the 2013 Pro series started but I was in for a reality check as I failed to qualify for the first 4 rounds which automatically put me out of the running for the WC/Pro license and series since when I did make the grid, I was pretty much finishing dead last.    I took it as a learning experience even though it did hurt my pride to look so slow. S1 I took a break from F1 as my first child was born, so I drove the Mclaren in the GT3 series with setups supplied from the forum. I took it as a challenge to drive the Mclaren as the RUF had just come out and the MP4 was no-where near as quick.  S2 I got my Pro license back and in the 2014 Pro series I had a much better performance finishing 12th in the series and even managed a top 10 at VIR. Now I'm FINALLY in the World Championship series and I think it's going about as I would expect. Its another reality check qualifying 33rd, 35th and not making the grid (37th) for rounds 1,2, and 3 but it's great to know that when I do make the grid that I'm beating actually beating out other top sim racers in the world gunning to make those 35 grid slots.   For the future I plan on spending a lot of my free time looking at issues in my driving so I can get further up the grid but with a 2nd child on the way I may just let go of competitive racing and drive something a bit more fun even though wanting to drive with the best is a bit like a herion addiction to me. I could win any other race and it feels like nothing, but if I get a top 10 or top 15 in the Pro or WCS series, it's the best feeling in the world."

Now sitting at the lower end of division 1 with a rating of about 3700 so I guess it's gone pretty well.  When I feel like doing a race in a particular week I'll take a look at what car/track combo looks the most fun.

I didn't really care about irating until later on when I realized it was much harder to dodge all the wrecks in the lower splits.  I was down around 600 in both and now I'm 1400 in oval, 1000 in road.  Getting any higher is a struggle.  I've done very well in NiS open, just tweaking the trackbar to get it to feel right and then staying clear of everyone else.  Lately I've done well in Legends because setting up is pretty easy and then the same one works everywhere and there's hourly races.  Lost one by half a second last week.    Road racing is more frustrating.  A low-level series with open setup where I can get some good finishes really isn't there, and they don't have any participation in F1 or Indy, and I'm terrible at Blancpain / GT3.  I was five laps down at Sonoma in Blancpain and never spun out or crashed.   I mostly run Mazda rookie and that hurts my irating so I have to grind time trials to keep my A."

I also participate in the endurance races, usually with teams from r/iRacing or r/RiL.

iRacing,31oeh9,TheSturmovik,3,Wed Apr 8 05:28:35 2015 UTC,"I joined iRacing back in July 2014 (which was 2014 Season 2 Week 4). I've logged 243 hours of driving time in the sim.  I really didn't have any preconceived plans about where my ""career"" was heading. By 2014 Season 3 I'd progressed to C License and had got back up to around 1400 iRating (from a low of 600 during my ""newbing it up"" time).  2014 Seasons 3 and 4 I jumped between a heap of different cars, here's a count of races:    Series Races    Star Mazda 71   Mazda Cup 71   MX5 Advanced 39   Spec Racer Ford 31   Global Challenge 7   GT3 4   Skip Barber 3   Grand Touring 3   World Sports Car 2    By the end of 2014 I was promoted to B License.  When 2015 Season 1 started I decided that I would put some series focus into 3 series: Mazda Cup, MX5 Advanced and the Production Car Cup (driving the Solstice).  I was very proud of my results:    Series Finish Position # of Drviers    Mazda Cup 40 13787   MX5 Advanced 35 2276   Production Car 7 2290    2015 Season 1 began with me at an iRating of ~1500 and I finished at ~2700.  This season (2015 Season 2) I decided I wanted to learn some new cars, I selected the Mustang and the Ruf C-Spec. I'm focusing on being competitive in the Grand Touring series, and just being safe in the Ruf Cup. Currently I'm 6th over all in the GTC and leading Division 2. The Ruf I'm slowly getting faster in, running mid pack in the top split.  I've only dabbled a little on the Oval side. At first I didn't think I'd be interested at all, but I've enjoyed it enough to make my way to C License and bought a truck and some tracks to race with a few friends who are big time into it.  I've started tossing around ideas for next season. I've got zero interest in trying the F1 series yet, so I'm happy at B License. I'll probably continue driving the Ruf C-Spec because it has such a deep learning curve. At some point in my iRacing career I want to put real focus into the Skippy and also take the Star Mazda seriously.  On top of my iRacing driving time, I've also become so obsessed that I've put in a heap of time working on a few iRacing related applications. To feed my stats nerd requirements I've put together a python program which generates stats and graphs of everything iRacing reports on.

Jeez Fuzzwah, you make my new obsession with fiddling with GT3 setups seem like nothing XD. And very nice work with the finishing position. I really should focus on a series or two, but I feel like I wasted money on some tracks already (looking at you Bristol and Mosport!) so I want to at least practice on them a bit so I feel less guilty about wasting money on tracks I don't use.   RUF C-Spec is interesting for me because of the IMSA series, but I want to focus on the Sprint and Endurance Races (also planning to do a couple Road Warrior Races - planning to do the 6 Hours at the Glen race and my teammate and I are doing early setup work already, and maybe Spa 24 Hours if my teammate and I can get more members).   I'm not sure whether to venture in SM, because I'm crap in the Skippy. It's a love/hate car, and I hate it. I do eventually want to enter IndyCars on road and be competitive too."
iRacing,31oeh9,teh_cheat,2,Wed Apr 8 04:01:23 2015 UTC,"I started about a year ago, drove mx5 cup for a month then tried the SRF. I liked it a lot but didn't race much over the summer due to work.  This past fall when I went back to school I started racing again in the SRF. I drove the past 2 seasons in it + the current one. I've developed myself as a driver a lot in the past few seasons in the car, both in the official series and the fantastic iGPfun league which mirrors the SRF schedule with longer races once a week. This past season I managed 5th in the official series and I was lucky enough to win the iGP league.  This season I'm running the SRF again, but am also trying to fit in a full season of the Lotus 79 since it fits my summer schedule better. I'm going to try to win the official SRF series this time around, it seems slightly less competitive this season so I might as well go for it. I'm hoping for another good season in the league and to progress as best I can as a L79 driver.  I run oval on the side when I've got the tracks, mostly the trucks. I don't take my oval career super seriously so it is a nice break from the tenseness road racing brings me every once in a while.  My long term goals are to eventually win or get podiums in the cars that interest me. I initially aspired to drive GT3 but drove the cars and decided I'm not too keen on them. I like the cars that are more rewarding to drive (this is all opinion, don't be offended) for me like the SRF, L(4/7)9, C-Spec, Radical and V8SC to name a few. I'm thinking about taking a shot at F1 when the new car comes out, since we will all be on a closer to level playing field. I just ran my first endurance race at Sebring and it was a lot of fun, I would definitely like to keep doing endurance racing. I also have run in the RiL for most of the past year as time has allowed."

I picked up a few wins in legends and quickly earned my class D and class C. I skipped all of the class D series entirely and went straight to the trucks when I was not really ready and caused a lot of accidents and had many internet connection issues. In my first full season I picked up some wins but finished outside of the top 50 in division 3 points. I also dabbled with road at that time and earned my class C license in road. I decided I probably wasn't going to win a championship so I decided I'd just race what I wanted to race and not worry about the numbers.   Eventually I earned a class A license in both oval and road and just had fun driving a bunch of different cars for a couple of years. I tried the Skippy, IndyCar, DP, Mustang, McLaren, late models, Nationwide cars, and others. I earned a 4000 iRating on both oval and road but I was becoming bored of racing for racing's sake. So I decided to run a full season again for the first time in a couple of years in the Mustang Challenge. I finished 7th overall and won the club championship, which was my best ever result in points. I had been running a lot of road at that time but I've always leaned more towards oval racing and wanted to run a full season there.   So I ran the first ever NiS open series last year with the intention of focusing on racing only the Gen 6 car to earn a pro license...I finished 62nd overall in points, so needless to say I fell well short of that goal! I did, however, take away many ideas about how to race for points and the differences between racing to win individual races and racing to win championships. This year, I switched to the NiS fixed, running 2-3 races a week and pretty much sticking to just that series, but I'm putting the ideas I learned about racing for championships to good use and I currently have a 5500+ iRating and I'm sitting 3rd overall in the NiS fixed points!

A couple of time trials in the skip at Barber and one race just driving behind I got it.  Spent most of season 1of 2015 running all the practices I had time for in the FW-31. Once I had the idea I was up to speed I started racing and that's where I'm at right now. :)  I probably ended up doing the opposite of what most would do which was to focus on safety rating so as not to lose any licences, as I quite like having the option of running everything road side apart from the pro series ;). Unfortunately my irating has suffered somewhat because of it with it usually hovering between 1650 and 2k.  That said I've no regrets as it's landed me in the lower grand prix splits, which is where you might want to end up if you like being competitive and are still getting somewhat used to driving that beast. Winning my first race in my second week of participation was also quite nice. (and by quite nice I mean: HOLY CRAP I DONE DID IT!)"

So i decided to put that on hold and start driving road series. I started in the Blancpain/GT3 and quickly moved to IMSA/WSCS as I was looking for a mixed class experience.  This is where I really found my niche. I tried out a couple of the cars, and settled in on the Ford GT as it fit my driving quite well, wasn't too fast, wasn't too squirrelly in the rear end, it was nice.  Currently I am now second in my division (division 6, so not that great, but it feels good as I am a fairly new iRacer)for the Ford.  TLDR My career path SS>Trucks>B Class>GT3>IMSA Ford GT"

iRacing,31oeh9,Vulfilla,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:10:54 2015 UTC,"Started up my subscription June of 2014 with the sole purpose of running the oval indycar series. Started out in the street stocks and when I got my D license moved on to the sk modified series for a season. The sk's were a good stepping stone to learn basic setups, imo. At that point it didn't take long for me to get to C license and race the indycar fixed series. Started slow in the indycar series, only purchasing a few tracks initially as I purchased all the tracks needed to run a full season in the sk mods just a few weeks before. The next season I started running full-time in the dw12 and saw my license move to A class in no time. Dabble in the open series from time to time until recently as I now look forward to the open races more than the fixed. Tried my hand in the trucks and nationwide series but was never as competitive as I was in the indycar. I still jump in a race every once in a while on the nascar side but with my irating where it's currently at, over 3k, I am just a backmarker because I don't put in the practice time that the regulars do with those cars.   I recently went back and started working on my road license, and found that I was much faster than when I started playing and moved to a D license very quickly. Then started racing the caddy and after learning that car moved to the star Mazda series and indy road fixed when I got my C license, which is where I am currently at. I'm enjoying the road side of things a lot and I'm a little upset that I didn't work on it sooner, but either way I'm moving on up that license ladder and should be at B class by the end of the month if not sooner. Either way I'm having a lot of fun right now! Personally I think knowing what I wanted to run from the start really helped me progress fast. And taking it step by step really helped me understand the feel of iracing as well. I'm currently holding a +4.0 Sr and 3k+ Irating on the oval side and a 3.5sr/1500+irating on the road side. Hopefully I can get a few 0x races in the next few days and run a few indy open road races as they are at Watkins Glenn this week and it's one of my favorite courses to run at."

iRacing,31p9rx,O_Solid,13,Tue Apr 7 02:11:08 2015 UTC,"Are you ready for a mother fucking crash course on sports cars? Because you are about to get a crash course on sports cars.   SO:  Not all sports cars, and not all sports car series are created equal. Currently, there are probably 12 or so major series that run Sports cars/GT cars.   Lets start with GT3. GT3 is a category that started in the last 10 years or so and was meant to be a place for privateers to race. The cars were intended to be around cup car speeds. In recent years, manufacturers have become hugely interested in GT3 and the cars have gotten faster and faster, mostly through aerodynamics. The major players in GT3 today are Mercedes, Audi, McLaren, BMW, Nissan, Porsche, Aston Martin, Ferrari and probably a couple more I have forgotten. Within the ""Blancpain"" series on iracing, these are GT3 cars. They HEAVILY resemble IMSA/WEC GT cars but the giveaway is that GT3 cars will have larger rear wings and will have more bits on the front of the car for aerodynamics. Many of these cars are bought and raced, rather then being supported directly from the factory.   Now for Tudor. TUDOR is a combination of the previously existing Grand am Series and the American Le Mans series. Within tudor there are 4 main categories. Prototype, Prototype challenge, GTLM, and GTD. Since were focusing on GT cars here, we will hone in on GTLM and GTD. GTLM stands for Grand Touring Le Mans. These cars are built to FIA WEC GT spec, meaning they can currently, if invited, run in the Le Mans 24 hour. The iRacing.com GTLM counterpart is the Ford GT GT2 (The one with the smaller wing and smaller rear defuser). If you ever hear it referenced, GT2, GTE, and GTLM all encompass different rule sets. Even though a BMW Z4 races in the IMSA series, it is not built to GT3 spec. It is a GTLM spec car. For all intents and purposes, almost every GTLM car in existence is heavily Factory supported. NOTE: In the united states there is the ""Yokohama GT3 series"". These are NOT the same spec cars. The yokohama series runs just Porsche 997 GT3 CUP cars. This gets confusing because porsche gives a few of their cars a ""GT3"" designation.   GTD is a category carried over from Grand Am and stands for ""Grand touring Daytona"". These cars are usually tube framed and have less aero, are heavier, have less tire, and are more restricted than GTLM. the iRacing counterpart is the C-Spec which ALSO represents a Porsche Supercup car.   If there is interest, I will create a video explaining all the nuances between the different categories of GT racing, how the cars differ, and the history behind them."
iRacing,31p9rx,Chenstrap,7,Tue Apr 7 08:52:08 2015 UTC,"Id be extremely interested in a video on the subject. It all gets a bit confusing, but your write-up cleared a lot of stuff up for me."
iRacing,31p9rx,InZomnia365,1 point,Tue Apr 7 11:33:16 2015 UTC,"Chen,  Thanks for the explanation!  Ok, this is a bit more complicated than I thought, see if I get this straight:  IMSA has 4 Categories:   Prototype (Riley Mk XXVI, HPD) Prototype Challenge (Oreca FLM09super1) GT Le Mans (Z4 GTEs1, 911 RSR(?), Ferrari 458 GT21, Vantage GTE1, Viper GTS-R1) GT Daytona (911 GT3, Audi R8 LMS1, Ferrari 458 GT31, Vantage GT32, Z4 GT3)  1= Not Present in iRacing 2 = Annouced for Future Release   (this was obtained from the 2015 TUDOR Wiki Article) wiki  Technically, the GT3 cars would compete in the GT Daytona Class, right? I understand that the GTLM is a whole different thing, but GTD should be GT3 equivalent.  So again, why there are not BMWs present in the GTD?"
iRacing,31p9rx,Bakkster,2,Tue Apr 7 17:34:01 2015 UTC,"Neither the Riley nor the HPD are current specifications. LMP2s like the HPD changed regulations a few years after the one we have to slow them down and make them a cheaper class for gentlemen drivers (aka, not professionals). DPs, on the other hand, needed to get sped up with Grand-Am and ALMS merged, so they have a lot more carbon fiber, better brakes and transmissions, and most importantly a better wing, dive planes, and a huge diffuser adding together to add a lot of downforce. The LMP2s also get a bit more HP and weight to balance the cars together so they race well against each other.  The Ford GT we have is a GT2 car, which became GTE (called GTLM in the states), but wouldn't be legal now either.  GTD aren't completely GT3 cars at the moment, but most are modified from GT3s. Take a GT3 car, put in a spec ECU and bolt on the spec splitter, wing, and diffuser (sound familiar?). The Porsche is the exception, it's more like an upgraded Porsche Cup car (like our C-Spec). That's why the C-Spec is in the series right now instead of the BMW (which also has its own GT3 series to race).  Adding to the confusion, all of these classes are changing in the near future.   LMP2 will be getting new regulations in 2017, and IMSA will replace the Prototype class with just these cars (no more balancing DP and P2). LMP3 is a new class in Europe like the Prototype Challenge cars that never caught on over there. LMPC is confirmed through next season, but may be replaced with either LMP3 or using the same LMP2 cars as Prototype (the only difference being that they will have a non-professional driver). GTLM uses the GTE class regulations, which are being updated for next year (more power and new chassis rules). GTD next year will be fully GT3 cars. No more spec components, just extra weight and less HP so they're slower than the GTLMs.   So, long story short, sports car regulations (aside from GT3) change a lot, and that's part of why it's confusing to understand and unlikely we'll get a fully current IMSA set of cars. We can probably get pretty close, though, with a recent GTE car and Prototype."
iRacing,31p9rx,Chenstrap,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:36:14 2015 UTC,They can but they require heavy modifications. Next year the rules are changing though for GTD
iRacing,31p9rx,Bakkster,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:35:57 2015 UTC,"GTD is a category carried over from Grand Am and stands for ""Grand touring Daytona"". These cars are usually tube framed and have less aero, are heavier, have less tire, and are more restricted than GTLM. the iRacing counterpart is the C-Spec which ALSO represents a Porsche Supercup car.    All of the GTD cars except the Porsche are GT3s with spec bits tacked on. None of them are purely tube-frame silhouettes (the Camaros went to CTSCC, and the Mazdas were at the Bathurst 12 hours). The Porsche is the closest to the old spec, but it's still a GT3 Cup car with an updated engine like the Grand-Am days.  More importantly, in 2016 all GTD cars will be fully GT3-spec. Only changes will be additional weight and less power (same as they do in ELMS for their GTC class)."
iRacing,31p9rx,Chenstrap,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:20:45 2015 UTC,I think current gt3 cars needed too be more heavily modified before running in gtd (that is why Mclaren opted out of a GA kit for example).
iRacing,31p9rx,Bakkster,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:31:42 2015 UTC,"Aero and ECU were the only changes, but they're not simple enough to be easy. The old GAGT cars did need more modification, mostly with thicker roll cages."

iRacing,31p2or,mav3r1ck92691,2,Tue Apr 7 01:09:03 2015 UTC,"I run in the bottom split (iRating 1450) and this is my first season in the F1, my fastest lap so far after a day of practice at Spa is a 1.47:700. The fastest guys in the bottom split will be around that time too. The top guys are doing low 1.45's high 1.44's.  If you still finish ahead of your ranking you can still gain iR and SR, some division championship points. Just make sure you keep an eye on your relative blackbox and if you get blue flagged, stick to the outside around corners if you really have no choice (do not start going slowly in a braking zone, the faster guys will brake far later than you would think) but preferably let them by down any straight, you may lose some time but if you're really concerned about wrecking a race you will feel much better about it.  Driving the F1 takes a lot of patience and practice. Learning how hard and late you can brake before locking up, and getting the power down without spinning. For Watkins I must have done over 300 practice laps, just keep pushing hard and I'm sure you will get your laptime down :)"

It's got some tough corners, and a little bit of everything, sweeping esses a long straight, a chicane, elevation changes, and flat 90 degree turns. It's fast enough that you feel like your really doing it too. Plus it's rewarding, and hosted sessions of that combo are relatively easy to find, meaning you can learn the flow of the race and how to allow people to pass without ruining someone's SR."

iRacing,31nch0,keem85,8,Mon Apr 6 17:24:57 2015 UTC,"A total of 0.70 SR lost this week, and mostly because of others wrecking me.. I have now a total of 3.10SR and that is too low for me to dare go in to an official race right now.. I feel like I need at least 3.50   A few things:   There isn't anything wrong with carrying a SR below 3.5.  A 1.0+ and you keep your license and can continue to race in w/e series it unlocks.  And since we're early in the season, you have plenty of time to recover if you SR dips below 2.0 and aren't in danger of being demoted as if the season were coming to a close. I'd suggest altering your frame of reference from your recent string of bad luck to your overall driving performance.  You earned your current license.  You could continue to earn and wear that license or even improve it.  But that doesn't mean you can't also earn a demotion.  If you are truly worthy of a license, you have considerably more than 0.70 SR to spare, especially the longer you race (i.e. if you're good enough to be averaging ~4x per race, then your string of bad luck will look more and more like an anomaly the more you race). I suggest that the only way anyone's license means anything, is if it accurately represents the thing it is attempting to quantify (which is the driver's safety).  So just race.  Hard.  Race within your abilities.  Take the amount of risks you deem acceptable for someone at your perceived skill level.  And let your SR tell you whether or not your opinion of yourself is accurate.  Then adjust your driving style if necessary. This is assuming these incidents were completely unavoidable.  If they or even some were avoidable, you need to figure out why, and how to remedy whatever deficiency involved you."

The other ones like Lotus 79 are empty and I guess it's not for me.. One more failed race and I'm down to a C licence again.. I don't think racing skippy will increase my SR when I have a B licence?

iRacing,31nch0,DwnTwnLestrBrwn,3,Mon Apr 6 18:32:47 2015 UTC,"Once you get in the a-class it will get harder if you can't avoid the wrecks, you'll lose SR like there is no tomorrow, but it's also easier to get it back when you have a couple of clean races, because you run more laps. Being cautious and being aware of what's moving ahead and behind you is the most important thing.   Qualifying can have the disadvantage of having faster cars behind you of people who didn't qualify, if you've practiced enough you'll know the point on the track where you can pull to the side safely. There is no point in battling with faster cars behind you because you'll be the one making the mistakes, they're faster because they know the safest lines."
iRacing,31nch0,jjhassert,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:38:22 2015 UTC,I think having faster cars behind you is safer than slower cars ahead of you because for the most part you're more in control of how you get passed than how you pass someone else.  Fair trade IMO.

Im usually a second or two off the ultimate pace in my division, but Im apparently really good at wreck avoidance (/r/humblebrag...) which lets me finish around  the top 10 usually, when starting atleast 15 and back.  At this point, I have absolutely no chance at winning in the GT3 races at my 2300 iRating. Sometimes, Im quick enough for a top 5 finish, but then theres a low SOF in a non-split race with a couple  4000+ iRating guys leading by  half a lap.  At Sebring, I  was serviceable for a 2:01 and a few 2:00 laps, with a similar case at Suzuka. After analyzing my avg laptimes in the Sebring 12hr at a 1800 SOF, I was one of the quickest GT cars,  and the few people faster than me were higher rated anyway... So apparently, I wouldve been  really competitive in the split below the ones I usually get placed in, while having virtually no chance to win in thr split Im in. At this point, I go into a race looking to have a ""good, clean race"" and not caring  about position, since its next to a non-factor for my results, unless I crash.  TL;DR - I rarely used to win races because I was too slower than my potential. Now, Ive pretty much reached my peak for my time invested, and I still cant win because Im racing versus people quicker than me  :P Im not blaming the system, its just a bit dissuading."
iRacing,31m27a,InZomnia365,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:03:04 2015 UTC,"Definately there is a lot to gain/learn from being in a higher split with faster guys and I do get the odd podium by staying out of trouble and picking up the ""freebies"", often why my IR takes a leap upward yet again!  Trouble is that's no substitute for the feeling you get when your ""mastery"" behind the wheel ""earned""  that podium by simply being ""better"" or faster than the guys behind you.....  Funnily enough I think this has seemed more apparent as I have gone back to do some mx5 cup stuff recently and I guess some people just do that all of the time, they really do become masters of that car. In advanced Mazda I faired a lot better, which surprised me."
iRacing,31m27a,schtick01101,2,Mon Apr 6 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"I used to be like you. I used to think that winning was the best thing in the world. Recently I've started to take a liking to a well fought 10th place finish instead of a 10 second lead win.  I've always subscribed to the thought that you are only as good as your competition. Grind it out for a few months and you'll find yourself slowly creeping up and gaining speed on the track.  Better does not always equal faster, just means you were able to drive on your edge for the duration of the race. Don't look at the wreck ""freebies"" as a bad thing. You were the better driver against the person who wrecked because after all you are still pointing forward, the only direction that matters."

iRacing,31ncja,arsenicfox,7,Mon Apr 6 17:25:20 2015 UTC,"Well, to be a nicer version of the jerkoffs below, I wouldn't recommend it.   It's just a small axis to be able to fill a LOT of room. Some cars have 900 degrees of steering, and some courses work better on varying degrees of turning, and you're trying to fit that into 50 degrees.  It's doable. I just don't imagine it being much fun, and probably lacking in the immersion.  Could also be a reason a lot of people think that it's ""IceRacing"" sigh  (This is why some people are upset, because people using controllers complain about the physics. Heck, the FFB for wheels is sometimes more advanced than wheels like the g27, which isn't nearly as strong as other wheels like the Clubsport or Accuforce.)  So, sorry everyone else is treating you like crap. I personally wouldn't recommend it. I commend you for doing well with it though. That takes skill. :)"
iRacing,31ncja,Hugo_5t1gl1tz,2,Mon Apr 6 19:17:28 2015 UTC,"lol, no doubt - its ok everyone has their opinion and i get it.  a wheel is just a superior input.  completely agree about the small axis and if you know of any good ways to tweak with that sensitivity that would be helpful.  i'll make sure to pass it along when other people inevitably ask :-)  i was actually pretty impressed with the physics even on the controller though!  did know i was getting a wheel day 1 though, this is definitely the best competitive racing game out there.  surprised there is so little information available for additional configuration on the controllers though.  it could be because the game itself has mainly been targetted towards the sim audience and just released to steam.  probably will change in a year as more players come in.  ive done some limited reading and it seems like the G27 is the way to go but if you have any other recommendations in the $500-$1000 range that includes pedals and a wheel stand, please let me know!  thanks again"

iRacing,31ncja,Sasken,15,Mon Apr 6 19:52:18 2015 UTC,"I really wish iRacing would at least make an attempt to ban controllers. A wheel/pedal setup should be required at the absolute minimum, IMHO."
iRacing,31ncja,arsenicfox,3,Mon Apr 6 18:04:34 2015 UTC,"iRacing staff have addressed that question in the forums. According to them, they have no reliable way to differentiate between an XBox-style controller and a wheel. To the software, they are all just controllers.  The only way they could restrict it to ""wheels only"" would be to hard-code the allowed controller names into a list. And as soon as a new wheel came out, that wheel wouldn't work until they updated the code."
iRacing,31ncja,Sasken,3,Mon Apr 6 18:30:33 2015 UTC,"On top of that, some devices use generic game device profiles: EG Fanatec CSR Elites are a 4-axis pedal system. >_> Don't know why."

We could not restrict the controllers even if we wanted to (unless we said only Logitech g27 wheels or a specific list of compatible hardware), but there is no need to do that anyway.   ""but there is no need to do that anyway.""

iRacing,31ncja,LewisKiniski,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"there is nothing unsubstantiated about people having to spend an extra $100 (which u linked to a used, possibly beat up wheel) to more like $250 for a new G27 to 'try' a game they may not stick with.  and that doesnt even include the $$ you need to spend to buy additional iRacing tracks etc.  the best way to get more people interested in games is lower the barrier to entry.  they could absolutely disable controllers but it would be anything but in their best interest which is why they support them.  i agree that if youre older and employed looking at it like a hobby its not a big investment.  not everyone can just go drop that kind of cash to try it the 'right' way."
iRacing,31ncja,Indestructavincible,2,Mon Apr 6 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"I don't want to lower the barrier to entry.  I want people in here that are old enough to have a credit card, or serious enough to warrant use of their parents' credit card.

iRacing,31ncja,my_dick_said_this,0,Mon Apr 6 20:10:13 2015 UTC,"yeah understandable but at the end of the day we're talking about a for-profit company and even though you personally may not want that, the company and their partners want that.  doesnt matter who's credit card it is.  they need to keep that low barrier to grow their subscriber base so they can continue to run and improve the game.  it also opens up new avenues / channels for them and makes high iRating even that much more exclusive and coveted.  the more players you have the more people you will have that want to watch it on services like twitch.  the biggest iRacing stream has only a few hundred viewers where if you had many many more players, top iRating / pro NASCAR drivers in live races they could see many thousands  of viewers down the road.  there are good and bad things to bringing in new players but the good outweighs the bad IMHO.  suffering through lower ranking, accident prone, players would probably be the worst of it.  *also - there is no age limit on dickheads ;-)"
iRacing,31ncja,LewisKiniski,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:58:24 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want to meet you on the road if you're playing with an xbox controller.

iRacing,31ncja,LewisKiniski,-5,Mon Apr 6 19:10:46 2015 UTC,ehhh - i know what youre saying but the safety rating handles people that would otherwise make controllers less fun for people using wheels.  im definitely not recommending controllers but its a good gateway into playing the game and am sure there are people out there that have gone pretty far with controllers before opting to make the jump to a wheel
iRacing,31ncja,LewisKiniski,6,Mon Apr 6 18:21:20 2015 UTC,"Seems to me we have the racing version of the classic FPS ""laser vs optical mouse"" argument here. The fact of the matter is that yes, you can learn to be decent/good using a controller, just the same that you can learn to be good with a (bad) laser mouse. However, if you are looking to take a game seriously and get seriously good at it, then you will need to upgrade and make an investment into a wheel and pedal setup, just the same way that to get seriously good in a FPS you need to make the investment into a mouse with a perfect (usually optical) sensor.   The difference I see, is that most FPS games can be played either casually or seriously, while iRacing (from what I gather) is meant to be taken seriously all the time, especially when racing online against others."
iRacing,31ncja,LewisKiniski,4,Mon Apr 6 19:41:57 2015 UTC,"way back in the day it was the classic FPS keyboard vs mouse argument.  if you didn't switch from keyboard only (doom / duke nukem players) to mouse, you got smoked.  or more modern in FPS is the mouse vs controller.  mouse players just crush console controller players because its a superior input.  im not advocating for the controller, at all, but definitely thought there might be more support in terms of configuring it.    i paused playing last week specifically because i dont want to go too far practicing with that input method when i know how much of a difference a wheel will make.  still doesnt mean its not possible (and supported by iRacing) to go pretty far using a controller ;-)"
iRacing,31ncja,LewisKiniski,3,Mon Apr 6 19:51:42 2015 UTC,"I've done a fair share of driving with a 360 controller in NR2003 and other offline titles while on the go (ex: laptop in an airport). Driving that way is so much less accurate, slower, and inconsistent. If you've never had a wheel you might not know what I'm talking about- but once you get the wheel you'll never want to go back. And to get the proper simulation experience, you'll need some form of FFB wheel and at least two pedals. So, if you're any serious about simracing, get a wheel and have fun!"
iRacing,31ncja,mav3r1ck92691,3,Mon Apr 6 19:33:51 2015 UTC,"nice - thanks.    completely agree, i see my wheels slip / turn too far b/c of the sensitivity and know i lost .1-2 seconds which is HUGE in this game.  was planning on that G27 with pedals since people say thats the best bang for the buck and probably will get the wheel stand with it.  did you ever get into configuring the controller further?  is there a way to lower that sensitivity or even have a button you could use on the controller to swap between sensitivity levels or didnt you ever get into it that much?"
iRacing,31ncja,Eburon,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:53:54 2015 UTC,"Now that you say it, especially with NR2003, I fiddled with the sensitivity a lot. There is a steering assist that you can turn on, and no matter what I did, I always had to make some sort of sacrifice. On the restrictor super speedways, I turned the sensitivity way down and the assist up, which gave me alright control over smooth movements, but I had no way of countersteering. For other tracks it was the other way: I was slow but could save myself from slides. I don't say this just to discourage from controllers, because they are great for on the go. But if you want a somewhat serious simulation experience, you'll need a wheel. G27 is plenty fine, I'm D class oval and A class roadside. I'd say it's also the best bang for the buck too."
iRacing,31ncja,LewisKiniski,2,Mon Apr 6 20:10:21 2015 UTC,"yeah nice G27 was what I was leaning towards, seems the agreed upon 'starter' wheel.    your summary is what my worry was.  if you set sensitivity too low you'll be able to take the turns with less of that wheel skid but wont be able to countersteer.  did you like that lower better or did you need to keep it higher 'just in case'?  i think best case with the controller would be if you could set a button to toggle your sensitivity so you could keep it in a lower setting and if trouble starts you could toggle back so you could countersteer.    i dont really think there is a happy medium with a controller because the play is just so small compared to a wheel.  someone else in the thread pointed out how many touch points you miss using a controller vs a wheel and its not even a question how much of a benefit a wheel would make.  you'll just never be able to compete as easily (or fun) without one."
iRacing,31ncja,Eburon,3,Mon Apr 6 20:48:12 2015 UTC,"Well, as you've undoubtedly gathered by now, there are people that hate that controllers are used in iRacing. As /u/dahazeyniinja said, it can be done, but it's easier and more fun with a wheel. I've met several people who were fast, clean, and smooth with a controller, though granted it is most likely easier on road courses than oval.  There is a setup trick for a controller that makes it easier to control, or so I'm told:   It is frustrating till you know the trick.   First, you have to move the sticks/triggers really slowly or we can not detect them. Count to 5 while moving the axis (when asked to fully depress the throttle or turn the wheel all the way left/right).   And second, there is a secret calibration mode just for joysticks. When asked to turn your wheel 90 deg to the left, push the stick all the way to the left, hold it there and hit ok. You will then be prompted to turn the wheel 30 deg to the left. Again push it all the way to the left, hold it and hit ok. That will map your controller to 60 deg and make everything much less sensitive. You can change that number at any time by opening the settings tab in the sim and adjusting the top slider (wheel angle). So if you find this is too sensitive or not enough, you can tweak it a bit.   The dead zone is annoying, but you don't really want one. The real issue is that the centering spring on the controller is too floppy. But with the sensitivity set right you don't notice it that much.    That's from the horse's mouth, so to speak."
iRacing,31ncja,LewisKiniski,3,Mon Apr 6 20:24:51 2015 UTC,"great response, thanks  good trick - definitely will try that.  still looking for any other information on adjusting sensitivity or was thinking there may be a trick to set a hotkey on the controller to, on the fly, toggle or adjust sensitivity for cornering etc.  easier on road courses huh?  i just havent spent enough time on road in general b/c i enjoy oval.  i had a much easier time with oval with the biggest downfall being the slight tire skip you get with over-steer due to sensitivity costing me tenths of a second that adds up each lap and matters.    thanks again for the tip"
iRacing,31ncja,mav3r1ck92691,3,Mon Apr 6 20:43:15 2015 UTC,Game:  try to win a race. Sim:  simulate driving a race.   iRacing is a sim.  It requires significantly more control/finesse than a controller can provide you.
iRacing,31ncja,mav3r1ck92691,-5,Mon Apr 6 17:35:03 2015 UTC,definitely to be competitive.  ive made it to D and know i can go much further doing ovals but its just not as fun or easy as it could be using a wheel i think.
iRacing,31ncja,Eburon,2,Mon Apr 6 17:48:34 2015 UTC,"A controller won't suffice, not for you but especially not for the ones around you, because you will have unpredictable behavior on the track."
iRacing,31ncja,SirBensalot,-5,Mon Apr 6 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"i know im good enough for ovals, already went to D, but also know its gotta be night and day in difficultly level and will just never get the precision needed to shave the extra half second to compete in the trials to get pole positions.  the tires definitely squeal a bit at times in turns and you lose time with that"
iRacing,31ncja,mav3r1ck92691,8,Mon Apr 6 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"You think you're good enough for ovals, but you are not. I'm sorry but people can't race anywhere near you. You can't bumpdraft with somebody using a controller and you can't go two wide because you will be unable to hold the inside or the outside consistently.   On the roadside you might get away with a controller regarding safety, but you'll be slow."
iRacing,31ncja,Xenocerebral,2,Mon Apr 6 18:01:59 2015 UTC,"I think Trucks @ Atlanta.  You need to constantly be making little adjustments throughout Turn 2, from about midway all the way to the backstretch to carry any sort of speed off the corner.  The resolution of a 360 controller's inputs is entirely too big (educated guess) to be making these kinds of adjustments.  And even if it isn't, you'd probably have to be like a surgeon to make use of it."
iRacing,31ncja,TML_Skidd,2,Mon Apr 6 18:10:01 2015 UTC,"yes, that is my main problem with the controller.  you literally have to build muscles in your hands you didnt know you had to make those micro adjustments.  its not fun and not as effective as a wheel but it can be done."
iRacing,31ncja,mav3r1ck92691,-3,Mon Apr 6 19:20:13 2015 UTC,"you think you know anything about me or racing with a controller, but you dont.  i'm sorry but you're basically saying 'its not possible' and youre wrong.  i draft all race and go 3 wide all day.  the issue is that i lose about .25-.5 off of guys like Donovan Johnson who get to start pole every race because they dont make tiny abrupt movements from the super small window you have on a controller vs a wheel.  i never roadside - ive raced every race and started from the line every race and made it to D the first few days playing because I practiced the shit out of the controller to make sure I can hold a line.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q2CtKl0aD4  the issue is that i'm fairly positive i would have a much more difficult (and less fun) time trying to perfect it vs getting a wheel.  also wondering if anyone knows config options to lessen the wheel jerk to compensate for the tiny action on the pad."
iRacing,31ncja,XxHaagxX,3,Mon Apr 6 18:12:24 2015 UTC,"Irrelevant to the topic but the driving in this video is an example of extremely poor racecraft.  There is some reasonable car control but entirely too much speed.  Accident avoidance here is primarily luck.  Back on topic - when you're using a controller, you aren't capable of the full range of inputs everyone else is.  The faster vehicles require you make full use of the inputs available to you, and drivers around you will have expectations about your car placement and potential for irregularity in the way you move.  Through no fault of your own, you may just encounter a situation a controller cannot get you out of, and no demonstration of your joystick prowess can/will rule that out.  You are simply doing yourself and others you may affect a disservice if you get yourself into this kind of situation.  I believe this is what /u/Eubron is saying, albeit in a more brief, generalized tone (definitely not meant to be taken absolutely literally)."
iRacing,31ncja,ham236,-1,Mon Apr 6 18:25:44 2015 UTC,"completely agree with the speed thing.  pretty sure i was (and still do) hear this scene in my head every time i see this happening at the ranks i'm playing at lol:  https://youtu.be/e77ybggTHHg?t=86  but speed is one of those rules you just learn through safety rating or someone tells you and i took this video with only a few days playing and before learning that lesson.  that said i wouldnt call all the accident avoidance in this one primarily luck...  im not in the faster vehicles yet and thats kinda the point of this thread.  i still entirely believe others have used controllers and i could continue on very far in both safety and iRating but at what cost?  the controller presents a much higher difficulty and is super high stress with the low window for error.    to say it cant be done though is just defeatism.  its how far someone would be wiling to take it and how fun it would be.  i spent one week or 10 days racing, if i spent another 6 months driving with the controller where does that get me?  really insanely good at driving with a controller which will never make me as good as I could be (or others are) with a wheel.  YOU CAN DRIVE THROUGH IT"
iRacing,31ncja,Maxpayne198717,2,Mon Apr 6 18:39:29 2015 UTC,"to say it cant be done though is just defeatism.   It doesn't matter if it can or can't be done.

I'm not even really sure which side you're leaning towards, but long story short - I suggest you get the wheel sooner rather than later.  And it's not personal - any time anyone posts a controller question - they always get this type of response, and more often than not they fight it and get downvoted into oblivion.  Why?  Because the point of a question is to obtain an answer, and the answer here is and has always been damn-near unanimous as anti-controller.  After you get your wheel, I'll expect you to be in the next one of these threads trying to help the OP see the light."

It is best to start out though picking a direction you want to go. So say oval or road then pick a series you want to work for. That way as you buy more cars or tracks you aren't so lost that you can only do one race in each series. (Not always a bad thing if you want to change things up).  Also if you do I believe there is a promotional code going on right now for the IMSA series.   Edit: http://www.imsa.com/articles/imsa-iracingcom-announce-new-online-sportscar-championship"

It is much more difficult the be competitive in iRacing because you will be racing against other people.   The biggest downside for me is the fact that you have to invest so much time to be a halfway decent racer. There are weeks that pass by where I only run in practice sessions because I didn't have enough time to get up to proper speed and run a race.  iRacing is great, but be prepared to spend a lot of time learning tracks, building set-ups and learn proper race craft."

As the other posts mention iRacing gives you the cleanest and most competitive online racing of any racing sim.

Remember it's not like ""hey we are on iRacing and whats these other games everyone is on about"".  We already tried them all and will try anything that comes along.  But iRacing is where all the time is consumed for sim racers.  Cause iRacing attracts the top sim racers and real life pros.   Cause iRacing is the only place you can get consistent clean respectful racing.   Cause iRacing has 40% retention rate of customers after all these years.  Any other service or game could only dream to have so many happy customers.   Cause everything is scratch built.  pCars is just a bunch of parameters, how else can they have so many cars. iRacing will fly a group out, laser scan the car, take 10,000 photos, recored sounds, model individual braking systems, components and stuff.  Thats why you can feel a huge difference between cars.  iRacing is here for the long haul.  Apart from AC every other driving game is like a Mario Kart compared to iRacing.  Hyper realistic and very unforgiving."

Are they braking later, or not braking but lifting off earlier? Are they taking a tighter entry, or compromising the exit more. That sort of thing. Then I try to emulate their line and see if it helps me. Sometimes I go back and compare with a different driver, because people have different styles, despite being the same speed, and I might find one person easier to learn from."

Slightly higher shift points in lower gears, slightly lower in higher gears.  WRT this car- All the elevation change may be throwing you off this week. The car is unsettled easily and you need to keep it stable to go fast, which can be easier (in some ways) at flat tracks like Sebring.  Basic pointers:  -Mind the lift off oversteer. When you get off the gas, the weight shifts forward and the rear loses grip. It is often necessary to use a little (5-20%) throttle to keep the car stable in some corners. When you are comfortable in the car you can use this to your advantage, rotating the car with minimal steering input. This car is really all about how you use the pedals. Be smooth with all of your inputs and you will be rewarded.  There is a weekly post in the SRF forum for the track we are at that week. In it you can find a baseline video walkthrough of the course as well as an ""alien"" walkthrough from one of the top drivers. Start with the baseline walkthroughs and work your way up from there."

This has changed things a lot in ALL cars. :) Much more fun, and way more fun to mess with the chassis.  Nothing was changed tire wise. :) Honestly, I find the new method WAY better, but all the old setups are junk now because of it.  So, if you're running with old setups, you're gonna have a bad time. (also scraping on the ground affects speed more, so, that's important too)  Edit: This involves the Oval cars a bit more, but they discuss a LOT of the suspension changes, and it's amazing what they've changed with it (note it's a 40min video so... yeah): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgHOEHjk3ik"

iRacing,31442d,acdcdave1387,11,Wed Apr 1 21:33:11 2015 UTC,"Splits are 100% determined by iRating. The only thing qualifying determines is where you grid in the split you're put in.  It works this way: say 60 people register for the race and the grid size is 30. The entries are sorted by iRating, and the top 30 drivers (by IR) are put in the first split. The rest are put in the lower split.  THEN, within each split the drivers are sorted by qualifying times. Fastest first (obviously).  THEN, the drivers who didn't qualify are sorted by IR, highest to lowest.  So if you qualify you will always be gridded in front of those guys who didn't qualify. But if you don't qualify, you'll be behind the slowest guy who qualified but in front of the drivers with lower IR than you.  Ideally everybody would qualify. Then the race would be pre-sorted by speed (or at least by who can run that one fast lap, which isn't always the same as being a fast driver for a whole race). But lots of people don't qualify, for various reasons. There's not much you can do about that except hope they don't run you over on their mad rush to the front.  Personally, I ALWAYS qualify. That way I ensure I don't end up behind somebody who can't drive at all but who put in a Q time. There's nothing you can do about having fast guys behind you, but at least you can control whether you have slow guys in front of you :)"
iRacing,31442d,Sasken,2,Wed Apr 1 21:44:36 2015 UTC,"Not all splits are determined by iRating.  Most of the official oval and road series do so, but there are some special events that might not.  For example, the Indy 500 events typically have been split by qualifying time.  Also, Carb Cup is split by qualifying time as an unofficial series.  Short answer though is, yes, always qualify if you feel comfortable starting in the pack."

Of course, seeing that you race National, I never qualify for that (think I contradicted myself right there lol). I don't know, it's just a part of me that wants to avoid wrecks in that series lol.

iRacing,314w9c,Tempyy,3,Thu Apr 2 00:45:07 2015 UTC,I'm new to iRacing and I was a bit skeptical at first but now I love it. There are regular official races plus adhoc user created events. It is all licensed based so you start as a rookie in stock cars (oval) and an mx-5s (road) and basically work your way up through the licenses. I just got out of rookie and into D and almost C and the quality of online racing is great. Finally a racing game where people don't fuck around and actually play seriously! There are fixed races with a predefined car setup and non fixed where you can make modifications to the setup yourself. I usually just run off the stock setup as I really have no idea wtf to do and I'm still competitive and finish top 5 most of the time.  Yes only cockpit view (unless I have missed something) but that's expected for a simulator. I think a wheel is a must though. I started on joypad and that lasted a whole week until i forked out for a Logitech G27 which seems like a good starting point.  Is it worth it? Hell yes. I can see it will cost a fair bit to get fully into it and buy all the tracks and cars but at the moment I just pick up a new track or car every week or so and I still have plenty to do without sinking a heap of $$$ all at once. I just paid for 1 month to give it a go as you get some free tracks and cars to get you started. Totally hooked now!!
iRacing,314w9c,jmac6888,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:11:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you! It seems they try to suck money out of you though buying different tracks and cars.

iRacing,314w9c,allgood2386,3,Thu Apr 2 01:14:32 2015 UTC,"I think you need to think of iRacing as more of a sim. Yes tracks and subs are expensive, I'm most casual and I spend over $100 a year but you're paying for accuracy. They send guys out to the tracks and laser scan them. You pay for a constantly updated physics model that's more accurate then any other consumer sim.  As for upper level cars, you may be experienced enough to get in a race but most are not, both road and oval. If you wanna grab a car and try it out in practice mode you can but you will have to work your way up there. If you are a skilled driver this can be done in a few months time to get the really high end stuff. A few days for most of the c and d classes. I wouldn't count on this though. Racing is challenging and iracing is even more so without real life input.  That being said if all of that sounds good to you and you are willing to learn a track a week and build up your skill sets over a long period then there is no replacement to iracing. At that point you'll care more about how much your spending on hardware then a few tracks each season =P."

For AI fun we might play AC or Forza or whatever but iRacing consumes 95% of time.  Your own actions on track affect your rating and therefore grouping of similar skilled racers.    Even in the races just past rookies you will find 90% of racers intending to race clean and finish there races even if it's only for 15th.    High up in upper splits or the top 5% of racers you'll find some of the best racing on display that will can be as high a quality as real life races.  https://youtu.be/Lxs6CRa8fAY?t=5883

Yes, you pay for a subscription. Yes, if you want to race many of the after-Rookie series, you will have to also buy add-ons.  If you enjoy this hobby (not ""gaming"" but ""sim racing""), you will also be looking at wheel bases and rigs and good pedals and so on. $100 ""entry fee"" into a series will be trivial compared to that. In fact, if you learn even the tiniest bit about the service, you can easily figure out how to reduce your yearly subscription to near zero with participation credits, bonus sales, and so on."

Once you earn your way to the next 'class', D class, you can race in the MASCAR Whelen Series. In C class, you can race the Camping World Trucks or short track Super Late Models. In B class, it's Xfinity Series, then A class is Sprint Cup Series.   That's the NASCAR progression. They also do IndyCar on the oval side.

iRacing,314w9c,jmac6888,2,Thu Apr 2 13:59:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hijack, but I have some questions too. Are all cars only left hand drive? Or are there some right hand drives? How does it affect your rating if your internet drops during a race and you disconnect?If you are shunted and end up spinning someone else out, are you penalised, or the guy that shunted you?"
iRacing,314w9c,mav3r1ck92691,4,Thu Apr 2 04:32:36 2015 UTC,"The MX-5 Roadster, the Radical, and the Aussie V8 cars are right hand drive. The rest of the road cars are left hand drive (I believe; I may have missed one or two right hand drive cars). For most single-seater open-wheel cars, the driver is in the middle.  All of the oval cars are American and therefore left hand drive.  If you disconnect from an official race, you are essentially scored in last place (assuming nobody else disconnects) and you will lose iRating.  The safety rating system is a ""no fault"" system. Both cars are penalized equally. It's something everybody who is new to iRacing hates at first but understands and appreciates later. It's VERY hard to determine fault in an accident and in most cases there's fault to be shared on both sides. If you're a good driver, the system rewards you over time. If you are an unsafe driver, the system reflects that. Again, over time. In the short term, you can have runs of bad luck where you always seem to be getting penalized through no fault of your own. If you stick with it, it all evens out."
iRacing,314w9c,mav3r1ck92691,2,Thu Apr 2 05:12:39 2015 UTC,"The safety rating system is a ""no fault"" system.   I prefer to think of it as an ""all fault"" system. If you have contact with another car, enough to gin up an incident point, then iRacing penalizes both cars (or all, for true eff-ups). To me, that's saying that both cars are at fault and should be penalized.  In turn, this has made me start thinking, after contact, ""What action did I take that caused me to be involved with this incident? What could I have done differently?""  That's a big difference from a ""no fault"" system encouraging thinking along the lines of ""Welp, nothing I could do about rear-ending the car in front of me since no one's at fault. C'est la vie.""  I hope that no one truly would think similiarly in that last scenario but it helps to illustrate my point I think.  Anyhow, that's my soap box for the day."

iRacing,30zp8y,Pimphis,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:19:33 2015 UTC,They have already stated that they are not going to release dirt until they have dynamic track surface in asphalt. Good news is that they hinted at dynamic surfaces coming by the end of the year. I cant wait for iracing to do dirt because they are planning on the track changing and a cushion building up throughout the race.

iRacing,310k3q,Pimphis,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:12:44 2015 UTC,"On entry into turn 1, stay farther to the left before turn in, in turn 3 try hugging the inside more to setup for the right hander. I've won many races in the Caddy, just stay consistent and you'll place well!"
iRacing,310k3q,ClarksonianPause,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:29:51 2015 UTC,"This.  That entry was super shallow, and forced you to scrub off too much speed that you couldve carried through the first part of what is essentially a double apex turn.  The left hander at 3 was a bit wide, but not that big of a deal...and then lifting completely after 5 zapped some speed too.  Overall, for a new racer, you have some nice skills.  Getting fast in iRacing isnt about making big, sweeping changes, its about fine detail and smooth driving.  Keep it up!"
iRacing,310k3q,schtick01101,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:39:01 2015 UTC,"Turn 1/2 (Double apex right) - Turned in too early. This turn does have a kind of early entry, I find the sweet spot for the ""first"" apex for this turn to be where the kerb ends. You could probably drift it up a bit more for the second apex. Both of these should allow you to carry a bit more speed through it.  Turn 3 (Late apex left) - Turn in was a bit awkward. You actually made the radius of the corner bigger by taking that kind of line. Good job on exit as you really want to set up for the quick right as a lot of time is to be gained there.  Turn 4 (Fast right) - Was pretty good, maybe a bit more speed through there, I usually try to track out to the kerbs. I'm not sure how well the caddy does on those kerbs though. Some cars hate them.  Turn 5 (fast right)- Missed the apex slightly. Not a bit deal, not much time lost there as going up the hill over the crest really slows you down since you need to lift for it anyways.  Turn 6 (medium right) - Turned in to early. You can see it on the wheel. You kind of commit to the turn, back off then re-commit. Turn in a bit later and make it a confident turn. As a result you couldn't commit to throttle on and had to lift early track out.  Turn 7 (Fast right)- Didn't carry enough speed through the center/exit. You can usually track out to the kerbs on the left. This turn is important as this is the longest straight on the course. You can have the world's fastest lap going and booger up that corner and lose a ton of time.  I haven't driven the caddy here yet so I don't know the characteristics so these are just my humble observations."
iRacing,310k3q,CTSVracing,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:30:44 2015 UTC,"On the uphill straigt, the place where your cts-v lifts, if you have too much speed caring in, use the corner, and let the car strafe to the left of the hill, by that, your chance of lifting is smaller and you get a better position for the upcoming right corner.

If you think the faster drivers have that much better setups you will be a second off the pace before you even hit the track mentally.  Spending several hours WITHOUT tweaking setups or changing sets is the best way forward.    If you are spending less than 3 hours per week preparing for races, don't mess with setups.

iRacing,30v4it,hemibemi,3,Tue Mar 31 15:05:40 2015 UTC,I lifted the following image from a forum post a while back (I think it was in the Ruf C-Spec section).  It is a very handy quick cheat sheet on what changes to make when attempting to fix a problem you're noticing:  http://i.imgur.com/qANvZ7K.jpg
iRacing,30v4it,Fuzzwah,2,Tue Mar 31 00:12:04 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I've only been sim racing for six months and I don't have much experience setting up cars. I've been running fixed road race series so I can concentrate on more basic skills (memorizing lines, cornering effectively) before I start trying to modify setups. My reasoning is, if I'm not turning consistent laps, I can't accurately gauge the setup changes I'm making.   It sounds like you're already at that point, so I'll take a stab at answering based on what I've read over the last six months.  I don't think there are specific answers for ""how much does it affect the car if I lower the pressure on my tires by 0.5 psi,"" because there are too many variables involved, not least of which is you as a driver and the hardware you're using. Even if you and I are both using a G27, we may not have them calibrated the same, we may using paddles vs. H-shifter, or you heel-toe and I auto-blip, or you have a cockpit setup with three monitors and I have a desk chair with wheels...lots of variables.   It seems like people who work on setups start by thinking about what they want the car to do - maybe the steering feels sluggish, or you get a lot of wheel spin when you accelerate out of a corner, or the car feels unstable at high speed  - and they take steps to correct those situations.  This picture was linked on the iRacing member forums and it talks about those driving conditions and what setup changes you can make to compensate for them. I found that image in this thread which has a lot more suggestions about setting up your car.   The other resource that looks helpful was in the iRacing Skip Barber forum. This thread is a full tuning guide for the Skip Barber cars. They're not as complicated as the HPD, but there's a lot of information about how changes to the Skippy setup affect the way the car handles. The first post in the thread also has a link to a Quick Guide for setups if the full 20 page document is too overwhelming.   Finally, I've been wondering about how I'm going to learn all this myself, and I think it's going to take a while. I'll have to start with a baseline (either the iRacing baseline or a setup from another iRacer), give it some time on the track, pay attention to how the car handles on the track, define the condition I'd like to change (understeers on corner entry, for example), make a change to my setup to correct that condition, and test it on the track again.   I imagine, over seasons of racing, I'll end up with a collection of notes about different cars, different tracks, and different setups. I used to flyfish, and I started out not understanding much of anything about what I doing above the water or what was happening under the water. When I wasn't catching fish, I'd try to change one thing at a time - the fly, the depth I was fishing, the weight of the line - and watch to see if anything changed. I think setups are going to be the same way. There's no definitive guide to how to setup a car because we all drive so differently, and you're going to be your best resource for evaluating how setup changes impact your experience on the track.  TL:DR Use the image link or the Skip Barber Quick Guide link for setup changes and spend a lot of time on the track learning how the car behaves when you make simple adjustments."
iRacing,30v4it,sithload,2,Tue Mar 31 01:00:05 2015 UTC,This picture[1]   was linked on the iRacing member forums and it talks about those driving conditions and what setup changes you can make to compensate for them.

iRacing,30v4it,Grimzentide,2,Wed Apr 1 11:33:19 2015 UTC,"As others have said, there is a check box for metric system on the tuning page.  As for tuning, the setup guide really is one of the best ones.  I would really take the time and read over it, despite how complicated it sounds and looks.  It may also help to tune on an easier car.  I started tuning on a GT3 car where there are probably half as many options, especially things like aero which can throw a wrench into how you learn to tune suspension.    Sorry I can't help too much, most of tuning is experience and time.  All i can say is to be patient because my first tune took at least 8 hours to do (of tuning time spanned over several days), but I can now tune a vehicle to be race ready in about 45 minutes.  15 minutes on a good day - sometimes tunes just don't work and you have to start from scratch.  The methodology I use when I tune is to start from baseline.  If you have a car with downforce settings, set that first and keep with it.  Afterwards, drive the car for 10 laps around the track you are tuning for, and pay careful attention to what you don't like.  Does it oversteer too easily from the rear, is on power oversteer too much or too little.  Does the front of the car grip as you expect, how is the balance of it all.  After that, work on spring rates, and then camber and toe, roll bars, and then your shock tuning (compression and damping).  I personally feel shock tuning is the biggest thing for me. That is 90% of what I spend my time on.  You can fix certain things of your tune with other aspects (like sudden loss of rear traction can be fixed with either camber or rear roll bar), but I do 95% of my oversteer, understeer control with dampers.  The last thing I do is work on tire pressures.  Strangely enough...  It has a big impact, but I never seem to use it as a dynamic tuning. more of a tire wear aspect."
iRacing,30v4it,SoggyFrostedFlakes,2,Tue Mar 31 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"OP, use some of the links here and they will really help you. For simpler cars like the MX5 Cup and Skippy, I suggest using a modified baseline on the forums.  For the more high powered cars though like GT3, I would recommend you using the charts to build your own setup. I say this because other people's setups might not be right for your driving style. I tried other setups for my Z4 GT3 and I hated it, so I made my own from scratch. It may not be a quick setup, but it is MY setup and I am comfortable in it.   Here what I would do:  1) Start with the baseline and run some laps and see how your car reacts. Write them down in your notes tab.  2) Then change one setting (or two if they are spring related) and see how the car drives. Does the car react the way you want it to? Has it fixed some things, but caused other problems? Time to fiddle with more settings and find a balance! 3) Keep running laps and keep fiddling. Then, is the car stable for race distance? A more unstable setup may be better for quali, but during the race, it might be very loose when your tires go. So, to check, do a race distance run and see how the car reacts and change some settings accordingly.  As for where to start, for me in GT3 I did:  1) ABS, TC (you usually lower them anyway), and run some laps 2) Rear Wing - probably the first thing you should do. Front Wing as well in an open wheel car. Run some more laps.  3) Spring Perch Offset 4) Tire Pressures 5) Dampers (front and rear) 6) Front and rear toe-in  I wouldn't call myself an expert by any stretch of the imagination. I still have a lot to learn. But I read some things for a couple hours, and just started fiddling myself and testing. Mind, I tested 5 or 6 hours alone in open practice to dial in a decent setup for GT3, but still if you got some time and you work at it, you will get better. I actually have no idea what I'm doing half the time. I just read some online resources, and adjust. If I like the changes, I keep it. If not, I dump it and change something else lol. :)  Resources: use the setup solutions link from sithload, as well as the iRacing Setup Guide and the Quick Reference Chart."

iRacing,30sg8u,ManNotHamburger,8,Mon Mar 30 09:13:58 2015 UTC,"First off great show but I would love to see you feature some of the ""smaller"" series in this, for example I race the Radical SR8 and have been a little disappointed not to see it featured in the first 3 weeks, especially given we were at Spa last week and are a Oulton Park this week, both are extremely fun tracks in this car.   The car has been struggling for about a year since we had a bad physics update and it got written off by the community (it was un-raceable tbh), now its improved again we've been working on increasing participation and newcomers to the series always give great feedback about the car and the racing we have (we have official races almost every day at 18:45 and 20:45 gmt+1). However it's hard for us the get the message out and it isn't a car you can jump in for 5 mins and expect to be fast, it requires a different driving mentality to many of the cars on the service.  Maybe each week you could feature a different ""smaller"" series to try and get the word about as I know there are other series in similar situations to us. You could stop by each series forum to get feedback on which week the regular runners would recommend people trying their car on and maybe a few tips about driving it or whatever. It's just a suggestion but is something I think could benefit the community greatly and open peoples eyes to the enjoyment that can be found in racing the less mainstream series."
iRacing,30sg8u,Turnermator13,3,Mon Mar 30 16:54:53 2015 UTC,"I have to admit that the radical is one car I completely forget is on iracing.

iRacing,30sg8u,bouncebackability,3,Mon Mar 30 20:30:21 2015 UTC,"The saddest part of iRacing is the number of neglected series.  I've never tried the Radical, but I do know of plenty other cars that are awesome but mostly forgotten (Riley DP, Silver Crown, Lotus 49.)  I definitely would have given the Radical a shot if I thought it had any participation.  Catch-22, that.  The participation does look a lot better in that series than I would have guessed.  Maybe I'll give it a shot soon.    All I'll promise is that I will mention the most popular few series (NASCAR trucks, Skip Barber, Star Mazda, Blancpain, Indy oval fixed,) the big events (Road Warrior and NASCAR iRacing series,) and any series I'm currently promoting (Indy mixed.)  Along with that, I glance through every single series to find stuff that I'd personally like to run that week.  My own biases go in there.  I'm most likely to mention combos running my favorite tracks like Bathurst and Road Atlanta and also any tracks that don't get much love like Oran Park and VIR.    One other consideration is that I do not own all of the content.  There are plenty of great tracks and cars like Phillip Island and the Lotus 49 where I cannot shoot footage for the video because I do not own the content.  I'm less likely to show off a combo if all I have are images to go with it.    Speaking of P.I., I need to snatch that and get practicing for the Skip Barber this week.  That's a good excuse to learn the track."

iRacing,30tob3,Sasken,7,Mon Mar 30 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"This. Karts and dirty racing are both far too niche-specific to waste the scads of development time they would require. To make matters worse, the very small contingent of iracers who really passionately want those types of racing are likely also going to be utterly disappointed with the result and then just complain about how it was done wrong.  There's SO very much still to be done and improved with the standard tarmac model that any of those types of things are, I think (and hope), never going to happen.  Edit: Consider iRacing has been in heavy development for about 8 years and as great as the simulation is, people are still bitching to no end about how bad the tarmac modeling is!"

Lastly, there was a rumor that karts would be added as a Dev had posted a picture of a 3d model of a tire. :) which people matched to a kart tire.  Whatever gets more people in iRacing. _^"
iRacing,30tob3,arsenicfox,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:19:48 2015 UTC,"Yep, dynamic track is on the way. What does that have to do with dirt and kart development?

iRacing,30tob3,arsenicfox,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:55:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get what the dynamic surface is about, I am just not sure why you are talking to me about it as though I discussed it in any way in my initial post. My post was simply: karts and dirt are, at best, a very long way off because the modelling of standard race cars on asphalt surfaces is still in such heavy development (as evidenced by the continued evolution of the tyre model and now the dynamic track).  And in any case, the post I replied to initially is the most relevant. There are already too many series and too many cars for the number of serious drivers. We don't need more disciplines watering down the numbers further."
iRacing,30tob3,jrebs,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:01:08 2015 UTC,"Except, with the additions of new features and series, you can also pique the interest of additional players.   You treat it as if iRacing is stuck at the current amount of players..."
iRacing,30tob3,arsenicfox,2,Mon Mar 30 19:28:11 2015 UTC,"Adding new disciplines still spreads the players out. IF it succeeds in drawing new ones, then great, you might just be able to keep the same number of users per series afterwards, but I wager that's unlikely. I've also been iRacing since before it went public in 2008 and so have some idea of the ebb and flow of how user numbers and series work together. If you've been around for a while you'd have been witness to the many series that had to be cancelled because they tried to cover too many interests at one time.  Consider that anyone who is holding out for dirt or kart racing probably doesn't have that big an interest in other disciplines. While it's true that there are always more users to bring in, iRacing has been developed and marketed long enough that I think most of the serious users have been reached. Of the people not currently on iRacing, I would wager that the majority of them are simply not that passionate about sim racing that a subscription-based service with paid content is going to be something they pick up and stick with. Some of them will be the kinds of users who might stick with it but are insistent on different content (and thus they will not contribute much to the current series which need more participation). Then there's a remainder of people who just haven't heard about it yet and those who want dirt/karts but might also get into other racing once they make it on board. If you think that that remaining number of users is large enough that it would be worth the HUGE undertaking of adding dirt/karts to the service, then I think you overestimate how much revenue that number of users can really bring or I think you underestimate how large the cost of accommodating them with a totally new discipline would be.   And I am trying to be quite clear that these are my opinions/observations. I don't profess to know with certainty what the costs and expected gains are, but I've been sim racing quite a while, seen a lot of people come and go from iracing, and I just don't believe (and won't until it happens) that these additions would really be worth the cost to iRacing to launch them. There is currently a pretty real problem with getting existing or new users to run particular cars. Adding more cars does not help that at all. Adding more users WITHOUT adding new cars is the best goal for the time being."

iRacing,30tob3,arsenicfox,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:50:37 2015 UTC,"Uh...well if you want to call playing racing games at 5 years old 'sim racing', then I've got you, having been at it for about 30 years...but that's of little merit here since 10-15 year old games have nothing to do with modern competitive sim racing (anything outside of real competition - such as Asetto Corsa lapping - is irrelevant to me).  iRacing is so much more than just a sim/game and that's why I think decisions like ""should we have dirt"" are much more complicated. It would be an easy thing to say that more features and more cars is better if you're selling a game like Gran Turismo. It's a very different situation when the bulk of the product of iRacing is the community and official racing competition structure it provides. Adding new cars or disciplines has a very important impact on those official competitions and it requires a very delicate balance. A balance that iRacing has struggled with since they went public and which can really never be perfected but has been improved greatly over the years."

I think that because of the lack of steering wheel input in a real kart, you depend much more on the g forces to tell what the kart is doing and that never translates over to a sim, from the ones I have tried at least.  Dirt racing would be neat but the dynamic track model deals with surface grip not surface geometry, like you would want in a dirt racer.   Personally I would rather see iracing get better at what they already do instead of spreading themselves thinner."

It needs to be harder to get into B+ class, no more TT you're way up in Licenses.

In fact, in one forum Tony Gardener rumored they may be in the next build as, according to another Dev, ""it is not dependent on dx11"" and ""could be released at any time. We just want to make sure its done right""  The issue is that most races are short, so they don't want it to not be noticeable, but want it to be natural for 24 hour events.

iRacing,30tob3,arsenicfox,2,Mon Mar 30 18:22:43 2015 UTC,I hope they cater to the 24 hour guys. I want it to be realistic. If I'm doing 40 laps the theory is that its because I'm not experienced and shouldn't be dealing with dynamic track/setups/fatigue. I'd rather they pander to realism

I love what iRacing are trying to do, implement things properly/correctly.  But having been on the service for a number of years, I feel that I'm just going round in circles so to speak.  Sort of hot lapping circles with a little tyre falloff.    When the dynamic temperature/weather and surface model all arrive it should bring a new lease of life to everything and really make what you learn in practice, in all aspects of racing, including how the weather affects the track and tyres, setup decisions, strategy etc...  I just feel this is missing at the minute due to the lack of dynamic conditions.  I feel we are going in the correct direction, it's just that I'm somewhat impatient I guess."
iRacing,30tob3,jrebs,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:37:41 2015 UTC,"I don't mean this facetiously, but do you actually even irace currently? I ask because it sounds from your comments like maybe you aren't aware that variable weather settings is one of the many features that was 'coming soon' and has been released something like 2 years or more back. Instead of every session having the same weather, there is a range of temps, humidity settings, cloud coverage, fog and other factors which all affect car engine and tyre performance. This has been available for quite a while and is now used in all of the series I run in.  Additionally, the 'realistic' weather setting causes a session to run with a randomized weather setting taken from a range of values considered expected for that track location. With realistic weather settings, the weather can actually change during the course of a race. Most people don't do races long enough for real-time weather changes to matter at all, but in endurance races (such as the NEO 6hr races), changeable weather is a factor that some teams can take an advantage by working with.  Edit: ah nm, I see you said ""then I will return to iRacing"", so it makes sense that you are missing out on some of the developments.  Edit 2: hahaha, and with that knowledge, this is more amusing:   I feel we are going in the correct direction, it's just that I'm somewhat impatient I guess."

But I find the rules and endurance challenge of rally racing a great way to compete.  One attempt per stage until the next scheduled event. Making potentially tough choices for service. In my head I imagine it to be a great online racing experience if implemented realistically. It's so different than circuit racing: lap after lap of the same challenge where consistent perfection wins - vs rally: constantly changing course and conditions where adaptability and endurance wins.

This will free up the Advanced mazda cup. again a free car, altough it tends to only race at one free track per season. Acheiving your MPR (4 races in your licence, and a safety rating of >3.0) will allow you to enter B licence races such as the Blancpain at the end of the second season.  You can acheive all this a LOT quicker, within just a few weeks, if you can get your Safety rating above 4.0 and keep it there.

iRacing,30sgbb,InZomnia365,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:27:35 2015 UTC,"yes, but...  example, If you are a d licence you can enter c licence races with a 4.0 sr without doing your 4 races. but thats your limit, you are still shown as d class so could never enter anything higher than C until you do your 4 races in either D or C.  if you have achieved your mpr in D and have a 4.0sr you become a fully fledged member of the next licence, shown as C licence, and so the process begins again."
iRacing,30sgbb,bouncebackability,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:47:03 2015 UTC,Can you be D 4.0 and complete your Class D MPR by doing Class C races?
iRacing,30sgbb,InZomnia365,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:54:03 2015 UTC,"I think so yes, that's the only bit im not 100% sure on. But it seems to be what happened to make me B licence."
iRacing,30sgbb,bouncebackability,2,Mon Mar 30 17:33:10 2015 UTC,"When I got out of rookies and into D I tried the SRF and Skippy and they both really took me by surprise. The off throttle oversteer that each of them exhibit was something I had basically zero experience with.  I seriously had to admit that I was a total newb and re-learn how to drive. Very humbling. Having battled through it and now focusing on the Mustang, Ruf C-Spec and BMW Z4 in the GT3 the lessons I learned in the Skippy and SRF really pay off. They're all very different cars but having that base from the D license classes definitely helps get a feel for all the other cars on the service."
iRacing,30sgbb,Fuzzwah,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:00:04 2015 UTC,"This is super important. It's one of the more useful skills to know and most of the nicer vehicles hide this. I can't imagine surviving some of the races I've had where I've made a mistake, and gone too deep. Knowing how to feel that lift off over steer can spin you just enough to get you pointed and keeping you off track. This one skill is probably one of the most important things I learned when doing skippies."
iRacing,30sgbb,allgood2386,2,Tue Mar 31 00:40:48 2015 UTC,"If you want to learn to drive correctly you'll stay in the skippy for at least 2 seasons. Yes everyone wants to go on ot drive hpd's and gt3's but the skippy is used to this day to teach driving technique. My path has been mx5 to skippy to mazdastar/upper series (hpd endurance races are fun but hpd's are easy to drive).  If you do anything though stay in skippy/f2000 for at least a season. The rest of the cars are faster for a reason, they handle better (plus more bhp of course). Skippy ain't got traction control you don't have to spend hours figuring out your brake bias and if you can master the skippy you'll be fine in other series.  The skippy when going slow is hard to drive (or fast) but other series are easy to drive going slow (almost on rails) so you fall into bad habbits just keeping up with the leaders.  edit: I take a week or 2 in the skippy at random weeks just to go back and apply what I have learned to a car that unbalanced characteristics. It's a learning vehicle and everyone should go back and drive it a few weeks a year only to show you how much you have improved."
iRacing,30sgbb,allgood2386,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:31:38 2015 UTC,"Stick with the mazda, they're fun. In D I would go for the Skip Barber series, yes it's open wheel but it will make you a better driver.  The others I wouldn't spend my time with, once you're getting better moving up to C goes too fast to be worth it."
iRacing,30sgbb,Eburon,1 point,Mon Mar 30 09:32:31 2015 UTC,I only just got to D Class as well. I am basically doing MX5 and Skip Barber just to improve on my consistency.  Have been looking at something different but for now I just sticking with the basics. I have found the Skip Barber really challenging but also pretty rewarding.  Really makes you feel like your learning the basics of racing all over again. (for me anyway :) )
iRacing,30sgbb,jmac6888,1 point,Mon Mar 30 11:10:53 2015 UTC,"I have a B licence and still race SkipBarber, just because it is extremely fun. So find a series that you find cool and then race in it. I recommend SkipBarber, simply because it is so popular (races every hour) and helps you get better at driving."
iRacing,30sgbb,teabagZz,1 point,Mon Mar 30 11:43:37 2015 UTC,Personally as you have already stated you want access to Blancpain car series i would go skippy/caddy and just work your way to D4.0 in order to fast track to C class license asap to get access to drive the cars you really crave ;)
iRacing,30sgbb,speedkinduci,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:29:16 2015 UTC,Srf is a good way to go. It is a durable car as you are most likely still learning and going to make mistake. Also there is a lot of draft with that car so it will teach you patience and  race-craft and like someone else said there is still 3 free Tracks on the schedule
iRacing,30sgbb,True_Racer,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:11:32 2015 UTC,skip barber is a lot of fun and usually a high turn out for races.  also it gets you a little more prepared for the faster open wheels.  but if open wheel isnt your thing i'd go with the caddy.  its got quite a bit of power and takes some real skill driving it on cold tires
iRacing,30sgbb,lagatron,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:27:13 2015 UTC,"Global challenge could be a good one.  The CTS-V and Corvette are both good stepping stones to the GT3 series.  Also if you haven't already, buy the $100 of credits for $75.  You don't need to spend them now, but you will as your class increases."
iRacing,30rdey,ETPhoneMyHome,4,Mon Mar 30 01:33:07 2015 UTC,You learn who you can trust and who you can't really quickly.
iRacing,30rdey,tstraw48,3,Mon Mar 30 02:08:22 2015 UTC,"What this guy said, even in NiS and IndyCar oval, I(you)just have to learn who people are and who will race you clean and who won't. You can learn this within the first few laps, if they're aggressive the first 5 laps of a 200 lap race, leave em the hell alone, they'll take care of themselves sooner or later. Just lay back and run in the back, or start from the pits if you're at Charlotte in the street stocks."
iRacing,30rdey,Pizazloco,3,Mon Mar 30 03:19:14 2015 UTC,"Just a little confused. You said there was a car down low, a slow car high, you said you tried to pass the slow car, but also mention going 3 wide. Did you go 3 wide when you got spun, or were you using that as an example? Also, what series?  Anyway, for most series and most tracks, going 3 wide is a no-no, especially if you don't think one of the other drivers is competent. My advice would be to try and let the two drivers ahead work it out among themselves, and then pass them one at a time. In a scenario where one driver didn't practice, letting them race it out will often result in both crashing over a long battle. As for being concerned about the guy behind you,either let him go and have him sort out the mess, or hope he knows how to brake. If he is too aggressive, let him go and he'll probably speed up the wrecking of the two cars infront. Also, if someone is really all-over the track, give them room. Even if you loose a tenth or two by staying low exiting a corner so they have plenty of room, still better than contact. Just be careful not to hold it down too much and spin yourself out.  As for qualifying, I mainly race the SK/Tour mods, but getting in any lap, even if it is 5 second off the pace, will normally get you in the top 2/3rds of the field, sometimes in the top 1/4th. Obviously you need to watch for faster cars passing you, but you avoid the mayhem of the other slower cars and other poor drivers who start WAY above their IR because they simply qualified.  TL:DR- Don't go 3-wide, if you don't trust not getting wrecked by other cars let them wreck themselves, give those who can't hold their line plenty of room, qualify to avoid havoc."
iRacing,30rdey,Paul2448,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:23:21 2015 UTC,Yeah so I tried to pass the guy that was going super slow up high when there was someone down low with me. This was in Sprint Cup cars. Thank you for the tips by the way. I definitely need to start being way more cautious in my driving.
iRacing,30rdey,doveenigma13,2,Mon Mar 30 02:37:36 2015 UTC,Well I didn't see this post.   There's no reason to try to go past a wreck at full speed when the yellow will come out. Slow down and dodge when you have to.
iRacing,30rdey,lordgaga_69,2,Mon Mar 30 02:47:34 2015 UTC,"for sub 1k IR, basically expect people to treat it like a game more than a sim. expect kids, and expect that not everyone knows or cares about sporting code or anything about driver etiquette.  you may get lucky but thats the exception more than the rule."
iRacing,30rdey,Eburon,2,Mon Mar 30 03:00:18 2015 UTC,"High iRating isn't exactly clean either, too many think they'll be the next big thing and do impossible moves. I don't see difference between <1000 or the 2000-2500. Well the difference is in the first there are people who haven't practiced, who don't know their braking points and those wrecks are easy avoided, just be patient and they'll go wide sooner rather than later. Give them some room on exit but you should be fine. In the higher splits they think they can divebomb you without wrecking and more often than not fail at their attempt halfway through the corner. The high iRating is a different story."
iRacing,30rdey,gsuoumu,2,Mon Mar 30 07:21:44 2015 UTC,"Default position: I can't trust these guys.  Certain drivers will prove you wrong and that you can trust them. But until then, you assume you can't. I'm by no means the most skilled driver in the world, but that philosophy has gotten me over 3k iRating."
iRacing,30rdey,smythbdb,2,Mon Mar 30 04:01:58 2015 UTC,I got out of rookies by not trying to pass. In your example if you were to slow down and stay behind the other 2 cars would've crashed and you would've gained 2 positions by slowing down but by trying to pass you ended up losing positions. Obviously this doesn't always make sense to do but if someone is driving sketchy just stay away until the straight.
iRacing,30rdey,bozboy204,2,Mon Mar 30 05:00:03 2015 UTC,"I would echo the advice others are putting forward:  As difficult as it seems, when you are in the bottom splits you should make your primary objective survival. If you have to give up a spot or two because you lifted or braked to avoid a crash, you are very likely to gain all of that back and more in a few laps anyways.   Driving cautiously (at times it will feel overly cautious) will teach you how to read which drivers you can trust and which guys are the maniacs. Once you've gotten better at getting through a race with minimal incidents you'll find yourself in situations where you are comfortable passing and are able to do so safely.   Just racing cleanly will get your irating up as well. Often times just finishing on the lead lap without having to pit will get you in the top 5-8 positions. A few races like that and you should be out of the bottom splits and at least in the middle split."
iRacing,30rdey,doveenigma13,1 point,Mon Mar 30 06:02:15 2015 UTC,"You can't trust somebody who doesn't know what they're doing, you can trust a guy that pushed too hard and lost it a bit. You will learn the difference. Sometimes you just can't avoid it.  Are you on rookies or d class? It gets better when you promote, drivers are less incompetent, and there will be less reason for others to try to pass a wreck at full speed."

iRacing,30rdey,Eburon,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:34:55 2015 UTC,"you main goal is avoiding stupid wrecks at low iRating. Practice and if you're fast qualify when you guess to have a good shot at the first couple of rows. Don't qualify if you're slow, start in the back.  Be patient, iRating doesn't mean a thing at this point, and you'll be surprised how far up the field you get just by not wrecking. If you see people not holding a consistent line, don't try to pass them untill you really have the advantage. Most times they'll take themselves out before you get to that point. People who don't run good lines wear out their tires and can't possibly run fast laps. So keep calm you'll get by eventually.  Identify trouble zones in the pack before they get into trouble. leave a bit of room between you and them and let them figure it out without you in the mix, once it's settled go ahead."
iRacing,30rdey,Retarded_Scientist,1 point,Mon Mar 30 07:29:43 2015 UTC,"In rookies you shouldn't trust anybody to hold their line. A lot of people can, but you never know who can't until they put you into the wall. Once you get into a different series, you'll find that you are racing against the same people over and over again. At this point, you can make a list, or take mental notes of how each person drives. There are people who I race against regularly that are really conservative and will let you pass easily if you catch them (and I take notes so I can repay the favor if they are obviously faster than me). There are others who will cleanly hold their line and race tough for their position. And there are others who are idiots that I refuse to get within 3 carlengths of."
iRacing,30pfim,Cakeor,5,Sun Mar 29 15:33:09 2015 UTC,"That was close as fuck! Great race!   As for the commentary, I like the energy. I could feel the excitement just from your voice alone. That's good because it got me excited too.   If there was one criticism, I would say not to state everything that's happening as it's happening. The person watching the video can see what is happening at every moment. Instead, give insight to what you are thinking at that moment. For instance, when you were saying 'closer, closer, closer'. I was thinking, 'well yes, of course he's getting closer, I can see that'. Could try something like 'I'm using his draft here to get close enough to hopefully make a move on his inside on these next set of turns.'  I post some more. I'd definitely watch."

Good for those cars where the rift head position isn't quite right.  With that, you can also move the mirrors around since you don't have the virtual mirror option.

I've protested shit in Street Stock a couple times and I usually get the answer ""driver will be contacted and monitored"" etc. which essentially means iRacing agrees that the guy was at fault. E.g. once a lapped and horribly slow driver took me out deliberately (was actually last week) when I was leading at USA Int'l. Protested, success.   Then again I only protest the really bad stuff where I have 0% fault. It's often the case that even if you have a little tiny bit of fault your own iRacing doesn't like to take action.   But your friend does seem to have been fucked over in this case!   Edit: to add, iRacing is really adamant about clean language in text & voice chats. If some loser protests you for saying ""fuck"" in text chat, you've got a good chance of getting temporarily banned from text chat. Tbh, sometimes that still doesn't keep me from swearing, especially in Oval rookies because sometimes it really is bullshit what other people are doing! Luckily I got the Oval D license yesterday.   Also, I find the road side to be much cleaner. Of course, the racing is less tight and all but I do think that there is a higher level of mutual respect in road racing on iRacing. Might also be because I'm usually in the top splits and in Oval often in the shitsplit."

iRacing,30ltqz,grayfox1210,3,Sat Mar 28 23:50:46 2015 UTC,"Team Reddit RUF had a good start and made up some places during the first two hours. Second driver doing first stint now and we're still going strong in the middle of the pack.  edit: Just finished my final stint and the last 2 laps of it ended on a sour note. Was driving clean all morning and then rear ended the lead GT3, albeit softly. Then did the same thing exact thing on the same turn with one of the higher placed cars a lap later. I'm frustrated how I ended my driving and pushed just a tad too hard in the end. Just ran out of grip. I'm sorry to the two that I affected and I hope I didn't get you guys too bad. But that aside, I had a blast and can't wait to do the next one!  Holding 14th place for now but we have faster drivers still to strap in.   Question: Is anyone having trouble matching their pace they were doing in practice? I was putting in consistent mid 2:02's but the best I could do were high 2:02's twice."

After getting back out on the track (after getting towed for a FULL lap since I DCed after Turn 1), we ran into a magician performing a spectacular vanishing act, after which he re-appear inside our car. Sent us to the pits with a couple minutes of damage. Now were circulating in 10th position. Running OK laptimes, but the car is pretty banged up and off-balance, so its hard. Ill be jumping in after this stint and driving to the end, barring any more connectivity issues.  Such a shame, I was doing consistent 2:03s in P4 as well... Was slowly catching up to 3rd when i happened. Well, thats racing, I guess. Still, 10th in class (or higher) is way better than I expected going into this race."

iRacing,30ltqz,Fuzzwah,3,Sat Mar 28 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed my first 1 hour session in the car, had some excitement on around lap 5 when someone spun in the hairpin in front of me. I was able to avoid contact via a short trip across the green stuff. Beyond that it was a pretty calm hour and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The leaders in the Ruf, who were a good 50 seconds in front of us, had to pit due to damage which promoted us into the lead.   /u/bouncebackability is back in the car for another 1 hour stint and we're still leading the GT3 class after all the pit stops were complete.  Next up I'll be strapping back in for a double stint."
iRacing,30ltqz,InZomnia365,2,Sat Mar 28 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"Well that was awesome fun. I actually made a pass for the lead! Granted the guy I passed then pitted a lap later and was only in the lead because they ran a little longer than the leaders, but it still counts damn it.  I made a mistake when pitting in the middle of my double stint, I failed to tick the ""begin fueling"" box. Thankfully I came in with 1.5 laps of fuel left so I was able to do a single lap and then come back in. That cock up dropped us back to 2nd, 25 seconds behind the lead.  I hauled him back in to just 14 seconds before he pitted. They did a driver change and the new guy was about 4 seconds a lap slower than me, so I was able to build a good lead before handing over.  I'm not sure of our 3rd driver's reddit account name, but he's currently doing a fantastic job building on the lead. He's a few laps into his 2nd hour and is lapping consistently in the 2:03's.

Dropped a few spots, but sitting comfortably at P7 at the moment.  About halfway through now. Sitting at P5. Theres been a couple of scares. I went sideways in T14 at 230kmh, also had a go on the grass down the Ullman Straight. Peter has had a few minor spins and a pitlane speeding penalty :P Zach, our last driver, is yet to actually go in the car yet, he is up next. He has stayed with Peter and I, spotting for us pretty much the entire race so far. Hats off to that, and good luck in his next four stints. I cant really believe that weve made it this far without any major accidents. Heres to another great half of the race!  Closing in on 4 hours remaining. Zach has almost done his first two stints, and were sitting pretty in P4 with a sizeable gap both back to P5 and forwards to P3. ""Bessie"", as we've come to call our little McLaren, has taken a few hits, but its luckily all minor bodywork damage. Im scheduled to jump in at the end of this stint, then Zach does his remaining two stints, and I will (hopefully) bring it back home in one piece. Peter has finished his stints, and will eagerly be awaiting updates while he is away at a house party :P  Alright, so we had a few technical issues. First, I was disconnected while I was driving my stint, leaving us with a tow ALL around the track from T1, resulting in losing about 4 spots. Then we had a run-in with a lagging racer who disappeared from the track for a few seconds, only to re-appear inside of our car... So we were sent to the pit with 3 minutes of repairs and are sitting in 11th at the moment..."

That is until I jumped in the car and ruined everything.  8 laps left in my first stint, i slide it out of sunset, but managed to keep it from going into a wall - only by ditching it into pit lane.  So that cut my first stint short, and then 10 laps left on stint 2, I lost it on T10.  Binned it into the wall and took 9 minutes of repairs.  We are currently 18th (from 1st).  5:43pm Update: GRAsim team #1 is getting back up there.  When i finished my stint, i was 11.  Saw both reddit teams, hope I didn't piss them off or anything.  It was 2 solid stints with no problems and consistent lap times (mid 02s to mid 03s).   I did have one instance with CCR Racing.  We were having a nice heated battle through turn 10 and the next 5 corners.  From my replays, we had about 2 feet of distance at the closest point (and the point at which their car went off).  If any of the CCR guys are on here, I definitely didn't want to hit you, and I didn't think I hit you either.  Not sure what happened (maybe netcode?), but I'm sorry your car went off.  6:52pm Update: team #1 is in 8th now.  We had a spin from an HPD and a speeding in pits penalty, but we're hanging on tight.2 laps from 6th, 3 laps from 3rd.  It's going to be interesting to see how these last 2.5 hours go with fatigue setting in.  End of race update: GRAsim Team #1 managed to get 6th place, down from 18th at our worst.  It was a great race, and we got lucky to grab 6th (another car crashed itself out).  Good racing from most of the guys out there, and I hope to see the reddit teams in more Road Warrior races."

Two of the guys were relatively new to the car (and track for that matter), and werent as confident under braking into some corners (like Sunset Bend etc)  We barely touched anyone, though, and the few times we did it was equal fault I suppose. A close call in the braking zone doesnt do anything except for rattling the guy who sees you in the mirror ;) it can be annoying, but atleast its better than an actual hit."

So far things are going alright.  I span the car coming out of Sunset bend and sustained some front-right damage, had to pit for eight minutes of repairs but the car is all fine and we're on our final stint.

We ended up finishing P18 in class. A (not so) short summary of the race, for those interested:  We started at pole, although I was devoured by the Infinite Racing Group and GRAsim Team #1 teams pretty quickly. Ran in third for the first couple of hours. Dropped down to 6th after losing a bit of time on a bathroom break during a pitstop, but fought our way back into the top 5 where we stayed for the majority of the race. With about 4 hours left, I lost my internet connection while driving the car, setting us back a little bit waiting for a tow. And then it was pretty much a downward spiral for a couple of hours - first we have an incident with another driver with a connection issue, which put us both in the pits. Then, after small bumps here and there, we hit the grass, and subsequently the wall, after T1 causing major damage to the engine. We waited 20 minutes for engine repairs, and another 8 for aero repair (after crawling around for one lap). I then drove a car with ""extensive body modifications"" which gave me LEGENDARY downforce and grip, but also left me about 30kmh dry on the straights. Drove that while staying out of traffic for about 20 minutes before the engine blew up (expected, really). Luckily, the mechanics had a spare one, which they spent 30 minutes swapping in. At that point there was about 1 hour left. I had a full tank, brand new rubber, and a revitalized McLaren twin-turbo V8 howling for blood. That last stint was magical to me. I wasnt going crazy fast in terms of outright speed (high 2:03s - low 2:04s), but I was flying relative to most of the field, which was just an amazing experience. Literally rolled over the line with less than a liter of fuel, which gave me enough for a 360 burnout before it coughed up blood.  I want to sincerely thank Peter (/u/BreastHunter) and Zach (/u/h3r4ld) for an awesome day of racing. Although it didnt go exactly as we wanted to near the end, it definitely went a lot better than anticipated, all things considered! I also wanna thank /u/bouncebackability for putting together the teams, working out schedules, and pretty much managing the teams up until the race.  And while I am on a award ceremony-like thanking speech, Id like to thank all of YOU for making this an overall awesome event. Yes, incidents happen and words were thrown, but all in all I think we can all agree that what we did today was pretty fucking awesome."

I didn't realise how much I'm used to it until I tried to drive with headtracking. I was devastated they cant work together and I couldn't get used to moving the camera with my head.   I'll admit I gave up rather quickly after minimal tinkering with HT setup. I'm lazy and switched back to MCV cause it's familiar and feels natural to me.

Everything is better than spinning out. You'll get the experience soon enough if you're running trucks on martinsville.  And you can practice going at pace car speed and see where you can slam it down.Trucks can start fairly safe in 2nd, so does the B-car, the A-car without experience is better to start in 3rd but warn the guys behind. Just be careful for used tires and starting in the turn."
iRacing,30jfgq,Eburon,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:11:48 2015 UTC,Yea I totally second this. As long as you're not causing wrecks and hanging back 10 secs on restarts you'll be fine. Oh and make sure once you get into higher horsepower cars not to spin the tires on restarts! Trust me it's the worst feeling.
iRacing,30jfgq,Gutsyisland,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:47:54 2015 UTC,"Looking back at the race report the restart was on lap 32 of the race with me at the tail end of the lead lap in 9th place. We restarted and the yellow flag flown then the comments came flying in about how I should be black flagged and shouldn't be on the race track. Looking at he race report the reason for the flag was the number 10, who was running in 3rd at the time. The reason for the flag was stated as ""slow car on track"" guy seem to have been given the cation a few times for that. Looks like I got raged at for a incident that was unrelated to me."

We've all been there, the negative comments are useless; too many people on iRacing respond immediately to things that happen. They will be better off cooling down and bringing it up after the race instead."
iRacing,30jfgq,jdcrozier,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:23:41 2015 UTC,Dragging the brake and adding more throttle right before the start to get your engine RPM up works wonders (at least in the trucks).

iRacing,30je2s,chapstickbomber,3,Fri Mar 27 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to look at race results. Click the big green ""Race Now"" button, and pick a series that uses the Solstice like the Production Car Challenge. Then click the Results link to see what kinds of times people are doing.  Then enter a Practice session and see how your times compare.  iRacing has a weather feature that significantly impacts lap times. So looking at other drivers times from other seasons doesn't really help. You want to know what kinds of times people are doing right now. Which means you need to run the track that they're running this week."

It is a USB f1 style wheel that you hold in your hand, although you can build our buy a mount for it.  It takes some getting used to, but it is easy to travel with.  You operate the gas and brake with your hands although you could still connect pedals.  I use it with my laptop as my rig is packed up and it will be three months until I see it again.  I really miss my triple monitors though.  It is harder to know who is  you in a turn."

It made a huge difference to how easy it was to catch slides. After changing the tire pressures I could almost go completely sideways to the track and still catch a slide before it turns to a spin. Other than that you need to find a setting to the anti-roll bar that suits you. Making it really soft will make the car understeer but it won't spin on you unless you really try"

A friend of mine is on the edge to try it, but I can't in good conscience recommend him to buy a wheel, put some money into the service and be sure he'll have a good time, having kids and all that makes free time precious and it's just a bit too much of a gamble to say that series at that time will have a good experience.   5 NiS races, Daytona whiped, Atlanta black flagged for beating leader to start finish (while I was a carlength behind, was black flagged before I reached the start/finish), Vegas black flagged for passing the leader who made a 180, Phoenix got dropped from the race because of latency (even though I'm have one of the best isp's in Europe), California ddos attack.

I have stopped spending money on my real car and saving for the first consumer release of Vive or the Rift.

So say the full race runs to 100 laps, and there are 5 drivers in the team. An even share for each driver is 20 laps, but the minumum requirement is 25% of this, so 5 laps.

It seems a lot of people are either too busy to check the forum and discover there is a new draft model, or are too stubborn to learn the new methods and are trying to chase cars ahead of them (a la the old drafting model) and can never catch up.  One thing is for certain, I've never seen the penalty for losing the draft be so pronounced as it is now, which is why a lot of folks are reaching way back to their SS @ Charlotte experience and just riding the bottom and never ever trying to make a pass except when the car in front leaves a sliver of daylight. Its been a grind, but when you find someone who is patient and willing to push, or is willing to drop back/lift/drag the brake to help hook up, you can get some massive pushes going."

iRacing,307n2z,BuddyBryan,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:12:10 2015 UTC,It's all caused by the fact that all 3 series have new ways of drafting which is hard to figure out and understand. So people take every inch they can find when they can. Otherwise you go straight to the back and usually lose the draft. There should still be some common sense that its a what 30 lap race? There is plenty of time to work on it no need to over rush.
iRacing,307n2z,kaluh_glarski,2,Wed Mar 25 04:23:49 2015 UTC,I think the real issue is the inside line has several cars at a time swing up a whole lane or two going into the corners and wrecking the guys on the outside.  Too many people stare at the car they are behind instead of looking at the track to figure out where they are so they can hold the line.
iRacing,307n2z,BuddyBryan,1 point,Wed Mar 25 12:31:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is true but to some degree it is very hard to see the track if your actually pushing someone. You also have to think about the fact that if you do become detached, your nose slipping to the left or right of them hooking and turning them into everyone else. Some of that though comes from tire wear. I know in Gen6 last season 10 laps on the high side and you wherent going to pass on the high side come the end of the race, you'd slide straight to the wall. So it's a lot of little things that most people aren't used to or can't figure out which I understand to a degree."
iRacing,307n2z,arsenicfox,2,Wed Mar 25 12:55:58 2015 UTC,"Are you saying the draft model for class C/B/A is different for each, or that its the same across all 3 series, just different than before? I'm having a little bit of trouble sucking up to a car ahead of me if they aren't cooperating/teaming up by dragging the brake or lifting.  Someone mentioned that if you pull half a car width outside a car ahead of you then you pick up a side draft and close the gap, which seems to work about 25% of the time for me."
iRacing,307n2z,Pfunk39,2,Wed Mar 25 15:07:46 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing that all 3 of them are very similar yet different in there own ways with things like side draft. So far Iv had the most luck with the B class or A class cars as far as making a pass goes. The part about sticking half of your nose out to suck up to something I mentioned in another post and Iv noticed people starting to pick up on it some.  One thing I discovered last night in B class, I shouldn't give away the secret but it doesn't always work and you have to have someone commit. But if you are the 3rd place car you can control the whole race and everyone around you. Basically what you do is allow the front two cars to run away. Then back up to 4th place and when the front two stall entering a corner get on the gas as hard as you can and do the side draft trick. It alone can get one car up to speed enough to get a nose ahead of 1st place. So if you are able to stick with your partner my thought is you can rocket past the leaders with no issues and at anytime you feel the need to do so. As 3rd/4th you also have the power to control the rest of the field behind you to some degree."
iRacing,307n2z,papasmurf31,-1,Wed Mar 25 17:53:51 2015 UTC,The new draft model is garbage. People complained about it in the trucks and now that the B cars have a chance it really shows how bad it is. I mean... In a pack most drivers are rarely on the throttle the whole time and with this model u have to or else you'll lose the pack. So people just stomp on the gas and hope for the best.   Theres no patience just pure wrecks. I wouldn't be surprised if There's only a single split by the end of the week. The racing Is worse than CARB CUP!!

iRacing,304gve,speedkinduci,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:58:21 2015 UTC,"Some classes are fixed setup (everyone starts with an identical car and setup), and some are open setup (you're allowed to adjust anything you would on a real car). Nevertheless, in open setup classes you're supplied with a baseline setup for the track that gets you at least close. Depending on the car, the baseline is either pretty close or way off. I usually run the baseline in late models with a few tweaks just because I'm lazy, but advanced legends are usually way off (iirc you can make baseline good on most tracks by fixing camber, stagger, and pressures).  There's a lot of really good guides to setup on the internet. Here's one of my favorites that covers the basics. My biggest suggestion is that you run some practice laps in whatever your preffered car is, adjusting different aspects to learn their effects on the car during entry, apex, and exit. Also it's a really good idea to only make one change at a time so you can isolate variables, and don't just run a lap then change something. I like to run 10+ laps really hard for each change so I can see how the car changes as the tires heat up. Then bring it in and check the inside, middle, and outside temps of each tire. How the car ""feels"" and tire temperatures are your two greatest tools to figure out what the car is doing."

iRacing,306if0,Brapplezz,7,Tue Mar 24 21:44:25 2015 UTC,"Well, good luck. If you're just getting started in karts with F1 dreams, I hope you're no older than about 5 years. If so...well...don't give up your dreams anyway I guess. There's always regional circuits. :)"

iRacing,306if0,AR-47,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:00:29 2015 UTC,"As far as I know unless your getting scouted by age 12, you aren't gonna be an F1 driver.  However, there are a lot of racing series you can get into at an older age."
iRacing,306if0,Tubbzie,10,Thu Mar 26 21:25:52 2015 UTC,"Ignore what 99% of people say in this SubReddit, you'll mainly just get a bunch of miserable pessimists who think unless you're already a racing driver, you'll never be one.  Worst case scenario, you'll have a bucket of fun in the karts. Focus on that, don't focus on getting to F1. If it happens, brilliant. If not? There's other avenues it can lead to."
iRacing,306if0,jrebs,3,Tue Mar 24 23:08:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't say he will never be a racer but that transitioning into a real racing setting for the first time at 16, you are very much against the odds of getting into F1.  You can call it miserable pessimism, I prefer to consider myself a realist. Some people think having big huge grandiose dreams (however unrealistic) are virtuous. That's great if that's what you're into but I don't subscribe to it and think realistic goals are more fruitful because they are attainable. As you said, focus on karts and see what happens from there. That's what I said while also pointing out that almost anyone who makes it into F1 these days was winning national championships by 12 years old. It's a pretty tall ask to have some good runs on iRacing and start talking F1."
iRacing,306if0,chillbrojeff,2,Wed Mar 25 15:12:17 2015 UTC,"Well said. Unless F1 teams are already in contact with you, I think you have a better chance playing the lottery and buying a ride.  With that, getting involved with racing even at a club level can be rewarding and a lot of fun for people of all ages. I suggest looking into karting tracks, and autocross clubs in your area. That's a great way to get started in racing without totally breaking the bank."
iRacing,306if0,Tubbzie,0,Wed Mar 25 17:16:17 2015 UTC,yeah that's my thoughts. If i dont get F1 i'll try to get into atcc because i'm in au
iRacing,306if0,TML_Skidd,3,Tue Mar 24 23:27:17 2015 UTC,"Speaking realistically for a moment, it is incredibly difficult to get into F1 without bringing some kind of money to the table these days. If you have absolute raw talent it's possible to work your way there but you literally need to be on par with maybe the top five drivers in F1 at that time.  I'd say your best bet is to aim for something like ATCC or, as you're in Australia, the V8 Supercar Series - much more achievable."
iRacing,306if0,maeshughes32,2,Tue Mar 24 23:44:34 2015 UTC,Its kinda late now. But you gotta have some kinda racing talent... there's thousands of 16 year old guys who've already been racing karts for 10 years and arent even remotely considered
iRacing,306if0,jaymobe07,2,Wed Mar 25 00:01:23 2015 UTC,Go karts are a blast.  I did a rental league this past season.  We had 22 deep fields.  It was unreal how fun it was.  Even if you end up not going to far with racing you can always do go kart leagues.  I think a lot of areas have adult leagues with driver owned karts.
iRacing,306if0,maeshughes32,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:58:32 2015 UTC,I wish my town still had leagues.  Was a lot funner than showing up on public night since the karts weren't governed in league races
iRacing,306if0,jaymobe07,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:06:33 2015 UTC,Wow that would suck being governed.  The one I do has only one gear but they will get up too about 40mph.  The only downside is there is always a couple karts that are noticeably slower.  I would love to get into a driver owned league but I can't afford that.
iRacing,306if0,RileyF1,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:18:15 2015 UTC,Think they were governed to the public because it was a small oval track.  One race a buddy of mine got nailed and a wheel broke off.  Great memories.
iRacing,306if0,FatalMistake465,2,Fri Mar 27 02:17:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really judge your speed on how much you beat rookies by in iracing but karts are a ton of fun, just don't set your expectations too high."
iRacing,306if0,InZomnia365,2,Wed Mar 25 10:08:03 2015 UTC,"My advice would be don't purely focus on single seaters. The market is shrinking while sportscars and GT racing is growing quickly (and the racing in GTs and prototypes is about ten orders of magnitude more exciting). So at the moment if you're not either one of the worlds best 5 drivers, or represent ""the 1%"", f1 is highly unlikely.  Around the world there are strong club racing series with a range of shall we say, ""customers"". Some may be in their 40's and racing when they've got some time off, and some in their 20's with genuine talent and the backing to go a long way.  I have no idea where you are from but here in the UK there are some series designed to be racing on a budget like the tin tops series. Search ""CSCC Tin Tops"" and there are ford fiesta championships and the like with the BRSCC. They all provide close racing from the events I've seen. I'm even thinking about racing myself!  And who knows? Get a season or two of experience and good results under your belt, and you could be able to go on the hunt for sponsors to move up the ladder to something like ginettas!"
iRacing,306if0,DarkElf12,1 point,Fri Mar 27 01:04:33 2015 UTC,"While GT isnt a ""true"" sim, the ones who end up graduating the GT Academy arent usually the outright quickest in the game. Check out GT Academy Masterclass on the Nismo channel; the training the winners go through, both physical and mental, is insane.  I applaud you for having a goal, though, even as far fetched as it might be."
iRacing,306if0,DarkElf12,-2,Thu Mar 26 02:22:34 2015 UTC,"I dont know what you mean by fakery in AC. AC is more realistic than iRacing with the tyre model. Tyres blister, get flat spots and other stuff that iRacing doesnt have. iRacing is behind in realism as they are trying to make the game playable for everyone and not make the game like real life. For instance it is easier to save a car from a slide in iRacing as all you have to do if slam the brakes on. IRL you would lock the tyres up and still keep spinning. Idk about AC as I havent played it for a while but when I did it was very hard to save the car and just slamming the brakes on didnt stop it."
iRacing,306if0,DarkElf12,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:49:59 2015 UTC,I am not paying you out for this dream but just wondering as to how you think iRacing is more realistic. Its your dream and if you achieve kudos to you
iRacing,306if0,LUK3FAULK,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:50:42 2015 UTC,well i've got over 140 hours clocked on ac so. And what i mean by fakery is the weird feeling that cars get when having no assists on.
iRacing,306if0,DarkElf12,-3,Wed Mar 25 00:20:25 2015 UTC,I am just saying that AC would probably be the best option for realism. iRacing have made the cars easier to drive as they are trying to cater for everybody. rFactor 2 would be the best imo.
iRacing,306if0,LUK3FAULK,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:37:35 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure in the many times I have spun, slamming the breaks locks the tires in iracing."
iRacing,306if0,DarkElf12,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:06:13 2015 UTC,You must be doing something wrong. Everytime I have nearly spun I just slam the brakes hard down and the car comes to a stop in a half spin
iRacing,306if0,LUK3FAULK,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:26:20 2015 UTC,Have you considered AC being the inaccurate one?
iRacing,306if0,DarkElf12,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:41:15 2015 UTC,I am very sure in the fact that iRacing make the game easier for those that dont have the skill to control the car. Look at all of the guys that are fast with controller on iRacing. Of the people that use controller on AC they are 2 to 3 seconds off of guys using wheels.

iRacing,304rok,EyeLuvPC,3,Tue Mar 24 14:03:53 2015 UTC,Something like this happened to me in a skip race at Silverstone. I was on my way to my first win and someone was sideways at the end of turn 1. He's just sitting there so I decide to go wide to avoid him (the easiest thing for me to do). He then backs up to exactly where my line will take me.
iRacing,304rok,AndrewCoja,2,Tue Mar 24 17:10:02 2015 UTC,I would have raged so hard.
iRacing,304rok,GubmentTeatSucker,3,Tue Mar 24 22:06:13 2015 UTC,Personally I would have given them a lot more room than you did just because of the possibility of what happened happening.
iRacing,304rok,Dark-Fx,2,Tue Mar 24 14:46:44 2015 UTC,I should have seen it coming. My big mistake was off throttling which caused me to twitch instead of easing off earlier
iRacing,304rok,Sasken,4,Tue Mar 24 15:03:27 2015 UTC,That's a hard place to change lines. Not much you could do there. I would have steered behind him as well since you normally expect guys to go forward not backward.
iRacing,304rok,the_ocean,2,Tue Mar 24 16:22:27 2015 UTC,"Looks like someone wanted to avoid a 1x and got a 4x. Definitely a protest situation--could have sat where they were and watched the F3 box until they had time. Lime Rock's tough, though, since it's so short. They should have just sucked up the 1x, since they already had a loss of control."
iRacing,304rok,d_ckcissel285,5,Tue Mar 24 14:33:44 2015 UTC,"It wasn't malicious, I wouldn't protest.  It was just stupidity.  Lesson learned, hopefully."
iRacing,304rok,the_ocean,4,Tue Mar 24 15:33:43 2015 UTC,"That's a good outlook. It'll wash out if you just keep racing clean. I'm starting my first season in the Skippy tonight, so I'm sure I'll end up in similar situations... I'll remember not to back up during sessions, though!"
iRacing,304rok,Sasken,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:51:51 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to sit still after a spin. I've been on iRacing for a year and a half and I'm Division 1 on the road with an A 4.x license. But last week at Suzuka I spun in 130R on the first lap then pulled back on the track right in front of a guy (who hit me since there was no way he could get slowed down).  I KNOW not to do that, but in the heat of the moment you sometimes forget and just want to get going again.  If I had sat still and let everybody by I could easily have caught most of them (I was in 3rd place after qualifying 2nd when I spun off and it was the first lap so there was lots of time). But instead I had to pit for repairs due to my mistake. And of course I ruined the other guy's race too.  I've done something like that at least 3 times and each time I tell myself not to do it again, and hopefully this was the last time. But it's really hard to curb the ""red haze"" in a race."
iRacing,304rok,the_ocean,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:21:42 2015 UTC,That's a good point. Best we can do is to keep trying to improve.
iRacing,304rok,Wallykahuna,2,Tue Mar 24 17:16:08 2015 UTC,"You don't have to protest only for malicious driving, you can protest for anything that violates the Sporting Code.  This violated Section 6.10.3 of the SC which was avoidable contact.  Suspensions and banning aren't the only outcomes of successful protests, they also provide coaching on how to act in the future.  In this case if the driver tells him he did something wrong he might not care because the dude just got wrecked, who wouldn't be pissed.  But if Nim sends an email telling the guy that those kinds of actions aren't acceptable and how he should act in the future, his argument has more authority behind it and hopefully the guy will listen.  I have seen people act like complete idiots, get protested and not suspended, but then magically their behavior is completely changes."
iRacing,304rok,Sasken,4,Tue Mar 24 21:48:16 2015 UTC,"What's sad is, you don't get a 1x if you're going slowly. I don't know what the exact number is but I think it's 20 or 30 mph. He could have got going without a 1x and without causing a problem.  A lot of people don't know that there's a lower speed limit on 1x's. For this exact reason.  (Also, there's a cooldown period on incidents. He had the 2x for the spin, and was probably still in the cooldown period so wouldn't have got a 1x regardless)."

iRacing,304rok,Sasken,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:17:02 2015 UTC,"You know, I have no idea. It might just be ""common knowledge"" and not documented anywhere.  iRacing's documentation is definitely lacking. They throw you right into the Sporting Code which has very detailed (and very dry) information about a lot of things you don't need to know (like the Pro series rules, etc.) but doesn't always cover the basics. The training videos are pretty good but I don't know if they cover this or not.  I don't remember where I learned about the ""no 1x's for slow offtracks"" rule. It might have been the forums, it might have been via experience, or it might be in the documentation somewhere.  There really does need to be a simplified user's guide to explain this kind of basic stuff. Even just something like explaining what Week 13 is. Every time Week 13 comes up there are a bunch of ""where did my series go?"" forum posts."

iRacing,304rok,Sasken,3,Tue Mar 24 15:49:41 2015 UTC,It's not fucked up if you know how it works. He wouldn't have got a 1x and if he had known that he wouldn't have reversed. So it's the epitome of iRacing's lack of education (or his inability to learn how the system works).
iRacing,304rok,mav3r1ck92691,2,Tue Mar 24 16:16:10 2015 UTC,"It's penalty system is fine.  Just as much as this guy shouldn't have backed into the track, the OP COULD have avoided it.  I'm not saying it is OP's fault, but the penalty system forces you to think a bit more like real world thinking, where there are penalties like bodily harm and rebuilding a car that make people do their best to avoid things like this."
iRacing,304rok,AndrewCoja,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:23:05 2015 UTC,"The epitome of the other guy not understanding the penalty system. He had a 2x for loss of control.

iRacing,30390y,Hindulaatti,2,Tue Mar 24 16:41:08 2015 UTC,"Your safetyrating is 1.3.  iRating is a different thing than safety rating.  SR measures your safety and you get promoted with this. If you have lots of incidents, you SR goes down. If you drive cleanly, it goes up.  iRating measures your skill and has nothing to do with your promotions. The races are split into different sessions when they have more drivers than the track/series allows. iRating is used to place you in a split where other people have similar iRating so you can get close racing."

iRacing,301nfb,IAmNamedMatt,3,Mon Mar 23 19:27:29 2015 UTC,"I started in January, and if I was doing it over I'd:   Lean how the season schedule works (12 weeks on, 1 week ""off"", one track per week, tracks change Tuesday 12AM GMT). Look up next week's track and start practicing on that one (using ""Test Car on Track"") Once the next week starts, do Time Trial to get some SR points. Mix in some Practice sessions to get a feel for driving around other cars in iRacing Once I got to the point I'm confident I can turn in 25 minutes of racing around other cars without incident, register for a race (don't qualify) Start from the pits in my first several races, to avoid the inevitable corner 1 pileup, and build up SR and IR (if you miss the 1st corner disaster & drive clean you'll likely finish in the top 8). To do this, you enter the race session and wait until the ""Grid (XX)"" counts to 0 and then changes, then get in your car. You'll be about 15 seconds behind the other cars to start, but that's totally fine in Rookie.   If you aren't patient enough, just jump into practice and see what happens. Practice is much more forgiving because it doesn't count for SR. If you hit someone, they'll be annoyed but they'll get over it. If you crash someone out in your first race, you might get protested. If you keep doing it, you might get banned."
iRacing,301nfb,the_ocean,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"I'd add that the ghost drive feature is wonderful and should be used by everyone more often. This way you can see what the real action of a live race is like, drive ""amongst"" the other drivers. Your car is invisible to everyone else, it will ghost through everyone else's car.  From the menu: Find Official Races -> Watch / Ghost / Crew / Spot"

iRacing,301nfb,Fuzzwah,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:04:08 2015 UTC,Ghost racing has no effect on iRating or Safety Rating.
iRacing,301nfb,sim-racingcouk,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:07:56 2015 UTC,So is it the best way to practice or prepare to race in the fture?
iRacing,301nfb,jrebs,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:36:52 2015 UTC,"Probably not the best, just due to the fact that it's a ghost and so it doesn't simulate contact.  The best thing to do in my opinion is head to a practice session.  Look at the timing boards and see who is slightly quicker than you.  Go out and follow them, see if you can keep up, maybe learn where they are making time and if you catch the draft see if you can stay with them and then make a safe overtake if the opportunity presents itself.  I would then try to get out infront of said driver (not straight out of the pits, as this would ruin a fast lap of theirs) knowing they are a little quicker and see if you can run a defensive line and keep them behind.  If in any of these exercises you have contact with the other driver, study the replay to see whose fault it was and also what can be learnt from the incident, so it doesn't happen in the future.  If it was your fault apologise.  If it was a close incident, ask them if you were too aggressive, it's all about learning and even if you've been doing it for ages, there is always something to learn."
iRacing,301nfb,sim-racingcouk,3,Tue Mar 24 01:06:47 2015 UTC,"You should practice for as long as it takes that you can do 25 minutes in the MX5 without any serious trouble. Then take it to the track to work on racecraft. Hotlapping around in AC is one thing, but going wheel to wheel for championship points is something else entirely. Do your part to make sure you're comfortable in the car and won't be a risk to others and then have at 'er. The sooner you start racing, the sooner you'll get an idea of where you belong. The iRating system is designed to put you up against fair competition, and the more active a series is the more effective this system is. It could take winning (or losing badly) in a few races for your iRating to start to level out at the appropriate place but it will do."
iRacing,301nfb,Eburon,3,Mon Mar 23 19:31:47 2015 UTC,"You should practice for as long as it takes that you can do 25 minutes in the MX5 without any serious trouble. Then take it to the track to work on racecraft.   Great advice.  Don't worry about speed, worry about race craft."
iRacing,301nfb,Eburon,2,Mon Mar 23 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"don't be intimidated, you need to be something really special to beat some of the idiot drivers out there.  You will crash other people and other people will crash you, you'll get yelled at, and you'll do the yelling. It's racing, tempers will flare.  Just go in practice untill you can pull of consistent laps, they don't have to be fast, just see that you have control over your car at any point on the track so you can let the faster cars pass you  safely.  There is always the option to ghost race in an ongoing race, join as a spectator and see how it feels, you'll clip through other cars but draft does work.  Way to go is:  Offline practice: Get to know the track, untill you're able to drive at 90% cleanly online practice: join other players in practice, try not to wreck them, but don't worry too much about it if you do. You'll see soon enough how much you're off the pace, and when you think you can handle the race.  Before you race, make sure you know how to exit the pit within regulations. See if it's a rolling start or a standing start and what rules go along whit them. Practice starting conditions, run at pacecar speed and see in what gear you're able to start without spinning out.   You can always start from the pit, and many suggest it, but I would advise against it. You won't learn much by doing that, getting comfortable in a big pack is essential. Do it only when you know it's a wreckfest and you're in the middle of the pack. The front and the last two rows are the safest in my experience, the middle can be hell.   Also wait to qualify, because if you do and you're not fast, you'll end up in the middle with fast drivers who didn't bother to qualify behind you.  For oval racing: make sure you're set up to start in second place, for people who don't use headtracking, oculus or a three monitor setup it's really hard to see the guy in pole and when he goes. Make sure your look left key is bound.  And one important point, make sure your field of view is setup correctly. If you set it too high, everything will appear to move faster towards you making it harder to avoid crashes or steer in precisely.   So to summarize, don't be a dick and have fun."
iRacing,301nfb,eobet,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:53:19 2015 UTC,Yeah about fov. I have it set to 65 but in assetto corsa I run 45 because in iracing anything below 60 made me feel sick it was so low!
iRacing,301nfb,Lryder2k6,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:56:24 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, you might want to use the calculator in the options. In theory there's only one right setting for your setup. I had to elevate my screen a bit and move it as close as possible towards me to get it right."
iRacing,301nfb,Eburon,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:09:44 2015 UTC,"One game uses vertical fov and the other horizontal, hence why the numbers don't translate.  If you have head tracking, set it so that the world appears life sized to you. Otherwise, just go with what feels as big as possible without hampering your peripheral vision too much.  Oh, and as for racing, what most people miss out on in iRacing is that trying to avoid other people is what most often cause you to spin off the track. Cars become very unstable outside of the main line in iRacing, and it's really easy for an inexperienced player to brake to avoid someone and then try to take the corner as normal despite having completely shifted the weight of the car, causing them to spin."
iRacing,301nfb,Hindulaatti,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:18:38 2015 UTC,Assetto Corsa uses vertical FOV IIRC.  A setting of 97 in iRacing should be equivalent to 65 in AC.  That is insanely high if you're running a single monitor though.  Having a lower FOV gives you a more realistic idea of the shape of corners and lets you judge elevation changes better.  I run an FOV of 65 in iRacing on a 24 inch monitor which seems to be a good balance of the advantages of a lower FOV without harming situational awareness.
iRacing,301nfb,the_ocean,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:17:49 2015 UTC,Ok I had it set to the same thing. 45 in AC and 65 in IR

In my rookie experience I was always able to avoid the 1st corner wrecks because I started in 11/12 every time. If you can be pretty sure you'll be 11/12, definitely grid so you get a feel for it. But if you're somewhere around 4-10, I'd start from the pits. That's particularly the case on Lime Rock, Charlotte and Okayama, which have tight first corners relatively close to the start."

iRacing,2zwryt,GrantH527,2,Mon Mar 23 01:49:12 2015 UTC,Any insight on that?
iRacing,2zwryt,MirzaThreeletovic,2,Mon Mar 23 03:12:47 2015 UTC,"I'd have to look but I know I run a decent amount of minforce. Slides cause the wheel to ""remove"" force in order to gather the additional information, such as bumps, and cause the wheel to instantly feel lighter. It's odd because it's the exact opposite the wheel ""should"" feel, but due to the lack of seat feel, creates an odd sensation.   I'd say I setup my wheel close to how assetto corsa feels. Never get clipping and it's still bumpy as heck. The only downfall is the motors run hot and probably wear faster.   Edracing.com had a good guide about it. I modified mine off that using it as a base. Honestly was luck where I got it to, but was cool to get a heavy wheel with defined bumps. Have no idea how I got what I did lol.   Edit: an example of that ""loss of force in slides"" would be like in the KIA that emptybox passed me in his latest video. Going up that turn I always got wheel spin going too hard on the accelerator. I noticed every time I did that, the bumps in the track were gone, replaced with dead ffb. Best you can do with low end wheels."

iRacing,2zuuiv,mcfly_intheointment,-2,Sun Mar 22 03:59:19 2015 UTC,"I'd advise you to go for a DFGT or Black Momo instead. The black momo can easily be found for $100 or less, the Dfgt less so.  The G27 is only worth it f you can find it for $150 or less, because if you want to spend above $150, you would be way better off getting the Fanatec 911 gt3 wheel for $175, or the pedal+911 wheel bundle for $225.  G27 for >$150 is too expensive when there are cheap belt driven options out there.  Besides, you shouldn't even spend that much on your first wheel anyways. Get a Momo or Dfgt for $100 or less and use that for awhile, they're great wheels.  Edit: People downvoting me because the G27 hype is too stronk, you're not supposed to downvote things you don't like. To make it easier for you to understand the G27 is outmoded, I made a list.  G27 for $234 on Amazon   Reliability Shifter (mediocre quality) Potentially slightly quicker response on FFB as opposed to earlier belt wheels like the 911, though this is just anecdotal reports I have heard and is not supported by any evidence I have so far seen. Added buttons from the shifter.   911 GT3 + CSR Pedal value bundle for $230   Much better build quality on the wheel and pedals Much, much newer design (the G27 is directly based on the G25 which is 8 years old now) 2 more easily accessible-buttons on the wheel, as opposed to the 6 on the G27. Far superior FFB due to belt-driven design, creating smoother, and stronger force compared to the G27 contributing to a vastly more realistic and immersive experience. Slightly cheaper than the G27's Amazon list price, though shipping costs will likely make it marginally more expensive in the end. Style (if you're into the Porsche branding)   The G27 is not a bad wheel, but it is not the best choice for either new players or enthusiasts anymore. This may have been true 5 years ago, but the market and technology available have changed and the popular conception has not kept up. For new players, there are far cheaper, but comparable, gear-based wheels that will be much better fits. At the same time, it cannot match the high-quality feel and FFB of enthusiast-grade belt-driven wheels offered in the $200-$300 bracket like the 911 GT3 or Thrustmaster TX. Want a cheap beginner wheel? G27 isn't the best option. Want to upgrade to a mid-range enthusiast grade wheel? Again, there are much better options with comparable pricing."
iRacing,2zuuiv,SgtMustang,0,Sun Mar 22 02:32:38 2015 UTC,"While you say the GT3 is better than the g27 I am sure 90% of the community will disagree with you. For one the G27 comes with pedals, shifter, paddles and a small button box (buttons attached to shifter). The GT3 just comes with the wheel and paddle shifter. The GT3 wheel is $50 less than a new G27 from a Logitech reseller on eBay but on eBay that reseller has sales and I have seen the G27 as low as $229. Plus to race properly with the GT3 you nee to spend another $100+ on some pedals and your still dont have a shifter like the G27. Tbh the G27 wins hands down in my opinion"
iRacing,2zuuiv,DarkElf12,0,Mon Mar 23 23:17:37 2015 UTC,"Let me address these one at a time.   I am sure 90% of the community will disagree with you.   Beyond the blatant [citation needed], this is just straight up bandwagoning. You cannot argue that because the majority of people like something that inherently proves that it is better. This is a common trend in human history.   For one the G27 comes with pedals, shifter, paddles and a small button box (buttons attached to shifter).   G27 (Wheel, Pedals, Paddles, Shifter) - $234  911 GT3 Bundle (Wheel, Pedals, Paddles - Paddles shouldn't be considered a feature, practically every wheel has them) $230!    I have seen the G27 as low as $229   So, exactly the same price as the 911 GT3 Pedal bundle?  Onto the shifter unit. The G27's shifter unit is toyish and nobody in their right mind would consider it high-quality. Adequate, yes, but highly realistic or immersive? Hardly. If you want a really decent shifter unit you're looking at Fanatec or Thrustmaster's TH8 or Clubsport offerings for $100+.  Besides, shifter units are easily the least important of the three main components of a setup (Wheel, pedals, shifter). Shifters are less competitive than paddles, and their only real benefit is a slight increase in immersion, and the junk shifter the G27 comes with is not immersive. Top racers prefer paddles because they are actuated far quicker than shifters, and don't require letting go of the wheel.  The added buttons are also only a minor point, as the 911 GT3 has more buttons on the actual wheel than the G27 (8 in easy reach, 2 more than the G27). You're not going to be spamming commands on the shifter unit, like Commander Data on the Enterprise, while in the middle of a race. So while the G27 might get the slight edge in total buttons, most of them are not usable in a hectic race regardless, giving the GT3 the edge in total easily-accessible buttons.  The G27's shifter really shouldn't be touted as the tipping point to buy the G27, not when buying the G27 means throwing out the baby with the bathwater by reducing the quality and usability of the most important parts, the wheel and pedals, in comparison with the GT3 pedal bundle.   So lets line up the advantages for both products.  G27 for $234 on Amazon    Reliability Shifter (mediocre quality) Potentially slightly quicker response on FFB as opposed to earlier belt wheels like the 911, though this is just anecdotal reports I have heard and is not supported by any evidence I have so far seen. Added buttons from the shifter.   911 GT3 + CSR Pedal value bundle ($230)   Much better build quality on the wheel and pedals Much, much newer design (the G27 is directly based on the G25 which is 8 years old now) 2 more easily accessible-buttons on the wheel, as opposed to the 6 on the G27. Far superior FFB due to belt-driven design, creating smoother, and stronger force compared to the G27 contributing to a vastly more realistic and immersive experience. Slightly cheaper than the G27's Amazon list price, though shipping costs will likely make it marginally more expensive in the end. Style (if you're into the Porsche branding)   So in essence, by buying the G27, you're trading quality and realism on the most important parts of the setup, your wheel and pedals, for the addition of a relatively unimportant, mediocre shifter, a few extra buttons, and perhaps better reliability (Fanatec has customer support to mediate issues in this regard...). Where do your priorities lay?  Purchasing the G27 in this day and age when there is little objective reason to do so is highly illogical."
iRacing,2zuuiv,SgtMustang,2,Tue Mar 24 00:23:28 2015 UTC,I dont know what currency your using but a GT3 bundle costs $249 25 more than what I got the G27 from an authorised Logitech reseller. The G27 has a larger community and therefore greater support for its users. You seem to be bashing the G27 and not looking at the bad sides of the GT3. Yes it is a bit cheap but it works well and is probably the most reliable wheel being sold at the moment for the length of time that it can last compared to others. I dont think that the GT3 can compete with that. New users should be sacrificing realistic feelings for life span.
iRacing,2zuuiv,DarkElf12,1 point,Tue Mar 24 03:09:34 2015 UTC,"I can only tell you that from the North American Fanatec portal the 911 GT3 is clearly listed @ $230, but even then, $20 does not make or break the deal for something that already costs $200.   bad sides of the GT3   The fact is there are not many. Reliability is the prime concern with belt-driven wheels, but they are a discrete upgrade from gears, much like CDs were a discrete upgrade from tapes, there is little reason to use a tape when CDs exist at similar prices. And by now, most of the kinks have been worked out with the 911 and on the whole they are well made and won't fail. Even if they do, customer support exists to mediate this.  The only flaw you could find other than reliability is that the buttons on the 911 feel plastic-y, but this is still fairly minor, and a lot of preference too. Buttons are secondary to the feel of the wheel itself.   most reliable wheel being sold at the moment for the length of time that it can last compared to others   I think it's fair to say all gear based wheels will last about the same amount of time. A Momo, DFGT, and G27 are all similar to each other and which one fails first will probably depend on the habits of the user, rather than the individual product itself. I've had a Momo for 8 years and it hasn't caused me any problems. Gears are gears, and the G27 will not perform drastically differently than the Momo or DFGT, even if it is marginally higher-quality, just like a Ford drives pretty much the same as a Lincoln or Cadillac, despite being in a slightly lower market range, it may just be slightly less refined.    New users should be sacrificing realistic feelings for life span.    Agreed, but like I said, I do not think the G27 is the wheel to go for in this case. If you are a new user and want a reliable wheel, why even bother spending over $200 on a G27, when you could spend $100 or less on a Momo or DFGT, which perform all the same functions and fulfill all the needs of a new user?  The G27 is not a bad wheel, but it is not the best choice for either new players or enthusiasts anymore. This may have been true 5 years ago, but the market and technology available have changed and the popular conception has not kept up.

iRacing,2zsz72,DeathHaze420,3,Sat Mar 21 14:48:54 2015 UTC,"In general, oval racing is a lot worse than Road. If it's because ovals tend to have closer packs, if oval is harder or if oval racers are just worse, I can't say. The elitist F1>NASCAR bastard in me would probably say the latter though ;) but realistically, I think it's number one. Oval racing just leaves a really small room for error and a lot of people let their urge to win take the upper hand of their ability to race cleanly. As a lot of people probably have said though, it will improve as you get to higher splits. Take a look on YouTube for some A class top split races and you'll see you get maybe one or two cautions in a long race."

And remember that there's still Rookies who might have gotten out of rookie by starting in pits and just getting SR. And some guys may have only got to D Class through Charlotte (just like Daytona) and not USA but they might be used to using brakes :P.   Not to mention that the National car is a lot different than the Street Stock with a lot more power and very easy to spin if you accelerate too early (which is why guys are spinning in the first place). So no, I'm not surprised there are incidents. You kind of have to expect incidents in the first corner!  And I disagree the racing is cleaner as you move up.

iRacing,2zsz72,Robot_Seizure,3,Sun Mar 22 14:14:49 2015 UTC,I like to attribute good racing more to irating than to Safety Rating. Anyone can get to A license driving carefully and slow.

iRacing,2zsz72,pleaseexcusemytpyos,2,Sat Mar 21 15:51:47 2015 UTC,This is the answer. The racing gets better the higher your irating gets. I still race in the Skippy despite having an A license and with a higher rating you will get into better splits and the driving really improves. Once you get into the top split you can be pretty confident around the other folks.

iRacing,2zra31,ChristPanda,6,Sat Mar 21 00:01:26 2015 UTC,"The biggest question is: How committed is he, and what is his price range?  With wheels, there are a few things to take into account. There are two methods of driving force feedback: gears, and belts.    Gears are relatively old technology. They are simple, reliable, and cheap, but provide a low-fi FFB experience. The teeth in the gears are very distinct in the feedback you get: as you turn the wheel, you will get a strong vibration as the gears mesh together. Gears also have rather limited strength in the FFB, even cranked up they aren't very strong. Gears also have gaps in their force feedback where you will not get any response whatsoever, often times this is the middle.  Belt driven wheels are a much newer and more advanced design. They really emerged only in the last 3 or 4 years in significant quantities. Belts have smooth, analog-like feedback compared to the ratchety, noisy operation of gear based wheels. They have much stronger, and much more realistic FFB. Their only cons are price, and reliability, and in the case of the early belt-driven wheels, there was some noticeable lag on the FFB. Being more complex, they may have more reliability issues, but in the vast majority of cases, they won't have any problems. Otherwise, belts are wholly superior to gear based wheels. The wheels' response will be much smoother, and much more enjoyable overall.   I have done significant research on all the major wheels available today. And if you want to go cheap, the Black Momo or DFGT are your best choices. If you are going gear based, stick to $100 or less if possible. Any more, and you should really just skip right to belt-driven wheels. The Black Momo is not considered a ""desirable"" wheel, and they are plentiful. Thus, it's easy to find them cheaply; I have seen them as low as $50. I'd say amongst cheap gear wheels, the Momo is probably your best bet. I have had one for almost a decade now and it's holding up well, and I have no problems doing well in iRacing with it, despite its low steering lock. It does everything you need it to as a beginner, and is built pretty well.  The DFGT is very similar mechanically to the Momo, the most notable difference being that it has 900 degrees of rotation, and does not have shifter paddles like the Momo. It only has buttons. However, the DFGT has a strong reputation and is in high demand, and since it has been discontinued, the price is quite high. It is possible to find them for $100 on Craigslist or other private sellers, but even the cheapest used on Amazon is $150. If you can find a DFGT for $100, I would go for it, but I wouldn't pay any more for one for a few reasons.  Finally, the one people always seem to recommend, the G27. At the time of its release, the G27 was one of the better wheels available on the market, and it was great value. However, fastforward to modern day, the G27 is about 5 years old, and its almost identical predecessor, the G25, is 8 years old. In the interim since its release, belt-driven wheels have begun mass-production and their prices have gone down significantly, and now belt-driven wheels price-match the G27, and significantly outperform it as far as FFB goes.  The G27 was, and still is a great wheel, but it is an old design and there are much better options now. And at the end of the day, being gear-driven, it plays by the same rules, and has the same characteristics as the far cheaper Momo and DFGT, although it is slightly more refined. This means that the G27 isn't really that great of a contender in the current market anymore at its list price. Gears are only advantageous for their price, and the G27's relatively high cost undermines this. If you can find a G27 for $150 or less, then you would have a great deal, but do not pay $200 or more for one, because at that point you really should be getting the Fanatec 911 GT3 + CS pedal bundle for $225 or so, or just going all the way to the Thrustmaster TX (which also comes with pedals) for $300. Both are significant upgrades from the G27.  Here are some links: the ""Black"" MOMO Racing, Driving Force GT, and Logitech G25/G27.  The 911 GT3 + pedal bundle can be found here for $230, $4 less than the G27 is selling for on Amazon right now. It is quite a big step up from the G27, but it is one of the older mass-produced Belt-driven wheels on the market, so it won't be as refined as the much newer model, the Thrustmaster TX, is.  The TX is the new kid on the block and combines one of the best ""bases"" (basically the entire housing with the motor and belts inside, everything but the wheel, in essence) on the market, with a really low price. It's listed at $300, but you could probably find it on Craigslist or Ebay for less, or you could wait for an official sale on Amazon or some other retailer. The TX is by far the best value for your money now as far as wheel quality goes, it is only $66 more expensive than the G27 at list price, but you will get a drastically better driving experience with it. The TX's FFB is the best in the sub $500 market. As far as value goes, I would recommend the TX wholeheartedly. Users who have upgraded from the G27 to the TX have talked about a ""drastic improvement"" in quality, I can provide links if you would like.   The main criticism of the TX is the lack of clutch pedal and general low quality pedals. A ""progressive brake"" mod has been created for the TX pedals which gives them a great, much more realistic feel, and makes them a decent set of pedals. This mod is DIY and can be done for $10. Once the mod is performed, the TX package is pretty strong overall. You get a decent progressive brake with some of the best FFB on the market for $300 or less, what more do you want?  If you want to see a video of the TX in action and an indepth review, check out this video.  I know this was a long post, but I wanted to encompass the current state of the wheel market as completely as I could.   In summary:  The only remaining selling point of gear-driven wheels is price, and even then the gap is shrinking rapidly. If you are looking to spend $150 or under, get a gear based wheel. Ideally, a Black Momo or Driving Force GT. If you can find a Logitech G27 for $150 or less, go for it, however, do not spend more than $150 on a gear based wheel.   We're at that awkward phase where the new tech has arrived and is becoming readily available, but the old tech hasn't had time to compensate by dropping prices, sort of like video tapes and DVD's being sold simultaneously. A DVD player would only be marginally more expensive, but provides a significantly upgraded experience from VHS.  Belt driven wheels are superior in every way other than price, and perhaps, reliability. If you are looking to spend more than $150, go for the Fanatec 911 GT3 for $175, and optionally the 911 GT3 + pedal bundle for $230. If you are looking at +$250, go for a Thrustmaster TX for $300.   I hope you found this helpful! Feel free to respond or PM me if you have any other questions. I'm quite familiar with most of the hardware on the market today."
iRacing,2zra31,SgtMustang,3,Sat Mar 21 09:55:49 2015 UTC,not recommenced with a controller.  its pretty difficult to get any real racing in with a controller.  g27 is gonna be the best bang for your buck.

Consider that the more enjoyable and immersive your brothers first sim experience the more likely he'll be reeled into it hook line and sinker. ;)
iRacing,2zra31,tsb101,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:12:14 2015 UTC,"A DFGT is a perfect entry level wheel, but if you can buy a used G25/G27 for a bit more I would definitely say go for it. The Logitech wheels are a bit old compared to the market today like Thrustmaster, Fanatec and all those aftermarket wheels, but they are reliable and a good product.   You need a wheel to succeed and enjoy this sim."

iRacing,2zra31,lagatron,1 point,Sat Mar 21 14:12:56 2015 UTC,"This might come off as a weird suggestion considering the subreddit we're in, but I'd recommend saving up on software and buying good hardware - buy a G27 and something like Assetto Corsa or Stock Car Extreme (AC gets really cheap during Steam sales). Let him play these hotlap sims (both are excellent in terms of physics and content) for a while and he'll see if sim racing is for him.   Thing is, if he has never driven a sim before he won't fully enjoy iRacing and he'll end up paying lots of money for a service he won't be able to fully enjoy. In AC or SCE, for a much lower amount he'll get to familiarize himself with the basics of racing, racing lines, shifting, oversteer, understeer, GT cars, open wheelers and what not. Once he does manage to wrap his mind around how a sim works, he'll be ready for iRacing and the competition it brings.   tl;dr Spending a lot of money on iRacing as a first sim racing experience is kinda redudant. Get an ""offline"" sim - AC or SCE."
iRacing,2zofdd,keem85,12,Fri Mar 20 07:35:02 2015 UTC,"you have every right to defend your position but use a bit of judgement in the matter. if someone catches you from 5 seconds back and there is still half a race to go don't defend to much but if there is only one lap left then the race is one.  if you are a lapped car make it so leading drivers can pass as easy as possible usually on the straights, on that a good rule of thumb to let them pass early on the straight so you can draft them and not mess up the next corner  and who the heck downvoted this, this guy has a genuine question of which is of good value to a lot of people"

But you're right a lot of this material is covered in driving school."
iRacing,2zofdd,LewisKiniski,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:04:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but sometimes I need to ask questions directly I'm order to understand. I didn't get all these questions properly covered and sometimes I don't understand an explanation if it's complicated. English is not my native language. For example I had no idea what lapping was, because I thought that it was related to a speeding car, an not that it had actually run me down by one lap.. So instead of wondering about these questions, I ask them here."
iRacing,2zofdd,LewisKiniski,13,Sun Mar 22 12:59:17 2015 UTC,"I am under the impression that if a driver behind you drives faster than you, that you should position yourself in a way.. I don't know where. Left or right?   Depends on what's going on.  If you're racing for position and want to defend, you can preemptively (not reactively) position your car in your desired line when approaching a corner - generally the inside line (especially on road courses).  There are times where you may want to be on the outside though (e.g. one of the NASCAR series @ Las Vegas).  Basically, you force the faster driver to take the suboptimal route around you hoping to nullify their speed advantage w/good positioning.  If you're being lapped (by anyone, not just the leader) - consider facilitating a pass.  There are times that it is appropriate to race them hard (e.g. the leader has caught you in an oval race and you're trying to stay on the lead lap), and times where you need to gtfo of the way.  Generally speaking, if you're being lapped on a road course w/o full-course cautions (all strategy being equal - you didn't just pit for example) - get out of the way.  The leaders are simply more important than you if you're being lapped.  Here's a few situations and examples of what I'd do - you can decide for yourself if it's what you'd do:   Leaders are in a close battle and closing in.  I'd find a safe spot to let them all by at once, tell them where to go, and pull way out of the racing line.  I do this regardless of my personal situation (e.g. racing someone for position).  I try to make sure that the pass happens as easily for all the leaders concerned, b/c letting the leader by in the middle of a straight and then messing up the next car's entry to the next corner is a dick move.  Try to have no effect on the higher-lap battle if possible.  That said, you need to affect the lapping car's lap as little as possible, regardless as to their position relative to people they're racing against.  You may not be aware of their situation.  For example, they could be really making time on someone through turns 6-8 (say 3-4 tenths a lap) and have barely enough laps to catch them.  Fucking them over in the part of the track they need to make time could seriously affect their finishing position. Leaders are significantly faster.  I mean, if you're damaged, inexperienced, or otherwise basically a rolling roadblock to people and have no real means of racing them - get out of the way as described above. You're racing or running someone down for position and one car a lap ahead is approaching you.  I'd drive normally (perhaps with more emphasis on safety), but once the lapping car gets position, I'd roll out of the gas enough to let them by.  This minimizes the time I lose, and shouldn't interfere w/the lapping car.   Note:  it may also be to your benefit to allow even same-lap cars by.  For example, there's ten laps to go in a 20-lap race, and you're in fourth.  Fifth place has gained 1s per lap on you for the last five laps and is right behind you.  Sixth and seventh are also running you down at that pace, but are still 10s back.  In this situation, you're unlikely to be able to hold of fifth place for ten laps (@ 1s per lap he's way faster than you are), and holding him off for even one lap will slow you both down - in order to hold him off, you will need to position your car defensively, which is most likely not the fastest way around the track.  Your best chance of holding off the sixth and seventh place cars is to let fifth by easily rather than forefiting additional time attempting to defend a position you aren't going to keep anyway.  Surrendering fourth for a better shot at fifth isn't a sissy move - it's a smart one.  If it's the same situation and there's two or three laps left?  Try to keep fourth as hard as possible.     How does drafting work and when should one use it?   This is an easier topic to research so I'll let you do some of that yourself.  Plus already some of the answers are more than adequate.  Simple answer is two cars in a line share reduced drag, and reduced drag is good.     When is it OK to pass a player and when is it not?   Similar to the position defense response:  depends on the situation.  Just use your head.  If you're a lap behind and aren't going to catch someone for position but the guy ahead of you is slower, don't interfere with his race.  Just cruise along behind him.  As for passing etiquette, refer to driving school:   Road:  if the passing car is alongside (note:  alongside is not a nose to the rear fender) the leading car should yield the racing line in the next corner.  Otherwise, the racing line belongs to the leading car. Oval:  you're generally not supposed to turn down on another car regardless as to how far alongside it is.   Things to note:   Being alongside a car going into a corner is a little ambiguous, but I take it as being beyond front wheel to rear wheel (basically have your nose halfway up the length of his car) approaching a braking zone.  If the leading car simply slides up a little mid-corner and a second apex is coming, putting your nose inside them isn't very smart.  If they slide up a lot and you can get alongside - it's your call. Exactly what divebombing is is also a little ambiguous and people disagree about it all the time.  I think the ""approaching a braking zone"" part above is really important.  If you're not alongside and the leading car enters the braking zone reasonably (e.g. isn't braking unnecessarily early) and you just drive it there inside him - it's a divebomb.  The leading car has every right to drive his corner the way he wants to.  Just because your braking point and his are different, doesn't mean he's braking early - it just means that they're different.  So I think it's all about preparation really.  If the leading car has already entered the braking zone and has to change the way they were going to drive the corner (which is really fucking hard - e.g. they were going to take the racing line but now they need to change line and avoid you), you've fucked up.  This contrasts their knowing you're beside them and are already planning on taking the sub-optimal line.      What is a fast lap (can't remember if it's called that). I had the impression that if I'm the slower car, I should not get in the way of the person having a fast lap or something like that.   A purple lap/sector in motorsport is the fastest lap/sector of a session across all drivers.  I think in iRacing, it's just your fastest lap/sector (I think that's a green lap generally).  I think what you're talking about here (or heard someone say) is a hot-lap.  If I'm right, this is referring to qualifying, when a person is on a timed lap, and you're say, leaving the pits.  Gtfo of that guy's way.  Nothing is more infuriating than working hard to get a good run coming to the pit straight, being in the green for the first corner/set of corners and having some dickbag leaving the pits fuck up your timed lap by screwing up a corner entry and burning your lap.  I've not keyed the mic to yell at people that often, but every time this happens I lose my shit.  If you're leaving the pits, have had an offtrack (disqualifying your lap), or are just way slower than someone approaching you on a hot-lap - please have some courtesy and get out of the way.    If you think of anything else, don't hesitate to pm me or add me on iRacing.  I also stream pretty much daily (EDT) and can give you the details.  If anyone disagrees w/anything here (and I'm sure someone does) - please reply.  More information is better."

iRacing,2zofdd,kherven,5,Sun Mar 22 12:16:25 2015 UTC,"The 1 most important rule is: AVOID COLLISIONS   If you want to defend a corner you can use the inside line.   Drafting works whenever you are behind a car using it to cut through the wind instead of using your own car to cut through the wind. Use it whenever you can pretty much. but be careful because you will need a slighty bigger brake zone if you draft on a long straight.  When someone is lapping you, you should move over for them (that is when you are being shown the blue flag) otherwise, it is racing and you have no obligation to move over.  read about the iracing notes on the forums on iracing.com  General rule? how about a general advice?... Races are not won on the first corner, but are often lost there.  Just be careful on the first lap because that is when most incidents happen!"
iRacing,2zofdd,Kubi74,2,Fri Mar 20 08:01:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Really good answers here.. Could you specify the ""lapping"" part more? What is it that determines wether a person is lapping me or not?"
iRacing,2zofdd,Kubi74,2,Fri Mar 20 08:04:59 2015 UTC,"To speak more game mechanically about the issue, your ""Relative"" (F3) should be open during a race. This gives you information about the drivers relative to you. Names will be displayed in 3 colors.    White. these drivers are on the same lap as you. You are competing against them.  Blue. These are drivers you have lapped, in other words, you are at least one lap ahead of them. They should yield to you. Red. These are drivers that have lapped you. You should yield to them when safe and possible."
iRacing,2zofdd,RileyF1,1 point,Fri Mar 20 20:05:00 2015 UTC,"If he is so fast that he has gone around the track once and now he is catching you up. that means he is lapping you. IE... 1 full lap length faster than you at this point.   This normally happens when first place is catching up to 20th place at the later laps of the race. In this case 20th place (last) will be shown the blue flag, and it is the responsibility of the person in last position to let the person in first position through by staying off the racing line. Never fight them.  It is especially important to not interfere with the lappers if they are still fighting for position. (example: 1st, second and 3rd position all still fighting for the race win. and now they are catching up to the back of the pack) they all must be let through with minimal interference as to not affect the race result."
iRacing,2zofdd,trackday,1 point,Fri Mar 20 08:17:20 2015 UTC,"Ahh! That explains it! I always worried about that when catching up on the last man, fearing that he will interfere.. Somehow they always let me through. That explains everything about that for me, thanks"
iRacing,2zofdd,RileyF1,1 point,Fri Mar 20 08:24:58 2015 UTC,Awesome! everything explained here is accurate for iracing and the irl track. if you like racing and have never been on a real track you are doing yourself a disservice!
iRacing,2zofdd,Daftmac,2,Fri Mar 20 09:07:23 2015 UTC,"Usually if someone is coming up to behind you and they have a shot of passing into the next corner, you position the car in a way so that they won't be able to pass you, simple as that. Usually you put your car on the inside so they'd have to go the long way round you but it depends entirely on the corner, sometimes sticking to the outside is more effective. It also depends what is after the upcoming corner because maybe you'd be able to pass them back easily afterwards."
iRacing,2zofdd,Execrat0r,1 point,Fri Mar 20 11:29:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. I remember doing that when I was a rookie.. At the first corner in lime park I positioned myself on the outside, so that I got more momentum to pass him after the corner."
iRacing,2zofdd,trackday,1 point,Fri Mar 20 11:33:39 2015 UTC,"But outright blocking is illegal.  Block once toward the end of the race if you have to, but that's about it."
iRacing,2zofdd,trackday,3,Fri Mar 20 11:44:06 2015 UTC,depends what you mean by blocking
iRacing,2zofdd,tstraw48,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:28:06 2015 UTC,"I would say that most blocking instances occur in a straight, where the car behind gets a much better exit than the car in front, and the car in front weaves from side to side preventing the faster car from making what should be an easy pass on the straight.  Personally, I abide by Formula 1 rule for blocking, which is you can only move to one side to block once. If the faster car can still make the pass on the other side, then the position is just outright theirs."
iRacing,2zofdd,doveenigma13,2,Fri Mar 20 22:56:08 2015 UTC,Hogging the inside line ≠ blocking.

I got a chance to race the C class sprint cup race at Daytona before it crashed, and we only had two yellows. One at the beginning from the ""chumps"" driving hard to the front and couldn't hold it, and the other was two laps from the finish from people driving hard to finish hot and crashed out.  Just knowing you have 150 laps rather than 40 makes a big difference with how careful people drive."

I moved to D class national on Gateway for the reminder of the week and actually had some fun races and got my irating back up by about 150 points.

iRacing,2zrf91,Itsjorgehernandez,5,Sat Mar 21 00:48:24 2015 UTC,There's not really a lot iRacing can do short of switching their data center which isn't exactly something you can do on impulse.
iRacing,2zrf91,Vulfilla,6,Sat Mar 21 00:51:42 2015 UTC,"Apparently, they are already partnered with some serious anti-DDoS services etc. Theyre doing more to prevent it than your regular games company are (no wonder, considering its a paid always-online service).  That said, there just isnt a whole lot to do to prevent DDoS attacks. In its simplest form, its just a massive amount of traffic. Ive heard iRacing say that its even more difficult for them, because their normal traffic looks a lot like DDoS attacks to begin with, which makes it hard to monitor and stop (not that I completely understand what they mean with that)."
iRacing,2zrf91,InZomnia365,3,Sat Mar 21 00:55:01 2015 UTC,"What they mean by that is that a DDoS attack is a bunch (could be millions) of illegimate server requests that are sent one after another, over and over again until the server can no longer cope with the amount of requests its getting.  Online gaming, racing in particular which requires a very high update rate, also requires a bunch of small requests being sent over and over again, many times per second. Distinguishing what is a DDoS attack and what is legitimate is pretty much impossible for a low latency application.  If, however, the data center their server farm is based out of is the target of these attacks, and not iRacing directly, then switching centers would fix the problem. If it's iRacing that is being attacked you basically just have to start blacklisting IPs until the problem goes away which has its own problems if you end up blacklisting a customer."
iRacing,2zrf91,Vulfilla,4,Sat Mar 21 01:02:19 2015 UTC,"It is suspected that it is a former user who has been banned who are leading these attacks. Apparently, 3/4 of the recent incidents has happened right before a NiS race, which is how they came up with that idea...  So ATM it seems like iRacing itself might be the target which, as you mentioned, creates a whole lot of issues. Do you start banning IPs in a trial and error phase? Do you wait it out and hope it stops happening? Do you start extreme counter-measures like altering your entire network setup etc etc..."

iRacing,2zpn41,roccoc,2,Fri Mar 20 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"Only Race sessions affect your IR. Race, Qualify, and Time Trial sessions affect your SR. But at different rates: Races have a 1.0 multiplier, Qualify and Time Trial have a 0.35 multiplier. You can stop and leave the car as soon as you cross the finish line and get the checkers. You should try to find a safe spot to do so (pull way off the track or at least get out of the racing line. It takes 10 seconds or so to exit and while you're doing that you could get hit so you want to avoid that. Lots of people drive to the pits (on ovals and even on road courses) but most people just pull out of the way and exit. Just don't be ""that guy"" who stops right in the middle of the track :) No real details have been released about the Ring other than ""it's coming"". I use quite low FFB settings because I don't like to have to fight the wheel. I've never had an encoder problem, but that could just be luck."
iRacing,2zpn41,Sasken,2,Fri Mar 20 17:03:31 2015 UTC,"Qualy sessions have a 0.5 multiplier on Safety Rating.  There's no official release date for Nurburgring yet, but it is on the pro world championship race scheduled for 9/26/2015 at the Nurburgring. So it is a decent guess that iRacing are aiming to have at least the GP track done by then."

iRacing,2zpn41,Sasken,2,Fri Mar 20 21:48:24 2015 UTC,"The only series I know of that doesn't affect SR or iR is the carburetor cup. All hosted sessions don't affect SR or iR. You can theoretically leave as soon as you cross the line. Once you have finished the final lap, your spotter will say ""checkered flag it's over"" or something like that. When he does, you can stop anywhere that is safe and not going to cause late contact. Preferably at road courses with no asphalt run off, go around to the pits and stop before exiting. Remember, your SR can still be affected after the race ends. I assume you're referring to Nurburgring, details are small, I would assume races on the GP course will be relatively normal while official sessions on the full circuit will be longer endurance races. Hosted sessions are fair game."

iRacing,2zphyd,d_ckcissel285,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:09:58 2015 UTC,Not necessarily.  If you've rebooted it that's pretty much all you can do other than making sure nothing is actively downloading or uploading on the network while you're playing.  If there's anyway to run an Ethernet cable to your computer that's by far the best option.

iRacing,2zphyd,xxdreamtheaterx,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:26:07 2015 UTC,being on WiFi automatically elevates your ping and it opens the door to tons of problems. Something has simple as getting a baby monitor for your new born can interfere with your connection.   I suggest before you do anything else that you hook up with cable to confirm your wireless isnt the issue. and TBH you shouldnt game on wireless unless it's like hearthstone or something not time sensitive.
iRacing,2zphyd,xxdreamtheaterx,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:36:16 2015 UTC,"It's weird though because as far as I know, nothing has changed at all, there are no new things to interfere.   Also, I've never had trouble gaming on WiFi before, and it only appears to be iRacing that's affected. Otherwise my connections have always been silky smooth."
iRacing,2zphyd,Gutsyisland,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:53:17 2015 UTC,"Your F key panel. anything going yellow or red? It can only be one or the other.  I suppose it could be in between, you can just to a trace to iracing to see if there are any hops that are giving you a hard time, although unlikely. It's more likely that even if nothing changed in your home, something outside is pushing hard has changed.. Maybe you can try scanning the frequencies (theres an app for that) and then adjusting your router broadcast channel to reduce interference.   But to come back to my first post, even if you have to move stuff, always connect to a cable before starting to troubleshoot a wireless connection, because the possibilities there are close to endless and you could be giving yourself headaches for nothing. Unless you are 300' away from your router, nothing is too far for a cable."
iRacing,2zp079,mvlawn,3,Fri Mar 20 12:48:54 2015 UTC,"Someone else may be able to correct me, but I think the only time races occur every half hour is during week 13 of each season, and I believe only for the rookie classes.  During the regular season, c class trucks are every hour at :15 past the hour."
iRacing,2zp079,kaluh_glarski,3,Fri Mar 20 12:52:39 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, the C trucks race hourly.  The D team truck races don't happen."
iRacing,2zp079,d_ckcissel285,2,Fri Mar 20 13:57:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, every hour at the 15 minute mark. I don't know GMT time or how far ahead it is from eastern time zone, but either way on average there are about 15 splits per race. Every hour on the 15 minute mark and usually the session lasts about 50 minutes"
iRacing,2zp079,Itsjorgehernandez,2,Fri Mar 20 12:54:30 2015 UTC,"This is my 2 cents. But i strongly recommend you put your head down and TT as much as you can between race. If you're like me and want to race one after the other you really only get to this once you have an A class licence and you can bounce around the fun stuff with very little downtime. + it will save you some money.  The hard part (or rather mind numbing) is getting to 4.0 in the licence you currently have. After that you're only looking for .4 to .6 for the next licence and it goes quickly. I went from Rookie to A class in less then a week.  Compare iRacing to a game like Diablo. Leveling up is 1% of the game, the real game comes at max level. I've been playing games like forza for a long time, so my learning curve was pretty short. I stress that this is my opinion, you don't have to go that route but for me it was the most efficient and now i am truly enjoying the game.  Unless you are used to games like Forza where the trick to a good finish is awareness of the garbage that races with you, you probably don't have a good chance of climbing SR in a race, but $ wise its just not sound.  in D class i baught the national series car to race/TT, in C i did the stock TT and B i got the xfinity car cause im going to race that a lot even at A class. Did some races/TT there.  The most important thing is that you have fun. Nothing worst then paying for something that's a job."
iRacing,2zp079,xxdreamtheaterx,2,Fri Mar 20 17:51:33 2015 UTC,C class Truck races usually go back to back with little downtime in between. There are a LOT of yellow flag laps. Too many drivers pushing really hard since they are shorter races.  D class team trucks I've heard suck bad. Skip it. Get to D 4+ or C license and run the trucks. I ran the national series and had a lot of fun with that if it interests you. Got my first win at Charlotte with a national impala.

iRacing,2zlmxu,theebe,2,Fri Mar 20 00:47:57 2015 UTC,This is the tough part about racing the Radical. Most races are in Euro prime time which means us Americans can only race on weekends if you work normal hours. It's my favorite car but I never get to race it so I just stick with GT3 instead.
iRacing,2zlmxu,tstraw48,3,Fri Mar 20 13:06:11 2015 UTC,"Weird. Most drivers dont use clutch at all. You could do is try to disable auto-clutch and see if it helps.  Another option is binding clutch to a button on G27 and downshift when pressing this button.  Personally, I downshift with clutch bound to my DFGT. I've driven some cars before Radical and got used to button-clutching and blipping and I do the same with SR8, its just a habit for me at this point.  I'd like to strongly encourage you to not give up on the car and participate in official races. With new season Radical changed for the better and we need new drivers."

iRacing,2zk17p,ClarksonianPause,5,Thu Mar 19 05:16:31 2015 UTC,"I hated it at first,  but after a few races I really started to like it.  The trick,  as already mentioned,  is to have the lead truck let off just enough to keep the pushing guy right on his bumper. It takes practice and good teamwork but,  to me,  it feels a little more rewarding.  I was in a room where several guys had the technique  down pretty well and we actually had a pack racing together.  I feel like this is the most realistic drafting package they've had. Send me a message if you wanna get together and practice."
iRacing,2zk17p,DEVILneverCRIES,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:56:22 2015 UTC,"This is one of the issues I have about the new drafting model: the high line is basically no-man's land unless you have three or more trucks (I certainly found out the hard way multiple times). Best you can do is make deals with other racers around you and convince them to run the high line. As far as side-drafting goes, I prefer to perform them on the straightaway leading to the tri-oval, but I haven't truly tested it out yet since I'm not in a position to even attempt to side-draft multiple times."
iRacing,2zk17p,tommy44vercetti,3,Thu Mar 19 06:00:14 2015 UTC,"I mean, in real life if you have 10 cars lined up and 2 in a different line, you're not going to last long in the line of 2."
iRacing,2zk17p,d_ckcissel285,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:58:09 2015 UTC,"What iv learned so far is that if you qualify first you finish first. So stick to the yellow line. The first race I did was exactly that, on the last lap coming out of 4 second place decided to try and grab my side draft but wouldn't have got me without 3rd's help. 3rd at that point didn't want to help him because he rather have second. With that being said, if they had both committed to the high side they would have got me at the line. I don't think a complete pass would have happened though.  What I'm seeing with Gen6 is very similar. I noticed earlier today in carb cup that I could ""push"" or get very close to pushing if I did it on the right rear of the car. The right front of my car would be in clean air. Then it would allow me to get a run and not pass the person but get along side him long enough to take the position before hitting the start finish line. I want to try that in the trucks. You may be able to get just enough draft form the cars in front of him to pull past a guy but thats it. As someone else said unless you have a group commit to the outside its not going to happen.   Another thing Iv noticed is if the front car in any group drags the break or lets off the gas allowing the second car in line to get to your bumper you won't lose him. Wether that has any speed in the end I don't know. But at least you will have a partner rather than someone getting left out."

It also depends on the car/track combo, like the DW12 in a fixed race lacking the ability to adjust the ARBs is just dumb, you really need those adjustments to be able to pass on oval."
iRacing,2zk17p,lagatron,1 point,Thu Mar 19 11:49:31 2015 UTC,the new model is a little different but what ive noticed is the guy in front has a big advantage.  if you can team up with someone the however and the guy in front trails the brake just a bit then you can make up time and the outside will work.  also dont square up on the bumper for some reason you actually run faster if you get out to the side a little bit.

How do I know? Processing MIDI events for low latency audio suffers the same kind of issues (input latency vs accurate reproduction of the control movements).  All of this is before we get to drawing a frame. VSYNC on or off is just one part of the equation."

It wouldn't be that unusual for it to consistently happen with one particular track in test, for example, since that would get similar FPS and make it more likely you'd get similar sync issues between rendering output & monitor refresh. You could try tweaking the graphics options a little to drive FPS up or down a bit, if you don't want to cap FPS or risk lag with VSync."

Some people maybe...  iRacing certainly isn't deceptive. You sign up for the trial and you'll clearly see ""PURCHASE REQUIRED"" everywhere. Not like they're trying to dupe anybody.  I recently started getting stuff in RaceRoom as well. They work on a very similar model. As do Sim Raceway. (Though I BELIEVE the latter you can earn credits to buy everything. No idea if you have to race a million hours to do so... Just can't get into that sim.)   I'd recommend iRacing over RaceRoom currently. While I think RaceRoom has better sound than iRacing, iRacing offers more for the money IMO.  People need to not look at it as just a game, but as a Massively Multiplayer Online Racing Game. It's more World of Warcraft than Diablo. Plus with the ongoing revenue you're funding development of more great content. For example I guarantee when it's released, the Nurburgring Nordschleife in iRacing will be the benchmark standard for versions of the track."

iRacing,2zhhq8,the_ocean,2,Thu Mar 19 00:33:07 2015 UTC,"I'm unbiased. I tell people it's a great sim but be prepared to spend a LOT of money. My rig is basically my G27. That's it. According to the govt metrics, I'm below the poverty line, so it's a struggle, but in 3 years I've gotten most of the content at the expense of buying pretty much anything else for myself.  Hell I had to sell a bunch of stuff to buy Game Stockcar the other week!   iRacing is an amazing sim, but quite ridiculous financially. But if you spend wisely, wait for specials etc... Like the $100 credit for $75, or half price membership etc... It can hurt a lot less. Just gotta be patient. Plus you get $5 for your anniversary, and can earn $40 a year for participation credits. (Nobody ever seems to mention them.) Admittedly unless you're rich it'll be a while before you can do 8 of 12 races in a season...  When I first signed up I got the defaulf stuff, and the promo was you got the truck and Michigan (Inside Sim Racing was running an event so I signed up). Since my money was limited I went through every single series I was interested in, what tracks it was running that season etc... Wrote it all down and basically worked out what to buy to give me the most bang for my buck. Took me a few hours but made my first few months with iRacing a bit more fun.  I DID get lucky in one respect. My license. In the few weeks of signing up there was the Daytona 2.4 hour AND the Daytona 500, both of which boosted my license up a LOT so opened up to class C I think it was. So I had more options to consider than a lot of newbies would."

I spent like $60 and was able to race 8 of 10 tracks on the Late Model and all the tracks on National Series. That's not exactly rich person money, it's roughly equivalent to what you'd spend for BF:Hardline or any of the other umpteenth-run sequel games that come out every year. And if you buy the $100 for $75 package every year you can add a significant amount of content each year, in combination with the anniversary and participation credits."
iRacing,2zhhq8,jjhassert,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:34:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just dropped ~$80 to race 8 of the 12 races for the Skippy this season. Every new season will cost another $50-$60 to be able to race all 12, assuming I stick with the Skippy. That's like buying a new AAA game off Steam every 13 weeks.  Most rookies probably think of ""IRacing"" as being equivalent to one AAA game in the library, when it's really like each season is a game. It's like having to buy the new CoD game every 8 months because nobody plays the old one anymore. Except you also have to factor in the annual subscription, so it's a bit pricey."

I'm never going to be able to afford to race GT3 cars irl but in iRacing I can at least pretend. I'm considering either going g triple screen or getting fanatec pedals and the shifter on payday, I'd get the csw2 aswell but I believe it's still invite only.  Once you get out of rookie class I recommend the skip barber series if you like Road racing, the car will cost you $15 but the series tries to run a mix of free and paid tracks each month. There are some guides on the forum on the best way to spend your money so you can participate in the most amount of raves for the least amount of dollar.

And, although the costs can seem steep at first, once you've got the content you need to do the races you enjoy (which isn't cheap, but it's a one-off cost) it can work out very cheap indeed.  If you take advantage of the special offers that iRacing has regularly (esp. around the end of November), and you participate in races (for which you can earn up to $40 per year in credit), your yearly subscription can come to less than that $11 you've just spent. Which is very reasonable indeed, in my opinion."

Thats the value after a year or 2.   Now compare that with a $80 game that you might only play for 40 hours.  Some of the battles and fun I've had I would pay straight up $20 just for one of those races.  In fact, I have way more fun than goingto a local karting track."

Although the other drivers broke/crashed, they covered more distance than you did by the time the race ended. Once the leader takes the checkered flag, everyone else does too as they cross the finish line. If you're ten laps down and the people who crashed only lost two laps because of it, you are still physically behind them by distance.  For that same reason, it's important not to give up unless you really can't finish. You'll finish ahead of the people who quit out (unless you're more laps down than there are left in the race)."

iRacing,2zfljr,bozboy204,6,Wed Mar 18 04:00:04 2015 UTC,"Keep your tires fresh. Lift when possible. Arc your corners. move your steering wheel as little as possible. Drivers are some of the most impatient on Iracing so it's hard to just lay back and let the race come to you. Watch your delta on your wheel. If you are losing more than a tenth off your fast lap you should probably pit under the next yellow. Try to stay out of the draft in the corners and keep your nose clean it will help with grip and tire wear. When you do lift, lift early so you can get back in the throttle by apex. And for the love of god don't dive in corners deeper than you can handle."
iRacing,2zfljr,jjhassert,1 point,Wed Mar 18 06:05:30 2015 UTC,"Yes! Especially the steering wheel. Too many people try to race and move the wheel all over.

iRacing,2zfljr,jjhassert,2,Wed Mar 18 18:00:58 2015 UTC,"For Michigan, you will be lifting after maybe 10-12 laps at most because of the tires and the aero push. If you full throttle the whole race it will just get tighter and tighter and you need to adjust.   I actually drive quite conservatively in the beginning just to feel things through (and save my tires if it's a long green flag run) then I start being more aggressive as the race goes on. The good news about a lot of IndyCar fixed races is that there will be cautions and you can pit for tires (I recommend pitting between lap 15-20 if there's a caution around that time - give or take a couple laps).   It's best to practice your racecraft in open practice. If you know someone, you can practice running side by side and passing on the inside/outside. And if you actually want to pass someone, you need to plan it around 3 corners in advance (for example turns 2-4).  If you want to see how I race the DW12, here is my channel and here was my last DW12 video, the last race of Season 1 at Indy.  Great to see you in IndyCars. Just keep learning and you will get a lot better! I gained 400 iRating from 6 IndyCar weeks thanks to lots of practice and some good races.   And also change your steering (the only things you can change in the fixed series) to 8 and -4 (forgot the headings). It will help you a lot with turning your wheel."
iRacing,2zfljr,rancer890,1 point,Wed Mar 18 06:09:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice. I'll try some open practices to get a better feeling for lines and draft effect in corners. I'll take a look at the race you ran as well as I don't really have an idea how to approach these races yet.   It seems like if you pit during caution you should be able to remain on the lead lap, correct?"
iRacing,2zfljr,rancer890,2,Wed Mar 18 09:46:31 2015 UTC,"Do note that most of my DW12 videos on my channel are using the older physics model. Compared to Season 1, I think you can run a bit closer in Season 2 (aero push isn't as strong -- but you still have to be wary of it of course in the corners) and more opportunities to pass.   And yes if you pit you will still be on the lead lap. :)"
iRacing,2zfljr,amousecaledmicky,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:07:16 2015 UTC,"Indycar fixed is really sensitive. Since everyone is driving the same exact car, it comes down to really small differences to gain the advantage. Also, because you're going so fast you need to really plan a head. To much draft and having to lift to not rear end someone can throw your entire turn off and lose precious hundredths. It will take a lot of practice. And there are a lot of really good drivers in there."

iRacing,2zgpkj,lukeatron,3,Wed Mar 18 15:40:34 2015 UTC,They have clutches but they're only used for starting from a standstill.  They have very (extremely) complex engine management computers that put the RPMs precisely where they need to be execute the shift in just a dozen thousandths of a second.  The gas pedal on those cars is really just a suggestion to the engine management system.  The computer is the only thing that's actually working the throttle.
iRacing,2zgpkj,RileyF1,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:44:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on the car.  The more expensive, higher performance cars tend to deal with those details for you as part of their programming.  They will do things like the stutter the ignition on upshifts and blip the gas on downshifts.  Cars with less electronics will make you handle this yourself.    One important thing you loose with simracing is the tactile feedback from the shifter itself.  You can feel in the shifter when you're trying to shift and the transmission doesn't want to do it.  First of all the shifter won't move into the next gear position.  You'll feel the shifter bouncing or grinding a bit as it tries to engage the next gear if the RPMs aren't where they need to be for that to happen.  For upshifts that means you have to let off the gas a little bit and for downshifts you need to give it a quick stab of throttle.  What this does is briefly unload the transmission so things can move around.  A transmission that's under power, either from the engine or from the wheels on deceleration, can't do much other than what it's already doing (transmitting power).  iRacing simulates this decently well at least.  The skippy is really good example.  On upshifts you can put the shifter in upshift position and it won't shift until you lift off the gas.  The same with downshift only you blip instead of lifting.  Clutchless downshifts on the skippy are less reliable than upshifts so I tend to downshift with the clutch most of the time rather than risk missing a shift.  Some cars, I know the Caddy is one, the vette possibly as well (I don't have it), will assist you with upshifts by stuttering the ignition so you can quickly upshift with your foot on the floor, but don't assist with downshifts.  All the blipping and lifting takes a little bit to get used to, especially downshifting while braking, but with some practice it becomes something you don't even consciously think about.  The activity of your feet and hands becomes mostly automatic after a while.  You just have to have to train your muscles to work together by practicing over and over."
iRacing,2zgpkj,Bakkster,2,Wed Mar 18 16:41:33 2015 UTC,You have to use the clutch in a lot of sequential shift cars.
iRacing,2zgpkj,RileyF1,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:12:11 2015 UTC,"You don't have to use the clutch for any of the sequential cars, since they all have dog boxes. The only difference is if you need to lift/blip for up/down shifting."

iRacing,2zgpkj,slobbishbodysfw,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:05:47 2015 UTC,"Depends which cars you drive. Kids coming up through the single seater ladder are frequently left foot brakers because the dog box doesn't require anything more. GTs and touring cars are often another story, depending on the level of electronics, but even then it's about mechanical sympathy rather than an inability to shift without it."
iRacing,2zgpkj,True_Racer,2,Wed Mar 18 22:16:46 2015 UTC,"Like /u/capnbard said, try using left foot braking with a bit of a blip on the throttle with your right foot as you downshift.  You shouldn't need the clutch at all in the C6R."
iRacing,2zgpkj,my_dick_said_this,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:31:45 2015 UTC,I'm not familiar with that car but it is a fail safe some times to not over Rev the engine try waiting a little longer to downshift instead of machine gun downshifting
iRacing,2zgpkj,my_dick_said_this,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:18:51 2015 UTC,"In real race cars, it's a safety system so you don't grenade the tranny. The way to do it is to either wait for the revs to come down to match the previous gears rpm or to touch the throttle and bring the rpms up so the previous gears rpm:mph ratio matches the current gear. It's hard to learn, but it can make you faster. Albeit not much. I probably explained that terribly. Hopefully someone understands and can explain it better than me."
iRacing,2zgpkj,krneki12,2,Wed Mar 18 14:31:05 2015 UTC,I think I understand. Do you mean like this guy does it?: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUI_XNyEfrs
iRacing,2zgpkj,disgustipated,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:55:37 2015 UTC,Exactly. That technique is called heel-toe. Toes on the brakes and heel bumps the throttle. It's awkward at first if you've never done it before. But it becomes natural after a few races.
iRacing,2zgpkj,doveenigma13,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:27:26 2015 UTC,"Skip @00:20 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L-FxxZcAJo The difference between sequential shifting and H pattern shifting is that you move your gear leaver up/down instead in H pattern. The clutch works in the same way. It's like you change gear on proper bikes. As for the use of the clutch, depending on the engine, transmission, ... you don't always need to press it for up-shifting, but usually you do for downshifting. Consult with your local car dealer to find out more. :)"
iRacing,2zgpkj,Bakkster,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:33:02 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem with the vette and a Logitech G27. Learn to heel-and-toe, and blip the throttle on downshifts.  It will screw with your braking until you figure it out.  With that said, anybody have tips on maintaining consistent braking pressure when blipping the throttle on a G27? :)"

I am not saying that it is ready for Iracing because it wouldn't be worth it monetarily just yet, but I would love to see it in iracing eventually. I think all the nay sayers could benefit from being more open to it, because while I love petrol v8's and sure as hell going to miss them in the end, like it or not in the very long term formula e is going to be the future when traditional f1 dies with the combustion engine."
iRacing,2ze3lx,mobileuseratwork,2,Wed Mar 18 00:29:26 2015 UTC,The aero packages do help. Put the same engine tech in the shitbox you drive and i bet it would not perform the same.  Dont like the sound? Im sure you can find mute on your tv.  Pit stops. Dont they put specialy designed rubber on F1 cars that   is meant to not last yo give it more entertainment?

Yup ...in fact they have been purposefully doing this since ....I may be wrong but mid to late 80's if not earlier. I'm an 80s kid but I've been watching F1 since early 90s and they were already saying that on TV back then. Tyre manufacturers have been able since the late 80s to make a better grip longer lasting compound that would allow the F1s to run a full 80 laps race on the same rubber.  What they are doing now is trying to safely rig wear for the show.
iRacing,2ze3lx,dewmsolo,2,Wed Mar 18 03:20:50 2015 UTC,"The cars are not fast because the tech isn't there yet. Give it a few years of team R&D and they'll be up to speed. I actually like the sound and think it sounds cool. Hearing it in person probably has a lot to do with that though The pit stops are like that for safety for now. The techniques are likely to change   This is a brand new formula, it needs time to get better but I think it's great for its first year ever."

iRacing,2zciu4,my_dick_said_this,3,Tue Mar 17 17:18:57 2015 UTC,That's what I mean. Daytonas not hard to pick up. In a video game anyway.

iRacing,2zciu4,jrebs,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:42:43 2015 UTC,"The problem was that the FW31 was released and after week 13 was over, everyone bitched that they spent money on a car that requires an A license to drive. So, they did the Carb Cup and had the road equivalent which was F1 unofficial races regularly at free tracks. It was terrible (which to be fair most unofficial road racing with randoms will be) and was eventually dropped.  The point is that it had to be the FW31 because of the number of people who bought it and wanted to run it.  Honestly I don't need or want this. Unofficial races on a regular basis give people something to distract them from official races. iRacing used to do fun races every Saturday (24heurs du Fun) and this was a pretty decent system to get unnofficial racing in the schedule without it impacting the schedule all week long, but I still think the system is rather good as is. Road Racing attendance isn't yet strong enough for the series it has available, IMO. Focus on fixing that first."
iRacing,2zciu4,Bakkster,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:18:14 2015 UTC,"More specifically, there were two subscription deals. The oval one had the Gen 6, Daytona, and Dega.

Which naturally the FW-31 one was more difficult on both counts."

But assuming you get up to speed w/o spinning the tires and going around, most people aren't going to just outright wreck by themselves.  There's at least a dozen more things people can fuck up in a high powered car on the road (e.g. blowing through brake points, locking tires, randomly slowing too early [inconsistency], offtrack & reentry, more opportunities to spin the tires, larger speed/lap time disparity/closing rate, etc.) not to mention the etiquette being different.  I don't want someone who can't drive something slow anywhere near me in something fast."
iRacing,2zciu4,novaquasarsuper,5,Tue Mar 17 14:30:46 2015 UTC,I hear the term dragging the brakes quite a bit. What exactly does that mean?
iRacing,2zciu4,LewisKiniski,3,Tue Mar 17 15:45:52 2015 UTC,Lightly tapping or resting your foot on the brake petal while leaving your car at full gas. This allows you to keep your RPMs almost at what they would be while still slowing the car down.
iRacing,2zciu4,Hindulaatti,4,Tue Mar 17 15:55:16 2015 UTC,Ahhh. Thanks. I'll try it out in practice this evening. I've always done a one or the other thing.
iRacing,2zciu4,LewisKiniski,5,Tue Mar 17 16:01:05 2015 UTC,"Example applications:   In plate racing, you want to bump draft the guy ahead but your closing rate is unsafe.  So you apply 1-2% brakes to hit him at an appropriate speed. You want to get off a guy going into the corner.  Lifting is too big a penalty, punching the brakes is both dangerous and too big a penalty.  So you drag the brakes a little. You're the lead car, but you need the guy behind you to close up (or you've gotten too far ahead and need to manage their closing rate), so you drag them a little to keep from getting too far ahead.   Mainly I think it's a distance-to-another-car management tool.  In road racing, if I catch someone but can't get alongside before the brake point, I normally lift since I'm going to do it anyway."

Edit: also, while it would happen, multi car wrecks are less frequent (minus the standing start if they had it) as cars are spread out, and a lot of the wrecks you described would not affect someone who can keep the tires on track anyway . At Daytona, there's usually nowhere to/no time to react."

iRacing,2zejo4,AR-47,3,Wed Mar 18 21:38:19 2015 UTC,"Get a MOMO or DFGT like DeathHaze said.  MOMOs are generally much cheaper than DFGTs. Don't spend over $100 on your first wheel. If you can find a DFGT for that much, go for it. The MOMO is a good wheel though and will suffice.  There are two types of wheels on the market now:  Gear-driven: Very old technology. Gears are cheap and fairly reliable, but they create a characteristic grindy, ""notchy"", digital like effect on the FFB response you get. There are also gaps in the FFB where you will get no response whatsoever (like in the center of the wheel).  Belt-driven: ""Analog""-like response. Very smooth, stronger than gears can ever be, and much more realistic. More complex than gears so they tend to have more reliability issues, but even so the majority of wheels turn out fine. There won't be any gaps in the FFB like with gears. Belts used to be just limited to very expensive wheels, but Fanatec and Thrustmaster both have offerings for $200-$300 now. The 911 GT3 and TX respectively.  Belts are superior in pretty much every way to gears other than reliability. Cost used to be an issue but now belt-drives are mass-manufactured and the price has fallen in line with gear-wheels, and they'll only get cheaper in the next few years. Once you're done with your first wheel and want to upgrade, get a belt-wheel, it'll be a massive upgrade from your first wheel."
iRacing,2zejo4,SgtMustang,2,Tue Mar 17 23:29:46 2015 UTC,Tagging on to this - I'm selling my old DFGT (in excellent condition and with all accessories) - if you're in North America then total+shipping will be less that $100. Let me know if you're interested.
iRacing,2zejo4,Badgerness,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:18:50 2015 UTC,What wheels are worth purchasing that are under 100$ dollars? I haven't been able to find any.
iRacing,2zejo4,Coleistoogood,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:11:24 2015 UTC,"You don't have to hold to the <$100 limit if you don't want, it's just a rough guide.   I'd just recommend sticking to MOMO's or DFGTs for your first wheel as they're pretty reliable, simple, and do what you need in a starter wheel, then, if you still like Simracing a few years down the line, you can think about making the jump to belt-driven wheels like the Thrustmasters or Fanatecs (which will undoubtedly be even cheaper then)."
iRacing,2zejo4,SgtMustang,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:27:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, literally everyone is saying DFGT, so I think that's what I will go with."
iRacing,2zejo4,Coleistoogood,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:28:00 2015 UTC,"If you can find one for $100 or less, go for it. I find often because they're much more desirable than MOMOs they go for considerably more.  Momo has actual paddles, DFGT has only buttons, if that's a consideration for you."
iRacing,2zejo4,SgtMustang,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:36:43 2015 UTC,Could you throw me a link to the Momo your speaking of? When I was looking at Momos they were considerably more expensive then DFGT's on sites like amazon.
iRacing,2zejo4,Coleistoogood,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:46:38 2015 UTC,"There are two versions of the Momo, the Momo Force, which has a red base, and the Momo Racing, which has a black base. The Force preceded the Racing by a few years. It is rarer and more expensive as a result. I remember reading back when I got my Black Momo that some people considered the Red superior, though I don't remember why anymore. Might have been more expensive and higher quality. The Red MOMO goes for $150 or so used which puts it about the same as the DFGT (www.amazon.com/Logitech-PlayStation-Driving-Force-Racing-3/dp/B0015HYPOO), which costs around $156. The Black Momo can be found for $100 at the cheapest.  The DFGT does have more rotation than the Momo, but it lacks actual paddles. If I were you, I'd just go for the Black Momo for your first wheel, and if you stick with iRacing for awhile and want to upgrade, go for a Thrustmaster TX or T300RS when those drop in price even more. For $150 for the DFGT you're in used G27/Thrustmaster on sale territory. Personally, with Belt-driven wheels as cheap as they are now, I wouldn't spend $150 or more on a gear-driven wheel. The only selling point of gear-driven wheels is price, and even that disparity is shrinking rapidly. I've been using a MOMO for like 8 years now and it still works fine. It's a solid wheel and you won't have any problems with it, but its cheap enough that it doesn't feel like a big investment.  The DFGT is basically the successor to the MOMO, they're fairly close mechanically, other than extra rotation on the DFGT. They both have the exact same pedals. If you can find a DFGT for $100 though, as someone in this thread offered, go for it."
iRacing,2zejo4,SgtMustang,1 point,Thu Mar 19 09:08:55 2015 UTC,"What are some of the things I need to start?     Computer. I've never tried iRacing on a MacBook, so I can't say how well it would perform. I use  a PC. iRacing isn't a particularly demanding game, so you don't need an especially high performer unless you want to play other sims/games too. Some sort of controller. Some people race successfully with a game controller, but frankly I think you're much better off with a wheel/pedal set.  If you're on a budget get the Logitech DFGT which is the cheapest wheel that's actually worth buying. If you can afford to spend a bit more, the Logitech G27 is the starting wheel to aim for. Later, when you're addicted and have cash to spare, you can upgrade to a better wheel & pedals, get a shifter, a button box, 3 monitors or an Oculus Rift, a full cockpit, bass shakers & SimVibe, etc, etc :-) An iRacing subscription. I don't know if there are any promo codes around for any reduced price deals at the moment, but you may want to do some Googling to see if you can find one.  Read the Sporting Code  (iRacing login required) to discover how things work and what's expected of you. You don't have to read it in full, but be aware of what sort of info is there so you can refer to it when necessary Watch the iRacing Basic Training videos and  Surviving Rookies.  Optionally, watch Sim Racing 101,  and Going Faster (this last one is excellent)."

I think it depends on two factors: how high you turn your force feedback up, and how rough you are on the wheel. If your wheel has to output high forces or you really hammer on it, then yes the optical encoder can break loose.  I use quite low force feedback and I'm also easy on the wheel. So I don't anticipate any issues with it.  Of course it could fail tomorrow; sometimes shit happens. But I wouldn't paint the wheel as ""unreliable""."
iRacing,2zer7x,Sasken,2,Tue Mar 17 23:57:40 2015 UTC,People are quick to criticise but rarely compliment unless prompted. For every defective wheel there are hundreds/thousands that work great. My G27 works fine.

iRacing,2zdutn,smythbdb,5,Tue Mar 17 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"So, first off, I would save a replay, and let others look at it to make sure that you didn't just cut someone off. You have to realize that it is your duty to make sure you don't get spun out as well, and not everything is someone elses fault. (I say this from experience as I thought this way for a long time. I realized I win more if I just leave room and make them heavily uncomfortable. ;D)  Anyways, you can save a replay and send it to them via the ""Report"" feature, which I don't know where they moved it too. But REALLLLLLLLY recommend you save the entire replays of any race you feel you want to report someone. (there's a setting to have it ask you everytime you end a race)"
iRacing,2zdutn,arsenicfox,2,Tue Mar 17 19:45:55 2015 UTC,"To add to this: when you submit a protest, there's a limit to how big the replay can be. Generally full race replays are WAY too long. So you should cut out just the relevant part of the replay. If you don't, you'll get an ugly error message when you try to submit the protest.  It's also just helpful to the iRacing staff to submit as small a replay as possible so they don't have to try to find the point in the race you're protesting."
iRacing,2zdutn,Sasken,3,Tue Mar 17 19:48:46 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of times there's fault on both sides of a crash. Before protesting an incident you should always watch the replay from all angles (including the other driver's view) and ask yourself ""how could I have avoided that?"".  Before leaving the server, watch the replay. There are lots of really good tools in the sim for watching replays. You can rewind to where you want to watch. You can also save a portion of the replay to use in your protest if you decide to go that way. (The replay is also where you identify the other driver involved - it shows his name and number).  I've been in races where I could have sworn that the other guy just plain ran me over. Then I watched the replay and realized I moved over on him and the fault was all mine. It's always easy to say ""he spun me"" in the heat of the moment.  If in the end you decide that the fault all the other driver's, if you still want to lodge a protest you should understand that iRacing normally only penalizes intentional wrecking. If it's just a mistake, then they won't do much if anything. People make mistakes.  Finally, you need to realize that you're in the Rookie division. Some of those guys are never going to be able to drive properly. Your goal is to get out of Rookie, not to win races. If somebody is driving erratically, avoid them. Finish races without incidents and you'll be promoted in no time. Finishing last is just as good as finishing first: incidents are all that matter.  Once you get out of Rookie, the driving generally improves (although there are always going to be bad drivers)."
iRacing,2zdutn,Sasken,3,Tue Mar 17 19:43:59 2015 UTC,This all makes a lot of sense I was pretty heated when I made this post so I wasn't really using logic. I've been doing circle track and people keep drafting to close and bumping me so I spin and they just keep going like nothing happened. I'm really enjoying the game so far when the racing is clean but if stuff like this keeps happening I don't know if I'm going to keep putting money into it. I came to iracing from Assetto to try and get that clean racing.
iRacing,2zdutn,Bakkster,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:50:58 2015 UTC,"One thing to remember is that you're driving in the Rookie series, which means you can't always trust the other drivers yet. If you can't trust the guy behind you, sometimes the best choice is to let them by. Better for them to wreck someone else than to wreck you.  PM me if you have any other issues or need any help, and good luck!"
iRacing,2zdutn,sm2016,2,Tue Mar 17 20:33:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I've just been letting people pass me and not caring about position and my score is starting to go up. Thanks for the help.
iRacing,2zdutn,sm2016,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:28:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't trust anyone. Also just so you know there are colored lines on the rear bumper of every car indicating their license, so if you see red, only pass if you know you can clear them quickly, same with orange. If you see blue, green or for some unknown reason black you can expect a little better of them, as they are in higher safety rating classes.   I recommend in street stocks to always miss the grid, start from the pits, and grind up to a D class license."

iRacing,2zdutn,DeathHaze420,2,Wed Mar 18 11:33:11 2015 UTC,It is as much your responsibility to avoid asshats to the best of your ability as it is theirs to not be asshats.  Many rookies think that an accident was someone else's fault when in reality it was theirs.

iRacing,2zdutn,mav3r1ck92691,3,Tue Mar 17 21:21:10 2015 UTC,"The word asshat is truly the English language at its finest.   On another note, even running in class A and B, if I know someone is WAY faster than me and that even if I fight them they will eventually get by, I'll let them have the position.   This helps on multiple fronts.  It avoids an incident, it gives you a draft to follow, and if he catches the pack and battles for position it gives you a chance to get up there and get in the mix.  TL;DR: if you are slow... let the fast guys by"

iRacing,2zdutn,jjhassert,2,Tue Mar 17 22:05:21 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad strategy to continue with forever. There will always be someone faster, there will always be someone slower, and there will always be someone you can have an epic battle with. I don't see any reason to slow down both the faster guy AND myself with a useless battle. At the same time, I could care less about winning the race if I have an epic battle with an equally skilled driver the whole race.  One of my all time favorite races was an MX5 on Limerock Full (already had my B Class, but was just doing it for fun). There was another driver who I started to mix it up with, and the CLEAN battle lasted for 10 laps with a total of 23 passes between the two of us. It was some of the most fun in a long time even though I only finished 5th."
iRacing,2zdtn3,poppaburr,2,Tue Mar 17 19:27:08 2015 UTC,What are you unable to see? They renamed the GT3 series to the Blancpain Sprint Series. Look at your options for your Popular races and practices tab.

I'm not saying you're not good enough to compete in new series; just be sure that you can compete, and safely, before you start moving up.  Don't make the mistake of treating it like a videogame progression, where the goal is to move up the license classes as fast as possible.  Move up at your own pace, when you know you're ready.  Plenty of people with B or A class licenses still racing in Production Car Challenge or Advance Mazda Cup."
iRacing,2zcq80,h3r4ld,4,Tue Mar 17 14:56:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty much agree with what h3r4ld is saying. But to add to this - please don't get disheartened when you finish at the back of the grid time and time again. You will improve, but you've got to put the the hours in.

iRacing,2zcq80,cuntalist,2,Tue Mar 17 16:43:34 2015 UTC,Thank you and yes. Safety is the most important thing I lookout for when racing.. I don't mind about getting last or even passing people.  I aim to get no incidents and that seemed to help..
iRacing,2zcq80,AR-47,3,Tue Mar 17 23:49:40 2015 UTC,"On road side Skip Barber is the most popular series.  On the oval side the National Impala isn't a bad series, but all the tracks are short and won't end up getting used in the NASCAR series.  I'd recommend trying to work your way to D 4.0 and going straight to trucks if you want to save money."
iRacing,2zcq80,spuds_in_town,2,Tue Mar 17 14:44:50 2015 UTC,"Skip has probably the best community for new drivers too. Training videos, lap guides, all sorts. And lots of fast, experienced drivers willing to help out. Check the Skip forum."

iRacing,2zcy9m,emersonlakeandlagoon,2,Tue Mar 17 20:49:51 2015 UTC,"Carb Cup and hosted races are unofficial and affect none of your stats.   Races in official series where less than 6 people sign up are also unofficial.  They do not affect irating at all and are weighted less in safety rating.  You can get a little safety rating in qualifying, time trial, and pre-race warmups.   They're weighted less as well.  Clean laps in the regular races are what really gets the safety rating moving up."

iRacing,2zcief,mvlawn,2,Tue Mar 17 13:18:52 2015 UTC,Very interesting. Have you been playing iRacing on the same Macs before?   Also. I would highly recommend running Boot Camp if you're going to go iRacing on a Mac. It's what I've been doing for years and will give you far better control. IRacing runs better in Windows.

iRacing,2zcf3f,sm2016,1 point,Tue Mar 17 12:49:34 2015 UTC,"Official racing is equivalent to Career Mode and hosted races are one off ""quick races"" to use ""arcade racer"" terms. League racing is like career mode with multiple people all at once, with point systems and champions... Etc.  Edit: in iRacing team racing refers to a race in which drivers share a car and swap at various points in the race. You'd literally be racing with not against your friend, and not at the same time."

iRacing,2zb732,marginally-marginal,1 point,Tue Mar 17 03:07:39 2015 UTC,"I have that exact box from Derek Spears.    Single throw switches work great for neutral, starter, ignition and requesting a pit stop... Oh and the pit limiter.  All those things that you want a little more effort and certainty when you select them to remove the risk of accidentally engaging them.  The most valuable things to me on that version of the box are the rotary encoders.  I'm serious, they are a godsend.  The rotary encoders are perfect for cycling through the HUD, making menu specific selections (brake bias, fuel level, etc) as well as cycling the splits HUD and tire pressures.  Then the buttons right above the encoders can readily be used check or uncheck the specific box you have used the encoder to select.  Then, I mapped some of the specific push buttons to specific HUDS and labelled them.  PIT, RELATIVE, TIME, etc... Makes it a quick button push when coming out of the pits, when preparing for the pits to select fuel.  Hope that helps.  pm if you have any other questions."

iRacing,2z8ej6,True_Racer,3,Mon Mar 16 14:30:59 2015 UTC,"There is no mystery here, it is because of popularity. There is high demand for GT3. Plus it is a nice way to add more cars without hurting similar series since they all run in the same series. Adding Indy Lights would water down the open wheel series hurting the already struggling Lotus 79, Indycar and Williams/McLaren series."
iRacing,2z8ej6,spektr,2,Mon Mar 16 21:03:47 2015 UTC,"I think if iRacing and Indy Car could agree on something, they would do it. However its not as simple as just saying it should happen, it takes a lot of time and money. Not to mention GT3 is the most frequently raced road series.   EDIT: I'm not saying i know iRacing or Indy have talked, I'm just saying why wouldn't they. It would be awesome to see a sanctioned Indycar lights, and Indycar series."
iRacing,2z8ej6,LKincheloe,3,Mon Mar 16 14:35:59 2015 UTC,"I think at one point they did have an arraignment, but IndyCar decided not to renew it. Thankfully iR has the agreement with Dallara and Honda to provide the Gen1 DW12."
iRacing,2z8ej6,Bakkster,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:52:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they ran a premier series with it and everything.  Arguably, part of the issue is there are just fewer 'cool' open-wheel cars to license, with most of the series being spec nowadays. The only open development open wheel series left is F1, and we have three generations of F1 car with a fourth on the way. The two Lotus cars are easily in the top 5 coolest GP cars of all time as well."

iRacing,2z8ej6,Tex-Rob,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:25:52 2015 UTC,"I would love this, but I think the key to getting more and more people into iRacing is new series, new demographics.  To me this leads to touring cars, that's a whole big market.  Of course rally would be amazing, but that's a huge thing to ask, and would require a third license in reality, and either it's own engine, or massive changes to adapt to it."

Like you I watched many videos, and learned as much as I could (I mean this isn't the cheapest hobby, ya know?). And what I come to believe is that there are people who may be over confident in their ability starting out. I mean if you are constantly wrecking in rookies, you are really the only constant there. I don't want to generalize because we all get a bad run of races (myself included) but if you cant get out of the rookie class, it may be because you are trying too hard to win races and not finish clean."

Have to say that when I joined, the rookie oval race was Charlotte, as it's a pure hold the line draft fest with full throttle it was relatively easy to get promoted. Staying away from people battling it out in the mazda also made things easy, letting people pass to see them going out the next turn."
iRacing,2z9wgp,Eburon,2,Tue Mar 17 00:41:40 2015 UTC,People that get stuck in rookies generally think they can just jump into iRacing and pretend it's Need For Speed.  I went from Rookie to A class in a couple of months and from D-class to B-class in a single week.

iRacing,2zajl7,pleaseexcusemytpyos,2,Tue Mar 17 00:49:55 2015 UTC,Is this true? I always thought an incident was an incident and the only issue with driving a slower car is that you do fewer corners per race.

The first time I barely touched the Skippy before getting promoted and went on to the Star Mazda.   I had to go back to Skippy to better my driving, something I couldn't really do in the Mazda. There is too much emphasis on the S/R at the start of your iRacing career, it really doesn't matter that much. If I had to do it again, I would run the skippy untill I felt comfortable and was able to race incident free. Yeah you have idiots, but I would say 90% of the time the complainers are as much at fault as the ""idiot"". Making passes they shouldn't.  If you see a guy changing lines, making odd corners, ... stay behind him. He'll sooner or later leave the track. Losing a few positions in turn 1 is almost always the better choice. You'll most likely have caught them back by turn 3.  And without even noticing you'll find yourself battling for the top spots with the idiots shouting through their radios a half lap down. The only incidents I accept in road racing are the ones at the start and if I couldn't get a line out of trouble. Every other incident is my fault in one way or the other."
iRacing,2zajl7,DarkElf12,1 point,Tue Mar 17 09:12:54 2015 UTC,I would suggest SM or V8's. The V8's increase your driving skill if you can control it for an entire race.
iRacing,2zajl7,Eburon,2,Tue Mar 17 03:15:21 2015 UTC,"Too soon for V8's, first race the skippy incident free. The V8 is the hardest series out there to keep a clean car."
iRacing,2zajl7,DarkElf12,1 point,Tue Mar 17 09:15:13 2015 UTC,It is the hardest. If he can master the skippy though I would say start practising in the V8. Next season run that and if he can run it well then he can probably run any car on iRacing cleanly
iRacing,2z9ssi,Seblos,3,Mon Mar 16 20:30:25 2015 UTC,"DFGT or G27. I'd recommend the G27 as it comes with a Clutch and H-Shifter, which I find to be a much more enjoyable way of racing (plus gets you in decent habits early, with things like Toe-Heeling)  I've been racing in iRacing for almost 7 years and, I'll be honest, it does take a ""bit"" of practice, but it's not terrible and, in fact, makes you much better at other racing games. ;)  You'll have a lot of fun, just participate in the community and have a good time! (And don't fall into the habit of blaming everyone else for wrecks. I found, a lot of the times, had I just paid attention and realized how horrible the drivers are around me, I would've been fine)  But you would def. want a wheel before even attempting it.   I'd also recommend you read up on a few sites:  Empty Box: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0lqJnCYTWo&list=PLAywC4hctMbmu_9J6vSewjmIoaLtj-Bry  SPECIFICALLY the FOV video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yYeiAHsdr0&index=6&list=PLAywC4hctMbmu_9J6vSewjmIoaLtj-Bry  Also, I found a lot of good advice for iRacing from www.edracing.com  Once you're in, iRacing's forum has a lot of great information to get the most from the sim as well. :)  Hope to see you on the track!"

If you do, a wheel makes almost all of them 100x more interesting and exciting. My first wheel was a DFGT that I picked up for around £50/$70, so it's not an insane investment.   If you try out iRacing and don't think it's for you, there are still a myriad of different options out there. Even GT5 can be exciting with the right setup."

It gives you 3 months of iRacing for $5, which makes it worth a shot just to see if you like it. You can get quite a bit of fun out of the standard content in 3 months, certainly enough to work out whether you want to continue with iRacing. There are probably other deals around that I don't know about, so have a look around."

I decided to go to the bottom and go three wide as I knew that I had the speed to get past before the dog leg. the middle car taps the top car sending him down to me and I have a massive sideways moment on the straight manage to save it without losing any positions. During that caution the leader and I pitted again. He then pulled a stupid move and wrecked the 2 of 3 guys including myself out that could actually keep up with him. I run out of luck :(

Whether or not you can apply will depend on the league. There's a pretty decent endurance series that just got started recently (2 events completed so far) called DGFX. They run four classes of cars in 3hr and 6hr team endurance events. Minimum of 2 drivers per team. The season runs roughly one race per month until about November. The standards have been pretty good so far.  In general, you'll certainly find more endurance offerings if you have a team to enter with.  Also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzLGe1hlfms"

If you primarily want to try team racing and see if it's what you'd like to focus on long term, then you can probably easily find someone to partner up with to join a casual hosted or unofficial team gt3 event or something just to see how it works."

iRacing,2z6d0d,VegetableManiac,17,Sun Mar 15 23:47:59 2015 UTC,"As someone still relatively new to iRacing, the way I see it is yes, it's going to cost you a decent chunk of change if you want to be serious about it.  That said, the same is true for everyone else on it, so in the end the only people you really find (once you get beyond the free content) are people who are actually, genuinely serious about simracing, and that's what you're paying for.  If you want to be able to accurately simulate the experience of driving various race cars around different tracks, you don't need iRacing.  There are plenty of other sims out there that are as good as iRacing, if not better (rFactor 1/2, Assetto Corsa, Project CARS).  But if you want to simulate the experience of racing week in and week out against real people who are as good as if not better than you are (thanks to ratings systems), then iRacing is your choice, hands down.  TL;DR: It will cost money if you're serious, but everyone else is, too."
iRacing,2z6d0d,h3r4ld,10,Mon Mar 16 00:44:53 2015 UTC,"I look at iRacing as more of a hobby than anything. It's more expensive than your typical game, but I've also gotten way more fulfillment and enjoyment out of this than any other sim racer or game out there. The public online racing is unmatched by any of the other sims out there.  With that said, if the money part is scary, a pretty similar experience can be had by joining a good league in any of the other sims out there (Assetto Corsa, rFactor, etc.). For me personally, I have never been that into league racing. My schedule varies week to week and it's hard to stick to a league calendar."
iRacing,2z6d0d,jettj14,2,Mon Mar 16 02:03:28 2015 UTC,"Your post has merits of course, and I almost fully agree with it. But unfortunately money is not worth the same to everyone so there are plenty of drivers there who have spent a lot and have a lot of content but they are not serious in the slightest. I've seen my share of people who had a lot of content but were just fucking about in race sessions."
iRacing,2z6d0d,soestrada,8,Mon Mar 16 10:05:09 2015 UTC,"The career system allows for close racing with guys who are in the same skill group as you.  Also the game looks, feels and sounds refined."
iRacing,2z6d0d,Hindulaatti,2,Sun Mar 15 23:49:57 2015 UTC,"Just one word, multiplayer.  If you don't care about quality online racing with people from around the world, iRacing is not needed.  It's so far better than any other game/sim when it comes to racing online, career, oval and road racing, etc, that there is not even anything in a close second."
iRacing,2z6d0d,Tex-Rob,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:44:00 2015 UTC,"The simulation itself is impressive, graphics are ok but I'm just hoping for a wider variety of tracks and cars without the cost racking up. Or maybe something open source like Assetto Corsa  So is it the community that makes this so popular?"
iRacing,2z6d0d,ETPhoneMyHome,7,Sun Mar 15 23:54:18 2015 UTC,If you want to race offline and have lots of tracks and cars at your disposal there are several better options. However what sets this game apart is the online aspect. You will not find an experience like it in any other game/sim period. You do not have to spend hundred and hundreds of dollars unless you wish to. A lot of people will get to d class and then race in 1 or 2 series which can cost around a hundred something dollars but the racing it has to offer makes it entirely worth it.
iRacing,2z6d0d,ztherion,3,Mon Mar 16 00:17:41 2015 UTC,Assetto Corsa is not open source.
iRacing,2z6d0d,djfil007,1 point,Mon Mar 16 00:03:32 2015 UTC,"not ""open source""... but heavily modifiable (free cars, tracks, etc), which is probably what OP meant."

iRacing,2z6d0d,keem85,3,Mon Mar 16 00:36:42 2015 UTC,"So is it the community that makes this so popular?   I wouldn't phrase it like that. It's complicated to say what makes it popular in one go. For example, being the first (and the only for a long time) to have laser-scanned tracks certainly helped a lot. Also, being the only option for oval sim racing also helps making it popular, especially in the USA. Etc., etc.  You can say other sims have a wide choice of tracks, for example, but none with the fidelity of iRacing's. Not to talk down to any good modders, hell they gave me an infinity of hours of fun in many great a track, but there's not substitute for laser-scanned tracks in which you get every single bump on the surface.  That said, it's not necessarily ""the community"" that makes it popular but the ability to race 24/7 in a somewhat controlled environment. You can race in open/public Assetto Corsa servers but good luck with that because half the people can't drive and the other half will be driving the wrong way around the track just to make cool crashes. Your only alternative is to join leagues, which will have only one up to a few races a week at previously set hours. So what you thought was ""a great selection of cars and tracks"" will end up being just one combo a week because that's what that league is racing and if you want to race anything else there's no one you could race against. And so on.  iRacing's advantage is that you'll have good racing 24/7. Some series have races as often as once every hour, and they are pretty populated. Some more complicated cars (like fast open wheelers) will only have a few races a week, true. But that's still more than many if not most leagues."
iRacing,2z6d0d,hemibemi,3,Mon Mar 16 10:11:38 2015 UTC,"The graphics get a major upgrade this year and dynamic track surfaces soon also.  After a couple of years it doesn't cost much and you can get renew subs cheap.  Unless iRacing gets 100x more popular there won't be as many tracks as we'd like but at least those we have will be top notch.  Modded AC will likely be the new rFactor.  I guess iRacers like the continuity and knowing that iRacing are always trying to be more accurate than anyone else.  It's enough to of kept all the top sim racers on iRacing and likely to remain that way for quite some time.  Stick with it, move up and pick 1 series to focus some time on."
iRacing,2z6d0d,keem85,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:08:54 2015 UTC,Hey man. Your post caught my attention! How will iRacing get it's graphical update? Will it be much better? The reason I'm asking is because I'm playing it perfectly with my DK2 and SweetFX injection.. I'd like to know if iRacing will rank up the cost of my computer performance.
iRacing,2z6d0d,hemibemi,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:52:26 2015 UTC,Move to DX11.  I think iRacing will continue to support lower spec PC and will perform better than other sims who are prepared to cut out the lower end market.

DX11 is expected later this year I think.  Honestly I love iRacings graphics, they seem much more realistic in many ways.  I'm excited to see what they do with DX11.  Don't expect HDR and lends flares liek simcades though.  Finally we will also have day to night transitions.    iRacing is the best thing over the last few years and the long road ahead is likely they will remain so.  Jump on"

iRacing,2z6d0d,Sasken,2,Tue Mar 17 11:28:42 2015 UTC,"you can do a whole rookie class season with the free cars and tracks that come with the game.  There are also good options for cars in the D class series that are also free, you'll just have to buy a few tracks if you want to do the full season.   If you're using it to suppress the urge to go do real life racing, $100 worth of cars and tracks a year is incredibly cheap.  And you don't have to spend anywhere close to $100 if you don't want to,"
iRacing,2z6d0d,Sasken,1 point,Mon Mar 16 00:20:02 2015 UTC,I don't wanna sound cheap- I just don't wanna pay a lot for something I may cease at the end of my subscription... So there are more free cars available other than what I see initially?
iRacing,2z6d0d,Hindulaatti,2,Mon Mar 16 00:43:37 2015 UTC,"I would say yes. Everyone has invested those $100+ (often $1000+) so they value their time with the game and don't wreck people like in other games. Also, the game itself has a very strict and quite well implemented rules system which covers more than any other game out there. Plus, rank progressions is a motivator similar to RPGs (or even F2P games) and that is also very well made in iRacing.  Oh, and none of the above applies to the rookie series, since there's too many people who got in for free there. ;)"
iRacing,2z6d0d,itscrizzy,5,Mon Mar 16 05:30:27 2015 UTC,"The difference is, you're going to have to spend a fairly large amount of money up front in order to race anything outside of Rookies.  That's just the facts. Yes, there are ways to race a little bit outside Rookie without buying anything, but not if you want to race every week.   It's by far the most expensive way to feed a simracing habit. But it's also the best online racing experience I've ever had. So to me, it's worth it."

iRacing,2z6d0d,keem85,2,Mon Mar 16 00:18:53 2015 UTC,By which you mean the course cutting penalties and such?
iRacing,2z6d0d,andywade84,3,Mon Mar 16 00:44:16 2015 UTC,"The license system (safety rating) goes a long way to weed out bad drivers, along with irating (think of it like a ladder) to promote consistent wins and fewer incidents.  The cost is initially high, but once you've found what you like and you've bought it, the ongoing monthly price goes down (because you get credit for doing races most weeks, and because sales come out so you can take advantage of 2year+ subscriptions with bonus credits).  If you bought all the cars and tracks and then stopped playing after 2 months, yes it's expensive.  If you bought all the cars and tracks and played for 3+ years, it's some of the cheapest entertainment you can get and certainly the best racing experience you can get. Racing means racing against other humans and improving yourself. iRacing's seasonal setup and sessions is worth just as much as the simulation physics itself."

Would you say iRacing is good for that or would I be able to get that experience or a better one through a different game? I love forza 3 but am always looking around for others for either pc or xbox."
iRacing,2z6d0d,tomolart,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:13:13 2015 UTC,"The thing about iRacing is that the cars and tracks they have are varied enough (in my opinion) that you can satisfy yourself with specific cars they have - even though they don't have many cars [compared to other racing games].  So for example if you like open wheelers, they have star mazda, f1, skip barber - and those cars are significantly different in driving style and handling characteristics. And the guys who race them and choose the track rotations generally pick tracks that suit the cars.  The closest thing to autocross is charlotte road course, but this isn't run in any official races AFAIK. The seasons are road courses and oval. The ""newbie"" series with the MX-5 generally run smaller tracks like Summit Point.  There are enough ""slow"" cars that may suit what you like. The MX-5 is a fantastic starting car, the Solstice and Jetta are a bit different but still slow.  If you described what you specifically like about cars (stiff suspension? soft? mid engine or front? tons of power? scary understeer or safe understeer? scary oversteer or safe oversteer?), I may be able to recommend something that suits what you like.  (or you may be like me and end up falling in love with most of the cars once you've had a taste for driving them fast)"
iRacing,2z6d0d,RileyF1,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:41:28 2015 UTC,To get most realistic I would be looking for a front wheel drive car with moderate power and a beefed up suspension (to simulate my personal autox car)   So what I gather is typically a person will find a car or a few that they like and stick with it? Like in real life?
iRacing,2z6d0d,rancer890,2,Mon Mar 16 01:58:53 2015 UTC,"FWD cars are the Jetta and Kia Optima.  Maybe check out a few youtube vids, like here is the Kia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfctoT3UpUU  and here's the Jetta: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x82EH6N204  Most cars are RWD and front engine in iRacing. But differing their weight, power, suspension, aero means something like the Corvette is an entirely different beast to the BMW Z4 or V8 Supercar.  That Kia course is one you'll see a lot of actually. And the Cadillacs run a series with it (but are faster).   So what I gather is typically a person will find a car or a few that they like and stick with it?   Most people do that, yeah. But there's lots of people like me who have lots of cars and tracks and just race whatever they feel like and float around to anything. Sometimes the GT3 track sucks or I have IRL stuff and can't race official series so I do something else like Spec Racer Ford or Lotus 79.  /edit  I should also mention leagues are a huge thing in iRacing. Think of them as guilds or clans. Join one with some guys that you can get along with, and they'll host their own races with their own schedule and their own rules. Find one you can fit the races into your IRL schedule and you'll have a blast. Lots of guys only race leagues and don't touch the ""official"" game races anymore. There's leagues where they do ONLY endurance races, or ONLY do specific cars, or leagues that mirror the official seasons but make slight alterations for whatever reason (sometimes to just stay away from poor drivers). You can be in tons of leagues at the same time and you can always race the official iracing seasons whenever."

iRacing,2z65v1,lettuceman44,1 point,Sun Mar 15 22:48:43 2015 UTC,"I cannot speak for the thrustmasters, although I hear the belt driven does feel less ""chunky"". Not sure if that's the best way to describe it. I have the g27 and I love it but it does feel like gears. From my research though you are getting better pedals and an H shifter on the g27 and for me that was the sell point. I love having all 3 pedals and I race oval so the H shifter is a huge plus for me. From some one who owns and uses the g27 daily, I definitely recommend it as a budget/starter wheel."
iRacing,2z65v1,SockShots68,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:27:00 2015 UTC,"TX vs T300RS:  T300RS has a better wheel, and may have a slightly revised base (not sure about that). A Ferrari-branded equivalent addon wheel can be bought to replace the TX's stock wheel for ~$110. While the TX's stock wheel is inferior to the T300RS, whether it's $100 worth of inferior is up to you. If the TX's cheap wheel is game-breaking for you, just get the T300RS. Their bases are mostly identical and will provide the same FFB.  The T500 is an older wheel and there isn't any real point to getting it. It has stronger, but not necessarily more precise FFB to the T300RS/TX. It does have a clutch pedal, though.   TX vs G27: Quote from a sim racer who upgraded from G27 to TX:   > When I moved from G27 to TX the driving feel was dramatically improved.   No contest, TX. The TX is a far better wheel than the G27. The belt-drives eliminate the notchyness of the Logitech wheels, and the FFB will be stronger and more precise. Belt-drives provide a much smoother, more analogue response than the mechanical, digital-like response of gear-driven wheels.  The G27's only advantage over the TX is that it has a clutch pedal. The shifter unit is toyish and most users, as I've read, end up forgetting about it quickly because it has a lot of issues registering gear-changes, and just feels cheap overall. Do not buy the G27 because of the shifter unit. Thrustmaster and Fanatec both offer vastly superior units that function both in H-pattern and Sequential modes for ~$100-$200.   The clutch pedal itself is of limited use in iRacing, however. The vast majority of the cars in the game use sequential or automatic gearboxes that don't require clutch use, see here for a complete list. For the few that do just use a button on your wheel, this is just as competitive (if not more so) as using a clutch pedal, though you do lose some immersion.  I compare the G27 heavily to the Audio Technica ATH-M50s. The M50 was the king-of-value when it was first released (I believe 6-8 years ago now). At the time, it generated an enormous hype-ball and they have been parroted monastically as the best budget headphones to this day. In reality, in the 6-8 years since their release, many better, similarly priced headphones have been released that beat out the M50s wholesale. But because the M50's have this self-perpetuating reputation, they continue to sell gangbusters, while better options are ignored.  Similarly, the G27, and its almost identical predecessor, the G25, were acclaimed at their release. Unbelievable value for the price. At the time, belt-wheels either did not exist, or only in very limited supply, so gear-based wheels were king. In the many years since the release of the G27, technology has significantly evolved and belt-driven wheels are commonplace enough to have significantly dropped in price. Now wheels like the 911 GT by Fanatec and Thrustmaster's TX are priced identically, or at least, very closely, to the G27, while being significantly better in every respect. The G27 continues to sell because of it's huge, self-perpetuating hypeball, but it is now aging technology and the price has not dropped much to compensate. A G27 for $150 might be a decent deal, but again, you're buying decade-old tech.  Tl;Dr, the G27 is getting very long in the tooth. If you could find one for $100-$150, you'd be getting a fair price, but paying the list price of $230-$300 for one is unreasonable when the TX is vastly superior and is only slightly more expensive (~$300).  The only significant features the G27 has that the TX lacks are mostly irrelevant for iRacing: the shifter unit is cheaply made and toyish, and can have issues with actually detecting gear-changes. The clutch pedal, while nice, is also mostly irrelevant in iRacing where most cars do not require clutch use.  If the pedals are a huge deal for you, just save up for some Fanatec load-cell (CSR Elites), or hydraulic pedals. The TX pedals are not that great, but the G27's pedals aren't amazing either, they are potentiometer based just like the TX."

By the way, there's also an F1 styled wheel for the TX as well, in addition to the Ferrari GT wheel. Thee wheel addons are also compatible with the T500 and T300."

iRacing,2z46n9,Strice,2,Sun Mar 15 17:51:33 2015 UTC,iRacing has by far the worst sound but the others have significant faults as well. Assetto Corsa sounds like they have a microphone inside of the gear box and the engine sound is turned way down and Project CARS is very digital and unnatural sounding. You can actually hear each time it loads up a different sound file for a certain gear.   As for graphics I think CARS looks the best.

iRacing,2z2yxf,fistfulofbottlecaps,7,Sun Mar 15 02:03:30 2015 UTC,Try to find an used Logitech Driving Force GT online.  That's what I did when I started and I think I paid 70 bucks for the wheel and pedals.  I've since upgraded the pedals but after 2 years the wheel is still going strong.
iRacing,2z2yxf,DiscGolfer947,5,Sun Mar 15 02:22:47 2015 UTC,This I have heard is the best entry level wheel. But if you're willing to spent a bit more the G27 is an all around better product.
iRacing,2z2yxf,Ruf_racer,5,Sun Mar 15 02:26:44 2015 UTC,Same here. Using DFGT wheel and CSR elite pedals and I'm competitive with them. And triples.

iRacing,2z2yxf,Sasken,1 point,Sun Mar 15 03:48:10 2015 UTC,"Wheel + pedals definitely make the game more enjoyable. Whether a shifter does is debatable. Using a shifter is more realistic, especially on the lower-end cars. But the majority of drivers shift using paddles, whether it's realistic or not, because it's faster and easier.  So in my opinion, don't worry too much about a shifter. But you definitely want a half-decent wheel and pedals.  The G27 is the most common wheel. I use one, and it comes with a shifter but I don't even have the shifter plugged in anymore. I just can't get consistently fast with it, and I'd rather be competitive than realistic."
iRacing,2z2yxf,Gutsyisland,1 point,Sun Mar 15 03:12:22 2015 UTC,Yea even in oval most of us don't use the shifter. The G27 shifter is also notorious for not clicking into place half the time so it'll make play around to find the gear. It sucks cuz I'd totally use it but it's just not fun to use.
iRacing,2z2yxf,Silencer42,3,Sun Mar 15 03:54:47 2015 UTC,"My G27 shifter works perfectly fine, I never had an issue finding the gears. Maybe something is wrong with yours?  In some cars you have to do rev-matching to put in the gear, but that is something on the software side not the hardware side.  IMO racing with the h-shifter is a much more immersive experience."
iRacing,2z2yxf,Sarstan,2,Sun Mar 15 11:17:06 2015 UTC,"I thought that issue was just me. Sometimes I'd shift and the damned thing wouldn't recognize it. I'd have to push in the clutch and pull it out and shove it back in before it'd work again, by then losing a second or two off the pace. After some time, it rarely happened, but when it did I'd be extremely pissed and lose my concentration just trying to get the car to run right. Past that, I love my G27. It is definitely worth the price, but I can't say I've tried other pedal/wheel combos to compare."
iRacing,2z2yxf,Hindulaatti,1 point,Sun Mar 15 05:16:07 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with G27.  iRacing has some sort of lag in shifting with h-shifter sometimes. Never happens in any other game (except those that actually have a shifter lag but you can tweak .ini to get it away).  iRacing also doesn't change gears sometimes with cars that have a sequential shifter. For example, grab the caddy and try getting it in neutral when the car is moving."
iRacing,2z2yxf,RogueRAZR,2,Sun Mar 15 17:04:44 2015 UTC,The only car I find where the shifter has been absolutely necessary is the Lotus 79 so far and that's a Class B car so you don't need to have a shifter for a while.   Although having the shifter in the Miata and Solstice and other cars that would normally have one is very nice.
iRacing,2z2yxf,jjhassert,-1,Sun Mar 15 05:09:59 2015 UTC,Down vote because I race the 79 with paddles
iRacing,2z2yxf,RogueRAZR,1 point,Sun Mar 15 20:52:20 2015 UTC,Well to each their own. I just find it easier with the shifter. Props on using the paddles though takes good timing.

iRacing,2z2yxf,ztherion,3,Sun Mar 15 06:07:51 2015 UTC,"No, most modern race cars have a sequential instead of an h-shifter.

iRacing,2yyswn,jaymobe07,3,Sat Mar 14 19:19:34 2015 UTC,Practice a bunch before you go out into a race with real people. You dont want to ruin someone elses race if you are still trying to figure out the car and the track. Setups really start to take a big role in once you are out of rookie and D license.
iRacing,2yyswn,Wonspur,1 point,Sat Mar 14 00:55:03 2015 UTC,This.  I usually practice few hours.  Then run time trials with ghost car.  Then race.  That's my road formula.  In ovals I just race unless I'm messing with a setup but I'm very comfortable with ovals
iRacing,2yyswn,jaymobe07,2,Sat Mar 14 19:31:48 2015 UTC,"Setups are a big part of iracing, but fortunately there are both plenty of guides and plenty of folks in each car, in each series, that post setups each week of the season. Really all you need to take into account is that you should focus first on finishing races as cleanly and as competitively (in that order) as possible until you truly feel comfortable enough to push yourself to the limit.  Tyre wear is definitely a factor in this game, but it's not as scary as it sounds. Fuel is a really fun metric to play around with; if you spend the entire race in someone's draft you'll actually use less fuel than if you spent the race trundling around by yourself. This actually saved me from running out of fuel in the GT3 at Road Atlanta, had I not been in the draft for over half the race I'd have been royally screwed on fuel.  I went from GT5 on PS3 to iRacing, and to be honest, yeah there's a big curve. But if you're serious about sim racing, the payoff is absolutely worth the effort you put in."
iRacing,2yyswn,Velocirapture_Jesus,2,Sat Mar 14 00:18:28 2015 UTC,"What other people here said is all true but one thing worth pointing out is that when you start out with the rookie licence you have access to series that use fairly easy car to drive. In my case having those cars that are easy to drive helped with the learning curve.  Also a small tip, even if you come only for one type of racing (oval or road) give the other one a chance, I came in expecting to do only road racing and now I'm A licence oval and only D licence road."
iRacing,2yyswn,fingalum,2,Sat Mar 14 00:58:15 2015 UTC,"One of the most difficult things for me to adjust to after playing Codemasters games to iRacing is the fact that it's completely different to drive. While going hot into corners is the way to go fast on simcades, if you drive like that you'll get slaughtered even in the lower splits in the MX-5."
iRacing,2yyswn,Joshanderson36,2,Sat Mar 14 02:51:09 2015 UTC,It's not a game.
iRacing,2yyswn,WinstonBucksworth,2,Sat Mar 14 10:16:33 2015 UTC,I would strongly advise you to consider it a hobby. Its a tough simulator with a few assists mostly related to manual shifting.

iRacing,2yyswn,beezel,1 point,Sat Mar 14 05:01:03 2015 UTC,"I came from playing grid Autosport to Iracing this year and yes it is a big change but if you're serious about your racing it's definately a change for the better. I built my rig up with the console so I was already using a G27 and gameracer seat when I made the change.  The biggest difference for me is all about patience. In almost all console racers you have about 3 laps to get to the job done so every little gap has to be seen as an ""opportunity"" in Iracing you've got at least half an hour to size up your opponents and plan overtaking accordingly. I find at the start of the race it's easy to spot people that are still stuck in the ""grid"" mentality."
iRacing,2yyswn,CrashMatt,1 point,Sat Mar 14 09:53:03 2015 UTC,"iRacing is a great sim and easily has the best multiplayer for a simracer, but if you are just getting into simracing I wouldn't recommend it as the first one to try. Do you understand the costs involved in really getting into this sim? Buying all the content for this game (which you don't have to do at all) will cost you over $500 and if you don't keep paying your sub, you cant use that content. If however you are into oval racing. iRacing is the only one out there that really gets it right.  There are some other really good sims out there that don't have quite the same quality in multiplayer but the driving physics are arguably better and will give you a really good intro to the hobby that is simracing without having to invest too much money into iRacing to fully experience the thrills of it. Game Stock car Extreme, Assetto Corsa Rfactor2 are all really good (my personal favourite is Assetto Corsa) and are probably a better way to get into simracing.  You don't need to take ANY racing data into consideration in the early series as most of the races are 'spec' series where everybody gets the same car with the same setup.  Get a Wheel as well, Logitech DFGT is an acceptable entry level wheel."

iRacing,2yyswn,True_Racer,-3,Sat Mar 14 15:00:59 2015 UTC,"Yes it will be too hard. No it won't be fun.  What you need is something more forgiving to practise on and I would recommend Assetto Corsa using street cars first. Then, when you get better, you can jump into the racing cars in that same game. Only once you can handle those would I suggest switching to iRacing.   You should know that iRacing used to be called ""ice racing"" for a reason. It has gotten better, but still not as good as Assetto. iRacing needs a real world scale FOV to feel comfortable, and that requires triple screens or a TrackIR equivalent or a VR headset."
iRacing,2yyswn,wmahan,-3,Sat Mar 14 00:22:56 2015 UTC,"I can't say I agree with this. While it definitely is DIFFERENT, I wouldn't say it's ""too hard"" or ""not fun.""  You just have to understand that going into a race in iRacing is a different beast than on GT3 or Forza or whatever. You really can not push your way to the front (save for plate races, of course), and you have to realize that above all else, do not be the one to cause incidents.  It is entirely possible to have bunches of fun! Just make sure you know what you're up against."

At that time, teams may start being registered for the session. When the session launches, that's it. No more teams can register, only drivers can (joining into teams which were pre-registered).  Qualifying will occur during the week leading up to the event, again assuming they follow the Daytona structure. Anyone can qualify under any banner in any car they like, but on race day when the session launches, your team will be gridded for the race using the fastest Q time set by any of the drivers who are already registered with your team for the race. This means someone who is a team member and planning to join later in the day but who is not ""fully registered"" for the EVENT when it launches will NOT contribute to the team's iRating average nor to the qualifying time (but may still later join the race with that team and drive laps).  There's nothing officially to be done to make your spot in the race until right before the event actually happens.

iRacing,2yynu1,ProdigyInventor,1 point,Sat Mar 14 01:26:16 2015 UTC,"There is a good youtube video made by iRacing that really goes over all this. It was uploaded by iRacing official so it's really easy to find with a quick search.  Basically, whenever the car stops in the team's stall, every team member can see a button to remove the driver from the car where you would normally see race, grid, etc. If someone presses that, the current driver gets pulled out and the car sits in the box with only the team name showing on the relative screen. Then one of the team drivers clicks the green button again (which now says Race) and they become the driver. This is done whenever the teams choose to do it.  In most team races there is a requirement that at least 2 or more drivers take part and there's often a minimum required distance each driver has to do to satisfy the rules. It can vary from series to series."

iRacing,2yxb8g,jtblion,4,Fri Mar 13 16:39:35 2015 UTC,Whatever you can find on craigslist.  The Logitech G27 has often been on sale recently (Amazon and other sites) for around $199 - that's entry level.
iRacing,2yxb8g,midlifemomo,2,Fri Mar 13 16:49:12 2015 UTC,"Logitech MOMO and DFGT are at or slightly below this price range, but they're two good ones. I've used a MOMO for close to a decade now and it's been a solid wheel. DFGT is superior to the MOMO in most ways except the MOMO has actual paddles instead of just buttons, if that's a big deal for you. DFGT is like 2x the cost of a MOMO though.  If you can save up another $100-$150, or wait for a sale, you could get a Thrustmaster TX or T300RS. They share the same base, and it's one of the best on the market (TX's wheel isn't the best, but it can be replaced). It's miles ahead of all the Logitech wheels (G27,Momo,DFGT) because it's a servomotor with a belt. Logitech wheels are geared which makes the FFB less precise, weaker, and gives them a ""notchy"" feeling.  IMO if you're looking for a low-cost wheel to test the waters or are new to racing, get a MOMO cause they're very cheap (~$80-$90, vs $150 for a DFGT) and good enough.  The MOMO's low steering lock actually makes it well suited for F1 and other open wheel racing. If you are still playing a lot after a year or whatever, put the money you saved on getting the MOMO cheaply into getting a TX/T300RS."

iRacing,2ysnd7,kingsfan7205,2,Thu Mar 12 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"when you quit imagine your car is just sitting in the pits not moving, so it will make you end up in last place which is where the IR hit comes from. As someone else mentioned starting from the pits is a good way to try and avoid the calamity without quitting, if someone is gonna be an issue you can usually tell while you're catching up the them.   Since you're a rookie just go slow and be cautious. SR is all that really matters in Rookies, so if you feel like quitting early is your only option its not exactly the end of the world."
iRacing,2ysnd7,tstraw48,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"Cool,thanks for the info. That's what I have been sticking to as that's what literally all the tutorials say. I haven't been placing that good for finishes, but I also haven't lost SR in the last 4 races :)   Does being higher placed at the finish with no incident points net you more SR than if you were to say, get 12th with no incident points?"
iRacing,2ysnd7,Eburon,2,Thu Mar 12 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"No, SR is completely separate from race performance. SR is ONLY a calculation of number of incidents divided by number of corners, and it's a rolling average, so how many incidents in the last 1000 corners. The exact number of corners varies, and increases as your licence level increases. Also, for each licence level you increase, the SR scale changes so that R4.99=D3.99=C2.99=B1.99=A0.99. Check out this graph to get an idea of the CPI for different licence levels: http://i138.photobucket.com/albums/q247/JackB99/Safety%20Rating/CornersPerIncident.jpg~original.  iRating depends only on your finishing position relative to other people and their iRatings. Winning by 2 minutes will give you no more iRating than winning by 1 second assuming everyone else finishes in the same position.  Generally, people with high iRating will tend to also have high SR, because to get a high iRating you have to finish nearly all of your races well, so you wont be crashing out and getting a lot of incidents very often. But it's entirely possible to have a high SR with a low iRating."
iRacing,2ysnd7,sm2016,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:40:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for all that info. I'm suprised at how much there is to learn for this sim!"
iRacing,2ysnd7,Bakkster,2,Thu Mar 12 23:15:31 2015 UTC,"Nope, all that matters is the number of corners you turned vs the number of incidents you had. So if you finished a lap down you wouldn't get quite as much, but if you're on the lead lap it doesn't matter if you're first or last"

iRacing,2ysnd7,MaleficZ,4,Thu Mar 12 23:02:04 2015 UTC,"I would love if iracing created a few exemptions for SR. Particularly if you're hit from behind, or if a car is going below a certain percentage of your speed on track. I have to imagine they have the statistics to incorporate a few of these things. It wouldn't need to make everything exact fault, but even if every now and then you didn't get quite as screwed over."
iRacing,2ysnd7,sim-racingcouk,2,Thu Mar 12 15:38:35 2015 UTC,"The data's there, it's just impossible to make a better decision from it.

iRacing,2ysnd7,EyeLuvPC,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:32:57 2015 UTC,"Basically any circumstance will have a counter-instance. Most people can't even agree on fault in the real world, let alone give a computer rules to determine it without ever making a mistake."

iRacing,2yr5sf,Grimatoria,9,Thu Mar 12 02:54:22 2015 UTC,I'm confused by why people are always in such a rush to raise their SR and do it by racing slow and from the pits. I feel if you can't complete a race safely racing like a normal person you shouldn't be getting SR and deserve to still be whatever license you are.
iRacing,2yr5sf,Robot_Seizure,3,Thu Mar 12 13:25:34 2015 UTC,Well if you're in rookie its entirely possible that its not always your fault.
iRacing,2yr5sf,tstraw48,6,Thu Mar 12 18:14:02 2015 UTC,I completely disagree with this. If you can't get out of rookie with standard racing that is your fault.
iRacing,2yr5sf,Robot_Seizure,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:14:04 2015 UTC,"I also disagree, completely."
iRacing,2yr5sf,tstraw48,4,Thu Mar 12 19:19:15 2015 UTC,"I think you are refering to safety rating, and the only way is practice and patience!"

iRacing,2yr5sf,Tubbzie,3,Thu Mar 12 03:21:49 2015 UTC,"Start from the pits. For some reason there used to be a bit of controversy as to whether this was actually the correct thing to do in this situation but the short of it is that you'll avoid any and all turn one, lap one and most early wrecks. Then you've got the added benefit that if you do catch up to other racers, they'll usually be strung out over longer distances and not bunched up leading to a more likely crash.  Next is knowing when to give up position. If someone is faster than you, let them pass. If someone is being overly aggressive, let them pass. However, you'll need to learn when not to let someone pass. It's no good letting someone overtake you if they're only going to hold you up, be a danger and make you spend the rest of the race avoiding their terrible braking points. This will take time to learn but you will avoid wrecks doing it.  Drive safe, NOT slow. You're actually more of a danger being slow because that is the one thing a driver, especially another rookie driver, will not be expecting is a sudden slow car. They'll catch up to you faster than expected and take rash evasive action. Your best bet is simply to stay high, tell everyone you're staying high and focus on keeping it on the track. That is your only focus, you can't control what everyone else is doing, so just worry about yourself for now.  Run Races to gain SR, Time Trials take too long and Qualifying does too. Other than that it's just a grind, we've all been there and they're will be plenty more to do so as well. Just focus on driving safe and having fun. :)"
iRacing,2yr5sf,Speedly,3,Thu Mar 12 04:02:38 2015 UTC,"Short answer: no. Especially in the rookie ranks, it's almost guaranteed to work against you.  Also, Tanksyouverymuch is right, you're referring to SR and not so much iRating. Don't worry about iRating anyways though, just race what you can and try to learn how to anticipate crashes before they happen.  Believe it or not, I've correctly called crashes more than a lap ahead of time. You mostly need to pay attention and assume no one else knows how to drive.  Starting from the pits can help somewhat, although it makes for boring races."

iRacing,2yr5sf,Didarab0cchi,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:21:37 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the goal in rookie is to get out of rookie. Good luck and hopefully see you racing d class soon.
iRacing,2yr5sf,Retarded_Scientist,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:00:32 2015 UTC,"Sadly.  I'm getting about .20-.30 an hour, so once I hit 4.0 I'll be done.  About 10 hours to go haha"
iRacing,2yr5sf,davedontmind,2,Thu Mar 12 04:02:55 2015 UTC,"You only need 3.0 to leave rookies, that shouldn't take too long if you keep getting .15 per race. 4.0 is only necessary to fast track after you get out of rookies."
iRacing,2yojps,Fuzzwah,2,Wed Mar 11 14:43:10 2015 UTC,I wish they would implement offline practice. OR at least have a member page that still works during maintenance for practice sessions.
iRacing,2yojps,PTReese,2,Wed Mar 11 15:44:00 2015 UTC,"They've mentioned before they're working on this feature, it just hasn't been released yet."
iRacing,2yojps,Bakkster,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:17:10 2015 UTC,"The nice thing (until) now is that if you were in the server (practice f.ex.), you could stay there as it wasn't affected by the maintenance"
iRacing,2yojps,apfeltalk7,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:10:06 2015 UTC,I take it that this didn't work this time around?
iRacing,2yojps,apfeltalk7,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:15:08 2015 UTC,Well I didn't try it this time ;)
iRacing,2yrvvj,michinoku1,4,Thu Mar 12 07:58:54 2015 UTC,"It's always been like that so drivers have a chance to get some more SR or irating if they want. If you don't want to lose sr, race in the fun races."
iRacing,2yrvvj,RileyF1,2,Thu Mar 12 11:05:20 2015 UTC,I've gained 0.27 SR points so far. I think I can get to D this week. I'm super excited for it!
iRacing,2yrvvj,DeathHaze420,3,Thu Mar 12 11:26:54 2015 UTC,"Did some street stock racing for the first time in maybe a year. Finished a race with zero incident points and in the top 5 (no idea what split, but everyone finished but one guy). I don't know why everyone has such a hard time."
iRacing,2yrvvj,MaleficZ,2,Thu Mar 12 13:53:58 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, 2 starts on 2 separate tracks and I've got a grand total of 0x. But in those races I've avoided obvious wrecks where others whipped around a turn and still waited til the last minute to slam on the brakes while sliding into a pile of cars."
iRacing,2yrvvj,kaluh_glarski,1 point,Thu Mar 12 13:56:56 2015 UTC,"Its for guys like DeathHaze420 who are close to promotion. Not for guys like you, OP, that are ready for promotion, unless of course you feel like gambling."
iRacing,2yrvvj,tstraw48,1 point,Thu Mar 12 13:13:17 2015 UTC,"If you're just going for SR, start in the pits.   Avoid everyone.  You'll probably lose irating but at least you'll be promoted.  That's what I'm doing."
iRacing,2yrvvj,jaymobe07,1 point,Thu Mar 12 22:35:06 2015 UTC,"just wait for easy tracks, like Charlotte.  I'm sure some will find ways to wreck but it should be a lot easier then the slow tight courses."
iRacing,2yrvvj,xxdreamtheaterx,0,Thu Mar 12 23:58:21 2015 UTC,A- you don't have to race B- you will learn to just not race
