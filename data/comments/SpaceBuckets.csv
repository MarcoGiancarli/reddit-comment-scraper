SpaceBuckets,3e5oeg,Vrady,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:45:28 2015 UTC,Background: Standard bucket build with Mylar and 2 fans. Using a Ufo led light. Fox farm ocean Forrest soil. Nute burn?
SpaceBuckets,3e5oeg,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:47:03 2015 UTC,"Are these all the same strain? I see different issues with the top and right plant and would toss the bottom and left plant which does look like nute problems.  You fertilizer says it has bat guano but does not say what species of bat it came from. Some have high nitrogen, some have high phosphorus. Too much phosphorus could explain the bottom and left plant.  You're working with a pretty hot soil and sometimes the mixture can be a little too hot.  What's the run off pH?"
SpaceBuckets,3e5oeg,Keenaz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:03:23 2015 UTC,"Have you fed it with nutes already? you should just water for the first couple of weeks at least, give it a chance to come out of seedling stage. How often do you water and how low is your light? Also how are your fans set up? plants look very dried out, probably a combination of nute burn and too high heat."
SpaceBuckets,3e6atv,dr-pott,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:50:06 2015 UTC,"A bit more info. The strain is called purple bud and at the moment it's about 7 inches at its tallest. It's growing in canna terra plus under 4 23w daylight cfls. No nutrients have been used. I have used lst on some of the branches but I'm not even sure if I'm doing that right. So as the title says, any advice on what to do next from more experienced bucketeers would be very welcome. This includes advice on lst/scrog to when to flip to flower. Thanks in advance."

SpaceBuckets,3e3zh5,THCyasoon,2,Tue Jul 21 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"I have done a bit of research into finding a shorter sativa suitable for a bucket. Although I have not grown it myself (yet), Power Plant seems to be the best match.   Seedlings too far from the CFLs will definitely cause stretching. Plant your seedlings in a pot within the bucket. This way you can put stuff under the pot to bring the seedlings close the bulbs. With CFLs, you want them as close as possible without burning the leaves. It can be a pain in the ass to adjust the height of the seedling. Why not get a UFO?  The price comes out to about the same as CFLs and their sockets, wiring, etc. UFO LEDs have much better light penetration than CFLs.   One last thing, definitely only one plant per bucket."

SpaceBuckets,3e3zh5,Hyroero,2,Tue Jul 21 20:42:09 2015 UTC,"It's not really any faster honestly. You could just put a photo into flower as easily and get the same results.  Yeah you don't have to worry about timing but setting a light to 12/12 isn't really very hard.  With a photo you can veg as long as you want. Any problems you can just let it recover, complete control over when you want it to flower.  You can also take clones from a photo if you want and reveg after flower too.   Basically I have no idea why people think an auto is easier. If you can't plug in a light timer then you probably can't complete a grow any way haha.  Sorry if that sounds rude or anything I'm pretty blunt and I'm having a turbo rough day."

SpaceBuckets,3e3zh5,Hyroero,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:19:24 2015 UTC,"Basically agree with what's already been said, ufo is the way to go but cfls will work in a pinch.  Photo period plants work a bit better if you want to get the most out of your bucket because you can really train them using lst, topping and even main lining to control their height and make them fill the bucket out.  That said I'm growing an auto in mine right now and it's fine but there is no room for error and you won't get quite as much out of it in the end.  Either way grow what you feel comfortable with but most people would consider photo period plants easier to grow in many respects."
SpaceBuckets,3e3zh5,puttpoot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:37:04 2015 UTC,Really? to a newbie it seems like autos would be easier since there's no timing involved and its faster so if you screw up you can just start a new one...
SpaceBuckets,3e3zh5,demonyc666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:18:18 2015 UTC,Autos don't go hermaphrodite if you have light leaks which may be a concern to those who have a bucket that is not completely lightproof.
SpaceBuckets,3e35hk,winterpike10,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:19 2015 UTC,I generally use a 60W CFL for 1 seedling until they are big enough to go under my grow light.  Or you can just use your giant grow light at a higher distance using more power in the process =P  Note that the CFLs have to be close around 4 inches.
SpaceBuckets,3e35hk,Dudeyaman,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:38 2015 UTC,"I had a single 23w 5000k cfl with a homemade reflector and a little $7 walmart exhaust fan on top that sucked the hot air right off it and made it barely warm to the touch so I could get it super close to the plant.

SpaceBuckets,3e02hm,youngandstupiddumb,6,Mon Jul 20 22:35:33 2015 UTC,"In my experience don't go crazy trying to fix ph, just keep watering at the correct ph or even so a flush at the ph you want.  To flush just water in 3 times the amount of water that the pot would hold, really gets and salt build up moving and helps normalize ph issues that arise from nutes and the like.  Don't worry about over watering as that's more of an issue with watering to often not too much.  Especially when your plant looks like it's not having really bad issues yet.  As for when to flip just expect 3 times the current height! Some times it's less but I've had up to 3 if not more times the current height in grow, you can lst a little but its unadvised in flower unless it's super necessary.  I just dump my run off down the sink or into the garden, I wouldn't use it to rewater because of the extra salts and shit that have been flushed out. No expert on that one but that's my reasoning."
SpaceBuckets,3e02hm,Hyroero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:48:40 2015 UTC,Great! I figured it would be better to just keep feeding like I am. I checked today and they already look happier and are really starting to bulk up. Probably flip at the end of next week.   Thanks for the advice!

SpaceBuckets,3e0nes,demonyc666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:43:04 2015 UTC,"Since I'm now in possession of two buckets (one standard 10 gallon bucket build and a 75 litre bin build) and was only using one I thought I would start a second grow.  This time around I've bought some seeds (grow #1 was bagseed and I got lucky in getting a girl) so I'll be growing a feminised Blue Mystic Auto I got through Herbie's.  Here's a quick rundown of what I'll be using: Strain - Femenised Blue Mystic Auto Bucket: 10 gallon w/ 180w UFO LED and 5050 led strip side lighting (not using the strip currently) Medium: Soil - Debco Organic Mix (this is what I used on grow #1 and seems to be the plainest soil I can find) mixed with 30% Perlite. Nutrients: General Hydroponics Flora Series + CalMag mixed with tap water pH'd with saliva pH strips (I have a pen but I need to calibrate it properly)  This is my first time growing an auto and I'm worried that the setbacks that I experienced in my first grow will kill my yield with an auto so I've been doing a bit of research about the differences in growing auto vs photoperiod.  For this reason I decided to plant my germinated seed (started germinating on Saturday in a covered bowl with some wet paper towel) directly into it's final pot (to avoid the transplant).   I read somewhere that you can use a cup with the bottom cut off to simulate a smaller pot and simply pull the cup away once the seedling has rooted properly. I also cut a slit down the side of the cup to make sure it's easy to remove.   Now here's hoping she pops out of the ground sometime soon!   Again, I appreciate all the advice and everything I've learnt being a part of this community.   Cheers,  Berk"

Unfortunately if it is nute burn, and that's what it looks like, there isn't much you can do.  I would continue to water as you are already doing and hope it pulls through. As it establishes itself it will become more resilient and cope better with high levels of nutrient in the soil.  I'm not sure if there's a specific remedy to planting a seedling into a 'hot mix' because I've not had to deal with it."

Even though it's my first grow and I can't get the bucket temp under 32 C, it's growing like crazy. Still, I won't grow during hot summer months again because I don't want to spend a lot of money on air conditioning.  As for my setup, I'm using CFLs - 3 are 27W, one is 36W. There's a glass shield (per Ekrof's tutorial) that helped me reduce the heat significantly and I'm using one intake fan with an Ultra Kaze to pull hot air outside. I'll soon upgrade the Kaze with a DIY carbon filter.  The only problem is some purple discoloration that I noticed on fan leaf stems this afternoon. From my research it could be phosphorus or magnesium deficiency or, more likely, nothing. One area that could use improvement is PH. I measured it yesterday for the first time and runoff is around 7. I'll tone it down a bit with some PH- solution and introduce flowering nutes in a week.  If the purple color is due to a deficiency, I hope it will take care of it. But the plant's growth is pretty wild and it may as well be nothing."

SpaceBuckets,3duvgb,Green4Jesus20,2,Sun Jul 19 20:15:06 2015 UTC,Ok. Step one. Get a 5 galsmartpot/bucket. Germ your seeds and get ready. Next grab a roll or two of led strips from amazon. What I would do about the top if I can't find a UFO light ( a must for anything over 2ft in my oppinion) that is big enough to comfortably snug in the top. Grab a peace of plywood and cut it to fit on like a lid. And mount a UFO in there. If you happen to use cfl lights ur going to need aluminum tape or Mylar lineing it but it seems fine enough for led than your gunna want to mount some pc fans or fans of sorts on the side and maybe find a way to stack it and get a carbon filter hooked up to it if u worried about smell.

It's starting to get a little stinky after the lights come on, so I'm running an air purifier and febreze plug in air fresheners throughout the house, as well as ona gel in the grow spot. It just smells oddly clean most of the time."
SpaceBuckets,3dt1gp,faxseedoil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:07:54 2015 UTC,Air purifier? Could you elaborate?
SpaceBuckets,3dt1gp,faxseedoil,2,Sun Jul 19 17:16:55 2015 UTC,It's just a small unit like this one.
SpaceBuckets,3dt1gp,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:51:21 2015 UTC,That's tight thanks.
SpaceBuckets,3dt1gp,2hardtry,3,Sun Jul 19 19:00:56 2015 UTC,I hope you're comparing notes with JDH https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/comments/3dsrj1/mainlining_33f_nugs_and_tops/  Whoever invests most in side lighting will win this bucket battle. A battle in which there is no loser.    That's my bold prediction.
SpaceBuckets,3dt1gp,faxseedoil,2,Sun Jul 19 12:14:04 2015 UTC,"I have been! It's been really cool following his updates. His plant is just a few days older than mine and seems to have similar genetics, so it's almost like I get to see my future plant when he posts. One step ahead of you, I ordered another 5m 7020 warm white led strip yesterday. I'm gonna call you Nostradamus, because your prediction is spot on."
SpaceBuckets,3dtp4y,J_Appleweed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:38:46 2015 UTC,I keep any of the Canna nutes premixed for no more than 10 days. Beyond that and things get unstable.  Have you got a 3ml plastic dropper to make life easier?
SpaceBuckets,3dtp4y,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:25:43 2015 UTC,"So it would be a good idea to scale back the portions for less water? Another question, Should there be some time between topping and starting LST?"
SpaceBuckets,3dtp4y,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:32:24 2015 UTC,"Ideally yes and having a good measuring device makes it less of a hassle.  Something like this works even better. The glass/rubber pipettes work more reliably than the cheaper all plastic.  I would start LS training the more established lower branches before topping. Then after I would give the newer, upper growth a week or more to establish itself before training it."
SpaceBuckets,3dt2mt,buckateerberk,5,Sun Jul 19 04:38:43 2015 UTC,"One issue that I have found with buckets or intracanopy lighting is the need to raise fertilizer levers as a whole particularly nitrogen levels in the flowering cycle.  As an example, as a ratio using 3 part General Hydroponics Flora series normally I could use 1 part grow (green), 1 part micro (brown) and 2 parts flower (pink). At elevated lighting levels I found I need 1-1-1 as the ratio instead of the 1-1-2 as recommended. (These are not NPK ratios in this instance, just the ratios of solution from the bottles themselves at an EC of 1.8 or about 1200 ppm as read off my meter- different meters have different calibrations so it's always important to give the EC number.)  Nitrogen is highly mobile in plants and there are enzymes (proteins) that will break down chlorophyll to get at the nitrogen in it. Ignoring carbon, hydrogen and oxygen a chlorophyll A molecule has 4 nitrogen atoms and 1 magnesium atom. The new growth area is the plant's priority at the expenses of older plant tissue. Enzymes are freeing up the nitrogen needed elsewhere.  The fact that there is no brown splotching or spotted necrosis makes me think that it is not a phosphorus or a significant pH issue.   Leaves turning yellow is normal in cannabis flowering but not quite this early to this extreme. Try bumping up your nitrogen levels a bit.  edit a few words"
SpaceBuckets,3dt2mt,SuperAngryGuy,2,Sun Jul 19 05:00:45 2015 UTC,This is an extremely educational and helpful response. Thanks for taking the time to reply!
SpaceBuckets,3dt2mt,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:10:25 2015 UTC,would you recommend using the General Hydroponics Flora series? I have considered getting some... I assume you don't grow in soil?
SpaceBuckets,3dt2mt,LEDwizard,5,Sun Jul 19 05:11:08 2015 UTC,"I do use it in soil and it has been my fertilizer of choice for almost 20 years. It was formulated in the early 1970's, they haven't changed the formula and it's still the world's most popular pre-mix complete fertilizer for a good reason.  If you go to that link it says it works for soil, soiless and coco (although with coco you may want to add additional cal-mag which GH also makes. I found no observable difference in soil one way or the other so I don't use it with cannabis).  I need consistency since I play with other variables so always I use GH and MiracleGro moisture control soil (at higher lighting levels I need a soil that holds more water).  But, you do have to pay close attention to the pH (I mix it up at a pH of 6.7-6.9 but no higher otherwise the calcium and sulfur can bind up) at an EC of 1.8. pH drop can be an issue. The 1-1-1 ratio is used from rooted clones through flowering at the same EC so it's really quite simple to use. If I notice nute burn I do a plain watering which can be very strain specific. AK-47 can take a lot of abuse, blue/purple indicas not so much as an example.  I use the above with every plant type that I grow making minor adjustments as needed."
SpaceBuckets,3dt2mt,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:28:10 2015 UTC,"Funny story, went to an estate sale last weekend, five seconds in to it I realized the person had been running a grow op in their house, they had HID lights, carbon filters, nutes, bags of coco, and the smoking gun was a case of 5,000 cigarette filters. Anyway, the clueless estate sale people had marked the 1 gallon GH trio bottles $2 each. I couldn't stop giggling as I walked out of there with those!"
SpaceBuckets,3dt2mt,LEDwizard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:03:58 2015 UTC,Damn....$2 per gallon is a steal.

SpaceBuckets,3dsrj1,JdH-AU,2,Sun Jul 19 02:37:34 2015 UTC,Those nugs will be huge so long as you maintain side lighting on them as they fatten out. I'm talking about all those flowers below the main canopy. Without direct lighting they'll be 'meh' popcorn growth. Light them up just right and you'll have fat buds top to bottom.  This could be one of those grows where 10m of strip lighting comes to play.
SpaceBuckets,3dsrj1,Bucketlink,2,Sun Jul 19 10:32:58 2015 UTC,I'm running 5m across the plant now. You really think I need 10m?
SpaceBuckets,3dsrj1,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:39:04 2015 UTC,Maybe. If that's what it takes to have strong lighting top to bottom. Could cause heat issues. But at this time of the year is that an issue for you?

SpaceBuckets,3dpskz,youngandstupiddumb,3,Sat Jul 18 07:07:32 2015 UTC,This is right after I let them loose from some LST. They responded well but I'm leaving town for a bit and down want to leave them strangled.  They are so short and bushy hahaha
SpaceBuckets,3dpskz,IcarusAscended,2,Sat Jul 18 07:10:01 2015 UTC,Any idea what strain? I'm liking the fact that they're really short and bushy in general. Makes them fit really well in smaller builds.
SpaceBuckets,3dpskz,Since_been,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:29:46 2015 UTC,They are white widow from ilovegrowingmarijuana.com. I bought them off an impulse awhile back not really thinking they could be any different from other vendors. I'm really happy with them so far and Ya the size is perfect for our types of builds. The inner canopy is crazy dense and I probably need to trim it soon or really lst alot. Not very many people have used seeds from these guys but I'll probably buy from them again next time just because I have no reason not too yet. We will see when flower comes which I'll probably flip to in 2 weeks. I've had Temps pretty high for awhile so they do good in that respect too.
SpaceBuckets,3dpskz,Since_been,2,Sat Jul 18 15:31:47 2015 UTC,They look great :)
SpaceBuckets,3dpskz,tinyplantas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:31:03 2015 UTC,Hey thanks a lot man. I was kinda worried because they are so short and didn't know if I was doing something wrong but they seem to be happy. Still trying to get my pH runoff up a little and then I think they will be a lot greener.
SpaceBuckets,3dpskz,tinyplantas,2,Sat Jul 18 15:28:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'm a complete novice but they do seem healthy looking, which is great. Look forward to progress pics"
SpaceBuckets,3dpskz,tinyplantas,2,Sat Jul 18 15:32:41 2015 UTC,Looking awesome dude! They are super bushy little guys - seems like you are pretty close to flip judging from the height of your setup. Excited to see the progress once you do.
SpaceBuckets,3dpskz,JdH-AU,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:06 2015 UTC,Yup I plan on doing it as soon as I can get my pH runoff where it needs to be. They have some yellowing but once that's fixed I'm ready to see what they can do. Gj on your plants so far man they are growing so fast!
SpaceBuckets,3dpskz,JdH-AU,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:10 2015 UTC,Thanks man. They seem to be loving my Mars hydro reflector led. I actually just bought a new smaller setup so I can have a veg tent and continuous grow. Will post pictures once everything arrives.
SpaceBuckets,3dpbwf,Skylarace,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:52:36 2015 UTC,nice build. Do you mean to let them grow in this bucket or you're gonna move 'em to theri own room when they become adults? :)
SpaceBuckets,3dof5t,Green4Jesus20,5,Fri Jul 17 22:50:12 2015 UTC,"Doesn't look bad at all. It will perk back up. I wait until the leaves droop near vertically before watering, occasionally, to encourage to roots to grow."

SpaceBuckets,3doxae,samoscratch,2,Sat Jul 18 01:33:28 2015 UTC,"Very compact dude, I love it.  Planning on adding any led strip side lighting? It's super cheap (like 20bucks or so) and gives a nice boost once the plant starts getting bigger.  Also about temps, just get a cheap thermometer/hygrometer (mine was actually 2 dollars) and keep it in the bucket to manage temps.  I have a fan speed controller and I'll turn a fan off or lower/raise the speed to keep the temps in that 26c sorta range."
SpaceBuckets,3doxae,Hyroero,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:31:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks,  I thought about the led strips but I want to give LST a try this time around, maybe in the future though.

SpaceBuckets,3doxae,Hyroero,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:51:27 2015 UTC,"Not sure why side lights conflict with lst, I lst and trained my last two grows and used side lights as do most other bucketers here it seems.

SpaceBuckets,3dolwb,BucketCharlie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:49:08 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell for sure, but those trichs look pretty clear. I can't give a prediction but I would suggest keeping an eye on them. You want most of them cloudy at the very least. I've read that the Amber indicates more CBD. So, depending on what THC/CBD mix you want, you let them keep going. I've also read that the sugar leaves tend to precede the flowers by around a week. So, a guideline might be that when the sugar leaves look how you want them, it's time to flush and harvest at week later.   Hopefully some other more experienced opinions show up here."
SpaceBuckets,3dlyp0,IcarusAscended,4,Fri Jul 17 10:06:57 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Welcome and how cool is it that we have someone from South Africa here?! I'm guessing as far as items that you need to order you mean lights, pots, soil, nutes? Buckets I'm sure can be found everywhere.    Luckily, even though it's easier for some of us to order these things, they aren't that difficult to make by finding the base ingredients. You can find nitrogen, potassium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus in base forms at most garden supply stores that will be more than fine to use vs having to pick up say, fox farms line or similar.    Soil can be made by looking up some of the more common ingredients and putting it together yourself vs having to buy happy frog or ocean forest blends. It may even be possible to find  light bulb adapters in the wild by scavenging broken lamps and the like from dumpsters in apartment complexes.    I hope there is an easier solution though and that someone here may be able to give you exactly the info you need. If not though, a little legwork and you may be able to do this still! Good luck!"
SpaceBuckets,3dlyp0,bacon_flavored,3,Fri Jul 17 12:07:34 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for the suggestions. Luckily I can get the materials for the soil pretty easily. Also the bucket.

I grew a plant though by my window and now i have enough for like a year ( i dont really smoke a helluva lot tbh but i really enjoy growing them). Anyway, the lights I too found to be the most troublesome component to source for a decent price. I did come accross 'futurelight' that sell quite a variety of LEDs so try them? Otherwise there is a guy in JHB who assembles grow lights and sells online - electroman.co.za i think."

On a package of fertilizer there will be 3 numbers like 5-5-5 or something- this is for nitrogen-phosphorus-pottasium ratios. You want a fertilizer that has a higher first number than the second number. This is a fertilizer made for vegetative growth.  Once your plant start fruiting out you want a fertilizer with a higher second number than the first number. This is a fertilizer made for flowering/fruiting."

SpaceBuckets,3dl4ve,AlwaysMedicated_tm,2,Fri Jul 17 06:56:27 2015 UTC,No urine for indoor gardening! You do not know the EC (electric conductivity). In my own testing I had to dilute urine 10-30 times depending on how hydrated I was to bring it down to an EC of 1.8 or so.  Urine also has sodium in it which can interfere with potassium uptake.

Human feces makes a good outdoor fertilizer. The issue you run in to is that it typically is not pasteurized so you can have parasite problems. It's sometimes called ""night soil"". Our revulsion to it is entirely a cultural thing.  Self composting toilets can produce high grade parasite free fertilizer."
SpaceBuckets,3dl4ve,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:49:40 2015 UTC,"Humanure is a hot topic in permaculture circles as well. Some people use it and some would rather stick to herbivore manure due to e-coli and other pathogens. If you don't treat it right you can get sick easy.   Urine seems to have less concerns and many apply it to their crops. I can see that being a problem in a closed system.   As far as keeping deer away, I'm doubtful. There are many hunters who stay in their stands all day and pee off the side and have had deer walk right up to their trees without being alarmed. I'd expect predator piss from coyote or cougar to get a better result."

If you put it under your UFO with no ventilation you risk roasting it.  The best thing to do would be to get a clip on lamp and have the plant under a single CFL.

SpaceBuckets,3dj3dt,enjoi577,5,Thu Jul 16 18:01:01 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm not a fan of food coloring if its petroleum derived.  The standard stuff you get in the supermarket is what I'm talking about.  There's food coloring that's plant derived and I suppose that would be OK.    Plants will uptake whatever's in the water (with exceptions, I'm sure), so I would expect that any color added, if in sufficient quantities, would start showing up in the plant tissue.   I say try it and see.  If it's the organic, natural kind of coloring, I wouldn't expect it to do any harm. So worst case, you'd be out some dollars for the cost of the coloring.   That's my opinion, at least."

Is it because the coloring is introduced to the cut stems immersed in water instead of through the root system before cutting??
SpaceBuckets,3dj3dt,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:09:33 2015 UTC,how do you explain colored carnations?   pH can often male make a difference with anthocyanins. Many cut flowers at retail often have dyes directly applied to the flowers themselves particularly longer lasting flowers such as some types of orchid.  It's a common industry trick.

Have you looked into those Tibetan salt lights? Instead of electrolytes, the have ions. They're also orange and interesting to look at. I have one but I need to move it away. Too bright to be on my night stand .   I also read in the past that the custom of sleeping a contiguous 8 is a result of the industrial revolution. Before then, it was customary for folks to get up in the middle of the night for a few hours and read or even visit with each other. You're just a pre-industrial kind of guy."
SpaceBuckets,3dj3dt,HubbleSpaceBucket,3,Fri Jul 17 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"There is no evidence that plants can uptake complex molecules. Plants have specific transport proteins for specific ions.  Even if the dye were to be uptaken by a plant there's the question if enzymes would break down the dye.  The color of a bud is determined by environmental factors (cooler temperatures tend to expose more anthocyanins, for example) and genetics."

SpaceBuckets,3dk4o7,matt_themartyr,4,Thu Jul 16 22:34:15 2015 UTC,"There's two types of growth in plants: growth through photosynthesis and acid growth. We don't want a lot of acid growth at first so we use more light overall or use more blue light (higher color temperature lights if using CFL).   Idk if it's to get to the sun or what.   Yes, the common thought is that plants in general evolved to try to out compete other plants which includes trying to get to the light source at the expense of other plants. This is part of the acid growth hypothesis."

SpaceBuckets,3dk4o7,Ekrof,2,Thu Jul 16 22:40:41 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, we'll help you out. The plants are not really growing in a good way, they're more stretching in search for the light.  First things first: you need to separate those seedlings, each plant needs its own pot. When you transplant them you can bury the stem to get rid of the stretch.  Make that bucket right away, you'll probaby want two SB if you are growing two plants."
SpaceBuckets,3dk4o7,Green4Jesus20,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:47:40 2015 UTC,If you don't have two pots just put something in the soil to separate the roots so you can repot them later. I used a cut up plastic bottle. But once they get beyond seedlings you should only have one per bucket.

SpaceBuckets,3dflm7,SuperAngryGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 02:42:52 2015 UTC,Start with one and keep it simple at first and get to know your system. If you're looking for a small production set up then you'll likely need a larger tent rather than a bucket but a bucket is a great way to learn.

SpaceBuckets,3dfx9t,enjoi577,4,Wed Jul 15 23:25:00 2015 UTC,"You normally want to prioritize a good exhaust for the most part. A single good exhaust can handle intake via passive air intake through simple holes in the bucket.  If you need something strong I'd probably suggest the type of fans bundled with carbon filters, if you search inline fan on eBay you should turn up some results. They can be pretty noisy though so one with a fan speed control would probably be preferable."
SpaceBuckets,3dfx9t,Hyroero,2,Thu Jul 16 00:27:02 2015 UTC,"Well ill try to explain this as best I can then.  Right now, my barrel has a hose (think vacuum hose) coiled around the bottom, with one end stuck through a hole I drilled. The hose has little holes in it to force air at the plant from different angles, that was my idea at least.  I know what you say is true, so let me ask you this, should I forget using a fan for intake and focus solely on exhaust?"
SpaceBuckets,3dfx9t,Hyroero,5,Thu Jul 16 01:29:21 2015 UTC,"Every one has a different opinion and none are really wrong. By all means give it a try and report back but from my experience air blowing over the plant doesn't make much difference.  You do need air to circulate but a good exhaust will make negative pressure in the bucket which causes it to pull air in through any passive holes you may have.  My current bucket uses a single 80 mm fan exhaust and one at plant level at intake. I've done grows with the intake off and only exhausting and there hasn't been any real difference. Controlling heat is far more important.  You also don't want to strong a fan blowing onto the plant, especially while it's small. Hope that makes sense haha.  In the end it's all about experimentation though so don't let me put you off any ideas you want to implement!"
SpaceBuckets,3dfx9t,Hyroero,2,Thu Jul 16 01:46:29 2015 UTC,"That actually makes totally sense... well eff, now what am I gna do with this hole I drilled for the hose! Lol, I suppose just tape it up. Think it'd be smart to use as a passive intake? I also would like to connect a carbon filter, so in my head I need tons of fans, but the way you make it seem, I could get away with just one big exhaust fan, and one inline to push air through the scrubber?   Your help is very much appreciated by the way, thank you."
SpaceBuckets,3dfx9t,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:01:36 2015 UTC,"If you check out /u/Bucketlink 's build like this http://i.imgur.com/AuBtk8x.jpg  You can see hes using a a single inline fan with carbon filter to exhaust a huge amount of separate buckets.  If you need to control smell a good exhaust hooked up to a carbon filter is the way to go, you can always just add a 80mm PC fan (1 dollar on ebay) as a small intake to blow a bit of air onto the plant as well!"
SpaceBuckets,3dfx9t,Hyroero,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:17:59 2015 UTC,"Iv been all over that guys build haha he's actually helpedn out in my current setup a bit.

I dont need to be stealthy or anything at all, as this plant is growing where I sleep currently, I'd like to have SOME peace.  Also, i know plants smells 10x that of the bud they make....would that smell permeate through the rest of the house or would it just smell up my room? I know its hard to say....I've noticed when I smoke with my door open the smell goes up the stairs but thats it. Sorry I'm just ranting and thinking out loud now.     The only reason why I don't want smell is to be considerate to others living in my house, they don't care in the slightest,  I just feel like if they get mad at me they can use ""the house reeks of weed all the time..!!"", against me lol."
SpaceBuckets,3dfx9t,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:39:06 2015 UTC,"Here's an anecdote to help you out.  Recently a friend came in to a large quantity of bud.  Let's say they found it on the side of the road in a bag.  I say that because that's what happened.  It seems somebody had just harvested and for whatever reason a bag of it ended up on the side of the road. Dead drop?  Dumped in an emergency? Lost?  I don't know.  Possession is 9/10 of the law.  It belongs to us now.  Anyway,  they shared some with us.  My SO brought it home.  It was in a zip lock bag and that bag was in a paper bag.  She put it on a table about 15 feet from the door.  As soon as I walked in, I could smell it.  It was in two bags.  I could still smell it.  When I opened the zip lock bag???  Whoooo baby!  Smelled like a skunk had sprayed in the house.  So yeah.  You're going to smell it.  If you're at all concerned, you need to come up with some sort of filter solution, either home built or manufactured."

I did not imagine this part would be difficult, however, this took about two days.  My first attempts by hand were poor and ended up snapping the drill bit (on the last hole) and the drill tap.  Both were unrecoverable so I just flipped the heatsink over and started over.  For attempt two, I got hooked up with a drill press.  These things are magical.  I also ended up watching a lot of YouTube videos about machining and drilling and tapping.   That is it for tonight.  Need to get some thermal paste and more solder!

SpaceBuckets,3dc9et,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:39:50 2015 UTC,"They serve a few purposes.   Mounting: I wanted a way to mount the heatsinks without cutting large holes into the lid.  Simply screwing the heatsink into the lid would severely hinder airflow.  Another alternative is Bucketlink's PVC tube solution however with four heatsinks, the required holes would leave little of the lid material so I had concerns about durability. Heat: Spaces the heatsink away from the lid for concerns about melty-plastic-problems Space: The LED drivers will be mounted above the heatsinks in path of the exhaust."

SpaceBuckets,3dc9et,Hyroero,2,Thu Jul 16 01:33:01 2015 UTC,It would have been sweet if you left a bit of a overhang on your LED top assembly so you could add a glass heat shield and on the center of the lid add an exhaust. No heat issues at all haha.
SpaceBuckets,3dc9et,Hyroero,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:24:06 2015 UTC,"I thought about this!  I'm hoping my design will have sufficient thermal management.

And since there will be a partition between the heatsinks and the main bucket, my wishful thinking is that the compartments will be somewhat isolated."

One caught fire 6 years later.  Fond memories.  For version 2 of the bucket you may try putting the heat sinks on the outside the of bucket for better thermal management. And with the work you've put in so far, don't use cheap Chinese LEDs. Use something like the Vero 18 and under drive them a bit."
SpaceBuckets,3dc9et,Shiveron,3,Wed Jul 15 13:03:24 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things I would do differently next time around.  I think because the construction and planning of this was drawn out from April and not continuous, there are a lot of things which don't make much sense as a result.  This one was a bit of a learning rabbit hole- learned about a whole range of general DIY skills and usage of materials which will be handy next time around (flatbarsflatbarsflatbars <3)    I recognize it would have been much cheaper to go with one or two high quality LEDs in terms of scaling the rest of the construction costs.  I'm also refurbishing a closed loop CPU closed loop cooler which would be amazing for this sort of thing for cooling and its also super compact!    For this bucket though, I can't really go back.  The budget has long gone out the window so dropping another hundred is really not appealing.  But the overall design is flexible.  To change the light component, I require only a new lid.  This will happen sometime in the future but not soon"

SpaceBuckets,3ddeoa,RadiumCabinet,3,Wed Jul 15 11:56:49 2015 UTC,You are at the upper edge of temperature at 90F but you're fine. 80F is pretty ideal.  That water timer is a high power unit more appropriate for an outdoor sprinkler system. It could be done if you also used drip emitters.  It's best to use zip ties over tape for long term reliability. If do you do use tape use Scotch Super 33+  You have a bottom end LED light that is not IP rated so very high humidity (+90%) is unpredictable. My guess is that the critical lighting components themselves are hot enough so it will not make much of a difference as far as condensation build up. You don't need a lot of light for cloning.

I discovered if I turn off the led strip the temp at the top of the bin is only 80F. 7020 led strips put out some heat.  I plan to use the water timer for 2 bins and split the watering with a double adjustable flow hose T joiner, so high pressure shouldn't be a problem. I was more concerned with low pressure because the water source gravity feeds. If that's no problem then great.  I have some electrical tape I could use to support the leds but it's white and blocks some light. I'll wait and see how well 4 rows holds up. My bin has very thick plastic so making new cuts and drilling is a pain - one stanley knife blade already snapped."
SpaceBuckets,3ddeoa,SuperAngryGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 03:27:33 2015 UTC,"It's not high pressure I'm worried about, it's if a high pressure device will work properly and consistently in a low pressure set up and if it will work properly with drip emitters so you can regulate how much water is being applied (drip emitters are typically rated in gallons per hour).  Use a cheap cordless drill to make your tie wrap holes."
SpaceBuckets,3ddeoa,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:01:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll experiment and see what works. There's always manual watering to fall back on.  Quick newbie question for anyone: I buried a seed a knuckle deep but later read the top of the seed should be just below the surface. The seed was already germinated but the root adds almost no height. Should I disturb it and bring it closer to the surface?"

SpaceBuckets,3da0hs,youngandstupiddumb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:41:53 2015 UTC,So everything's been going well besides some Temps that swing and hover around 90 during peak hours. Working on getting a better exhaust fan with carbon filter as well because these are starting to get a smell.   I transplanted into 3 gal smart pots with happy frog and fed with some Humboldt golden tree/ff grow big. This was around 5 days ago.   Then I topped and took some dying growth from the bottoms and anything that was just not getting light. Fed really good with some grow big and calimagic in a gallon of ph'd water that was around 5.9. Half a gallon each.   Everything looks happy and growing fast for all the trauma and I did some LST and it's been liking it but I've noticed a few things. You can slightly notice some yellowing on tips and then there's some small burn marks on the bigger broad leaves.  Some on the tips but a good few marks are midway down and midway out on a few if you look close. Just have a 180 marshydro about a foot away and also the 7020 strip lights you can see.   Any ideas? and next feeding will be today or tomorrow morning with just plain 5.8 ph'd water.
SpaceBuckets,3da0hs,Bucketlink,2,Tue Jul 14 17:49:01 2015 UTC,Why are you setting your pH so low? That kind of range is usually used for hydro. 6.5 is usual for soil.
SpaceBuckets,3da0hs,HubbleSpaceBucket,2,Tue Jul 14 23:10:40 2015 UTC,"Hey Bucketlink!  It's exciting having you comment, I absolutely adore your setup!!!    Now that you mention it I guess I got mixed up and thought maybe i was pH'ing too high.  The 2nd to last feed was around 6.5 and the run off was around 6.7.  For some reason I thought maybe i should try and lower it the very last time but, because I'm an idiot, I didn't even check run off.  I will dial it in today at 6.5 and see where my runoff stands.  Its been pretty consistent in the 6s so hopefully its nothing serious.  And is Distilled water not good or not as good as RO water?  I have been having trouble finding any RO water for some reason...  Ill come back with results after the feed.    Also, any thoughts on the rusty patch on the right plant's top set of leaves?  You can see some burnt tips but I am not sure they are related.  Thanks for your time."
SpaceBuckets,3da0hs,HubbleSpaceBucket,2,Tue Jul 14 23:43:59 2015 UTC,"6.5 seems to be the sweet spot for pH. If you threw it off enough last time you could be looking at a pH lockout which can be corrected by a flush.   If you can get your hands on some spring water, that would be best, IMO. It will have a lot of the micronutrients your plants will crave, unlike Brawndo. Distilled water could actually reduce the micronutrients in your soil since it is pure water, the most effective solvent on the planet. RO would be ok but unnecessary unless your tap water has arsenic or some other serious toxin in it. Letting tap water from a municipal source sit for a few hours to a day will sufficiently let the chlorine and fluoride degrade and dissipate."
SpaceBuckets,3d998d,JdH-AU,4,Tue Jul 14 14:26:20 2015 UTC,"You'll probably get different answers for this question, but I don't think you need to trim anything. Plant is pretty tidy of a giant sativa, and the buds are well exposed."

SpaceBuckets,3d998d,Ekrof,2,Tue Jul 14 14:41:56 2015 UTC,"If it is a true sativa (it is), then it will take more than 10 weeks of flower. I've seen 15 weekers...  Enjoy the ride!"

So far it does seem to be taking its time, I've just entered week 5 and I don't have that much bud to show for it!  Just wonder what to do with my feeding schedule... Just extend the full strength feed for a while?"
SpaceBuckets,3d998d,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:19:35 2015 UTC,"Oi mate! Thanks for these full pics these ladies are lovely. From those earlier top picks it looked pretty crowded but from these angles, they look great.   As for feeding, I'd slowly taper down from full strength seeing as its a bit hard to predict when it'll finish flowering. Could be four weeks could be nine weeks if that's sativa dominant.   Again, looking lovely. Keep us in the loop."
SpaceBuckets,3d8y8w,I_am_jacks_reddit,3,Tue Jul 14 12:49:54 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem running 5 CFL's so I pulled one out and that did help.  I now run 4 CFL's, 2x26w 6500's and 2x23w 2700's in each and both seem to run about 10-15 degrees (F) above ambient.  One has two 80mm fans (classic design) and the other has one 120mm exhaust fan in lid and 4 3""x3"" passive intakes.  I don't have a/c so I need to keep a close eye on temps.  I started with auto-flowers which seem to be fairly forgiving (32g first grow) with multiple mistakes.  There are all kinds of techniques on here for lowering temp but if ambient is high the bucket is high.   It takes some tweaking, experimentation, and research on this awesome site but that's all part of the fun.  Been reading here for months, soaking up knowledge and wisdom.  First post, awesome community and plenty of peep's willing to help."
SpaceBuckets,3d8y8w,MSgtRet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:59:48 2015 UTC,I will start by taking out one light. My first 3 grows will be royal queen autoflower northerlights. I would be happy with 10g from my first harvest. I'm starting out with the veg lights then when  it starts to flower I will obviously switch to flower lights..
SpaceBuckets,3d8y8w,MSgtRet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:11:44 2015 UTC,"I did the 6500's 24hr until flower then switched to 2700's 20/4hr cycle for first grow.  This time I'm using the above combination on a 18/6hr cycle (since sprouting) and they are doing better than my first plant. Same growing medium (coco/perlite) and nutrient schedule.  I did experiment a lot with lighting on first run due to heat issues and this is what is working for me.  If you have your bucket in a confined space like a closet, which mine are you need to remove the heat from there also.  Do your dark period during the hottest part of the day. Feminized Blue Mystic auto from Nirvana."
SpaceBuckets,3d8y8w,Hyroero,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:38:16 2015 UTC,took out a light and it dropped to 86f. but it dropped but not enough. i think the extra fan might be for the best. Right now i have my bucket just sitting in an open room just so its easier to check on and adjust things. my lights are 2700's and 5000's.
SpaceBuckets,3d8y8w,Entreps,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:15:54 2015 UTC,"My 5 cfl bucket needed 4 exhausts all located around the top and a single intake at the plant level.  The fans were 80mm pc fans from China for 1 dollar each.  Adding additional spacers when the plant get to close to the lights helped too.  Honestly if you can't make the switch to a led ufo I'd make a glass heat shield, search the sub for plenty of guides on that. Basically solves the heat problem entirely."
SpaceBuckets,3d8y8w,Entreps,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:06:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't add another exhaust, especially right across from your current intake. You'll basically be streamlining air in one direction, in and immediately out. Id recommend checking out doing a custom heat shield or adding another intake next to your lights to help cool them a little."
SpaceBuckets,3d8y8w,Entreps,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:11:29 2015 UTC,So it would be better to add a second intake a few inches away from my exhaust than to add a second exhaust a few inches away from my first exhaust?
SpaceBuckets,3d8y8w,JdH-AU,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:29:59 2015 UTC,you have to consider how the air will move in your bucket. If you have the exhaust directly across from your intake you can imagine the air just going in and out. Keep in mind that hot air rises and cold air falls. Ideally you'd want your exhaust higher than your intakes but it would be best to stagger them so that you won't have hot air pockets.
SpaceBuckets,3d8y8w,JdH-AU,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:43:54 2015 UTC,i shuld have made my self more clear. when i said directly across i meant across and above by a few inches. just below the lip of the bucket.
SpaceBuckets,3d8y8w,JdH-AU,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:50:56 2015 UTC,That would be most ideal.
SpaceBuckets,3d8y8w,JdH-AU,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:17:51 2015 UTC,I should have just enough room to put a second exhaust fan above my lights if that would be better.
SpaceBuckets,3d8y8w,JdH-AU,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:01:14 2015 UTC,What's the diameter and CFM rating on your fans? Simply replacing your outtake with a bigger / more powerful fan can help tremendously.
SpaceBuckets,3d80uf,buckateerberk,2,Tue Jul 14 05:58:06 2015 UTC,"Looks healthy, but a bit leggy.  I think next time you can train a bit better and fill the light space more evenly."
SpaceBuckets,3d80uf,Cdresden,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:38:57 2015 UTC,I know. grew kind of wonky when I started training but I defoliated a lot so that might be why it looks so leggy. it actually fills out the bucket fairly well.

SpaceBuckets,3d80uf,Bucketlink,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:23:16 2015 UTC,this is my first time so it's all a learning experience. I definitely had some setbacks that cost me some time. I wet the seed to germinate on April 1 so this is my progress so far. I'm not sure what expected yield will be but judging by what I've seen others on here get I should get at least an ounce dried.
SpaceBuckets,3d7v9i,QentS,3,Tue Jul 14 04:58:43 2015 UTC,That looks to me like the beginnings of a powdery mildew situation. Can you increase airflow though your bucket or move it to a drier location? You may wish to employ some of the common treatments.

SpaceBuckets,3d8bhs,bigfartsoo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:07:57 2015 UTC,I just placed my fans on the side of a spacer to exhaust while using the flipped fans in my ufo.  Flipped fans really don't exhaust much at all but it's better then blowing warm air into the bucket imo.  Just run some tests on the temperature but I'd try and get more exhaust then intake happening. Even just passive intake is enough while the exhaust is much more important for managing temperatures.

SpaceBuckets,3d4q0q,kwebber321,3,Mon Jul 13 15:52:22 2015 UTC,"I would say it depends. If you like DIY projects then the buckets will bring you a lot of joy. Plus we'll help you out :D  The tent will work great and will let you use a HPS bulb, resulting in a higher yield. But you may not be interested in that kind of scale yet. I recommend the buckets for begginers, they're a good introduction to many aspects of growing, from lighting to training.   I think a good move is to get a 180w UFO light and put it in a bucket with a single plant to learn the whole process. You can use that same LED with a small tent further along the road.  Cheers"

SpaceBuckets,3d5apt,Skylarace,4,Mon Jul 13 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"The potting soil looks dry.  Soil has a property called field capacity, which refers to how much water it can hold.  When you water a potted plant, you want to fill the soil to its full field capacity.  You want to water the soil until it can hold no more water, and water is running out the bottom.    If some soils get too dry, they will actually repel water, in ewhich case you can pour water in the pot, and it will just run out the bottom without being absorbed.  In such a case, you'll need to place the pot in a sink and add water periodically until the soil is fully saturated.  If you water a dry pot by only saturating the soil right around the roots, the rest of the soil in the pot will suck that water up.  The dry soil can exert more pull on the moisture than the roots of a seedling, so it never manages to get enough water."

Good luck."

SpaceBuckets,3d47i9,ViduTheDon,4,Mon Jul 13 11:39:15 2015 UTC,I think you really need to transplant already. That plant out grew that cup a week ago probably and your probably just root bound. It doesn't look that bad but it could be pH issues too. First transplant and then focus on getting pH down.

SpaceBuckets,3d0yp5,Ithinkandstuff,2,Sun Jul 12 23:53:25 2015 UTC,"Flooding the soil is fine, as long as it is allowed to eventually dry out. The main concern with over watering is allowing conditions which are favorable for certain fungi and pathogens to grow, as well as anoxic conditions which can harm the roots. As long as soil dries out a bit before being watered again, you should have no problem. A good heavy watering helps most plants reintegrate their roots into the soil after a transplant."

I was out of town for 4 days this past weekend (unavoidable trip) and when I came back the plant looked torched. I quickly gave it a huge drink of water. It perked up, but the damage was extensive. I decided to chop it before the sugar leaves could yellow further. I took it down a bit earlier than I would have liked. The trichs looked good, but I believe it would have filled out quite a bit more.  Oh well, first grow and learned a plethora of information. Currently popping a World of Seeds - Strawberry Cough freebie for my next grow. Going to attempt either a SCROG or intensive LST to increase yield.

SpaceBuckets,3d0ln6,JdH-AU,3,Sun Jul 12 14:37:21 2015 UTC,"Why 9 Bands?   Because marketing BS. What you're asking about is often referred to as a ""lighting recipe"". Looks at the best LEDs grow lights on the market like by LSG, BML or Philips. Their production lights tend to just have red LEDs (typically around 660nm), blue LEDs (typically around 450nm) and white LEDs (this is how you get your green component because green LEDs themselves are very inefficient). If you're off a little then no big deal.  The 730nm is typically referred to as NIR (near infrared radiation) in engineering and far red in botany or in name brand LEDs. Only on eBay is it called infrared or ""true infrared"" or whatever.  A lighting recipe can be different for different lighting levels, different plants and even different strains. Where the plant is in its life cycle also makes a difference. This isn't because of photosynthesis, it's because of the perhaps +1,000 light sensitive proteins (or proteins in the particular signal transduction pathway). The there three major groups we're most interested to initiate signaling are the phototropins, cryptochromes and phytochromes.   What's the best spectrum to choose?    I get asked this about once per week or two and generically tell people to use 1 or 2 parts red and 1 part white (say 3000-5000K). I wouldn't bother with far red in a light meant for a short day plant (no evidence it can initiate early flowering when red light is also being used at the same time in a short day plant).  BTW, blue is well known to initiate flowering in long day plants, a lot of research is done off a particular long day plant but cannabis is a short day plant and works differently. The long day/short day issue can cause a lot of confusion because people might read an academic white paper and assume it can also directly apply to cannabis."
SpaceBuckets,3d0ln6,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:07:18 2015 UTC,So no blue or is this implied by the white?
SpaceBuckets,3d0ln6,SuperAngryGuy,3,Mon Jul 13 03:23:43 2015 UTC,"Blue is also in white LEDs. The higher the color temperature the more blue light you'll get.  But, white LEDs aren't as efficient as blue LEDs because you take a efficiency of the phosphor hit (a white LED is a blue LED with a phosphor. However, we also have to consider do we want yield per watt (pro grows) or yield per volume (SpaceBucket grows). These are two separate metrics which can also play a role in a particular lighting recipe.  Damn good questions but you waded in to a quite complex element in horticulture lighting that is a very active research niche. I'm going to rapidly get things confusing because a lighting recipe may include trying to elicit a very particular response like increased anthocyanin production in red leafy lettuce.  Standard HPS is about 3% blue light for reference. Most high end lights are about 10-15% blue so they can serve as an all purpose light.  Go with a 180 watt unit with 1 part 5000K white and 1 part red. You'll see this in pro cannabis lights like by Bios Lighting. The 180 over a 135 makes up for the less efficient white LEDs. Since we want yield per volume going with a lower color temperature white gives more green which drives photosynthesis to occur deeper in leaf tissue. So 3000-5000K white."

They were out of pH down and he pointed out that I'd be less likely to need it if my water is close to neutral. The nutes tend to lower the pH and if anything, you'll need up to adjust it.  He also recommended a different brand of pH up as the ones I picked were more for hydro and tended cause salt accumulation. Never once did we talk about what was being grown but I think he knew.   As others have said though, if it's legal it won't hurt to mention it so you can get more appropriate advice."

(An auto would fit with the yellowing lower leaves.) I think I have read other posts stating that autos aren't really ideal for buckets. I may just be confused, and autos just aren't recommended for first time growers.  Do you have a guesstimate of about how much heat the extra 5050 lightring adds to the temps of the bucket? Any guess what a extra 7020 would add for increased temps?  Are all the lightrings warm white for veg? Or, do they make red spectrum lightrings for flowering too?

No smell just yet but I'm sure it can't be much longer before I need to hook up my filter.  Speaking of my filter, I have an issue. My bucket is no longer airtight because I had to resort to creating a false bottom and use a set of screws to balance the main bucket on.  I simply had no choice with the insane amount of stretching this plant is doing.   Given that the bud has started, I've upped the feed to 3/4 strength and will soon introduce a quarter strength PK 13/14, slowly building up to full strength three weeks from now.  I'm getting desperate about the stretch and have supercropped the main cola to hopefully halt its advance a bit. Not ideal during budding, but I had no choice. In running out of options here and I may yet have to put her outside on my balcony in the middle of winter (Sydney, AU - not ideal but no frost)."

While OP's build is neat, I visibly cringed when I saw electronics mounted inside 3D printed parts. This is a really dangerous, really bad idea, because 3D printed material has absolutely no mechanical strength, is very susceptible to heat damage, and is flammable. OP even proved how bad the idea was with his temp reading.

SpaceBuckets,3cos3f,Ekrof,3,Fri Jul 10 14:32:58 2015 UTC,I've checked the melting point of the plastic. I'm using PLA with a melting point of above 300F.

ABS is used much more for mechanical applications and can withstand a lot more heat.

SpaceBuckets,3cos3f,yeomanpharmer,2,Thu Jul 9 21:27:28 2015 UTC,Total build is about $120. I can possibly get it down to about half that for those who may want one.   Edit: cost of this build was actually around $150. The updated one removes the cake pan and heat sink which I found to be not as efficient as I had hoped. the 230mm fan sufficiently cools the LED assembly so that will be the sole form of cooling. Temps were at 105 in the areas not near the heatsink and I feel the heatsink impedes the airflow to the center rendering it near useless.   Since this prototype was absent of a heat shield that cost is going to add a bit to the next version. I currently have a heat shield on a separate spacer so I know just how effective the set up is in combo. In total I believe the second version will cost $200... Shipped ;)

SpaceBuckets,3cqnz0,Morrigan_Disapproves,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:18:10 2015 UTC,"Part 1.  It has taken a while to get all the parts, but finally, the last of my parts have shown up!  I've been playing with a few designs for the light top and this is what I've arrived at:  Link to new renders.    These models are available if anyone wants them for aided bucket planning.  I totally mean to put them together element-wise but that's not very exciting.   Mounting the heatsinks in PVC wont work here because with four mounting assemblies, the gaping holes would probably make the lid too flimsy. Instead, they are suspended from the lid by a long screw, washers and aluminum tubing as spacers. Rather than stacking the light top on a bucket, I'm using a pot lid.  The idea is motivated by it serving as in part a reflector and in part proving some partition between the main bucket. I've changed some smaller things from this set of renders, namely I threw out the EPS foam spacer/light baffle/ intake hood.   I'm discussing the renders first because the bucket itself is far completion!  But  Link to bucket WIP  Honestly assembly has been a huge struggle and I think the theme is: manipulating polygons is easier than power tools.  A few points:   Painting HDPE is tricky.  I've seen it mentioned a few times that the paint just scrapes off.  I did some reading on this and there's a solution: flame treat the surface [credits here].  I further used automotive adhesion promoter and krylon fusion paint, which claims to work on all plastic.  The claim alone, without heat treatment is false.  The end result is pretty amazing and I have zero concerns about the durability.  Highly recommended if you go the route of painting. I mounted the LED strips onto 1.25-inch x 1/16-inch aluminum bar, figured this would be some sort of heatsink.  Also spiraling it bothered me and I wanted perfect circles (heatsink justification was after the fact). The LED strip wires are done with adhesive lined heatshrink and silicon for water proofness [from here, minus fancy end caps]. The junction box mounting bracket is made with aluminum flat bar bent with a pretty poor jig made with painter sticks.  I'm super super happy with the result.  The box and mount feel solid."

SpaceBuckets,3cq38a,TheLaughingGarden,4,Thu Jul 9 21:34:29 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make sense. Depending where you live you can expect perhaps up to 6 hours of full sunlight per day as a year around average (clouds have to be taken in to account). This will be higher in summer and lower in winter. Here's a zone map for the US to give better numbers.  If you had a bucket that draws 100 watts for a 12/12 flowering cycle, that's 1200 watt hours per day. But, you also need a robust battery system and letting a deep cycle battery (you can't use car batteries- they are designed differently) go below 50% discharge will severely reduce it's life so you need to double or triple the watt hours per day of the batteries and the solar panels. You're now up to perhaps +400 watts of solar panels (I'm low balling it) particularly for winter time and depending on where you live.  You also need an appropriate battery charger and true sine inverter if not custom designing a low voltage LED lighting system or if using CFLs.  In the winter you may get 1/2 the daily light or less (it's called DLI in botany or daily lighting integral).  Can it be done? Sure, but it will be quite expensive for a bucket."

SpaceBuckets,3cq38a,Entreps,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:58:32 2015 UTC,With about 6 hours of direct sunlight and let's assume 150Wh for a spacebucket power consumption. Let's use 24 hours for veg. That's 3600 watts or 3.6 KW /day. You'll need (3-4) 285W solar panels. To cover the usage. The panels in normal conditions output 250W so that's 750W-1Kw an hour. With that said you'll generate 4.5KW-6KW a day. You'll also have to buy batteries. The whole set up would run about $2k so it's not really worth it. You need to generate enough power in order to charge the batteries for the night time and still be able to handle the day time use. I'm planning to installing solar myself on a house :p

SpaceBuckets,3cpiay,pro_skub,2,Thu Jul 9 19:03:21 2015 UTC,"I've been reading a little more. The cost of running a total of100w in lights for 12 hours a day comes to approx. 7€/month (this depends on the country you live in and your company, obviously, but that figure should be in the ballpark).  The only question then is what is the yield of the plant you keep inside to see if it's worth it. For example, one would need about 2 to 3 kg of cherry tomatoes / month to break even. I doubt whether this is feasible, as it sounds like a lot for a small plant.  I guess one could also switch the lights only at night (I think it's cheaper)"

So it's the plant that moves not the light.  After transplanting, when I'm training them out under the ring there's not much I can do so I fit lenses to the COB LED to focus the light in tightly. So far so good managing stretch, so long as I flip them over at the right moment.  I'm probably putting too much through the new Cree LEDs, I'm going to start making plans to reduce their output."

When you run the CXA @ 3A, you're only looking at ~30% efficiency.  A lot of guys run the CXA/CXBs softer, for greater efficiency (lower cost and lower heat).

SpaceBuckets,3cj08h,chillymoose,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:49:13 2015 UTC,You're absolutely right. I pulled the trigger and ordered these drivers before I'd captured all the facts. At 3A they make an impressive amount of heat. So much so that the heatsinks are untouchable after only 30 seconds without airflow. That won't do.  I'm going to build my own drivers and only put 2A through the CXAs. These 3A drivers can be saved for Vero 29s. I do have five heatsinks to put to work.

SpaceBuckets,3ch4so,Mearbert,14,Tue Jul 7 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"The axiom should be ""when watering your plant always do a complete watering"".   Some soils, particularly when very dry, are not very absorbent so to get around this add a few drops of liquid soap per gallon in the water and this will help lower the water surface tension making it easier for the water to be absorbed. You can see this effect by using a spray bottle and with the water that has a little soap added the drops are going to be a lot smaller.  I've seen this were a person will water a plant and water will be pouring out the bottom but a lift test will tell one that the water is just flowing through the soil rather than being absorbed.  I've honestly only seen a few true cases of overwatering to the point of root rot which is the danger from not having not having enough oxygen in the root zone. We tend not to get it because we grow at higher lighting levels. Root rot is usually fatal and the only time times I've personally seen it is when it was induced on purpose.  This is why when someone says they may have overwatering problems I ask them to check the color of the roots. They will be brown and easy to tare apart if you have root rot. If the roots are white then you have some other problem going on."

SpaceBuckets,3ch4so,xj98jeep,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:12:43 2015 UTC,Induced on purpose? Why?
SpaceBuckets,3ch4so,SuperAngryGuy,10,Wed Jul 8 00:51:31 2015 UTC,"It's for failure mode and effects analysis or sometimes called Fault tree analysis depending on the system.  I consult so one of the vital things I have to know is why a system might not work (a ""system"" is undefined- it could be a plant, it could be a particular LED, a WA state medical or recreational grow op, etc).  Another axiom- we tend to learn more in our failures than out successes. Using that premises it becomes logical to kill plants on purpose so that one can observe what is happening before, during and after a certain failure mode test is conducted. I'm not saying that people here should start their killing plants, I'm saying that if one wants to pass themselves off as an expert then you need to understand the particular system inside and out particularly how the system fails.  I used to do a lot of work with robotics. I would buy most every popular servo on the market and write programs to try to kill the servos under load on top of using the servo out of specs before I could recommend one.  This would take weeks.  It's the same with LEDs. I have to spend weeks overdriving and generally trying to kill a particular LED before I can make a recommendation to buy one. This is why I tell people to run these cheap 100 watt LEDs at half power.  In a nutshell, it's about educating myself with hands on, real life examples so I can pass this information on."

As long as it has good dark holes so it doesent just stay in the soil and rot your roots it's good. But a little sprite every few days is not neerly enough. Water every 3-4 days untill it drains.)Nd under watering Rnt much of a problem when u get used to it. I water my girl every 3 days. Feed her on every 2nd watering. She's supposed to get fed twice a week so I might cut It back to every two days. I went to my buddy's yesterday to pick up two autoflowers I traded some shatter for because the ones I orderd online didint pop.

The thing is that almost every fan leaf has this problem, should I trim the dying ones or just leave them to fall off in their own way.

SpaceBuckets,3cgcg1,Bucketlink,3,Wed Jul 8 00:50:48 2015 UTC,"You've done the right thing. Is it possible that you made a mistake on the last feeding and accidentally doubled up on a nutrient? If that's happened then not only will you have burn issues but the pH of that feed would have been far too low.  Do you have a pH meter?  I'd leave the fan leaves for now and see how they go over the next week.  From the looks of all the water that's condensed on the plant overnight you may have too much humidity. A $5 digital hygrometer might be useful. You need to be careful with this kind of thing in a bucket. If that condensation forms in the wrong spot you could have an electrical issue.  This looks particularly nasty. If you don't have a reasonable digital pH meter, and can afford one, you should probably get it."

Other than that I didn't feed or water.   Defoliated a whole bunch last night. Not sure if I went overboard but there were a bunch of bud sites buried in the leaves I wanted to get some light to. Did some LST while I was at it as well. Gave her a water/weak nutes/little cal+mag PH'd to around 7 just now.

SpaceBuckets,3cbo0y,JdH-AU,2,Mon Jul 6 23:35:12 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, it may be worth cutting them off so the plant no longer has to feed that leaf if you are early in the veg stage, which may help with recovering yield a tiny bit once the plant recovers. However just like animals plants can only handle so much stress and the amount of recovery from the amputations may make your yield suffer if you are in the flowering stage. From what I see you are already in the flowering stage so I would just chalk it up and push through. Flush the plant for a few days and hope for the best."

Not sure how reflective chrome paint actually is /u/SuperAngryGuy may be able to give some insight in this one.  I personally think having the exhaust at the top is great as that's where the heat is going to end up anyway, mine is located on the side but near the top.  Not sure about having the intake right next to it though, i have mine placed on the side of my bucket and a few more on spacers if i need them.   Even two exhausts at the top and just using some passive intakes (a few holes on the side) would probably be more efficient for cooling and airflow i think.  Whats the Wattage on those bulbs? You want about 100w in your lighttop or there abouts, i use a 90w ufo led and 5m 5050 led side lighting strip on a removable spacer currently and that's been great with no issues with growth. I would try and put the sidelighting on a removable spacer or strip of plastic and attach it with cable ties, the stock adhesive SUCKS and WILL come off after awhile.  Just make sure you can easily remove your plants pot, i wouldn't recommend putting soil or another medium directly into the bucket as being able to get a good look at it and remove it for watering is pretty handy in my experience.  Lots and lots of holes in the bottom for drainage and a drainage pan or sorts is a good idea.

This will get you to 97-98% reflective however I'm not a huge fan of diffused reflective surfaces. (reflectivity and reflectance is slightly different)  I wouldn't do lines of barium sulfate like doing lines of meth off a dead hooker's forehead but it does have a NFPA 704 rating of 0,0,0 while being a very safe chemical to work with and easy to buy.  http://www.triticeaecap.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Barium_Sulfate.pdf"

SpaceBuckets,3cdidj,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:11:25 2015 UTC,I just got back from my beer run and bought some of this. Silver metallic paint has flaked aluminum in it so it may work better than people think. I have to run various tests on it.
SpaceBuckets,3cdidj,JdH-AU,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:54:38 2015 UTC,From my experience so far I would say get a tote. I'm growing in a 20L pail but am struggling with horizontal space.
SpaceBuckets,3cdidj,Hyroero,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:20:07 2015 UTC,Never had an issue with 20L and horizontal space. Maybe you have a crazy strain or something.  http://imgur.com/a/HnvkW That's my last harvest for reference. Its perfectly fine for the plant to fill out the bucket completely and look a bit squashed.   If you wanted to go bigger then i'd go a brute or bin over a tote personally. But whatever works my man!
SpaceBuckets,3cdidj,JdH-AU,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:32:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm maybe it's just me, but I don't believe that squashing leaves against the side can be a good thing. You're right in that I have a huge plant, but that's mainly because it's a sativa dominant."
SpaceBuckets,3cdidj,Hyroero,2,Tue Jul 7 04:44:01 2015 UTC,"Sure but its not really a negative either, the plant will adapt to its environment just fine.  If you LST and train it also doesn't ever become an issue, obviously you can't really do that much with an auto but they grow so small most of the time it also isn't an issue.  http://imgur.com/a/c3GY2 Check out our Mod's grow currently, its pretty packed to the edges but the only real negative is that its potential growth in that direction is limited i guess but even if you look at most peoples tent grows the plant isn't particularly wide unless its been trained to be wide.  A tote will give you a little more room horizontally i guess depending on the size of it but you loose the neatness and stackability of the bucket spacers? Every tote grow ive seen has been one tote upsidedown on another. I've seen some plants triple or more in flower so prioritize potential vertical space more.  Vertical growth is much more of a problem so i like to be able to just stack spacers as i need them with my light top being just that a lid with the lights in. Not hating on totes though, maybe i should make one for fun and do a comparison."
SpaceBuckets,3cdidj,Hyroero,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:54:01 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the response. My theory was that the reflective paint would work well for an apple tree. If it did well, I would be in good shape to try something more..well, yeah...  My thoughts on the top intake/exhaust were purely for airflow. I wanted something blowing consistently on the entire plant. With strong enough fans, I thought it would be enough air flow to hit the bottom before being sucked out he the exhaust fan  The bulbs are 60W Equivalent Daylight (5000K). The strip lighting was a gift several months ago, so I have no idea what it actually is.  I got a smart pot to fit perfectly in the bottom bucket."
SpaceBuckets,3cdidj,Hyroero,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:52:59 2015 UTC,"Those bulbs are actually 14 true watts and 800 lumens which is quite low per bulb. I used these in my CFL bucket http://www.bunnings.com.au/philips-24w-cool-day-edison-screw-cfl-t2-spiral-tornado-globe_p4320504  Before i scraped the cfl light top and just went with a LED UFO instead.  With the fans i just feel like the CFL's are your main source of heat and pushing the heat down onto the plant just doesn't seem like the most efficient way to go about it. Not a master of airflow by any means so i could be 100% wrong though.  Smart pots are great, make sure you pop some handles on it, i use cable ties again for that but some rope or whatever works too. Makes pulling that sucker out so much easier. Unless it already has them in which case disregard what i said haha.  For reflective material you grab Mylar off the internet or even get emergency blankets for super cheap and strip the Mylar from it. I use white buckets which is enough reflection for me so i don't bother with anything else, just lots of duct tape around the outside to stop light leaks."

SpaceBuckets,3ccdi2,MittenKnitten,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:10:41 2015 UTC,Is that a 20 gal bin? Gives me a idea what I'll have. Just a weed bit more as it's still in veg and half the plant has allready gotten past the 20 gal bin I have it set in and onto the 20 gal I have stacked ontop of it. I actually just rose my light to the top lastnight and put in the remaining tedious reflector tape
SpaceBuckets,3cctz6,samoscratch,9,Mon Jul 6 22:31:25 2015 UTC,"They all equally suck (but better than CFL!) and you should not get hung up on the label. I have a few for comparative testing.  They are kicked out by a few companies in China using very low end, generic LEDs and then different entities slap their own label on them.  These lights are fine for SpaceBuckets where the goal is yield per volume rather than yield per watt but not much else. You can also mount them outside the bucket so thermal management inside the bucket is significantly easier.   And ignore the ""180 watts"" or what ever. It is a deceptive business practice and the true wattage will be lower.  Mars Hydro has done a good job marketing but every light they have are bottom end junk relative to commercial LED grow lights. This is very important to know when return on investment is considered with cannabis in a larger grow op. You get what you pay for."
SpaceBuckets,3cctz6,SuperAngryGuy,3,Tue Jul 7 00:18:32 2015 UTC,"I have a 180w Mars hydro I got off eBay for $69. I'm using it on my first grow and so far no complaints. I've read that most cheap ufos are the same, just rebranded with a different name so brand isn't too important."

SpaceBuckets,3cahuu,Entreps,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:13:13 2015 UTC,I used 5630 LED strips. I believe OP is using 7020 on his which should be better than 5630.
SpaceBuckets,3cahuu,chillymoose,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:17:55 2015 UTC,Yes they are 7020 LED strips. The cheapest I could find. For $13 I'm happy with them but will replace them with reputable 5630 strips at some point.  Do you know how much power you were putting through your strips when you wired them as you did?
SpaceBuckets,3cahuu,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:27:38 2015 UTC,"My entire set up runs on 140W. 46W for side lighting and 86W for the custom UFO (50 3W LED's) The remainder usage is for the carbon filter in-line fan, intakes an UFO fan."
SpaceBuckets,3cahuu,Since_been,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:38:22 2015 UTC,Using peltier cooling was a great idea though. Very inspiring.  I have been watching your progress on that custom LED. Can't wait to see it in action.
SpaceBuckets,3cahuu,Since_been,2,Tue Jul 7 08:33:00 2015 UTC,"That was a lot of work. Instead of a 10 minute job to install, these side lights took an entire day.  And at the end of it I was disappointed with a draw of only 40W. I had thought 20 strips of 7020 in parallel would draw a lot more. I guess they're just junk strips.  I suppose one day when I start refurbishing the original bins I'll need to spring for something better."
SpaceBuckets,3cahuu,Since_been,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:27:43 2015 UTC,I hadn't paid much attention to these strips but the low current draw has gained it.

SpaceBuckets,3cb7fo,Skylarace,3,Mon Jul 6 15:31:04 2015 UTC,Don't grow two plants in the same pot. Your plants are going to compete to feed and the roots will get ties together. Either both plants will die in time or both will produce very low yields

SpaceBuckets,3c9oxd,DjangoTWOchained,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:49:55 2015 UTC,Do you have a light above the plant?
SpaceBuckets,3c9oxd,Hyroero,2,Mon Jul 6 06:54:41 2015 UTC,Not op but yes he would have lights in the light top or lid.  If he didnt that plant wouldn't have grown much at all and especially not straight up like that. Side lighting is to give a little boost to the areas under the canopy that are being blocked by foliage above and don't get much light. Results in slightly fatter buds in the end and the little pop corn buds will end up a bit bigger and actually useful at harvest time.

SpaceBuckets,3c7umy,JdH-AU,6,Sun Jul 5 22:27:11 2015 UTC,"Barney's Farm Critical Kush feminized in 2:1 happy frog and perlite amended with roughly 6 tablespoons of dolomitic lime. I feed her whenever she's dry enough for the smart pot to feel light. Every few feedings she just gets regular tap with calmag and a half teaspoon of dolomitic lime ph'd to 6.6-6.8.    When she gets a full feeding I use calmag and fox farms trio (grow big and big bloom during veg, tiger bloom and big bloom during flower) at the recommended dosage on the bottle. I use a half gallon milk jug to feed so I just cut the dosages on the bottles accordingly.    She's in a 3gal smart pot with handles and I use 5M of 5050smd in warm white as well as 4 cfl bulbs in a 4 way studio lamp with a fuse which you can see in my profile on the spacebuckets website. During veg I will use 3 veg and 1 flower spectrum cfl, and then 3 flower and 1 veg bulb during flower to keep things mixed up.    I use a combination of topping and hardcore lst to shape the plant and then very specific defoliation to develop my canopy as I go. Basically anything below the side lighting spacer is removed as well as anything blocking light to budsites. When she reaches roughly 40% of my planned height after all of that, she gets flipped to flower."

SpaceBuckets,3c7k9o,samoscratch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:20:38 2015 UTC,Will you put soil directly into the bucket or in a pot? Your fan is positioned very low.
SpaceBuckets,3c7k9o,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:26:05 2015 UTC,"In a pot, the center of the fan is about the height of the pot, so it's not completely blocked, and it's mainly for airflow, just getting a current from bottom to top(where the out take fan is) was the goal. Would a more in line placement be better?"
SpaceBuckets,3c7k9o,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:59:45 2015 UTC,"Well it might work for you, when I built mine I realized too late that my fan was too low.  I only had one at the bottom and one on the lid.  So I was forced to put soil directly into the bucket since the fan would just be blowing against the pot otherwise.  I'm in the middle of revamping my bucket right now."
SpaceBuckets,3c7k9o,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:36:14 2015 UTC,Use bigger CFLs if you can. Those look like 14 watts where you really want to use 23-26 watts bulbs. You can get mini twist bulbs that are 23-26 watts.  Happy bonus points for the wire nuts and taping them.
SpaceBuckets,3c7khg,jbisonx,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:09:25 2015 UTC,"The rule of thumb for airflow I've observed seems to be 2:1 in:out. So, if your intakes have twice the area of your exhaust, you shouldn't need an intake fan."
SpaceBuckets,3c7zmg,punkrocker0621,5,Sun Jul 5 19:24:33 2015 UTC,"Well I'll give an opinion relevant to spacebuckets.  Autos are undesirable because topping and training the plant aggressively is vital to getting a solid yield from a bucket.  For many people a spacebucket grow will be their first grow and they'll tend to run into more problems, which with an auto will mean a compromised yield, sometimes severely. A photoperiod can be vegged for longer and recover before you choose to flower it.  So being able to choose when the plant flowers is more important for bucket growers than it is when growing by other methods. Sorry I've not got a specific opinion on the strains you've chosen but I thought this was a good opportunity to express my views on autos in buckets. I've never understood the popular opinion that autos are the best choice for beginner growers."
SpaceBuckets,3c7zmg,Bucketlink,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:06:44 2015 UTC,I said I wasn't growing in a bucket in the comments. I have a closet setup.

Best growing autoflowers I've ever come into contact with. There easy to grow to. No training and I'll still have a nice plant of some of the dankest auto around
SpaceBuckets,3c772e,Bucket-head,3,Sun Jul 5 14:53:48 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're just getting a lot of water evaporation off the soil from all the airflow. 80-82F is right on the money of where you want ambient air temperatures for cannabis.

SpaceBuckets,3c772e,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:52:06 2015 UTC,Yea I think you're right because I'm moving a lot of air and the top soil looks dried out.   I'm not sure of the soil temperature itself because I only have a wireless temp monitor in there and it's a block that just sits on the soil.

Then you need a growing medium like soil or coco coir, seeds which you can buy online or get out of a seedy deal, nutrients which vary in price unless your making an organic soil mix in which case you need to buy the ingredients for that (unless you have some from your own garden or whatever) Ph meter costs around $50 for a good one but some people get by with just using Ph strips which are super cheap.  My Bucket and all my nutes and other equipment probably set me back $200 AUD but yeah the price really varies depending how much stuff you can find for free or how good a quality components you want or if you can wait from cheap stuff from china on ebay.  $150 American seems to be what people plan for but some of the more crazy buckets can cost a bit more, especially if you need a carbon filter and such for stealth."

I don't see a plug in the picture so I assume it needs a ~23w power supply? Would this fan be appropriate? Overkill?  Is pellet or non-pellet activated carbon preferred? Do both work well?
SpaceBuckets,3c2qek,caslty,2,Sat Jul 4 08:09:54 2015 UTC,You probably need an AC fan power cord.

SpaceBuckets,3c2qek,JdH-AU,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:16:33 2015 UTC,"A 120mm PC fan can push air through a filter. It just has to be a high static pressure fan. I have a 120mm Corsair SP120L (this one, it's a 12V water cooler stock fan rated at up to 7mm/H2O) driving a 4"" carbon filter. It gets a bit noisier, but I surely do feel warm air coming out of the filter.  Many people make the mistake that you need higher CFM to drive a filter, whereas filters are usually rated at their MAXIMUM CFM; anything more and you'll be pushing air through so fast that the carbon can't filter it and things get smelly."

SpaceBuckets,3bz5nh,Hyroero,2,Fri Jul 3 09:44:32 2015 UTC,I'd like to know in how tight vertical space it's manageable to grow a healthy plant. I'm about to build my first setup and for now have decided to go for a single bigger bin. I've done some math and came into conclusion that my vertical growing space is around 50 cm from soil to the lid. I'm wondering if that's enough or would I need spacers.  I know there is differences between strains. For starters I'd go with autos because I believe they are the easiest to grow. I know that training is important part in keeping the plant under control but I also know that it cannot do miracles.  I do have a little more horizontal space so maybe with proper training it's manageable to keep most of the strains under control and try to make them grow wide.  Thoughts? Should I invest into another bin and make a spacer or am I good with proper training?
SpaceBuckets,3bz5nh,The_Troll_Gull,3,Fri Jul 3 16:35:31 2015 UTC,"For starters I'd go with autos    Get a photoperiod instead and train it like there's no tomorrow.

First hand experience is the key :)  Autos are awesome plants but they're not neccesarily easier to grow, they're just faster, shorter and less trainable."

SpaceBuckets,3bz5nh,Neceros,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:45:08 2015 UTC,Most people would consider photoperiod plants easier due to control over veg and flower.  For example if you make a mistake with a feeding or some other issue arises you can keep it in veg to recover. Autos are only small because they start flowering so early in my understanding. You can do the same with a Photo by just starting the flowering early on.

If I wanted to go bleeding edge I'm sure I could have found a deal for the newer strips but I felt comfortable with the price and my experience with them so far so for now I went with it.

SpaceBuckets,3byahm,Northpolehustler,3,Fri Jul 3 03:53:27 2015 UTC,"The pH sensor will be tricky. They need constant care to stay accurate. I bought a reasonable digital meter and each time I use it I need to rinse it with distilled water then dip it in buffer solution before putting the cap back on and recalibrate about once a week.  See: http://hannainst.com/usa/whitepaper/CareandstorageofpHelectroderev4.pdf  They can't remain submerged in the sample solution which is a big problem for you.  I've got parts on the way to build an arduino controlled drip watering system. Have a look at peristaltic pumps, they offer some unique advantages for these kinds of systems.   I also started graphing a couple of my plants when they ran into some trouble.

SpaceBuckets,3byahm,Bucketlink,2,Fri Jul 3 06:37:33 2015 UTC,"Instead of searching for a pH sensor that can be submersed for extended periods of time, why not develop a living, no-till soil? Full disclosure: I'm completely new to growing, so I cannot personally comment on how easy to maintain or how successful this would be for a bucket, but it seems to be a more independent way of growing. The initial set up would be much more involved, however.  I would check to see if the EPA lists their pH equipment that they use to test water as it drains into water supplies. I know they use ""long-term"" ion selective electrodes in order to monitor certain ion levels continuously. I am not sure if they do the same with pH.   Lastly, if you were to go the completely automated route, I would look into using hydroponics (such as a deep water culture system) as measuring soil pH seems to be a guessing game at best. I am assuming continuously monitoring the pH of a reservoir would be much easier than testing soil pH. You could potentially add an electrode that selectively monitors nitrates, phosphorous, and potassium in your reservoir. This would get expensive quick, but would be interesting to see. Developing a method to selectively adjust the NPK ratio would also be costly.  Again, I am a novice grower. Take everything I am saying with a huge grain of salt. I am however a chemist and have experience working with pH probes as well as ion selective electrodes."

SpaceBuckets,3bveu4,Toffeemanstan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:58:56 2015 UTC,"When the plant grows too big for the pot, the roots have nowhere to grow into. Yellowing of the lower leaves is one of the first signs (although other problems can have similar symptoms ). Only way to cure it is to repot into a larger container.  Not sure if this is what's wrong as it also looks under/overwatered. The soil shouldn't be allowed to dry out, should be kept moist but not soaked."

The weight of the bucket should tell you.  If that is not the problem, try increasing exhaust at night as leaves ""ripening"" and falling off at an excessive rate can also be a symptom of too much ethylene build up in grow room. More exhaust at night hours will halp if that is the prob rather than over/under watering."

SpaceBuckets,3bvami,Bucketlink,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:51:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, indeed! I decided to stop mucking around and go with the 75L Willow. It was only $25 at Bunnings and fits perfectly underneath my desk in my bedroom. Doesn't look like a glowing spaceship at night either. (Actually it barely lets any light out which is ideal.) Stealthier than the bucket option IMO. I feel like the height might be a bit restrictive. Just gotta be careful about 'dat stretch' plenty of lateral grow space though.

SpaceBuckets,3bvq4s,CivDis,4,Thu Jul 2 19:04:48 2015 UTC,Definitely. Both options work but a separate pot makes much more sense.
SpaceBuckets,3bvq4s,Ekrof,3,Thu Jul 2 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"Pot!   Here's what you do- grow the plant out a little if even in a plastic keg cup with holes pinched in the bottom, replant in a container that will fit in your bucket but here's the kicker; when you transplant fill the container 3/4s the way with soil, spread the roots of your little plant on top of the soil as you do the transplant, cover those roots with soil the rest of the way (so they are not drying out) and you will have a significantly more efficient root system in a smaller container.   Even in root bound conditions, the middle of the container will often not actually have roots because cannabis roots in a soil container tend to grow to the side and then down. We can get around this and boost our yields.  Here's examples:  http://i.imgur.com/bXsCbWb.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/AwgGzGO.jpg (technique with the plant pulled out of container with 3 inches of soil)  http://i.imgur.com/RdKIFJC.jpg (pole beans!)  http://i.imgur.com/LoD7jDv.jpg (an ideal LST)  None of the above had to use bucket spacers."

The idea is to have each cola have the same distance to the roots and therefore optimize the delivery of water and food equally to all the buds.  You seem to have 8 individual branches all connected directly to the main stem. Obviously, it's not harming your plant, it's just not a true mainline, more like an aggressive topping and LST.

SpaceBuckets,3bsusf,Bucketlink,2,Fri Jul 10 00:22:11 2015 UTC,"Noob question. Can someone explain the whole gender thing to me? Won't male flowers grow buds? How long before you can tell if it's female or male? Is there no way of knowing if the seed your planting is male or female? Are auto flowers not pre gender determined? If my plant is male, do I just throw it away and plant a new and hope it's female this time? If I change my male flower to female, may I call it Caitlyn?"
SpaceBuckets,3bsusf,Riker_is_number_1,2,Sat Jul 11 19:00:29 2015 UTC,Sure.  Males grow pollen sacks and not flowers (buds).  Females grow flowers which can be pollinated by a male plant. If that happens the female will grow seeds amongst its flowers. This is a bad thing for your grow.  The only way to know what gender the plant's going to be before you plant it is to buy a feminised seed. You will be able to tell its gender within two weeks of changing the lighting schedule.  Feminised seeds come in both autoflower and photoperiod varieties.   For your purposes it would be best to throw away any male plants you grow.  You can call your plant whatever you like.

SpaceBuckets,3bsusf,Riker_is_number_1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:39:05 2015 UTC,"Because autos go into flower on their own schedule.  With a photoperiod, you can stretch out the vegetative phase and create more bud sites to maximize your yield.  I'm sure there's a point of diminishing return based on the expense of keeping a plant in veg, but I'm also sure it's not hard to outdo an auto with just a little extra veg time."

Watch Temps and have a fan blowing across to strengthen the stalk. Always read and try to learn more and look at people's mistakes. Become familiar with nutrient deficiencies or salt lockup and common bug issues. Use plenty of lighting, usually around 100w per plant and the more the better but watch ambient heat levels and humidity which are directly affected by this. Do all this and most importantly be patient and listen to your plant and you can't go wrong. Buckets yield usually around 20-90 grams depending on how good of a cultivator you are. Read read read!"
SpaceBuckets,3bsusf,Bucketlink,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:18:47 2015 UTC,"Everyone has an opinion on nutes and you will find that they are all about the same. I went with the Fox farm trio for under 50$ and you can count on them to make a good blend of nutes. This will be the one most recommended but of course it depends on budget. If it's your first time I'd do that and some Calmag. Its easy and proven. That will get you to harvest and make a huge difference in the right conditions. You can definitely top multiple times and it will help, mainlining is practically the same thing but you do a lot of defoliation and lollipopping which forces the main colas to produce the biggest baddest buds. I'm still torn on what I will incorporate but for sure will start by topping once and seeing how the plant responds. Growweedeasy.com is a good reference for all these terms and more. Have fun with it and note mistakes and the next time will only get better! Also don't short yourself on seed genetics. Look for a well known seed bank and spend the extra on a good strain and it will make a huge difference.   Edit: as far as topping a few times early on; it just depends how the plant responds. If it stunts growth the first time for a good week I would be careful of doing it back to back. You don't want to top too early because you are taking fan leaves off which are the growth engines and if you take too many off you will inhibit growth and it will take forever to rebound. Get a good 5 nodes(two opposite sets of leaves coming from main cola) before first top and then go from there."
SpaceBuckets,3bsusf,SMU_PDX,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"Flushing essentially purges your soil. You can do small flushes or big ones. Usually you would use a volume of water three times that of your soil. So my 3 gal pots would use around 9 gals of RO water and this would flush any salts/nutes and neutralizes pH, and even cools your pots soil which makes them happy too. After doing this you shouldn't water for a good week unless you're in flower and it's sucking it down quick. Some will just flush until a good amount starts to seep from the bottom, alternating this method with a nute mix every other day or something similar to prevent salt buildup and nute burn. A good Flushing is a way to prevent headaches later or simply to get you back to a baseline if you are unsure of something going on in your grow."

What you're looking for though, is a fan with high static pressure versus high air flow. I'm currently successfully driving a 4"" carbon filter with a Corsair SP120L (stock fan of the h100i water cooler). It's the highest static pressure PC fan I've been able to find (some sources quote up to 7.7mm/H2O). Bucket temps go up by about one or two degrees when I plug in the filter.  Don't get confused by the CFM rating of the filter: this is a MAXIMUM and not a minimum. I think many people are actually running with an oversized fan because they think they need more CFM versus static pressure. This can make things pretty noisy.

SpaceBuckets,3bow9m,G_DuBs,3,Tue Jun 30 23:17:21 2015 UTC,Yes. You may want to boost your lighting levels. See how all the new growth is lighter green than the fan leaves? This is often a sign than you can pump up the volume in terms of lighting levels (it's also what an early sulfur deficiency might look like but don't believe that's the case here because you have a very nice looking plant).  Cannabis will typically get 2-3 times bigger after you do the 12-12 flip.

It has pre flowers so it's getting to an important time so I'm really weary"
SpaceBuckets,3blyji,I_am_jacks_reddit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:07:25 2015 UTC,Just so I don't make the same mistake what soil did you use?
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,JdH-AU,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:53:13 2015 UTC,The 5630 strips I have draw 1.9A over 5m.  That's tested inline with a multimeter and less than half what the manufacturer claims.
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,Bucketlink,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:57:13 2015 UTC,Really? I thought you'd need at least 5A? Interesting.
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,Bucketlink,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:17:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess the manufacturers just give the total draw of all the LEDs without accounting for the drop in voltage over such a long run.  That's my amateur guess.  A 5A PSU will be fine.
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,caretak3r,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:36:51 2015 UTC,"you can run the smd strips harder if you WANT to - they produce more light, but more heat also.  I've run 5630s up to 4A or so.  In order to do so, you have to power them in shorter lengths (1M or less), or, you can apply power to the strip in multiple places (like both ends, or two points in the middle, etc)."
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,somnific,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:08:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i just noticed that.  My 5M 5630 strip draws about 35-40W, but if i connect both ends it jumps to about 50W."
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,caretak3r,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:19:44 2015 UTC,4A for how much length?
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,caretak3r,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:46:28 2015 UTC,I've actually run 5m @ over 6A.  I don't recommend it because it puts off a ton of heat.
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,caretak3r,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"20m of strips in that bucket, 303W at the wall, but the power supply was probably only running 85% efficient at best, so that would be more like 5.4A actual.  http://postimg.org/image/an6nqdman/  http://postimg.org/image/4arigjj8f/"

SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,Bucketlink,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:20:55 2015 UTC,"I got the same ones without a dimmer. Waiting for them to arrive in the mail now. On that eBay page the seller says you need 12V 8A power supply. I ended up getting that one, it was fairly pricey ($43AUD) so hopefully not overkill.   Anyone think i will have a problem using 8Amps?"
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:49:07 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine. Correct me if I'm wrong (sanity check /u/superangryguy), but in the end it's the wattage that counts. If you try to draw more current than your power supply is rated for, the voltage will drop and the lights will dim as a result.  In your case it should be smooth sailing since your device draws less power than your supply can deliver, though you may want a dimmer since your lights will be blazing full power."
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:25:36 2015 UTC,"Most power supplies will either start strobing or shut down in an over current situation.  It's the wattage, quality of the LEDs (high end 5630s will give off about twice the light than these generic 5630s) and the spectrum of the LEDs that matters.  It's never a bad idea to over size a power supply."
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,Bucketlink,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:53:59 2015 UTC,When it comes to high end 5630 strips I've found Samsung chips being used but at $50 - $60 / 5m.  Are there better deals to be had or is this the true state of play?
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,Bucketlink,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:06:12 2015 UTC,"Oh no, you get what you pay for!"
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,Bucketlink,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:28:19 2015 UTC,I got warm white LEDs so spectrum should be good. So if you oversize a powersupply you won't really burn the lights unless you up the voltage am I right?
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,Bucketlink,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:29:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is basically correct."
SpaceBuckets,3blt6t,Entreps,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:55:09 2015 UTC,I ended up getting this 12V5A power supply. Paid a bit extra to get a certification tick. Don't want to start a fire and such.

SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,Bonabud,5,Tue Jun 30 00:03:52 2015 UTC,I've thought about this too but you'll need no less than 15m of high power strips and power supply to suit. LED strips are so inefficient to run in comparison to the alternatives it's just not worth it.
SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,Bucketlink,2,Tue Jun 30 01:38:04 2015 UTC,"It's possible. I've done it before. With just one strip of warm white and tin foil on the sides. Didn't produce much but it did work. This is how I have constructed my current bucket. Expect to spend ~$80 bucks on electronics. I have a base bucket with drainage holes, foil tape on the sides, with soil inside, and an exhaust fan. I also have 2 buckets with the bottoms cut off. 1 bucket contains a warm led strip and 1 contains a cool led strip. I can slide them out for when I switch from veg to flower. For the top I have 2 lids with the same idea as the side lighting but using a heat sink w/ fan and 100w cool/warm led chips. The heatsink fans double as the intake. This works well, cheap, and fun to piece together. Powering it all is important. Make sure everything supplies the right amount of voltage and amperage."
SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,Molinkintov,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer! Good to hear that its possible. I'm going to try your way. One last thing, what do you use as power supply?"
SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,Molinkintov,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:27:58 2015 UTC,"several power supplies. 1 for the LED strip (came with), 1 for the LED chip (step up converter and a >100w laptop power supply), one for the fans. You want the output of the step up converter to be around 27-30V. The chips can go higher but this is already pretty fucking bright at this voltage and under powering them will extend their life too."
SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,Molinkintov,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:38:36 2015 UTC,Wow that was fast ! Thank you for the info!
SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,Hyroero,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:44:55 2015 UTC,No problem. Make sure you plug this into a quality surge protector that is grounded.
SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,Hyroero,2,Tue Jun 30 07:08:49 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't. It would be cheaper and easier just to go with cfl bulbs if a ufo led from ebay is too much.  Really ends up being pretty close though, you can get a ufo from China for 60bucks easy and then all you need to do is attach it to a lid or sit it on top."
SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,Undercover_Dinosaur,3,Tue Jun 30 03:28:37 2015 UTC,I dont have a problem with spending 60 bucks for a UFO. The thing is if customs open the package ...I'm from a Europe country and I'm worried about beeing busted. They are very strict here. I know its stupid but with buying specific growing gear you can catch the police' attention.
SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,Undercover_Dinosaur,2,Tue Jun 30 06:36:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry dude. It's all legal and used for lots of general growing not specifically marijuana.  It's very strict where I live too and I've never had an issue, even buying seeds to my door haha.  It's your call in the end though so don't feel pressured into doing something you don't want to do but yeah I'd be extremely doubtful they would follow up a completely legal purchase"
SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,Undercover_Dinosaur,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:41:20 2015 UTC,"I dont feel any pressure at all ;) I want to do this just for me and because of the fun building something working and useful. But your both right, those UFOs are legal devices, so I will stick to this plan."

SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,Undercover_Dinosaur,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:47:36 2015 UTC,"No we're not, at least no cannabis ;) I know a few people who may have seeds, so for now the light remains the bigger obstacle"

SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,savonlechat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:16:18 2015 UTC,I'd like a link to these bulbs you speak of.
SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,beezwax1,2,Tue Jun 30 06:46:15 2015 UTC,Cfl bulbs? They are just normal light bulbs you use in your home.  You can get them from the super market or hardware store. You want 24w or higher per bulb if possible.  5000k to 6000k color spectrum bulbs are the best for veg and 2500k to 3500k or so is better for flowering plants.  I used a mix of both personally with no issues.
SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,caretak3r,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:43:59 2015 UTC,I meant the ufo bulbs.
SpaceBuckets,3bklkf,caretak3r,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:01:00 2015 UTC,Ah an led ufo. No bulbs but rather a circular array of led lights.  Just pop in led ufo on eBay or Amazon and go nuts. I use a 90w one for my 20L bucket but others have used more powerful ones.  The higher the watts the more light and heat it's going to generate.

SpaceBuckets,3bi0v0,JdH-AU,5,Mon Jun 29 11:40:08 2015 UTC,"The only way I've got a strip to overheat was to literally wrap it in a towel as a ""smoke test"". Here is the result.

SpaceBuckets,3bi0v0,SuperAngryGuy,4,Mon Jun 29 14:05:07 2015 UTC,"No, you won't start a fire. Direct contact with the LEDs can cause small heat burns on the leaf, but it will never get hot enough to ignite"

SpaceBuckets,3bej0r,dr-pott,4,Sun Jun 28 14:15:51 2015 UTC,Tape for sure. But since it's already built that makes it tricky.
SpaceBuckets,3bej0r,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:13:54 2015 UTC,"It all comes apart fairly easily and there isn't any plants in it yet. So it shouldn't be too bad. This was more of a test fit, to make sure everything worked. Would electrical tape be sufficient? I have an abundance of that."

SpaceBuckets,3bej0r,JdH-AU,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:35:04 2015 UTC,I would spend the cash on a good roll of foil tape and line the inside of the bucket with it. It worked out great for me before I moved to a closet setup. What kind of lights are you using?
SpaceBuckets,3bej0r,omni04,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:28:17 2015 UTC,The inside is lined with a combination of silver mylar and foil tape around the edges. I've got 4 23w 6400k cfl in the top. I did want a fifth in the middle but the inline fan takes up to much room. I might modify it yet though.
SpaceBuckets,3bf7u3,Augerman,4,Sun Jun 28 18:09:53 2015 UTC,"The problem is that these strips run at 12 volts and they have 3 LEDs in series with a resistor and then a bunch of these in parallel to make a strip (everything is ran constant voltage and not constant current which you would never want to do in this case).  The voltage drop across a red LED will be 2.1-2.2 volts or so leaving around 6.5 volts for the three red LEDs and 5.5 volts to heat up the resistor (just wasted energy).   Blue/white LEDs (a white is a blue with a phosphor) will have a voltage drop of just over 3 volts or so for about 10 volts across the 3 LEDs and perhaps 2 volts across the resistor.  Blue LEDs are often, but not always, more electrically efficient than red LEDs but blue was a lower RQE (relative quantum efficiency which is based on the McCree curve which tells us how much light being absorbed is really being used for photosynthesis) and blue light can have powerful affects on a plant both desirable and undesirable which can depend on the phase of the life cycle of a plant (seedling/veg/flowering).  White already has blue light in it along with green and red.  You're having troubles finding information on the strips because they're using low end generic LEDs. The numbers are the LED package size but says nothing about the quality of the LEDs- you can get a top bin name brand 5630 that may put out perhaps twice the light as a generic 5630."
SpaceBuckets,3bf7u3,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:38:20 2015 UTC,If it's marked as a red LED strip then it's just red LEDs on it instead of white. I've never seen LED strips with a coloured cover.
SpaceBuckets,3be5lj,demonyc666,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:07:36 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your build! Air exchange is important, especially in an enclosed space like a bucket, so I would leave the fans on, and this will solve your smell problem too. I'm interested to see what others say about this. Edit: after re-reading your question, I'm a little unclear what you mean by the exhaust only being able to cool the lights, can you sketch it out?  The discoloration could be from being buried alive at birth (it sounds stressful just saying it), but it sounds healthy enough and will likely improve over the next few days.  Unfortunately I think there are too many variables to stick to a milestone guide like that, other than in the most general senses. I would look at some of the grow journals over on the sidebar in /r/trees, they have some that have pics every few days just about, but remember that every setup has a ton of variables.

Which is good for me but I don't want to stunt my growth either.  I have my cfls only a couple inches away and you can look at my history to see my growth which is minimal for over 2 weeks.  very healthy looking plants though and I just started introducing some heavy watt 2700k cfls for extra light.

SpaceBuckets,3bd425,youngandstupiddumb,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:50:26 2015 UTC,"Blue light sources suppress auxin (growth hormones) production, which will limit how stretchy the plant gets.

Keep in mind that cannabis will flower out under full moon lighting levels and at that level you can easily see your hand in front of your face once your eyes are adapted if not before (about 0.1-0.25 lux depending on specific conditions). It can be wavelength specific (you can use a green safe light at lower levels for short periods without disrupting your photoperiod, for example).  You should be fine and I've grown cannabis in a SpaceBucket with light leaks also in a closet."

SpaceBuckets,3bcfjr,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"Also remember that Autoflowers don't care about light leaks.  In the old days they were pretty limited but now days, especially in a space bucket environment, I don't think they really limit you too much at all."
SpaceBuckets,3bc8yk,beezwax1,3,Sat Jun 27 21:08:12 2015 UTC,I think it depends on how close to the sides of the tent/bucket the plant grows. Maybe hold off unless you see areas that don't get any light.
SpaceBuckets,3bc8yk,Green4Jesus20,2,Sat Jun 27 22:36:50 2015 UTC,"Just a lurker here, but even then I would suggest using a CFL if there is space. Those small LEDs don't have great PAR or efficiency for those matter.   Edit: or better yet, fluorescent tubes on the side since there's space for them."
SpaceBuckets,3bc8yk,sethamphetamine,3,Sat Jun 27 23:58:10 2015 UTC,You'd really want to use high power LEDs for anything bigger than a bucket. Here's an example of intracanopy/side lighting that greatly boosted my yields (I was testing older 40% efficient blue LEDs in the pic).  http://i.imgur.com/EFLRZCb.jpg
SpaceBuckets,3bc8yk,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:40:28 2015 UTC,"from your experience, what color temperature do you recommend for intracanopy lighting.   do you recommend specific blues or low power white cobs like the vero 10 series?"
SpaceBuckets,3bc8yk,caretak3r,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"Blue was just a test to see if there was any cascade protein affects that would do anything to the upper buds beyond making them more dense/increase mass.  I would recommend 3 watt red LEDs since the LEDs will be up close and you don't want any ""hot spots"". Osram has red LEDs that are about 50% efficient. Generic eBay cheap red LEDs are going to be around 20-25% efficient.  If I went COB then I'd go with the latest version of the Vero 10."
SpaceBuckets,3bc8yk,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:44:49 2015 UTC,Those look cool. What would be the best way to light them?

SpaceBuckets,3bc8yk,Bucketlink,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:30:21 2015 UTC,I wouldn't bother. LED strips seem to only be effective when in very close proximity to the flowers. Anything beyond 5cm and their effectiveness drops off.
SpaceBuckets,3bc8yk,Green4Jesus20,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:31:58 2015 UTC,You have LED strips in your main bucket right? I'm considering adding some but was considering spreading them out more instead of stacked tightly on top of eachother. My thinking was that more vertical area of the plant will get light as opposed to just on the top and bottom. Interested to hear your thoughts.   Diagram of potential LED placement
SpaceBuckets,3bc8yk,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:27:23 2015 UTC,I guess where I place the LED strips is dictated by the reach of the overhead lights. So I try and focus their intensity as much as possible into the shaded low growth that was established before the plant started to stretch.  The growth that comes about after flipping to 12/12 isn't bushy like the earlier vegetative growth and in my case wouldn't benefit from additional side lighting as the overheads and wall reflection takes care of it.  Because even the most powerful of the cheap LED strips don't generate much light I think packing them into the area they're most needed is the best.  My grow bins have a tapered shape and I think this exacerbates the situation.
SpaceBuckets,3bbh17,Green4Jesus20,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:59:42 2015 UTC,keeping a little extra perlite on top is reflective as shit by the way.
SpaceBuckets,3bbh17,youngandstupiddumb,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:24:36 2015 UTC,Is that the only reason you did this?  Sounds like a good idea but will it do anything else like offset pH levels?  I'm about to transfer and want to do 50/50 perlite/happy frog.  What was your mix like?
SpaceBuckets,3bbh17,youngandstupiddumb,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"added perlite a few days after transplanting to the bucket to make it about a 30% perlite mix, at around 10V. Had 6 seedlings, did 12/12 for a week and picked the girl, then repotted and centered her. Gave the rest of the soil a good mixing since I couldn't before with all the seedlings. Now it's back to veg but I noticed the soil wasn't draining quite as fast so I added as much as I could bringing it closer to 50/50 and mixed it in without disturbing the roots, so that's why there's more on top. But since it's reflective I don't worry about it.   pH of the runoff has been a bit low but I hadn't tested before the perlite so I'm not sure, but the plant seems healthy and I've been feeding with close to neutral pH to correct it.  EDIT: Perlite is supposed to be pH neutral. Mine was miracle grow though, so it had some nutes in it so it may have slightly affected it, but in practice I didn't notice anything."
SpaceBuckets,3bblhe,Green4Jesus20,3,Sat Jun 27 17:39:36 2015 UTC,Put them tight in a spacer for extra comfortableness. I woduldn't put it in the main bucket.
SpaceBuckets,3badhr,ViduTheDon,2,Sat Jun 27 08:25:26 2015 UTC,"Are there no fans fitted yet? Then yeah, fitting them will be a huge improvement.  You should get a cheap digital thermometer and test the temperatures inside."
SpaceBuckets,3badhr,Bucketlink,2,Sat Jun 27 09:04:59 2015 UTC,"The fans are everything when it comes to temps. Put in your fans, you'll be fine. Just remember heat rises so it's best to have at lease one intake fan down in the main bucket, and then have another intake and your exhaust up in the light top. That will keep your temps low and air moving."
SpaceBuckets,3badhr,bacon_flavored,2,Sat Jun 27 14:13:14 2015 UTC,thank you! this is my first reddit post ever so i appreciate the responses. im going to get a 120mm for intake and 2 80mm for exhaust or should i reverse and just put the 1 larger fan as the exhaust and save the smaller ones for intake as you suggest one near the lower half of the main bucket then 1 higher up near the eventual canopy?
SpaceBuckets,3badhr,bacon_flavored,3,Sat Jun 27 16:54:46 2015 UTC,"I think your second option there is the way to go. I'd have one down low just near the top of the main bucket pulling in air, one up top pulling in air near the lights, and one strong exhaust up tip as well pulling the warm air out."

SpaceBuckets,3b679s,Neceros,3,Fri Jun 26 08:18:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't used an auto-wicking system but my first grow is about two weeks away from harvest and the only time the plant was in soil was when it was first given to me. At that stage it was about 9” high and in a non-draining pot with waterlogged soil. I gently extricated it, rinsed away as much of the soil from the roots as I could and then re-potted it in a mesh pot with clay balls as the medium. That pot was then placed into a hole cut in the lid of a 2.5 gallon plastic paint pail with the lip of the mesh pot being slightly larger than the hole. The exterior and lid of the plastic paint pail were painted black and the whole lot was placed at the bottom of a spacebucket lit by 5 14W Philips warm white LED bulbs at the top and a 5 metre strip of 5050 warm white LED’s around the inside of bucket.  For the first 8 weeks of the grow a small aquarium water pump sitting at the bottom of the large bucket pumped the nutrient solution to two small hydroponic drippers placed at the base of the main stalk where it emerged from the clay balls. After 8 weeks however the root system was large enough to reach down into the nutrient solution so I removed the pump and replaced it with a small aquarium air bubbler to keep the solution oxygenated.  When it comes to pH there were a few issues at times with a rising pH during the veg stage but I changed to a different nutrient brand (Flairform Greendream) when I switched to flowering and the pH has been locked on 5.6 ever since. I should probably note that the water I have been using is deionised and filtered drinking water which I buy from my local supermarket and I have never had any problems with algae etc. At the moment the nutrient level is currently dropping by around half a gallon every two days so if you go with the rope wicking idea it will pay to make sure the capillary action process can supply that amount of liquid.  Happy growing !"

SpaceBuckets,3b679s,bacon_flavored,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:55:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry for being AFK.  You should look up DIY sub irrigated planters, because it's basically what the wick does.  The wick is nothing special, just some synthetic rope that draws water from a reservoir. The more rope you have the more moisture is transmitted to your roots. You will have to experiment and see how much you need depending on your container, media, plant size/age/stage etc...  I used smart pots just sitting on top of the rope, but you can put holes in plastic containers and insert rope too.   You can use whatever hydro nutrients you want as long as they don't change pH too fast, or get nasty in your reservoir."

SpaceBuckets,3b4elm,420DeDon420,2,Fri Jun 26 01:08:38 2015 UTC,"Spent about $100-$120. Authentic red LED's are extremely more expensive than any other LED, I'm sure the buds will appreciate it though. ;)"

SpaceBuckets,3b4elm,SuperAngryGuy,3,Sun Jun 28 10:41:45 2015 UTC,So where did you get the round portion that you're soldering the LEDs to? What is it called? LINK!!!
SpaceBuckets,3b4elm,ergeha,3,Fri Jun 26 03:00:18 2015 UTC,Very nice! You can get 50% efficient red and blue LEDs from Osram and Philips (38% white LEDs from Philips) which would give you about twice the light over your LEDs and blow away anything on the commercial and hobby market for future builds.

SpaceBuckets,3b63wl,Shitwinds_Are_Coming,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:28:40 2015 UTC,Use the daylight bulbs until you want to flower then switch.
SpaceBuckets,3b63wl,Bucketlink,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:51:16 2015 UTC,Use a 3:1 ratio of day:soft for veg and a the opposite for flower. Blue spectrum is used to promote the chlorophyle you need in veg and the red spectrum is used to promote the chlorophyle you need im flower. Using soft whites in veg will make your plant stretch too much. And blue in flower will result in less dense budz
SpaceBuckets,3b63wl,Northernlighter,0,Fri Jun 26 13:39:54 2015 UTC,"This answer basically makes no sense. What is the difference between veg ""chlorophyle"" and flowering ""chlorophyle"". And what exactly is chlorophyle?"
SpaceBuckets,3b63wl,SuperAngryGuy,-1,Fri Jun 26 21:25:51 2015 UTC,"This is a verryyyy simplified way of explaning what the 420-460nm (blue) and 630-660nm (red) wavelengths do in the photosynthesis process. There is chlorophyle a and b and some other stuff, which are created by the plant, both are produced at different stages of the plants growth and are promoted using different colors of light.   Basically I dont want to go back to find all the scientific documents to find the exact terminology, so I'm giving a very dumbed down explanation.   All you need to know is more red is needed in flowering and more blue is needed in veg. Yellow and green is not needed as much but has its uses, that is why HPS is so innefficient, but because of the quantity of light it produces it work well enough"

Best quality budz I've seen in my life except for a couple of exceptions, maybe only bought weed 5-6x times in my life that was better than my own, and I am no where near a professionnal grower...

SpaceBuckets,3b63wl,Northernlighter,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:07:07 2015 UTC,"But why did I have so much success using red and blue leds? Beat the crap out of any of my friends hps grown budz   I'd have to know the exact grow conditions like what the true lighting levels at canopy level was, the health of the plants etc. Genetics plays a big role. I've seen beginners knock it out of the ballpark and experienced growers get less than 1/2 pound per 1000W HPS.  Total heat shouldn't be much different than a HPS for the same power input it's just with HPS the heat is concentrated in a small volume (the bulb). LED lights are superior at having the heat removed from the fixture."

She wants to stretch and be a free sativa and I kept manhandling her into a compact design. It's probably related that she threw 5 balls right after I pruned 4 extraneous tops that were shooting out of the main colas during flower along with several light-blocking fans. Now she's settled back down and alas, no more signs of hermie after a week.    Thanks for the kind words Ekrof, you keep me posting here when it feels like a ghost town sometimes. I thoroughly enjoy showing my girls to my fellow bucketeers and basking in their pics as well. I learn so much every time I do something with these plants and my confidence when dealing with unexpected occurrences has skyrocketed over the last few harvests.

What was the initial bucket that you named your main bucket at one stage made from? That you later user to extend the new bucket. That's a good idea
SpaceBuckets,3b17qs,autogenetica,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:41:58 2015 UTC,Cardboard boxes. Think they are 18kilo boxes of litter. About 1 square foot each. Used 3.

SpaceBuckets,3az0vx,LEDwizard,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:35:05 2015 UTC,"LEDs are just fine. Most of the ""UV"" responses will also work with blue LEDs and very few grow lights have UV LEDs.  There's no evidence what so ever that plants actually need UV radiation. UV can boost anthcyanin levels in most plants, for example, but this also happens with blue LEDs.   In my own studies trichome production was increased significantly on the stems of multiple cultivars (strains) of tomatoes by using direct blue light. How this information transfers to cannabis is an open question- don't assume all plants react the same since there's a lot of different protein signal transduction pathways even in similar plants but different strains."
SpaceBuckets,3az0vx,SuperAngryGuy,2,Thu Jun 25 20:10:08 2015 UTC,"There's no evidence what so ever that plants actually need UV radiation.   Well, its circumstantial and has not been replicated in another study."
SpaceBuckets,3az0vx,McJandii,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:25:22 2015 UTC,"Looking over real quick the problems with that peer reviewed study are it appears some of the work was carried out in greenhouses and does not give out the daily dose of UV radiation, some of the work was done at different elevations so there's different grow conditions and there is no comparative study done against blue light.   I can't get access to the PhD thesis.   Until there''s a comparative study against increased blue light then there is still no evidence that plants need UV radiation. A new study- red leafy lettuce cultivars will tend to have more anthocyanin grown outdoors instead of a greenhouse but the same can be done with 100uMol/m2/sec of blue or red/blue supplemental light towards the end of the grow cycle in a greenhouse. source.

Not even sure there is a form of it I would support. DIY and the amazing plethora of different ideas and results is a vast part of the reason I love it here so much!    I'd like to put something up for thought though. The posts made so far at least have kept me aware of the sketchy thieving companies trying to profit off of our people. It could be useful to have a resource to refer to when investigating if a company we have found is scamming or otherwise unsavory. Would it be better to just not mention any of these companies at all, or to have a place where we call them out?    On one hand we don't give them a single view by ignoring them entirely, while on the other we might risk not sufficiently warning our users off of them in time. I'm not thinking of making it front and center, but perhaps a wall of shame warning link on the site or maybe in the sidebar? It may just be better to put a full blackout in effect which I'd agree with, but I'd feel wrong not mentioning the possibility at least.

I usually wonder how you english speaking dudes pronounce my nickname. I think it sounds something like ""ikrof"" (?)"
SpaceBuckets,3aului,Bucketlink,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:08:16 2015 UTC,"In my mind it is 'eh-kroff'. And dude naming a strain after yourself is only egomaniacal if you aren't the founder of the spacebucket movement!    In all seriousness though, you could use all intake fans with a passive filtered exhaust to keep pollen inside the bucket and grow a male in there then begin fertilizing females and develop the Purple Ekrof. I'd smoke that in a heartbeat!    All of the known benefits to spacebuckets aside, it seems the most underrated is how perfect these are for breeding. Zero chance to pollute a tent with other plants in it and easily controlled environments."
SpaceBuckets,3aului,Ashlir,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:16:23 2015 UTC,"Nice, ehkroff is a pretty spot on pronounciation :D  Purple Ekrof sounds awesome.

SpaceBuckets,3aului,Bucketlink,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:14:30 2015 UTC,"A bit of bucket science on this Monday morning.  I didn't wash the perlite thoroughly, it's turned out to be alkaline and pushing the pH up. I saw both plants start to struggle after transplant and soon started showing all the classic symptoms of phosphorous deficiency. A quick checkup revealed the problem and the flushing began. I'm expecting this to be a problem for some time, until it's been through enough cycles to neutralise it,  so I started keeping track of things. My TDS meter turned up today as a bonus inclusion.  http://i.imgur.com/FeXLWR9.png http://i.imgur.com/qKe4DGb.png  Already the new growth is responding and has grown more in the last 24 hours than over the last 5 days.

SpaceBuckets,3aului,Ashlir,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:25:19 2015 UTC,For sure. Next cycle I'll hopefully avoid the spiking pH by properly preparing the perlite before transplanting. The graph's starting to show it stabilising which is what I was looking for.   I'll keep charting it daily but I think it might get pretty boring soon when the pH flatlines.

SpaceBuckets,3aului,SuperAngryGuy,4,Sat Jun 27 16:48:19 2015 UTC,"Valid point but here is my own take on it:  No, but there are lots of people here willing to go out of their way to help you build buckets. You can PM me anytime if you need help!  The problem is shysters/unethical types as exemplified in this archive shot of a liar and thief (truth isn't slander- there is no excuse when they filed a trademark so they knew exactly what they were doing) ripping off the community, making repeated false claims and claiming the idea as their own while having the tenacity of linking back to this community. They then changed their name (they had 3 before so I had to do a little searching not including a bunch of different YouTube accounts) and I ended up in another pissing match with them last week in PM when they contacted the mods.   When I told the main shyster above to go away (I can get very pissy when annoyed and don't hold back in PM or with scammers in general) the response was basically ""we're not going anywhere"" and started immediately posting here again giving some painfully inexperienced ""advice"". They are not growers which is why they had to rip off pictures from this community in the first place. They and others like them will not be allowed to disrupt this community. I just link to that archive shot again and will continue to do so with these guys as needed.  Enough is enough with spammers (who I send the admins after) and scammers (who I go gleefully after).   It is so very easy for the beginner to be taken advantage of. When I grill these people I find they don't know what they're talking about or have just enough knowledge to be dangerous.  Reddit is not and never has been intended as a commercial market place- this is not Craigslist. The quality of the products can not be verified, you have no idea who you're dealing with and I've seen these sort of bottom feeders go after people when bad reviews are given (out of ten grow lights tested, the one from the company I just linked to came in last place. source).  Ekrof has spent a lot of time and effort building up this community and it is completely unfair to have people come diving in, claiming the work as their own and profiteering off his hard work and the community's further expanded ideas.   edit words"

SpaceBuckets,3asu64,caretak3r,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:01:26 2015 UTC,"Sure. Getting an even, thorough watering is the goal. Tricky when you don't have access to the surface of the soil.  I found a single feed line resulted in poor root development for my recently harvested Lee Roy. The root ball was concentrated immediately below the hose outlet and the soil at the edges of the pot had contracted and contained no roots.   I thought this might happen so the proceeding bins use a feed line with two outlets, a single T piece. I'll find out if this was sufficient in five weeks when I harvest those.  But a four outlet feed line was the next step to get an even distribution of water over the surface of the medium.  I'm very keen to find alternative solutions to this problem. I was thinking of covering the surface of the medium with some kind of cloth that slowly lets the water through and increasing the diameter of the hose. That way it could flood the top of the pot and encourage the most thorough watering.  The next photo will show the feed reservoir and how it attaches to the feed line."

For those interested: broad mites don't cause stippling, but inject toxin into leaves (usually new) that causes curling. I read that pyrethrins cause the mite to basically explode and spew all the toxins at once. I decided to risk it in the veg tent. The next morning, I thought it might have been true since those leaves were fine the day before.  We're going to hit everything every 3-4 days with new treatments. Azamax tomorrow, OG Bio after, probably a big cook after, heating the tent and plants to 120 for an hour. We've cleaned everything hard core, of course.

In the second week of veg I added another 50W being driven into a $5 100W COB chip. It's mounted to a heatsink placed in the exhaust airflow.  The 5630 LED strip only draws 22W. Much less than claimed.
SpaceBuckets,3aonmg,ElrosBrotherOfElrond,2,Mon Jun 22 19:34:02 2015 UTC,Nice!  I'm curious. Anyone have credible information about whether hanging branches upside down is better?  I do this with roses and notice that they hold their shape and color better.  I've done it with herbs as well.  I believe the theory is that gravity keeps the fluids in the flowers longer.  Could be bullshit.
SpaceBuckets,3aonmg,ElrosBrotherOfElrond,2,Mon Jun 22 13:56:46 2015 UTC,Makes perfect sense though. If gravity transports resins then I know I'd want it to head towards the flower instead of into the stem.  I'll go get a sock hanger tomorrow.

SpaceBuckets,3aplo3,OrganicTrails,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:39:06 2015 UTC,Finished my brute build about half a month ago. Been playing with lst on this nycd auto my buddy gave me. Slight nute burn and dieing of older fan leafs that are under tha canope not getting light. Oppinions welcome. Anything i should/shouldent do? Was thinking about pruneing all the dead off so she doesent waste energy on them. Should i let h her stay bushy? Shes a auto so i sont plan on pruneing but i might take off yhe deads also any suggestions on how to close/ seal the light leak between the two containers. Some sort of clips maybe?
SpaceBuckets,3aplo3,OrganicTrails,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:58:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, weather stripping for the light leaks! Some clamps of some kind would not be a bad idea either. Did you see SAG's guide to led bulbs? He takes the diffuser off to gain every last lumen.  I don't know about autos specifically, but if the leaves are more than 50% dead you could likely pluck them as you'd probably gain more from the freed light than lose gains to stress."
SpaceBuckets,3aplo3,OrganicTrails,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:26:47 2015 UTC,What's weather stripping? I put a layer of mounting tape on it and it kinnnnda worked but one side still came up a bit so I've been looking for some form of clamp. Just haven't come across them yet
SpaceBuckets,3aoaq2,samlaclaesson,6,Mon Jun 22 03:54:39 2015 UTC,I pulled 35g dried out of one for my first harvest

SpaceBuckets,3aoaq2,spiney_norman,2,Mon Jun 22 14:04:23 2015 UTC,"After drying, I got about 23g or 3/4 of an oz from my first bucket. I made several mistakes and had to figure in extra time for the plant to recover.  I got about an oz from my second bucket. By then I knew how to ph and nute properly, but ran into heat stress issues. I would say a little under an oz is probably a good expectation for someone like me that's new to growing and buckets."

Would definitely be cheaper too. I was in your shoes about 2 months ago. I'm in a legal federal territory and I have space. Started with 2 buckets, went to a brute and ended up with a tent all in a month. Wasted a lot of money along the way with all that upgrading. Buckets are a hell of a lot of fun, but for your particular situation an desired yield, I'd go straight for a tent"

SpaceBuckets,3anjko,caretak3r,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:52:15 2015 UTC,"Hey man. I'll endorse the bin build. The thing a bin grow has over a tent is energy efficiency. If you do it right then every bit of light generated is either hitting the plant or a reflective surface in very close proximity to it, there's no 'spillage'. I just harvested a 140W bin. It used relatively inefficient LEDs and suffered several hiccups along the way. So I'm expecting more from future harvests.  As parts arrive I'm assembling three new bins over the coming two weeks. Each will have a single CXA3070 behind a 100W driver and a 5m strip of 7020 for a total of 120W. I think this will yield a consistent 3oz harvest. I'm taking photos as I go and started today.  I can show you how to build exactly what you want. The journey starts here"

SpaceBuckets,3amupg,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:29:53 2015 UTC,I'd shut them off until the foliage fills out the bucket. From the looks of things it's getting plenty of light where it is and doesn't need to be moved any closer.

SpaceBuckets,3airx4,IdleScV,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:22:43 2015 UTC,How are you imagining this would work? You could encase a vertical grow tower and light it with grow lights. But it wouldn't be very good for cannabis.
SpaceBuckets,3airx4,Bucketlink,2,Sat Jun 20 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"One of the ideas is to mainline it first.  once it's split into 8 cocos, strap them all to the side and drop a light down the middle."
SpaceBuckets,3airx4,Bucketlink,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:11:27 2015 UTC,I see what you're getting at. I'm not sure you appreciate how much light and root space cannabis needs to produce a good crop. And to mainline a plant just to chop it down... that's a few months down the drain right there.  It's an interesting idea but I don't think it would work.
SpaceBuckets,3airx4,OrganicTrails,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:17:38 2015 UTC,with multiple clones or  12/12 from say 4 seeds you could vert scrog decently. Tbyn over at icmag is a legend with vert micros.  PS: I'm trying a milligrow in a vert bucket right now. pictures will come.
SpaceBuckets,3airx4,OrganicTrails,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:43:05 2015 UTC,what do you mean by 12/12 with 4 seeds
SpaceBuckets,3airx4,OrganicTrails,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:16:00 2015 UTC,"ok, if you have a nice sized pot to fit your bucket, put four clones or grow 4 seeds in it, lights on 12/12 (flowering stage) so that you get four main colas (single plants) growing around a vertically placed bulb. Then have a cylindrical scrog or lst your plants as fit. Voila."

While this vape sure is expensive there are lots of well performing ones for cheap.  The flowermate is on massdrop for 79 bucks currently and performs very well for it's size and price.

Dynagro foliage pro and calmax nutrients for feeding.  Coco has been an interesting challenge as it's so different from soil but I can see a few pros already, see how the rest of the grow plans out. First time with an auto too. 21/3 light schedule so far because it's so cold at the moment so the lights are doubling for heat.  Vape is the Cloud Evo. It's crazy efficient. I've been only using my mj I grew in the last bucket grow which was months and months ago. Only just closing on using the last of it up now and I've been using daily this entire time. The vaped herb can be reused for edibles too... It's basically magic."

SpaceBuckets,3af85r,Ekrof,3,Fri Jun 19 18:06:15 2015 UTC,"The assembly is an 11 inch open bottom aluminum cake pan. A Large heat sink is attached to the LED assembly and bonded to an 1/8 inch thick steel bar that is attached to the cake pan internally. The 230mm fan will be an exhaust and. Since I have a glass shield installed in the bucket I won't have to worry about exhausting any smell so the exhaust will be pretty efficient once I make some air vent modifications to the top portion of the bucket.   I'll be uploading a more detailed album once it's complete, I'm still waiting for 2 power drivers to run everything at once.   My plan was to have the two outer rings on the red light spectrum and to mix the inner three rings with blue, white and red light. My thinking is to turn the 2 outer rings off in veg and keep the 3 inner rings on during and once I switch over to flower to turn all rings on. This in combination with my 5630 led side lighting  seems pretty optimal IMO."
SpaceBuckets,3af85r,SuperAngryGuy,3,Fri Jun 19 18:14:12 2015 UTC,11 inch open bottom aluminum cake pan   That's pretty creative and the perfect size!
SpaceBuckets,3af85r,OrganicTrails,2,Fri Jun 19 19:01:11 2015 UTC,Yeah! I'm thinking of makings 3D designed assembly for all the LED power drivers. The cake pan easily slides on and off of the bucket too :)

SpaceBuckets,3adkwp,samlaclaesson,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:32:47 2015 UTC,The CFL you linked to isn't really that efficient at 1200 lumens. You can find a 23 watt CFL closer to 1600 lumens at Home Depot.  You can use the more common 6500K CFL instead of 5000K along with the 2700K for veging and 2700K CFLs alone for flowering.  The really big CFLs can be a pain to fit in to a bucket.

Both the UFO's i've bought have just been the cheap china made ones which is basically everything on ebay. $60 AUD or so for the 90w which honestly after you add up all the cfl bulbs, the wiring etc isn't particularly more. Save on electricity slightly and it gives off far less heat so i don't need as many fans.  You can even flip the fans inside it to extract from the bucket while cooling the LED unit too, pretty good stuff all around.  If you live in america then the Apollo UFO's on amazon have a really good rep. I don't have any issue with the cheap china shit though personally. Worst case a few of the led's may die early or something but i've been using it pretty much constantly for over a year no issues yet."

SpaceBuckets,3acc94,Ekrof,7,Thu Jun 18 23:16:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, I second this.  A common problem is that people don't fully water their plant container but rather just a little on top because they're worried about over watering. Over watering is only a problem when it happens continuously before drying which inhibits gaseous or dissolved oxygen in the root zone and causes root rot.   Most hydroponic systems requires aeration which is why they don't have the ""over watering"" problem. There are meters that actually measure for this.  Give it a good, full watering when dry for now on starting right now and I bet in a few hours the plant will be back to normal. Great looking plants otherwise, BTW!"

Main causes for drooping:  Not enough water (do the two finger test)  Too much continuous watering (this can be very serious since once root rot develops it's game over for the plant)  Root bound (your plant was root bound before transplanting and should recover. This can be strain specific- it will happen to my Hindu Kush x Skunk#1 but not my Grand Daddy Purple x Trainwreck)  Too much nitrogen (you can have too much nitrogen without general nute burn. This can also be strain specific)"

SpaceBuckets,3a79ur,SuperAngryGuy,3,Thu Jun 18 01:22:03 2015 UTC,"You need to monitor the moisture content of your soil and you as just transplanted. Generally speaking, transplant shocked plants simply won't grow for a few days to a week as the plant acclimates to its new environment.  You can monitor your water content by 2 simple methods- the weight test where you pick up the container (this is what experienced growers do) and see if it feels dry or the two knuckle test where you stick your index finger in to the soil to the 2nd knuckle and see if it feels moist. If not water. You need to water the container fully and not just sprinkle some water on top of the soil so the plant perks up. Cannabis roots do not grow in to dry soil.  Too low of temps can also cause this condition. A more ideal condition ambient temp  for cannabis is in the 80's.  These are common mistakes for a beginner and making errors will just make you a better grower down the road since we learn more from our mistakes. We were all beginners once so don't get frustrated.  As a fair warning, the other person giving advice is a very inexperienced spammer."

SpaceBuckets,3a79ur,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:29:06 2015 UTC,You should consider putting the heating pad under or around the the plant pot or under the bucket depending on its water resistance. Heating pads work through conduction not so much convection. You're wasting a lot of energy trying to heat air with a heating pad. There are purpose made heating mats for keeping seedlings warm that might work better/ more safely.
SpaceBuckets,3a79ur,weedbuckets,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:23:52 2015 UTC,"It's actually not bad, the pads take it from 73 to 82 depending on intake speed.  What is your ambient temp and target bucket temp?  The intake air gets drawn through the pad fabric, which I think makes a difference"
SpaceBuckets,3a79ur,weedbuckets,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:37:06 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you got something working. No worries then.   Consider though that if the roots are warm, the air temp won't be as critical. Not sure your location, but where I am, we have cold and snow in winter.

This is really not enough for healthy plant growth and there are much better options. I'm happy to help you pick a light for your bucket if you just want some early veg growth.  Off topic: have you ever heard of aquaponics? I did this in a small set up with LEDs for about 5 years and goldfish.   I still have my duckweed culture going and plan on another duckweed bucket (about 4 years ago I had a duckweed bucket- good fish food).

One so far really helpful redditor has told me that I may have caused Mg lockout by slightly overfeeding at pH 5.8, possibly leading to Ca buildup. He's telling me to deal with the Mg problem by lowering pH to 5.7, which would increase Ca uptake and ""unlock"" Mg for the plant. What's your opinion on this, /u/superangryguy? It sounds counter intuitive to lower pH to aid Mg uptake?"
SpaceBuckets,3a49nw,SuperAngryGuy,5,Wed Jun 17 02:59:58 2015 UTC,"There is not enough of any problem with this plant to make any proper diagnosis. A lower pH would lock out both magnesium and calcium so lowering the pH makes no sense. A sulfur deficiency, being an immobile nutrient, would be more likely to affect new growth.  Magnesium and calcium are right above each other on the periodic table (chemically they are similar, this is important) so they can certainly interfere with each other like sodium can interfere with potassium uptake.  Your best bet is to drive on and stay at around a pH of 6.5 where natural uptake of all nutrients are at a high level."

SpaceBuckets,3a3evs,Bucketlink,2,Tue Jun 16 22:55:11 2015 UTC,"I'd have a look around for a fractionally smaller pot before remaking your bucket. Cut the lip off to allow airflow.  Having the intake below soil level could be a good thing, you're half way to a light baffle."
SpaceBuckets,3a3evs,savonlechat,2,Tue Jun 16 23:23:30 2015 UTC,"Lol, good thing I got a few different pots! Okay, I just transferred him into a smaller pot.

SpaceBuckets,3a3evs,Bucketlink,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:54:49 2015 UTC,"This might be a bad idea, but could you cut a hole in the side of the pot & cover it with a filter/fabric of some kind? That way, air will get through to the soil more easily as well as offer the intake more space to push the air into."

SpaceBuckets,3a3evs,weedbuckets,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:38:18 2015 UTC,Yeah the fan is positioned quite low. A smaller pot would solve the problem. The exhaust is the important part. A lot of people here use a passive intake of just a few holes etc and then an exhaust or two.  I use a smaller fan as intake on the side and it's partially covered by the pot but that's not a problem really.

Just thought I would ask as it seems yours is much more thinned out than my blueberry auto from dutch passion. Must be due to genetics/phenotype.   Living super soils would be one awesome experiment to try. I'd love to dabble in it.   Someone posted this random ""Tales of a Doper"" video and I was pleasantly surprised by it (the guys can get annoying but his grow looks down right legit).   I wish you the best of luck.

SpaceBuckets,39xrcp,citizenblur,3,Mon Jun 15 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yes it is possible to reveg a plant, not sure if you use a cutting or simply leave a couple of branches after harvest and put it back in 18/6..."
SpaceBuckets,39xrcp,Northernlighter,3,Mon Jun 15 18:58:44 2015 UTC,"Yes you can take cuttings off a flower non-auto cannabis plant. And for people answering, reveging is not the same as taking cuts from a flowering plant.  You have to be patient because it usually take a lot longer (it can be +3 weeks) for a flowering cutting to root out since it needs time to revert back to a veg state. You'll see new veg growth come right out of the flowers. Use lower parts of the plant for cuttings because you don't want a cutting with a lot of starch build up."
SpaceBuckets,39xrcp,SuperAngryGuy,4,Mon Jun 15 20:39:09 2015 UTC,"^ yep. Just did this, clones from plants 4 weeks into flower, and it took 2 weeks for rooting, 1 more week for new growth. However, as I've read and now experienced, those clones are the bushiest little things I've ever seen. The hormones directing growth are all over the map."

I just cut a hole in the bottom of my brute so the plant has more room. It was about an inch away from touching my LED and I had to do something.   New solution is working great so far. I raised the brute up higher by placing 3 empty 1 gallon pots under the brute.    Back to your plant, she looks great! nice work, I'll definitely be changing out my spaceblanket lining to copy your much thicker mylar (way neater) and will likely change my side LEDs to the 7020's from the 5050 style I have now."

Overall she is doing very well and it's been exciting to see the fast moving progress.  The slight droopiness in some fan leaves in this update is because I took this pic just before watering her after 5 days so she was thirsty.

SpaceBuckets,39wo7e,Bucketlink,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:29:04 2015 UTC,I have 4 cfls and 2 led strips. She was started outside and moved into the bucket last week. The soil is miracle grow potting soil. What can I do about the lankyness?
SpaceBuckets,39wo7e,SuperAngryGuy,4,Mon Jun 15 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"She was started outside   Keep an eye out for spider mites and other bugs. It's generally a very bad practice to bring an outdoor plant indoors to a grow chamber. Some strains and plants are spider mite magnets (my pole beans always get attacked fast and hard while some tomatoes next to them may be fine).  I've seen this so many times in the last 20 years and know of a recent case where a ""pro"" WA state recreational operation that got nasty a spider mite attack by bringing in an outdoor plant against my advice (""but I didn't see any bugs!"" No, but there were spider mite eggs that you didn't see). Their Dutch Treat ended up with a THC level of 13% while I've seen Dutch Treat from another place tested at +30% (22-25% would be closer to normal).  So just keep a look out on the underside of the leaves for very tiny bugs and any webbing.  edit my grammar sucks"

SpaceBuckets,39wo7e,thethiefstheme,2,Mon Jun 15 22:43:22 2015 UTC,You've done all you can. It should grow more compactly now.  However you'll want to make better use of the space and light within the bucket. I'd suggest topping both of those stretched out nodes. It will give the two in the centre a chance to catch up and encourage a fuller canopy.

Effective April 24, 2015:  • The department must begin work to establish the database.  • No person under the age of 21 may participate in a collective garden or receive marijuana that is produced, processed, transported or delivered through a collective garden. A valid designated provider age 21 or older may participate in a collective garden on behalf of the patient.  • The LCB may conduct controlled purchases from licensed retailers and collective gardens to ensure they're not providing marijuana to people under the age of 21.  Effective July 24, 2015:  • Post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury are added as qualifying conditions.  • A qualifying condition must be severe enough to significantly interfere with the patient’s activities of daily living and ability to function, which can be objectively assessed and evaluated.  • All new authorizations must be written on a form developed by the department and printed on tamper-resistant paper.  • Patient examinations and re-examinations must be performed in person at the healthcare practitioner’s permanent business location.  • Healthcare practitioners who write more than 30 authorizations per month must report the number to the department.  • Healthcare practitioners cannot have a practice that consists primarily of authorizing the medical use of marijuana.  • No more than 15 plants may be grown in a single housing unit even if multiple patients or designated providers reside there.  • Butane extraction is prohibited unless the person is a processor licensed by the LCB.  Effective July 1, 2016:  • All marijuana producers, processors and retail stores must be licensed by the LCB.  • All marijuana and marijuana products must be tested for safety and THC/CBD levels, accurately labeled, and sold in child-resistant packaging.  • Licensed retail stores may apply for and get a medical marijuana endorsement.  • All authorizations must be written on a form developed by the department and printed on tamper-resistant paper. All other forms of documentation are no longer valid.  • Patients under 18 years of age must have permission from a parent or guardian, and must participate in treatment.  • The database becomes operational.  • Patients and designated providers may be entered into the database by presenting their authorization to a licensed retail store with a medical marijuana endorsement.  • Possession amounts change depending on whether the patient or designated provider is entered into the database:  o Entered: May purchase up to three times the current limits at licensed retail store with a medical marijuana endorsement and may possess six plants and eight ounces of useable marijuana; healthcare practitioner may authorize additional plants to a maximum of 15; purchases at retail stores with a medical marijuana endorsement are not subject to sales tax; provides arrest protection.  o Not entered: Patient or designated provider can be arrested but has an affirmative defense to criminal prosecution for possession of up to four plants and six ounces of useable marijuana; may not participate in cooperatives; purchases at retail stores limited to amounts for all adults and are subject to sales tax.  • Up to four patients and designated providers may form a cooperative at the residence of one of the members and may grow the total authorized amount for the four members. Cooperatives must be registered with the LCB.  • A healthcare practitioner may sell or donate to patients topical products that have less than 0.3 percent THC.  • Collective gardens under the old law are no longer allowed. New language allows for cooperatives with specific restrictions."

SpaceBuckets,39x63p,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:09:55 2015 UTC,"$$$  Currently, medical is not subject to the 50-75% total recreational tax. In Seattle city limits there are about 21 places that can sell recreational. There must be 150-200 that can sell medical. The government wants this to change and bring in more revenue.   Most medical dispensaries will be shut down and med users will be paying more at recreational shops. The ""wild, wild west"" of med marijuana will be over next year."
SpaceBuckets,39x63p,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:54:18 2015 UTC,Ah...curious...how does growing your own fit in?  Sounds like there's a good financial incentive to grow your own.  Sounds like there's a perverse incentive to sell it too...Government's never learn that taxes are subject to price theory as well.
SpaceBuckets,39x63p,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:01:53 2015 UTC,"You'll be able to have 4 plants if you're not in the government database, 6-15 if you are. Most co-ops will be disallowed, the ones that are must be registered and will have to go through stringent requirements. This July I will be able to have 15 plants instead of 30 and 6 ounces instead of 3 pounds of dried cannabis flowers .  Most med users do not grow their own.  The black market is thriving and will continue to do so. A black market ounce might be around $200 (15 years ago $320 was typical) which is less than half if you were to buy that amount in a recreational store.   You can sell (""donate in kind"") to a med shop for about $2000 per pound of top quality cannabis. Some places will buy quarter pounds at $500. This will also change next year and most of this gray market will likely go black market.  The changes in the law are a godsend for the recreational growers, processors and retailers but horrible for med users. This is why I voted against the recreational law because I knew it would pretty much shut down the medical side despite the law itself saying that it will not affect med users.  This recreational legalization was a popular initiative voted in 2 1/2 years ago and I believe the WA State legislators must wait 2 years before tinkering with a popular initiative (not all states allow popular initiatives or referendums).  I'll be in the database so I'll still be able to buy clones etc and the changes won't affect recreational grow consulting for anyone."

The citizen initive that would supersede SB 5052.  (2) R-76, a referendum. Keep Medical Access Safe and Separate.    (3) An injunction being filed for July 24 to stop all the closers and concentrate restrictions, etc.  From what I understand, they think the injunction VERY likely to work and that gives them time to organize and pay for signature gatherers for next years ballots for initiatives.   As next year is a presidential election, a large voter turnout will most probably work quite nicely with any pro-pot initiative in our state.  And if stoner nation is poised to show up at the polls, then the candidates will have pressure on them for a pro-pot stand.     The recreational lobbyist are pushing for  initiative I-739, Real Legalization, which is a really good law I think.  http://www.reallegalization.org/  15 plants, 28 oz and cleans up the random legal issues still on the books.  Like if an 1 oz is legal, 1.1 oz shouldn't be a federal thing.    Yes, our law makers got really greedy this time, but I think in the long run it will work out in a true populist WA state way."
SpaceBuckets,39x63p,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:17:46 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for posting this- I did not know about the injunction attempts.  I-1372 will most likely not gather enough signatures to make it to the ballot since you need 246,000 signatures so they'll likely be short by around 200,000 signatures. Only 123,000 signatures are needed for a referendum.   It really does piss me off when the will of the people is superseded by naked greed (we both know what a cluster fuck recreational is and how the Liquor Control Board really dropped the ball).  Real Legalization appears to be sponsored by the med community, not the recreational community. The recreational side does not want the competition.  I agree with your sentiment about next year."

This might be a little oversensitive of me, but please don't confuse the recreational community and the pot business people.  I am a recreational user, I actively support your medical use and absolutely demand the freedoms in the Real Legalization push.

SpaceBuckets,39x63p,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:46:17 2015 UTC,"Hey guys! Been doing lots of research on a bucket and I have my shopping list all made up. I was hoping to get some input on a couple of things such as the primary lighting and the smart pot that I have selected.  I know that the diameter of the light is 11.8"" and the diameter of a typical 5 Gallon bucket is 12"". Would the light be too big? Has anyone else had any experience with this light?  I am also curious on the water drainage process in the spacebuckets. Do you guys empty it out every once in a while or just have holes drilled in the bottom of your buckets?  Thanks for being such a friendly and chill community!"

SpaceBuckets,39x63p,Bucketlink,2,Fri Jun 19 16:10:56 2015 UTC,"OK...you asked for it.    This is SharePoint. It's actually a fairly useful tool for teams to collaborate with document storage, calendars, task lists, etc.  The first version came out in the early 2000's.  I started working where I work in 2005 and the current version then was Sharepoint Team Services 2.0 or STS2.  SharePoint 2003 might be another way to name it.  They'd change the scheme ever major version like they do.  So...back in 2005 STS2 was still the new hotness and while it was clunky, it did a much better job than the previous method of creating custom webpages.  Time marches on and Microsoft comes out with Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 (2007) and then Sharepoint 2010 and now the state of the art is 2013.  Awesome, right??  Except, we never upgraded.  Without getting into too much specificity, there was always a reason not to upgrade even though I started asking in 2008.  Let's just say I work for an employer that is well known for keeping old shit working.  In many cases that's a good thing like when its something they designed and made themselves.  Microsoft doesn't design software to keep working for 25 years, much less 10.  That's why they have upgrades.   So, here we are in 2015 and we're still running STS 2.0 and did I mention it's running on Windows 2003 server?  Additionally, the servers are Dell 2650's.  Don't ask me how they're still running.  Dell obviously made better gear back then. We don't buy their shit anymore.  Then comes the inevitable end of life for Windows 2003.  That's next month.  I'm going to sidestep that STS 2 was eol a year and a half ago.  I failed to notice and no one else noticed either.  The SQL server everything is stored on went eol in 2013 as well. Oops. At the very least, my employer has a thing about running unsupported operating systems.  Security patches, vulnerabilities, blah blah blah.  ;-)  Though, if they were paying attention to the apps closer we probably would have done this back in 2012. So they finally decided it was time to upgrade.  The fun part?  You can't just upgrade from 2003 to 2013.  You have to go 2003>2007>2013 at the minimum.  I ain't doing that.  I don't like the risk that the database gets corrupted during the upgrade.  With Sharepoint, everything is in the database.  Fortunately, there's products out there that can just pull the documents and calendar entries and such from 2003 and dump them in 2013 and even keep the metadata (like create date, last modified, any custom metadata).  The one I'm using is pretty good considering its price.  So, after some testing and a lot of meetings, we started migrating last Friday.  We thought it would just take the weekend. I'm still not done.  Just one snafu after another. Database went to lunch one time. Network Load Balancing shit the bed, the machine the migration software is running on got rebooted for patches two consecutive mornings, etc etc.  Our site is mostly a collection of subsites.  Each team gets their own.  There's considerable variation in how they use their sites. Some are all in to document approvals and task lists, some barely use their site at all.  Some thought it would be cool to dump 98,000 text files into their site to just sit and do nothing since 2006....yes...9 year old text files no one cares about...until you ask them to get rid of them.  No!!! We need those!   Really? We should have made them move them to a file server.  That subsite took over 2 days to migrate. Fortunately, we can do more than one at a time...but not too many.  So anyway...most of the important stuff is done, but now I have to make room on the database server for the last bit and that's not a slow process.  Calgon take me away!"

I now use an untouched 5gal as the main container, and then stack the light-top and LED spacers as I need them. I've found that putting less importance on the bottom bucket makes for a more comfortable grow :)"
SpaceBuckets,39wr2r,Ekrof,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:47:34 2015 UTC,I still have my intake and exhaust wired in parallel. Super annoying since it means my top and bottom are connected. I really need to get a second transformer.

All in all she looks fantastic. The canopy is flat, the stem is huge and the structure is very symmetrical and bonsai-like. There's one weirdly deformed leaf in the top right cola that I may cut to shape, but I'm sure that's not a big deal if I do it during flower.  She's now no less than 15cm (~6"") tall, so she'll probably reach about 30-35cm during flower, which is very manageable in a space bucket.  Flipping tomorrow!

SpaceBuckets,39uyck,LaRuina,3,Mon Jun 15 00:30:42 2015 UTC,"That soil should be fine during the vegetative stage. When it starts to flower you may want to use some flowering nutrients.  Can I suggest not growing an auto for your first grow. The problem with an auto is that as soon as it germinates it's on its own internal timer. If you have any problems before it starts to flower then you're stuck with it, a photoperiod can recover. I don't know why growing an auto is recommended for beginners.  You also can't top them. An important step when growing in a spacebucket.  Edit: Here's a good example of what happens if you have problems before an auto flowers. That is the entire plant."
SpaceBuckets,39uyck,Bucketlink,2,Mon Jun 15 01:12:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. In my opinion starting with a photoperiod is better. You can control size and start clones if you decide to keep a perpetual grow too :) I would also recommend using the Fox Farm Trio to fertilize your plant. It is easy to use and comes with a user friendly feeding schedule. Just don't over do it. Less is more. If you are going to use Fox Farm soils or any other medium that is already loaded with nutrients, I would recommend that you wait until later on in veg ( maybe a month or even longer) before you slowly start feeding your plant at 1/4 dose of nutes and work your way up. Also, you could add some dolomite lime to your soil mix to help maintain proper PH. It is relatively cheap and easy to find. Hope this helps you :)"
SpaceBuckets,39uyck,TannedHyde,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:50:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply, was just confused since i thought soil that already has nutrients in it (the one i linked) doesn't need extra nutrients, since that would be too much.

SpaceBuckets,39teix,pribnow,6,Sun Jun 14 16:25:24 2015 UTC,"One of the power supplies you linked to is an open chassis power supply and therefore dangerous. Go with the encased one at 50 watts. You have to under drive these cheap generic LEDs regardless of heat sink if you want them to last. Everything about them are low quality to include the internal bonding wires.   Go with the VERO 29 (or with lower power versions) if you want a high quality LED that is much more efficient and can be safely ran at full power and then some. You will also know what your color temperature is. The generic cool 100W LEDs color temperatures can have a wide variance as well as a wide variance in electrical efficiency since they are not binned. I've measure some at a color temperature of +9000K (6500K is more reasonable) with a +30% electrical efficiency variance (even at the same power levels some generic 100W LEDs will be noticeably brighter than others).  Cheap LEDs are good practice, though, and the VERO 29 is rather pricey compared to the eBay LEDs.  You do not want to drive these LEDs in parallel off of a single constant current power supply. If one LED gives out like if you have a cold solder joint which is a common problem with beginners then that just increases the current through all the other LEDs. Parallel with constant current means that thermal run away (sometimes called ""current hogging"") can still occur. It's considered bad engineering.  If you don't want to go with the above then you can get a 24 volt power supply constant voltage power supply instead with constant current boost converters.  You do not have to use a 600 watt boost converter- 150 watt boost converters will work just as well.   As a fair warning, most (all?) 600 watt boost converters are capable of output voltage levels that start becoming a shock hazard.  edit grammar"
SpaceBuckets,39teix,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:39:34 2015 UTC,"I always have trouble finding drivers with the correct voltage output. Vero 29s are 38V and the cree cxb 3590 or 3070 are 36V or 77V. Other than super expensive meanwell drivers, I can only find 36V or lower with ebay drivers? Is there a way around that? I never seem to find good voltage with good amps like in the 2.1a range..."
SpaceBuckets,39teix,Northernlighter,2,Sun Jun 14 23:37:59 2015 UTC,"First thing to consider, when it comes to LED lights, the power supply is more likely to give out before the LED. This is a widely known problem in the LED industry particularly with low end, cheap LED power supplies.   Look on eBay for hobby type 70 watt LED power supplies if you want 2.1 amps. Keep in mind that you are working around a naturally damp environment with this very particular type of lighting so keep things grounded.   It all kind of depends on your budget."
SpaceBuckets,39teix,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:27:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the recommendation on the Vero 29's, after seeing how highly they're reviewed I decided to get one for experimentation. I've decided on the 600W boost converter after watching some videos but one thing I have yet to identify is the requisite input current? The unit that Im looking at has a max current of 16A.   From what I understand, the required current depends on how much draw you have so if I only have one 100W LED how can I calculate how much current to provide? I only ask because I know after 10A it's advised that I install a fan. I already have a 12v 6A power supply from a previous project that I was hoping to use, is this sufficient to power a single 100W LED on a 600W boost converter with a 16A max?  Edit:  Rather is this calculation correct? Amps = Watts/Volt = 100W/12V = 8.3 A so I need to give it at least a 9A power supply? I definitely need at least a 9A supply  Edit 2:  Meh, I think i'm just going to get a computer PSU and run it off the 12V cables, every power supply rated for 10A+ had sketchy reviews or was prohibitively expensive."
SpaceBuckets,39teix,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:38:29 2015 UTC,Sounds like you're working through the process!  Now just be careful with that 600W converter. Some are capable of 80 volts output which can be dangerous (I like to keep it below 50 volts DC- your Vero will operate at around 40 volts DC).

SpaceBuckets,39ueb7,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:06:18 2015 UTC,I've been checking the run off about every other watering . It's normally slightly lower than the water going ~ in the 6-6.5 range.

I would really like to hear /u/SuperAngryGuy's opinion. Has the author got their facts straight?
SpaceBuckets,39ryjy,Bucketlink,3,Sun Jun 14 04:32:14 2015 UTC,Has the author got their facts straight?   They are pretty far off in their red/ far red wavelengths. It's more like this.  Pfr drops off  completely in hours in about 2 hours so a 36 hour dark photoperiod really makes no sense for a botanical point of view. There is still a natural protein based circadian oscillator in a plant. A lot of this is covered in the florigen hypothesis.  This is an academic source that is fairly easy to read and more accurate on flower regulation for long and short day plants which are different in terms of red and far red light.   The above only covers the type 1 phtA protein and not the type 2 phtB-E proteins which are not all red/far red reversible. A lot of people don't understand that there are multiple forms of the phtochrome protein each which has its own function.  edit: and the critical photoperiod for cannabis is closer to 10 hours of darkness hours rather than 12 hours (just look at outdoor plants and when they actually start to flower). 10 hours or so of darkness causes a longer flowering time so nothing is gained in yield versus time for indoors unless some tricks are used.
SpaceBuckets,39ryjy,SuperAngryGuy,0,Sun Jun 14 05:16:42 2015 UTC,In other words: just flip?
SpaceBuckets,39ryjy,SuperAngryGuy,3,Sun Jun 14 05:39:02 2015 UTC,LOL....I didn't even read the OP's post! I was just responding to an article analysis request and my name was summoned. You'll see a summoning in PM when your user name is typed a certain way such as /u/JdH-AU
SpaceBuckets,39ryjy,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:55:39 2015 UTC,Haha sorry JDH. Didn't mean to over complicate things.   /u/SuperAngryGuy I'll digest your source soon but can you clarify. Does giving the plant an extended period of darkness before flipping hasten the flowering response?
SpaceBuckets,39ryjy,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:29:51 2015 UTC,can you clarify if giving the plant an extended period of darkness before flipping would hasten the flowering response   This hasn't been established as far as I know in a controlled setting but the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. I'd be willing to bet that it is strain specific and can only give theory since I don't have empiricism on this with cannabis. My gut feeling is likely not working with a wide variety of plants.  I quickly found enough mistakes in the article to not consider it a credible source of information.
SpaceBuckets,39ryjy,Bucketlink,0,Sun Jun 14 06:45:37 2015 UTC,"Boy do I hope it's a girl... I'm quite invested in this plant and it's my last photoperiod seed. If it's male, I'll have to switch over to the auto seeds I have lying around."

SpaceBuckets,39rkwu,CivDis,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:52:28 2015 UTC,Great pics and a healthy plant. The best way to tell when to flush is by checking the trichromes. You can do it with a jeweler's loupe. I've got one like this. It cost less than $5 and is good enough.  Looking at the bud development and pistil colour will give you a rough approximation. I think you have at least another month to go.   Edit: Here's a good discussion thread.
SpaceBuckets,39rkwu,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:18:51 2015 UTC,Yep that plant still have quite a bit of time left. I flush 2 weeks before harvest. Most people do 1 week tho.
SpaceBuckets,39rkwu,Beanspin3,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:00:10 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I'm confused though.    What are the trichomes doing one week before harvest?  I know you don't harvest until ~~40% are gold (or to preference) but I don't know what I'm looking for that will tell me that the trichomes will be ready in a week.  Or is it the process of flushing that gets the trichomes in the right state?
SpaceBuckets,39rkwu,Bucketlink,2,Sun Jun 14 06:22:08 2015 UTC,"I think if you get a loupe and start checking the plant often it will become clear. You'll see the gradual progress of the trichomes forming, becoming cloudy then amber.   You want to get a sense of how rapidly your plant is progressing so that you can predict how things will be looking in a week. If in doubt you could always buy a USB microscope and post the pictures here and we'll help."

SpaceBuckets,39rlew,JdH-AU,0,Sun Jun 14 19:37:04 2015 UTC,"The corsair SP120 series are good. If you can get an SP120L (h100i water cooler stock fan), you're good to go. 38dBA, 4mm/h2o pressure, 74CFM.  The reason why I recommend this over the other fans is because of the very high static pressure, which in my experience is enough to push through a small (4"") commercial filter."
SpaceBuckets,39q0vg,CremeCornetto,3,Sat Jun 13 17:11:30 2015 UTC,I run 2 100w daylights and 2 40w soft white. I have 2 extra ports that can hold somthing brighter if needed but i just have some nice spectrum LED's i there right now. It seems to be working ok but its only my 2nd run

SpaceBuckets,39q0vg,grimnirreaps,4,Sat Jun 13 18:37:17 2015 UTC,135w is recommended but 100w will suffice. Be sure to include led side lighting.  It will give a much better yield.
SpaceBuckets,39q0vg,grimnirreaps,2,Sat Jun 13 20:25:25 2015 UTC,What leds do you recommend for that? Thank you for the advice by the way very helpful.
SpaceBuckets,39q0vg,EXACTLY25SCHMECKLES,3,Sat Jun 13 22:04:30 2015 UTC,I believe cool white or a multi color 7020 led strips are the go to choice in r/spacebuckets.
SpaceBuckets,39q0vg,SuperAngryGuy,4,Sat Jun 13 22:31:48 2015 UTC,I went with warm white 7020s and my plants seem to be responding very well.
SpaceBuckets,39q0vg,Dawnsnightmare,6,Sun Jun 14 00:14:25 2015 UTC,The problem with cool white LEDs is that they have a very large blue light component which we don't want for flowering because blue suppresses a class of hormones called auxins.  It's why metal halides are not traditionally used in flowering at a typical color temperature of 4200K. I've tested some generic cool white LEDs at over 9000K and would consider all LED strips generic.  I have seen some people using strips with cool white towards the bottom of the bucket and warm white towards the top which is an innovative compromise.

SpaceBuckets,39q0vg,Bucketlink,2,Sun Jun 14 15:48:09 2015 UTC,No problems. I use a 90w led ufo and 5 meters of 5050 300smd led side lighting.
SpaceBuckets,39q0vg,Bucketlink,2,Sat Jun 13 22:48:18 2015 UTC,At this stage its the distance from the bulb that's more important than wattage. You can keep a seedling happy under two or even one 20w CFL for the first two weeks. These have been raised under 2 x 23W kept 20cm distant. Only today did I increase the wattage.
SpaceBuckets,39q0vg,Bucketlink,4,Sun Jun 14 02:26:24 2015 UTC,ohh thanks my light was quite a lot closer than that but i have moved back up now to about 20 cm should be good. I think i'm going to grab a 100watt CFL tomorrow afternoon.
SpaceBuckets,39npkz,EXACTLY25SCHMECKLES,3,Sat Jun 13 01:39:09 2015 UTC,"Are those 10W LED bulbs or the 8.5W Philips 800 lumen LED bulbs that uses a plastic instead of a glass envelope that you removed? I saw that Home Depot has the 8.5W units at two for $5, purchased some and opened them up to see how well they would work for a single light cloning bucket."
SpaceBuckets,39npkz,SuperAngryGuy,3,Sat Jun 13 02:20:06 2015 UTC,"I just checked the box and yeah, you're right. For some reason I thought they were 10W. Wishful thinking no doubt. Thanks for pointing it out. I'll update the description for that photo. Do you think it's close to being ready to switch to flower? edit: left out a word."
SpaceBuckets,39npkz,SuperAngryGuy,5,Sat Jun 13 02:35:14 2015 UTC,"No, give it at least another week or two. You have a very healthy looking plant and you may want to top it in a week. The slight wrinkling in the leaves could be because your phosphorus levels are a bit high but no worries.  You plant will at least double in size when you flip to flowering.  My only concern with these particular lights is that they run at about 180 degrees F having such a small heat sink.  The green screws on the top of the lighting sockets are where you should be wiring up your ground wires to since these are metal sockets. Or get a GFCI adapter."

If they run too hot you can just dim them and they'll still make more light than the 5050s.  Then I got 7020s which are better again.

Nice and flat with four symmetrical colas reaching for the sky!   One thing I've been struggling with in mainlining is RH. Because you basically trim it down to the bare essentials in terms of foliage, RH stays low. I was consistently in the 30-35% range, but now that I've got more leaves going, it's raised a nice bit. I may remove some undergrowth before flipping through, but from what I understand low RH is a good thing during flower anyways.  She does look a bit chlorotic, although the yellow lights do exaggerate this a fair bit. I've been feeding half strength nutes so far and will probably up it to 3/4 + root enzymes once I flip her.  Speaking of flipping: how much longer? Maybe four, five days more? I don't want her to get too tall."
SpaceBuckets,39ihlm,bacon_flavored,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:18:51 2015 UTC,"When she is just about half as tall as you want her to be, flip. It'll be a few days before actual flowering occurs so she'll get normal growth before the stretch kicks in."
SpaceBuckets,39iy9m,steveolp,3,Fri Jun 12 01:18:31 2015 UTC,"Miracle grow is pretty bad soil but it won't necessarily kill your plant and a lot of people still have success with it.  A quick Google should give you many results on the topic.  I'm of the mind that you should use a soil with no additives, especially slow release fertilisers and the like because they are often more trouble then they are worth.  Most good plain soil will last your plant for a good chunk of veg on its own and then you can add your own nutrients when needed.  Obviously everyone has their own preference so your mileage may vary."

SpaceBuckets,39iy9m,Hyroero,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:53:16 2015 UTC,Is it an auto or photoperoid?  Transplanting can do damage but normally it just stops growth for a few days then kicks back in.   Autos have a worse time because you can't just keep them in veg to recover and are instead on a preset timer which you don't want to waste.  If it means getting out of miracle grow though I'd probably do it but it's your call really.

Hoping for 7020smd but let me know if this is over kill. I would like everyone's opinion on putting my UFO on a pulley system to bring the light further away from the plant as it grows. The distance from the top of the soil to the lid (where the ufo will be) is about 52cm/20 inches. Does this sound feasible ?   I'm sort of stuck when it comes to the ventilation options however. I want to be fairly discreet as far as smell goes. I'm hoping to have 2 passive intake holes down the bottom with PVC elbows for light traps and 2 powerful exhaust fans on the lid with mesh, Short length of PVC and activated carbon. Will this formation keep it cool enough ? I can always add fans down the bottom if it becomes a problem.    I've chosen a big 4 gallon pot to plant in plus the added height of the stacked bins should produce a fairly sizeable plant provided I get all of the other variables close enough."
SpaceBuckets,39f4pn,Bucketlink,3,Thu Jun 11 08:44:57 2015 UTC,"I love your choice of parts.  Instead of raising/lowering the UFO you should change the height of the plant. I use pot stands to achieve this. You'll need to be on your LST game and anticipate the stretch.  7020 is the best choice and 10m would be great. In this pic you see 5m of 7020 in the centre. Either side is 5630. Those are 60L bins.  I use a large central filter bin to handle airflow and odour control and it works really well. It will handle several more bins so if you're only wanting to filter one, two or three bins you could scale it down and build one using a 4"" fan and filter contained in a standard bucket.  I hope you consider growing the same way I do with the pot outside of the grow bin. It's a very efficient use of space and light. It also keeps the roots cooler which I'm told increases productivity.  Always happy to talk bucket growing.  http://bucketlink.imgur.com/"
SpaceBuckets,39f4pn,Kcry,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:31:42 2015 UTC,Wow very nice setup. I want to grow two plants in the same bin (a rectangle bin with a 300w LED grow light mounted on top)  would that work or is it too cramped?
SpaceBuckets,39f4pn,Bucketlink,2,Thu Jun 11 23:24:52 2015 UTC,Too cramped. Too many compromises have to be made.
SpaceBuckets,39f4pn,Kcry,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:44:25 2015 UTC,If I want to use the 300w light how would I make it so I can get two plants out of it ?
SpaceBuckets,39f4pn,Bucketlink,2,Fri Jun 12 03:14:29 2015 UTC,I think you're in tent territory with that one.
SpaceBuckets,39f4pn,Bucketlink,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:38:27 2015 UTC,"Oh that's a great idea I'll definetly use pot stands instead, I'm so glad I asked.  So inside the bin you have a fan and the carbon filter, do you have a picture of the inside of yours ?   Your set up looks awesome!! I'm guessing as the plant grows you would lower the pot stands and eventually going all the way through the bucket until the pot is outside of the bucket ? This seems like a great idea, no downsides really. Thanks for all of the great info and taking the time to share it."
SpaceBuckets,39f4pn,PhishyPigeon93,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:43:40 2015 UTC,That's exactly how it works. There are downsides. Once the pot's on the outside and held in place there's no going back.   The watering schedule needs to be established because it's very difficult to check the dampness of the soil.  You have to thoroughly inspect the plant for problems which would normally be obvious should you lift the pot out and see the plant in full. Knowing how far it's going to stretch when you go to flower is crucial because there's no spacers.    But otherwise it's all going really well. I'm building a few more very soon.  This is the only photo I have of the inside of the filter bin. That assembly gets put back on and the lip sealed with PVC tape. The intakes are 90mm PVC fittings. The ducting has matching fittings which then slip together making removal very easy. You can see in this pic the first generation light lid. It uses a 120mm fan.
SpaceBuckets,39f4pn,Bucketlink,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:54:59 2015 UTC,I've never see a couple brutes all put together like that before and do you have a watering system as well???

SpaceBuckets,39bt27,Bucketlink,3,Wed Jun 10 20:54:38 2015 UTC,Wow really? I'm so used to hearing another couple weeks I almost can't believe harvest is so close. I'll start flushing tomorrow!  For the closest shots I took out my APS-C Nikon and did the ol' lens in front of a lens trick. Got so close I had to take the UV filter off the front lens.
SpaceBuckets,39e5bn,Bucketlink,2,Thu Jun 11 03:28:50 2015 UTC,"I've done this. The bottom side of most cannabis leaves is more reflective to green light unlike the top so I would go with red LEDs rather than white LEDs in this case.  Blue light, BTW, can force the stomata to open larger than normal by increasing guard cell turgor. Green may partially reverse this affect.  As a strong warning, the light you linked to is a line voltage device and not a safer 12 volt DC device so I would not recommend it under you plant canopy."
SpaceBuckets,39e5bn,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:24:54 2015 UTC,Excellent so it sounds like there is something to be gained by doing this.   Are you sure it operates at mains voltage? The operating voltage is not specified but it does make use of  what looks like a generic 12V driver.  Once the plants are being grown through the opening in the bottom of the bins their feeding is done through a fixed PVC tube and unless that were damaged there won't be any leaks. If it were to rupture then it would drain into the grow pot below regardless. But then again Murphy's law... Condensation is a worry.  https://i.imgur.com/mYC8nwI.jpg
SpaceBuckets,39e5bn,SuperAngryGuy,2,Thu Jun 11 13:02:08 2015 UTC,The operating voltage of the driver itself is 85-286 volts as per the item specs which is pretty typical. It could be used with a 277 volt 3 phase lighting circuits found in many countries.   The output of the driver may be lower but there are close to 150 LEDs on a single driver (very bad and cheap design) so you can't tell just by looks unless you can see the driver label. If the driver output is much over 40 volts (about typical of the dialectic breakdown voltage of skin) then you start having a shock risk.   A GFCI will not protect you from being shocked on the secondary side of a LED power supply.
SpaceBuckets,39e5bn,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:18:58 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks for breaking that down for me. Constructing  my own is starting to make more sense and your resources are already there for me to use. Thankyou!
SpaceBuckets,39e5bn,JdH-AU,3,Thu Jun 11 13:53:56 2015 UTC,"Buy red LEDs were you can see the individual dies, not these which are very inefficient.  And make the heat sink more of a horse shoe shape instead of a complete circle so it can be removed if needed."

SpaceBuckets,39au8g,somnific,2,Wed Jun 10 14:25:06 2015 UTC,That doesn't look like nutrient burn to me. It looks like the opposite. The overall yellowing is a sign of a nitrogen shortage. There's probably plenty of nitrogen there  but it won't get taken up if the pH is out.  Do you have a meter?  upvote for Bunnings pots.
SpaceBuckets,39au8g,Bucketlink,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks Bucketlink, i think you're right.  All three looked pale at the weekend, and the day after i gave them seasol+powerfeed, new leaves appeared and the colour improved.  The pH was good when i planted the seeds.  It's 2/3 osmocote seed raising mix and 1/3 perlite.  I now think it's probably light burn / heat stress.  I've only just realized they're all way too close to the LEDs.  This sick seedling is getting much less breeze than the other two, so it's probably been baked.  It has an unusually strong pot smell compared to the others.  I've lowered the pots about 8cm, and hopefully some seasol will help it recover, assuming it's not terminal."
SpaceBuckets,39au8g,Bucketlink,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:23:45 2015 UTC,But it doesn't look like heat stress. Seed raising mix is low nutrient so your liquid feeds need to be reliable.
SpaceBuckets,39au8g,Bucketlink,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:27:02 2015 UTC,"Heat stress was the wrong term, it really seems like it's been baked.  The leaves feel very dehydrated so i'm not sure how it will fare.  It was about 4cm below the LED and not getting enough breeze.  If it dies it'll make some nice potpourri.  I've only got one air intake on the opposite side of the tub, and the exhaust fan in the middle of the lid, so i really need to fix that.  The internal fan doesn't cut it, especially with the extra LEDs added."

SpaceBuckets,39acs6,VLXS,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:40:36 2015 UTC,Cheap soil (didn't understand the importance of quality soil). It's 30 degrees Celsius at the moment and that's about what it stays. I haven't fed anything yet. About a litre of water a week. The first week I over watered and she had nutrient burn so I left it a week without watering and then flushed her well and I haven't watered in around a week as the soil was still very moist. The ph going in has been between 6.3  and 6.8 but my run off when flushing was a little low around 5.5

SpaceBuckets,397l9f,SuperAngryGuy,2,Wed Jun 10 00:07:44 2015 UTC,Raise the pH to 6.5 or so and I bet most your nutrient problems will start to quickly disappear (even in coco coir) once the nute levels are also taken up from 1/4 strength.  You can use pH strips to directly measure damp soil or other medium.  Growweedeasy is very hit and miss as to the quality/accuracy of their information and would not consider it a reliable single source.
SpaceBuckets,397l9f,LEDwizard,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:25:03 2015 UTC,"Solid advice. I'm not too fussed what happens with the plant. I know I can grow in soil with minimal problems but I wanted to try something new with coco.  Basically just been following what I find on Google in regards to coco which has very mixed opinions, some people preload some don't, some say it has to be at 5.5ph some say it doesn't etc etc.  Regardless I'll go in at 6.5 this round and up the nutes and see what happens. I'll buy some calmag but I figured the dolomite lime I added to the coco would have lasted me for the grow."
SpaceBuckets,397l9f,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:10:44 2015 UTC,So I wstated with close to full strength and got 7.5ph run off.  There is dolomite lime in the soil so I guess as that's flushed out it would be raising it right up? Should I flush with 6.5 until it stays at that?
SpaceBuckets,397l9f,LEDwizard,2,Wed Jun 10 07:29:29 2015 UTC,Do what you have to do to get that pH close to 6.5.  Dolomite lime raises pH so if it's flushed out you would expect a drop in pH.  Too high of a pH can cause a micro nutrient lock up.

SpaceBuckets,396xxj,Toffeemanstan,3,Tue Jun 9 19:39:34 2015 UTC,"Don't think you can clone autos. I could be wrong but it seems to me that once they germinate there's some sort of genetic countdown clock that determines when they flower.  I would think a clone would try to flower at the same time the mother would have. Besides, as stressed out as it is, you might not get a clone to root.  Cut your losses. Give it a good clean death. A soldier's death. Be sure to do it yourself as Ned Stark would counsel. Honor it. Bury it. Move on to the next generation. ;-)"
SpaceBuckets,396xxj,JdH-AU,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:38:47 2015 UTC,No you can't clone autos. I've seen plants pull round from similar damage but can't say if an auto will.
SpaceBuckets,397cpe,savonlechat,2,Tue Jun 9 19:57:18 2015 UTC,I'd wager it's actually lockout from salt buildup and not deficiency.    Whats your PPM look like?
SpaceBuckets,397cpe,quickaeroponics,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:44:17 2015 UTC,I don't know...didn't think I needed to worry about ppm if I was growing in soil! I've only fed it 3 times and each time was either 1/4 or 1/2 strength nutes. I can't imagine the salts built up that quickly.
SpaceBuckets,397cpe,quickaeroponics,2,Tue Jun 9 20:48:57 2015 UTC,"PPM is really useful regardless of the medium, but I do know that a lot of soil (organic) growers ignore it.    That said, with soil measuring the runoff can help you understand if your soil is too hot.    Have you measured the PH of your runoff?"
SpaceBuckets,397cpe,quickaeroponics,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:53:19 2015 UTC,Haven't measured it in weeks actually. What leads you to believe it's nute lockout?
SpaceBuckets,397cpe,TheGreenChandrian,2,Tue Jun 9 21:03:18 2015 UTC,"Mostly just how pervasive/spread out it is.  Usually when I see deficiencies they show up slowly over time, and spread slowly.  I'm assuming your issue showed up fairly abruptly since you're posting about it now.  This to me suggests lockout and not deficiency.    Also, FFOF is typically pretty ""hot"" soil AND is prone to PH challenges.  Further the profile of Dyna-Gro Bloom has probably the highest P ratio of any feed I'm aware of helps support this thought.  Am I certain that it's lockout?  Absolutely not.  It just seems the more likely case.     If it were my plant, I'd check my runoff.  I'd then almost regardless of the reading run a flush with half your normal strength nutes (to help ensure that P is available and the deficiency doesn't get worse)."
SpaceBuckets,397ii8,ElSuperBandito,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"Not familiar with that strain.

Good luck and have fun."
SpaceBuckets,397ii8,Rusty_Clown,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:53:05 2015 UTC,I believe folks have gotten up to 3 gallon smart pots in their buckets. Biggest pot is best pot.
SpaceBuckets,397ii8,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:58:56 2015 UTC,"Okay so maybe 4"" since it'll grow when it flowers and put it in a 3 gal smart pot? Why not directly in the bucket? I don't get the smart pots."
SpaceBuckets,397ii8,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:36:03 2015 UTC,"Smart pots are popular because they breathe.  So if you over water, they'll drain well.  Also the makers claim that your roots will be 'air pruned' rather than cruising around the edge of the pot in endless circles.  You want a pot of some sort so you can take your plant out of your bucket for inspection, watering, pruning, etc."
SpaceBuckets,397ii8,DebaucherousEggplant,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:39:14 2015 UTC,"As far as I know Durban Poison is a heavy sativa which will have the potential to get super tall, so this strain may not be the most conducive to bucket growing. However if you get photoperiod seeds, flip early, and use LST and topping, then it may be manageable."
SpaceBuckets,397ii8,DebaucherousEggplant,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:49:02 2015 UTC,Yeah that's pretty much what I'm trying to do. I heard a good rule of thumb is to divide your end height by 2.5 and flower it once it hits that. So I wanted to LST and flower it once it gets between 4 and 6 inches tall. Do you think that'd work?

SpaceBuckets,397qem,my_arse,3,Tue Jun 9 21:26:42 2015 UTC,I've measured 135W units without white LEDs and 180W with lots of white LEDs (white is a blue LED with a phosphor and not as efficient but does have other advantages) and 6-9 inches is where you want to be for flowering (roughly the 500-1000 uMol/m2/sec range).  Don't worry about brand name- they're pretty much all equally low quality churned out by a few factories in China with someone's label slapped on but still better than CFLs.
SpaceBuckets,397qem,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:13:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Have used cfls in the past in a stealth cabinet but it can be a nightmare constantly moving and adjusting them, wires everywhere."
SpaceBuckets,397qem,has_a_bucket,2,Wed Jun 10 07:24:48 2015 UTC,It likely depends on the power of the light. I have a 90w ufo light and can safely have the plant grow all the way up to it. More powerful lights can bleach the plant if it gets too close. Someone else will have to comment in how close they have the light

SpaceBuckets,394rf7,YourFriendCody,3,Tue Jun 9 18:59:04 2015 UTC,"There are two types of weed plants: photoperiod and autoflowering  A photoperiod (regular) plant matures based on the the amount of sunlight it gets. This is why you have to switch your lights from 18/6 (18 on/ 6 off) to 12/12 to get it to flower. It is also why you can veg these plants for as long as you want.  An autoflower, on the other hand, lives for only a certain number of days and will switch to flowering when it wants, regardless of the light cycle. This is why you can leave it on 18/6 (or whatever you want) for its entire life.  Sick name btw"
SpaceBuckets,394rf7,kriegers-clone,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:55:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation, I grew up around photoperiod grows and never heard of autoflowering until this past year. So you have no control over when it flowers on autoflower? What are the benefits then?"

SpaceBuckets,394577,has_a_bucket,3,Tue Jun 9 03:11:59 2015 UTC,"Hi team. I've been away from growing for a little while, but I have finally set my bucket back up. I'm growing with a 90w UFO light, and I'll be adding some LED strips once my sprout gets bigger. This setup yielded 20g on its previous run.  I thought you might find my carbon filter solution interesting. It's basically 2 PC fans on either end of a PVC pipe bend, with the pipe 1/3rd filled with activated carbon, kept in by a piece of stocking. It lasted a whole grow cycle with minimal smell. If there is interest, I'll pull it apart and post pictures once I fill it with carbon when i switch to flower (it's presently empty).  The seedling is a feminised Mazar x White Rhino from World of Seeds I got as a freebie a while ago. Anyone else grown this strain?

It's much easier to control light distribution, especially since LEDs don't penetrate the canopy much. The light is on the lid and does not heat up much, so the plant can grow all the way up.  I switch to flower the moment I've LSTd the plant to cover the whole pot surface, to maximise upward growth space."

Hopefully I'll get it all sorted out before the parts get here!    But through this, I'm accumulating some to scale, usable models of common bucket parts (that I'm using or have tried out).  These might be useful for others who are planning buckets.  If anyone is interested in them, I'm totally willing to share!"
SpaceBuckets,3915as,heyybud,8,Mon Jun 8 14:18:33 2015 UTC,I've been using one of these for some time now. The airflow absolutely justifies the noise.  Does your UFO use a standard diameter PC fan? If so you could remove the existing one and fit a stronger unit.

SpaceBuckets,3915as,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:27:01 2015 UTC,I should also mention I flipped my UFO fan to make it exhaust and it also sits entirely out of the bucket already

SpaceBuckets,38yi7f,Green4Jesus20,2,Sun Jun 7 22:43:39 2015 UTC,"You can put them in flower early, sex them once they show their gender (I think that takes at least 2 weeks) and then put them back in veg to fill them out properly to maximize your yield.   I'm considering that or maybe banking on luck."
SpaceBuckets,38yi7f,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:20:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that sounds like the best way. Just wasn't sure if they could go back and forth between veg and flower."
SpaceBuckets,38yi7f,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:28:34 2015 UTC,"It's the best way if you have to know. It will come at a cost of time. Each switch is going to slow growth and require a recovery time. That's the balance I'm weighing, whether my need to know is worth the extra weeks finding out would cost me or if it's worth taking a chance and getting an earlier harvest at the risk I find I have a male after switching to flower. If I only veg for 4-5 weeks that's close to the 3+ weeks I'd lose finding out for sure. An alternative is to grow 3-4 separate plants and play the odds, expecting to lose up to three but maybe just one or none but still having some harvest. That would require extra bucket setups though.   Edit: having six puts you in a good position if you have buckets for all of them."

SpaceBuckets,38xjsq,thwart_your,5,Sun Jun 7 18:17:56 2015 UTC,The comments on that article are just annoying. People who know absolutely nothing about indoor grows saying its not sustainable. Space buckets pushes the limits with space constraints so that's easily proved wrong.
SpaceBuckets,38xjsq,Entreps,2,Sun Jun 7 21:13:49 2015 UTC,"Sustainability refers to the overall use of resources to produce the product and whether that production renews any of those resources. In that regard, indoor growing is definitely unsustainable compared to growing outdoors, especially if permaculture methods are employed. Large scale conventional factory farming techniques, despite being outdoors, also aren't sustainable.   Indoor growing could be closer to sustainable if renewable building supplies are used and a renewable energy source is used as well as composting and vermiculture but there would still be a lot of manufactured consumables like lights and batteries which would work against sustainability."
SpaceBuckets,38xjsq,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:34:08 2015 UTC,"At the same time though, combining indoor high-yield agriculture with outdoor urban agriculture would free up rural and peri-urban areas to be converted land for ecological conservation and carbon sequestration."
SpaceBuckets,38xjsq,has_a_bucket,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:30:51 2015 UTC,"That's possible but how would you ensure that happens? I see indoor being used in an additive fashion rather than as a replacement. Are you expecting the prices to drop and put rural farmers out of business? Are they the ones that will convert to indoor? Is the government or a private group going to buy them out?  Indoor growing will have a place. If anything, it might be good for off season production and thereby reduce fossil fuel consumption for transport. It may even supply the majority of urban food. I just think the sustainable label is a tough sell in the near term. The level inputs is pretty high."

IIRC, the cannabinoid ratio is heaviest in THC when they're milky and that it tips towards CBD as more trichomes turn amber. So, if you want a more heady, energetic (possibly paranoid) high, go now. If you want that mellow body high from CBD, wait longer.  I'm not sure if the THC level stays steady and it's just the level of CBD that changes or if the THC metabolizes into CBD or if the THC just somehow decreases by some other mechanism and CBD increases independently. In any event, that's what should determine your timing after you have a solid majority of milky trichomes."
SpaceBuckets,38y7b3,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:10:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. The microscope that I got did contain LEDs to better illuminate the spot that it is trying to focus.

SpaceBuckets,38wti8,SuperAngryGuy,2,Sun Jun 7 15:16:50 2015 UTC,Chlorosis (yellowing from lack of chlorophyll) on top of a plant this small is typically sulfur or magnesium problems. Adding some Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) would likely correct this problem.
SpaceBuckets,38wti8,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:12:43 2015 UTC,I see a bit of bronze colouring. Would it be related?
SpaceBuckets,38wti8,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:14:13 2015 UTC,"It's the new growth that I'm looking at so bronze could be your perception instead of yellow.  If I'm not mistaken, this plant had pH problems before so if it's the fan leaves' spots you're talking about, it's likely older damage."
SpaceBuckets,38wti8,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:24:04 2015 UTC,The new growth. I noticed JDH talking about it here describing a rusty colour. I think I see it too and just wanted to see if it struck you as anything in particular. The yellowing is clear.
SpaceBuckets,38wti8,SuperAngryGuy,3,Sun Jun 7 16:27:23 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's a little more information and the pH appears a bit low at 5.8. JDH, get the run off pH in the 6.2-6.6 range.  Rusting, bronze, yellow etc, it's all different stages of chlorosis in this case and on the very top of a plant is typically a sulfur issue, chlorosis in the middle part of a plant is typically a magnesium issue (it could be iron but micro nutrient deficiencies are rare in most prepackaged soils. Sulfur and magnesium are considered secondary macro nutrients).  This plant is too small to say for sure if it's sulfur or magnesium problems but Epsom salts would correct them both. My money is on sulfur since it is highly immobile in plants and particularly affects new growth area. It is vital in the manufacture of chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll.   If it were pH lock out then we would likely be seeing some phosphorus deficiency problems, also (brown splotching on the leaves where the splotches have smooth edges)."
SpaceBuckets,38wti8,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:55:15 2015 UTC,"With runoff, what relationship are you looking for in relationship to soil pH? If your run off is 6.6, for example, what would you expect the soil pH to be?"
SpaceBuckets,38wti8,SuperAngryGuy,3,Sun Jun 7 17:13:14 2015 UTC,"This is hard to answer because you can have an acidic (perhaps from lots of peat), neutral or alkaline soil (perhaps too much dolomite lime was added) to various degrees. Specific fertilizers can be more acidic than others and a salt build up could influence pH levels.  So the best answer I can give is ""it depends""."
SpaceBuckets,38wti8,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:27:01 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Any advice on determining actual soil pH? I suspect those in situ pH meters the hardware stores sell aren't that effective. I suppose the most effective method is to dissolve a sample in distilled water (in some specific ratio I imagine) and measure that.   Edit:  I guess my aged brain can still science.

SpaceBuckets,38wti8,SuperAngryGuy,0,Sun Jun 7 23:00:01 2015 UTC,I'm growing in coco. So isn't my pH supposed to be 5.8? And aren't micro problems more likely in coco?
SpaceBuckets,38wti8,SuperAngryGuy,2,Mon Jun 8 01:52:07 2015 UTC,"You will get many opinions on the proper pH for coco coir. I can tell you this for both hydro and soil after 20 years: I've never ran in to a single problem by keeping the runoff pH or hydro solution pH closer to 6.5 no matter what the medium or grow method with cannabis.   The phosphorus lock up pH is very sharp at around pH 5.7-5.8.  Micro nutrient problems can be more of an issue with coco depending on the fertilizer and what ever additional medium supplements you're using but does have iron, manganese, zinc and copper. You water likely has some chlorine in it (chlorine is a micro nutrient). I see either a sulfur (most likely) or magnesium problem (have you had your water tested for Mg levels? It's a macro nutrient so needs a lot more than a micro nutrient).  I look at your pics and don't see the red you're talking about. You should be concerned about the yellowing because that means that not nearly enough chlorophyll is being produced. No chlorophyll means no photosynthesis."
SpaceBuckets,38wti8,SuperAngryGuy,0,Mon Jun 8 03:43:09 2015 UTC,Here's an updated picture. Clearly some chlorosis going on. What do I do? Epsom salts or Cal Mag?  http://imgur.com/F4iK9Md
SpaceBuckets,38wti8,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:18:34 2015 UTC,Epsom salts which is magnesium sulfate. I don't see any calcium problems (calcium deficiency would be leaf edge burn and blossom rot- it's popular to use a little higher calcium levels with lettuce since lettuce with leaf edge burn doesn't sell).
SpaceBuckets,38wti8,HubbleSpaceBucket,0,Mon Jun 8 03:48:16 2015 UTC,"I've been reading a bit more and it seems to be Sulfur indeed. This surprises me, since I would expect canna nutes to contain enough of this. Should I prepare a pH 6 foliar spray with some Epsom salts?"

SpaceBuckets,38v383,Lleaff,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:53:19 2015 UTC,"The base to my organic soil is 1/3 peat moss, 1/3 compost or worm casting and 1/3 perlite. No vermiculite.  To that you add 2-3 cups of amendments (kelp meal, guano, tomato feed) per cubic foot of soil. Also add a cup or two of rock dust and some dolomite lime ( i forget how much lime though).

SpaceBuckets,38u348,VLXS,2,Sat Jun 6 23:15:54 2015 UTC,"Scrog basically, must people use 7 inch trellis netting. Indoor you train through the screen, kind of weaving the plant in it. Outdoors you just want to top them often and then tie the main branches to the net. It keeps the plant flat so all the tops are spread and getting good light. In nature they grow straight up because they want to compete for light and open breeze. They put energy into the tops because that's the most likely place they'll be pollenated. Cut off anything that isn't getting direct light."
SpaceBuckets,38u3oe,teamsotirous,3,Sat Jun 6 20:57:41 2015 UTC,This is just the test build yeah? You're going to need an exhaust fan at the very least and some duct tape around the bucket to make it light proof.  You can get 4 socket light adaptors on Amazon like this http://www.amazon.com/LimoStudio-Quality-Socket-Photo-Adapter/dp/B0091HO0FY which would be much safer. You could cut a hole to for it on the lid and sit it on top of the lid for a pretty easy installation.
SpaceBuckets,38u3oe,Hyroero,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:24:16 2015 UTC,"yea plan on installing fan system, raised lid to about a 2 inch gap for ventilation until then.

The bulbs are well under the watt limits for the prong/adapter components and the exposed connection points are sealed with electrical tape"
SpaceBuckets,38u3oe,Hyroero,3,Sun Jun 7 00:28:21 2015 UTC,"It's probably not too bad honestly but you can never be too careful imo. Guess it just doesn't look that secure is all, I've had some had some had personal experience with cfls falling down and burning plants etc so I'm a tad paranoid.  Part of the reason I switched to a led ufo which I'd also highly recommend, but that sets you back around $50 bucks or so."

SpaceBuckets,38t2mt,autogenetica,2,Sat Jun 6 16:04:53 2015 UTC,"As I don't know what soil or nutes you've been using I can't really say what to do but I would say using any nutes on a plant this small is a bad idea. Overwatering can also cause yellowing so go easy with the flushing. The soil should be moist not soaked, it encourages roots to grow out and lessens chance of root rot.  If the soil you're using is a garden soil then its almost certainly got nutes in it, enough to last most if not all the veg period with only water needed. If you want to add nutes then wait until its a little more established then start with a heavily diluted solution and build up slowly.  Also have a little patience, plants grow at different rates and can take a little to get started, especially if they've been stressed as most of the energy is being used to repair not grow. Autos also seem to take longer to establish than regular plants but once they get going they do grow quickly."

It may seem like it isn't going anywhere, but as long as the conditions are good, you water it right, it should start to perk up....those first leaves are what powers her up...any damage to them and it takes time to recover...once she has more leaves then it should go well. I've been using Canna Terra Pro Plus soil and it's working great for me! As Toffemanstan just said, if it's an auto..then that will be even more slow...mine was an auto too.

SpaceBuckets,38upmj,growtech86,3,Sun Jun 7 00:03:31 2015 UTC,The top lights in that bucket are regular AC LED lights. The cord is chopped to daisy chain wire the lights together.  The side lights were AC lights with the LED module itself removed and remounted on a heat sink but I'm still using the original AC power supply. This requires a little bit of hacking and it would be easier to use low voltage LEDs strips instead.  All of the lights are on the same timer.

My normal plan with none auto's was to grow them up into a scrog in the first spacer then when that was full flip to flower and keep stacking spacers to accommodate the extra growth.  My mates bucket couldn't deal with the extra height so he had to do a bit of emergency tying down to keep it in order but even then it all turned out ok."

SpaceBuckets,38s6lh,regal8r,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:09:04 2015 UTC,"I will say to remember that you should get the beginning of your training down first like all of your intended mains. Don't just let it grow straight to where you want to flip from when considering it could double in height.    Top, lst, etc so that it is a nice and full plant then let all of those new mains rise to where you want to flip from. Once you flip and flower stretch begins is NOT where you want to hope to start training. You will get new mains shooting off after flip but you want to keep those pruned off so energy focuses on your intended mains.    So if you want more than those 4 colas you want to have them up first before flipping."
SpaceBuckets,38s6lh,bacon_flavored,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:50:48 2015 UTC,"Also, pay attention to the genetics of the strains you are growing.

If it is Indica or an Indica dominate hybrid it will still stretch but not as much and will tend to stay a little more squatty."

I just did an experiment where I let my last plant stretch (chemdawg), and I had way more problems than just finding room. For example, the top parts of the plant touched the lights causing light / heat stress, while the bottom didn't get much light at all. So then I added an LED strip at the bottom, but that generated even more heat causing some yellowing around the base. I added another fan, but I'm afraid this cycle won't generate nearly as much bud."

For my own liability reasons alone this is a project that I would have nothing to do with. As a former electrician I've seen too many problems and all mechanical devices like fans can fail.  Get rid of this light and go with LEDs is the best, safest advice you'll receive. In addition, a 150w HPS (about 100 LPW) does not have nearly the efficacy of a 600w HPS (about 150 LPW).

SpaceBuckets,38mxtt,HubbleSpaceBucket,3,Fri Jun 5 17:36:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is a fire hazard! Don't run that bulb without proper ventilation. PC fans won't cut it. Get a proper inline fan and until then turn your setup off.  Cheers"
SpaceBuckets,38mxtt,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:39:39 2015 UTC,"Since the light is sitting on top of the box, and hence not in it, wouldn't that make the heat more of a non-issue? The ballast and the housing for the light itself are what seem to really heat up and they are both outside of the system. The inside doesn't get hot since the light passively vents itself outside of the totes.  Would you still advise against running it like this?"
SpaceBuckets,38mxtt,enteater12,2,Fri Jun 5 18:01:40 2015 UTC,"Would you still advise against running it like this?   Yes! It would be irresponsible of us as a community to recommend you otherwise. In the end you can do what you want, of course. The coolbox is better than nothing but HPS bulbs get very hot and they can melt the bucket plastic. That is a safety hazard to me. Stay safe and keep us updated :)"

SpaceBuckets,38lmsu,HubbleSpaceBucket,3,Fri Jun 5 09:33:50 2015 UTC,"Number 53 is made up of the vibrations and energies of the number 5 and number 3. The number 5 relates to the attributes of release and surrender, freedom, progress and motivation, versatility and adaptability, courage and making positive life choices.  Number 5 is the number of taking chances and major life changes. Number 3 relates to creativity, personal charisma, community and sociability, expansion and growth, joy and optimism, communication and self-expression.  Number 3 also resonates with the energies of the Ascended Masters, and indicates that they are with you, assisting when asked. The Ascended Masters help you to focus on the Divine spark within yourself and others, and assist with manifesting your desires. They are helping you to find peace, clarity and love within.  Just kidding...  Any where near or after month 2 and the trees start looking great.  But I've never mainlined and only have seen beginning and end. So the middle seems like a cool spot.

Once the root shows, put the seed in some wet soil or coco (depending on what you want to do), root down and wait for it to break the soil. Make sure to start supplying light after a day or two even if it hasn't popped yet. If the seed pops in the dark,t here's a chance it will stretch a fair bit to search for light.  Mind you, bag seed is usually the result of a hermie plant self-pollinating. This means you're likely to either get a genetic hermie or a plant which is prone to becoming hermie under stress.

SpaceBuckets,38ldy2,grimnirreaps,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:53:13 2015 UTC,"Yep! Make sure your fans deliver enough air after putting the screens on. The Silverstone screens without the mesh is great for just protection, and will deliver way more air then with the mesh on."
SpaceBuckets,38ldy2,grimnirreaps,2,Fri Jun 5 02:19:15 2015 UTC,"Yea, I was kind of upset about those silverstones! With the mesh they absolutely kill airflow.

Replaced all my fans with them.  Basically, I felt very little to no airflow out of it. My temps are already running a little high, so I couldn't sacrifice the ventilation. I can't speak to the smell reduction. Your updated design adds a second fan spacer?   Each fan has its own 1 amp power supply. They were each both molex and cut and adapted.   I'd love to try out your newest design. If you need me as a guinea pig to try some of your experiments, I'll help as much as I can. Just let me know. I think it's a great and simple design that a lot of people could easily replicate in their own buckets. I apologize for not telling you about it not working out"

SpaceBuckets,38iycp,BucketCharlie,3,Thu Jun 4 15:06:57 2015 UTC,"My first grow and my first real update since sprout.  I have a few lessons learned already.  Things I did wrong (which almost killed the seedling):   Growing an auto.  I thought this would be better for a beginner to not have to really worry about light cycles and stuff, but I see now that using a photoperiod would be better because you can leave it in veg for as long as you want to recover from stupid rookie mistakes. FFOF is too hot to use in a starter cup for a seedling.  Also using a starter cup at all was a mistake for an auto since the stress of re-potting is not good for it. Over-watering the seedling, followed by overcompensation for that which lead to under-watering. Not enough soil in my start cup.  This is pretty self explanatory and was dumb on my part.  I realize now that I've transplanted to my big pot that my seedling was likely root bound after just a week in the starter cup because of lack of soil/room.  The plan is a little undersized now as a result.   Things I did right:   The bucket itself is working well and I'm happy with the overall build. pH, RH, internal bucket temps have been stable.   This post shows 20 days from sprout, so I'll split the difference and call it day 10V. It is looking much better now than just 3 or 4 days ago when I made some adjustments.  Questions I have now:   When should I start fox farms trio nutrient schedule at 1/4 strength? Just in the last 24 hours I've got some yellow tips as you can see if you look closely in the pic, is there any immediate action I should take for this? Can I do some light LST on this plant in the coming weeks even though it is an auto?"
SpaceBuckets,38iycp,Bucketlink,3,Thu Jun 4 15:18:08 2015 UTC,From the sounds of things you've learnt more in the first few weeks of this grow than some do over several.  1) Not for several weeks. FFOF has tons of food. TBH I'm not sure if I'd use nutrients at all until it starts to flower. But I've never grown in FFOF so I'm not really qualified to answer.   2) Because you're not using nutrients yet there's not a whole lot you can do. Burnt tips are typically from excess nutrients. Which in your case the nutrients are already in-situ in the soil. So there's not much you can do until your plant grows and uses all it can gather. This all hinges on your pH being on the mark.  3) Sure. But like you said leave it a few weeks.
SpaceBuckets,38iycp,EXACTLY25SCHMECKLES,2,Thu Jun 4 15:39:20 2015 UTC,My pH is actually too low since transplanting to the 3-gal pot a few days ago (~5.5).  I'm planning to go with pH 7 water to compensate with the next watering this evening.  Should bring my runoff into the 6s and I will make adjustments as necessary from there.
SpaceBuckets,38jllq,Macman7thst,4,Thu Jun 4 17:32:29 2015 UTC,It looks like it has some heat stress.

SpaceBuckets,38gmpr,Bucketlink,3,Thu Jun 4 02:17:17 2015 UTC,Try a steadier photo next time. You need really fine detail to discern trichome color. Get your hands on a 60-100x pocket microscope or jeweler's loupe to verify with accuracy what's actually going down.
SpaceBuckets,38gmpr,common-object,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:13:53 2015 UTC,They look ready. Very few white hairs and lots of Amber/orange hairs is a good sign
SpaceBuckets,38fw5q,alfredina,5,Wed Jun 3 23:09:26 2015 UTC,"First of all, your plant is overwatered. This interferes with nutrient absorption.  Secondly, whilst it could be phosphorus deficient, my money is on a pH-related lockout. In that case, any amount of nutes isn't going to help you. Get a cheap pH meter and check what you're putting in."
SpaceBuckets,38fw5q,JdH-AU,2,Thu Jun 4 01:45:48 2015 UTC,"This is the advice to listen to.  The plant's still very young and still hasn't formed its first set of true leaves. Those rust spots are a dead give away of a pH issue.  Get a meter and some PH up/down ASAP. Adjust some water to 6.5 and flush this baby out. But when you do, capture the first 100ml of water that comes out the bottom and test the pH.   There are no signs of the plant starving as of yet. You'll see an overall, progressive yellowing starting in the older leaves. This is what it looks like."
SpaceBuckets,38fw5q,Bucketlink,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:55:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the help, JdH-AU too! Should I get a pH meter that tests soil or water specifically?"

SpaceBuckets,38fw5q,Bucketlink,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:03:29 2015 UTC,"Nice, though I don't want to wait so I'l get one in a shop asap. Guess I'l just get whatever is in store.  Just for clarity, am I supposed to make some 6.5pH water and flush the plant with it, then test the runnof of the soil and correct for it?   I had a 1 m tall plant previously that went belly upp in a matter of days because I think I managed to over water it. So I'm hesitant of doing a flush when JdH-AU claims my new plant is also over watered. Should I wait for the soil to be completely dry first?"
SpaceBuckets,38fw5q,terxmonster81,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:30:39 2015 UTC,Yes wait until the soil's dry and the new growth has (hopefully) perked up a bit. Just make a note of the runoff pH this time and use that measurement to determine pH next watering.  Go all out with the flush. Don't be afraid to run 10l through it.

SpaceBuckets,38gfsf,TheGreenChandrian,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:14:55 2015 UTC,It's probably in shock. That's a nasty PH problem there.  How often have you been watering? Once a week/twice a week?
SpaceBuckets,38gfsf,Bucketlink,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:49:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it has been a real pain trying to correct the pH. I'm really disappointed in the FFOF soil. Honestly, I might just use the remainder of the bag for vegetable gardening and make a super soil blend for my cannabis plants.   The soil has been drying out in ~4-5 days. It's a 2 gallon smart pot so there isn't much soil in it to retain moisture. It has appeared to have stopped growing vertically and has been producing more and more side growth underneath. I'm hoping it will start flowering in the next couple weeks."
SpaceBuckets,38gfsf,Bucketlink,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:07:13 2015 UTC,"Have you got a digital meter? It can be pretty hard to adjust things accurately without one.   I think FFOF (never used it) is meant to be used as the bottom fill of a pot with a milder, forgiving soil mix on top to avoid seedling burn etc.  This is a perfect example of why autos are not good as a first time grow. Any problems like this during veg and your yield goes out the window."
SpaceBuckets,38gfsf,sb_the,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:13:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, I use a digital pH pen and have been getting in the habit of calibrating before each use. It's a bit of a hassle, but that's what I get for grabbing a budget pH pen! It has never been off more than +/- 0.1 when measuring the calibration solutions, so I trust it (to a point).   I think you're onto something about FFOF being used as a bottom ""super soil"" layer. I think I'm going to adjust how I begin the grow, and start the seedling in some Light Warrior seedling mix. Then I'll transplant to a 33:33:33 FFOF:LW:Perlite. I have begun to disagree with the idea of autos being planted in their final containers right off the bat.   Definitely going to grab some photoperiod seeds for when I finish the last autoflower seed. Do you think this plant will produce much or am I looking at a really small yield?  I feel like I've learned some valuable lessons. Ones that can only learned through trials and failures."

SpaceBuckets,38dhbb,bacon_flavored,4,Wed Jun 3 16:01:08 2015 UTC,"You'll find the items on the home page of the website, and also on every bucket profile.

This is free if you know where to look. I haven't bought any bucket in all my bucketing years, ask around construction sites and they'll give them to you gladly. You need about 5 buckets per Space Bucket you want to build, as you need to make some spacers too. Some sort of UFO LED light. Like this 135w, 180w works too. You can add some mighty 7020SMD LEDs for side-lighting, thats very recommended and easy to do. You probably have some PC fans laying around. You need a 12v 1A power supply for every two fans that you want to use. You can also get 110v fans if you want an easier installation. A power strip to connect all the things. Like this one. The higher the quality, the safer you'll be.    And that is basically it! Plug all the items and you get a Space Bucket. You'll need to make some holes on the bucket for the fans and the light.

I'm amazed at the experimentation & engineering that has takenlace in my absence from the scene. Quite a departure from the ""grow it, glean it, toke it & hope for the best"" philosophy of my day. Like most from that period, I soon conformed to parameters defining a respectable family man & gave up the hobby. The temperance demanded by my career in government service was also a deciding factor. Fast forward almost 40 years: Recently while at our vacation home, I had an invitation from my good friend & neighbor (a remarkably young 72 years of age) to join him for some coffee & brownies that his daughter had sent him. Not a big fan of brownies but always enjoy visiting him, I accetped. After a couple of goodies & several minutes of conversation, I suddenly realized his daughter's brownies weren't so innocent. I couldn't contain a rib-splitting bout of laughter; possibly over my naivety or simply a re-introduction to a sensation from so many years ago. We both laughed until we cried & enjoyed a most pleasant afternoon! Now, being 12 years retired, kids long grown & gone & enjoying an overwhelming sense of independence, I'm planning on making up for a lot of lost tme.

I've been researching the space bucket for about a week now and I'm super pumped to get my own started. I'll probably be posting here more often if everything goes well and as planned!

SpaceBuckets,38dhbb,enjoi577,3,Fri Jun 5 13:10:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. That depends. How many lights have you got? How hot does the room get? Do you want to build more buckets in the future? How much noise can you tolerate? But how badly do you need the smell gone is most important.  I never got a single bucket filter to work properly. I built a few different single bucket DIY filters but none of them did a very good job. If I was only going to filter one bucket I'd still build a dedicated filter bucket. I'd get the 4"" version of the fan I use now and a 4"" 125cfm Phresh filter.  It'd be housed in two buckets sealed lid to lid. The air could enter the top bucket any way you wanted and would get sucked into the filter and down into the second bucket which would have its own exhausts. Like this. It's really excessive for one bucket but it's been done. With a dedicated bucket you can keep adding buckets to the stack. This is how you end up with a goddamned space station!  I'm going to modify a cupboard in the future."

Bucketlink,  I mentioned to the most honourable Senior Ekrof that this facet of the endeavor is the singular impediment which keeps newcomers reticent to begin the hobby.  Perhaps we could figure the other stuff out (lights, germination, LST) but air filtration remains a nebulous and scary concept that might be beyond our grasp.

Will CFL's bring a rather tall, lanky, fluffy, airy yield as opposed to an HPS bulb?

Sometimes spacers with root trays are needed with this particular mat because it can get a little too warm unless you get a different mat with a thermostat. I don't foresee this being a problem with a bucket, though.  Another trick that might work in a 5 gallon bucket but certainly in a brute bucket is to use a small fish aquarium heater, stick the glass heating element in a beer bottle or some other similar container full of water, tape it off really well and you have yourself a little heater typically with a built in thermostat.

I have a strip of 5050 LEDs in my other bucket which I might put in here too but I'm not sure if it'll be overkill seeing as the UFO LED grow light is '225w'. I made some light traps for the fans. I just used a cardboard box and duct tape. Made a flat inside the main housing so there's a 'corner' to trap some more light. Added a nifty new power supply. I don't know a whole lot about it but my friend who is a bit of an electronics guru and loves playing around with AV stuff recommended it for running LED strips.

You'll see that there was a pretty wide variance to the efficacy (how well something works) of nitrogen foliar feeding.  I'd probably hit the lower leaves with some nitrogen in this case although just a regular fertilizing may be just about as effective since nitrogen is very mobile in plants and soil. The high mobility is why the lower leaves show the yellowing from older nitrogen rich areas no longer growing (fan leaves) to transport nitrogen to the new growth areas as needed unlike some other deficiencies where yellowing begins on top. The plant is essentially cannibalizing itself and reusing the nitrogen elsewhere.  When foliar feeding a plant, use a drop of liquid soap in the spray container- it'll greatly help break down water tension and allow easier absorption.  Fertilizer foliar feeding is different than these wonder hormone additives/flavor enhancers/bud enhancers/or other types of snake oil foliar supplements. Don't waste your time.  I prefer to just run higher nitrogen levels than normal under very intense light particularly with side/intracanopy lighting."
SpaceBuckets,385lim,SuperAngryGuy,2,Tue Jun 2 05:12:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the solid answer as usual! I think I'll experiment a bit with it. I find foliar feeding interesting because there is little overwatering risk. We'll see...  I actually have a little bottle of that hormone stuff, I've used it but didn't notice much difference. I'm not even sure what is in it, it was expensive as shit but I got curious. Auxins? I'm not sure if plant hormones work like that at all.  Cheers SAG!!"

No changes, although she has recently really upped her intake and I realized today that she was totally dry when I thought she should have another day before she needed watering.  I am also feeding her a minimum diet of Adv. Nutrients Connoisseur, without any of its partners like voodoo, big bud, etc.  (Long story.)   I was planning on adding some kelp next week, but I think I will move that forward.   My idea is to move from artificial nuts to organic nuts as the grow progresses.

SpaceBuckets,385vl6,savonlechat,2,Tue Jun 2 03:21:25 2015 UTC,Looks like it needs a little more light maybe. You should probably bury a lot of that stem when you transplant to a larger container.
SpaceBuckets,385vl6,EXACTLY25SCHMECKLES,2,Tue Jun 2 04:01:55 2015 UTC,"These are some of the lessons I've learned:   Plenty of light and ventilation, these are keys to get the plant grow fast and healthy. Don't over water, wait at least  for the soil surface to dry up. Don't give too much nutrient too quickly. Start once your plant is a bit more developed. No more than once a week. Patience and vigilance. Watch closely in case of things go south (e.g. pests, overwatering, nutrient burn) but take least traumatic actions to the plant if you catch it early.   Good luck!"
SpaceBuckets,385vl6,Aserdu,2,Tue Jun 2 04:26:55 2015 UTC,I read that helping it stay up in early stages can lower solidity of the plant.
SpaceBuckets,385vl6,HubbleSpaceBucket,2,Tue Jun 2 09:44:21 2015 UTC,That's solid logic. Keeping it in a gentle breeze should have the effect of toughening up the stem.

SpaceBuckets,38304t,Ekrof,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:23:17 2015 UTC,How many buckets did you use for the left one? Did you have to progressively raise it as it grew? How tall is it?  Edit: the inverted pots are genius.
SpaceBuckets,38304t,AlaricV,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:29:01 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken that is 5 spacers on the left vs. 1 spacer on the right. Yes, you add the extra room when you need it, keeping the lighting as close as possible to the plant. I took that pic a while ago to show the height difference between a SCROG and just LST. I always aim for 1-3 spacers, 5 is a bit much for my liking (but still worked great, yielded 42g).  Cheers"

The important thing is the light-top, which is glass-shielded: http://imgur.com/a/24BdN#0 That made me forget about temp issues.  The wires come out of some heatsinks which are for 3x3w LED spotlights, but I'm not using those at the moment. I needed that spacer and had to recycle it from a previous grow.   Cheers, have fun"
SpaceBuckets,38304t,Ekrof,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:58:47 2015 UTC,So does the glass shield mean you need less fans? How did you get a circular piece of glass did you need to cut it yourself
SpaceBuckets,38304t,AlaricV,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:39:33 2015 UTC,"No, It does not mean you need less fans, it means they're more effective. You are creating two separate environments, one for the plant, and one for the lights. I bought the glass from a local shop (a glazier?), I gave them the specs and they cut it for me. It is a piece of 5mm glass with a 30cm diameter."
SpaceBuckets,38304t,Ekrof,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:52:22 2015 UTC,I used curved pvc pipe. I get the 5 or 6 in. can't remember right now cuz I'm not home but I just angle it down and it keeps light in a little better and fits pretty snug right over my fans.

What I'd like to do is throw a 20 gallon brute on top of the lid of my 32 gallon. Hang the 300w inside the 20 gallon and put a nice powerful fan at the very top.  Since heat rises and the 300w will be so high in the bucket, I don't think there should be any temp problems. I already have 5m of 5050 and 5m of 7020 in the 32 gallon, so I think I'll have mooore than enough light for some nice yields.  What do you guys think...any problems with this idea?"
SpaceBuckets,380g0g,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun May 31 22:58:33 2015 UTC,One problem I see is that the plant tends to get wider as it gets taller. You wouldn't want to have to pack the buds in closer to each other than they need to be. Why not get another 32 gallon?  Are you running out of vertical space?
SpaceBuckets,380g0g,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun May 31 23:03:16 2015 UTC,"No, I've got 12ft ceilings, so there's plenty of room. I feel like lifting a 32 gallon off to get to the plant would be a hassle.

SpaceBuckets,380g0g,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun May 31 23:06:44 2015 UTC,"I mean inside the brute, is the plant running out of space? Ideally you can train the plant with LST to avoid having to add more height.  It'll work. I'm just wondering why you need to do this."
SpaceBuckets,380g0g,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun May 31 23:09:23 2015 UTC,"I'm just wondering why you need to do this.   Haha. I just feel like why pay $90 for 180w, when I could get 300w for $115. My single brute set up right now is going swimmingly, but I'm always looking to improve. I'm assuming a 300w with a single brute would be too close and cause light stress, that's why I'd figure in the 20gal on top."

Happy to help anyone wishing to build such a system. I've made plenty of mistakes so that you don't have to.  Yields from a brute are 2 - 4 oz. Grow times 3 - 4 months.

And wow, thats a pretty nice yeild.  I feel like if its only a slight difference it would probably make more sense financially to build the single brute to begin with and then try to assemble another one in about 1 1/2-2 months.

SpaceBuckets,3802do,CivDis,2,Sun May 31 21:14:23 2015 UTC,"When I first began my bucket journey I went with an overkill exhaust and insulated ducting. It was a waste of money and space. The insulated ducting did nothing to reduce noise and the huge fan that I bought was extremely noisy even with a speed controller. I ended up buying regular aluminum ducting and a small inline fan, still a bit noisy but far better than before. More often than not I see people buying the wrong PC fans for their buckets too, you have too look at CFM and dBA rating. A high CFM fan with low dBA (level of noise) is what you are aiming for. Personally I like to keep my fans lower than 25 dBA, at this level I can comfortably go about my business with a faint whisper of the fans in the back ground. I designed and manufactured a fan adapter for my 5-gal space bucket so as far as rattling is concerned I have had no issues at all, although I did install some foam between the bucket and the adapter with the idea that it may prevent air and light leaks and it has proven to be efficient in both. The only issue I have had with noisy fans are those cheap crappy 40mm fans, they're extremely noisy for such a small fan."

SpaceBuckets,3802do,Bucketlink,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:44:41 2015 UTC,"Ah! I get it!  The reason why this question didn't produce a lot of answers here is because this is a problem that most people don't have!!!  The computer fans just are not loud enough to drive one crazy like the regular 4"" grow fan.  Hmm.  I have been straddling worlds, buying stuff that would work in a tent or in my brute bucket, but I'm going to have think about the ""real"" fan purchase. I have to say that I've been loving this whole experience.  Actually doing it, growing it has taught me so much.  I'm happy that I'm not generally busy right now, because it takes some time to figure out all these wonderful challenges."
SpaceBuckets,3802do,Bucketlink,2,Tue Jun 2 21:25:11 2015 UTC,I have this problem  I kind of saw it coming though and bought the quietest fan I could afford.   So far this is all I've really done about it. Foam bedding stuck to the back of the door the fan's in. Not really the kind of solution I think you're looking for.  What I am thinking of doing is building an exhaust muffler but haven't gotten around to it. The noise of the fan is barely audible at night. That's not to say that I haven't been listening to it at 2am rethinking my reluctance to build one.  I've also thought about getting a speed controller but my fan has two settings and is at the lowest. Because I rely on the airflow to cool the heatsinks for some 100W COBs I dont think I can afford to sacrifice any more airflow. Atleast not until its running at full bin capacity and I can assess it from there.

SpaceBuckets,37znss,bucketsandbeyond,3,Tue Jun 2 03:47:07 2015 UTC,"I guess you can't really not do an lst wrong, unless you snap it. I train all throughout the life cycle,  maybe stop early flower and start other methods. Sometimes I bend only one,  if they seem ""bendable"". I bent one a little too much recently and it snapped but then I bent one and it ended up mainlining itself but a little stronger, as if it was pinched, weird."
SpaceBuckets,37znss,Bucketlink,5,Sun May 31 20:49:09 2015 UTC,This is my first legit grow and I'm just trying to learn as much as I can. There are so many variables at work with training. I plan to experiment with a few different methods and just have fun with it.
SpaceBuckets,37znss,Bucketlink,3,Sun May 31 21:17:12 2015 UTC,You sure are. Is it an auto? If not when are you planning on topping? It looks like you have a big grow space.
SpaceBuckets,37znss,HubbleSpaceBucket,3,Sun May 31 20:07:34 2015 UTC,"It's bagseed from some really killer blue dragon, so I assume it's not an auto. I'm planning on topping in about 5 days, but I'm open to suggestions. It's in two clamshelled 18 gallon totes so I need to keep it short, but it has room to get very bushy. I have 250 watts of cfl's and a 5 meter 7020 warm led strip for lighting. I'm a little worried about light burn or possibly nitrogen deficiency."
SpaceBuckets,37znss,SuperAngryGuy,3,Sun May 31 20:20:55 2015 UTC,"You're probably right to top it in the next week. I wouldn't worry about light burn yet, they have to be touching for CFLs to burn.  She's not looking 100% though. Are you feeding her? What kind of soil is she in? Have you been monitoring PH? If so then how?"
SpaceBuckets,37znss,Bucket-head,2,Sun May 31 20:26:56 2015 UTC,"The soil is a mix of peat, perlite, MG moisture control, and organic compost. Next time I will use FFOF, but for this first round I really tapped by budget so I skimped a little on the soil. It sprouted on the 19th and I gave it some half strength dynagro foliage pro ph'ed to 6.8 on the 26th. Runoff ph was 5.8, so I plan to up the ph to 7.2 for the next watering. She's producing a lot of leaves, but doesn't seem to be drinking much. The soil is still quite moist. I'm using hydrion 5.5-8 test paper. The low ph runoff worries me somewhat, but hopefully will be corrected with the next watering."
SpaceBuckets,37znss,SuperAngryGuy,3,Sun May 31 20:47:21 2015 UTC,I seem to recall a comment by SAG that stated peat is rather acidic. I'm willing to be that's the source of your low pH.
SpaceBuckets,37znss,HubbleSpaceBucket,2,Mon Jun 1 04:11:41 2015 UTC,"That would explain it. My soil is definitely the weakest link at this point. Wish I would have tested the runoff before transplanting, but as you know it's a learning process. Do you think raising water ph to 7.2 will be sufficient?"
SpaceBuckets,37znss,savonlechat,4,Mon Jun 1 04:40:50 2015 UTC,Shoot for a pH of 7.0 first. If this doesn't correct your problem then take the water to pH 7.2.   I always use plain MG moisture control for just about everything. I also use hydroponic fertilizers with the soil (my hydro solution will turn cloudy at about a pH of 7.2 from certain salts binding up).  There's no reason to add peat to MG moisture control soil. One of its selling points is that it can hold a lot of water without using any peat. Peat will acidify your soil.

SpaceBuckets,37z240,Ekrof,2,Sun May 31 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"A lid complicates everything!  Without a lid I have no heat problems at all.  The bucket runs about two to three degrees above ambient temp.  I also get to lovingly gaze at my plants about 100 times a day without actually messing with them.  I have no need to go stealth and with an Autoflower I don't need to worry about light fidelity.  After the Autoflower finishes and I start to flower the photo period, then I will need to crack down and close it off."
SpaceBuckets,37z240,savonlechat,2,Sun May 31 17:44:56 2015 UTC,"I get what you mean. But keep in mind that a reflective lid would optimize your lighting quite a bit, you're letting a lot of photons out of that bucket. If you put a powerful fan for extraction then the lid should not raise your temps (it could even lower them).  Have fun, I think that plant will make you happy :)"

While trying to LST after topping, I ripped off one node branch from the main stem. You can see some necrotic patches in the image also. I think it may have come with a nitrogen toxicity that I for some reason initially misdiagnosed as cal/mag issues. I put her through a little over a month of veg and have been using tap water with fish emulsion (4-1-1) and cal-n-mag liquid fertilizer. She's in a soil combination of FFOF, perlite, blood & bone meal, and dolomite. She seems to have leveled out and I'm thinking about making a scrog net soon."

SpaceBuckets,37t3tr,JdH-AU,2,Sat May 30 12:13:52 2015 UTC,It's similar to this but I've never seen it done with cannabis. The Topsy Turvy is actually pretty popular in the US.  Check out these images and you can see that you can grow both out the bottom and the top of the container.
SpaceBuckets,37t3tr,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sat May 30 14:13:29 2015 UTC,I wonder. If you were to put this in a tent and have the light source below. Would it grow upside down?
SpaceBuckets,37t3tr,Bucketlink,2,Sun May 31 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking in most cases I've tried at least, gravitropism (the response of a plant to grow upwards) has a stronger affect on a plant than phototropism (the response to grow towards light) even with strong blue under lighting (which almost always has the strongest phototropic affect).  I tried one experiment with tomato (Super Sweet 100) forced to grow sideways and with strong green light above and strong blue light underneath I was able to force the plants to grow downwards. This was pretty extreme.  There are tricks with sweet corn you can do by putting a plastic tube around the base of the plant because only a small part of corn is subject to gravitropism and it's right at the base of the plant so you can even get corn to grow sideways just fine.  Pole bean (Kentucky Wonder) tendrils have no phototropic response but do have a gravitropic response so it really depends on the plant.  I've never grown cannabis upside down."
SpaceBuckets,37t3tr,SuperAngryGuy,2,Sun May 31 06:00:30 2015 UTC,"I was curious to know how a plant would do with an upside down bucket,  plant upside down on the top and lights on the bottom. I have an extra bucket but my only restraint on the whole thing would be the water runoff,  dripping on the lights. A plexiglass pane would work but there has to be an easier way.   I was trying to get the outdoor one to grow a bit more straight down. First,  I used a bendy copper wire and straightened it out that way. It was working until the wire couldn't support it,  I said fuck it and pulled the wire out. Might add some bamboo stakes to the side of the bucket and lst it that way."
SpaceBuckets,37t3tr,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:00:22 2015 UTC,Use GFCI protection if you try this!  Plexiglass sounds like a good idea.  A bamboo stake is what I'd use outdoors. It would be very interesting to see how this turns out.

Edit: should probably clarify that I live in a weed friendly state and purchased a really nice clone from a dispensary.   Edit 2: I'd also recommend considering a grow tent if stealth isn't a big issue. As I started growing and realized that none of my apartment neighbors cared I was growing it, it no longer made sense to try to work with such a limited space (think watering, SCROG manipulation, light distribution, etc.). It became easier and more economical to go to a larger space."

I'd certainly call it dark grey.  I sat on the floor with my head in the bucket and attached strips individually vertically, overlapping at the bottom to take in account for the taper.  In retrospect, aluminum tape would have been better, but I was stubborn and was sure duct tape was going to work.  EDIT: I don't yet have my LED strips installed either.  My seed just sprouted so I have a little time, but it's quickly running out.

Mylar, aluminum foil, water bladders, chrome vinyl and aluminum tape.  I think aluminum tape is the best because of its durability and ease of application. Its tough stuff and if you're going to be drilling holes in your bin for feed lines, hooks for LST, air vents etc it'll handle it well. A 50m x 75mm roll costs $30 - $40 but its enough to do several bins.  This is the stuff. I get it from the local hydro store"

Academic study of cannabis showing that the mid-upper 80's-low 90 degrees F is ideal for C. sativa (pdf file) for air temperature at the lighting levels we use. It's the roots that are best kept below 80 and due to evaporation cooling in the soil tends to be around 8 degrees F cooler than ambient air temperatures (even better with a small fan lightly blowing on the soil at high air temperatures).    OP, you're fine.  edit added a word and except for C. ruderalis, which is where the auto strains get there auto genetics from, all cannabis plants do a little better at higher temperatures than many plants since they originated in warmer climates."

Never toss a girl mate unless you absolutely have to!  Also, cutting off the bottom leaves isn't a bad idea and find something to ""tie"" the two arm to the stock. I just did his with a clone and where I mainlined it  was the only even node so now it's kinda pointless every other node is uneven so I'm gonna have to figure something out!"
SpaceBuckets,37kl62,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Thu May 28 16:00:22 2015 UTC,Apparently mainlining clones is pretty hard since the nodes get more uneven as the plant ages.
SpaceBuckets,37kl62,GrandmaFuxAlot,1 point,Thu May 28 16:58:40 2015 UTC,Yeah just so happened 3rd node from bottom was the only even node on the plant so that part worked well but he rest is all perfectly uneven!

Here is an album of a recent project I did cleaning up some horribly underpurged bho that was dumped on me.    And some bubble I made using some popcorn and shake.    I also made some infused gummies! Here is the recipe I used:     6g bho and 2 tablespoons of coconut oil placed in Pyrex dish and then put in oven at 250 for about 15 minutes to decarb.   1 packet of jello and 4 packets unflavored gelatin put into bowl. Add 1 cup boiling water and stir until mixed. Immediately pour the oil mix into the bowl and stir. Add 3 teaspoons of vegetable glycerin to homogenize.   Stir until mixed and no longer separating. Add 1/2 cup ice cold water and 1/2 cup apple juice (any fruit juice should work).   Once it thickens up put in fridge to set. Give it time, then.... gummies!   After the gummies set and stabilize, cut into cubes or whatever and coat with powdered citric acid. This will help them not stick together and preserve a bit longer. Plus it's delicious.

The album was re-released in expanded form in 2006.  Receiving strong reviews upon its release, My Life is now regarded as a high point in the discographies of Eno and Byrne.  In a 1985 interview, singer Kate Bush remarked that the album ""left a very big mark on popular music,""  while critic John Bush describes it as a ""pioneering work for countless styles connected to electronics, ambience, and Third World music.""  The extensive use of sampling on My Life is widely considered ground-breaking—it was one of the first albums to do so—but its actual influence on the sample-based music genres that later emerged continues to be debated.    Pitchfork Media listed My Life in the Bush of Ghosts as the 21st best album of the 1980s. Slant Magazine listed the album at No. 83 on its list of the ""Best Albums of 1980s"".

SpaceBuckets,37hl1y,ohelysium,2,Wed May 27 23:00:25 2015 UTC,OK so I've been lurking awhile and I'm thinking I may be hoping on building one of these. I almost posted the other day and realised a new weekly was about to start. I have some questions still and didn't feel right making a whole thread about it. I have never grown before. Ever. I've read some but not for sure how to translate it into a small environment. My plan is to get a total of 8 buckets. And start with 2 double stacks and use the extras for parts.  They will be white so I won't be doing any linings. I will have a ufo of some sort. Hopefully cheapish but good quality. Here is where I have questions. What would be a good ufo suggestion? How many fans will I know is an appropriate amount to keep them cool. What results have people gotten. I've seen alot of progress stuff but maybe I've missed the results.  Hopefully I don't seem crazy here.  I'm also curious how difficult it was for some people to wire? Anyone run into any specific problems? I do know I intend to hook all the fans to pipes and make a single carbon filter exhaust. I'm also thinking of using a tub and hooking it up to the same system for drying.
SpaceBuckets,37hl1y,ohelysium,1 point,Thu May 28 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"Ok,  I'm not sure which UFOs are best as I don't have one but I understand 135W is best for standard buckets and 180W are suitable for larger containers.  UFOs have their own cooling fans built in however they direct airflow in the wrong direction for spacebuckets. Instead of drawing air in through the top and out the sides/front you need to reverse those fans to do the opposite. I think it's just a case of opening the UFO and flipping the fans over. Depending on your climate this may be all the ventilation required.  Buy a digital thermometer and use it to test the temperatures inside your bucket before you grow. So long as it stays below 28°C it'll be fine.   UFO yields are above average, typically >1oz.  The wiring couldn't be simpler, they are plug and play."
SpaceBuckets,37hl1y,AlaricV,1 point,Fri May 29 03:32:28 2015 UTC,Awesome thank you so much. Do you mean yields greater than an oz or less than sorry I forget which <> is which. I'm in zone 7 I believe and we also keep the house relatively cool is there a temperature it shouldn't be under?  What light times do you use? I've heard some plants respond to different cycles differently but I'm just curious.
SpaceBuckets,37hl1y,JdH-AU,1 point,Fri May 29 03:48:59 2015 UTC,Great than 1oz.  See here for general advice. That site will have a lot of the answers you are looking for.  I use 20 on 4 off for the vegetative stage and 12 on 12 off for the flowering stage.
SpaceBuckets,37hl1y,Bucketlink,1 point,Fri May 29 03:59:29 2015 UTC,"Has anyone made the switch from cfl to hps? If so, how much of a difference did you see?"
SpaceBuckets,37hl1y,HubbleSpaceBucket,3,Thu May 28 02:06:38 2015 UTC,Not here. HPS produces too much heat to be safe in a bucket. That's why you see UFOs and COB lights getting popular.

SpaceBuckets,37ep37,Ekrof,1 point,Wed May 27 02:57:38 2015 UTC,To be honest that is best. However if you put a thin filter such as pantyhose over the exhausts it makes it lightproof enough to be kept in a dim area.

SpaceBuckets,37evbh,Bucketlink,1 point,Wed May 27 03:36:40 2015 UTC,I'm finding it hard to understand the design. Can you show it more clearly?
SpaceBuckets,37evbh,Bucketlink,1 point,Wed May 27 06:19:34 2015 UTC,So think of the whole thing like your bucket. The screen is the bottom and drainage. there will be a catch under it also. I'll put a small layer of rocks then the soil on top filling the entire bottom. I'm going to make the roof reflective as it is black. It has 2 intake fans with my Scythe filter installed into the top. It has 3 cubic feet of growing space so I could plant 3 autos but only choosing 2 for the first cycle. It's like im getting down voted for having a transparent box. Don't you want to see your buds? Because I sure do.
SpaceBuckets,37evbh,Ekrof,1 point,Wed May 27 16:11:47 2015 UTC,How are you going to grow three? I only see room for one. I hope the bottom is water tight.
SpaceBuckets,37evbh,Ekrof,1 point,Wed May 27 22:19:20 2015 UTC,"A 5gal bucket is 1 square foot. This is 3 square feet. My plant I have right now is easily giving 40g and is around 3 feet tall, and it's in a bucket. Autos tend to be more compact so I have no worries of space. The bottom is a screen, it's not supposed to be water tight. Just going to have to see it later I guess."
SpaceBuckets,37evbh,Ekrof,1 point,Wed May 27 23:21:17 2015 UTC,So you're going to fill the bottom of this thing with your soil and plant three autos in it? Keep in mind that a plant will use whatever space is available for its roots. Those three will fight.  That box is 3' x 3'? It's hard to get a sense of scale.
SpaceBuckets,37evbh,Bucketlink,1 point,Wed May 27 23:35:20 2015 UTC,I know it's hard to see space and size over over standard pics. I'll take some wide range pics and video it later today after I get these lights installed working as I type.  But yes the whole bottom is going to be filled. And I will have a spacer between them.

SpaceBuckets,37dmzt,Hyroero,2,Wed May 27 13:16:43 2015 UTC,Looking good to me. I'm doing basically the same grow as you but my seedling got slightly burnt (preloaded the soil with some nutes but it must have but a little too much).  What's your plan with nutes etc? I've done a fair few successful soil grows but coco is a whole new game for me.
SpaceBuckets,37dmzt,Hyroero,2,Wed May 27 03:55:22 2015 UTC,"I usually don't feed anything besides ph'd water for 7 to 10 days and use the canna line of products with a little bit of floralicious plus, usually start off at about 1/10 strength and slowly move up from there. I've never done this strain before so I traded a NL auto seed to my buddy for it since I have about 20 of them and wanted to try something new.   I've never had real success growing in soil, I tried a few times years ago and always experienced way too many problems and the plants never amounted to anything. Since switching to coco I feel like a grow master since all my soil friends are always so impressed with my plants. Good luck with your grow my friend."
SpaceBuckets,37dmzt,JdH-AU,2,Wed May 27 13:14:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight. I've had basically the opposite experience with that soil grows have always been very easy but my last few attempts with coco failed haha.  I think the key for me is getting used to the different watering schedule and when and how much nutes to use with coco since with soil you basically don't need to add any thing for a big chunk of veg.
SpaceBuckets,37f6hp,_Username_Optional_,5,Wed May 27 04:29:29 2015 UTC,Sure but you'll need five of them to provide the minimum light necessary for a standard spacebucket.  You won't fit five of these on a spacebucket and a UFO costs less.

SpaceBuckets,37b3ta,HubbleSpaceBucket,3,Tue May 26 11:18:09 2015 UTC,"I would advise caution with the liberty haze. I have it running in a bucket right now and I'm about a week to 2 weeks from harvest. She is frosty, she has big fist sized buds on top... she's very very tall. 2 weeks after flipping to flower she stretched up past the end of my bucket. It's actually kind of silly how much she stretched.  I did some research (because I bought the Liberty Haze and still have 4 more seeds) and found out that that is the biggest complaint from the strain. Yes it's stupidly strong. Yes it grows some really dense fat flowers on top. But the average stretch is around 4-700%. Some of my flower spacing is over 7"".  Despite all of this, I do have another one germinating but I wish that I had been prepared for the stupid amount of stretch. I would definitely have vegged it differently.  One last bit of info... germination can be really long on these seeds. It usually takes a week or more.  Happy bucketing!"
SpaceBuckets,37b3ta,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Tue May 26 14:02:37 2015 UTC,That's really great to know. Invaluable info and so relevant to bucket grows. So from the sounds of things she's going to more than triple in height during stretch. That'll be a challenge.
SpaceBuckets,37b3ta,Mr_Markheim,2,Tue May 26 14:04:59 2015 UTC,This might be a good opportunity to apply /u/superangryguy 's information on blue light and stretch.  I believe his recommendation is to balance the light towards blue the first two weeks of flower to suppress  the early stretch.
SpaceBuckets,37b3ta,Northernlighter,1 point,Tue May 26 15:35:39 2015 UTC,"An excellent opportunity. I'm looking for this info now. Do you have a link?  Edit: This is all I've got so far    LOW LIGHT Auxin levels are also high at low light levels which is why plants stretch in lower light levels as per the acid growth hypothesis. Remember, there's a difference between growth as it applies to cellular elongation and growth as it applies to yield by the accumulation of sugar through photosynthesis. You can use red light to prevent stretching but blue light, particularly in the 450-470nm ballpark, has a much greater efficiency at reducing stem elongation. If you want to keep your plant alive on vacation, for example, use low levels of pure blue light [5] to keep water uptake low and streching at a minimum. Pure 450nm blue light sources can be bought at Home Depot which can be used or modified to use various reflectors [6] .   /u/SuperAngryGuy would this mean that flowering process would also be slowed down?  Edit2: This is more like it"
SpaceBuckets,37b3ta,Northernlighter,3,Tue May 26 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"Typically, yes. Blue light suppresses auxins and auxins are vital in the biosynthesis of another plant hormone called ethylene which plays a major role in the ripening process. Auxins also play a dominate role in acid growth.  The above is why metal halides aren't used in flowering (except for perhaps the first week or two) because with the higher color temperature for the ""classic"" metal halide (4200K) you get a lot more blue than HPS which is 2100K."
SpaceBuckets,37b3ta,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Tue May 26 16:11:16 2015 UTC,I see. So I can gather then that using a 6500K COB grow light for the first two weeks after flipping would be advantageous if I have a stretchy strain to contain?
SpaceBuckets,37b3ta,Northernlighter,1 point,Tue May 26 16:33:54 2015 UTC,Oh yeah! I had to engineer a bucket to go on top of my bucket just to contain her. I would love to see one grown outside.

SpaceBuckets,37c0s0,Lleaff,1 point,Tue May 26 15:13:50 2015 UTC,"Looking good. Pretty keen to mainline my next plant, just not sure what strain I will run yet =S"
SpaceBuckets,37c0s0,Bucketlink,2,Wed May 27 13:18:42 2015 UTC,"Critical Kush is a good candidate for mainlining, my CK handled everything I threw at it.  That's an interesting observation re: the odd spectrum bulb."
SpaceBuckets,37c0s0,maydrew,1 point,Tue May 26 16:47:25 2015 UTC,"Yes she definitely takes well to everything from topping to lst to nutes. No deficiencies, toxicities, burns, you name it.    I always try to have 1/4 of the cfls in the bucket be from the opposing scheduled spectrum. 3 veg / 1 flower during vegetation then 3 flower / 1 veg during flower. I'm not sure how much effect it has since I haven't done a true AB test yet, but in this specific case where symmetry is key, it definitely made a difference.    Once it evens back out fully, I might just remove it and go with all 4 veg bulbs to prevent further imbalance."
SpaceBuckets,37c0s0,OrganicTrails,1 point,Tue May 26 16:55:26 2015 UTC,"Could you elaborate more on what node you first topped? And also when you topped the second/thrid time? I'm going to be starting a Nirvana Northern Lights grow in these next few days and really want to try mainlining.   Also, how many mains do you plan on having?"
SpaceBuckets,37c0s0,OrganicTrails,2,Tue May 26 22:57:52 2015 UTC,"I pretty much followed nugbuckets guide to start. I waited until the plant had 5-6 nodes so the roots built out strong then topped down to the first true node and removed all growth below it. Once those two new mains had 3-4 nodes I topped each again. Once those 4 new mains hit 3 nodes I topped 2 of them. This way ill have 6 mains total.    As they grow up now, once the four smaller mains reach minimum canopy height I'll flip to flower. During flower I'll wait until they hit the max canopy height then begin backbuilding them. Once all 6 are the same height all are backbuilding it's just a matter of keeping them lollipopped and fed."
SpaceBuckets,37c0s0,JdH-AU,2,Tue May 26 23:06:59 2015 UTC,"Bacon lookin good! is there a reason you top it down to the first true node and not  just the last top? For height? Or are these nodes stronger, more defined or something?   Editfast: because they're more developed, probably. I'm stoopids."
SpaceBuckets,37cjcg,Northern_Lights9,1 point,Tue May 26 17:01:48 2015 UTC,Maybe some heat stress? Some leaves are curling a bit. I'm growing 2 nl autos myself right now

SpaceBuckets,37dfns,giaamyofdeath,2,Tue May 26 20:37:52 2015 UTC,Hello and welcome!  In my opinion they looks overwatered and hungry for Nitrogen.
SpaceBuckets,37dfns,Ekrof,1 point,Tue May 26 20:39:06 2015 UTC,Thanks! I water every 2-3 days (last time yesterday) and grow in tomato soil. Nitrogen is a good idea! Should I wait for the pH to normalize before I feed them a small dose of nutrients?
SpaceBuckets,37dfns,Ekrof,2,Tue May 26 20:44:00 2015 UTC,"Ehhh... I'm not sure. I think I would give the plants a few drops of N now and then work on the pH. But I might be wrong, I'm not really a pH expert (my country has very good soil and I never have those woes)."
SpaceBuckets,37dfns,JdH-AU,1 point,Tue May 26 20:57:52 2015 UTC,"High pH does cause nutrient lockouts, but I think in your case the plant is so overwatered that the roots are suffocated and can't transport nutrients. How much perlite did you mix into your soil? Poor drainage can cause water retention at the roots, effectively drowning your plant. Your soil doesn't look like it would drain very well.  Let your soil dry out for a day or two longer and see how your plant responds."
SpaceBuckets,37bqzh,autogenetica,1 point,Tue May 26 13:34:29 2015 UTC,Looks like nute burn to me. What's the grow medium?
SpaceBuckets,37bqzh,Bucketlink,1 point,Tue May 26 13:46:34 2015 UTC,Just cheap soil. Locally that's all I could get and I needed to keep costs down. It is meant to be good for seedlings however. But nutrient burn is probably likely. Time to flush it?
SpaceBuckets,37bqzh,Bucketlink,1 point,Tue May 26 14:08:16 2015 UTC,Are you feeding it anything?
SpaceBuckets,37bqzh,sb_the,1 point,Tue May 26 15:39:51 2015 UTC,"This is def mineral burn. After germing a seed, I personally recommend going to a solo cup sized container to establish the plant before putting it in the larger ""final container.""   From where you are now, here is the recommended order of op: 1. Wait 5 days before doing ANYTHING.  -No water, no touching, NO ANYTHING! -This will give her time to establish hardy roots 2. WAIT ANOTHER DAY 3. Water. You know what a flush is? Yep. 4. Watch her take off. Its gonna boom man (or madam). Every day poke the soil with your forefinger up to your first knuckle. BUT DON""T WATER! 5. After 6 days (12 days from today), you'll poke it to the first knuckle and the soil will feel dry. WATER IT! -This also the point where the plant is likely hardy enough to trim off the ""burned"" portion. Cut at an angle and get as little of the green part of the leaf as possible.  Remember, overwatering will kill a plant faster than underwatering and you can't ""unwater"" a plant.   =)"

I think rather than stealth you should be thinking camouflage.  Take up growing orchids or special ferns or tomatoes, then it doesn't really matter if they see or smell something weird.

Once the seed germinates and I see a taproot, I put the seedling in a moist Jiffy Pellet until I see roots appear coming out of the pellet -- usually in a few days to a week or so.  Then I transplant into a small nursery pot.  Haven't don't it any other way."

Once roots came out of the pellet, I buried the pellet into coco. Worked very well. Just remember to never let them completely dry out though, as they get hard as a rock and your seedling will be pretty much toast if this happens."

I posted this over on /r/Autoflowers to get more input. A couple of those kind folks believe it to either be nute burn or a little bit of root rot. I am allowing 3 to 4 days between each watering, so I have a feeling its a bit of nutrient burn.   What do you think?"
SpaceBuckets,375q83,Bucketlink,1 point,Mon May 25 11:49:59 2015 UTC,Gotcha. I see it.  Is it spreading up the leaf?

SpaceBuckets,375eo1,BudBucketAndBeyond,2,Mon May 25 01:01:54 2015 UTC,When should I start with the LST?
SpaceBuckets,375eo1,BGWillis,2,Mon May 25 01:03:21 2015 UTC,"I've never grown in a bucket but in my personal experience you can start to LST your plant once there's a distinct Y-shape forming. Your plant looks just about there. Once you do put your LST in place, make sure it's with a material that won't harm the plant, and also don't stretch the plant. Just allow it to grow in a preferred direction.  Best of luck!  P.S. I love the name of that strain so much ❤❤❤❤❤"
SpaceBuckets,375eo1,JdH-AU,2,Mon May 25 01:37:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I was planning on using coated paper clips at first then switching to bent coat hangers. Would this suffice?
SpaceBuckets,37417d,Ekrof,5,Sun May 24 17:57:26 2015 UTC,Tight! Some strategic defoliation might be useful.
SpaceBuckets,37417d,Lleaff,2,Sun May 24 19:49:51 2015 UTC,I agree. Time to give her a haircut
SpaceBuckets,37417d,Dr_Marmalade,2,Sun May 24 22:13:04 2015 UTC,"New girl here, what should be done if you didn't have the option to move to a tent? And aren't there strains that ""won't"" grow that tall?"
SpaceBuckets,37417d,JdH-AU,2,Sun May 24 19:58:59 2015 UTC,There are autoflowers that don't grow that tall such as low rider from nirvana shop. If it is a regular plant you can use LST (low stress training) to tie the plant down and cause it to grow shorter. You can also start the flower period much earlier than we did so that the end height is more manageable for a bucket.   We did neither mainly because this was our first plant and we made some mistakes. Just a couple weeks ago the plant was very sad however it made a hell of a comeback and we hope it flourishes in a tent with some more room.   Good luck!

SpaceBuckets,373sw3,Luniaril,3,Sun May 24 16:46:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can use those. The only disadvantage is that they probably won't be stackable, so you will have a fixed height for your setup. That means a lot of training (that is normal), and that you need some way to raise and lower the lighting inside the bucket. You could also raise the plant, the idea is to keep the source as close as possible to the leaves.  Cheers, welcome and good luck!"
SpaceBuckets,373sw3,Ekrof,2,Sun May 24 17:16:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm thanks, what's the average height plants can reach if space is not an issue ? Now i'm wondering if i'd have to keep the plant a lot shorter than it's potential with this bucket, resulting in smaller harvest for no good reason."
SpaceBuckets,373sw3,Ekrof,2,Sun May 24 18:35:34 2015 UTC,"The average height is very variable, there are a lot of factors in play. Mostly the strain (Sativas are much taller), your training technique, and also the amount of vegging time."
SpaceBuckets,373sw3,Bradguydude,1 point,Sun May 24 19:13:08 2015 UTC,"The plant will grow as tall as you want it to, as long as you keep it in its veg state. Just remember to leave some room for flowering, because it'll explode once you switch!   Just like Ekrof said, the only disadvantage I can see would be the fixed height. I'd say go for it!"
SpaceBuckets,373sw3,Bradguydude,1 point,Mon May 25 00:36:51 2015 UTC,"If we can keep it in veg as long as we want, then how do we decide when to keep it in veg state or let it flower ? depending on the space we have or thinking the harvest we get will be enough. Or is there anything else to consider ?"
SpaceBuckets,373sw3,wollkopf,1 point,Mon May 25 05:50:23 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much it. Unless you're wanting to make clones from it (Making it a mother plant) or wanting to let it grow to a specific height, then there's no real reason to keep it in veg for a long time."
SpaceBuckets,370nvw,grimnirreaps,3,Sat May 23 19:38:12 2015 UTC,"Connecting red to +12V and black to ground should make the fan run at 100%. You don't need to mess with yellow and blue. Yellow is a tachometer, and I believe blue is a PWM input."
SpaceBuckets,370nvw,Hasz,2,Sat May 23 21:12:54 2015 UTC,"If it's an N-channel FET (the transistor is controlled through a positive gate voltage), you can typically just pull of up the gate voltage of the FET through a resistor to the positive supply voltage. A 10K resistor may work since it's voltage controlled and not current controlled. I always check the wires with an oscilloscope to see what's going on before hacking/modding something, though.  If you don't understand the above then I wouldn't go tinkering with a FET- they can be very static sensitive (with FETs I almost always have a 1Mohm resistor on the gate to ground because of the static issue).  Can you show some more photos including the power supply and controller? It may be as easy as bypassing the FET control and direct hard wire the fan to 12 volts. Bypass would be my first choice."
SpaceBuckets,370nvw,SuperAngryGuy,2,Sat May 23 21:14:37 2015 UTC,Just hook up your red & black and it'll run at full speed. Also your soldering looks to have improved a lot from your first attempt. Bravo.
SpaceBuckets,370nvw,Bucketlink,1 point,Sun May 24 01:39:17 2015 UTC,Thanks! And because of the blue fet it won't let the power engage.it's like a wired temp gauge I tried that first. Simplest way around it is melox splitters to a 12v wall adapter. Everything else is a pain. Id spend just as much if I went the hard route also.
SpaceBuckets,370nvw,Bucketlink,2,Sun May 24 01:55:37 2015 UTC,molex adaptors and a 12v transformer should be all you need to get these working
SpaceBuckets,370nvw,slightly-medicated,1 point,Sun May 24 05:14:09 2015 UTC,So I've gone ahead and ordered melox splitters and converters and power supply to solve the issues without hard wire the FET. Like you said /u/superangryguy it's a bitch. Lol

SpaceBuckets,36ykdw,ledqu,1 point,Sat May 23 16:32:39 2015 UTC,"LST is just one of several styles of training.  You really don't want to just let a spacebucket plant grow wild and free, because it will grow taller than is convenient.  A plant like cannabis will initially grow like a cone.  Unless you want to build a bucket that provides most of its light from the sides, it's best to train the plant to have a flatter top.  Along with LST, there's supercropping, a form of high stress training, and SCROG, the screen of green."

After the cost of materials your labor charge is going to kill the affordability. If they use cheap crap materials to alleviate this then chargebacks will end up screwing them over in the long run.    Just as this sub and community self regulates, the very nature of how spacebuckets are made and those for whom it is the best option keep it a DIY project. It's not yet a commercially viable kit to sell in my opinion."
SpaceBuckets,36rpe8,bacon_flavored,2,Thu May 21 19:29:18 2015 UTC,"Yea I mean in my opinion the only real value this would bring is the ""all in one"" set it and forget it kind of thing. So that I don't have to do the two weeks of research, I just get it all there and follow the instructions.   The thing is with the spacebuckets, the reason you have to do so much research is because everyone has a different opinion and there are many ways to customize and approach it. So by that very nature, trying to sell an all in one kit means you have to take this guy's opinions and design without question. And as we see around here, that's not the case. Everyone has different things that suit them based on what their goals are and what they're trying to do.   For example this kit would never work for me because I live in an apartment and need serious deodorization. So much so I bought a 4"" inline filter with carbon filter just to ensure no smell at all.   Anyways, I think he'll quickly learn. Looks like his video was made off of a powerpoint presentation.

We'd love to start talking with you about how we can do this responsibly.  Also, we'd love to give some of our buckets away to the community here so that you guys can see that our buckets are actually pretty cool!! Obviously nothing can compete with the complete freedom of making one yourself however.  As for a more streamlined product with more features? We've got ideas for that too!

SpaceBuckets,36s0xb,terxmonster81,3,Thu May 21 23:41:38 2015 UTC,"Not only more buds, also better quality buds. With LST you optimize your vertical space, so you can put your lights very close, and that means extra trichome production."
SpaceBuckets,36rqmh,rainuspainus,3,Thu May 21 16:28:19 2015 UTC,"From my (limited) experience autos are very cool. You don't need to mess with the light, I set mine to 20/4 and let it be for most of its life. You only train with LST because autos don't have time to recover from other methods of training before harvest.  I got 52g from my auto blue mystic using a LED ufo in a bucket.  But! As far as the learning experience goes, photo growing is very important. I grew bag seed and got to experiment with supercroping though I could have experimented more. The feeling of switching to flowering and watching how the pistols, and then colas developed was pretty cool too.  Both are good in their own ways. But autos are quickly rewarding. Good smoke too!"

SpaceBuckets,36rqmh,DabsAndMexicanFood,1 point,Thu May 21 21:53:16 2015 UTC,I'd suggest getting feminised seeds. Auto flowers are great if you have your methods perfected but feminised photoperiod plants give you a chance to recover from any problems during the veg phase.   Click
SpaceBuckets,36rqmh,Bucketlink,1 point,Thu May 21 23:45:21 2015 UTC,"Regular feminized seeds require two different lights (vegetative and flowering).  Also the flowering plants need to have long periods of darkness every day.  This is a challenge for closet growers who want to have a constant harvest.  You can't have small vegetative plants in the same room as flowering plants.  This is not an issue for space bucket growers.  The benefits of regular seeds is that they can be cloned and you decide when they switch to flowering mode.  This means you can grow large or smaller plants depending on your needs.  Autoflower seeds have a genetic modification that forces the plants to flower after a given length of time, regardless of light color or duration.  Unfortunately, you cannot clone autoflower plants.  The clones see themselves as 'the same age' as the mother plant and go to flower at the same time.  The benefit of autoflowering is that it makes it very easy for a closet grower to grow plants at various stages of development in the same space (one closet instead of two). It could also save you the cost of a having a second light bulb for a flowering stage, depending on your set-up."

SpaceBuckets,36rfcw,ProfGanjadore,1 point,Thu May 21 17:18:49 2015 UTC,"Why do you start so far in the schedule? I always start on week 0/1 of the schedule and not at full strength. Week 4 and 5 are like pre flower (I know week 4 uses open seasame, which you start when you flip to flower) and flower, and that's like a shit ton of nutes that it has never had. If you follow the schedule and the weeks, you gradually add more new nutes every time and don't go overkill. This is with ff happy frog soil.   If you're using ff schedule (there is a new one for 2015), stick to week 0, it's for seedlings and clones. Wait about two weeks before you start giving nutes and start at half strength.  I veg my stuff for longer than 4 weeks, so I do a variation of week 3."

The leaves folding downward could be a sign of too much nitrogen or low oxygen levels in the root zone typically caused by watering too much or having poor drainage. (Often leaves would claw with too much nitrogen but they can also fold downwards).  Another reason for leaves folding downwards is the plant being root bound. This does not happen in all cannabis strains. It does in Royal Kush (Hindu Kush x Skunk#1) but not Purple Trainwreck (Grand Daddy Purple x Trainwreck), for example.  The yellowing on top could be a sulfur deficiency.   Epson salts should take care of the top."
SpaceBuckets,36qd5x,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Thu May 21 18:40:19 2015 UTC,"I am in Australia and so the FF range isn't available. I am using a mixture of about 2/3 Debco Organic Mix (plainest, most natural soil I could find) and 1/3 perlite. I should note that these pictures were directly after a transplant from much smaller pots. when I transplanted the notes were quite apparent at the edges of the pot. As for too much nitrogen - I have been using my nutes once a week or so but I did give them an extra dose last week. I'll look into getting some epson salts. Thanks so much for your reply!"
SpaceBuckets,36qumo,steent,2,Thu May 21 11:58:07 2015 UTC,In future try to avoid re potting autos.   With autos in soil I personally wouldn't feed till I see flowers or get yellow leaves.  FWIW a photo is better in a small set up : being able to top and lst at your own pace means a better use of limited space IMO. Of course you can train autos but it's a race against time and it's harder to estimate your final height. Just my 2c  P.S blue mystic is a nice strain
SpaceBuckets,36qumo,my_arse,1 point,Thu May 21 14:38:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah i thought i ordered regulars, but it were autos. I started with a small pot because it is easier to put it close with the light. I'll be very soft with the repotting!"
SpaceBuckets,36qumo,JdH-AU,2,Thu May 21 14:59:39 2015 UTC,"I don't have experience with autos but the seedling seems a bit tall? If you decide to re pot (which seems inevitable), make sure to bury the stem a little bit."

SpaceBuckets,36ohra,grimnirreaps,2,Wed May 20 21:50:06 2015 UTC,What's the strain? Looks like you have the start of nute burn on the tips of your leaves. Maybe dial the nutes back by .1 EC.
SpaceBuckets,36ohra,Lleaff,1 point,Wed May 20 23:19:27 2015 UTC,Bag seed and the leaf tips are from a 3 weeks ago when I had a heat problem. Makes it look like crap in some pics sadly. But I will check for nute burn over this week.

SpaceBuckets,36msxj,malferionprime,1 point,Wed May 20 15:12:15 2015 UTC,"Also, what should I use to test the ph of my soil? A meter or strips?"
SpaceBuckets,36msxj,SuperAngryGuy,2,Wed May 20 15:28:12 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion but I've used digital meters and strips.  Why I use strips: there's no calibration, there's no special storage needs, I can get 150 or so tests out of a roll, the pH 5.5 - 8 version is accurate enough for any soil needs related to cannabis, you can measure a single drop or even damp soil which no consumer digital pH meter can do (ISFET digital pH meters are expensive) and I'm sure I could come up with a few more reasons.  This is what I use.  If you go with strips, only  get the above. A lot of hydro stores sell pH 1-14 strips and they are about useless."
SpaceBuckets,36msxj,Bucketlink,2,Wed May 20 18:59:59 2015 UTC,And don't bother with the drops. I got through a few grows with them but eventually their inaccuracy almost cost me a crop.
SpaceBuckets,36msxj,Whisper06,1 point,Thu May 21 00:12:36 2015 UTC,Fox Farms is a great beginning organic trio nute blend and you just need an electronic ph and ppm meter  EDIT: P.S. Also to bring soil ph back to 7 mix the soil with dolomite lime and if you want to fix water ph back that lime and mix it with the water.
SpaceBuckets,36msxj,Hyroero,1 point,Wed May 20 16:24:18 2015 UTC,I use dynagro foliage pro and bloom.  Foliage pro for veg and bloom for flower.  I also use an oakton ph pen because I've had bad luck with strips but a lot of others seem to get by just fine with them.

SpaceBuckets,36l8lt,I_am_jacks_reddit,1 point,Wed May 20 05:29:03 2015 UTC,Any type of pepper in particular? We talking bell peppers or chillies?
SpaceBuckets,36l8lt,VLXS,3,Wed May 20 06:41:03 2015 UTC,"Chillies are actually a good analogy, because you can measure not only the growth, but the potency as well. For example, you could probably grow some chillies in mostly-shade, but they wouldn't be very potent. If you can grow hot chillies that are actually hot, you could probably grow cannabis just as well."

I guess because Lowe's had been in my home town first. It was like an Ace or Tru Value then, not like now. Also, they keep their stores farther apart.  Also also, their lumber is soooo much better.  Additionally also, their buckets are dark blue, and I like blue better than orange.  :-D  But yeah.  I'll give Lowe's a second chance.  If they fail me, HD gets my bucket business.

I've got five of them wired up on my bucket top, and at 800 lumens per bulb, it seems pretty bright. I also picked up the ceramic sockets there for 2.19 each there and they feel very solid. I usually shop at Home Depot over Lowe's because of their politics.

SpaceBuckets,36ic48,Bucketlink,1 point,Tue May 19 17:27:05 2015 UTC,Will that really affect the humidity inside the buckets? Don't really want to build an enclosure for my bucket...
SpaceBuckets,36ic48,Bucketlink,2,Tue May 19 18:19:11 2015 UTC,"That's understandable. Unfortunately its the only suggestion I've got.  High humidity should only be a problem in the final weeks of flower, can you time the grow so that those weeks fall in a drier period?"
SpaceBuckets,36ic48,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Tue May 19 18:30:03 2015 UTC,No need to apologize. Thanks much for the suggestions. Still researching so probs could hold off to flower mid late fall.
SpaceBuckets,36ic48,JdH-AU,2,Tue May 19 19:50:20 2015 UTC,Put a dehumidifier in the attic. If you have an intake fan it is puling humid air in from the attic. The dehumidifier will reduce the relative humidity in the attic so the bucket pulls in less-humid air.
SpaceBuckets,36ic48,HubbleSpaceBucket,2,Tue May 19 18:24:37 2015 UTC,Trying to effectively dehumidify an entire attic is going to be rather energy intensive.  Trying to use an A/C unit means that you have to direct the hot air coming off the A/C unit outside of the attic otherwise you'll just be adding more heat.  What are your humidity levels at? I'm sure tiny space options are feasible.
SpaceBuckets,36ic48,savonlechat,2,Wed May 20 04:47:28 2015 UTC,"Hello /u/mydickandballs (sorry couldnt resist)  Don't you have a basement or storage closet with some spare room? A space bucket really doesn't take up much space. If not, then one thing you could try is enclosing it space bucket and using a few jars of those water absorbing crystals (the stuff that looks like kitty litter).  Where I live it gets pretty humid in summer so I've resigned to only using my space bucket in winter.  This by the way is why people smuggle weed into tropical countries. Their climate makes it very hard and expensive to grow thick, juicy buds. Even outside is often too humid for cannabis."
SpaceBuckets,36ic48,574X,1 point,Wed May 20 06:27:21 2015 UTC,"Do you know what temp your attic gets to in the summer?  I haven't measured mine, but I have no doubt that it gets well above 100*F in there.  What I'm saying is that if your attic gets humid in the summer, it sounds like it's not insulated and climate controlled.  If that's the case, chances are it's going to get way too hot to the point that the humidity will be irrelevant."

SpaceBuckets,36fbix,BucketCharlie,1 point,Mon May 18 23:06:42 2015 UTC,"My bucket build from 2 weeks ago can be seen here.  After the build I germinated a single seed (candy kush auto from Nirvana).  I was nervous because this is the first plant of any kind I've ever grown from seed or otherwise, but it's been really exciting to watch.  I'm using a 50/50 perlite/FFOF mix in my starter cup and will transplant to a 3-gal smart pot when she's ready.  Sprouted on 5/14 and this pic was taken today so approx 4 days growth is shown here.  She's looking strong, I've got her under my 180w LED running 24/0 for now but will switch to 20/4 for the rest of the grow soon.  Ph/RH/Temp are all stable within recommend ranges.  Since she sprouted on the same day BB King died I've decided to name her Lucille in his honor.  /r/spacebuckets is one of the best communities I've found on reddit.

SpaceBuckets,36fbix,Hyroero,2,Tue May 19 01:25:44 2015 UTC,"Love it man, very nice setup.  With autos you normally don't want to do any transplanting if possible or lst. Basically any thing that the plant will need recovery time for is far more brutal for a auto then a normal seed.  The main reason is that once it's germinated the plants timer is started, autos have a very limited time before they flower and then die so they need as few setbacks as possible.  I doubt it will ruin your grow or anything but maybe something to keep in mind?  I'm currently doing my first auto currently actually so this is just shit I've picked up here and other places online when figuring out the difference between autos and normal."

SpaceBuckets,36g220,savonlechat,3,Tue May 19 02:42:54 2015 UTC,"Yea it's fine. Controlling your heat is important and not worth risking a few extra lumens over.

I'll add or remove additional side lighting or in the case of my old cfl bucket I'd turn some individual lights off.  The 180w ufo is going to be more then enough power anyway, the side lighting will just promote covered areas to grow a little more and fill out those popcorn buds into slightly bigger buds you can make use of."

Below the compensation point the leaves act as a drag on the plant by consuming more sugars than generated because of cellular respiration, above it's adding sugars to the plant for greater overall growth.  Keep in mind that the optimal air temperature for cannabis is about is in the upper 80's- low 90's. pdf source"

SpaceBuckets,36f9oi,Spectrewiz,5,Mon May 18 22:53:34 2015 UTC,Flat white is simply the best way to go. I just did a bunch of research on this and painted the inside of my brute this past weekend

SpaceBuckets,36f9oi,LoamyGardens,1 point,Tue May 19 13:14:02 2015 UTC,"Yea, even if the paint says it's made for plastic and needs no sanding, just sand it a small bit so it doesn't scoff off easily.  I'm lookin at you Krylon Fusion for plastic!"

At the very least, I'd council curing it really well before putting plants in.  The fumes/gasses from the paint might not kill anything, but it seems to me that any plant spending several months in a freshly painted confined space (that's warm) is going to absorb some of those nasty paint compounds. Paint outside of the bucket, I'd be less concerned about."
SpaceBuckets,36coos,Hyroero,1 point,Mon May 18 09:29:17 2015 UTC,Back up seed in a jiffy pot to the side.  I pre loaded the coco with a small amount of nutes but left the jiffy pot plain for experimentation.  Main seed seems to be a bit pale yellow which I suspect is small amount of burn as it shouldn't need any real nutes yet. Watering with phd 5.8 water with a small amount of seasol.  90w China ufo and I'll add some side lighting when it gets a little bigger.

SpaceBuckets,36a9rp,Naturalz,1 point,Mon May 18 23:29:31 2015 UTC,"Tbh it still looks like it'll be OK as long as you dry and cure it properly but yeah next time, don't go by days passed just look at the trichomes. They should all be cloudy with a few amber ones (you will probably need a magnifying glass). Also, more of the pistils should turn orange. Other than that though, it looks like you did a good job on the grow :)"
SpaceBuckets,36a9rp,HubbleSpaceBucket,1 point,Tue May 19 08:30:32 2015 UTC,"Make sure you get them out of the jar and dry them properly if they're as fresh as they look.  From what I've read, you want to maintain about 60-70% (it varies by author) humidity when you cure.  Fresh product is going to evaporate and drive the humidity up in an enclosed space and then comes the mold.  You'll want a hygrometer in the jar to keep tabs on that."

Don't be afraid to ask if you think your plant is ready or better yet get a jewelers loupe or microscope (60x recommended).  You can use the loupe to check the trichomes for the exact time of harvest. They go from clear to cloudy to amber, with cloudy being full of thc."

I've been lurking here for a while and finally decided to share what I've been working on. I had an idea for something very similar to space buckets when I was in college, so I was stoked when I found this sub. CFLs and LEDs have made it all possible. I plan to do a more traditional bucket build in the near future. These things are addictive. Hope you guys enjoy."
SpaceBuckets,36a53i,Ekrof,3,Sun May 17 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"That looks great! I would try to put the LED closer.  That plant looks happy and very green, I'd love to see how it progress! Plant journals are rare and welcome :)  I've uploaded your profile to the website, it is the update of the day. Check it out here. I can remove or modify anything you wish.  Have fun, cheers!"
SpaceBuckets,36a53i,Narf-a-licious,2,Mon May 18 11:57:53 2015 UTC,Thanks bucket commander! I'm actually using two 18 gallon totes with this build. Just finished my other bucket in which I will be growing some blue dragon. Pictures will be coming soon.
SpaceBuckets,36a53i,grimnirreaps,2,Sat May 23 15:31:58 2015 UTC,Cool build. I've thought about using totes in a fashion similar to yours. Great job!

SpaceBuckets,36b1bq,SuperAngryGuy,2,Mon May 18 06:43:19 2015 UTC,"You don't need the blue LED- those cool white LEDs already have a lot of blue light in them (too much in my opinion, I've measured some of them at +9000K).  The green LED will have a lower voltage than the white LEDs. About 26-27 volts for the green compared to a little over 30 volts for the white LEDs.  For a main power supply get a bigger 24 volt unit rather than the 12 volt, 150W unit linked to. You will need to wire in a 3 prong grounded cord (Home Depot).  How many of these 600w converters do you have?"
SpaceBuckets,36b1bq,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Mon May 18 06:06:38 2015 UTC,I have 2 600w supplies right now 3rd is in the mail coming. Might buy a couple more because this is 1 of 4 boxes I want to build. Thanks SAG for the feedback! I was hoping I could use a power unit to do all of them. Well dang I even got a couple blue leds free really wanted to use them but makes sense the white is rated so high. It's like looking at the sun! If you know also what kind of fuses the 600w supplies use? I blew one in testing and was trying to find them.

SpaceBuckets,3685k2,SuperAngryGuy,3,Sun May 17 02:30:43 2015 UTC,You might want to try adding some cal-mag fertilizer to take care of that slight nutrient deficiency you have going of (some yellowing in the mid-upper plant with some slight tip burning but the lower leaves are very healthy). In this specific case the calcium should take care of the slight tip burning.  You're going to need a bigger bucket.
SpaceBuckets,3685k2,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sun May 17 06:53:30 2015 UTC,Thank you. Yea I'm not sure what we're going to do about space.  I'll order some cal-mag. Any specific brand you recommend?
SpaceBuckets,3685k2,JdH-AU,2,Sun May 17 10:51:19 2015 UTC,"Make a larger, brute SpaceBucket!  I use hydro fertilizers even with soil so I don't encounter these problems but have used this before.  What ever you choose, find something with low N-P-K numbers (those three numbers that you see) since you just need to supplement. This is another cal-mag product with low N-P-K numbers. You can find them in smaller container sizes."
SpaceBuckets,3685k2,JdH-AU,2,Sun May 17 11:41:41 2015 UTC,That's a big plant. Are you using a tote?

SpaceBuckets,3685k2,slightly-medicated,1 point,Sun May 17 11:50:32 2015 UTC,This is our first plant that unfortunately was somewhat neglected.  We were unsure of how soon it would need nutrients. It was looking terrible and not showing any growth.    We fed it Fox Farms Trio last Friday and again this past Wednesday.  It's been looking great and showing an improvement.   She has been under 16/8 for the past 3 weeks or so. She is planted in Fox Farms Ocean Forest with a layer of perlite on the bottom of a 3 gallon smart pot.    It is in a spacebucket with a 180 Watt ufo led. It has been getting distilled water that we have recently been pH adjusting to 6.3.
SpaceBuckets,3685k2,slightly-medicated,3,Sun May 17 02:36:22 2015 UTC,Day 80-ish???  How much room do you have?  That thing is gonna get way bigger when you go to 12/12!  I'd set it to 12/12 immediately.
SpaceBuckets,3685k2,clever_lever,1 point,Sun May 17 06:30:32 2015 UTC,Well she has been under 16/8 for about 3 weeks now.  We're gonna run out of room.  This was definitely a learning experience haha

SpaceBuckets,3682gh,karnivorouskeyz,3,Sun May 17 01:57:01 2015 UTC,Lights should be 2 inches away with CFL's. Water a little then just wait. It can be slow at times
SpaceBuckets,3684jb,SuperAngryGuy,3,Sun May 17 02:19:39 2015 UTC,This is our Blue Mystic Auto flower from nirvana shop.  It is planted in a 3 gallon smart pot in a spacebucket with Fox Farms Ocean Forest with a layer of perlite on the bottom.   A 90 UFO LED.   It is only day 20 so no nutrients yet. It will be getting 1/4 strength Fox Farms Trio around the 35 day mark.   It appears that the bottom leaves are nutrient burnt.  All water has been pH to 6.3.
SpaceBuckets,3684jb,SuperAngryGuy,8,Sun May 17 02:24:30 2015 UTC,"Add some nutes now. Your plant looks very unhealthy.  Measure the pH of the water run off and see what it is. I have a strong feeling it's going to be too low.  edit added ""off"""
SpaceBuckets,3684jb,Whisper06,2,Sun May 17 06:39:40 2015 UTC,Isn't it still too early to add nutrients? I have read in various places that FFOF is a hot soil and will burn young plants and to wait at least 30 days before adding nutrients. Is this correct?
SpaceBuckets,3684jb,SuperAngryGuy,4,Sun May 17 10:56:14 2015 UTC,"You've already got a lot of problems going on and is why I'm personally against these hot soils. No plant should be burning like this regardless if it's a hot soil. A lot of hot soils are inconsistent and I've seen a room full of plants mostly destroyed from a hot organic soil that had way too much phosphorus, for example.    What's the pH of the water run off? Not the water you add, but the pH of the water that drains out the bottom. Once we know this piece of information that then we can correct what's going on which is either nutrient lock up or not enough fertilizer in the soil (the consistency problem).  I would clip off those dead, brown leaves."
SpaceBuckets,3684jb,SuperAngryGuy,2,Sun May 17 11:30:29 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate your help.  Excuse me if this is a stupid question. It's almost time for it to be watered so I'd like to attempt to fix this with the next watering.  Is it OK to measure the pH of the water in the drip pan or does it have to be ""fresh""  run off?"

It's usually best to have the fans on when the lights are off but not so important to have them on when the lights are off as the plant does less work when it's in darkness.

SpaceBuckets,36648n,savonlechat,2,Sat May 16 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"For me, the decision to go with a bucket over a tent had a few factors. I rent my house and occasionally have the landlord round, a bucket is easier to hide than a bloody great tent. Also, I'm only growing for me, with no intention to sell, so massive yields are not necessary, a tent would be overkill. Cost could also be a factor, a full tent setup can be quite costly on the outlay, buckets are considerably cheaper. Other issues may include space available, tents have a pretty hefty footprint. edit : spelling mistake."
SpaceBuckets,36648n,ozzy52,1 point,Sat May 16 15:45:30 2015 UTC,"A couple of spacebuckets are easier to move out of your apartment overnight.  You can actually just put each one in a giant garbage sack and walk it out to your car, like you're taking out the trash.    Then you can drive them over to a very good friend's place to store for a day, when your landlord has to enter your apartment for some reason.  A grow tent is more economical if you plan on growing more than 1 plant, and with a larger tent you can get much greater yields, but a grow tent is not so easily portable."

SpaceBuckets,36648n,Roosvall,1 point,Sun May 17 11:47:07 2015 UTC,"I find them hard to compare really. Buckets and tents are two different things. The most important difference is scale. For some, the small package of the buckets is an advantage, but for others its a disadvantage. Viceversa, the tent can seem overwhelming for a new grower, who may not want a big commitment.  So! Both methods work great and give you good results. Buckets are small, portable and stealthier. Tents are big, comfortable and great-yielding (thanks to the HPS bulb).  I'm a believer in both methods, and I think (I know) that they can work together flawlessly."

I perfer to ask this comminity because usualy someone has some good info or advise based on their own experiences growing in buckets, such as having enough space etc. Plus it helps other beginners in similar situations. I guess this guy just wants his comment karma. Fair enough.  For those interested I have decided to go a little bigger just so the roots can develop fully, but if your bucket isn't big enough, something like I had in the picture I think would be ok."

The only thing youll have controll of is how much air is leaving the bucket, and as long as your space is comfortable (70f) more is better. HumidIty is less important than fresh air. Automation makes a lot more sense with an airconditioner, co2 controller,  dehumidifier, and a sealed room. The buckets just to small. I could see it being feasible for automated watering."

SpaceBuckets,36350q,Ekrof,2,Fri May 15 18:36:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, but not just monitoring.  Full control of the lighting, fans, and watering.  I'll put up some more pics when I have the buckets constructed :)"
SpaceBuckets,36350q,JungleofN00L,2,Sat May 16 00:01:49 2015 UTC,I wish you the best of luck in your bucket automation adventures
SpaceBuckets,36350q,Ekrof,1 point,Sat May 16 01:58:29 2015 UTC,Beautiful.. nice HMI.. i am also in automation/ Instrumentation... been thinking about doing a space bucket myself...
SpaceBuckets,36350q,ANAL-TEA-WREX,1 point,Fri May 15 18:37:47 2015 UTC,Do it and teach us :)

SpaceBuckets,36350q,JungleofN00L,1 point,Fri May 15 21:09:24 2015 UTC,Awesome!  I plan to use an Allen Bradley MicroLogix 1500 and a PanelView Plus 700 that I had laying around.  Unfortunately this hardware might be a little pricey for the average Bucketeer.  I certainly wouldn't spend the $2000 to buy this equipment new.
SpaceBuckets,36350q,SuperAngryGuy,1 point,Sat May 16 00:07:04 2015 UTC,Nice im well versed in 1500.. you might wanna go for 500.. since its free at AB website. Get a arduino and use relays.. easiest way. i think you can use a rs 232 or rs 485 shield and interface with wonderware.. dunno never tried it.  Hell you could always use some 7400 ic chips and relays.. probably along with a mux or decoder.  You wouldnt have a fancy HMI though lol.  They make HMI apps for arduino .. check out the app store
SpaceBuckets,36350q,JungleofN00L,1 point,Sat May 16 00:40:03 2015 UTC,"The MicroLogix 1500 PLC does use the Logix500 development software.  The PLC I'm using also has 11 built in output relays, so I'm good there.  I know absolutely nothing about arduino so I'd like to avoid it if possible."
SpaceBuckets,36350q,JungleofN00L,2,Sat May 16 00:54:30 2015 UTC,Its in your best interest to research arduino man... its a microcontroller for about 50 $... it has ladder logic compilers (freeware) and everything else.. you dont even need to know c programming to use it.
SpaceBuckets,36350q,kushdup,1 point,Sat May 16 01:24:21 2015 UTC,"Oh WOW, you just blew my mind!!!  I had no idea.  I always thought they were basically the same thing as a Raspberry Pi.  I love to use ladder logic, its so simple. I can't wait to check this out.  I am forever in your debt."
SpaceBuckets,36350q,kushdup,3,Sat May 16 01:49:30 2015 UTC,Check this out:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598272670/chip-the-worlds-first-9-computer/video_share  I prototype in analog since I can solve the inverted pendulum problem inside of an hour. Watch this video I made that took grand prize in a 555 timer competition a few years ago (I got a Fluke 287 and a tiny few oscilloscopes out of it) demonstrating various types of control with final judging by Han Camenzind. It links to a how-to of the worlds simplest balancing robot using PD control (got it down to 2 transistors and a hobby servo).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXeSsevsNNE
SpaceBuckets,36350q,Lleaff,2,Sat May 16 06:33:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah for sure.. you might also want to check out pcduino(75$).. its a microcontroller and a pc with 1gb ram and i think and  a Allwinner A20 processor.  You can run linux or android as the os. It has wifi and everything along with digital and analog I:O.  You can remote into the pcduino and implement control. The pcduino is compatable with the arduino... shit theres even PID control you can implement with it.  Ive been wanting to do it, its tedious though.. gotta get data points and do it many times to get what the average PV step change would be. Then just use the various different tuning methods (Zeigler Nichols.  Lambda.. Merl Smith) to get your proportion. Inregal time and derivative time (sec)."

SpaceBuckets,361eey,Hyroero,2,Fri May 15 07:41:56 2015 UTC,90w ufo. Side lighting ready to go when/if it gets a little bigger.  I flushed my coco with water then watered it through twice with a very low dose of nutes to pre load the coco. Some people seem to be against this and for it so it's hard to know what's going to work but I figured I'd go for it.  Mixed in about 40 percent perlite and a hand full or two of dolomite lime.  The seed is an assorted auto so it's a bit of surprise. I have another in the same pot but inside a jiffy pot which I'm giving just plain water.  You can see what looks like nute burn on the tips which sucks but I'll wait it out and see.
SpaceBuckets,361eey,Bucketlink,1 point,Fri May 15 07:48:09 2015 UTC,So is this coco/perlite in a pot? Or is this hempy bucket style?
SpaceBuckets,361eey,CrisSwain,1 point,Fri May 15 08:02:02 2015 UTC,Pot. It fills the inside of my bucket 20litres perfectly but let's me pull it out for maintenance
