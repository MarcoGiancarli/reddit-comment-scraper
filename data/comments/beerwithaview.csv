beerwithaview,3dcooh,jackityjack,2,Wed Jul 15 16:00:52 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm jealous! It was a great experience! If you're staying in Interlaken definitely try out the boat ferry ride. There's a ton of beautiful hiking trails just outside of the city that bring you to some great sites. In Mürren there are some great hiking trails, one In particular one that takes you from Mürren to lauterbrunnen is a great view of the snow caps and it takes you behind a waterfall which is stunning. Otherwise if you're willing to spend the money I'd suggest taking the gondola up to the highest point on that side, I can't remember exactly what it's called but that was a breathtaking view. And definitely pack food unless you want to spend $25 on a burger. If you'd like I can send you a picture of the map of the trails!"
