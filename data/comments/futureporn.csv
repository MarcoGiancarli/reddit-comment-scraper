futureporn,3e2pth,Siedrah,4,Tue Jul 21 16:26:25 2015 UTC,I don't think they're ring worlds. They don't look big enough and there's no sun at the center. Looks more like a culture orbital.
futureporn,3e2pth,TDaltonC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:35 2015 UTC,"about 3 times earth's orbit, actually. Earth is, on average, one AU, or 93 million miles."

futureporn,3e2pth,WilliamtheV,13,Tue Jul 21 19:15:18 2015 UTC,"I imagine that those orbitals must be made for different species. There's a fixed relationship between an orbitals circumference, apparent gravity, and day/night cycle. So if you're building an orbital for humans (24hr day and earth-standard apparent gravity) you know exactly how big your orbital must be."
futureporn,3e2pth,TDaltonC,9,Tue Jul 21 15:42:34 2015 UTC,"Not true, the culture have half sized orbitals with a field mirror centre to modify day length. The gravity is simply modified by controlling the speed of rotation."
futureporn,3e2pth,omegashadow,4,Tue Jul 21 17:37:38 2015 UTC,Not to mention special culture orbitals like the embassy at the nestworld of Syaung-un which for several reasons don't have a normal day/night cycle.

futureporn,3e2pth,TDaltonC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:50 2015 UTC,To have the correct gravity on a smaller orbital you lose the sync with the day night rotation cycle. If I remember correctly the center of the orbital is perpendicular to the sun with a mirror in the center reflecting incident light to the correct parts of the orbital.
futureporn,3e2pth,omegashadow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:45 2015 UTC,"That sounds reasonable, but not very elegant, not very culture. Tough it would give the sunward side of the orbital a nice dusky look."

Tenjin Hidetaka's work seems to only get better with time and I think this newer piece is easily one of his best.  That's saying a lot, considering the quality of his previous paintings, especially what can be seen in his two volumes Art Works of Macross - Valkyries and Valkyries - Second Sortie.  Unfortunately, this is not at a resolution I'm happy with, because I scanned the image from a small flyer I recently picked up at a hobby shop in Tokyo.

Someone mentioned there that the logic behind this is that there is nowhere to hide in space, so manoeuvring becomes pretty much pointless and the ship with the most guns and armor wins. Missile defense could also be an option, but it would have to be really good to neutralize all the firepower from a ship like this."

Yes, Mr. Niven certainly likes to push the bounties of plausibility, but I think his greatest talent is his ability to systematically build a foundation of scientific reality under outlandish concepts, to the point that they become genuinely believable.  While I enjoy many of the concepts in Ringworld Engineers (the second Ringworld book), I think it isn't close to his best work. I consider the height of is writing to be his Known Space stories from the mid-sixties to the mid-seventies (Engineers is from 1979). I definitely recommend going back and rereading that stuff. I think it stands up very well to this day."

This appears in James Gurney's very interesting book Imaginative Realism: How to Paint What Doesn't Exist. It's written as a helpful how-to for artists, but it's also beautiful art book that gives his fascinating insight into the creative process.  Very much like John Berkey and Syd Mead, James Gurney is an artist's artist. The combination of his technique and the ""lived-in future"" style he uses for some of his science fiction work gives me the impression of what we'd see if Berkey and Mead had been combined in some sort of teleportation mishap. I mean that in all the best ways. I think he's an extraordinary talent, with a unique imagination that matches it.  While I would call this piece an exception, most of James Gurney's work would be classified as ""fantasy.""  Not only are those pieces different in theme from his science fiction work, they also tend to have a different; softer and more classical; artistic style."

As much as someone may say that it's a ""pledge"" or ""donation"" these are ship sales, and they are treated as such (as in you pay VAT).   You're pre-ordering DLC.   The current model is that you can't buy ships on release, but you'll be able to buy in-game currency through a cash shop.   Also to mention there will likely be a ship store- CIG stated there would be no LTI after November 2013, and yet every new concept has LTI to push sales."
futureporn,3bdq9u,GSlayerBrian,9,Sun Jun 28 13:52:17 2015 UTC,"Admittedly it does seem like once a precedence for buying ships with real money is set, it might be weird to eventually stop that. And if someone wants to spend $400 on a ship that would take a few weeks of in-game work to earn, that $400 could be put to everyone's benefit by funding further improvements to the game.  CIG is playing a risky game with the crowd funding and incentive. I just hope it altogether works out."
futureporn,3bdq9u,JustAnAvgJoe,9,Sun Jun 28 14:13:18 2015 UTC,"To be honest I wouldn't hold it against them if the continued to sell the ships after release.   I wouldn't approve of it, but like you said- it makes sense from a business perspective.   Currently the concept sales are a way to generate almost pure revenue with minimal cost."
futureporn,3bdq9u,GSlayerBrian,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:59:50 2015 UTC,"it makes sense from a business perspective.   That and I don't find it unethical to spend real money on things that could otherwise be earned by playing the game. The money spent on the in-game item was still earned, one way or another. I used to justify buying WoW gold by saying that if I didn't have a job, I could play WoW all day and earn gold legitimately. But since I work all day earning money, I can only play WoW about an hour each day. So if I can turn my effort at work into rewards in WoW, then it's not really like I'm cheating. I'm either working, or I'm working.  Granted, someone could argue that it's unfair that rich people could just buy whatever they want and not have to ""earn"" it, but that's just a fact of life and not limited to a video game. The key is making it not pay to win. (So, all you can really do with real money is reduce the time it takes you to obtain something that can otherwise be obtaine through acceptable in-game effort. It's when things are either impossible or virtually impossible due to great difficulty to obtain by working for them in-game, but can be bought for something like $100 which is way too much for the average person but nothing for the affluent.)  Ninja Edit: I should mention that at the time I bought WoW gold I had still thought it was all farmed, so I felt like the gold was earned legitimately, and my money was earned legitimately, so there was no moral, ethical, or legal dilemma. It hadn't entered my mind at that time that the majority of the gold was stolen from hacked accounts. I stopped buying WoW gold (and even at my peak maybe spent altogether $100 over about a year) before Wrath came out, and I got into the swing of earning plenty of gold myself. Knowing now that most gold sold that way is stolen, and most of that is usually returned to the victim by Blizzard and not always confiscated from who it goes to, all it does is cause headaches to the victims and the Blizzard GMs, and promotes gold inflation. No bueno. I don't support the practice, now. (It's mostly moot at this point since the game tokens came out, anyway.)"
futureporn,3bdq9u,xFoeHammer,2,Mon Jun 29 03:29:49 2015 UTC,So does that mean that when the game starts there will he a bunch of wealthy powerful warlords who invested in the development of the game?  If so that's kind if awesome. Hope we'll be able to build up armies and destroy them!  But actually I have no idea how this game is going to be. I should look into it because what I have seen is awesome.

X3 is a series of space simulation games with a wide range of things to do from flying fighters to commanding big fleets of capital ships, building production stations in space, trading etc. One of the enemies in that game are the Xenon, formerly artificial general intelligence built by humans as VN probes sent to terraform other star systems to human specs. One day they showed up in Earths orbit and nearly annihilated humanity.  In Sword of the Stars (a space turn based strategy game with real-time space battles) there's VN probes as random encounters. They assimilated your spaceships if you don't destroy the little ones fast enough, and if they get back with the resources (of your ships) to their mothership, they're going to build more. If you do annoy them they will come back later on with much more murderous units bent on annihilating your planets. (And planetary populations are very vulnerable in that game. A few minutes of unimpeded bombardment and billions of your people are dead, no exaggeration).  So yeah, i consider sending out VN probes to be a crime against (biological) sentience :P"

I love the games but this is a necessary and fair warning :P Maybe you want to take a look at a letsplay of it first. Maybe this one, haven't watched it myself but have seen other videos by the letsplayer, ""willfe"".  There is quite a bit of lore in these games, so it's not a generic strategy game. Also, the games' modding/scripting scene is one of the biggest for just about any video game, there's loads and loads of awesome mods (changing game files) and scripts (using the in-game scripting engine).

futureporn,3ahwo9,someonesDad,15,Thu Jun 25 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"Last time those ""what if other planets replaced the moon?"" animations made the rounds, I wondered what civilization would look like on the Map of Earth. Several days in GIMP later...  Life under the Arch.   It's as accurate as I could manage, because I'm mildly obsessed with the setting. Scale and brightness are based on the moon in the original photographs. The far side of the ring is visually half the width of the moon, because it's the same physical width as the sun but twice as far away, and the sun and moon look roughly the same size. From there I started calculating relative width based on angle to the horizon, and thus created a hugegantic PNG that I could 'shop into various pretty pictures. I'm afraid the illustrative continents and oceans on the book covers are entirely romanticized. Even the Maps would barely be distinguishable.   Incidentally, nights by archlight are a hundred times brighter than the full moon, thanks to the high albedo of the continents and oceans hanging over your head. That's still a hundred times dimmer than when the sun is behind a lone cloud, and several thousand times darker than direct sunlight, but nevertheless overcast skies are the only way to have a dark night."
futureporn,3ahwo9,geoman2k,30,Sat Jun 20 20:20:32 2015 UTC,"Many years ago when the first Halo came out Larry Niven was asked if he was consulted or gave permission to use his Ringworld idea as a basis for the Halo franchise. He said no and that he wasn't offended or felt his concept was stolen. Somewhere on his website's forums is the dialog I'm paraphrasing, sorry I cannot find the actual quote or link.   Personally I think the Halo franchise should have given him a lot of credit for creating such a fantastic idea and world."
futureporn,3ahwo9,SpiderFnJerusalem,18,Sat Jun 20 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but Ringworld goes around a sun, right? That would make it pretty significantly different from the Halo rings which orbit planets."
futureporn,3ahwo9,Fang88,15,Sat Jun 20 17:17:31 2015 UTC,"Correct.  Actually, I think the way it is depicted in that image isn't quite right. The curvature wouldn't be this close and apparent because the ring is so mind-bogglingly humongous.   You wouldn't be able to make out continents overhead since the surface would be millions of km away."
futureporn,3ahwo9,SpiderFnJerusalem,2,Sat Jun 20 23:22:30 2015 UTC,You can look at the Earth from the Moon and make out continents. Why couldn't you do that here?
futureporn,3ahwo9,SpiderFnJerusalem,7,Sun Jun 21 01:15:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not an astronomer. So take what I'm saying with a grain of salt. I've also never seen anything as large as a ringworld. But the moon is only 380 000 km away.   That's nothing like what you would see when you look up at a 45° angle from the plane of larry niven's ringworld orbiting the sun itself. The surface you look at would be dozens of millions of km away,  the earth would be nothing but a bright spot at that distance.  I forgot how wide the plane of the ringworld was in the books.  But if it was wide enough to see more than a thin line you wouldn't be able to see continents,  blue and green smudges at best."
futureporn,3ahwo9,Retrosmith,2,Sun Jun 21 11:42:05 2015 UTC,"You're underestimating the size of the geographical features we're seeing in the painting.  For example one hundred Earths (easily many more) would fit end-to-end in the sea that's located center left. It's the scale that needs to be grasped, and Larry Niven created it to be intentionally difficult to do just that.  We want to fall back on our experience on our little Earth and that just doesn't work for the Ringworld.  Also, I answered your width question in a post, yesterday.  It's roughly one million miles.  The scale, man, the scale.  It's ScalePorn. It really is."
futureporn,3ahwo9,StuffMaster,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:59:23 2015 UTC,Sorry I'm on mobile since yesterday.  I guess I missed your comment.   A million miles does indeed sound large enough to make that picture more or less plausible. I just find it weird that the builders would make continents that are tens of thousands of miles accross with only small patches of water between them. Seems a bit dry doesn't it? But then who knows how the weather on the ringworld works?    I think I need to reread those books.
futureporn,3ahwo9,Fang88,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:21:25 2015 UTC,"I understand. Accepted and I appreciate your civility about it. :)   What we actually can't see, due to the distances involved, are ""smaller"" bodies of water, like ones that are the size of the Pacific Ocean! Of course, that means there are also an unbelievable number of lakes and rivers, like the the ones represented in the foreground of the painting, that we can't make out.  Atmosphere influenced by the heating and cooling caused by the day/night cycles of the shadow squares will interact with atmosphere that's under the influence of the massive and ""smaller"" seas, which are bound to maintain an even temperature, creating air currents and weather systems.  None should be particularly violent as the temperature variations would still be rather limited and I think it's safe to assume the builders would have created a land/sea ratio and topography that ensured mild weather."
futureporn,3ahwo9,StuffMaster,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:22:25 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, didn't the builders also design large heat sinks on the underside of the Ringworld in certain places, to control the temperature in specific areas?  What did Niven tell us (if anything) about the effect of the Ringworld's spin on its weather?"
futureporn,3ahwo9,Fang88,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:09:33 2015 UTC,It's millions of km away. Totally different scale than the moon.
futureporn,3ahwo9,GiantSpaceWhale,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:18:21 2015 UTC,That's too big. They should have made it smaller.
futureporn,3ahwo9,apatt,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:19:26 2015 UTC,The ring? I think it's orbit (Earth-like?) dictated it's size. Has to be the right distance from the sun to get the right temperature.
futureporn,3ahwo9,Roderick111,-1,Sat Jul 4 16:46:58 2015 UTC,Or they could of just made a smaller ring that orbits the sun and spins  in place so everyone experiences a day night cycle.  Why do these Scify writers always have to take thing to such extreme irrational bullshit?
futureporn,3ahwo9,Sinister-Kid,0,Sat Jul 4 16:49:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah but, only barely.    http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1249.html  Also, the moon's 230,000 miles from the Earth - a much longer distance than the Earth's diameter, which is 7,900 miles.    If larry Niven's Ringworld was the size of a typical planet orbiting the sun, I think you'd be able to see the continents on the other side.  But I don't know just how big it's supposed to be.  Edit, yeah read some other comments, apparently its way bigger than that.  So yeah, you wouldn't be able to see anything on the other side."
futureporn,3ahwo9,mindbleach,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:25:06 2015 UTC,"This painting depicts the brief moment of ""sunrise"" (this location on the Ringworld emerging from the shadow of a shadow square. It's always given me the impression that the intention is to represent the optical illusion (a lens effect caused by the ring's atmosphere) which occurs during that unusual (to us not living on the Ringworld) moment.  It also does not depict the area ""overhead,"" as that would indeed not be visible, due to the brightness of the structure's star.  It's plausible that what we do see of the Ringworld in this painting would be visible, though. The great majority of what makes up the distance between our perspective in the piece and the distant areas we can see consists of the vacuum of space.  The limitations built into our brains' ability to process the size of extremely large objects and what that does to our perception also needs to be taken into account.  There's a point at which our brains give up an say ""Don't worry about exactly how big that thing is. It's just very, very big."" The best example of first-hand experience I've had with this is observing, with binoculars, climbers ascending El Capitan, while I was on the floor of Yosemite Valley. Discovering exactly how tiny they were in relation to the size of the mountain forced my brain to accept that said mountain is many, many, hundreds of times larger than it had originally told me. (Looking again, without the binoculars, the brain again gave up, with my perception again telling me ""Don't worry about it. It's just big."")  I think the painter deserves credit, not only for his artistic ability, but for the thought he seems to have given to the atmospheric effects of the Ringworld, as well as the realities of human perception.  (I'd love to see what it would look like to a Puppeteer or a Kzin.)"
futureporn,3ahwo9,quyman,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:24:24 2015 UTC,"Great comment, so I guess Ringworld's non-horizon would not look like that in the picture."
futureporn,3ahwo9,mindbleach,6,Sun Jun 21 00:16:42 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Ian Banks Culture novels, the Halo rings are more on those scales anyways."
futureporn,3ahwo9,PetevonPete,5,Sat Jun 20 16:35:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's kind of like putting a time traveling sports car that leaves fire trails into your story and not talking about a Back to the Future influence. I think the late 90s/early 00s were just a different time for gaming, where borrowing heavily from films and books was more acceptable than it is today. Obviously the gaming industry was huge but it wasn't viewed as a serious medium at the time so things like that were more forgivable. I mean look at how much Halo took from Aliens; among other things, it basically just lifted a character verbatim from the film. I don't think they would get away with that nowadays."

futureporn,3ahwo9,xFoeHammer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:09:08 2015 UTC,"Only in broad strokes. Aliens informed space-marine video-game tropes to such a high degree that any gamer watching Aliens for the first time will recognize most of the jokes, jump-scares, and set pieces from the film. It's like how The Thing was obviously seen by so many survival-horror directors - the only bit that's not been copied a million times is when the dog's skull falls out."

I was 18 (which made it 1985) and a fool, when a few friends and I each payed a few bucks to have some liquid LSD dripped in our eyes. (We didn't even know the guys!! Like I said, a fool.) It hit us in less than fifteen minutes, and it hit us like a ton of fucking bricks. It was the second best trip we ever had. (Not sure what it was about the blotter that that was the actual best, but there was something.) I've taken some stupid gambles in my life and that one is higher on the list, but, looking back, I'm glad I did it. We had a hell of a good time.  Disclaimer: Kids, don't do it. We got lucky. You might not."

futureporn,38nkx1,moepwizzy,3,Fri Jun 5 12:22:23 2015 UTC,One of my all time favorite artists. He did a lot of early Star Wars art too..   http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/John_Berkey
futureporn,38nkx1,Kyle_Crafty,8,Fri Jun 5 13:55:59 2015 UTC,"One of mine, too ...  This post I put up at the Star Wars subreddit about a month ago was pretty well received and this seems like a good place to mention it.  It was this poster and this is the text I included with it (including a John Berkey gallery at the end) -  This wonderful poster hung on my wall for many, many years after I got it in 1977, included with the Star Wars double vinyl soundtrack album. I've always loved it, but the fact that it came folded with the record meant it had those annoying, distracting fold-lines. Well, not anymore. I shopped the damned things out. :) For the sake of full disclosure, I also removed the pinholes and otherwise cleaned up the white border.  For anyone unfamiliar with him, John Berkey (1932-2008) was a flat-out legendary (primarily) science fiction artist who was also responsible for quite a few well known Hollywood movie posters.  George Lucas has said that the paintings of John Berkey provided him with inspiration as he was developing Star Wars, particularly this piece, which Lucas credits as his inspiration for the Death Star. (George Lucas purchased the original.)  He had hoped to tap Berkey to create promotional and other art the film, but contractual restrictions on the artist made that legally impossible.  Consequently, the only John Berkey art the public saw at the time of the first Star Wars was this poster and the cover of the film's novelization (which was released in 1976, months before Star Wars opened in theaters).  edit: Considering the interest in this poster, here's a gallery of John Berkey's amazing work that I put together recently."
futureporn,38nkx1,ultimatecowboy,2,Fri Jun 5 18:14:02 2015 UTC,Interesting - did he do the cover of the Anne Leckie books? It looks like a similar art style.
futureporn,38nkx1,Capitalist_P-I-G,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"Though John Berkey did many, many book covers, a Google image search didn't bring up any he did that appeared on an Anne Leckie book. I did find a John Harris cover (covers, really - it's a single paining divided into three parts, each third released on a third of the books) for Ancillary Justice.  This is the full painting. John Berkey was a big influence on John Harris."

The ""moon"" can still be a huge planet very far away, it's hard to guess distances in space where sizes are inhumanly big and there's no fog-effect.  See this image, you can see the clouds, their shadows, and no atmosphere. I still say it's a colony on a small moon with an atmosphere, circling a much bigger highly volcanic planet."

It's being used to create miniature Black Holes, which hold enormous promises for Free Energy, Anti-Gravity Travel/Devices and possibly Teleportation across space. Within its housing chamber, time itself is compressed and the scientists and engineers who work on this device experience one hour to every twelve of ours. When the device is brought online, a Singularity Envelope will make time within the core virtually stop. Technically, the device could compress our entire plant into a point no larger than a Ping-Pong ball in one fifth of a second. That's why so much energy is necessary; to generate a magnetic field which contains the gravitational pull of mass as its compacted into billionths of its ""ordinary"" size.

Public services should NOT be a charity for employees - there are better ways of dealing with loss of employment through automation (e.g. Universal Basic Income) than with forcing services to keep on unneeded staff, if there is a better way to do it.  Edit: I just re-read this and realize that it sounded like I'm advocating firing redundant employees.  Honestly, I'm torn on this - as a taxpayer I want the best value for money, but with public services, I think that's taking it a bit far - while they have a duty to taxpayers, there's also different motives in play than with a pure private enterprise.  Training (hah!) someone to be a train driver and then kicking them out is probably beyond what I'd feel comfortable with a public service doing; at the very least, there ought to be retraining and a long transitional period for someone with such specific skills who signed on with an expectation of a steady safe job.  Ideally, you'd be able to deal with a lot of the workforce through attrition, moving other employees over to jobs where their skills could be employed (e.g. route planning and maintenance) without just booting them out."
futureporn,34t6vl,DontMentionLobsters,23,Mon May 4 12:58:05 2015 UTC,A basic income isn't going to happen- certainly not for several decades. It doesn't even figure vaguely in this sort of question- the only thing that's going to befall these workers is being thrown down to a minimum wage job.

futureporn,34t6vl,poiro,10,Mon May 4 18:37:43 2015 UTC,"They're not really being paid that much for the skill. In part, they're being paid that much for the stress and unpleasant working environment. Aside from the antisocial hours and dark, lonely conditions, there is an all-too-real chance that someone is going to throw themselves in front of the train and commit suicide every time the driver pulls into a station. Witnessing that is not an easy thing to live with, even if the driver knows there probably really was nothing they could have done to prevent the tragedy.  Of course there is also an element of unions throwing their weight around over the years, and computers aren't going to feel survivor's guilt, so if the job can be properly automated now then none of the above is a good reason not to do so."
futureporn,34t6vl,Silhouette,5,Mon May 4 20:06:18 2015 UTC,"Their ""unpleasant working environment"" is the nicer part of the trains that thousands endure every day and there's about 20 suicides on the underground each year, which is hardly significant.   Firefighters have much worse conditions than a comfy chair,  nurses deal with suicides daily, most teachers have a lot more stress than just pressing buttons for a few hours. I just can't justify paying a tube driver over twice what those people earn. I honestly think if you quartered their wage (to 13k from a proposed 52k) you'd still have tons of people willing to do the job."
futureporn,34t6vl,poiro,4,Mon May 4 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I think a lot of your statistics are inaccurate (and a few minutes with a search engine finds numerous sources that agree).   Their ""unpleasant working environment"" is the nicer part of the trains that thousands endure every day   But only for a few minutes at a time, not stuck in a cab for extended periods without so much as the ability to get up and stretch your legs, never mind having a coffee or visiting the bathroom.  Also, ""endure"" is a pretty strong word for the modern LU trains. London is crowded, and London's transport systems are all crowded at peak times, but conditions on the Underground are a lot better generally than they used to be. However, we digress.   there's about 20 suicides on the underground each year, which is hardly significant.    Sadly, there are more than that most years on the London Underground. Given there are roughly 3,000 drivers, statistically 1 in every 2-3 drivers could expect to see at least one suicide if they did that job as a life-long career.   Firefighters have much worse conditions than a comfy chair   Actually, firefighters are somewhat similar, in that (as we are reminded every time they go on strike) a lot of their time is spent in rec rooms at the station, and for their level of pay they work considerably fewer hours than many, enough that some take on second jobs as well. Firefighters really earn their pay when the alarm does sound, dealing with situations many of us are glad we don't have to.   nurses deal with suicides daily   There are roughly two orders of magnitude more qualified nursing staff in the NHS than qualified drivers on the London Underground, and there are roughly two orders of magnitude more suicides in the UK as a whole than specifically on the LU. So statistically, there isn't much in it, and thankfully dealing with suicide is still far from an everyday occurrence even for nurses. Still, most of those nurses aren't going to witness a suicide first-hand and feel responsible for it in the same way, and while losing a patient is always horrible, at least full-time medical staff are normally working in a team and not left second-guessing themselves every time it happens.   most teachers have a lot more stress than just pressing buttons for a few hours.   True enough, but it's really not the button-pressing that we're talking about here, is it?  That all said, if you're arguing that some professions in the UK are severely underpaid for what they contribute, I couldn't agree more, with teaching and nursing (and a lot of related professions in each case) perhaps the two most serious examples."

Sources:  http://www.dailytech.com/Artificial+Leaves+Act+as+Solar+Cells+Imitate+Nature/article19725.htm http://www.fastcompany.com/biomimicry/making-solar-panels-as-ubiquitous-and-efficient-as-leaves http://cleantechnica.com/2014/08/21/solar-cell-breakthrough-artificial-leaf-beats-photosynthesis/ http://inhabitat.com/13-year-old-makes-solar-power-breakthrough-by-harnessing-the-fibonacci-sequence/
futureporn,32oh6k,ThePeej,20,Wed Apr 15 13:41:03 2015 UTC,I think specifically he is referring to the panels casting what would be constant shadows on each other...
futureporn,32oh6k,DanzaDragon,5,Wed Apr 15 19:36:16 2015 UTC,"Precisely, if the rotational efficiency of the leaves were more like this, and this, it would be far more productive. Although, I guess that would be less appealing and without enough leaves, it would be inadequate shade for cars."

futureporn,32oh6k,that_music_dude,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:21:35 2015 UTC,"It is unbelievable how many upvotes this absolute garbage comment has gotten.  A simple perusal of the photovoltaics page on wikipedia reveals the mechanisms behind cell efficiency. Maximizing the efficiency through orientation alone is done in one way only: by facing the panel directly towards the sun and maximizing the area. So, as is obvious, the optimal configuration is the one you see implemented in solar power stations all across the world.....sheets of PV cells that orient themselves towards the sun. This has the added benefit of being the easiest configuration to clean.  That ""kid uses fibonacci sequence"" tin-foil hat situation has been ripped apart on here more times than I can remember."
futureporn,32oh6k,TheStevenator,-1,Thu Apr 16 19:20:36 2015 UTC,Umbrella's are inefficient at capturing power...  But people still spend money to put them up to block the sun.  It really depends on what the cost would be in the future for the panels
futureporn,32oh6k,ShadowRam,9,Wed Apr 15 18:44:16 2015 UTC,"some words from the artist about this piece:   Many of the most unpleasant aspects of urban life are caused by cars, for both driver and the city itself. Large sweltering expanses of tarmac in cities contribute heavily to the urban heat island effect, whilst cars also become unbearably hot in summer sitting in these urban deserts.  Optimizing the heliostatic photovoltaic panels ultimately resulted in their leaflike shape. Although never intentionally conceived to mimic the form of a tree, the panels rotate to follow the path of the sun throughout the day – much like sunflowers – absorbing light whilst also providing optimal shading for cars. Although all parked cars can benefit from shading, electric vehicles can directly charge their batteries by plugging into the ‘solar trees.’  Solar Tree is unique among anti-auto pollution designs in that it empathizes with the anthropomorphized automobile, but particularly with the electric car, providing a place for overworked, spent cars to regain their lost torque, to relax beneath the trees, to gain back their juice in an optimal stress-free environment.  source: http://deeprana94.deviantart.com/art/Solar-Forest-208290425"

But then you see that couple in the far-left of the image, just sitting there, casually taking in the whole scene with no hint of alarm or care, suddenly the whole pic takes a different turn.

However, my mother is fluent in the language, and I have what I'd consider ""functional"" French. I'm not fully conversational, but I know enough to get by with the occasional slip into Frenglish.  The European French tended to be pretty huge assholes towards us, despite the fact my mother and I spoke strictly French to them. However, the French of what I assume to be Arabic descent were insanely nice to us. Like, some of the nicest people I've ever met. It was really strange.  Overall, I sort of chalked it up to big city life. I imagine if a non-American visited NYC, they'd think all Americans were assholes too."

His paintings are always an odd mixture of the domestic, mundane and even nostalgic, with the odd and surreal aspects of retro sci/fi.  Kind of what I imagine a failed or accidental instrusion of an alien civilization would do to our very pedestrial world, if it had happened in the 90s. Kind of a nordic or north american version of the novel ""Roadside Picnic"".  Nevertheless, his sci/fi is also very retro looking!

Cities and towns put things like this in places like this, because places like this are zoned for this sort of thing, you put it near hi traffic areas because this is fairly expensive piece of infrastructure.  you don't want someone to crash into it. and the royal crown on it probably is the symbol of the country it's in.

Even if it was in the middle of nowhere there would be at least a single charging station somewhere down the road, the size of the machine, currently from this article we can deduce that a charging station costs ~26k, do you think you can open a gas station for 26k? Definitely not, considering with Gas station you have to buy fuckton of land (though cheap since it's, well, nowhere really... I think), materials for the building (which each of the two points I would bet would accumulate above 26k), equipment, labour, gas and not to mention facilities and electricity, and yet in the middle of a desert you have gas stations at which you can readily fill your gas tank with, quite uncanny, isn't it?

futureporn,2xsr7r,ethan_kahn,42,Tue Mar 3 16:17:39 2015 UTC,"I like images like this that open the ability to imagine the story surrounding it.   The sentinel is huge, and carries a gun. What is it defending against? I imagine a huge organism, rather than a huge robot, because a gun that resembles a rifle seems like it wouldnt be best suited to fight a machine.   And why is the sentinal a humanoid? That implies to me that the enemy would fear a large humanoud, for some reason, since I imagine that to go through the effort to create a humanoid sentinel would be the most practical design, rather than say an enormous tank, or turret or what not.   And who created the sentinel? The kid and dog sat on the car shows that they live in a modern, rustic environment. Are other parts of Earth far, far superior to this part? Or was the sentinel a gift from an ally alien race to defend Earth?   I know that it's probably just supposed to be artful, but the thought that these sorts of things inspire in me is putting together the world in which their image was taken."
futureporn,2xsr7r,WildTurkey81,130,Tue Mar 3 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"I wish that I could answer these questions for you. We have been asking ourselves those very same things ever since this thing showed up in '49. You seem to be new to this so I'll give you some of the back story, what little there is of it.  On July 11, 1949 a grower in Nebraska woke up to discover what looked for all the world to be a quarter mile high statue of an American minuteman standing on a low ridge at the edge of a corn field neighboring his just south of the town of Scribner in the east portion of the state. I will not go into details as to the reaction here and abroad that this puzzling discovery inspired. Suffice it to say that for a few days our military forces remained at the highest alert they had been since the attack on Pearl Harbor and that to this day, twenty years later, their alert status has never returned to peace time levels.   And is well it should not. Two rather unsettling features about this object which we all learned in the first few hours; one, that it was, and to this day continues, to transmit a very low frequency radio pulse at a set interval of 45 seconds, and two, that there is a kind of ""shield"" surrounding it which prevents any kind of intrusion or contact with the ""statue"" (if it can be called that). Research teams have gone as far as excavating tunnels under it in the hope that this ""shield"" would be only above soil but that did not yield any results. It was discovered that the shield forms a sphere around the object which extends well into the ground. The shield is impenetrable. No one as been able to establish how it is created or what is it made of. All that anyone has ever been able to assert is that it is transparent, that it distorts light very slightly and that it can stand everything we have thrown at it short of an atomic bomb (no one so far as dared risk that for fear of what might happen to the landscape around it. The theory is that an atomic blast won't do anything either.)  Needless to say, this mystery has changed a few things in our world. It turned the Cold War around, for starters. Once we realized the Reds where not behind it and they realized we weren't either, it became clear to both that we where dealing with something that could very well destroy this whole world twenty times over and that we where better off preparing to fight it instead of each other. Then there was the impact on religious beliefs. This thing, (which by now it's well agreed is probably not a statue) looks like a man, yet is made of what looks like machine parts. So the idea goes that somewhere ""out there"" someone either looks like us or has been watching us and is trying to communicate. So it goes to reason that we are not the Lord Father's one and only creation. But if we are not, then the Bible is wrong! So you can see where the debate is at. Scholars have proposed all kinds of theories as to why the Bible doesn't mention the Lord creating another race somewhere else and all that hoopla. (Personally, I believe, why not? The Lord himself only knows why it was never put in writing on the Good Book.) A small economy has also sprung around the minuteman, movies, books (fiction and non-fiction) tourist attractions, you know how these things get.  So that's the story so far. Someone called it The Nebraska Minuteman back when it first investigated and the name stuck. Authorities and agencies around the world remain ever alert and ready should this thing ever do anything else other than send out that faint radio pulse. After 38 years, the novelty has worn off with the public and the crowds of onlookers have thinned somewhat but it's still very much in everyone's minds.   I have this crazy idea that I'm careful to mention around people that this whole affair has the US Air Force or some government agency involved in some way. See, Scribner Airport used to be Scribner Air Field. They opened it in '42 and they used it to ""train"" B-17 and B-24 pilots. I just always thought that was too much coincidence. I mean, the most monumental discovery in our history and it just so happens to show up a stone's throw from an Army air base? Something about that always made me suspect.  Funny, we all thought the world was going to end wrapped in mushroom clouds and here we are contemplating some kind of alien invasion instead. It's like something out of a science fiction flick. Strange days.  edit: words."

futureporn,2xsr7r,HotGrilledSpaec,3,Wed Mar 4 03:48:50 2015 UTC,"The boy sat on the roof of his Dad's car. He looked toward the mountains, the desert, the West, the Moon, the Stars, and the Sentinel. Eyes shining. He was the world's most avid watcher of old Westerns and modern science fiction. But nothing could compare to this. Nothing. Not to him. Well, except his dad.  ""Dad, was he here when you were a kid?""  The older man couldn't quite understand the question for a second. Maybe the Van Allen Belts had fucked up his brain. Maybe the Jack habit he'd started in on in earnest in 1973. Maybe grief over the death of his wife. The boy's mother. The campfire had gone out in the center of the clearing, essentially, and occasionally cold winds blew in. Then they faded away.  ""No he wasn't.""  ""When did he get here?""  Another damned-fool question. That boy...such genius...wasting it on philosophical questions. He'd always been...NO...  ""1973.""  ""Why? Who brought him here?""  The old man took a swig from his hip flask. So many goddamn useless questions. Maybe the folks at the University were right. Maybe the Sentinel did watch over their thoughts. Did that matter? His wife's last great work was still wasting his damn talent and childlike inquiry asking why the sky was blue. Fractally wrong. The sky was magnificent, desolate, malevolent, divine...and the corn was deader every year. The peanuts had been gone for years. Cows were rarer than...well.  He indicated the gigantic robot, pointing with his lower lip in the Indian fashion. ""I did. With some friends. Before your Mom died.""  ""COOL!"" The boy climbed down from the roof of the Trans Am and hugged his dad. ""What...what does he do?""  There was a good sign. Like that first ray of light in a desert sunrise. He was thinking. ""He doesn't speak Russian, for one. He knows...things about where I found him. He draws a military paycheck, but not one made of money.""   The man drank from the flask again, the reddish-gold liquid warming his bones. Apollo and Dionysus were closer in spirit and approach than people thought. Prometheus ought to know. If he had really known anything, though, he would have been looking in front of him. Would have told Kranz he wasn't going to get his hands dirty. Wouldn't be watching the watchers while the actors and directors played on stages millions of miles away. Fuckin' Washington. She had died consoling him. Still his fault. Watching the watchers was a penance of sorts.  ""So he's a soldier."" The boy grinned, pulling out his penknife and whittling a stick randomly.  ""Yup. Just like your guys Davy Crockett and Custer. And like Neil, Buzz, Mike, Jim, Jack and Fred.""  The boy looked thoughtful. ""But only Davy and Custer are real. The King of the Wild Frontier and a soldier who helped settle the West. My Apache friends from school say Custer's an asshole, though. An imp-er-i-alist."" He sounded out the word. A tragedy of history that he knew words like Sentinel the way a baby learns ""dada"" and yet he had to struggle to pronounce that at his age. Shouldn't even know it. A kid should be allowed to dream. He'll learn he's a monster soon enough. A brave one, hopefully. A good one. And the toughest one on the llano.  The man shook his head. ""Your friends are wrong. Well, they're right. But it happens to everyone. You can't stop the sun from setting. You can only watch the colors change as she goes down. Hope there's a halo around the moon. That's a sign of rain. Good crops. Strong boys.""  The child's face lit up. ""I'm strong."" Then he became thoughtful. ""Are there frontiers left, Dad? Like in the movies, where Apollo 13 went to space in...1970. That was before the Sentinel came. Why didn't something like that happen? Why didn't we go to the Moon? That's a good frontier.""  ""Once, son, I found myself asking the same questions. They were just as good then, when I was in the Air Force after Korea. I looked at the Jornada Del Muerto, you know...over in the Western part of the state...and I said...eighteen wagon trains went to Santa Fe, and came back with gold and treasure, dreams and hope. Why did the eighteenth have to be the last? And I might could have been the wagonmaster on it, if I had lived in those days. Why?""  ""Why, dad? It'd be cool as hell to live on the Moon.""  ""You've got a mouth on you. Can't say you learned it from anyone but me."" He chuckled. ""It would be. It would be. Nobody lives there anymore.""  ""There were people there? Like Indians?""  The man stood, looking into the afternoon sky. Rotating his head willfully and deliberately, but with effort, he looked the Sentinel in the eyes. Anger burned that his son was rarely allowed to see.  ""More like us. They had dreams of their own. Frontiers. They liked being Moon-Americans so much they decided to teach us Americans how to be Indians. I'm too old to learn. I don't like it.""  The boy looked up from his whittling project. ""Hm."" It appeared as if he was grappling with a problem he couldn't solve...and the problem was caused by his dad speaking gibberish. The older man had become used to that look. More from older folks, who remembered Apollo 18. They'd never admit to it...that's why he'd stopped bothering. ""So the Indians...they teach us how to survive, right? Teach us to plant, tell us stories...they always act like we're crazy. I always feel like I've forgotten something around them.""  ""The Indians have always felt that way. The older I get the more I understand. We've forgotten we were Indians once.""  The boy looked confused. ""Not cowboys?""  ""You know more Indian cowboys than you do white ones. Next time you watch your Apollo 13 video, you remember what they're like. You compare them to the way Tom Hanks plays Jim Lovell. You do some thinkin'. Real heroes are more like the cowboys and farmers you know than some science fiction character.""  ""Oh. But the movie heroes...they're what the robot's like! He's a badass! He saves us from the Russians and the Chinese! And helps us learn better!"" The boy thought. ""That's what the TV says, anyway. His cartoon show is real. Not like Apollo 13.""  The old man spat. Then he pulled out his own knife and absentmindedly began studying the blade. ""That's just...campfire stories. Tall tales. You know I raised you to love a good tall tale. But they all have a grain of truth.""  ""I know."" The boy's voice took on serious, somber tones. The way a child is when they're about to give their greatest secret to an adult.  ""Oh?"" The old man looked down at the boy proudly.  ""He's scared. He's not proud of what he did, who his friends were, what he thought was right a long time ago. But we're safe because of him. And that makes his life worth living so far away from his home on the Moon.""  The old man hadn't had a tear wet his eyes since he almost lost the left one. ""Damn, boy. Here I thought you were gonna say he was like your dear old dad. That seems so...simple and fairy-tale by comparison. You have wisdom beyond your years.""  The boy rolled his eyes. ""I'm not just a kid, dad. I'm smart as a whip, too. Teacher says so."" He paused, an impish gleam in his eye, then added...  ""But you're right. Old man.""  The man looked toward the Sentinel's eyes again. ""I understand. As a fellow man and a brother, I understand.""  ""I'm a man and a kid at the same time? How does that work?"" The boy's voice ended on a rising note. Question. Call. Both. Its own answer.  ""Well, I wasn't talking to you, but it seems to apply.""  ""You were! You couldn't have been talking to anyone else!""  ""The robot, actually. If I can be this honest with my son..."" -- the man paused, letting a weight fall from his shoulders -- ""my blood son...I can talk to him at least a little bit, can't I?""  ""He's nice. Scary, sad, but nice. I wish I could talk to him.""  Three hundred fifty feet tall. Just about as big as a Saturn V. From outer space. And he resonated with a little boy as much as a six-foot man with an armload of bad habits and a back forty full of regrets did. The next generation was in good hands. The man cleared his throat, then spoke. ""You will. Someday you'll understand what he's been saying all this time. And then you can go to his home on the Moon.""  ""But no one's ever done that before!""  ""Oh, how do you know? The important thing is, you dream of doing it. And you're not the first one to do that. Your mom and I, the friends I brought the Sentinel back with...we dreamed of it too. But most of all we dreamed of kids like you.""  ""You didn't dream very big."" The boy's tone was teasing. Witty banter came to him like a knife through soft butter that had been left outside too long.  ""No. I didn't. Turns out I didn't have to."" The sun was setting. There was going to be a halo around the Moon tonight."

As it turns out, a tear had formed in the fabric of their universe. Once stabilized they realize that the tear opens up into other universes and those sentinels are going to be necessary again."

If the sphere were very small the curvature would obviously be very extreme and you could see it if you looked towards what would be the horizon on earth.  However if you look up it's possible that the central star would outshine the oposite side of the sphere. I don't know how strong that effect would be. It probably also depends on how thick the atmosphere is within the sphere.
futureporn,2xnkdk,european_impostor,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:49:24 2015 UTC,"There is no night inside a Dyson sphere. Everything on the other side would be obscured by the blue sky and the sun.

futureporn,2xnkdk,Galdos,28,Mon Mar 2 11:27:45 2015 UTC,"Still doesn't quite convince me.. In the center of the Dyson sphere is a star. Okay, the habitat part can be between an inner and an outer shell.. but then the picture with it's curvature doesn't make sense. With the gravity of the star you'd be standing on the inner shell, not the outer one."
futureporn,2xnkdk,EnglishFellow,21,Mon Mar 2 11:32:41 2015 UTC,"Generally, when imagining Dyson spheres and ringworlds they are given a spin so that the centripetal force becomes equivalent to earth gravity. And this way you wouldn't need to be in between shells, you could be exposed to the vacuum of space as the same centripetal force would keep an atmosphere contained (like gravity does on earth). However, as someone said above, the curvature wouldn't look quite like that simply because of how massive a Dyson sphere would have to be, you might be able to make out the sphere bending inwards, but you certainly wouldn't be able to make out lakes and mountains. A ringworld however could look exactly like this."
futureporn,2xnkdk,Galdos,7,Mon Mar 2 11:49:57 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't a ringworld (assuming it is encompassing a star) have the same (or similar) curvature to a Dyson sphere?   But still, love the picture =]"
futureporn,2xnkdk,veltrop,11,Mon Mar 2 12:03:30 2015 UTC,"You're right, I meant smaller ringworlds that don't surround a star. In the culture series for example the 'orbitals' are only 3 million km in diameter, this is a deliberate constant as that diameter allows them to have a 'culture standard' day by the same spin mechanism that creates their 'gravity' (since they orbit a star like a planet does and are slightly titled towards it). With widths varying from one thousand to six thousand km, each orbital has between 20 and 120 times the surface area of earth (but with significantly less mass)."
futureporn,2xnkdk,Galdos,5,Mon Mar 2 13:26:32 2015 UTC,"But as it is a sphere, that centrifugal spin would create an inconsistent gravity gradient, with zero gravity at the axis.  That wouldn't be very practical, you'd have to live on a single strip along the center."
futureporn,2xnkdk,PhysicalStuff,4,Mon Mar 2 17:26:17 2015 UTC,Which is why in sci-fi ringworlds are generally depicted for habitation. Dyson spheres are mostly thought of as power plants. Then again you could combine the two and have all regions beyond the habitable ring just be solar panels. The low gravity uninhabitable regions would power the habitable regions.
futureporn,2xnkdk,soulslicer0,2,Mon Mar 2 17:33:58 2015 UTC,"I think the low-g regions could be purposed for several things other than power production. I can imagine that much industrial production could be more energy efficient in a low-g environment.  However, the effective gravity would not point directly outwards (downwards when standing on the inner surface) because the centrifugal acceleration would be at some obtuse angle to the direction of stellar gravity."
futureporn,2xnkdk,veltrop,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"If I flew my ship into a dyson sphere, how would i land? I assume the pull due to the star in the middle is being counter-acted by the centrifigual motion on the strip, so if we fly into some hole on the side, until we land we won't feel those effects right"
futureporn,2xnkdk,soulslicer0,3,Tue Mar 3 03:22:28 2015 UTC,"If you entered a door on the sphere, you'd have to orbit the sun inside to prevent falling into it.  The sphere would have to be rotating at least this fast to prevent people from falling in too.  So anyway you'd have to set up a tangential velocity to land on the surface of the sphere which would be similar to the orbit you'd need to set up to not fall into the star in the first place.  At least... that is the understanding I have after hundreds of hours of playing Kerbal Space Program..."

futureporn,2xnkdk,Galdos,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:50:06 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm not by any means a Physics expert; but wouldn't it be the centrifugal force that becomes equivalent to Earth gravity, since the centripetal force would here be the gravitational attraction between the Dyson star and the person/object in the sphere, as well as the normal force between the person/object and the surface of the inside of the sphere?"
futureporn,2xnkdk,_aex,2,Mon Mar 2 13:42:13 2015 UTC,"It's a common misconception, but no. Centrifugal force describes the tendency of an object in a circular motion to move away from the center (or stay moving in a straight line). In this sense, centrifugal force isn't a real force at all but rather, a property of inertia. Centripetal force is a force acting inwards, resisting the inertial tendency. In the ringworld example, the material the ring is made out of is exerting a force on you exactly equal to the centrifugal force. There isn't any 'real' force pushing you outwards, but rather a force pushing you inwards resisting the inertial movement you already had.   The concept might be difficult to grasp at first. The easy way to remember is that the only real force that ever exists in any example is the centripetal force. The centrifugal force is simply the tendency of an object to continue moving in a straight line."
futureporn,2xnkdk,Galdos,-2,Mon Mar 2 13:59:02 2015 UTC,The point is that the spin doesn't create a centripetal force. What becomes equivalent to Earth gravity is the inertia of the object.
futureporn,2xnkdk,Thomas_Henry_Rowaway,2,Mon Mar 2 14:01:09 2015 UTC,"Right, but the inertia of the object isn't a force, it is simply a property of motion. The real force is exerted by the ringworld, in resistance to the centrifugal inertia."
futureporn,2xnkdk,_aex,1 point,Mon Mar 2 14:16:14 2015 UTC,"The difference between forces we call ""real"" and those due to being in accelerating frames of motion is largely semantics in general relativity. In particular gravity is identical to those ""fictitious"" forces and has pretty much exact the same right to be called ""real"" as the centrifugal force.  This is basically because the definitions of real and fictitious forces in classical physics rely on the existence of inertial frames and in GR its impossible to define inertial frames in good way.  In the reference frame of someone on the ringworld the centrifugal force is as real as any other and the centripetal force is just the normal reaction that the ground has on your feet."

futureporn,2xnkdk,Kittenclysm,7,Tue Mar 3 04:50:45 2015 UTC,"In a Dyson sphere, would only the area near the rotating axis be inhabitable?     I would think that, since only that area can feel the centripetal force of the spin of the sphere, the majority of the land in the sphere would be essentially weightless, or would be at such a steep 'slope' that it would be hard to inhabit.  In any case, wouldn't the atmosphere collect along the perimeter around the spinning axis?  How could it possibly be otherwise, without some kind of antigravity?  Also, I would think a dysons sphere would be a very delicate system - much more so than a planetary one.  It would be prone to wobbles which might destabilize and possibly destroy it.  Also if it ever gets hit by a big enough asteroid or meteor, it could possibly be pierced, which would mean it would lose of all its atmosphere and everything inside would die if the hole into space were not closed.  I know - any civilization advanced enough to build a sphere like this would be able to account for these issues.   But it seems like one of the more unlikely future-civilization-fantasies to me."

futureporn,2wbfpu,kylco,3,Wed Feb 18 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"Actually,  I found it to be not nearly as bad as expected. It's better than whatever Michael Bay sequel we're going to get this year, and it pushed a lot of novel sci-fi trips subtly and in an accessible fasion. It even subverted some cliches I expected and while the acting was a bit hammy it was planar to watch. It's not Best Picture material, but it's been getting a lot of hate it doesn't deserve."
futureporn,2wbfpu,calculon000,2,Wed Feb 18 17:53:29 2015 UTC,"Like I said, it's far from Best Picture. But at the same time, nearly every movie romance can be seen coming a mile off just from the casting draft. The movie avoided the annoying ""[insert technical but hardly obtuse explanation]"" prompts the ""Huh? English please?"" response by letting her - and by extension, the audience, get on with things without dumbing it down or getting distracted by the unexplained space magic. And while the damsel-in-distress bit was a bit disappointing, it's not much different from any other science-fiction or action flick recently: at least she was the obvious protagonist, and showed a surprising amount of agency. There were a lot of subtle digs at how sci-fi normally treats women (like the running gag about letting herself get dressing in sensible, comfortable clothing that didn't look ridiculous) too, for that matter. And the ending didn't wind up with Mila Kunis, space princess, ordering her domineering in-laws around as body slaves, either: she did what she said she wanted to do, and got back to her old life for the most part.   It ignored a lot of the tired old formulas, and it's getting a lot of flak for it, and I think that's unfair, that's all. It has a lot of redeeming indicators for the science-fiction and action-adventure genres on the big screen, and I'd look forward to a sequel and to spiritual tips of the hat in future films."

futureporn,2umllj,ManchurianCandycane,22,Tue Feb 3 12:55:01 2015 UTC,I never understood the farming boner Asimov had. Vertical farms were just as effective. No need to tear down the city.  Farming is inefficient use of land.

futureporn,2umllj,w00t4me,7,Wed Feb 4 07:30:12 2015 UTC,It's more do do with the discovery of technology such as Ion Propulsion drives and anti-matter.   The whole time I was reading the scene with the Pill sized nuclear bomb i was thinking that it would be much better if they used anti mater.
futureporn,2umllj,Jigsus,6,Wed Feb 4 07:43:31 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I imagine antimatter would have been better. Keep in mind though that antihidrogen was discovered in 1995.  Altough Star Trek used antimatter before that...
futureporn,2umllj,w00t4me,3,Wed Feb 4 07:45:46 2015 UTC,"I know,The concept of Antimatter was first proposed by Paul Dirac in 1928, although they used the term Positrons at the time.   Plus in 30,000 years I'd imagine we'd make quite a few breakthroughs then. It just seems like tech peaked with discovering nuclear power in the books."
futureporn,2umllj,GuySalmon,2,Wed Feb 4 07:48:32 2015 UTC,"In the books, Asimov explains this as a side effect of the slow collapse of the Empire. For much longer than the few hundred years before the Interregnum there was very little advancement in most scientific fields.  Of course, what really is going on here is a sci-fi work extrapolating based on the best knowledge of the time. The books being written now will probably sound just as silly 50 years in the future.

The other books are rather regrettable, published decades after the originals and many by authors other than Asmiov himself. They get a bit hokey and include an attempt to roll the Foundation Trilogy and, more or less, all of Asimov's other works into a single universe.

The last two skip ahead to around the 500 year mark, and cover somewhere less than 10 years. I wish Asimov had gone further with it.

The very idea of the rest of the world aging as you stand frozen in time, slicing through the black void of space with little more than a hum from the massive vessel carrying you and your crew mates ever closer to your destination.

futureporn,2tu8ll,Man_with_the_Fedora,3,Wed Jan 28 04:28:55 2015 UTC,"See, this is why I don't understand the severe deficit of tanks in star wars. The ability to resist damage is less useful than the ability to not get hit. An orbiting spacecraft could feasably hit a target that size, and once you've reached the point that nearly anything can hit you, you can't win, because there's always a bigger gun, or at least a big enough gun.  A tank could reasonably fit more armor, a shield generator, a similarly sized weapon, and get more speed and mobility out of a package a fraction the size.  Hell, even after they got done loading it up with whatever weaponsystem comes to mind, it'd still be a load more efficient than this crap.  This is part of a larger rant I have about the general inefficiency of the empire. According to lore, they made it look intimidating over making it efficient, but that goes contrary to reason. In any case, efficiency is intimidating.  </rant>  Sorry, just had to get that out of my system."

It's foot thick evo-poly blend. That shit could take a direct hit from a rail cannon.""  The pilot rolled her eyes and tapped her foot impatiently. The mechanic sighed.  ""Just about all the coilgun armatures are slagged, had to replace every one of them. Speaking of things we had to replace, the fusion reactor. Completely breached containment. Your magnetic bottle was an inch from failure, which would have killed you. Shield generator, same thing. Overload coils blew about halfway through the fight. You probably noticed this as the flashing red light, siren, and warnings of you imminent demise. Not to mention the fact that you had no shields for half the battle.""  The pilot motioned for the mechanic to get on with it.  ""Right, uh, where were we. All the major joints were pretty much immobilized with mud. Those things are hermetically sealed for a reason, you know. Carapace was cracked in about a half a dozen places. You lost about half your coolant reserves. On our own planet, that alone would be a ten year environmental disaster.""  The mechanic sighed. ""And that's just the most major damage. There's about another thousand minor things, electrical faults, little mechanical failures, broken indicators pretty much everywhere. Swear to God, Cat, you're harder on these machines than any other pilot I've ever met. If you weren't also the best pilot I'd ever met, I'd start sending you the repair bill. It's just...enormous, I mean, really. Pretty much anyone else would just tell you it's beyond repair.""  The pilot laughed. ""That's why they pay you the big bucks, Jace. How long till I can get back into it?""  The mechanic paused. ""Full repair, refurbishment, and a little pine-shaped air freshener thrown in to boot? I can get her fixed in three or four more days. Try and take better care of her this time, okay? If its broken, it's broken, and you'll be stuck with an old Mark VII. And knowing you, it won't last ten minutes.""  An explosion rocked the repair bay, tearing cables from their mounts and toppling several of the repair crew. Somewhere distant, a siren began to wail.  The pilot stumbled and caught herself. ""What can you get me in five minutes?""  The mechanic picked himself up from the ground. ""Weapons, about 75 percent power, limited, and I mean limited shields.""  ""I'll take it. Five minutes.""  ""Yup. Go get suited up. We'll have her hot for you. Still on for dinner tonight?""  ""Wouldn't miss it,"" shouted the pilot as she turned and ran for her quarters. Another explosion, larger, rocked the facility. The massive suit of armor swayed on its feet.  ""Avery!"" roared the mechanic. ""You heard the lady! Fire this bitch up now! Get what we have fixed online. Skip the startup checks, it'll all show red anyway! I need you to disable the grav boot, lock joints 47 through 63, bypass the main coolant system and reroute to backup, and for the love of God, will somebody shut off that alarm!""  The mechanic bellowed at his crew as around them, the walls shook and crumbled, and the gargantuan suit came slowly back to life."

futureporn,2sef00,daphillenium,12,Wed Jan 14 17:22:47 2015 UTC,"Imagine a world, far into the future, where humans are colonizing other planets. We come across one planet that has these monolithic statues. Though they are made of metal. They never rust, and none of our technology is able to harm it or cut in to it. No mention of these statues is mentioned in any of the texts that we find, when digging up the planets old cities.  The civilians of this planet are long gone, leaving behind buried cities, and their statues.   One day as the humans are milling about on this new world, a meteor falls out of the sky, hitting the soil, ramming it up into a small mountain. When scientists are sent out to check it out, they are never heard from again. A squad of marines are sent to check it out and only one makes it back, her skin covered in weird marks and boils. She's clearly been infected, but by what.  As shes being transported to the main hospital of one of the more developed cities, one of the statues seems to awaken. It's eye blaze yellow, and it begins to stand, only to halt when the convoy has driven past it. A farmer's daughter notices this but doesn't know what to think.  10 years later, the planet is barely able to sustain life. The meteor that had landed 10 years ago had been carrying an alien life, a scourge. The humans had done all they could to fight against it, but everything had failed. At one of the strategic defense centers a loan woman walks in. She says she knows what the statues are. They are both the sword and the shield, to fight and defend against the alien threat. She's seen them awake, when the alien life form is near.  They begin researching her claims, find them to be valid, and a fast track learning course is put together, with her as the first test pilot. When she climbs into the statue that she saw stir for the first time, 10 years ago, she has a moment of hesitation. ""What is she doing?"", she thinks. But only briefly. The statue closes the hatch, and stands up, sheeting the sword on its back scabbard.   When it finishes standing and running a status check on all its joints and systems, a voice from within speaks to her. It says ""I have been waiting, we have been waiting. We weren't ready before, but we are ready now. Let us fight together."""

futureporn,2sef00,satisfyinghump,3,Thu Jan 15 02:01:00 2015 UTC,"When we lost the war, part of the treaty was disarmament. They took all our guns, our ships, most of our raw materials. Left the human race once more stranded on a single spent planet. Centuries of crawling our way skyward to end up once more at the bottom of a gravity well, staring at unfamiliar constellations, weeping for the stars we lost.   They were thorough, ruthless in scouring our adopted planet. There is not enough metal left on this entire rock to build the infrastructure necessary for so much as a suborbital rocket. They destroyed a race of toolmakers. And they left us. Scavengers.   They were thorough. But they were not perfect. There were only three Samson - class Defenders built, near the end of the decade-long war. They were meant to change the game, put us finally on an even footing. My grandfather was to be the first pilot.   They never saw combat. The war ended before they could be deployed, and when they disarmed the planet, they assumed the behemoth hulks were non-operational. I guess no one thought to tell them different. Too expensive and pointless to move, Project Samson stood as a monument to our sins.   Years passed. Two of the giant suits were dismantled. Broken into parts for scrap and sold off as part of our war reparations. But the last one we kept. A sort of macabre remembrance. A spark of unrealized hope.   There's few enough left that remember how to crack one open. Fewer who can repair the mountain - sized rail canon that is its right arm. Ever fewer still who can tear apart a fusion reactor and put it back together again. And only one who knows how to sit in the pilot seat. Me.   It took twenty years of working in secret to build the ultimate sucker punch. But now Samson hums with barely restrained power derived from the apocalyptic fusion of elemental hydrogen. He yearns to reach skyward with armored limbs, and fly on the plume of nuclear rockets.   In two months, they will be back for their war reparations. To gouge the metal from our souls. I know little of war and alien races. But of fire, steel, and human determination I know many things. And if our captors are mortal, they shall come to know them too.   In two months, Samson will rise. And we will reclaim our place in the galaxy with the thunder of our machines."

futureporn,2s37rt,TheJuicer305,14,Sun Jan 11 20:13:01 2015 UTC,"I like it, but I do want to say that a big mistake a lot of futurist artists make is inserting a lot of needless complexity into their artworks; like the designers of the future won't like clean lines and no clutter. I'm talking about needless clutter/complexity in things that people normally put a lot or work into, like a motorcycle. It takes a lot of effort and attention to make a motorcycle, so you'd expect the creator to attempt to make it look perfect, or at least good.   But it's reasonable to think there will still be complexity/clutter in things that people don't put a lot of effort and attention into, like their homes. There will still likely be bunches of clutter in peoples' homes, regardless of the level of our technology. We could have machines that wash and hang up our clothes for us after you throw them into a bin and human beings will still neglect to throw them into the bin as soon as they take them off. I'd like to see more realism in that regard.  Now, if it's a cheap motorcycle made with 3D-printed parts assembled by a makeshift mechanic? That's a whole other thing entirely. But so much of this futurist art seems to feature knobs, crevaces, and doohickies that don't seem to have any real function."
futureporn,2s37rt,cometparty,12,Sun Jan 11 22:19:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, take a look at these two ships.  The first one seems plausible, but the second one is too much scyfy-cluttered to be real."

futureporn,2s37rt,cometparty,6,Sun Jan 11 22:52:24 2015 UTC,"I like your examples, however I do think that the Y-Wing provides a good exception. A ship that isn't meant to fly in atmosphere doesn't need an aerodynamic shroud. And since it's very expensive to get mass up to space, it's unlikely that any unneeded panels won't be added to a ship build in orbit."
futureporn,2s37rt,nliausacmmv,8,Mon Jan 12 04:31:15 2015 UTC,"Funny thing, in-universe, Y-Wings were actually constructed with panels covering their components, having a much cleaner and smoother appearance. But the panels served no practical purpose, so the rebel technicians removed them for maintenance and never replaced them.  Edit: You actually mentioned this in another comment."
futureporn,2s37rt,Marbityr,1 point,Mon Jan 12 06:13:06 2015 UTC,It was also for speed - The armour on the Y-Wings made them too slow/maneuverable to be practical for fighting.

futureporn,2s37rt,theRIAA,3,Mon Jan 12 08:13:16 2015 UTC,"I would love to agree with you, but I have one sticking point. Since this is a police vehicle, it's clearly meant more for function and easy repairs than flash. A whole lot of smooth body panels with clips or hidden screws covering the frame would make it look better, sure, but it would also make it more difficult for police mechanics to fix. Additionally, its open design allows for better airflow through the engine's intake and radiator, and around the engine itself, as well as exposing the frame and backbone of the motorcycle as easy, structurally-secure mounting points for attachments and sensors.  Two examples that illustrate my point nicely are military Humvees and armored SWAT vehicles.  Yes, they're a bit smoother looking than the REK-R shown above, but they're still not ""perfect,"" as you mentioned you'd like to see. In this rendition, I see no ""needless complexity."" I see an autonomous vehicle that was built from parts that are structurally sound, but with weight-saving measures taken, has armor plating where it needs it (the front fairing. I assume that's where the computer(s) is/are), and overall looks very practical for a law enforcement vehicle.  Would I expect cleaner design out of a civilian model? Sure!

futureporn,2s37rt,Year3030,2,Mon Jan 12 02:18:59 2015 UTC,"That's actually one of my gripes with they bike. It doesn't have a seat or handlebars, it looks to have a visual sensor on the front and is likely meant to be self-operational. So why does the frame of the bike have the same contour as regular motorcycles? For example, This bike was shaped so that it could be ridden by a human, its got handlebars, a seat, and the general frame of a bike that could hold a rider. But the pictured bike only has one of those things.  Don't get me wrong, I really like the piece. Even with its cluttered exterior. But why does it have the same frame as a normal bike if it's meant to drive itself."
futureporn,2s37rt,senorrawr,1 point,Mon Jan 12 05:42:44 2015 UTC,Hmm well if it's autonomous the clutter aspect either:  1) Doesn't matter because a human doesn't have to ride it 2) I totally see your point and they should have just fabricated it to go in a tube sleeve or something.

futureporn,2rygtj,Mr_Lobster,2,Sun Jan 11 09:38:13 2015 UTC,"You actually have to be very careful not to fly out of the solar system. Suppose you want to go from Earth to Neptune, and your starting position is just outside of Earth's sphere of influence. Your orbital speed there is roughly 30km/s. You jump to Neptune, whose orbital speed is roughly 5km/s. So you go 25km/s too fast. Solar escape velocity at Neptupe is 7km/s. Without slowing down, you would thus be slung out to interstellar space very quickly. And if your goal is to reach Neptune, you're better off using conventional rockets. The only thing the albecurrie drive is going to safe here is time."
futureporn,2rygtj,sndrtj,3,Sun Jan 11 13:49:14 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is that it makes traveling to another solar system pretty ridiculous, since you'd end up there with a ridiculous relative velocity compared to the rest of the solar system."
futureporn,2rygtj,Xylord,3,Sat Jan 10 23:19:15 2015 UTC,"I would imagine for long voyages they would not warp all the way there. Maybe warp for a while, recalibrate, and then warp again. Then you wouldn't be as off-kilter when you get there. Hypothetically speaking."
futureporn,2rygtj,Duality_Calamity,3,Sat Jan 10 23:51:59 2015 UTC,"Or you could possibly use gravity assists to slow yourself down once you get there. Multiple ones even, if turning the drive on/off is easy. Just come out deep in the gravity well, flying away, let the gravity slow you down, then jump back down into the gravity well. Repeat as necessary."
futureporn,2rygtj,Mr_Lobster,1 point,Sun Jan 11 09:40:15 2015 UTC,"But you aren't accelerating so there would be no need to have gravity assisted braking. If you were going 100mph and then turned on the warp bubble and then turned it off you would still be going 100mph no matter how ""fast"" you went with the use of the warp bubble. You are warping space, not blazzing across it.  A crude example would be an ant on one side of a piece of paper that wants to go to the other side of the paper. He could scurry across it or the paper itself could fold and then make his trip seem instantaneous to the other side of the paper. The ant is not the Olympic racer of his colony, he was translated to the other side by the means of folding the paper somehow. Replace the ant with a warp ship and the 2D paper with 3D space and that is what is being proposed. Faster than light travel wouldn't actually be faster than light at all."
futureporn,2rygtj,Duality_Calamity,2,Sun Jan 11 10:10:21 2015 UTC,"Except the deal is, relative to your target planet, you're going pretty damn fast. Earth moves at around 17-45 km/s relative to Jupiter. You can add another couple km/s to that from orbital speed. The moment you turn on the warp drive, you could be moving 30 km/s relative to Jupiter, and when you exit the warp drive, you'll still be going 30 km/s relative to Jupiter. Only now you're a couple thousand km from it, rather than millions."
futureporn,2rygtj,Mr_Lobster,2,Sun Jan 11 10:16:38 2015 UTC,"KSP has a few mods that have straight up Alcubierre drives, or things that mimic it and run into this same problem. They're tricky to work right in even the best circumstances. Ideally you align your orbit around your current planet with your intended arrival planet to minimize the relative velocity change.   Basically this means no traveling to planets on the other side of the star, and trying to arrive at the same relative orbital angle (you -> planet -> parent star) is your best bet. Otherwise you either find yourself zooming off at an absurd speed or without enough velocity to keep orbit. Either you end up needing a significant and rapid burn to stabilize things in the Newtonian realm. No Star Trek warp-in-and-presto-in-orbit with these, even with the fancy Sci-Fi engines that come with the AL Drives."
futureporn,2rygtj,chaosratt,5,Sun Jan 11 01:16:28 2015 UTC,For any planet with an atmosphere you could probably do an aerobreak. If the relative velocity is high enough you probably want to encase yourself in an asteroid's worth of ablative material and learn to breathe liquid to survive the deceleration of course. Shouldn't be a big deal if you can scrap together all the crazy exotic matter for an AL drive to begin with...
futureporn,2rygtj,rubyruy,2,Sun Jan 11 02:10:04 2015 UTC,"That works when you can plan it well enough, but plans never work in KSP. Its frankly impossible to get a perfect jump from point A to whatever you determine to be Point B. It's not possible make course corrections mid way, other than dropping out of FTL, adjusting, then jumping back. And without any kind of guidance computer you're left to manually align as close as possible as you can to your target and press the ""go fast"" button, with your finger hovering over the ""OMFG STOP"" button as you approach the target point.   Also, aero braking only works if your stupendous extra velocity happens to point you in a direction that traverses the atmo, without impacting the ground, and is meaningless if your velocity takes you suborbital rather then an escape vector.   The best I've been able to use it so far is that by the time you advance along to unlock the AL drive, you also unlock the exotic propulsion systems that give you the thrust of a Saturn 5's F5, with the efficiency of a ion drive.  So, use the AL drive to get in the general area of where you want and then be ready to burn a absolutely stupid amount of delta-V when you arrive to finalize/stabilize orbit, but you're journey was ~20 min rather than ~2 years.  I'm sure with proper planing and waiting for that ""perfect"" window you can jump from one planet to another with minimal delta-v requirements, but this is KSP. MOAR BOOSTERS."

Just come out deep in the gravity well, flying away, let the gravity slow you down, then jump back down into the gravity well. Repeat as necessary.  Also, KOS or mechjeb, and a bit of planning, make jumps like this easy-peasy."
futureporn,2rygtj,Mr_Lobster,-2,Sun Jan 11 09:42:45 2015 UTC,"You would need to reverse ""thrust"" halfway* through your trip in order to slow down in time.  *probably some other distance but you get the idea  edit: I'm wrong apparently"
futureporn,2rygtj,LaboratoryOne,3,Sat Jan 10 18:21:57 2015 UTC,It's a warp drive. You aren't really accelerating to ftl speeds but warping space. You wouldn't need to decelerate halfway to the target. You just shut down the drive to return to relativistic speeds.
futureporn,2rygtj,ShibbyWhoKnew,1 point,Sun Jan 11 00:22:33 2015 UTC,Yeah but you're relative velocity would be super out of whack with the rest of the new system you're in.

Shit like this, obviously inefficient, overly complex, engineered-for-the-sake-of-engineering bullshit like this is a main reason why 'futurism' is not taken seriously.   The Android looks freaky and creepy, for starters. Its existence is more a reflection of a certain design aesthetic than an actual solution set.   There are far too many moving parts in that 'solution'. The bike should have direct torque transfer, the electric motors should be mounted in the damn wheels. Every hydraulic system, every joint, every moving part that energy travels through in this 'system' is resulting in unnecessary energy losses and inefficiencies.   The whole point of robots, to do more with less and to work more efficiently than their human counterparts, is defeated by a system that tries to make a robot look like people for no good reason.   This was designed by someone who should be doing animation for some future-based anime series, not designing actual machines for the real world. This is a waste of energy, parts, and technology to solve a simple problem in an overly complex way. This machine is complicated just for the sake of being complex."

futureporn,2q81eo,BecauseVideoGames,37,Tue Jan 6 23:48:26 2015 UTC,I absolutely love this... except for the use of space shuttles.
futureporn,2q81eo,Cucumber52,50,Tue Dec 23 23:43:40 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry. Intakes on a non-atmospheric craft, asymmetrical thrust line that would leave this ship tumbling, visible mach diamonds in non-atmospheric thrust... and even an apparent docking maneuver under thrust, and you take issue with the use of a general purpose cargo and utility shuttle with a familiar form factor?  Meh. To each their own I suppose."
futureporn,2q81eo,ConnectionIssues,11,Wed Dec 24 01:20:29 2014 UTC,"It's about suspension of disbelief. Just because the design of the spaceship and the situation is not realistic, doesn't meant that anything goes."
futureporn,2q81eo,CannedBullet,3,Wed Dec 24 02:34:45 2014 UTC,So what are mach diamonds and thrustlines?
futureporn,2q81eo,fwork,11,Wed Dec 24 09:03:47 2014 UTC,"Mach Diamonds are standing waves in supersonic exhaust plumes. They happen because the air around the exhaust compresses (or expands) the plume, setting up zones with abrupt density changes. With no air around the plume, you get no mach diamonds.   As for thrust lines, it's just the line from the thrust source to the center of mass. Take your phone or something and put it on a flat surface, and try to push it by pushing it off-center. instead of moving across, it rotates. Do the same with your finger centered, and it'll move without much rotation.   Basically this ship should tilt its nose downward every time it fires the engine (unless the top part is very heavy (well, massive) and the bottom cargo part is very light, although that makes very little sense. You want your ship to mass as little as possible so you can move more cargo for the same amount of fuel."
futureporn,2q81eo,superecnate,3,Wed Dec 24 09:59:05 2014 UTC,"The ship part could certainly be more dense and heavy than the cargo part, since the cargo part only has to be built to survive one trip but the ship itself would be designed to last much longer. The problem here is that a cargo ship must be able to travel just as well without a cargo load as with one, and having the cargo mounted asymmetrically around the center of mass is a big problem."
futureporn,2q81eo,jsims281,1 point,Wed Dec 24 14:12:24 2014 UTC,"My thoughts are that those engines could quite feasibly be heavier than the cargo in the front (not ideal, but we have no idea what sort of technology we're talking about here), which would balance the centre of mass out ok, would it not?"
futureporn,2q81eo,SpaceMun,1 point,Wed Dec 24 12:09:25 2014 UTC,Maybe the thrusters are at an angle? I don't know how well that would worj
futureporn,2q81eo,fwork,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:03:29 2015 UTC,"I don't believe they are, or the plume we see would be going at an angle too."
futureporn,2q81eo,ConnectionIssues,3,Sun Mar 22 04:10:53 2015 UTC,"Imagine a rocket engine. A perfectly designed engine pushing itself would travel along a straight line. This line is the center of thrust, or thrust line.   Now imagine a point which defines the 'center' of the ship... not by dimensions, but by mass. You may be familiar with the center of mass. Ideally, for forward motion, the thrust line runs as close to the center of mass as possible. Any deviation from that ideal will cause the engine to impart rotation rather than linear movement.   If you look at this ship, the engines are almost entirely located above the center line of the ship. Unless that massive cargo protrusion on the bottom of the ship is very light, and empty, and that top part is very heavy, this ship has a LOT of mass off-center from the line of thrust. The engines would thus be constantly trying to turn the ship. .. in this case, wanting to nose the ship down.  There are instances where off - center thrust becomes useful, but most of them involve counteracting other forces like drag and lift.   Mach diamonds are the visible spots of light in the exhaust of the engines. I forget exactly what causes them, but I think it's something to do with the collapse of the exhaust gasses due to ambient air pressure. In any case, they're a product of high-velocity exhaust in atmosphere and bear little resemblance to exhaust in vacuum."

It's more likely a support anti-infantry vehicle based on the dual short barrels. Most of the legged armored vehicle concepts I see have wheels in the feet. The legs are advantageous for terrain that would impede even modern MBTs. Based on the heavy turret armor I think it would ""deploy"" like a mobile tower to secure an area. The size of the turret machine gun indicates that this would be vulnerable to low flying aircraft, possibly because it is stationary often."

futureporn,2mdec3,Rob_T_Firefly,7,Sat Nov 15 14:17:39 2014 UTC,The ship had to be built in space. The Galaxy class is not capable of landing on planets due to its size. Only the entrepid and nova class are able to land and that's because they are about half the size of the Galaxy class.

As opposed to the article on the Constitution Class starships   Constitution-class vessels were able to break orbit and enter a Class M planet's upper atmosphere (and maintain altitude control while passing through it) for a limited period of time, conditional on the ship's ability to re-achieve escape velocity.

At this shipyard, the Enterprise might have a huge amount of assistance. It could be built under intense structural integrity fields provided by the yard. It could be lifted to orbit by tractor-beam tugs instead of having to achieve it itself. It's even conceivable that the ship could be built under zero gravity on the surface, considering how comfortable Starfleet is with artificial gravity."
futureporn,2mdec3,LordNephets,1 point,Sat Nov 15 22:03:37 2014 UTC,"I never got into Star Trek, but common Sci-fi tropes include things like going through wormholes, barely escaping the gravity of a black hole, and phasing through alternate universes and nebulas that send parts of your ship through time and space without the rest.

Given he was not a Star Trek fan, I think he tried to create an action movie instead, which I suppose he was successful in creating. Both movies were not true to Star Trek, and IMO, were instead created with the hope that Abrams would get more money from a generic action movie rather than a movie appealing to a smaller subset of people.  Also, Benedict Cumberbatch's face creeps me out."
futureporn,2mdec3,frogger2504,3,Sun Nov 16 10:46:38 2014 UTC,"See, believe it or not, but saying ""Abrams"" over and over actually makes your comment as a whole seem weaker, because it looks like you have both a bias against the director and instantly hate anything he does without judging it objectively, and it also makes it look like you're struggling to think up points, so fill it out by repeating the same one, thinking it strengthens that one point.   Directed by someone who admits he doesn't like Star Trek   This means literally nothing if it's still a good movie.   Angsty emo Spock   Subjective.

Not a legitimate point. I'm not even sure what you're trying to say here.    It's dumbed down for the Star Wars audience. Honestly, I'm not surprised you didn't understand; you seem like that movie's target audience.   Care to expand?

Please expand.   Destroying canon: Massively changing the past == TNG, DS9, VOY never happened as the universe will be changed now.  Dumbing down: It's not intellectual, it's a weak action movie with Star Trek scrawled on the top and stuff renamed to vaguely correspond to locations/characters. Ironically, if it had original species, characters, ships and locations I'd consider it a weak but watchable in a 'laugh at' way diversion.   This doesn't make it a bad movie.

I really don't think they did act that way at all... I thought it was pretty obvious.   Abrams did, at least. Still, not surprised, I guess.  Oh, and why was the first movie's villain basically not a Romulan at all? It's almost as if Abrams watched Nemesis while drunk and thought Shinzon was a Romulan.  PS.

The smallest bolt flying at 18,000 mph can be disastrous. If energy shielding is expensive on private shuttles and cargo trans, then shielded or deflector armed highways could be setup that create holes through this debris. This way shuttles can travel from planetside to a larger orbital launch station in a geosynchronous LEO.   At least, I'm assuming those shuttles are going to a station, between planets would make NO sense whatsoever. It would take more material and resources than probably exist on any single planet. And if you did, the distance changes radically throughout the local year.  My two cents at any rate."

Art sucks if you don't use tricks to emphasis and amplify emotions, well it doesn't suck, there was  a whole artistic movement about realism. The mask allows the villain to be more menacing, but it also makes us feel like this woman is at a major disadvantage, increasing the effect. Ie, people are captivated by emotion in art, fear and despair are important ones at that. I'm bugged by it too, sometimes, but you have to remember that this is just a scene not a novel - we don't know what the context was.   Although I'm failing miserably at understanding how the idea of people dying due to their faults is a negative. Or how that makes it hagiographical."

You don't need to use cheap tricks to make emotions real. No one likes being manipulated crassly into feeling something.   If you're setting a scene where a woman is holding a baby in the middle of a biohazard situation running away from an ax murderer, gimme some context as to why she's out there without any protection for her or her baby--not leave it as a given."
futureporn,2l5j4m,Ludwig_van_Whiskers,1 point,Tue Nov 4 00:31:31 2014 UTC,"I mean, I wouldn't call it a cheap trick, it's a trope that has existed since storytelling itself and is found in some of the greatest works whether it be in film, writing, or art. And the lack of context allows the viewer to think about the painting more (paintings are like snapshots of stories rather than full blown and organized stories themselves, wouldn't you think that it's often the lack of context that makes the work some much more interesting/thought provoking?). Don't get me wrong, I agree, it is a little too unrealistic for me, but as much as the sidebar likes to believe, there is no ""believable view"" as we're all almost certainly wrong.   I agree with you though, it would be nice to see some more creative ways to manipulate my feelings, but alas it is /r/futureporn - where we come to see futuristic shit."

Likely the mask has something to do more with the 'seeker' than it does the environment. Further, the guy is dressed completely differently than the woman and he's using an ax in a time where there are probably better weapons. Personally, all this makes me feel like there isn't an environmental hazard besides the freezing air and some lunatic taking his twisted advantage over some sort of mini-apocalypse.  I also want to say that the masked man is a take on the Fahrenheit 451, but instead of burning books they burn life forms (which is why he would be after the woman, the baby, and whatever biological material is in the container), but I think I'm wrong on that one."

The uniform and the mask also gives the army wearing it a feeling of timelessness.  The mask doesn't age.  A new wearer, every day.  It's futile to resist as they will put someone new up against you the individual forever.   You age, they don't.  That is very powerful."

""Launch""   one simple word, frantically sent from below.   a multitude of codes and passwords flooded the monitors as I went through my motions  But I couldn't bring myself to turn the key.  I couldn't press the button  I could not end them in a flash of light and shattered atoms  Day after day, week after week, I had watched over the peoples below.   Who am I to make the call? To kill...  I came to realize, I had a choice.   I could show mercy.  I could save them.  It wasn't until afterwards, standing out on the launch deck  watching the fruits of the others blooming like wretched flowers across the surface.   I realized something...  I didn't save those people.   I damned them.   I had taken away the one mercy I could have given.   I took away the instant, painless release I had the power to give  And here I stand, like an impotent god.   not one of mercy and love.  but one of despair."

Other than that, you're just as out of luck as we are. Therefore go watch RaXephon and then Neon Genesis Evangelion and wait for the end of the world as we know it.  Also, anyone seen GitS Arise yet?  Oh, and ... naturally, after movies and anime got depleted, and after you read William Gibson's Neuromancer series, and the Takesi Kovacs books by Richard Morgan, pick up these."

futureporn,2ir99w,ethan_kahn,12,Thu Oct 9 13:26:36 2014 UTC,"EZ Link: /r/ImaginaryWarships   some words from this artist (Robert Chew) about this piece:  Journal entry from Michael Douglas, crewman aboard the Global Petrol supertanker Atlas en route to the Port of Mumbai. Port of Departure: Valdez, Alaska USA. January 6th, 2256.  We saw them today. At around noon off the port side bow. Two great shapes rising and falling through the waves. Great streams of water jetting out from their “heads” as they breached the surface and sank below again. The Atlas's hull cameras confirmed that they were indeed the Marut class drones we were promised as our escort.   Fearsome looking things. Images of Moby Dick are all I can think about when I see them. Even Captain Ahab wouldn't dare cross one of these. Though I am relieved that they'll be our escort across the Pacific, part of me still has a hard time accepting the fact that they are fully armed and fully autonomous. Aside from their orders and parameters they act on their own accord!   It's also a wonder that these two that are escorting us are part of the Indian Navy. What happened to American might?  The world is pretty backwards right now. America is a third rate country, the global energy crisis is only getting worse, pirates steal oil on the open water with impunity, and I'm currently being escorted by two artificial attack whales from India! Maybe I should hop off on one those tiny islands we'll be passing. Build myself a shack and let the world pass me by. Sounds kinda nice.    Marut class maritime assault drone.  The largest drones constructed, Marut class drones represent the pinnacle of organic drone design. Modeled after the largest toothed predators on the planet, the Sperm Whale, they act as formidable guardians of the sea. The body is composed of thousands of kilometers of artificial muscle fibers layered on top of a sturdy skeletal structure. The onboard AI supercomputer is housed deep in the midsection of the body, while power supplies are spread throughout. A small missile array is located behind the upper headpiece. Torpedo tubes and a large naval ram are located on the front of the head."

futureporn,2ikiz4,jojojoy,-3,Wed Oct 8 01:09:22 2014 UTC,Did you see the movie? They were aliens that seeded life (including humans) throughout the galaxy.
futureporn,2ikiz4,Chaos_Philosopher,-2,Wed Oct 8 01:11:42 2014 UTC,"Yes, they seeded us on this planet. Thus making them us and us them. Ergo if we are human, they are human.  Bloody nice on down voting me for asking a simple bloody question."
futureporn,2ikiz4,jojojoy,-1,Wed Oct 8 01:13:46 2014 UTC,That doesn't make sense.  We're not the same as our biological ancestors (in a species sense) even though we're descended from them. At what point do species on our family tree stop being human?
futureporn,2ikiz4,Chaos_Philosopher,5,Wed Oct 8 01:21:54 2014 UTC,"L-o-l  No. Not tree. We're not supposedly directly descended from them. If that were the case there'd be an animal of this form throughout the fossil record.  No. Instead they set up a system where the end result would be us. A real time genetic calculation that reruns the value of human and operates on a suitable planet. They set up the dominoes, or billiards if you like, so that in several hundreds of millions of years the end result would be the emergence of the DNA, an animal of this form.  This is like the, you know, recurring underlying theme of the whole movie. The xenomorphs are developed the same way: a snakey thing that injects a virus which makes the organism into a thing that starts a life cycle. Hell, if the engineers were even half as smart as modern engineering design they'd have it that the ""payload weaponised organism,"" that is the first xenomorphs, take their epigenic queues from the original host organism. Then you've got a self replicating bioweapon that is suited to the environment and biology of the original host."

The incredible detail in the suits compared to that... kind of ruins it in a weird way. Also, I don't understand the choice of the wood texture. And where is the left hand of the front person going?

It's a completly different technique from what you have in a game engine. And it takes at least a few minutes to get a frame like this. Probably much longer.

futureporn,2ha73f,_Madison_,2,Thu Sep 25 00:28:39 2014 UTC,"I think what you're seeing straight in the center there is the actual ""engine"" part, but not the exit of the thruster points. Star Citizen applies physics to each individual thruster. So, loose an engine, and your ship is flying funky, they have to build the ships to balance out, or else they won't fly right."

futureporn,2ha73f,ElCiervo,1 point,Wed Sep 24 20:12:21 2014 UTC,"well if not for atmospheric flight I would expect most ships to be ugly and end up looking like the space station, external tanks, radiators antenas everywhich way.   If it still has to have atmospheric capability then it would end up looking like a rocket or existing airplanes.  obviously in a video game most people don't want to fly giant cubes or the space station. All the ships in star wars look cool even if they never needed atmospheric capability and none of them generated aerodynamic lift."
futureporn,2ha73f,dan4daniel,1 point,Thu Sep 25 00:32:57 2014 UTC,"I don't think they'd look like space stations though. ISS is built to stay in orbit. A space ship would need some structural integrity, because it has to withstand enormous accelerations and in a warfare scenario also require some sort of armour or shielding. I imagine single spherical and barrel-ish shapes (rockets) to be most realistic, or of course a mixture of both (longened egg shape)."

There is a page here that includes a smaller and a modified image, but has information on this amazing piece of work!   For some scale, this mural is a staggering 19 feet by 60 feet! It is huge!  Robert McCall spent 3 months on this project planning and developing the artwork, and spent another 6 months on the actual process of painting the mural that was featured near the exit of the ""Future Worlds"" exhibit in Disney's Epcot Center, the exhibit which sadly closed in 1999.   Some interesting notes from the webpage:  According to the artist, Bob McCall, the mural represents the ""flow of civilized man from the past into the present and toward the future.""  Additionally, McCall painted himself and his family into the Horizons mural. On the hill holding hands are their daughter Linda along with her husband, children, and dog. Just in front of them are McCall and his wife, Louise. Below the Washington Monument lifting her child in the air is their daughter Cathy and her husband."

I think if the membranes were self healing, light weight, and very strong it would be possible- carbon fiber on crack. Maybe aerogel?  I guess helium is a bad choice as it's supposedly dwindling in quantity.  But why not build the thing out of ultra-thin membranes of something, and just have them be vacuums?  It's totally possible, but unless they had extremely redundant systems (parachutes, or bouyant back up systems) they'd be rife for disaster. An air-to-air collisions, meteorites, etc could take them down.  But if you could solve those issues, they would be INSANELY efficient. You could cover the thing in solar panels and fly it Europe for virtually no cost."

futureporn,2f9e41,TessHM,3,Wed Sep 3 00:02:20 2014 UTC,"Problem being is that our view of the future and what typically happens are two different things. Sure we got cell phones right, we got other things right, but even in eighty years span of time, which is a short time span, we discover so much, so much changes and improves. Use 2014 as an example, in 1934 if you told someone about all the different shit now a days, they simply wouldn't believe a damn word you said. The internet, flatscreen high def tvs, computers, laptops, tablets, cars able to travel as fast as they are now, wifi, video games, etc, etc, etc. It's hard to talk about realistic futures and have someone discredit it in my opinion, because it isn't something you can predict.  So when he says he doesn't want to talk physics in regards to this, I see no reason he should have to in regards to this blimp thing because it could be something beyond our understanding and grasp right now holding this blimp up."

THings like reactor components and such that are so big they are hard to move overland especially in developing countries. Issue is you still need hundreds of millions upfront to develop them and the market is unproven so there hasn't been enough investors.    The idea of a LTA cruise ship is proposed from time to time too, but again the market is not proven and for any reasonable total lift weight they would probably only be able to carry a few hundred people at most and would thus be only in the budget of the mega rich.    The technology is prooven but there's just not a lot of money in LTA ships and their biggest concern is severe weather."

A dirigible with the same gas volume as the Hindenburg could lift approximately 215 metric tons if using hydrogen and 190 metric tons if using helium.  The weight of the water alone as shown in the picture, if we assume it's an olympic-size swimming pool (could be less but it's looks pretty big) is 10 times the maximum lifting capacity of the largest airship ever built.

futureporn,2ehqhh,alexconnorbrown,5,Mon Aug 25 01:45:31 2014 UTC,Everything by Alex Ries/Abiogenesis is exceptional. Especially stuff from his Birrin universe (like this)
futureporn,2ehqhh,DrPantaleon,6,Mon Aug 25 11:31:57 2014 UTC,"The story that goes with this is pretty neat and compelling too.   Born in an age of exceptional technological complexity and profligate resource exploitation, Spear was the first birrin attempt to send a vehicle of any kind to another solar system. Powered by nuclear fusion and cooled by banks of enormous radiators, the intelligent and self-sufficient machine even now represents the most costly and complex undertaking of any birrin age.  The extraordinary expense of the vehicle’s development was shouldered by a multi-national interhouse consortium so extensive that organisations from every continent found themselves contributing. Components were shipped and flown from all over the world to the equator, from where thunderous nuclear rockets catapulted them into orbit.  After half a century Spear, finally complete, undertook a long range shakedown tour of the solar system, flying deep into the realm of the outer planets.  As it slowly returned in-system, however, the scale of the exponentially ascending birrin civilisation began to terminally overtax the planet. Crop failures, famines and coastal flooding lead to regional wars and ethnic cleansing on a scale never before seen, and what little food remained was sequestered by the most able houses.  Meanwhile Spear, all this time arcing closer to home, was supposed to be captured, fueled, and sent on its mission to a nearby star.  As the recovery team prepared to leave orbit, a coalition of minor houses left starving by the major powers launched a salvo of warheads. Bursting into clouds of metal spheres, they tore through the delicate vehicles and their crews at orbital speeds. As Spear fell past uncaptured, the response by the wealthy stakeholders was swift: Invading with full force, the punitive occupation quickly became culling, and birrin society rapidly degenerated into a war so total civilisation would not recover to a semblance of its former complexity for over a thousand years.  Through all this, Spear, pocked by minor impacts and long silent, swung through space in its vast and ever changing ellipse.  Now, with the dawn of a new era of birrin civilisation, Spear is returning once more to the inner system. The powers that be will have decide whether it should be refit and sent on its long delayed mission, or simply stripped for the few valuable parts and cast into the sun.  Seen here is the vehicle undergoing low-orbit trials soon after its completion, pre-fall birrin society still burgeoning beneath."

They act as a quicker reaction and deterrent to those who'd use anti-armor/tank weapons against their ""big guns"".  I'd also imagine that the thinner legs are part of a deterrent to weapon-fire. Anti-armor weapons tend to be notoriously hard to aim, for instance. Additionally, this patrol seems to be in a slum or similar (Favala, Brazil?). In areas like this, against a force this powerful, improvised explosive devices and mines would be the primary method of response. The thin legs and elevation of the machines would help mitigate any explosions that may occur under them."

I honestly burst out laughing when I saw it with only 3 eyes, stupid idea.   Agreed. I like the fan idea that gets tossed around about remixing the order of the games.   Mass effect 2 becomes mass effect 1. Humans colonies are mysteriously vanishing and no one is doing anything about it forcing you to work with a terrorist organization to get anything done. The end of the game has you finding humans being harvested, but it really just raises more questions than answers.   Mass effect 1 is now mass effect 2.The geth have some funky new dreadnought and you see a connection to the collectors where others dismiss it, etc, etc.   Mass effect 3 stays in place.   Basically, it just feels very odd that you have all these eldritch beings and build up in mass effect 1 and then an entire game (ME2) where you basically fight mooks of little importance and the central plot just sort of mills about wondering when it's going to get moving again."

The style can be a bit odd, and perhaps not to everyone's tastes, but it's a pretty good way of showing how modern clothing can be made to look futuristic and not feel out of place.

They're made for asian builds, they are made of VERY cheap fabric. The zipper feels like it will tear off any second, the seams are pretty shitty, and the cloth that it's made of it'self is VERY thin and does nothing for weather, so obviously it's made just for looks and not functionality. Feels like it will tear any second. Haven't worn more than twice and I'm afraid to put it on a third.  Just to be clear though, it only cost me $20, so that may be it.

In addition to that, the big ones on ships suffer horrendous wear and tear on the rails with every firing which means frequently repairing/replacing the rails if they're in use.   They definitely have potential, but it might also turn out that they don't scale down well enough to justify moving away from gunpowder."
futureporn,2cjlsz,Burns_Cacti,1 point,Tue Aug 5 10:32:27 2014 UTC,"We really don't know any of the materials involved in this picture. There's nothing that indicates superior protection aside from flashbang/hearing protection and some increased resistance to shrapnel.  The main thing that jumps out is that someone in this could carry more gear longer and maybe be stronger. Perhaps be a bit more gunfire resistant by virtue of having some mechanical bits that the bullet needs to travel through to get to him, but the materials involved aren't necessarily any better than modern ceramics.   I could definitely see a jump from 556 to 762 assuming you were actually expecting to be in combat with equally equipped opponents, but 556 will definitely still do the job for what he's wearing, it'll just take more rounds on average."

As are the armature pieces on his upper arm and forearm. The left and right leg pieces are mirrored and skewed, which really distorts the appearance of the one on the right.  It's very distracting when you start looking at individual pieces and try to figure out which direction the light is coming from, since the highlights and shadows on each piece would indicate completely different light sources.  There are also a lot of hard edges that the artist could have feathered to make the different items blend together and look like they're all part of the same image.

futureporn,2bwc70,Cyberogue,6,Mon Jul 28 03:21:14 2014 UTC,"It's not the best sword ever made. Even the japanese used it as a last ressort weapon. There's this huge myth surrounding the weapon but in reality it was a weapon, that most soldiers didn't use. It was only viable wielded by a master swordsman. Not exactly the most effective weapon."
futureporn,2bwc70,Zushii,6,Mon Jul 28 16:11:02 2014 UTC,"It's not a bad sword...it's just not as legendary as people claim. It's mostly because it simply looks really cool, and has a lot of myth around it. It's like the revolver; there are better guns, yes, but few that make as good of an image."
futureporn,2bwc70,CoffeeAndKarma,1 point,Mon Jul 28 17:20:35 2014 UTC,"I thought people usually chooses the katana because of its curved edge which makes it a very good slashing weapon.  But history aside, if the katana was made with modern and stronger metal, would it have an edge against swords with similar modern still aswell?"
futureporn,2bwc70,ScarfacedTyrant,6,Mon Jul 28 17:32:07 2014 UTC,"It's really not curved that much. If you want a curved edge, grab a shamshir. Now THOSE could really slash violently.    Metallurgy aside, I would think the katana would have a huge disadvantage compared to traditional european swords. European style swords are better balanced due to the heavier pommel so they can be turned mid-swing more easily. In addition, the pommel could be used as a bludgeon (and was used as one) whereas katanas don't have much of one, and they have a more sizable guard which can catch swords and protect the hand.   In addition since there was a lot more variety there were many special purpose features and sword styles. For example, since half-swording was common (Grabbing the blade with your other hand to thrust precisely), many swords had an unsharpened section (aka ricasso) for grabbing which allowed precision and better control, since the lower section of the blade doesn't do much cutting anyways. You also had things like the estoc and rapier which were more for thrusting so they were slim and rigid, or wider blades which were more for hacking. If we're including all European blades, not just the traditional style, you also have the saber and cutlass if you want something more suitable for slashing (pirates like the cutlass since it was small and easy to use on a ship)  Edit: I should note this is just my opinion, Katanas are great in their own right"
futureporn,2bwc70,Cyberogue,2,Mon Jul 28 18:14:38 2014 UTC,That shamshir looks brutal.
futureporn,2bwc70,SelcouthBadger,1 point,Mon Jul 28 19:42:09 2014 UTC,Don't people use that to cut people's heads off?
futureporn,2bwc70,ScarfacedTyrant,0,Mon Jul 28 18:16:17 2014 UTC,"Potentially. The main thing is that unlike most swords, katanas were less mass-produced, due to the extensive folding used in the process of making one. This meant that they were, on average, probably of a higher quality. Just like how a hand made vase tends to be nicer than a normal one."
futureporn,2bwc70,CoffeeAndKarma,2,Mon Jul 28 18:17:10 2014 UTC,"they were, on average, probably of a higher quality.   From what I read the Japanese used folding as a means of 'averaging out' impurities in the metal so you didn't have any one weak failure point. European smiths didn't do this because their metal was basically just better so they didn't need to."

Just slap some collision avoidance AI into your vehicle's computer, and you're good to go!"
futureporn,2ac042,chronoflect,5,Fri Jul 11 00:32:38 2014 UTC,"I don't think you understand how much energy is needed to change a course of 10-ton vehicle flying at a 100 km/h when all you've got is half a second. Also, simple predictability can do a lot for efficiency. Ever seen the chaos on the streets when a traffic light is out?"
futureporn,2ac042,im14,3,Fri Jul 11 05:13:17 2014 UTC,"You wouldn't need to correct that often if the collision avoidance sensors had a large enough range, or if all flying vehicles were externally coordinated as is the case with passenger aircraft.   Predictability and efficiency are goals of airborne travel as much as land travel, but the real advantage of airborne travel is the ability to travel unimpeded in a very fast, relatively straight trajectory (especially when compared to city driving, but this holds for much highway driving as well). Unlike terrestrial traffic, which requires these lanes and orderliness because it only has two dimensions of movement, air traffic can move freely in three dimensions, and that (combined with its speed) is its biggest advantage. Why wouldn't flying cars use the advantage that planes do?  Plus, let's be honest here.... this is way 'future tech' stuff. If we assume that the world depicted in this image is possible at all (and it being highly urban, enormous skyscrapers, tons of flying vehicles), I think it's safe to say it represents a serious departure from current technology, and enters the speculative realm. So if we've 'why notted' this whole world into existence, in other words, why not 'why not' it some more?  But I've never understood the neat-and-orderly-lanes model for flying cars either haha."

futureporn,2ac042,sto-ifics42,1 point,Tue Jul 15 02:39:26 2014 UTC,There will still be some sort of workday rush hour. If an urban area is congested enough lanes would probably form normally as traffic moves from one congested area to another. May even be more efficient that way.
futureporn,2ac042,starrseer,1 point,Mon Jul 28 13:09:10 2014 UTC,"Why do you think there will still be some sort of workday rush hour? We're talking about a full-scale future civilization here. Could be they've moved beyond the standard workday or workweek to something that specifically mitigates 'rush hour' time-specific-congestion. I mean they've clearly redesigned a new city to accommodate vertical traffic, so I see no reason why they wouldn't tackle one of the biggest issues with travel in urban areas.   I would think that avoiding congestion and getting all individuals to their desired locations as quickly as possible would be the desired 'efficiency' of a traffic system like this. If moving people in orderly lanes works better, then I think that mass public transportation would be much, much more efficient than having a bunch of individual cars and keeping modern day traffic phenomena around. Think about modern day planes, for instance. Airplanes don't orderly line up in the air upon leaving the airport and stay that way until they hit their ""exit"". It's much more efficient to just have them all go on their own little paths to their own little hubs since that's an available option now."

futureporn,29k259,nawitus,2,Tue Jul 1 16:37:31 2014 UTC,Why make a car that's pretty much unusable anywhere other than a flat desert?   To break records.
futureporn,29k259,Galwa,1 point,Tue Jul 1 17:35:14 2014 UTC,"1) It's designed to break the land speed record. The pursuit of speed needs a narrow focus vehicle.  2) LAND speed record. If it takes off, it is no longer a land vehicle. Also, breaking records is a dangerous profession. Safety is not guaranteed and these men and women know that.  3) Because firing the rocket from the start would be inefficient and could kill the driver. The piston engine cycles it up to a safer speed for the jet, which becomes inefficient at several hundred mp/h so the rocket takes over to push it to the 1000 milestone."
futureporn,29k259,tatch,1 point,Tue Jul 1 18:56:03 2014 UTC,"The V8 piston engine is there to pump fuel for the rocket engine, it has no way of accelerating the car as the wheels aren't driven."

You need a full column of air going up tens of thousands of feet.  Also they had trouble with waste-products building up & overwhelming them.   But it still looks interesting from a sci-fi point of view.    Maybe that glass sphere has vents somewhere."
futureporn,29bv56,snarkhunter,2,Sun Jun 29 01:26:48 2014 UTC,I think the fact that all of that happened and BioDome 2 failed at stasis so fantastically and dramatically was a rather significant and demonstrative result in and of itself.
futureporn,29bv56,ichneumon,1 point,Sun Jun 29 06:21:44 2014 UTC,I would be very interested to see the citation for needing a full air column for ecosystem stability.
futureporn,29bv56,TommBomBadil,1 point,Sun Jun 29 06:39:16 2014 UTC,I have no reference.  I only have the proof that.. everything died.   The air went stale - they could not produce enough oxygen for the animals with the plants within the system.  They obviously had way too much biomass in the system for their experiment to work.  That means more land and more air were required.
futureporn,29bv56,ichneumon,1 point,Sun Jun 29 09:46:01 2014 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from but I don't think that it is obvious what the problem was. We have no established theoretical framework for understanding ecological dynamics and stability under material closure. We can fiddle around with foodweb models and ecological stoichiometry to try and figure things out, but so few experiments are done that it really isn't well understood. There are a huge number of things that could have made the biodome projects doomed to failure but its not clear that biomass quantity is the problem."
futureporn,29bv56,TommBomBadil,1 point,Sun Jun 29 16:27:37 2014 UTC,"The people in the biosphere 2 said the air went stale and oxygen levels went too low.   That's proof.    The oxygen level went too low.  Animals use oxygen.  Plants create oxygen.  There wasn't enough oxygen = too many animals / not enough plants for the enclosed habitat.  If it had lasted longer, 1000 other things might have doomed the project, but this one is a no-brainer.  Don't overthink it."
futureporn,29bv56,JabberwockyJake,1 point,Sun Jun 29 23:13:18 2014 UTC,"No offense guys, but there's a lot here that is being over simplified. Biosphere 2 can actually be seen as a success. It ""failed"" because the people failed, not because the ecosystems shut down. There was a lot going on behind the scenes even though real science was occurring. We learned more about closed systems ecology from Biosphere 2 than nearly any other experiment and it's still being used to study various aspects of ecology. I really need to make a post about this..."
futureporn,29bv56,TommBomBadil,0,Sat Jul 12 15:10:29 2014 UTC,"That's a load of hooey.  Sources please.  As I recall, the whole thing was exposed as part of some sort of quasi-cult outfit, not a real science operation.  And I doubt we learned very much from everything dying off as a result of bad air & waste-buildup.    Also, folks going hungry because they somehow forgot to calculate out their own food-needs - doesn't look promising.   Maybe some real science has happened there since then, but as for that first ambitious experiments, I'll bet nothing of any value came out of it."

There is nothing to see, they are structural weakpoints and you want you crew to be protected deep inside, hidden behind water and fuel tanks (so you can skimp on radiation shielding).

It was the design inspiration for the ISV Venture Star from Avatar (about the only enjoyable thing in that movie)."

futureporn,27uqe9,onlypawningameoflife,26,Wed Jun 11 10:49:58 2014 UTC,"As if anyone is going to sign up for a space trip if they can't see outside.   To see what? By the time you get out to a few moon distances, Earth will be reduced to a tiny blue dot. Everything else is just barely moving dots of light and depressing blackness. Even if you posit a ridiculously powerful torchship with dV in the 2 %c range, it's going to take you like two weeks to fly a brachistochrone to Saturn. That's two weeks staring at nothingness, and let me tell you from a bit of experience on this world's oceans: that gets old. Really, REALLY fast. And in space, there are no dolphins to be amused by.   By the time we come up with a relativistic ship I think we'll have developed ultra-dense (transparent only to visible light) materials. No need for water tanks.   (a) The ship in question is explicitly mentioned to be FTL; extrapolating from its shape it uses some variety of Alcubierre drive. There is no relativistic travel here.  (b) Even going from that, every gram counts in spaceflight. If you have the choice of locking the crew inside water tanks (that you have to lug around anyway) and taking along extra shielding, you'll choose the former.  (c) In actual relativistic flight, this will be far, far worse. Look up the headlight effect and other fun effects of travel close to c. Never underestimate the power of radiation.  (d) 'transparent only to visible light': there is no such thing. Lower the wavelength, increase the intensity or both and something will penetrate. Unless you're positing something like a General Products Hull, but that's not hard SF, that's space opera.    Sorry for going on a rant here, but it massively bugs me when people try to apply tropes and metaphors of existing scenarios to situations where they will not work. Spaceflight in general and interplanetary/interstellar spaceflight in particular is so far removed from anything we are comfortable with that it takes serious imagination and adherence to physics to plot out the setting in a realistic fashion. Artists -- literary or visual -- forgoing that sort of work for flashy visuals and lens flares defile the essence of true science fiction: the exploration of the implications of new, possibly fictional science and technology. You can only do that when adhering to physics and common sense. Anything else is space opera or at best soft SF, and while that's not bad, Star Trek and its ilk would do well to take a chapter out of true SF. Case in point, ST's love for deus ex machina solutions. Know where these never happen? When the author builds his world beforehand and works within those constraints -- brilliant example: Mote in God's Eye -- instead of inventing a new particle, technology or subspace field for every episode.  See this section of Nyrath's website for some further dwelling on the topic; there in the context of why space fighters make no sense in any form of deep space warfare."
futureporn,27uqe9,Burns_Cacti,2,Wed Jun 11 12:31:31 2014 UTC,"I agree windows are useless during travel, but perhaps they get covered up by panels. But when you get to your destination, planet, whatever humans are going to want to look out a window and see with their own eyes, even if its a small submarine style porthole....cameras work fine for most things but arriving at a new world, the astronauts will want to see it with their own eyes."
futureporn,27uqe9,pineconez,2,Wed Jun 11 20:28:23 2014 UTC,"Let's be honest here, by the time we're actually trying anything interstellar, transhumans/posthumans and to a greater degree, purpose built AIs will be vastly better choices than humans in terms of filling crew slots.  And that's even assuming 'manned' missions and not just von Neumann probes."
futureporn,27uqe9,XtremeGoose,1 point,Thu Jun 12 09:50:28 2014 UTC,"That strongly depends on your willingness to speculate about whether The SingularityTM will ever occur, and if it does, what its abilities and limitations will be. By its very nature, this can only be pure speculation.  I don't believe for a moment we'll get Star<insert franchise here> with casual interstellar travel, but I also don't believe we'll get Accelerando. The reasons for the former will be obvious, on the reasons for the latter I'll let the author do the talking. To add my two cents to it, while the Singularity (the harder the better) makes a fantastic fiction setting, I have trouble taking people seriously when they bring it up in a futurological debate. You cannot extrapolate what lies behind it, what it's consequences are, that's more or less part of the definition, and therefore discussing it becomes slightly problematic to say the least. And then there's the can of worms if you can even consider the products of such Singularity human at all.  Anyway. I have a feeling the most likely outcome will be somewhere in the middle. Assuming FTL is a no-go, which is an assumption we have to make, humanity might indeed be able to colonize or at least explore a few exosystems: if you assume that we will colonize the Solar system (i.e. have people living on Mars, Titan, blah) then the techlevel jump required for interstellar exploration is still substantial, but not out of reach (insert antimatter farms on Mercury here). Widespread colonization though, and a galaxy-spanning civilization, would not be possible without a very hard singularity indeed. At which point: why colonize, when all you need are raw materials?  Should FTL be possible, all of this is invalid. Again, there's no real chance of this being the case, but there is a reason why FTL travel is accepted even in the hardest of Science Fiction settings, with only very few exceptions."
futureporn,27uqe9,pineconez,4,Thu Jun 12 13:59:46 2014 UTC,"a) I said relativistic because they're more realistic that ftl ships, I'm assuming ftl will never be made (and I'm pretty confident in that assumption).  b) Why do you need to lug around water tanks? It is possible for water to be 100% recycled.   c) nb. I said windows, not necessarily a front facing one. But even then we'll need a more ingenious solution than simply putting a slab of lead at the front since there will be such a large high energy flux passing through the ship.  d) You've never heard of a band pass filter?   I agree, the current sci-fi idea of what space travel will be like is very wrong. But many of the problems facing such machines are simply unsolvable with the knowledge we have currently. The radiation flux in relativistic flight being one of them. Window or no window, it would kill you, and then melt you. And people will want windows. It's not like people don't go outside and stare at the stars for hours as a hobby anyway."
futureporn,27uqe9,sto-ifics42,6,Wed Jun 11 12:45:39 2014 UTC,"a) I said relativistic because they're more realistic that ftl ships, I'm assuming ftl will never be made (and I'm pretty confident in that assumption).   Fair enough. That's actually entirely reasonable.   b) Why do you need to lug around water tanks? It is possible for water to be 100% recycled.   You'll need some form of storage, and the efficiency of your recycling really depends on how long you're going to stay in space (you'll always lose something, I mean). Apart from that, if your spaceship is powered by some form of fusion, water would be a great way to carry the hydrogen required for that -- it's dense, inert, and also a source for oxygen. This would assume proton-proton fusion though, if you need deuterium, then heavy water is your gadget. Water may also be used as coolant, and the amount of water you need to carry also depends on your crew (since it takes time for humans to excrete the water and then to recycle it, you'll need some additional storage). All in all, call it at least a few ten cubic meters for a crew of a dozen people or so, once you add in reserves etc.   c) nb. I said windows, not necessarily a front facing one. But even then we'll need a more ingenious solution than simply putting a slab of lead at the front since there will be such a large high energy flux passing through the ship.   Actually, that's probably what we're going to do, but in the form of a shadow shield. You might need to cool that, too. Here are a few long essays on the design intricacies of the Valkyrie antimatter rocket; they deal with these things rather nicely. There aren't any real alternatives to this either; water and wax make good shields for heavy particles, but a lot of the nasty stuff is x-ray and above, and you can only defeat that with a lot of dense material. Well, until you invent the Langston Field...   d) You've never heard of a band pass filter?   Won't work as a radiation shield. The radiation we are discussing is so energetic that it will simply penetrate these things, doesn't matter what they're made of (otherwise nuclear reactors would become a lot more portable). Even assuming high-tech future materials(tm) I sincerely doubt you could manufacture OBPFs that operate in these wavelengths. Even building simple x-ray mirrors for a few keV is a nontrivial task (and the resulting grazing-incidence optics are MASSIVE); increasing those energies by several orders of magnitude will only make the problem more pronounced. You're getting into the regime where the photons actually start interacting with nuclei, not just electron shells, cf. photodisintegration. Building such advanced optics that can operate in this regime is widely regarded to be impossible, unless you can somehow handwave gravitational lenses (in which case practically all of our problems go away anyway). This is also one of the reasons why you can't have your hard x-ray/gamma ray laser guns.     I agree, the current sci-fi idea of what space travel will be like is very wrong. But many of the problems facing such machines are simply unsolvable with the knowledge we have currently. The radiation flux in relativistic flight being one of them.   Actually, that specifically is one of the minor problems. WRT relativistic ships the biggest problem we have is that we have no idea how to produce and employ the power sources required (antimatter and subatomic black holes are pretty much the only contestants, and SBHs have...problems). Radiation shielding is a rather minor offender here. And there are many other reasons why windows would be a bad idea, btw. One is that you would want the outer areas of your spacecraft to be unpressurized and serve as last-ditch whipple shields if anything does make it through your space dust defenses.   It's not like people don't go outside and stare at the stars for hours as a hobby anyway.   There's not much to see during a relativistic flight anyway. Depending on how fast you go, everything will be bent into an ever-tightening cone forward, blueshifted, and the headlight effect will smash everything into a bright white glare. Behind you, around you, only blackness. Cool visual, but a camera is just as efficient. All of this is assuming our astronauts will be awake for the journey, which might not be the case (although I have to invoke my own first law here -- building a generational slowboat won't be particularly harder or easier than building a relativistic cruiser).    Edit: eek, I just realized: this damnable thing is a belly-lander! Except it would make no sense for it to land, so it's even more nonsencical. Spaceships are skyscrapers, not aeroplanes!"

That's what a lander is for.   You would look mighty stupid if the external cameras broke and the ship was then blind.   If your sensors and computers are damaged so badly that you need to rely on windows, you're probably already dead. If we're talking about docking, every instrument on your ship could be dead and you'd still be able to dock as long as you can receive data from whatever you're docking with.

You're also comparing a (for all intents and purposes) cislunar flight on a free return trajectory with a potentially interstellar, but at least interplanetary voyage requiring serious maneuvering.  The closest thing we have to a viable interplanetary spaceship is the ISS. It lacks the propulsion, of course, but the entire habitation module is more or less what you would take on a tour of the solar system as well. You'd want more supplies, more redundancies, but that's basically it.  If the ISS should ever experience a total computer failure, its three to six inhabitants are dead. Period. End of discussion. Most of the ISS' functions are controlled from Houston and Moscow (the astronauts are there to do science, not micromanage a space station), and while you could jury-rig a radio connection (via ham radio -- it's been done before) to at least talk to them, that'd be of limited use. I don't know how much direct input the crew has on station control, especially when it comes to resetting and debugging the computer systems, but I wouldn't expect too much.  The main problem is that they'd be on a very short clock. You can't run a CELSS of the ISS' scale without computers, and if that system craps out completely, you're in trouble. Oxygen and CO2 would be the first problems, followed by heat, followed by water and excretion.  The one counter-example would be the failed docking of a Progress spacecraft to the Mir (which very nearly doomed the station), but comparing that to an interplanetary/interstellar explorer is a bit of a stretch."

futureporn,27k1sz,rrandomCraft,6,Sun Jun 8 04:53:34 2014 UTC,"Yes, definitely. Show this image to any contemporaty architect or urban planner and prepare for long sighs. Futurist utopias tend to visually symbolize the values they wish to achieve, only providing an exaggerated and immature vision of its form. In the end, they only work as an expression of an emphmeral ideal, something linked to current anxieties and dreams of a perfect society.  Future sustainability infrastructure would likely be unrecognizable to us in the present. Further more, it's possible our current concept of sustainability problems/solutions will have been absurdly inaccurate in hindsight. Lastly, and more to the point, tree skyscrapers and megastructures are already cliches which sustainable design commitees are trying to work past. Unfortunately, actual progress is harder to sell than the appearance of progress.  That said, images like this will be relics of the early 21st century. It's possible they will give insight to anthropologists looking back, just as we look back to the early 20th century's futurism."
futureporn,27k1sz,Gnashtaru,2,Sun Jun 8 07:29:44 2014 UTC,"Future infrastructure being unrecognizable is what I think of most when I look through these pics. I mean, the people back then couldn't imagine how modern tech would look today and how contemporary styles would change. They couldn't envision a sleek, shiny future cuz they couldn't see past the styles they knew, which is why I think the future is going to look a whole lot cooler than we could ever imagine with these concept art pics.  I mean, their visions of the future look ridiculous to us now, and downright ugly in some cases. I'm sure the same will be true for future-us too"
futureporn,27k1sz,okiujh,3,Sun Jun 8 12:09:25 2014 UTC,"This reminds me of Jacque Fresco's, The Venus Project, in which they have their city systems laid out."
futureporn,27k1sz,KhanneaSuntzu,2,Sun Jun 8 06:04:41 2014 UTC,Jacque's designs seem more logical in terms of layout. A centralized hub and everything revolving around it in a circular manner seems way more efficient than a (seemingly) random manner as in OP's image. Though any one of these is much MUCH better than what we have not...
futureporn,27k1sz,okiujh,2,Sun Jun 8 14:03:17 2014 UTC,I just watched the episode and actually freeze framed that scene. Probably sat there for a good 15 min or so just daydreaming of what we as a society could accomplish if it wasn't for all the B.S. In our society now.

futureporn,274qyk,Baby_venomm,9,Tue Jun 3 13:25:57 2014 UTC,What would happen to the stability of the Moon if this were to happen?
futureporn,274qyk,PivotalPlatypus,41,Mon Jun 2 22:02:15 2014 UTC,That's not how physics works. It wouldn't ever happen. If you somehow had an object of that size and shape it would just collapse in on itself and make a sphere.
futureporn,274qyk,archon88,16,Mon Jun 2 22:10:31 2014 UTC,"Another problem with the image is that the moon is so close. If a moon crosses a threshold called the Roche limit, the tidal forces from the planet will pull it apart. The moon's Roche limit is about 20 000 km from Earth (about 5% of its actual distance), and the moon in that picture doesn't look so far away."

'  'But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction -- indeed, in some sense was the destruction -- of a hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away.'

It was the same with 1984- I read that again recently and seeing the stuff about how was was used to waste money and resources without leveling the playing field or increasing living standards was quite pertinent.

futureporn,26jl8z,JabbrWockey,3,Tue May 27 05:35:16 2014 UTC,What similarities? If anything Shanghai is a better fit.  Beijing looks like it's something out of SciFi because everything is Communist grey concrete with wide avenues.
futureporn,26jl8z,MJ709,3,Tue May 27 15:19:52 2014 UTC,"I've been to Shanghai too, and have to disagree. Shanghai looks futuristic sci fi. Giant colorful light shows on the sides of massive, new, shiny sky scrapers. Plus, most of the shanghai air particles come from the river, so at least the smog is white, instead of brown. Beijing is much more like a dystopian future. Tons of people crammed into a gigantic, filthy, urban sprawl where all the buildings look the same. The air is tainted brown, and now there even building ""Sky City"" just outside of beijing, which will be a self sufficient city in the form of one gigantic building, which is essentially the exact same thing as a megablock from Dredd. Shanghai is much cleaner wealthier, and newer. Most of the city was built in the last two decades around the Pearl TV tower, so the buildings are extremely high tech. Visually, Beijing is the better fit."
futureporn,26jl8z,JabbrWockey,3,Tue May 27 20:00:56 2014 UTC,"No way - only if you stick to the Bund or Nanjing rd.  Shanghai has some of the highest population density in the world.  All you have to do is take a couple steps out of the shiny touristy areas to see tenements piled on top of each other, not unlike Dredd.  Beijing is a big city too, but it's reflective of old Communist China in that it's flat, sprawling and planned.  Shanghai is way more dystopian (and probably the best place to film a blade runner sequel, IMO)."

futureporn,26j1m7,6TLaRm4g,3,Sun Jun 15 00:58:06 2014 UTC,Only if you are traveling on level ground.  If you are exploring/scavenging in an urban landscape having a walking cart is more effective.  It's much like how ancient Peruvians didn't use the wheel/cart because the mountains made them less useful than pack animals.
futureporn,26j1m7,marinersalbatross,0,Mon May 26 19:34:35 2014 UTC,"Even then an actual pack animal would be 1000x cheaper and more efficient. Now we all get it this is an art piece, so let's just let it slide :D"
futureporn,26j1m7,6TLaRm4g,3,Mon May 26 20:43:01 2014 UTC,"Not necessarily, it depends on the tech. It's much like how Boston Dynamics is currently building a robot pack mule for the army.  Do you know why?  Because it can run on fuels that are available not to mention it's also more controllable and won't bolt in case of gun fire.  Pack animals require lots of support from foods to veterinary care. Perhaps in the future it's easier to feed it some sort of algae to creates it's energy. You just can't tell. I know it's just an art display, but it does have a basis in reality.  Here's a prototype of the ""mule"", I could easily see a more self sufficient model in a decade.  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=195_1347778378"
futureporn,26j1m7,marinersalbatross,0,Mon May 26 23:39:31 2014 UTC,"yeah, I've followed this project from the start of Big Dog, that's why I said it's ridiculous to use it. The problem with these robots are energy. And no, it only runs on petroleum. And it burns it hella fast. The biggest hungriest SUV would be like Smart compared to the efficiency behemoth that is that ""mule"". In order for it to work for any meaningful distance you would have to carry fuel tank several times the size of the mule, the size it cannot carry itself. That's how bad it is. And it's not only because of the lack of optimization. It is because four legs like that fundamentally require very much energy. There's a reason why human can outlast any animal on the ground - humans have the most efficient walking type there could exist without involving wheels. So that's why wheels are a necessity on any robot that wants to be actually useful.  After all, such robots aren't really technology beyond our abilities. It's simply a technology that is expensive and not useful enough. It's cute that DARPA wanted to try out the prospects of robotics, but it won't happen. At least not like this. Unless something from the unknown unknowns category happens, a breakthrough nobody expected."
futureporn,26j1m7,Deceptichum,3,Tue May 27 00:14:01 2014 UTC,"And I too understand the inefficiencies of the current systems, but to dismiss future advancements is to deny technology changes. Yeah, legs aren't always a great idea, but damn do they work really well in a variety of circumstances- especially in an post-apocalyptic urban environment. :)"
futureporn,26j1m7,6TLaRm4g,1 point,Tue May 27 00:37:00 2014 UTC,"You haven't been following BigDog at all from the sounds of it.  Here's an electric powered version from 5 years ago [1:30 mark if the link isn't playing at the right time]  For all we know this kids dog could be a model from 2025, when Tesla had invented more robust batteries that hold more charge and for longer while it's powered by some more advanced solar power that can absorb different wave lengths and more efficiently. No unexpected breakthroughs just another decades worth of refinement of current technologies.  Also walking is an extremely efficient way of moving compared to wheels on not flat services. The momentum can be transferred across the body while the weight is shifted. Humans are a perfect example of how efficient walking is, our species number one ability is walking extremely long distances (and tracking prey until it tires out)."
futureporn,26j1m7,6TLaRm4g,1 point,Tue May 27 02:42:28 2014 UTC,"Tesla inventing more robust batteries would be unexpected breakthrough. More advanced solar power would be totally unexpected, because according to current physics, it would be impossible to get enough energy. What is expected for regular people from science does not always is actually expected from scientists. For example many people probably think time travel is a matter of technology, and if it would be invented, many won't even be impressed.  As for walking, you just repeated what I said. But walking on four legs is different. Also the way bigdog walks is not the efficient way animals do it. If you would be walking like bigdog does, you would be always stressed every muscle and on full focus all the time, you wouldn't walk more than few kilometers that way and would drop from exhaustion.  That's why I always say, that a robot like this must have wheels to save energy on flat surfaces. Let him use legs where wheels would require more energy to overcome obstacle than legs."

futureporn,268cbs,SnazzyMax,2,Fri May 23 12:32:14 2014 UTC,You're not wrong. I guess its because people are going by the tallest building measurements which put the Eiffel tower at 301m because spires aren't counted.   If they were it would be too easy to arbitrarily surpass building heights.

futureporn,2642pl,LoftyVolaterrae,3,Thu May 22 02:13:22 2014 UTC,exactly what i thought too
futureporn,2642pl,Dewgongz,13,Thu May 22 03:58:54 2014 UTC,I assume this is a colony ship. It deployed solar sails which if I'm correct aren't meant for FTL travel. It's most likely this ship would house a great number of colonists that either have greatly extended life spans or will enter suspended animation until they reach their destination
futureporn,2642pl,UnthinkingMajority,3,Wed May 21 15:34:16 2014 UTC,Nothing is meant for FTL travel - it's prohibited by physics to the best of our understanding.
futureporn,2642pl,supergalactic,9,Wed May 21 15:37:31 2014 UTC,We're trying to get around that with a warp bubble. You compress the space in front of the ship while stretching it out behind. You can travel faster than light and physics won't give you a second glance.
futureporn,2642pl,UnthinkingMajority,5,Wed May 21 18:39:03 2014 UTC,"...Only if exotic particles exist. I've read all the scientific papers, and while it's interesting it is anything but a certainty. I wouldn't hold out hope because superluminal travel violates many other well-tested principles of physics."
futureporn,2642pl,Smithium,8,Wed May 21 18:41:30 2014 UTC,Quantum vacuum fluctuations display the same essential properties of exotic particles that are needed to satisfy that requirement.
futureporn,2642pl,Jigsus,1 point,Wed May 21 19:25:55 2014 UTC,"That's because the exotic particles were models based off of Quantum vacuum fluctuations, it still does not mean that the models are correct."
futureporn,2642pl,UnthinkingMajority,0,Wed May 28 13:38:06 2014 UTC,Not quite. The testing for warp bubbles needs no exotic matter.  Also if you're talking about FTL breaking causality that's only an issue if you subscribe to FTL teleportation like Battlestar Galactica. Warp bubbles would keep all the time properties in check.
futureporn,2642pl,Jigsus,4,Wed May 21 20:55:48 2014 UTC,"No they don't. FTL travel would mean you could transmit information faster than light, which is the exact problem with it in the first place. This is something that all FTL would have, and it's the main reason physicists like myself don't think it is possible."
futureporn,2642pl,UnthinkingMajority,0,Wed May 21 21:13:28 2014 UTC,"Warp drive gets around that because things are not actually moving at FTL. The space around them is and we know space can move at FTL.  I know you're thinking of the FTL bullet experiment right now and saying ""but that's how you break causality"" but it isn't. The information inside the system is not travelling at FTL. It's staying in a contained frame of reference.   Sure you can get on your warp ship and warp to Alpha Centauri but when you shut down the warp bubble the ship isn't magically integrated into that frame of reference. It never accelerated so it's still in the frame of reference of the starting point and needs to adjust itself with conventional propulsion to the destination. That's why warp travel doesn't break causality.  To make it even clearer let's say we consider the origin to be A. To simplify A is considered stationary. The ship is in A and warps to B. The problem is that B is moving away from A at 0.75*c. That's a super high speed but the ship has no trouble reaching B.  The helmsman disengages the warp drive and SURPRISE! The ship is now stationary and B whizzes away from the ship at 0.75*c. What the ship must do to remain in B is to warp ahead then match speeds with B with conventional propulsion."
futureporn,2642pl,Jigsus,5,Wed May 21 21:24:33 2014 UTC,"That's not how causality works. It would be possible to see the effect of something before the cause, which is the very definition of breaking causality. You don't need to match reference frames, you just need to transmit the information. For example: a particle splits in two at point A. You take one of those pieces and warp it to point B. People at point B will then observe both the complete particle in their timeline, and this half of it that is one-half of the same particle. In that reference frame, things exist twice. This is the violation of causality that all FTL causes.  I know people are downvoting because they don't like what I am saying, but that's not how science works. Physicists and scientists are supposed to follow the facts, not their sci-fi fantasies."
futureporn,2642pl,TheAlmightyProphet,2,Wed May 21 21:49:10 2014 UTC,Seeing something 100 lightyears away and seeing it next to you at the same time is not a violation of causality. The image you're seeing is 100 years old. Violating causality requires you to be able to change the cause of an effect you've already observed.
futureporn,2642pl,UnthinkingMajority,5,Thu May 22 05:24:29 2014 UTC,I hate how much your being downvoted. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that going anywhere faster than light is possible.

All individual identity washed away into the sea of people constantly traversing the dense streets of the lower sanctum. Red and pink lights illuminated the walls and ceilings, advertising small shops and inns that lined the stretch. Among the hairy heads and hats, one man stood out, a dark hooded figure covered in a brown cloak. From the center of his face three large tentacles portruded, accented by his jet black eyes and pale flesh. He broke away from the group and slinked down a dark alleyway. On his wrist a metal band with blue lights slowly dimmed. He placed himself quietly behind a large dumpster and began to examine the bracer, trying feverishly to remove it.  After a few moments of struggling, he sighed and let his arms fall to the damp floor. His gaze floated hopelessly to the sky. For a moment he stared blankly into the light, but something else caught his attention. Through a mess of cabling and wires, he could see the moon. It glowed with a blue tint, not light from the sun but light emitted from the moon's mechanical surface. The Prison. His expression shifted from despair to determination. It was only a matter of staying hidden long enough for the brace to run out of power, then he would be free for good.   At the other end of the passageway near the street, a babies cry fought the roar of the crowd. At first he shrugged it off as another sound of the city, but it seemed closer than the rest. He poked his head out from the garbage heap and peered down the way to see an infant lying alone on the curb in the shadows. It cried and whined for attention, but the man knew the ways of the lower levels. Here it was every man for himself, the epitome of poverty and homelessness. I'm sure its parents will be coming back soon. He tried to put it out of his mind, his eyelids growing heavy as he lay in the trash. For what felt like only a few minutes he slept. As he rested the sun moved a great distance in the sky, bringing dusk to the city.  The sunlight shifted across the wall until it met the threshold of his eye, bringing him slowly back to consciousness. The sound of the baby's whine had dwindled to an exhausted sputter. Alarmed, he stood up and glanced over the dumpster. It must have been hours. The blank faces of the passing crowd seemed not to notice the child, too busy trying to sustain themselves to even consider another mouth to feed. The cloaked figure slowly walked down the alleyway. He then stopped in front of the baby, bent down to pick it up, and brought it back up to his face. For a moment he was worried about frightening it, but the whining had stopped. The child's face lit up in excitement, and it began to tug on one of the creatures tentacles and giggle. If only there was something i could do for you. He looked up to the rooftops of the skyline across the street. The richest and most well-off live an easy life in the sun up on the highest levels of the city. A highborne child would stand a chance in this city, but you... the baby's excitement peetered off, and it quickly fell asleep in his arms. He was content for a moment, holding the fragile bundle of cloths in his arms.   All of the sudden he saw a different face in the crowd, or rather the lack of a face. The black visored helmet, a signature look reserved for the city's security force. The creature swiftly spun around and planted his shoulder heavily into the wall, while holding the babes head gently in his hand. He stood there frozen for a few moments, hoping for the danger to pass. A hand came down on his left shoulder, gripping the base of his neck and pulling him back around. He allowed his shoulder to be pulled but his body didn't move for a few seconds as he prepared himself to run. 'This yours, sir?' a voice rang out. He turned around slowly to a boy trying to give him a bottle. 'Was right here on the street, it was.' The creature let loose a sigh of relief. 'Thank you.' he said quickly as grabbed it from the boys hands. And now to find you a better home, he thought, his eyes looking hopefully to the skyline."

A carbon nanotube space tether would be a strip of woven nanotubes, not a thick cable. It will be 1 metre wide, and have a cross section of 10 microns (tapering to 60 microns at high stress locations). It would be rolled out from a satellite just like plastic wrap.  This will support a load of in the region of 40 metric tons.   CNTs are astonishingly strong - researchers have produced CNTs of close to the required strength in tiny amounts in the lab, and it is improving on a Moore's Law type curve. Theoretical models suggest it should be possible to scale this research up to the 100,000km required. The problems that need to be solved are significant, but they have all been solved in other contexts and industries.  Amazingly it appears it may be feasible in the 30-60 year timescale.

futureporn,24n3ih,thisonetimeonreddit,18,Sun May 4 02:20:30 2014 UTC,"Some engineering assumptions go into this drawing, namely that the material being used for the tether can withstand the tension load of the structure (probably carbon nanotubes), but the physics of a space elevator is pretty sound.   You can map the orbital velocity that an object needs in order to stay in stable orbit as a function of its altitude in Earth's gravitational well (turns out to be mass independent). By taking the tether out to geostationary orbit, you are at an altitude at which the docking station at the other end rotates at the same velocity as the planet. This means that the relative angle of the tether to the surface of the planet stays constant and stable.  In regards to the waves, an analogy to start. If you take a string and wiggle it, you'll notice that the transverse disturbance that is created and travels down the string reduces in size as it goes, until it disappears completely. This is because the oscillation is damped as a function of time as it travels through the medium of the string.  The space elevator would be about 36000 km in altitude in order to reach geostationary orbit. This means that any disturbance transduced into the tether through the rolling ocean water would be absorbed and dampened so quickly that it would not be very noticeable at all."

futureporn,24n3ih,monnnnsannntoooo,1 point,Sun May 4 06:00:10 2014 UTC,"the orbital velocity that an object needs in order to stay in stable orbit as a function of its altitude in Earth's gravitational well (turns out to be mass independent)   Can you explain this a bit more? I would think that the gravitational pull of the object in question needs to be considered. Doesn't this depend (somewhat) on the mass of the object?  Also what about extreme weather effects? Tornadoes, hurricanes, things of that sort. What about really bad lightning storms? Would those maybe have some electrical effect on the system?"
futureporn,24n3ih,wu2ad,2,Sun May 4 16:15:40 2014 UTC,"So if you look at the forces that are acting on an object in orbit, you have an outward centripetal force (similar to the force felt by a rock swinging around on a string), and you have a gravitational force, pointing inward towards the center of the planet. Part of defining an orbit as being stable is when these two forces are equal and opposite balancing each other out. If you look up the equations for each of them and then set them equal to eachother, the mass of the orbiting object actually cancels out. This logic is where this independence from mass comes from.  In terms of extreme weather effects, I will gladly submit that this is an area that I don't feel qualified to answer in a dependable way. As a rough estimate, I would say that if a hurricane/earthquake/tornado/sharknado were powerful enough, you could see some considerable damage to the tether. It's something I haven't thought very much about, and would definitely need to go into the testing regime when engineering the elevator itself.   Whether or not lightning strikes would affect the system would depend on the propulsion used on the tether. I suppose that you could sheath the tether in an electrically insulating material, or the wheels/electromagnets on the climber unit could be insulated from the tether. Again, this is definitely a solid area of concern, but I am confident that we could engineer our way around it in a safe and efficient manner.  yayscience"
futureporn,24n3ih,monnnnsannntoooo,1 point,Sun May 4 21:28:13 2014 UTC,"Hmm OK. It's been a while since I took physics, so I went back and reviewed the formulas. It looks like after mass cancels out, the velocity needed to maintain orbit (the v necessary for F1 == F2 is actually dependent on the radius of the orbit.  But this confuses me, because it would imply that orbital speed is directly proportional to how far away from Earth an object is, regardless of how massive it is. That seems counterintuitive, can you explain this more? Doesn't an object's own gravitational force increase as its mass increases? What about the size of the object itself? Another object the size of Earth, travelling at the same velocity and distance away from us as the moon, can't possibly orbit us happily, can it?"
futureporn,24n3ih,wu2ad,1 point,Sun May 4 23:31:07 2014 UTC,"The real world analogy that I always use for gravitational wells is that of one of those plastic vortex things. Large plastic funnels that you spin a marble around, and then they slow down and fall into the hole. The closer and closer you are to the hole, the faster you need to rotate the marble around the opening in order to maintain a stable rotation.   This is a bit crude because this example represents a gravitational well in 2 dimensions. Since we exist in 3 spatial dimensions, it's a bit harder to visualize, but the mathematical relation stays the same. As you travel farther and farther out of a gravitational well, the gravitational force on an object lessens, correspondingly lessening the orbital velocity. You can go back to the plastic funnel analogy by imagining the marble climbing up to a region where the gradient of the curve bottoms out.  If we did have another earth sized object orbiting at a lunar radius, it would still work out as long as the correct orbital velocity at that radius (which works out to 1 km/s). The corresponding change in gravitational force from an object that large is perfectly balanced  by the matched change in an outward centripetal force. It is an expression of this balance between forces that allows the relation to be mass independent. Now, if you increase this object's velocity, it will over time escape the orbit. If you decrease it, it will over time decay into the Earth, ending things badly for civilization."
futureporn,24n3ih,Diamano,1 point,Mon May 5 04:03:35 2014 UTC,"You should note that when one object is orbiting another, it's actually not.  It's orbiting the center of mass of the two-body system.  So, the Earth isn't actually orbiting the Sun, but rather the center of mass of the solar system, which is usually in or around the sun (because the sun is so massive).  So if you had two earth-size and earth-mass objects orbiting each other, it wouldn't look like the moon orbiting the earth, because the center of mass of the system would be right in between the two.  To combine this with monsanto's analogy, you can think of the center of mass of the system as the ""hole"" in the plastic vortex thingy.  When one of the bodies in the system is very massive compared to the other, it is really close to the hole in the middle, so from the point of view of the smaller body it might appear to just be slightly wiggling, since it's moving so little."
futureporn,24n3ih,monnnnsannntoooo,1 point,Thu May 8 21:36:56 2014 UTC,"Ah that makes a whole lot more sense. Then the Gs in the formula for centripetal force isn't coming from the centres of either object, rather it's the point of equilibrium in gravitational force that 2 objects exert on each other.

futureporn,24n3ih,wu2ad,9,Sat May 3 21:19:18 2014 UTC,Think of the elevator portion more like a cord than anything else.
futureporn,24n3ih,AngryCowGod,1 point,Sat May 3 22:13:03 2014 UTC,"I didn't ask why it was flexible, I asked why it was curved. A space elevator in its equilibrium state, anchored at the equator, should point up in a straight line."

futureporn,24n3ih,FinnishFuturist,-1,Sun May 4 16:19:28 2014 UTC,"Maybe it's not in its equilibrium state then. There's a strong wind or something.   Wind only affects the elevator close to the surface. Also, it would take a ridiculously strong wind, of which there is absolutely no sign on the visible surface features.   Also, in a practical sense, how often is a real space elevator going to be at perfect equilibrium state anyway?   All the time, unless it's designed not to be, but there's no obvious reason to do that, particularly considering the effect it would (presumably) have on the elevator's structural integrity over time."

futureporn,24n3ih,Baby_venomm,4,Sat May 3 23:54:37 2014 UTC,"I see what you mean, but here's another thought:  The cost per kilogram of raw materials, etc. to deliver up to orbit is too high right now. The space elevator solves that; once the initial investment is made building it, it would be way cheaper to bring, say, enough parts and materials to build about 100 spacecraft for the price of a single, rocket-propelled launch. We could build dozens of laser-armed space drones to destroy or deflect any objects that imperil our elevator cable.  TL;DR Space elevators might help us build machinery capable of protecting them, cheaper/faster."

futureporn,244wpb,eksekseksg3,8,Sun Apr 27 23:38:24 2014 UTC,"Sure.  I started off (in Photoshop) by just throwing shapes at the the canvas and picking ones that were appealing to me.  Then I arranged them into a perspective and formed a simple composition.  A lot of people mock up scenes like this in 3D first, but I like to work fast (This was created in a few days rather than weeks).

The difference in blending between your progress pic and final is astounding. That's really cool. I was wondering how you did all that crazy detail...  So you layer transparent (or low-flow) strokes over each other for the texture, then path out the shapes to clean it up?"

(Not seeing the lights themselves, but the areas that are lit by the lights.) Even though the headlights of your car can light up hundreds of meters of road, you can't really see it at a glance from space.

futureporn,208jex,HardwareLust,1 point,Thu Mar 13 03:37:28 2014 UTC,"Money-prices bridge the gap between technical accounting and subjective consumer preferences.  There is no ""psychic unit of value"" in the human mind. It's just, ""I want to take this action more than I want to take that action, because this action will help me achieve my ends"".  Money, in its role as a Unit of Account, allows humans to express value digitally/statistically (x units vs. y units), even though value is ultimately ordinal/subjective (x>y to me). Money is the reason we can have nice things. Rational coordination of supply and demand on a scale beyond household economy is impossible without a price mechanism, and the pricing mechanism only exists in a market economy by definition. Anything else would be cheap mimicry and would not perform the same function and the function is vital. It is no wonder that money-like goods were one of the earliest technologies."

It's unclear exactly what you could get out of these systems, but there's clearly some possibilities.  One hazard is if any force that comes from the electromagnetic interaction decreases your orbital speed.  This would bring you closer to atmospheric reentry, which is bad.  Basically, you want to make sure you don't use the energy you just put in with the launch rocket.

futureporn,1zuzv8,Drilski,12,Sat Mar 8 10:26:47 2014 UTC,"What you're referring to is the London Plan, a small part of which blocks any development which infringes on a person's ability to see major historic landmarks from a specific set of open spaces, usually hills and parks. Iirc some of the landmarks are St Paul's and the Palace of Westminster, but I think there might be a couple more, and the open spaces I honestly can't remember. Perhaps Clapham Common might be one of them?  At any rate, the upshot of all this is that that's why the skyline of London is ""lopsided"" in the sense that many of the tallest buildings are clustered around Canary Wharf, as that's the area closest to the City which has a lot of room to build upwards since there aren't any viewing angles to block.

futureporn,1yy4px,NLHNTR,4,Wed Feb 26 06:02:11 2014 UTC,"Here's why. http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Marauder  The Marauder BattleMech is arguably the most iconic early BattleMech image featured in BattleTech and, previously, BattleDroids. Marauder miniatures have been resculpted several times, more recently due to legal disputes. The original Marauder artwork and figures are unseen, bearing striking resemblance to Zentradi Officer's Battle Pods (Roiquonmi Glaug Battle Pod) from the anime series The Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Despite this, reseen Marauder images have replaced previous artwork, and aspects of the design have influenced artwork and construction for several other BattleMechs."

However, a big part of it to the country is cost. If you imagine technology at the time could equip soldiers in much more technologically advanced gear for $10 million a head, they may go for a different approach that costs less.  It's the same reason the US military is still using the M16. There's better weapons out there, but the improved performance isn't cost effective."

This artwork was commissioned by Australian Geographic and featured in their July/August edition.  ""After a slow start in the 21st century, the exploitation of the vast mineral resources of the asteroids began wholesale and a commercial race to claim the most valuable was engaged. Only the largest nations had the ability to directly access space commercially, and so large multinational consortiums formed around China and the USA in the construction of large mining and prospecting vehicles to be sent to the nearest asteroids.  The most advanced and longest serving of these vessels is the crewed CNSA Nanking, a huge vehicle constructed in earth orbit with components and expertise from over half a dozen nations and bankrolled by PRC mining interests. The Nanking carries supplies for a small crew to survive for months or years in space and carries equipment enabling it to produce many of its essential resources from materials collected from the asteroids it prospects.  Along with a complete internal geophysical, chemical and nuclear analysis laboratory for assessing samples, the Nanking carries two mobile pods which can approach asteroids to take samples, lay anchor lines, and perform maintenance on the Nanking herself.  When an asteroid is discovered that may be worth exploiting, the Nanking lowers one of several modular analysis units to the surface. These bond to the outer rock or dust and begin to mechanically, chemically and thermally bore a sample shaft into the rock to ensure the mineral content is present in commercial concentrations: This process may be completed several times on a single asteroid to be certain of its viability.  Should the asteroid prove a strike, a claim is lodged with an international register and the Nanking begins construction of the first stages of mining infrastructure. This will later be completed by more specialised automated vessels, which home in on a transponder left by the Nanking."""

futureporn,1ylnqn,Beast_Pot_Pie,15,Sat Feb 22 16:04:40 2014 UTC,Thats the kind of video game world you want to step into and not have anything that 'needs' to get done.  Where you can just relax and explore with no set objective.
futureporn,1ylnqn,nippleinmydickfuck,12,Sat Feb 22 15:00:13 2014 UTC,"Seriously, I'm not a huge gamer but I would pay good money for a game that I could just wander around in that has this kind of setting."
futureporn,1ylnqn,the_omega99,4,Sat Feb 22 19:02:32 2014 UTC,"Technically, lots of open world games (such as Fallout and the Elder Scrolls games) let you do this, but also have objectives (because objectives give the game an explicit purpose and can drive a story).  I've spent many hours wandering the open world of the Fallout universe without working towards the main story. The atmosphere is fantastic.  Does anyone know any futuristic games (not dystopian like Fallout) that have these kinds of open worlds?"
futureporn,1ylnqn,Tomazim,2,Sun Feb 23 01:24:32 2014 UTC,The nature of building a world likes that requires a game to sell well. Therefore it will have a story and objectives.

futureporn,1ygepz,ethan_kahn,23,Thu Feb 20 17:26:42 2014 UTC,Now I get why NASA got a tank on Mars. Damn Space Commies!
futureporn,1ygepz,NCaz,6,Thu Feb 20 17:40:10 2014 UTC,First thing it reminded me of.  And now this is starting to look like the makings of a kickass future Cold War movie.
futureporn,1ygepz,iesvs,2,Thu Feb 20 21:24:10 2014 UTC,"And now this is starting to look like the makings of a kickass future Cold War movie.   There was one pretty good Japanese sci-fi manga with a background in a Sino-American cold war in space, the Moonlight Mile by Yasuo Otagaki.  It begins with two mountain climber friends, Gorou and Lostman aiming for the moon after they've conquered Mt. Everest. Lostman joined US Navy aviation and subsequently the US space force, participated in a secret near-space war against China, and eventually became the cold-hearted bitch that governs the secret US moonbase and then international moon city. Gorou joined Japanese space agency and later served as a star astronaut in ISS, championed peaceful use of space and international cooperation in contrast with US and China's militarization of space and the moon.  Unfortunately the author decided to scratch what he's been building and start anew just before the story is about to reach climax."
futureporn,1ygepz,pundemonium,14,Fri Feb 21 15:17:52 2014 UTC,That's a nice handheld thruster he has. I hope he is good at coping with spins.
futureporn,1ygepz,cardinality_zero,8,Thu Feb 20 18:43:11 2014 UTC,"It's an awful beefy looking weapon. For propelling such small slugs, it's far too big. It actually looks like there's probably a spring system built into the gun to absorb recoil.  Also, his thruster pack could be computer controlled to keep him from flying around."
futureporn,1ygepz,Slukaj,7,Thu Feb 20 18:47:10 2014 UTC,"It actually looks like there's probably a spring system built into the gun to absorb recoil.   It will not help. The force will still be transfered to the person, just more slowly.   Also, his thruster pack could be computer controlled to keep him from flying around.    I was thinking about that. It would work."
futureporn,1ygepz,cardinality_zero,1 point,Thu Feb 20 19:08:29 2014 UTC,"It will not help. The force will still be transfered to the person, just more slowly.   Not necessarily: the springs and recoil system could be similar that of the KRISS Vector, which diverts recoil downward. Some clever engineering would let you divert the recoil in two opposite directions, so that any recoiling force from the gun is distributed across the frame."
futureporn,1ygepz,Slukaj,4,Thu Feb 20 19:19:40 2014 UTC,"No matter what, you are accelerating a slug of metal and ejecting it.  There must be a reaction.  Newton's Third Law.  This is middle school level physics."
futureporn,1ygepz,The_Dirty_Carl,2,Thu Feb 20 21:07:52 2014 UTC,And Newton's law also plays into the law of conservation of energy. You can convert that mechanical energy into thermal energy by dissipating vibrations into the frame of the weapon.   The equal and opposite reaction expects a perfect world where there is no such thing as material deformation. Physical reactions aren't perfect; every physical action loses energy in non-mechanical ways.
futureporn,1ygepz,Slukaj,3,Thu Feb 20 21:13:56 2014 UTC,*cough* conservation of momentum. Dude's going backwards. Unless it's 'recoilless' and lets gas out the back along with slug out the front.
futureporn,1ygepz,ZoFreX,2,Fri Feb 21 00:11:32 2014 UTC,"In a closed system, maybe. But you can lose some of that energy throw thermal radiation, assuming you figure out how to convert it efficiently."
futureporn,1ygepz,Slukaj,3,Fri Feb 21 01:42:46 2014 UTC,But you have to conserve both energy and momentum. It's not sufficient to merely conserve energy.
futureporn,1ygepz,ZoFreX,2,Fri Feb 21 11:26:00 2014 UTC,Energy is not momentum.
futureporn,1ygepz,Mr_Lobster,0,Fri Feb 21 04:07:27 2014 UTC,I didn't say it was.  But a change in momentum is an exertion of energy. And an impact between two objects with momentum is absolutely an exchange of energy.

futureporn,1ygepz,incestuous_vampire,1 point,Sat Feb 22 02:01:58 2014 UTC,"Just like there are imperfections in mechanical reactions, there are imperfections in converting one form of energy to another.

futureporn,1ygepz,Eddyill,2,Thu Feb 20 22:07:09 2014 UTC,Brakes transfer the car's momentum to the ground.  They generate very little thermal energy compared to the kinetic energy of the car.
futureporn,1ygepz,The_Dirty_Carl,3,Thu Feb 20 22:10:39 2014 UTC,"Good point, I didn't really think that through, and of course its impossible to lose the momentum since its conserved."
futureporn,1ygepz,Eddyill,1 point,Thu Feb 20 22:13:38 2014 UTC,"The Kriss vector still has recoil, it's just different. It counteracts the tendency for barrel rise and puts the recoil straight back."
futureporn,1ygepz,Fatumsch,2,Fri Feb 21 04:34:51 2014 UTC,I'm well aware. What I'm saying is that you could expand upon the concept.
futureporn,1ygepz,Slukaj,-1,Fri Feb 21 04:40:41 2014 UTC,"Not necessarily: the springs and recoil system could be similar that of the KRISS Vector, which diverts recoil downward.    Congradulations. Now your spining around your horizontal axis instead if vertical.   Some clever engineering would let you divert the recoil in two opposite directions, so that any recoiling force from the gun is distributed across the frame.   Highly doubtful."
futureporn,1ygepz,cardinality_zero,2,Thu Feb 20 20:30:43 2014 UTC,I disagree. There is no good reason why you can't just distribute that mechanical energy into the frame of the gun and letting the metal absorb the vibrations and turn it into heat.
futureporn,1ygepz,Slukaj,1 point,Thu Feb 20 20:37:43 2014 UTC,"This is conservation of momentum. Regardless of internal forces, m(1)v(1) = m(2)v(2)"
futureporn,1ygepz,Mr_Lobster,4,Thu Feb 20 22:37:48 2014 UTC,It's possible the gun has a set of linearly oscillating servos built in to counteract the force.
futureporn,1ygepz,FoxtrotZero,1 point,Thu Feb 20 23:42:52 2014 UTC,Maybe its electric? Shoots lasers or something?
futureporn,1ygepz,Colorfag,4,Fri Feb 21 05:42:22 2014 UTC,"You see the vents running down the barrel ? Those are small thrusters that counter act the bullet when fired. Thats why the gun is so large, room for the gas.   PS i have no idea."
futureporn,1ygepz,Pdfxm,3,Thu Feb 20 20:32:49 2014 UTC,"Maybe it's a laser? I feel like shooting at each other in space suits just seems dumb when you think about all the physics. plus one hit, just one would be like infinite backwards somersaults or a great counter measure system. or a suit breach which kills. Space combat would likely be really complicated with orbital trajectories and stuff.  Dat shit cray"
futureporn,1ygepz,Battletechnerd,5,Thu Feb 20 20:31:45 2014 UTC,"A laser would make more sense. It doesn't need an ignition source, it doesn't kick, and it most likely would be cheaper to produce."

Drag increases exponentially with speed. Even with your car driving on a highway, driving at 55mph is much more fuel efficient than driving at 80mph almost solely due to drag. Now picture going mach 6 (~4500mph). Look at ANY rocket EVER built and you will see they are designed aerodynamically to reduce atmospheric drag."
futureporn,1ygfkk,clee-saan,2,Fri Feb 21 18:43:59 2014 UTC,"so why bother building a hypersonic space vehicle   Because you'll need 7km/s of horizontal velocity to stay in orbit anyway, and it takes less fuel to build up that speed with a ramjet than with a rocket engine."

futureporn,1ybais,ethan_kahn,3,Wed Feb 19 04:29:27 2014 UTC,"source and a very nice story to add to the art from Robert Chew.  Prince William Sound, Alaska 2256.  EPA Patrol log AK-023-01 - Drone diving squad 02. Diver Jonathan Mckenzie   I was called out from Valdez today to investigate potential underwater pirating activity on the tanker route. The global oil crisis is really pushing people to extremes. As per EPA regulations I went as part of an independent investigation. The PMC's and private security handle actually dealing with the pirates. We were sent to monitor environmental conditions and check for any hazards to the water.  My fellow diver, Hernandez, and I were sent out with Agloolik, 1 of 2 of our Orca drones. Nuliajuk was in the dry dock for maintenance.   As we neared the target area the amount of oil in the water confirmed our fears that there indeed was a pirate attack in progress. We called in the incident to HQ and began surveying the area hoping all the while that we wouldn't become the next target.    Hey guys. Got my brain blasted by Black Fish. Then I did some research on the Exxon Valdez incident which occurred in 1989 and the Deepwater Horizon incident which happened back in 2010. Did some more research on the Alaska Oil Pipeline and I've always wanted to do something Alaskan since I went there earlier this year.  It was a lot of fun.  The Orca is a powerful underwater drone. The head is heavily armored with most of the sensitive electronics located further back towards the mid section. The body is dotted with ball cameras giving the drone near 360 degree view in all directions. These add to the drones impressive array of detection methods. The artificial muscle structures for underwater drones are much denser giving it the much needed strength to propel itself underwater. They work more efficiently when deployed in packs but are quite capable of working independently.   *For those who are curious Agloolik and Nuliajuk are Inuit sea deities."

Additionally, assuming there was such a wondermaterial, firing the gun would probably tip the thing over.

futureporn,1xo2xf,Triffgits,2,Wed Feb 12 02:53:42 2014 UTC,"That's not where the shock compression happens, it would be comparatively much cooler there. Most capsules don't even have that much protection in the areas behind the ablator, just a thin coating that burns off. I imagine the heat reflective thermal insulator that appears to be on the suit would actually work quite well, presuming there's some sort of passive insulation between that outer layer and the astronaut's skin."

futureporn,1xo2xf,AlanUsingReddit,10,Wed Feb 12 05:57:40 2014 UTC,"I'm thinking the idea here is that the suit prevents it, like a heat shield for any other reentry vehicle. It's fantastical, but makes for a cool looking concept."
futureporn,1xo2xf,chongoshaun,5,Wed Feb 12 13:18:15 2014 UTC,"There are somewhat close analogs entertained by NASA.  http://engineerinprogress.blogspot.com/2010/10/out-there-ideas-of-yesteryear.html  See, in particular:  http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_f5bp98CClTQ/TLVpwMVhjKI/AAAAAAAAAA4/hHVCcHC4pJA/s1600/moose1.jpg  These designs (lifeboats) were pretty out-there.  But there's no reason they could be done, and there's nothing that would obviously prevent something even more lightweight than this in the future.  When you get into it, the physics of the situation aren't all that obvious.  The sheer speed dictates that you're going to be running face-first into plasma-fied gas, but the actual heat terms and material damage depend on a lot of situation specific stuff.  The accelerations depend on mass to drag ratio, and this is wildly different for different craft."

futureporn,1xo2xf,sand500,0,Wed Feb 12 04:41:54 2014 UTC,"Two things (which are both just conjecture): In a suit like that, I imagine there would be much less ram pressure than in an actual re-entry vehicle, so it wouldn't get as hot as you'd think. Second, Even if it was an appreciable fraction of the temperature of current re-entry methods, I would think even a mediocre cooling system would keep the heat of the outside shell from transferring to the interior of the vehicle in the time it takes you to enter the atmosphere."
futureporn,1xo2xf,Bestwick,6,Wed Feb 12 16:02:24 2014 UTC,There are quite small objects that burn up in atmo all the time. Rocks and iceballs smaller than that suit.
futureporn,1xo2xf,pineconez,5,Mon Feb 24 03:46:39 2014 UTC,"This also depends on how fast they are going when they hit the atmosphere. Depends if its re-entry from a high altitude, from orbit, or from intersecting earth's orbit around the sun."

futureporn,1xo2xf,dannyjcase,2,Wed Feb 12 04:12:13 2014 UTC,"I would be less concerned about the heat and more about the shape. To survive a reentry (and hypersonic speeds in general), you need to be a very specific blunted shape. If you aren't (if you bolted an Ariane onto the Concorde, just to be silly), you'd burn up. The reasoning for the shape (of capsules, the shuttle etc.) is that it prevents contact between your craft and the shockwave/shock layer, which is the extremely hot bit of air (it more or less forces a cushion of cooler air between the two). The legs, arms and helmet of this suit might be a problem."
futureporn,1xo2xf,ZoFreX,-2,Wed Feb 12 05:39:50 2014 UTC,"I think if you were coming from a geostationary orbit you might be okay.  As Felix Baumgartner's jump reminded us, falling causes only a few degrees of heating - spaceships heat up on reentry because they are moving at orbital speeds through atmosphere, which compresses and therefore heats atmospheric gasses."
futureporn,1xo2xf,pineconez,7,Wed Feb 12 08:36:12 2014 UTC,"Geostationary orbit is MASSIVELY different to LEO. Just coming back to Earth will ramp up your relative velocity, and unless you have some sort way to slow your orbital speed down you'll probably hit the atmosphere faster than LEO anyway."
futureporn,1xo2xf,ZoFreX,1 point,Wed Feb 12 08:53:46 2014 UTC,This - the reason the shuttle gets so hot is because it has to shed several thousands of kilometers per hour of lateral speed. Dropping straight down is a very different prospect.
futureporn,1xo2xf,pineconez,2,Wed Feb 12 09:31:11 2014 UTC,"Go play Kerbal Space Program (or Orbiter) before talking about orbital mechanics. If you want to reenter from GEO, you will not drop straight down, and even if you did by some form of magic, you would be going blazing fast. The back of my envelope puts it somewhere around 25 km/s, which is more than three times as much as a reentry from LEO.  And yeah, sure, if you could enter the atmosphere at a comparably low speed, you wouldn't need a heatshield. But there's a reason we don't do that: such a maneuver would require the spacecraft to kill its lateral orbital velocity with thrusters (which is 7 km/s alone, or 70% of what you need to get into orbit in the first place) and an additional bit (call it 1 km/s) to control vertical speed. Your reentry capsule would be an entire launch vehicle. Compared to that, heat shields are cheap and simple."
futureporn,1xo2xf,ZoFreX,2,Thu Feb 13 22:27:01 2014 UTC,"Go play Kerbal Space Program (or Orbiter) before talking about orbital mechanics.   Um, thanks... I have played both, but my orbital mechanics knowledge is grounded in yknow... reality.   if you could enter the atmosphere at a comparably low speed, you wouldn't need a heatshield. But there's a reason we don't do that: such a maneuver would require the spacecraft to kill its lateral orbital velocity   That is precisely what I said.  It's called the felix re-entry suit. I assumed from the name it was 'designed' for a straight up / straight down jobbie."
futureporn,1xo2xf,pineconez,1 point,Wed Feb 12 08:13:11 2014 UTC,"my orbital mechanics knowledge is grounded in yknow... reality.   Which is reasonably approximated (although scaled down) by KSP and excellently simulated (for practical purposes, ignoring things like SR, GR, geoids...) in Orbiter.   I assumed from the name it was 'designed' for a straight up / straight down jobbie.   But from an orbital altitude, there is no such thing as a 'straight down'. Okay, fine, you might strap a rather huge rocket under your behind and travel straight up...if you had too much money and too little sense. But really, that's outlandish.  The original comment you were responding to mentioned coming down from GEO and failed to understand the only possible way to get down from there: kill your 3-and-spare-change km/s of orbital velocity, drop down. Unfortunately, while you're dropping, you'll accelerate to quite unhandy speeds (I made a mistake above; you'll be going at most 11 km/s, but that's still more than you'd be going during normal reentry). Also, dropping straight down (especially from as high up as GEO), you will have exactly zero chance of survival in an unpowered descent. Why? The atmosphere doesn't really exist above 100 km, and it doesn't really begin to break you until maybe around 40, 50 km. When you're travelling several kilometers per second, straight down, that's precious little air under your keel. You'll either burn up, be killed by the enormous g-forces (okay, hard to say, depends on mass-to-drag) or make a really neat little crater. Reentry without moving laterally or beefy retrorockets is a Bad Idea."
futureporn,1xo2xf,ZoFreX,1 point,Wed Feb 12 12:59:43 2014 UTC,"Wait, did I get something wrong... what would a straight up / straight down journey look like? Would the velocity be different from geostationary?"
futureporn,1xo2xf,Bishkip,1 point,Wed Feb 12 12:43:58 2014 UTC,"Okay, let's assume you teleport yourself to GEO, roughly 36000 km above the Earth's surface (you could also fly straight up until your apogee was at 36000 and then cut your engines).  You will then begin to drop straight down, continuously accelerated by Earth's gravity. Out there, it will be a lot less than it is down here, but that will, of course, increase as you get closer. And faster. Essentially, it's a very long fall. My calculation up there was wrong, by the way, approximating it as a fall from infinity you'd be travelling around 11 km/s. Still 3 km/s more than LEO speeds, and more than Apollo had to survive."
futureporn,1xo2xf,404_Find_Me,1 point,Thu Feb 13 22:22:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah, where I went wrong was assuming by geostationary we meant simply zero lateral motion relative to the earth's surface. I forgot that meant being so high up.  What I meant to say is that comparing two re-entries from the same height, if you had no lateral motion, you won't be dealing with anywhere near as much atmospheric friction."
futureporn,1xo2xf,subOpticglitch,-3,Fri Feb 14 01:48:33 2014 UTC,"AeroGel This is /r/Futureporn, it's not that abstract.  Also, heat is produced by air friction, we could create ways to negate that in the future."
futureporn,1xo2xf,skavier470,17,Fri Feb 14 03:41:34 2014 UTC,actually air friction contributes very little to the heat generated during re entry. The heat is a result of the air compression in front of of the object traveling at high speeds. The Air is compressed so fast that itrises to ridiculously high temperatures.
futureporn,1xo2xf,hoseja,-7,Fri Feb 14 01:49:43 2014 UTC,Actually. It is literally the friction from the compressed air that causes the heat.    The Air is compressed so fast that itrises to ridiculously high temperatures.   Soooo friction right? Yes.
futureporn,1xo2xf,Bishkip,6,Fri Feb 14 03:29:44 2014 UTC,"yes partly the major heat doesnt come from the friction, but from the air that cant escape fast enough, thus gets compressed, and giving of heat to the object... Ever touched an container for compressed gases after it let out some gas? cold right? thats the exact opposite effect, the gas decompresses and so can take more heat. So yea its due to friction."

futureporn,1w9qck,TheGreatCthulhu,56,Mon Jan 27 10:14:13 2014 UTC,Yeah... that galaxy is 'shopped. I live here and you're lucky when you get to see Venus. Fog generally happens in the morning though... never seen it at night.
futureporn,1w9qck,jherazob,12,Mon Jan 27 18:07:23 2014 UTC,"Description from the Flickr entry:   A little fantasy for today :)  Composite of a fog shot I took in Dubai from the Index Tower in May, and a Milky Way shot I took in Reunion Island in July.  Actually, it would be possible to see the Milky Way in Dubai during a foggy night, because the fog would retain the light pollution, so the stars and Milky Way (if it is above the horizon) would become much more visible. Therefore this composite is not pure science fiction."
futureporn,1w9qck,steik,18,Tue Jan 28 12:00:46 2014 UTC,"Long exposures can show things not visible to the naked eye. This image could very well be ""real"". If it is it's likely that the sky was a separate exposure from the cityscape and blended in. Very common technique for night shots, and does not classify as ""shopped"", which I'd interpret as outright fake (sky taken from another unrelated image completely)."

Cities just don't undergo changes like that. Unless we see a war that wipes one out, you'll just see the occasional ""futuristic"" building amongst the older architecture. Nobody is going to tear down half of Manhattan or Paris to achieve those kind of results, it's just too much of an undertaking, and unnecessary. New cities popping up with that much wealth available are rare, but maybe we'll see some more in the developing world. But unless there's mass bombings that level existing cities, allowing major reconstruction efforts, we probably won't see this stuff in our life times. Maybe in China and the Middle East and other developing nations. But I like that too. I hope in twenty years NYC has another new skyscraper or two, so that the newer stuff contrasts with the art deco and international architecture. That's the best stuff on this sub, the pictures of cities that look like they were built organically rather than sprouting straight out of the ground looking all shiny."
futureporn,1w9qck,afrustratedfapper,23,Mon Jan 27 18:41:30 2014 UTC,"While I see Dubai in these images as futuristic-looking, I don't consider it a city of the future.

However in the UAE is a test city called Masdar where they are building a carbon netutral city."

I'm not a regular follower of Stargate so I'm not up on all the criticism etc. (was Atlantis shelved in favor of Universe?), but compared to what Syfy fielded in exchange back in 2009, this was probably one of the last convulsions that they made before disappearing into obscurity. That channel is an endless parade of tragedy.   And for fucks sake, why not an SGU movie?"
futureporn,1w11wt,stormwolf3710,2,Sat Jan 25 11:31:08 2014 UTC,"Maybe SGU isn't bad on its own, but if you watched the other series as well, you must have noticed how it has a completely different tone: less action (and by less I mean barely anything happens), and more drama/soap opera.  Maybe they were trying to appeal to a larger audience, but they lost the old fans in the process. And, on the other hand, new viewers wouldn't understand some things without having watched the previous series.  In conclusion, they failed on all fronts."
futureporn,1w11wt,clee-saan,2,Sun Jan 26 20:22:57 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I hear from most Stargate aficionados. I really don't agree, I found SGU's character interaction much more appealing than previous incarnations. I was completely numbed by the one-dimensional military bravado/innovative clumsiness dynamic that dominated the other series. I grew up with the man, but O'Neill on SGU? Please God no. Sure, they did the same thing with Eli, Volker and all the other civilians, but with great, multi-dimensional characters like Rush and Young in the lead it didn't bother me one bit. It was far more mysterious and enticing to keep watching than say, Atlantis.   Second part of your criticism was unavoidable, same thing happened to Star Trek. Instead, here you had an absolutely fantastic, wet dream of a premise. SG fans lost their cool because ""wtf why isn't Young exactly like O'Neill or Sheppard"", and Syfy wasn't willing to cultivate SGU's potential if it didn't cash in big from the start. Unsurprising, it was eclipsed by Battlestar.   SGU didn't fail, it was in the wrong place at the wrong time, with the worst people deciding its fate. I really, really would have liked to see them come into their own. Instead, now the whole franchise is iced. Fucking Syfy."

futureporn,1vlbo2,holomanga,79,Sun Jan 19 17:59:05 2014 UTC,"The backstory from the guy who made it:   This is so out there it's embarrassing to even write it: basically as the world started to die off, a group of scientists biologists and technicians working secretly for the UN banded together to create a way that they could preserve the human race so that they could one day potentially revive the planet and continue living on in harmony. So with limited time and resources they created a bio-mechanical self regenerating life form that could essentially withstand any environmental conditions, and was strong, hardy and malleable enough to be up for the task of rebuilding a society where there was limited resources and accessible technology.  The development process took around 15 years and the production took another 5. They made as many of these things as possible in the given time frame. Somewhere around 500 or so and they selected the most suitable mental and physical candidates to have their minds and bodies transplanted inside these bio-mechanical forms. There were some military men, some scientists, mathematicians, and many underlings that could follow orders. This was meant to be a group that could rebuild out of the ashes and they were not chosen at random.  These host bodies are the liquid black things you see in a few of my pictures, they can shape shift, are very strong, fast and impervious to most forms of damage.  These people were placed in a series hidden stations located all around Europe and were put in human sized pods where their bodies would essentially be dissolved and merged with their respective bio-mechanical host. This process was very delicate and took over 100 years to complete.   After the hundred years was up the world was projected to be mostly a wasteland with few remaining human civilizations.  One man, who's name I have not thought of yet, let's call him V, awakes from his stasis chamber, fully transformed. He is weak and disoriented. His station is located in north western Russia. Upon getting his bearings and letting his memories come back to him he realizes that all the other pods have already opened and he can see clear evidence that some of his peers simply dissolved immediately upon exiting their pods where others left no trace as to their state of being.  He exits the station and begins wandering without any real cause. It seems the whole plan fell apart.   V is an interesting guy in that through his life as a human, he never could relate to other people, he felt like he was talking through them like they simply couldn't comprehend the things he found facinating and thought provoking.He grew apart from his wife and children and when the apocalypse rolled around he never even bothered to say goodbye to them. He just didn't care.   --Now I haven't thought too much about his character pre transformation but I'm expermenting with the idea that he had a girlfriend on the side, or some emotional connection to one woman in particular who may have some part to play post transformation--  He designed machines for a living and programmed artificial intelligence. He always admired his creations for their emotionless rational thought, their mimicry of the best parts of the human race combined with superior form and function unhindered by biological flaws.  His transformation into a bio-mechanical being liberated him from his old self. He fell in love with his new form and enjoyed the freedom the new world that his evolution granted him. Over time he wondered less and less about the earths remaining human population and the goal to seek them out receded to the back of his mind in favor of new discoveries. However, deep down he is still human and he could feel the sting of loneliness creep into his thoughts. This was a contradiction to his newly acquired ideals. Finding companionship amongst human crowds (if there were any left) was not a pleasant thought and there was no notion of what happened to the others from the station.   He resolved to pick up his old career of creating artificial life. He found various decommissioned androids in various states of disrepair throughout the wastes. In old barns, burnt out villages. In a number of instances he discovered pits where the machines had been stripped of their useful bits and then thrown into piles and covered haphazardly with dirt. That was a strange sight.   Near a flooded field that may have once been used for growing crops he found a surprisingly intact female android laying partially submerged in water. She was missing some essential components but otherwise she would make for easy repairs.  Now this is kind of where this ""story"" starts. He repairs her and uses himself as her power source until a suitable battery can be found or created. He grows fond of her for all the reasons he loves machines and dislikes humanity. But as time progresses and she learns more about the world around her she starts to develop a personality. She is inquisitive, naive, and clingy. As the two grow together they eventually grow apart. He wants to learn from her how to become less human, she wants to learn from him how to become more human."

The titan arum's inflorescence is not as large as that of the talipot palm, Corypha umbraculifera, but the inflorescence of the talipot palm is branched rather than unbranched.  Due to its odor, which is reminiscent of the smell of a decomposing mammal, the titan arum is characterized as a carrion flower, and is also known as the corpse flower, or corpse plant (Indonesian: bunga bangkai – bunga means flower, while bangkai can be translated as corpse, cadaver, or carrion). For the same reason, the title corpse flower is also attributed to the genus Rafflesia which, like the titan arum, grows in the rainforests of Sumatra.

futureporn,1uwhed,jWalkerFTW,1 point,Sat Jan 11 18:27:43 2014 UTC,"I thought it was the Infinity at first, but after closer examination, I don't think it is. judging by the shadow its casting, its right above that building on the right, which isn't too far from the people at the bottom, so the ship is much smaller than the infinity. Also, if those pelicans are as close to it as they look, than we can use them for scale as well. No way that that ship is 5.6 kilometers.  I could be wrong of course, and everything is up for speculation at this point, so really nothing is out of the question."

I think its much more efficient to pump water up to higher levels as needed - ie though a hose delivery system - than it is to lift the whole tank of water up and down and then deliver the water though a shorter hose. So I think that while this looks cool, it wouldn't be designed as such, I think the water tanks would stay on the ground in a rolling (or walking) transportation structure and the upper parts would be much more lighter. Nice work though!"

futureporn,1unorm,lodvib,12,Tue Jan 7 22:28:47 2014 UTC,"From an architectural perspective, it's actually almost backwards in a way.  HVAC vents on the side, open sewer into a canal with a little access dock right near by, very Brutalist.  It doesn't scream ""advanced"" to me.  It strikes me as a culture that certainly was way more advanced then our own but then somehow fell a ways.  I mean, the large skyscrapers in the back look impressive as well, but that's largely perspective.  Low position, shooting up, tight angle, you could probably get something similar in a modern city if you chose your location well.   Honestly I think that's exactly what the artist was going for though, or at least like to think so.  That whole ""ugly underbelly of the modern world"" sort of feel.  It's certainly interesting, but I don't see anything offhand that shouts ""technological advanced.""  We could build that building now, but we wouldn't because it's a very bad idea."

No skyscrapers, no subways, no cars, no freeways, no electric lighting, etc. I can't see any reason that we won't make similar kinds of advances in the future. So yes, I think this is possible.

During the time we were there crumbling plaster, cockroaches and stained mattresses were pretty typical.  Do your research and make reservations ahead of time.  Our first time there we didn't have reservations and the first place we found with a vacancy offered us a ""room"" that was literally a closet with a wad of dirty blankets piled on the floor in one corner. It had a door, but it didn't lock.  We kept looking around and found an actual room available a few stories up. It was so small that if you stretched out spread-eagle on the bed like you were making a snow angel you could touch all four walls, but at least it had a bed, and a working electric light.

You are right, LucasArts does not exist anymore in a capacity to start the project up again, but its not like they just threw away all the assets and documents regarding the game. Disney just needs to licence a game studio to make the game and hand over the assets."
futureporn,1tsadq,justaguyx,4,Fri Dec 27 13:10:09 2013 UTC,All depends on what state the project documentation is in. Sometimes it's much easier to start from scratch.
futureporn,1tsadq,SpiderFnJerusalem,3,Fri Dec 27 13:23:42 2013 UTC,"They have an engine, a demonstration of the engines capabilities was made very recently actually. I doubt starting from scratch would be better :)"
futureporn,1tsadq,justaguyx,2,Fri Dec 27 16:15:12 2013 UTC,I hope you're right. But even if this project stays dead for just 1.5 years the technology might already be obsolete.
futureporn,1tsadq,SpiderFnJerusalem,1 point,Fri Dec 27 16:25:35 2013 UTC,Not true. Game engines do not go obsolete in a few years.
futureporn,1tsadq,justaguyx,2,Fri Dec 27 16:56:22 2013 UTC,"They are optimized for the most common technological standards expected at the time of release though.   They will need to be updated in order to stay competitive. And depending on what the actually completed ingame assets look like a lot of things may have to be changed.   Can be a bit of work, can be a lot of work. But all of it costs money."
futureporn,1tsadq,SpiderFnJerusalem,3,Fri Dec 27 17:26:24 2013 UTC,The only problem is that the game was supposed to be rated M. I doubt Disney would want to put out anything with that rating. As a matter of fact they only have three or so games with a T rating. It was supposed to be Star Wars' first M rated game but I don't see Disney putting out a game like that ever.   http://kotaku.com/5979143/disney-ceo-vows-to-examine-the-companys-violent-video-games-if-any-exist

So what if there was a choice of two or three different actions or slightly different paths to get something, it was still a very directed path for everything I saw. And then I got bored and dropped it, after I couldn't get to or through a place because i didnt want to do exactly the path the game designers set up. Kinda reminded me of the old ""kings quest"" games where you had to jump at exactly the right moment, or have exactly the right item ready at a specific time...

Compared to what made it into game things are also mirrored strangely. the mark on Adam's forehead, and scar on his eye are on the opposite side of his head, and judging by the way his couch is facing and where the windows are placed in relation to it it's clear that the final lay out of his apartment wasn't yet locked down.  He's also missing the weird metal bits around his eyes that hold his retractable cyber-man sunglasses, but that's likely because early in production the developers decided the player should be going to L.I.M.B. clinics to get new augmentations installed rather than what they ended up with which is every augmentation is technically installed in his body at the start of the game but players earn ""praxis points"" to activate them as they progress through the game, so it's likely they didn't anticipate having the eye bits installed when the player starts out."

futureporn,1sxgmv,UltraByt3,2,Sun Dec 15 12:04:32 2013 UTC,"""There..you...go!"" I bit hard on the gag as, with a tug and a squelch, the surgeon's forceps jerked free from my shoulder. Behind me, I heard a pip as what she'd extracted fell into one of the steel pans she kept on carts lining the operating table. ""That's the last one.""  Finally, I thought, and voiced my relief by sighing loudly. Six hours is a long time to have an old lady cutting into various large muscle groups and pulling things out without anesthetic. The whiskey helped, though, when she wasn't stealing the bottle for a swig. Still, I might've squeaked a complaint or two as she jabbed a series of stitches into the wound, working to sew the insides together before the outsides, hands flying in my peripheral vision like some wiry granny flyweight boxer working an invisible light-bag.  ""Oh, hush. Sit up, and stop your moaning."" She cut her thread and swatted my buttocks, and I yelped. She'd struck right over the bandage from another of her extractions. With painful difficulty, I shifted to sitting on my sore ass and groaned as the woman wrapped a cloth around so it pressed on the stitched-up ""Now, squeeze this tight and keep your arm still! I've got to see to some business in the front. Keep quiet back here, and if you're a good boy, you'll get a lollipop from Doctor when she gets back.""  The Doc could be really condescending when she wanted to. It wasn't until after she'd left and bolted the door to her soundproofed surgery behind her that I realized she wasn't going to be back to ungag me or undo the cuffs on my wrist or the hobble holding me to the operating table by my ankles for another few hours at least. No other options left to me, I held the bandage like she'd said and glared at the door.  .....................................................................................  She was back four hours later, pressed and dressed like a respectable surgeon of her age should at her exclusive cosmetic practice, and carrying a shopping bag from a quite elite line of retailers. She dropped it at the foot of the table, and I peered inside as she undid the hobble from around my ankles. My clothes, my multitool, my book--not exactly high-end-retailer fare, but I was happier to see those than I would have been with anything else.  ""Sorry about the wallet, dear, but you know they keep tracers in all the credchips nowadays. I gave it to Sunny. She'll find a way to get you scrip for your money's worth on whatever was in there. The Nique-D ticks on your tools have been zorched, too."" She unclasped the handcuffs, and I pulled at the knot holding the gag in my mouth. The surgeon pulled my book from the bag and leaned on the operating table, flipping through. I grunted protest as I fought with the gag, but she rolled her eyes at me.  ""Kid, I'm more'n twice your age. That means whatever's in here I've done at least once and seen at least twice as often as you have."" She thumbed through the pages. ""Not many people go in for biomat books anymore, though. It was a good choice. We had to scrap--""  ""My comm! Where's my comm?"" I searched the pockets of the pants I had pulled on, then the coat.  ""I was just saying, we had to scrap your comm. The Nique-D tick-codes are embedded in the function coding on all mobile devices nowadays--no more little metal bugs to be picked off and squashed. As for the clothes--""  Realization dawned as I put my hands in my pockets and found no hole in the corner.  ""This isn't my coat.""  I felt violated. which was odd given the night I'd just spent naked and chained in an old woman's soundproofed operating theater.  ""As for the clothes, we planted them on a body-double along with the contents of your wallet and we sent the poor bastard on a long walk off a short pier."" She must've seen my jaw drop, because she rolled her eyes and fixed me with a look. ""He was a volunteer. Dead already, and had donated his body to science. What're doctors if not scientists?""  Then, I felt bad. I wasn't surprised at the use of another man's corpse to fake my death, and nothing morally questionable the Doc would do could faze me.  ""My wallet?"" The only picture I have of her was in that wallet. ""Everything from it is gone?""  ""Just the important things. I managed to pilfer this before they sent your pal 'you' for a swim."" The surgeon slipped a hand into her coat and pulled out my wallet. My actual, leather wallet. ""Not many people go for biomat cases anymore. I figured a synth replacement would serve our 'you' just as well as this one.""  I immediately flipped it open and there, in the little plastic window of the billfold, was her smiling face. Natalie.  ""Thank you."" I stood suddenly, and found myself hugging the wiry old woman. She stiffened under my grip, but then softened and patted my back. When I let her go, I couldn't decide if she towered over me like a powerful protector or stooped before me like a frail but loving grandmother. Perhaps both.  ""Now,"" she said, patting my shoulder and thrusting my multitool into my hand. ""Knock 'em dead.""  I shook her hand and pocketed the tool.  ""Oh,"" she said as I reached the doorway. I turned to see her digging in her purse. ""I almost forgot."" The surgeon rummaged and produced something small--a red disk on a white stick. A lollipop.  She laughed as she gave it to me, and punched my shoulder over the bandage as I turned to leave again. I yelped and she snorted.  ""Knock 'em dead for me.""  ""Oh, I will. For all of us.""  ........................................................................................  Outside, it was raining. I kept close to the buildings, slinking along under awnings as I walked. No one looked at me twice--a good sign for someone whose face had been all over all the newsfeeds for the last month and a half. I took a turn that would lead through the industrial quarter to the business district, and found myself without sidewalk.  Normally, the tracers in my unique ID-bugs, the Nique-D ticks, would've alerted local auto-traffic that a pedestrian was in the street. Normally, the automated vehicles would've stopped for me as I crossed their paths. But today was not a normal day.  The first auto detected me not as a person, but a path obstruction, and gave me such a narrow berth as it leapt over me that I could feel the heat off its propulsors. It blared a single irritated honk before its suddenly-changed  trajectory sent it through a stop-signal and into the traffic interchange on the corner, where another auto t-boned it and they both fell to the ground in a roaring of propulsors and squealing of scraping fiberglass.  I stood, frozen in the middle of the street, unable to look away from the accident. Around me, all the other autos continued along their paths like nothing had happened, those on my street carefully correcting their courses to whizz past as harmlessly as flies. Then I heard the sirens.  I grimaced--it was only a matter of time before Corrections found me. Removing Nique-D ticks and getting vid-recog-scrambling invisible tattoos on your face might hide you for a few months if you were lucky, but I'd just caused a traffic accident. No doubt Corrections had looked into the autos' vidcorders to see what had happened, seen me, and run a manual lookup of my face. Or, hell, maybe human personnel had remembered me from a newsfeed. Either way, I was screwed. I turned to face the oncoming Corrections cruisers.  They passed me by like all the other autos.  I was invisible to them. Just like I was to the other autos, I was invisible to the Corrections cruisers without my Nique-D and trackers. An obstacle, not a man. And I intended to make myself as much an obstacle to Corrections as possible."

Cybersyn was the result of a project to find an alternative means to run the economy, and eventually a British professor named Stafford Beer was hired. Beer had ideas of networking computers & telex machines together in order to co-ordinate the data in real time and have as much as possibly be cybernetically managed and automated, rather than having central planners manipulating and guessing at things.  It was rather ahead of its time and reasonably successful, although Beer found that there were often disputes between the various programmers and scientists developing the program as to the size, scale, and extent of the program. It was still very much in the prototyping and development stage when the coup by Augusto Pinochet occurred, whose dictatorship essentially scrapped the entire program along with the staff behind it."
futureporn,1qaevh,Yazman,34,Sun Nov 10 12:03:00 2013 UTC,"It actually managed to resolve peacefully a massive trucker strike orchestrated by the United States to destabilize the Socialist president in Chile.   Basically the truckers blocked most highways, and Cybersyn was employed to implement distribution models and maximize the efficiency of the remaining routes (most of them small roads) making the whole strike and major highways blockades pointless.   Shortly after that when the U.S. saw that those ""subtle"" tactics weren't going to work they were a bit more direct and directly backed Pinochet to seize the country through extreme violence and bloodshed. One of the first things Pinochet's de facto government did was to destroy Cybersyn, and I mean destroying it literally. He sent soldiers to tear it apart.

futureporn,1qaevh,Yazman,14,Sun Nov 10 13:17:39 2013 UTC,"It's a real shame too, it was certainly a promising model - it would be interesting to see the developments had the US not overthrown the government with Pinochet."
futureporn,1qaevh,Taure,-8,Sun Nov 10 13:27:02 2013 UTC,"The US didn't actually back Pinochet. They had backed a failed coup a few months before, and another failed one a few years before that, but Pinochet came as a bit of a surprise. They thought he was loyal to Allende.  Of course, this doesn't mean that the US weren't very happy about Pinochet coming to power."
futureporn,1qaevh,Arcosim,8,Sun Nov 10 14:22:24 2013 UTC,"That's not true, Pinochet was politically, financially and strategically supported by the CIA's Operation Condor, like many other right wing dictators in Latin America.   Also some of Pinochet's most important lietenaunts, like Manuel Contreras and Raul Iturriaga were trained by U.S. forces and operatives in Fort Benning, Georgia, in the so called School of the Americas.

Obviously the rotar blades are meant for flying but it looks like they also double as wheels. Maybe the legs curl up and it can move on wheels utilizing the gun on its back.  Then the pilot is only vulnerable from underneath.

My comment is not meant to bash on you, rather to understand your reasoning. I like your piece.  I find it a gorgeous piece of computer graphics, but the question arising in my mind as a former architecture student is: do the guys doing those pieces have any architectural background?  Your composition seems based on volumes, and yet they look quite messy, meshed togheter with no significant value other than facade design.   The roofs seem to be covered in solar panels, yet they are on the lower surface of the roof as well where they won't be very effective (this stuff costs money). On a scale perspective the roof seems very thick. With new materials coming up and such, i would expect to find a thin roof, specially in a warm place like malibu. It seems made out of concrete, only, if it were, than i doubt it could stay on its feets: structurally, you could draw tangents along the curves composing the roof and you would see how the weight is getting discharged where there is nothing to hold it up. I think that to get this shell system working without having huge lateral walls or pilons you should revert the shells orientation and mount them on a central thick spine, with a concept very similar to the one used by architect Adalberto Libera in the ""Palazzo della Regione"", Trento (Italy).   You could preserve the Armadillo looking adding some flow to the composition curving the spine along its length, which would allow for more angles and rooms looking at the seaside.  The roof structure could be made lighter using a wood frame instead of concrete, onto which solar panels can be mounted.  Using a graphic to calculate sun exposition would lead you to the right curves and length of the roof.  From a theme perspective, there are 2 identities clashing in my opinion and you could tell me if it is wanted or not: you have a ""monolitical"" identity with the 2 -iron looking- blocks, the main white structure and the central glass tower and the scattered identity with the shells concept. I am not sure these should be meshed in the same architecture. I think using just one of the two concepts would add to the end result.  Often times while projecting we stumble onto lot of good ideas and in the end being able to purge the project from all the good ones but a single one is the hardest yet most successful way to go.

But where to start...unfortunately I'm not the artist of this piece (or really for any stuff I post) I just dump some cool stuff here that I find online. I do try to credit the original artist, but for this one a reverse image search yielded no  luck for original source (not like I'm going to spend hours searching though).  So I just made up a title that I thought sounded cool- apparently most people thought it was shit- but hey what can you do.   Anyway, back to  your comments...brilliant analysis.  I agree about meshing the two forms of architecture- at first it looks really cool, but once you say that I look back and it's sort of a mashy hybrid.  The solar/ curvature stuff was interesting too, you know your shit I learned a lot reading that.  Well have to go to work.  Thanks for comment, I really liked the last one too but wasn't sure how serious you were.  Oh some Mod deleted that post, btw, because I linked to imgur and not deviant art. Even though I linked DA gallery and artist in comments. Ha so I left no artist name or link for this one, apparently that's a safer way to post."

futureporn,1oksro,iongantas,1 point,Mon Oct 21 03:55:01 2013 UTC,"It's not a name at all, it's a catalog of all the known nearby stars (within 25 parsecs of us). Kind of like the Messier or NGC catalogs of deep sky objects. The Andromeda galaxy isn't named ""Messier"", it is #31 in the Messier catalog so it is often referred to as M31 or Messier 31.  When a star has a name like Sirius or a Bayer designation like Alpha Centauri, we usually use that rather than a catalog number (Gliese 244 and Gliese 559 respectively). But many dimmer stars do not have a name, so we have to refer to them by catalog number. For example, Gliese 667, MLO 4, and HD 156384 are the same star, in three different catalogs (Gliese, Melbourne Observatory, and Henry Draper).  So 'Mining on Gliese' is not a good title, as Gliese is not the name of any star or planet."

If you can slow a projectile down below the velocity it needs to stay in orbit (about 28,000 kilometres per hour), it will come crashing down to Earth at an incredible speed. Depending on the materials used to make the projectile (Osmium would be best, as it's the densest element) and how aerodynamic it is (a more aerodynamic shot will be slowed down by the atmosphere less, and will hit the target with greater force) you could hit a target with the force of a small nuclear weapon.

futureporn,1ode2w,ztfreeman,9,Mon Oct 14 00:46:31 2013 UTC,"I've had this discussion with someone else on Reddit before, but point one is that England actually has a ton of guns laying around.  Rifles and some shotguns are allowed in the countryside and the military and special police squads (their version of SWAT teams) are also well armed.  Point two, the controversial bit, is that bullets aren't hard to make.  Sure, these days there are all sorts of fancy custom made ammo that's hyper aerodynamic and can punch through body armor and do all sorts of nasty damage. But your plain jane FMJ of the most common calibers can be hand made relatively easily using really easily acquired ingredients.  Most hunters I know actually do this to save a buck and they get to custom load the shot for a little extra power.  Getting an old hand press to reload spent cartridges isn't that expensive, and can be used in the process for personal use. (though it isn't necessary, you can use a hammer and do it the hard way).   If you get real desperate, you can go all late 18th century and piss in a bucket then boil it down to make the key ingredients for some rudimentary shot.  During the Napoleonic wars it was common for someone to go around and collect all of the piss pots for the process to keep up with the demand for ammo.    So yeah, I'm never sure why post apocalyptic settings don't have guns ether.  Though honestly, a bow and arrow requires a lot less chemistry to maintain and can be a lot quieter, so it has its benefits as a both a hunting and defense tool."
futureporn,1ode2w,FrederikMeyer,2,Mon Oct 14 05:25:32 2013 UTC,"Especially when you consider that the knowledge of industrialization doesn't just vanish into thin air.  One good library or one working computer that someone backed up Wikipedia onto is all it would really take to start automating existing hand-presses and other machine tools and not only start pumping out bullets by the crate load but guns would follow soon after.  Whatever that NBC show they had for a while made my head spin, like within a few months most of the world would have been back to normal, they'd just have to deal with the economic crash of mystical technology not working BS.  The only post-apocalyptic world that actually did this right is Fallout.  In Fallout, they get manufacturing back on track in the NCR.   They started machining their own guns, everyone has scavenged firearms that they've made work on their own, and in New Vegas you can scavenge spent cartridges and machine your own ammo."

Such a simple idea but it made the game that much more memorable. The city was clean and futuristic looking, despite the fact that most of the buildings resembled ones in a lot of cities around the world, all that was different was the colour. Thanks for the pic, OP."

Even though it gives you a competitive advantage, it puts you on the same level as the cops going after you. What makes you special is that you can outmaneuver and outsmart the cops/krugers. If you play the entire game without holding a gun, you'll see how hard it is and how rewarding it can be. The max i did was disarm the enemy."

futureporn,1ny7di,nihilion_Zero,2,Tue Oct 8 13:48:15 2013 UTC,What doesn't make sense? It's a naval shipyard.
futureporn,1ny7di,nihilion_Zero,6,Tue Oct 8 17:48:34 2013 UTC,"I don't issue with the 'naval' aspect. It's just that it doesn't look at all appropriately sized to be serving ships as large as that super star destroyer in the back, and then the structure itself.. what's with the super huge fin shaped tower? Why would you build a station like that? I imagine the elevators are constantly jammed. That arm in the front would get torqued by docking ships. Maybe it's built of super tough and resilient materials that can handle that. But why? It's just soft science fiction. Everything is meant to look cool but not really concerned with any kind of practical explanation."
futureporn,1ny7di,actionslacks,2,Tue Oct 8 21:03:46 2013 UTC,"I'm guessing the ""naval"" part doesn't make sense."
futureporn,1ny7di,actionslacks,0,Tue Oct 8 18:55:26 2013 UTC,"I think it makes sense that the navy would operate warships in space as well as on sea, don't you? There's a lot more overlap than with army or air force. Even the terminology used in current space programs is naval in origin (walls are bulkheads, doors are hatches, floors are decks, personnel are crew, etc.)."
futureporn,1ny7di,djsumdog,2,Tue Oct 8 19:23:35 2013 UTC,"I mean, certain ship parts being named similarly I understand, because they are both vessels. But I feel like a station in space should be called a spacestation, not a navalstation."
futureporn,1ny7di,Pinballx,1 point,Tue Oct 8 19:50:56 2013 UTC,Well it's a naval space station I suppose. It would generate confusion if the current seabound navy continued to exist.

We’re very excited about it at the studio and I wanted to let you know that most of the team behind Deus Ex: Human Revolution is already working hard on this new game. It took us four years to learn how to create a unique Deus Ex experience with Human Revolution and it was important for me to keep this knowledge within the franchise.  I want to leave you with a piece of concept art from our next-gen Deus Ex game that shows trans-humanism segregation, which is a backdrop to our vision for the next Deus Ex. It represents a ""ghetto-city' voluntarily built in order to separate the classes. The people in this segregated class have reshaped their environment, nostalgic for their ideal of Cyber Renaissance. This dark and dystopian vision sets the tone for things to come in Deus Ex.   So... yes, this is the sequel ""I/We"" have been waiting for, although there is no info at all other then this artwork (we don't even have a name for it.)"

If it's rehosted from one of our approved hosts (like deviantart, cghub, etc), yes the rehost should be removed. I personally couldn't find it, just a bunch of wikis and wallpaper websites.

A lot of stuff had the American spelling rather than the English spelling. The scenes in the tube were hugely inaccurate as well but I guess that one was mainly because they shot on location I think. Oh we've also apparently abandoned the Monarchy as its refered to as the United Federation of Great Britain. However, don't even get me started on the fact that Obama was on British money money....  The whole film felt like it should have been set in America but at the last minute they thought ""oh maybe we shouldn't portray ourselves as the oppressive, totalitarian country"", instead they decided to make some reference to Britains empire and imperial past where we've subjugated Australia again and refer to it as ""The Colony"" rather than...you know...Australia."

I think it does the whole paranoia, altered states and 'whats real' i.e the construction and breakdown of personal identity (which are common themes in Phillip K Dicks books) is done better in this version than the Schwarzenegger version. The idea that to escape a burnt out, run down, war ravaged earth people go on chemical trips to escape their tedious lives. I never really felt that in the Arnie version. The visuals were brilliant as well."

futureporn,1lvc5q,CommanderpKeen,5,Fri Sep 6 23:28:12 2013 UTC,This is awesome.  Can someone smarter than me tell me if this design is actually feasible?
futureporn,1lvc5q,OhSoMexicellent,29,Fri Sep 6 20:25:08 2013 UTC,"No. Any purpose it would serve could either be served by a conventional carrier, or is made impossible because of the gigantic size.  The energy and time it would take to maneuver that thing under water would be insane. A conventional carrier already has that problem, and look at how little of that is actually in the water. Ships, and especially submarines are very slim and elongated, which they are for a reason.  As a kind of extension to the square-cube law ( increase an object's dimensions, and its surface area increases by the square of the multiplier, and its weight increases by the cube of the multiplier), the strength of an object does not scale with its size. Basically, the bigger something gets, the more fragile it becomes.  We have seen ships at least as big as in the concept art, but nothing that had to deal with its entire surface being covered in water. I'm not going to do the math (it's called beam theory if you're curious) but I have a hard time imagining that something as massive could successfully navigate submerged and not either be ripped apart.  I have no idea what I'm talking about btw, just guessing in a plausibly sounding manner."
futureporn,1lvc5q,maxout2142,5,Fri Sep 6 21:27:57 2013 UTC,"Also all forms of stealth would be shot due to its size. Its shape would cause so much turbulence in the water, you could hear it for hundreds of miles."
futureporn,1lvc5q,OhSoMexicellent,3,Fri Sep 6 23:16:00 2013 UTC,It could be used to avoid ground air fire.

futureporn,1lvc5q,Eskali,2,Sat Sep 7 01:42:56 2013 UTC,"I misworded that, I meant stealth in the water, like from sonar detection. Was millennium games the one where they redid it because the ""opposing team"" used guerrilla style warfare and low tech systems?"
futureporn,1lvc5q,Eskali,2,Sat Sep 7 02:28:23 2013 UTC,"yeah, they destroyed them so thoroughly and fast the US navy commander said lets refloat it and force them to a script so we can get some training out of it at least.  Size =/= Sonar return, see Ohio Class.  Also given a battle group of other Submarines acting in concert with the Carrier, any Sub that activates its Active Sonar is just asking to be blown out of the water.  Plus it would be invisible to Satellite."
futureporn,1lvc5q,juhae,6,Sat Sep 7 02:39:46 2013 UTC,"We'll, Aircraft Carriers are EXTREMELY vulnerable to a massive missile strike, if the US was to face a prospect of war with a large advanced military Submarine aircraft would give an extreme edge. Giving that it was already done on a much smaller scale with the I-400 it could be scaled up.  It wouldn't be as large as a Supercarrier(American carriers are massively larger than other normal Carriers) but it could definitely be the size of a VTOL carrier."
futureporn,1lvc5q,Eskali,7,Sat Sep 7 01:42:14 2013 UTC,"That's why carrier fleets are protected by a layered air defence system. First aircraft (early warning and combat air patrol), then area defence missiles, followed by point defense missiles, and finally close-in weapon system (radar controlled gatling guns etc.)  Very few nations have the capacity to mount long-range anti-shipping operations (either by air-to-surface missiles or cruise missiles). Sure, you can possibly get a random lucky shot with an Exocet, but you'll be blown away from the sky before you can say ""miaow"" by the air defence systems. In addition to the missile most likely being shot down."

futureporn,1lvc5q,dabakos,10,Sat Sep 7 01:48:00 2013 UTC,"That design, no. The design is far too large.  Technically, a modern submarine ""carrier"" would be feasible, however. Something similar in size to a modern SSBN (Ballistic Missile submarine, ie Ohio or Typhoon class) that, instead of missile tubes, carry launch facilities for drones - drones don't require a human pilot and can therefore be built to a size that can be launched from a submarine carrier.  Said drones could be launched either vertically through vertical launch tubes from a submerged submarine, or VTOL-style from a surfaced vessel.  With satellite communications, or directed by a local special forces team, the drones would no longer need the submarine for guidance.  The big issue is recovery. Landing on a submarine would require the submarine to surface, something few sub captains want to do. Recovering through other means, for example with a submerged craft, would not necessarily be unfeasible, but it'd be a difficult task that would require a lot of development time and cost. It would also put the submarine at risk, as an enemy could track the drone to its landing site and prepare a retaliatory strike."
futureporn,1lvc5q,anarchy8,4,Sat Sep 7 09:06:57 2013 UTC,"That's pretty awesome, but what happens to the planes when they submerge?"
futureporn,1lvc5q,Fencemuffin,24,Fri Sep 6 20:08:15 2013 UTC,I assume they're put back into the carrier. Aircraft carriers typically have elevators.

Ringworld was the size of Earth's orbit - stretching around a star, the Orbitals relatively smaller but still millions of kilometers in diameter. Both importantly have walls containing the atmosphere tens of kilometers in height.  Elysium by comparison is more like a space station in scale. The walls looks like maybe 100-200 meters high. The pressure from the air Elysium would be able to contain would be much too low for breathing. Think of how far it is from sea level to space, that's the kind of air pillar you need for an open-to-space design. Earth is open to space..."

This is stupid for two reasons: 1) all the leaders of Elysium have to do is reset the mainframe back to excluding the Earth people from Elysium citzenship and/or recalling the medical ships back to the space station, and 2) if all it took to cure every person on Earth from sickness and injury were medical ships with magic healing pods, why didn't the people of Elysium do that?

By what pictures I've seen (I haven't seen the film), Elysium looks a little far off from any of  the Lagrangian points of the Earth and Moon, but too far away to be in cis-lunar space.  I'm not fully convinced the design is correct though, since the Bishop ring suggested atmosphere retention walls about 120 miles in height. However, someone suggested there could be ""active air pressure sprays"" that ""contain its recycling atmosphere"".  To be fair, though, it is just a film. :P"

Alternate theory: The new ocean eroded away the hills and this is actually thousands of years into the future. Though most of the casinos would not last even 100 years so the landmarks are probably replicas.  Edit: Proof. Notice those hills? They surround Vegas in all directions.  Final theory: The city of Las Vegas leveled the surrounding valley and used the dirt to raise the city's altitude in response to Global Climate change."

futureporn,1kd96v,JabbrWockey,28,Wed Aug 14 19:58:54 2013 UTC,"It's a matter of perspective. The Citadel is extremely huge and each arm is really wide from what I saw in the games.  In my field of view, most of the buildings I am looking down on will look as if they are parallel.  Also from looking at each arm at either side where the concave is more apparent, you see how grid-based the design is with large rectangular sections with bright orange streetlights dividing them.  These sections are on a very flat surface, zero curvature, even though they are on a concave.    So I assume each arm together forms a polygon instead of a cylinder.  In the picture, I'm looking down towards the center and I happen to be standing in the middle of a section so all the buildings around me are indeed parallel."
futureporn,1kd96v,50000_FLYING_DILDOS,8,Wed Aug 14 20:43:04 2013 UTC,It is a matter of perspective - that's exactly what I'm talking about.  The buildings on the edge of the arm are exactly parallel with the buildings in the middle.  The 1 G centrifugal force generated by the spinning of the O'Neil cyclinder would require the buildings to raise on an angle towards the center like spokes on a wheel - not perfectly parallel to each other as they are in the illustration.  The buildings in the right side of the picture would feel like a slanted floor in a fun-house.

futureporn,1ihbup,elevendayempire,1 point,Wed Jul 17 12:14:52 2013 UTC,"Very very much depends on the artist and his workflow.. For a seasoned professional concept artist well trained in landscapes, it might take around 2-6 hours (they're usually disgustingly fast and have many workarounds for achieving looks that might take otherwise a couple additional hours). Feng Zhu, Jama Jurabaev, Thomas Scholes, Sparth, Jaime Jones to name a few illustrators.  The time frame for an artist that possibly hasn't reached that level of efficiency, or is not used to landscapes can be anywhere from 8 to 20+ hours."

I own one of their books from 1983: ""Zicht op de toekomst: De wereld 80 jaar verder"", which loosely translates to ""Sight on the future: The world 80 years from now"".   It's full of these types of drawings (though not this one) and predictions such as the changing importance of certain resources (e.g. coal, uranium) over time and the growth of the global population.  Most of the stuff you'll find about them will be in Dutch. I'm happy to try and help anyone that is interested find out more."

futureporn,1hgeuv,BlazeUp,0,Thu Jul 4 19:03:42 2013 UTC,"Not soon, by any means, but the Greenland or West Antarctic ice sheets are more than capable of causing this drastic a rise. They will both absolutely detach if no drastic change happens to address global warming."
futureporn,1hgeuv,LeonardNemoysHead,6,Thu Jul 4 20:25:46 2013 UTC,"Even if it the sea level would rise with 1 cm every year, the Dutch flood barriers can easily take it."
futureporn,1hgeuv,BlazeUp,-2,Thu Jul 4 20:54:32 2013 UTC,"We're not talking about gradual sea level rise from Arctic ice melt and gradual breakoff in the Ross Ice Shelf, we're talking about glaciers sliding into the ocean and displacing massive volumes of water at a very rapid rate. We're talking meters per year or more."
futureporn,1hgeuv,LeonardNemoysHead,6,Thu Jul 4 21:13:59 2013 UTC,"meters per year? Do you have a reference for this? If the Greenland ice sheet completely melts, that would account for a ~7 meter rise in sealevel. The Antarctic would contribute about 9 times as much if melted completely. Are you suggesting that at some point in the next 50 years, the melting of these ice sheets is going to massively speed up? If so, why? Why wouldn't the melting gradually ramp up?"
futureporn,1hgeuv,dreugeworst,-4,Sun Jul 7 10:12:48 2013 UTC,"It doesn't have to melt. These things are not in the water. When they slide into the water, they will displace it. That's the risk: if it was gradual then it could be dealt with, however effectively. But the risk is in it melting to the point that it dislodges, at which point we have to deal with rapid changes in sea level."
futureporn,1hgeuv,LeonardNemoysHead,2,Sun Jul 7 10:32:02 2013 UTC,"Ok, got any data on how likely they are to slide in? These ice-sheets are pretty massive, they won't move very fast.

futureporn,1hgeuv,dreugeworst,2,Sun Jul 7 10:48:20 2013 UTC,"I'm calling bullshit on this. Most of the projected sea level rise will come from the water expanding when it's warmed up.

futureporn,1hgeuv,V-Bomber,56,Tue Jul 2 11:28:22 2013 UTC,"Ah, back when futuristic architecture and compact housing projects were not understood to be almost automatically destined to become low-income housing."
futureporn,1hgeuv,joshuajargon,27,Mon Jul 1 22:33:12 2013 UTC,"Really? I was looking at that and thinking about how appealing it looked. Why does this sort of thing not work? I'm from Toronto, all we build are glass condo towers, and I think something like this with commercial space and green space built right into living space would be much much much better."
futureporn,1hgeuv,hrishirc,29,Tue Jul 2 01:14:05 2013 UTC,"It does work in theory but in practice the sociological conditions generally surrounding such projects make them fail. These include:       For obvious reasons they generally are built in areas of dense population. These areas have higher crime rates if only because the criminals are closer to more opportunities.     This kind of project typically offers much lower-cost housing. The lower cost tends to attract the poor and desperate, the under-educated, the disenfranchised, and those otherwise without the opportunity, ability, and/or will to obtain wealth.     This kind of project is often created with government assistance -- assistance that comes with strings attached and sadly, graft. A common result is inappropriate cost-cutting that results in improper community planning.     For profitability creating this kind of community involves getting a lot of people to move in all at once. Those willing to move so quickly tend to be willing to move out quickly as well/are otherwise not invested in the area."
futureporn,1hgeuv,rakista,6,Tue Jul 2 02:29:25 2013 UTC,"If in current circumstances, you're right, it will attract the poorest classes, which will ensure crime is easy because of the claustrophobic nature of the building. And obviously, the community can't serve itself e.g. food. And human tendency dictates we'll want to make the best use of resources at hand. We won't congregate unless...  Unless we have a real land/resource/security crisis.  The top floor would serve as a great place for the military/police of the place. And there are obvious advantages. Reduced costs for water distribution, transportation costs are nearly zero (lifts maybe). Reduced resource consumption for construction, roads, e.g.  But how would the community serve itself? Hunting - Gathering? Impossible. Requires frequent movement. Farming? Suppose there are farms all around and the place has its power structure centralized. Some sort of community farming can be expected. With some centralized policing arrangement for protection.  Unless there is a real need for the people coming together, say a world-wide nuclear holocaust/alien invasion with few safe havens, this seems impossible."
futureporn,1hgeuv,joshuajargon,1 point,Tue Jul 2 05:17:19 2013 UTC,"It also assumes a uniformity of expectations and lifestyle that may seem appealing to urban planners, but is totally unrealistic (and kind of arrogant) to expect of people.    Good planning anticipates what people want and does its best to reconcile it with geography, environmental needs, and other factors, rather than force people into pre-defined cubbyholes.  It looks nice on paper but reminds me much more of Logan's Run...  I can see where this idea came from, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s - building upon the enthusiastic, futuristic architecture of the 1930s and the idea of the nuclear / space age - and seeking a contrast to the often grimy inner cities of America and Europe that were experiencing rising crime and industrial decay.  There's an idealism behind it that just doesn't work in the real world."

futureporn,1hgeuv,Dykam,5,Wed Jul 3 18:41:53 2013 UTC,"Amsterdam Bijlmer is a great example of this - a planned community outside the city, designed to alleviate the horrible post-war housing crunch, which rapidly degenerated into slums.  Probably the result of a mixture of more available single-family homes, more private and better public transportation, and an influx of immigrants from former Dutch colonies that led to a kind of white flight.  The area is currently experiencing a renaissance after heavy investment, the destruction of the worst of the housing compounds, and an influx of companies building shiny new headquarters on cheap land.  The same happened in France (the cités) and other European countries (assuming these building projects weren't flat-out horrid to start out with.)  The only place I've seen such architecture actually remain high-end was with holiday flats in Le Grau du Roi in Southern France - aerial view, example building, and even these look pretty run down today.  What looks good in an architecture model won't always work out in practice..."

futureporn,1gli7e,agtk,27,Tue Jun 18 17:42:51 2013 UTC,"Like it, but it would need to be further away from earth to function. The counter weight in 'orbit' is what would keep it standing."
futureporn,1gli7e,Sir-Francis-Drake,3,Tue Jun 18 18:34:12 2013 UTC,This might not be on Earth. Could be just a stage in construction (though the presence of other similarly sized elevators in the background suggests not). There are likely materials and technology not yet invented that can keep the top where it is. Climate change may have pushed the cloud layer much higher.
futureporn,1gli7e,Avengier_Than_Thou,13,Tue Jun 18 18:47:40 2013 UTC,"This might not be on Earth.   Basic orbital rules remain. To orbit at this height and still serve as a space elevator, the planet in question would have a day of about 90 minutes. The rotation of this planet would cause significant damage to the planet's surface, and not really be a good place for humans to live.    Could be just a stage in construction (though the presence of other similarly sized elevators in the background suggests not).   I'll give you this one, but the most efficient way to build a space elevator is from materials in space, not starting from the Earth and going upwards. also this would be very structurally unstable.    There are likely materials and technology not yet invented that can keep the top where it is.   Possible, but I would say impractical. The point of space elevators is to get things into orbit cheaply. At this kind of distance above the Earth, anything that docks to/undocks from the elevator will have to use high amounts of fuel trying to slow down to/speed up from the suborbital speeds the elevator top would be experiencing.    Climate change may have pushed the cloud layer much higher.   The space elevator would have to orbit at about 36000 kilometers above the Earth. Space officially begins at 100 kilometers. The cloud cover can't really go beyond the atmosphere, that's not possible."
futureporn,1gli7e,Thatsnotgonewell,3,Tue Jun 18 19:19:51 2013 UTC,"Yes you cannot build a space elevator ""Up"" you have to build it ""Down"".  The only material that we know of that can actually take the loads required are carbon nano-tubes in tension.  In compression they are not strong and light enough to reach the required height.  If it ""orbits"" beyond geosynchronous altitude the force of gravity will be less than that of the centripetal force. Think of it like a ball on a tether, the counter weight in space exerts a centripetal force pulling on the ""string"" of carbon nano tubes.  Then all you need to do is make sure the force from the counterweight is enough to support the weight of the string and whatever else you may want to lift up to space, and make sure that your string of carbon nano tubes is strong enough to take that load."

futureporn,1gli7e,Avengier_Than_Thou,2,Mon Jun 24 05:14:10 2013 UTC,"In regards to the non-Earth, are you assuming those are water vapor clouds and that the planet is the same mass and volume as the Earth?"
futureporn,1gli7e,Mr_Lobster,7,Tue Jun 18 20:02:27 2013 UTC,"It doesn't matter much what the clouds are made of. In order to have a stable orbit, the top of the elevator must orbit above the atmosphere. The clouds below have little effect on the orbit, though different atmospheres do cause orbits to decay faster or slower.   As far as different mass/volume goes, that's an interesting one. It's probably a good idea to try this on a smaller planet - say, Mars-sized. If we say that the elevator top is close enough to a Cloudy Mars for the image to appear like this, the planet is probably going to have a day of roughly an hour. (this number is an estimate, it's not likely to be totally accurate) Like the fast-spinning Earth, this is not going to be a good thing for Cloudy Mars' surface, which will suffer extreme damage, and the planet will bulge at the equator.   The good thing is, as objects get smaller and less dense the speed needed to orbit them decreases, so some objects, like an asteroid, may be able to have space elevators like this. But any planet would suffer under rotations like the ones we're talking about here."
futureporn,1gli7e,Khavanon,3,Tue Jun 18 20:40:04 2013 UTC,"I appreciate the responses. I don't know a ton about planetary mechanics or the technical requirements about space elevators. My initial response was just giving some potential scenarios that might make the artist's work logical.  Based on your responses, I could see these elevators being built on a small, rocky planet, perhaps like Mercury, or even smaller, spinning close and quickly around a cold star. The planet is generally uninhabitable, but it has valuable minerals, so is mined by heavy machinery. The elevators are packed closely together to increase efficiency."
futureporn,1gli7e,ItsAConspiracy,2,Wed Jun 19 16:57:02 2013 UTC,"Point about the clouds, the space elevator's main station ought to be where geosynchronous orbit is (with the counterweight higher than that), and no body could maintain an atmosphere to that height, at that point it would float off into space."

futureporn,1fudel,RoamingGnome451,5,Fri Jun 7 04:41:16 2013 UTC,"That movie was so pretty, and the action looked very good! But the story fell so flat it was unbelievable. The original was much better, in terms of characters and story anyways."
futureporn,1fudel,synthesezia,5,Fri Jun 7 16:11:57 2013 UTC,I never understood why it made more sense to dig a hole through the Earth to link the two habitable zones instead of just each of them living by themselves.
futureporn,1fudel,DownvoteAttractor,4,Fri Jun 7 16:36:32 2013 UTC,Because... the fall!
futureporn,1fudel,synthesezia,2,Sat Jun 8 02:31:34 2013 UTC,"""Hey guys, now that the world is fucked, let's undertake the single biggest civil engineering project in human history using both limited resources and money to dig a hole through The Earth."""
futureporn,1fudel,a_simple_lampoon,6,Sat Jun 8 06:49:26 2013 UTC,"Just saw the part of the new one by chance and was totally surprised by how well the future-world was rendered. One of the coolest future cities in movies I've seen in a long time. Sadly, the movie otherwise wasn't interesting to me, but the world was awesome."
futureporn,1fudel,PressureCereal,3,Fri Jun 7 16:46:26 2013 UTC,Looks like Opportunity from Borderlands 2.

futureporn,1fof44,TheWarpedOne,1 point,Wed Jun 5 01:45:43 2013 UTC,"Looks like a futuristic oil platform, but we never know what new kind of product we can exploit. Look at Avatar, even with so mush technology they still have to go and drill in the old fashioned way."
futureporn,1fof44,Jer-pa,1 point,Wed Jun 5 19:53:25 2013 UTC,I am in love with massive builds of any kind. Impossibly large buildings and spaceships just tickle my fancy immensely.
futureporn,1fof44,solidoxygen,1 point,Wed Jun 5 16:52:32 2013 UTC,This would be such a cool thing in Borderlands.
futureporn,1fmn30,UltraByt3,4,Tue Jun 4 03:18:24 2013 UTC,"Audi? Not that I'm complaining, but I expected something... more concept-car like; or something even more retro, like a Quattro."
futureporn,1fmn30,A_Light_Spark,2,Tue Jun 4 08:44:00 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I was like ""Damn, they're still making the TT?"""
futureporn,1fmn30,longboardingerrday,2,Tue Jun 4 14:31:20 2013 UTC,That's an R8.
futureporn,1fmn30,steve-d,2,Tue Jun 4 14:51:31 2013 UTC,It looks a little tall and I don't see the side panel. That's why I thought it was a TT. Although it does have the side duct
futureporn,1fmn30,longboardingerrday,1 point,Tue Jun 4 14:53:03 2013 UTC,"That's true. The back end is definitely an R8, but the sides do look more similar to a TT. How about we meeting in the middle and it's a TR8T?"
futureporn,1fmn30,steve-d,1 point,Tue Jun 4 14:57:03 2013 UTC,Classic car
futureporn,1fmn30,TimWebbOne,2,Tue Jun 4 19:00:59 2013 UTC,Any movies like this?
futureporn,1fmn30,L-Duderino,3,Tue Jun 4 08:34:59 2013 UTC,"First thing that came to mind when I saw it was Cloud Atlas, but that's only one era of the story.   The usual go-to answers would be Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell. I highly recommend both if you haven't seen them.  I can't think of any other live action movies like this picture. I'm sure there are plenty of manga/anime films and tv series with this style. An obvious answer that comes to mind is Akira.  This isn't a movie but the game series of Deus Ex looked pretty much like this."
futureporn,1fmn30,n3onfx,4,Tue Jun 4 11:10:17 2013 UTC,For anyone curious about Ghost in the Shell I recommend watching the series as well. It's a lot easier to get into than the movies that (even though I love them to no end) can be a tad too contemplative and confusing to some.

futureporn,1fjfzg,jWalkerFTW,1 point,Mon Jun 3 10:48:01 2013 UTC,Yeah the title is supposed to be the same as the one the artist gives it.
futureporn,1fjfzg,Podnaught,1 point,Mon Jun 3 14:41:15 2013 UTC,I mean it's a repost

futureporn,1fck4h,koshthethird,16,Thu May 30 17:37:43 2013 UTC,"A tremendous waste of space to build a structure of that size, only to leave space unused for aesthetic reasons."
futureporn,1fck4h,perkam,7,Thu May 30 18:24:39 2013 UTC,"My first thought. In a densely populated future, are we really going to be farting about with so much frilliness?"
futureporn,1fck4h,twelvis,7,Thu May 30 22:13:33 2013 UTC,"I've seen this pic before. It really feels like it's not a human city. Even if it is, don't forget culture changes very quickly and buildings reflect that."
futureporn,1fck4h,Kevindeuxieme,7,Fri May 31 05:04:07 2013 UTC,And wasting resources is a display of wealth and power. I mean why else did we build so many cathedrals.
futureporn,1fck4h,twelvis,3,Fri May 31 07:06:17 2013 UTC,"Well, actually, the cathedrals were a good investment. They would draw donations, generate work for hundreds of years, which would in turn spur the development of the town, and of course, they drew pilgrims before there was mass tourism."
futureporn,1fck4h,Kevindeuxieme,2,Fri May 31 07:57:36 2013 UTC,"Well I don't think what you said invalidates my statement much, right? Nobody joins a group that's visibly failing, so the better you look the more people gather."
futureporn,1fck4h,Pdfxm,9,Fri May 31 08:55:16 2013 UTC,Tell that to Rem Koolhaas. This is an actual building in Beijing.
futureporn,1fck4h,calculon000,2,Thu May 30 18:27:52 2013 UTC,Maybe that's sort of the point.
futureporn,1fck4h,fiffers,1 point,Thu May 30 20:05:50 2013 UTC,You could easily make that exact argument for the sprawl that our civilization absolutely LOVES to build in our time. There's a number of economic and societal factors in the future that could cause the urban design of that city to be quite plausible.
futureporn,1fck4h,sharkteef,2,Fri May 31 16:35:24 2013 UTC,Why are there no plants in the future? It's like every idea we have of the future is a dystopian hellscape where humans shun parks and trees in the public sphere.
futureporn,1fck4h,Boogy,4,Fri May 31 19:34:42 2013 UTC,We're doing a good job of eradicating our jungles now
futureporn,1fck4h,piatok,1 point,Wed Jun 5 02:09:43 2013 UTC,The spires kind of remind me of the Blood Elf cities in WoW. The rest not so much though.

futureporn,1fb1tn,theguynamedtim,3,Mon Jun 3 02:45:30 2013 UTC,This looks like it might be based on the view of Marina in Dubai rom right by the Yacht Club.
