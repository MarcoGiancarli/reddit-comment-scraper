fireemblem,3e326x,YlisseanTactician,40,Tue Jul 21 16:05:35 2015 UTC,i'd love for Sakurai to add another FE character as DLC. Not because I desire one (#marthmain2k15) but because it is so satisfying to see smash fans freak out over the number of FE reps
fireemblem,3e326x,kamikorosu,11,Tue Jul 21 16:20:00 2015 UTC,I want Sakurai to buff the existing FE characters before we get another
fireemblem,3e326x,Pitbu11s,7,Tue Jul 21 17:55:51 2015 UTC,preaching to the choir here. marth needs a strength buff and ike needs a speed buff desperately.
fireemblem,3e326x,kamikorosu,4,Tue Jul 21 17:59:09 2015 UTC,"Ike doesn't need a speed buff, infact he's pretty decent with the newest update  Marth/Lucina need more grab range, better throws, and they need a minor speed buff  I guess Robin could use a speed buff too, maybe his attacks could be stronger to balance out his slowness"
fireemblem,3e326x,Pitbu11s,5,Tue Jul 21 18:01:21 2015 UTC,"Oh man, Robin. He has so much potential to be top tier, and is an amazingly fun character to boot, but he needs at least one of the following:   Less start-up and/or endlag on at least Arc-Fire; all his moves are laggy as heck Improve that grab range; his reach is horrendous for no good reason Make one of his throws a combo or set-up throw, like they did with Link Buff back-throw like Ness or Sonic's.   Even if they keep him the slowest character, a proper projectile game would be huge. I love Robin so much but he's just not viable right now."
fireemblem,3e326x,Radicool21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:44 2015 UTC,"I think he should be faster than jiggs, at least."

fireemblem,3e326x,kamikorosu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:47 2015 UTC,They mostly buffed his aerial delays. He's pretty much able to act instantly after Nair and has a really fast recovery from his Fair now. His side special also has a much faster start up and recovery.

fireemblem,3e326x,Reddit_overload1,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:34 2015 UTC,Really it's only fair to give FE a bunch of reps since the cast is entirely different in most games. Robin/Lucina are the only ones that have even met in the main storyline. Makes more sense than Dark Pit or Dr. Mario at least.
fireemblem,3e326x,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:32:31 2015 UTC,"With another FE rep, that makes 6 FE reps, and if you're counting female Robin, that's 7, and if you count Chrom (stretching here), that's 8. That's more than all the characters using the Mario emblem, the current top, and more than all the Pokémon (not counting Pokémon Trainer), the current second.  We would have to rename Smash Super Fire Emblem Bros..  EDIT: how could you have possibly taken this seriously"
fireemblem,3e326x,whizzer0,10,Tue Jul 21 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"i think the whole counting robin as two reps and chrom (wtf thats like counting Dunban and Riki as Xeno reps, and all megaman forms as reps) as a smash rep is the hugest reach ever.  also Super Smash Fire Emblem Bros sounds fantastic i'll take 12 tbh."

To be honest, while it would be great to not have that spoiled, part of the appeal of playing through FE4 for me is that that's the thing that gets spoiled on this sub, so nothing else does. I'm still on Chapter 2 myself and I have (mostly) no idea what happens in the rest of the game except for Sigurd and co. biting the dust at some point.

I can only remember Sigurd, Noish, Alec, Cuan, Lex, Dew, Midir, Fin, Ethlin. ... The rest of the characters' names escape my mind. I think the princess is Lachessi?

""Have a character kill a certain other character and then stand in a specific place and BAM another skill-giving ring!""  Or my favourite: ""Give this character a lover. Make him stand on a specific hilltop on this chapter, and BAM +5 to a stat he'S not really going to need.""  Most of the conversations between characters are easy enough to get. Just look over the each character's stats screen to see if they have a talk option after every castle / cutscene. But some of the special events are downright cruel to activate."

fireemblem,3e3f1n,punk_emblem,9,Tue Jul 21 19:37:52 2015 UTC,Fire Emblem should not be extremely gritty or serious. Kid Icarus: Uprising is a good example of what should be done to balance drama and humor.   NNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  NO  BAD GPUZZLE.   BAD.  I like uprising but half the reason it works there is due to the setting.
fireemblem,3e3f1n,daisysaur,5,Tue Jul 21 17:43:58 2015 UTC,"It works due to the setting, and the humor doesn't need to be Fourth Wall-less.  It just needs to balance both like Uprising did."
fireemblem,3e3f1n,Zangam,11,Tue Jul 21 17:45:27 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the serious moments in that game were few and far between. Uprising was a very silly game, and it poked fun at itself. I adore that game, but I play it when I'm feeling sad, to cheer myself up (and see my husbando-NO REGRETS). I play FE when I want something more serious. Not grim dark, or Sonic the Edgehog dark, but a tone worthy of a game about death and war."

fireemblem,3e3f1n,BloodyBottom,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:05 2015 UTC,I don't feel uprising balanced them very well. And shattering the fourth wall was one of the most used jokes in uprising.
fireemblem,3e3f1n,themythicalcheese,6,Tue Jul 21 17:48:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't say it was ""balanced"". 70-80% of the dialogue was jokes, and some of the characters were pretty much exclusively humorous. It was a fine tone for that game, but I'd hate to see it in Fire Emblem."

fireemblem,3e3f1n,ginseng2,10,Tue Jul 21 18:07:48 2015 UTC,"Apparently, this is an oddball opinion. Shadow Dragon is one of the more anime-esque games we've seen.

fireemblem,3e3f1n,CaRoss11,3,Tue Jul 21 17:58:45 2015 UTC,"I can agree with you there. To expand upon that opinion, I would say that there needs to be an increase in support levels before marriage (like two extra S ranks) and fewer options per character (allowing for stronger writing on these supports)."
fireemblem,3e3f1n,Pikmin1211,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say 2-3 possible marriages per character. I really like the idea of extra S rank conversations, once you unlock the first one you can't achieve an S with the other marriage candidates. Without the inclusion of children this could actually happen (with children would be too much work I think)!"
fireemblem,3e3f1n,GoldenMapleLeaf,2,Tue Jul 21 19:02:14 2015 UTC,"Keeping the number of options down would be great.

fireemblem,3e3f1n,BlakeHighborn,5,Tue Jul 21 19:21:53 2015 UTC,"My rant/feelings on Path of Radiance incoming!  PoR just seemed really generic to me. I mean, ok, Ike isn't a noble, but he's yet another blue haired, sword-wielding main character that has to save the day. People talk about PoR having some great story, but honestly, I don't see it. Ashnard is hardly a unique villain at all. I mean, the first time we see him, his picture is laughing/grinning manically as he rides a black wyvern and commands an army dressed all in black to invade.  I didn't think the art style was particularly strong. It was better than the DS games, but that isn't hard, and way worse than the GBA games, which I consider to be pretty timeless.  I didn't like the way the laguz worked at all, save the nobles. It seemed like they would always spend half the chapter waiting to transform, attack for one turn, and then have their gauge completed depleted by enemy archers the next.  Some of the characters were good, Mia, Haar, Jill, and the Four Riders were well done. Can't stand Soren though and Ike just seemed like a less fun Hector and a less decisive Ephraim. The Black Knight deserves a mention for being an interesting character, despite having the stupidest, most cliched name imaginable.  Overall, the game felt very flat. It was 'just another Fire Emblem' which doesn't mean it was bad, just, out of all the games in the series I've played, I've never felt a desire to go back and really play it again. On, the other hand though, I thought RD had some of the coolest set-pieces in the history of the series and is easily in my top 3 favorite games of the series."
fireemblem,3e3f1n,BloodyBottom,2,Tue Jul 21 18:01:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree with a lot of that, but man that art style was iffy."
fireemblem,3e3f1n,ginseng2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:06 2015 UTC,"I know right! Something about it was just . . . off. It was better than the DS games because the characters actually had some life to them, but it completely missed the charm of the GBA games, at least for me.  Oddly enough, I found RD much nicer to look at. Idk what they changed, maybe the obnoxious black border that PoR got removed, but it help a lot. The Tellius games did a lot of things right and new, but starting up a new PoR save and seeing Ike in that prologue is . . . rough, to say the least."
fireemblem,3e3f1n,GoldenMapleLeaf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:07 2015 UTC,"RD's art was about a thousand times better, and is the highpoint of the series' art as far as I'm concerned."

Since Sacred Stones gives us no evidence as to how Renais' government works other than that it is ruled by a King, and thus a monarchy, we're left to assume that this is the case.  The aforementioned Unique weaponry named after an incestuous couple. Among other things, they have a child who is confirmed to be the the result of Siegmund and Sieglinde ""doing it"" with each other.

I figured with that much DEF, she should take on physical units.  Well if all else fails, the Kaze/Rinkah dream team (Kaze is probably more useful for other units) should help her out.

For maps where you have to seize, that skill could be of the first to join in each team (if an adoc order), or the chief of the guild. Every time you made or an amount of points or something the player could obtain an stat booster, or those appear on random maps of monsters.

He seems like a nice enough guy from what we see of him, so i'd imagine he'd try to save me.  Now, considering Henry was my flair up until a short while ago, I'll write up for him, too. He would definitely win the fight, because it's made clear that he's one of the more powerful units storywise in the game (most notably, he is the only potential father for Owain that actually manages to fight off their attackers in their B support, instead of just running away. And this is after being hit by a sniper.) Now whether or not I would survive...are we talking pre or post joining the shepherds here? Because if its post, then he would probably put some effort into saving me, because he's shown to care about people in general a lot more after joining Chrom's gang.

fireemblem,3e1pxf,theussab,14,Tue Jul 21 07:41:26 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I was waiting for one of these. Normally, I would vouch for Eirika or Chrom, but today, I feel like throwing a screwball into the fray  Let's talk about Roy. boooo booooo. Alright, alright, I can hear the clicks of a thousand down votes about to be showered upon me, but hear me out before I am to be banned. What is their to say about Roy? He's an idealistic young man who has to lead a band of misfits during a surprise war that his father is too feeble to command. Unlike many of the other lords, he is very young. Leading an army and Pherae during dire times as a 15 year old? Certainly not a menial task. But what about PoR Ike you say? What differs from him and our boy is maturity. What was the first thing Ike did when he heard Mist was kidnapped? BLABARJSHFKR ATTACK WITHOUT ANY HELP!! Chrom when  KILL EVERYTHING! Okay not really, but let's put Roy in this scenario. Lilina is hostage in the castle? Alrighty, everyone get ready to storm the castle tactically and not rashly. He has the capacity to react calmly and tactically in unexpected and terrible news.  Another thing about Roy. Kid's pretty smart. Capable of sniffing out the treacherous ways of that Lycian ally ( forgot their name ), and knows Elphin is more then meets the eye. Think about it. When did the other lords display a true sense of intelligence ( tell me, I'm curious ). Also, he seeks peace more then anything. Unlike Ephraim, who seems to enjoy violence, Roy is commonly seen trying to negotiate peaceful ways, accepting the princess of the enemy into his platoon after hearing her words is an example.  Roy is certainly not the best at the gameplay, but looking from a story standpoint, he's pretty badass. So I say, with my point provenIThink, Roy is my boy and my favourite lord out of all."
fireemblem,3e1pxf,Sabertwooth,2,Tue Jul 21 10:11:12 2015 UTC,Never thought Roy was even bad gameplay wise. And it make since for him to not be ultra OP seeing how young he is! FE6

Chrom grew up from being a guy who just knew how to fight (so much that he created the Shepherds) to being a good ruler and father, as evidenced by his conversation with Say'ri, that he doesn't just jump out to the fight without understanding what is at stake first. He does have some non-bright moments at the end of the game, though.  And hey, if it makes you feel better, Eliwood is also one of my favorites together with Chrom, Hector and Sigurd!"

fireemblem,3e1pxf,ChaosDevilDragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:08:20 2015 UTC,"Cant really compare Eliwood to Eirika, since their stat distribution is different. Lyn and Eirika are both myrmidons in lord clothing, so comparing them is easier. Stat wise, despite being similar to Lyn (Eirika having 70/40/60/60/60/30/30 in HP, STR, SKL, SPD, LUK, DEF, and RES respectively compared to Lyn's 70/40/60/60/55//20/30. The 10% difference can do along way in defense (summoning /u/PeacefulZealot so he can brag about his last FE8 run) and having Sieglinde actually has a high might, compared to even the Manni Katti if it's still around by the final chapter, which usually relies on criticals in order to kill anything, and that's around a 40-50% chance (that never happens for me fuck your Manni katti). And the Sol Katti just sucks.) Compared to Ephraim however, Eliwood's having 2 weapons upon promotion still doesn't compare to Ephraim and all his glory. Ephraim has 80/55/55/45/50/35/25 in his growth (55% in strength! For comparison, Chrom has 60% and he's considered a great unit strength wise, and he comes in an age with inflated stats and stat caps) compared to Eliwood's 80/45/50/40/45/30/35.  Magvel lords>>>>>>>Elibe lords (not including Hector)  Edit: Ephraim is arguably as good as Hector when looking at growths   Hectors got similar growths in strength at 60% and a stellar defense growth at 50%, but lacks in speed and luck at 30% and 35%. 2 weapons plus 5 move and a good endgame weapon in Armads versus Ephraim's 1 weapon and horse and a good endgame weapon in Siegmund. Pretty even I'd say  Armads with 18 mt and +5 defense, and Siegmund with 17 mt, +5 strength and effectiveness against monsters"

This isn't how Draj is meant to look, and everyone who has seen the character (most of the sub, I assume) knows that. If this is fat erasure, would Rule 63 (gender swap) art be erasure of the original gender, or would drawing a character with changed characteristics be erasure of characters who share that original characteristic?  By the way, please note that I do not intend to come off as rude during debates."
fireemblem,3e0lgm,TheFarquaadSquad,-8,Tue Jul 21 03:55:20 2015 UTC,"Rule 63 would be transphobic honestly but that's for a different day  You're not being rude at all. Anyway, it's fat erasure because there's no reason to make them skinny instead of fat if they're officially, canonically fat. It's like you dislike them being fat, so why not make them skinny and erase fat people?  It's not how Draj is supposed to look, but that doesn't mean it's good and safe, either"
fireemblem,3e0lgm,luigifan103,9,Tue Jul 21 03:56:56 2015 UTC,"You seem to be misunderstanding the basic concept of art, and what it serves to accomplish.  Art is made to make people think and feel, and forces people to confront ideas and values they may hold. Drawing Draj skinny isn't ""fat erasure."" Fat erasure is when people pretend fat people don't exist to disparage them as a social group. Drawing Draj as skinny forces people to take a second look at a character without the preconceived ideas based on a single character trait. Many people have written Draj off as just being a 'token fat character,' but seeing art like this may make them reconsider this assumption. They may realize that even without her weight, she maintains her personality, her style, and her love of exploration, and holds her own as a character. Alternatively, it may force some people to consider the possibility that they only like her character because she's fat; and that without her weight, they might not like her as a character.  And rule 63 isn't transphobic, just like drawing a skinny character as fat isn't ""skinny erasure."" It's just a way for people to reexamine characters outside of preconceived notions about sex or gender. Calling it transphobic is insensitive and uncalled for. Drawing a character with a different sex and gender or weight is a way of examining what those values mean to us. If you want people to change their views on gender or weight, art like this is how it's done."

fireemblem,3e0lgm,luigifan103,4,Tue Jul 21 15:34:15 2015 UTC,"Transphobic? How?   It's just an artist looking at a character and drawing them as if they are female/male.  In the same way, I can see how you would think this edit is offensive to fat people, but it is just an edit. I don't think they had a large agenda against fat people to push. They just decided to see how she would look if thinner."
fireemblem,3e0lgm,super45,4,Tue Jul 21 06:42:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I may not make friends saying this, but I feel like the Fire Emblem community has really been swept up in this ""outrage culture"" that's been perpetuated lately. It just seems every time I look on the page, there's something I should apparently be mad at. Like that whole thing with Soliel was apparently slamming LGBT or whatever they were trying to claim, when in actuality it was a super minor thing.

I can't speak for every artist who makes fanart, but just because they change things about the character doesn't mean they dislike the original characteristic. The artist is likely just seeing how the character would look, hence ""experimental"".   I'm not saying the point of fanart is to change things, but you can't assume that there is any ill will behind a change to the initial character design."

I don't know her personality (nor do I want to right now, trying to keep away for spoilers), so all I have is her appearance. I still feel like crap for it though :(  Anyway, if they made this change, I would feel bad that we lost the representation and diversity, but I do like the looks of this design better because I find her more attractive.

The problem only comes when you start to define peoples' overall worth by their level of attractiveness.  It's okay to think she's more attractive because she's thin... it's just not okay to think she's a better person because she's thin.
fireemblem,3e0lgm,JRutterbush,3,Tue Jul 21 07:32:41 2015 UTC,"to be honest, I have an easier time believing she's an explorer if she's skinny, simply because exploring involves physical activity, and while I'm sure there are people with the genes to be incredibly active with a fuller physique, it's still harder to believe than the alternative. I don't think that makes her a better 'person', just a better explorer.  ...If she was a GREAT explorer, she'd have more muscle definition, but that's just me..."

fireemblem,3e1yuc,PooPooKafka,9,Tue Jul 21 09:44:06 2015 UTC,"I think a large part of why people don't like it is due to the iffy graphics style. It has a very odd graphics style, very much different to the Wii games or GBA games. I think also the large amount of units that you would never use had something to do with it.  Also, if you really want to arena abuse, the fortress can do it. But it will take a stupid long amount of time. Is there not a store with heal staves for sale?"
fireemblem,3e1yuc,Datagne_Jones,6,Tue Jul 21 10:04:56 2015 UTC,"In Book 1 of Mystery of the Emblem, shops didn't carry Heal staves until, like, chapter seven, and I'm aware of at least one chapter before that from the original that was cut but probably reintroduced in Shadow Dragon.  And for me, the entire reason I resent Shadow Dragon and will rate it on or near the bottom is the ""sacrifice your units"" factor. In the last map of the Prologue, you're basically required to sacrifice one of your units to proceed, and in the main game there are units and side-chapters you simply won't get if you have more than a certain number of units alive. The game defies the hook of the series and denies you content for playing too well. I just can't stand that."
fireemblem,3e1yuc,Mikeataros,3,Tue Jul 21 11:10:56 2015 UTC,"Playing the Prologue is also the only way to get Norne (kill two characters for her, her bases are overall worse than Gordin, but she's faster and cuter) and keep Frey (who's about as good as the other two cavaliers, again with worse bases but better growths) instead of Jagen (who is Jagen).  The side chapters are really ""catch up"" chapters, but I can't really see how anyone would be bad enough to lose enough characters to visit most of them normally, since you generally need to lose nearly all your forces by certain chapters and SD gives you a lot of not-quite-faceless soldiers... if you simply ignored the optional recruits, you'd still need to kill three more characters to get Athena.  Missing Tiki and the true Falchion makes 24x basically the most ""natural"" side chapter (Bantu is pretty bad, so it's not out of the question to just forget about bringing him along to save Tiki, and if you aren't thorough you could miss one of the spheres needed for Starlight, or you could decide to skip Starlight in favor of keeping the Starsphere), though that one can be gamed to not really lose any characters (or the Falchion) overall."

Save the heal staffs for the next couple chapters, then you can start grinding when you can mass purchase them inbetween chapters.

Avoid Matthis."

Grinding Tiki before the endgame is worth it, I think it's worth the risk. Don't forget to Forge your weapons, Forged Rapiers are what make Marth so great. Wing Spears are fantastic, Caeda is worth keeping because of those. Shops on the map will sell Rapiers and Wing Spears, so don't be afraid to use them. (I was stingy with mine and by the endgame I had a ton on my first run.)  You'll be able to buy staves soon enough, so it's probably better you waste them and get characters some EXP (Wrys isn't the best healer, be ready to ditch him when you get Lena).  I honestly don't understand why people hate the graphics so much, I like the graphics personally. I suppose maybe it's because I started out on Awakening...? Meh.

For the Rapiers and Wing Spears, you'll get more of them if you want, the shops in chapter 8 will be the next ones you get.  of Ogma's axemen, Barst is probably the best, but Cord has the best growths. Bord just sucks.  Ogma is also amazing, but he'll often get str screwed... in fact, most everyone will probably get strength screwed.  Lena is the best healer in the game, but chapter 5 has a decent pre-promote.  overall, most of the characters are usable, just too many have pitiful speed growths.  Finally, reclassing is really good. Something to do is to make Jagen a Dracoknight. In fact, once you promote Caeda, I suggest making her a Palidin, and your cavaliers (Hardin, Frey, Cain, and Able are the good ones) into dracoknights after they promote."

fireemblem,3e0z2r,flamingtoastjpn,6,Tue Jul 21 03:14:54 2015 UTC,feels like pointless fanservice here   Hint: it is
fireemblem,3e0z2r,flamingtoastjpn,3,Tue Jul 21 12:20:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I kind of like the changes to durability but I hate the new triangle  to each their own I guess.  As for the OP, Fates is pretty fun, I really like it so far.  Could do without all the extra shit though, I feel like it takes away more than it adds"
fireemblem,3e0z2r,Radicool21,2,Tue Jul 21 12:20:14 2015 UTC,"I'm planning on playing through similarly as I did Awakening, without marriage or children. I never liked the concept, and it wasn't really required until Lunatic+. As someone who's never played with any objectives other than ""Defeat the Enemy"", I'm quite excited for the gameplay and maps."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,Its_a_Friendly,13,Tue Jul 21 10:53:01 2015 UTC,"I'm generally a fair bit positive. There are some really odd decisions and choices (face rubbing, bathhouse, multiple payments, some poor gameplay/story choices, etc.), but there is a heck of a lot of good stuff to balance it out. The soundtrack, gameplay, characters and even the story all sound very good."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,Shephen,17,Tue Jul 21 03:17:05 2015 UTC,Was super hyped for it before I bought it a few days ago. Started playing it and it is probably my favorite in the series so far. Its pretty great.
fireemblem,3e0z2r,GoldenMapleLeaf,8,Tue Jul 21 03:24:11 2015 UTC,"There are some things I don't like, yeah, but I doubt there's really anything new they could spring on me that would stop me from buying it."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,xRiho,7,Tue Jul 21 03:12:34 2015 UTC,"I love the designs. Hate children spawning from rabbit holes, really. I bought this game for a whole new experience ; I got it. 8/10"
fireemblem,3e0z2r,UltimateGir,5,Tue Jul 21 03:28:45 2015 UTC,"I like it. Aside from the lewdness and a few character designs, I think it'll be a fun game. I really enjoy the idea of having my character,  that I can mold in any way they allow, will be the main character. And I also like the differences between the routes, the different win standards on some maps, and the My Castle stuff. I absolutely love the idea of randomized things instead of 10000000 of the exact same thing, like X and Y with Pokémon."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,RuneFactoryAnna,5,Tue Jul 21 04:19:24 2015 UTC,"I love it. I played through all the routes and I loveloveloved every second of it. To the nail biting difficulty in Nohr, to the relaxed nature of Hoshido and the amazing story all around. I'll be honest, i'll buy all 3 routes again when they're in English as long as they don't butcher the crap out its translation."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,smartwon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:22:24 2015 UTC,or censor the crap out of it :/ (i'm hoping they don't)
fireemblem,3e0z2r,cargup,6,Tue Jul 21 15:33:45 2015 UTC,"I feel mostly positive about it. Still not digging My Castle, especially as I find out it impacts more gameplay functions like forging; but it seems innocuous and ignorable enough. And I'll even use its extra features sometimes.  Actually the thing that disappoints me the most is hearing Hoshido has bad map design. I like Hoshido's characters and aesthetic. Realistically, I'm not sure the developers could or would have designed two full campaigns of complex, unique maps...so maybe Hoshido has the dump maps. I don't know if that's supposed to make me feel better about it. Hoping Lunatic mode and general gameplay features can salvage it somewhat.  Overall, I'm mostly in the dark, but I think I'll enjoy Fates. There are things I dislike, but ultimately it looks like a good game. Yes, it has some confounding design choices, but they're probably not enough to make me hate it."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,estrangedeskimo,4,Tue Jul 21 03:33:31 2015 UTC,Were you expecting Hoshido map design to be good? They were open from the beginning that map design was not a priority.
fireemblem,3e0z2r,IceAnt573,3,Tue Jul 21 06:23:37 2015 UTC,Well /u/cargup is pretty okay with Awakening map design and Hoshido  is thought to have map design equal to that of Awakening. And the first chapter after the decision (shown at E3) isn't all that bad.
fireemblem,3e0z2r,cargup,3,Tue Jul 21 06:30:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, basically this. I thought the E3 map was pretty decent. I could live with maps of that quality. Hoshido could be a fun little diversion on Lunatic and I could set my own challenges like trying to beat previous turn counts. But even I have my standards...that desert map has to be one of the worst maps in the series, but I only peeked at it."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,IceAnt573,3,Tue Jul 21 06:37:12 2015 UTC,What chapter in Fates are you talking about?
fireemblem,3e0z2r,cargup,3,Tue Jul 21 06:37:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know the number/name, but it's early. Hinoka joins there. It was also shown in the first trailer with Rinkah and Oboro attacking.  I looked for it because I noticed people making a fuss about how bad it was, saying how even Awakening Ch. 8 had side objectives and whatnot. I was slightly skeptical. Then I saw it and it was quite literally a medium-sized sandy square with a few terrain decorations. Decorations, not features. I really hope that was an outlier."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,IceAnt573,2,Tue Jul 21 06:44:56 2015 UTC,"Saw it. Yeah it's pretty bleh. Although, shadowofchaos said he had fun with it and he was playing on Lunatic. Also, what a coincidence that Chapter 8 is a desert chapter in Hoshido and Awakening."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,cargup,2,Tue Jul 21 07:58:39 2015 UTC,"I mean, they said it would have less complex objectives. I don't equate that with outright bad. I wasn't expecting it to wow me, but I did think it could be decent.  Problem is, more than anything else, I'm unwilling to spoil the maps. So I'm basing my assumptions on hearsay. I don't share the common view that Awakening maps are all open fields/absolutely terrible, but I do acknowledge their general weakness in objectives. So I may end up liking Hoshido, just not as much as Nohr.  If they're like mostly that atrocious early desert map, though, I'll be disappointed."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,estrangedeskimo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:33:49 2015 UTC,"I don't share the common view that Awakening maps are all open fields/absolutely terrible   Well, didn't know that. I would say I likely have the least favorable opinion of Awakening maps on the subreddit, so our views are probably completely incompatible."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,cargup,2,Tue Jul 21 06:42:36 2015 UTC,"so our views are probably completely incompatible.   Maybe. I can be forgiving of an average-quality map if it's done well. Enemy strength and positioning, standard side objectives and rewards, etc. These are things Awakening generally does all right and sometimes quite well; and on some level I just like playing Awakening.  I do prefer creative maps though. RD River Crossing comes to mind. A very good map with a novel concept. I'm expecting that and better in Nohr. But if enemy strength and general mechanics are up to snuff in Hoshido, I'll consider it decent or fun at least. Maybe in that sense our views are incompatible?"
fireemblem,3e0z2r,estrangedeskimo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:53:36 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned, map design is tied with strong mechanics for the number 1 factor in determining how much I enjoy an FE game (no surprise my number 1 and number 2 games are 10 and 5). I much prefer difficulty be built by terrain and a variety of mechanics than by numbers."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,cargup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:05:03 2015 UTC,"May just be a matter of degree then. I really, really wanted the next FE to tone down Awakening's min-max, big stats, and infinite nature (infinite stats, infinite grind, infinite gold, infinite weapons).  Bar grind DLC and the like which I should have expected, that mostly appears to be the case. So I'm glad for that. But I may give Hoshido a pass if I can't totally sleep through it because it has strong enemies or status staffs. That's, again, only on the condition that maps meet a baseline of ""they showed some effort."" Feeling iffy about that with what I currently know."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,biffpower3,4,Tue Jul 21 07:14:52 2015 UTC,"Hoshido map design is nowhere near as bad as people are making it out to be, i've found a lot of maps from ch18+ to be pretty exciting, and ch23 to be a pretty cool take on what is really a fairly straightforward map - it's made me think more strategically than any other FE game i've played"
fireemblem,3e0z2r,alex6309,3,Tue Jul 21 08:02:20 2015 UTC,I agree with children being dumb. They're only here because people liked them before. They have less of an excuse to appear now compared to 4 and 13. The MU would be cool if they gave them actual dialogue options and not just make them loved by everyone including characters not even in the game.  Looking forward to fates though.
fireemblem,3e0z2r,CaRoss11,2,Tue Jul 21 04:53:45 2015 UTC,"Dialogue options should be a mandatory requirement if they're going to be keeping the MU system. Everything could still flow as normal, but there should be options for the MU to choose how they respond to certain situations (just like in P3 and P4, which IS should be using, at the very least, as a basis for MU's)."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,Vineron,5,Tue Jul 21 16:57:52 2015 UTC,"Still buying it, though my hype is somewhat deflated.  Pretty sure for the child characters the majority agree that they seem superfluous. I've already accepted they're happening and enjoy some of them. It just feels extremely forced and tacked on.  Plot details I've heard also disappoint me, but they aren't a gamebreaker and there's a slight hope in the localization for some differences.  Most of the gameplay mechanic changes I'm either indifferent or positive about."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,IceAnt573,4,Tue Jul 21 03:18:20 2015 UTC,"Gameplay is appealing to me. Personal skills. Kunais. More Balance.  Overall, I like the supports.  From what I heard of the story so far...localization is going to make or break it, but it at least has direction.  Fanservice-y elements I do not like.  My Castle...an okay concept. I like the idea of having shops in one place that you need to upgrade over time and manage with arenas, prisons, cooking, etc.  I don't like arena prizes being stuff only usable for forging and cooking.   Children do not have a purpose at all in Fates. Like it would be noticeable to people who only previously played Awakening. So yeah, I expect Intelligent Systems to have a serious look at the reception to how they are implemented in this game and see them (hopefully) do away with the inheritance/generation/children/whatever mechanic.   I am going to buy it.  Edit: As for the designs, they are definitely a step up. Compare Awakening Pegasus Knights to Fates Pegasus Warriors and you see that Fates' outfits for them are more appealing. Also, Knights and Cavaliers. Belka is nice. Oboro, the ninjas, Luna, Pieri, Xander, Hana, Lazward, etc."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,smartwon,2,Tue Jul 21 03:57:22 2015 UTC,I'm going to buy it as well. Children are the only major thing holding me back from going to most certainly love it.
fireemblem,3e0z2r,SuperCredit,2,Tue Jul 21 04:00:05 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with the children? I haven't heard much wrong about them, did I miss something?"
fireemblem,3e0z2r,CaRoss11,-4,Tue Jul 21 15:36:02 2015 UTC,really. children are holding you back. when they are the absolute definition of optional.
fireemblem,3e0z2r,SuperCredit,7,Tue Jul 21 04:17:12 2015 UTC,"Why would I not use them? I just hate how they are just fanservice. They could be normal characters, not future children."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,IceAnt573,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:19:55 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking as well. They don't need to be connected to preexisting characters in the way that they currently are. Instead, they could have just been introduced as separate units."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,SuperCredit,-8,Tue Jul 21 16:56:28 2015 UTC,"just fanservice. You realize It was made specifically because it caters to the japanese fans, the primary base for them.   CHILDREN SUCK! Should not be tied to the actual child characters themselves..they don't suck, despite people being angry with how you obtain them.   Minus the dimension hopping guess what. They're great characters."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,IceAnt573,4,Tue Jul 21 04:24:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sure quite a handful of them are great characters, but like Panne before them, their implementation into the game is poor."
fireemblem,3e0z2r,SuperCredit,-4,Tue Jul 21 04:27:14 2015 UTC,"Shut your damn mouth about Panne she's fantastic. But srsly  Yeah. She just pops in like hey, im here now.  Okay. But how is that in all reality subracting from the game?"
fireemblem,3e0z2r,SuperCredit,5,Tue Jul 21 04:30:29 2015 UTC,Panne is the result of Intelligent Systems feeling pressured to include everything they wanted to include in what they thought was the final game in the franchise without a care on how to implement them well. Awakening is set in the future world of Archanea. Panne can transform into a beast character and says there were previously more beast characters before they got extinct in a massacre. So now we're led to believe Archanea somehow willed non-dragon transformation people into existence and then become extinct in the 1000/2000/??? or so years between Archanea and present Ylisse. It detracts a lot from the worldbuilding which previous games have done better in.
fireemblem,3e0z2r,estrangedeskimo,-6,Tue Jul 21 04:37:36 2015 UTC,"I can't even begin to explain how unimportant that is to me, and the creators in sustaining the game franchise.  It was an oversight that kills nothing.  Its a fantasy game. With beast people.  Improbable isnt impossible"

Since I've been watching streams of the game I've stopped caring about My Castle since it's implementation isn't super huge, I really dislike the new forging system though, and the way they made weapons now I think is fine so I'm fine with no durability.

Haven't asked /u/Gwimpage about his thoughts on the mode in a while, but last I checked he was finding it a reasonable challenge with good enemy composition.   Even if Fates was the second coming of Thracia, I'd still consider it awful. My Castle gutted the series of any self-respect."

fireemblem,3e0z2r,biffpower3,2,Tue Jul 21 06:28:50 2015 UTC,"No. If anything, it is an understatement. Fire Emblem is now a series that features:   gratuitous fanservice, the most fanservice of any Nintendo franchise pandering (typically adoptive) incest pandering to pedophiles; several underage girls can be married, fucked, impregnated, and dirty-talked to by the player's self-insert puerile, often homophobic, depictions of sexual minorities profound tonal dissonance; despite everything above, the game wants to be taken seriously   Fates is a truly embarrassing installment. Reputations of entire franchises have been ruined by single missteps, and Fire Emblem is the latest example.   In a best-case scenario, all morally repugnant content will be rewritten or excised during localization, allowing most FE fans to enjoy in blissful ignorance."

Whenever I criticize Fates on its gameplay or map design, I spark plenty of debate. So it's telling that every time this topic comes up, I never hear a rebuttal. No one has ever argued Fates doesn't pander to lolicon enthusiasts. No one has ever argued Fates does portray sexual minorities in a respectful and nuanced way. Sometimes I'll get the It's optional! defense as an attempt to sweep these controversies under the rug, but otherwise I'm met with silence.  I honestly believe it's just a matter of people feeling embarrassed. I don't blame them, since I feel embarrassed too."

But even if Fates is one of my favorite games I'm not going to waste time defending a part of it that I detest. (The incest and Lolicon crap) What truly was embarrassing for me though was Nowi in Awakening. Lolicon with that design? Get that shit outta here.

fireemblem,3e0z2r,KrisNut,6,Tue Jul 21 09:18:45 2015 UTC,"i really don't understand how you can say that it's shaping up to be the worst in the franchise  i've been playing hoshido on classic hard - and it's by far the most difficult FE i've played to date, and the only one that's required actual strategy - they've severely reduced the level difference for a character to be 'overlevelled' and all enemies have the stats you'd expect them to have, a level 9 beserker has upwards of 30 strength, with a high mt weapon, and high enough skill that you cannot rely on dodging, you HAVE to have a high def character take that hit, or you'll lose a character, a dark mage will be similar with magic, and there's no characters with substantially high magic AND defense, so i'm actually leapfrogging people who can take magic blows with people who can take phys ones, people with 1 range, 2 range or 1-2 range etc. there's maps where you will get rushed as soon as you start (hoshido ch24) and surviving with everyone intact is a real challenge. you can't lowman because you can't build the OP characters you could in other games. compared to HHM where i'd focus purely on guy, lyn, eliwood hector, jaffar, possibly babysit (forgotten her name, the mage you get same chapter as jaffar). have them all march deep into enemy territory then have seth just physic anyone that happened to actually take any damage.  so on top of what i feel is the best entry to the FE series, we have these additional features that definitely don't detract from the main game.  the 'my castle' hub just serves to replace walking round the map from awakening, you don't have to go to certain shops for certain weapons, they unlock as you upgrade the shop, you have separate currencies for forging and feeding lillith (who's only used in the castle def spotpass maps) and the weird face rubbing - i don't understand it, but it being there definitely doesnt make the game any worse, it's just a feature i won't use.  as for the kids, the eugenics and planning is fun, and adds to thought outside the game, i couldnt give two hoots about their silly plot for being there, it's a side story that again, DOESNT detract from the core experience.  for the separate versions, you are paying basic cost (£30) for ~40 or so unique maps, then a third of that for another ~32 or so, and another third for ~22 more. so for 5/3rds of the cost, you are getting well over two and a half fire emblem games worth.  so please, withold your judgement until you've actually played the game (and not on normal...)"

""Just tell you about Dwarf Fortress"" he says  Well, I'll just tell you right off the bat that it isn't a strategy RPG like Fire Emblem, though it does feature unit growth, permanent death, and huge challenging battles. It's a construction/management/roguelike game. It's kind of like Minecraft in that it's an randomly generated open-world simulator, but that's about where the similarities end. The game gives you a pre-generated world with randomly made-up history, and then you're free to do as you see fit; gather resources, build shit, and fight big monsters.  Basically, you're given a few dwarves, natural resources, and some dirt. Your make-shift objective is to build a sustainable fortress, do trade, and eventually ward off invaders.  The motto of Dwarf Fortress is ""Losing is fun!"" --- for very good reason. It's very plausible that your empire of the past 12 hours will go crashing down in about twenty minutes.  It's a hugely complex game, and you can sink your teeth into the mechanics as deeply as you want. It has an extremely high learning curve. And it looks like this.  This is the kind of make-shift battles that DF has waiting.  /r/dwarffortress -- I've only covered a tiny fraction of what this game is, and I'm not a regular player. Check out their side-bar!"

fireemblem,3dyuh5,Whimsical_Ferret,60,Mon Jul 20 19:29:35 2015 UTC,"No reason to be ashamed of that, but if you want your view changed, SD is my least favorite FE game by a mile. Reclassing and bonus characters for killing your units are awfully implemented. You get less content for succeeding at the game. That is actually my least favorite feature in any FE game.  The story is incredibly bland imo. Characterization is rare, and the few characters that are fleshed out are bland. People shit on Awakening for having 1 dimensional charcters, and then SD has characters like Radd who literally do not have a personality. In fact, most of the SD cast is like that-bland and uninspired.  The game itself is ugly to look at and makes me sad when I try to play it. Level design is almost as bad as Awakening, and there's zero variation in objective. It's just very bare bones compared to any other game."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,Evilgenius1337,11,Mon Jul 20 17:32:37 2015 UTC,"If you haven't read RJWalker's thoughts on Shadow Dragon's minimalist script, I'd strongly recommend it. I agree with him completely on this. Marth is arguably the best lord in the series, and what little dialogue's there for the rest of the cast is quite potent. SD does more with less.   zero variation in objective   Thankfully seize is the best objective."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,Evilgenius1337,36,Mon Jul 20 18:02:27 2015 UTC,"After reading RJwalker's post my thoughts are...no.  I don't agree.  I don't believe less is more here.  Most of the cast are given a couple lines of introduction when you recruit them, if that, and then they're lost in the absolute sea of people you get.  Out of the entire cast I only remember caring about Caeda even a little bit.  Marth is, to me, the WORST lord in the series; even Micaiah (even though I forever resent her godawful speed and terrible promotion times) at least had a bit of punch to her magic and a good backstory.  Marth however never distinguished himself on the battlefield for me, and he was so bland I sometimes got him killed because I forgot he was a unit I was supposed to care about.  The reclass system is boring and unnecessary, the supports are non-existent, and the cast is bloated with boring popcorn characters including the lord.  There is nothing that Marth does that Ike does not do a hundred times better.  People keep saying that SD sacrificed complex characters in favor of a more focused gameplay, but that feels so backwards to me.  For one I don't believe the gameplay in SD was so spectacular to forgive these things, but more importantly the characters are the lifeblood of Fire Emblem.  You want to know why SD can get away with its ridiculous kill-people-to-get-more-people gaidens?  It's because none of the characters have any weight or investment, so you can knock them off like clay pigeons and no one will give a crap.  But if Mia dies in Path of Radiance I'm not just losing a good myrmidon, I'm losing a spunky, funny girl that I've come to like.  And you know why?  She had dialogue, supports, little random bits of characterization long after I recruited her.  That is what gives the permadeath mechanic its value.  If I wanted to play a pure strategy game with sparse characters I'd stick name tags on my chess pieces.  Less can be more.  But not here."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,Evilgenius1337,4,Mon Jul 20 18:35:30 2015 UTC,"characters are the lifeblood of Fire Emblem   Fire Emblem only became a character-focused series after Binding Blade (or, arguably, Blazing Sword).  Permadeath having emotional impact is nice, but its primary function is to meaningfully punish mistakes. In practice, any member of your core squad falling in battle is a lose condition. Most strategy games permit rushdown strategies where characters are temporarily sacrificed for an easy win, and permadeath eliminates this option.   I don't know why you dislike SD Marth. He's okay in combat, has non-combat utility, and has a believable and moving development arc. He's really good! He and Leaf are top two."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,Its_a_Friendly,19,Mon Jul 20 18:42:40 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for FE 1-5, I have't gotten around to playing them.  My first Fire Emblem game was Sacred Stones, and what sucked me into that game and the series as a whole was the characters and story.  When SD rolled around with its sub-par characters I found myself bored to tears, with only light breaks when Caeda or Minerva had their scenes (I forgot to mention Minerva above, but I really do like her, one of the few redeeming points of SD for me).  Strong characters may not be a permanent part of FE history, but they definitely are a defining trait of a good FE, at least in my experience. And yes, permadeath punishes mistakes, but it has more impact in any other FE for 2 reasons.  One is the emotional attachment I already mentioned, and the other is that SD has such a bloated cast that unless one of your ABSOLUTE cores dies (for me Ogma, Caeda, and Minerva), you can just go, oh well, better send off to the factory for a new one.  Killing Navarre isn't as crippling as killing say, Joshua, because there are only a limited number of characters that can cover for Joshua, while I can throw out a fishing line in SD and reel in Athena or honestly any other character (poor Navarre can't even claim to be the only early myrmidon you can get because of the reclass system) and you can probably just keep going.  Hell, SD is DESIGNED to be playable if you axe off your poor, bland soldiers. And as I said, Marth never distinguished himself for me.  He was never a core unit like Ike or Hector.  He was capable, sure, but not outstanding.  If he wasn't the lord I wouldn't have given him a second thought.  And the only thing his character arc moved me to was snores. I wouldn't call SD a bad game in and of itself, I'd still recommend it over most other DS games (not Ace Attorney though.  Sorry Marth, if you had spiky hair and shouted OBJECTION I might have liked you more).  However,  I still stand by that it is the worst Fire Emblem I have played."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,Its_a_Friendly,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:53 2015 UTC,"As I said, the emotive appeal of permadeath in other games is nice. It's just not the main function of a mechanic that's been around since the Famicom days.   There's nothing wrong with preferring a Fire Emblem more focused on characterization. I'm still waiting on the day when the series pulls off compelling development without stooping to silly anime tropes and convenient narrative devices. SD might not have a great cast, but it also doesn't carry that baggage, and that's refreshing for me.   Marth not being an invincible powerhouse in battle is a good thing! Being able to steamroll enemy forces is pretty dull, wouldn't you say?"
fireemblem,3dyuh5,AppoggiAzura,13,Mon Jul 20 19:26:47 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on what aspects you put the most weight.  Me, I'll happily carry the anime baggage if it means I get some good characters.  I'll sit through ten Tharja's if it mean I get a Soren in the mix as well.  I don't need Marth to be an invincible powerhouse, but I do need to be able to rely on him for more than taking out axe users.  He fights like he talks, bland and uninteresting."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,cuddles_the_destroye,7,Mon Jul 20 19:35:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say that the battle-map conversations (both standard and paired last-chapter) in FE4, and the characterization of actually characterized non-lord characters in the other games (Eldigan, Nyna, Mareeta, Eyvel, Finn, Ares, Camus, Travant, etc.) would show that there's certainly quite a lot of characters and story before Binding Blade or Blazing Sword.

fireemblem,3dyuh5,Ownagepuffs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:14 2015 UTC,I have the exact opposite opinion. Games like Xenoblade Chronicles or Final Fantasy or Pokemon or the Wargame series would be worse off if they tried to just stick to the barebones minimum of their genres.

Everyone knows how Final Fantasy has grown over its lifetime. Wargame is one of my favorite RTSes and the most recent iteration has 4 thousamd different units split amomg 17 factions. And they all are sequels/spiritual sucessors to previous works. If the devs decided to strip out features from previous games to ""focus the experience,"" I think the games would be worse as a result. Sure, it will be focused, but i don't think that makes it the end all be all of ""the game is interesting."" A game is way more than how focused the game is on some specific set of gameplay mechanics."

Even still, just because a couple of characters are well developed doesn't excuse the overwhelming majority of the cast. You essentially have a few main characters with customizable faceless units that you can reclass for every battle. A lot of the characters talk once, and they're done. It's hard to find faults in the writing because there's barely any there to scrutinize.  I guess we can agree to disagree on seize. I need defense chapters in my FE."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,dondon151,7,Mon Jul 20 18:11:40 2015 UTC,"Defense chapters are literally the worst objective. Unless they can be ended by kill boss, but then it's just a kill boss chapter with a hard cap on turns."

fireemblem,3dyuh5,flamingtoastjpn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:47 2015 UTC,"I think that's more about shitty map design that being a poor objective. Most defense chapters in FE games involve some sort of 1-tile or 2-tile turtle that you can simply put your tankiest units in until the chapter ends. That map near the end of Sacred Stones where you fight Riev and have to defend the pope is a good example of multiple 2-tile spots and ez turtling. The treasure chests can be easily looted without danger because the enemies that spawn near them aren't very dangerous. As a result, defense maps in FE tend to be very low-pressure and formulaic.  I don't remember the name of the skill, but I do remember trying to do this in Awakening, and an Assassin walked through my turtle unit. THAT is a good mechanic [at least for defence maps], and suits the unit / class thematically."

fireemblem,3dyuh5,flamingtoastjpn,4,Mon Jul 20 22:41:45 2015 UTC,"Ha ha hahahahaha oh boy you have no idea.  Let me break it down in a fairly spoiler free way.  You have 10 units.  Quite a lot compared to the chapters so far, but there are 4 choke points.  It's impossible to cover all 4 well  You get a few minor informational spoilers  The only way I could possibly think of cheesing the map is if you minor informational spoilers.  You have to defend 4 spaces for 11 turns, and you can visit 4 houses that have some useful shit.  The issue is that the map gets flooded with a lot of enemies, like minor informational spoilers will cause you problems.  Turtling might work for a little, but you have a lot of area to cover and can't allow enemy units to get into your little sanctity zone.  The REAL problems however come at turn 7 (remember you have to protect for 11 turns) where after a ton of enemies pour in, literally, minor ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT  So after drugging along for 7 turns hopefully keeping everyone happy and healthy and away from those nasty stat reducing ninjas, you get that for 4 turns.  You gon die, you probably will lose too, because if any enemy gets to any defend square (which they make a rush for) you lose, game over, suck a dick player."

fireemblem,3dyuh5,M2theC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:12:49 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with this. Defense missions are usually trivial because the defend point is easy to defend by simply turtling, so there's a lot of turns where you're essentially doing nothing. Berwick Saga had many pseudo-defense chapters where you escort NPC's to an escape point. It works better because there are multiple NPC's and they're moving so you have to do a sort of ""offensive turtling""  so that you can kill the most enemies with your spread-thin forces while somehow still keeping the NPC's safe. Worth noting is that 1RKO's are rare in this game and the hex-grid makes it harder to defend NPC's.   These chapters still tend to die down when all NPC's escaped and when there are still side objectives that spawn on like turn 20, so you just do boring miscellaneous preparations for it for like five  turns."

I also think chapter 16 is a pretty terrible map too. The left side depends on reinforcements, there are no enemies there to note before them. So you have to walk that long distance around the island if you want Aran or Sampson, with nothing interesting going on the whole way. The fact that Marth has to visit and seize just means you have to face the tedium of walking all that way with a foot unit, with no rescue, for basically nothing."

H5 is super challenging and, except Hyman (the early boss with the hand axe who can ORKO anyone except Ogma or a Nabarl who got 1 hp growth), the game is balanced on weakening enemies from afar then closing in for the kill in a smart manner.

She needs support. (and before you say 'her avoid is godly;' no. it caps at about 30 before you promote her, and if you reclass her to something on the ground before you promote, you lose the ability to use the wing spear. if 6 enemies target her, about 3 of them will hit.)  archers are role players; not centerpiece juggernauts like Caeda.

Fire Emblem has been throughout the series very similar to anime and manga for several real world reasons, something that shows in FE4 (which wouldn't have been made at any time else in the past or future), for example. It has always been fairly light and humorous, and when it was gritty, the entire industry was, even switching directions shortly after (compare and contrast Jugdral with Elibe). Having it be dark and gritty just didn't feel right. Not what I'd call normal for Fire Emblem, nor is it always the best choice (completely different example: TF2 started out ultra realistic, but ended up cartoony and unserious, and it's better for it).  I won't deny that the art direction fits perfectly what it wants to deliver - and that's a great sign of them doing the art direction right. Just doesn't really click with me."

fireemblem,3dyuh5,TheJeffster23,3,Mon Jul 20 18:10:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, I guess? But a) SD kills off many of the strategic elements from earlier games (Rescue, Shove, Skill scrolls) and all we get in return is an arguably worse version of reclassing than what we get in Awakening and Fates (at least there's SOME difference between unit class sets in those, instead of everyone being anything...)  Plus, even though I dislike Awakening for being 90% RPG 10% Strategy, I honestly wouldn't even be playing the games without at least the level of RPG-ness of the GBA games, so SD was just not enough characterization for me."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,DraymondDarksteel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:36:10 2015 UTC,"More options doesn't always translate to better gameplay.  In a broader context, Fire Emblem is a remarkably bare-bones strategy series. This is a good thing. It does not get bogged down in extraneous mechanics or unwieldy calculations.  Rescue and shove would be nice, but the maps aren't designed with them in mind. As I said in my opening post, SD is focused on the basics of tactical gameplay. Positioning, investing in supplies and forges, composing a team to suit your needs. Lacks the potential depth of other games' mechanics, but polished."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,Xator_Nova,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"Ah. I mean, I guess I mostly like Rescue and Shove because they let me account for bad positioning on my part - get a weak unit out of a spot I didn't realize was unsafe until a moment too late, or give someone who needs to be one square closer that extra push."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,GoldenMapleLeaf,4,Mon Jul 20 20:02:43 2015 UTC,"If you only talk about maps sure it's good. However, the story is rather bland and offers no character development. RD imo is superior to all of your points, but it all depends on one's taste. RD is much more grand and deep, but if you're looking for simplistic FE elements SD is the best at it."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,Xator_Nova,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"RD is much more grand and deep   RD may be grand, but it sure as hell ain't deep. Except for part 2."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,GoldenMapleLeaf,5,Mon Jul 20 19:01:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's deep, and far deeper than SD."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,flamingtoastjpn,6,Mon Jul 20 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"Miccy and Skrimir's characterizations were deep, part 2 was very deep, but after the game decides to run its plot on a contrivance as silly as the pact, then it loses any depth. It becomes a slap to the face when you're rooting for Miccy just for her to become a vessel for Ike's personal power up."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,Anuer,3,Mon Jul 20 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"SD is one of the better Fire Emblems. I actually went through the same realizations of you when I went back to play Hard 5. Without warps, the chapters are very rewarding to get through and the map design is actually pretty good. Its not flashy, but it is NOT dull. I think it ultimately suffers the same way GBA FEs suffer, in that in order to get the full experience the player has to gimp his/herself by not warpskipping. In addition, much of the difficulty of FE lies in keeping all units alive, but SD encourages killing off units to get the most gameplay.  But yeah it is one of the better Fire Emblems (though with problems) and severely underrated. I think its failings warp, Gaiden requirements, poor unit balance, make it not the best outright."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,Dilligence,3,Mon Jul 20 18:46:37 2015 UTC,"If you've got a game you enjoy great.   Personally its my least favorite, because of all the cryptic mechanics like killing off character to get secrets ones/best ending. Mostly because characters only are really supposed to die when you make a mistake. Its supposed to be a punishment when you lose units. The game turns me off because it just seems really weird to me that it rewards you for making mistakes like that.   I get that since its one of the first games in the series so its bare bones in a lot of areas. But for the Shadow Dragon remake at least they added some more modern conveniences like map saves. Still wish they colorized your units a bit better."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,DeterminationPsyche,5,Mon Jul 20 20:02:05 2015 UTC,"It's a fantastic Fire Emblem game! There's nothing wrong with making it your favorite, so just go ahead and make it your favorite!"
fireemblem,3dyuh5,Shimitty,3,Mon Jul 20 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the only thing bad I can say about Shadow Dragon is that it's art across the board is terrible. Like, worse than MOST Fire Emblem games. Otherwise, it's been far too long since I played it to give better reasons. It was forgettable and boring imo. The story probably had something to do with that as well."

fireemblem,3dyuh5,RJWalker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:38:20 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
fireemblem,3dyuh5,FemmaMemetale,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:58 2015 UTC,"It's not the best game, and the art style really is putrid... everyone looks like they've been rolling around in mud, and the animations are ridiculously dull when you consider this series gave us the GBA sprites. But... It's got Ballistician Beck, so I really can't hate it."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,RJWalker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:08:36 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem in Shadow Dragon's design is the infinite range Warp staff which breaks the game. Even then, I would argue that it is a good game, with a solid interface that makes the game far more accesible than the original, and it still has the forge and reclass systems to add some complexity that is not present in FE1. I would give it B- or 7/10 in my books, and I think that it gets way more flak that what it deserves. It is far from the best in my opinion, but I still play it and enjoy it more than other games in the series (Controversial opinion: I would play Shadow Dragon above the Tellius games).  I don't buy the argument of the story because none of the Fire Emblem games have a particularly strong story to begin with. FE4 has a really strong concept, but questionable execution, while FE9 has a solid execution with a rather clichéd concept. The rest fall heavily into conventional, puerile fantasy tropes with rather one-note characterizations that we have seen multiple times, with very few nuanced exceptions across the series. I don't play Fire Emblem for the story to begin with. It is the gameplay that drew me into the series, and I believe that some people need to read more books or watch more films if they think that Fire Emblem offers really good, introspective storylines. No offense intended, and it is fine if you enjoy the stories, but... the stories and characters are not the series's strongest asset.  Also, for the people that defend the My Castle feature in Fates just because it is optional... The Gaiden chapters in Shadow Dragon are as well! So, if you think that My Castle is not a detriment to Fates as a game, then you should with the same logic not criticize the Gaiden chapters. Otherwise it is blatant hypocrisy / inconsistency in standards."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,QuadrupleCactus,7,Mon Jul 20 21:29:52 2015 UTC,"My Castle doesn't require mass sacrifice of your units though.   Then again, I don't mind My Castle because it's optional. I don't mind it because I like the farming and setting customization. So maybe I'm the wrong guy to defend it."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,bruhgetreal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:59:40 2015 UTC,"And that is perfectly fine! I am not pointing my finger to everyone who defends My Castle - Only the ones who happen to defend My Castle for THAT reason, yet attack Shadow Dragon for the same thing.  The Gaiden chapters serve to give the player more experience and more units, and I do not believe it was intended as a reward. I don't see why you have to access to every corner of the game. If you're aiming for 100% completion then that is another issue, but it is not precisely hard to do or unfair to the player considering how bad a lot of units are."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,FemmaMemetale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:48:28 2015 UTC,"Fair.  I am a completionist asshat so it does bother me a lot.

Can't even get bragging rights without feeling wrong."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,RJWalker,2,Tue Jul 21 06:55:06 2015 UTC,"So, if you think that My Castle is not a detriment to Fates as a game, then you should with the same logic not criticize the Gaiden chapters.    A+, will steal and use in future debates."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,FemmaMemetale,3,Mon Jul 20 21:31:56 2015 UTC,"OR, or, we can say that it isn't optional because My Castle literally allows you to unlock supports earlier than you otherwise would be able to.  Or say that it's not optional because farming to forge weapons is almost undoubtably necessary (or just plain useful) on the higher difficulties.  Or say that it's not optional because some character recruitments require My Castle fortification    Y'know, if Fates just progressed like Shadow Dragon did, it'd be a much better game IMHO"
fireemblem,3dyuh5,scout033,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:45:11 2015 UTC,Bad arguement.  My Castle is something that rewards you for opting it and investing time. SD Gaiden rewards you for suboptimal play.

fireemblem,3dyuh5,RJWalker,2,Mon Jul 20 22:56:12 2015 UTC,"Colour me shocked. A game that started 25-year-old and counting franchise is a good game. The only problems I have with are the poor characterization of its minor characters and terrible gaiden requirements. An engineer's saying is that something is complete not when there is nothing left to add, but instead when there is nothing left to take away. I feel like SD, while not intentionally, has this sort of place within the FE series.  I actually prefer New Mystery though, with the sole exception of My Unit's personality, which is really, really jarring. I mentioned this before but playing New Mystery in Japanese after having played the original FE3 was when I enjoyed it most, somehow."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,cuddles_the_destroye,2,Tue Jul 21 01:08:30 2015 UTC,"Emphasis on positioning, item management, and army composition (via reclass mechanic).   I think you mean Warp, killing bosses with Shiida, and seizing. Army composition, positioning, and item management are almost totally irrelevant past the midgame because almost all chapters can be warp-skipped."
fireemblem,3dyuh5,RJWalker,5,Tue Jul 21 01:23:35 2015 UTC,"Don't know if I'm ready to accept SD as my new favorite game.    Embrace the glory.  Shadow Dragon is love. Shadow Dragon is life.  Footsteps of Fate! Aaaaaah, so good. Such a perfectly reprsentative piece of music for the chapters it plays in. Same with A Hero's Destiny. In fact, just go listen to Footsteps of Fate, A Time to Act, For Liberty, A Hero's Destiny and Showdown in Dolhr Keep in order. Fucking amazing. All tracks match the story so well.

Meanwhile in Awakening, I like most of the Ablaze variants of the map themes, Miscreant, Mastermind, the deployment theme, Id (purpose), You May Call Me Marth, and Don't Speak Her Name.

EX: the gaidens actually serve to replenish a depleted army. All of the extra units you get are solid and all have higher bases than what you would normally get. No other FE game has thought of the idea where they'd help out a 'struggling' player.  EX2: Jagen is the most frustratingly perfect Jagen in the series. I hate how his bases are basically abel with the promotion bonuses, but it's his starting b rank in lances that sets him apart. then if you reclass him to dracoknight, he'll be able to put in work well into the game, even on H5."

fireemblem,3dyuh5,zairuen,2,Tue Jul 21 10:07:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree on the general statement that FE11 has good maps. Some of its maps are great on H5, but most of them are groaners, with or without Warp.  From what I've played during revising my route (which incidentally I am streaming if you are at all interested), 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 are good maps. Chapter 10 is okay as long as you use Warp. A lot of later maps are either dumped on with Warp or have the problem where there aren't enough enemies to occupy you past like, the first 3 turns. The earlygame maps are overall great if you overlook hit rate issues, though.  Also reclassing is the shit. People hate it because it removes character individuality but I think it's super fun."

fireemblem,3e2ce1,rainbowsnivy,2,Tue Jul 21 12:49:12 2015 UTC,".....So What I'm getting from this is it's like how Payday2 DLC works: You'll update (in this case, buy the cartridge), and say I get t the chapter, choose Hoshido, I can then buy the Nohr DLC and start a new save as Nohr  TL:DR Both routes are on the cartridge, the un-chosen one is locked until purchase as DLC?  My worry is that I'll have to download all of the Nohr route, which terrifies me given my slow download speed and the annoying nintendo shop"
fireemblem,3e2ce1,rainbowsnivy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:38:18 2015 UTC,"Nope.  If I were to buy the Hoshido version (to go along with your example, I'm really a NOHR BOY), then that's the route on the cart. I can buy the Nohr route to do it on a new file but I have to download it to the system first.  Only the Special Edition has both on the cart.  TL;DR your worst fears are realised, only 1 route is on the non-special edition cart."
fireemblem,3e2ce1,Chastlily,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:41:23 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, one game has only one route but you can buy the two others. The third route is strictly DLC  Japan had a special deal where one game cost 40 USD and the other only 20, no clue if we'll get the same treatment though."

fireemblem,3e107y,theussab,11,Tue Jul 21 03:09:30 2015 UTC,"Simple answer? Yes, it is in general an excellent game.  Somewhat more complex, nuanced answer with respect to the rest of the series? Still an excellent game, though it certainly does not adhere to standard FE practices all that much (but do note that a fair bit of what Awakening departed from was started with FE11/FE12, especially FE12); it's fully and perfectly understandable if people dislike it for that reason. Awakening is absolutely not a bad game, though."

fireemblem,3e107y,OtisiulEstrulap,7,Tue Jul 21 09:24:01 2015 UTC,"I'd say the countless positive reviews are probably a good indicator that's it's a great game. It's popular around here to hate it but I'd say in large most people absolutely loved it and it did more for the franchise than any other game in the series. Personally I think it's a great game. Is it my favorite Fire Emblem? No, Rekka no Ken will probably always be my favorite, but I'd have a hard time agreeing with anyone at all who says it's a bad game."
fireemblem,3e107y,rare_umbreon,6,Tue Jul 21 03:22:47 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, The good ol' question of ""is awakening good"". Personally, I don't think there is a game in the series that is necessarily bad, just some are better then others. Honestly, /u/DeoGame explained it perfectly. IS was definitely focusing on the RPG elements more then the strategy. Every character has a support, child units, marriage, etc. Fire emblem fans have very divided opinions on what is more important. Some think they should be less supports, some want more. Some love having an avatar, others don't.  That isn't a bad thing, but it creates a disagreement on which one was the best and which one was the worst. Go back to every ""What is the best game"" thread and you won't find a definite answer.  Awakening, in my opinion, was one of the good ones. Not the best, but pretty great. I loved the multitude of supports, I think Chrom was a decent lord and the characters, oh the characters, easily the best part of my experience with the game. Such a variety of personalities joining together as an army, seeing them develop through the story and supports. I would even be bold enough to say it has the best characters.  HOWEVER, from a strategy standpoint, it is most certainly not the greatest. Open field maps where enemies can run anywhere in a random pattern, Only 2 objectives throughout the entire game ( If you're gonna get to the boss, you're gonna kill everything anyways ), and the capability to basically make your units into unstoppable machines by the midway point. I did not like Awakening as just a strategy game, but more of a SRPG. It is a game that changed a lot about Fire emblem, but still kept to its core gameplay, and that's what I think is important. Think of Awakening as a decent FE cake with some goodies sprinkled all over it. Some will think the cake tastes like shit, some think it is alright and some will love it.  At the end of the day, it's what you think of it that will stick with you. If you didn't like it, that's okay. I loved my experience with it and I will always defend it when it is being bashed on, but that doesn't mean you should think of it as I do."
fireemblem,3e107y,Sabertwooth,2,Tue Jul 21 03:32:10 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, The good ol' question of ""is awakening good""   Yep, comes up all the time. I agree with your post, it was a good game except for the strategy, many open fields and lack of objectives."
fireemblem,3e107y,KingsBlade,6,Tue Jul 21 03:47:43 2015 UTC,"The best strategy involves getting the self-insert to level 18-20 and reclassing while everyone else is level 2. It's a broken strategy game even by the metric of previous broken entries in the series such as Sacred Seth, and at the very least Seth was never sizing up Amelia as potential waifu-bait.  The story is bananas. Cervantes is a meme villain, but the game wants us to take Walmart & co. seriously. The stupid grunts and cut ins are poorly timed and ruin any impact the lines would have had, and they happen on at least half the lines in the game (if not all?)  The graphics are awful. The characters are all either Nomura-style over-designed garbage like Lissa or the Knights or fetish pandering like Nowi or Tharja.  Music is good though.  It's easily my least favorite game in the series by a wade margin."

fireemblem,3e107y,ss977,2,Tue Jul 21 04:12:52 2015 UTC,"It's easy to think it's a bad game when you spend enough time in FE communities. It's a good game but I have some problems with its gameplay. Stat inflation, two objective types, map design tailspinning in the lategame, and major balance issues in Robin, Nostanking, Bonus Box/wireless features, overly generous EXP formula/lowmanning, and Lunatic+.  Sometimes I think the devs got so carried away putting a ton of stuff in it they forgot to balance the gameplay. How does Nosferatu even happen?  Accessibility, presentation, characters, content, and replayability keep me coming back. There's a lot of stuff to do, lot of ways to play; no playthrough takes too long because of streamlined gameplay and convenience features. And it's pretty fun on higher difficulty if you rein in the gamebreakers. I don't want it to be the basis of future titles, not entirely anyway, but as a single game it's great."

fireemblem,3e107y,themythicalcheese,4,Tue Jul 21 03:47:19 2015 UTC,"It would, but its bring the series down. Now every game will have overused animu instead of characters. Now every game will have marriages. Now every game will have mediocre difficulty outside of Lunatic. Do you think ""We'll, these things aren't so bad. Go fuck yourself, salty old timer!""? Let's look at Nino. Nino is quite possibly one of the best written characters in FE. Now imagine how awful it would be if she was replaced with a stereotypical loli who wanted Mark's dick (Just like Isadora, despite the fact that she is engaged, and Lyn, and Ninian). Her character would be ruined. This is what Awakening did to the franchise. I don't care how good Nohr's gameplay is, characters like Camilla fucking ruin any hope for tonal consistency or non waifu ready characters."
fireemblem,3e107y,themythicalcheese,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:00:40 2015 UTC,K good point. But without Awakening we wouldn't ever get any more FE games. But yeah I would donate my lungs to Nintendo if they kept the traditional style and feel.
fireemblem,3e107y,cargup,2,Tue Jul 21 04:07:52 2015 UTC,"That's just the thing! The sales for the series were steadily dropping due to poor management of the series (wonky releases, no advertising outside of Smash), and Nintendo told IS that the next game would be the last, unless it picked up a bit. Any game, given the advertising Awakening got (Two newcomers to Smash, heavy featuring on Nintendo's YouTube channel, actual commercials, perfect release timing) would have sold as well. IS just decided to go full weeaboo and throw every little thing they thought would be cool into the game."
fireemblem,3e107y,themythicalcheese,2,Tue Jul 21 04:16:04 2015 UTC,"Robin and Lucina were announced for Smash long after Awakening had cemented its high sales. I'm sure they led to a bump in sales and interest, but they can't really be considered major factors."

That said, I have a hefty number of grievances against it, it really went against the normal formula of the series, which started in the DS titles. It's far more of an RPG than a strategy game, numbers matter more than tactics, and this gets really noticeable as it goes on.  Doesn't really help that I didn't like the Shonenesque thematic tone it had.  I don't play it much, but when I do, I seldom make it out of midgame. The early portions of the game are the parts I enjoy the most, when your stats aren't significantly higher than the enemies, and when the map design is considerably better. As it goes into late and midgame, the strategy elements become overshadowed by the RPG elements, I normally get bored before I can actually finish it."

After looking at the skills, I looked into what I could do better with Chrom as a support over Great Lord. Did a little digging into Bow Knight and Chrom's abilities a bit more and decided that its happening and that it might actually be a decent support unit.   That said, I'm still contemplating changing Noire. Whilst I think Bow Knight might be decent as a support, I'm not sure on its offensive capabilities compared to a Sorcerer, Hero or Dark Flier - especially since that's the role she'll be filling.

fireemblem,3e25rt,Gadafro,2,Tue Jul 21 11:19:26 2015 UTC,"Names Haar. I write 'Hypotheosis' on this sub. It's a series worth checking out. It's linked in the question thread if you're interested.  Right, to begin with, your pairings are pretty lacking.  Chrom and Olivia is pretty much the worst pairing you can do for Chrom. I've said why here. Chrom X Sumia is best.   Next, MU x Lucina is overrated to all hell. Yes, it gives Robin the DS+ chance but Morgan prefers it more because MMorgan is a better character than Robin. In order to do that, we run a female Robin. Female Robin has Galeforce which makes her superior over Male Robin. Also, making a Male Morgan is better due to, once again, having Lucina able to marry Morgan. This is important because Lucina is the only child that can have consistent 100% DS chance and Morgan is the best child to abuse that due to his superior skill selection. Lucina!Morgan has no benefit either because Aether does little when compared to Vantage Vengeance. I'll talk about that later.  Mostly, you pairings are really unoptimized. I made this for people who want to have really good pairings. Basically, make every Male a Sage and every Female a Dark Flier and you should be fine. Yarne should be an Assassin and Gerome a Bow Knight. Nah works well as a Hero with Axefaire married to a Male with Galeforce.  Defensive Skills don't do well in Apotheosis. They are basically dead weight and a waste of a Skill slot. Skills like Pavise, Aegis, Iote's Shield, and Dual Guard +. Sol, Renewal, Lifetaker, and other healing skills are a waste, too, because you have rallybots for healing.  Hit Increase skills do wonders in Apotheosis. Like Hex and Anathema. There are 99 Luck Sorcerers and 70 Speed Snipers and the boss has 70 Speed as well. Run Hit increases.  Anymore questions, I'll be happy to answer."

I like the sound of using Cynthia!Chrom from the Sumia pairing.   In my current setting, I'm going to forgo all the defensive abilities then (ex: Iote's Shield) in favour for other abilities as well.  I'm also gonna run two saves alongside each other since you've convinced me to go for F!Robin, sounds like fun! Since I wanted to make a StreetPass team out of it as well, I'm going to want the optimized pairings; specifically those that you mentioned.  I've bookmarked that pairing post you linked, the Chrom's pairing one as well, and I'm also gonna look into the Hypotheosis (I see what you did Haar) series that you wrote, thanks for the feedback!"

Are there some specific units that make for better support or is it mostly just anyone who can be a FK and Rally?"
fireemblem,3e25rt,HaarTheBlackTempest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"Spotpass characters. Any Female. DLC Palla has Rally Strength which is nice. The Katarina you get from completing Apotheosis has Rally Strength as well. They work well because most good rallys are female exclusive and they have access to Grandmaster which has Rally Spectrum. Rally Heart, Speed, and Move are female exclusive too. We don't care about it, but Rally Res is female exclusive too. Rally Strength is male exclusive, but it's meh."

(Hell, the only reason have a problem with Ganon is because he is not ""Zeldaish"" enough)  I could see the Mario/Dr. Mario resemblance but even then, Dr. Mario is still a million times more unique than Lucina.

You can play a clone character differently from who they're based off of but Lucina plays exactly same minus the effectiveness of properly spacing. If she was a tad different I(and possibly others) wouldn't mind her inclusion."
fireemblem,3dzbw8,alex6309,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:07:09 2015 UTC,"She didn't take anything away from any other characters.

fireemblem,3e1o6k,ToastyGrill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:18:43 2015 UTC,"I personally buy all my packs and starters from AmiAmi, I live in Sweden and I don't think the shipping is too expensive, some people might though. I buy individual cards on eBay.  Also, you do know that FE Cipher is only available in Japanese at this moment right? If your young cousin just want to collect the cards then that won't be a problem. If he's looking the play the game itself though it might be cumbersome to do that but there are translations of the rules and all the cards over at Serenes Forest.  Hopefully this helps a little^ ^"
fireemblem,3e1o6k,Vikeo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:15:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. Yeah, he wants them for the artwork, not the actual game, (maybe in time he may eventually want to learn how to play though). He's the collecting sort, and I have got him pretty invested in the FE series so he couldn't resist."
fireemblem,3e1o6k,shinami,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:36:10 2015 UTC,"I know you got the base answer hours ago and no one else has really commented, but I thought I'd give youa few more thoughts.  Amiami truly is the best route in this. I've looked at other import sites, forwarding services like FromJapan, even some individuals who I know do pickups in Japan, and Amiami is the best in terms of price.   Now as to the cards, is he aiming to get them all or only favorites? Because if all I'd then recommend buying both decks (as they have cards unique to them, for instance Miriel, Kellam, Ricken, Vaike, etc in Awakening's and holos for Stahl and Sully and more that only appear in the deck, don't have Marth's deck yet) and one booster box. But even with the booster box you'll probably be anywhere from 20-10 cards short of the full 100 card set (I didn't get any duplicate R or SR cards and am 12 short).  At this point it's your choice if you want to stop, buy another booster box (guarenteeing 16 more R or SR cards) or to buy them individually, but individually you'd need to buy them from a site like Yahoo Japan Auctions becuase the Ebay prices are stupid, and even then some cards are still expensive (SR Tharja runs for $15-20, SR Chrom $10, SR Marth $20, etc, rest are pretty tame at $4 or less). And don't even try to get all the promos, those are very costly. Chrom is my husbando but even I cringed staring at his $25 promo (which I then have to add the $2 auction fee, bank transfer fee, domestic shipping, international shipping...).  If you want a catalog of all the cards, here you go: http://fecipher.jp/cards/BT0001.html  Click the pics to see them bigger. On the left side are link to seeing all the deck cards and the promo cards.  Hope my answers were thorough!"
fireemblem,3e1o6k,shinami,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, Amiami is pretty much decided now. I probably should have mentioned in the initial post I'm not completely uninformed on the cards, i've been quite curious seeing all the artwork and redesigns of Shadow Dragon especially. I was just tipped off by the ebay prices as it is pretty clear to see why one would be.  Now i'm not entirely sure, and if they're not a nightmare like Amiibos, he'll probably eventually want to get as many as he can, at least from the games he knows. unfortunately, he's only 10 (yeah) so he's no exactly leaking with money (though he he gets pretty spoiled). This may get kind of messy, I'm worried how well he'll be able to collect them. My guess is he'll stop after his favourite comes out.  If you don't mind me asking, do you know the ways in which you get the promo cards? Have any of the events already passed?"

Anyways, yesterday I started playing it FE12 for the first time (loving it so far), and I got up to chapter 3. Thing is, there´s this guy called Matthis who you can recruit, but he seems quite annoying because you have to take a really long path to avoid him killing himself (unless I´m missing something). Now, I normally try to recruit everyone, but this guy seems so useless that i´m kinda doubting if I even want to bother with him. That´s why I´m letting you guys decide. So, do I #SaveMatthis or #KillMatthis?"

However I am soft-hearted so I always do the long way. #SaveMatthis  Also, good to know that you are liking FE12 so far. It is one of my favorite games and I find it terribly underrated by most people, specially in the strategic aspect (in which is one of the best in the series)."

Enemy placement has been fantastic, you can´t just pull them one by one, which is a big issue because most of my team can´t survive 2 hits. If it wasn´t because my MU is stupidly broken, this would easily be one of the hardest earlygames I´ve played in this series. Loving the map design so far."

High growths keep him relevant at least up to Ch. 16, but increasing enemy stats prevent him from attaining Seth status.  I'm starting to see he can be even more dominant with a steady stream of kills though...in my Avatarless Lunatic run he's a 20/2 Wyvern Lord with 25 Str/26 Spd/24 Def. What a champ. He really blossoms when Robin isn't stomping all over the game, but he still can never solo without extensive grinding.  Gunter seems really cool as well. I couldn't help but laugh at his growths and bases. I never thought we'd see the return of FE6-Marcus-style Jagens in modern FE. It's nice and gives me some hope for FE14's balance.  I'm not far into T776 but Dagdar just seems really amazing with his capturing Build and his bases in the game with growth-increasing scrolls. He's already helped me through many of the early chapters."

fireemblem,3dz8zz,cargup,3,Mon Jul 20 20:13:23 2015 UTC,"Well it shouldn't be too bad, Freddy get's pretty generous gains EXP compared to most Jeigans. He's pretty much mandatory on the higher difficulties, so he sees a lot of use, especially since one of the most efficient strategies is lowmanning. I guess I don't pay a lot of attention, but it's certainly doable."
fireemblem,3dz8zz,QuadrupleCactus,2,Mon Jul 20 20:15:18 2015 UTC,"He reached L20 Great Knight in Kjelle's chapter, which I entered after Ch. 13 + all the earlygame paralogues. That gives you an idea of how much I relied on him. To be honest, I think I used him too much. My plan for this run was to train three first-gen couples and their kids: Chrom/Sumia, Stahl/Sully, and Cordelia/Lon'qu. But Frederick just shit on the game so hard Cordelia/Lon'qu, and Stahl/Sully to a lesser extent, had few opportunities to contribute.  What ended up happening is that going into Ch. 12 (timeskip), everyone except Frederick was really mediocre. It was really fun not being able to breeze through the chapter with a few powerful units. But eventually I had to drop Cordelia/Lon'qu and Stahl because they were just too weak.  Realizing Frederick was not going to keep up forever, I focused all my resources into training a really squishy Galeforce Lucina and an initially slow Cavalier!Kjelle.  Sooo...point is I just used him a lot. He's done with anything major after Ch. 17 for sure. The enemies are just too fast and strong. If I ever do this again, I'll focus on fewer couples, or slow down a bit because Frederick just tears up the first arc if you let him."
fireemblem,3dz8zz,cargup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:32 2015 UTC,Did you grind at all? Because I'm not seeing how you get Sumia to level 15 dark flier and Freddy to level 20 by that stage of the game
fireemblem,3dz8zz,QuadrupleCactus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:06:43 2015 UTC,"Nope...but I honestly thought I might have to at one point. Everyone was just so bad.  Frederick got to L20 effortlessly just by being awesome. But I did have to get creative with Sumia come Lucina's recruitment chapter. First I let her roll over Paralogue 4 (Anna's recruitment), giving her as many of the kills as possible, pushing her from L7 to L10.  Then I had nothing left to give her except the enemies in Ch. 13. Wasn't even sure there was enough EXP for L15, but taking reinforcements into account, I realized there was. So again, let her kill basically everything here, including reinforcements. But to do that without getting her killed (every bow user was one-shotting her with high accuracy), I needed a lot of Rescue and dancing from Olivia, with occasional input/chokepoint from Frederick.  Edit: Worth noting I did promote Sumia at L10 or this wouldn't have been possible."

I wanted to see how FE:A feels without Robin...if it's more like a traditional FE (answer: eh, kind of...prone to the same gamebreakers though). So I had to do some things differently. I did some things poorly, like EXP distribution. But I'm satisfied I managed to salvage the run without skirmish/DLC grinding.  I definitely recommend you try grindless one day...it's nothing too offensive because of Robin. And Frederick is your god early on, but I may have gotten carried away in this case."

He's useful for chapters up to and including chapter 7, which in Fe6, as well as most of the games, the first few chapters are the hardest, so he helps out the player massively until their replacement growth units get their feet under their legs, in this case, Alen and Lance should be nearing or surpassing Marcus at around this time, which is right when Marcus starts to fall off. If the player doesn't have Allance up to Marcus' par at this point, they also get Zealot, which is pretty much everything Marcus is, except slightly better, so the player still isn't screwed when their original Jaigen is falling off"

FE6 Marcus is awesome and is able to help your team until the Western Isles without falling off, but in the Etruria and Sacae/Illia Arcs he is a unit that won't contribute and can even be a liability, so you need to train others to take his place.  Also, he is a motherfucking boss."
fireemblem,3dz8zz,Metaboss84,7,Mon Jul 20 23:26:36 2015 UTC,"Gonna go with Marcus as the best representation, because he genuinely does fall off. He's very useful in earlygame HM to weaken units, but overly relying on him is a bad thing.  Arran also works, though he is a little bit too quick to fade into obscurity."
fireemblem,3dz8zz,SabinSuplexington,6,Mon Jul 20 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"Arran is the best because he's also the worst.  Also, I guess we're separating Oifaye's? Just asking, because I'm wondering if there's a consensus about Freddy being one or the other."

fireemblem,3dz8zz,Vineron,6,Mon Jul 20 19:12:55 2015 UTC,"Dear god ,is it supposed to be spelled Jeigan or Jagen? STOP CONFUSING ME.  Anyway Jagens are pretty cool units, but I honestly think Marcus is the best implemented one. He doesn't utterly break the game but hes useful for more than five seconds, hell in some cases he is out right needed for those first few chapters. He isn't useful the whole game but damn is he useful when he is needed the most.  Arran has pretty much no need to exist, and his stats aren't even that great. He is literally only useful for maybe going dracoknight and flying but that's about it.  Eyvel is kinda strange, she disappears for the entire game past the first few chapters basically and isn't really much use before you lose her besides being a boss killer, and she isn't even really needed for that. I guess at least she definitely does fall off?  I honestly don't know if I would consider Fred a Jagen. But then again I guess by FE13 standards he is, but everyone in that game is pretty much decent no matter what, even Fred.  I honestly probably am not the best person to ask to gauge a Jagens usefulness since I haven't really played the higher difficulty of a good majority of the games yet(though I am finishing FE12 hard at the moment). So maybe take my opinions with a grain of salt."

The general idea is that many people translated the FE1 and FE3 long before FE11 (Shadow Dragon) was localized. The direct translation gives is Jeigan, while the localization is Jagen. The same issue is there with Narbl (or however they spell it)/Navarre and Shiida/Caeda. (the second one is the offical localization while the first is the direct translation.)"

fireemblem,3dz8zz,NotJim-,5,Mon Jul 20 21:17:17 2015 UTC,"The Jagen archetype is certainly interesting. Despite the fact that they eventually fall off, their contributions to the early game often make them some of the best units in their games.   I think FE6 Marcus is a good representation of the archetype due to falling off about midgame, while FE12 Arran isn't a good representation since he's only useful until Chapter 4.  On a side note, why are there so many spellings for ""Jagen"" despite the fact that his name has already been localized? It kinda bothers me."

It kinda bothers me.   Because plenty of people here were probably fans of the series before it was localised for Jagen, which was FE11. Those people will then use the spellings they know, and others may pick up on it, and so that's why old spellings would be in use.  It's like how I'll probably call FE14's MU Kamui even though it's localised, and Rinka won't gain that h."
fireemblem,3dz8zz,Its_a_Friendly,2,Mon Jul 20 20:07:15 2015 UTC,"I'm referring to things like the OP, where he called the character Jagen but the archetype Jeigan. I see variations of Jagen way more than I see Marich or Doga."
fireemblem,3dz8zz,Its_a_Friendly,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:59 2015 UTC,"Probably because the Jeigan name was/is applied to a very well-known archetype, and thus has been kept, while the other two are applied to less-known archetypes, if archetypes at all. Plus Jeigan is pretty similar to the official translated name of Jagen, so perhaps nobody really bothers to change it."

I agree with the general consensus that FE6 Marcus was implemented the best out of these."
fireemblem,3dz8zz,rattatatouille,3,Mon Jul 20 20:03:28 2015 UTC,"He can't really do well lategame, he's kinda just in the middle. Most jagens given FE13's story structure, would fall off at the end of arc 1 or the beginning of 2, but Frederick falls of at around the end of arc 2. A true Oifey would have good level 1 GK stats and not really fall of ever."
fireemblem,3dz8zz,Fermule,3,Mon Jul 20 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"He still definitely doesn't hold true to the bases and no growths though, he's like an anti Jagen who still falls off in the end.

fireemblem,3dz8zz,Pokegoldmine,3,Mon Jul 20 20:08:37 2015 UTC,Frederick has poor bases but good growths   Given how FE13 is growths emblem it's arguable in that context Fred functions well as a Jagen in his specific game

I played the games I'd missed after playing and loving Awakening (PoR, RD, SD, and NM) and realized that the series hadn't gone downhill and the fandom was just bigger than it used to be and I'd been a fucking baby.  And here I am!"

It helps that the area I'm from is VERY multilingual and I already spoke two languages at that time. I find people who grow up in single language areas are more likely to be uncomfortable or frustrated by foreign languages, whereas those of us who grow up in multilingual areas find it pretty normal to struggle through shit we don't understand, haha.   Did you follow the development of emulation and fan-translations for the series at all?   Yes! I did. Iiiii actually did some translation work on one of the major patches I'm pretty sure most of this sub has played if they've played the older games, BUUTTT I'm not going to go into more detail than that because I'm intentionally distancing myself from being recognized by any of the old guard that might be still around. Also it was ages ago and my work on the patch in question is kind of embarrassing now >_> But it's a fun bit of trivia :D   You're the person who wrote the censorship piece the other day. Did you play the Japanese version of each game first, or did you play them after playing NA versions?    Like I said before, I speak multiple languages, and the BAD thing about that is that the more languages you know, the harder it is to keep all your languages sharp. It's like juggling, and the more balls you have in the air, the harder it gets. In the ten years since I mostly left Japanese games and media, my Japanese has gone to seed completely. I can still read it but I wouldn't trust myself to write or speak, and I'm not super confident in my translations if I don't use references and take a long time on them.  All this to say: no, I didn't play through the Japanese versions of the newer games at all. I've read scripts of parts I was interested in for PoR, RD, and Awakening, but only after I'd played through them in English first. Haven't bothered much with the Japanese versions of SD or NM at all because I already knew all the dialogue from the previous versions.  EDIT: I'm also not importing the Japanese version of Fates because I just don't want to get attached to its script when so much could change. I've learned my lesson. I've read some supports and dialogues but that's it."

About a year or two after I had played FE7 for the first time (2012) I learned about Smash, and that Marth and Ike were in Brawl. I hadn't played their Fire Emblem games, but I at least knew they were Fire Emblem characters. I didn't have a Wii or a Gamecube and didn't hang out with a lot of people, so I didn't realize how many people played Smash. As it turns out, I was one of the rare people who started playing Smash because they had Fire Emblem characters (specifically once Robin was confirmed)."

Being that I run the debate series and am a somewhat frequent poster, I didn't want to be associated with that image, and there wasn't much else I could do to get rid of that.

I wound up playing Blazing Sword when my friend got it, I think either when it was new or when sacred stones was. I remember seeing stuff about SS in Nintendo Power and being interested but not having a chance to get it, becoming kinda interested in the GBA hacks, then seeing stuff about PoR and buying it and not being able to beat it, then getting RD on launch day and finally becoming a big fan of the series. Oddly enough, the first game I beat was RD even though it's agreed to be the hardest of the first few I played ._.

fireemblem,3dydqy,PureSteve,4,Mon Jul 20 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"Well, as /u/GoldenMapleLeaf wrote, putting the Melee option in can be seen as splitting hairs, and you're right in that some people who voted for the GBA games probably actually knew Marth and Roy through Melee first, but my interpretation of the Melee vs GBA options is that it is based on which one interested you in the FE series first. For Melee voters, ""it was Melee that generated interest in the FE series"". Hence why some people who played Melee first might actually select the GBA option because they may not have cared about Marth and Roy in Melee before playing the games.  Obviously I'm not the poll-maker and this is just my explanation for my vote, but I know that I picked Melee because the process of learning about FE through Melee was my initiation into the series and being an FE fan, and I know that some of the other Melee voters expressed similar ideas."

I had a friend a few years back who had Sacred Stones, and would always tell me about how much he liked it. This was like a year before a Brawl came out. I didn't grow up with Melee as a kid, so I didn't know about Marth or Roy when I was younger.  I did play Melee, but only for a few minutes, and I did not actually own the game unfortunately. I saw Marth, but I was not familiar with him at all, and I couldn't tell what game he was from.   When I picked up Brawl and saw that Marth and Ike were from FE, my first thought was: ""Where's Eirika? Isn't she from FE? Where is she?"" Fast forward to 2011, I introduced one of my good friends to Marth and Ike since we liked pretty anime boys. Yeah, pretty shallow, but that's how we first got sucked into FE. Again, I had no clue who Roy was until like a few years later...  That same year, I got FE8 for my emulator, and I managed to find a cartridge of FE7 a little later. Around late 2011, early 2012, I found myself looking at some of the older FE games like FE4/5, and I ended up getting into those games as well.

Then I played FE7, then I attempted (but never finished) FE6 and FE11. Then I bought FE10, beat it, then realized I needed FE9 in... 2012 maybe? Played FE9, it was my favorite game but to this day I have never beaten RD with transfer bonuses (I'm the guy who needed my RD disc fixed and I got like 70 upvotes after asking for no upvotes).

I knew about FE way before that thanks to Smash, but didn't really know enough about it to determine whether or not I'd even like it. Hell, I don't think I even knew it was a strategy series. If it weren't for the fact that I got a chance to dip my toes into the series for free and find out how much I loved it, I probably would have ended up being introduced by Awakening thanks to it's immense popularity. Despite the fact that I love both the ""old"" and the ""new"" Fire Emblem equally, I can confidently say that I'm happy  to have experienced classic FE first, as I think it's given me a better idea of why certain series veterans are pissed off at the change that's taken place. I think I've been around this sub for a month or so now, or at least I feel like I have been.

As much as I love PoR now I initial wasn't all that impressed with it and only got through the first 5 chapters so I returned it. Not to long after I got a copy of RD for about $20(this was like 5-6 years ago don't expect to find it that cheap now) and ended up loving it; that was the game that ended up getting me into the franchise.

After that I joined this community, or at least was a bit of a lurker. Then I heard how good Genealogy of the Holy War was and went and played that and eventually went on to play FE6, FE7, and FE8.

So I mained Marth in Melee and enjoyed every minute of it. Naturally, I wanted to know more about this totally unknown character so I looked at his trophy description as he was a ""banished prince"" that had to take back his kingdom,"" which made me really interested in the FE series. I can't remember why, but it was difficult for me to get a hold of the FE games as a kid, probably because there weren't a lot of copies floating around. But my first FE ended up being Radiant Dawn.

She lets Jarod go, and he returns to raises a resistance against her. She tries to ambush Sanaki with oil and fire which results in her best friend almost dying. Some of her soldiers (Jill, Ilyana) do question her motives and defect to the other side because they don't know about the blood pact. She blindly follows Pelleas to a fault. I think there's good arguments on both sides, but I'm leaning no."
fireemblem,3dym8o,Whimsical_Ferret,18,Mon Jul 20 16:32:51 2015 UTC,"I think she's a terrible character and by far my least favorite FE protagonist, but I never considered her a Mary Sue. Haven't played RD in a while, but I just remember feeling really morally detached from her as she blindly supported her country's terrible government and somehow came to the conclusion that it was Ike's fault that Ashnard fucked up her country. All that on top of her being one of the weaker protagonists in the series makes her far too flawed to be considered a Mary Sue IMO."
fireemblem,3dym8o,Aetheer,5,Mon Jul 20 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"I think Micaiah's personality really suits a problem they were building up in Path of Radiance. When Ike and Elincia were attacking Daein to reclaim Crimea, they kept seeing people who refused their help / confronted them because they thought the Crimean army were the aggressors. Daein seemed in general to be a really patriotic country, so of course the people didn't believe it was their own government who ruined them, so it must be Ike's fault. Micaiah is supposed to embody the people of Daein more than anything else, so she has the flaws and strengths of those people, mostly. Also her position in the game puts her as an enemy of people we already know and who's story we follow. They couldn't make Micaiah a good character without demonizing someone important on the other side, but all the important people (Ike, Elincia, Sanaki) are all supposed to be good. The end result is that they try to make her likable without have a reason to actually like her because we already see that she's fighting against the heroes.   Micaiah is an alright character to me, just her biggest problem is that she was written into a corner to begin with and got so much story time that her character flaws are pretty exaggerated."
fireemblem,3dym8o,rulerguy6,5,Mon Jul 20 21:50:41 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good point, but then it just makes me think that Daein is a pretty shitty country that desperately needed to go through some change if they're going to support someone like Ashnard simply due to patriotism.   And I think the whole idea of pitting someone against the main character of a previous game for the sake of conflict sort of immediately puts the new protagonist under scrutiny. Ike has the advantage of going through a whole game's worth of character development prior to RD, which makes it hard to sympathize with Micaiah from the get-go. It's a novel idea, to force the player to fight against characters they already know and possibly love, but to me, I like Ike enough that it just felt so wrong to be fighting him. Maybe if I liked Micaiah more it wouldn't have felt like that, but being forced to play as her really made it hard for me to enjoy the game."
fireemblem,3dym8o,Aetheer,9,Mon Jul 20 22:16:23 2015 UTC,"I mean it was already established with Jill's supports that Daein was pretty ruthless and brainwash-y. But yeah, that was basically Micaiah's biggest character problem. We knew she was on the wrong side in her fight for the majority of her battles, because we already knew Ike and Crimea would be on the ""right"" side. The 10 chapters to develop her character weren't nearly enough to flesh her out, so they tried to make her as sweet and likable as possible, resulting in the sort of Mary-Sue air people seem to be getting. Eventually it's shown she can fail (which is when she goes up against the actual heroes) but by then it's kind of late to save her development, and the other characters have to blindly follow her and Pelleas for the most part anyways to keep the rest of the story intact."
fireemblem,3dym8o,rulerguy6,24,Mon Jul 20 22:49:03 2015 UTC,"Funny thing about people calling her a Mary-Sue: Micaiah makes more mistakes than any lord but Eirika and Leif. You want a Mary-Sue, you have Robin, Ephraim, and Roy for that."
fireemblem,3dym8o,estrangedeskimo,17,Mon Jul 20 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"It's not that she doesn't make mistakes, it's that there's absolutely no consequences to those mistakes. No matter what she does, no matter how stupid and moronic an idea it is, it always ends up going well and everyone praises the hell out of her for them."
fireemblem,3dym8o,Eastern-Eagle,11,Mon Jul 20 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"Except when she continues the fight against Laguz Alliance, and Jill and Ilyana abandon her because of it. Sothe constantly questions why she continues the war. Or when Tibarn almost kills her only friend because her plan failed."
fireemblem,3dym8o,Whimsical_Ferret,3,Mon Jul 20 19:00:02 2015 UTC,"Everyone does question why she's still fighting the war, but the majority of them remain with her, even when the player never sees her act anything like a decent leader. Even when her attack on Sanaki fails, she still gets heavily praised for it, and because they let Sothe go for no reason, her mistake doesn't even come back around to her.   Everyone goes out of their ways to praise her, and they place an unbelievable amount of trust in her methods that the player only ever sees go awry."
fireemblem,3dym8o,Eastern-Eagle,11,Mon Jul 20 19:23:58 2015 UTC,"The player sees her as a decent leader when she becomes general of the Daein Liberation Army and secures independence for her country. She's a decent leader because she started a band of fighters which later became an army. No Micaiah means no successful revolution.  When she fails to defeat Sanaki, she is not praised. Someone in the other army (I forgot who, Soren or Sanaki I believe) specifically says, ""Oil and fire? What is she thinking?"" as to say her strategy was terrible. The citizens of Daein support her because she just liberated them. Her own army does not. Like I said, Jill, Zihark, and Ilyana desert her. Izuka is pissed. Tibarn lets Sothe go because they know each other; they fought together in the same war.   She is praised because she was the determining factor in achieving freedom for Daein. She was the people's rallying cry."
fireemblem,3dym8o,Whimsical_Ferret,2,Mon Jul 20 19:35:07 2015 UTC,"That's the idea of what Micaihah is supposed to be, and it does have merit, it's just that you never see her do anything to deserve it. They make her general, even though she doesn't do anything to suggest that she'd be a decent military leader, they all follow her plans and find them to be extremely good ones, even when they make no sense and always end up going wrong.   Micaihah is based an idea that has a whole lot of merit, and if she was implemented well, she might have been one of my favorite lords, but I've always found her execution to be sorely lacking."
fireemblem,3dym8o,Eastern-Eagle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:23:42 2015 UTC,"the whole point of Micaiah was how over her head she was when it came to leading an army/country.  she was literally a deconstruction of the ""wide eyed idealist"" trope that the series loves to use for their main characters.  in fact, it can directly be attributed to Micaiah that Daien was fucked over by Begnion and Izuka in the first place.  this whole shit is on her shoulders, and is partly the reason why she's so hard on herself during the war.  The Tellius saga overall was about deconstructions.  We have Daein, which showed that ""evil"" countries are composed of people.  Micaiah was obviously over her head when it came to leading a nation because she was a nobody before and was not prepared.  Likewise, Elincia wasn't ready yet for the nightmare that was leading a nation.  Crimea showed that after a war, there isn't a peaceful time that follows, but one of great instability.  Begnion, the religious country, was corrupt to the core, and their leader an ""usurper.""  and not to mention the fact that the divine figure isn't necessarily benevolent, but is literally beyond the concept of good and evil.    to say that we never see Micaiah ""do anything to deserve it,"" is to criticize pretty much every other Fire Emblem lord before her.  almost all start with a ragtag group that follow the lord because they believe in him or her.  the only difference here is that in RD, they literally treat Micaiah the way it would likely pan out if someone like the FE lords made it to such an influential position."
fireemblem,3dym8o,Kubla_Khan,12,Tue Jul 21 18:14:06 2015 UTC,Except for the time when she gets Nevassa destroyed by letting Jarod live. That's a pretty big consequence.
fireemblem,3dym8o,estrangedeskimo,11,Mon Jul 20 18:05:34 2015 UTC,"And it all turns out well and is never really mentioned again after they stop him. Even after that, no one criticizes her for that mistake, they all still treat her as if the entire victory was because of her."
fireemblem,3dym8o,Eastern-Eagle,22,Mon Jul 20 18:10:06 2015 UTC,"Compare that to the consequences faced by Robin, Roy, Ephraim... Which don't exist. The game doesn't need to go ""hey, remember that Micaiah did something bad"" in order for the player to recognize that, especially since all of part 3 is pointing out ""Micaiah without her powers is really not that special."" Part 1 Micaiah is able to do what she does because the voice of Yune is guiding her. She is supposed to seem infallible. Towards the end of part 1 she messes up big time, but she takes responsibility for that, and fixes what she did.   When she loses that voice in part 3, you see that she really has no idea what she's doing. She is constantly losing battles to Ike, her plans are all over the place and become quite desperate. Part 3 Micaiah is obviously struggling, and it takes a physical toll on her. You never see that struggle in most other lords, you never see them at this low weak point where nothing they are doing is working. It's hard to call Micaiah perfect when every single battle she is involved in in Part 3 ends in her defeat."
fireemblem,3dym8o,estrangedeskimo,3,Mon Jul 20 18:21:55 2015 UTC,"Uhm, remember when she almost lost Sothe because of her mistake on fighting the Apostle?"
fireemblem,3dym8o,OtisiulEstrulap,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can justly call Robin a Mary-Sue because it is a self insert, but for the player and not the writer. It's all strategies to make the game more popular for casual players at that point, but in general I wouldn't put it in the same boat. It's more like having a dragonborn-esque player character from Skyrim in a game where it makes a lot less sense, but that's not really a Mary Sue.  But at this point I'm just arguing semantics. I don't really want to be defending Robin.  I also just realized the dragonborn thing was a lot more accurate than I originally intended."
fireemblem,3dym8o,zairuen,19,Mon Jul 20 22:23:27 2015 UTC,"Do people still think that she's a Mary Sue?  I thought that we had settled this argument years ago.

fireemblem,3dym8o,Kubla_Khan,9,Mon Jul 20 17:18:25 2015 UTC,"No, not any more than Ike.  She has magic, healing and garldrl(?) instead of swords and the awesomeness, she's basically Ike's opposite-but-similar character story-wise."
fireemblem,3dym8o,vslds,3,Mon Jul 20 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest about the healing though. Story-wise I like it, but gameplay wise it couldn't have gone on a worse character. It takes from her already low HP pool, she has low defense and speed to tank the hits on her now lowered HP, and she's unmounted so she can't heal then move to a safe distance. Plus she gets staves anyways! Sacrifice's only use is healing status ailments, but by the time the enemy actually uses sleep/berserk, Micaiah's either not there or you have her with a restore staff anyways."
fireemblem,3dym8o,rulerguy6,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:21 2015 UTC,"She's a frail mage, she should never be in danger of being hit anyway.  Besides, the Part 1 Seraph Robe goes great on her for maximum Sacrifice capability. Or Jill. Whatever you're into."
fireemblem,3dym8o,burdturgler1154,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:16:07 2015 UTC,"I get that, but normally it's frontliners that need to be healed, leaving her in range of arrows and stuff. With a normal priest it's not that bad because they keep all their health, but Micaiah can easily be knocked down to one health by healing Nolan or Edward due to her really bad starting HP and growth. Even a Seraph robe just puts her slightly under average HP for a few levels."

If I liked a character in RD, it was because they did well in battle, not because I liked them as a character.

Coming to a conclusion from a few posts and comments isn't the best idea since it ignores everything else. Ike had a huge warm reception when he was confirmed in sm4sh and he even recently won a popularity contest in Japan.  With more exposure things will have more fans and haters. I'm more inclined to think something is up if the most popular lords didn't have some haters. As an extreme we could look at how many people love/hate Alm as a character compared to someone like Lucina. Jugdral isn't frequently played by the typical Fire Emblem fan but criticisms are there.

People can be wrongly assuming that their opinion is unpopular.   Coming to a conclusion from a few posts and comments isn't the best idea since it ignores everything else.

Ike's sm4sh reception was welcomed everywhere on the Internet and there's still the occasional ""Tellius Impressions"" thread here where there's lots of love.   Upvotes and downvotes aren't an agree/disagree function and I'm finding it difficult to believe Haar is right in any of his points simply because he was upvoted.   Looking back there have been a number of polls on this sub where Tellius has beat out most other games barring like awakening or something. Ike even had to be banned from a character/popularity tournament months ago because he won a previous contest convincingly.   You're right, the hate isn't niche. It just isn't approaching anywhere near the majority and as a side note: ""I know X is popular"" aren't usually intended to be malicious.   Anyways, have a fantastic day."

I'm just saying that those that don't aren't at all special for it. It's a widely held opinion. As a side note, Ike's sm4sh reception 'everywhere on the internet' is for Smash Ike, how many people on the Smash sub, or that play Smash, actually know Ike?  I'm aware that the vote buttons aren't agree/disagree, but people use them as such. That's why the actual unpopular opinions (mostly) are down voted.  As for the popularity contest where Ike was banned, things have changed since then. In /u/PKThoron's current tournament, Ike was getting 1s against nobodies, it's clear to see that he is not even close to the most successful character in the tourney. There has been a significant shift in opinion.  Have a fantastic day too."

That's when I did most of my criticizing and even now I still have plenty of complaints however, people actually listen now and agree which is why I have tones it down since other people will say it why do I have to?

fireemblem,3dym8o,Shimitty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:27:36 2015 UTC,"She's not a mary sue by any definition -- what with how much that term has been warped over the years -- but she toes the line. Most of this is the story's fault, although she has some really big moments of being a dumbass that she never gets called out on.  The problem that ties heavily into the dislike of Micaiah is how Daein is glorified as a good country, victimized by the brutal Begnion. While it definitely is being destroyed by the latter, PoR contradicts that narrative that RD tries to set in regards to Daein. Granted, we only see that part of the conflict through the Crimean Army's point of view, but then we have a group of characters that were present during then spouting off what we hear in RD.  I think my main problem with Micaiah is that she never ever has to answer for anything morally dubious or idiotic she does. Part 4 is her absolute worst, given how her characterization just goes off the rails, but there's plenty of things to criticize in the first two parts too. Wandering into a dark forest by herself, despite being in enemy territory, and then letting Jarod go after the Black Knight corners him? Given that she's supposed to have foresight -- something the game never imposes rules on and just has 'happen' -- makes her a convenient but infuriating plot device. Part 3 has a lot of stuff she does that's already been raked over the coals, so I'm not going to get into that.  Micaiah never has to confront or question the dark side of Daein. If something related to it ever does come up, like laguz joining the liberation army -- the game makes excuses for her to ignore it and go on like everything's fine. Instead, she gets to be the mouthpiece of the country, telling everyone that Daein is free and a great place, full of loving people that take care of each other (unless you're a filthy sub-human, but no need for her to know about that).  It's all of this plus her status of being a soul jar for a goddess that prevents her from receiving any kind of retribution, as she pretty much coerces Sanaki into letting Daein completely off the hook at the end of the game. So no, I don't think Micaiah is a mary sue at all, but she's just a terrible, terrible character. One that got screwed over by how badly written RD was."
fireemblem,3dym8o,SolHiryu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:02:23 2015 UTC,"All characters adore her regardless of what she does  Everyone? At the begining it makes sense for her to be adorered, she became a symbol of hope in Daein, a thing that escalated once she was put in charge of Pellea's group, a comander of noble heart and one that risks her life in the heat of battle, that is a quality to be admired and something that many Lords in the franchise have.  Now on the subject of the Beorc and Laguz war... Even thought no one deserted from the army and remained by choice, there is always people questioning Micaiah's decisions, with the exception of generic soldiers which don't really hold much plot relevance and already hate the Laguz Alliance to begin with.  Micaiah goes from being a savior to a figure to characters the game threats it as such, the game does not sugarcoat her actions. In the end all was explained with the Blood Pact which does put them into a thight spot, but in no way the game portray or excuses Micaiah's actions as a story with a Mary Sue would, you are free to decide wheter her actions are good or bad or if she did the right thing by going with it instead of looking for a plan C, there is no definitive answer in that regard.   You make some pretty valid points, but this has always been my problem with Micaiah. Yes she does have flaws, but in the end. no one is blaming her for them and she never gets called out on it....ever. Even her failure as a general the game attributes to Pelleas's....well to be blunt, his naivete, not hers. And her actual failings, close-mindedness, racism, not asking for aid for information, not using resources properly, and usurping power from someone everyone thought was the rightful king are never addressed and never solved. It's not ok to say that just because she made allies with the wolf and Rafiel that she is no longer racist against Laguz. It's not enough to say that she learns better after joining up with Ike and has become a better leader. We never see it happen. we're just expected to believe she can be a good queen as a result of just how nice she is.   Her conflict with Ike isn't ever resolved either, We never see her coming around to view him as a person and not just a figure she dislikes.  She's not quite Mary-Sue, but dear god I wished they'd fleshed out this part of RD"

fireemblem,3dzsz3,zairuen,3,Mon Jul 20 22:42:53 2015 UTC,"iirc, the RD system doesn't grant any extra growths; you're basically spending 100exp to promote. So, maximum efficiency is levelling to 20 and then using a promotion item anyway."

fireemblem,3dzsz3,BloodyBottom,3,Mon Jul 20 21:42:56 2015 UTC,"The weird thing is that removing promotion items made significantly more sense in Awakening which is heavily focused on grinding for skills and stats. You could buy all the seals you wanted without consequence, so they were pretty clearly only in the game because they had been in other games."
fireemblem,3dzsz3,Tazerz1995,2,Mon Jul 20 21:59:01 2015 UTC,"But they also removed it from Fe11 and Fe12, but I guess that kinda makes sense because they were tying to stay faithful as remakes I guess"
fireemblem,3dzsz3,Hytheter,2,Mon Jul 20 22:01:04 2015 UTC,"It seems a lot more natural than using an item too. Like the promotion is the natural progression of your advancing abilities, rather than from the intervention of a foreign object."

fireemblem,3dzsz3,Splitbolt,6,Mon Jul 20 22:15:21 2015 UTC,I would've expected weapon durability removal to cause more uproar than it actually did tbh
fireemblem,3dzsz3,zairuen,8,Mon Jul 20 22:28:05 2015 UTC,"Mm, me too. I like the change though, I do feel like keeping track of weapon durabilities detracted from my enjoyment of the games, just because I'd go full OCPD and trade for 20 minutes between every chapter, although it's a shame that rare and powerful weapons mean a lot less now."
fireemblem,3dzsz3,Splitbolt,3,Mon Jul 20 22:49:27 2015 UTC,"I like how the change is implemented, I didn't think it was necessary but I guess they did about as good of a job as they could with it.  Perhaps that's why people aren't so mad."
fireemblem,3dzsz3,MrGrotchWillis,4,Mon Jul 20 22:58:07 2015 UTC,"Also, its possible because quite a lot of people haven't played Fates yet, because they're waiting for the NA release and to see how its implemented for themselves."
fireemblem,3dzsz3,theussab,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:53:20 2015 UTC,I loved durability. Having to stock up on weapons made money useful and made killing edges or legendary weapons not ultra broken
fireemblem,3dzsz3,Pwntagonist,0,Tue Jul 21 03:52:31 2015 UTC,"I mean obviously there'll be more people complaining about the newer games than the older games. I'm just trying to say it will probably become a pattern. In another 8 years, IS will remove Pair Up and everyone will want it back because of different reasons. I'm not claiming that anything actually happened, just predicting based on certain patterns of humans. We like to support the old stuff for some reason."
fireemblem,3dzsz3,themythicalcheese,3,Mon Jul 20 22:27:11 2015 UTC,"We're not the stupid hipsters you think we are. Pairup, as its implemented in Fates, is excellent, but I do hope it doesn't become a staple. The Tellius games were balanced around level 21 promotions, and Fates pairup is well designed. While I think it should be merged farther, I can see that the progression is natural. Fundamentally changing combat=/=Slightly changing balance."
fireemblem,3dzsz3,Pwntagonist,0,Mon Jul 20 22:41:15 2015 UTC,"I was mainly talking about Awakening pair up, there's probably a better example since that has been fixed in Fates."
fireemblem,3dzsz3,Tazerz1995,2,Mon Jul 20 22:53:57 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't see any downside whatsoever to level 21 promotions, so I can't really see where people could say it sucks.  Pair-up on the other hand has a bunch of things wrong with it that there's no point in discussing it now because its been said far too many times on this sub already"
fireemblem,3dzsz3,Pwntagonist,2,Mon Jul 20 21:58:12 2015 UTC,"I don't really want to argue, I'm just addressing an inherent problem with human nature. Either way, if there were any complaints about lv 21 promotions it would prolly sound like ""Lv 21 promotions are OP because you can have a promoted unit within the first 5 chapters! It completely ruins the balance!"" Obviously that looks irrational now but it's probably been said on some obscure message board somewhere,"
fireemblem,3dzsz3,Tazerz1995,3,Mon Jul 20 22:00:46 2015 UTC,Fair enough

An Axereaver is a lance that's good against axes, and a Swordreaver is an axe that's good against swords. Awakening had Superior weapons instead--swords that are good against swords, axes that are good against axes, etc--but since your sword units will always be better than enemy sword units, your axe units always better than enemy axe units, etc. and the Superior weapons are only 10 uses, they're not very useful."

I just need a decent pose reference to work off. Lance users with their thrusts would probably make a decent punching animation, or I could just use Street Fighter sprites.  I'm actually more concerned with getting the sound effects, since Fire Emblem obviously has no gunshot sounds I can use. That probably means ripping the sound from a different game and importing it."

fireemblem,3dw7qa,averysillyman,5,Mon Jul 20 01:51:20 2015 UTC,I say it's down to what you feel like that day. Heros are more reliable but those caps man...  here here
fireemblem,3dw7qa,SilentMasterOfWinds,5,Mon Jul 20 02:13:27 2015 UTC,"Caps doesn't matter in almost every game. They matter in RD (where Heroes don't exist) and in FE12, where Heroes are really bad late game, but still a solid mid-game class. Low caps aren't preventing Raven, Gerik, Harken, Dieck, OJ and Ekhidna from fucking things up.  Also, the few characters that can go either Warrior or Hero, are almost always better as a Hero because the promo gains from Hero are better than Warrior most of time."
fireemblem,3dw7qa,punk_emblem,6,Mon Jul 20 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"They matter in RD (where Heroes don't exist)   I mean, technically Ike's class is Hero. :p"

fireemblem,3dw7qa,alex6309,18,Mon Jul 20 01:27:27 2015 UTC,But use the original Nomadic Trooper over SS's Ranger. Really don't like the new animations. Give me the tackling horse and ridiculous jumps.
fireemblem,3dw7qa,korean_salamander,5,Mon Jul 20 01:36:43 2015 UTC,"It'd be kinda weird in the context or Elibe though. Nomads and Sword masters are Sacea exclusive classes (except for Lloyd who specifically has a differently designed sprite from the rest to distinguish himself from other, Sacean Sword masters. Rangers were made to aesthetically distance themselves from the nomads while still being similar as a class."
fireemblem,3dw7qa,korean_salamander,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:43:41 2015 UTC,"I agree. Rangers don't seem to have the lore connection in Magvel that Nomads had in Elibe, which is why I don't particularly like their presence and typically don't promote units into them in SS.  Despite that, the sprites here in the sprite sheet use SS's Ranger sprites over the Nomadic Trooper."
fireemblem,3dw7qa,Beddict,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:46:52 2015 UTC,I'm saying that it'd be weird for non-Sacean characters to suddenly turn into a Sacean class. Ranger being here is fine in my opinion.

fireemblem,3dw7qa,SilentMasterOfWinds,8,Mon Jul 20 04:07:03 2015 UTC,"In FE7 and FE6, paladins had full weapon triangle control. FE8 removed axes and added great knights."
fireemblem,3dw7qa,SilentMasterOfWinds,5,Mon Jul 20 04:08:55 2015 UTC,Which still bugs me to no end. WHY IS IT THAT THE MORE SPECIALIZED CLASS WITH AN EXTRA TRAIT IS THE ONE THAT ALSO GETS THE FULL WEAPON TRIANGLE INSTEAD OF MAKING IT A CHANCE BETWEEN DEFENSIVE TANK AND WEAPON TRIANGLE MASTERY?
fireemblem,3dw7qa,The_Magus_199,9,Mon Jul 20 05:34:40 2015 UTC,Because having full triangle mastery PLUS 8 move would make Paladins even more broken than they already were.
fireemblem,3dw7qa,huytin,2,Mon Jul 20 05:45:36 2015 UTC,ITT: Intelligent Systems actually has no idea how to properly balance.  Hence FE13.

fireemblem,3dw7qa,Mekkkah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:31:20 2015 UTC,"Most of the Paladins never hit their Defense cap, and their Defense promotion bonus is the same as Great Knights, so the choice would be even more lopsided than it already is if Paladins got full WTC."

fireemblem,3dw7qa,jfar538,2,Mon Jul 20 09:18:51 2015 UTC,"Great Knights actually have far better combat in general. The promotion bonuses, caps, and axe access ensure that.  Paladins only actually have one cap that's higher than the GK equivalent, and that's skill."
fireemblem,3dw7qa,Hederbomb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:06:41 2015 UTC,"They should have given Paladin a skill in 8 to offset that, like give them a chance to heal off a hit or something.

fireemblem,3dw7qa,rattatatouille,2,Mon Jul 20 04:11:11 2015 UTC,Hero Dorcas? Yes pls.
fireemblem,3dw7qa,derangerd,3,Mon Jul 20 07:39:04 2015 UTC,"Matthew wouldn't really gain or lose anything from this. His promotion is just too late. There's actually not much left to steal when he can so I guess it saves him an inventory slot when lockpicking. Yay! Same for Legault.  Dorcas would have +2 speed upon promotion rather than 0. To give you an idea of how bad Dorcas is, he still wouldn't reach 14 AS until 20/14.  FE8 Summoner is infinitely superior to FE7 Druid for Canas. I'd take the option anyday.  In the same way but reversed, FE8 Great Knight is just FE7 Paladin with less movement. If Lowen had to choose between FE8 classes he should just go with Paladin still. Just 'cause you're a slow unit doesn't mean you should also lower your movement.  Mage Knight Erk is awesome.  Raven would really miss axes if he went with Ranger, but mount...this was always a hard choice to make with Gerik.  Dart would just keep the high crit I guess since he has no use for E bows. Not that it's very relevant since he 2HKOs everything with an Iron Axe.  Rebecca still sucks but at least she can suck on a horse now.  Wallace and Oswin get +1 movement and swords, big woop. I don't think this really improves Oswin all that much later in the game (which is when he's got problems).  Wyvern Knight Heath is pretty cool, I think it gets some extra speed upon promotion. Pierce isn't very reliabe but E swords is useless so I'll take anything over that.  Florina definitely appreciates extra constitution as a Wyvern Knight but it's gonna stop her from carrying some heavyweights like Hector."
fireemblem,3dw7qa,aquaoi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:38:15 2015 UTC,"Ranger Rebecca would actually have an enemy phase. In my opinion, thats a major improvement."

fireemblem,3dzyvp,Okkefac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:53:22 2015 UTC,"RIP Kieran. You tried, you really did ; ;. Such a massive loss though, I'm sorry, best Knight.   Match 9 Titania - A kickass paladin who is just really awesome. One of my really liked characters, she kicks butt and just has a really nice personality. She isn't annoying or anything, I've seen nothing I dislike from her. Pent is cool and all and I do really like Pent, but Titania just stands out in particular as a character I like.   Match 10 Lute - No 100% Tellius round this time. I really like Lute, again one of my really liked characters like Titania, both Lute and Titania are some of my favourite females in the series. Lute's personality is just so different from the norm, it's really interesting and I like it. Her support with Artur in particular is rather adorable, also she's a great unit which helps. I've never cared for Lethe much at all, really.   Match 11 Jill - This one was really difficult to choose. It's essentially backstory vs development. I prefer Knoll's backstory and really like him, but that's about it? Yet if you just thinking about how much Jill has grown as a character over the course of the two Tellius games, it's almost like she's a completely new person. In this case, development won for me. Jill being a badass dragonlord helps a lot though, I admit.   Match 12 Zihark - Toughest choice of the lot so far, this is my third time starting to write out a reason because I kept changing it. Eliwood is good and all but he's so...average? I like some aspects of him but to me he is almost a perfect example of a character who I like, but am completely neutral to. Whereas Zihark I like the backstory with a laguz, and find that really intriguing, that's most of the reason why he beat Eliwood, as he has something going for him."

In the end, I'm going to give it to Titania in order to get another full Tellius day. (I know, best reason ever, right?)  10: While one could say that Lute is quite simply superior, I'm not going with her this time around. I love the Laguz and Lethe is great and shows some development throughout both games. She starts out hating the humans, but in the end learns to respect the Beorc.  11: Easiest one of the day. Jill is one of Tellius' best characters and her character development just blows Knoll out of the water.  12: Zihark's backstory and internal conflict in RD mean more to me than Eliwood being a rather bland lord. His character gets overshadowed by both other lords in his own game."

I usually use him as a bulky mercenary/hero when I use him, but if he joined instead of Roger, it would have made my day.  FE6 : Hugh - I love his design which is very different from the typical mage in the series. However his recruitment price, his late join time and his low bases/growths make him very hard to use.  FE7 : Farina - I used her twice and she rocked both times, but with the HM only and her late join time, it's very hard to do.  FE8 : Ewan - With the ruins, he is salvageable, but not quite worth it at this point.  FE9 : Lucia - I love her character design, but god... that join time... and her bases. ARGH!  FE10 : Lucia - She is teased in Part 2, I thought she'd have it better this time.... but no. She disappears again too.  FE12 : Samto - Overshadowed by anyone else. I still really like his design though.    FE13 : Tiki - She is cool, but she doesn't bring anything else to the table. Same class as Nowi, except without a child and no other marriage possibility. I was let down when I saw her arrive for nothing. In most playthroughs I don't even recruit her since her paralogue is a pain and I never use her."

If Ewan came around the same time as Ross, he'd be a pretty decent unit, as I could stick him behind seth and have him just attack units with no range. However, he comes in so late and underleveled that its just not worth it to level him up.

Good changes, although I'd like to see FE15 nerf pair up a little further. But I'm really not a fan of these individual character bonuses. Introduces a lot of complexity without adding depth. Keeping a table handy to keep track of which characters add what stats at a given support level (which will matter on Lunatic) sounds tedious. Awakening's bonuses were easier to calculate."

It requires either more planning or more time in order to get the best bonuses from each potential pairing.   For less complexity, maybe instead of being character-based, the bonuses are class-based?

fireemblem,3e04vb,bLessEnd,5,Mon Jul 20 23:43:44 2015 UTC,"Stuff I wish I didn't mess up when I started hoshido:  • Pick a Nohr exclusive class for your secondary class (dark mage maybe?)  • Temporary boost items and permanent stat items look exactly the same, be careful.   • After every battle (even mycastle/worldmap randoms) usually another worldmap random will appear. Your access to XP is enough to highly level tons of characters at once.   • Children characters are pretty cool, they're all pretty good. Don't listen to naysayers if you want to use a couple.   • Read The chapter summaries on serens or watch The Full Subtitled Videos before doing each chapter. It helps you understand what's happening at that moment. Better than doing it after  • Use THIS link to look up support conversations for anyone. Trust me. I've scoured. THis is the one you want."

It's perfectly scene-setting for an endgame chapter, with the last appearance of the Grado Remnant and human enemies in general, in a dark fog of war filled with multitudes of enemy promotes. Throw in 6 chests on different sides of the map, a secret shop, a split deployment, shitty allies to defend for a reward, a notable defend objective (not a throne), enemies from 3 different directions, multiple chokepoints (for you and the enemies) and a fairly strong boss you quite dislike. It makes for one heck of a way to start the very end of the game, and one of my favorite chapters in the series."

fireemblem,3e0cis,Pwntagonist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:17:34 2015 UTC,"I feel bad that I dislike this chapter just because of the amount of units we have at this point. There are 3 doors and you have 4 melee units. You have to send Ike to the left for Ilyana and there are some lance knights to the right, so you send Boyd or Titania. So Oscar goes down.  It's cool that everyone gets a role, but the fact that you can't change how you play this chapter makes me cringe."

And Forseti's power (and the inherent speedyness of holy blood) can also carry me through until I get some of the casting specifics mastered.  Beyond that, well, I think that I can handle most things pretty well. I'm fairly well spoken, I can lead groups, I've got experience skulking about and evading people who want to come stab me (at college we took our Assassins Guild very seriously, and I was one of the best), and I think that, when push comes to shove, I can summon up the necessary fortitude for the job.

If I do run a risk of dying, well, I always say I'd be a shaman if I were a fire emblem character, so I'd probably join as a level 1 shaman. I could kinda sorta be decent if trained. Maybe I ask the tactician nicely for those Afa's drops. Alternatively they wouldn't turn out to need me and I'd be benched from join-time and I could breathe a sigh of relief.

I really don't wanna tip the scales of fate, so I'll make sure to get together with Tiltlyu (should be easy with the Childhood friend card) then leg it as soon as chapter 5 is about to close with some excuse about a bad premonition.

His slightly better stats are irrelevant in PoR, she has stronger availability, and supports with characters people are more likely to use.

fireemblem,3dzxxy,Sabertwooth,2,Mon Jul 20 22:20:37 2015 UTC,Excuse you. Wolt isn't even Rebecca's real child. Why should Roy marry some imposter instead of his fathers protector? RoyxMarcus = OTP

Wolt will be remembered as that shitty starter archer, but at least he was a shitty archer who did something for his brother's life, while Marcus was being all "" I'm old and know a lot of shit about war.

fireemblem,3dztq9,Eastern-Eagle,3,Mon Jul 20 23:27:41 2015 UTC,"Those stats can be reached by everyone else pretty easily. They don't make up for how he starts off worse than everyone else, reaches them later than everyone else, and how he's not in as good a class as everyone else.  Rolf is surprisingly a really cool character, but he's very easily bottom three material."
fireemblem,3dztq9,SilentMasterOfWinds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:56:14 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, eagle; what is it you like about Rolf's character?"
fireemblem,3dztq9,Eastern-Eagle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:17:41 2015 UTC,"To be entirely honest, for the longest while I didn't really care about him one way or the other. I never really bothered using him and he went more or less ignored. A while back, I saw someone's post about him (in fact, it may have been by you) and read through his supports to get a better grasp of his character. There's a lot more to him than you'd think at first glance, he can be pretty badass for how young he is, his support with Mist being one of the more noteworthy.  It is a shame that he's so bad after that, because he's one of the characters that took me a bit by surprise by how much he grew on me."
fireemblem,3dztq9,SilentMasterOfWinds,2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:50 2015 UTC,"It may well have been me. I often defend Rolf and/or song his praises.  Anyways, thanks for the answer."
fireemblem,3dztq9,alex6309,2,Tue Jul 21 01:04:21 2015 UTC,"Just because he has good stats doesn't mean other characters don't outclass him or that other people got shitty Rolfs. That aside, keep using Rolf or whoever you want and don't be discouraged for your character choice! In all my FE6 playthroughs, I have used Wolt who is known to be mediocre."

A lot of those posters have been using the same flair so long that their personality has kinda over-written whatever personality the character originally had in game. The only downside is when someone I don't associate with those personalities uses the flair and posts something that seems out of character. Very jarring since I have a habit of ignoring the username and seeing only the flair. Makes me do a complete double-take."

fireemblem,3dwfjt,DeoGame,23,Mon Jul 20 02:32:41 2015 UTC,"This is actually a tough question for me.  Initially, I want to put Strategy. I really do, I like the challenges and making my brain stop and think.  But then I remember that when somebody asks what's my favorite part of Fire Emblem, I usually say it's for the characters and/or the story. They're why I don't play Civ or RTS' at all.   So I ended up putting Role-Playing."
fireemblem,3dwfjt,GoldenMapleLeaf,17,Mon Jul 20 02:40:07 2015 UTC,I like how the strategic elements blend with RPG elements.
fireemblem,3dwfjt,Rainbowdash40,5,Mon Jul 20 03:22:38 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time answering the question as well. I really do enjoy strategy, but I play Fire Emblem more than other games because of the ability to learn more about the characters through the RPG elements. In the end it's mostly about strategy for me, but I wouldn't  have played FE7 as many times as I have without the supports and the stories that each main character has."
fireemblem,3dwfjt,codefreak8,4,Mon Jul 20 03:23:52 2015 UTC,"That last bit is why I voted it RPG, actually. I wouldn't have played it, or be here on this forum."
fireemblem,3dwfjt,GoldenMapleLeaf,2,Mon Jul 20 03:27:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm kind of in the same boat - but I still voted strategy because currently the series seems to be weighting too heavily on the RPG side."
fireemblem,3dwfjt,The_Magus_199,2,Mon Jul 20 05:16:22 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way. Fire Emblem is like pizza for me: there's not one single element that makes it stand out, it's the mixture of everything that is so great."
fireemblem,3dwfjt,LakerBlue,4,Mon Jul 20 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"They're why I don't play Civ or RTS' at all.   RTS games have little in common with FE. They are much more like Advance Wars than FE.  The strategy in Fire Emblem revolves around the trio of permadeath, recruitment, and level ups. If you Zerg rush in FE, you cost exp hurting later missions. If you turtle, you cost villages/chests/recruitment which also hurts later missions. That's the strategy aspect of FE. In RTS games, if you Zerg rush on one map, it'll have no substantial consequence on the next map.  I mean, if we removed the strategy from FE, we'd have a traditional JPRG with no dynamic recruitment, no permadeath, probably more class swapping and items, and a bit more of a free world.   For me I'm a bit torn. I played FE7/8 to death, getting 100% supports, so that puts me on the side of RPG. Conversely, I played Shadow Dragon online for 4000+ battles, putting me on the strategy side of the fence.  I voted strategy. To be honest a 'Fire Emblem without RPG' sounds a lot like Shadow Dragon, no supports, most units with 1 or 2 lines of text (replaceable with no-face units even). Which, although bad for an FE game, is still playable. But what would 'FE without strategy' be? Would it be one long cut-scene? Would it be the Link Arena on an expansive world map?  Since I couldn't imagine a FE without strategy, I voted that to be the more important factor."
fireemblem,3dwfjt,sylvanelite,10,Mon Jul 20 07:15:03 2015 UTC,"I put Role Playing down, cause I've found that for me personally that it doesn't matter if the game is a technical masterpiece with the greatest level, map, and strategy composition ever.  If the story and the characters don't hold my attention or imagination then I find the game dull and just won't finish it."
fireemblem,3dwfjt,repete17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:12:33 2015 UTC,On the other hand if it's all characters/story with no intuitive level design it's even worse. Which is why I put strategy.

I will slog through shitty levels and mechanics if the story and characters are good, but I won't bother playing a well designed game if the characters or story aren't interesting."
fireemblem,3dwfjt,repete17,9,Mon Jul 20 14:03:39 2015 UTC,"I value each separately, though at the end of the day I play Fire Emblem games for the strategy.

fireemblem,3dwfjt,rattatatouille,4,Mon Jul 20 02:44:11 2015 UTC,"Roleplaying actually. Fire Emblem has pretty good tactics, but frankly put, there are better games for strategy and tactics, like Vantage Master.  The ability to farm and the luck based element foul up the strategy/tactics element, or render it less pure."
fireemblem,3dwfjt,CursedNobleman,4,Mon Jul 20 03:20:02 2015 UTC,"I need a ""both"" option!  The reason I play a Fire Emblem game is because of the characters, their story and their interactions. The perma-death is important because I care about them. RPG.  The reason I keep playing the game even after reaching the end is because the battles are fun. I love RPGs, but in most cases I find the gameplay boring. Not with FE. Strategy."
fireemblem,3dwfjt,Misticsan,3,Mon Jul 20 12:49:54 2015 UTC,"Strategy for sure, there's not very much SRPG's left that put more emphasis on the ""S"" part of the genre. The RPG elements can complement the strategy part as long as there is no grinding, by using your limited experience, money, and stat boosters to reach certain benchmarks that make certain strategies possible."
fireemblem,3dwfjt,ShroudedInMyth,2,Mon Jul 20 04:42:22 2015 UTC,"Excluding a balance of the two, when it comes down to it, which element do you value more, even slightly. Personally, I value Strategy over Role-Playing, but that's just me."
fireemblem,3dwfjt,BloodyBottom,2,Mon Jul 20 02:33:31 2015 UTC,"The strategic elements are significantly more important to me. The character raising elements are fun, but when they become the focus it degenerates into smashing balls of stats against each other. That's not to say it has to work that way, but that's how it works in the great majority or SRPGs that emphasize stat building, grinding for skills, etc."
fireemblem,3dwfjt,GoGoSpaceMan,3,Mon Jul 20 02:47:24 2015 UTC,"I mostly play the game BECAUSE it's a tactics/strategy game, yet I find myself enjoying the role of being a tactician more than employing said tactics.  And all of the characters and settings are interesting."

Amelia does well in literally any of her classes (but General Amelia is best Amelia, deal w/it). And then, I always try to bring L'Arachel along. She's just an amazing character, and I can't help but want to use her, and she has always maxed speed, luck, magic, skill, and resistance for me. Always.   Funnily enough, every time I've used Sophia from FE 6, she's always turned out well for me. Everyone else must just be unlucky or something, because she always turns out well for me."
fireemblem,3dwk1z,HowEE456,3,Mon Jul 20 03:21:57 2015 UTC,"The thing for Sophia is not only that her stats are bad. The problem is that she arrives late with a low level and there is absolutely no reason you should user her over Ray or Niime.  It is the same reasoning why we call Nino bad. Her stats doesn't matter, what matters is that there is no reason why we should user her over Pent or Erk."
fireemblem,3dwk1z,RedWolke,2,Mon Jul 20 04:00:31 2015 UTC,"""there is absolutely no reason you should user her over Ray or Niime.""  She's way cuter than either of them. :V And like I said, she's always turned out good for me, even if I had to baby her a bit to get there. Inb4 ""Ray and Niime need no babying"". Still doesn't stop me from liking her as a character, and using her still.   Erk blows. Pent is cooler and much better. I'd even rate Nino higher than Erk. Sure her availability is much worse, but she's probably one of the best in the ""Est"" archetype."
fireemblem,3dwk1z,HowEE456,3,Mon Jul 20 04:08:58 2015 UTC,"I understand that you like her and all that. I am just putting why people say that Sophia is bad, and not because we are unlucky or things like that.  I don't care if you want to use 10 Donnels, I just like that people understand the reasons why the others call those units ""bad"".  And no. Nino is really bad. Good Ests are the likes of Elincia and Zeiss. Nino, Ewan, Sophia and the likes are bad because they don't offer anything aside from damage (as their Staff ranks start at E AFTER they are promoted, so it will take a while for them to use the better staves like Psych), and anyone else can bring damage to a fight while having better availability.  I also like to use those ""shitty"" units on occasion because I like them as characters and all, but they are bad."
fireemblem,3dwk1z,Lhyon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:13:25 2015 UTC,"Bad isn't really a good word to use to describe them I think. If you enjoy using them, then they can't be ""bad"" especially if you are successful. I've seen why people don't like Sophia, maybe everyone isn't unlucky, but I am just always lucky with her instead. Donnel is annoying. He's also not an Est. Ests are basically opposite Jeigans - Low level late game units with weak bases but fantastic growths. And I wouldn't consider Elincia or Ewan Ests either. If you are trying to do LTC runs, or 0% growths then obviously the weaker unit is going to be worse. It takes dedication to make them good, and I like the feeling of successfully training a weak character into a dominating war machine. But, it really all boils down to how each person enjoys the game, really."
fireemblem,3dwk1z,HowEE456,4,Mon Jul 20 04:21:44 2015 UTC,"The problem is that rating FE characters just on personal opinion, and not any sort of objective rubric or general assumptions of play, winds up being just an exercise in futility. It's something that I think many FE fans have seen time and time again - you don't actually gain any particular gameplay insight when you don't impose some sort of implicit or explicit standards for character rankings.  I think that most people here would agree that, objectively, when you factor in base stats and availability and other things you could do with that EXP and so on and so forth, that Nino (as well as most units in the Est archetype) is a bad unit. Those constrains generally tend to be implicit around here, rather than stated outright, but they're certainly on our minds. This does not mean that they aren't fun units to use. This does not mean that they can't deliver good combat performance under the right circumstances. This does not mean that there is necessarily anything wrong with using them, though it does mean that if you want to use them you might have a harder time of things if you're going for LTC or rankings or what have you. This most certainly does not mean that there is anything wrong with picking units based on personal preference and other non-mechanical concerns, and you are of course free and eminently justified to enjoy the game in whatever way you like.  All it means in this case is that, from a strict gameplay perspective, Nino is not a good character. Nothing more."
fireemblem,3dwk1z,Spammalanche,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:00:05 2015 UTC,"I get all the points that you are making, but like you said, it's really just futile because people are just going to use who they like in most cases (again, excluding the LTC or 0% growth runs where it would just be impossible). It's really just difficult to say, objectively speaking, that any character is bad, simply for the fact that stat boosters exist and therefore, any character can reach there caps. And I think character rankings are kind of bogus too, since I like to think that all characters could be useful. But I digress, I understand why people don't use units, but it frustrates me when people won't attempt to use a unit, and then pass judgement on the character like they had used them - especially since those characters can be good.   TL;DR Use who you like, enjoy the game how you want, etc, etc."
fireemblem,3dwk1z,HowEE456,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"You can enjoy the game how you like, but you can't deny that certain characters like Nino are bad units.

fireemblem,3dwk1z,Spammalanche,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:42 2015 UTC,"That's not a very good counter argument since Cheetos would keep you from starving if you had nothing else, but you do have other food, you don't solely rely on Cheetos for sustenance, and ignore the cheeseburger sitting on the same plate. Just because I like Nino doesn't mean she's the best/my favorite and I ignore everyone else, even ones that could replace her (Pent). You still use Athos at the end even though you ""already have a magic user"" because the least he can do is be a staffbot."

These are objective facts. Sure, you can use Nino, just like you can eat the cheetos, but if given the choice using Pent/eating broccoli is the better option in 100% of all hypothetical scenarios.  I should've made it more clear that I was addressing your argument  that ""it's difficult to objectively say that any character is bad"". That is a false statement. You can't just say ""all characters can be good despite the fact that using some of them in place of others will make the game that much more difficult to complete"".   Again, you can play the game however you like (hell, two of my favourite units in FE7 are Wallace and Bartre), but objectively bad units do exist."

The Nohr Route answered some of the Hoshido questions (ie:  ) but it felt just as soild as the Hoshido route.

Ninjas have this really annoying ability that lowers your stats if they touch you, damage or no. Mask of Truth enemies have counter, and various bosses would have a skill now and then. Hoshido: Late maps have a small spike, Nohr: Starts out easy and then kicks you in a matter of chapters, 3rd: About the same all the way through, the final boss was kinda a pain though I would pair certain units together for extra hit when the unit I wanted to get experience wouldn't hit hard enough to kill the enemy. Really depends on how much you've aggroed the enemy. They will always aim for your weakest link, but if they are too wounded they'll either flee from you or pair up with a healthier unit to hide. Also, If you're idle for too long, the enemy will charge straight for you. They also really like to gang up on you so you should keep some units together for safety.  3rd/Hoshido: Way too much, Nohr: Not enough"

Prime example: Gunter. Come in late in Nohr and he was able to hold his own all the way to the credits with zero problems. In the 3rd route he shows up almost immediately and he became the worst unit in the game. I benched him so fast.  Some characters were just kinda added in recruitment after talking to a specific unit on the map. IIRC, one chapter in the 3rd route has you talk to Saizo, and after chatting with him you automatically just get Orochi and Yuugiri, no questions asked.   The 3rd route does feel a bit bloated (especially if you get all the kids too), but its best to just pick out your favorites from both routes and make your dream team."

Especially asking for Nohr since there's no grinding, I don't want to accidentally plan to use too many units.   Also when you get the child units how viable are they straight away? Like, do they come at a nice level able to use or do they need some babying?   And how fast do supports generally grow in this game? Again mostly asking for Nohr as the others have grinding, I'm wondering how many marriages/A+/A rank supports I'm likely to have.   Thanks for answering so many questions for everyone!"
fireemblem,3dvmnn,biffpower3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:29:24 2015 UTC,"With Hoshido, I tried out Phoenix mode and instantly regretted it.   The other two paths Normal Casual because I wanted a bit of a challenge, but nothing to hinder my first playthroughs. I save the harder modes for future playthroughs.   Teams consist of a max 16 IIRC. You won't get the choice of that many in every battle. When I played Nohr, I had a solid 10 units that I ran with. I never used the full usable number because I just didn't have the time or resources to train them all. I did this a lot in past Fire Emblems (Shadow Dragon, New Mystery, ect) so I just did it again in Nohr. Other people are a lot better at Fire Emblem than I am and will probably find a away to make the perfect 16 man team.  Children's levels when you pick them up depend on how far you are in the story. I wait until they're level 20 when I pick them up becasue they're usually already packed with the skills I want on them and I just promote them right away and watch them go. If you get them really early, it gives you more breathing room to plan out their skill trees. Its really all up to you.  This is how I raised my supports and it worked every time. Just have the two of them on the battlefield, pair them up, and have them wreck everything. C rank - 1 Battle, B Rank - 2 Battles, A - Rank - 2 battles, S Rank - 2 Battles. For Hoshido and 3rd route, the first map is the easiest to do as all the enemies are super easy and you can just skip everything. For grinding support in Nohr, you'll have to do it in My Castle battles which can be accessed at any time with a stable wifi connection. Aim for the newbies who have just started for the quickest results.   And no problem!"

Or they'll be made to just be pair up partners who don't gain much xp in actual battle.  Would you mind explaining how getting the child units work? You say they gain levels as you progress through the game then? Do you go do a side story or something, as an option in my castle or something?   Again thanks for the advice and such, so supports seem to be fairly easy to raise. I know not much of the games so far as I'm avoiding (mostly) story spoilers, what are my castle battles on Nohr route? Is there an online database of players to go against, or something?

I really like that Genealogy is different in that by  the time you get to the last battle, you really feel like you're about to win after fighting a long battle. Other Endgame chapters always up the ante and focus on the last boss (or fake last boss like Nergal) and there's something special about how triumphant Chapter 10 feels.

For a couple of quick recent examples, Conquest Ablaze, and Fate's Skirmish are both really good. I just absolutely love them both.  For older, FE's there's Wisdom of Ages (I love the Goldoan theme put in), Powerful Foe (probably my favorite non-special boss theme). Idoun's theme (just dramatic), Enemy to Friend (obscure, but good), Fateful Encounter (a good boss theme), Thracia Boss Theme (also good), Veld's Boss Theme (though it's unfittingly good for such a poor final boss), Monstrosity (those drums!), Fates Boss A2 (those pipes at :15 are so memorable), and of course Rise to the Challenge (it's classic).  For map themes, there's Truth, Despair, and Hope, Ascent, This RD Alm Gaiden Map Theme, and Endless Battle. And that's a short list, because otherwise it'd be terribly long.  For other themes, there's Conversation 1 (holy cow it fits FE$ so well), Leidrick's Theme (quite menacing, when Leidrick really isn't), August Talks B (though A is also good), Theme of Love (which is also Thracia's unit death theme, too ), and Lilith's Theme (I just really like it-it's like Divine Dragon Girl and Theme of Love mixed into one).  Also, all of the recruitment, promotion, unit death, game over, and (of course) Main themes. They're all great, and too many to list. Not that I listed a lot already, though..."

Though, it seems that Fates has unique boss themes when you're fighting playable characters from other routes, though, so it seems like the general concept got through."

Wheeling Corby is one of my favourite FE tracks of all time. I love it! It would be second on this list if you hadn't already mentioned it c:  Eternal Bond - This track is just my absolute favourite. An amazing map theme that gives me so many memories of the amazing story going on when this is playing in the background. That and it's just great to listen to.  Dilemna - I don't even know when this plays but I adored it as soon as I heard it in RD's OST. It's just awesome sounding, really.  March Of The Lion King - So amazingly catchy. This one is just great to listen to, unfortunately since it's a battle theme it never plays for long (like Naesala's theme).   Dawn Awakens - What a perfect song to play at the perfect point during the game. It's beautiful, really love the power of it and what is actually happening as they sing together. Just gorgeous.   Now for some non Radiant Dawn? That sounds like a good idea.   Winning Road: Roy's Hope - I may only like this because it reminds me of actually doing well in FE6, but this tune is just really nice, favourite song from that game.   Everything Into The Dark - Again just really like this. Of course I really like Together We Ride, as well, but I'm sure others will say that.  I also really like Id (Purpose), and Oliver's two themes from PoR and RD, as well as FE1/FE11/FE12's recruitment theme, and Celica's map theme in FE2, but I can't spam this thread with too many songs.

fireemblem,3dsjjc,welcometomoonside,4,Sun Jul 19 10:56:51 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why a Charizard player made top 8 at Evo in PM, right? The difference isn't significant."
fireemblem,3dsjjc,Commander034,3,Sun Jul 19 12:14:03 2015 UTC,"Charizard's a bit of a weird example for both sides of the argument since his ground speed is one of the fastest in the game and his aerial speed is very poor.   But speed is definitely a huge factor since it makes it much easier to dodge, bait, chase, and move around in general. The problem with the ""Fatties"" like Charizard and others like Bowser and DK is just that - they're too fat and easy to hit. The player really needs impeccable spacing and know when to use their power moves, but it doesn't help that a good amount of those moves are also slow as well."
fireemblem,3dsjjc,acaferra,5,Sun Jul 19 13:58:17 2015 UTC,"I think Ike in PM is a good example of a heavier character that they did well. While he isn't fully comparable to a standard heavy (being kind of a semi-heavy in even the official games), he still shows how they can make a slower character work - he has good bursts of speed due to Quick Draw (and Quick Draw Cancel), and most of his moves actually come out pretty damn fast. Otherwise, though, he's rather slow, at a good weight to be combo'd, and he's still decently large in size."

fireemblem,3dsjjc,aLolipopPrince,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:12:42 2015 UTC,"My guess is that when they are saying this, they are talking about side-b solely as an approach option, timed in such a way that you get a dash right up to the opponent but not the slash itself. Even then there is awkward end lag, but less so."
fireemblem,3dsjjc,BenNegify,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:58:29 2015 UTC,The side B seems to have WAY less lag when you land with it as opposed to using it grounded.
fireemblem,3dsjjc,albino_donkey,0,Sun Jul 19 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"Lol that's ironic of you to say. Top level play knows side b is good for three things, quite punishes/tech chases, stale mates against characters under specific circumstances, and approach options, but no one who tries to approach in the neutral with it is trying to land the hit.   You're actually trying to land in front so you can attack or grab with something more useful."
fireemblem,3dsjjc,OmegaLiar,2,Sun Jul 19 16:40:39 2015 UTC,"The best chain with Ike that I can at least somewhat regularly get (ff nair -> d-tilt -> fair -> Aether) does at most 50%, so I'm not quite seeing how two jabs, an up throw, and Aether do 60%."

Roy isn't bad, but he's got problems approaching. He's best used as a wall, which sucks against anyone with a projectile."

fireemblem,3dsjjc,virtu333,3,Sun Jul 19 15:04:36 2015 UTC,"Roy is still the best out of the FE gang. Kills earlier, much better combo option, and his up B is a great out of shield option. Can kill at high percents as long as you land the first hit and the rest follows through."
fireemblem,3dsjjc,Zenith_Tempest,2,Sun Jul 19 02:24:19 2015 UTC,"Ike is the character I pick when I want to win, so I'd say he's pretty good."
fireemblem,3dsjjc,Evilgenius1337,2,Sun Jul 19 02:40:32 2015 UTC,Both Ike and Amarth are better than before. They're faster and have better combos and options. I'd say they're both mid tier.
fireemblem,3dsjjc,TheTacticianMagician,3,Sun Jul 19 01:54:20 2015 UTC,"Ike is generally considered bottom of high-tier, which is a huge step up from his previous placing. (highest of low-tier). He has a lot of potential, I think personally. He can mix up with fair, nair, bair, pivot tilts, and his punish game got a lot better thanks to buffed dash attack (previously he couldn't meaningfully punish at mid-range, now he can kill you at around 100%). Now whenever Ike grabs or gets a dtilt/nair, he can follow for a free 20%. He still gets juggled hard but decreased start up time for side-B helps somewhat.  I'm sure if more people decide to main him, he'll get better representation and fame."

fireemblem,3dsjjc,discforhire,7,Sun Jul 19 23:57:47 2015 UTC,"Better than them by a decent margin actually. Marth/Lucina suffer from zero shield pressure and no combos. Ike got a lot of improvements after the last patch, but his moves are still predictable af. Robin has good projectiles but is too sluggish in a metagame where most of the top-tiers are rushdown characters. Roy, on the other hand, is super fast, has true combos, and a ridiculously strong forward-smash."

His special item gained could be his hat, while he could have a fairy speak for him like in Hyrule Warriors (Since the Smash iteration is based on his TP model, he does have an unnamed fairy as his taunt, and a fairy is also used as a cursor in Smash) rather than him be silent like the Awakening DLC"

fireemblem,3dv4kp,leonraymond29,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:31:43 2015 UTC,"By that standard, Est herself isn't an Est because she doesn't have the highest single attack damage in the game.

fireemblem,3dv4kp,kamikorosu,2,Sun Jul 19 20:59:09 2015 UTC,"the problem is that you don't realize FE14 has two sets of Christmas Cavaliers.  The Nohr equivalent to the Christmas Knights in Nohr are the Maids (Felicia and Flora).  and not necessarily.  in FE9, you don't get the second cavalier into closer to midgame, and if you skip Lyn mode in FE7 you don't get them until midgame, not to mention FE10 which is all sorts of weird.  it wouldn't be the first time it happened."
fireemblem,3dv4kp,Kubla_Khan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:45:45 2015 UTC,The issue here is that in Nohr you don't even get the option to have 1/2 of the Christmas cavs

fireemblem,3dv4kp,HammableOfCarthage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:56:00 2015 UTC,"But that's not what the Christmas cavs are. I'm not arguing that they are bad, I'm arguing that they fit the archetype the least because if one route you literally don't have access to one. The maids aren't Christmas cavs, their color palette says otherwise and I'm pretty sure that Felicia is more magical based/balanced as opposed to specializing in skill/speed and I doubt flora specializes in str/def, which is literally the basic and recurring stat difference for Christmas cavs. A pair of units with the same class does not maketh Christmas cavs"
fireemblem,3dv4kp,Blitzcreag16,2,Mon Jul 20 14:40:45 2015 UTC,"Here are Felicia's Growths   Felicia    HP 40   STR 10  MAG 35  SKL 30  SPD 40  LCK 55  DEF 15  RES 35   Here are Flora's   Flora  HP 35   STR 40  MAG 20  SKL 45  SPD 30  LCK 35  DEF 30  RES 30   And here are Felicia's base stats   Felicia  Maid    1   HP 19   Str 5      MAG 9    SKL 10  SPD 10  LCK 12  DEF 5   RES 9   MOVE 6   and Flora's    Flora    Maid    5   HP 29   STR 18  MAG 16  SKL 25  SPD 15  LCK 11  DEF 14  RES 23  MOV 6   there is some obvious stat inflation since Flora is intended to be a mid to late game unit unlike Felicia, but it's quite evident that Flora is intended to statistically be a physical unit (Str and Def), while Felicia is intended to be the dodge tank unit (Spd, Lck).  not to mention the contrasting personalities (Flora is the serious and responsible sister, Felicia is the effusive and klutzy one).  and as for the christmas colors, Felicia has a warm palette due to her strawberry blonde hair, while Flora has a cooler light blueish hair.  rather unorthodox perhaps due to the unusual blue rather than green, but an interesting variation nonetheless."

Payoff isn't even that good either.  Doga/Draug: Arden. The typical Draug has backwards growths for an Armor Knight, having good speed and average strength and defense. Arden is just a typical Armor Knight.  Jagen: Seth. Jagens are supposed to fall off after a while. Seth takes a particularly long time to fall off because of his unreasonably high bases, if he falls off.  Ogma: Gregor. While I love the guy to death, he is not what an Ogma is supposed to be, that being a strong early to mid-game Merc. Gregor is simply average when he joins.  Navarre: All of the Navarres are fairly similar, so picking one is difficult. Probably Lon'qu due to an abnormally high strength.  Barst: Wade and Lot. Listing both of them since I don't know which one is supposed to be the Barst, but neither of them fits the bill of a Barst.  Shiida/Caeda: Fury. The Shiida is almost always an ally of the protagonist, but the fact that she starts as an enemy raises some red flags.  Merric: Linde, Lugh, Erk, and Azel. None of these even use anything that could be remotely classified as wind.  Gotoh: Basilio and Flavia. Opposite of Jagens, Gotohs are late-game crutch characters. Basilio and Flavia aren't even that great, even on Awakening's easiest difficulty, and get shredded on Lunatic and Lunatic +.  Est: Ewan. The amount of effort required to get him on par with the rest of your army isn't worth the payoff. At least the original Est could one-shot enemies upon joining."

Twin Axefighters : Dorcas and FE7!Bartre : They join early and should be viable, but they are outclassed by virtually anyone ever.  Nabarl : Lon'qu : I like Lon'qu, but he represents horribly the Nabarl. They are usually tricky to recruit due to their killing edge and pure badasses. He just doesn't feel like one. Sorry.

No buildup whatsoever and just exists to be pwned cathartically... if you even cared about what happened the last chapter.  Worst Ogma: Frankly, Gregor. He's got the good bases part down pat and his growths are better than others (looking at you Dieck) but he doesn't have the availability. He's more like Ephraim route Gerik.  Worst Draug: Arden. Mostly because FE4 isn't kind to foot units, especially Armor Knights. Most Draugs get an indoor map or two where they shine (Kellam has utility on his join map and Paralogue 1, for one) but Arden doesn't even get that.  Gotoh: Basilio and Flavia. Love them as characters but the whole children mechanic and the fact that the game heavily favors growth units makes them mediocre. FE6 Karel at least was in the best foot class in the game, Athos had staff utility and a Prf weapon good vs the final boss, and the FE9 royals could help Ike out with Ashnard while the rest of the army deals with the mooks.  Gordin: the archetype is mostly terrible, so an early game archer who doesn't suck is the exception. So basically Jamke by default."

I also wasn't aware most of the archetypes existed, so Mustafa actually surprised me and made the level really memorable for me, though thinking back I definitely see how he's a disappointment (That song thooo)  As for Ch. 11, I never really struggled with it - except in the run where I wanted to pair up Olivia with Chrom. Fuuuuuck that."

fireemblem,3dv4kp,Pwntagonist,4,Sun Jul 19 22:34:40 2015 UTC,"If you're gonna use an Est though, you are already throwing efficiency out the window, so most of the time she will just get a massive bexp dump to catch her up of someone is gonna end up actually using her, which sorta negates the ""joins too late"" thing, since after bexp she can hold her own in a fight.  But even if you don't bexp her, then she still has mounted canto staff utility, which is still much more useful than any of the other Ests can contribute if you don't invest in them either"
fireemblem,3dv4kp,KiwiDaysoonay,2,Sun Jul 19 22:54:43 2015 UTC,"We're throwing efficiency out the window but she isn't all that special in a casual run, especially when you probably have other staffbots that have been doing her job. The bexp can't fix her to the point you need it to, and that bexp dumb at that point really doesn't make her that much more special considering the little amount of time she has, with 3 chapters to be in use before endgame, where she likely isn't going to do much. Even compared to some Ests (Mostly Sara) her availability isn't too special in a casual run, and neither are her returns for resource dumping her.  Well, most of them. Not all. Sara is still a hell of a lot better. I think Nino has better opportunities for training in a casual run too."

Cain/Abel - From what I've heard Kain and Alva are pretty mediocre, at least compared to the others.  Jagen - Is there one? The point of a pure Jagen is to have bad growths and get worse over time. Or to have good growths and bad bases and just be an Oifey, is there anyone who doesn't do either?  Est - I don't count Sophia, because she never gets amazing upon levelling up, which is kind of the point. Of the ones I know of, probably Ewan as he doesn't turn out that great, admittedly I never found much love in PoR Elincia as a unit.  Ogma - Gregor, simply because most people are amazing in Awakening and what with reclassing being a thing you don't need to be the Ogma to be the early game awesome mercenary.   Bord/Cord - lol, the GBA ones are bad. It's between Wade/Lot and Dorcas/Bartre.   Navarre - Joshua and Samto never stood out as good units to be in particular, so possibly those.   Gotoh - I'm saying Basilio/Flavia simply because the Gotoh is generally used when you've messed up and you need backup units for endgame, and usually the Gotoh is so great they can deal with most enemies on their own. Whilst that makes it easier, that feels like the point of the archetype. I couldn't even throw Flavia/Basilio into battle on the chapter they join without them dying fairly easily, therefore not being the kind of late game clutch I expect from a Gotoh.  Lena - Natasha because MOULDER THE BOULDER /s  EDIT: Oh I didn't read the worst representative. In which case I'd say Cain/Abel goes to Saizou/Kaze for not being cavaliers, or it goes to again Kain/Alva for not being red/green at all. Navarre is probably Lon'qu for the reasons blindcoco said, Ike gets the award for least accurate Ogma, Boyd/Nolan win Bord/Cord for not being at all related to each other (don't mean related by blood here), the others stay the same."

fireemblem,3dv4kp,Statue_left,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:08:03 2015 UTC,"Ests are supposed to have high growths and end up better than their counterparts, at 20/20 Sophia only has 1 more magic than Raigh and only caps that stat and resistance, that is not particularly an amazing unit.   Let's compare their 20/20 stats, so this'll be Sophia/Raigh:  40/40, 29/28, 19/24, 18/22, 11/10, 11/11, 29/21.   So, aside from resistance Sophia doesn't have any particular lead against Raigh, yet he beats her by more than 1 point in both skill and speed. Their final stats are way too close for Sophia to be able to be considered an Est.   Yet if we compare Nino and Pent, Nino is very much an Est, starts off horribly low levelled like Sophia but ends up with amazing stats. So 20/20 Nino/Pent.  41/40, 25/22, 28/24, 26/23, 25/20, 12/15, 25/21.  Whereas compare Nino to Sophia, Nino caps 3 stats and has a lead against Pent in everything except defense. And all of her leads except for HP are in more than one point.  Sophia doesn't end up having anywhere near the stat gains against Raigh for me to be able to consider calling her an Est, she's simply just an underlevelled unit."
fireemblem,3dv4kp,MrXilas,2,Mon Jul 20 10:34:26 2015 UTC,Worst Gotoh is Basilio/Flavia? What about Renault? FE10 Volke isn't too great of a Gotoh either considering your other choices.

fireemblem,3dvvzm,KingsBlade,4,Mon Jul 20 00:34:50 2015 UTC,"The good:   Beginner mode: Choosing whether you want your units to die or not was, in my opinion, the best thing they could implement for a new player. While Rekka no Ken is usually considered the best one for beginners, I think this mechanic was a great addition.   Eh, Sacred stones and PoR are typically the ones I hear about being best for beginners, typically Sacred Stones.   The Avatar: As a concept, I quite liked this new mechanic of having the player contributing to the party. However, I felt that the Avatar unit was too overpowered (and let's not get started on Morgan).   It's kind of sad how things pan out with MU, he's too gamebreaking in normal-hard then he warps the game around himself in lunatic and more notably, lunatic+.   Spotpass: In my opinion, the best feature. Playing against teams from ALL the other Fire Emblem games was something really fun and nostalgic, especially when I faced the Rekka no Ken teams.   I really am surprised that it's brought up so infrequently, spotpass is a lot of fun.   The absence of a 'Lyn mode'. As it is my second game, I don't know if that was a Rekka no Ken thing, but it felt like the game started right from Chapter 1, instead of Rekka no Ken, where I felt like Lyn mode was starting to become a tedious chore after a few characters (and a disappointment when I dove into Eliwood/Hector modes)   Yeah, I like how Awakening really throws you straight into the action. There's, to my knowledge, only a ""Lyn mode"" type thing for FE7, but more than that Awakening really starts out blisteringly hard on lunatic+, and I appreciate not having to jerk off killing axe dudes with my sword dudes for 5 chapters just to get to the good part.   The Support system being more organized was also quite favourable. I only disliked the fact it spoiled ALL characters you could get.   Do the support things mention names before they show up? Huh. I thought it just had a silhouette, guess I don't really pay attention to that sort of thing anyway.   The music. Especially the Final Battle theme.   I felt really good about hearing it in smash after playing Awakening.  The bad:   The Avatar, as a character. Instead of having the player contribute to the story, their character was turned into a Mary Sue that sounded like something out of a fanfiction, especially in the final chapter.   I'm amazed that they haven't taken the visual novel approach to things, let the player actually decide what MU does.   While I loved Spotpass as a concept, it allowed for easy grinding, which is why I believe it should have been a Postgame mechanic.   Grinding's existed as a crutch for bad players in basically every installation of FE.   Pair Up was absolutely broken.   Meh. That's just lower modes being easy, honestly. It isn't that pair up is blisteringly OP as much as it is that the game favours you in 50 ways from Sunday in normal/hard.   ""Together We Will Ride"" not being the background music for recruiting 'enemies' like Gaius, Henry and Nowi.   That is pretty tragic.   Reclassing. It completely destroys the core of Fire Emblem. The only exception is the Avatar, but even so, they should have only been allowed to reclass once.   The core of Fire Emblem in my mind has always been grid based, turn based combat.   I like reclassing, it gives the player more power over how their units progress, add replayability, etc. Kellam as a thief is just so priceless. I love it.   The happy ending for all characters. I liked the fact that in Rekka no Ken some characters didn't have exactly happy endings, especially when it was a confirmation of their postmortem status due to the previous game. In this one, it felt too idealistic and perfect.   . . . FE13 spoilers and I mean I'm not one to pay attention to the story and whatnot, so there's probably more. But maybe there's a lot less than other games, dunno. Again, not a story person really.   Side chapters all up until recruiting Anna (who I sadly couldn't have married to my Avatar because Morgan wouldn't have existed) should have been the ones available in the game. I instantly realized Donnel was going to be the Magikarp-like unit (and I loved raising him, I did something like that Youtube guy did with a Nino-solo run in Rekka, fun times). Which leads me to...   Pretty sure you still get Morgan even if you marry Anna to MU. Can't say I've actually done it but eh.   The fucking children. It would have been much better to have all of them as post-game content. That would have allowed for a good multiplayer system where we could all train them and breed them like Pokémon to face our friends.   I don't think they'd want to make so many characters into post game content. That'd feel so shitty.  It'd also be pretty rough on lunatic+ to not have a couple of kids.   On top of that it just completely warps the plot beyond belief.   Skills. They were useful in many situations and I liked their activation effect sound, but they were also kinda broken. Then I realized I wasn't 'raising' my units well when I consulted a guide and that I could have been truly broken.   You say they're ""kinda broken"" but again you need to remember that the game isn't balanced on normal, they're not ""kinda broken"", everything is ""kinda broken"" on lower modes. That's the point of them, really.    I hope this was worth the read.   Yup. I desperately need something to occupy myself right now. It's hot outside, I feel like I'm stuck in my house because I might just melt if I go outside. I'm melting inside already. Such an exhausting day.   I enjoyed Awakening and it was worth the purchase - I can't wait to start another run, in a harder mode with everything planned (I think I'll just jump straight to Lunatic, I love challenges). Can't wait for Fates!   I'd enjoy hearing your thoughts on lunatic once you're done, and hopefully eventually lunatic+."

Not major spoilers, but you should do those maps when you get the chance, if you haven't.  Lunatic is quite the leap in difficulty coming from Normal and even Hard, but I do recommend you try it someday. It demands a certain precision that's lacking in Normal/Hard, but that's what makes it more rewarding to clear if you ask me. There are still some major win buttons present (notably Avatar), though, so it shouldn't be too off-putting provided you look up guides when you get stuck."

The last two really suck though.    I mean, it's not technically bad, but it's just kind of a bummer...that's not the end I wanted for her, away from her family and home. The SpotPass characters are weird in general though.  Edit: Forgot to mention Panne's ending above. Hers is vague as well. It could be good or bad depending on your interpretation of what really happened, but I think it's unlikely she found surviving Taguel, given the big deal the story makes about their extinction.

I mean, I get that FE7 had to die because they were gone by the time of FE6, but dammit, I really liked them, and the ending credits just go and kill them to happy music. Not cool, end credits.  I liked Awakening's (perhaps unrealistic) happy endings for most!

fireemblem,3dx8oa,AngryCthulhu,0,Mon Jul 20 17:24:52 2015 UTC,"""Continue the story"" is a bit much. The continuity between FE7 to FE6 is pretty weak, actually (considering FE6 released before FE7, obviously) so it's not like people are going to be namedropping FE7 characters everywhere. IS would have to be clairvoyant in order to know what they were about to make after FE6 to have that level of reference. It (rightfully) feels like IS made FE6 first and then took open ends from the supports in FE6 to make FE7.  To be honest, of the 3 GBA games, I enjoyed FE7 the least, so I don't think you can go wrong.   FE6 is arguably less polished, but I think the difficulty level is just about right (FE7 felt like cakewalk most of the time to me), save for some minor balance issues in the endgame which lets you get 100+ crit rates. It can be replayable, but frustratingly so, mostly because if you replay it, it's probably because you didn't know of the chapter requirements for all of the gaiden chapters.  FE8 has a slightly meandering story in the beginning and it really is cakewalk (even hard mode isn't that challenging, IMO). But of the three, it's the most mechanically advanced and probably the most re-playable. It has the least amount of characters, but the most amount of freedom for those characters. World Map and post-game mean you will have fun with it long after the story is finished.  If you must have an opinion from me: FE6 first, then FE8 and go into postgame after that."

fireemblem,3dvumv,zairuen,8,Sun Jul 19 23:26:29 2015 UTC,"Not sure about 1-5, 9-12 really. But I'd probably say 13->8->7->6 this gives you a steady progression upwards in difficulty playing on their lower difficulties.  I hear POR is piss easy so maybe put that after or before 8.  Then I figure Radiant Dawn is more forgiving than Thracia is, we all know how woeful Thracia is when you go in blind just from second hand information.  So . . .   13->8->9->7->6->10, perhaps?  But then maybe we shouldn't break 9 and 10 up, regardless of if FE10 is more difficult than 6 (which I don't even know for sure).  13->8->9->10->7->6  Then probably would want FE4/5 after that, but relative to 1-3/11/12 I'm not sure."
fireemblem,3dvumv,HashTagDeeperino,10,Sun Jul 19 23:33:51 2015 UTC,"Playing FE13 first doesn't make sense to me. You miss out on all the references and shout-outs they jammed in there just to take advantage of a slightly lower difficulty floor. Also, the forced tutorial in FE7 is pretty brutal if you already know what you're doing."
fireemblem,3dvumv,BloodyBottom,4,Mon Jul 20 00:40:19 2015 UTC,Radiant Dawn's difficulty isn't all that great. I'd say it's more than reasonable to go straight from 9 into 10.
fireemblem,3dvumv,Suichimo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:14:54 2015 UTC,"Radiant Dawn's difficulty isn't all that great.   I agree completely. Now I know hard mode is difficult (but is also just frustrating such as no movement showings and no weapon triangle) but I don't find normal or easy difficult really. Maybe it's 'cause I'm so familiar with the game because I love is that much but it really feels like RD's difficulty is overstated sometimes. It is just worrisome because it probably scares people off :(  EDIT: Also putting RD after FE6 seems weird, because to me FE6 seems harder than FE10 by miles. Admittedly I've never played hard mode on either game, so hm RD may make it worse, but not many newbies will go straight into fe6 or fe10 hard mode."
fireemblem,3dvumv,Okkefac,3,Mon Jul 20 01:08:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's fair to say it has the toughest normal mode of any of the recent games, especially for a new player because of how many new and deep mechanics it has going on."
fireemblem,3dvumv,BloodyBottom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:18:01 2015 UTC,"Although if we're honest, it's called normal mode but was intended to be hard mode for Japan, and I definitely wouldn't call easy mode harder than FE7's normal mode (maybe I'm alone in that thinking though?). That name change is a bit annoying actually, because then people play normal mode thinking it's normal and then it ends up being harder than expected because it was supposed to be hard mode.  I guess the new mechanics may be an issue, Radiant Dawn was my first FE and I actually really struggled getting used to GBA mechanics (although FE6 was my first GBA FE...yeah), I guess it just depends on when you play them and how much you play of each, huh."
fireemblem,3dvumv,Okkefac,2,Mon Jul 20 01:31:12 2015 UTC,"I will go the opposite way and say that RD is harder than FE6. That said, mostly people don't agree with me when I say this, so I guess I may be wrong."
fireemblem,3dvumv,RedWolke,3,Mon Jul 20 02:57:16 2015 UTC,"Either way I think you're right about leaving the first 5 games for the end.

fireemblem,3dvumv,korean_salamander,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:38:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm... in    13->8->9->10->7->6   The difficulty jump from 9->10 could be pretty harsh, and then it'll tone down once they play 7. You're right when you say RD is more forgiving than Thracia, but a blind playthrough of RD could be frustrating. Particularly when/if your party is split up oddly for some sections.  For that reason, here's an example using 4, 5, and 11 from one of your orders.  13->8->9->11->7->6->10->4->5  11 isn't too hard on lower difficulties, and is relatively simple in terms of FE gameplay. Save points on the map could help newcomers as well. Tentatively putting 4 after 10 just because the way the game is structured is very different from other FEs. Not to mention you'll probably want to pick up a guide so you don't miss out on a couple of important things to make the game easier.  EDIT: Forgot 11"

fireemblem,3dvumv,RedWolke,3,Mon Jul 20 12:36:13 2015 UTC,"Well, there is no real order, just a few ""ideas"" of how you could start.  Rekka no Ken, Path of Radiance and Shadow Dragon are the beginner ones, they are simple, have nice tutorials, and have no fancy things, so it's the core FE gameplay without any weird or different mechanics. They are best to start the series.  FE12, RD, Genealogy and Binding Blade next. They are either harder games or are simply too different (like Genealogy) to stay together with the core FE ones. Thracia can be said here too, but more at the end of the road.  Sacred Stones and Awakening can be played anywhere in-between. They are mostly easy games, but by the fact that they are grind-free and with a world map, I decided to put them outside of the first group."
fireemblem,3dvumv,KingsBlade,2,Sun Jul 19 23:38:08 2015 UTC,No real order other than fe7>fe6 and fe9>fe10
fireemblem,3dvumv,Mikeataros,2,Sun Jul 19 23:49:57 2015 UTC,And at least the first five chapters of FE4 before FE5. And FE1 or Book 1 of FE3 or FE11 before Book 2 or FE12.
fireemblem,3dvumv,Whimsical_Ferret,2,Mon Jul 20 00:48:06 2015 UTC,"I'd say 8-13-9-10-7-6-4-5 and skip Shadow Dragon. Haven't played Gaiden, so I wouldn't know.  Either that or 8-7-6-13-9-10-4-5  I love Fire Emblem, but SD is not a very good game."
fireemblem,3dvumv,WillLift4Food,2,Mon Jul 20 00:01:57 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd say start with FE13. While PoR and SS are a bit easier for the most part, it's still an easy enough game for my 12 year old brother to beat it with ease. With the fact that it's newer and shinier, and has no logical game that you have to follow it with (Although I guess Fates might be that when we get it), it should go at the start.  After that, I'm not totally sure. PoR would be an easy game for them to play while setting a high bar for quality character development and the support system. More goes into what should be played next than just the difficulty of the game, so I think for the sake of continuity, RD might be the best bet, though if they seem to be struggling with the strategy, go over and complete the GBA games first, in the order 8>7>6  So I guess my list would be FE13 -> 9 -> 10? -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 and 10 could be moved after 6 if necessary. After that, I'd only ever recommend shadow dragon for the continuity into FE12, though at that point I think they're fully fledged FE fans, so they'd be ready to tackle the ancients if they want."
fireemblem,3dvumv,AppoggiAzura,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:25:32 2015 UTC,"Assuming all playthroughs are done on normal mode and blind.  FE7 is probably the best to start with by virtue of Lyn Mode.  From there I would suggest Sacred Stones for ease; then Shadow Dragon, New Mystery, and Awakening for story reasons.  PoR is done after and not before so you can go straight to RD which is one of the harder ones on normal.  Binding Blade is probably more challenging blind on normal than RD due to having more consistent difficulty. In addition, its only tangentially related to FE7 story wise so nothing much is missed out by not playing immediately after 7.  Genealogy and Thracia are then done. Genealogy is done late simply because it is actually quite hard blind, while Thracia is saved for last since it is the hardest done blind.  Never played Gaiden so can't comment."
fireemblem,3dvumv,Okkefac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:55:00 2015 UTC,"You can really play in any order I think. I would say 7>6>9>10>11>12>8>13 I've never played 12, or made it all the way through 6. But I assume being sequels story wise they should be played after for the best result plot wise.  I started with RD as my first so I really don't believe in playing games in order. I just think the tutorial in Lyn mode is the best for first time players."
fireemblem,3dvumv,halfar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:03:20 2015 UTC,"Of course this is all opinion based, but anywho, this is the order I'd suggest. (note: my order was this, 10, 13, 9, 11, 12, 6, 7, 8)   Rekka no Ken - The tutorial is brilliant for a beginner, and it can otherwise be very tiresome. It is a nice easy enough difficulty, but not too easy as to leave you unprepared (like fe8, fe9 or fe13). It's a fairly typical styled FE and so gives you a good idea as to what the series will be like in general. FE7 is also incredibly likeable so will be a good hook to get someone interested (that last point is debatable possibly, but FE7 is not a very controversial FE game in the slightest). Sacred Stones - It's a fantastic game, and since it's quite easy it seems a good idea to play it earlier. Not playing it first will help you not become too attacked to grinding your units up outside of battle, as that's not readily available in most FE games.  Shadow Dragon - To me SD feels closer in gameplay to the GBA games than the Tellius ones do, so SD being here seemed fairly fitting, however putting SD and NM after the Tellius games would also work, I think. SD is a really nice game gameplay wise, and ignoring the lacking details is really quite good. It's not too difficult so will help you ease in a bit more, and putting it early on may help people recover from the 'shock' of it. New Mystery of the Emblem - Basically it's like SD but better, but it's its sequel so it should go after really. It's got a good enough difficulty setting, we see the first MU in the form of Chris, and I think playing FE11 and FE12 before Awakening could give you a really interesting feel of recognition upon seeing FE13's Fire Emblem, something I think would seem quite cool. Path of Radiance - Now onto the Tellius games. Path of Radiance could easily come earlier on, as it's not very difficult at all, however it's also a fairly different experience. Once you've gone from the GBA style to the DS style, moving onto the brand new laguz, bexp, etc can be less shocking as you're used to the change between game styles, rather than having only done GBA. PoR could go anywhere from 1st to 5th though I'd say.  Radiant Dawn - Now we're starting to get the player used to higher difficulties. I'd argue easy mode though is just as easy (if not then easier) than all the games I've mentioned already, except for PoR. Playing RD at this point will make it one of the most unique FE games to have played, and once someone gets used to it will help with being able to tackle harder games in the future.  Awakening - Hm, it feels strange putting Awakening just after the Tellius games, and admittedly I would happily swap Awakening to be anywhere up to 2nd place (I do not think Awakening is a good start into the series, I think FE7 is a much better first FE game to choose, and so I would not put Awakening that high up). I only put Awakening this low down because again my logic was getting the player used to the different styles, and RD is a very different game to the norm, as is Awakening. Also, playing Awakening this late would be nice to see all of the references, really getting a feel for the spotpass characters and such, and the DLC, Owain's ramblings, etc. As well as seeing it as a continuation from the Akaneia games that someone who played Awakening early on may not see as much. But I definitely understand arguments for Awakening being played 2nd or 3rd, as that makes sense too. Binding Blade - I'd argue this game is harder than RD, hence why I put it so low. Maybe it's only me who struggled with FE6 but when I played it I still felt really new to the series and struggled with a lot of its aspects such as same turn reinforcements. Playing FE6 this late would be a lot less frustrating and difficult, hopefully giving the player a more fun experience. (However FE6's story feels a bit strange if you knew FE7's before hand, as things don't make too much sense). Geneology - By this point you've played FE6-13 and only have FE1-5 left, which I'd say are the ones that are best left last. Geneology is a much loved game and out of FE1-5 the one of highest priority to have a go at, hence why it's placed here. Thracia 776 - Geneology's midquel that really should be played after it as it spoils stuff even in Geneology's second half. The most difficult game in the series, it's understandable why it's left until so late to play, but it's a game definitely worth having a go at if possible. Gaiden - Personally I love this game, but many people just can't stand how dated it is. If it were better loved I would put it above Geneology as it's simply a lot easier, but Gaiden is still a good game I'd argue, and is definitely of higher priority than playing FE1 and FE3 because they have remakes. Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light - Finally FE1, simply put this is this low because plaiyng SD means you've basically played FE1. At this point you're probably playing the games to just get the full FE experience, which isn't bad.  Mystery of the Emblem - This is a remake of FE1 with an extra part added on the end. I put this after FE1 just because it does miss out on a few extras from FE1, also if you played FE3 first you may feel less obliged to want to play FE1. Again you're mostly likely to play this is you're wanting to play every game, but that's definitely not a bad thing."
fireemblem,3dvumv,Blitzcreag16,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:28:06 2015 UTC,"Sacred Stones Blazing Sword Path of Radiance Radiant Dawn Awakening Binding Blade Shadow Dragon New Mystery Genealogy Thracia 776 Gaiden   Rationale: Sacred Stones is extremely forgiving towards newer players while still being ""oldschool"" GBA style. I pick it first over Blazing Sword because you really don't need a guide for Sacred Stones, at all, whereas you'll almost certainly miss some stuff if you start with Blazing Sword. Blazing Sword is also, in some ways, an upgrade from Sacred Stones, since it has a larger and, IMO, more fleshed out cast of characters. It's a much more ""complete"" game, so you gain by going SS->BS, not lose.  In the interest of preserving the ""magic"" of the handheld titles, I also put Blazing Sword before Path of Radiance. PoR is an awfully different game from the GBA series; Laguz, player bases, and skills being the most obvious example. If you were to go from PoR to Blazing Sword, you'd find yourself suddenly in a game without transforming units, without a pre-chapter base to work from, and without character skills like Nihil or Aether, but Blazing Sword and Sacred Stones introduces the concept of skills through class skills, so it seems like the more natural progression.  After 3 games, you're pretty comfortable with the series, I'd bet, so Radiant Dawn steps it up a few notches, and is a direct sequel to PoR. I put it before Awakening, because it feels more like the natural ""conclusion"" of the GBA series, even though Sacred Stones had been released years prior. In many ways, it feels like the most polished version of FE6, the first GBA game.  By the time you've reached #5, Awakening, you've already developed a fine appreciation for the GBA series, and hopefully any notion of the older games being antiquated are lost forever from you. It's like people who started TES with Skyrim and having trouble trying out Morrowind. Morrowind is an absolute masterpiece, which is why it's important to spare you the feeling of feeling like it's a ""dated"" game. It'd take several months to fully get through SS, BS, PoR, and RD, so I suppose that's the best time for Awakening.  As soon as you've had your fill of Awakening, you'd jump into more of the ""classical"" stuff, but Genealogy is an awfully big jump. Binding Blade seems like a natural progression between ""modern"" FE games and ""old"" FE games. You pretty much have to be deep in the fandom to play this game at all, after all, since it needs an english patch and an emulator. Since you didn't start with Awakening, it'll be a lot easier to just ""slip back"" into the GBA era, and enjoy the game.  New Mystery follows Shadow Dragon because it's a sequel, and I put Shadow Dragon after Binding Blade since Shadow Dragon, admittingly, is a ""bare-bones"" kinda remake. Don't get me wrong-- it's polished very well, but I would say it has the lowest replayability out of all of the games in the series. It's the closest analogy to Portal and Portal 2 that the series has, IMO. The true joy of the games is playing them for the first time, but afterwards you've more or less ""got it"". If you're not into odd challenge runs yet, there's not really much else left.  And, of course, Genealogy. This is probably the biggest ""generational"" jump on the list; even from Genealogy to Binding Blade is a bigger move than, say, Sacred Stones to Path of Radiance, or even Radiant Dawn to Awakening. If you're at the point that you've already played everything from FE6 to FE13, you're almost certainly familiar with just what a worthwhile experience Genealogy is. You're a hardcore fan, believe it or not. You've probably played a few GBA hacks before reaching this point.  Thracia 776 is the obvious next choice, as a midquel to Genealogy. At this point, you are no longer a casual in any sense of the word. You are a grotesque monster that demands more Fire Emblem content. You have tier lists of red-haired characters and can tell us a little bit about every single archetype in the series. You're fully aware of the pitfalls and enemy reinforcements throughout the series. Honestly? If you're playing Thracia 776, you've already done several challenge runs, probably. You could write a gamefaqs FAQ by memory for Hector Hard Mode and Awakening Lunatic+ Mode. You post drafts to /r/fireemblem for your no-bexp radiant dawn hard mode run. You're only looking for a fresh challenge now, and you've decided that your first 776 run will be no-growths  By the time you've made it this far, it's already too late. You have already ascended into your planar form. You have looped from liking awakening, to hating the direction the series is moving in, and back to enjoying the game simply for the pleasure of having more fire emblem content. You have already played Fates, and Kaga is your waifu. You have read every line of every game, and take issue with any and all translation/localization discrepancies, but especially in FE6 and FE12.  You already have a defined order of FE games that you'd suggest to newcomers, along with a rambling wall of text justifying every single placement on your list. Only you are aware that this is a desperate cry for help as you face the impending doom of running out of fire emblem content and having nothing else left in your sad and miserable planular life. At some point, you've disregarded this list entirely and played FE1 and FE3, despite their remakes being clearly superior versions. You are somewhat luke-warm about playing Tear Ring Saga."
fireemblem,3dw81h,AmiiboPuff,9,Mon Jul 20 01:25:32 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm misunderstanding you, I really don't think you should need to grind on normal/casual?  At the very least I don't condone playing casual. No other fire emblem game has allowed you to turn off perma-death, and it's just not fire-emblem without that struggle to keep absolutely everyone alive.   Anyways, again you really shouldn't need to grind to keep up. Considering what you said, I'm guessing you're probably doing all the paralogues you can for the kids?  The paralogues are a lot harder than the levels they branch off of, so you'd need to grind to do well in them. Personally, I recommend just continuing the main story and you can go around and take a look at the enemy strength in the paralogues without committing to them, then do it when you think you're ready.  Of course, if you're really not having a good time with the main story, all I can suggest is that you start again (in classic!!) and play with the characters you like most and the pairings you like most."

fireemblem,3dw81h,GlassesJacketNShirt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, you could be right. I haven't played 12 yet."
fireemblem,3dw81h,zairuen,3,Mon Jul 20 18:08:13 2015 UTC,"Or the fact that on Normal/Causal, I'm really grinding just to keep up with the enemies.   Are you trying to use every unit? Try to stick to a core team of about 10-12 units."
fireemblem,3dw81h,BlueSS1,2,Mon Jul 20 01:37:34 2015 UTC,"Kinda of. There's only a few characters I don't like, so I try to rotate them between battles. But I do always use Robin/Chrom/Lucina/Morgan, so they're powerful and everyone else seem lacking or just bad."
fireemblem,3dw81h,BlueSS1,6,Mon Jul 20 01:42:58 2015 UTC,"That might be your problem. By trying to use so many units, you're spreading EXP really thin, which might be why you feel like you need to grind."
fireemblem,3dw81h,MEMgrizzlies7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"you should be focusing on using a smaller group of units. The most you can ever bring into a chapter is 15, so you don't need more than that."
fireemblem,3dw81h,codefreak8,2,Mon Jul 20 02:28:23 2015 UTC,"If you want a bit more of a challenge, either do Normal/Classic or Hard/Casual. If it's a better story you want, you could consider playing other games in the series. IMO, if this is your first playthrough, you might not want to worry about keeping every unit at a high level, and instead just use 10 or so main characters. I wouldn't even worry about unlocking and completing all the paralogues. Beat the game once, then once you know what to expect you might be better able decide what pairings to make and when to do each Paralogue, etc."
fireemblem,3dw81h,KrisNut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:46:41 2015 UTC,Play FE7 or FE9/10 it's so much more fun and more engaging IMO then Awakening. It really revitalized my love for the series.

Change is inevitable and it should happen. I liked Awakening: I didn't really like pair up or the BS of the higher difficulties, I hate the world map system, and I think some of the maps were weak. Overall I think its good outweighed its bad though. It's not my favourite FE but I did still enjoy it.  I haven't played Fates so I can't speak to it, but I have faith for now.   My feelings on the change is that if you're unhappy with it, do something about it. Don't buy the game, or make your own SRPG.

You can say : ""Vote with your wallet"" all you want, but that only works when the entire community agrees on something, and no new 'wallets' are being pulled in to compensate."

I'd say that's a decent option. It'd be difficult, for sure, but difficult =/= impossible.

Most of the time there's no incompetent level design, fanservice, retarded difficulty, or pointless tutorials and they stick to the main ""classic"" aspects of Fire Emblem. Plus, they're not that hard to learn so ""making your own SRPG"" isn't as daunting a task as people make it out to be.  I sound like a friggin salesman but it's honestly the truth and there's really no reason to complain about the new FE games when ROM Hacks exist and are readily available."

I can finally give people the weapons I want to with no worry of the breaking, slight customization to outfits is cool too, especially for Corrin.

fireemblem,3drfg0,cosinelanguage,28,Sat Jul 18 19:12:11 2015 UTC,"Having everyone being 20-somethings really cuts down on the variety of relationships characters can have with each other, too. You don't get older characters or generational differences, so outside a couple of ""younger than they look"" novelties generational aspects are overall ignored. I mean, it's harder to have the mentor and apprentice relationships with Shinon and Rolf when there isn't that much age variety, it's harder to have pseudo mother/father figures.   With Awakening you get parent/child interaction, but it's not really the same given the time travel and everything. I'm hoping the next installment has a new art style that will... well, allow for more age variety, or at least cut down with the twenty-something parade. So, bring back the beards, basically."

Sacred Stones has grinding and promotion paths, while Eliwood's game doesn't. It also has Seth. And he's Seth. It's considered easier too, if that would help make you at ease.  FE7, meanwhile, is considered a great game to start with. It has a long tutorial to help you get back into the game should you need it and will adjust you to other Fire Emblem difficulties more.

In Cherrim's and Castform's case it's a weather condition, and Meloetta's relic song does damage, but you could give the characters a non-damaging move in their human form that transforms them.  ...Assuming, of course, that transformation is even possible in the GBA engine.

fireemblem,3drjzl,Hytheter,2,Mon Jul 20 04:27:44 2015 UTC,"Starts out quite weak, and will require extensive care to get up to speed. After she evolves, she's decent enough.

fireemblem,3drjzl,Hytheter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:41:11 2015 UTC,This looks cool! I was hoping for a Fire Emblem game with Pokemon rather than the other way around
fireemblem,3drjzl,Hytheter,4,Sat Jul 18 22:03:46 2015 UTC,"Have you played Pokemon Conquest? Although it's no substitute for Fire Emblem, it is a cool grid-based strategy game with Pokemon.  It would be awesome if somebody made a FE game with Pokemon. Using Mystery Dungeon sprites, perhaps."
fireemblem,3drjzl,rattatatouille,3,Sat Jul 18 22:31:02 2015 UTC,"Pokemon Conquest was what introduced me to Fire Emblem (or strategy RPGs in general), I actually found the gameplay and plot very enjoyable. I would definitely not mind a sequel."
fireemblem,3drjzl,rattatatouille,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:12:12 2015 UTC,Your starter = main lord.  Early game bug type = Jagen.  Pseudo legendary = Est.
fireemblem,3drjzl,rattatatouille,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:47:28 2015 UTC,so true...
fireemblem,3drjzl,rattatatouille,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:36:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah Pokemon Conquest was awesome. Not as good as Fire Emblem, of course, but it was still really enjoyable."
fireemblem,3drjzl,rattatatouille,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:37:15 2015 UTC,"Have you been genderlocking (and if so, how does that affect breeding since I doubt you're rewriting the breeding code to have a 50/50 mom/dad chance)? Additionally, how does reclassing + abilities work together (do all characters learn abilities at same levels)?"
fireemblem,3drjzl,crossedsabres8,2,Sat Jul 18 22:48:43 2015 UTC,"Yep. All units have a 98.8% chance of being the appropriate gender. So that makes a 1.2% chance of being the opposite gender. Because everybody thinks Marth is a girl anyway. And when was the last time you got to breed Roy... with himself?  Under normal circumstances, only the female's child would be born. Like Awakening, if people gave birth to themselves. However, I'm playing around with the Volbeat/Illumise code to make it that when any two units breed, a basic form of either of the parents will be bred. It's still a work in progress, though.  Parallel Seals can be used to jump back and forth between either path in a double-path evolutionary line. Characters tend to learn abilities at different levels. However, each side of a double-path evolutionary line will usually learn different skills at the same level.   Assassin Joshua might learn Lethality at level 50, while Swordsmaster Joshua learns Astra at the same level. If you use a Parallel Seal at level 50, it is possible to learn both attacks. Alternately, you could just visit the Move Relearner after reclassing."
fireemblem,3drjzl,M2theC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:23:51 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting to somehow make it so that when you evolve you lose levels, although that would be a wonky code to execute."
fireemblem,3drjzl,Yvaldi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:28:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah. And if they didn't lose stats too, it would lead to infinite grinding. Considering that mechanic was disliked so much in Awakening, I'm more than happy to embrace the Parallel reclassing introduced in Fates."
fireemblem,3drjzl,lukasrygh23,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:30:34 2015 UTC,"It doesn't work like that in Pokemon. All Pokemon have a max stats that they will reach at level 100. This is why evolving early is a tradeoff, as you tend to not learn a lot of skills early on (especially if you manage to rush an evolution) but you get slightly better stats (since the cap is higher). You will always reach the cap in stats and will not exceed it iirc."
fireemblem,3drjzl,M2theC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:35:03 2015 UTC,"The cap you speak of only exists because there is no means to surpass it in Pokemon games. Believe me, if I lowered a Pokemon's level but not its stats, it could surpass the 'cap' by continually leveling up. Evolving just changes the bases, not the acquired stats or any 'cap'."
fireemblem,3drjzl,lukasrygh23,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:51:58 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought a Pokemon's stats were calculated based on it's Level and Base stats (as well as EV's, IV's). I know it's possible to hack in abnormal stats but I thought they'd correct when the level changes."
fireemblem,3drjzl,M2theC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:35:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I forgot that the game runs a checksum upon level up that would correct the stats. I would have to disable the checksum in order for i to work like I described. And considering the checksum is run in a variety of places (checking PCs, encountering Pokemon) it would be quite hard to remove."
fireemblem,3drjzl,ukulelej,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:39:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tested it out myself in Fire Red and I'm pretty sure you're wrong on that. If a Pokemon has impossible stats then it will be corrected upon level up. The stats are recalculated at each level based on a formula, they aren't ""acquired"" additively like in Fire Emblem."
fireemblem,3drjzl,THATgamer77,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:45:37 2015 UTC,"Huh. Perhaps I was mistaken, then. Thank you for correcting me."
fireemblem,3drjzl,rattatatouille,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:37:09 2015 UTC,"So, will there be breeding groups?  Or can every male breed with every female?"
fireemblem,3drjzl,ChaosDevilDragon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:59:41 2015 UTC,"Right now, every male and female are interbreedable. I eventually plan to make breeding groups that match up with supports, so characters can only breed with the people they support (and a few others)."
fireemblem,3drjzl,rattatatouille,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:38:17 2015 UTC,Those are going to be some very small breeding groups then...
fireemblem,3drjzl,josh_thomas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:28:42 2015 UTC,Will there be the magic triangle as well?

fireemblem,3dsyya,NightmarePulse,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:51:32 2015 UTC,"It's close between Noire(MUxTharja) and Owain(DonnelxLissa). Currently Noire is a Bride with Lancefaire, Bowfaire, Armsthrift (because OP forged brave weapons), Galeforce and Ignis and strangely no Limit Breaker. Must be I got bored of grinding before I got to giving her Limit Breaker. Owain is a Bow Knight solely because that's the last class he needs skills from, but I'd make him a Swordmaster for actual things after the grind with Swordfaire, Limit Breaker, Sol, Astra and Armsthrift so he can use the real Mystletainn without fear of it breaking."

fireemblem,3dsqxh,kofca,3,Sun Jul 19 02:43:49 2015 UTC,"Awakening Draft!  Chapter 8  Turn 1: Shove Gregor and Nowi in a corner. Pair Kellam and Miriel, and Robin and Chrom. This chapter is going to mainly just be the magic users. Miriel kills a fighter by the village. Robin kills a fighter on the opposite side. Enemy Phase: Robin kills 2 dark mages.  Turn 2: Robin kills a cavalier. Miriel kills a myrmidon with a crit ayy lmao. Enemy Phase: RIP Nowi and Gregor. ""That girl is a dragon!"" -Robin, immediately after Nowi's death. Insensitive.  Turn 3: Robin kills a cavalier, Miriel heads towards Village #1. Enemy Phase: Robin kills a dark mage.  Turn 4: Miriel gets the rescue staff. That will be useful eventually. Enemy Phase: Robin gets some more kills.  Turn 5: Robin kills a cavalier, Miriel heads down.  Turn 6: Robin moves towards Village #2, I forgot to move Miriel. Enemy Phase: The fighter and dark mage by Village #2 die. Also Robin got Ignis. Dat's good.  Turn 7: Miriel moves down, Robin gets that powerful Master Seal.  Turn 8: Miriel moves towards Village #3. Enemy Phase: Miriel kills a few dark mages.  Turn 9: Miriel grabs the Second Seal, Robin moves down. Enemy Phase: Only the boss survives.  Turn 10: Everyone gets ready for the boss.  Turn 11: Miriel kills the boss.  TURNS: 11  HEROES: Robin and Chrom  Let's do another chapter. BUT FIRST!  Levels:  Miriel: Level 16  Kellam: Level 13  Chrom: Level 15  Robin: Level 5  SEALS:  I have 1 Master Seal. I don't know who I should give it to.  After some deliberation, I decide to promote Miriel to a Sage.  Miriel: Mage Level 16 -> Sage Level 1  I also have a second seal.  After some more deliberation, I decide to use it on Chrom to make him a Cavalier.  Chrom: Lord Level 15 -> Cavalier Level 1    Now for Chapter 9! (I'm saving Paralogue 3 for Tharja.)  I give Miriel a Heal staff so we can finally have a healer for this one chapter...  Turn 1: Kellam+Miriel, Chrom+Robin. All 4 move forward. Enemy Phase: Killing stuff as usual.  Turn 2: More moving forward.  Turn 3: MORE MOVING FORWARD! AREN'T DESERT LEVELS EXCITING?  Turn 4: Robin kills an archer bc Libra sucks so I'm not recruiting him.  Turn 5-6: Strats to get Tharja. ALSO LIBRA JOINS ANYWAYS WHAT?  Turn 7: Tharja acquired. Enemy Phase: OH GOD CHROM ALMOST DIED.  Turn 8: Robin switches to the front, Tharja and Libra hide in a corner bc A. I can't use Libra and B. Tharja is too weak to do anything. Enemy Phase: Everything but the boss dies.  Turn 9: MORE MOVING HOORAY.  Turn 10: Tharja attacks the boss with Nosferatu. Enemy Phase: I MESSED UP RIP THARJA  Turn 11: Whatever. She wouldn't have even been good till late game. Kellam and Miriel finish the boss off, the end.  TURNS: 11  HEROES: Miriel and Kellam  Emmeryn jumps off a building, happy ending.  Robin/Miriel- C Support  Levels:  Kellam: Level 14  Miriel: Level 2  Chrom: Level 1  Robin: Level 6  PREPARATIONS: I buy Robin 2 Fire tomes because Thunders are blocked by a skirmish. I give Miriel a Dracoshield and Chrom an Energy Drop.  Barracks: Miniature Lance, Slack Bow (Useless since Noire is now off the table.)  NEXT TIME: Paralogue 4, then Paralogue 3"

I can't bring my full team cause someone always ends up getting beserked and killing one of my other units. Tried with just Calev and Shephen and ended up not being able to recruit Karasu for the member card, despite putting him to sleep twice (FYI, you can't talk to sleeping units. Also 3 move lord sucks ass pls save me.) Does anybody know if Karasu will go after the bottom 3 chests if you kill one of the knights guarding the door so he can get through? Cause he just goes for the top two chests and leaves otherwise.  Anyway, I've decided to beat Genealogy of The Holy War for the first time to relieve my frustrations. Needing 7 tabs open so I make sure I get the inheritance right, and making sure I don't miss any of the secret events that the game gives you no indication of is kind of annoying though."

While Cavalier -> Paladin -> Dracoknight is godly, it is nice to reclass your character to SM in the later stages of the game, because of that godly Spd cap.

fireemblem,3dsqxh,RedWolke,2,Sun Jul 19 07:12:08 2015 UTC,"You know what? I'm tired of waiting so I'll just explain what happened in chapter 10. In this chapter I send Our Boy (just guess who that is), Farmer White (Marcus) and Not Gaggles (Wolt) to the east to get Klein (or Klain in this translation) and his archers, meanwhile I send everyone else up to the more westward side to save the villages from destruction. However I do break the rules and rescue Lilina with Bath Salts (Barth) to get her there safetly to recruit Gonzales (who I will feed to a boss as punishment preferably in a chapter with a low amount of deployment slots). I manage to recruit ""Klain"" with Our Boy since he was able to take a hit from ""Klain"" as Farmer White and Not Gaggles clean up on the East. Meanwhile on the west front, 90's Kid (Chad), Trekt (Trec), and Opium Rose (Dorothy) clear the way so I could recruit Gonzales and clear the way to get Tate. I manage to keep Tate alive (same couldn't be said for her Units) and recruited her with ""Klain"" and she took him to safety. There were cavaliers but Bath Salts, Princess Bern (Ellen), and Farmer White managed to hold them off as Trekt, and Cleft Chin Fabio (Bors) visit the east villages and Opium Rose and Not Gaggles take the villages on the east (one of them had an Orion's Bolt). ""Klain""'s archer made it out alive but one of them took damage from the boss (that little baka), successfully yielding the other Orion's Bolt. I have Our Boy kill the boss and sieze the throne. This took about 17 turns I think."

He needs 13 speed to do that, but he has only 11 at base, so I was lucky that he procced speed twice. In addition, Hector also got some good level ups which should help him survive the top half of the map in the next chapter."
fireemblem,3dsqxh,WillLift4Food,2,Sun Jul 19 03:36:22 2015 UTC,"This is for the Awakening Draft.  I got a little inspired by /u/Feplus and his idea of a no promoted units run (any promoted units I got were second sealed into a base class asap), so I decided to test it out here. Hard/Classic, still reclassing, so for the most part pretty easy, but I expected as much. Still, I took notes over the week, and I share what I have so far.  Units:  Ma!Mu: Rockin the usual baby-face with pink hair  Why +Luck/-STR? Well, I figured since I'm marrying Anna, fuck it. Worst Morgan Hype. But anyway, in regards to how I'm building this, my three classes I selected to reclass into are myrm, dark mage, and cleric. Cleric was picked so Morgan could reclass into it. Idea is to  go myrm first, then dark mage for the rest of the playthrough.  Chrom: Time to Chrom. Basically the only other unit I have till I get Panne in Chapter 6, and the only dependable one till I get her to reclass. Reclassing him into Cavalier. Hard support for days.  Olivia: Dancer gonna dance and get all the cool swords.  Chrom!Inigo: Is going to suck and suck to recruit. To add on to it, making him an archer.  Olivia!Lucina: Has an activation skill and vantage. Sweet.  Henry: More dark magic is nice.  Panne: Ridonkulous.  Henry!Yarne: Is being a bitch to recruit. Also Barbarian with Anathema.  Anna: Wifey. Will be nice at healing for a while, but is gonna go back to mage once I get a second seal for her.  Anna!Morgan: Was the only reason I had cleric as a class. Staff and only staff.  Say'ri: Pegasus knight with Astra. Going to be helping Lucina for the most part, so she's good.  Aversa: Could help boost Morgan's mag for rescue range. MVP.  Now that that's done, onto to the show!  Prologue:  Chrom gets killed by a barb with a 56% hit and 6% crit. So you know, average Draft start. 1st reset. Otherwise goes as plan. Lissa holds the Silver Lance while she and Freddy huddle in the corner of the map, and Robin gets most of the EXP. He ends the map at Level 4, and Chrom goes to level 2.  Chapter 1: I guess to make up for the 1st reset, MU decides to get a 4% crit with the thunder tome and gets a perfect level up right after. Had to play a little slower here, since I was trying to level Chrom some more. MU was a unreliable DS (jerk), but wasn't too bad. Robin level 6, Chrom level 4.  Chapter 2: Well you already know this is kind of a pain in the butt in terms of moving undrafted units out of the way. Don't want them to get hit, don't want them to get EXP, the whole deal. Chrom ended up dying again trying to block a lancer getting to kill Sully. 2nd reset. MU got a 3% crit here, based luck. MU level 9, Chrom level 6.  Chapter 3: Alright, selectable deployment, aw yeah. I learn I rely too much on Kellam this map. Had to leave out delicous EXP because I knew I wasn't going to be able to take on all the enemies quickly or safely, so I drifted to Kellam's side because I wanted to recruit him for free vulneraries. Ended up resetting again after opening the door, got to aggressive and I didn't heal when engaging the boss. Level 10 Robin, Level 9 Chrom.  Paralogue 1: Used the second seal from the renown awards here, MU is now a myrm. Deployed Freddy to babysit Donny boy. Wasn't able to clear out the enemies fast enough so the killer lance ended up getting stolen, so that was kinda sad. Had a few close calls here, the archers had me worried a couple considering I was only taking them out one at a time, but ended up okay. Level 2 Myrm!MU, Level 12 Chrom.  Chapter 4: Lel. Level 5 Myrm!MU, Level 13 Chrom.  Interlude: Based Random Anna Shop arrives with based second seal. Chrom changes into a cavalier, where he will stay for the remainder of the run.  Chapter 5: I've legitimately never done this map without the rescue staff before.   Fuuuuuuuuuck.  Nowhere for Dicken and Maribelle to run, and MU and Chrom couldn't get rid of the enemies fast enough. Dicken was able to take a couple of hits, after lending him some Vulneraries, but wasn't able to save himself from the swarm of enemies coming on all sides. Maribelle was almost scot free to the lower half of the map, but eventually got jumped by two wyvern riders before she cpuld even cross the pathway. Could've reset. Could've. Level 8 Myrm!Robin, Level 6 Cav!Chrom.  I think I'll end it here for now. I have more done, but I don't want this being too long. A rather poor performance by me so far, which I guess I can pass off as a lack of focus/caring, but bad is bad."

Although from what I've read of his supports, I'm kind of scared as to how I'll find Silas when this thing is localised, but for now he's still top.  I clicked Kaze when against Saizou far too fast, in reality they're either tied, or by basing it on previous experiences with red/green cavvies then I'll like Saizou more.   Elfie looks so cool.

But hey, I think he's cool. /T_T/  Name: Bel  Class: Heretic  (Dark magic)--> Excommune (Excommune can use healing staves as light magic weapons.)  Stats & Growths: Insanely good luck and Defense, to counter the standard stat spread. Poor speed, utterly pathetic CON, surprisingly low RES growth, though with a passable base, and normal everything else.  Supports: Gets into philosophical debates with the Merric of the game. No succinct ending is ever reached and they spend the entire story measuring their magical schlongs against each other. In this ending, they go their separate ways, but duel every three months. Neither has managed to kill the other.  -Tries to figure out why Clerics can't use staves as weapons with the Lena of the game. In trying to figure out the answer to this utterly scientific question, he learns the value of compassion. In this ending, he rejoins the church, and becomes a Bishop.  -Gets into tactical arguments with the lord of the game, berating his lack of aggression. Bel eventually learns that his needlessly aggressive approach makes unnecessary enemies, which make it much harder for everyone else--so the lord threatens to kick him out. He accepts the lord's judgement as superior... for now. In this ending, the lord constantly watches over his back waiting to be backstabbed, but it never comes.  -Mocks the Draug of the game for their complete lack of magical defense. Bel eventually reveals that he was doing it out of jealousy, as he felt his massive defense was better suited to being a Knight, but has no physical strength, so was unable to achieve that dream. In this ending, Bel actually tries working out, with the Draug as his coach.  Backstory: Wanted to become a knight in the empire's army, but dropped out. His defense is stellar, but he can't pick up an iron sword without sweating. Mocked mercilessly by the other knights. Joined clerics, where he was kicked out due to his aggression and uncaring attitude. Finally joined the mages, where he was shunned because he preferred dark magic to the standard Anima that was taught.  Quotes: -Death: Oh... so that's what my insides look like. N-not particularly n-notable...  -Endgame: The... the perfect specimen... Haha! Begin the dissection!  -Criticals: ""This won't hurt a bit!"" ""Bite the pillow!"" ""Show me that heart of yours!""  -Recruitment: ""Betray my colleagues? No, no. They are valiant soldiers. Very good at their job, yes. Perhaps... too good. Say, I haven't actually seen any action hanging around back here. I've been trying to figure out how combat magic affects a person, but they keep sticking me at the back of the formation. How many  people are in your group of merry men?""    (If outnumbered by enemy) ""Oh. Less than the empire's, eh...? Heh heh heh. I often wondered why command stuck me behind a squadron of Knights. I think I'll start my experiments... on them!""  (If outnumbering enemy) ""Oh. More than the empire's, eh...? Heh heh heh. I often wondered why command stuck me behind a squadron of useless Knights when my defense is even higher than theirs. I think I'll start my experiments... on you!""  Recruitment Method: Bel is an enemy who can only be recruited early on in the map-- but the catch is that he's stationary, and at the back of the map. He'll only allow the Lord to recruit him if their army is still outnumbered. You start out outnumbered, of course, but if you don't try to avoid killing people, you'll probably outnumber them by the time you reach him.  Unique Weapons: Light Hole (Can do Dark or Light Damage, chosen randomly. Dark is less accurate but more powerful, Light is more accurate but less powerful.)  Anything Else?: Looks edgy as balls. Edgier than a tin of razor blades covered in Shadow the Hedgehog stickers given to Dante from the Devil May Cry series.  Ok, not really. Is wearing the simple, white-hooded Cleric's outfit, though it has the elaborate trappings of the Mage's outfit, with gold trim everywhere. Excommune looks similar, though the Cleric's robe is now covered in the shimmery silk of modern Dark Mages. Oh, and he gets a cape."

fireemblem,3drhl7,rattatatouille,3,Sun Jul 19 00:13:37 2015 UTC,"Uh, okay.  Name: Korith  Clasels: Monk, but punches stuff.   Stats: High defense, Incredible str, and speed, low res and magic.  Supports: Fuck if I know.  Backstory: Korith wasn't an orphan, nor was he a child soldier. In fact, he lived a relatively healthy early life. His parents, while religious nearly to a fault, were quite open-minded to whatever their son might aspire to do. At age 17, Korith had decided he would follow in his father's footsteps, and become a monk. It was then that he discovered he was magically inept. Rather than let this deter him, he asked for help. The gods he prayed to offered no solace, causing him to doubt his faith. Before he had a mental crisis, a fellow Priest stepped in and gifted him gloves; enchanted, of course.  Korith went on with this simple lifestyle, daily chores, prayer, and meals. Shortly after turning 32, the priest that had gifted him his gloves decided he was ready to move up. However, first he had to find the means. So he set out, in search of a truly noble cause, one even he could help with.  Quotes: (Upon death) ""Ah... I feel the warm embrace of the gods..."" (Endgame start) ""I have found my cause. Tell me what you need, and I will do it."" (Crits) ""Gods, please forgive my approaching display of brutality!"" ""My body is a righteous weapon!"" ""IF YOU HAVE ANY GODS, I SUGGEST PRAYING!"" (Recruitment) ""Only someone of pure heart would take the time to help a stranger. I will follow you until I can find my cause. If it lies with you, so be it.""  Recruitment method: Around chapter six of this imaginary game, Korith is surrounded by enemies. He is independent of the actual fight on the map, as he is flagged down by brigands, as opposed to the enemy soldiers in the map proper. The player must kill at least two of the enemies surrounding Korith, and then talk to him. If they kill less than two, he will thank them, and leave the map, after giving the player a holy water.  Unique Weapons: Studded gloves. Takes two inventory slots. Unlimited durability, has light damage, if the game differentiates magic types. Korith can have one on him, but his damage will be halved. With both gloves, he has 10 might. If only using one glove, his total Attack is halved. So, I can manage some semblance of balance, skewed as it may be.  The end. Now I feel qualified to make a Sanic OC.  I'll name him Edgy the Edgehog. Instead of having fur, he actually has tiny swords growing out of him, and is the fastest, strongest, coolest hedgehog. Even among Edgehogs, he is, objectively, dabes."

Backstory: Isaac was the son of a Plegian Knight on the border regions of Ylisse and Plegia. A child during the Ylissean Crusades, Isaac and his mother were evacuated from his hometown and sent to a refugee camp. His father was sent to the battlefield and later came to the camp after losing his arm in battle. Isaac learned to live in the refugee camp and in the years he lived there, he learned the basics of magic from a few of the guards. That life ended horribly when Chrom's father and his soldier raided the camp. Isaac saw his mother cut down by Chrom's father with his own eyes. His father was similarly killed, trying to escape, while he cradled Isaac in his arm.   His father's fallen corpse hid Isaac during the chaos of the raid but trapped him until ""the crows were cawing."" He would later use the memory of being trapped as the ""catalyst"" for his dark magic.  After experiencing such events, Isaac believed that peace between Ylisse and Plegia was impossible and joined Garrick's bandit group to weaken Ylisse before a second war began. Even though he knew war was terrible, it was inevitable. He avoided Garrick's fate during the prologue due to him nursing a fellow bandit who fell sick, but ended up being attacked by the Risen in Chapter One.  After surviving the night though a desperate alliance with the Shepherds, Isaac began to question his own opinions about Ylisseans. His doubt was further compounded after seeing one of Emmeryn's speeches which strongly advocated for peace. When he heard about the assassination, he chose to protect the Exalt.  NOTES: Devout Grimleal. His presence humanizes the Grimleal and makes them a bit more than ""let's destroy everything, lol."" In some of his supports, he explains that the Grimleal are separated into several denominations, ranging from, ""Grima and Naga are both Divine Dragons and both are needed for the world to keep turning."" to ""Grima is a divine entity, which watches over his flock by destroying pests or famines.(As in destroying things like Locusts which can lead to nasty things like starvation)"" to ""Grima can destroy all those who wronged us and allow the devoted to take over the world.""   He also explains that since the previous two denominations were closer to the Ylissean border, they were primarily the ones massacred during the Ylissean crusade. Furthermore, due to the sheer brutality of of the crusade, driven mad by grief, many of the moderate Grimleal became extremists following the third sect.   In his male Robin supports, Isaac notes that, ""the third Sect of the Grimleal"" seeks to bring ""God to Earth"" through a mortal host. He explains that such a process would likely drive the host (and possibly Grima as well) insane in the process. This allows Grima to stay the obviously evil dude he is in the story, but still make him a plausible god for him to follow.   His female Robin support would probably be some generic filler. Why? Because while Male Robin could wear gloves, making it entirely possible that Isaac would never see Robin's right hand, it is highly unlikely that Isaac would never see his wife's right hand, making that entire support line go belly up.  Isaac also is mildly unnerved by Chrom's presence due to Chrom's strong familial resemblance to (Chrom's) father. This effect is only amplified by the fact that his parents were killed by the Falchion. In this support Isaac talks an awful amount of smack about Naga and expresses a clear distaste for Chrom. By A rank, he finds closure by remembering that ""no man deserves to carry his father's sins."" and makes a sincere effort to become friends with Chrom.   If he survived the war, he regains his position as one of Plegia's nobles and works tirelessly to rebuild his homeland; while serving as a liaison between Ylisse and Plegia to strengthen the ties between the two nations."
fireemblem,3drhl7,Molto1128,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:16:12 2015 UTC,"I've actually been working on this since the personal skills thread, so sorry if it's alot but I've been putting down ideas for a while.  Josef Class: Yeoman (Bow + Hidden Weapon) -> Avenger or Ranger. Ranger is a mounted class that adds swords to its available weapons, it's a fast mobile support unit with decent attack/defense/resist, low magic and high luck/skill/speed. Avenger is a powerful attacking unit with access to all 3 ranged weapon types, high but balanced offensive stats, great skill and speed, decent luck and resist but shit defense.  Stats: Basically the above, great offensive growths, decent speed/skill/Luck and below average hp/defense/resist growths.  Background: Grew up isolated in the woods from contact outside family. Abusive step father, mother died in childbirth, though his half sister lives. He loves her, and wants to protect her. Father missing, dissapered into the woods at age 5.  Personality - mature for his age, dry wit, sarcastic sense of humor. Frugal due to his step father's inability to manage money. Doesn't like to spend on frivolities except for his sister, who knows his every weakness, but is not money crazed, just conservative. Caring, looks after the younger members of the army, acts like a big brother. Brilliant shot with any ranged weapon, has a habit of practicing his shots against a tree when frustrated. Has night terrors and a recurring nightmare of his step-father brutally attacking him and his sister, but refuses to tell anyone or ask for help. Best murderous stare of the army.  Supports - Anna, if she is available. Expect a debate over Anna's obsession with money and to what lengths it is acceptable to obtain it. After the war, they go on to form a hugely successful international trading company.  I'm mostly a lurker here, so I don't really have many friends on this sub could really support with :( Recruitment: Step-father, a drunkard who owes money to a local gang leader, sells son to work off debts as a bandit. Joins after convo w/lord who promises to evict the father and save the sister. Sister joins post battle as a troubador.  Quotes - (recruitment) ""Hey, you, with the face. Get me out of here. I was forced to work with this dastard, my stupid step-father sold into slavery to work off his debts. My village isn't far from here, if you can promise me we can rescue my sister, I'll help you. I promise, you won't regret it!"" Crit ""Hey ugly!"" ""The gods can't help you now!"" ""Bullseye!"" Death ""Freaking A....""  Personal Skill: Crippling Strike- If the user gets a critical hit, enemy str/skill/Defense - 2, speed -4, and movement and hit/evade are halved till next turn. Starting weapons: Bronze Bow, personal knife: Hookfang, 1 range indestructible, str/mag/def/res/skill/Speed - 2, poison status (-5 HP each turn once the character has acted, e.g they turn grey for the turn.)  Other: knife is a relic from his father, only memento they have, cursed so it can't be more than 5 feet from him, returns to his side if it leaves. Father is actually the immortal former priest to the big bad evil god of the game, a la Hohenheim, left to keep family away from danger. Starts with D rank in bows and C rank in hidden weapons, but bc of bandit leader's incompetence the group is poor. Joins early, like chapter 2 or 3.  Appearance: Young, late teens/early twenties. Fit but not buff, tall and tan with dark brown hair, a silver forlock a la Kinu and dark eyes. Notable scar near his right eye where his step-father attacked him with a broken beer bottle, his only insecurity besides the nightmares. Permanent bags under his eyes from insomnia due to nightmares."
fireemblem,3drhl7,UltimateGir,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:20:50 2015 UTC,"Get ready for a giant pile of mediocrity, /r/fireemblem!  Name: Molto  Class: Mercenary, reclass options being cav and myrmidon (and all the promoted variants of those classes, of course--hero probably being the best fit, but that MAY be my hero-bias coming through).   Stats & Growths: Fantastic strength and skill, good speed and HP, average defense, sad resistance and magic, absolutely pitiful luck. Starts with low bases but has growths and caps to make up for it.  Supports: I don't really know, to be honest (doesn't help that I'm new to the subreddit and don't know anyone). Maybe most people?  Backstory: Son of a famous knight who retired after sustaining a serious injury; she instilled loyalty and honor in him. Lonely growing up, he never had many friends in his large hometown, spending most of his time reading epic stories of heroes and villains. One of his only friends growing up was a child from the slums who tragically lost his life in a bandit raid. When he got older, Molto decided he wanted to try and follow in his mother's footsteps and serve the kingdom--though as she was unable to train him, he went to a local mercenary band for training instead, which was owned by a friend of his mother's. Molto is quite sarcastic, but under that is a kind, warm, and compassionate--if a tad awkward--individual. He doubts himself and his abilities constantly and has pessimistic tendencies (all of which stem from his failure to save his friend back in the day), and is still quite lonely--not to mention ridiculously clumsy, whether on his feet or with words (sincere words, that is--he rarely stumbles when giving a sarcastic quip). Due largely to his sense of loyalty and his lonely childhood, he values his friends highly, and will fight tooth-and-nail to keep them safe. Molto also loves literature, and it is one of the few things he can speak about without a hint of awkwardness.  Quotes: Recruitment: ""If you're the ones fighting to protect this town, I-I want to help! I may not be the deftest fighter, b-but I'm sure I could... uh... distract the bastards for a second or two..."" Criticals: ""Sorry about this!"" ""This may sting a bit!"" ""I won't let you hurt my friends!"" ""This is gonna leave one hell of a mark!"" ""Your day's about to get a whole lot worse!"" ""Hey, look over there!"" Death: ""I can't believe it... dying now? Heh. Useless, through and... through."" Death (endgame): ""Damn it all! I can't... die. Not... not yet. Not while they... need me."" Endgame: ""Somehow I managed to make it this far, and I'm sure as hell not giving up now! I've got your backs, guys!"" Promotion/Class Change: ""...Hey, I actually feel stronger! Huh.""  Recruitment Method: Probably in one of the earlier chapters, will join with the lord in defense of his hometown at the start of the third turn.  Unique Weapon: Carsomyr. +15 crit; 17 Mt; +3 strength, skill, speed, and defense; requires A-rank in swords (Molto starts with E or D). His mother's blade, likely looks similar to Ragnell/Alondite (in that it's a fancy-ass 2-handed sword). ""The blade of a legendary knight""  Unique/Personal Skill: Lonely: Gains a bonus to crit and hit when within 2 tiles of an ally, but has a penalty to hit and crit if not within 3 tiles of an ally (pair-ups probably wouldn't count for balance reasons)  Color Scheme and Appearance (because why not?): Would have a unique (non-boring) color scheme for each (or at least the mercenary tree), likely black and gold (to emulate his mother's armor) with some purple accents. Taller than most (Stahl-like), with long purple hair (because FE needs more purple hair, damn it!) and blue eyes."

Upgrades to Weapon Apprentice (Swords and Lance), then Weapon Master (Swords, Lance, and Axes)  Can reclass to Mage and Caviler and those classes promotions (once Apprentice is reached)   Stats & Growths: Weak in the beginning, but gains great Strength, Defense, and Speed. Decent at everything else. He'll basically be like all the other trainer classes and become godly later.   Supports: He supports with those he considered helpful in his training. If female, he can have S support with them (including you if this is like Awakening or If)  Backstory: Cothy was a blacksmith apprentice to a man named Lain, a heroic soldier. Lain was murder by a band of bandits and his village burned. He was the only known survivor. He knows the murderer was Lain's brother, Jailes.  He then had to live in the forest, learning to fight in battle to avenge his fallen friend. Except he sucks, bad.

You're lord (Insert name here)  L: Yes, is something wrong? What are you doing in the forest?  C: Just training....Well atleast I am. Right now, I am trying to strike this dummy.  L: It seems like you haven't even land a slice.  C: Yeah I know, I'm terrible.  L: Don't beat yourself, you just need someone to help you out. What about some soldier back in your village?  C: No, it was burned down. A man named Jailes and his bandits murder all the townfolks, including a friend of mine.  L: I'm sorry.  C: Sorry for the story, but any training would be helpful right now.  L: Well I can't personally train you, but if you join along in my army, I could easily find someone to help you.  C: You mean it!  L: Of course!  C: Alright sir! I am at your command! Oh by the way, the names Cothy.  L: Good to meet you, Cothy.  With created avatar (Non-Lord)  A: Hey.  C: Oh hello there.  A: What are you doing?  C: Trying to strike this dummy.  A: I see no scars on it....  C: Yeah, haven't strike it a single time. I'm bad at this.  A: Let me see for myself.  C: Ok  Goes to black for a bit  A: Wow, that was bad.  C: Yeah, it was horrible. I'll never impress Lain.  A: Lain?  C: He was one of the greatest soldier in my village. He could use many weapons masterfully. But he died  protecting the village by his own brother, Jailes. Everyone but me died.  A: I'm so sorry. Hey but listen, I know a way you can get better and impress Lain. C: How?  A: Well I am working for lord Insert name. His army is looking for new people.  C: Wouldn't I be a drag though?

By the way, the name is Cothy  A: The names (Avatar's name). Hope you can help Cothy.  C: Oh I will!

Why did you come to the village and murder everyone, including your own brother?  J: I felt bored.   C: You felt bored?!?  J: Come now Cothy, you grown a lot. Have you ever felt how good it is to stick a sword into someone? They yell,  scream in agony. Its soothing to my ears. You belong to (lord's name) group. You should know by now about killing others.  C: Killing isn't fun! I did this to protect others, unlike you who murder others for sick enjoyment, especially innocent villagers! They don't deserve to be harmed!  J: They do, especially Lain.

Master: Ha, This is too easy now! I will take you down! My blade will strike you down!  Recruitment Method: Usually early in the game, the Lord finds Cothy in a forest training alone. If this is Awakening and If style, the created character would recruit him if the lord can't reach him.   Unique Weapons: Lain's pride (A unbreakable sword that gives Cothy +10 in strength. Only can obtain it if Cothy kills Jailes)  Other things:  If the game played like Fates, or Awakening, Cothy gets an S support with someone, he can his own child, Yolie. She starts out as a Master Apprentice (can reclass to other classes her father and mother can). She would basically be a most kawaii cute looking girl ever, but would totally kick anyone ass and usually undermined for her looks.   However, Cothy must be a Weapon Master (Or a 2nd tier class, like a Sage or Paladin) before he can S support others.  Cothy also can 4 rare skills only obtain by him and Yolie.  First Skill is for Newbie, Trainer's Look Out: He gets +5 Strength when paired up with someone and attacking. +5 Defense when he is being attacked and paired up   Second Skill is for the Apprentice, Learner's Advantage: He gets  +20 hit and +20 avoidance if he is paired up  Third Skill is for Weapon Master (Level 1) Helping Hand: This help gives others you pair up +5 strength and defense, +20 hit and avoidance without needing a support with that character. Bonus of pairs up if he can support them.  Fourth Skill is for Weapon Master (Level 30, slow as hell, but worth it) Lain's Bravery: Male galeforce. Yep, basically get another turn if Cothy kills someone doing the player's turn  Doesn't stack with Galeforce (Sorry Yolie)"

fireemblem,3drke8,GoldenMapleLeaf,12,Sat Jul 18 19:46:10 2015 UTC,"LEIF  Quite appropriately, as of thursday I have just completed my first play through of Thracia 776. If you haven't read /u/ SabinSuplexington's analysis of Leif's character you should do so first here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/39qeui/debate_who_is_the_best_written_lord/cs5irxa it is quite well written. Unlike other games in the series, the gameplay and story of Thracia are closely linked; Leif is no exception to this.  It's no secret that Leif is considered one of the weakest Lords, for a comparison lets go for Roy  Leif's Growths: 70, 35, 10, 35, 40, 40, 25, 15, 3  Avg Stats at unpromoted 20: 35.3, 10.65, 1.9, 8.65, 12.6, 13.6, 7.75, 7.85, 6.57  (HP, Str, Mag, Skl, Spd, Lck, Def, Bld, Mov)  Roy's Growths: 80, 40, 50, 40, 60, 25, 30   Avg Stats at unpromoted 20: 33.2, 12.6, 14.5, 14.6, 18.4, 9.75, 5.7  (HP, Str, Skl, Spd, Lck, Def, Res)  Ignoring Build and Move for Leif, and equating Mag for Leif with Res for Roy, that gives us a total of 255 for Leif and 325 for Roy. Average stats at unpromoted 20 (because Thracia has way lower caps, so this is the best apples to apples comparison) give Leif a 90.45 and Roy a 108.75. Roy is considered a weak lord, and Leif is significantly weaker than that. (btw, Chrom would score a 405 and 169.05 respectively to give you an idea of the stat inflation since).  Also running against Leif is that he is sword-locked and that he doesn't gain a mount after promotion (until FE4 Gen2 ;) ).   There are a few mitigating factors that make Leif more playable. He's the best candidate for the many stat boosters you get in the first few chapters. This is because he's the only character from chapter 1-3 who continues into the Manster chapters 4-6/7. He's also a prime candidate to get several of the early crusader scrolls (each scroll nets you a 30% stat increase. So one scroll gives you +3 to a stat over 10 levels up on average).   Finally, Leif starts with Ethlyn's Light Brand. A 60 usage weapon with above average might, ranged lightning magic, and usage as a vulnerary. Did I mention it also gives Leif a +10 to luck? It's not the best prf weapon in the game, but it has the best availability and is very versatile. It's incredibly useful to take down the early bosses who have high defense but low magic. Still, you can't rely on it exclusively or it will break early.  Furthermore, mounts are less essential in Thracia 776 than in other games. There are a substantial number of indoor maps where mounted units are forced to dismount anyways (some like Fin lose use of their highest weapon ranks and must use a secondary. Fin is forced to switch to swords). In addition, most of the large outdoor maps are complicated enough to require slow progress or turtling anyways (Chapter 14 and fog of war chapters come to mind).  We also must put Leif in context with the enemies from Thracia 776. They're quite weak on average, and their difficulty more comes from their placement, reinforcements, and weapons. All of those can be countered by appropriate equipment and tactics from the player with Leif. Thracia 776 also has a 20 stat cap across the board, this means that Leif will actually catch up with everyone else by the end of the game (http://serenesforest.net/thracia-776/characters/average-stats/leaf/, he'll cap Spd and Lck).  Through all of that, I hope to have established Leif as a usable but below average member of your party early on, and perhaps one of the weaker lords. Yet I am arguing he is the best Lord in the series! What gives?  The answer is that Leif fits Thracia 776 like a glove. He is the best lord because he is the most appropriate by a mile.  Thracia 776 takes place in a penninsula ravaged by war, with its people a subject nationality under the control of the Grandbell Freege family and the Lopto Church. The latter of those factions is portrayed as unreconciably evil with unspeakable atrocities commited upon innocent civilians through child hunts.  Leif and his crew start out and remain underpowered for a large portion of the game, which just makes sense. They're a rag tag group of teenagers fighting an empire, they should be weak and underpowered. Leif is a naive and young leader, and his stats reflect that. By this design, enemy units feel brutal. It makes the game feel dark just by design and gameplay. You're forced to turtle, to play safe, to outhink your enemy to beat each chapter. This is exactly what Leif has to do in the story.  Eventually, through further allies and reinforcements your party powers up, and takes on large strongholds like Tahra and Leonster. After reclaiming his home country in chapter, Leif promotes from Lord to Prince. He does this not because he found some amazing super magic weapon, but because he becomes a Prince literally! He is no longer a kid hiding and running, he is a real leader with real political power and the boost in stats reflects that. (You'll also note that Prince is his starting class in the chronologically later FE4 Gen2. Excellent continuity.)  After promoting, though late, he gains levels quickly and becomes powerful enough to help out on the lategame chapters. He is again a prime candidate for crusader scrolls usage, and he'll grow to be an asset to your party despite his low growths and starting stats. Leif procedes to reconquer the northern half of thracia and ousts the Lopto church and the Freege overlords and the year turns to Gran 777. Leif joins Seliph's party as a powerful Prince who would promote into a Master Knight and help reclaim the entire continent from Lopto.  Leif is the best lord in the series because of his low stats, and not in spite of them. He starts weak and ends strong to reflect his real storied progression. Thracia 776 wouldn't be the same without him in this state."

fireemblem,3drke8,Apprentice57,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:51:55 2015 UTC,"Shrugs its news to me if he is considered high tier. I've always seen him grouped with Roy as the weakest lord.  The stats analysis above speaks for why I would consider him as a weak lord. As I later qualified, he isn't a weak unit (merely average for Thracia) but Lords on a whole are very powerful group.  In addition, his growths and starting stats were significantly nerfed from those of his in Thracia IIRC."
fireemblem,3drke8,Ownagepuffs,2,Sun Jul 19 03:46:25 2015 UTC,"I mean, from what I've heard, Leif is your best unit for the hardest portion of the game and enjoys usual lord perks on top of no fatigue and he supports like a million units. He's a utility lord, and Thracia has enough combat units. Leif may not be strong but he seems to be very useful."

I'm definitely no expect on FE5, but I have learned a lot from the discussiom of others. I'd love to be corrected on my initial statement by someone more experienced than me.

fireemblem,3drke8,punk_emblem,7,Mon Jul 20 00:56:37 2015 UTC,"Hopefully I'm not too late.   Eliwood  For this discussion, we will be looking at Eliwood in his mode.   Weapons  Eliwood is often attacked because he strictly uses swords until promotion despite there already being a sword using lord and axe using lord. While it makes sense on paper to give him a lance, you have to look at the grand scheme of things. He isn't like, say, Ephraim, who didn't want to be a leader and instead be a soldier who uses lances instead of the more regal and proper sword. He uses the sword because that's all he knows from life growing up being royal and such.   growths  Another reason Eliwood is often disliked is because of him not being strong and meaty like Hector or fast and critical-hit-getting (not a word) like Lyn. Eliwood has something the other two don't, however. Balance. Unlike Hector, he will double somewhat often as well as being able to hit his target. And unlike Lyn, he can take a hit in the likely event that lance users come to play. The possibility of him being ""screwed"" is often the subject of many players dismay. But the game itself tries to help this as soon as the first chapter by handing the player an energy ring and dragon shield.   Promotion  Like his son, Eliwood's promotion time can be problematic. However, unlike Roy or Hector, a properly trained Eliwood will destroy out of the gate due to getting a mount in addition to lances. This fits with the story because at this time Eliwood will want nothing more than death to his enemy.   That's what I got. No you aren't getting a tldr."
fireemblem,3drke8,ShroudedInMyth,13,Sat Jul 18 23:35:38 2015 UTC,"BERWICK SAGA - REESE      Berwick Saga is basically an unofficial Fire Emblem game; I like to think of it as part of an extended series between the Fire Emblem series and the TearRing Saga series. Because of this, everything that applies to the main series applies to this game and its lord. There are significant differences, which I will explain when they become relevant, but don’t think you need some sort of different criteria from the other games to discuss this game and unit.     Reese: The young prince of Chinon; son of King Vanstol. He is the hero of this game.     General     Reese has very different availability than the other Lords, he is only required on the main missions and is unavailable for the side missions, so he’s only available for under half the game. This puts him at a lower level than everyone else, so despite his high growths he mostly likely won’t be your best combat unit. Many chapters are built around this with seize objectives or optional objectives that require him to talk to someone that puts him deep into enemy territory. The ranking system discourages turtling him until it is safe since you often get a Tactics point for clearing a chapter in a certain amount of turns. Keep in mind his promotion is tied to the Ranking system; getting 18 Tactics points promotes him early, otherwise he promotes at Chapter 10. This encourages you to use him extensively in the chapters he’s in for reasons other than “he’s required, so might as well.” His biggest advantage availability-wise is his free deployment spot reserved exclusively for him, unlike mostly everyone else who are mercenaries and need to be hired to be deployed until they are permanently recruited.   Reese starts off the game with the typical low Lord base stats, he 3-4HKOs at base and won’t grow out of it for some time. Reese still has utility in the early game with his Commander skill, which grants +10 accuracy to all allies within 3 hexes. This game usually has hit rates around 60% and uses the 1RN system, so this really helps the other’s units attacks connect. He also has Advanced which allows him to wield higher level equipment that helps him out in the early game to keep up with the rest of the cast by using special swords such as the Rapier and Killer Blade. This a game where it’s rare to 1RKO even the generic enemy since there is no natural doubling, so his Continue (Adept) skill is quite valuable  but it’s not reliable, at base it only has 9% (Weapon Skill/2 + AS) chance to proc. Of course this is better than anyone else on the starting party other than Ward (the resident Jagen) with his Knight Sword (+1 attack number), Sherlock (Horseman) with Re-attack (attack again) and Multi-shot (2 consecutive attacks) which both have a cooldown period and maybe Leon (the Cain Archetype) if you count his Deathmatch skill (extends combat to 5 rounds). Reese can use swords and small shields which have little weight; Continue can only proc if his Attack Speed equals five or more, so early on you have a choice to forgo a shield for a chance of a Continue proc and more avoid or use the shield for more concrete durability. Later on when he promotes, he can use the heavier medium shields so this choice will still be there after he grown. He also gains the Miracle skill in Chapter 10-1 which gets better the more avoid he has (90-enemy hit rate%), which further reinforces the choice between durability by avoid or durability by concrete defenses. He gets the Tulsa Ornament in Chapter 9 which grants him Fortitude (negates criticals), not very useful except on a few enemies but it’s nice to know that a stray critical won’t cause a game over. He also has Robust which makes him immune to Injury and Cripple status which happen randomly. Cripple is especially bad to deal with since it makes the unit randomly stop when it moves and allows the unit to be captured; so Robust helps lessen the annoyance of RNG-screwage. Miracle also has this anti-frustration effect on the player, making it unlikely that Reese will get killed by low hit rates.  Reese gets two powerful personal weapons, Lord Gram and Succeed. Lord Gram is obtained in Chapter 5 which is reasonably early in a game with 15 main chapters. It has 13 mt which puts it among the strongest swords, but its true value lies in that it gives Reese one extra attack which essentially allows him to double and to counter even if he takes damage (units can’t normally counter if they take damage). Remember that he can still proc Continue with this extra hit, making it more reliable. It also negates fatal attacks but breaks afterwards; thankfully it can repaired with 7 uses of a repair stone since personal weapons turn into their broken counterparts instead of disappearing when they run out of uses. There are 40 uses of the Repair stone throughout the game, so 7 uses is a significant cost. Succeed he gets in Chapter 13 and is tailored made to take on the endgame. It has 15 mt (the second strongest sword in the game) and does 15 bonus Holy damage getting past the high defense foes of the endgame. It also grants 15 Dark Resistance, negating most of the damage of even the strongest all dark magic, which makes up the majority of the enemies’ magic. It recovers durability when advancing to the next chapter, so you don’t have to worry about losing it, but you shouldn’t spam it either. Lanette (Reese’s adoptive sister, Apostle, pseudo-Gotoh) can also help him out in the endgame with Assist which grants him guaranteed critcals if she’s adjacent to him. So despite the powerful enemies of the endgame, he has the tools to take care of them no matter how low his stats are.   continued...  Edit: I forgot to mention that he doesn't have ranged attacks because all swords are 0-range (unit goes to enemies hex to attack and gains that hex's terrain bonuses.) But if he gets 11+ AS, he can counter 1-range attacks (projectiles from adjacent hexes). Another example of whether or not forgo a shield."
fireemblem,3drke8,ShroudedInMyth,12,Sat Jul 18 20:02:30 2015 UTC,"BERWICK SAGA - REESE continued from previous post     Horse     Reese starts off with a horse but don’ think he’s Sigurd 2.0; horses can die in this game and are expensive to replace. The cheapest horse costs 1000D and the best horses cost upward to 24000D.  These horses have special effects like +1 movement, +1 damage, + 2 Speed and +3 defense which can help patch up his weak areas. Re-Move (Canto) can only be used only if the attacker took no damage so it’s not as overpowered as in the other games. Horses also suffer some significant movement penalties on rough terrain and can’t climb cliffs. Reese’s unmounted movement type still has bad movement penalties on rough terrain, especially on cliffs, which he does not want to be in since it cuts his avoid down to zero. Chapter 11-1 is cruelly designed to exploit this, with its 20-turn seize objective, and the path to the seize point requiring Reese to walk on cliffs with a bunch of ballistae shooting at him. His horse actually has significant advantages and disadvantages unlike the other games where the disadvantages are mostly non-existent.     Food     Isn’t it neat that you can feed your units food in Fire Emblem Fates to get small stat boosts? Well today you learn that Berwick Saga did it first. The food and guests are randomly generated when you first visit the Kingfisher’s Pavilion for the chapter and Reese has permanent seat there so these stat boosts are always available to him. The food gives different characters different stat boosts based on their taste, and these effects are quite varied. Looking over Reese’s favorite foods he has many that increase his HP, accuracy, avoid and crit, improving the reliability of his attacks and improving his durability. The avoid bonuses in particular synergizes very well with his Miracle skill. He can also eat the Narvia Salad to heal his horse by 50% HP lost (How does that work?) for a mere 360D, which is the best out of all the food. Keep in mind food is the only way to heal horses other than the Horse Master skill which he doesn’t have. Reese can also eat the Cream Salad for 50% experience gain; this helps him keep up with the other units because he can only be deployed in required missions. It is worth noting that a unit can only be fed food once per chapter, so you will have to choose which effects will be the most useful for the chapter.     Furniture     I said before that quite possibly the biggest thing to differentiate Reese from the other lords is furniture. I wasn’t kidding. In Berwick Saga you can buy furniture to decorate Reese’s office, but this isn’t just for cosmetic purposes because they all have hidden effects on Reese, like increasing his growth rates. He actually gets his Miracle skill from the Maiden Statue, which he gets in Chapter 10-1. Buying all furniture is required for maximum Action Rank, which is basically a ranking system for optional objectives. Furniture is the most expensive thing in the game, so unless you’re hoarding money to buy them all at once, it’s likely you’ll only buy them one at a time. What this means is that you have a choice in his progression even though this game has no Avatar or reclass mechanic.  So what options does Reese have available and how does it affect the game? One of the most significant and cheaper options is the Big Carpet, which grants him +10% Continue rate which helps him get decent rates early on. Especially since weapon skill factors into the calculation and increases by just using the weapon similar to weapon rank, so attacking twice converts into more weapon skill growth which converts to a higher Continue rate. There’s the Tapestry which increases the radius of his Commander skill from 3 hexes to 4 hexes. There’s the Revival Masterpiece and Sword Mounting, which adds the Weapon Care (Armsthrift) Skill and increases his sword growth respectively.  Weapon Care can be used to preserve Lord Gram, his personal weapon saving on Repair Stone uses and the sword growth can get him to be more accurate and increase his Continue proc even faster. Obviously getting the Sword Mounting as early as possible is preferred to make the most out of it, but Continue is more immediately useful. There is also other furniture that increases his growths or increases his combat parameters so you have a choice to make Reese more immediately useful at the cost of some long term growth.  The Chest (gives money each chapter), Coffer (gives a potion each chapter), and Porcelain Vase (increases amount of Happiness that females gain when hired, high Happiness is usually required for permanent recruitment) are also furniture you need to get early to get the most use out of. Since you need to buy all this furniture for Rankings anyways, you have to decide which order is the most beneficial to get them in.      Overall     A lot of effort was put to make Reese useful throughout the entire game. Early on his low bases make him a poor combat unit, but he serves good utility with Commander. Later on he gets his personal weapons and skills that help him keep up if he is massively RNG screwed or become one of the better combat if he didn’t (keep in mind that this game has a bracketing system that prevents extreme deviations from the average, so he won’t be too weak or too strong). Training him is very interesting since you can influence his growth path without it being overpowered like in the latest Fire Emblem games. During battle equipping and unequiping his shield basically changes his mode of combat from a low-risk, low-reward setup of lower Continue and Miracle rates but more concrete durability to a high-risk, high-reward setup of higher Continue and Miracle rates but less concrete defenses. He has built in anti-frustration features like Miracle, Fortitude and Robust to reduce annoyance from the RNG. All this makes him one of the most unique, interesting and fun unit in the game and the extended franchise."
fireemblem,3drke8,Chastlily,4,Sat Jul 18 20:08:32 2015 UTC,"Kudos to you for doing Berwick Saga <3 ilovemyflairyes  A very complete explanation about why he's a good unit, good job o:"
fireemblem,3drke8,Longshotte,2,Sat Jul 18 20:11:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for writing this up man. Very interesting read! Reese really is one of the most unique units I've seen.
fireemblem,3drke8,Ownagepuffs,13,Sat Jul 18 20:49:54 2015 UTC,"sigh. At work and on mobile, it won't be as in depth as I'd like. But let's begin.  Chrom  Chrom is the the second best unit in Awakening. He is an undeniably top tier unit. What makes Chrom such a valuable unit, however, is not simply raw combat prowess like other high tier lords such as RD Ike and Sigurd. Chrom earns his position through a combination of good combat and sheer utility.  Chrom enjoys the usual perks of a lord, including perfect availability and not competing for deployment, but he also brings a significant combative presence (his bases/growths combination are amongst the highest in the Shepherds) and valuable class skills that only he has access to. Let's run through his base skill:  dual strike+. Dual strikes are very important in Awakening Lunatic, as enemies have incredibly high HP counts that makes 2HKOing naturally very rare. This is even more prevalent early on when your units are less powerful. Chrom's dual strike+ is a flat +10% increase to dual rates regardless of support rank. This indirectly makes a Chrom pair one of your most consistent source of damage dealing units. Chrom can likely S support someone before the mid game, leaving you with a pair that has approx 70% dual strikes. That's nuts.  Next, his pair up bonuses. Chrom's bonuses are odd, giving very high speed/luck(3/3). But on Lunatic, this is important since doubling thresholds are actually fairly high before you have access to high support Ranks and speed tonics. Likewise, Chrom's speed bonus has some utility early on, like stopping Stahl and Vaike from being doubled by C2 Mercs. It also lets Robin secure kills much easier by doubling significantly earlier. What people don't really credit Chrom for is his role in L+ clears. For what it's worth, Chrom is very involved in the snowballing of the game's best units (Robin and Sumia).  Something that really separates Chrom from other lords is incentive. There are reasons to actually use him. He starts with two effective prf weapons. The first being an infinite use wyrmslayer and you are attacked by bulky, relatively fast Wyvern riders as early as chapter 5 (compare to NM Marth, who is nowhere near as useful as a Hunter against his early Wyverns). These Wyverns make a return in chapters 7, 9, and 10 so Chrom remains consistently useful throughout the first arc. In fact, these enemies are where Chrom gets most of his experience. The game simultaneously creates incentive to use Chrom and that incentive doubles as a method to train him. He's more or less guaranteed to turn out well for his investment, with his 60% Str/Skl/Spd growths. His other weapon is a Rapier, which has all the usual goodness. The Rapier can see use as early as C3 when you are confronted with incredibly bulky Knights (35 HP/11 Defense) that only Robin, Fred and Miriel have a real chance of hurting otherwise. Raimi herself is also hard to take out (42 HP/12 Def), so he can help out handily. Cavaliers don't really show up until the second arc, where Chrom once again shines with his Rapier. Training Chrom also results in a stronger Lucina as well, and the only thing better than 1 Chrom is 2 Chroms. Training Chrom is incentivized and greatly rewarded, as Exalted Falchion is one of the easiest ways to take down Grima, having a staggering 45 Mt against him.  Moving forward, Chrom also has convoy access. This is great for both him and whoever he is supporting. Players will likely place varying degrees of importance on it, but the ability to grant a unit near infinite item slots is undeniably good. This is a trend that seems to have started with Marth.  I don't think it would be appropriate to include post game min maxing here, as not everyone is familiar with it, but it's worth noting that Chrom is very strong here as well, with dual strike+ allowing for consistent dual strike and the ever so vital archer tree.  Chrom is everything a lord should be. A strong unit who has incentive for use beyond his combative capabilities while simultaneously rewarding you for it 2 times over."
fireemblem,3drke8,cargup,4,Sat Jul 18 23:37:46 2015 UTC,"Chrom is the Wyvern-eater. I'd say you covered everything.   What people don't really credit Chrom or is his role in L+ clears.    I don't know the finer points of L+ and I'm not that great at it...certainly not as good as the pros that have figured out consistent strats. But this statement is entirely true from my experience. I think some early maps would have been borderline unplayable (thinking Ch. 5, 6, and 7, but even earlier too) without Chrom's dependable Dual Strikes, particularly the wyvern-killing variety.  I rate the guy so highly not even for his eventual combat prowess (you can get Virion to godmode with investment), but his early and continued utility. Early +3 Spd, convoy in his pocket, and reliable Dual Strikes with broad weakness coverage are just too good. If he wasn't pulling his weight early on, I'd possibly even rank Frederick higher...at the very least, the subject would be more debatable. But Chrom has the better end, comes with a strong kid, and is practically necessary for anti-frustration Grima killing (or Lucy, whose stats are connected to Chrom's).  Convoy access is great for other units and also for him. He'll never want for a weapon or item. If you need to break out the Mercurius kill button for a bulky, dangerous enemy, Chrom's got it in his backpack. Very good lord on utility alone...took me a long time to realize that."
fireemblem,3drke8,Ownagepuffs,4,Sun Jul 19 00:45:24 2015 UTC,"I really wanted to break out some numbers so people really get a feel of how important Chrom's role is in the game, but it's good to know that I covered everything.   Very good lord on utility alone...took me a long time to realize that.   Same here, actually. It wasn't until I really took on Lunatic mode for my first time did I see everything Chrom has to offer. It's incredible that the only stopping him from being the best unit in the game is Robin's existence, but he still has a major impact on the optimal playstyle on Awakening. He does it not through sheer combat, but by just being really damn useful."
fireemblem,3drke8,ShroudedInMyth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:35:35 2015 UTC,He makes the water trick possible and water walk has uses in Chapter 2. Doesn't pairing him up with Fredrick make him double some of the enemies of the early game?
fireemblem,3drke8,Ownagepuffs,2,Sun Jul 19 01:21:36 2015 UTC,"Fred's base speed + C Chrom would put him at 14, which gets early game Fighters and dark Mages. Ephraim's Lance would put him at 16 for Barbarians and Wyverns. There's also Sumia for that too."
fireemblem,3drke8,EineKleineNachmusik,6,Sun Jul 19 01:50:07 2015 UTC,"Before writing this, I had trouble spelling Micaiah’s name fully.  -Preface  Micaiah, the Priestess of Dawn, Leader of the Dawn Brigade and the lord of Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn (FE10 as I will be referring it to as.) Some people praise Micaiah as one of the best mages in FE10, while others bash her for her poor speed and being somewhat of a “Mary-Sue”. Don’t worry, I won’t be covering the latter in this editorial, but divulging into the former. Let’s begin!  -Micaiah Early Game-  An important part of any character is how they start out in a vanilla FE run. Micaiah starts out as a decent mage with affinity Dark Magic and holding a Light Tome. Micaiah’s bases are as follows...  (HP, Str, Mag, Skl, Spd, Lck, Def, Res, Con, Wt, Mov)  15, 2, 7, 8, 7, 10, 2, 4, 5, 5, 5  Firstly, notice Micaiah’s base 2 defense. Def is pretty important in FE10, especially when --every-- many early game enemy units are physical attackers. That said, Micaiah starts out with a good base Magic, a Metric ton of Luck, and a good Speed base, which will soon change. Micaiah is overall a good pick   -Stat Growths  (HP, Str, Mag, Skl, Spd, Lck, Def, Res)  40%, 15%, 80%, 40%, 35%, 80%, 20%, 90%  Micaiah has superior Magic, Luck and Res; this is the bread and butter of Micaiah. Other things to note are Micaiah’s poor speed growth. Especially for being a mage, this growth is terrible! Gosh, even Dorcas could challenge  Micaiah to a race and win. Fun Fact: Micaiah has the 2nd highest Res growth of any character in the series, only being topped by Karel’s 100% Res growth. Frankly Micaiah’s defense and strength aren’t going anywhere.  -Extra Things  Micaiah starts out in the  beginning of the game with an A-Support already unlocked with Sothe. This is a nice bonus, as you’re pretty much Sothe-locked for the beginning of the game, but Sothe’s a thief Jeigen, so you won’t get much use out of this support bonus through to the endgame. Another thing Micaiah CAN do, but I would strongly advise against is Sacrifice. What this does is bring Micaiah down to one HP in exchange for fully healing another unit. Micaia already has a pretty lackluster defense stat, so you really don’t want to give her any more opportunity to be killed. Almost every unit starts out with vulneraries, so you needn’t worry about healing early game. Biorhythm is something I almost never bother with, but it goes through a pretty normal upswing-downswing (I have little knowledge on biorhythm, sorry).    The Best Lord?   Not compared to Sigurd or Ephriam, but Micaiah is definitely up there; especially compared to weaker lords (looking at you Leif or Roy). While she can’t double to save her life, Micaiah is still a magic unit, meaning 1-2 range and good Mag/Res. Imo, Micaiah can be compared to Celica rather well, because of tome use and being a stand out unit in a sea of mediocrity. Micaiah is a good RD unit, and a good unit in general  Thank you for reading and have a nice night!  At the end of this, I legit have no problems spelling Micaiah’s name."

fireemblem,3drke8,Ownagepuffs,3,Sun Jul 19 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I was hoping you would touch on how she manages to be useful with 0 investment thanks to auto double promotion and C staves upon first promotion. Even if she doesn't do much fighting, she's has basically cost free utility that actually blends well with her lord perks. Thani potshots are cool, and auto A with Sothe is extremely useful. I like Miccy as a unit, and she's definitely better than she's given credit for."
fireemblem,3drke8,Model_Omega,3,Sun Jul 19 03:02:58 2015 UTC,"Sacrifice does have a few uses beyond what appears...  1)- It's free EXP, sacrifice to heal someone and then have Laura patch Miccy right back up, every little bit helps  2)- It heals statuses, which admittedly can only really be used in 1-8 and 4-F-1, but it is really useful for that latter one if you fall victim to Lekain's Silence Bomb, since it doesn't stop Miccy from being able to sacrifice.  But yeah, as healing goes it loses pretty much all meaning after part 1 since she has actual staffs now, but as noted by others it does allow her to more easily abuse Wrath and Resolve, however much that may or may not help."
fireemblem,3drke8,RedWolke,10,Sun Jul 19 06:08:21 2015 UTC,"So, /u/Eastern-Eagle was not able to post it by himself since he is travelling, but he did ask me to post it for him. Anyway, here it is.  Sigurd Baldos Chalphy  When discussing Sigurd's capabilities in the first generation of Genealogy of the Holy War, it is important to quickly get a few key facts out of the way. Sigurd's performance is, for lack of a better term, incredible. He is often considered by a very large portion of the community to be not only the strongest lord, but one of the strongest playable units in the entire series, so much that it's almost taken as a well-established fact. It is very difficult to argue against this, Sigurd has a long list of assets, only matched in opposite measure by the minuscule list of his flaws.  Sigurd has perfect availability, a leadership bonus, excellent base parameters, and fantastic growths. He has high weapons ranks of A swords and B lances right at the start, there is a high ranked silver sword that he acquires in the prologue, he acquires the holy blade Tyrfing early in chapter 5, and he is a mounted prepromote in FE4, which gives him canto and nine movement without affecting his EXP gain. His weaknesses after that massive and skimmed list are few; he is weak to horse-slayers, and his 1-2 range options are limited to javelins and magic swords – which is still more than some have.  So, Sigurd is extremely powerful, and it's not a stretch in any measure to call him the strongest of the lords. Unlike most lords, Sigurd does not have a meaningful list of negatives, at all. These characteristics might have led to him being an entirely boring lord for make use of, but thanks to proper design, Sigurd remains extremely powerful without compromising the gameplay integrity. Despite being the strongest character in his campaign, Sigurd still heavily appreciates the aid of his fellow teammates.  The maps in Genealogy are the largest in the series, often involving numerous objectives and goals that Sigurd simply cannot accomplish entirely on his own. If Sigurd wants to reach every village, obtain the best items, and in general make his way through the game efficiently, he will not be doing it alone. The game heavily encourages players to make use of a full team for its maps, and it does so in several ways. For one, there is no deployment limit, every character can be deployed into the map without any cost, and there is little reason not to do so. The arenas present at the start of every chapter also provide an easy method of giving all members of the team experience, further encouraging their use.  Genealogy is a player phase heavy game, and Sigurd alone cannot efficiently complete the game, often due to the number and magnitude of enemies. In chapter 2 for example, the abundance of armor knights and the massive swarms of enemies throughout are extremely difficult for Sigurd to get through on his own, especially given how a strong and mobile boss towards the end utilizes a horseslayer against him. There are also side objectives present in every map in one form or another, such as out of the way villages or fleeing villagers, which are near impossible for Sigurd to entirely save without relying on other team members.  There are also no forms of either vulneraries or elixirs in the game for self-healing. The only methods of healing are to either visit an out-of-the-way church, slowing down progress, to use the renewal ring, which is dropped in late chapter 3, or to rely on a healer, which is better than both other options. Even traversing the maps is something Sigurd appreciates aid from despite his high movement, as the large maps often require a significant amount of backtracking that can be circumvented entirely with the return and warp staves, acquired in early chapter 1.  Sigurd is a very unusual lord, rather than being a burden that the player must take great care of, he is instead a heavily impressive unit that the player will instead gladly include in their strategies, without compromising the use of the rest of the team. As should be the case for any good lord, strategies for his campaign are focused around the use of him, he is a genuinely important unit on the board, but the game still encourages players to make smart use of other units, and is designed and balanced around this.  Sigurd is an interesting and unique take on the usual lord formula; he is a lord that most players will make use of not because they are begrudgingly forced to, but because he is powerful and vital to use as well - which serves a side purpose of making his inevitable fate all the more tragic. Alas, such is a topic for another time.  Thank y'all for reading, I am open to any and all criticism and critique. As is often the case with me, if I have forgotten or excluded anything worth mentioning, feel free to remind me of it."

Not every unit consistently doubles in Gen 1, and the ones that do don't have a lot of attacking power or are on foot. There's Sigurd and Brave!Finn/Fury/Quan of course but not too many other beyond them. Enemies also do have high HP counts. There's also including that enemies don't even attack units who are bulky or units who have too high evade as well. Ranked FE4 is certainly player phase."

He can net a few good early kills due to a nice speed stat and rapier access, but he can rarely do something Caeda can't do, he gets 10 levels less than everyone else, and his bases and growths are overall incredibly mediocre. He would be an early Gaiden sacrifice if he wasn't the lord, but he is. I remember taking to feplus about Roy, and I realized what he was saying was right. In our talk, he spoke of Roy being the focal point of your strategy, with you attempting to get him to the thone to seize before he is slaughtered by wyvern reinforcements. I'm about to replay SD with this mindset, but I think I'll like it a ton more. The overall strategy in the game isn't to lug along some useless swordlock, but to slingshot your weak leader to victory. Heck, he eventually picks up later, with the Shield of Seals and the Falchion, just lile to Roy with the Sword of Seals. Overall, I think that the more Enemy Phase focus of the game is actually a good thing with him, as it creates fun opportunities for a combination of defense if Marth and offense against the enemies."

fireemblem,3drke8,virtu333,11,Sun Jul 19 15:19:35 2015 UTC,"PATH OF RADIANCE - IKE  I'm out of the house currently, and only have access to my phone. I will get my post uploaded ASAP.  My apologies.  I'm going to do what I can right now from my phone since it could end up being awhile. Please let me know of any spelling mistakes so I can fix them.  Thanks for your patince and on to the main post.  Ike in path of radiance is a relatively normal case as far as FE lords go. He starts off weak, is sword locked, and is a generally good overall unit. However what makes a case for the best lord unit is a few key points.  Ike as a unit  While not Sigurd in terms of strength, Ike is strong enough to hold is own throughout his entire game at any difficulty. While not necessary to use Ike has good bases and growths that allow him to double early, and grow into a competent unit by the time his promotion comes around at chapter 17.  Ragnell and Aether  Ike's preferential late game weapon, and personal skill give him (in my opinion) unmatched utility in the late game. While the other games do give their lords late game holy weapons, Ike is one of the few (and I am fairly sure only) one that is both unlimited use, and one to two range. He also is the only lord along with Chrom and Lucina that has acses to Ather, witch is much better in PoR due to it's easier difficulty, that allows The Lord to become a great damadge soak. This to not also mention the resolve wrath Ike that can make him a powerhouse.  Main flaws as a unit  Ike is sadly in a horse emblem, so while he is necessary for many objectives it is easy to ferry him around and just stomp the game with characters like Oscar, Titania, Marcia, Jill, Kirean ECT. However the pair of boots you find can mend his movement issues and Ragnell does help with his range issues in the extreme late game.  BEXP  Unlike any other lord Ike (except Miciah) has a free reasource to increase his level almost immediately. While it can be served just as well used on other units, there is no denying that Ike can reach 20/20 faster than any lord due to the ease of use of BEXP.  Thanks for reading and I am very sorry for any mistakes. I'm still out of my house at the moment so it will mos. likely be awhile before I can reply to any responses.   Happy debating!"
fireemblem,3drke8,SabinSuplexington,3,Sat Jul 18 20:32:19 2015 UTC,"I think the issue with PoR Ike is he's overshadowed by your badass mount units until you can get wrath and resolve on him and have him. He's on foot, no canto, sword locked, late promotion, etc.  RD is more impressive in my mind actually. Besides Haar, he's one of the best you got and you need him more despite being a foot sword."
fireemblem,3drke8,SabinSuplexington,5,Sun Jul 19 15:21:51 2015 UTC,"HOLMES  So for those who don't know about TRS(most of you), Holmes is the Ephraim to Runan's Eirika. That is, if Ephraim was a lazy asshole who didn't actually care about the whole war going on. Holmes's journey starts when Runan liberates Welit and Holmes decides to beat the shit out of pirates in the area and get treasure to help Runan out. Whenever they meet up, Holmes and Runan can trade units and Holmes can donate his higher total of money to Runan's war. Holmes's laid back nature also plays into his progression. Runan goes stage to stage but Holmes has an FE8 style map progression where he can grind.  For actual unit gameplay, Holmes's lax nature results in him being an Archer with lockpick skills. He is a lot stronger than Runan but his laziness prevents him from being the actual leader. Bows are pretty great in TRS due to maps having many narrow paths in Holmes's battles and bows such as the Repeater(a double Brave) existing. TRS also has many bosses which Holmes's longbow can safely destroy, which helps avoid a lot of dangerous counterattacks. However, lategame enemies are numerous in Holmes's path and being bowlocked starts to make him worse. After saving his dad(not because he wanted to but rather because he was on the way), Holmes is forced to promote and get his act together, gaining sword access. With his new motivation and sword access, Holmes faces tough maps and loses grind access. Thankfully, he finds a personal sword along the way and is able to use high level swords thanks to weapon rank being one stat. Eventually, he teams with Runan to kill the obligatory Dark Dragon along with two other people that Kaga had no time to develop as MCs. The translation is still iffy for TRS so I can't go into character detail but Holmes is a cool guy and good archer.  that's about it"

Marcus is just special because he's got 8 move, high bases that can carry him at least to the end of mid-game, full weapon triangle control, and canto. And he shows up in chapter 12.  The consequences for using Marcus/other pre-promotes really only shows up when you're gunning for S-rank: pre-promotes hurt your exp rank. And overuse of them at the expense of some of your other units means having a weaker team overall since some of your unpromoted units wind up being some of your best (Florina, Kent and Sain)."

But I think that making Eliwood a lance lord would've added a nice symmetry to the lordly triad thing they had going on, as well as making Eliwood a bit more unique.  I would also be giving him a ranged option earlier on and thus adding to his utility."
fireemblem,3dr7yd,KingsBlade,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:03:29 2015 UTC,"I knew I must've forgotten something. Lance Eliwood would be amazing, he even has S Lances in FE6 Trial Maps. Like a slightly worse Ephraim, but with better availability.  Also, we seem to agree on a lot of things, on a different note. Just thought I'd point that out, seeing as I'd mentioned it."
fireemblem,3dr7yd,FireSpyke,2,Sat Jul 18 19:17:39 2015 UTC,"I felt that arenas were much too hard and risky, it always gave you bad pair ups and the enemy had better levels/weapons. I avoided the arenas entirely.   I think there also should have been less enemies using long ranged spells like bolting, or gave you more of them in order to counter them."
fireemblem,3dr7yd,KingsBlade,5,Sat Jul 18 18:06:39 2015 UTC,"Arena's being too hard isn't really a bad thing in my opinion. Even with the risk, they're still a pretty easy way to get tons of exp and money. I found them pretty reliable even without save states.  I don't think siege magic was really that frequent either, although it can be frustrating. Definitely toned down from Binding Blade though where siege magic and status staves were abundant."
fireemblem,3dr7yd,Pwntagonist,2,Sat Jul 18 18:12:44 2015 UTC,"That's funny. Every time I went in arenas, my characters ended up dying. I ended up just avoiding them."

fireemblem,3dr7yd,KingsBlade,3,Sat Jul 18 18:16:06 2015 UTC,Did you judge the fight based on the cost? You can keep declining fights until they offer one around 700ish gold. Those fights are typically much easier than the ones at 800+ gold.
fireemblem,3dr7yd,Spammalanche,2,Sat Jul 18 18:17:46 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't know that."
fireemblem,3dr7yd,NerfUrgot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:18:52 2015 UTC,You can also press B to back out of the arena fight if things don't look like they're going to go your way. I can't think of a moment in all my playthroughs where I couldn't immediately tell whether I would win or lose right at the start of the arena fight.
fireemblem,3dr7yd,Spammalanche,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"That´s kinda the point though, the game is already balanced to be beaten without any need for using the arena, and using it too much can easily break the difficulty curve. If you are adding a feature that can easily break the game, at least put a little risk on it."
fireemblem,3dr7yd,Finalinsanity,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:41:47 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in this thread because outside of changing supports to be like PoR, and maybe some re-balancing to make it riskier to use mounted units and fliers (add in more horseslayers and make archers better), I can't really think of anything I would change in FE7. Give it the new 3DS menu interface maybe? Throw in some skill scrolls from FE9, and maybe figure out how to make knights good (thinking making them uncrittable or undoubleable or make it so that if a unit moves adjacent to a knight they HAVE to stop their movement for that turn).  Call it nostalgia, but I think it's one of the best designed games in the series from a map design and difficulty perspective."
fireemblem,3dr7yd,themythicalcheese,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"This is an idea that just sprang to mind;  An alternative first ten chapters instead of Lyn Mode when you directly select Eliwood or Hector's story.  Lyn Mode, even on Hard, is kinda boring. It's not actually that difficult, and there's no real reason besides ""it's kinda boring"" not to play it since you get the chance to train up units that you'll have access to later (and I don't remember if you can even get Nini's Grace without going through Lyn Mode).  Perhaps, if selecting Eliwood or Hector's mode directly, you could have an alternate set of ""prologue"" chapters that let you train up a different set of units compared to Lyn Mode (and maybe make Lyn Hard more... interesting, I guess). This means which Lord you start with actually affects the game in a somewhat more meaningful long-term way, rather than just ""well do i want to get better stats or jump straight to the action?""  Making those ""prologue"" chapters actually interesting would be a necessity, otherwise it'd just be ""well, which Lord do I want to take through ten now-boring tutorial chapters since i already know how to play the game?""  Hell, since we're going in that direction, why not make Lyn Mode actually focus on Lyn post-tutorial, at least to the degree Hector Mode focuses on Hector? (first playthroughs can choose which Lord to focus on, though if we're keeping Hector-Mode exclusive content maybe just let you choose between Lyn or Eliwood being your main Lord. Hell, let's just add exclusive chapters for all the modes, more replayability!)"

I like Runescape, I don't play it very actively but I log in every day to do a few things and when I'm really feeling it I even train a bit. Slowly I'm approaching max cape, getting 99 crafting soon. Think I'm 250...2? 2502 total. Something like that anyway.   I've sunk countless hours into it over the years.  I play League of Legends a fair bit as well. I got rank 5 Yi awhile ago, that was fun. I kind of want to get 100K points with him but the friend I usually play with hasn't played much lately. I played ranked and peaked at around gold I but eh. It's too aggressive an environment, I like to be a filthy casual instead.  Then it's mostly just really secondary stuff that I only occasionally play, some minecraft, some pokemon, some Shovel Knight,  OH, I play Hearthstone a lot. I always make sure my quests are done, been stocking up gold for that next expansion. I'm not all too great but I have lots of fun with it. It's nice to build decks and try crazy stuff, other card games aren't really ""too expensive"" as much as they are needlessly expensive, and more importantly it's a lot harder to find someone to play with in stuff like MTG. When I was much younger my oldest brother really kept together the MTG scene in our town but eventually he moved away and then suddenly one of our card stores went out of business and MTG just wasn't all that popular anymore.  Anyway, yeah, some LoZ, I played that . . . Stormforge? I think it is? But I just couldn't get into it, for whatever reason. It was really cool, I liked it, I just couldn't stick with it.  I've also dumped like 110 hours into For Glory on Smash4DS, 40%ish of my time with Ike and Marth, like 40% each. Really enjoy that. I'm pretty garbage with my 45%ish win rate in 1v1 but eh, I never leave when someone keeps beating me whereas other people all too often run off once they've lost even twice in a row . . .  So I feel like it's quite deflated. All the same I am trash, just might not be as trash as my win rate lets on. Don't even know why I'm getting so defensive about it. . ."

Most flash carts are from china, so they take a while to ship. My EZ flash 4 took 2 and a half weeks, but it was worth the wait and the money."

fireemblem,3drqth,daisysaur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:44:00 2015 UTC,I've really been getting into JRPGs. At first I bought Earthbound on the Wii U VC and thought it was fun so I bought Chrono Trigger on the DS because the active battle system seemed interesting. I'm still playing the game but so far I absolutely LOVE it. The characters are simple but are pretty interesting and the story feels pretty unique. Now I'm wondering if I should buy TWEWY or Radiant Historia as those two seem like other popular JRPGs.   I also play an unhealthy amount of Smash with and without my friends. I think that if I buy a PS4 I'll try to get into Street Fighter.
fireemblem,3drqth,AngryCthulhu,6,Sat Jul 18 20:46:46 2015 UTC,"TWEWY and Radiant Historia are both really good. You won't go wrong with either of them, but I'd recommend TWEWY because it has a lot of unique aspects (setting, combat system) and some cool music."

But I'm sure you can get into a groove with some practice and it's pretty worth it to play a game that takes relatively good advantage of both the touch- and dual-screen.  Even if you find it a bit difficult, the game will automate the top screen so you can focus on the bottom.  Unless you're playing the iOS/Android version, in which you only have one screen period."

fireemblem,3drqth,WhatZitTooyah,2,Sun Jul 19 00:15:39 2015 UTC,"My first was 9 when I was 9 years old (I was terrible at it btw) so I think It's a decent place to start. It's a very standard RPG with a nice (though simple) storyline and colourful characters. There are some touching moments and the battle/vocation system is flawless. Nothing groundbreaking, and it's on the original DS so it has pretty bad graphics. Play the multiplayer as much as you can, it's very fun. It has some awesome music-go listen to the Observatory theme orchestrated and you'll see what I mean.  However, a lot of fans (including me) think 8 is the best game in the series, and it's getting a rerelease so it's very easy to access. Plus it's not very difficult if you know what your doing. It's up to you which you start with, but I think those are the best options. I hope you enjoy! :)"
