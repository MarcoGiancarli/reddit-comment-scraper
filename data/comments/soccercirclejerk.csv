I have watched the guy rise from the defeats of the World Cup 2006, European Cup 2008 and another World Cup 2010.   I've sene him at his lowest points, when he was absolutely crushed after missing a penalty on home turf in a Champions League final. I've seen him winning the trebel afterwards. Then he went on to win the World Cup in 2014 - after playing a game of a lifetime, where he gave absolutely everything.  It feels like a part of my life left. It's the end of an era - not only his at Bayern, but also the end of an era for me.  Edit: But still, if this is true - which I think it is, because BILD usually is a good source when it comes to Bayern - I wish him the best. He will always be the face of Bayern.

Location: Stadio Appartamento di Sterling  Sneeze Speed: 5 m/s  Temperature and Humidity:   35°C & 90% under Sterling's bed sheets  Previous days form:  Raheem: Healthy, Healthy, Moody, Ill, Ill  Cold: Dormant, Runny Nose, Infectious, Fatigue, Cough symptoms.  Incubation Times: 24-48 hours peak symptoms BST.  Referee: Dr. Zafar Iqbal [Pakistan]  Fairly decent referee but has been controversial in the past including the recent decision to prescribe a course of antibiotics for an illness that was questionable and was only thought to merit a 20p pack of paracetamol from Boots.  The average length of a cold is about 7 days but symptoms peak after 2 - 4 days so we might have extra time here at the Stadio Appartamento di Sterling.  Kick off:  Wednesday' Ooh and early on Wednesday Sterling has missed a clear chance at training, he might regret that later.  Wednesday' Sterling's coming off here, he'll have to be seen by the team doctor as is standard for all players who have risk to their health, it'll be interesting to see what he prescribes for this.  Wednesday' The common cold is really pushing hard here, almost 16 hours since first exposure and Raheem is looking visibly shaky.  Thursday' Oh dear Clive, Raheem's missed another sitter of a chance and goes 2 days clear without training. He can't keep missing chances like that.  Thursday' Almost 48 hours now the common cold has been pushing and it seems they've broken through the defence, Sterlings back four of White Blood Cell, White Blood Cell, White Blood Cell and Glen Johnson have looked shaky from the onset.  Thursday' Fatigue really setting in for Sterling now and he can't get the cold out of his box as it refuses to clear.  Friday' Only two days left to go until the elusive place on the East Asia Tour could be lost for Sterling. This could be some of the most persistent attacking we've seen here from the common cold and it'll be interesting to see if Sterling can finally make it to training.  Friday' Steven Gerrard has lashed out at Sterling from the sidelines, surely a bookable offence.  Friday' News is coming in from the other semi-final 'Balotelli v Grief over death of adoptive father' and word is that Balotelli has won that and is back in training today. Simply amazing Clive, Balotelli has stolen that East Asia Tour spot from right under Sterling. We all thought that Grief over death of adoptive father were one of the toughest teams out there and that Sterling certainly got the lucky draw with common cold but that just goes to show that Balotelli is really determined to work for his place on this illustrious tour. Sterling is going home.  Full Time: Common Cold 1 - 0 Raheem Sterling  Balotelli goes through on penalties to the East Asia Liverpool Tour."

Incubation Times: 24-48 hours peak symptoms BST.  Referee: Dr. Zafar Iqbal [Pakistan]  Fairly decent referee but has been controversial in the past including the recent decision to prescribe a course of antibiotics for an illness that was questionable and was only thought to merit a 20p pack of paracetamol from Boots.  The average length of a cold is about 7 days but symptoms peak after 2 - 4 days so we might have extra time here at the Stadio Appartamento di Sterling.  Kick off:  Wednesday' Ooh and early on Wednesday Sterling has missed a clear chance at training, he might regret that later.  Wednesday' Sterling's coming off here, he'll have to be seen by the team doctor as is standard for all players who have risk to their health, it'll be interesting to see what he prescribes for this.  Wednesday' The common cold is really pushing hard here, almost 16 hours since first exposure and Raheem is looking visibly shaky.  Thursday' Oh dear Clive, Raheem's missed another sitter of a chance and goes 2 days clear without training. He can't keep missing chances like that.  Thursday' Almost 48 hours now the common cold has been pushing and it seems they've broken through the defence, Sterlings back four of White Blood Cell, White Blood Cell, White Blood Cell and Glen Johnson have looked shaky from the onset.  Thursday' Fatigue really setting in for Sterling now and he can't get the cold out of his box as it refuses to clear.  Friday' Only two days left to go until the elusive place on the East Asia Tour could be lost for Sterling. This could be some of the most persistent attacking we've seen here from the common cold and it'll be interesting to see if Sterling can finally make it to training.  Friday' Steven Gerrard has lashed out at Sterling from the sidelines, surely a bookable offence.  Friday' News is coming in from the other semi-final 'Balotelli v Grief over death of adoptive father' and word is that Balotelli has won that and is back in training today. Simply amazing Clive, Balotelli has stolen that East Asia Tour spot from right under Sterling. We all thought that Grief over death of adoptive father were one of the toughest teams out there and that Sterling certainly got the lucky draw with common cold but that just goes to show that Balotelli is really determined to work for his place on this illustrious tour. Sterling is going home.  Full Time: Common Cold 1 - 0 Raheem Sterling  Balotelli goes through on penalties to the East Asia Liverpool Tour."

soccercirclejerk,3cj92k,Pogrebnyak,46,Wed Jul 8 09:59:36 2015 UTC,"Actually I think you'll find that Arsenal are in a perfect place to probably win the league title, the Champions League and retain the FA Cup. Why? Because we have the best defence in the league. Yes, it wasn't actually the best in the league last season but that's because the best centre back in the league, a certain Mr Bosscielny, was injured. And we've also signed the undoubted best goalkeeper in the league, Petr Cech. I cannot believe that Classlessinho sold him to us! Furthermore, we also have the best defensive midfielder in the league in wee little Franny Coquelin. Name a better winger than Alexis Sanchez? You can't. Name a better attacking midfielder than Mesut Ozil? You can't. Name a better player called Olivier Giroud than Olivier Giroud? You can't.  Everything is coming up Arsenal boys.   That being said, your post did not mention Mesut Ozil at any point so I am afraid that I am going to have to downvote you."
soccercirclejerk,3cj92k,5CapsAreShit,25,Wed Jul 8 10:54:50 2015 UTC,"Well r/soccer is just a karma race. It's a bunch of guys just patting each other on the back and complimenting each other and their rival clubs all day long. Anything remotely critical gets downvoted. Second, I don't think there's much actual knowledge about the game there. I mean, I remember one instance where there was a gif of someone scooping the ball over another players head and the title was something ridiculous like ""SILKY SMOOTH INCREDIBLE AMAZING SKILLZ"" and it sat at the top of the sub for the entire day with at least 1,000 upvotes. The people there are impressed by literally anything.  Notice how nothing from ZonalMarking.net has ever been posted to r/soccer. You think that's a coincidence? It's not. r/soccer hasn't a clue about formations, player movement, etc. It's all surface level ""analysis"" and TMZ-esque related news. It's a terrible sub. I've learned not to post there much. It's good for goal gifs but even now everyone just ""credits to OMAR!"" so they can get even more karma. I fucking hate it so much."
soccercirclejerk,3cj92k,imperat0r_,8,Wed Jul 8 13:18:02 2015 UTC,"It's all surface level ""analysis""   the ""details make the difference: suarez didn't just stop moving"" thread was about the deepest ""analysis"" i've ever seen on there."
soccercirclejerk,3cj92k,bgp1845,7,Wed Jul 8 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. That clip definitely highlighted Suarez's good instincts and understanding of Messi's play to go so far wide anticipating a shot across goal. But that is something they teach at a very young age. Why would you run towards your teammate who is holding the ball and potentially bring over another defender with you to crowd him out of space?  Movement off the ball is obviously important for strikers, but the way they reacted to that over there was hilarious.  The Gary Neville analysis videos also tend to draw a great amount of attention."

He'd also obviously lead the league in assists due to his vision which on a pitch 12 times the size of a basketball court would only be better in the NBA, and probably the best dribbler as well (with a rating of ~96 on EA's NBA), partially credited to his physique (overall balance of ~99 and acceleration of ~94-95), which like we said before, would help him excel above the rest."

soccercirclejerk,3c3mjf,LIGHTCATTY,8,Sat Jul 4 13:13:00 2015 UTC,"Trapp is an extremely average Bundesliga keeper, whose mediocrity is overshadowed by the occasional spectacular save, or to put it more succinctly: he's the prototypical Ehrmann apprentice. And he definitely isn't underrated. In fact I'd argue that he is ridiculously overrated, at least by the Bundesliga fraction of /r/soccer. Case in point  ""I think he is a fantastic goalkeeper, maybe currently #4 in Germany. ""  If by ""in Germany"" you mean keepers of German descent then Neuer, Ter Stegen, Leno, Adler, Fährmann, Zieler, and arguably Horn (due to talent) and Weidenfeller (due to experience and the, admittedly, bold assumption that his, at times abysmal, form last season was just a fluke) are all better than him. If you mean keepers currently playing in Germany, then I'd take back Ter Stegen and add Sommer, Bürki and Benaglio to that list. Either way he is definitely not #4 in Germany.  ""Curious to see him play for a top club.""  Well if that's the case, then this transfer is going to disappoint you, because in my opinion there's is just no way he'll displace Sirigu, who's a much better all around keeper than him, unless you meant the occasional cup appearance (which is definitely a waste of his talents but in the end it's just another sign of the growing financial chasm between the rich clubs and the rest)."

FIFA, please wire 5 million dineros into my ""football development account"", and I won't make a stink about this atrocious officiating."
