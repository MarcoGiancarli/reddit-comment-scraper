Our society is economically limited at the moment and a lot of people fall out the bottom right now.   We house 100 people and the next day 100 more fall out of housing due to lack of work, rising rental prices or other social landmines."
SanJose,3e3cxw,NoseDragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"The city needs to build a cheap apartment building and actually solve the problem    I agree, but here comes the sting though... How can the city compete with HUD based loans?  A hud based loan says you only have to keep a ""Low income reserve"" for a certain time period.  Like many other things passed through by the city, this is one of those situations where they're making the motions, but not really gaining any ground.  I think if given a choice between HUD funding for a set time, or the cities funding for ""perpetual low income"" the choice becomes clear really fast.  The bottom line of why housing has gone up boils down to stagnated wages, increased cost of living (including taxes) If we can treat those two issues, the housing issue will take care of itself.   I make the same money my dad did in 1984, but his costs of living and taxes were about 1/6th of what mine are today.  TL:DR things costs more, so landlords charge more.  Increase wages, reduce taxes, prices go down."

If the city isn't going to do anything to help these people, they can at least stop taking steps to make their lives more miserable. Kicking them out of one area is only going to make them all move to new areas."

The interesting thing is that, the one located on Meridian & Hamilton has a Hexagonal shaped sign, and the 4n20 on Laurel Canyon also has a hexagonal sign as well!  http://fourn20pies.com/assets/images/SC-EXT.jpg  That's probably the first owner...

The pies were pretty good too..  I think I liked them better than Marie Callendar's.  Drive through anything would do good around here now.. back then people still walked into places!"

SanJose,3e49gk,SlumberMachine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:03:08 2015 UTC,If anything I'd think this morning's would have released some tension in the fault making it less likely to happen sooner than later. I'm no geologist though.
SanJose,3e49gk,adfoe,2,Tue Jul 21 21:05:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert either, but I read this morning that larger quakes are sometimes preceded by smaller quakes, because the smaller quake shifts the fault into a more ""slippery"" position that enables a fuller release of tension."

SanJose,3e1mz7,robert_cortese,3,Tue Jul 21 07:03:17 2015 UTC,"I think its hard for the city to approve something that per the report ""Both the Fire Department and the Police Department continue to support a ban on fireworks, with the exception of controlled and permitted public fireworks displays"""
SanJose,3e1mz7,sj_poly,0,Tue Jul 21 16:19:27 2015 UTC,"It's just the leaders doing a little chest pounding.  This is just anecdotal based from talking to the rank and file myself.    I think rank and file feels like this could benefit non-profit police programs like PAL.  This year at my neighborhoods own show, we had 2 cruisers pull up, park, and watch.  Nobody got a citation."
SanJose,3e1mz7,darkescaflowne,3,Tue Jul 21 21:09:26 2015 UTC,"A comment to start things off.  Please don't downvote if you disagree, or downvote because you hate fireworks.  The cities own study validates what I've been saying all along.  We are giving up an awful lot of money that could be going to our local non-profits.   $3 Million dollars.  The homeless problem could be solved and funded into the foreseeable future by a repeal of the ban.   That Softball team in ESSJ that just had it's equipment shack burned, would not have to worry.  My biggest issue with this that isn't mentioned in the report, is when the ban was enacted San Jose promised to continue funding these non-profits in lieu of the ban.  Since our financial crisis (building city hall) there are 100's of non-profits that have had that funding taken from them.  So if the city isn't going to hold up their end, they should consider letting non-profits once again fund themselves through this proven method of fundraising."

SanJose,3e1mz7,MisterFoneBone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:38 2015 UTC,"why are you getting so bent out of shape over ""safe and sane"" fireworks? none of those fireworks have a remote chance of burning shit down unless you're a goddamn idiot and lighting them in a dry field of grass. safe and sane fireworks which are sold in many other counties do not fly in the air do anything but realistically make a whole bunch of colorful sparkles....on the ground.   the funny thing is, people buy these safe and sane fireworks in other counties, then proceed to light them in the streets of SJ anyway. why not have the NP's sell them here and actually benefit? ive seen tons of families lighting them on their driveways allowing kids and family to safely watch colorful displays. they don't even make any loud noises that scare pets"
SanJose,3e1mz7,efects,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:24 2015 UTC,Nobody in their right mind can actually sell the idea that any firework doesn't increase fire risk. To say so is just myopic.  To advocate increasing ways to inadvertently set shit on fire when the entire state is on water rationing is just stupid.   Bent out of shape? Not so much. Amazed at the stupidity of your and Robert's line of thinking.
SanJose,3e1mz7,MisterFoneBone,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:34 2015 UTC,"sure, saying fireworks don't increase fire risk is a bit myopic, but my reasoning is simply that people are going to use them whether or not they are illegal. at least the safe and sane variety are indeed safe, when used by any non-idiot. they do not fly, they do not explode, they do not make any loud noises (edit forgot about piccolo petes which do scream). they sit in your driveway or street and spray a fountain of yes, admittedly, colorful sparks that can cause fires."

SanJose,3dwldz,Moritasgus2,14,Mon Jul 20 03:26:06 2015 UTC,"I know a few people who live in the area. I think it is one of the nicer areas to live in near downtown.  The pros: Great food! Easy access to VTA light rail, Taylor/87, and 1st St./101. If your wife works downtown, she probably won't need to use a car to get to work. Some newer apartments and condos are being built in the area, and they are pretty nice.  The cons: Some marginal people hang around or pass through late at night. The older homes and apartments are a bit run down, and I wouldn't be surprised to learn that they have bedbugs or roaches. Getting to the Caltrain station takes a while (light rail is very slow through downtown)."
SanJose,3dwldz,tanuma,8,Mon Jul 20 04:20:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty nice area if you want to be close to downtown. The Japantown commercial district is low-key, but popular, and has excellent food options and a great community atmosphere (come to Obon sometime and join the dance!).  The neighborhood is probably about 50/50 affluent professionals/legacy and poorer households at this point and continues to slowly gentrify. Being so close to downtown, there are occasional shady people around, but I never had any concerns. That said, there are a few boarding houses tucked into the neighborhood, so be sure to do your research on any given block before you buy.  If we were looking to move right now, Japantown would be our first choice."
SanJose,3dwldz,undiurnal,2,Mon Jul 20 07:57:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, us ""legacy"" homeowners with peeling siding and ""unsightly"" houses certainly appreciate being gentrified."
SanJose,3dwldz,livinincalifornia,2,Mon Jul 20 17:43:07 2015 UTC,"Didn't mean to imply derision, just state the situation. Like most everywhere else in San Jose, the ridiculous housing prices are driving long-time residents out slowly as anyone with an otherwise normal income can afford to stay in their house but not buy into their own neighborhood. It's a huge problem.  And, yeah, some ""legacy"" owners aren't able to keep their homes in tip-top shape due to economics or their own aging, but I understand that there are plenty of established residents with genuine pride of ownership. I didn't mean to imply otherwise.  But when house prices start near a half million for a borderline fixer upper (yet are still significantly cheaper than other established neighborhoods), gentrification is the order of the day, wanted or not. I lived in Portland for thirty years, so believe me I know what a mixed bag it can be."
SanJose,3dwldz,undiurnal,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:00 2015 UTC,"True, it's just a sad thing to see. I look over the hills and think about what it looked like in the 40s-60's. The far rolling hills, the exuberant populace of Californians, the many non-traditional private colleges, Italians and Portuguese mainly who were farmers who educated their way into a productive manufacturing base that grew from the direction of educated businessmen from the peninsula. This has and hasn't changed in some ways, however the massive unrestricted flow of private capital facilitated by the largest banks (see: Google share price jumps $60 billion with former NY bank exec as CFO) and NIMBYism has contributed significantly to driving San Jose's home prices into completely unobtainable territory for most anyone. The median household income isn't supporting the purchase of a house, and is barely making rent, that's the median. Even those who have owned homes for 100 years may not be able to pay the property taxes of an ever increasing world with low pensions and a housing market that makes $400,000 swings."

Most of the freight rail I have seen in the general area is more of the occasional day use, for moving things in an out of the various warehouses of goods in central San Jose area, like your lumber, fencing parts, car parts, bulk stone, rock, concrete, etc. But you might have to scope out the area and talk with the locals in the areas you're looking at.  There are a couple of weird people walking the streets here and there for sure, but I have been out and about doing things at all hours since I can be a night owl sometimes, and I never had any actual uncomfortable experience in the ~2 years I've lived in my house so far.  I have a lot of great neighbors with actual personalities that like to have conversations and invite each other over for dinner and I couldn't be happier with the area.

That being said, I'm about to get a house with a friend because I just can't stand spending so much on a place when living with someone is so much cheaper.

SanJose,3dpntm,TeqTime,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:21:05 2015 UTC,They don't card you at the door only when you buy alcohol at the bar. OP said they wanted to find a place that would just let the under 21 crowd in not let them buy drinks
SanJose,3dpntm,amendoza28,4,Sun Jul 19 20:36:47 2015 UTC,"You missed out on the 80's...  Late 80's, we had quite a few clubs that were all ages.  Each proprietor had various ways of getting the city council to go along with mixed-age venues.  Cactus is probably the most well known locally.   The owner got a type 47 license, which is restaurant with a bar.  He sold hotdogs and hamburgers.  City council for years fought to get rid of it, as did the ABC.  Eventually their wish came true.  There was also ""Club-X"" by local Zero Magazine owner Larry Trujillo.  Larry would hire a DJ, security, and rent space from resturaunts on off nights.   Was mostly dance type of clubs.  ""One Step Beyond""  while not in SJ proper, was right over Lafayette in Santa Clara.  Stan Kent was it's Gene Wilder Wonka style owner.  The club operated for many years, and went from being all dance, to holding live music events with locally famous bands like The Melvins and Neurosis.  The Vortex/Edge Palo Alto.  Absolutely incredible dance floor setup.  Live 105's Steve Masters would DJ there a lot.    There hasn't been anything like these clubs since.  It was all 16 and up at every one of these places. (Cactus was the first that had to go 18+)"

Go after work hours and during weekends to check out the local residents. If you feel uncomfortable, get out.  There are many places that have ""high crime"" that you younger generation dont mind at all. It's where all the action is. See the Mission in SF and Lake Merrit in Oakland. This is San Jose suburbia after all, and the gangsters keep to themselves unless you have beef with them."

SanJose,3dkkcj,Fourteen_of_Twelve,8,Fri Jul 17 00:50:27 2015 UTC,"Camera 3 and the Aquarius theater (when it re-opens) in Palo Alto are the best places to see eclectic/independent/foreign films in or relatively close to San Jose. Parking is rough for Aquarius, so be aware that you will likely have to park far away and walk (or take CalTrain, since it stops close by). There are, of course, other theaters that show independent films. Camera 12, Camera 7 and the big chains occasionally do, so keep an eye on their offerings. There are also a few theaters in the East Bay and (obviously) several in SF that do. So look around at all your options.  I'd offer to join or start a group, but I'm too strapped for time and cash. When I used to have time and money, Camera 3 and Aquarius were my go-to theaters for films outside of the mainstream.  Also, there's Cinequest every year in early spring."

SanJose,3djj4k,CritFailingLife,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:02:02 2015 UTC,"I attack the darkness is a good place to start if you're wanting to try D&D. They have monthly one shot events which are quite beginner friendly and usually have pregenerated characters available so you can walk in, grab a premade character, play a short story that actually completes itself, and then walk out a couple hours later. If the one shot goes well and the people get along and the DM of the table you participated in is looking at starting a new ongoing campaign (a story that doesn't complete in one session but continues over weeks or years), it can even turn into a regular thing. I was in an every other week campaign with some awesome people for a year and a half following the very first one shot event and my SO and I are still close to a couple of the people from it even though our campaign ended."

This is a decent group if you like smaller groups, watching movies and discussing the movie over food/drinks: http://www.meetup.com/movies-740/  Other than that, I would really need to know more about your interests to make suggestions."

SanJose,3djj4k,clone_stamp_tool,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:29:01 2015 UTC,The best groups to join for making friends are groups organized around something you're into. That way you'll make friends who are into the same things. It sounds like you've already started with boardgames and that's great. Think about what other interests you have. Even if they're not real world activities - I've seen a couple of video game groups (general or specific game like a big wow meetup).

That is, there are calm sections, but tubing all of the south fork can be a bit dicey on some of the rapids, and the transportation options for put-in and take-out are fairly expensive and require reservations.  Russian River is closer (I'd say American is closer to 3 hours to a put-in) and is a very lazy river near Guerneville. I've done a lazy trip down, putting in at Burke's Canoe Trips, and it was great. They pick you up in a bus at the take-out for free if you rent from them, or I'd guess for a small fee if you bring your own tube/boat.  There are no actual rivers I'm aware of that are closer, so your only closer option would be floating in a lake."

If you haven't had it, its the superior Vietnamese soup (pho tastes boring in comparison). If you want great pho, Pho 90 is the place to go. The pho is a bit more expensive than other places, but for good reason: the meat is great and the restaurant is beautiful inside. For broken rice, Com 90 is right next door to Pho 90 and is also amazing.  San Pedro has a bunch of fantastic fusion food stands.   Tong Soon Garden has some fantastic and authentic Korean style Chinese food.  There are tons of amazing Mexican places. I like Araujos for burritos, 5 Spot Chivas Grill for tacos on the weekends (they bbq right out in front) and Riviera Nayarita Mariscos for Mexican seafood. Mexico Bakery makes the best tortas (Mexican Sandwich) I have ever had, and they have tons of other great baked goods.  If you want a fantastic sandwich, Freshly Baked Eatery is really good. They make all their bread fresh on site and roast their own turkeys. Its kind of a hidden place and has very limited hours, but if you catch it while its open, its really great.  Henry's Hi-Life makes some fantastic ribs. They've been featured on TV (Man vs. Food) and deserve their reputation. Its in a cool old building and is a pretty unique experience.  Harry's Hofbrau is one of my favorites. It serves some straight up American food in a German style restaurant. Roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, roast beef, etc. VERY reasonable prices, too! You can get a turkey leg dinner for $9.   San Jose has a pretty good food scene and doesn't get the credit it deserves because its so close to SF. When it comes to Mexican food and Vietnamese food, San Jose has some of the best in the world."

They do not enforce no riding in the sidewalk downtown anywhere near as often as I have seen them observe it, even though a ban on adult riders has been in place since Dec '14 to make the rules clear.   Technically bike are considered vehicles, so adults should not be riding bikes in sidewalks anywhere in the state according to the vehicle code.

SanJose,3dbuzu,iKs279,0,Wed Jul 15 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"Those sharrows are only on large streets like 4th. He was probably on a smaller street with a bike lane, like San Salvador, next to the university."
SanJose,3dbuzu,royyah23,4,Thu Jul 16 10:13:59 2015 UTC,"You have it reversed:   Sharrows are shared-lane arrows on a regular vehicle lane to remind drivers that bikes can use the (full) lane and to indicate to bicyclists where on the road they should ride to be safe. In San Jose, they are on streets like 1st and 2nd and San Carlos. In my opinion, they are 90% useless since they are just informative and the type of driver that honks at you for using the lane doesn't give a shit about markings on the floor. Bike lanes are separate travel lanes for bikes. An example of a simple bike lane in DTSJ is on 7th St and on parts of Santa Clara St (West of Almaden Blvd). Bike lanes are great but can be very narrow, close to fast traffic, and sometimes have debris. Buffered bike lanes are like bike lanes but with an extra amount of space separating car traffic and bike traffic. Examples in DTSJ are San Fernando St, 3r and 4th St, and 10th and 11th St. Those are amazing, make most cyclist feel safe, etc. Bike trails are completely separate and not associated with a car road. Examples in SJ are the Guadalupe River Trail and the Los Gatos Creek Trail. These are the best, safest, and fastest way to bike!"

SanJose,3dbuzu,nuvistor,5,Wed Jul 15 07:41:38 2015 UTC,"A few points on sidewalk riding:   Sidewalk riding laws vary from city to city and (as in San Jose) even within cities, as in the city of San Jose. San Jose's sidewalk riding ordinance prohibits adults from riding on sidewalks on downtown streets where a bike lane is present. So it's legal (for example) to ride on Santa Clara, but not on 3rd Street.   Riding on the sidewalk or riding the wrong way in a bike lane is rarely the safest option, but it FEELS safer to many people. That's why classes like the one /u/Pamzella took are so important. Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition offers free urban biking workshops that help people get used to riding on the streets. There are two classes in San Jose this summer. More info here."
SanJose,3dbuzu,RaccoonDispenser,2,Wed Jul 15 16:59:32 2015 UTC,"Awesome that the Bicycle Coalition has picked up the slack.  I swear the class also helped me become a better driver around bikes, learning about the risks that I hadn't anticipated in my own biking experience."

Cars that signal every turn and give way to bikes and peds. Cyclists that signal as well, and walk their bikes through cross walks, follow traffic signals/signs, etc. And finally pedestrians who actually default to walking to the right on sidewalks and crosswalks (much like keeping right in a car or bike)."
SanJose,3dbuzu,verdegrrl,20,Wed Jul 15 17:22:49 2015 UTC,"I try to avoid this but I do admit to doing this sometimes. Usually when I have a left turn coming up and my destination is gonna be on the left of the road I'm going to turn on, I'll bike across to the other side of the road (if it's completely clear both ways) before making that turn to avoid having to make the turn in the intersection because I've had way to many close calls with terrible and/or aggressive drivers in intersections and I value my safety over rules of the road. I try to keep to the rules of the road as much as possible though.   San Jose, unfortunately, is a car city that sees us as a nuisance and sometimes we gotta make our own rules to avoid you all."
SanJose,3dbuzu,dannyduh,7,Wed Jul 15 01:53:32 2015 UTC,"You present a reason and I just want to comment on this exact discussion in the city class I took.  In making that left turn that way, you become unpredictable traffic (and a vehicle operating against the rules of the road), cars are not looking for you, in particular cars are monitoring the other way making their right turn and you risk a direct impact.   If something were to happen, you would also be declared at fault as well as dead or injured, with implications for the health insurance costs you'd be about to receive with the latter."
SanJose,3dbuzu,Pamzella,9,Wed Jul 15 14:54:09 2015 UTC,"I gave you an upvote because you present a real reason for doing this: left turns. It's tough (especially without a mirror) to safely cross three lanes of traffic to get to the turn lane from the bike lane, not least because drivers tend to be very aggressive toward cyclists. However, I recommend using the sidewalk in cases like this, if possible. I do agree that sometimes you have to make tough choices when it comes to safety, sometimes that choice involves breaking the law."
SanJose,3dbuzu,dannyduh,6,Wed Jul 15 02:30:34 2015 UTC,Yea I expected downvotes for my comment but I was only answering the question. People here are more interested in spewing their own opinion on why other people do things than hearing from those people directly. I appreciate your maturity in actually engaging me in conversation rather slapping a downvote on me.  Looks like we both agree that we must take biking in San Jose in a case by case situation on whether or not to break the law. I suppose the discrepancy between us is which case is worthy of breaking the law.

Some have been drinking (like when they started at Rock Bottom and these guys didn't get going until more than an hour later).  Riding on sidewalks faster than you see during the day with none of the lights that are legally required to participate in a night event, for example.   I lived in a popular route for awhile, so I saw a lot of stuff-and heard it, because my bedroom was also on the route and the yelling and speaker trailers continued until 2am.  But the scariest was driving behind a big group on Stevens Creek, 9am the route was to go straight at the light.  Stopped by the light, tons of bikers were riding between the other two lanes where there were cars, riding up and down the crosswalk in front of the 3 other lanes of cars (blocking those who got a green left turn), leaning themselves and their bikes on minivans and small cars on both sides and near the hood, that's aggressive and inappropriate behavior.   We don't gently lean other people's cars in a parking lot, and the people in the cars were probably very uncomfortable.   I hung back to stay away.   As long as that kind of thing is going on, Bike Party is not going to get full community support.   Cops were there but overwhelmed with the amount of crazy shit happening at one moment."

First IMAX screen on earth, yo  San Jose Museum of Art -- small, but they definitely do a good job of cycling interesting exhibits, and I think it's worth 2-3 hours of your time  Camera 12 -- the downtown branch of a local small chain of theaters, they do matinee pricing at $4, and show a lot of indie movies that you really won't see on the big screen anywhere else  Camera 3 -- down the street from Camera 12, they do performance and campy stuff like ComedySportz, troupe accompaniments of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, repeat showings of The Room, etc.  San Jose Giants -- SF's farm team, the games are cheap and surprisingly fun for minor league  Alum Rock Park -- hike up the hill and look down from the trees into San Jose in the late afternoon for a beautiful sunset viewing  Mount Hamilton -- go up to the observatory and get a view of the entire Bay Area  San Jose Municipal Rose Garden -- a small, quiet little park with a large rose garden that has 189 varieties of rose, I recommend a lazy noon-time walk, smelling each different type"

I'd add a couple things: If you're visiting the Rose Garden, check out Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum across the street. It's small but good for an hour or two.  If you're willing to venture outside of San Jose, we've got some wonderful wine tasting nearby:   Ridge Vineyards -- The Cabernet made here placed in the 1976 Judgement of Paris and took first place in the 2006 re-enactment (about 40 min from downtown, up a winding road with a phenomenal view, open weekends only). Picchetti Winery is also a nice stop on the way up to Ridge, located on a historic ranch with a great picnic area (and friendly peacocks). The wine here is decent but not quite as good as Ridge. Cinnabar Winery and Big Basin Vineyards -- Located in Saratoga Village about a 25 min drive from downtown. There are some decent restaurants here too, but honestly my favorite is Village Burger Bar for gourmet grass-fed burgers and craft beers (but not nearly the beer selection as the spots mentioned by the previous commenter).   And if you go to the wineries in Saratoga, you might also want to check out a couple neat outdoor places nearby:   Villa Montalvo Arboretum -- Botanical gardens and outdoor artwork as well as hiking trails (IMO a better summer option than Alum Rock for hiking, as it is a bit cooler). Also a concert venue. Hakone Japanese Gardens -- Beautiful Japanese garden in the foothills of the Santa Cruz mountains. Also offers traditional tea ceremonies."

They also have a nice Italian restaurant, but I've never eaten there, so I can vouch for the quality.   You're a short walk away from a lot of restaurants and bars, but most of the upscale places tend to be at the hotels in downtown (Arcadia, Grill on the Alley, Il Foraino).

I assume that it is your money alone.  You'll mainly need to cover your first month's rent and your deposit, which will likely be the same as the first month's rent.  I don't think you'll be able to rent a house in a decent neighborhood for $3000 per month. You could get a pretty good 2BR or 3BR apartment, though. For $2000 per month you could get a nice 1BR or a decent 2BR."

SanJose,3d6xnm,NoseDragon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:52:57 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, houses don't go for much less than $3k and they are around 1400 sq/ft. That's comfortable for 2 people, scary with 5.  Remember, the housing market here is just as hard on renters. Most landlords are going to want a steady income renter with LOTS of rental history like a married couple versus a crowd of guys living together (no offense).    If you're moving to the South Bay, I'd say $8k minimum is a good start. Remember, San Jose is FAR from SF, like REALLY far. If you are commuting from SJ, you'll need a car because CalTrain will likely not take you to your exact office.  Good luck!"
SanJose,3d6xnm,AnonymousisAnonn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:46:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say really far. My wife commutes to SF every day, although she works in walking distance from CalTrain.   But yes, unless you're working in SoMa, you're going to have an absolutely horrible commute. I did the commute from SF to South San Jose for a few months before moving down here, and it was absolutely miserable."

I know the drought has most of us thinking about water conservation, but another dimension of the shortage is that everything is incredibly dry and either dying or dead. Dry dead plants are kindling.   If you're going to regularly keep any significant amount of cash in the house, invest in a fireproof safe. Even a $120 safe can hold a great deal of cash and smaller valuables like important papers. Birth certificates, estate-plans, life insurance, and savings bonds and stock certificates are all things you want safe. Obviously, the coach was only holding the money temporarily—and a donation drive to help out is certainly in order—but a lot of us have things of value that could be destroyed in a fire."

It was driving in traffic while navigating unfamiliar streets and reading unfamiliar signs.  Unless you are going to be going somewhere there isn't public transit or Uber, I would possibly rethink getting the rental car.  The traffic around here can get pretty bad (like dead stop bad at rush hour). If you are staying in Downtown San Jose, you will have good access to the Light Rail and Cal Train.  Everywhere else, you can get a cab or Uber.    Just my suggestion."

SanJose,3d4isf,SoMuchMoreEagle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:11:41 2015 UTC,"Where in ""suburbia"" are you heading?   The key to driving on the ""correct"" side of the road is to pay attention when you first get in the car and pull out of parking lots.  The rest is just following the cars in front of you.   GPS may be a good idea, too.   And always check the traffic on Google before you leave in case your chosen route is blocked by traffic or an accident.  Leave earlier than you think you should.

SanJose,3d3gcs,R3ctif13r,7,Mon Jul 13 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"It only stops for traffic downtown as far as I know. It has a daily ridership of about 33,000 people according to Wikipedia, so it seems to fit plenty of people's needs. In particular, it is very good way to get to downtown/Caltrain from Campbell, to downtown Mountain View, to San Jose airport, and to Levi's Stadium. I know a lot of people who park at various stations and take the light rail to Sharks games.  Because the construction of the system was party funded by local corporations such as Cisco, those corporations have stations nearby, which enables a lot of people to use the system to commute.  It is also very cheap, the cars are always clean, and bikes are allowed on board. It is significantly faster than a bus outside of downtown San Jose. I think they even have Wifi now."
SanJose,3d3gcs,tanuma,2,Mon Jul 13 06:05:21 2015 UTC,"It has a daily ridership of about 33,000 people    So approximately 0.33% of the population. The article linked below states that in 2011 the cost to carry one passenger in a round a round trip was $11.84.I can only assume that that number has gone up in 4 years.   VTA is heavily subsidized by taxes and thier ridership is so low that its just not sustainable."
SanJose,3d3gcs,tambor333,5,Mon Jul 13 12:43:10 2015 UTC,Roads are heavily subsidized by taxes.  Airports are often heavily subsidized by taxes.  Infrastructure isn't supposed to be a profit center.
SanJose,3d3gcs,andrew271828,5,Tue Jul 14 18:16:26 2015 UTC,"So that means at least 33,000 cars are not driving on our roads every day.  I'll take it."

I hope they finally expand light rail into cupertino and mountain view. Los Gatos and Cupertino are already suing VTA, because, VTA promised the light rail expansion years ago. They are trying to go back on their contract. VTA wants to put in a fast pass lane on the 85 instead of light rail."
SanJose,3d3gcs,bobby_guz_man,3,Mon Jul 13 11:54:53 2015 UTC,"Lightrail already goes to Mountain View :)  Same station at Castro as Caltrain.

A direct light rail line from Downtown San Jose into Evergreen is the better idea, and even that has no traction."

SanJose,3d3gcs,sloowshooter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:59:18 2015 UTC,"No, it's not really about effort. It's about the vast majority of the citizens in the valley understanding that there is no use in utilizing light rail - when it has zero utility for them.  At this point it's a VTA masturbatory act that has cost the citizens billions of dollars.   Blaming people for not using a rail system that does not serve them, isn't a reason to keep throwing millions at a turd in hopes that it eventually gets polished."
SanJose,3d3gcs,bobby_guz_man,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:51:10 2015 UTC,"I'm referring to folks who do have good access to light rail and the express buses.  If you live far out from the stations, then it does not make sense, and that's understandable.  For folks who live along the north-south spine of 87, light rail is very accessible for inter-city travel along the north-south spine.  It's just that a lot of these folks just do not want to use it.  Granted, to use it you would have to get into a public transit mindset.  You will need to watch your time and measure it carefully.     VTA is just like our road system, it is a subsidized service just the same.  In many situations it is faster than traffic, and in many other situations it is not as convenient.  It is a service that is there, you can use it as you see fit.  It is a bit slower and less convenient than cars, but using it will save you some money over having a car, so it can work for people who don't have cars."

SanJose,3d3gcs,orokro,3,Tue Jul 14 19:17:45 2015 UTC,"When I was younger I loved and used the light rail every day. Then I moved out of the area, got a car, and now that I live by it again I don't really need it, since I have a car. Though under some circumstances I still might use it.  But back when I did use it, it would always take it to the Frys on Brokaw or the Frys on Hamilton, and for a year I commuted on it everyday. It's way cleaner and more pleasant than dirty / smelly vta busses. I'd rather ride the lightrail any day."
SanJose,3d3gcs,mantrap2,2,Tue Jul 14 04:51:55 2015 UTC,You can avoid owning a car.  There are tons of people on the East Side who use it to commute to downtown and Mountain View.  Most of the people I know who do have no car and might not be able to afford one easily.
SanJose,3d3gcs,dannyduh,2,Mon Jul 13 13:43:50 2015 UTC,Lived on the East Side all my life. I know zero people who use it to commute to downtown. The light rail goes from the east side up to santa clara and then down to downtown. Not very efficient for us at all. Bus's are what I and every one else uses to get to downtown from the east side without a car. It's a straight shot.
SanJose,3d3gcs,bobby_guz_man,2,Tue Jul 14 03:31:18 2015 UTC,"You are generally correct, but I would like to fix a little bit.  Light rail goes from east side up to Milpitas and then down to Downtown.  Not efficient at all, and cuts off the East side/Evergreen area from Downtown via Light rail."
SanJose,3d3gcs,iKs279,2,Tue Jul 14 19:13:54 2015 UTC,"Everyone agrees that VTA light rail is subpar. I think the solution is to improve it. They are working on adding a second track where there is only one, ensuring the lights turn green when it approaches an intersection, etc. That should help a lot and increase ridership, the same way the bullet trains helped Caltrain.  In general I agree that buses (BRT) are better than light rails for surface transportation, unless you have lots of passengers (since it's easier to add extra cars). The ideal is underground public transportation though (which SJ will finally get, hallelujah)."
SanJose,3d3gcs,bobby_guz_man,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:01:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I personally what we need to do is institute more ""express"" times, such as the one used on the Santa Teresa-Alum Rock line in the morning and afternoon.  Use it also for the North San Jose section.    The re-routing of the lightrail makes sense and should make for better usage soon."

SanJose,3d0zk3,poptons,6,Sun Jul 12 17:08:41 2015 UTC,The beaches in Santa Cruz are about 40-45 minutes away from downtown San Jose.  The water is not warm (compared so Southern California or Hawaii or something) but you'd be comfortable jumping in without a wetsuit on a hot day in the summer.    I'm not familiar with any of the surfing spots but there are always a lot of surfers in the water in and around Santa Cruz.
SanJose,3d0zk3,mantrap2,3,Sun Jul 12 17:41:44 2015 UTC,"Be aware the California coast has a current straight from Alaska so the beaches can look inviting but the water... not so much without a wet suit.   It's nothing like the ""bathwater beaches"" of Florida or Thailand."
SanJose,3d0zk3,bobby_guz_man,2,Sun Jul 12 23:18:46 2015 UTC,In San Jose proper we have no proper beaches.  We do have Bay access via Alviso where you can walk along the sand or row your kayaks out through the slough and out to the Bay.
SanJose,3d0zk3,roadninja,2,Mon Jul 13 16:39:38 2015 UTC,"Santa Cruz or up the coast would be your best options.  Lots of kids/people play in the beaches around downtown Santa Cruz-Capitola.  The temperature highly depends on what you're used to, but all the surfers wear wetsuits if that gives you an idea. IMO it's cold but tolerable for a short period of time in the summer.  I had a teacher in elementary school that went surfing every morning, rain or shine, summer or winter.  There are some very die hard surfers in Santa Cruz!  You could probably pop into a surf shop and talk to the people there about the best beaches to surf for your style.    Summer time beach traffic kinda sucks, but just leave early in the morning and it won't be too bad.  It also gets congested on the return in the evening.  Once you do it enough times you'll get an idea of when to go/not to go."
SanJose,3d0zk3,No_Nrg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:09:16 2015 UTC,The surfing is great all along the coast up here. Check the surfing websites to find out about difficulty and conditions. This region is top 2 in the continental united states.

Reddit's who big melodramatic 'blackout' was all about how terrible Ellen Pao was, but they attributed to her an action she never carried out. No, we don't know whether or not she was objectively bad at her job.

It probably wasn't solely her, but as CEO she should share the responsibility of how the organization is acting.  The real question is how this is going to impact the Reddit community ongoing. If it pulls a Digg, then people can scapegoat her. If it succeeds, then good riddance, right?"

Her shutdown of some harassing subs, and not other more well known harassment subs shows she had a bias against ideals, and not actions.  (These harassment subs have been known to get people fired, swatted, etc)  Reddit should be, and will be a place where you are exposed to ideas, not censorship.  The founders of reddit very much believed in anonymity, democracy, and freedom.  Pao's actions were the direct opposite of that.  Good riddance, ding dong the wicked witch is dead."

SanJose,3cwx3x,robert_cortese,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:17:14 2015 UTC,Maybe my point wasn't clear. I was trying to say that reddit is not some sort of entity that exists to perform a some public good. It's a business and therefore makes decisions (sometimes badly) based on what it thinks will bring in revenue. If those decisions turn out to be not what users want then users can vote by not using the site and therefore the business will suffer. Just don't expect the business to make decisions based on some sort of 'founding principle'. Those can and will change as its business model changes.

But changing operational policies on Reddit certainly does.  That's the difference.  You seem to be extrapolating what matters in office politics and office professionalism within a bureaucracy to what customers/users care about.  The customer view of what matters is seldom what matters to a bureaucracy or what a bureaucracy imagines matters to customers.

SanJose,3cwohx,Travant,6,Sat Jul 11 12:36:00 2015 UTC,"I got my permit at 15 and a half, and my license at 16, I'm not sure if things are different since you're 18+. Here's what I did.  First thing is online drivers ed. I used http://www.cal-driver-ed.com. Once you're done with that and you are mailed a certificate, go to the DMV with 2 forms of ID and the certificate and take the permit test, which is a written test (it might be on computers now, I took it a while ago.) It's pretty easy, most of it is common sense.  Then, once you have your permit, you need to do driving school with an instructor, which is three 2 hour classes, a total of 6 hours. I used http://www.allieddrivingschool.com. It's probably not the best or the cheapest, but whatever it's what I used. Once you are done, the instructor will sign your permit saying you're finished with the 6 hours. While you have your permit you can only drive with a licensed adult over 25 in the passenger seat.  After having your permit for 6 months, you can take the driving test. Go to the DMV with your signed permit and 2 forms of ID, sign any forms you need to sign, and take the driving test. It's really easy, just make sure you stick to the speed limit, always look over your shoulder, and constantly check your mirrors. You'll know this by the end of your 6 hours with the instructor. Then you should be good!  Remember, this is the process for a minor under 18, but I'm sure 18+ the process shouldn't be too different. It should generally be the same. Best of luck to you!"

The best Downtown can do is attract startups, but at some point, they will leave for bigger floor plates in North or South San Jose.  What we need to do first and foremost is to limit as much housing as possible, with the only exceptions being Downtown and Midtown.  And then try and attract jobs down here instead of wasting our time with building more housing."
SanJose,3crwiz,bobby_guz_man,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:39:07 2015 UTC,"Well, Adobe is down there, and many tech companies don't require large campuses.  I think San Jose should be able to accommodate smaller companies that want to be downtown, and large companies that need huge campuses.  Population is going to grow, we need more housing either way, we just need to close the gap between ourselves and surrounding cities."
SanJose,3crwiz,349q87ad,0,Mon Jul 13 00:00:57 2015 UTC,"Startups won't require large campuses, but when they grow, they will.  One of our own Downtown startup just relocated to suburbia Santa Clara because they could not find enough space in Downtown.  They wanted 50,000 sqft of space.  Whether or not it's just an excuse they make, I do suspect that it may hold a grain of truth.  Population is only going to grow if we let it grow by providing housing.  If we limit housing, then the population will grow and filter out into other towns and cities, relieving us of the burden of housing more people than we can.    The gap between us and the other cities, per job-residence ratio wise, is quite wide.  The most recent estimation of the time it takes for us to close that gap is 20 years (2035).  And it's not like the other suburbs around San Jose are going to sit still and let San Jose reclaim the jobs it used to hold.  They'll put up one hell of a fight."

SanJose,3crwiz,rdfox,10,Fri Jul 10 12:33:12 2015 UTC,"No. The ""mothership"" was never meant to house all employees. They have been picking up tons of space around Santa Clara County due to constant headcount growth."

SanJose,3crwiz,original_evanator,4,Fri Jul 10 16:26:04 2015 UTC,"The more workers in San Jose, the more money spent at restaurants and stores in San Jose.

SanJose,3crwiz,melodesign,-7,Fri Jul 10 15:13:10 2015 UTC,"Their killing the phone market because they still make the best handset, but incremental benefits (brighter screen, better battery) isn't the same thing as coming up with a smartphone before a market existed.  Split adjusted, their stock's been super shitty compared to competitors. I don't  have my slide rule on me (and frankly if you're looking for a stock discussion on Reddit, then you need to find something better to do with your time) but compared to most indexes, their returns have been pretty flat over the last few years.

SanJose,3crwiz,Jamaican_In_NY,7,Fri Jul 10 15:17:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for the subtle jab. I don't mind discussing this since you brought it up though. I guess Apple being the most cash flush company pretty much globally means nothing to you. Not sure where you're coming from on this one or what you're trying to get across. Better apple being here and developing their HQ here than in another state  I can't take you seriously if you're saying Apples stock is shitty compared to competitors though.

SanJose,3crjdr,niugnep24,6,Fri Jul 10 08:43:30 2015 UTC,Take a drive down most San Jose business parks and you'll find many (most?) are half empty.   Of course the reason is REITs and the deductibility of empty space combined with the fact many were built during the first dot com boom at inflated prices that still can't be covered with lease income.  So it's cheaper to masquerade the listing and just leave the building empty.  Milpitas probably did the right thing and threatened to condemn buildings like this.  I'm not so impressed by their zoning choices by putting in lowish density housing rather than high density but America is like this.  At least Milpitas is collecting extra tax revenue now.

Some of the members believe in God, but many don't. They get together in the search for truth and the desire to serve humanity and the belief that we are all trying to make the world better. The sermons are really terrific; you can watch them online on the website."

I'm a third-year student pursuing a marketing degree. I'm adept in Microsoft Office, POS systems, and I was an intern at Hanmi Bank's SBA Loan Department in Los Angeles last summer. Technical marketing seems interesting. I'm a quick learner, and I worked for a solar company for a little bit, so I'm pretty well-versed in that."

It'd be tough to convince someone to hire you for a couple of weeks for any job that requires any training.  This might be obvious, but if you are serious about finding a real job, make and keep updated a Linkein profile. The folks I know hiring pretty much exclusively do their search on Linkedin--real easy to check references and experiences."

It's shocking how typing in coherent sentences and being able to differentiate between ""their"" and ""there"" is a commodity nowadays.  Not at all! It's entirely true! Internships are easier if you can lock them up towards the end of May for a 12-week program in the summer, but I was unable to do that, so I looked for part-time work instead. It didn't work out, and now it's that awkward time where it's too late to start looking for work, but just a tad bit too early to stop earning money for the summer!  I do! It's fully updated and at the ""All-Star"" profile level! It's very convenient when job applications give the option to just connect their LinkedIn profile and have it autofill all the categories."

It's more of a career track, but for anyone in college it should be something to consider. All these big consulting houses have multiple disciplines, so you can choose a career track that plays to your strengths and interests. It's a lot of office work and traveling (usually) but the money is usually decent, especially if you stick it out a few years to make it to senior associate levels (5-7 years out of college or equivalent business experience).

Try this:   Go to http://pacificongameexpo.com/website/registration/ and select the ""PACCON 15 weekend pass"" option.  Fill out the purchase info and get registered there.  You will be emailed a receipt. Go to https://warhorn.net/ and click the ""sign up"" option near the upper right.  Fill out the form and get logged in. While logged in, go to https://warhorn.net/events/pacificon-pfs and select the link near the upper right side to register for the event.  In the form that appears, tell them ""my email address is _____ and I'm forwarding you a copy of my badge purchase receipt in a moment.""  <-- the blank would obviously be your email address. Go to your email and forward the receipt to svpfsmail@gmail.com. Wait.  If it's normal ""people are awake"" hours, you'll get a response giving you access within an hour.  Once you have that, go back to https://warhorn.net/events/pacificon-pfs and select the ""event schedule"" on the left side of the page.  You will now see options that weren't there before -- a ""play"" button appears to the right of each game listing.  Hit ""play"" on any games that interest you.  There are 4 days to look at (you'll see links to the 4 days near the top).   A few tips.  Select 1 game for each time period, obviously.  Assuming you've never played in Pathfinder Society before, select games that say they are for level 1.  You can see this in the title of each game.  As you scroll down the list, you'll see games for ""levels 3-7"" and ""5-9"" and ""7-11"" -- skip those.  Instead choose games that are for ""levels 1-2"" or ""1-5"" or even ""1-7.""  When you click to play a game, it will ask you what your character is.  None of the fields are required.  Since you're new, I'd leave most blank.  Maybe for level put ""1"" but that's it.  Another thing.  You don't have to do all Pathfinder.  The Pathfinder stuff is fun role playing and combat games, but it's not all the convention offers.  If you go back to the main convention site there is a huge list of non-Pathfinder events.  That's here: http://pacificon.gamecon.us/reg/Events.asp  Have fun!"

SanJose,3cijn1,empenny10,2,Wed Jul 8 14:09:11 2015 UTC,Sure. I've been using a Behmor 1600+ to roast which does a good job.  I prefer the lighter roasts and keep it around 8oz in size.  The Behmor is electric and is somewhat limited in controlling the roast but I recently ordered a Huky gas fired roaster so started I shopping around for propane.  The Behmor can be bought from several sources.  I bought mine from Sweet Maria's where I also buy green beans.  The Huky is special ordered from Taiwan (I think) and all done by email (no website).  There's lots of information on the Huky Forum. http://www.hukyforum.com  You're probably aware of /r/roasting.   I started with a hot air popcorn popper then to the Behmor and in a few weeks to the Huky.  It's been a lot of fun.  Home roasted coffee can be better than anything from the coffee shops.  When I have to have a Starbucks or Peet's I'm sure to be disapointed.
SanJose,3cijn1,jidery,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:33:04 2015 UTC,I was not aware! Thank you!  Definitely want roasts on the lighter side as well but want very even roasting so therefore want fine temperature control.

SanJose,3cijn1,Eggsmcgee,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:45:58 2015 UTC,Right.  The gas Huky  is immediate where the electric Behmor is a lot slower.  Although I've been real happy with the Behmor and have well over 150 roasts on it.

SanJose,3ch7cr,BayAreaFox,5,Wed Jul 8 15:32:45 2015 UTC,"Aka suburban sprawl bites them in the ass.   Expanding rapidly initial created a lot of revenues during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s but then the maintenance and ongoing costs overcame the transient growth revenues of sprawl and you get the situation of today.  The only real solution is to reduce costs by letting some of the sprawl split off or go ghost, along with finding ways of attracting more efficient revenue/cost zoning/sources.  Basically this is harking back to what European and Asian cities have known well for centuries: you can't separate zoning into nice little academic districts like in SimCity but rather you must mix them and go for urbanization which is the only way to achieve cost efficiencies while building revenue.  Will San Jose realize this or just pretend it ""knows better""?  Who knows.  I'm not hopeful."
SanJose,3ch7cr,mantrap2,4,Tue Jul 7 23:13:33 2015 UTC,"Well go look at their urban villages plan and they're trying very hard to mix commercial and residential use areas.  However, I think you need to keep in mind that a good portion of San Jose industrial companies are high tech manufacturing (and are mainly located in north San Jose). Do you want to live next door to where they make solar panels, flash memory, or hard drives? There is a reason that the industrial places are separated from the residential areas and it's because living next to industrial plants where people make physical things is neither attractive nor intelligent from a public safety standpoint. Additionally for being such a large city San Jose is considered a labor exporter where people live here but then leave to their jobs in other cities (the envision 2040 plan talks about this so SJ is definitely aware of it). That has a significant economic drain since residents cost more to the cities, and if they're working outside the city limits it's a blow to their revenue structure since those people are patronizing more businesses outside the city limits.   I'd suggest you look at the San Jose envision 2040 plan. I've been to some of the urban villages meetings, and I can say that I don't like the way the current streetscapes portion of this plan is pushing to choke traffic lanes down to make it more pedestrian friendly, but the city workers seem to give the impression that they do care about what people think. If San Jose is already a labor exporter just making the areas more miserable for people to travel will not make people give up their cars. It may have the opposite effect of creating congestion and overall creating economic drain through the loss of talent and companies.  Some of the planners seem to have a balanced mindset about these items, but we can only hope they make good decisions to balance out the future. I've sent e-mails to the planners regarding some of my positions on these issues so it will be interesting to see which way San Jose goes. Many of those employers up the peninsula are increasingly looking towards San Jose since it is becoming more attractive from a cost standpoint so I'm optimistic.   https://www.sanjoseca.gov/index.aspx?nid=1737"

SJ has been reducing lanes on tons of streets already, and continue to do so every year. it's actually a pain in the ass. i've been combating it by taking more inside/residential streets and avoiding the larger streets. as a result, i'm sure residents are not happy about it. but what can you do when a busy street removes 1 lane and causes you to spend an extra 5min just to get to your destination?"
SanJose,3ch7cr,efects,3,Wed Jul 8 15:17:36 2015 UTC,"I would never buy a townhouse next to these industrial facilities especially when the production of these high tech products does result in pollution (Land, air, and noise) either by accident, being unavoidable, or in some cases by accepting clean-up cost as part of long term operations.  The only reason these townhouse are popping up is because the land up there is way cheaper.  Additionally on your 2nd point the development projects where they did these streetscapes were supposed to incorporate VTA transportation with the light rail being expanded, but instead they scrapped that to run more buses. High tech manufacturing needs to be segregated from where people live because the types of economic activities that are performed on and around those areas are fundamentally incompatible with residential living.  San Jose is building housing, but with current rental rates requiring the majority of people to have a 2 person occupancy on 1br apartments. The car is not going away. The design ethos to punish people so much that they give up their cars is not good design. It is behavior modification that in the end will punish and affect those with lower incomes and less mobility as those with the means to escape the congestion will simply move away. The math simply does not work out that San Jose is planning for an additional half million people to be in the city and to simultaneously begin restrictions on roadways that are currently congested! The willow glen lincoln ave road diet is a good primer on the subject (if you read the reports and business statements) since it directly shows that the congestion pushes people off lincoln ave and those pedestrians feel safer. But it also comes at the cost of slower traffic, decreased business patronization (according to the business group), and increased speeds on residential streets which included increased speeds near the high school! This is the result of a single road diet, but then what happens when ALL the streets are done in similar manners. If the alternate routes are also similtaneously street-scaped then what? People still have to get from point a to point b. I've sat on a single city block in San Franscisco while the lights go green & red for 30 minutes straight without being able to take your foot off the brake.

(good thing i'm not a politician haha)  for example, i could've taken light rail to work for a few years, since i live next to a cooridor, and my work was within a hundred yards of a station. unfortunately, it takes over 1hr to ride there via light rail. so, my choices were 1hr by lightrail, and inconvenience of not being able to move about during the day and run errands, or spend 1hr in a car, but give me the opportunity to run errands during the day or after work"

SanJose,3ch7cr,DogsOfWarAndPeace,2,Thu Jul 9 14:15:41 2015 UTC,"About the pedestrian-oriented changes: I'm personally absolutely in favor of them and I'd love to change your mind.  The reality of it that the perfect system is one in which the different modes of transportation are more or less segregated such that they do not interfere with one another. In other words, I am not in favor of slowing car downs in general, I am actually in favor of moving cars away from areas with lots of pedestrians and bikes and towards areas with neither of these: freeways and expressways.  I believe in choice when it comes to transportation:   If you want to walk to restaurants or retail, you should be able to walk and feel safe and comfortable; this requires slowing cars and other vehicles down, widening sidewalks, adding trees (for shade) and activity along major boulevards. Yes, it does mean it'll slow other modes down on those arteries. If you want to bike, you should be able to do so as well; this requires bike lanes that connect intelligently to bike trails. Bike trails are to bikes what highways are to cars: they allow you to go faster, they're most likely much safer, and they ensure bikes aren't in the way of cars and strolling pedestrians. If you want to drive, you should have an easy way to go from your home relatively quickly to a freeway, where you should stay until relatively close to your destination. Freeways are safer, yield better MPGs, and obviously are faster. Your car is out of the way of pedestrians and bikes, and vice versa   Finally I believe public transportation options should also have their dedicated lanes/tracks/etc., for the same reason (no conflict with other users, speed, safety). That means BRT, light rail, and BART."
SanJose,3ch7cr,iKs279,2,Wed Jul 8 21:32:21 2015 UTC,"how does moving away cars from pedestrians and bikes onto freeways/expressways solve the problems of san jose? san jose is built with tons of urban sprawl. there are literally 5 expressways in san jose - almaden expressway, san thomas, central, lawrence and capitol expressway. almost none of them connect either (i think only central and lawrence). road diets don't work when all they do is divert traffic onto residential roads where children and pets are playing"
SanJose,3ch7cr,efects,2,Wed Jul 8 22:40:38 2015 UTC,"The urban sprawl should be limited, but I think that's a separate problem. The freeways and expressways should be connected and should be separated cleanly from the rest of the transportation network (I'm thinking about walking/biking across freeways and expressways easily here).  Road diets should divert cars onto arteries made for fast car travel. If they indeed divert traffic onto residential roads then part of the diet was not thought through properly (either there was an expectation that people would drive less or there was no improvement in freeways/expressways to take the added traffic). That doesn't invalidate the idea of a road diet, which is–at the end of the  day–about making a given artery less friendly to people driving and more friendly to people walking and biking."
SanJose,3ch7cr,iKs279,3,Wed Jul 8 23:03:14 2015 UTC,"i agree that road diets should divert cars onto arteries made for fast car travel, but you're missing the point. the roads that are being dieted are literally the ones that were designed to carry the majority of traffic. take willow glen for instance! lincoln avenue, the only major street that runs parallel would be bird avenue, which is 1/4 a mile away. so, what happens when you make lincoln 2 lanes (1 lane going north and south)? all the traffic is diverted around lincoln onto the residential streets. people park along house fronts one street over, then walk over to lincoln where, hooray, it is now safe to walk because of the road diet!"
SanJose,3ch7cr,efects,2,Wed Jul 8 23:13:51 2015 UTC,This point along with your other points are spot on. San Jose's own reports on the road diet completely agree with you on not only the volume but the speeds increasing on the residential roads parallel to the main arteries. (I have been corrected by someone reading the report a little more closely)
SanJose,3ch7cr,waveriderca,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:47:22 2015 UTC,"I believe that is incorrect, based on http://www.sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/44259  I quote:   Neighborhood (Local) Streets  Volume and speed traffic data was collected on 23 local streets surrounding Lincoln Avenue, with the following results:  12 of the neighborhood streets (52%) experienced minor volume changes when compared to conditions before the Road Diet Trial, with differences up/down of less than 50 vehicles per day. These variations are within expected daily variations for local streets. >  Eight streets saw more significant volume changes, all with decreases between 100 – 600 vehicles per day: Brace, California, Hicks (Curtner to Pine), Iris, Lester, Newport (south of Minnesota), Pedro and Willow Glen Way.   Speeds within the neighborhood streets were generally similar before and after the Road Diet Trial, with no streets having a significant increase in motorists traveling at 10+ mph over the posted speed limit. >  One street, Hicks Avenue (Curtner to Pine), had an increase in overall speeds such that it now exceeds the speed threshold established in the City’s Traffic Calming Policy (85th percentile of 33 mph or more on a 25 mph street), increasing from 32.9 to 33.6 mph."
SanJose,3ch7cr,iKs279,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:46:16 2015 UTC,"I do stand corrected! I was disappointed that they decided to omit the reporting of the accident rate for the road diet before and after. I am hoping they do a larger more significant study of the after effects of this change that is more than just a few days before and a few days after. It may be messy but I hope they further analyze this change to see how it changes longer term.   I know my own personal perception of driving around WG downtown is that it is miserable on the weekends to try to get into downtown and I will park blocks away choosing to walk to it instead of trying to navigate Lincoln. I'm unsure how homeowners in the adjacent blocks like having people like me constantly parked in the residential areas, but if I can't do that I will not go to willow glen. I know of similar commentary from people I know about the inability to easily visit downtown willow glen due to the traffic snarls. The willow glen business association member survey is I think an interesting read as well that provides counter point although it is just a survey done with people. The members do report a decrease in business revenue and customer satisfaction. The survey does state that pedestrian and bicycle safety is up, but car safety is down.  If you look at the unfiltered (at least I think they are) positive and negative comments that are placed in the survey they both acknowledge the increased traffic congestion. I'm not sure why there is such a huge disconnect with this vs the San Jose report numbers, but I think this points to a reason why this needs to be looked at more.  I think this road diet should be done with better traffic light timing since that seems to be an area both sides say can be definitely improved.  https://www.willowglen.org/dl-11109/FINAL_WGBA-Road-Diet-Survey-Results_061415.pdf"
SanJose,3ch7cr,waveriderca,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:52:37 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your response. I agree that we need a long term study of the impact of the road diet on car travel, business owners, and residents. I still think that even if we find significant issues, the solution is probably to use an other road as the ""fast travel"" artery and keep Lincoln slower, so that it's more pleasant to actually stay at. I also think that if we can get more people to walk/bike/take the bus then that leaves more space for those, like you, that have to drive to get DT or to WG."
SanJose,3ch7cr,iKs279,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:10:14 2015 UTC,"Lincoln avenue shouldn't be an artery for fast car travel. Roads designed for fast car travel do not have restaurants and retail alongside them, roads designed for walking/biking do. Therefore it's OK to make driving on Lincoln avenue more difficult if it means making walking/biking better. I agree there should be an alternative for fast car travel, and that alternative is probably CA-87 (and to a lesser extent Meridian avenue). CA-87 is ~0.8 miles, or 3 minutes driving with no traffic, NEE of Lincoln Ave. I-280 is ~0.6 miles NNW of Willow St. Meridian Ave is ~0.8 miles SWW. Just for reference, covering 0.8 miles going 15mph take 3 minutes and 12 seconds.  If those options are not enough, then we should build a new North-South artery in an area with little retail.  I believe that the report from SJ Department of Transportation actually found a decrease in volume, both on Lincoln itself and on adjacent streets. So based on that, it seems likely that people drove further away to the arteries I mentioned (or used some other mode of transportation, although that seems less likely)."

We need to repeal this ban.   We had a great time in my neighborhood as every year.   We shut down some streets, filed into the basketball court.  Neighbors out celebrating our countries Independence in the most traditional, community building way possible.  I'm biased, but I'm still going to present both sides of the argument here (with my counter-points)   People blow up themselves up  Some people shouldn't handle fireworks Vets with PTSD hate them Tell that to my Vietnam vet neighbor who threw $500 towards this years show.  I heard the neighborhood collected $5000 this year. It scares animals They're ANIMALS.. Good god, quit with the anthropomorphism.  My dog was freaking out, but too bad.  She's a dog. Drought! Fire Hazzard!   On what?   Wood shake roofing fell out of style in the 80's.  Most folks have 20 year tar/gravel shingle roofing, or tile.   Here's my positives.   It gets neighbors out with each other, helps build stronger communities. State law says any fireworks sold (safe and sane) must be done by a non-profit, and 50% of the proceeds go to them.  We're missing out on a lot of money for our non-profits like little leagues, girl/boy scouts, homeless shelters, etc.   And some why's.   People are going to do it anyways Police aren't going to enforce it, especially with some of the larger block parties like ours. It can be done in a safe manner, in safe and open areas (like school yards)  I feel if we sanction ""Fire zones"" for people to light them off in, they're less likely to do it near house/apartment clusers."
SanJose,3c5pz0,robert_cortese,10,Sun Jul 5 05:30:04 2015 UTC,"Dry, dead plants are prone to catching fire, and we're in the worst drought of any of our lifetimes with probably an unprecedented amount of plants which are one ember away from being kindling. Do you remember the color the sky was a few summers back during the fires? I think a lot of people from San Jose remember. I remember being short of breath, being told to stay inside, being told ""we're working to contain it"" as it destroyed homes.   If you'd like to learn about the potential fire hazard fireworks—even those of the ""safe and sane"" variety—I suggest speaking to a firefighter. When I was maybe 7 or 8, I accidentally started a fire in my neighbor's front yard with a sparkler.   BTW, my best friend had to stay with me last night because loud, sudden noises that sound like a war zone put him right back in Afghanistan. His distress is very real. I'm genuinely glad your neighbor is okay, but he's not the only vet or person suffering PTSD and you didn't even mention him having PTSD. We have noise ordinances for good reason.   If your neighbors played loud music until 3 in the morning (when the fireworks finally stopped around me), you really wouldn't call the police?    People are going to do it anyways   That's never been a good argument for the legalization of anything. People sell meth, people murder, people rape. Those will all remain illegal so that we can prosecute people for whom there's sufficient evidence of risking or causing harm to themselves or others. That's the law's primary function.   You want to play with fireworks. That's fine, I get that. Fireworks can be fun. Maybe just say that next time."

As an aside, I get to spend tonight with my best friend to make sure people breaking the law don't set off his PTSD from service. I know a dozen other servicemen who have served in my neighborhood who could be going through the same thing.

We need to repeal this ban.   We had a great time in my neighborhood as every year.   We shut down some streets, filed into the basketball court.  Neighbors out celebrating our countries Independence in the most traditional, community building way possible.  I'm biased, but I'm still going to present both sides of the argument here (with my counter-points)   People blow up themselves up  Some people shouldn't handle fireworks Vets with PTSD hate them Tell that to my Vietnam vet neighbor who threw $500 towards this years show.  I heard the neighborhood collected $5000 this year. It scares animals They're ANIMALS.. Good god, quit with the anthropomorphism.  My dog was freaking out, but too bad.  She's a dog. Drought! Fire Hazzard!   On what?   Wood shake roofing fell out of style in the 80's.  Most folks have 20 year tar/gravel shingle roofing, or tile.   Here's my positives.   It gets neighbors out with each other, helps build stronger communities. State law says any fireworks sold (safe and sane) must be done by a non-profit, and 50% of the proceeds go to them.  We're missing out on a lot of money for our non-profits like little leagues, girl/boy scouts, homeless shelters, etc.   And some why's.   People are going to do it anyways Police aren't going to enforce it, especially with some of the larger block parties like ours. It can be done in a safe manner, in safe and open areas (like school yards)  I feel if we sanction ""Fire zones"" for people to light them off in, they're less likely to do it near house/apartment clusers."
SanJose,3c67td,hell_on_wheel,3,Sun Jul 5 05:31:27 2015 UTC,"People blow up themselves up   Unless you have some numbers here, this point doesn't do anything to push the argument along.  If anything, this is more of a civil liability than a legislative issue.   Vets with PTSD hate them   ...and firing off rockets above said vets' houses is a big middle finger to them.  Totally disrespectful IMO.  Ask a Vet's organization, not your one neighbor, if you want any meaningful response.   It scares animals   Just because you don't like animals doesn't mean everyone hates them.  We have a lot of animal lovers on our Nextdoor and everyone is saying how much their loved ones are freaking out.  Worst case scenario is that we end up with animals running out into traffic, which then becomes an even bigger problem for everyone.   Drought! Fire Hazzard!   When we can afford a firefighter for each city block, then we can afford more fire hazards.  We shouldn't tempt fate here.  It's less to do with wood roofing and more to do with flammable debris in people's yards, of which there is plenty in this dry weather... http://abc7news.com/news/illegal-fireworks-start-san-jose-house-fire-revelers-light-more/830175/   It gets neighbors out with each other, helps build stronger communities.   There's 1,000 things that can accomplish this that don't involve explosives.  Block parties, food, music, art, games, etc.  ""Stronger communities"" is really questionable given how much some folks dislike explosives being set off on their front lawns.   We're missing out on a lot of money   How much?  If you can't quantify it, you can't argue for it.  Please give other non-profit incomes for comparison.   People are going to do it anyways   People are going to sell drugs anyways, this is no reason to justify legalization.   Police aren't going to enforce it   That's completely untrue.  Big difference between ""we don't have the staffing for enforcement"" and ""officers won't do their jobs""   It can be done in a safe manner   A gun can be fired in a safe manner, too, but this doesn't mean we should trust everyone with one good eye and a finger to do so in their neighborhood."
SanJose,3c67td,seanhead,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"How much? If you can't quantify it, you can't argue for it. Please give other non-profit incomes for comparison.   I had a friend in San Bruno government give me the figures.  They collect a $750 booth fee, this year they had $75,000 collected in fee's (100 booths)  Sales this year topped over $3.5m, meaning a benefit of $35,000 per charity.  Some more, some less.  Rotary collected $115,000.   This means that for every resident (42,000), in San Bruno, about $83 worth of fireworks were purchased.    Now this is where predictive, messy math comes in that probably has a lot of factors that makes it invalid (Not taking into account San Jose residents travelling to San Bruno for fireworks) but...  If San Jose had $83 per resident spent on fireworks, we'd be looking at about $83,333,333 (Half of that would benefit our local charities)  100 booths per 42,000 residents comes 1 booth servicing 420 residents.  Using that as a base, San Jose would have around 2380 booths to service everyone.  $750 ""Booth fee"" as San Bruno does, we would collect $1,785,714 in booth fee's.  I can provide more later, I've actually done a lot of study on the subject.  There's a handful of California towns/Cities that repealed their bans, and it's been nothing but a windfall for them."

Putting a dispensaries in the middle of nowhere hurts the business, hurts tax revenue, hurts patients and most of all is completely unjustified by the facts.  However, I'm slightly amused the dispensaries failed to organize to oppose it. Seems like a caricature of the stoner culture."
SanJose,3bvxgh,aydiosmio,2,Thu Jul 2 23:36:22 2015 UTC,Maybe they see it as an opportunity to revitalize a neglected area of pre-1970s San Jose.
SanJose,3bvxgh,livinincalifornia,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:40:20 2015 UTC,"It's actually good for the neighborhood.  Some disclosure, my best friends own Haze and Garden House Remedies.  (If you saw my ""lettuce"" post a few weeks back, they're the ones funding me and giving me space for my project)  So ya, Haze is in a pretty sweet location.  Since the CSJ closed the other clubs, our revenues have gone up 4 fold.   I'm sure it's the same story for the other clubs. This in turn has made the CSJ tax revenues go up 4x.    The area is heavy industrial.  I wouldn't call it ghetto, but I think it could use a facelift.  CSJ is recognizing an opportunity for tenant improvements to the area with the handful of clubs left.  As far as not organizing a protest..  A lot of clubs are pretty broke after the first round of protests.  I was close to the leadership (John Lee) and really disagreed with his methods.  If there's one thing I know about city hall is, don't annoy them, always be respectful and dress lawyerly in front of them.  Unfortunately this fell on deaf ears to the organizers.  Every meeting pertaining to the clubs had 3-400 green t-shirt with pot leaf folks there acting like idiots.  Some of the choice ""Testimonies"" i saw.   One guy called council ""Racists"" because pot prohibition was created to target blacks and mexicans Several people got up there and started crying Some people got up there and started talking about nothing at all for 2 minutes.   I think our clubs were the only ones that came in respectfully and presented our case in a dignified manner.  Council hates it when you drag on a meeting by 2+ hours for drivel.  Another reason there hasn't been many protests is the clubs that are left are taking the high road (no pun intended) with city hall, and cooperating with them as much as possible.    TL;DR So it's not so much we can't organize a protest of some sort, but at this point we're just better off playing with City hall, than against.  The other half of it is as I said, a lot of us disagreed with how the first rounds of protests were handled, we feel city hall is ticked off enough already, we want to be their friends."
SanJose,3bvxgh,robert_cortese,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:01:13 2015 UTC,"Just one point though, organizing isn't just about for or against, it's about negotiating with the city for a legislation that's beneficial for all. Sitting back and letting the city dictate the terms without input from the industry they're regulating will always result in draconian nonsense.  When you organize and gain support, you have the leverage to engage the city in a conversation.  I'm part of an organization that's sometimes at odds with the city, but we do our best to keep contacts within the city council not to influence policy so much as keep the city at arm's length. We keep the city involved in the conversation which keeps them from blindly shutting us down because they don't understand how our organization works. We do our best to keep the peace without either side resorting to drastic measures."
SanJose,3bvxgh,aydiosmio,0,Fri Jul 3 19:35:02 2015 UTC,"I agree fully but there comes a point where it's no longer negotiations and becomes harassment.  As an industry myself and a few others feel like that line was crossed, so in order to salvage any cooperation from the city we have to play along.

We’ve outgrown our current location (2106 Ringwood Ave, San Jose), and our future location (1365 N. 10th St) will give us an opportunity to expand. Having twice the floor space will allow us the room needed to enhance our patient retail experience.  We’re also very happy to be a part of the revitalization of North 10th Street. We look forward to bringing a similar level of safety and security to our patients and neighbors along 10th St as we do at our current location on Ringwood Ave. and in Oakland at 1840 Embarcadero. We’ll employ alarm systems and video surveillance, as well as professional interior and exterior security staff. We always do our best to provide a surrounding that’s safe and secure without sacrificing an atmosphere of healing and wellness.   We invite you all to visit us on our opening day, July 27 (located at the intersection of 101 and 880).  --Team Harborside Bringing cannabis “Out of the shadows, into the light” since 2006"

The ones off to the side were probably the best (vantage point wise).  Those are what would be behind the glass at a hockey game.  I've never seen a show from way far in the back.  I can't imagine it'd be worth $100 bucks to deal with traffic, go in a crowded venue, sit in the back and basically watch the show on the giant tv they put up.  That's just me.

I personally have been longing to go to twin rocks at Rockaway beach, it looks super chill! I actually have compiled a ""summer bucket list"" so that i can hit all the awesome spots, as this is the first summer I've been able to spend in Portland (I spent summers in Klamath growing up). There's also battleground lake, a short drive north of the Gresham/troutdale area, if you're digging the nature or not digging the drive through the stupid mountains to get to the beach. It's a quaint swimming hole and theres plenty of scenery!  Lloyd center has an ice skating rink on the ground floor! Good way to cool down, if you or your family is into that.. It's been hot and humid here. IIRC when I was over there a month or so ago I saw that skate rentals were $4, I think. If you like Dr. Who, there is a tardis room on killingsworth, and if you're into film noir, Wednesday nights (usually, sometimes it changes) there is a church of film (can be found on Facebook) that meets weekly and is free, usually, or just a few dollars.. It depends on the location. If you enjoy beer, pizza, and movies all at the same time, go to the Hollywood theater and have beer and pizza while you watch a movie! There's a drive in theater in Sherwood, too!  If you want to go take a hike, hit up forest park on the west side of the river, between Beaverton and Portland. I have yet to go there and not be thrown into awe at the beauty. One of the trails is some 30 miles, so do use a map or leave a trail of seed shells! There is also a cat cafe downtown, there is a fee to pet the cats/go into the cat room which I believe is $8. If you will be here on a weekend, go downtown and hit up Saturday market. If you haven't been, its kind of like the garlic festival or mushroom Mardi gras, but they're not celebrating anything and the party goes on until 4-5p every weekend until it's too cold. =]  Wish I had more suggestions for that particular area.

There is also a lesser known restaurant called Teske's Germania - if you like good German beer and sausages.  San Pedro Square market in DT San Jose is also a good place to find something to eat and drink. Lots of seating, but it's usually pretty crowded. Sometimes there's live music.  The De Anza Hotel is right next to the SAP center (where the Sharks play) and has a nice quiet little lounge inside where you can order a fancier cocktail.   As far as sights go.. well you're not going to find much in SJ. There's the ever-popular Winchester house, but I believe it will be around $40 per person. However, If you haven't been, I strongly recommend it.  If you like shopping, Santana Row is the place to be - It's a nice outdoor mall with lots of food (Yard House has a gigantic selection of beer) plus parking is free.  All that being said, you can just walk around Downtown. There are tons of bars and restaurants. There are some architectural sights too - The California Theater is one of my favorites."

What kinds of places are you preferential to?"
SanJose,3brcmu,NoseDragon,11,Wed Jul 1 16:00:54 2015 UTC,"San Jose has the best Vietnamese food in the world outside of Vietnam. I recommend Pho 90, which has the best pho I have ever had, or An Nam for bun bo hue, an absolutely amazing spicy beef noodle soup. Try the pho if you are less adventurous. If you're really adventurous, try the bun bo hue with pizzle (cow penis.)  San Jose also has some of the best Mexican food in the world outside of Mexico. Mexico Bakery has some absolutely amazing tortas (sandwiches). If you like seafood, Riviera Nayarita Mariscos has some truly wonderful Mexican seafood dishes. You really can't go wrong there. For more typical, I like 5 Spot Chivas Grill. Araujos is also very good. Al Pastor is a delicious type of pork roasted on a spit with pineapples, so I recommend trying some of that at whatever place you go to. There are also multiple taco trucks all over that are pretty amazing.  If you want great South Indian food, I really like Anjappar Chettinad Indian Food. There are two locations, one in Santa Clara and one in Milpitas. Its actually an international chain, and a very good one at that. They have locations in India, Singapore, and a few in the US. The food is spicy, so be warned.  If you want to hang out and have a beer, ISO and OG are good (as others have suggested.) I also really enjoy San Pedro Square. There is a ton of great fusion food there and its just an all around nice place to go and have a drink outside while eating some good food."
SanJose,3brcmu,netllama,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:11:34 2015 UTC,"Anjappar Chettinad has some awful reviews on Yelp (not that Yelp is the final authority).  What other Indian places have you been in the South bay that you feel that Anjappar Chettinad is the best?  Also, which 'Pho 90' are you referring to?  I'm googlling & searching Yelp, and see a few with variations on that name, but nothing explicitly called ""Pho 90""."
SanJose,3brcmu,NoseDragon,2,Thu Jul 2 00:26:38 2015 UTC,"Their reviews are bad based on their service alone. The one in Santa Clara JUST opened up, but I went to the one in Milpitas and the food and service was excellent. I suggested it because its a pretty unique kind of Indian food that is not easy to find, and my South Indian friend took me to an Anjappar's in Singapore when I was on business. The food was exactly the same in Milpitas.   Most Indian places in the Bay are not Chettinad style, and are often Northern Indian. I prefer Chettinad to North Indian.  I guess its called Pho 90 Degrees, and its on Story road right next to the Walmart. My coworker moved from Vietnam when he was 18 and is extremely picky about his Vietnamese food, and he introduced me to that place and I haven't even considered another Pho place since. The place next door, Com 90, is also excellent. Its a broken rice place by the same owners. These places are beautiful inside and an obvious step up from all other pho places.  I do like An Nam better, as they specialize on bun bo hue, and I prefer that to pho. There are two An Nams, one on Story behind the Taco Bell and another on Tully.   Edit: Also, with Yelp, their reviews on foreign food can be hit or miss, as a lot of people don't know what authentic food is like and a lot of people bitch about stupid shit. I can't believe how many 1 star reviews I've seen because a place was cash only or the person doesn't like the way the food is traditionally prepared."

SanJose,3bsnew,mantrap2,5,Thu Jul 2 14:25:42 2015 UTC,"Always have been well above US averages.  When my mother and father bought their house in '72, it seemed exorbitant to pay $62,000 (the going rates in ""cheaper"" Bay Area middle class neighborhoods was closer to $30K-$40K), but because my mother loved the area (Marin) my father found a way.   Last assessed value: $2.5M.  :-(    But for her Prop 13 has been the only reason she can still live in the house - she'd be out of the street even with her healthy retirement.  With my puny house in the South Bay I was paying about 10x the property tax for a house worth far less and much smaller than hers but Prop 13 was a response to already bizarrely and insanely galloping housing priced in the 1970s.  The property tax ratchet to buy now is about as insane as paying college tuitions (the ""smart play"" BTW if you have kids is to send them to Germany for university instead rather than any US university - no debt because tuition is free; the payoff for Germany is a lot of smart people will stay and offset their demographic contraction issues)  Housing in the bay area has increase FAR beyond the inflation rate.  Akin to college tuitions actually - super-inflational.  And generally not so much for any ""real"" economic reasons.  It's part of why I'm not staying much longer - the quality of life really has degraded badly and when I lived in Asia it really became clear that ""car culture"" and ""suburbia"" is utterly moronic, destructive and nonviable in any human sense.  I had more of a Midwestern Gemütlichkeit/Minnesota Nice and walkable convenience in my Taipei neighborhood than I've ever had in 30+ adult years in California.  It made me realize a lot of the claims of ""the Bay Area is better"" are overblown being more a delusion and dream than reality.  And to boot, the semiconductor industry (what I was trained for as an EE) is long gone from Silicon Valley (the name is as accurate as calling Pittsburgh ""The Capital of Steel"" or Detroit ""The Motor City"").   Today semiconductor exists as a reality in Taiwan and other locations in Asia now instead as is most high tech hardware."
SanJose,3bsnew,ChillyCheese,2,Wed Jul 1 21:37:29 2015 UTC,"But for her Prop 13 has been the only reason she can still live in the house   That assumes there isn't a feedback cycle:  People stay in their homes because property tax is low -> Very little house inventory because no one's moving -> Real estate prices go up -> Property tax seems relatively cheap for long-time homeowners because prices have gone up  That also assumes property taxes would need to remain at the same rate if everyone paid their fair share. If the state and counties can somewhat get by with a ~1.2% rate with a large number of people paying closer to 0.12%, they could probably reduce the rate to 0.6% if everyone paid the home's assessed value. Not that I'd be optimistic about government lowering a tax rate without a voter-backed initiative.  IMO Prop 13 is really just jamming up what should be a somewhat free market by creating artificially ultra low inventory. If not for Prop 13, a huge number of people would likely have sold or be selling as the market crept up, keeping things in check. Now we just have run away home values which gives younger generations very little hope of owning a 3-4br home, while empty nesters take up those large houses just for themselves, because there's an incentive to do so."

SanJose,3bqypy,sj_poly,2,Wed Jul 1 13:05:41 2015 UTC,Yes - one less bill for renters but as you said the landlord will just work that in to your next rent increase!  People seem to hate this idea but supposedly it currently takes a couple city workers to just manage the billing of trash.  This will save the city those expenses plus some sort of software license cost that they would have to pay if they didn't do this.  I'm also perfectly happy with one less small bill to forget about.

City officials said software upgrades could cost $16 million, an additional $14.40 a year per household. The move would eliminate about two dozen city jobs. But city officials aren't expecting layoffs and plan on easing employees out of those jobs through attrition and reassignment."" ... ""Another casualty of the change would be revenue the city has received through late payment fees. That amounts to about $2.1 million a year, which the city has used to pay for everything from homeless encampment cleanup to billing subsidies for the poor.

SanJose,3bp0wx,dehydratedH2O,2,Wed Jul 1 04:19:56 2015 UTC,I've always taken Uber black cars home directly from Terminal B at SJC with no issue.
SanJose,3bp0wx,greensuedepumas,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:32:11 2015 UTC,Yes you can.  In the Uber app move the pickup pin off the airport to a location available for pick up.  Once the driver accepts your fare give them a call and let them know what gate you're at.   Make sure you sit in the front seat so it doesn't look suspicious.
SanJose,3bp0wx,pandarawr,6,Wed Jul 1 00:06:57 2015 UTC,"It's honestly kind of shitty to put a driver in that situation.

SanJose,3bp0wx,gloomndoom,4,Wed Jul 1 02:06:08 2015 UTC,The Doubletree is really near the cell phone waiting area and probably the closest free shuttle ride. It's walking distance to the airport.

SanJose,3bp0wx,Chay-wow,7,Wed Jul 1 03:35:15 2015 UTC,"More expensive, sometimes you're waiting for quite a while, and some drivers are pricks.   Before I had a car (6 months ago) I used to frequently take Yellow Cab, the 777-7777 number, to my job about 10 minutes away when I could not get a ride from family/friends. It was approximately 3.5 miles away from my house, and I worked there for years. I've taken cabs in San Jose literally hundreds of times.   My experiences were generally good actually. I've never had any real complaints other than them being late a few times, or some of them texting while driving (I'd tell them to stop if they were driving terribly and they would without any hesitation), or the smell... fuck, the smell sometimes was horrendous.  But honestly, the real reason people are switching off of Taxi service, is the price. It would cost me 20 dollars (technically 16-17, but I tip) just to get to work, 3.5 miles away. Then another 20 to get back home. 40 bucks a day, times 5... It gets quite expensive if I my family/friends were busy that week. Now imagine if you have to go across town, or even another city. Sometimes an airplane ticket is cheaper than a taxi in those cases.  I get it, Taxi drivers need to make a living too. I feel bad for the position they are in, considering Taxis will be extinct in a few years. But with a competitor who can offer a better experience, a nicer ride, AND at a cheaper price, would you take a cab?"

SanJose,3bp4ic,SuperbOrange,10,Wed Jul 1 00:31:54 2015 UTC,"SoFA district is shaping up to be one of the most interesting neighborhoods despite being a part of larger downtown. It's where the arts and music community is more focused on, and this stretch of 1st is completely different from just a few blocks North. With more housing being built in the area I think this will most quickly resemble what people imagine a city neighborhood would look like.  And as artificial and manufactured as it might seem, I'd argue that Santana Row is becoming a neighborhood that people would go and hang out at for a distinct feel. It helps that they will keep expanding too.  I also noticed the Alameda developing along nicely. I recall more and more craft breweries opening up along there, and I think it's the start of something. I think the Whole Foods opening makes a difference.  San Pedro Square is popular but doesn't have that much of a unique feel yet. When the new retail opens on ALL SIDES of it, that area might start to look the most ""urban"" of any part of the South Bay.  Besides that, San Jose has a lot of growing up to do. I would guess the next areas to come into their own will be North of St James Park and the area east of City Hall. I'm completely clueless about the east side though."
SanJose,3bp4ic,quadshock,3,Wed Jul 1 07:18:08 2015 UTC,"The different neighborhoods or ""districts"" aren't as distinct from each other as you might find in another city of similar size so it might be difficult to pinpoint each one and their individual attributes. The different neighborhoods are quite subtle to those who haven't grown up here but they totally exist. Here's my attempt on the parts of San Jose I know well (though there are definitely more but i'm not as familiar with them):  The Eastside (Or simply ESSJ) of which King and Story is more or less the ""main street"" of the area your asking for. But there is loads more within the eastside (Berryessa, alum rock, etc.)  Little Portugal (Definitely not as large as it used to be when I was a kid but there are still quite a few Portuguese restaurants, bakeries, cultural halls, Five Wounds, etc.)  SoFA District   Japantown  Winchester https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_(San_Jose) of which contains Santana Row and the Valley Fair shopping centers  The Alameda https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alameda_(San_Jose) Not sure if this counts as it is essentially one street but I feel that it is distinct enough from its surrounding areas.   Willow Glen  Alviso Due to frequent flooding has a lot of abandoned and decaying buildings. Neat place to visit though if you're into that type of stuff! Also the Alviso Marina County Park up there is a great place to bike  And there much more such as Burbank, Blossom Hill, Seven Trees, Santa Teresa, Coyote Valley, etc."

It's a heavily hispanic area, which made my mom freak out about me (whitey white girl)  buying a place there. We have a smallish main street that goes for a few blocks in front of Sacred Heart church. Along that street are some taquerias, a panaderia, and this place which I LOVE. I know very little spanish and the workers know very little english, so it's always sort of an adventure for me.  There's a lot of colorful quinceaneras, and sometimes they sell food outside the church on sundays. ALSO THE EASTER PARADE! (I cannot believe I almost forgot this). On Good Friday, the church has a parade that goes down my street where Jesus is carrying his cross, and he is just getting whipped to hell and back. Imagine me, 30 year old atheist girl in her front yard, planting plants. Suddenly, you hear drums and singing. A crowd starts to walk down your street, and suddenly, Jesus Christ appears. There's a mariachi band too. It's is magical and wonderful and oh so weirdly confusing. I'm not Catholic, but it's seriously one of the highlights of my year.  Store-wise is kinda bare, unless you like places that sell boots, super tight/high cut dresses, or Jesus paintings. The neighborhood has really grown on me since I moved in in 2011. I live diagonally from a house with a stylized rooster painted on the side and my neighbors on one side are totally insane (I used to keep a blog about them), but everyone else is fantastic. Everyone seems to have fruit trees so there's this massive fruit trade that goes on, or boxes of stuff that get put outside for you to choose from.

I initially filed with the city, and they called me back and told me it was caltrans jurisdiction because it's an off ramp.  But funnily enough the guy had no idea who to contact at caltrans.

It does not explain interpretations of one's own behavior, where situational factors are more easily recognized and can thus be taken into consideration. Conversely, from the other perspective, this error is known as the actor–observer bias, in which people tend to overemphasize the role of a situation in their behaviors and underemphasize the role of their own personalities.

The food is all very inexpensive and they also adhere to Suma Ching Hai's belief of compassionate vegan/vegetarianism, although they are not owned by her or her works, they, instead, sympathize.  But if you're in town before a concert, honestly, the best option is to go downtown to Good Karma, a local vegetarian eatery and brew pub, thing. Although I suspect it will be swamped, it is really the closest to the SAP Center. HOWEVER, if you have time, I would really suggest you take in Tofoo Com Chay, they have a really quite endearing quality to their business. It's a little more oily, but it's decidely authentic Vietnamese vegan (I think, don't quote me, they could be vegetarian) dishes acclimating nicely to a Western palate."

SanJose,3bfcyy,Ezra1964,10,Sun Jun 28 18:53:47 2015 UTC,"This might be a good idea to talk about how to stay cool and practical during a heatwave power outage.   1) Keep a bag of ice in the freezer. When the power goes out during a heatwave, you need something to absorb the heat that gets into your freezer so you don't lose food. Try to avoid opening your freezer and refrigerator, because doing so instantly lets in the heat, and it's best to keep that process as slow as possible. I usually go buy a second, smaller bag of ice that I put in a cooler which I can use for things like water. Speaking of which....  2) Drink water. When you're hot, your blood vessels dilate and you perspire, and both of these things require a consistent supply of water. Don't hesitate, go grab a glass of water.   3) Open a window or windows only if it's under shade and only after your house/apartment starts warming up. A house can act just like a parked car in a hot parking lot with its windows up in that it allows in heat and then traps it, becoming hotter than the outside environment. To help mitigate this effect, allowing some airflow is necessary, so you want it from the coolest outside source possible. If you don't have shade, try the North side of the house. If you're lucky enough to have lower windows in the shade and higher windows, you can create an airflow effect from the hot air rising, pulling in the cooler air from the lower window.   4) Stay low. If you are in a multi-level building, the hot air will rise, so lower floors or basements will be the coolest parts of the house.   5) Utilize evaporative cooling. While we are in a drought so it's not a great time to be wasting water, a little water can go a really long way. What I like to do on hikes during heatwaves is to take a small towel and soak it in cold water and drape it over the back of my neck. It has a nearly instantaneous cooling effect that can last for quite some time. The theory is that it cools the blood and the central nervous system. That might be nonsense, but this does keep you noticeably cooler."

SanJose,3bfcyy,nwow,2,Mon Jun 29 01:01:04 2015 UTC,Call PG&E.  They don't usually know there is an outage until it's reported.
SanJose,3bfcyy,SoMuchMoreEagle,2,Sun Jun 28 19:18:50 2015 UTC,"I agree about calling PG&E, but you just reminded me of something that surprised me: last time there was a power outage, they actually called me.  It was on Monday, and my phone rang just as I was leaving work. I picked up, and it was a robodial thing telling me there was an outage in my area (which incidentally is the peninsula, not SJ). Good thing, too, because I was planning to go home and make dinner.  Quite possibly they learned about the outage through a customer complaint, so it's still good to call them, of course."

SanJose,3b7av2,Jamaican_In_NY,10,Fri Jun 26 15:29:58 2015 UTC,"The main issue is that homes are going for BONKERS prices and the inventory is low. Understand that on a 900K home these realtors are making around 50K to sell it. They only need to sell 2-3 of these homes a year to make decent money. This is how realty works. People knock on doors and make phone calls. There's a simple test to pass after 140 hours of classroom work that can be done online. I think it's more indicative of low inventory, high prices, and a realtor labor market that has extremely low barriers to entry. Houses in the bay area practically sell themselves and they frequently do, but the realtor just needs 2-3 people annually to say yes."

Shower falling through the floor, termites, and a pet odor? 10K over asking. Couple that with the rental prices where the rental properties charge people an extra 400$ /mo every time you re-up and it gets pricey quick. 3000 becomes 3300 then 3600 until you move and then you have to keep moving every year to avoid the charges.

Our family has a fairly accurate oral history of the weather too.  It's gotten damn hot around here.  Jerry Brown wants to increase the state population from its current 30m to 49m.

SanJose,3b7av2,hell_on_wheel,3,Fri Jun 26 15:51:37 2015 UTC,We've hit peak realtors!
SanJose,3b7av2,ChillyCheese,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:07:50 2015 UTC,Inventory sells instantly. The problem is there is almost no inventory because people aren't selling.
SanJose,3b7av2,waveriderca,4,Fri Jun 26 17:52:45 2015 UTC,"Because people can't sell. Taxes are never reassessed on properties so people CAN'T move. California is so dysfunctional on this matter because it actively prevents liquidity in the housing marketplace. Almost every other state in the US levies taxes based on government assessed valuations this actually keeps prices DOWN.  This also is what forces all these luxury developments and extravagant plans because places like San Jose need to expand their tax base to account for lost revenue when providing services for long-term residents .  Do you really think that property taxes on homes worth over 700K should be paid at a rate of 100K just because it was purchased 30 years ago? Police, Fire, Education all cost money and what you're seeing in terms of ballooning development is a direct result of many people paying a significantly LOWER share of taxation compared to younger people and newer people getting into the market now or renting now. God I love how everything in this world now seems to be squeeze the young people who are trying to make a go of it."
SanJose,3b7av2,velocigina,3,Fri Jun 26 20:15:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, Prop 13 is not a major factor in what is going on, because it only brings down prop tax rates for people who have owned their homes for ~15 or more years. Most home owners in the South Bay are not in that category.  Also, Prop 13 is an excellent setup which prevents older people from being forced out of their homes (something that when it happens, people are very much up in arms over!).   The failure in Prop 13 is that it does not exclude commercial real estate from the prop tax hiking. This is the abused loophole. Commercial tenants should be continuously profitable and can afford to pay market property taxes, but are not being required to because of Prop 13. Prop 13 must be amended to end exemptions for commercial real estate."
SanJose,3b7av2,worshipdmx,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:10:11 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why new residents or home owners should be made to pay more than people who have lived here for a long time.

Why can't we make an investment in the new generation - you know, the ones who will be supporting our infrastructure?"
SanJose,3b7av2,bob13bob,2,Mon Jun 29 17:08:37 2015 UTC,prop 13 is fucked up..  i pay 4x as much property tax as my grandfather with equivalent value homes.  I thought they could do an exchange without increasing their prop taxes though?   Lets get together and vote to screw the next generation like the Boomers did.
SanJose,3b7av2,waveriderca,2,Fri Jun 26 22:21:31 2015 UTC,"Assessments are done at the time of sale. A family can transfer property through a trust and therefore never trigger a sale, but the point is that long-term residents are paying significantly lower taxes than newcomers.

Those newer buildings have beautiful apartments and great amenities, but as someone else said, the area is DEAD. It's all corporate office parks. We have since moved to Campbell, and being walking distance to the Pruneyard / downtown Campbell is amazing.  How much living in a dead neighborhood will matter to you kind of depends on what kind of person you are, but it's definitely something to consider (particularly if you're single). Japantown or just west of San Jose might be a good compromise. The bike commute up the Guadalupe trail is great exercise and quite pleasant."

River View is available and is still in construction on the side next to the light rail. There's apartments near Rivermark plaza such as 550 Moreland Way. I'm not sure the rent but it you want to be super close to Safeway and all the restaurants in Rivermark plaza, it's like a community there with everything close.

The whole north San Jose area has a TON of apartment complexes being built right now. Your best bet is to find one that is half-done and see if they have some kind of two months free rent deal, in exchange for dealing with construction or empty apartments around you.

Living close to work is nice, but you definitely get out more if you're within walking distance of a nice hub of bars/restaurants.   Another good thing about Mountain View is that it's got a train station right there which will take you into SF without having to park/drive, and will allow you to meet more than the tech geeks which pretty much dominate the south bay and peninsula (though more and more are filling up the city, too)."

Honestly, I couldn't be happier and the commute, despite what people say, is extremely easy.  I leave at about 9 and come home around 6:30 and it consistently takes me 15-20 minutes.  The longest that it's EVER taken me is 30 minutes and that was when I left work at 5.  Downtown San Jose is a cool place to be and will likely be the same price as Crescent.

SanJose,3ayr0h,efects,11,Wed Jun 24 16:36:09 2015 UTC,"Nice. Every time I've taken a taxi from the airport recently, each cab driver was surlier than the last. The last time the driver was obviously irritated at having to take me 3 miles for $25, for some reason. I don't know the intricacies of the business, so maybe short trips like that are less profitable. I would think that high turnover would be most desirable. Anyway, the other three rides I took with Uber that trip were magnitudes better, not to mention the cost."
SanJose,3ayr0h,rob_heiser,6,Wed Jun 24 16:59:59 2015 UTC,"The worst for me was getting in a shitty old van, waiting five minutes for the cabbie to arrange a second fare, then having to share it with a guy who was going 15 minutes in the opposite direction, and still having to pay twice what I'd normally pay for an Uber."
SanJose,3ayr0h,farrbahren,3,Wed Jun 24 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"What? Why on earth would you stay in the cab? If the cab doesn't roll when you get in, then you leave."
SanJose,3ayr0h,getMeSomeDunkin,3,Thu Jun 25 02:47:52 2015 UTC,Lesson learned.
SanJose,3ayr0h,farrbahren,11,Thu Jun 25 04:50:20 2015 UTC,"Everytime I was forced to take a cab from the airport, I was reminded why uber and lyft got so popular. Taxis suck ass. the ONLY benefit is there was a line of them right there, now that the monopoly is over, maybe that will change."
SanJose,3ayr0h,Illford,9,Wed Jun 24 16:44:42 2015 UTC,*forced? I've always used Uber at SJC. They just have to keep their tag off their dash. Can't tell the difference between them and your best friend (which isn't illegal either).
SanJose,3ayr0h,guice666,7,Wed Jun 24 17:33:55 2015 UTC,"Didn't see in the article, but I assume Uber/Lyft drivers can now wait in the taxi line, rather than having to wait outside or circle the airport, meaning you should be able to get one much more quickly.  Taxi drivers need to come to grips with the fact that their model is dying. I imagine only older folks who aren't keen on tech still use taxis, and obviously that will continue to decline. If I were a taxi driver I'd be seriously planning on switching over. There's simply no way they can compete."
SanJose,3ayr0h,ChillyCheese,6,Wed Jun 24 17:37:50 2015 UTC,"I assume Uber/Lyft drivers can now wait in the taxi line   The real point of Uber/Lyft is on the fly demand. I don't think any of them will be waiting around.   If I were a taxi driver I'd be seriously planning on switching over. There's simply no way they can compete.   First part, I agree. Second part, not so much. Taxies just have to become more transparent. Stop butt-fucking their passengers on rates. They've already created FlyWheel, an Uber alternative for iOS -- which is a good start.   What I can say is the price of driving a taxi is going to plummet. Right now, they're required to buy these medallions which costs shit tons (like 10k+) just to operate. But won't be for long."
SanJose,3ayr0h,guice666,6,Wed Jun 24 17:57:06 2015 UTC,Stop butt-fucking their passengers on rates.   You realize that the city of San Jose sets the rates for cabs right?
SanJose,3ayr0h,randomusername3000,4,Wed Jun 24 18:19:20 2015 UTC,"I actually did not realize that. But that was implying illegal ""distance"" fees or ""meter isn't working"" scams -- which has happened to a buddy of mine traveling from SFO to S. Bay."
SanJose,3ayr0h,guice666,2,Wed Jun 24 18:25:38 2015 UTC,"I had to get to SFO from Santa Clara, called 3 cab companies and the only one to show up said he had to charge me double to get to the airport since it was so far out of his way.  Since then I've only used Lyft or Uber in the Bay Area for the past ~1.5 years. Longest wait I've had was around 20 minutes but at least I'm not having to call cab companies multiple times because the driver decides I'm not worth the fare."
SanJose,3ayr0h,Engineer_Everything,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:26:37 2015 UTC,That sounds crazy costly (I've seen South SJ to SJO taxi fares of $100 so I'd guess it's more than that). VTA to the airport is $1 each way and getting there from Bart should be under $5 with a station in SFO.
SanJose,3ayr0h,cmccormick,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"I imagine only older folks who aren't keen on tech still use taxis, and obviously that will continue to decline.    I don't use Uber and Im not that old, tell me why use uber over a cab?  I have never had an issue with a cab in SJ.  Always the same fare to the airport and back, and usually some friendly Eritrean guy."
SanJose,3ayr0h,FSMCA,2,Wed Jun 24 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"Uber/Lyft become increasingly cheaper the further you need to go. For example, an Uber from SJC to Santa Cruz is around $50 vs. $100 in a cab.  You don't have to deal with payment and tipping; simply jump out of the car when you reach your destination.  Bad driver? Leave a bad review, and if their ratings fall below ""Good"" they can no longer be a driver. Strong motivation to be a good driver (no strong perfume/cologne, annoying music, dirty car).  The one downside at SJC has been having to wait for a driver to arrive, though typically it's only a few minutes."
SanJose,3ayr0h,ChillyCheese,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"Any idea how much from SJ south, say oakridge mall to SFO?  Last time I took a super shuttle and it was terrible, $40 and 2.5 hrs because they had to drop someone off in Hayward, getting stuck in East Bay traffic.  Hard sell on the $100+ a cab wanted.  I have also always wondered, how does insurance work on things like this?  Is it true I wouldn't be covered by the drivers insurance if there is an accident?"
SanJose,3ayr0h,FSMCA,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:54:36 2015 UTC,"FYI Uber drivers get fired for anything under a magic number like 4.5. Kind of messes with my default rating system for most things: 3 is so/so, 4 service/driver was above average, 5 truly spectacular."
SanJose,3ayr0h,cmccormick,2,Wed Jun 24 21:04:25 2015 UTC,"I've realized that I've inadvertently fucked over a couple uber drivers before I knew this by rating them 4. 4 is pretty good! 5 should be perfection, not the norm."
SanJose,3ayr0h,efuipa,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:40:59 2015 UTC,"I used to have this discussion with my DM at a retail chain I worked at that had the online customer surveys to win a gift certificate when you check out. our scale was 1-5, any score on a survey that was not averaging 4.5 to 5 meant a conference call. If it dropped below 4, say a 3.9 we could and sometimes had to write up the people who interacted with the customer."
SanJose,3ayr0h,Bulder,3,Fri Jun 26 15:19:17 2015 UTC,i've tried to use uber/lyft twice at SJC now. they simply show no cars available when my GPS locates me at the airport. did that change before this went into effect?
SanJose,3ayr0h,efects,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:53:44 2015 UTC,No idea. Last I used it was vacation back in Oct of last year. Went to and from via Uber from Sunnyvale. No problems.
SanJose,3ayr0h,guice666,-2,Wed Jun 24 19:57:33 2015 UTC,"Or you'll get a constant swarm of Uber/Lyft drivers stalking the airport because they're not allowed to park in the Taxi line? Causing traffic as they circle, filling up the cell phone parking spots, etc?   I'm just speculating; I've never actually used either service since I live so close to SJC."
SanJose,3ayr0h,stave,0,Wed Jun 24 17:36:12 2015 UTC,That's really hard to police. I'm surprised SJC doesn't require some identifying mark on the car so you can tell it's a ride share.
SanJose,3ayr0h,cmccormick,4,Wed Jun 24 21:10:12 2015 UTC,About time. You were allowed to be taken there before and there was a way to get around the pickup ban by putting your location at the edge of the airport or something but I'm glad we don't have to do this anymore.
SanJose,3ayr0h,zeonchar,4,Thu Jun 25 04:58:34 2015 UTC,"Uber pay same fees as regular cabbies? Okay. Then allow Uber drivers to use *Taxi Only lanes, too, no?  Taxies have special lanes and areas dedicated to them to allow them to filter through traffic for efficiently. That's where their fees are going -- special privs. at the Airports."
SanJose,3ayr0h,guice666,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:53:17 2015 UTC,"The article was unclear, but I think the fee is different. $2.30 for Uber and similar but $8 for taxis. Not sure why, if they're going to pay a fee, it wouldn't be the same amount. But maybe the special privileges are part of it."
SanJose,3ayr0h,adrianmonk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:44:03 2015 UTC,Those numbers are referring to how much customers pay as the base fee for each service.
SanJose,3ayr0h,double_expressho,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:48:05 2015 UTC,"The article is so unclear, I'm not really willing to say anything authoritatively. But the way they phrased it, it doesn't seem like it can be what the user pays:   Ride-sharing companies use smartphone applications and pay $2.30 per fare, compared to cab companies that use a dispatch service and pay about $8 per fare   Basically, the structure of their sentence is ""companies ... pay"". It could be that they worded it wrong, but that's what they seem to be saying."
SanJose,3ayr0h,adrianmonk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:18:56 2015 UTC,Oh I think you were right. I read that wrong. Just looked it up and Uber charges $1 flat fee plus mileage.

You get your choice of chicken schwarma, falafel, or 1/2 and 1/2.  Then you choose your toppings, they have a variety of salads cucumber, cabbage, mixed greens, eggplant, hummus, cous cous, and then a few $.75 toppings like kalamata olives, or feta cheese.  I did a half and half pita with their spice sauce, hummus and a few of the salads on top.   I thought it was quite tasty and a quick and easy lunch.  I even liked their to-go boxes for their pitas!

The entirety of Lincoln street gets mobbed on a regular basis, and more than a few of those people holding up traffic and contributing to the congestion are slowly trawling the street looking for parking. Putting up a real structure (maybe where that old Valero used to be) would go a long way to allaying the traffic issues for the area."
SanJose,3awm41,HeavyFriends1970,3,Wed Jun 24 03:21:27 2015 UTC,I agree - the one parking structure on Willow/Lincoln is barely enough to hold everybody who visits.

I do the same commute only SJ to RWC and it takes me 45 mins to get to work by 8am, and 1.25 hours typically coming home around 430. I drive bc my schedule is not flexible. Caltrain will definitely save time, especially if you can catch the bullet train and if your schedule is more flexible. Keep in mind though, the train doesn't run late, or often other than rush hour times.... and the bay area is pretty sprawled so having a car might not be a bad idea, unless you and your gf are planning on sharing a car."

SanJose,3awiox,GlitterIsMyProzac,2,Wed Jun 24 08:03:03 2015 UTC,"If you can make the commute work via Caltrain, you'll be in good shape. As others have mentioned, you'll be in good shape to drive too - the majority of traffic is based around San Francisco, so you'll be going with lighter traffic during rush periods if you're going toward SJ in the morning.  Since you are coming from the midwest, I'm going to make the huge jump to assuming you mean Chicago, where public transit is pretty solid. I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss that. My wife and I live in Santa Clara and use bikes exclusively for daily transit; we made the move about four months ago. It's not perfect but it's workable. For about one trip a week, we hail an Über or use some other transit.  To sum up, I'll directly answer your questions. No, it's not an awful idea but one to be approached with caution. A drive from RWC to SJ will be somewhere around 30-40 minutes, since you're going against the majority of traffic. Caltrain may be comparable to driving depending on how close your start and destination are to stations.  As I mentioned before, my wife and I made the move recently and left the car behind. There have been a few times I've wished to have it, but overall it hasn't been a big deal."
SanJose,3awiox,dethbunnynet,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:36:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I think the commute would be tolerable, but I've also been looking at places in Santa Clara, to be in the middle of DTSJ and RC.

SanJose,3awiox,dee8,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:44:25 2015 UTC,"Fairly suburban, quiet-ish. If you are close to The Alameda/El Camino Real, you can get by with just one bus line 522/22 that will take you all the way into DTSJ.  Depending on the life you want to build here, I find having a car is very helpful, or at least access to one (ZipCar, ride sharing, etc), especially for groceries, entertainment, etc. There can be a lot to do, but a lot of them are spread apart and public transit can only do so much for you."

As noted elsewhere, you'll be going in reverse commute direction so it's about as optimal as you can get. You can take Caltrain or not, it probably won't be a whole lot faster (if you include getting to and from the train station)."
SanJose,3awiox,5entinel,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"Caltrain is an obvious answer: take the bullet from RC to SJ and back. Should take you 30 minutes.  You can take a free shuttle (VTA DASH) or a bunch of buses (VTA 63, 64, 65, 22, 81, light rail) from Diridon station to proper downtown.  I'm not familiar with RC transit as much and I don't know where you'll be but you can bike to the RC Caltrain station and either leave your bike there (a bit risky) or take it on Caltrain (then you can bike from Diridon to DTSJ, 10 minutes, but you have to make sure the bike cars aren't consistently full in RC at the time you want to take the train)"

Low pressure sodium (SOX) lights - the super yellow kind used in San Jose - used to be more common in the 1960s and 1970s, especially in industrial lots, poor communities and developing countries. In Europe, driving in the Irish countryside at night for example you'll find many small towns using it just because it is cheaper in operation than anything else. Same used to be true for great parts of Eastern Europe, notably the former DDR / East Germany."
SanJose,3atg4j,frumperino,11,Tue Jun 23 15:34:37 2015 UTC,"Specifically the sodium spectral lines still appear in the observatory's observations but it's only the sodium lines and those are predictable enough to know to ignore it or subtract them from data.    Mercury vapor lights (the white ones, typically) are ""broadband"" and put out spectral lines at pretty much all wavelengths which are indistinguishable from astronomical light thus it mucks things up."

SanJose,3arads,cl76,5,Tue Jun 23 06:34:08 2015 UTC,"I'd go with option 1. I did this from San Jose Diridon for a year but walked the 25 minutes from SF Caltrain to FiDi. I tried Muni light rail but it was more predictable and often faster to just walk. The other option is to get yourself a Bay Area Bike Share annual membership and bike from SF Caltrain to FiDi.  ""No"" on Fremont BART option for me. The drive sucks and if I had to choose between BART and Caltrain, I'd take Caltrain.  The third option (and there is no transfer at San Bruno so I assume you meant Millbrae) sounds great and should be the fastest in theory but Caltrain and BART don't like to coordinate so there will be many times you time a commute (w/ 5 minutes of padding for the transfer even) but Caltrain will be late and you'll have to wait another 20 minutes for the next BART.  The only snag is that not as many bullets stop at the Santa Clara Caltrain Station, but that affects both options 1 and 3."

For Santa Clara, you'll be restricted to the 2xx Limited trains but should be able to cut some time if you ride a bike.  I'd seriously consider the Bay Area Bike Share linked above. A lot less hassle and worry that comes with owning a bike."

SanJose,3arads,ZagiFlyer,4,Mon Jun 22 22:37:28 2015 UTC,"I used to work in FiDi and lived in San Jose, off the Brokaw exit, at the time.  I did the drive to Fremont and took BART into Montgomery.  Travel time from door to door for me was 1 Hour 30 mins.  It's mostly a reverse commute so you won't get stuck in too much traffic except for the afternoon mess near SJC and 101.  Headed down to where you'd exit 880 might add 10-15 minutes to what it took me.  I can't help you with CalTrain since I haven't used it.  Parking at Fremont BART is now $3 and the round trip is $11.90.  If you get autoload on a Clipper card, you can get a discount on the purchase which makes it marginally cheaper.   i.e. $64 for $60 autoload.  All in, you're looking at little under $15 per day in transit fees using this option.  Just be aware that the parking lot fills very quickly, but if you get there before 8 you'll probably find a spot.  Millbrae to Mongomery takes a little longer than Fremont to Montgomery from what I've found, which is odd because the distance is shorter.  It takes about 50 mins to an hour.  It's about a $9 BART fare so factor in the time and cost for CalTrain to get your full commute on that route.    Hope that helps!  Let us know what you decide and how the numbers pan out for future reference.  =)"
SanJose,3arads,dee8,2,Mon Jun 22 23:02:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for your thought out response! Wow that is so odd about BART from Millbrae to Montgomery. I thought for sure it would be quick. I think my first day I'm going to take BART from Fremont anyway as it is the most direct option until I figure out something else if necessary. I live off the Bascom exit. I will definitely update my post with what I find to be the most viable option.
SanJose,3arads,acetoin,3,Mon Jun 22 23:07:57 2015 UTC,"For years, I drove from Mountain View to Millbrae (~30 minutes at 7:30) and then BART from Millbrae to Montgomery (35 minutes if no BART delays).

SanJose,3arads,iRaqTV,3,Mon Jun 22 23:46:44 2015 UTC,"I'd go with your first option. You may want to invest in a folding/collapsible bike for convenience. They're awesome and inexpensive (<$250 online or in a department store, e.g., Wal-Mart). Plus, if you're going to eventually live in S.F., it'd be easier to have a bike that's easily stored.  I would avoid trying to BART from Fremont. In fact, I would eliminate that as an option: it'll take you 45+ minutes to get to that station. The 680/880 corridor from North San Jose through Fremont/Union City receives a tremendous level of traffic. Don't count on a comfortable journey."

SanJose,3apye2,jkconno,3,Mon Jun 22 16:04:23 2015 UTC,"2nd on comcast, product is great, service is average (which is still bad).  When your subscription is up, they will raise rates without telling you.  They have hidden fees, and will try to add random garbage on your network.  Like the whole xfinity wifi.  Which is anyone with an xfinity account can use your wifi on this ""public"" network.  Its a pain to disable, and seems like every month they enable it again.  I suggest going and getting your own router/modem.   I believe I am paying $60-70 a month for 100+Mbps no contract.  Only need 50Mbps but its only 5 dollars less and we do throw lan parties, so extra bandwidth is nice to have on those occasions.    Only had connectivity issues twice in 2 years.  So pretty solid, but then again I am LAN."

They maxed out at 18mbps down/1.5mbps up in my neighborhood. Comcast is at 105mbps down/10mbps up.  The one thing I will say is that Comcast's service has not been as reliable. Slow downs aren't uncommon. At least with Uverse, even though it was slower, I never had downtime. It was always at max speed.  I'd probably still go with Comcast if I had to choose today, only because I need that upload speed for offsite backups and work."

EDD   2) If you can get to Sunnyvale, next door to the SVL library I would join NOVA.  They offer classes to help update your resume and Linkedin.  They also have a computer center and give some basic computer skill classes.  NOVA  3) I would join Promatch also, it is a volunteer run organization that is part of NOVA to help people network in getting a job.  They are located in the same building as NOVA.  They offer workshops on how to interview, getting your resume and linkedin profile updated, how to network, etc...  PROMATCH  4) I know you are new to the area, but I heard 80% of the jobs are gained through networking, if you have former coworkers or friends, try to use them to see if there are positions available.  Get the word out there to people that you are looking.    5) The other 20% is through job boards so use indeed.com, monster, linkedin to apply for jobs also.  You can also look at recruiting agencies for temp jobs.  Lots of positions are contract for hire.  Meaning that you are on a 6 month contract, but if they like you it could turn into a permanent position.    6) If you are qualified, you can apply for training at NOVA, where they will pay for a class for you to take to get a certificate training, like PMP etc...  This is a way to extend your EDD benefits from 6 months to 1 year.  Source:  Currently unemployed and part of NOVA and a co-lead at promatch.  Good luck!"

The ways the unions are set up here are like this : get in at a job in a hospital (any job but security at a hospital ) and you are in the union. Why is this good? The unions in the hospital have tuition funds set up.  Get any job in a hospital  here and use that tuition fund to get your phlebotomy cert or whatever it is for ems you had. Since it is in the medical field it counts and would be covered by the tuition fund. You can be a unit clerk, janitor, food service worker, transporter  or any other numerous  jobs in a hospital and that applies."

SanJose,3actgy,randomusername3000,8,Fri Jun 19 02:25:30 2015 UTC,"It's an upscale boutique style hotel: http://achotels.marriott.com. It's actual a great fit for San Jose. I think the city is ""under-hotelled,"" and we'll see it during the Super Bowl. I know that it's mostly business travel for the week. But as more large conferences start coming downtown, demand will grow and these smaller hotels are a great addition."
SanJose,3actgy,ThinkBiggerSanJose,2,Fri Jun 19 04:58:51 2015 UTC,It's great but I think downtown could use at least one more skyscraper hotel.
SanJose,3actgy,ReflectingPond,6,Fri Jun 19 05:43:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, more big hotels would be great.  I think the height limit on this one is due to being in the flight path for San Jose International."

Problem being, everyone working for the city from garbage man to mayor wants to keep collecting a salary (and eventually a pension) so it's more like an employee-owned non-profit. That sounds nice until you realize the incentive for all public employees is revenue growth. The only way you get a raise whether you're a high-school teacher or a building inspector is for tax receipts to rise. No surprise then if the bureaucracy conspires with private interests to promote ""redevelopment"". Their interests are aligned!"

Or are we talking about the expectation that over time revenue/profits of an organization or corporation will increase?   In the former, I think the expectation is a reasonable one. But if an increase in taxes is the only way to fund wage increases over time, then there was a problem with the budget in the first place, which is usually the case.  In the latter, it is a fallacy of any organization to count on only growth, when we all know life and economies are cyclical. This lack of planning also happens with governments."

SanJose,3ad1j4,ANASTYASSBITCH,10,Fri Jun 19 04:06:02 2015 UTC,"Let me get this straight, you're saying that the solution to our housing problem in the bay area is to have people live in pod hotels?"
SanJose,3ad1j4,ANASTYASSBITCH,5,Fri Jun 19 04:10:07 2015 UTC,"Better than the alternative in the jungle.  I'd rather let folks that destitute have a place they can sleep safely and have a clean shower.  Of course there's many levels above a pod hotel.  I've only seen one place built to what I'd call ""Japanese Style"".  It's a low income place where Campbell Av and Hamilton meet.  Rent is subsidized, cheap, places are tiny.  Edit New York Times did a piece on this, here's a link."
SanJose,3ad1j4,ANASTYASSBITCH,5,Fri Jun 19 04:13:46 2015 UTC,So are you saying that if you are homeless there should be more pod hotel like homeless shelters?
SanJose,3ad1j4,efects,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:09:12 2015 UTC,"The road to homelessness is sometimes filled with hotels.  Back in high school (late 80s) I had a friend who's family went homeless.  They lived in the ""OOh La Lodge"" on the San Jose/Milpitas border.  Back then a person on assistance could afford a sleazy hotel.   The other day I'm down by a sleaze motel on Phelan and Monterrey and noticed it was completely filled with Indians.  Probably some H1-B families trying to get a foothold here, nothing wrong with that.  It did have unintended consequences though. Now a sleaze hotel is $60-70 a night, where as before you'd only pay $25.  These cheap hotels were a safety net for the homeless.    Now I'm not saying pod motels per-se, but maybe something a little bigger than a pod hotel, but a LOT smaller than current hotel rooms. Maybe enough room to stand up in, and enough room for a twin bed and mattress."
SanJose,3ad1j4,stevep98,9,Fri Jun 19 17:24:47 2015 UTC,I feel like it's pretty insulting to tell the people being priced out of the bay area that they should live in what amounts to a human sized kennel. Also if we take your assumption about the Indian families as fact then I believe that speaks more to the tech companies abusing the H1-B program than to the current housing problem in the bay area.
SanJose,3ad1j4,borderhopper90,0,Fri Jun 19 17:44:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think you've ever been homeless. I have.  Not for a long period of time, but for about 3 months when I was 16.  I lived under the Hamiton Av, Los Gatos creek bridge (by the car wash)   I would go weeks without a shower, sometimes it was cold as hell, and when it came time to put on a new pair of socks, the criteria was, ""Which pair is the least crusty?""  I would have gladly rented a small pod if the option was available to me.  You're right about the H1-B stuff though, it is a driving force in the scarcity of affordable housing."
SanJose,3ad1j4,Cheesejaguar,8,Fri Jun 19 17:51:03 2015 UTC,"It is true that I've never been homeless but I don't believe that invalidates my point. I have worked with many homeless advocates and they have consistently said while the jungle was atrocious, it did provide an area where they could they regularly provide service to the majority of the homeless in the south bay. So for the homeless (which are largely mentally ill) a pod like homeless shelter may be a good thing. However, if you are a hard working family with a decent sized living space, with possessions, and you are getting priced out because you don't work in a certain industry then it's pretty insulting to say that they should live in one of these pod type places. Rent control may not be a permanent solution but it can help while more housing is being built."

I agree about the tech boom drying up affordable housing.  Went back through some of your past comments, seems like we've experienced the same thing.  Lifelong friends having to move out because they couldn't transition to the tech life.  Personally, I'm done with it.   No more fucking tech for me.

I got lucky in getting a 2 room for 1100 right by Westgate.  I hear of places that are way more pricey than what i have. Its crazy how prices go up, and when people move out the rent for that available place is either the same price they left at or slightly higher to gain more profit.   I have friends that have moved because of how bad the rent is out here and how super saturated it is."
SanJose,3ad1j4,OleDeadwoodDick,8,Sun Jun 21 23:28:44 2015 UTC,"I'm curious how you vision the cost of a rental unit increasing over time, outpacing the 8% allowable rent increase per year (21% if the previous increase was more than 24 months ago).  It's not like mortgage payments change with time, and property taxes can only increase a maximum of 2% per year.  Why did my landlord raise our rent by 11.5%? Because he could.  So we moved out.    The fact of the matter that greed is the main motivation for substantial rent increases and rent-to-condo conversions."
SanJose,3ad1j4,btreeinfinity,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:16:52 2015 UTC,"Look at how oil prices affected the cost of living in the last 8 years.  We saw the price of everything rise due to increased energy costs.  I remember just 4 years ago a 20oz soda cost $1.25.  Now I see the same soda for $1.79 or $1.99.   You're right, the motivation for the conversion is greed, but when the cities ""rent control"" just gives them more incentive to stop being landlords.  If our rent control contained any kind of ""Conversion control"" then I'd be all for it, but it doesn't.  It's just another tool the city can use to harass older units (built pre-79) out of business."
SanJose,3ad1j4,OleDeadwoodDick,4,Fri Jun 19 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"We have bullshit rent control in san jose.  Properties that are covered by the City's Rent Control Ordinance were built and occupied prior to September 7, 1979.  A list of properties that were built prior to this date can be found here.  This roster may include properties with rent subsidies with government funding and are therefore exempt from the Ordinance.  The multiple housing roster linked above is a previously compiled reference listing of buildings subject to the Ordinance.  It may not include every address in a building or buildings that were exempt at the date of compilation.  Please contact staff at 408.975.4480 if you have questions."
SanJose,3ad1j4,btreeinfinity,3,Fri Jun 19 08:08:02 2015 UTC,It's basically war on older units.  I predict a lot of the low rent/low income housing between Reed and 280 will be the first to fall.  We're already seeing some of the conversion to high rise luxury condos there.  (see the corner of Reed/1st street)

SanJose,3ab72g,PaulMorel,9,Thu Jun 18 22:27:23 2015 UTC,"Not a scam, but as close to it as legally possible. It's called pay-to-play, and it's pretty common in the local music scene across the country. Only the worst event production companies do it, and you definitely shouldn't do it.  Why?  The whole monetary equation is reversed here. Instead of being paid for your work, you are paying to work. The promoter doesn't make their money from ticket sales, they make it by booking acts, so they have no incentive to promote the show. You are paying them to bring people to their crappy bar to buy overpriced drinks.  Do unpaid shows and open calls before you take this. This is bottom of the barrel work. If you do enough free shows, you will eventually find something that pays and is right for you. It might not pay well, but it will be a better start than paying to play."
SanJose,3ab72g,modernviolinist,10,Fri Jun 19 01:23:36 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, was it a person from RAW showcase?  If so, I probably can answer a few questions about it (I did a show for them back in February)."
SanJose,3ab72g,modernviolinist,3,Thu Jun 18 18:40:54 2015 UTC,YES it is!! I'd love to hear about your experience.
SanJose,3ab72g,modernviolinist,6,Thu Jun 18 18:55:59 2015 UTC,"The ticket thing threw me off since you have to sell so many of them, I wasn't a fan of the system to charge to get in.  But the event takes place in a club/bar type venue so I suppose they have costs to cover.  I had a few friends that helped me out by purchasing tickets but I'm not sure if they enjoyed the whole experience or not.  For sales I think it depends on the artwork... At least from what I observed during the show.  I didn't see a lot of sales from artists who charged prices you'd see at typical shows (upwards of $100 for originals).  I did particularly well because I was only selling prints at a cheaper price.  And a few of the artists... I don't want to say were bad, but I felt were not as skillful."
SanJose,3ab72g,modernviolinist,3,Thu Jun 18 19:32:11 2015 UTC,"For the venue itself, it's been in the Motif club on first street the last few times so I imagine it's the same.  The place isn't so well equipped for an art show and they bring in walls for you to hang your work plus additional lighting.  It however does get hot with all the people in a small space plus the added light.  You just kind of have to make it your own space.  And if I had the opportunity to do it again... I'd say it was fine as a first experience but I didn't see much difference in exposure of my work.  It's worth a shot just if you want to see how it is to do a show, but it felt less of a gallery show and more of a normal night at the bar that happened to have artists there."

I'm really interested in the experience, and it seems like from what you wrote it could be unique and worthwhile, even if I only do something like this once in my life. I've participated in a much smaller art show hosted by a company I volunteered for in the past, and I had fun just talking to people, answering questions, and showing off my work.

SanJose,3a9cdm,hella_orange_sauce,7,Thu Jun 18 06:54:12 2015 UTC,I was about 300 meters behind the crash.  I didn't see the actual crash but saw the dust cloud rise up from the shoulder.  Everyone slammed on their brakes and I knew it was going to be bad as I creeped over a shoe sitting in the fast lane 50 meters from the crash.  It looked like the driver had been partially ejected during the roll over and his arm caught in the driver side door.  Wear your seat belts people.  As I went past the first person to reach the driver was running up.  I saw him reach out to touch the body then pull his hand back.  I didn't stop because enough people were on scene and I didn't have my med kit anyway (not that I think it would have helped).

That said, I don't remember if I was caching as StitchesOnQuilts or TeamStitchesOnQuilts in those days, but if the internal documentation suggests it's mine, I'd love to have it back.

EDIT: actually, we moved Naiad out of Vasona Park in late 2002, so that's not it.   We had another one closer to the entrance on a path near the creek before it enters the reservoir, called Dryad.

Take the VTA #10 from Mineta Airport. Ask the driver to drop you off at   First Street and Metro Drive. Across the street on First St, you should see the platform for the Metro/Airport VTA Light Rail Station. Make sure to get on the side that's going south. Be careful here. The track is shared between two routes: One will take you down to the Santa Teresa station. Another will take you down to Winchester. The Winchester train is the one you want to take. You'll know which one to take by looking at the electronic signage on the front of the train. One-way fare is $2.00 for adults, which can be purchased from the ticket vending machine at the platform. After boarding the Winchester train at Metro/Airport, you want to get off at San Jose Diridon, which is about 9 stops. There is a tunnel that leads to the Caltrain and Amtrak train platforms. Good luck and enjoy your visit!    Some resources:    VTA Light Rail Map (The Winchester route is green) VTA #10 Free Shuttle - Map and Schedule"

Growing up I had 3 bikes stolen for doing something as simple as running into 7-11, only to walk out a minute later to see some asshole riding off on my bike.  Right now I live near Brahnam and Jarvis, but typically whenever I lived on the west side, I never once had a bike ripped off.  There's also a difference in how people drive on each side of town.  ESSJ, people drive slower (I'm guessing they're afraid of getting pulled over)  and it can be frustrating as hell when the speed limit is 50, but everyone is poking along at 35.  You can try and live someplace nice in ESSJ, like the East Foothills near SJ Country club, or Silvercreek, but eventually you'll have to come down from your ivory tower.  Not everywhere in WSSJ is great though.  Avoid Payne, Cadillac, David, Williams.    Generally anything along the Los Gatos/San Jose border (Cambrian) is great.  San Jose/Campbell is a mixed bag.

My wife and I are originally from New York (well I'm from NJ) - we moved to San Jose about a year ago. We will be moving back to NYC next month (I got a promotion at my job for our NY headquarters office), and we are selling all of our stuff! We had an open house ""apartment"" sale this past weekend, but we have a lot of great stuff still available (futon, tables, trunks, shelves, decor, rugs, bikes, etc.). We actually made a website fomosale.com, which showcases a lot of the items we are selling - we have a lot more stuff that we haven't yet put up. If you want to stop by sometime to take a look, you are more than welcome!"
SanJose,39vhw1,fomosale,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"fomosale.com   Howdy!  First, congrats on the promotion!  I'm from New York as well, but the other city - Buffalo.  I moved here from Vermont where I was studying for my MA.  NYC is great and I'm sure you'll be very happy!  With that said, I am working on moving myself into a slightly bigger place next month (fingers crossed) As soon as I get that confirmed I will be in the market for some of the stuff that you have posted there.  Although, I could think of a cool project for some of the wall art...I'll contact you through the website or here once I have a better sense of what I would want to buy.    Thanks for reaching out! Best of luck to the both of you as you head back east!"
SanJose,39w25k,robert_cortese,3,Mon Jun 15 07:03:07 2015 UTC,"Before you get into it, wouldn't determining the price of the particular kind of lettuce you intend to grow in the retail and wholesale markets and their relative saturation be part of your business plan?  It really depends on what kind of lettuce you are talking about growing, and if I sound critical, if you're more than musing, I am just really surprised you didn't mentioned this detail in your post.  Romaine?  No, retail it's much closer to $1 for 2 hearts or whole heads, depending on the packaging.  Butter lettuce is commonly produced aquaponically (and with very sophisticated computer controls as you intend), but at $5 a head and purchased for lettuce cups and special salads, it's a small portion of the market (but people who like it like the fact that the lettuce is grown in the eventual packaging and it comes root and all retail.  Butter and red lettuce have a shorter ""useable life"" of the many common types of lettuce, which is an extremely perishable product as a whole, so that's a narrow window to find and deliver while at it's peak.    Of course, starting a new project involving large quantities of water during a drought brings up some other questions, even as I know that moderate to large aquaponic operations can filter and reuse water for ongoing efficiency.  But the current cost of obtaining water in many areas for commercial applications should also be factored into your business plan.  Good luck to you!"
SanJose,39w25k,Pamzella,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:38:17 2015 UTC,Aquaponics uses less water per item then conventional farming. So its saving water if done correctly.    I don't remember if you can be classified as organic or not that makes a difference too.   It is a challenge to find a market for your products  good luck!
SanJose,39w25k,nofishies,2,Tue Jun 16 14:59:42 2015 UTC,"I did make a reference to aquaponics as water efficient-- but that's different from getting the water necessary for starting up a project.

Every weekend high school jocks would roll up in the 5.0 mustangs daddy bought them.  My friends and I sort of considered our group outside of most of the popular HS groups.  We listened to the cure, live 105, dressed in frilly clothes and pierced our ears(We'd be called fags for it). Our idea of fun was going to the all ages clubs like the Vortex or One Step to go dancing at the time.  After one fun night of dancing we ended up at Bravo, and the jocks were there as usual, doing their male aggression displays.  ""WHAT?""   ""WHAT?""  ""YOU WANNA RUMBLE?"" (In the 80's, some 50's vernacular came back in use)  Out of nowhere a bottle flew through the air and smashed into the face of one of Willow Glen Jock.  Reeling from the blow he covered his cheek with his hand, but blood still poured through.  The crowd erupted, and suddenly food, bottles, and fists were flying everywhere.  My friends and I loved our pretty faces too much to risk them getting hurt.  We started walking away when a group of guys came up to us.  ""WHAT SCHOOL DO YOU GO TO?""  ""Ida Price!""  They looked dumbfounded.   Their desire to pound in the face of a member from their rival school shattered, like some of the bottles thrown around that night.  In all there was about 200 people in the parking lot that night.  Campbell PD showed up, and people started running (Including us)   That was the weirdest shit I ever saw at Bravo (besides the staff,  maybe I should talk about when my buddy sold acid to them)"

SanJose,39om0k,Sprechensiedeustch,3,Sat Jun 13 07:14:31 2015 UTC,"Having lived in ESSJ..  There are 2 types of booms you will hear.  One is ""POW"".  It just comes from one direction.  This is usually an explosive.  The other sounds like ""POWOOOOOOOOOOSH!""  That's a bullet.  The explosion can be thought of as a point of air being disrupted, creating a sonic boom when the air crashes back into itself, and a bullet can be thought of as a line of disruption (which is why you hear the OOOOSH of air closing behind the bullet)  As a kid I grew up on the Prune Ranch on San Felipe across from EVC.  It wasn't uncommon for Cortese's to shoot guns.   My dad would often take his Scoped Marlin, use the windowsill as a stock rest, and plink jackrabbits munching in the field.  A lot of folks do fireworks too, but as said earlier, if you listen right you can tell the difference.  One year I went up on Mount Hamilton to watch the fireworks.  Never again.  Wife and I were parked there, and we heard what sounded like small hail hitting the roof of our car.  Turned out someone from below had fired a shotgun up towards the hill, and we were just lucky enough to be at a point of trajectory where the buckshot had lost most of its dangerous energy on it's way back down.  (Kids, don't fire your guns in the air, you have no fucking idea where it will land, shoot into a sandbag if you must)"
SanJose,39om0k,robert_cortese,9,Sat Jun 13 23:36:06 2015 UTC,"Fireworks are pretty common for Asians to celebrate all sorts of holidays, festivals and religious ceremonies.   Having lived in Asia I find American freak-outs about fire works pretty laughable.    When I lived in Taiwan, m80-sized firecrackers in chains of hundreds were an almost weekly thing for holidays, weddings, funerals, building or business inaugurations, etc.  Yesterday was Philippine independence day.  You have tons of Filipinos in the South/East/North San Jose area, so guess what?  June 1st was the Buddha's birthday so every ex-pat from a Buddhist nation (Laos, Thailand, Burma, Cambodian, et al.) was probably celebrating.  Just remember: if you are white/caucasian, you are a minority here, so what you imagine as normal only counts for 1/3 (your proportion of the local population)."
SanJose,39om0k,mantrap2,-4,Sat Jun 13 13:19:13 2015 UTC,"So are you new to the states? In America, a loud boom can mean more than one thing. And Asian Americans are not firearm free.  My mother lives out there and once heard a boom; so did her neighbors. They all assumed it was a firework or a car backfire. The next morning the police were out there cleaning up the body of a guy who apparently took a while to die from a gunshot wound as he dragged himself from the sidewalk up the a neighbor's porch.

She mistook ""I chased them down with my knife"" for, ""Someone's been stabbed."" Flipped out and also called 911 (I had no clue she called too, until the cops showed.) what she told the dispatcher was not at all what I told them. Also our neighbors with the Prius called. For all I know, our neighbors called 911 before us. So 3 phone calls to the same place, and one ""possible stabbing"", that's why they arrived so quickly. They were actually upset for having to waste their resources because they're so stretched thin. Totally understandable. They're definitely appreciated.

People seem to want me to not bring anything because it could be dangerous. Well shit, what do you want me to do? The police aren't going to catch them in time, that's evident given their amazing response time and still no shit birds. I want a gun to feel safer, not to play vigilante and murder. I know I said ""I'm not stabbing a 17 year old"" but really I'm not gonna be stabbing anyone. If I caught those kids I can guarantee I would've just held them and waited for police. The same would happen if I had a gun. Didn't mean to give off a murder-y vibe. I also grew up with guns, I have several rifles that I use regularly but I want a pistol.

SanJose,39k8lm,drewts86,3,Sat Jun 13 00:09:16 2015 UTC,"Is it really ""breaking"" in if the door's unlocked?"
SanJose,39k8lm,Tonicwateronice,5,Fri Jun 12 09:08:21 2015 UTC,"The ""breaking"" in ""breaking & entering"" doesn't have to mean smashing, kicking in or prying open. ""Breaking"" means crossing the plane of a boundary, such as the walls of a business, a window at your home, or in OP's case, the car door. Doesn't matter if it's locked/secured, it's a criminal act to reach into a car even if its window's rolled down, because that's ""breaking"" the threshold of OP's property."
SanJose,39k8lm,efects,6,Fri Jun 12 16:01:31 2015 UTC,"Touché. We didn't have anything to steal. So no doors locked. Nothing in the car but insurance and registration. The police officer told us some folks leave their doors unlocked because, ""Well, they're gonna break in, why let them break my windows/locks, so why not just let them know there's nothing to steal."" Pretty understandable. That's what my step father did. It was his car.   But you're willing to say the same thing if someone left their front door of their home unlocked? ""Well, you left the front door of your home unlocked, so is it really breaking in if I were to come in without your permission, rifle through your shit, and see if I can take anything of value?"" Yeah. That's what I'd call it. You were uninvited. I didn't allow you into my car or my home. Nit pick my words all you want but yeah, that's basically a break in."
SanJose,39k8lm,drewts86,0,Fri Jun 12 09:28:40 2015 UTC,I would still lock my cars. I know this sounds stupid but when i would still lock my doors. There are only 4 bolts and one plug that usually holds a seat down in a car. Few little parts in a car that you could steal off a car if you have the know how..
SanJose,39k8lm,chucky_z,4,Fri Jun 12 13:39:37 2015 UTC,"Most people aren't going to come along and spend the time to unbolt and steal something trivial. Either they want to steal the car or they want to quickly grab anything worthwhile out of the car and be gone. It's unlikely that they're going to come along and unbolt something so trivial as a seat. Generally if someone is going to strip parts from a car they'll steal the car first and strip the parts somewhere else before dumping the car.  And having lived in Mission SF, yes it's a good idea to leave your car empty and unlocked, preferably with a shit factory radio. Worst case scenario a bum crawls in and takes a nap so your car smells like shit. Lock your car and someone might break into it, steal nothing and then a bum comes along to nap in it."
SanJose,39k8lm,SeanBlader,4,Fri Jun 12 14:57:01 2015 UTC,You must be mistaken or not into cars very much. Let's just say you have a nice s2000 man those  factory bucket seats look nice. I bet they would look nice in my civic or integra. Hmm for them to fit all I gotta do is swap rails. 4 bolts and a clip will get it undone.

SanJose,39k8lm,mykol_reddit,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:03:53 2015 UTC,Locking your doors in an s2000 won't stop anything...  The seats don't fit through the doors anyway.  Thieves just cut the roof and steal the seats that way.
SanJose,39k8lm,OleDeadwoodDick,2,Sun Jun 14 05:58:02 2015 UTC,A locked car in his situation leads to a broken window. It doesn't take very much effort to pop a window with the right tool.

Dual stairwells and open areas consumed the majority of the square footage in the center.  Walled offices for the higher level managers occupied the windowed perimeters while the people doing the real work were relegated to the areas between the two, enjoying neither the light of day nor the benefits of proximity to peers.  Thankfully they recognized these limitations and moved to other facilities in the area.  Source: I worked there."

SanJose,39ej9h,robert_cortese,12,Fri Jun 12 00:28:12 2015 UTC,"San Jose was founded by Spanish missionaries.  A lot of our neighborhoods and streets were named after old ranchers who received land grants during this time.  San Jose was the states first Capital, with the idea that it was centrally located.  Sacramento ended up winning out because of it had better ports.  San Jose is considered by many to be one of the best cities for ethnic foods.  The only thing East coast has on us is Italian food, but when it comes to Mexican, Asian food SJ has NY beat.  Did you know San Jose sports the worlds largest flea market?  San Jose used to be called ""The Valley of Hearts Delights"" because of the booming fruit industry.  Up until the end of WWII, it was the main industry here in town, with Del Monte, Dole, and other companies running canning operations here.  San Jose has produced a lot of great athletes.  Bruce/Caitlin Jenner attended San Jose City College.  ESSJ's James Lick produced Walter Payton I think?  San Jose has had a lot more to do with jumpstarting the tech industry than people realize.  During the gold rush Cinnabar (red ore) was mined in Almaden to produce Mercury, which was used in some of the gold mining process. Later, that same mercury was used by IBM for various processes.    San Jose has a Rocket Engine testing facility in the Evergreen hills.  Mt Uhminum was this countries first radar tower, and at the time boasted an airstrip built on the highest elevation of all US airstrips.  San Jose's diversity goes beyond food.  In politics we were first in diversity in many categories.  We had the first Japanese Mayor (Mineta) We had the first woman Mayor of a large city (Hammer) We had the first Viet Vice mayor of a large city (Nguyen) San Jose's open diversity is one of the driving factors in its success.  The Mercury News is one of Californias oldest newspapers."
SanJose,39ej9h,robert_cortese,4,Thu Jun 11 17:45:08 2015 UTC,Awesome facts!
SanJose,39ej9h,OleDeadwoodDick,5,Thu Jun 11 17:49:51 2015 UTC,"I got a lot more.  San Jose had an all electric mass transit system in the past that was superior to today's light rail.  It had direct North to South, East to West routes.  When you drive through Alum Rock Park you can see remnants of the old tracks.  Alum Rock Park for years was a worldwide tourist destination for several reasons.  There was a zoo, giant pool, resturaunts, and a mineral spring health spa.  James Lick High School is named after an Astronomer that built the first observatory above a lot of the ground level atmospheric interference.  He also helped validate the theory of relativity by observing that light will bend around an object of great mass.  Alum Rock Park was one of the states first ""municipal parks""  While the Wright brothers get a lot of credit for flight, some is due to the history happened in Evergreen at Montgomery Hill.  Some of the first manned glider flights happened there.  Speaking of more ""Gender Equality"" and flight  stuff, Amelia Reid was one of the first female flight instructors.  It was her family that started Reid Hillview airport.  Top crop San Jose was famous for?  Prunes.  Where San Jose's Japantown sits today, once sat Chinatown.  Chinatown was burned to the ground, the only building to survive was ""WINGS"".  It became Japantown post WW2 as Japanese internment prisoners with noplace else to go where sent here.  OK I'm out I think...  That was the bottom of the barrel in the Cliff Clavin portion of my brain :)"
SanJose,39ej9h,robert_cortese,4,Thu Jun 11 23:05:39 2015 UTC,"You forgot some of the industrial locations and a few other random facts.   The new SJ Earthquakes stadium is the sight of the former FMC factor (Food Machine Company). They made food processing machinery until 1941 when they stared making military vehicles. In the 1980s they were manufacturing all sorts of military equipment. Most notably the Bradley fighting vehicles. Many of which were involved in Desert Storm. Additionally they made grenades and other armaments.  The Great Mall up until 1986 used to be a Ford plant manufacturing several models including the Mustang.  The location of ""The Plant"" Along Monterey Highway used to be the location of a GE factory. GE had their nuclear division headquarters in San Jose up until about 2003. The factory used to manufacture a variety of components for GE but most notably components for Nuclear Reactors.  ESSJ's James Lick produced quite a few athletes. The Most notable is probably Jim Plunkett.  The Captain of Flight 93, Jason Dahl, was a graduate of Andrew Hill High School and SJSU  The 237 foot tall electric light tower in history park San Jose is a replica of a real light tower constructed in San Jose in 1881. It was the first electric light in the city and was a well known national landmark until it collapsed in 1915.  San Jose City Hall used to look like this. We knocked it down to put up the turd statue since that park is roughly it's former location."

SanJose,39ej9h,Suntory_Black,3,Fri Jun 12 15:19:03 2015 UTC,"Here's something cool you probably don't hear about San Jose and the Silicon Valley, many large tech companies have ""spies."" I had the opportunity to look at many tech companies' R+D offices, and the security is extremely tight. The reason being is that if you want to get information on a new tech or product your competitor is developing, you send a trusted employee to that company to work for them and send back information. You may have heard stories about how Apple will make their employees work on ""fake"" projects until they have spent enough time with the company, well this is why.  While touring some of these offices, I attempted to take pictures of workspaces, and was always asked by the head of security following our party if he/she could review the photos. There are little turnstiles, card readers, keypads, and security checkpoints in these offices to protect the information inside. Many of the buildings were planned to where the ground floor of the building was generally open to the public, and the top floor required the highest security clearance (I usually didn't get to tour the most secured areas, obviously.)   I don't know about you guys, but I found the whole idea of there being corporate spies and tech fortresses super fascinating."
SanJose,39ej9h,nuvistor,5,Thu Jun 11 07:23:15 2015 UTC,"You get extremely different treatment if you're walking in with the intent of getting a company tour.  I've worked in Silicon Valley for over 10 years as a management consultant to top tech companies of their time period (NOT to be confused with a IT contractor/consultant) and my experience with security is pretty much the exact opposite of what you've described. In the majority of cases it is stupidly easy to walk past the receptionist desk/security desk moving with other employees. Doors and elevators with keycard access are not a huge barrier to entry when someone holds it open for you. Turnstiles and staffed security tend to only be used in the one or two buildings where tourists go. The rest of the buildings in a company's campus generally won't have this. ""Top floor security"" is also laughable to me. From a informational standpoint (this won't apply to things like prototype hardware), many VPs and C-class officers are physically working extremely close to IC level employees. If they are in offices, it's like a 50/50 chance of the door being locked or unlocked. If they are working in a open-space layout or low height cubicles...well there's even less of a barrier there. I'm sure there are plenty of tech employees out there who will agree on how lax physical security is for them."

Original Gravity is fun as well. The taps rotate so quickly on the weekend that there was a different menu each time I went for another round.

They offer ""tasters"" of anything you want to try, for no charge (although I tip a buck each).   You know where else is pretty decent, is Cafe Stritch - there's outdoor seating, a room upstairs, the main room goes 'way back so you can get away from the band which can be a bit loud, and I run into the coolest people there like the owner of a used book store I go to a lot.   Plus the jazz is often excellent, and as often as not, no cover. The jam on Sunday night is just plain excellent."

SanJose,39bky3,denizenofmediocrity,-1,Wed Jun 10 17:47:11 2015 UTC,"IMO, Bierhaus is awful.  The beer selection is rather limited, and the prices are obscene.  Its like they looked at everything that Steins (just down the street) did, and choose to do the opposite."

My favorite brewery in the area is Seabright Brewery in Santa Cruz. They have an AMAZING happy hour ($8 pitchers of their microbrew, half off appetizers) and great outdoor seating. Bring your dog, even! You can park there, have a few beers, and walk along the train tracks to the boardwalk for some rides. Its great fun."

He sells several types of worms (ships them nationwide) and grows seedlings of uncommon plants to sell. When I went I think he was growing seedlings for foot-long peppers to sell, I forget what the name of the variety is. His worms are the best value by weight when compared with garden stores in the area, and he has NO competition whatsoever. He talked about getting his son into entrepreneurship too. Apparently the kid started raising box turtles for sale. Anyway, I digress. Worms worked great after I applied some of his trouble shooting tips.

It's just that East Coast-style pizza and calzones have some very specific and appealing qualities (that are easy to find and consistently good, even at dives on the East Coast), and if that's what you want, It's a fucking desert out here.  If you went for Mexican food, ordered a ""beef"" burrito, and got NAVY beans, shredded cole slaw mix, corn, mango, and taco bell-style meat inside a lavosh-style wrap (this actually happened to me on the East Coast), that would be comparable to the pizza experience some transplants are having here."

SanJose,392oip,sj_poly,5,Mon Jun 8 23:02:42 2015 UTC,Perhaps i'm doing it wrong but i have two trash cans in my house.  1 recycle and 1 garbage.  Both have the standard white trash bags in it.  I simply throw the trash bags in there respective collection bin.  The trucks do not do any sorting.  It is taken to a recycling center to sort out.  I'm sure they would rather the recycling not have any bags in it but i also assume that a white trash bag is the least of the abuses of the recycling system.  When i do have extra trash i use a trash sticker for my extras.  Every time i buy more stickers i get a confused look why i'm buying them.  I assume most people do not even know they could get stickers so when you have extra trash you can simply place a garbage bag out on the street w/a trash sticker and they will take it
SanJose,392oip,SoMuchMoreEagle,-1,Mon Jun 8 23:14:18 2015 UTC,Interesting. I have three bins in my house. A 13 gallon trash can that is lined with white trash bags and I use for trash.

I called the city to ask why they weren't emptying my recycle bin and they said because the bags I used needed to be clear.  I was using the white trash bags.  I said there wasn't any note left behind to inform me, and their cust serv rep just said ""just make sure its in a clear bag, they won't pick up any recyclables that cant be seen.""  I went to costco and picked up a lifetime supply of clear bags and haven't had an issue since.

SanJose,3921yf,netllama,2,Mon Jun 8 18:15:23 2015 UTC,I have a sales territory running from southern Oakland to northern San Jose. I was looking at Oakland but it seems like a rough area. I will be commuting to different parts of that territory on different days so I would have to end up in San Jose twice a week either way.
SanJose,3921yf,bobby_guz_man,2,Tue Jun 9 04:18:06 2015 UTC,"Oakland is a OK place to live.  It's not as expensive as San Jose or San Francisco, however it is a much more crime-ridden place.  It is about 4x as violent as San Jose, 2x as violent as SF.  This year alone, Oakland currently has 39 homicides, San Francisco has 24, and San Jose has 8.  To put it in perspective, Oakland has 2/5 of San Jose's population, yet has 5x the homicides.  Which means that you are about 12x times likely to get murdered in Oakland as you are in San Jose.  Oakland has been doing a lot better than before, but you still got to be aware of your surroundings."

I ""quit"" SC Co when my rent went from $2300 to $3000 ""just because"".  You'll still get sticker shock BTW.    I'm assuming you'd look in North San Jose, Milpitas, East San Jose in SC county.  As others have said, much further than that and the commute is 45-60 minutes just to get 10 miles on.  Anything on the West side is going to be even worse."

Commute is bad from Fremont TO San Jose in the morning, and bad from San Jose TO Fremont in the evening.

I know for sure that Gene's Market in Saratoga has them, I'm pretty sure Lunardi's as well and there may be a couple of other grocery stores that do as well, I just can't remember which. My preferred pie is the Olalla berry pie; olallaberries are a hybrid of raspberries and blackberries and they're awesome. If you do go to Pescadero to pick the pie up from the source and you get one of the pies fresh out of the oven it will still be warm by the time you reach home.

Except I knew that wasn't what I had said in my statement, and when I asked them if that's what I had said or not they said ""oh we don't know we just need you to sign this."" Jerks. It took my insurance company a while to get back to them but they dealt with it. But it was super shady and my insurance company was outraged that they did that.

No, your girlfriend doesn't count as a witness. She is a potential claimant (injury) and is not independent. It is your insurance company's job to believe your statement until there is evidence to the contrary. It is hers as well. If my insured said ""I ran the red light"" I would be jumping for joy because red light/green light disputes are messy and contentious.

You'll get a lot of really talented young individuals willing to learn, but keep in mind that it is hard to keep skilled workers on minimum wage around here. Most workers will expect regular pay increases, or they will move on to another job willing to pay them more. The cost of living in SJ is not cheap, so if they move onto another job it isn't because they're bitter-they just have bills to pay. Or you can hire a college dropout like me! :D (I have experience 3d modeling.)"

SanJose,38twrw,thrillhouse13,2,Fri Jun 12 03:58:11 2015 UTC,"Here are the links to the stats:  For the homicide number, it's not hard to find: http://www.mercurynews.com/homicides  For crime numbers for San Jose from 2005 to 2014, you can check this link from the FBI, you're gonna have to dig through a bunch of spreadsheet though, so look carefully, they are there: http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/ucr  Here is SJPD's tabulation for 2005 to 2013: http://www.sjpd.org/CrimeStats/crimestats.html  Here is a good link to look back at 2000 - 2012: http://www.city-data.com/crime/crime-San-Jose-California.html  From the links, I have gathered for San Jose, Oakland, and SF crime numbers dating back the last 15 years (2000 to 2014) for violent crimes (which also includes homicides) and property crimes.  The 2014 year are extrapolated numbers, I can't find the 2nd half of 2014 data from the FBI, so I extrapolated by multiplying the 1st half 2014 numbers by 2.  Very unscientific, but that'll do for now.  .  I do have official homicide numbers for 2014, so they are there in my tabulation:    Homicides (2000 to 2014, commas separating the years):  San Jose: 19, 22, 26, 29, 24, 26, 29, 33, 31, 28, 20, 39, 46, 44, 32  San Fran: 59, 62, 68, 69, 88, 96, 86, 100, 98, 45, 48, 50, 69, 46, 45  Oakland: 80, 84, 108, 109, 83, 93, 145, 120, 115, 104, 90, 104, 131, 88, 86  2012 was the peak homicide year in San Jose's history.  If you look at SF and Oakland, you will also see a jump as well, with SF having 69 from 50 in 2011, and Oakland having 131 from 104 in 2011.  As you can see, it has gone down the 2 years after that in all 3 cities, and for San Jose  this current year of 2015 will be projecting an even lower number than 2014's very low number.  We're currently at 8 homicides this year, meaning if the trend holds we would have 18 homicides for 2015, a lower number than the year 2000, when we had 100,000 less people than now.  A city of a million with only 18 homicides is about as safe as big city goes.  The only city that I see beating us in this regard would be San Diego, who's currently at 7 homicides this year in a city of 1.4 million :)    Violent Crime (2000 - 2014, with commas separating the years):  San Jose: 4928, 5564, 4134, 3378, 3379, 3492, 3561, 3759, 3643, 3439, 3215, 3206, 3547, 3215, 3138  San Fran: 6499, 4573, 6059, 5725, 5757, 5985, 6533, 6414, 6744, 5957, 5747, 5374, 5777, 7064, 6628  Oakland: 5038, 5330, 5661, 5613, 5151, 5692, 7599, 7605, 7905, 6793, 6267, 6652, 7963, 7984, 8208  What we can deduce is that violent crime in San Jose has gone down greatly from 2000 and 2001, and has stayed down at the same level for the last 6-7 years.   As for SF and Oakland, the violent crime rate has trended upward for both cities, with Oakland taking a huge 25% jump from 2005 to 2014, and is still trending upward, while San Francisco has seemed to settle around a new normal of 6600 cases and may trend downward in the future.  Compare that to current violent crime rate in San Jose which is essentially half that of San Francisco and 2.5 times lower than Oakland, and has actually trended DOWNWARD since 2000.    Property Crime (2000 - 2014, with commas separating the years):  San Jose: 17880, 19599, 20005, 20748, 22298, 22930, 24240, 24062, 22298, 22755, 22081, 21972, 28463, 25510, 26964  San Fran: 35675, 26494, 36612, 38163, 35869, 34269, 36992, 34456, 36301, 34509, 32365, 32886, 38898, 48324, 44362  Oakland: 20022, 22297, 24214, 22630, 22185, 23027, 24344, 23664, 21488, 20173, 17325, 20904, 26342, 25176, 24516  Property crime has gone up with a 17.5% increase from 2005 to 2014.  But the bulk of the increase happened during 2012 (that's the year with 28463 property crime cases as compared to 2011 with 21972), but then dropped by 10% the next year in 2013.  At this point, we can at least say that the number has not gone back to the peak and we may have a new normal around 26k of cases.  With the current seesaw from having a drop in 2013 to having a possible uptick in 2014, we cannot say for certain if it is an upward trend or a downward trend as of this moment regarding property crimes in San Jose.  For property crime, you can see a huge jump of ~30% from 2005 to 2014 for San Francisco, with the peak in 2013 but is trending 8% downward in 2014.  Oakland, however, has also trended upward since 2005, but is starting to slowly trend downward the past 2 years, ending in an overall 6.5% increase from 2005 to 2014.  These two cities are slowly trending downward on property crimes, though  San Francisco's property crime cases still dwarf San Jose almost 2-to-1, and Oakland is just the same property crime as San Jose despite being 2/5 the size."
SanJose,38twrw,bobby_guz_man,2,Fri Jun 12 06:54:04 2015 UTC,"By the way, I am not against pension and salary for the cops.  SJPD is the most efficient and still is the best PD in the Bay Area.  SFPD is probably the worst, 2x more officers than SJPD (2,000 vs 850) but all crime numbers are significantly higher than San Jose with a 50% case solve rate, much lower than SJPD.  And then you got Baltimore's 4,000 police officers and their hundreds of homicides yearly making SFPD look like a bunch of hardworking Robocops LOL  But it's a fact that San Jose cannot afford that many cops at the current salary and benefits/pensions.  We made promises we couldn't keep, and unless the cops want the City to declare bankruptcy, reduction in force is what we will all have to deal with.  San Jose is a city with wealthy residents but the city itself is barely breaking even.  This is due to San Jose's last 20 years of building too many service-sapping, low-revenue housing instead of focusing on attracting jobs and companies.    This is a much bigger issue than cops and pensions.  This is about how San Jose's budget can be increased, how San Jose's tax revenues can be increased, for now and into the future.  Ultimately this is about how much money can we pile into San Jose's coffers, and how do the City go about doing so.  If we had a lot of money for both services (libraries, welfare, after school programs, fixing potholes, etc.) and public safety (cops, fire, ambulance) then I do not mind high pensions and benefits for public employees.  But we need to be able to find new revenue sources first (either through new sales tax or attracting more jobs, the latter of which I would prefer but the former will have my support as well).  Ultimately, the crime numbers I listed above are showing us that property crimes went up, while violent crimes took a dive.  This means that SJPD is prioritizing violent crimes over property crimes, and wisely so.  It's much easier to fortify your house and lock your cars, than it is to fortify your face when someone wants to punch it.  But this does not mean that we sit idly by and just ride it out.  What these generally low crime numbers buy us is TIME.  Time for us to think carefully about balancing public services vs public safety.  Time for us to figure out how to get MORE revenues, because the ones we currently have are not going to let us have our cakes and eat it too."

Also there's the story of the Last Emperor of China, who had several wives as well.  Asian cultures have lots of marital cultures that seem foreign to westerners.  Indian pre-arrange marriages for example.  Anglo-Saxons usually only hear of arranged marriages in royalty, but in India it's the norm.  So ya, I guess I was trying to point out that passing judgement on Minh's relationships by labor and the press is a moot point, since there is evidence to support that it is cultural in nature, and not because he can't keep his dick in his pants.  One final piece of antecdotal here, the old owners of 7 Bamboo (Toshi and Sayoko Umehara) were in a polyamorous relationship.  They were married, lived in the same house, but slept in seperate rooms.  Sayoko had her boyfriend, a short Indian man named Deepak, and Toshi had his girlfriend, this perpetually drunk borderline homeless lady named Silvia who looked like Liz Taylor on crack."

While still a child, he ruled as the Xuantong Emperor (simplified Chinese: 宣统帝; traditional Chinese: 宣統帝; pinyin: Xuāntǒng Dì; Wade–Giles: Hsuan1-t'ung3 Ti4) from 1908 until his abdication on 12 February 1912, after the successful Xinhai Revolution. From 1 to 12 July 1917, he was briefly restored to the throne as a nominal emperor by the warlord Zhang Xun. In 1932, after the occupation of Manchuria and Manchukuo was established by Japan, he was chosen in assuming the title of Chief Executive of the new state using the era name of Datong (Ta-tung). In 1934, he was declared the Kangde Emperor (Kang-te Emperor) of the puppet state of Manchukuo by the Empire of Japan, and he ruled until the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1945.  After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, Puyi was imprisoned as a war criminal for ten years, wrote his memoirs, and became a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

SanJose,38twhm,randomusername3000,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:24:30 2015 UTC,"""Being American with Judaeo Christian values, a lot of us could never fathom our presidents having more than one wife.""     Apparently Vietnamese people can't be Americans.  And of course all americans have judeo christian values.  Tell us more about how AngloSaxons are different from asians.  Because white people never have open relationships.  It's because he's asian and not an american, right?"
SanJose,38twhm,SlumberMachine,3,Tue Jun 9 22:42:51 2015 UTC,"So what you're sarcastically trying to say is I'm stereotyping.  Nowhere did I say, ""All Asians do this""  but if we want to get into deeper discussion over the Judaeo Christian rooted in US culture towards polyamorous relationships...   Let's take Asians out the equation for a second.  Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon Church was called ""Sinner"" in his day for his polygamist practices.  He was tarred, feathered, and chased out of his home state till he reached Utah.  He wasn't Asian.  America has been hard on polyamorous relationships.  It's also been hard on Homosexual ones.  I don't agree with it. I don't like how Manh's opponents have been calling his relationship ""non-traditional"" when there's plenty of literature out there to prove it may, in fact be ""traditional""  Sadly this is the history of this country."
SanJose,38r9ct,SugarDaddy29,7,Sat Jun 6 03:22:49 2015 UTC,"Hi, There are lots of tech jobs here in San Jose. The problem is there is also alot of competittion. I am working entry level IT and have found work mainly through a temporary agency called Robert Half Technology.  Rent, 1 bedroom studio? 900-2000 US dollars, depending on location and other factors. If you want really cheap housing you might be able to find something for around 600 a month if your lucky. Location for living, the north of SJ is mainly industrial and corporate business, might be good to live here but might be pricey. West, I would reccomend the western part of SJ, near to campbell and cupertino where I grew up. I am currently living in South San Jose, to my south is a lake called Almaden Lake Park, it is somewhat of a border between civilization and a large mountainous area. From my current location I am very close to Los Gatos and Highway 17 to Santa Cruz. I would prefer to be more west or north.  The EAST! Avoid, unless you are looking for good Vietnamese food or really cheap housing. I am nearing the east SJ where I live but I am more south really. Anything East of HWY 101 or East of Downtown SJ I would avoid. Its not too bad it just has a bad reputation. I had a Girlfriend who lived in East SJ and it wasnt so bad, I would visit her alot, I think she only had one bad experience while walking her dog but I dont think it was actually anything. She said some men chased her while she was walking on a trail nearby a waterway. i dunno.  Must visit places. Visit the Tech Museum in Downtown SJ. Get a burrito at La Victoria Taqueria and some Orange sauce.  Also SJ is a great place because it is in the Bay Area and not far from San Francisco and Santa Cruz. I reccomend going to the Santa Cruz beach boardwalk atleast once. Great roller coasters by the beach. Hot dogs, cotton candy, SALT WATER TAFFY, Churros!  There is great hiking and nature in SJ. Check out Mission peak for a 5 mile hike with an insane view of the bay area in Fremont. Or head to Castle Rock near Saratoga for a nice forest walk or camping.  I have lived in or near San Jose all my life. I could reccomend some great dive bars so you can mingle with local hipsters lol. Cinebar in downtown SJ is awesome(A small bar with cheap drinks and they play a movie on mute with subtitles and usually punk rock music playing).  Old Wagon Saloon at San Pedro Square in SJ is awesome. A western style saloon with lots of seating area and dinning. Outdoor areas with fire pits and outdoor bar and the best part 32oz  beers in huge mugs.  I usually head to Cupertino nearby to hit up Paul and Eddies(Dive bar, cheapest drinks in town, dollar bills stapled to walls, in the back there is an indoor cigarrette smoking area.  Also in Cupertino The Britannia Arms, this place is chill, not too big, great british food and my favorite Irish bartender Morgan. He is an awesome guy. There are also other Britannia Arms bars in other locations around the south bay.  Weather, San Jose is usually dry and moderate temperatures. Most winters are mild here. We do get a rainy season but last one was sparse. The hills are usually yellow from the dry grass but sometimes they turn emerald green :).  Right now the weather is getting quite warm but there is lots of air conditioning in buildings and we have lots of outdoor dining becuase of usually favorable weather. Expect it to be hot or warmer than Canada, I would assume. Never been, I would love to go. My friend and I had an idea to drive to Canada and get drunk when we were underage. Sadly we never made it!  Also if you are looking to hang out with some people I could also recommend downtown Campbell. Great places to eat and great bars. Often times during holidays or special events they block the streets and allow for drinking on the street. Last festival in Campbell was a Blues music and Cajun food festival. There is also a nice Octoberfest celebration there with live music and great food.  Good luck with your adventures California and the bay area is a very diverse place with many different cultures I am sure they would receive you well."
SanJose,38r9ct,Sultanoshred,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:23:34 2015 UTC,"Hi Sultanoshred!  Thank you so much for the very detailed and informative reply!  I definitely learned a thing or two from reading it.    It seem like south/west San Jose is a good place to look for apartment, but I am concerned about driving distance to potential employers.  As far I know, there are a lot of Software Developer job in Silicon Valley, so I would need to drive there daily (or wherever I find job).  And I will not be able to live too far away.  I am trying to aim for $2500 for 2 bedroom, with a maxim of 30min compute time to work.  Is this doable or am I in fantasy land?    As for places to visit, I'll definitely check out the Tech Munsum and Santa Cruz beach boardwalk, seems right up my alley.  I am actually kind of surprised by the amount of parks in the surrounding area, I'll definitely check out Mission Peak Regional Park.  Any good amusement park or activities in the area?  Maybe I am just a nerd but I am into that type of stuff."
SanJose,38r9ct,b0r0n,5,Sat Jun 6 05:13:00 2015 UTC,"As a Canadian who recently moved to San Jose, I can say your rent budget is reasonable for San Jose but could get tight in some of the other areas like Cupertino or Mountainview. Your commute goal is possible, but unlikely. It really depends on where you get to work. I live in South San Jose and work in Sunnyvale. It's a 25 minute drive without traffic, but close to an hour in rush hour. In retrospect, I would have preferred spending a bit more on rent and lived close enough to walk or bike to work."
SanJose,38r9ct,sparky222b,2,Sat Jun 6 05:25:30 2015 UTC,Hi B0r0n  Yes I completely agree with your assessment.  I am also willing to pay a little bit more to live closer to work up to a reasonable price.
SanJose,38r9ct,Sultanoshred,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:32:09 2015 UTC,"If you're OK with public transit, there are a lot of employers clustered along the Caltrain corridor all the way up the peninsula. Living in downtown SJ makes this available to you."
SanJose,38r9ct,nofishies,2,Sat Jun 6 06:21:08 2015 UTC,"Ok, 30 min drive in the south bay is possible. You may want to look into the other areas surrounding San Jose. There is some great housing in Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Milpitas. All within 30 min driving time from San Jose. The cities I listed are more northward but that gives you access to the peninsula and other areas. I see lots of people getting 3 bedrooms for 2500, you will be able to get a nice 2 bedroom for that price around here. It can be expensive but its not all that bad.  As for amusement parks, check out Great America(in Santa Clara/northern border of SJ). Also during the summer there is a water park called Raging Waters in San Jose.  If you are into baseball or other sports it is easy to take the train to San Francisco. The Caltrain will drop you off right near the SF Giants stadium. Also they just finished building Levi's Stadium, also in Santa Clara, for the 49ers Football team. I hear the next superbowl will be there.  SJ right now also has a soccer team and some minor league baseball teams. Also LOTS of hockey fans here. We go crazy for the SJ sharks at the HP Pavilion aka Shark Tank. I hear hockey is big in Canada :).  Also alot of my friends are going crazy over the Golden State Warriors Basketball team making it to the playoffs. I am not that big a fan of basketball though :P. They are located in Oakland which is quite a distance. relatively the same distance as San Francisco but in the east bay.  Also make sure to check out the Baylands in Mountain View. It is the most southern part of the San Francisco Bay and it is a wildlife refuge. Lots of birds. You will probably drive by Google on your way to the Baylands also.  In Mountain View near that area there is also the Shoreline Ampitheater which is a great venue for live music and other events. I would also reccomend the Mountain Winery in Saratoga for live music."

Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Milpitas, Fremont. Everywhere is pricey. If you're looking for a relatively cheaper rent, east side SJ isn't too bad but the neighborhoods aren't amazing.   But... given you are in the software development industry, I can assume you're making around 100k so that is more than enough to live decently in the area."

If you're worried about how to get there via public transit, it's easy: Take Caltrain all the way up to 4th and King (the SF station), and transfer to the 47 bus to Van Ness and O'Farrell. Or you can take the 30 or the 45 to the 38 or 38R. You can also just walk down 4th to Market and hop on the 38/38R. There's a Whole Foods and a Target along the way in case you need something quick to eat.   Sorry I can't help more than by offering public transit directions -- I live in SF."

If it is an asian language then it should be no problem for him to go to the senter road costco as there is always employees who can translate for him.

Not a taco stand but the best tacos around san ho...if your looking for a legit taco stand, hit downtown on a weekend night and those stands are every block or so serving decent grub. The dude in front of SJ Bar and Grill makes a pretty mean taco and has been stationed there for quite some time."

My have a very loud, obnoxious neighbor that will throw insanely loud parties late into the night. I call the cops a lot.  I've had them show up in 5 min. Sometimes it take 2 hours. Usually they have someone swing by in 20-45 min.

They've got a screen full of calls in their car, 20-30 deep, all day long.  The officers have to prioritize as best they can... weapons, violent crimes in progress, people bleeding, these get first priority.   Property crimes and noise complaints can't always be answered right away.  We were told that there's as much as a 24 hour delay on car thefts and vandalism reports.  This being said, we were encouraged to call the police every time there was suspicious activity going on.  The city keeps a log of calls, and several times a year this log is reviewed to ensure each beat is appropriately staffed for its level of calls.  More calls means more officers for your beat.  Last year, Burbank got an extra officer just for this reason, though that officer spends part of his time sharing two beats.  Keep calling in!  Just don't sit around waiting if you don't have to.  The officers sure aren't..."

They didn't cut me a check when I moved in (sadly), LOL. Is it because so many Googler's are here, that the impression is that MV is a ""rich"" city?  But yes, our cops ARE bored. I'm so used to the abusive San Jose cops, that when I saw a MV officer roll into a parking lot with his lights on and approach a gentleman on a bike, I listened in out of curiosity. The cop was like ""it's almost dark, and you don't have lights on your bike. Do you want to borrow my flashlight so you get home safely?"" I thought that was pretty awesome."
SanJose,38f1cf,Dom_the_Wop,2,Thu Jun 4 13:21:33 2015 UTC,"I only mention Mountain View because I had my car broken into there once and the police actually responded and took fingerprints; whereas other cities just tell you to file a report on the webpage so you can get a case # to put on the insurance claim.

SanJose,388ife,robert_cortese,16,Tue Jun 2 18:13:49 2015 UTC,"I believe /u/WarmAsIce is displaying his discontent with Hevy Kuete.  From a personal analysis, Hevy Kuete is a phonetic play on the words, ""Heavy Cutie""  One has to wonder, what is the significance of this tag?  Is it a political statement taking a jab at body image issues, and fat shaming?  Is the author trying to convey that fat people are beautiful, and everywhere, by leaving their tag everywhere.  Full figured may not be #1, but it's still gold?  Could Heavy Cutie be the next banski?  No, just some fucking inbred piece of shit not making a dent in this world, other than the millions of dollars we collectively pay in taxes a year to clean up after him.  Not real graff, just some shitty ass tagging.  Edit Thanks for the gold!  While I'm on my soapbox here..  Personal anecdotal. I knew a lot of taggers in my youth in the 90's.  Basically a who's who of San Jose political and wealthy families.  Tagging supplies and travel to sites isn't cheap.  It's a huge misconception that it's done mostly by poor inner city youth."

SanJose,388ife,robert_cortese,5,Wed Jun 3 03:52:42 2015 UTC,"I wonder if you're as old as I am...  My generation learned that there's a difference between graffiti, and tagging through a movie called Beat Street.  I was about 11-12 when it came out.  Anyways, TL;DR.  In the movie there's a graff artist name ""Ramo"" who makes these beautiful graff murals.  There's some dickhead named spit that keeps fucking them up.  Ramo finds spit, chase ensues, they trip in the subway and die electrocuting on the 3rd rail.  Graffiti is Graffiti, Tagging is tagging.  One is art, the other is the spray can equivalent of lifting your leg and pissing on something like a dog.  Then again, I'm old, maybe it's not like that anymore.  Get off my lawn."
SanJose,388ife,konatwopointoh,0,Wed Jun 3 04:35:38 2015 UTC,"Tagging is the buttery essence of graffiti, graffiti is a way of ""getting up"" it's not art, sure they put nice things in pieces sometimes but it still boils down to getting your name out there. And graffiti as a culture is just putting your name anywhere and everywhere for the infamy. And that's what tagging is, graffiti artists start out with tags and move up. The tag is one of the most important parts of graffiti, anything that's on a wall with nice pictures or quotes is generally street art which is another thing entirely. But saying tagging isn't graffiti is wrong."
SanJose,388ife,konatwopointoh,2,Wed Jun 3 05:06:10 2015 UTC,"Meh I'll just say I respectfully disagree with you here. This blue sprayed tag isn't very artsy at all.

Morro Bay / SLO area is pretty awesome."

We both work from home so there is no reason (other than friends/lifestyle) to stick around. We're kind of waiting for our neighborhood comps to hit a certain number then we'll seriously consider getting out of the area (and paying cash for a nice place is one of our alternate cities).   Sounds great, but we lived through the first bubble and spent 12 years saving for a downpayment among rising rents as grad students. Feels nice to be on the other side now.

I don't know if that is private or public property.  There may be no law preventing people from telling you that they will do something. I could tell you I'm going to steal your bike, or scratch your car, and that's probably not illegal, but actually stealing your bike or scratching your car is illegal.

From age 16 to 22 we played shows across the bay area and every one of them was at a loss. We were lucky to cover gas costs. Living at home allowed us to be financially irresponsible. Now we have to support ourselves. Being a touring musician just doesn't fit into that picture.

SanJose,380i9i,shuebacca,3,Mon Jun 1 22:48:58 2015 UTC,"Why? Because the government invests too much money in overpriced software because the vendors promise turn key solutions to a problem the department is incapable of solving for itself.  This isn't just bill pay software. It's an entire enterprise management system you're seeing a small part of, and the department is locked in to the vendor it first invested with. It's now even more costly to upgrade to get all of the old data out, while remaining compatible with the existing systems and retrain everyone on a new system.  No upgrades will happen until people get angry.  Technical Addendum: The software is actually a component of Oracle PeopleSoft, which is basically the gold standard in enterprise resource management software, familiar to virtually everyone who's worked in large corporations. It's incredibly expensive and designed to touch every component of a business, including interoperation with other companies who use it. To move away from PeopleSoft would mean buying into A: an entirely new ERP package for the entire business or B. a very expensive custom extension to make the website compatible with the PeopleSoft backend. Because people pay bills here, the information gets managed directly in the department's financial management workflow. You can't just tack on a random bill pay software package to this system."

I look forward to seeing garbage move to the property tax bill, but in the meantime, I've taken to paying my bill by mail and making a large overpayment so that I don't have to do it very often. Even when I mail it in, I think it's unfortunate that the City of San Jose chooses to handle local utility payments through some fulfillment center in Arizona. I'm sure that there are San Jose residents that would appreciate being employed to handle those payments."

Residents of San Jose will be paying a trash bill at least until the end of this year. There is nothing wrong with making a few payments in advance to prevent having to pay every two months. If you pay $240 instead of the normal $60, you pay for 8 months of service. The government is NOT getting extra money over a given period of time. They're just getting it a little earlier than they normally would."

There's also some indoor fields such as CQB City and some others I can't recall off the top of my head. There's also two local stores that you can visit if you want to meet more players(AirsoftExtreme in Santa Clara and DogTag Airsoft near Santana Row).

The only way to make traffic better is to make it better in your own head. I creeped your profile and it looks like you are into sports and fitness. There are endless podcasts on both.

Some things are cultural - for example, turn signals are banned in the bay, and in Boston honking your horn means ""I see you"" or ""see me"" instead of the hyper-aggressive ""fuck you"" it means in the bay.  Additionally, the concept of a passing lane seems foreign to most california drivers, although I attribute some of that to confusion with respect to HOV lanes (if the leftmost lane is HOV, the 2nd left lane is the passing lane)."

It’s a nice new park, but that’s f’in crazy.   I take it back. It’s a total sterile codddling nanny park.  The floor is super bouncy material soon to be torn up under the feet of our youth.   All the spinning , cetrifugal rides have speed governers installed! You can’t physically spin them faster than a walking speed.  Kids are yelling faster faster as adults get winded trying to exert any hair lifting speed.  There is a trampoline which looks awesome, but isn’t really a trampoline. Kids try to jump on it, but its engineered to barely move .  We’re going to have a generation of wimps.  I applaud the city of Berkley and there hands on adventure park comprised of used pallets, rusty nails and ankle twisting zip line into a mountain of dirt.  See… http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/adventureplayground/  I took my kids there and they didn’t want to leave. We came home with skinned knees and ear to ear grins. My kids were more than happy to leave the san jo park.   There is no shade! 6.5 million dollars and no trees or shade structures. 2 of the human powered kinetic sculptures were already ‘out of order’ I’m sure it will win some design awards, but its they traded away much fun."

Food you must try: La Villa on Lincoln Ave in Willow Glen. This is an old styled Italian Deli with amazing food prepared fresh and hot every day. Yuki Sushi in Willow Glen is also really good. If you want amazing Mexican food then try Tu Mero Mole off of Union and Bascom. Don't order Carne Asada or chicken. It is perfectly fine but you should order the goat or lamb. So worth it."

Also, San Pedro Square Market is a good place to grab some food beer and use the WIFI, a little longer of a walk but walkable for sure from ISO Beer.  You can go to Japantown for sushi, but the better places you might need a car/Uber to get to. Tomi sushi in Santa Clara is great, Yuki in either Santa Clara or Willow Glen.

SanJose,37i8wn,tehvolcanic,3,Thu May 28 17:44:41 2015 UTC,Go ahead and give it a try.  Let us know how it turns out.
SanJose,37i8wn,NikkoTheGreeko,0,Thu May 28 19:03:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, six years ago today I was homeless.  I spent a year living with my 2 year old son in my truck in the woods.  Just this month I bought a 4 bedroom house on several acres.  If someone gave me a roof over my head I would have never had the motivation to get my shit together."
SanJose,37i8wn,NikkoTheGreeko,5,Thu May 28 21:07:02 2015 UTC,"I found the first job I could and took it.  I moved two states away for minimum wage in the shipping/receiving area of an online computer sales company.  I eventually started taking apart machines to sell the parts, and later fixing customer computers.  Gained some job skills and switched employers a year later to another company that had better opportunities for advancement.  Moved up in that company, began managing one of the computer repair shops.  While there I taught myself to write software and switched careers again as a computer programmer (same company, different department).  I now work from home and I can afford to let my new wife enjoy a career as a stay at home mom.  I did an AMA a few years back, one of my first submitted posts.  Things have moved forward even further since then."
SanJose,37i8wn,OleDeadwoodDick,4,Thu May 28 21:15:05 2015 UTC,"People don't respect what they don't own. Sure some homeless will benefit from this, those that actually want to better their lot in life. The rest who are actually comfortable with being homeless (and choose that life) will trash and abuse the generosity."
SanJose,37i8wn,cmccormick,3,Fri May 29 01:51:24 2015 UTC,Maybe. In my opinion there needs to be a barrier to entry such as a minimum number of hours worked (volunteer or not). That's had mixed results with Section 8 rental housing in NYS (they pay a very small % of rent rather than working). As you point ownership definately matters...I'm a landlord with a tenant that's planning to buy the house eventually and he's constantly thinking of improvements and carries some out himself.
SanJose,37i8wn,OleDeadwoodDick,1 point,Thu May 28 07:42:50 2015 UTC,"At the least I'd like to see a 2-month minimum before they get booted out, mandatory drug testing (with random intervals), mandatory curfew (exceptions for work related schedules), limited guests, home inspections (to protect the property) and proof of looking for a job. Additionally, I think homeless should have to apply for the housing and applicants with no criminal record (at the very least no felonies), recent employment (within last year), and proof of citizenship (mandatory, illegals need not apply) should be pushed to the front. Strict requirements are mandatory for something like this. You want to get the best members of the homeless society and a high turnover rate. Otherwise they will be overrun with bums and addicts."
SanJose,37i8wn,iKs279,2,Thu May 28 16:56:34 2015 UTC,"All your requirements will increase the bureaucracy (costs) of the system and essentially prevent any of the long term homeless from using the system. Some might even have negative side effects (e.g. drug tests: if you're a drug addict you don't just decide to stop doing drugs, and being on the streets probably makes your problem worse)"
SanJose,37i8wn,OleDeadwoodDick,2,Thu May 28 21:15:04 2015 UTC,That's the point. Keep the long term hobos and druggies out of the homes. But really the whole idea is just going to be an expensive bureaucratic mess. Government is horribly inefficient and in the first place it is not the duty of government to give out welfare.
SanJose,37i8wn,iKs279,2,Sat May 30 12:48:13 2015 UTC,"The ""long term hobos and druggies"" are exactly the type of people who would benefit from being given housing first, so that their other problems can actually be addressed.  If you agree that it's government's job to provide security for other citizens and to guarantee a bare minimum (emergency room) care so that people aren't left to die, then you realize that government would pay less if they paid for housing for these people than if they waited for them to spiral downward and cost it more."

SanJose,37hbzt,aydiosmio,3,Wed May 27 21:35:53 2015 UTC,"""nah, lets just piss everyone off""   Not one cab had a sign, not one banner hung, not one word uttered. It was just 30 minutes of the horns of 100+ cabs. No one near city hall knew what the fuck those cabbies wanted.  It was a dick move, a pointless protest and I expected nothing less from the taxis in this city."
SanJose,37hbzt,JayrassicPark,3,Thu May 28 13:53:32 2015 UTC,The one advantage the local taxi cabs have is that their fares remain the same when Uber and Lyft decide to go bonkers with surge pricing. I'd have spent 70+ dollars to get home on New Year's Day if I took a rideshare.
SanJose,37hbzt,SniperGX1,13,Thu May 28 01:43:08 2015 UTC,I think the protest is the taxi companies are handicapped by taxi regulation while Uber is currently non regulated.  So they are pissed that they have to follow the law while companies like Uber and Lyft don't have to.
SanJose,37hbzt,OleDeadwoodDick,8,Wed May 27 21:57:33 2015 UTC,"This. Uber and Lfty don't have to meet the same regulations a cab company has to make. Therefore the cost of a cab ride is always going to be more. They are essentially handicapped by the government so they can't compete with a better system like uber/lfty. If you ask me, the government shouldn't be regulating cabbies so they can try and compete more with uber/lyft."

Navy-suit said the San Jose airport is considering a deal with Uber that would allow them to operate in an organized manner at the airport rather than continuing to issue cease and desist orders. It would mean Uber paid the airport to operate there, and from what he said sounds like a smaller share than what is currently charged cab companies."
SanJose,37hbzt,aintnoshameinmygame,9,Wed May 27 17:39:06 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, I wonder how this would affect Uber prices from the airport. I'm in City Hall now and heard the hour long honk-fest. My only experience with cabs in the area is from the airport to my house. A cab is regularly $30-35 with 20% tip, an Uber is always under $15 including tip. Any idea if the minimum fare from the airport is by law or is that just put in place by the taxi companies to recoup some of the cost of paying to operate at the airport?    I moved from Colorado and the cab companies are notorious there. They kick you out if they don't think you are going far enough, even up to 5 miles away. The dispatchers are all rude and cabs only come about 50% of the time if you call. I feel bad for many of the migrants who can get a decent job with these companies but the companies themselves provide horrible customer service and take advantage of the cheap labor by charging huge fees to drivers. The companies can go fuck themselves but what is the alternative for drivers if they can't get qualified for a loan to get their own car?"
SanJose,37hbzt,JayrassicPark,4,Wed May 27 18:12:52 2015 UTC,"There are at least two agencies that provide hybrid cars to people who need a car to drive for a rideshare at rather reasonable prices, too."

What city is work in? (Cisco is everywhere...) FYI- you will have to drive EVERYWHERE. It is what's convenient all the time. So-- assuming you are near the offices near Montague, 40 minutes away definitely limits your options, but I'm thinking near Downtown Campbell is your best bet if you are working up 880. It's only about a mile from being not technically SJ, but the nightlife is quite good in your age range. I am not familiar with housing prices there though. I think that's my best advice to give you!"

SanJose,37j72o,ImalikeSJ,2,Thu May 28 16:54:49 2015 UTC,I suggest considering the area around Japantown in San Jose. It's a bit small but definitely on the up. It's along VTA and is also close to downtown for nights out. Great spot to be if you like riding your bike.
SanJose,37j72o,magelanz,4,Thu May 28 14:05:58 2015 UTC,"Downtown SJ isn't bad. You might like it. But spend a night out once before deciding.  Personally, I would live in downtown Campbell, and take the VTA light rail up to the Tasman/1st St. stop. You'd never even need a car. That area of Campbell is totally walkable with TJ's down by Pruneyard and Safeway down Winchester, and lots of shops and restaurants in between. Not many bars and nightclubs though, if that's what you're looking for.  Campbell isn't too expensive. $2200 could get you a studio or 1-bedroom."

SanJose,37j72o,cardinal2007,1 point,Fri May 29 01:01:42 2015 UTC,"$2200/mo is roughly what the average 1bd is in downtown San Jose. So if you want less than $2200, then you're looking at either a studio or older housing, the good thing is that in downtown average is early 90s housing, so you can get something from the 70s or 60s for cheaper, in a lot of cities housing from the 70s is the norm though.  There are a ton of young people downtown when SJSU is in session, but not so much now. As for nightlife, in the South Bay DTSJ will be your best bet, there are more bars, and clubs here than elsewhere (but don't expect there to be a ton of clubs).  Seriously based on what you said I would suggest downtown San Jose. Taking light rail from downtown to Tasman and 1st would be just shy of 30 minutes. If you don't want a long commute on light rail, don't move anywhere further from Virginia or Diridon on the light rail line, that includes downtown Campbell, which would be too long a commute.  So given what you said I would suggest either downtown, or just directly north of it, but less than a mile from downtown, so you can still walk to places, especially if you want to drink at night."

Your work is near the Guadalupe River Trail and VTA Lightrail (and kind of close to 237 and 101 in terms of highways). I propose:   Downtown San Jose: pros are that you can take the Guadalupe River Trail from there as well as VTA light rail and that it's walkable, it's also super well connected to everywhere else below using public transportation; cons are the rent prices and the semi ""sketchy"" feel you get compared to the other options (it feels like a big city) Japantown: pros are that it has its own restaurants/shops in addition to being close to DTSJ, it's also near the GRT and VTA LR but it feels a bit prettier/more suburban than DTSJ, con is that Japantown is pretty small and not as well connected to other parts of the Bay as DTSJ (through Caltrain, for example) Downtown Campbell: pros are that it feels nice and has a small downtown, it's near LR (but it's half as frequent down there) and technically it's near the Los Gatos Creek Trail which kind of (for now) connects to the GRT. The main con is that it's significantly farther so it'll take longer using any mode and in particular I'd expect more traffic if/when you were to drive. Willow Glen: pros, nice little downtown, near LGCT, kind of close to VTA LR, closer to DT than Campbell, con is that it's a bit further from all the transportation options North SJ: pro, super close to your work, technically you could invert what I wrote above and get to DT using LR, con, nothing to do/ugly"

Eventually Mel Cottons will be converted too, as soon as they go out of business from Bass Pro Shop. (Just like Home Depot and lowes put out Southern Lumber)   Not going to happen -- Mel Cotton's wanted to stay by occupying ground floor retail space and having residential on top, but the council wouldn't budge as it would have set a precedent for other Industrial>Residential conversions in the area. Remember that it's the land owners that benefit from conversions, as properties zoned for residential are way more valuable (in this case it was something like 4 times more valuable if the conversion was approved)."

If we really needed housing so bad, we should have just left the zoning at Almaden Ranch (Bass Pro Shop) alone as residential and built housing there.

Besides, even he can't predict what scenario might come your way (Is there roadwork on the route and will you remember to go 25mph?) Your best bet is to keep driving in challenging areas that present various scenarios and puts you on full alert (school zones, yields, right on red, no right on red, pedestrian crosswalks without lights and high foot traffic) so that the test actually seems easy to you compared with what you've already dealt with in the past.

Maybe he left his baton in the car or maybe adrenaline  got the better of him.

The report is filled with reasons why the officer who used lethal force didn't use his less-lethal options, and the first officer tried to taze the suspect, but due to either the suspect's multiple layers of clothing, the fact that he was on meth, or a combination, the tazer didn't do its job and had no effect on the guy.   When a guy is charging your partner with a sharp weapon, and your partner is back peddling trying to get away from the guy, then lethal force is unfortunately the best option. Sucks, but it had to be done to stop the threat who was likely going to seriously hurt or kill a cop."

So, no surprise, there's a video that the lawyer went ahead and watched on your behalf. Wouldn't want to upset you. Wouldn't want you to come away with anything short of glowing admiration of the professional's professionalism. And no surprise that the report lacks any analysis of less lethal options -- such as the baton, ideally suited for disarming a high person with a pointy object -- because the report's job is to provide comforting answers, not to raise uncomfortable questions.  It's great that some video evidence exists and could be used to impeach the report. Otherwise they could have gone ahead and reported that the guy was waiving an uzi."

There's absolutely nothing unique about /r/SanJose in this, nor regarding this particular topic. It's just life.   That's just life on this site. It used to be a windmill that I tilted at, but it's just a useless fight, like arguing about whether something is ""really"" irony."
SanJose,374jvq,Willravel,17,Mon May 25 05:17:08 2015 UTC,"/r/sanjose has real issues with it comes to law enforcement. It's starting to become sectarian, moving to the extremes both of supporting the police absolutely no matter what or looking at the police with absolute skepticism. The result is that commentors wildly speculate in opposite directions, and frankly miss the mark more often than not.   Based on what I can glean from the few articles about this situation, the man allegedly charged the police with a drywall saw and was shot twice in the back, and may have had a small amount of methamphetamine in his system.   One guy comments that the man who died was a 'meth tweaker', and dismisses him as completely expendable. Another guy posts that the cops summarily executed the man. Neither of these conclusions can be reached from the available information, and simply stoke the fire (something we used to call ""flame bait"" back in the early days of the internet)."
SanJose,374jvq,Lt_0bvious,6,Mon May 25 03:05:54 2015 UTC,"Now there is a word that I failed to include in my original post: speculation. The comments in the linked post were all pretty much based on speculation, on very few details. You're right, despite being on opposite ends, both comments mentioned are dismissive of the situation. They're basically no different from YouTube or news site comments. I feel like people forget that police officers go through extensive training before getting to be where they are now. There's a good chance that the lethal force used was used strategically. Despite the rising crime rate here, San Jose is still a pretty damn safe place to live.  The growing public mistrust towards local law enforcement is just a reflection of the national sentiment. We're afraid that another Michael Brown Ferguson incident will take place here in the 408. Only a few weeks ago, there was an incident involving a group of police officers beating down on a suspect with fists and a baton. This incident was recorded by some bystanders. Was the beating justified or excessive?"
SanJose,374jvq,Moritasgus2,2,Mon May 25 03:32:19 2015 UTC,"All of the people protesting this shooting, however, refuse to read the DA's report.

SanJose,374jvq,Moritasgus2,2,Mon May 25 05:48:22 2015 UTC,"I don't see how that means that the man was a meth tweaker who deserved to die. Do you see what I mean? Both of those posts are symptomatic of this weird, extreme, disconnected-from-reality reaction to anything involving cops.   Were the cops justified? I honestly have no clue. The photographs don't make the situation cut and dry, which is why you have people seeing the exact same thing and reacting differently. It's possible that the cops acted in a responsible manner and they were forced to use deadly force as a last resort. It's also possible, given that he was shot in the back while charging the police, that the official story may not reflect the situation. I'm not going to pretend I know, and neither should anyone else.   If nothing else, this seems another example of where body cameras which capture the police perspective of a situation (with video and audio) and which cannot be disabled by police should be on every cop."

How is this not cut and dry?   Because he's running from a guy pointing a gun at him. Or he's running toward the cop to stab him.

I don't get what you're saying. The officer wearing the body camera is back peddling away from the suspect with the knife while the officer behind the suspect is about to shoot him in order to save the camera-wearer's life.  I think it's tragic when anyone has to be killed, but I don't understand how this can be more clear. There is video that certain people (from the DA to investigators to even family and friends of the person killed) viewed, and in my opinion, the report along with the stills from the video point to one conclusion: the shooter acted in defense of his partner's life. Based on the evidence we have, it's a stretch to argue anything else happened."
SanJose,374jvq,hella_orange_sauce,10,Mon May 25 06:34:18 2015 UTC,"I find both that comment and the top comment to be particularly callous.  A man died without a chance to reform his life, and someone had to shoot him.  It's a tragedy no matter how you look at it for all parties involved."

SanJose,374jvq,Lt_0bvious,9,Sun May 24 21:15:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, callous towards the police officer.  I wasn't there but I doubt most officers go to work hoping to shoot a man with drug and/or mental issues or be put in a life threatening situation.  On the other hand it's terrible that this guy had drug/mental health problems and died as a result of it.  I'm not saying he was an upstanding citizen, it's just a bad situation all around and off-hand comments about ""execution"" or ""one less maniac"" don't help the discourse on this sub."

SanJose,374jvq,hella_orange_sauce,3,Mon May 25 06:20:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/Moritasgus2 regarding that top level comment and its child comment both being callous. In a situation like this, no one really wins, especially with this sort of outcome. On the one hand, SJSU students and other people in the area no longer had to fear for their safety after the escalation. On the other hand, Josiah, the shooting victim's 4-year-old son, will now grow up without a father.  I read the Factual Summary and feel like they're leaving out major details. Time references were only provided for three events (The following statements copied verbatim):   ""On February 21, 2014 at 10:55 a.m., a San Jose State University student called 911 and reported, ""I was just over by the print shop and there's like a bum over there with some sort of knife like stabbing the air and doing a bunch of crazy stuff."" ""At 11:04 a.m., San Jose Police Department (SJPD) dispatched officers to the scene."" ""Guzman-Lopez was driven to Valley Medical Center and pronounced dead at 11:33 a.m. by Dr. Jou.""   Some thoughts regarding the Factual Summary:   There were two officers that initially responded to the call: Sgt. Santos and Officer Van Der Hoek (VDH). VDH wore a shoulder-mounted cam. The cam began recording initially, but the sound wasn't turned on until later. Maybe someone could explain if this was standard operating procedure, but I find it unusual to have video on but audio off. Based off a tip that the suspect was armed with a weapon, Santos immediately drew his firearm and pointed it towards Guzman-Lopez. Again, maybe someone could chime in, but it is to my knowledge that police protocol dictates that you point your firearm at a suspect only if you intend to fire. This is where more details were needed. How much time has passed since the police arrived and caught up with the suspect? What was the physical distance between the officers and the suspect? It would make perfect sense to immediately draw and aim your weapon if the suspect was a few feet away, but no measurements of distance were provided in the summary. Also, there was a comment in the original Reddit link stating that the officer initially used non-lethal force before resorting to his firearm. This isn't technically true as mentioned above. The suspect wasn't yet injured lethally, but he was threatened with a firearm. VDH later drew his taser gun and fired at the suspect's chest, but failed to disable him. Fearing for his life, that's when Santos fired two shots and killed Guzman-Lopez. The suspect was 15 feet away from VDH when the officer fired the taser at him. I remember the Tueller Drill being mentioned on Reddit stating that a knife wielder can fatally attack you about 20 feet away from you. So why didn't VDH also have his firearm drawn instead of his taser? Again, no distance was given to help determine how to go about the situation. It was stated in the report that the suspect had methamphetamine in his system which probably escalated the officers' reaction to the situation. I'm being serious here, but I think we have the technology in this day and age to create some sort of gun that shoots a net to non-lethally apprehend a suspect.    I just feel like there's a more serious issue of drug addiction that needs to be addressed. You can't change what happened to this man, but I feel like a different approach could've been taken by the police. I probably see meth heads everyday and the police don't intervene until something like this happens. Why does the situation need to escalate before action is taken by the proper authorities? I want to state that I'm not here to take the side of either the police or the suspect, because like I said, it's an unfortunate situation all around. There were comments about how the shooting could have been avoided had the suspect obeyed the officers. This is assuming that the suspect wasn't high on substances, which is untrue according to the report in the link. Regarding the downvotes that was received by the commenter mentioned, I feel that's just part of Redditor psychology, in addition to the words chosen by the commenter."
SanJose,374jvq,OleDeadwoodDick,3,Sun May 24 23:37:34 2015 UTC,"""...but it is to my knowledge that police protocol dictates that you point your firearm at a suspect only if you intend to fire.""   If a person has a knife drawn and is non compliant you don't shoot them right away, but you would have your gun drawn in anticipation of their assaulting you (if a person can cover 20 feet in 3 seconds, you don't want to have to take the time to draw, aim, and fire...  You want to already be aiming.  ""There were comments about how the shooting could have been avoided had the suspect obeyed the officers. This is assuming that the suspect wasn't high on substances, which is untrue according to the report in the link.""  That is not something anyone other than the suspect had control over.  Why the suspect was a threat is irrelevant, that he was a threat is relevant - crazy, high, or simply malicious - the threat is the same, and how you stop that threat is likely going to be the same."
SanJose,374jvq,rdfox,2,Mon May 25 01:35:59 2015 UTC,"Fair statement regarding the first point. I actually forgot to include this in my original post: the fatal event was the result of a complex and intense situation that shouldn't simply be dismissed as a cut and dried case. Some may say that the police acted in a justifiable manner by putting down a safety threat who showed signs of erratic and violent behavior. Others may say that the police used excessive force and escalated too quickly. But things aren't black and white, things aren't as simple as that. It's easy to come to those simple conclusions without considering the circumstantial variables. It just raises so many questions after assessing the information provided.  Regarding the second point, whether or not AGL was a threat doesn't need to be questioned. However, the comment I was referring to was implying that the suspect simply needed to do whatever the cops demanded, assuming this person had a sound mind. I have no idea how someone high on meth would react to these demands, but I imagine it would be difficult for them to coherently comply to law enforcement."
SanJose,374jvq,OleDeadwoodDick,2,Mon May 25 02:51:11 2015 UTC,"A situation like this develops very quickly, and I think people tend to forget that cops are normal people who have adrenaline spikes, fear, etc...  It is very easy to go back in time and figure out how a situation could have been better handled, but the opportunity to take the time and assess a situation often isn't there.  Regarding the second point - That is the unfortunate truth of the matter - some people can't coherently comply, and this will be the result - law enforcement is ever evolving, and people are investigating how the police can disengage while still being able to effectively do their jobs.  However, in a situation like this taking place in a populated public space, those options are very limited."
SanJose,374jvq,OleDeadwoodDick,3,Mon May 25 05:14:08 2015 UTC,"There are problems with all of your points. I'll explain.   The cam began recording initially, but the sound wasn't turned on until later. Maybe someone could explain if this was standard operating procedure, but I find it unusual to have video on but audio off.   Yes, this is standard. That particular camera is always recording video. When the operator activates the camera, it begins recording audio as well. However, after activation, the saved video begins 30 seconds earlier. This is in case the camera is activated after something important happened. Not sure why audio is started 30 seconds earlier too, but that's how it is, and the officer doesn't have independent control over audio and video.   Again, maybe someone could chime in, but it is to my knowledge that police protocol dictates that you point your firearm at a suspect only if you intend to fire.   Yes, it's standard protocol. To the officer's knowledge, the suspect has a deadly weapon. Therefore, he wants to counter the threat with deadly force as well. Drawing and aiming a firearm takes time, so having it out and at a ready position saves critical time, and that time can be the difference between an officer dying or living.   So why didn't VDH also have his firearm drawn instead of his taser?   The first officer on scene will draw his firearm because he is the only one there. If other officers arrive, some will deploy less-lethal options while there is lethal cover. So when VDH arrived on scene, he was able to deploy his taser while the other officer had his firearm drawn for lethal cover. Had the first officer been there alone and attempted to use less-lethal options (such as his taser), if it had failed like it did when the other officer used it, then the officer would have been screwed. However, since VDH had the other officer as lethal cover, when his taser was ineffective, the other officer was able to neutralize the threat using his firearm.  The problem with these situations is that very few people know enough about law enforcement to properly analyze what happened. I'm not trying to fault you for not knowing this stuff. Not many people have a reason to. However, people shouldn't make judgments about things which they do not know."
SanJose,374jvq,349q87ad,2,Mon May 25 06:02:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clearing a lot of that up for me. Sounds like you're very familiar with law enforcement protocol. The rest of us are just civilians trying to make sense of what happened, which is naturally going to result in speculation. In general, doesn't it seem odd to you for the audio portion of an officer's body camera to be separately controlled from the video track? That seems like it could be a point of contention for issues in the future. I'm sure it would make sense from the perspective of LEOs to have separate A/V control. Regarding my second point, I actually addressed that in another comment somewhere below. Despite an attempt to cultivate a discussion objectively, some still choose to silently disagree with downvotes."

The majority of the battle is the key blank and the chance of a general locksmith having a high quality blank for your bike might be slim. With a blank key in hand, almost any true locksmith will be able to get the job done, but I advise you stay away from the setups in the hardware store since they have very limited equipment and employee knowledge.   In the recent years, I've been using these guys in Mountain View to copy automotive factory laser cut keys. I always provide the blank and they are able to copy the laser cut using a router-type setup.

SanJose,373syt,brbposting,4,Sun May 24 16:46:47 2015 UTC,The only actual law in this situation is that you can't delay 5 or more vehicles without pulling over.   This law applies to bicyclists as well as cars.
SanJose,373syt,hacksoncode,5,Mon May 25 06:27:46 2015 UTC,"As a cyclist, I do my best to keep from holding drivers up. I usually stay away from roads without bike lanes and traffic faster than I can ride in, but in the country that's tough - there are people who insist on riding in the center of the lane to discourage unsafe passing, but if you don't want people passing dangerously you gotta make room to pass safely.   More than likely those cyclists have come to expect people gunning past them out there and the best thing to do would be to follow closely but safely and just wait for a straight section and give them as much room as you can while passing."
SanJose,373syt,trickeypat,4,Sun May 24 17:52:09 2015 UTC,"If you are operating in the lane like any other vehicle, you are bound to all the same rules, yes.    Ride on the sidewalk like a pedestrian, you are subject to pedestrian rules.  E.g. you have to wait for pedestrian crossing signs, etc.    It's NOT HARD.  Bicycles do not have special rules or exemptions under the law.  But there are those narcissists who think the rules don't apply to them.  Which on a bike is especially foolish and dangerous."

SanJose,372n5i,Mahtiggah,7,Sun May 24 07:53:59 2015 UTC,"I used to work at the Morgan Autism Center. For a family with a family member that is low functioning I couldn't recommend it more. The people there are lovely, and the management is largely made up of former teachers that have risen the ranks and are absolutely passionate about running a school that supports both students AND families. FYI, the school serves students that are ~5 years old to ~22 years old (I can't remember the exact ages). There is an adult program, but the program is geared more towards mid to high functioning clients. Even if they can't serve your needs they should be able to refer you to another place as they are highly involved with other local disability research/schools. I can't recommend this place enough. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. Best of luck with the move!"
SanJose,372n5i,Udunno13,2,Sun May 24 08:20:43 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your info. That center came up but I'm very careful about where he's placed. You never know what goes on inside these places sometimes.
SanJose,372n5i,Udunno13,3,Sun May 24 08:39:15 2015 UTC,"No problem. To be honest, MAC is not perfect. The employees there get paid a very low wage, turnover is high, and consistency can be a problem. However, please note that what I said generally only applies to the aide's in the class. The teachers are generally highly consistent and stay for many years. The directors have been around for many many years and have risen through the ranks of MAC, so they know what's going on.  The speech therapists, occupational therapists and other non-MAC staff are generally top of the line.  Still, during my time there, MAC's saving grace is its environment. To give you some background, I'm a former high school English teacher (currently working on my bachelor of nursing), and I worked at MAC as an instructional aide (making really really poor money), but what kept me at MAC was the highly supportive and positive environment there. You can see that people there are passionate about what they do AND genuinely love the students that they work with.  During my time at MAC I also saw a number of students' families that were highly involved in the school. The school is highly aware of the immense strain that their students' families face. In general, the families that I had a chance to speak with were very happy with the quality of service/instruction provided by MAC.  Still, take my input with a grain of salt. I only worked at MAC for 8 months three years ago before transitioning to a career-track position as an English teacher at a mainstream high school, but I still currently keep in touch with a number of former-MAC coworkers. The place just seems to attract kind, interesting people."

Point is, a person hired at 20 and retiring at 35 would have to wait 30 years before they could access their pension.  A person retiring at 50 would have to wait 15 years (obviously this depends on when they were hired).+  I can't speak for VTA, but in most jobs your vacation time starts out low and increases based on years of service - you'd start out with 10 days, then 15 days after 5 years, and so on.  I'm surprised only 500 state employees make over 250,000 dollars (naturally that doesn't include county, city, etc employees).  Think about all the doctors, psychiatrists, and so forth who are employed by the government, the department heads managing large workforces, there are judges, lots of highly educated people work for the government.    The county executive of Santa Clara County makes 330,000 dollars a year - he manages a county with over 15,000 employees and a budget of 5,000,000,000.  I think the issue here is not with how much government employees make, it's with the decimation of salaries and benefits currently afflicting the economy over all.  Salaries are down, this economic recovery is creating jobs that pay less than jobs lost during the recession...  I'm not sure that dragging down government employees is going to fix any of those problems."

Quick, tell me which takes more skill, a line cook in a kitchen, or driving a bart train that only has ""Stop, go Reverse"" for controls?  I'd say the kitchen.   Most kitchens have to employ Safeserv certified workers at some point.  You have to know when to flip a steak, or what spices to use.  You have to know when it's time to throw something out.  I think this is the point /u/amacias408 is trying to point out.  It's not like driving a bus or a bart train takes an incredible amount of skill.  For comparison, some of these salaries are more than we pay our SJPD."
SanJose,374fmo,Jeryhn,3,Sun May 24 22:23:29 2015 UTC,"Complexity or skill level of a job is not the only factor in determining pay grades. Responsibility level is another one. Quick, tell me who potentially holds more lives in his hands, the line cook who doesn't order the ingredients and cannot vouch for their safety, or the driver of the BART train who operates the simply-controlled train that a few thousand people ride every hour?  I've worked a job that required a food handlers' card, Safeserv is but one avenue of acquiring this certification in California. It is a 2 hour program with a multiple choice quiz at the end about food safety standards. The suggestion that it is somehow more complicated than driving a BART train is absurd."
SanJose,374fmo,Badmoodsbear,2,Sun May 24 22:41:02 2015 UTC,The article you linked said private sector wages for bus drivers are about $25/hour or $52000 a year. It DID NOT say they are working 60 hours a week for that $52000. Big difference. Someone working 50%+ more hours every week should be paid significantly higher should they not?  I'm guessing those making 100k a year are the most senior employees who are already at the max pay scale and are working a shit ton of hours.

SanJose,36yj0w,Lt_0bvious,-1,Sun May 24 19:44:12 2015 UTC,"The same amount. Guns are for gun fights, cruisers have shot guns in them now, nothing new.  If you can't take a guy down with a tazer, baton, and pepper spray with the help of another guy you aren't protecting any one in a useful manner is all I am saying.  You can still knee cap someone. This go for the kill shot shit should only apply if they are shooting at you. Outside that you need to just disable the guy. It's proper escalation of force, nothing new here."
SanJose,36yj0w,bawwsicle,3,Sun May 24 20:48:06 2015 UTC,You can still knee cap someone.   I don't believe for a second you served in the military. Anyone who knows anything about guns mean you aim for center mass whenever you discharge your firearm at someone.
SanJose,36yj0w,Lt_0bvious,1 point,Sun May 24 21:42:30 2015 UTC,"Can you imagine how difficult it is to aim for the kneecap, shoot it, shoot again if the attacker isn't incapacitated or if the officer misses, run backwards to avoid being stabbed, and shoot for center mass if all of the previously mentioned methods don't work?   Kneecaps aren't something you can really easily aim for. A bit high and you'll knick the femoral artery. A bit to the side and you won't hit anything at all. Add in a methhead running at the officer with a pointed saw, and I can understand why the officer's partner shot the perp center mass when he yelled for help.  You mentioned beforehand that the officers should've tried to de-escalate the situation with non-lethal or less-lethal methods. They first asked him to drop the saw, but he refused to, whether out of malice or the influence of methamphetamine we don't know. They tried a tazer, but it wouldn't penetrate his jacket. Now that the suspect moved towards the officer holding a potential weapon, I don't blame him for skipping the pepper spray, baton, shooting for the knee, etc. Is he supposed to carry a shotgun with beanbag rounds too? Suppose the beanbags don't stop the suspect? Do the officers have to call time out and grab the large inflatable hammer? At what point is the officer allowed to engage the suspect with lethal force? I'd say running at an officer with knife in hand is enough escalation to end the threat to himself with whatever means necessary."
SanJose,36yj0w,username546,2,Mon May 25 06:10:28 2015 UTC,"I get people make mistakes, deadly ones should not be tolerated so lightly.   There was no mistake. The officer definitely meant to shoot this guy in order to save the other police officer's life."

I agree with the warning shot thing though.  The other day I saw a video of a cop shooting (and missing) a dog in a crowd of people.  They were arresting some scumbag with a warrant, and the guy let his pit bull out.   Was thinking just a cap gun would be enough to scare off most dogs."
SanJose,36yj0w,nomilkforsanta,3,Fri May 29 06:40:56 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Dogs don't have the same fear of guns that we have learned, and consequently wouldn't be expected to react the same to a warning shot."

SanJose,36yqpy,ACMTtampa,9,Sat May 23 06:31:54 2015 UTC,"The key thing to understand about San Jose:  fewer than average people actual live in San Jose given it's fiscal and physical size.  That is more people who end up in San Jose by day actually live outside of the city.  A second key fact: there are only two (2) sources of significant revenue available to ANY California city: sales taxes and residential property taxes.  Because of fact one, San Jose is far more dependent on sales taxes than average.    It turns out that commercial property taxes are protected from Prop 13 increased by the use of REITs which are eternal and never transact the properties - the REITs get transacted instead.  This is part of how/why you can drive down ANY industrial park in North San Jose and see ""For Lease"" signs that have been in place for over 15 years now in some places.  The other part is that losses are business deductible.  The third factor is suburban sprawl which can generate both kinds of revenue quickly but also escalate costs of infrastructure far higher but with a time delay.     As result of this, the above problem infrastructure cost deficits were/are hidden over the last 20-30 years because sprawl growth hid the problem - need more revenue, encourage another round of horizontal expansion which generates another pulse of revenue but since everything is ""new"" there are no initial repair/support costs.  But with each expansion comes greater infrastructure costs and greater retirement/labor obligation costs.     And as the excessive sprawled infrastructure ages and begins to inevitably fail, the necessary repairs and preventative maintenance tend to take a back seat to ""human benefits"" like public employee retirements and such, so that when infrastructure finally fails permanently it fails with maximum damage and expense to repair or replace.  This is not ONLY San Jose's story.  MOST of the US has this exact problem and it's not going to end well in general.     What could fix it:  let extreme sprawl go fallow and urbanize vertically in a handful of strategic centers to achieve economies of scale that come with that.  Also get people out of their cars with better mass transit.   Only allow regrowth back to sprawl extremes at urban densities (which generally will never occur in most places).  Of course, people tend not to do the right things if they are inconvenient so I don't have high hopes that something this smart will actually be done.  It will get worse before it gets better.  Combine these and you can start to comprehend by taxes are high yet services and infrastructure are subpar.  The TL;DR:  the money goes to overextended infrastructure that should have never been built and bloated retirements of city employees were needed to support the former."

SanJose,36yqpy,sj_poly,5,Sat May 23 20:59:46 2015 UTC,Here is the proposed budget brief. http://www.sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/43221
SanJose,36yqpy,NotSockPuppet,4,Sat May 23 09:26:52 2015 UTC,"San Jose is about a million people.  Whenever it wants to spend a million dollars, it needs to collect about a dollar from every man, woman, and child in San Jose.   When it spends $100 million dollars, that is $400 for a family of four.  When you hear that they pay $1 person for graffiti removal, you can decide if its worth while.    So, it's about $550 per person for the airport, $450 for waste and waste water $350 for the police,  and so on until it all adds up to about $3,500 per person, or $14,000 for a family of four."
SanJose,36yqpy,DavidMagnum,3,Sat May 23 19:03:36 2015 UTC,"As far painting  graffiti removal, $1 dollar a person seems like a small price to pay but still a bit much IHMO. Assuming graffiti painters are off on weekends, that means the city spends $3,800 on average a day? The city also relies on volunteers and paint donations on top of that.  I don't understand why the city council wouldn't be eager to put contracts, like graffiti removal, up for bid to save money and improve services."
SanJose,36yqpy,DavidMagnum,3,Sat May 23 20:32:37 2015 UTC,What stands out to me is the $1M year contract to GPC to paint over graffiti.. Or $3M a year on our municipal golf courses that lose the city money every year and is still paying the loan on.

Most of these rules are regarding using water outside.  In the middle there is a chart for ""Drought Allocations"". For example, your June allocation is 11 ccf, your July allocation is 13 ccf. So if you get your water bill for June/July and you've used 35 ccf for those two months, you would be paying $3.56 per ccf for the 11 ccf you went over. If you used 40 ccf for those two months, then you'd be paying an additional $7.13 per ccf for those 5 that you went over the 2013 average.  Basically, if your home has 3 people or less, and you've cut back on using outside water, you're probably fine. If you have 4 or more people in your home, you should probably be checking your water usage, and if you've got 6+ you're probably screwed.

I picked up some aquatek marine plywood there for rebuilding a berth bench (the old one was old, moldy, fragile)  and a piece of teak scrap to use on a motor mount.   Man.. Teak is awesome, smells like cinnamon when you cut it."

I've been pestering the county/city to open it to the public for years.  It would be a much safer way for hikers/bikers to get to Grant Ranch.  Mount Hamilton Road is scary if you're in a car, imagine being a bike or hiker getting passed by them."
SanJose,36tach,netllama,7,Thu May 21 23:40:12 2015 UTC,"wait what?  the owners of a private road are dicks for not liking it when people trespass?  You're saying you'd be perfectly happy with having random strangers marching across your property, leaving trash, and generally making a mess?"

I also feel the same way about the service roads at the mouth of Lexington Reservoir patrolled by the SJ Water company.  In the case of Alum Rock falls though... It would be an immense asset to the community to open it up.   Even if they made it a ""Toll trail"" I know a lot of bicyclists and hikers that would pay to use it."

I know someone who signed up to count cars at a freeway on ramp for some state agency a couple years back. Apparently they sit there an tally up the cars that pass by and get a small stipend.
SanJose,36uibc,kittydentures,5,Fri May 22 06:31:39 2015 UTC,They are counting cars.  The data is used for traffic modeling.  I did it   when I was in college.  One of the most boring jobs ever.

I remember as the boom started, I used to see all kinds of U-Haul trucks going south on 101-280-880-680 on jam packed freeways.   I remember meeting people at clubs/bars and they would tell me they were from anywhere but San Jose.    After the bust I saw all those people leave, and the u-hauls travelling in the opposite direction.  Most of the out of state folks I knew moved back to their old states, vowing never to come back.  Edit Should also point out, the freeway city border signs (ones with the population) changed from 1m to 900k around the same time."

SanJose,36r550,yankeefan138,3,Thu May 21 14:47:05 2015 UTC,I feel like the Korean food in the Bay Area is overpriced and decent at best. LA definitely has the best Korean food in the country. But maybe I'll have to try out a few of these places.
SanJose,36r550,NoseDragon,2,Thu May 21 17:48:13 2015 UTC,probably best in the world. I have Korean friends who have spent a lot of time in S. Korea and they all think it's better in LA
SanJose,36r550,efects,2,Fri May 22 01:02:00 2015 UTC,"That's actually a common joke!  But no, it's not true. It can't be, really. For example, I have had amazing Korean bbq in LA, but nothing that compares to the bbq I had out in the country in Korea last month.  There is just a much bigger variety and plenty of things you just can't get outside of Korea.  Despite that, Korean food in the US is almost always authentic, and what you can get in LA is always top notch.  Source: dated a Korean for 7 years and then married her in Korea last month.  Edit: here is some food from my trip a year ago."
SanJose,36r550,NoseDragon,1 point,Fri May 22 01:45:49 2015 UTC,This exactly. The places are all decent at best and way over priced.

He is a community organizer and a race hustler, much like his buddy Al Sharpton. They've both built themselves to where they are now by peddling hate and encouraging people to separate themselves by Race. Instead they should be focusing on our similarities and not our differences. But that doesn't drive votes or dollars, hate and divisiveness does. Race relations certainly weren't perfect before Obama, but they had been improving steadily since the civil rights movement. Now I believe race relations thanks to the people in government is going to be much much worse for a very long time."

The only difference is that I'm not a criminal so I didn't walk away with anything more than a ticket or a warning.  In fact. Cops are more likely to shoot white people because they won't get in trouble for it. If a cop shoots a black man, everyone riots and breaks out their black lives matter signs. If a white man is shot, well his life doesn't matter so nobody will riot. So cops actually receive almost no punishment or harassment from the media for shooting white people.

There was an accident a few minutes earlier on 101N near 87 interchange (which I was caught in the resulting traffic), but I doubt it's related to the sheriff's department and whatever they were doing going 101N."

I got tires that were originally like 570 plus allignment and stuff for like 480, including installation and allignment (which should be more expensive for me, since I drive an awd subaru).  For used tires or patching tires up, I always go to D and J tires on stevens creek near bascom. They patch up holes in tires for like 10 bucks and are done in 15 minutes... and they do a good job. I've been going for years"

Specifically I buy from Tire Rack which warehouses out of Reno, get the tires in a few days and usually go to Calderon Tires on Story Road.   Calderon also has tires you can buy from them.  BTW if you have a leak or nail, go to Calderon on Story to get the tire patched while you wait for $10!  Usually doesn't take more than 10-20 minutes.  Note there are other Calderon Tires - I don't know if they are the same place or not.  I just know the Story Road Calderon and they are great!"

SanJose,36kgfm,DangerInTheMiddle,1 point,Wed May 20 17:37:59 2015 UTC,In the southbay yes. But we are in the suburbs. Try getting a 2 bedroom house in SF with 2 car private garage.
SanJose,36kgfm,atomicllama1,10,Thu May 21 04:01:00 2015 UTC,"Haha- affordable housing, cute."
SanJose,36kgfm,misspeden,7,Tue Jun 2 17:31:35 2015 UTC,"If you look in the Dublin/Pleasanton area, you can ride your bike to Bartn take Bart to milbrae, transfer to caltrain, get off in Palo alto, ride your bike to with.   Other than that, $900 is inexpensive in this area. Maybe look for a multi bedroom house renting out more than just rooms (couch space, garages, etc), or sharing a room."
SanJose,36kgfm,mykol_reddit,2,Wed May 20 05:27:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, I've never really had a professional job before, always been stuck in college bubble. I'll be making around 50k yearly. What is something that i would be able to afford there with that?"
SanJose,36kgfm,cptmonty,13,Wed May 20 01:54:34 2015 UTC,You should really consider finding roommates.
SanJose,36kgfm,darkescaflowne,12,Wed May 20 02:01:44 2015 UTC,"You are not making much for the rents in this area, seriously 50K is not a ton out here."
SanJose,36kgfm,mykol_reddit,10,Wed May 20 04:12:06 2015 UTC,"Unless it's your dream job, I wouldn't move to this area for anything less than 85k/year.   You'll be making 50k, so let's assume 40% to taxes, you're at 30k...$2500/mo. Let's assume $900 for rent, $500 for food, monthly caltrain $200. Your now left with only $900/mo to cover any bills, credit card debt, student loans, entertainment, etc.   Its doable, it's just unpleasant and a shitty way to start your adult life."
SanJose,36kgfm,GailaMonster,1 point,Wed May 20 02:53:48 2015 UTC,"Dont forget that an adult life ideally includes attempting to save for things like    buying a house if you feel like it retiring having children if you feel like it and then taking care of them.   I know someone just starting out might not be thinking of those things, but they should."
SanJose,36kgfm,iKs279,1 point,Wed May 20 13:20:48 2015 UTC,"Just worth noting that the Milbrae transfer sucks, so I'd avoid that if I could. If you're going to live somewhere far-ish from the Bay itself, it's probably better to go closer to Morgan Hill/Gilroy (which have Caltrain stations so it's direct to Stanford). I don't know if the rents are a lot lower though..."
SanJose,36kgfm,Lezb0toe,7,Fri May 22 14:51:30 2015 UTC,Congratulations! Stanford (benefited) employees get a CalTrain and VTA pass for free. There is also the Marguerite shuttle that picks up staff at the Fremont BART station. You could look in south SJ and take the bullet CalTrain to Palo Alto or East Bay is more affordable.

SanJose,36kgfm,NealNotNeil,2,Wed May 20 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"Not anymore... Gilroy's getting overrun and rent isn't that much better than SJ. Anymore you need to hike all the way to at least Hollister, if not Tres Pinos, to find anything reasonable. :-("

There's also a ghetto-y area in Mountain View, northwest of Shoreline, you might find something in there.   Then there's Eastside ..."
SanJose,36kgfm,oldskater,4,Wed May 20 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"You'll either have to live pretty far away or get roommates. Check out PadMapper, to get a sense of where you might be able to afford.  Stanford might pay for your Caltrain pass and a VTA pass, though, so that could make the commute easier."
SanJose,36kgfm,DiDalt,3,Wed May 20 22:07:31 2015 UTC,"$900 a month is a ""good"" price in San Jose for a single room.  I've seen them easily go for $1.2k+.  I highly recommend finding another city.  I know you mentioned a position at Stanford University but you should look into some nearby areas (Morgan Hill, Mountain View, ect..).  Morgan Hill, in my opinion, has the best bang for your buck in this area.  Nice houses for much less than what you'd find in San Jose.  A lot of state jobs (to include working at Universities), include VTA and Caltrain passes.  You should ask about it and see if they give them out."
SanJose,36kgfm,Feral24,2,Wed May 20 03:06:15 2015 UTC,"Anywhere cheap will be pretty far from palo alto, and if you dont have a car, youre pretty screwed."
SanJose,36kgfm,threequincy,2,Wed May 20 18:19:08 2015 UTC,"If he/she's working at Stanford, Caltrain is an excellent way to get to work as the station is right across the street. Well yea the Stanford campus is sprawling but not unmanageable on foot and definitely manageable by bike."
SanJose,36kgfm,SeanBlader,1 point,Wed May 20 02:08:36 2015 UTC,"And if you have a car, you're going to be pretty young, so insurance is going to be expensive, gas here is more expensive than it is in Hawaii, and then traffic isn't quite bad enough that you want to kill yourself, but it will be in another 5 years with all the density increases that are going on all around the bay."
SanJose,36kgfm,c3542,2,Wed May 20 05:10:33 2015 UTC,"http://www.eahhousing.org/pages/apartmentsearch/?county=Santa%20Clara  Here's one particular agency's list of affordable properties in Santa Clara County. You'll need to do further research because some are senior apartments and some have a cap less than what you'll be making, though there are places where the limit is at 60k or so. A lot of them will also have waitlists, so you if you go that route you might need to find something short term in the meantime."
SanJose,36kgfm,Pamzella,1 point,Wed May 20 15:00:59 2015 UTC,"If you are working at Stanford, you really can't afford to park in campus for work, so yes, close to public transportation would be good.   You can take a bike on the train and bike the last bit to your workplace, as it will be more reliable than the Marguerite shuttle.   I don't think you can afford your own place near public transportation, so I would suggest, as others have, a roommate situation.  At the very least, it will buy you 6 months to a year to figure out what you can afford."
SanJose,36kgfm,threequincy,1 point,Wed May 20 20:22:16 2015 UTC,Stanford might offer free caltrain passes. Definitely ask your HR dept bout commuter benefit programs.
SanJose,36kgfm,iKs279,1 point,Wed May 20 04:46:17 2015 UTC,"Caltrain is where you need to start (since Stanford is right by the station). Look for housing ~20 minutes away from a Caltrain station by bike and you're golden (look for bike lanes if possible). Typically if you try to transfer and or rely on VTA/BART/SamTrans you're going to have a bad time, but it can occasionally work. There's also the Dumbarton Bridge Express bus which connects the East Bay with Palo Alto/Stanford, worth looking into."
SanJose,36kgfm,DirtyD27,1 point,Wed May 20 05:04:03 2015 UTC,"My suggestion would be to find a temp lease over summer since there are typically vacancies from places rented by students. That buys you some time so you can search for a good deal but be careful not to wait too long since demand picks up quite a bit at the start of the school year. Also closer to the city will not be necessarily cheaper. If you're trying to stay close the most affordable areas are Sunnyvale, Redwood City and EPA obviously."
SanJose,36kgfm,GailaMonster,1 point,Wed May 20 21:19:46 2015 UTC,"The trick to affordable housing is that there is none anymore, and if you want some the place to look is IN THE PAST or AFTER THE POP.  There is some debate as to whether housing is in a bubble or not. It might be the case that housing is forever going to be too expensive here. I think it is also the case that the current trend is unsustainable in terms of creating a society (we need teachers and secretaries and people making coffee and sandwiches, and it is going to be harder to court those people if home ownership starts at $1m cash, and renting requires a cattle call plus $5K-6k to cover first/last/security.)"

SanJose,36j7ih,hell_on_wheel,4,Wed May 20 04:42:17 2015 UTC,"Money for schools is doled out on the county level to school districts, who have superintendents that dole it out to each individual school. City has nothing to do with it.  The Department is a good idea.  Since shutting down the other clubs, the 25 that are paying their taxes have seen a 3 to 4x increase in business, which translates to a 3 to 4x increase in Tax revenue.  It's too early to say what will be done with the money, but it's piling in.  One of my best friends owns 2 clubs, and I'm privvy to a few things."
SanJose,36j7ih,robert_cortese,3,Wed May 20 05:09:13 2015 UTC,"Well, of course they want to create government jobs for themselves, wherein they can get a piece of all that Measure U tax revenue they have had their eyes on, the last couple of years…these will be a plum city jobs, with health insurance, pension benefits, the works!  And it’s serious business, so we’ll need seasoned administrators and bureaucrats to handle the sticky issues that will inevitably arise, from within the community…people with experience in local law enforcement, or city government and politics.   Maybe a retired judge, or a former City Manager, to head up the department…name-brand local figureheads, who can be trusted to handle the issue, with equanimity, and won’t kow-tow, to the mmj “community”…potheads need not apply. Several great positions, for people like former City Council members...  This mission of this Department will be to ensure that San Jose doesn’t go to pot, while generating as much revenue for the City, as possible."

SanJose,36c7al,Ponyboy1991,11,Mon May 18 05:22:16 2015 UTC,"Welcome to beautiful San Jose! There's so many places to go, I'll list a few.  Food:   Boiling Crab (For a fun seafood experience Henry's Hi Life (Good ribs and steak, was on man vs food) Smoking Pig (Best ribs in the bay)  Brown Chicken Brown Cow, in Cambell, but still fairly close (Best burgers you'll ever have) Ike's Sandwhiches (best subs) San Pedro Square (tiny restuarants, great food, and atmosphere) Smoke Eaters (Best wings IMO, but there's also Wing Stop, and Buffalo Wild Wings)   Drink:   San Pedro square (Lots of small bars, great atmosphere) Yard House (144+ Beers on tap) ISO Beers (beer bar) That's about it for me, Don't really drink out too much, sorry.   Fun:   Malls Downtown events such as   Christmas in the park music in the park  Parks Alum Rock Park (hiking, mountain biking, running) San Pedro Square Sharks games Earthquake games Tech Museum so much more that I can't think off the top of my head."
SanJose,36c7al,AmazeCPK,7,Mon May 18 05:50:30 2015 UTC,"For Food, also throw in Falafel Drive-In on Stevens Creek."
SanJose,36c7al,Black_Astra,4,Mon May 18 07:10:24 2015 UTC,"Yard House has a lot of beers on tap, but it's a chain so nothing super unique. The more popular beer bars in SJ are:   ISO Beers Original Gravity (cocktail bar Paper Plane next door) Good Karma   Los Gatos has some great American (new) restaurants with decent beer choices and interesting cocktails:   Oak and Rye Lexington House Jack Rose Libation House   And in nearby Campbell, Orchard City Kitchen opened recently and has some great food and drink options as well."
SanJose,36c7al,ChillyCheese,1 point,Mon May 18 16:07:26 2015 UTC,"Adding that a lot of cocktail bars have opened downtown lately, and I like every single one.  And a bigger point is that, the surrounding cities are very close by and have their own offerings too."

Keep that in mind and lower your expectations and you'll be fine.  Boiling crab is an hour wait for okay seafood. Hi Life can be alright or filled with degenerates. Smoking pig is okay BBQ, being you are from Texas okay is pushing it, let alone no draft beer and crappy interior. Campbell has good places but you'll pay out the nose.  Ikes is okay San Pedro is fun. Smoke eaters is okay, the SJ location gets degenerates at night."

SanJose,369rba,freezepops,8,Sun May 17 15:51:40 2015 UTC,Go 5 miles past Monterey (on 1 South) and hit up Carmel Beach. Cool downtown area and nice beach side shore. Probably beats things on the way to Monterey.
SanJose,369rba,sjdrama,2,Sun May 17 16:19:16 2015 UTC,"Looks absolutely beautiful, can't wait to check it out. Thank you for the suggestion!"
SanJose,369rba,kerrickter13,6,Sun May 17 18:26:53 2015 UTC,There won't be anything to see if you take the fastest route (101 to 156 to 1) to Monterey.  The scenic route is going over the hill through Santa Cruz (880 to 17 to 1).  You can stop at the Mystery Spot or Beach Boardwalk if you want to do something touristy there.
SanJose,369rba,PThompson509,7,Sun May 17 16:09:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed - beware though - people drive fast on 17 (I think they believe it to be a formula race or something).  If you are going to do the 17 bit, stop at Natural Bridges in Santa Cruz, enjoy the beach there, and then drive along the ocean for a while.  When you get to the lighthouse, stop and admire the world-class surfers there.  From there, you could keep driving along the water and see the Beach Boardwalk, or just head on down to Monterey.    Phil's Fish Market in Moss Landing is pretty good if you get hungry along the way."
SanJose,369rba,drewts86,3,Sun May 17 16:23:40 2015 UTC,I just looked up the menu for Phil's and I'm pretty excited that they have a section just for artichokes. Thanks for the suggestion!
SanJose,369rba,drumrizza,2,Sun May 17 18:35:50 2015 UTC,"Well we do grow a lot of artichokes. If you were to drive north from Santa Cruz on 1, you'd see field after field of artichoke farms. Apparently they thrive in the coastal climate."

SanJose,369rba,fancy_pantser,1 point,Mon May 18 14:32:55 2015 UTC,Hey thanks! Won't be in a rush so I think we'll go with the scenic route. I just looked at it on the map and it looks like it passes pretty close to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. I'd definitely love to see some redwoods on the way.
SanJose,369rba,mixme1,4,Sun May 17 18:31:20 2015 UTC,"An alternative to 101 and 17 is taking 9 through the mountains, and a detour to big basin state park.  There are a variety of hikes available and even just driving through the park ( on 236 or something) is beautiful.  Boulder Creek and Ben Lomond are great little mountain towns.  9 is windy but way more laid back than 17, around 35 average mph as opposed to 55+ on 17.  Less stressful."
SanJose,369rba,hambooty,5,Sun May 17 22:21:34 2015 UTC,9 is closed for a stretch between scotts valley and santa cruz right now fyi.

SanJose,369rba,magelanz,1 point,Tue May 19 00:02:55 2015 UTC,"There is an alternate, Graham Hill Rd, that will take you from Scotts Valley to Santa Cruz.  Equally relaxed pace, if not quite as scenic as the last bit of 9, which runs along the San Lorenzo River in Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park...  That said, you'd still get maybe 95% of the total scenery out of the San Jose - Santa Cruz leg of the trip and it's still worth the detour in lieu of 101 (just another highway) and 17 (a scary highway).  Good for seanhead to look out for ya, I haven't been down to Santa Cruz in a couple months..."
SanJose,369rba,mr_atl,3,Tue May 19 00:43:18 2015 UTC,9 is way better for leisure travel.
SanJose,369rba,hellafun,2,Mon May 18 00:03:18 2015 UTC,Henry Cowell is one of best places to see redwoods on a short visit. Just hike the short loop and if the docents are there ask questions.
SanJose,369rba,FSMCA,3,Sun May 17 20:23:22 2015 UTC,be careful tho because if you take highway 9it might be closed
SanJose,369rba,FSMCA,7,Sun May 17 22:30:54 2015 UTC,"My vote? Just get your ass to Monterey Bay. You will have an amazing time. Santa Cruz is nice, but not worth it for the added time.   From the Airport take 87n to 101s. Stay on 101 until you take 156, then to 1 to Monterey.   We got to Monterey fairly often, and you will have a better time if you just get down there then if you were to take a detour to see Santa Cruz.   But that's just my opinion."
SanJose,369rba,drumrizza,3,Sun May 17 22:02:44 2015 UTC,"I second your opinion. It's Memorial Day weekend coming up, and if OP waits too late on Friday, the highways between San Jose, Santa Cruz, and Monterey will be a nightmare."
SanJose,369rba,FSMCA,3,Mon May 18 01:33:21 2015 UTC,"If you like seafood, I highly recommend Phils fish market"

SanJose,369rba,magelanz,3,Sun May 17 18:36:44 2015 UTC,Make that three votes for Phil's!
SanJose,369rba,zeruch,2,Sun May 17 18:53:23 2015 UTC,"Phil's is very good, what I normally do when I head down there is a have stop at the Whole Enchilada which is at the same turn off as Phil's.  They have great Mexican seafood, unlike any other place I have been, worth trying.  Then I head to Phils to get two dungenous crabs for dinner.  If you are not in a seafood mood, Central Texan BBQ in castorville is a good option.  If you are in Monterey and want to find a good place for dinner that isn't a tourist trap, Sea Harvest on Foam Street is very good."
SanJose,369rba,scooby_didnt,2,Sun May 17 20:06:47 2015 UTC,"La Casa rosa is worth stopping at, if they are open.  If not, Jardines De San Juan, is a very good traditional Mexican restaurant."
SanJose,369rba,sjdrama,3,Sun May 17 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"Jardines is a beautiful restaurant, but the food quality has gone downhill the last 10 years and it is not traditional Mexican food."

SanJose,3638rm,magelanz,5,Fri May 15 19:04:55 2015 UTC,"You can't live there because there are no houses there to live anyway.  But the area surrounding it to the north is pretty nice, to the west not so much (though that area is gentrifying too).  The area directly east is San Pedro Square, and that area is NICE TO LIVE, though expensive due to the high-rises."

You can see in the map that Almaden Valley and Evergreen are already trending Asian.  It's not a hard assumption to make that Willow Glen is next."
SanJose,3638rm,mixme1,1 point,Sat May 16 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"Nah. Almaden shifted for the same reason Cupertino did; good public schools and relatively safe neighborhoods gave a handful of savvy realtors the opportunity to sell a ton of houses to incoming Chinese tech. Evergreen has better real estate pricing, and is the closest decent neighborhood to where southeast Asians had already settled, so as they were able to buy their way out of downtown and some of the rougher parts of ESJ they naturally migrated there.  WG has mediocre public schools and inflated house pricing, and is the closest thing San Jose has to an old family network. Won't happen there soon."
SanJose,3638rm,Suntory_Black,1 point,Sun May 17 23:06:57 2015 UTC,"But not all Asian households have kids.

If you're looking for Italian foodstuffs Paradiso's and Bertucelli's are awesome. Zanotto's is pretty decent too and has a few locations around the south bay.  If you're Italian and you're looking for a ""Little Italy"" what you need to check out is the area along Columbus St. in San Francisco. Granted being in SF it's much more of a tourist-y variety but still fun. Lucca's is an awesome deli on Chestnut; they make awesome sandwiches and I have to recommend the extra-sour sourdough bread."

SanJose,3638rm,puppy_sneeze,4,Fri May 15 19:33:39 2015 UTC,"By the way, it is a really cool place to live because of the proximity to San Pedro Square Market and the rest of downtown. There's a Safeway a few blocks south. Easily walking distance or a really short bike ride. If you want a solid men's barbershop check out talk to Lars at Frank Da Barber on 3rd and Santa Clara.

Since he's moving here and seems to have an interest in Little Italy, one might infer that OP could be Italian. Moving along this logic, trying to let OP know about other Italian things in the area would benefit him/her. While this might be /r/SanJose, I'm here to help OP as much as possible. What are you here for is the question? To limit how much I might be able to help OP? None of your comments here have even addressed the question OP had in the first place.  TL;DR Contribute or GTFO"
SanJose,3638rm,bobby_guz_man,2,Sat May 16 00:06:56 2015 UTC,Your inference is correct. While I am more Italian-American rather than straight up Italian I do appreciate all the info on Italian places in both SF and San Jose.  Thanks!

Our current mayor is part-Italian, as was his challenger.  San Jose's most famous Italian-American son is AP Giannini.  He is the one who built the Bank of Italy building in Downtown San Jose.  He also was the founder of a company called Bank of America, you may have heard of it ;)  He also created a holdings company by the name of Transamerica, who then built that iconic building in SF.

If he/she wanted to know about Italians in SF, I'm sure they would have posted asking about it in the San Francisco Reddit.  I'm sure the San Franciscans in SF Reddit would love to help out OP in that regard, as they should know more about their own city than we do.  But hey, if you want to be extra helpful, go for it.

If you find a place you like, it'd be a very good place for a 20-something to live because it's basically right next door to the San Pedro Square block, and is very close to transit."

And those sliding glass doors are many times flimsily made or designed, my parents had wooden sticks or dowels that were about 1cm shorter than the exposed part of the track and that fell into the track as a precaution, in case the lock didn't catch or the door can be lifted off the tracks.

However, San Jose does have a lot of property crime, that is burglaries, vandalism, and car-related crime.  I guess my point is I wouldn't (and don't) worry about it.  Compared to Chicago where I'm from, SJ's crime is a joke, but the locals would disagree w/ me because apparently crime was a lot lower 5 years ago.  Personally, I live in downtown near SJSU in an old but still pretty nice apartment (it's like just barely up to code, but hey hardwood floors!), and I laugh when I see people post 1br apartments over $2k/mo.  My suggestion is you find a temporary place for the summer (sublease or whatever) and spend that time finding a place you actually want to live in.  When I did this, I checked craigslist twice a day for about a month before I found what I wanted, toured it immediately, signed the next day.  Competition is steep, but you should definitely be able to find a 1br in downtown for under $2k, or split a 2br for less."

SanJose,35ug3e,mjmedstarved,2,Wed May 13 18:55:40 2015 UTC,I haven't tried Waze.  How is it compared to Google Maps traffic?
SanJose,35ug3e,reddRad,4,Wed May 13 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"It's not perfect, but nothing is.  Waze is so far pretty bad at anticipating that a route that is currently 25 minutes will turn into 55 minutes in the next 15 minutes (aka ""Oh yeah you can totally take 87 home right now at 4:55."").  However, I don't know that Google is any better at anticipating that kind of thing either.    One of the reasons I do use Waze every day despite it sometimes losing its mind is I like that it knows where I'm most likely going when I get in the car at certain times of day, plus I like being able to scroll ahead in my route (can't do that on Apple maps), and it's easy to store favorite locations.  It will tell you some weird boneheaded directions from time to time, but I don't know that other apps are immune to that either."
SanJose,35ug3e,withbellson,2,Wed May 13 20:33:23 2015 UTC,"I highly disagree with this.  Sure, it can't predict an accident, but for normal daily traffic it ROCKS.  I use it daily and wouldn't use anything else."
SanJose,35ug3e,mjmedstarved,2,Thu May 14 01:26:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, I use Waze every day too and recommend it to people anyway.  I just know that if I leave around 5, Waze will tell me the best route is 87, but if I do head towards 87 (takes about 10 mins from the office), by the time I get there it will be swamped and at that point Waze won't be able to reroute me effectively.  There was one incident where I got home 27 minutes past the original ETA -- no accidents, just traffic.  It tried to reroute me off 87 at Taylor but by then the damage was done.  (Oh, it also seriously underestimates the time you can spend at the Charcot/87 onramp when the metering lights are on.)    If I leave at around 5:45, though, it's got enough data to know that traffic is shitty and then it usually tells me to take surface streets, and can help me decide whether to take Lafayette up or Alameda over.  The surface street commute is pretty reliably 30-35 minutes."
SanJose,35ug3e,withbellson,3,Thu May 14 04:50:36 2015 UTC,I'll put it this way.. .it's so good Google bought the company. :) It's way better..
SanJose,35ug3e,mjmedstarved,2,Wed May 13 19:49:36 2015 UTC,Google bought Waze and integrated Waze's traffic reporting and data into Google Maps.  Waze is pretty damn good.
SanJose,35ug3e,BlankSmoke,1 point,Wed May 13 19:49:29 2015 UTC,"I'm still quite certain it doesn't re-route on it's own like Waze does.... or, does it now?"
SanJose,35ug3e,mjmedstarved,1 point,Thu May 14 01:28:13 2015 UTC,I'm confused on what you're asking?  I don't personally use Google Maps very often so I'm not sure if Google Maps reroutes due to traffic like Waze does.
SanJose,35ug3e,BlankSmoke,2,Thu May 14 01:50:55 2015 UTC,"I also use Waze sometimes. More often, for my regular commute to work/home, I know basically I'm going to take one of 2 or 3 routes, maybe with a twist here or there. So for that familiar stuff, I will use this other app Sigalert, which just shows a heat map of traffic, but also shows icons where traffic accidents are, and you can often see helpful details about a particular accident, for example ""left 2 lanes blocked"" - great to know, and I see that and take another route..."
SanJose,35ug3e,ZeyaVisuddha,1 point,Wed May 13 21:39:14 2015 UTC,"I find waze hard to use. Too much shit shoved on the screen, and it also uses up data/battery. Google maps does the same thing, but I didn't bother pulling it up today."

The inflation rate from 2013 to 2014 was about 1.6%, and this year it's in the negatives so far.   We need more low-income housing options. Living here just starting out is incredibly difficult even if you're lucky, and we're pricing out a hell of a lot of people including native San Joseans. San Josers. San Joseites. San Jose can't just be a place for middle-aged people who are making six figures and young executives. People need a jumping-off point, a way to get a foot in the door so they can access at least the opportunity for success. As it stands—and this isn't talked about as much as it should be—there are a ton of young San Jose residents still living with their families, unable to leave the nest even though they've got degrees and are working and making a respectable income. Others went and got their degrees, even in the face of skyrocketing tuition costs, and found the job market was still bone-dry.   I know things are still bad right now. We're still coming out of the Great Recession, income inequality coming out of the crash is worse than ever, and the new jobs being created that look shiny and impressive on the news are more often than not low-income at-will jobs. And obviously we're seeing another housing bubble that will eventually burst and will hit us particularly hard because of our inflated prices. San Jose can take steps to insulate ourselves from these national instabilities, though. We may not have the best leaders, but they certainly could be worse, and because there's a wealthy philanthropist crowd here, we actually can get stuff done. Inequality has become a bigger political and social cause recently, and that can be used to talk about creating a better city."

SanJose,35rw17,TeqTime,12,Wed May 13 00:15:40 2015 UTC,"I recommend a pump action shotgun for home defense as they are scary looking and sounding.  If you can make your problem just run away without pulling the trigger, all the better.    There are two gold standards in the world of pump action shotguns, the Mossberg 500 and Remington 870.  The Mossberg is cruder and cheaper, the Remington has better fit and finish but is more expensive.  Think of the Mossberg as an AK-47 and the Remington as an AR-15.  Personally I own two Mossberg 500's.   If you get the Mossberg, wait for them to go on sale at Big 5 and get it there (if they aren't on sale, you can try just walking in and asking for the last sale price.  sometimes they'll give it to you).    As for ammo for home defense, the most common advice you'll see is to get #00 (double aught) buckshot.  Don't get this.  Get #04 as it penetrates sheet rock less but is still plenty lethal.  And absolutely do not get bird or target shot."

I wrote a script that tails the syslog for alarms, and dumps the HD footage (zoneminder only compares on the 480p substreams for CPU reasons).  So after I scripted it up a bit, it works great.  The scripts:  1) Record looping 60 second segments from each camera (remux, no cpu or encoding) to a tmpfs (ramdisk).  2) Watch for alarms in the syslog, and copy the previous 60 seconds (1 segment) and following 120 seconds (2 segments) from tmpfs to the hard drive  3) restart zoneminder's capture daemons if it looses connection to the camera (zoneminder won't do this for remote ip cams... no idea why)  System cost:  Linux Server: already had it (NAS/fileserver/etc.). 1080p chinese IP cam ($45 per off ebay (x2 in my case)) PoE (4 PoE, 4 normal) Switch: $55 PoE power adapters: $15 ea.

SanJose,35pi37,NoseDragon,6,Tue May 12 18:13:13 2015 UTC,"""Mesfin Mekonnen, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, and a Water Footprint associate involved in compiling data, said via email that the 29-gallon figure was based on such factors as rainfall, irrigation and water used in cellars during winemaking.  In California vineyards and cellars, is 29 gallons of water to produce a single glass of wine a realistic estimate?  No, says Larry Williams, a professor in the Department of Viticulture and Enology at UC Davis who long has studied the water needs of vineyards. For one, the Dutch calculations, says Williams, don’t consider the much higher yields of California vines compared with vines of other grape-growing regions. His research indicates that California vineyards produce two to four times as much fruit as vineyards in Europe. ""   So...  Not so much... In fact, not even close:   ""Vines of the dry-farmed portion yielded 4.9 tons per acre, while vines on the irrigated portion produced 6.3 tons per acre. The upshot was that 14.2 gallons of water was needed in the dry-farmed block to produce a typical 4-ounce pour of wine, while 15.3 gallons of water was needed in the irrigated parcel to produce a 4-ounce pour of wine, totals far lower than the figure calculated by the Water Footprint Network.  Furthermore, notes Williams, 'if one considers only the applied water amount for the irrigated treatment (in the above figures), then it took ... 6.5 gallons of irrigation water in the vineyard to produce a 4-ounce pour.'

SanJose,35pi37,brownestrabbit,8,Tue May 12 18:54:25 2015 UTC,"You do understand that we get most of our drinking water from lakes/rivers/mountain runoff (ie. ""surface water""), while farms get most of theirs from ground water, right?  While the two are related, conserving ground water does not put it back into the lakes/rivers that we could use.  Every farm could shut down right now and we'd still be screwed (until we develop new pumping and delivery systems).  That said, I do agree that ground water is extremely important, and farmers are wasting it.  110 gallons of water to make a quarter pound hamburger is insane."
SanJose,35pi37,reddRad,5,Tue May 12 18:29:49 2015 UTC,"I would like to see a source on that.   Groundwater is a critical element of the California water supply. During a normal year, 30% of the state’s water supply comes from groundwater (underground water). In times of intense drought, groundwater consumption can rise to 60% or more.   Yeah. So even right now, at least 20% of agricultural water is from surface water.   Agriculture is the main problem.   Around 75% of California’s water supply comes from north of Sacramento, while 80% of the water demand occurs in the southern two-thirds of the state.[11]   Wikipedia  They come from the same sources. The water is pumped down through pipes or irrigation cannals. Its the same water.  Changing the way we farm is the best way to fix the problem. There is no need to flood fields when you can directly water the individual plants.  The fact is that a majority of farms use outdated methods to water their plants."
SanJose,35pi37,NoseDragon,1 point,Tue May 12 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"I guess the monies are what influence the governments to do what they are doing right now since California's GDP is quite dependent on agriculture/dairy/etc... So if let's say agriculture that requires a lot of water ceases operations or fixes their water wastage, then what? (non-rhetorical, I'm literally asking, then what?). There is no easy solution for fixing the water wastage and maintaining the output of the farms."
SanJose,35pi37,Sprechensiedeustch,2,Tue May 12 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"It's been stated that agriculture only makes up 6-7% of California's GDP and that's including Ag-related businesses like irrigation supply, Ag-specific accountants, etc. while there are a lot of jobs out there, there's not really a lot of money coming back into California for the amount of water-impact that 6-7% brings."

But the attitude of 'I never paid attention to the problem' is a huge issue, people who didn't ever think of the drought problem before are the people who are going to vote for the politicians who set these policies.

SanJose,35pi37,NoseDragon,1 point,Tue May 12 20:27:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, for the most part, I wasn't mocking anyone for not conserving water though.  I was calling out the fact the people who don't think about the drought are the same people who vote for those politicians who are in the pocket of the agri-business that refuse to reduce their water usage.  However, I do think that as a responsible citizen we do have to do what little we can, be it conserve water, vote for better politicians or whatever we can do.  Me using 5 gallons less a day is similar to me voting.  Yes, that one vote and that 5 gallons a day on it's own wont matter, but if we all vote the same way and we all save 5 gallons it helps.  There's no reason to just say eff it, why vote or why save water, both are equally important."

SanJose,35nexf,SniperGX1,1 point,Tue May 12 04:33:19 2015 UTC,Maybe we should have a regularly scheduled practice time at a local range.  I'm sure everyone could benefit from additional practice with their defensive firearm.

Brandish a shotgun, the loading sound is enough to scare a perpetrator away, get a glock.

SanJose,35nexf,Jamaican_In_NY,1 point,Wed May 13 02:27:55 2015 UTC,You might want to do a little more research before selecting a firearm.  See if you can find someone to run you through the safety rules and basics and help you pick an appropriate firearm.

SanJose,35m0kn,typesett,6,Mon May 11 19:07:24 2015 UTC,"I had season tickets for a couple of years but passed on them this year. Last year wasn't that much fun for the games I went to, and I had seatneighbors from hell: talked loudly about everything but the game unless music was on, at which point they figured it was singalong karaoke time. Fun.   Generally, though, it's the best deal in town: full arena runup, lower bowl seats for $25 and club for something like $75 or 80. The season account reps are also awesome about finding primo seats. Our lower bowl season tickets were only around $175 each, and that was mid-field, row 20-something just *above the club entrance.   One Sharks game or ten semipro football games..."
SanJose,35m0kn,geoelectric,5,Mon May 11 18:10:31 2015 UTC,Well San Jose is getting a minor league hockey team as well so you will soon have the choice between 10 semipro football games or 10 minor league hockey games.

SanJose,35m0kn,bourekas,5,Mon May 11 18:46:35 2015 UTC,"Went to my first game this weekend.

I enjoy the hell out of the games, win or lose.  The strategy at time is ""baffling"" to a long time NFL fan, but I'm getting used to it...but absolutely tremendous fun.

SanJose,35m0kn,quadshock,3,Mon May 11 20:14:41 2015 UTC,"If your favorite part of NFL football is the Red Zone, you're pretty much going to love Arena.  50 yard field with more or less constant scoring.  It's not unusual for games to go over 60 points.  YouTube has some videos, Here's last year's playoff quarterfinal highlights against the Spokane Shock."
SanJose,35m0kn,geoelectric,3,Mon May 11 20:32:17 2015 UTC,"If you want a feel for the vibe being at one, this video is from the home opener this year when the team took the field.  It's like this before every game really, just lighter on the pyrotechnics.  Cheerleaders, explosions, fire, dude on a Harley... If you do check one out make sure you put your beer down during The Star Spangled Banner.  Just don't tell whomever you're with to put it down for the LOLs.    Skip the first 60 seconds of the video."
SanJose,35m0kn,mantrap2,2,Tue May 12 04:29:40 2015 UTC,OK that's a pretty good sell
SanJose,35m0kn,InSOmnlaC,3,Tue May 12 05:34:47 2015 UTC,"Arena football feels more or less like watching a Madden video game.

The majority of plays are passing instead of rushing, and interceptions and ""how the hell did they do that"" receptions aren't uncommon. It's super-high-energy."

They fucked it up and didn't warn me in advance that the methods they use cause varying degrees of allergic reaction in 30% of dogs. They used a glue instead of sutures. My dog ended up getting an infection and we took her to our normal vet for damage control. We only went to hssv because I got an employee discount.  Point of the story is don't base significant decisions on what's cheapest. Find someone you trust to do right by you.  That being said, I have trusted adobe with my dog's life several times. My normal vet though is bloom plaza. It's near blossom hill."

On one hand they say that the no fill mandate will hurt businesses that construct pools but on the other hand the fine is $160 per instance.  Thats $160 per new pool filled.

The law adds greatly to the stigma of the activity.  think how much stigma marijuana has even though it's safer and better for you than alcohol.    looking at the some of the data in the article, it does seem pool users are unfairly targeted based on misconception vs data.     Under the same logic of banning pool filling, we should also ban watering your lawn . It will help also help water shortage immediately.    However, will hurt you with large voting base who have green grass vs a tiny minority who have pools.  Problem with a democracy, minorities(not talking race) usually lose.  Hunting is also marred with misconception even though on average, the hunter does way more to promote healthy wild life than your avg citizen.  pump huge amounts of money in to managing ecosystems; and more likely to do volunteer work maintaining healthy ecosystems balance.    But lets hit the real elephant in the room.   Go after the biggest users of water (with powerful lobbies) vs the minority pool users.  INDUSTRIAL farming takes vast majority of the water, with almonds being the biggest offender.  Ban Almonds.    it takes 1 gallon of water to grow 1 almond.  that's just ridiculous."

The problem comes with the 880S onramp accessible when driving southeast (away from the university). The current vegetation and barrier make it difficult to see fast traffic coming up from behind. Drivers are spit out into the aforementioned dedicated lane that was just created a few meters previously, and they only have a couple of carlengths to get up to speed. You can either speed up to 65 on the onramp and hope no convoy of trucks is rolling in your lane at 70, or go slowly enough to be able to see 880S and get honked at from behind as your floor it, trying to go 0 to 65. Going any speed in between could still get you hurt depending on how crazy the worst driver is and what lane s/he's in.  This is nothing compared to 388C. You're spit out into traffic, much of which is trying to turn into you to get to LA. I've been in grave danger here, trying to swap spaces with people going 65mph.  It's not that I can't do it; it's not that I haven't driven all sorts of vehicles all over the country. I'm not a bad driver, nor incapable, nor overly confident or cautious.

You pretty much have to stay on the phone with them and keep saying stuff like, ""That service sounds nice for people who need it, but I don't personally, and it's really important to me to find a way to lower my monthly expenses.""

Even the term ""landline"" is outdated since many physical phones these days go over the internet. Using interception technologies either through data capture or control of a networking point is also allowed, making this a bill that affects consumers much more than businesses, organizations or the government.

In texan, that roughly translates to the bay area sucks for young people unless you have money and/or enjoy the outdoors. That sort of stuff doesn't exist in the same way like it does in Dallas and other large cities in the midwestern areas.  People will disagree, but I've lived in both worlds. Places that have affordable land values have young people, thus restaurants, bars, social scenes that form organically because they are economically viable (young people can afford to work at such places and actually live in the area). Anything resembling that in the south bay is usually engineered (santana row) and hugely expensive (santana row). Campbell may be an exception (it's where I moved to when I was 28), it does alright. I have NO frigging clue how young people working service jobs afford to live here (other than they don't go out and are a paycheck away from financial ruin).

(might be less of commute than driving from San Jose).  for me an most, 1 hr pub transport > 45 min of driving.  to see nightlife, you can loop at yelp reviews of bars.  look for high density of bars/restaurants with many reviews (quanity, not quality).    south bay area has kind of crappy nightlife compared to San Fran and oakland for varius reasons.

SanJose,35budw,cardinal2007,1 point,Sat May 9 02:02:07 2015 UTC,"Fremont unfortunately doesn't have much going on in terms of having restaurants and bars.   For the south bay the biggest concentration of that would be in downtown San Jose, and then probably downtown Palo Alto and then downtown Mountain View. There are some other neighborhoods that have less of that stuff but I still consider walkable, like downtown Los Gatos, Willow Glen, downtown Campbell, Japantown, the Alameda, Santana Row, downtown Sunnyvale, downtown Los Altos.  So it really depends on your budget, looking online it seems like it would be 27 mins or so from SJ, a little more from MV, and a little more than that 32 mins from PA without traffic, the traffic would probably be worst from PA, then from SJ and then from MV, so MV would be the best in terms of driving out.  Downtown SJ would be pricey, 1bds are now around $2100/mo. Downtown MV would be more expensive and be around $2600/mo for a 1bd. Downtown PA is very pricey and probably around $3200/mo for a 1bd, you're almost getting to SF pricing here.   SJ is the least upscale of these and young people tend to be pretty young sometimes since it is adjacent to SJSU. MV is more upscale and it does have it's share of young people go there from Stanford (grad students) or that work and live nearby. PA is probably a little older, except for some Stanford undergrads there, but mostly older clientele with money.  All have a bunch of restaurants and bars that are walkable, with SJ being the biggest of those, if you're looking at clubs SJ is probably the only one that has a substantial number of those, and that is still a lot less than you would see in many cities.   Someone mentioned Oakland, and while driving without traffic from there is probably only a little longer like 35 mins, it is 880 and probably will have traffic backed up for a while. Also from someone coming from Dallas it is probably not what you consider safe, but Jack London Square, Lake Merritt, Downtown Oakland and Adams Point are probably not the worst neighborhoods there by far, but they will be significant less safe than any the places in the South Bay and Peninsula I mentioned.  You didn't mention anything about outdoor activities like jogging, hiking, biking, so I won't go into those, but that is one of the biggest features of living in the valley versus a big city elsewhere. San Jose in particular has some really impressive hiking trails."

Be smart and water at night and use leftover cooking water on your lawn.  That being said, does the law say how long or how hard the rain has to be, before we can not use our sprinklers?"
SanJose,357vsp,nomilkforsanta,5,Fri May 8 10:38:43 2015 UTC,The law just states what days you can water.  It says nothing about rain.  You can find the summary on the last two pages of the resolution.

SanJose,357bx8,Willravel,2,Thu May 7 22:25:09 2015 UTC,This a thousand times.

SanJose,357bx8,jarkatmu,2,Sat May 9 22:18:12 2015 UTC,My feedback on the road diet is that the should remove the closest crosswalks to willow and Minnesota.  It doesn't make much sense having a cross walk a 100 feet from the stop light..

SanJose,357bx8,Photosaurus,8,Thu May 7 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. It's way safer. People on the crosswalk have a good 4-6 feet of bike lane to step out in before they're in the path of a car lane. The turning lane also helps a lot. I say if the traffic patterns aren't changed significantly, then there's no reason to revert the current setup. Seriously, at the least, it definitely felt less safe the old way, if not demonstrably so."

This would have come with more high density housing in the downtown area which would be next to the future Bart station.   The city has said they would have put it before a vote IF MLB approved the move. There was no point in wasting tax payer money on a public vote for a stadium that the MLB is not allowing.

To afford more cops we need more tax revenues.  To get more tax revenues, the ballpark will help.  But definitely I agree with getting more high-paying white collar jobs into the city.  We can achieve this by limiting housing and working harder to cut red tape for businesses.    The ballpark can also help in attracting the businesses down into the Diridon area, becoming a more ""urban"" hub with great public transit access.

This mess really went downhill in the term of Gonzales.  That's what we get for hiring a former Sunnyvale mayor.  I'm glad that with Liccardo we're finally back to having a native San Jose son in the City's highest office."
SanJose,3546yd,bobby_guz_man,10,Sat May 16 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"I'd really rather we not. We've already got the Sharks and the 49ers, our transportation infrastructure is a huge problem particularly with weekday games, and the city is still having significant financial troubles. I'm not against the idea of investing for the sake of economic stimulus, but not all stimulus is created equal. Instead of building a new stadium, maybe we can get more ambitious about fixing roads and highways. Or we can make those investments in city water use reduction that would make us a model for the rest of the state. Infrastructure investments have been studied at length, and on average have a return of some $1.57 on the dollar in economic stimulus.   Nothing against the A's, I'm glad they can play sports and entertain millions. Nothing against people who think having a national baseball team will bring additional prestige to San Jose (though I wonder if perhaps that effect is exaggerated: see the Detroit Tigers). Nothing even against the people who could work at the stadium, dong security or collecting tickets or being a vendor (probably not making all that much). It just seems a bit frivolous. It's a significant financial risk for the city to borrow into the nine digit range for construction on a stadium that may or may not be successful."

SanJose,3546yd,Willravel,3,Thu May 7 03:34:34 2015 UTC,"My personal feelings on this is the economic stimulus isn't worth the headaches created by it.  Look at what's happening in Santa Clara with Levi Stadium.     Voters were promised no out of pocket expenses.  On the hook for a billion now Soccer fields and Ultisac are being targetted for stadium parking lots Nasty thuggish people attending games  (IIRC the city got sued for not providing enough security)   The jobs created are minimum wage at best.  Even the revenue generated from people eating at nearby restaurants, it's minimal at best.  Why do all cities to the north beat us on tax revenue generated per citizen?  They have the jobs, those jobs have lunch and dinner crowds, which generate way more tax revenue than a few events at a stadium would. There's also ancillary retail sales generated from things like needed a charging cable, or getting laundry done at a laundrymat near your work.  You're right about focusing on roads, but our asinine politicians can't see the forest through the trees.  If they focused on job creation (instead of conversion of industrial to residential) then we would have the money for roads and more."
SanJose,3546yd,robert_cortese,3,Thu May 7 04:37:16 2015 UTC,"To be honest Levi's Stadium is a little bit in the middle of nowhere whereas the A's stadium would essentially be downtown and much better connected (Caltrain, BART, VTA light rail and buses, etc.).

This is a completely different scenario than a $1 billion dollar stadium that gets used 10 times a year and put into an area with no auxiliary sales tax intake, and horrible public transit.  By the way, do you ever see any violence/thuggish behaviors at Sharks games Downtown?  Uh huh, that's right, NONE.  SJPD does a pretty good job, these guys are for real.

She said the worst failure of her time as mayor was not getting Apple to locate its headquarters in San Jose, not that she cared for the company’s CEO.  “Steve Jobs came to my office once and put his feet up on my desk,” Hayes said. “He was just awful. He was disrespectful as could be.”   Hamman was a crook.  McEnery was no different than Hamman.  Let's not forget, our spectacular inventory of section 8 housing was created during their terms."

Hamann built our city to what it is today.  Made a bunch of mistakes along the way (airport location, not annexing fast enough, moving City Hall away from Downtown, gutting Downtown) but at least he's an ambitious person who has a bit of further thinking.  McEnery tried his best to rebuid Downtown.  They all had their own faults, but let's give credit where credit is due.  Honestly though, McEnery should not have gotten his name on the Convention Center, I don't think he deserve THAT.

And Jesus Christ, the ballpark is to be PRIVATELY FINANCED.  San Jose is not spending a dime on this, except for possibly infrastructure (which SF had to do for the Giants).    The ballpark will also be NEXT to a Caltrain station, and a light rail station.  It will also be NEXT to entrances to 87 and 280.  It is really one of the best location in terms of access (whether by cars or by public transit).  Once again, San Jose is NOT spending any money on the ballpark.  Wolff and Fisher will be building it with THEIR OWN MONEY, just like they did with the Quakes stadium."
SanJose,3546yd,Willravel,0,Fri May 15 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"I see no reason to conclude that moving the A's here will have a significant impact on business. That certainly hasn't been the case in Oakland, with a giant largely empty stadium and businesses only seeing a slight benefit. Not only that, but we have to take a huge risk in borrowing more than we can afford to pay for a stadium for a team that frankly might not draw crowds.   San Jose has more than enough problems to deal with. Instead of adding a new, expensive problem to the pile, we should address the problems we already have. Then maybe, maybe we can talk about moving a team that has trouble drawing crowds here."

Let me repeat that, FREE.  Oakland's ballpark is a dilapidated dump situated in the middle of nowhere, in poverty-stricken Oakland.  Why do you think the A's, Warriors, and Raiders all want out?    San Jose does have a lot of problems to deal with, with the most important one being tax revenues.  This ballpark will provide just that."
SanJose,3546yd,Willravel,0,Fri May 15 23:35:57 2015 UTC,"Once again, you keep bringing up ""expensive problem to the pile"". How is it expensive when the ballpark is FREE? Let me repeat that, FREE.   I think you mean free to the taxpayer, but even that's a stretch of the truth. Articles about the stadium tend to word it very carefully. Moving a team means more than just construction costs on the stadium. While it's been said (but never officially verified) that the A's would attempt to cover the cost of the new stadium, there's constructing new roads, more police, additional traffic, parking, and a number of other issues that will need to be addressed by the city. And, of course, there's still the possibility that the A's won't be able to cover the costs.    San Jose does have a lot of problems to deal with, with the most important one being tax revenues. This ballpark will provide just that.   As I said above somewhere, stimulus is a great idea but a baseball team is hardly the most effective stimulus. Maybe there will be some increase in tax revenues, but I don't see any reason to think they'd be significant on a city-wide scale. We benefit from more economic activity, more money flowing from consumers to businesses, which in turn mean higher salaries which allow more consuming. That both means economic growth privately and an increase in tax revenue, and it doesn't happen from having a few ballgames a week."
SanJose,3546yd,bobby_guz_man,2,Fri May 15 23:52:50 2015 UTC,"You do understand that infrastructure costs are inherent in all stadium builds, and generally are paid by the municipality.  You do know this right?  The A's will cover the cost, they said so themselves, there's no reason to believe that they won't.  And if they won't, then we tell them to go take a hike, NO big deal.  You think AT&T Park was built for free, including infrastructure?    Look at SAP Center, that place has increased the tax coffers of San Jose, and yet we also had to deal with more police, additional traffic, parking, and all that, yet it was STILL WORTH IT.  And guess what?  The City of San Jose actually built that arena, and it still ended up worthwhile.  Once again, until you can pull businesses into that parcel, the baseball park makes the most sense.  If anything, that baseball park would serve as the attraction for more companies to come into that area, to take advantage of the burgeoning ""urban"" sccene that would surround the ballpark.  And just as a reminder to everybody, the parcels that the ballpark would sit on is pretty small in terms of area, and is but a speck in the grand scheme of the Diridon lands.  Even with that ballpark there, we still have plenty of land left over for office space if so desired.  In fact, the ballpark land comprised maybe about 10% of the full Diridon plan.  Guys, we are from San Jose, the A's ballpark should be supported by EVERYONE here, especially a FREE ballpark on a bunch of small NEGLECTED parcels in a DUMPY neighborhood."

The water budget is a budget like any other, and when you're (honestly) trying to trim a budget, you look for the areas with the greatest return.

We're more than happy to pay a city manager $250k a year to ""Attract top talent"" yet when it comes to the IT side of things, looking at the public employee salary databases our investment in computer science salaries seems minimal at best."
SanJose,34zr2u,robert_cortese,1 point,Wed May 6 16:33:24 2015 UTC,"Probably because there's no well-defined departmental role for people who are exclusively programmers. It also takes some expertise to effectively manage programmers, which most local government staff do not have. Local governments are also not known for their nimble responses to technological change.   Local governments frequently contract out jobs which require highly specialized skills or knowledge. Competitions like this might demonstrate a business case for bringing on programmers or programming outfits as contractors, but I think it's a long way from there to staff positions for programmers."

I understand addiction, and any addict who is actually clean will tell you rehab, therapy, any of that doesn't work. The only thing that works is quitting cold turkey and willpower. Prison will force them to quit. Yes the withdrawal will be brutal... but so what? It's good for them."
SanJose,34yp9f,YZZERDD_com,0,Thu May 7 19:42:13 2015 UTC,"Do you know how easy it is to get drugs in prison? US prisons contain one of the largest heroin trades in the United States, especially in California. Also, going ""cold turkey"" off a number of drugs can physically kill an addict and so we distribute methodone to a number of drug addicts in prison.  Rehab is not always very effective, but its a hell of a lot more effective than just putting someone in a place where drugs and gangs are rampant.  Finally, if you're worried about taxpayer money, you should look at how much we pay private companies to house prisoners. Hint: its a lot more than we could be spending on rehab. But yeah, you're right, I'm the one whose too emotional, not the guy who would rather get retribution for some ridiculous slight against your moral code than actually fix the problem."
SanJose,34yp9f,cosmograph,1 point,Thu May 7 21:07:22 2015 UTC,"I'm aware they get drugs in prison. It's just much more difficult. Like you said its mostly heroine which has the benefit of often killing the user quickly.  Of course you can't quit cold turkey on every drug, but generally that is more for opiates than for stimulants like meth.  We pay private prisons because we don't build prisons anymore. Gotta put the scum somewhere. I'd rather my tax dollars go to that then the hundreds of other programs they get wasted on."
SanJose,34yp9f,YZZERDD_com,1 point,Thu May 7 21:16:12 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd say more expensive, and more violent, but ultimately most addicts will be able to get the drugs they want in prison.  And yeah that's more of an opioid thing, I'm not 100% on what the withdrawal symptoms for meth are.  But you have to see that putting people in a system that is only more likely to escalate their level of criminality is a self-perpetuating cycle that can never actually solve the problem and will only result in a greater number of drug users and criminals and more taxpayer money as these people return to prison again and again. If you were to leave this moralizing system that you use to prop up your superiority, you'd realize that the factors that lead to drug addiction, and criminality have to be addressed or we'll just keep spending more and more money and having more and more crime. Rates of people who beat addiction in rehab aren't amazing, but they're a hell of a lot better than those for prisons."

SanJose,34yg7j,SoMuchMoreEagle,5,Wed May 6 05:08:42 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, San Mateo isn't a San Jose neighborhood (unless you're talking about something I don't know about). You're probably thinking of a city further North on the Peninsula (closer to SF than SJ).  Essentially all of San Jose and Santa Clara is ≤ 30 minutes from the San Jose airport (SJC). None of it is ≤ 30 minutes from the San Francisco airport (SFO). Only downtown and the Alameda are probably ≤ 30 minutes from the airport taking the bus/lightrail.  Downtown San Jose itself is of course walkable to downtown but there are also other walkable areas: the Alameda area that was mentioned, Japantown, Willow Glen or even other cities such as Campbell or Los Gatos. All but Los Gatos are reasonably well connected to DTSJ (and Diridon station, to take the train to SF if you are so inclined).  All of the areas mentioned have both apartments and townhouses/houses. For downtown you need to go a bit North of DTSJ proper."

There's the Mountain View/Winchester VTA light rail line that goes from Campbell to the airport. You'd never even need a car.  The Avalon apartments are a bit pricey, but there's the Los Gatos Creek Trail right there. Very dog-friendly area.   I don't know much about the punk scene, but there's a very nice skateboard park and I'm sure someone there would be able to help you out."

West of 87 isn't a bad area. Also south of 880. Japanstown's a pretty nice area. Keep in mind that it is a bit of a college town and some of the condos down town reflect it.

I live around the corner from The Alameda which reminds me a small city's downtown area. There's good cafes, wine bar, Whole Foods, used book store, and a vintage clothing store if thats your thing.

It's not all bad but there's a lot more trouble over there.    Region 1 is obviously a longer commute to your workplace, even without traffic, but probably not horribly so.   I guess it boils down to how much money you want to spend and if an extra 20-30 minutes per day of commuting is important to you, versus living in a safer neighborhood. Nothing in the South Bay is the kind of neighborhood where you should leave a bike locked up or valuable shit in the open on a car seat, but there are some places where crime is a constant threat, and some places where it's an occasional annoyance."

SanJose,34vfa6,bakergo,7,Tue May 5 07:06:25 2015 UTC,I just don't understand why the police aren't personally liable in more of these cases. At the very least they should hit the police force in the pocket book instead of the city.
SanJose,34vfa6,seanhead,7,Mon May 4 22:53:01 2015 UTC,"I certainly agree that punishing the city for the action of one or a few police officers doesn't make any sense. Closing a public library or firing a few janitors from city buildings isn't going to prevent police abuse of power. Those found guilty of sufficiently severe abuses of power should be removed from the force, be stripped of pension, and banned from police and military service for life.   I think a big part of the reason this doesn't happen is that police-worship is a big part of American culture, even here in relatively-progressive San Jose. We like the idea of a hero cop, the person in the car with the badge and the gun keeping the streets safe. We feel indebted to them and we look up to them (along with having a healthy amount of fear of them). It makes people uncomfortable to aggressively go after people in a very visceral position of authority. It's almost like having an abusive older brother."
SanJose,34vfa6,Willravel,0,Tue May 5 04:43:56 2015 UTC,"Because police officers don't have lots of money.  They are not granted immunity, it's just the that city has money.  I also wouldn't be surprised to learn most officers have their major assets placed in a trust, therefore if there is a judgement against them they can just declare bankruptcy.  Additionally, these are settlements, so there's an issue to how much merit there was to the cases, or if they were just settled to avoid a more costly drawn out legal fight.  A case the city wins may cost 100,000 to litigate, but the plaintiff is willing to settle for 50,000 - what do you do?"
SanJose,34vfa6,jawawalawala,1 point,Thu May 7 05:01:18 2015 UTC,"You miss my point. If the cop if forced into bankruptcy, that's good. It's a mark on their credit which makes their life harder. That's the whole point. So some of their assets are in a trust, we'll go after those the next time they fuck up. Which lets be honest will be no less than 24 hours after the previous case is closed."
SanJose,34vfa6,seanhead,1 point,Thu May 7 06:06:49 2015 UTC,"Except that if the cop declares bankruptcy and has no assets, that means the plaintiff (or more likely his lawyer) just spent 10's of thousands of dollars for nothing - who is going to take that on?  That is why you sue the employer whenever you can.  If their assets are in a trust, they aren't legally their assets, and therefore aren't touchable by judgement."
SanJose,34vfa6,jawawalawala,2,Thu May 7 14:10:08 2015 UTC,Is it something that can be ballot initiative?  I would love to see these settlements come out of the Officers pension and/or police union instead of from the city budget.
SanJose,34vfa6,captaintrips420,2,Tue May 5 01:10:23 2015 UTC,Totally in agreement with you. I'd be fine with it coming from the officer personally.
SanJose,34vfa6,seanhead,5,Tue May 5 16:05:07 2015 UTC,"Claims of excessive force, and lawsuits regarding excessive force, say nothing about whether the force was excessive or not.  Anyone can make a claim, anyone can file a lawsuit.  Paid claims, and settled lawsuits, also say nothing about the legality or reasonableness of the force used, a cities tend to just settle, regardless if the were right or wrong, because litigating a case (even when you win) turns out to cost more than just giving the claimant some money to walk away.  Your logic is flawed.  If you want to criticize the police, at least have the courtesy to be correct when you do it."
SanJose,34vfa6,Dog_Bugger,2,Tue May 5 01:58:10 2015 UTC,"I acknowledge some flaws in this dynamic, but objective measurements of this phenomenon aren't easily available. What would you propose as a more accurate/reliable standard of measuring levels of police brutality?"
SanJose,34vfa6,GameboyPATH,1 point,Tue May 5 16:22:01 2015 UTC,"First of all the terminology you are using is weird, and I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you use that terminology because you're simply not aware of a better term.  Police officers sometimes use force (it happens often across the country, but only sometimes on the scale of the individual officer).  When force is used, it is determined to either be reasonable, or excessive.  An officers force is determined to be reasonable if other officers or the court, or other ""reasonable people"", like a member of the police commission, or the mayor, or the city attorneys office, determines that the force used was necessary and reasonable to stop or at least overcome the resistance being offered by the subject being arrested or pursued.  An important note here:  A police officer often must use MORE force than a subject is using against the officer.  That's why you'll often see a dog bite someone actively resisting, or someone actively resisting without a weapon is struck with a baton or a taser, someone actively resisting while holding something that could be used as a weapon is shot.  all of that is perfectly reasonable if the officer determines it's necessary.  I've always been supportive of the idea of body cameras.  I've never worn one, but my dash cam and my pocket recorder have saved my bacon several times.  I understand what a pain in the ass it will be for officers to have to deal with body cameras.  It'll be a hassle, a time waster for the officer, and a huge expense for the city/county.  I think it's worth it.  You're right, there are no accurate, objective measurements about police use of force incidents, outside of a few departments operating under consent decrees.  If that's what you want, you have to lobby for laws that require police departments to report use of force incidents to the DOJ.  There have to be clear metrics about what has to be reported, and when.  For instance, if I raise my voice to you, that's a mild use of force.  Do I have to report that?  Does my department have not have to report anything unless I lay hands on you?  That would mean every single arrest.  Ok, so not that, but maybe anytime I use my baton, spray, taser, firearm, anytime I throw a punch or a kick or anything like that.  That's what it would take.  But there is alot more to it than just that.  I think you'd be surpised at the staggering price tag that would require.   It's much more than just creating a standarized reporting format that can be input into a DOJ data base and then rules put out, you'd also need an audit team to ensure the data going into the database is good, and you would need hundreds, maybe thousands of analysts and investigators to identify trends and anomalies, and conduct investigations.  All over something that is being completely blown out of proportion by people who are not reasonable, or rational.  Good luck with that."
SanJose,34vfa6,Dog_Bugger,4,Wed May 6 00:06:04 2015 UTC,"But unless there's a reason people in a given city would make false claims at a higher rate than nationally, the number of claims of excessive force per capita is a useful indicator. The most likely explanation for a higher or lower number is that the underlying number of actual uses of excessive force is higher or lower."

Also consider shared housing, as you're more likely to find the amenities you want.  If you plan on surfing every day, Santa Cruz is a nice little beach town. But the commute on 17 every day will be awful. I would recommend taking the 17 express bus to the airport, and that's not far from his college. I think driving it every day would give me a heart attack.  Generally in this area, the apartments go extremely fast. You probably won't find an apartment on CL today that will still be available in July unless it's really terrible. When you move out here, just set up a bunch of apartment appointments, bring your checkbook, and be prepared to sign the lease and hand over your first rent check on the same day.

SanJose,34vcdm,PC-Driver,8,Mon May 4 21:33:11 2015 UTC,"Go up Hwy 9 to 35, turn right and go north for a bit. You'll eventually come to a parking lot on the right.  Go up the road to Mount Hamilton. There are various pull outs etc with views."
SanJose,34vcdm,seanhead,5,Mon May 4 21:36:53 2015 UTC,"These are good suggestions. I would also suggest Mt. Loma Prieta   37.110721, -121.844533  You go up 17 to Summit Road and keep going uphill until the road turns to gravel. Keep going up and you will come to a fire road with a gate. Park. Walk through the gate ignoring the no trespassing signs and when you get to the top you will see the entire valley and the entire Santa Cruz area as far south as Holister.  Another good spot if you don't want to drive that much is the top of Rainbow drive in Cupertino,"

SanJose,34vcdm,Superic94,3,Tue May 5 21:39:22 2015 UTC,"Somewhat related...  One year ""Church on the Hill"" sponsored a fireworks show.  My brother in law, who's fairly agnostic decided to take his kids to the show.  When they got there, they were having people park at the bottom of the hill, and the church would bus people up to the top.  The top parking lot was filled with chairs.  He sat down with his sons (who were about 4 and 6 at the time) and got ready for the show.  For whatever reason, they started the bussing about an hour before dusk.  Former district 9 candidate Larry Pegram comes out and stands on a stage in front of the folding chairs.  He then starts preaching about the evils of homosexuality for an hour.  TL;DR Brother in law goes for fireworks with his kids, is forced to sit through a gay bashing sermon."

Here you have 3 lanes that turn into 1 lane, then add the fact that you have 3 lanes worth of cars trying to get off 101 and then the cars trying to get on 87 which are all in 1 lane and you pretty much are fucked especially when drivers don't know how to switch lanes."
SanJose,34vz1k,hellabad,7,Tue May 5 02:30:45 2015 UTC,^ this ^ all the traffic from central express way trying to get onto 101/87 + traffic from 101 trying to get onto 87. Its just a mess. Having two lanes that go onto 87 should make it a lot better.

I've made appointments with city representatives and I've gone to a number of meetings. I think people confuse local government with national government, as some unreachable, massive system. It's really not. Frankly, I'd really appreciate it if other folks would contact local government to actually talk about what they want and need, because there aren't a lot of people who do that, and that citizen inaction translates to government inaction.   The city can talk to CalTrans and put pressure on them if they themselves get local pressure."

SanJose,34srlb,ebenworld,3,Mon May 4 07:15:51 2015 UTC,"After having lived here for about 5 years, here's my take:   Beijing Restaurant - This place is new and is the cleanest by far. The noodles (perhaps a bit overcooked) and sauce are definitely decent but the dishes are otherwise mediocre. http://www.yelp.com/biz/beijing-restaurant-santa-clara Tong Soon Garden - This is an older more tired but clean restaurant. Their noodles don't taste like legit JJM or JBb noodles. They taste more like Italian pasta. Otherwise the sauce is good. Their dishes are probably some of the better in the South Bay. http://www.yelp.com/biz/tong-soon-garden-santa-clara China Way Restaurant - Not bad. Not great. http://www.yelp.com/biz/china-way-restaurant-santa-clara-2?osq=ja+jang+myun Zazang - This place is filthy. I once saw the back area where the food is prepared and I've never been back since.

SanJose,34srlb,Jamaican_In_NY,2,Mon May 4 14:12:28 2015 UTC,About 10 years ago I would heartily recommend Tsing Tao (especially their black bean noodles) but the older couple who owned the place sold it off since the kids grew up and had their own families and didn't want to take it over. Whoever is running it now is taking a LOT of shortcuts and it's just a mediocre Americanized Chinese place. I gave them another try recently since it was cleaner and maybe they got their act together. Nope. Didn't even take the leftovers home. Their kimchi is pretty awesome though.   I need to find a new place that's like the old tsing Tao.

So maybe you're on to something, if renting a cheap place saves you enough money to pay for some awesome experiences then maybe it isn't worth it. But really you're asking about something that ends up being more about priorities than anything else.

Wife and I were completely miserable there.  Sure we had washer/dryer/dishwasher in our unit, but being so high density (low density now compared to the places you're looking at)  just raked on our nerves. After about a year, we couldn't stand one another, and being in such a small place gave us no room for retreat.  We wound up finding a 3 bedroom duplex for less money on Harris Av.  Eventually we cashed out some stock options and had enough money for a down payment on a house.  Still miss living at 1984 Harris though.    My advice... You'll be happier with more space, less neighbors.  You can still find some decently priced places in DTSJ.   Look for smallish, 500sqft houses off Washington Av."
SanJose,34okfc,JP_2K,13,Sun May 3 02:14:55 2015 UTC,"I was in Carry Nations and saw the truck speed past the window, followed by the Sheriffs SUV who was code 3.  Just when I got out of the door I heard the crash.  He hit a car that was trying to make a left onto Elm.  When I got to the scene, there was a woman proned out on the street, and a Sheriff Deputy with his gun drawn, aimed at the truck (which was surreal because there were dozens of people at the scene, standing and watching).  It took a LONG time for backup to arrive, it really must have felt like forever for the deputy.  While we were waiting some asshole in the crowd yelled to the officer to shoot the female passenger to save the taxpayers money.  The driver had bailed and ran up Bean, which is where The Cats Hill bike race happened to be taking place.  Witnesses stated the suspect, wearing a white tank top with sleeve tattoos, ran into St Mary's church which LGMSPD and Sherrifs office set up a perimeter and eventually arrested the suspect by sending in a dog.  The truck, a dark grey piece of shit pickup with a toolbox bed, turned out to be stolen.  I think one of the reasons the deputy kept the truck at gunpoint was that there were a bunch of blankets in the bed with something/somebody underneath."

Firstly because it adds nothing to the discussion, and secondly, because I really don't give a fuck what you think about me as a person.  I couldn't possibly care any less about that than I do.  Addressing your point, he was passively resisting.  I'm not aware of the use of force policies of that department with regard to using the dog (or even what department that was), and I do not believe that passive resisting is justification to send the dog. (in the agency I worked for it was not)  There are also some concerns with the dog outing on command.  From this video it does look like the dog and handler do need to work on some issues, but that does not mean the dog is not trained, as you claimed, and does not mean the dog team is not effective.  I would bet the asshole who refused to cooperate got a healthy pay day from the city that employed those officers.  All that being said, regardless of whether the officers were within policy or not, survival should be everyone's first concern.  Legality and policy compliance should come next.  If you want to survive your contact with a police officer, you must cooperate and not resist.  Otherwise, you are risking your life.  That is as it should be."
SanJose,34okfc,Dog_Bugger,3,Mon May 4 16:35:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, a bit of context:   He burned a christmas tree, chopped up, in a barrel, in his backyard. They tried claiming it was arson.  Do you believe that's justification for sending a k9 unit? The man was sitting on his couch literally terrified of what the police might do. (He says this in an interview later)"
SanJose,34okfc,Z0di,0,Mon May 4 16:41:19 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like the only side of the story you're operating on is his.  Is that true?  If so, how objective is that?  I don't expect you to notice particular circumstances, or to understand how a particular circumstance may cause a police officer to react, or why.  All I can do is explain those things to you the best I can from the perspective of a police officer, and you can believe me, or you can think that I'm a liar, or that I simply don't know what I'm talking about.  That choice is yours.  The reason for the police contact (in this case, judging from the limited information you've provided it sounds like a cold call [he was not actively burning the tree, but they were there to investigate it having already happened] arson investigation) is not necessarily the justification for using a dog, it's most often the resistance offered by the subject at the time of the arrest.  There are many other potential factors that likely affected the officers decision on use of force that you and I aren't aware of.  For example, was he on parole/probation, was he known by the officers involved, was he known generally to be someone who assaults police officers, was there somethings said or done off camera, or before the video started that we are not aware of.  Any/all of these factors could play a role in the officers use of force determination.  It's simply not possible for you, or even for me (I'm very well trained in use of force laws and police procedures/tactics) based on that short video alone.  There are more facts involved that you and I are not aware of.  What I can do is talk about what we can clearly see in the video, and about police officers concerns generally.  I'm happy to do so in the interest of creating understanding in the community.  I'm not sure where you got the information he was ""literally terrified of what the police might do.""  My guess is you don't know any more than I do about what that man was thinking about that moment.  From what I can see in the video, the officers enter his home, found him in that chair, told him to show them his hands, which he appeared to do reluctantly (which always raises concerns for the officers), then he began passively resisting when they told him to stand up.  They warned him they weren't going to risk their safety by entering that small room where he could easily be concealing a weapon out of view.  They warned him if he didn't cooperate they would send in the dog.  He decided not to cooperate, so the officer fulfilled his promise.    With the actual bite, while unfortunate, the dog did what he is supposed to.  The dog is trained to bite the best target they can grab first.  That's usually (preferably) a limb, but by the time the dog got there, his hands were up above his head.  A dog handler watching this video can tell you it looks like as the dog approaches him it looks like you can see the dog trying to decide what to bite, and it obviously decides the face was the easiest target.  That's just one of the many things a police officer can't control.  Another example of one of those things would be a police officer getting ready to hit a suspect with a baton.  The police officer aims for a limb and swings, but by the time the blow arrives (this kind of thing is very dynamic and changes happen very quickly) the position of the subjects body changes (like in the struggle he falls, for example, or a subject on the ground moves slightly) and the blow actually lands on the head or the neck.  By the time the officers were able to put hands on this guy, he was actively resisting, and they used the dog to control him so they could get him into handcuffs safely.  One obvious problem with the dog team is they need to do some more work on the ""out"" command, and they probably are working on that.  When you're a dog handler, you're always training; there's always a problem that needs to be fixed, and it seems like when you fix one problem, you create another, it's a never ending process.  Overall, while unfortunate for the mans face, the arrest went pretty well. The officers got him into custody and none of the officers got hurt.  If this gentleman didn't want to get hurt, he should have just cooperated.    Don't misconstrue my comments to mean that police officers should punish people for not cooperating.  That's not what I mean at all.  While I'm sure that happens occasionally, that violates the department rules and the law.  With that in mind, it is also true that when the police contact you, if you fail to cooperate at best, or actively and aggressively resist at worst, you are placing yourself in danger.  The officers may not react in a way that you understand, or agree with, but they are reacting in the way they believe is the best way to prevent injury to themselves, other officers, or innocent bystanders.  That often results in injury to the subject, as it did in this video.   That's just a fact of life.  And in my opinion, it is as it should be.  We do not and should not expect police officers to take unnecessary or unreasonable risks to their safety in order to take assholes like the guy in this video into custody."

SanJose,34mlic,RaccoonDispenser,1 point,Sat May 2 19:04:23 2015 UTC,I've been pretty excited about the development plan in North San Jose but the perspective of this article makes me think it might just turn out to be ocean of meh.
SanJose,34mlic,rdfox,5,Sat May 2 19:40:19 2015 UTC,"This author admittedly is starting to annoy me, because in large part he doesn't really know much about Silicon Valley, except for where it is generally located. But yet wants to talk about the urban design as if he does, seriously there is a branch office of SPUR down here that knows a lot more than this guy, it wouldn't take that much effort for this guy to learn a few things.  It doesn't take much to know a little more about south city or San Bruno, and where their downtowns are. The author rates San Bruno poorly because of the walkability of Tanforan, instead of comparing apples to apples and going to downtown San Bruno on San Mateo Ave.  Similarly South San Francisco, (south city), Grand Ave may not be as upscale as Laurel Ave, but it is still a nice walkable area.   The author also completely dismissed downtown San Jose's walkability in his previous post calling it an office park.  These downtown cores of each city is part of why I really liked the peninsula when I lived there, and part of why I moved downtown here in SJ after a while. There are other places like Foster City or Belmont that have no real downtown (Belmont has a tiny strip on Ralston for a block or 2 by El Camino, then the same up by Alameda de las Pulgas).  Atherton was always a city without a downtown, and Mayfield's downtown was trumped by Palo Alto. Sunnyvale demolished all but one block of it's downtown in the 70s, and now is trying to build it back to mixed results, and Santa Clara demolished theirs.   San Jose is the more interesting case to me, because it was a much larger city than the others before the suburban boom, so in the center I see several walkable neighborhoods, Downtown, Japantown, Willow Glen, the Alameda.  North San Jose is just density without walkability, taken to the extreme you would end up with areas like Irvine's high rise cluster area.   Artificially created walkable neighborhoods will always be mixed bags, one thing to see is how Santana Row tries to go from an outdoor mall to a neighborhood, and how Bay Meadows tries to create a walkable neighborhood by design. I don't think the office parks in Sunnyvale or North San Jose will become walkable as more people move closer or the 1 story buildings are torn down in favor of 4 or 10 story buildings (Samsung?). If Silicon Valley wants to promote walkability it needs to develop in the existing walkable and transit accessible areas, like downtown Palo Alto, downtown San Mateo, downtown San Carlos, downtown Redwood City, downtown Burlingame, downtown Menlo Park, downtown Mountain View, downtown Sunnyvale, downtown San Jose, downtown San Bruno, but really only 2 of those downtown SJ, and downtown RWC promote building there (admittedly downtown Sunnyvale already did), and downtown SJ is not getting any new jobs because companies don't want to locate down here.   So yeah, people can talk about how tech companies want to be in walkable cities, but really they are taking over and building huge suburban office parks all over Sunnyvale, Santa Clara and Cupertino, and avoiding large office buildings in downtown San Jose, so no, I'm not seeing it. (yeah, yeah Apigee, that's ONE company)"

A business is charged the fee for the maximum potential number of people who can see it, not who is actually in the bar/restaurant.

SanJose,346tyf,efects,11,Tue Apr 28 19:35:54 2015 UTC,"Some surprisingly good info at the bottom of the article:   Q But don't farmers use most of the water in California? Why do cities need to save?  A Farmers do use 80 percent of the water that people consume in California. But much of their water cannot be transferred easily to cities, either because they have legal rights to it, or because of infrastructure issues. Water that an almond grower in Modesto doesn't pump from a well on his farm, for example, can't be shipped to the Bay Area or Southern California. Many of the state's farmers already have taken huge water cuts, losing 80 to 100 percent of their supplies from the Delta because of state and federal drought cutbacks. Most important, much of the water that urban areas save is from their own supplies. Groundwater or water in local reservoirs that San Jose residents don't use this year can be saved if the drought drags on into next year or beyond."
SanJose,346tyf,TryUsingScience,9,Tue Apr 28 23:08:29 2015 UTC,"It really irks me when people try to use the argument that ""farmers use 80 percent of water, so I don't have to conserve anything"". It doesn't matter what the overall percent used by farmers if their supply can't connect to yours. As the article said there's not usually the right infrastructure to move water like that. If you waste tons of water and your reservoir dries up, it won't matter if the farmers still have some well water or not.  Having said that, everyone in all sectors need to scale back water usage."
SanJose,346tyf,AHPpilot,6,Tue Apr 28 23:41:26 2015 UTC,"It really irks me that residents in the bay area already conserve more water than the normal american by a lot and yet are still asked to go 30% further.  Do you know how difficult it is to go from a reduced rate of water use to a 30% extra reduction.  This isn't low flow toilets, or shorter showers, this is simply not showering and letting every plant I own die or go on its own.  If the farmers could reduce 10% of their water while I do 30% I might be more inclined but they reduce 0 and I do 30% feels unfair."
SanJose,346tyf,darkescaflowne,3,Wed Apr 29 04:40:48 2015 UTC,"When San Jose Water raised their rates a couple of years ago, before the current drought hit, the justification they gave was that customers had been voluntarily conserving so much water, that they couldn’t earn enough revenue to finance their continued operation."
SanJose,346tyf,littlejohnnyjewel,2,Wed Apr 29 15:00:05 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right that its not fair, and farmers should be conserving more water. But just because they can make a bigger impact, doesn't mean that you don't. And even if agriculture does drastically cut usage, it doesn't matter very much if your own water supply is in its own closed system.  Also, comparing our water usage in the Bay Area to a national average is an irrelevant fact that gets thrown around as an excuse not to conserve water. It's like pointing out that there are less shark attacks on land than the global average. Of course we use less water on average: we don't have as much!  Look, if you really have low-flow toilets and take 60-second showers and never wash your car and replaced your lawn with low/no-water plants fed by a greywater system, then I think you really have a right to be angry. Then we need to take that anger and turn it into real solutions for stopping water waste and increasing conservation and fixing water rights and policy; not blame.  But don't let people feed you their excuses on why they don't have to save water because its someone else's fault so it's their problem, because it's ALL of our problem. And when the reservoirs and the rivers dry up, it won't matter whose fault it was."

It is not based on any actual studies or findings and is 10% higher than the number Jerry Brown pulled out of his ass.  Do I think urban citizens in san jose can reach 30%?  Fuck no, this number isn't based on fucking reality, we almost all already use low flow appliances and follow many water saving techniques.    So now I got to shower in 60 fucking seconds, I'm sorry man but thats a ridiculous thing to ask a person to do.  I already moved to using dry cleaners to wash my car and only flush when I shit not just pee.  My lawn looks like shit because I already don't water it so tell me how I can squeeze 30% more out?  Let me tell you fuck those farms.  For something that only creates 2% of GDP to dictate to all the citizens that I need to be dirtier so they can waste water and not improve one iota is simply not going to fly.  I can buy food from somewhere else, I can refuse to subsidize those assholes and let them go the natural way of things, insolvency and bankruptcy.  We as the majority hold more political power, lets force a new system onto the farmers."

Yes, 30% cuts for everyone is total bullshit. We (and many people) already save a lot of water so why the fuck do we have to save more? Why not just go after the actual fucking water wasters first!?!  And yes 60-second showers are ridiculous, at the moment. We should be closing pools and directly fining people (and fucking corporations!) for watering their lawns, none of this warning and a slap on the wrist bullshit.  But my point remains the same: just because the farmers need to save a lot of water doesn't mean we (the urban population) don't have to save a little."
SanJose,346tyf,AHPpilot,3,Wed Apr 29 07:54:52 2015 UTC,"Anecdote: We bought a house last year and on our second day after getting the keys, the water company brought us a notice that said our usage had drastically increased and we were being warned for not adhering to the mandatory 10% usage cutbacks. WTF!?! Of course the usage went up on the house: NO ONE HAS FUCKING LIVED HERE FOR A YEAR AND A HALF!!!  I was home to receive the notice, and explained quite sternly the situation to the water meter guy. He said that it made sense and I probably wouldn't be fined because of a new account. They would probably start measuring after the first few billing cycles and count 10% from there. The sad part of that is that it actually ENcourages me to waste water up front to avoid fines in the future.  The point being: you can't just say everyone has to save fucking 10% and call it good. You have to find the people who are wasting the fucking water!"

SanJose,346tyf,baked_ham,2,Wed Apr 29 04:43:53 2015 UTC,"My SO is from Oakdale-Modesto area, her parents home is on an orchard plot. Her neighbors, the farmers, 5 families with 8 orchards have reduced their planting and yield the last two years to 2/3, now 1/3 that of 2011 and irrigation has been cut to 1/4 as often. We used to visit every couple weeks to help irrigate now it's much less often."
SanJose,346tyf,gal5tom,2,Wed Apr 29 05:48:53 2015 UTC,"The op you replied to was talking about the agri-business farms, the ones that are growing soy and rice here in California.

SanJose,346tyf,puppy_sneeze,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:43:19 2015 UTC,"I was thinking a lot about the farmers and their cutting of water. Fruit trees need to be established for a number of years usually before they bear fruit. If a farmer stops watering fruit trees, they would die. Thus, when we do finally have water, the trees are dead, or a large number of them are dead. Are they watering just enough to keep them alive, but maybe not bear as much or as profitable fruit  (i.e. smaller or less sweet)? Just curious."
SanJose,346tyf,AHPpilot,2,Wed Apr 29 08:08:29 2015 UTC,"You're right that agriculture is a big source of wealth for our state, and that is important to factor to consider in water conservation. But there is a lot of unfairness involved and a lot of room for improvement.  Is it fair if your neighbor drills increasingly deeper wells into your ground water to flood irrigate his orchards while your well goes dry?  Is it fair to take water from the mountains and send it, at a large loss of evaporation, to the desert to grow crops that get sold overseas? Is it fair to have a few people reap the benefits of that water, while the taxpayers bear the true costs?  I'm not saying that I have any answers, but I do have family with farms and orchards in the valley and I can tell you that nobody, regardless of their affiliation, thinks that the shortage is their problem to solve. It's always the other guy that is wasting our water. But that's the thing: it's OUR water. So we ALL have to make changes if we are going to make it through the drought, because when the water's all gone it won't matter whose fault it was."
SanJose,346tyf,adrianmonk,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:11:00 2015 UTC,"Those aren't the only two choices. Agriculture could reduce water usage by 10% and save more total water than if residential users reduce by 25%. I don't think anyone is asking for the farmers to cut their usage 100% and just give up on farming altogether.  In reality, what we should have is both. Maybe that'll happen but so far I haven't seen anything saying agriculture is going to be required to reduce consumption by even 10%."
SanJose,346tyf,M3g4d37h,6,Wed Apr 29 07:55:46 2015 UTC,"A common theme I see here is ""I am irked"".  Get over it.  I cut my water use in half.  I am an avid gardener, and I switched to timers and drip systems a few years back when I saw the patterns of drought, and over the years I have replaced a reasonable portion of grass to drought resistant plants.  Getting irked does no good, doing your part does.  These old-world attitudes of ""it's everyone's problem but my own"" help nobody.  Edit: ""irked"" count currently at 4."

Agriculture could reduce water usage by 10% and save more total water than if residential users reduce by 25%.   The point of the first post in this thread is that ""total water"" doesn't matter very much, since the water systems aren't well connected. If Ag saves 10% water, that doesn't suddenly become available for the coastal cities to use. They have to manage their own reservoirs.   In reality, what we should have is both. Maybe that'll happen but so far I haven't seen anything saying agriculture is going to be required to reduce consumption by even 10%.   Again, from the first post in the thread:   Many of the state's farmers already have taken huge water cuts, losing 80 to 100 percent of their supplies from the Delta because of state and federal drought cutbacks."

Another Mayor who beat my cousin in the mayors race (That's about the worst I can say about him at the moment)  With 2/3rds of these salesmen already having shady bits about themselves, I have to wonder about them trying to sell us recycled water.

SanJose,345z8s,sj_poly,5,Tue Apr 28 15:55:51 2015 UTC,Seems like they left out San Jose Events from the article. They only mentioned 3 that I could see.  You would of thought they could of done some google searches for San Jose events this summer and included those
SanJose,347cvi,tomhusband,7,Tue Apr 28 21:50:26 2015 UTC,Coinstar is probably your best option. If you need to convert it straight to cash Coinstar charges a fee but it's a free conversion to gift cards. Amazon is essentially the same as cash for our household so I just convert it to that. There are a number of other options too (e.g. starbucks): https://www.coinstar.com/giftcards/
SanJose,347cvi,trial_and_error,2,Tue Apr 28 22:05:03 2015 UTC,Right.  Coinstar charges 10.9% and I thought that was bit steep.  I probably have $500 so that's 50 bucks.  I want the cash so I'll probably have to bite the bullet.
SanJose,347cvi,Concani,2,Tue Apr 28 22:11:49 2015 UTC,It's steep but convenient. You could always go through the hassle of opening a local account with a credit union or something.

SanJose,347cvi,hell_on_wheel,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:04:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed, coinstar is the way to go. 11% of $200.00 is still only $22.00"
SanJose,347cvi,hell_on_wheel,4,Tue Apr 28 22:07:33 2015 UTC,I don't bank locally   There's your problem.  Open an account at a local bank and they'll do this for free.  Shouldn't take more than $50 worth of your time (the amount Coinstar would take)...
SanJose,347cvi,Jamaican_In_NY,0,Tue Apr 28 23:15:02 2015 UTC,Maybe but I called a few local banks and they'll gladly cash in your coins but you have to count and roll them first.  Total time for that would exceed $50.
SanJose,347cvi,nuvistor,4,Wed Apr 29 00:04:22 2015 UTC,Try a local credit union... they're generally more helpful than big corporate banks.
SanJose,347cvi,penguining,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:58:11 2015 UTC,That's a good idea.  I'll call a few.

SanJose,347cvi,sanhozay,3,Wed Apr 29 00:59:31 2015 UTC,"Count it out $5-$10 at a time and use that to pay for groceries or small things. For each bit, put a $5 or $10 bill in a box.

SanJose,347cvi,sanhozay,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:02:54 2015 UTC,Please don't be that person in line paying for a large amount of groceries with coins.   If you're going to do that just use Coinstar and convert the coins to a grocery gift card.
SanJose,347cvi,newbie3hunna,2,Thu Apr 30 16:59:17 2015 UTC,"Well, if you can get a safeway gift card out of coinstar, stop right before you hit $10, get a gift certificate, repeat the process, then go to customer service and ask to cash out all the gift certificates?    http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/legal_guides/s-11.shtml  Of course, I'd probably feel like a twit doing that for around $500 worth.  Edit: Safeway's not an option, but Sears, Starbucks, Staples and Best Buy are..."

""Passes"" should be selected. Click on the BART logo and select 45/48 or the 60/64. Add the ""pass"" to your card. You'll also need a minimum amount of cash ($1.75) in order for your HVD pass to work so add cash separately (""Add Value to Card"" > ""Cash""). Checkout once you're done.  Clipper is such a clustermess but if you can believe it, it is actually an improvement from before.

If your destination is not near either, use a transit planner like Google maps or the 511.org trip planner to figure out whether it makes more sense to take Caltrain or BART before you connect to a Muni bus or Muni rail.  Another option is to ride Caltrain or BART into the city and then use Uber to go the last mile."

You could argue that these are harms caused by those religions,  and I would probably also agree. The reason scientology is different is not because it is somehow worse than those religions or causes more harm. It is different because of the particular way it causes harm to people,  namely by cutting them off completely from their other social supports and trying to control all aspects of their lives. That makes it a cult more than a religion, and implies that it doesn't deserve the same protections under freedom of religion that non-cult religions do. I will grant you that the line can get blurry in many cases,  but I think it's pretty clear that scientology is on one side of the line and most mainstream religions are on the other."

I bid 7 companies against each other and cut the asking rate in half. Pay attention to some of the details : if you are doing the 20yr prepay: brand does not matter. Just make sure to get micro inverters.   Companies like Solar City use a single inverter, which means all your panels are topped out at what the worst panel makes. Micro inverters allow each panel to go individually.   As far as the buy vs lease decision: We thought it was a no brainer to do lease as everything is fully warranted for the full 20yr and the technology will be much different 20yr from now. The odds are that we will be able to get a much better system in 20yr for less then the difference between buying and leasing was,  especially investing the extra cash and assuming a miniscule 5% return. (plus, if you sell, that extra cost is just lost funds)   If you want more details, pm me and I can give you the company we went with, they did a fantastic job, even painted the pipe that goes down the side of the house to match our house for us."

I thought the same thing, but then the Sungevity guy tried to tell me the cost and hassle of replacing all the micro-inverters as they go bad far out-weighs the downside of the single inverter.  I didn't know if he was lying to me, so I bailed on the whole thing.  My electric is only about $60/mo, so most solar companies won't even talk to me.  Payoff time is like 20 years for me."
SanJose,33l8z0,reddRad,2,Thu Apr 23 14:43:18 2015 UTC,my electricity bill is around $40 a month. Does it still makes sense to buy panels and would I get money back for supplying more than I take?
SanJose,33l8z0,Tomji,2,Thu Apr 23 21:36:41 2015 UTC,"The way electricity bills work is the more you use, the higher the rate.  So as your usage increases, the more per kWh you pay.  Buying less power because you have solar panels is most effective if you are already using a lot of power because even a small amount of power will be a big amount of savings because you are avoiding paying the highest rate.  $40/month is well into the ""not worth it"" range."

SanJose,33l8z0,tripsd,6,Thu Apr 23 14:50:24 2015 UTC,"You have a lot of flexibility in terms of when and how to pay. Depending on the sqft coverage I think 10-25k is reasonable to expect. Leasing programs were popular for a long time but you never actually own the asset then. Banks are becoming more open to financing panels and I think it's something I would consider strongly. Obv too much variation to give you any solid number but rates in general are amazing right now. If you have the cash you could also plunk down yourself. I believe there is still a national tax rebate of 30% (think it goes till 2016) and I'm not sure about state incentives at the moment though they are fairly easy to find. Consider that solar is still probably not quite efficient enough that you're clearly going to come out way ahead, but it's getting pretty damn close!  Sorry I know this isn't super specific but I'm on mobile. I have had good experiences with sunpower and I believe they are a local company."
SanJose,33l8z0,tripsd,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"Do you know if panel efficiency is ramping up in the market? I hear about all the amazing advances in the news, but I don't know how much of it trickles down to the end user, and how often that happens."
SanJose,33l8z0,retsotrembla,2,Thu Apr 23 13:27:11 2015 UTC,"I think the very best panels are currently at about 21% when first deployed.  So yes there have been absolutely enormous efficiency gains in the last 20 years!  I mean the fact that solar is coming close to grid parity is pretty astounding, I thought it was not possible even 5 years ago."
SanJose,33l8z0,AHPpilot,2,Thu Apr 23 18:42:28 2015 UTC,"I went with a purchase, Freedom Solar installed SunPower panels and a single inverter. I figured: why let other firms capture the profits, when I can keep them for myself?  I figured: why pay a lease and not own the panels, when I can own the panels and be done with it. I figured: You're supposed to have diversified investments, some stocks, some bonds. But, bonds pay lousy interest these days. Instead, I'll put the money in panels, figure the reduced electric payments are analogous to a bond's interest payments, and I'll get the money out at the other end when I sell the house. (There was a study out of Berkeley that claimed that the increased resale value of a house with panels was roughly the cost of the panels.) A single inverter since it was somewhat cheaper, and I don't have anything that casts a shadow that moves across the panels in the course of the day."
SanJose,33l8z0,nomis_nehc,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:15:36 2015 UTC,"In contrast my father got leased panels and it ended up screwing him over when he sold his house. Nobody wanted to buy with the solar lease in effect, so he had to buy out the lease and didn't end up owning the panels in the end or getting the money back out in the sale price. Not sure how that all happened exactly, but I gathered that the solar company was more interested in the long term financial return and were going to get their profit regardless. All I know is that I'd rather buy the panels outright instead of getting stuck in a leasing situation."

SanJose,33i0uo,hell_on_wheel,2,Wed Apr 22 21:29:24 2015 UTC,"Valuations are largely based upon potential market share.  If a company makes left-handed bluetooth gloves, sure, they'll maybe sell $100 in product.  No valuation would make sense for such a company.  Arista, on the other hand, makes switches for data centers.  There are thousands of data centers across the globe, with an annual run rate in the tens of billions.  And Arista's valuation at IPO is about $3.5 billion.  If you think a valuation is crazy, either the VCs are total fools that have dumped way too much money into left-handed bluetooth gloves (unlikely), or that start-up is tapping into a gigantic market."
SanJose,33i0uo,keylime503,0,Thu Apr 23 04:07:05 2015 UTC,"Arista also had the benefit of being entirely funded by their two co-founders (who made their nut by being Google's first and second investors before the company even had a name). So they don't have any investors to pay back. Also, unlike most tech startups these days, the product they sell actually costs money for the customer."
SanJose,33i0uo,hell_on_wheel,2,Thu Apr 23 16:16:22 2015 UTC,"It's just an example for the purpose of illustration.  The point is the same for many other startups.   unlike most tech startups these days, the product they sell actually costs money for the customer   What are your data points for ""most startups"" and product costs?  Startups won't get funded if they don't produce anything of value, otherwise there's no revenue with which to repay investors.  I just don't see how you can jump to this conclusion..."
SanJose,33i0uo,keylime503,0,Thu Apr 23 16:51:01 2015 UTC,"I'm referring to a product like Instagram or Snapchat, which is free to the end-user and doesn't really have ads (until recently). Their valuation was/is solely based on the size of their userbase, there is no money coming in."
SanJose,33i0uo,hell_on_wheel,2,Thu Apr 23 17:07:04 2015 UTC,"You're assuming the valuation is based solely on the userbase.  Instagram and Snapchat must have had a monetization plan on top of that user base (be it advertising, subscriptions, premium accounts, purchaseables, or otherwise), otherwise they wouldn't have pulled in so many investor dollars.  VCs need to see a plan like this before they open their wallets: they only care about revenue, users don't mean much unless you have a revenue multiplier, or a plan for said multiplier.  Now, whether or not those monetization plans will bear any fruit is an after-the-fact discussion.  The valuation is already on paper at this point..."
SanJose,33i0uo,keylime503,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:12:25 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with everything you said. When I say their valuation, I guess I mean at the time of sale to Facebook for Instagram and at the time when Snapchat turned down the $3b buy-out. Obviously they had to have some kind of monetization strategy going forward in order to please VCs, you're totally right about that. I was just observing that at the time when an acquisition was proposed for both Instagram and Snapchat, the companies were not making any money. Any yet they had extremely high valuations. Which brings me full circle to my initial point, which is that Arista actually sells a product to the customer for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece, so their valuation is easier to quantify than an Instagram or a Snapchat."
SanJose,33i0uo,hell_on_wheel,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:22:46 2015 UTC,"at the time when an acquisition was proposed   One does not snapshot a company's current revenues to produce a valuation.  Said valuation is based upon the market that company can tap, and their plan for extracting revenue from that market.   their valuation is easier to quantify   Easier for you to quantify, I understand, sure.

Also the dynamics of your company changes when you go public. You're all of a sudden held accountable to shareholders. No more porn surfing in the break room!"
SanJose,33i0uo,hell_on_wheel,3,Wed Apr 22 22:53:55 2015 UTC,"If you're a startup you can think whatever you want about the value of your company   A startup doesn't determine its own value, because value is only meaningful to the people that invest in the startup.  Hence, an investor sets the startup's valuation for a given round of financing.  Once the value is set, investors buy fractional amounts of that valuation at a cut rate, to be paid back at the full value (in stock, cash or both).

Those two cities will always be in a class of their own when it comes to the Bay Area.   But downtown SJ is changing for the better. Lots of new restaurants, bars, music venues, and clubs are opening left and right and the area is becoming more active and interesting.   You can still take the train back and forth, except now you're doing it because you want to, not because you have to. You can expect to spend at least 12 hours each week sitting (or standing) on the train if it's part of your daily commute. That's 48 hours a month, or roughly 24 days a year.   Just something to consider. SJ isn't ever going to be as great as SF, but is it worth spending so much of your life on a train?"
SanJose,33ebqn,leaningfizz,23,Tue Apr 21 21:40:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The people who do this commute because they want to live in SF, don't even have time to go out in SF once they get home... It makes no sense."
SanJose,33ebqn,keylime503,2,Wed Apr 22 00:13:25 2015 UTC,"left and right, my ass.  have you noticed how dead downtown sj is more than half the week?  ike's doesn't even stay open past 7!"
SanJose,33ebqn,kmudrick,2,Thu Apr 23 07:11:53 2015 UTC,"Ikes is a bad example because most of their shops, including the ones in San Francisco, close around 7. It's not unique to the SJ location.   And are you trying to say that businesses aren't opening in previous unoccupied spots? Vacancies downtown have dropped a lot these last few years."
SanJose,33ebqn,leaningfizz,18,Thu Apr 23 07:37:47 2015 UTC,I do SJ to SF everyday.  It is doable.   It sucks if you don't catch the bullet train.   It sucks if the train hits a car/person/fallen tree. All of which have happened while I was riding. 2 to 3 hour delay minimum. Uber surge pricing!  It sucks if you don't get on early enough and you have to stand the entire time.   It sucks if you are slightly taller than normal and you have to sit in the seats with no legroom.  It sucks if you want to do work that requires internet and you don't have a mobile hotspot. No Wifi.   It sucks if it is a Giants game day and you are fighting for position against giants fans.
SanJose,33ebqn,tipsymonkey,-1,Tue Apr 21 21:07:02 2015 UTC,OP was asking about SF-to-SJ in the morning.  Do the bullets run the other direction as well?  Caltrain should hire you for advertising!
SanJose,33ebqn,reddRad,3,Wed Apr 22 04:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah the bullets run both ways, just on slightly different schedules.  The awesomeness is the same going both ways!"
SanJose,33ebqn,tipsymonkey,2,Wed Apr 22 04:54:39 2015 UTC,"The other direction gets the Sharks fans.  And Levi's Stadium.  Freaking Oregon fans, my goodness..."
SanJose,33ebqn,Alexplanation,2,Wed Apr 22 16:34:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link.  My reasoning was maybe most people go SJ-to-SF, so they send a couple bullets up that way, and then bring them back in the evening.  Is it just the engines that are different, or do they have different passenger cars from the non-bullets as well?  Anyway, thanks for clearing it up."
SanJose,33ebqn,reddRad,2,Wed Apr 22 04:54:15 2015 UTC,If you look @ the schedule that fancy_panster provided you can see your logic that there wasn't a 1 to 1 mapping was correct as there are 6 bullet trains headed from SJ to SF and only 5 headed from SF to SJ.  In addition there appears to be one more Northbound train overall per day.
SanJose,33ebqn,bitchandcomplain,12,Wed Apr 22 04:59:16 2015 UTC,"Just be aware that rents are crazy expensive out here. If you are working in San Jose, you might be better off trying to find a rental in the South Bay or the Peninsula than living in SF. Rents are terrible all over the Bay though, so just be prepared! It's seriously cutthroat. Hopefully your work will help you relocate."
SanJose,33ebqn,sweatermaster,11,Wed Apr 22 14:10:24 2015 UTC,"I moved from Texas too, work in SJ, and tried to do the SF commute for some time ... and it proved to be impossible for me! My work is near the SJ airport and ""home"" was in the mission. The same rent that got me a pretty good 1 bedroom apt in SJ was just enough for a mater bedroom of a 5 bedroom house in SF. As others said the bullets make it more bearable, but still you lose a lot of your energy for just commuting.   If your job allows you to work on the train (with your own hotspot, no wifi on train), then it helps too. I could not. In my case, by the time I got to SF I was so tired that going out was really not an option. I tried, and failed miserably: even once went to an /r/SF meetup and just didn't have the energy to socialize and was that weird dude who  didn't connect.   SJ is boring, yes. But the rents are less crazy. And after work you have time to relax/socialize/work on your projects, etc. So I'd recommend asking these questions first before making a long term commitment:    How much can you spend for rent? Compare what you get in SJ vs. SF.   Can you work on the train? How much is social life important to you? If you could attend social events only in the weekends, would you still want to spend the time/money for SF life? Do you have projects, existing social connections, or need relaxing after work? Most importantly, does your work have a shuttle to the city (or at least to the CalTrain station)? If you can, I'd suggest renting a spot in SF for a while and seeing how it feels to you."
SanJose,33ebqn,where_else,5,Tue Apr 21 21:19:54 2015 UTC,"Believe me, if I thought I could make living in SF and working in Santa Clara work, I'd do it. Instead I settled for second best: living in downtown San Jose and spending every weekend with friends in SF. I like this arrangement a lot. Plus, I actually get to enjoy a nice warm summer!"
SanJose,33ebqn,individual61,6,Wed Apr 22 00:48:06 2015 UTC,That's something not enough folks realize: SF weather is horrible when it should be nice. SJ/SC county = 300 days of sun a year.
SanJose,33ebqn,Jamaican_In_NY,3,Wed Apr 22 00:54:04 2015 UTC,"People have done it - and survived!!   Just live in SJ, seriously.   SF == bums shitting on the street, yuppies, and $7 toast.   Oakland == hoods shooting each other, no wait, at each other and hitting you.   SJ == a pretty nice town, lots of neat stuff to do and see, very bike-able, and an even bet your SF friends (if you can make friends with any of those dweebs) coming down to SJ to do things with you."
SanJose,33ebqn,nuvistor,4,Wed Apr 22 05:50:09 2015 UTC,"I also moved here from Texas and strongly recommend, like everyone else in this thread, that you consider living in SJ. There are lots of studies that show commute times directly affect happiness. Caltrain is great, except when it's not, then it's very, very, very bad. Much better to live near your work, where the rents are (more) affordable than SF and just go up to the city when you want to. It's an easy enough trip, but not one that I'd want to do every day, twice a day.  Plus, keep in mind that the train in SF only gets you to one small part of the city. You still have to find a way to the train, which would probably add a lot of time to your commute and require you to use BART, Muni, drive, bike, or some other transportation that just adds on to your commute.  Live as near your work as you can."
SanJose,33ebqn,oldskater,3,Wed Apr 22 08:37:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other responses that you should consider living in San Jose.     Coming from Texas, depending on what you are used to, you may not like San Francisco as much as you think.   It's very busy, crowded, and can be difficult to get around.   It's also very expensive to live there.  If you want to have a car, you have to pay to park it.  If you don't have a car, you will be limited in terms of leaving the city for trips to places like the beach or to Napa.     You also need to consider if your job is near the Cal Train.   If it isn't, you'll either need to take the Light Rail (which would cost extra and it's not very fast) or take a cab ($$).    SJ may not be as exciting, but there are good restaurants and other things to do, especially downtown.   I would recommend renting in SJ and going up to SF on the weekends or evenings when you have free time.  Then if you really fall in love with SF, you can move there."
SanJose,33ebqn,SoMuchMoreEagle,3,Wed Apr 22 05:08:28 2015 UTC,"If you're dead set on being in SF often, you should consider living in the peninsula (Daly City, SSF, San Bruno, Millbrae).  In addition to being cheaper to live than SF, you have some commute advantages.  If you have a car, you avoid SF traffic going to and leaving from work.  I used to drive from SSF to Campbell, and that commute usually took me 30-45 minutes; best part was that it was usually contraflow to traffic.  SSF to SF can add an additional 20-45 minutes on top of that 30-45 commute, and that's probably still sugar-coating it.  If you don't have a car, Millbrae would be a good option, as its station services both Caltrain and BART (and high speed rail, if that ever happens).  The Caltrain ride from Millbrae station to San Jose Diridon station is about 45 minutes (baby bullet) to an hour (local).  BART from Millbrae to Powell Street station is about 30 minutes.  You'd also be 1 or 2 stops (depending on the schedule) from SFO airport."
SanJose,33ebqn,inferno10,2,Wed Apr 22 19:20:00 2015 UTC,"I've done it. It's not bad as long as you live near the train. Taking the bullet trains are about an hour plus time getting to and from the train and work. So it's about a 3 hour a day commute at the best of times. Depending on where you live in the city, you can add more time to getting to and from the train. Driving takes about 60-90 minutes each way, the afternoon is usually longer. I got sick of it and moved to San Jose."
SanJose,33ebqn,splurb,2,Fri Apr 24 17:37:18 2015 UTC,"I took the train fromSJ to Burlingame (just a few stops from SF)...its not cheaper than driving, but takes about the same time to reach the destination as driving in traffic; the upside is that you can get work done on the train..."
SanJose,33ebqn,Chortlier,2,Tue Apr 21 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone's mentioned this yet: the difficult part won't be Caltrain from SF (4th and King) to SJ (Diridon Station). The difficult part would be get to 4th and King from wherever you are in SF (pain in the ass from the Mission, for example, essentially you'd need to live in SoMa) and to get from Diridon station to your work (basically it'd need to be downtown, which is still 10 minutes away).  Taking everything into account I don't see a way your commute would be less than 1h30 each way."
SanJose,33ebqn,iKs279,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:23:44 2015 UTC,"Sure. Lotsa people do it.  It sucks, but it is doable.   Even the express service is 90 min.  Here's the weekday schedule.   Don't forget to add in the time to get to the train station and then time to get from the train station to where you're working."
SanJose,33ebqn,LockNuts,2,Thu Apr 23 17:57:18 2015 UTC,Actually the bullet takes about an hour which is a lot better than driving. Get a wireless hotspot and you can work on the train.
SanJose,33ebqn,CrabbyVanBuren,2,Tue Apr 21 20:56:49 2015 UTC,"Just moved into sj from Minneapolis a few months ago. Sj is pretty cool. Sf was an option, but commute+cost+self respect made sj an easy choice. We head to sf every few weeks, but we've also discovered that sj is close to other great towns and sites.

Not as bad as some US metros, but yeah, lots of mma t-shirts, dc caps, and nostalgic frat boys."

If you want inexpensive but good work, Kuma on Brokaw is a good option, so is T&H on fifth street. I've only been to Bodylines on Winfield once but they seemed reasonably priced as well. Generally you're looking for a smaller shop that's self-owned that doesn't have any insurance/dealership contracts. They don't care as much about the little guy because doing direct repair programs is where they get their big bucks.  Ask for aftermarket/recycled parts to reduce repair cost. Shops love brand new OEM when it isn't needed because it's easier. You may have to source your own parts in that case. Any body shop worth its salt has an account with LKQ out of Stockton, who is one of the biggest suppliers of insurance-quality recycled parts in the area.  You could also ask for a deal on the labor rate which might help.  (Just don't ask me what insurance because none of these shops are in our direct repair network)"

Not 100% where they get their beans, but they're very tasty...  If you're willing to go a bit farther, I'm very fond of Verve Coffee Roasters in Santa Cruz, and they do mail order.

It will be interesting to see how much the next bubble/recession will affect the bay area, and how much will be propped up by speculators and foreign investors.  I think there's a large population which will never leave due to Prop 13, at least until they die.

Tough to find a student with 5+ years of rental and/or credit history.  I put a lot of time into screening and turn away anyone that has even one red flag... at the expense of missing out on rental income in the short term.  The end result is that I have tenants that are in place for years that are incredibly responsible and even take pride of ownership in their rental.

SanJose,336ioy,adrianmonk,6,Mon Apr 20 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"Eh, when the conventional wisdom is ""buy now or be priced out forever"" you know that a crash is coming... Eventually."
SanJose,336ioy,hell_on_wheel,6,Mon Apr 20 14:21:25 2015 UTC,"If I wanted to buy here (and I really don't), my approach would probably be to try to buy something as soon as possible. If you're going to be in the area long-term, and if prices keep rising, the earlier you buy something, the better.  Even if it's only a 1-bedroom condo in a cheap (but safe) part of town, I'd go with that. Though a 2-bedroom condo with a roommate would be much better.  My reasoning is, if you own something, then when housing prices rise, you're not falling behind as much. If prices rise, your equity goes up too. You're partially protected.  Compare to that to renting while you save for a house. You can be putting $1000/month away for a down payment, but when the price of a house jumps from $1 million to $1.1 million in 3 months, the standard 20% down payment jumps from $200K to $220K. But your savings only went up by $3K, so you're actually $17K behind where you were before even though you've been putting money in the bank. Unless you have an amazingly high income, you can't out-save rapid growth in the market.  But if you'd bought a 2-bedroom condo while waiting, its value might jump 10%, too, going from $500K to $550K. You might not really want to live in that condo, but when housing prices soared, it was partially offset by the equity you gained. (Plus your rent doesn't go up, because you have a fixed mortgage payment.)  Of course, there's also the standard argument that by renting you're ""throwing away"" money. That's true too, but it's a separate phenomenon, and this is in addition to that.  If you're definitely going to be in an area for the long term, you want to be locked into the local housing market by owning some of it. If prices drop, it doesn't really matter since you were going to stay anyway. (In fact, it can be a good time to upgrade if you're in a position to.) If prices rise, so does the value of the property you own."
SanJose,336ioy,hell_on_wheel,3,Mon Apr 20 06:41:30 2015 UTC,"Well your post is interesting, but the main point is your last one: How many people do you know in a job with a guaranteed paycheck for 30 years?  I know plenty of people that was getting overpaid for a few months, take out crazy mortgages they can't afford based on that number, then get burned because their startup fails or they get fired from HP."
SanJose,336ioy,mostri_di_gomma,3,Mon Apr 20 14:21:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a valid point. I said ""as soon as possible"", which is probably not the right wording.  I don't mean to go out and buy a place within 6 months of moving here and starting your new job. I'd wait until the job was stable (and you're getting solid performance reviews), the company was stable, and you have enough money in the bank for a down payment plus several months of living expenses in case something happens with your job.  But once you hit that point, and you're sure you want to be here for the long haul, I wouldn't rent for years and years until you're ready to buy the actual, full-size house that you want. Instead, I'd buy a starter home as an intermediate step.  The thing about having a guaranteed paycheck for 30 years is tricky. That problem exists everywhere, but since housing is so much more expensive here, it's worse. In other places, you can put more into savings and have lower payments, so if something like unemployment happens, you can ride it out more easily.  Here, it's always going to be more risky, which is the one of the main reasons I have no intention to buy a place here, which in turn is one the reasons I don't plan to stay here long term."

If they come here for a summer and earn at a rate of $40K/year, and rent a place for a summer at a rate of $2000-2500/month, they'll have very little left over.

SanJose,33540u,inferno10,10,Sun Apr 19 17:34:22 2015 UTC,"I don't live at Crescent Village, but live at the neighboring apartments across the street.  Paxti's Pizza in the retail area makes pretty good deep dish pizza.  There's a Curry Up Now indian restaurant opening there soon.  The Starbucks is nicer than the one in my complex.  The neighbors all seem friendly, and I definitely feel safe walking around.  The complex is definitely newer than mine (I'd guess yours was built in the 2000s).  The gym looks decent from the outside.  There are some nice food places within 10 min driving distance. There's Thanh Huong, which makes great Vietnamese sandwiches, Philly's Cheesesteak and Wings (self-evident what they serve), Wing Box for asian-style wings, Ma's Restaurant for Chinese food.  The Rivermark area has a bunch of eating places as well.  For groceries, your closest options are Safeway on Montague and Agnew, Fresh & Easy on Holger & N 1st, or Target, also on Holger & N 1st. There are a couple asian grocery stores (SF Supermarket, Ranch 99) on Brokaw.  Not really much in terms of entertainment in the immediate area. It's a quiet apartment complex nestled within a bunch of commercial zones. You do have River Oaks park, which is pretty small.  The good thing is that you'll be close to interstate 880, highways 101 and 87, and Montague/San Tomas expressway to drive to somewhere entertaining.  This is good, especially since the public transportation here is terrible.    For commutes, you're good if you have to commute south.  Driving to downtown on the 87 takes about 10-20 minutes.  My commute to Campbell is 20-30 min, though coming home can be a mixed bag at times.  If you commute on 880 north towards Hayward or on 101, expect traffic on your daily commute.  You're also only 10 minutes away from SJC airport if you need to get away from San Jose (flights to Hawaii are pretty cheap)."
SanJose,33540u,TryUsingScience,2,Sun Apr 19 18:59:35 2015 UTC,Crescent Village was built a couple years ago. I lived where you live then and I got to watch it go up.

I'm not entirely too worried about having to drive a bit for some entertainment, both me and my roommate are used to commuting an hour to a larger city for entertainment. I'm glad to hear that there is a Ranch 99 nearby, I like the availability of certain things you can only get at asian markets. Hopefully I can find some Chrysanthemum greens there. Thanh Huong sounds awesome as well. I'll definitely have to see if anyone would be interested in meeting up when I move there. Moving several states away alone without knowing anyone in the area can be quite daunting."
SanJose,33540u,kndp,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:12:02 2015 UTC,What kind of entertainment do you have in mind?
SanJose,33540u,mantrap2,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:18:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not particular to any single type of entertainment, but would like to see what most of San Jose has to offer. I have a couple of friends in the SF area that I might get to show me around North Bay. The sidebar mega list of fun stuff to do is a good start. Also since I'll be pretty close, I definitely intend on visiting Yosemite. Not too into nightlife, but as I understand SJ isn't really good for that anyway."
SanJose,33540u,rdfox,2,Sun Apr 19 20:34:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah the sidebar list is pretty thorough on the more interesting things to do in the south bay. San Jose has its charms and is a good central point to base out of for discovering the bay area.   Since you said you're not really into nightlife there are a ton of activities a little bit outside of San Jose that may interest you. You have the Santa Cruz and Monterey Bay regions about 40 minutes to 1 hour drive south west. The coast has a ton of small ""secluded"" beaches for you to check out. One that I like to frequent is called Panther Beach. If you are into wines, there are a good amount of wineries spread across the bay area with Sonoma and Napa capping it off about 1.5-2 hours north from SJ. During the winter, when we had rain, it was worth it to take day trips to Tahoe for snowboarding and skiing. The buses can pick you up from various points around the bay area in the morning and drop you back there in the evening. There always music concerts, festival, and theatre events going in around the bay area as well (i.e. Outsite Lands and Bottlerock music festivals). If you're willing to go outside SJ, you'll find many activities.  Going back to San Jose, I'll list some the things I do when I want to have fun around San Jose.  Outdoors:  Almadan Quicksilver Park - Hiking  Alum Rock Park - Hiking  Food+Drinks:  San Pedro Market area - A good one-stop shop for decent food, drinks, and atmosphere. There are tons of good food places to try around SJ. I think the sidebar list covers a good amount of them.  Shopping:  Santana Row + Valley Fair (Santana Row is kinda bourgeois though) Great Mall - Good outlet mall really close to where you'll live.  Activities:   Not much here besides your typical golf courses, shooting ranges, billiards, and go-karting. The San Jose Downtown Association use to host a free outdoor movie night but I don't think they are doing it this year. It was something interesting to attend every now and then. SJ also has frequent bike party rides every 3rd friday of the month starting at 8PM. This is more with a younger crowd. Not sure how old you are.   Hope this helped haha"
SanJose,33540u,rdfox,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:01:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This is fantastic. I'm interested in the bike party rides. I'm 23, and my roommate will be 21. We both enjoy biking so that sounds fun."

The lease isn't a full year, so I'm sure it will be easier to find something more interesting while there. We're not physically in California so we're having trouble finding somewhere that will be easily rentable. It seems that open houses are a pretty big deal in the bay area."
SanJose,33540u,rdfox,3,Sun Apr 19 18:18:35 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty close to there. My opinion, commuting will ruin your life. If your job is close then this is where you want to live. Otherwise there's no reason to."

In my experience when ribs are served, they come out with the original dry rub only. Sauce is provided at the table for you to lay down to your own liking.  Before any Smoking Pig diehards jump down my throat, KC style BBQ usually means your ribs have been slathered in a sweet tomato based bbq sauce before they hit the table."

SanJose,3317vr,haiku23,18,Sat Apr 18 15:00:59 2015 UTC,"I've lost count of the people blatantly on their phones during any normal outing. My attention is drawn to them because their driving is exceptionally shitty. Cutting people off, last minute dives for an exit, etc. No sense of self preservation, let alone driving as a group effort.  Yesterday a woman with kids in the car all but ran into me while I was driving a large white truck. I had to swerve to avoid contact. On her phone. She then cuts in front of me with inches to spare, yet a 1/4 mile of empty road behind in my lane. So I just leaned on my horn for about 6 blocks as we came to a halt at a light. It's a very loud horn. She wasn't having a phone conversation after that. I've found myself using my horn much more these days."
SanJose,3317vr,verdegrrl,10,Sat Apr 18 17:16:32 2015 UTC,"I was on 280 headed North just prior to that. There were some odd and fairly sudden slowdowns near Lawrence and Wolf, and the onramp to 85 North was jam-packed as usual. Any of that could have contributed to a crash.   I've also noticed a steady decline in the overall quality of driving on 280 over the last few years. Barely anyone signals, people cut across multiple lanes, people malevolently prevent people from merging, and half the time I look in the rear view mirror, the person behind me is looking down, almost certainly at a cell phone."
SanJose,3317vr,Willravel,3,Sat Apr 18 15:36:58 2015 UTC,It would be nice to have some CHP on the road in decent numbers to start dinging people for infractions that have a negative effect on traffic flow.  Might put a little respect in them.
SanJose,3317vr,Willravel,9,Sat Apr 18 15:43:58 2015 UTC,"I agree. While people getting pulled over and more CHP might cause some minor traffic initially, I think in the long-run it would help things out considerably. My understanding is things like cutting people off, tailgating, preventing people from merging and the like are all major contributing factors to traffic congestion, and certainly they make the odds of an accident greater.   Perhaps it's a budget issue?   A friend of mine broke down on the ramp going from 280N to 85S and I had to use jumper cables. A CHP saw what was going on, pulled up behind us, was really polite and helpful, and actually put his car between us and traffic so we could both merge on again. I know cops get some flack on Reddit, some of which is deserved, but I've never had any trouble with the CHP. I'd be glad to pay a bit more in taxes to put a few more on the road."

As being a young driver, I don't see the need to use my phone while driving. I keep my eyes focused and scanning at all times. Seriously though, I feel like we need more CHP on 280N in the morning because there are rarely any."

I'm not sure if it's still the same way, but when I used to go, you'd call out the name of the jump you we're about to hit so other traffic would know, especially since you can hit a lot of them backwards too.  I'm not sure if that's still how it is, but check out the scene before you start hitting jumps, for safety's sake."

I have to admit a little of the excitement waned since it took very long for artists to be approved (we haven't even paid for our tables yet) and minimal communication from staff.  But once it gets close to the date it's going to pick up again.    I was going to cosplay but I'm not sure if I have time anymore."

Going to panels you wouldn't normally go, meeting up with friends you see a few times a year etc.   Fanime is pretty bad at announcing stuff, usually finishing up their schedule last minute, but even if you dont hear anything You know the con is gonna be packed. Its growing every year."

SanJose,32wa2a,Jarnagua,4,Sun Apr 19 19:55:51 2015 UTC,Every year I used to go and hang out at Grill On The Alley or McCormick's to see the cosplayers walk by. This year I'm at a RPG convention... how sad.

They might allow some special events where people get to camp out in outbuildings, but the odds that people are going to be sleeping in Sarah's bedroom are pretty much nil.  The press has sorta jumped the shark with this one."
SanJose,32ug7t,BaconFlowers,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:36:09 2015 UTC,"Way not happening in one of Sarah's bedrooms or even in the main part of the house. Security sleeps overnight there in one of the offices that were built into the original part of the house. I've heard inside staff rumor that it's going to either be set up that way, or in one of the outbuildings like the foreman's house."
SanJose,32ug7t,LeBatEnRouge,2,Fri Apr 17 15:57:09 2015 UTC,"The foreman's house was brought up when they first broke this article a year ago, and nothing has happened in there since then. It still looks like the lovechild of a supply room and a set from a zombie movie.  I'm thinking garage, since they use that fairly heavily for special events as is.  Maybe just some sort of camp-out in the shadow of the house.    The house itself would be a nightmare, even apart from the historical preservation issues.  No functional bathrooms inside the house, wiring for the lights that is isn't at all what you'd have in a normal house / hotel, and the fact that you could kill yourself getting up to go pee.  It would be a total and complete liability nightmare."
SanJose,32ug7t,BaconFlowers,5,Tue Apr 21 15:20:09 2015 UTC,"Former tour guide (early 2000s) chiming in:   It's a ""ripoff"" to a lot of people because they don't see / understand how incredibly expensive it is to keep that place running.Does that make it right? Of course not. If it were up to me, the home would have an entirely different use a la Hayes Mansion or Filoli. Making it a tourist trap is just sad. I'm all Indiana Jones about this. The 4 private groups who own the house are really just about making a buck, keeping it open and ""famous"" and draining as much money out of it as they possibly can. The place should be a museum. There are a TON of employees there who have worked there a very long time in every department and they care deeply about the house - but when they're told to do things a certain way by their boss, well... you don't get much say.   That place truly is a labor of love. A lot of employees make very low wages. The tour guides all start our on minimum-wage or close to it. Like I said, the family just wants to get as much money as possible while sorta-kinda preserving the house. All of the crappy carpet that is on tour route, the 50 coats of paint on any high traffic area and the ugly brass hooks and bolts screwed in the beautiful walls to hold up the velvet ropes will tell you that. It's a bummer. This next leg of them trying to make money and be cool is just another big bummer.   Whomp whomp."

The trailer park next to the freeway and/or some of those businesses opposite Santana Row would probably be more likely targets for something in the future.  The Mystery House is visible, popular, and makes a lot of money for other people that would fight it.  Weaker members of the herd will be picked off first."

There aren't going to be ""thugs"" traipsing through the house unsupervised and the uppity Santana Row crowd will think it's too hokey and corny for their tastes.  They're looking at attracting a niche group of people who are way into ghost-hunting (spoiler: they've still come to the wrong place) and perhaps a little quirky San Jose history mixed in.   As a former tour-guide, I can 100% guarantee that people aren't going to get free reign in the house like they've rented it out for themselves the entire night and it will be expensive. They currently do not have laundry facilities on site that could handle regular changing linens, cleaning etc like a normal hotel or bed and breakfast could."

But, yeah, when half of Studio Trigger decides to go to a small con in the South instead of one of the bigger and more well-known anime cons, something's fishy. I wonder if it's due to Anime Expo being the much bigger convention in the same state and actually being an industry event instead of just something fanrun, which allows them to throw more money about. (That, and the acrimonious history that lead to Fanime/Anime Expo in the first place...)"

SanJose,32u2ck,nuvistor,4,Thu Apr 16 20:32:40 2015 UTC,"Or instead of trying to sneak in, you could choose to pay the small price for a pass for the event. With WonderCon moving to Anaheim, BigWow is the largest and best-known comic book convention left in Northern CA. If people hadn't been supporting it so strognly in the years when WonderCon was in SF, it wouldn't be around today and there'd be nothing in the Bay Area for us comic book nerds. If you want this show to continue to grow and be successful, you should consider supporting it with your dollars and showing the community of artists and creators that this convention should be a regular stop for them."

SanJose,32tpub,Entreps,-6,Fri Apr 24 02:24:05 2015 UTC,Don't waste your time people! This company will make you go through hoops for a response. They lie regarding your background check and very unprofessional interviews.
SanJose,32tpub,Concani,5,Thu Apr 16 20:08:06 2015 UTC,"It's an employers market out there right now, of course getting work is work itself."

She says you're are either high or stupid.  They treated her amazing and she brought home $120,000 a year at only 20 years old.  Everyone loves working there according to her.  She only left because she moved out of state."
SanJose,32tpub,NikkoTheGreeko,7,Sat Apr 18 03:57:48 2015 UTC,"Sounds you are sour because they wouldn't hire you.  Looking through your post history, I can't say I am surprised.  Your life revolves around getting stoned.  I wouldn't hire you either."
SanJose,32tpub,Entreps,-5,Fri Apr 17 17:44:08 2015 UTC,"Stoner? I use marijuana for medical purposes. You can assume that I am sour about not being hired, finding a job is not an issue when you run your own business. When you own your own business you know what to expect from an individual in an administrator position and the experience I received from the initial interview process at click away was atrocious. I work in the repair field similar to click away so I am more than familiar with what is required. I wouldn't speak negatively about a company if I didn't have anything to back it. It's one thing to tell a possible employee there's something wrong with their background check (I've never done anything illegal) then the next week I get hired immediately by a much better employer with proof of a clean background check. If Click Away lies regarding a BACKGROUND check how can you trust them to repair your electronics. Seriously, think about those things and stop jumping around assuming the worst."
SanJose,32tpub,NikkoTheGreeko,7,Fri Apr 17 18:58:02 2015 UTC,"As a business owner myself, I can tell you this; If they did in fact have to lie to you about your background check, maybe you should do some self reflection and figure out what personality flaws may be giving red flags.  I can't speak for this company personally, but they bought parts from my old employer and the technicians I met were very, very happy with the company and well compensated.  Again, you seem sour from one bad experience that was probably your fault."
SanJose,32tpub,Entreps,-6,Fri Apr 17 20:24:51 2015 UTC,"As someone who graduated at the top of a business academy with a great emphasis on interview etiquette and many mock interviews I can tell you that I was well prepared for an interview. I was even brought aside by the manager who told me he was very impressed. Just the simple fact that they would lie about something as serious as a background check. Even contacting their HQ they would ignore calls. It may be that you had a good experience and I had a bad experience, I still feel that there are inconsistencies within this company that many may feel is not worth their time."
SanJose,32tpub,NikkoTheGreeko,5,Fri Apr 17 20:37:57 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I can't speak directly for the company but I am sure a goofed interview/background check isn't a reason to tell people to stay away."

SanJose,32rma8,Saxington,2,Thu Apr 16 03:45:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know that area well but generally movie theaters seem like a good high school job. They're usually willing to hire high school kids, you get free movies, run into people you know or want to know somewhat often and it doesn't feel degrading like a fast food job."
SanJose,32rma8,DirtyD27,2,Thu Apr 16 05:53:34 2015 UTC,"The best job hunting advice I can give you (based on my own personal success in the sector) is don't go job hunting.  Instead, figure out where you WANT to work and set forth on a mission to get there. An employer would much rather hire someone who is genuinely interested and enthusiastic about getting in to a specific company than just some dude dropping applications all over town. Life is far too short to work someplace you hate. That said, be realistic. You're obviously not getting into Apple right out of high school. Look around for places where the employees have a real vibe of job satisfaction. Avoid mindless jobs like fast food.  Seek something that encourages hard work, because hard work leads to satisfaction and a feeling of accomplishment. Above all else, distance yourself from the entitled spoiled crybabies that have given your generation its bad reputation for wanting something for nothing. Society owes you nothing. The way you will move up is through hard work, intelligence, imagination, and passion. Never forget that because it will make you stand out and shine.   All that said, if I were in your shoes I'd get a job at Trader Joes. They are a solid company that takes good care of their people and they provide a necessary service to the community. Also, I have a buddy that has worked there for years and stays even though he's a trained chef because he truly loves it.   Best of luck to you. Push yourself to great things and great things will come."
SanJose,32rma8,haiku23,2,Sat Apr 18 15:00:38 2015 UTC,Winchester house had a sign they were hiring. The classic car wash on Hamilton/Bascom is hiring I think.

SanJose,32rma8,brokenfury8585,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:21:16 2015 UTC,"Costco pays well and offers good benefits. You will stay busy throughout your shift though, so that's something to think about.   If you want to work in a grocery store, I would suggest Whole Foods, Trader Joe's or Sprouts. Stay away from Safeway or Lucky.   You can always look at all the city and county websites for part time jobs like crossing guard, receptionist, or lifeguard. The pay is not much, but provides you with the opportunity to be considered as an internal candidate for other open positions."

SanJose,32qzxt,leaningfizz,4,Thu Apr 16 00:36:27 2015 UTC,"What's interesting to me is I've found that urban culture tends to start from grittier, more dangerous areas. When an area is very clean and safe it becomes sterile (see Santana Row).   Even in the article this was highlighted:   Hopes of selling new condos to buyers unaccustomed to fights and shootings and sidewalk vomit meant padlocking the clubs that had become increasingly rowdy as rents rose and SoFA became a regional destination. “The city came in and they wanted to do everything,” O’Brien recalls. “They wanted to clean up the street.”   We hear a lot about safety in San Jose on this sub. Do you think being one of the safer large cities in the country has something to do with the struggling local art/music scene?  I can think of just as many counter arguments (e.g. we don't see the club Chris Brown was shot at as ""the place to be either). I'm not aware of any other areas in San Jose stepping up and being the music hub either.?   This is probably just one of many factors."
SanJose,32qzxt,quadshock,4,Thu Apr 16 02:24:39 2015 UTC,"Hopes of selling new condos to buyers unaccustomed to fights and shootings and sidewalk vomit meant padlocking the clubs that had become increasingly rowdy as rents rose and SoFA became a regional destination. “The city came in and they wanted to do everything,” O’Brien recalls. “They wanted to clean up the street.”   I don't know, but I think SJ tried so hard to create a safe environment that it ended up becoming very hostile feeling. I remember how ten years ago, when I first started to really hang out downtown, there used to be dozens and dozens of cops lined up outside the bars downtown. The police presence always made me feel uncomfortable, not because I was up to no good, but because I felt like my every move was being scrutinized. I didn't pay much attention to downtown happenings back then, but apparently a lot of other people felt the same way, according to the article. I used to see people walk out of bars and then almost immediately get herded into the big police wagons, I'm guessing on some drunk in public charge. I'd see things like that and think, ""why the hell would I want to hang out here if I can seemingly get arrested for hanging out here?"""

Also great for hiking, running and dog walking.   Edit: (video of the bowl at arastradero)[ https://youtu.be/aMaQaVh3Vzo]  Also popular are the parks in woodside/portola valley. Not all allow bikes so do your homework on that. El corte de madera trail, I believe , is bike friendly, not to mention gorgeous. Check out the mid peninsula open space website for more details."

I've only been to parks north of Mountain View, so that's the scope of my knowledge. The bowl at Arastradero is the only trail I've come across with specific ""infrastructure"" for mountain biking. However the scenery in Woodside is worth the extra drive in my opinion - lots of redwoods and feels more out in the wilderness than Arastradero. There is more tree cover in those parks as well, if sun exposure is of concern."

According to the menu, they have all the authentic meats (lengua, cabeza, al pastor, etc) and even a full bar. It also mentions vegan/vegetarian and gluten-free options. The burrito I had was really good too, so I'll be back if I'm in the neighborhood."
SanJose,32hsj1,hella_orange_sauce,2,Mon Apr 13 23:37:54 2015 UTC,"10+ years ago, Adelita's was a hole-in-the-wall place with maybe six tiny tables.  They had really good food, even back then, and were able to expand into the adjacent store.  I think it's been owned by the same family the whole time.  It's nice to see them have success based on the quality of their food."

Food is still just as good :)"

For real stuff, you go to Mexican neighborhoods like down at King and Story.   Taco al Carbon is sit-down and the real deal.  You can get cabeza, lengua, and other ""exotic"" meats (not exotic in Mexico however).  The environment is real (so says my Mexican wife).  It helps to speak some Spanish.

EVC is kind of awful and even almost lost their accreditation about 2 years ago. I transferred out to a UC several years ago and was completely unprepared because the work that would get you an A at EVC would barely get you a passing grade the UC level. I joined a group for transfer students and most of the ones that had come from EVC felt the same way, but there was a genera consensus for the kids who transferred from DeAnza that they were much better prepared for it. Maybe it has gotten better in the last few years, but judging based on the loss of accreditation 2 years ago, I strongly doubt it. EVC needs to go away, not expand."
SanJose,32gn34,Broed_Out_Hipster,8,Mon Apr 13 20:43:27 2015 UTC,The problem with the Evergreen area is that is über-sprawl.  You have to drive quite a distance just to get basics.

If the evergreen area really needed this combination of commercial and residential, then why is Evergreen Village Square so empty every time I go?

Simple answer, it's sort of a pain to get to, and to park at.  I agree with you though, EVC should preserve what land they have left, if just for the purpose of keeping Evergreen classy.      They have the land, they should consider offering an Associates in Sustainable Farming. It would be paying homage to the areas history."

After attending SJCC one semester, I am appalled at how degraded and poor EVC is compared to other options. If nothing else, how about some low income housing? Most retail options are covered in the area, I can't think of anything I'd want to add that I go downtown for or across town. Anything else commercial will likely end up being another shopping center that's vacant or another big corporate like Hitachi or Stryker that are already in the area. The Evergreen area needs most what the rest of San Jose needs: better housing options for low income, more jobs that fill the gap between minimum wage and post University, and a reason to come to this side of town if you don't live here.

At time whole towns/cities would come to a stand still due to marches, sit-ins, and protests. And on and on.   Something being inconvenient  (a protest, for example) doesn't make it bad or even ill-planned. Blocking roads and highways is a major inconvenience, but if their protests begins to encourage an improvement in society (still debateable) then it's worth it."
SanJose,32by5s,hell_on_wheel,7,Sun Apr 12 21:34:38 2015 UTC,"still debateable   Yup.  Seems all they did was elicit anger, no encouragment for change.  Are they even targeting the right people?  Most of the folks in SC that aren't going to UCSC (or don't have kids going there) don't give two shits about tuition hikes... and yet those were the folks that were impacted by the protests."
SanJose,32by5s,hell_on_wheel,-4,Sun Apr 12 21:53:36 2015 UTC,I don't really understand how any of that matters. If I wanted to protest human rights abuses I don't need to travel to Guantanamo.

SanJose,32by5s,atomicllama1,5,Sun Apr 12 21:59:24 2015 UTC,"What do you think would happen if I went to east Texas and protested for gay marriage?  Chased out of town!  You can't stage your protest in front of an entirely unsympathetic crowd.  It's a Sisyphean task to try to change the minds of the closed-minded.  And, frankly speaking, Santa Cruz residents aren't very excited about having UCSC in town.  SC is a very NIMBY town, and UCSC is doing a lot to irritate the NIMBYs: grabbing more and more land, doing more development, causing more traffic, using more water and other resources, etc."
SanJose,32by5s,Romiress,-3,Sun Apr 12 22:09:16 2015 UTC,"So people shouldn't try to drive change if they can't immediately get people on their side? If that line of reasoning prevailed segregation would be all the rage, and women likely wouldn't have voting rights. Change happens slowly, and often times has to overcome or convince the ""unsympathetic crowd"""
SanJose,32by5s,atomicllama1,2,Sun Apr 12 23:02:45 2015 UTC,"You're drawing the wrong conclusion from my example.  People can drive change, but only in increments.  Society as a whole isn't going to turn on a dime, ever.  Look at recent movements like the legalization of marijuana or gay marriage... they start in relatively liberal areas, then snowball across the country as more and more folks warm to the idea.  If you haven't paid attention, segregation still exists, as does racism and sexism, it's just a bit more subtle than before.  Despite the fact that there are laws that enforce ""equal rights"" there are still people that refuse to honor those laws.  Granted, there are fewer pockets in the US where this happens than there was decades ago, but the change is yet to be complete."
SanJose,32by5s,Romiress,0,Mon Apr 13 06:00:10 2015 UTC,"Your point is still flawed. Change and protests are not the same thing. Protests don't need to happen to drive change. Much like all change is not driven by protest.   Protests are sometimes necessary when one group does not have a sympathetic ear within a ""community"". The recent protests of police brutality emphasize this point. Even gay marriage and marijuana legalization started as a series of protests against people with an unsympathetic ear. Why would people need to protests within communities that are willing to consider their cause? That the change was eventually driven by more liberal communities is proof of the protests efficacy. Much like the protests of the 20s and 60s. The protests brought light to a dark issue, and people became picking it up. During the 60s the protests started in the south. THE SOUTH.   And, yes, racism and segregation does exist but it is not the result (or lack thereof) of policy. Much like gay marriage or marijuana legalization. That's pure ideology held by an older world view. But society is not condoning it through policy or inaction."

SanJose,32by5s,slugtea,7,Sun Apr 12 23:28:42 2015 UTC,"The difference is how it relates to the school.  If you got drunk at an event where you were representing the school, they would likely punish you.  If you took the schools vehicle and got a DUI, you'd likely be punished as well.  And if you protest UC tuition hikes while loudly declaring you're UCSC students and blocking traffic for four hours, you'll be punished just the same.  The issue isn't if it's on or off campus - it's if you're making the school look bad, which it does. It makes it looks like the students are a bunch of idiots who don't understand how protests are supposed to work.  Hint for any future protestors: If you just piss off and fuck up the days of random people not connected to your cause, they're going to hate you, not sympathize with you."

SanJose,321y5t,mjmedstarved,2,Fri Apr 10 00:43:43 2015 UTC,And now we're back to exactly the situation that we're talking about here.
SanJose,321y5t,hacksoncode,10,Fri Apr 10 01:08:06 2015 UTC,Not exactly the same situation. The max would only come into play if you forget to swipe again. It's a safety net.
SanJose,321y5t,SamPole,7,Fri Apr 10 01:26:50 2015 UTC,"Forgetting to swipe out of a spot would be a mistake on the part of the driver, and solely their fault. The current system is screwing people over because of a flawed design. Far from the same situation."
SanJose,321y5t,DuckyFreeman,-3,Fri Apr 10 01:29:25 2015 UTC,"The flaw in the system is screwing people over, but my comment is arguing that even if the system were flawless at recording cars leaving it would still be unfair... and that's just as true with your modification as without."
SanJose,321y5t,hacksoncode,6,Fri Apr 10 01:35:08 2015 UTC,"A swipe in/swipe out system is not unfair. It's a simple process with minimal effort that is, if anything, more fair to everyone as it ensures you don't overpay. People forgetting to swipe out doesn't make the system unfair, it makes them absentminded, and that is nobodies fault but their own.  Also, it wasn't ""my"" modification. I didn't post the idea, /u/reddRad did."
SanJose,321y5t,DuckyFreeman,-1,Fri Apr 10 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"Sure... you might note that my original comment said ""or get a refund for the unused amount"". Which is what swiping would do in the case where you remembered to do it, if there's a max."
SanJose,321y5t,hacksoncode,3,Fri Apr 10 01:57:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, I note that. But when I joined the conversation, you were implying that a system that required active participation from the driver was as unfair as a system with a flawed design that failed during normal operation. You followed that up with reinforcing your argument that even with people being required to actively check out of their spot, the system would still be unfair, which is what I disagree with."
SanJose,321y5t,DuckyFreeman,2,Fri Apr 10 02:06:47 2015 UTC,"Downtown parking spots are a scare resource and that's why there are costs and time limits. If you're going to be there all day you go to a garage which allows all day parking. But yes, we can do way better, but it's tough to get sane policies when there are profit and revenue motives from the private companies running these meters and the city, respectively. [I don't know if private companies are involved in SJ but they certainly are in other cities around the US]"

SanJose,321y5t,quadshock,3,Thu Apr 9 23:03:25 2015 UTC,I think you're reading it wrong. They're saying you have to dispute it yourself when you are sure you've paid.
SanJose,321y5t,bikerwalla,3,Fri Apr 10 00:04:51 2015 UTC,"If they're going to zero-out the meter when the parked car exits (scummy as that is), they should do it right, and embed a simple wire loop under each parking space. This is how traffic light controlled intersections detect when a car is stopped at a red light, so they can cycle the lights on the cross street; it's proven to work. Of course, that would cost more in pavement repair afterwards. The city took the lowest bid, meaning the cheapest solution."
SanJose,321y5t,learnintofly,3,Fri Apr 10 13:55:28 2015 UTC,Is it proven not to be affected by heavy trucks in the next lane?
SanJose,321y5t,bikerwalla,2,Fri Apr 10 16:16:24 2015 UTC,"It should be the next thing to try, if they're committing a change in parking meter technology, they should made sure that it doesn't fail so egregiously. A big bass system in a car might rock these meters."
SanJose,320cw0,meth0dz,8,Thu Apr 9 15:50:37 2015 UTC,"So PG&E and other utilities are alerting everyone that they will always call beforehand and let you know they are coming.

SanJose,320cw0,SoapBoxOne,6,Thu Apr 9 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"This is not alway true, unfortunately.  As a PG&E contractor, I wish they always did - it makes my job a lot easier.  I would suggest concerned folks ask to see both PGE and contractor IDs on people who ask for access to the yard or some other sort of proof, like a door hangar or business card - everyone with PGE has IDs and likely business cards and doorcards."

You could spend all day just checking out our 2 spectacular rose gardens.   Or go to Santa Cruz. Or Big Basin. Or Half Moon Bay. Or a beer tour. Or various museums. Or having a spa day. Or riding on the river/bay trails.   Or the other stuff people mention... I've done Yosemite many times as a day trip... can confirm. That's probably the best choice... if it sounds good at all.
SanJose,3218wm,hacksoncode,5,Thu Apr 9 23:26:43 2015 UTC,"im assuming your starting point is SJ since you posted here so...   livermore, if you're a big wine drinker. its going to be a really nice weekend to go wine tasting. they have a bus that will take you to 3-5 wineries and drop you back off in downtown livermore for dinner at the end of the day pinnacles national monument, if you're willing to take a ""short"" drive, there's beautiful views and lots of interesting formations from what was an old volcano. bring hiking shoes, camera, lots of water and lunch! san luis obispo, if you're willing to drive even further. about 2.5-3hours. stop by firestone bbq and grab lunch, hitup avila beach and have a drink or two. leave by 5PM before the marine layer hits and drive back home"
SanJose,3218wm,efects,3,Thu Apr 9 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"For Livermore, drive up to Mount Hamilton, check out the observatory, then take Mines Road down the back of the hills and into Livermore. It's a nice drive with very little traffic. Make sure you have a reliable car, as it might be a pain to get assistance since it's fairly remote. Let someone know you're going and when to expect to hear from you."

SanJose,3211z5,tripsd,3,Thu Apr 9 21:17:39 2015 UTC,I will be moving from Los Angeles. I will be sharing the apartment with another guy. We want to pay around $1100-$1250 each. We are used to paying around $800 for a single room.
SanJose,3211z5,getMeSomeDunkin,2,Thu Apr 9 21:29:10 2015 UTC,"Whatever you choose, you want to stay close to Cisco. 237, 101, 880 (and 680 too) is like the trifecta of shit traffic. I personally wouldn't want to deal with it every day."
SanJose,3211z5,sarlac,3,Mon Apr 13 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"Try to avoid 880 and 101 for daily commute.  Traffic is quickly approaching that of LA, and I'm betting that's something you would be happy to leave behind.  There is a fair amount of new housing going up around San Jose -- avoid that too as it is +/-$2,500 for a single bedroom apartment.  Generally avoid the east side (Alum Rock) to start.  Japantown (north of downtown San Jose) is a good balance of affordability/safety.  A lot of blue collar workers with families.  Santa Clara (west of San Jose) is nice, but will be more expensive.  You could check Berryessa, I don't know a ton about that area.  Another option would be Milpitas which might get you something closer to Cisco.  Freemont is more of a bedroom community -- you'll get something cheaper, but also less local amenities.  Happy hunting!"
SanJose,3211z5,getMeSomeDunkin,2,Thu Apr 9 23:38:32 2015 UTC,"Generally avoid the east side (Alum Rock) to start.   Can confirm. Moved from Campbell to East SJ. Housing is cheaper, but everything generally sucks. Now anything I want to do, I hop in the car and drive anywhere else but East San Jose.  My old Safeway was big, well lit, clean, and decent vegetables, etc. The one over here (still a Safeway) was dim and dirty and smelled like a nice urine/vomit mixture.

Ie: historic preservation, landscape, architecture these firms can be from anywhere including national/international. Threshold: 1. Anything inside expanded downtown core area that meets ant of the following: 75ft+ in height, or on a site greater than 0.5 acres, or over 20.000SF 2. Buildings outside downtown core 6+ stories 3. Buildings with Urban Villages and Growth Areas with proposed development of 1.0 FAR or greater.  Second tier is reviewed in house. Threshold: any of the following 1. Within downtown core 2. Between 3-6 stories 3. Sits within historic district 4. Sits with historic structures or adjacent to historic structures 5. Buildings with Urban Villages and Growth Areas with proposed development less than 1.0 FAR.  Also the city is hiring a dedicate Urban Planner/Designer by the end of summer."

Not a ton going on downtown, but downtown is where I live and the place to be.  I'm from Los Angeles and have lived in San Jose for the last four years.  The traffic here isn't as bad as LA traffic but it's close.  Living downtown means you will have the option of walking to get food, groceries, movie theaters, bars, music, comedy, yadda yadda...  The water in San Jose sucks, but then again I don't know how it is in Philly.  Try the thai food, viet food, basically anything asian.  Pizza here isn't the pizza you know and love.  I don't drink, but if you like beer this area is a haven for beer enthusiasts.  You will find new and interesting beer every week.  San Jose has a reputation for a high male to female ratio.

SanJose,31wg89,undiurnal,5,Wed Apr 8 20:47:10 2015 UTC,"Downtown is probably the way to go (it's where I live). You could also try Willow Glen or Campbell. If you make a ton of money and like being around other people with lots of money, Los Gatos ain't half bad. Japantown is nice, low-key, but still walking distance from downtown.  The Good: Downtown has REALLY improved in the last five years and is now totally decent. Excellent food, especially Asian. The bar (not club) scene is solid, with a handful of craft cocktail and beer specialty joints. For a downtown area, parking is cheap and plentiful in SJ. The Earthquakes still kinda suck, but their new pitch is brilliant; definitely worth attending a match. Outside of town there are tons of outdoorsy activities if you're so inclined. The weather is fantastic. We basically laugh at the rest of the Bay (SF and Oakland get cold and cloudy and the Walnut Creek, Pleasanton, etc. get bloody hot). Finally, there are Farmer's Markets most of the year and they're awesome.  The Bad: Traffic sucks if you need to get anywhere at rush hour (not so bad otherwise). Transit is pretty good downtown, but pretty crap for most of the metro area. The music and club scene is very hit-and-miss. There's a big gap between local bar-grade musicians and stadium-fillers as mid-level bands tend to frequent SF or sometimes Santa Cruz. Depending on where you are in town, your water may be super-hard.  The Ugly: Housing is crazy expensive. Crazy. Expensive. Crazy. Renting a room isn't so bad, but if you want your own, decent place, expect to pay out the nose. San Jose's downtown is small and while it's alright now, for decades it fully earned a reputation for being crap. Expect super extra smugness from San Franciscans and Berkeley-types, and derision from some locals who haven't given downtown a serious look since the '00s.  Other stuff: The homeless problem is certainly extant, but honestly it's overblown. I don't find it any worse than most major US cities, and it's WAY better than SF (whose homeless can be quite aggressive). Similarly, crime is actually pretty low in San Jose, but a continued budget stand-off between the cops and local government has made things testy. That said, don't expect your nuisance report to be investigated. Lastly: have friends in San Francisco or the East Bay? Awesome! You'll never see them. SF is 60 miles of hellacious traffic and world's worst parking away (or, alternatively, two hours and several annoying transfers of transit), and no one goes to Oakland. While there's a fair amount of cross-traffic across the Bay Bridge, the South Bay is kinda a thing unto its own."

SanJose,31u1tc,zapdos,10,Wed Apr 8 03:47:13 2015 UTC,"Heyo!  I've been going to Fanime since 2006.  You don't have to be a hardcore anime fan, there's a lot of people there who aren't into anime at all. [For years, I wasn't.  I liked video games and movies and cartoons.  Only recently have I started watching some anime again.]  It's more of a general fan convention lately, a lot of western media shares space with Japanese media since people have multiple interests.  The crowd is pretty varied from younger kids to older fans.  There's a LOT of people in downtown during that time though, but if you don't mind parking in garages with a fee it's not too bad.  There's garages all over the immediate area and I'm sure you can look it up.  I think you'll have fun if you go there with an open mind!  It might be a little overwheming 'cause there's a lot of stuff going around.  But depends on what you're interested in.  There's official and fan-run panels, screenings of anime/movies, cosplay gatherings [the big ones are always fun], the dealers hall to buy stuff, game room with machines and consoles and tabletop, and the artist alley for people selling artwork [I'm usually there tabling].  Personally I don't do much besides sell in the artist alley and dress up for a cosplay gathering."
SanJose,31u1tc,modernviolinist,7,Wed Apr 8 05:34:44 2015 UTC,"Tips:   Bring a camera!  People are gonna be dressing up, and some cosplays are really, really good. Bring a drink/snack if you plan on being there for awhile.  Or eat beforehand.  Food in the con is expensive. Be prepared to navigate through a huge crowd of people.  Get ready for it to be hot and smell funny. The closest garage parking is connected to the event center.  The entrance is on Market street between San Salvador and San Carlos st."
SanJose,31u1tc,modernviolinist,6,Wed Apr 8 05:41:16 2015 UTC,"I've been going to Fanime since 2011 and am a volunteer for the PC branch (we're told we're being wrapped up with consoles for one big jam).  PLEASE, PLEASE DRINK WATER. Not soda, not beer, not juice. Water. A ton of people get sick and wind up having to leave the con early, or worse, call EMTs, because they weren't drinking. On that note, PLEASE eat something vaguely healthy. I did a eat-nothing-but-cheap-McDonalds-because-I-could-barely-afford-the-con diet for 2012 and it isn't worth it."
SanJose,31u1tc,JayrassicPark,3,Wed Apr 8 06:32:45 2015 UTC,^ Totally agree.  I remember a few years back seeing people obviously very tired and/or sick looking in the artist alley and I would offer them an unopened water bottle just so hopefully they wouldn't collapse. To OP:  There's a Safeway like 2 blocks from the con and a lot of food around downtown that isn't McDonalds/Jack In the Box [those places will be super crowded anyway].
SanJose,31u1tc,modernviolinist,2,Wed Apr 8 07:05:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are tons of people who aren't interested in anime at all and are there for the comic book cosplays or video game stuff. It weirded me out when I shared a room in 2012 and 2013 with guys who did nothing but game all night and sleep through the day convention."
SanJose,31u1tc,JayrassicPark,2,Wed Apr 8 06:29:32 2015 UTC,I'm thinking about taking the bus to the convention center (so I don't have to park). Is that a good idea?
SanJose,31u1tc,modernviolinist,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:51:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a transit center right across from the convention center.  The lightrail stops there, and I'm sure some bus lines do too.  If anything, most stops shouldn't be long of a walk there."
SanJose,31u1tc,JayrassicPark,4,Thu Apr 9 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"Of note, if you want to get a taste of Fanime, check out Big Wow Comicfest from 18-19, though it's gotten big in the past few years (last year took up 3/4ths of the convention hall, as compared to 2013, where it used 1/4ths). Same location as Fanime, and more comics oriented. It's moderately populated and doesn't approach Fanime levels of crowded, and has a bigger number of guests of honor, as compared to Fanime."

SanJose,31u1tc,return2ozma,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:16:18 2015 UTC,I've never been but I have hung out around outside of the convention center to people watch. Always tons of cosplay and great people.
SanJose,31u1tc,undiurnal,0,Wed Apr 8 07:25:12 2015 UTC,"We live downtown and attend every year. Fanime is, in my opinion, the most fun of the major (e.g. A|X, Sakura, Anime Boston, etc.) anime cons.   (1) There are lots of different rooms with different things going on. If you like screenings, there are a half-dozen rooms dedicated to them. Mostly subs, but some dubs for people so-inclined. As it sounds like you're into gaming, one large hall of the convention center is dedicated to it, with board games, vintage consoles, modern consoles, computers, and cabinet machines. Only the cabinets eat coins.  There are also many impromptu board/card games going on around the convention center. Most people are pretty friendly if you'd like to join in and the game has the capacity for additional players.  As others have mentioned, there are also industry and fan panels, which range from informative to goofy to dry to salacious. The 18+ panels can be especially fun, if risque.  The dealer hall and artist alley are excellent time-killers, too, and not solely anime/manga. Lots of gaming, especially vintage console stuff, costuming, and art supplies.  There's also dancing at night--mostly electronica but also the Black & White formal--and usually a concert or two. The quality of the latter depends on the artist(s), naturally.  (2) The crowds can be pretty overwhelming. The convention center (and downtown, generally) get packed. It's a lot of fun with tons of cosplay, but sometimes a challenge to navigate. If you don't like crowds, take a break at one of the nearby parks for a while.  Though not as bad as other cons, popular panels and events do have queues and the most popular will go to capacity. If there's something you really want to see, be prepared to line up an hour ahead of time. (Bring a card game or your DS and make friends with your fellow queuers!).  Overall, there is parking downtown, but you're gonna have to pay for it, and you may have to walk a few blocks to the con. Alternatively, light rail stops right in front of the convention center so is another alternative. Lots of con-goers take it.  (3) Tips  Water--drink it. Food--eat it. Camera--bring it. Bathe--do it. Deodorant--wear it.  If you want a picture of a cosplayer, ask and they'll usually happily pose for you. Don't touch unless the cosplayer initiates it.  If you plan to cosplay, go for it. It doesn't have to be super impressive. Lazy cosplay is awesome. Just check the con rules on cosplay weapons if you plan to have them.  Look at the schedule and come up with a loose plan for the day. There's a lot going on, so usually a few good options available for any given time slot.  The restaurants and cafes immediate to the convention center get PACKED. If you're willing to a walk a few blocks, San Pedro Market and further parts of SoFA tend to have more manageable crowds.  Most of all: have fun. If what you're doing isn't fun, wander to a different part of the con ;)"

SanJose,31s6fk,dscreations,4,Tue Apr 7 20:14:49 2015 UTC,"If you work in downtown Palo Alto, the commute from Diridon Station will take approximately 25 minutes on a bullet Caltrain. From there you need to find out how you can get to Diridon in 20 minutes.  Like dscreations said, the Alameda area (bus 22/522), downtown (DASH, 63, 64, 65, etc.), Japantown (Lightrail) would work. Potentially you could also live along the light rail going either North or South (to Campbell). Willow Glen has buses 63 and 64 that go to Diridon."

SanJose,31s6fk,iKs279,3,Wed Apr 8 18:42:46 2015 UTC,"That's great. Looks like DASH only runs downtown then, like was mentioned earlier. So if in Campbell, I'd have to use light rail to get to Cal Train. Does light rail operate similarly, being free to use with or without a Cal Train pass?"
SanJose,31s6fk,Photosaurus,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:49:46 2015 UTC,"If you have a two (or more) zone monthly cal train pass on your clipper card, it includes a monthly VTA pass in the price."
SanJose,31s6fk,magelanz,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:43:58 2015 UTC,"My office is close to PA Station, walkable. Īm guessing thats downtown?"
SanJose,31s6fk,nickosaur,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:21:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, the Palo Alto Caltrain station is downtown Palo Alto. That's where Stanford University is as well. There's also a California Avenue station that's for the ""business district"" (which also has a bunch of restaurants etc.) but the bullet trains don't stop there so it takes a bit longer."
SanJose,31s6fk,iKs279,4,Wed Apr 8 15:51:11 2015 UTC,"Try searching ZIP codes 95110 and 95126 on Zillow. Both are downtown, walking distance to shops and restaurants with easy (or at least as easy as it gets around here) access to 87/280/101 as well as Caltrain/VTA.   Depending on what you're looking for, you could also look in the 95112 area, though at a certain point you lose the walkability factor, at least to the major downtown attractions."
SanJose,31s6fk,nickosaur,3,Tue Apr 7 23:14:20 2015 UTC,"Consider the Avalon apartments in Campbell. They're close enough to walk to downtown Campbell, the Pruneyard, and the light rail stations. It's kind of a pain to get on 17 from there, but it should be less than an hour commute to Palo Alto most times of day."
SanJose,31s6fk,magelanz,3,Tue Apr 7 21:16:07 2015 UTC,"+1. I live walking distance from light rail and downtown. Takes me about 45m to get to Palo Alto on Caltrain if you include walking and ""layover"". If you get a monthly Caltrain pass for $232, light rail (vta) is included. DT Campbell is great and seems to be getting better and better in the year and a half we've lived here. Great access to highways and only 30m from Santa Cruz as well. Also http://walkscore.com is great for checking out what's close by to potential places you want to live."
SanJose,31s6fk,bitchandcomplain,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:46:22 2015 UTC,"The Caltrain pass should be $176 only, right? It does include unlimited VTA and SamTrans non-express buses/lightrail, which is nice."
SanJose,31s6fk,hacksoncode,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:54:08 2015 UTC,That's cheap! I live in NJ and commute to NY currently and pay upwards of $400 per month and $100 per month to park (doesn't include subway costs once getting to NY either!)
SanJose,31s6fk,bitchandcomplain,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:24:45 2015 UTC,Oh yea you're probably right! I take the train to San Francisco.
SanJose,31s6fk,efects,1 point,Thu Apr 9 03:57:16 2015 UTC,Whats the 17?
SanJose,31s6fk,bitchandcomplain,2,Wed Apr 8 12:11:08 2015 UTC,"17 is the main highway that goes through Campbell. It'll take you north to 880 and 280 (which is what you'd take to get to Palo Alto), and south to 85 and all the way down to Santa Cruz. It's actually right behind the Avalon apartments, but you need to go all the way down to San Tomas or all the way up to Hamilton to get onto the highway."
SanJose,31s6fk,efects,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:04:27 2015 UTC,"thanks for the info, appreciate it!"
SanJose,31s6fk,bitchandcomplain,3,Wed Apr 8 18:21:07 2015 UTC,If you work on the west side of Palo Alto (near HP/VMWare/Lockheed/SAP) then you can pretty much live anywhere on the 280.  For 45 minute commutes or less I would look for something west of the 87/280 interchange.   Willow Glen/Campbell/Cupertino/....
SanJose,31s6fk,hacksoncode,5,Tue Apr 7 22:11:43 2015 UTC,the 280   I detect someone who's somewhat recently moved here from LA...  :-).
SanJose,31s6fk,carpe_diem1977,2,Tue Apr 7 22:48:50 2015 UTC,"It seems to be a dead giveaway. Moved 7 years ago but i can't seem to drop ""the""...  In my defense I lived in a small city that only had a single freeway, ""the"" 101, going through it so it was ""the"" freeway..."
SanJose,31s6fk,iKs279,2,Tue Apr 7 22:59:45 2015 UTC,"its still pretty bad west of the 87/280 interchange. during peak rush hour, you're looking at an hour to get to PA. worse on the way home since 280 basically jams up from los altos all the way to the 87/280 interchange"
SanJose,31s6fk,seanhead,2,Tue Apr 7 22:14:54 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on when you commute.  It takes me about 25 minutes from Willow Glen to Palo Alto (Page mill area) if I leave before 6:30.  35 minutes if I leave by 7:15.  I'm sure it progressively gets worse as the commute gets more congested so you are probably right if you leave anytime after 7:30.  Commute home around 4 takes about 45 minutes so probably wouldn't meet the 45 minute cutoff time later in the day.  Foothill road is pretty consistent down to the 280 so I find myself taking that route frequently when Waze directs me there.  Perhaps west of the 880/17 would be a more constant < 45 minute commute.  Traffic builds up pretty bad between 87 and 880 on the 280...
SanJose,31rgp8,return2ozma,3,Tue Apr 7 16:19:08 2015 UTC,"You should go to the meeting. Much more detailed prints and layouts. This is the type of idea as a community we need to push the city and developers in to, not instant return strip malls. We have enough of those.  edit* housing is meant for affordable housing for senior citizens and veterans. They'll be able to tend gardens and sell those goods to the community."
SanJose,31rgp8,HappyWabbit,2,Tue Apr 7 16:30:40 2015 UTC,I agree. Just trying to get the info out there for whoever is interested.

SanJose,31s9dy,broadwaysanjose,2,Tue Apr 7 19:39:02 2015 UTC,What's the offer?
SanJose,31s9dy,ooohchiiild,2,Wed Apr 8 01:34:22 2015 UTC,I understand it's for Once. I was just wondering what the discount itself is.
SanJose,31q7ob,cl76,6,Tue Apr 7 08:28:06 2015 UTC,"I paid $88/yr and renewed at $75. Not sure if they'll keep the same plan but it's a steal at less than $7/mo. I ride from SJ Caltrain to the SJSU pool, to MUJI and Camera 12, to SPSM to catch the bus to Avaya, and all the flat places you can get to in SF from BART and Caltrain. Don't have to worry about it getting stolen, carrying a bike up stairs to the house, or maintenance. They're ugly and heavy and only have seven gears but I have 0 attachment and they're purely utilitarian vehicles. As long as the stations and bikes are well maintained, which I've had issues with a couple of times a while back, I'm all for more stations and bikes. Along the Alameda would be great."
SanJose,31q7ob,leaningfizz,2,Tue Apr 7 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking of signing up for this reason. I have a bike, but I don't feel comfortable parking it downtown because of how common theft is. With the bike share people don't have to worry about that."
SanJose,31q7ob,quadshock,2,Tue Apr 7 18:05:33 2015 UTC,Have you ever ridden to a destination with no more places to park? What happens then?  What about stations that run out of bikes? Just out of luck?
SanJose,31q7ob,dscreations,5,Tue Apr 7 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"I believe that if you show up at a stations with no available docks, then you can hit a button stating that it's full and you get a brief time extension to head to the next closest station.  You can mostly avoid this by using an app like Spotcycle which tracks availability (there other apps that also do this and you can also check the BABS station map on their site for the same info)."
SanJose,31q7ob,Alexplanation,3,Tue Apr 7 19:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not much to add to /u/dscreations. They have an app ""CycleFinder"" which lets you know the status of each station but I've actually never run into empty or full stations in SJ. They also have a van that goes around and redistributes bikes when needed.  I have seen completely full and empty situations at the SF Caltrain station at peak commute times or game days, though, and at that point you are out of luck. Most stations are within walking distance of another but, yeah, it does mess with your schedule."
SanJose,31q7ob,quadshock,3,Tue Apr 7 20:12:57 2015 UTC,I'm delighted by this.  Having them around and visible makes cycling seem like less of a terrifying endeavor.

SanJose,31q7ob,Luke1981,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:05:05 2015 UTC,Really badly implemented.  Can't use without annual pass being super expensive.

Also block of some paths to bikes only
SanJose,31q7ob,DirtyD27,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"They already have a bike share at the San Jose flea market. Vendors there take all our stolen bikes, spray paint them and share their profit with bike thieves.   Twice in the last week I saw guys with about a dozen bikes strapped to a grocery cart pushing their way down Monterey towards the flea market. Always lots of children's bikes to be had there. What a bunch of jerks."
SanJose,31q7ob,Cheesejaguar,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:27:37 2015 UTC,I really hate these things. I've never seen anyone using them because they're overpriced and if you ride a bike around town regularly you probably have your own bike.
SanJose,31q7ob,OleDeadwoodDick,6,Tue Apr 7 10:18:45 2015 UTC,"I see people riding them all the time, but that's also possibly because I ride my bike to and from work every day.  You should see the CalTrain station, sometimes they even run out of bikes."

But I'm thinking at 4:00PM my return journey will be hectic and time consuming. $200 difference is bugging me ( considering $100 for fuel and effort ). Gated apartments in 10 miles radius from Cisco are around $2000 for 650 sq feet. I got lucky when north park offered me 800 sq ft apartment at $2300 (same floor plan costs $2700 on 4th floor). But again, I cant pre-assess my efforts and time in commute for next few years today. I want to save 3k per year as well :D"

SanJose,31nf0z,xsimplicity,2,Mon Apr 6 18:04:45 2015 UTC,"I would save the money. I mean, you get to be with your wife forever.

SanJose,31nf0z,xsimplicity,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:32:41 2015 UTC,"THIS, is exactly what I have been thinking about. But CritFailingLife raised a valid point about the depreciation and gas charges according to IRS for my commute. What do you think?"
SanJose,31nf0z,xsimplicity,2,Mon Apr 6 18:48:11 2015 UTC,"Her point is very valid, but it's based on IRS's cost.   Calculate your own cost for your car. I drive a hybrid, so I spend like $10 on gas a week to commute to Bart (40 miles a day). But if you're driving a huge truck, then it's obviously more, and maybe not worth it.   About the depreciation, it's a car, it's going to depreciate either way. If you have a reliable car, like a Honda or something, then you'll most likely be good for the long run. If you have a BMW, then be wary (I only say BMW, because I had one and it fucked me at 40k miles). If you take good care of the car, you should be good, but now I'm giving car advice haha.   And again, you can always move when you pay off the loan. If you didn't have this loan, I would also say live in North Park!"

You bought a car to drive it, well knowing that there is maintenance involved. Plus, I doubt he will be living there forever/driving that same car forever/working there forever.  And to have outstanding student loans that won't be paid off sooner... I personally don't like debt, so I am showing OP it's not all based on present convenience. What if he would like to purchase a house later and can't since he still has loans to pay off, who knows what situations could happen.  So it might be shortsighted and ""silly"" to you, but to each their own. OP will obviously think it over and decide what's best for his family."

You would easily save yourself 30+ hours a month in commuting so unless you value your time @ less $10 an hour you should pick northpark.  Commuting is brutal.  You can beat the traffic in the morning if you leave by 6am but there is no good time in the evening....
SanJose,31nf0z,pointman,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:03:13 2015 UTC,Don't forget wear and tear on your car/gas consumption. The IRS values this at $0.575 currently. A 20 mile commute should be figured as costing almost $500 per month.

When that guy graduated and left the clinic, the new person they put me with wasn't even worth the reduced cost so I stopped going.  I also have a friend who worked for a catering company who provided meals for the students.  She had nothing but good things to say about the students there.  I have referred some people there for cheap care, but really, the clinic is hit or miss, depending on who you get as your student guy and how often the head guy makes his rounds in to fix things."

A lot of the students lived in North Park and I did get kind of a college frat bro vibe from most of them but they were never any trouble. The area is definitely safe, and it's right off light rail, which is the closest thing the South Bay has to working public transit.   I can't say what actually being a student there is like. Pretty much all of my interns have been overachievers so usually they seem like they're stressed out."

Those places tend to get booked a little more quickly.  I'd agree with Henry Coe as well, mainly because it's a lesser known SP and you'll be more likely to get the spots you need.  It's a drive, but if all else fails Pinnacles just south of Hollister wouldn't be a bad choice either."

Only the top floor is open at the moment and it was packed when I went. The owner showed me around the unopened underground floor which is going to be an all PC gaming floor. I thought it was pretty neat. He told me they plan to implement a subscription service or a service where a drink buys you X amount of time to play once they have their official opening April 17 but till then it's pretty much unlimited play time to anyone.

Enjoy chartering your own vessel and take advantage of the three reefs they have in the area.  Cod are easy, you just drop your gear straight to the bottom.  Stagnaros out of Santa Cruz has more options for the types of fish you can venture out for (salmon, rock cod, sand dabs & whale watching).  I just came back from a Stagnaros trip for salmon yesterday and it was productive for me but the fish aren't biting much.  Out of the 30 or so people fishing, 5 salmon were brought on board.  I believe you can rent kayaks on the Capitola pier as well."

SanJose,31hr1v,blbd,7,Sun Apr 5 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"I never wrote it down and would have trouble doing it if I wasnt actively making it.  HOWEVER, it all starts here.    EDIT FYI: this will take a little experimenting on your part like I have over the years.  I generally make it by taste and consistency and not by quantity of ingredients.  Bad habit but I guess thats the grandma part of my lazy dude brain.  I got it EXACTLY like La Vics years ago and have since forgot what I did then because I have changed it slightly to make it mine.  Everyone that comes over for parties kills it and says its better than theirs.  We all grew up hitting La Vics after shows in SJ, so were extremely familiar.   Use half-ish the lime juice, sub the jalapenos for chipotles (i use the canned ones in adobo and include the adobo but this gives it a little more smokeyness more like Iguanas, just been my preference after messing with this recipe over the years), slightly less oil and add some water to get the consistency right, maybe a tablespoon of red chile flakes, a serrano with the seeds and the same amount of garlic they say in the recipe.  Usually I take some of the oil before hand and get a saute on the whole peeled garlic and the whole serrano, not really browned or anything just fragrant, getting the serrano a little bubbly.  Toss everything in the blender until smooth as fuck, probably longer than you would think you would need to blend but I like to really break down the chile flakes so they dont get stuck in the tip of the bottle. salt to taste. Thats basically it.  http://imgur.com/MoTnaY4  As you can see mine is slightly darker than La Vics, just because I choose to add that extra adobo instead of omitting it.  Without it it would be right on to La Vics.  As a side note I did talk to an old friend who now works at Iguanas and he said their sauce involves mayo and bbq sauce.  not fun but too delicious  And here I am letting out all the secrets..."

SanJose,31hr1v,TristanwithaT,3,Sun Apr 5 04:54:08 2015 UTC,Well sealed is the key phrase. I had a bottle of orange sauce detonate in my second fridge when I stored it there too long. I imagine the pressure change of flight could wreck havoc in a poorly sealed ziplock inside of a suitcase.
SanJose,31hr1v,stevil501,2,Sun Apr 5 21:12:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about it. It's less than a day, and even if it turns out that it isn't a ""refridgerate after opening"" situation (which I think it is), then the sauce doesn't contain any meat or dairy so as long as it's sealed and hasn't been contaminated, less than 24 hours in a suitcase shouldn't hurt it."

SanJose,31hr1v,AHPpilot,1 point,Sun Apr 5 08:04:07 2015 UTC,Hahah my cousin flies back to Florida in the morning and we had this same discussion. It doesn't need to be refridgerated unless it already was. Ask La Vics if they have any that haven't been stored in the cooler first.
SanJose,31hr1v,CptDanger88,1 point,Sun Apr 5 08:39:08 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen this suggested yet but, ship with dry ice!  Stop by any Smart and Final, they sell the stuff.  You'll want to put the sauce and the dry ice in a insulating container (think small styrofoam cooler) and wrap it up in paper.  Don't make it airtight!    You can make the dry ice last even longer by freezing the orange sauce before packing it."

SanJose,31frzs,Black_Astra,3,Sun Apr 5 22:55:42 2015 UTC,"Hey before you reply, gonna type some crime theory stuff out there...  Wait for the edit.  What a lot of folks don't realize is most of our social issues are systemic, butterfly effect type of things.  If you look at a crime like theft, it usually boils down to not having the opportunity to earn money for the items they wish to purloin.  When a person is at the level with no socks, undies, etc... They resort to stealing not because they're some evil person, but they want to feel comfortable in their own skin again.  Another point to make here is, the angels are viewed as ""not cops""  Homeless folks know everything that goes on in the streets.  They all talk, they see it all, and can be an incredible source of information as long as they're not afraid of the people talking to them.  This is another philosophy that ties in with the GA's overall goals of helping to solve and prevent crimes.   We can befriend, talk to the homeless where the police cannot."
SanJose,31frzs,Black_Astra,2,Sun Apr 5 23:36:43 2015 UTC,"I know it tends to be more systematic, especially when it comes to the homeless in downtown, but what sort of preventative measures are in place to deal with more violent offenders? Obviously you can make citizens arrests, but what policy/procedures are the GA going to use? Is the group trying to get certified to use pepper spray, or are they going to be more observe and report?"
SanJose,31frzs,Black_Astra,2,Sun Apr 5 23:53:25 2015 UTC,"Observe and report.   The organization has never condoned, nor carried weapons, and I think the citizen arrest stuff is a rarity and not the norm these days.  Maybe in extreme situations where someone's life is danger and someone needs to be detained (Example, if we ever broke up a rape and needed to hold a rapist till the cops came) but otherwise it's pretty hands off.  Also we have video these days.  :) That was us last night in Modesto.   I'm not sure if it's that way everywhere within the GA, but I do know it's this way in the NorCal chapters."

SanJose,31frzs,jennydath,2,Mon Apr 6 00:27:01 2015 UTC,"Some of us have guard cards (I'm about to get mine, $65 online course, not really difficult)  but unfortunately the organization suffers from a bit of not being able to escape it's past.  Certainly it started off with 13 tough guys keeping the NYC subways safe, but it's evolved a lot since then.  There's a lot of youth outreach and mentoring programs.  They also operate ""Angels Houses"", properties either granted, bought or rented by the organization for members that have advanced enough to live at.  There's been quite a few homeless folks that have been brought off the streets after months of patrolling.  Last night in Modesto we reached out to one young homeless man.  I gave him some socks and bought him a grand slam slugger at Denny's.  We promised if he showed up at that denny's when we meet, we'd buy him some food.  I would bet that if he follows through, in 3 months he'll be living at the Stockton Angel house.  My chapter is really starting to connect with local homeless programs that want us to be their distribution arm.   http://www.itsasak.org/ got in touch with me via facebook, and we're meeting next week to start talking about them supplying us with basic comfort items (socks, underwear, toothbrush,fem. hygiene) To date, I've been supplying that on our Norcal patrols out of pocket."

SanJose,318mjm,dontmatterdontcare,25,Thu Apr 2 21:36:46 2015 UTC,It is legal to wash your car in san jose but there are rules.  Here is the city web page that covers it: http://www.sanjoseca.gov/index.aspx?nid=4375  Basically you have two rules: 1) Hose must have an automatic shut-off nozzle on it so you don't sit there and water your driveway  2)  It is not allowed to let anything but clean rain flow down a storm drain  City recommends using a professional car wash location as they typically recycle their water and don't allow runoff to the storm drains.
SanJose,318mjm,SanJose_,5,Thu Apr 2 21:48:42 2015 UTC,"Another method that works well for me. If you've got a front lawn, drive up onto it and wash your car their. Let the grass and soil soak up all the water and soap."

It saddens me to hear that anyone loses their lives, and these people do deserve the utmost respect.  I can understand their fellow officers and friends showing up to the funeral. I can understand a few representatives from local departments with whom this officer worked.  I don't understand 50 officers with vehicles coming down from San Francisco. I don't understand 20 officers coming from Chicago. I don't understand thousands of police using taxpayer funds to fly across the country to show up at a government sanctioned event where they've paid tens of thousands of dollars to rent out a sports stadium.  There are so many officers, from such different places, that this is more like a holiday cruise, and less like a show of respect for someone who has passed away.

Gourmet Haus Staudt in Redwood City, Tied House in Mountain View, Firehouse in Sunnyvale and then I'd say finish it at Original Gravity downtown San Jose on 1st. If you want to grab food hit up San Pedro Square Market or Back A Yard, Original Gravity has really great sausages too. If you don't want to wander too far from the San Jose Diridon station then the Whole Food right across the street is your place. They've got an awesome beer garden that opened up in December and they brew their own beer.  TL;DR: Beer"

SanJose,312gpf,maflickner,3,Wed Apr 1 21:59:36 2015 UTC,"If you're coming from San Fran and ending up in San Jose and doing 4 stops, one way tickets are valid 4 hours from purchase time. Looks like a one way for 4 zones would be $9.25, and a day pass for 4 zones would be $18.50. So It really depends how the schedule shakes out and how long you decide to stay at each bar. Tickets can be paid for with a card at the station, there are ticket machines you can use."

The airport is close to DTSJ if you choose the Lyft/Uber/Taxi option.

Asshole number #1 I have one elderly neighbor who doesn't want anyone to park in front of his house because he thinks that if someone tries to visit him and sees someone parked there they will think hes busy and not want to visit...   Asshole #2 Leaves notes on your car if you park in front of his house if your car doesn't move in 24 hours.  Asshole #3 This asshole is the worst right here.  He has a two car garage behind his house and no back yard.  Instead of a yard there is just a massive concrete area to park between the house and garage.  Does this asshole park there?  No he leaves his second car parked in front of his house taking up two spots so no one can park there and hasn't moved it in over 6 months.  This doesn't really bother me that much but then I have to go park and deal with asshole #1 and #2.  Also none of these 3 people have jobs.  They are all older people who probably bought their house back in the 80s and just stare out there window all day mad about all the cars in the neighborhood.  But my roommates and me all have to cram together along with all the other young people in my neighborhood.  So young peoples houses are all going to have 3-5 cars per house and all the old people are pissy about all the extra cars in the neighborhood.    /rant

There are cars on my street that have been there for months. One has been broken for almost 2 years on their front lawn, then recently was moved onto the street, 4 flat tires too. A few of the garages in the area simply leave cars parked on the street when their lot overflows.  I have a driveway and it often gets semi-blocked by people letting their cars front or back hang over the gap.  This is EXTREMELY annoying. There are also others that park over multiple spaces thus constraining the parking availability even further.  I'm not trying to start a flame-war here, more playing devil's advocate with this.

If you look on Google Maps you'll see that Will Rogers Dr has apartment complexes on one side and homes on the other. Residents of these homes often put up cones and any other form of blocking the street next to the sidewalk so no one can park in front of their home. I understand the frustration as there is VERY limited parking for everybody.

Look folks, just pay for the extra parking spot.  The only excuse you should have is if your apartment no longer has spaces available (most do)  I lived at the end of Harris Av for a spell, and ALWAYS had an issue with asshats parking in front of my house.  It's a court of duplexes with parking in the rear, with an apartment complex at the end.   They wouldn't just park for a few hours, there was one guy with a construction truck that would park there for weeks on end.  Multiple times the garbage man passed my trash pickup because he couldn't see my cans.  I'm not condoning someone icepicking your tires, that's pretty effed up, but just pay for the extra spot at your complex.. It's what.. $100@mo at the most?  Cheaper than new tires every week."

When my neighbors don't leave space for me to put out my cans, I place them in the street beside their front driver side tire and the yard waste by their front bumper. Sure, it's a little passive aggresive, but my waste is collected.   And if a car is left for weeks on end in front of my home, I'd call and get that sucker towed. 72 hours."

We want a nice, urban, walkable area, but people also want to be able to park their car right out front and not have to walk anywhere. San Pedro might lose a little parking, but there are plenty of spots on Market, Santa Clara, First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Almaden. Spend five minutes, use your feet, walk a couple of blocks, and enjoy the neighborhood. That garage never should have been built the way it was anyway, and this is an attempt to somewhat rectify it. SP is supposed to be a hip and vibrant spot, but literally half the block is a smelly cement slab that offers nothing but a little bit of convenience."

There are hundreds of empty and unused spots just a couple of minutes away, so the loss of a few dozen spots in this garage shouldn't be a big deal. If you're coming downtown, then you should expect to walk a bit. The garage is convenient but it's also preventing that neighborhood from reaching it's potential."

First time I've attended a ballet performance, ever, but I am a big supporter of local arts. This was FANTASTIC. Really hypnotic and beautiful. Tickets were only $25 each (and we did get seats downstairs). However, I am not interested in going to performances like Cinderella.....so unless they do more work like this, I won't be attending more anytime soon. I hope they do more outside the box productions soon."

SanJose,30v08j,JayrassicPark,3,Tue Mar 31 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, and this is why performances like Bodies of Technology are important, I think. They need to distinguish themselves and also attract new blood."
SanJose,30v08j,beer-and-broccoli,3,Tue Mar 31 15:49:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Instead of playing little brother SJ ballet can focus more on distinguishing themselves from SF with works like that. At least within friends I know who like ballet, they'd rather go to the best (SF) for something like Nutcracker or not at all. They don't really see SJ as the cheaper alternative. I am kind of bummed I couldn't check out the Bodies of Technology show now."
SanJose,30v08j,JayrassicPark,2,Tue Mar 31 17:22:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the way I see it, leaving the traditional performances to SF or even Mountain View/Palo Alto (I'm told they've got some serious ballet chops) will work.

SanJose,30rwb3,cj4900,9,Mon Mar 30 06:35:19 2015 UTC,"I actually have a story which a buddy of mine claimed happened on marsh road last summer. Him and several friends, two cars to be exact, decided to drive up it to check out the view at night and smoke weed and just hang out and just do whatever. While driving up there, the paved road turns into a one lane dirt road which they kept going up and after a while they pulled aside to a nice view overlooking the city. After hanging out there for a little bit, they heard an angry voice yelling at them from across the road up on a hill yelling ""Get the Fuck out of here!"" When my buddies turned to look up at who the hell was yelling at them, they said they saw a silhouette of a man holding a rifle or shotgun at them. They all rushed back to there cars and tried to get out but it since it was a one lane road it took a good minute to back out and make a u turn out of there. My buddy, who claims was in the back seat said that when they finally started pulling away he turned back to look said there was now a bunch of people in the road just staring down the car."

SanJose,30o57z,thumbprint11,20,Sun Mar 29 04:07:26 2015 UTC,Just FYI I would be very cautious if you plan on swimming on any of these beaches suggested.   Panther beach has already been recommended but I would not recommend swimming on the beach.   There are tons of rocks hidden comboed with pretty strong waves could do some damage.   If you do find a patch that is rock free you need to be aware of riptides which can be quite dangerous.  There are some beaches that are swimmable around the board walk of santa cruz and probably more around the bay.   Also just FYI the Pacific is frigid.
SanJose,30o57z,Go_Big,15,Sun Mar 29 05:25:31 2015 UTC,"Normal beach swimming? Just go to Santa Cruz. It's easy, accessible, large, and there's stuff around it for eats.   I'm a personal fan of Natural Bridges. It has tide pools that you can walk on where you will see some sea life. Also some hiking trails.   If you want a little more exclusivity, go to Seascape Hotel. The beach below it is kind of controlled access for hotel guests, but you can walk down to it if you act like you're a guest. Here's a map. Try to park in the blue, walk down the red path. I've been on that beach and seen nobody as far as I could see. It's peaceful."
SanJose,30o57z,DuckyFreeman,7,Sun Mar 29 07:11:00 2015 UTC,Bonny Doon beach is nice  giggles maniacally
SanJose,30o57z,wheresjim,2,Sun Mar 29 18:00:51 2015 UTC,Personally it is my favorite beach.

SanJose,30o57z,radialmodule,6,Sun Mar 29 05:32:15 2015 UTC,Panther Beach and Natural Bridges are both good beaches but they're in Santa Cruz - about a 40 min drive.

SanJose,30o57z,atomicllama1,4,Tue Mar 31 12:39:21 2015 UTC,"""Best beach"" is highly subjective.  Regardless, all the beaches are on the coast, a good hour+ drive away.  Even if you are from Canada, the water is ridiculously cold right now.  Unless you're into polar bear swims, you don't want to go swimming.  Santa Cruz is probably the closest coast to San Jose.  Whether its the best is impossible to say."
SanJose,30o57z,netllama,0,Sun Mar 29 04:12:28 2015 UTC,"Not sure how slow you drive, but beaches can be as close as 20-25 minutes from parts of San Jose (near Los Gatos)"

SanJose,30o57z,netllama,0,Mon Mar 30 14:17:11 2015 UTC,I would say I drive the flow of traffic if not a little bit above. 25 minutes easy from DTLG to waterline with no traffic of course.
SanJose,30o57z,keylime503,2,Mon Mar 30 16:06:12 2015 UTC,No traffic?  Clearly you've never driven 17 during daylight hours.

Personally, I would rather see you as a contributing member to the sub, especially on threads related to politics, but how you want to be seen is entirely up to you.  If you would like others to even begin to take you seriously and read what it is you have to say, I would suggest you keep the complaints about a few upvotes and downvotes to yourself or your friends offline."
SanJose,30nnif,captaintrips420,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:32:53 2015 UTC,what are the main factors you consider when narrowing down your vote? Endorsements? Professional background before running for office? Policy? The candidate's personality from meeting them or watching a debate?  Something else?
SanJose,30nnif,robert_cortese,1 point,Sun Mar 29 13:53:34 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of the Reed faction and what they have done in the city, so I have generally been a fan of candidates interested in creating some kind of labor peace instead of open hostility.  Really tho, I guess I was being a bit racist in my factors in this race.  I have a great amount of respect for the Sikh, and was leaning towards Dhillon for that reason alone.  I guess the gut feeling that a Sikh might actually put the community first compared to the typical politicians we get here.  Orozco would be my second/other choice, with the thought being he is the lesser of the two evils of the main candidates, and wouldn't want my vote for Dhillon to go to 'waste' and allow another Reed related person get into office because of it.  Because voter turnout is so pathetic, every vote actually does matter."
SanJose,30nnif,robert_cortese,0,Sun Mar 29 15:49:59 2015 UTC,"Ash Kalra is backing Dhillon.  I was backing him before Ash did, my personal reasons is I think San Jose is extremely diverse now, with Indians representing a large enough portion of the population to have permanent representation on council.  I know Bob pretty well.  He's not perfect, but it's silly to think any elected official or candidate is ever ""perfect""."
SanJose,30nnif,robert_cortese,5,Sun Mar 29 17:44:55 2015 UTC,I wish we'd get beyond ethnicity. It becomes such an easy way for politicians to organize and target groups rather than engaging inviduals in detail.  We'd have to be less apathetic to get those kind of politicians...  Thanks for having this conversation!
SanJose,30nnif,captaintrips420,2,Sun Mar 29 18:35:50 2015 UTC,"Admittedly it's a big factor, but there are others.   Being religious sort of embeds some sense of morals.   It's not a silver bullet, but it does carry some weight for me. Labor hasn't really produced a steady stream of candidates with integrity lately.  Look at the whole Campos/Shirikawa mess.  I can't base my decisions purely on theirs anymore.   I know bob is a smart businessman with a lot of connections.  Speaking in purely ""how city processes work"" he's a PHD in that department, that with his connections will help move D4 forward."

SanJose,30mwmo,TristanwithaT,12,Sat Mar 28 21:12:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, all the time. No problem.   Technically, here is what Uber support says: """"uberX and uberXL drivers are able to drop-off riders at SJC Airport. However, they cannot pickup at this location due to airport restrictions. Only UberBlack and UberSUV cars with TCPs or commercial licenses can pickup though. We are sorry for any inconvenience and will update you if there's a change!""

SanJose,30mwmo,akaicewolf,9,Sat Mar 28 23:33:12 2015 UTC,"They're technically not allowed to, but they definitely do. I did this myself on Monday.

SanJose,30mwmo,Cheesejaguar,2,Sun Mar 29 19:21:51 2015 UTC,"Yup, I didn't realize they had not setup an agreement back when I used it for pickup in February. In both MIA and SJC where I was using it, they told me to sit in the front to act as a friend."
SanJose,30mwmo,dlerium,2,Sat Mar 28 23:17:11 2015 UTC,I just landed at SJC. UberX no longer picks up from SJC curbside like they used to do. There was some notification that popped up about taking a free shuttle somewhere off airport property and requesting UberX there; but I can't recall what it said specifically. Would be nice if this type of info was available on their website.  I tried going to one of the economy lots and the app still thought I was at the airport. Ended up renting a car for my trip.

SanJose,30gyeh,atomicllama1,5,Fri Mar 27 18:40:08 2015 UTC,"A good place to start might be the Wikipedia page for a neutral / unbiased description of our group.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Angels  The org has evolved over the years to a neighborhood watch group.   We basically use the same tactics SJPD used years ago to tackle the prostitution problem then.. We go stand next to the pimps and prostitutes in our uniforms.  Johns see us, and they move on.  Beyond that though, if we see anyone in danger of immediate physical harm we step in.  If we see a group mean mugging folks, we stand next to them.  We don't try to incite a fight, we just exercise our right to assemble and occupy public places (something we should all be able to do without threat or intimidation)  All in all it's a lot of fun.   You get to hike around for a few hours in DTSJ with a group of like minded people who want to make the community safer.  It's good exercise, (and in my case, being 42, married, gives me a legit excuse to be out on a Saturday night)  I probably shouldn't downplay the danger, but with such a large group, it's mitigated risk.  I have yet to feel like I was in harms way once since I've joined."

SanJose,30gyeh,Jamaican_In_NY,6,Tue Mar 31 13:07:13 2015 UTC,Sooo volunteer security guards that want to play army?
SanJose,30gyeh,xdisk,12,Fri Mar 27 14:32:07 2015 UTC,"Why you gotta be such a hater? Haven't you noticed the huge crime spike around here?  I applaud the effort, and I hope it makes an impact."
SanJose,30gyeh,xdisk,5,Fri Mar 27 14:46:18 2015 UTC,Are they trained?  Can they be held accountable for anything they do?  Do we know if any of them have a history of crime/drug use themselves?  Who is covering their legal asses?  If they get into it and have to 'do something about the crime spike' will their actions hold up in a court  of law?  Can they run more than 20 feet without having a heart attack?
SanJose,30gyeh,Jamaican_In_NY,9,Fri Mar 27 18:37:20 2015 UTC,"Are they trained?   Yes.  I'm on week 4 of training, and as a chapter leader I have to have a guard card.  It's $65 bucks of online training.  It's not rocket science.  Plus the organization has been doing this since 1979, we have procedures in place.   Can they be held accountable for anything they do?   See above   Do we know if any of them have a history of crime/drug use themselves?   Generally speaking, this is a volunteer orginization.  We give people a chance to prove themselves before passing judgement on their past.  We have former gang bangers, addicts, etc in the group who want to contribute to society now.   Who is covering their legal asses?   On the national level there is a full time legal team on the payroll   If they get into it and have to 'do something about the crime spike' will their actions hold up in a court of law?   Our procedures have been time and court tested since 1979.   Can they run more than 20 feet without having a heart attack?   I can.  I can run 2 miles easily.  A few years back I was running daily and 11 was my best.  A few years back  in a desk job, and admittedly I am getting a little rotund :)"
SanJose,30gyeh,xdisk,3,Fri Mar 27 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"Thats good to know.   I have never heard of your organization before. You provided a photo, but no context. All I saw was a bunch of guys dressed in a paramilitary style.  Good luck, and may your nights be boring."
SanJose,30gyeh,Jamaican_In_NY,8,Fri Mar 27 19:26:22 2015 UTC,They're doing a lot more than hating on a keyboard.
SanJose,30gyeh,xdisk,10,Fri Mar 27 18:42:36 2015 UTC,"Not hating. Skeptic.  I'm a licenced security guard. I know the SECOND a person sets hands on another, they are liable for assault.   Thats just ONE problem an organization like this would face.   If these guys arent sanctioned/trained they are going to open themselves up for a host of lawsuits for both individuals and the group."
SanJose,30gyeh,Jamaican_In_NY,5,Fri Mar 27 18:58:14 2015 UTC,"Skepticism and cynicism is totally cool--you just came off the bat as someone who wanted to pick apart an idea without offering any sort of suggestion.  The Guardian Angels were known to be one of the big reasons that violent crime started spiking down in the late 70's and early 80's, primarily in much denser urban areas like New York. Visual deterrence can play a big role in cutting down on random violent crimes.  The fact that San Jose now has a chapter is a sign to me that we're starting to have big urban problems, something that is relatively new for ""The safest big city in America.""   I would think today you could do a lot more with a cell phone than a billy club."
SanJose,30h0mw,kk_lmp,6,Fri Mar 27 08:25:53 2015 UTC,"[As far as leaving]  Everything is going to be bad. I went there for the Stadium Series and Light Rail was bad, there were lines everywhere and I heard it took people 2 hours to go home from the light rail. I ended up walking to Lafayette street and walking south to get picked up because there was almost nobody there. They also shut down Tasman about 1/2 mile both ways."
SanJose,30h0mw,hellabad,5,Fri Mar 27 08:35:39 2015 UTC,"I read the Stadium Series hockey had a lot more light rail travelers and less car traffic than the football games had, and they were unprepared. I believe more temporary light rail service has been set up.  What I've read is that the parking lots for football games now take about 45 minutes to clear (compared to 80 minutes back in September, compared to 90 minutes for Candlestick). Since I can walk to the stadium I have no first-hand experience with this."
SanJose,30h0mw,mdf356,2,Fri Mar 27 14:01:28 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'm planning on being dropped off and picked up to avoid as much traffic as possible. Is Great America parkway busy?  Also how was traffic getting to the stadium?
SanJose,30h0mw,LockNuts,4,Fri Mar 27 08:40:14 2015 UTC,"We parked at a friend's house for the Sharks game and the Mexico/Chile game. Just getting from our seat to the corner of Great America/Tasman took about 45 min.  Great America is horrible. You're not getting picked up there.  If you're going to be picked up, I would guess heading over the bridge over Lafayette is a better option and get picked up somewhere around Tasman/1st.  Frankly, the whole thing was so bad that I can't think of an event worth going back there for."
SanJose,30h0mw,hellabad,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:53:38 2015 UTC,"They had the light rail come by every 5-10 minutes and we went there about 3.5 hrs before the game. We saw over 15 trains pass us by with 4 cars and they were all packed, we ended up taking Uber. I can't say about driving there."
SanJose,30h0mw,flinxsl,1 point,Fri Mar 27 08:48:39 2015 UTC,"I had a different experience for the lightrail.  I have season tickets and went to all 8 regular season niners games.  It only ever took me 20 minutes max to get on a train, then the regular ride time ~40 min to diridon."
SanJose,30h0mw,keylime503,3,Fri Mar 27 18:14:45 2015 UTC,Use Lafayette Street. I use it every day to go to and from work and it's as if this street is invisible or something; whenever all the streets around it are solid packed with traffic Lafayette is completely empty. Same after 49ers games. It's awesome!
SanJose,30h0mw,drdeadringer,4,Fri Mar 27 17:45:26 2015 UTC,"I've heard ""it's bad"" from folks who live in the nearby area, from folks who work at the stadium, from VTA literail drivers, and from folks in general... even in the face of using the same breath to say ""they've learned how to improve themselves"" the story seems to stay about the same.  I'm still in the ""wait to go there until there's an event I really want to see comes around"" mode."
SanJose,30h0mw,jingy10,1 point,Fri Mar 27 14:09:59 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Lyft/Uber for Levi's to get there and back.  Also, try to walk somewhere where they can pick you up afterwards, don't call them from the stadium, they don't allow any cars near the stadium.  Walk over to Great America/Mission for faster pick up"
SanJose,30h0mw,atomicllama1,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"I said this before and Ill say it again. Leave on foot using the san thomas creek trail behind the stadium. Park somewhere along the creek trail there is a bunch of empty tech parking lots all along. Walk off that last beer, look at the water, ducks, and great america. Bonus points if you bring bikes. Just ride in from any large parking lot close to the stadium.  Really the traffic is only like a 2 mile radius of the stadium."

You are not the owner, you are of a lower caste.  You are here to serve them.  My former employers at 7 Bamboo treated me getting assaulted by a patron as something I did to lose face.  They stole my tips, tried to steal my equipment, and basically thought that I should give them everything because ""They were the owner!""    The beautiful thing about capitalism is this thing tends to work itself out.  In my case, I left, attendance tanked, and the owners ended up selling 7b for way less than they have ever asked.

SanJose,30da6x,sharkterritory,11,Thu Mar 26 19:58:35 2015 UTC,wasting their time protesting   The protest is meant to put pressure on the business to pay up on stolen wages and tips.

It's a two lane road for the most part, but windy and a bit narrow. The parking lot might be a bit hard to miss but the road eventually cuts into the hillside and the cliff ok your right goes away. About a mile or two later the parking lot is there.   Take your time if you want to go up. People like to speed up it and there are places to pull over should someone end up behind you.   Type in ""Sierra Vista Open Space preserve near Sierra road"" and it should pop up. The parking lot doesn't appear in Google Maps yet, it's fairly new.

The views of the bay and of Moffett Field are spectacular, as are  the wetlands and aquatic birds.   Indeed, most of the river trails (Guadalupe River, Coyote Creek, Los Gatos Creek, Stevens Creek, etc., etc.) are pretty good for contemplation, depending on the time of day/week.

If you answered ""NO"" then move to San Jose.  Also, San Jose is more diverse. It really is. San Francisco is just mostly Chinese, so people think its diverse. San Jose is a pretty even mix.  After college, I moved to San Francisco as I had always wanted to live there. Ended up getting a job in San Jose, moved down here, and don't regret it. Sure, SF is far more fun, but in San Jose, I don't feel trapped. I don't have to stress out about parking. And I'm closer to Santa Cruz, the Redwoods, etc.   And SJSU is a better school, I think.  SF is great. I fucking love the city. I just can't handle paying way too much money just for the ability to drive around in circles looking for parking."

SanJose,30ay2g,Puppysmasher,11,Wed Mar 25 23:51:40 2015 UTC,Well you can always find parking in SF if you can afford a $20/hour rate.

SanJose,30ay2g,mostri_di_gomma,12,Thu Mar 26 07:39:39 2015 UTC,"I got accepted to both SFSU and SJSU and I'm a bit on the line being that I don't have a lot of money to work with.   You're going to want to get your financial house in order as quickly as humanly possible for either of these options. Outsiders never really seem to really get just how expensive it can be to live in the Bay Area, whether it's San Francisco or the South Bay.   As it happens, I used to work in marketing and I've had a lot of colleagues go to both schools. SFSU has the better reputation between the two and has a larger marketing department, but SJSU is where I'd go if I was more concerned about getting work out of school. I've found it's a lot easier to network while in school here so that you can get to know people in the business before needing to enter the job market. There are more startups here, a hell of a lot more entrepreneurs, and I'd say more marketing jobs overall, particularly in digital marketing. If you're going to school just to learn, I laud that sentiment, but my suspicion is that your degree is being earned with a career in mind, making San Jose a better option.   The arts are vibrant in both areas, though perhaps slightly more so in San Francisco. Arts education is cheaper here, though, and can be better. San Jose has some of the best private teachers for music in California, and music and art classes can be taken at De Anza Community College, which is ranked as one of the best community colleges in the country (though I've heard that arts department there has shrunk a bit recently).   I can't dance. There's something wrong with me. I simply can't help you there."
SanJose,30ay2g,cvilla7,8,Thu Mar 26 00:19:44 2015 UTC,SF is only an hour away.  You can afford rent here (barely) and drive there to enjoy the things you love...

SanJose,30ay2g,nuvistor,5,Wed Mar 25 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"I trust SJ and the silicon valley more with Digital Marketing than SF. That alone was a big deal breaker for me going to SCU. Also I'm not sure what kind of multicultural you are but in my opinion with the Asian culture there, the SJ Asians are a bit more laid back than SF but it's not like I know all of the Asians from both schools"
SanJose,30ay2g,cardinal2007,3,Thu Mar 26 00:20:45 2015 UTC,"I live in San Jose and frankly,  I like it:   Hordes of homeless but you'll get that anywhere in the US, they tend to be decent down here, no pooping on sidewalks, little aggression.   It's a great place to bike! Trails, the whole valley is flat as hell, and a bike is great for exploring. I honestly think we have it all over New Orleans for architecture, food, etc.   SF and SJ are both great for foodies, but I think SJ is better for Japanese food and Pho.   Multi-racial no problemo, officially I'm white but in reality I'm brown, I think most take me for a light colored Hispanic, I pretty much go everywhere and do everything without hassle. There are more black people in SJ than official figures would lead you to believe, and they get a few hassles but I think less than in a lot of areas.   SF is only about an hour and a half away by train if you want to visit The City.   SJ has some upscale parts and some parts that are sketch, the sketch parts being cheaper to live in of course, I've lived in sketch parts and had zero hassles, the Eastside can be your friend."
SanJose,30ay2g,Jamaican_In_NY,5,Thu Mar 26 00:52:21 2015 UTC,"Based on what you said I would say these are the points that are good for SJSU over SFSU.   Believe it or not there is more to do in downtown SJ than in  Balboa Park in SF. (not that you need to live in Balboa Park, but comparing campus to campus SJSU is right downtown, SFSU's neighborhood is not near the action in SF, admittedly BART will get you out of Balboa Park to downtown SF quickly once you get to BART) You say you don't have a lot of money to work with, rents in SF are more expensive than Manhattan (not just NYC, Manhattan), https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-san-jose-rent-trends/, https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-san-francisco-rent-trends/. A 2bd apt in SJ will run you $2700/mo, downtown is actually about average, so your share of the rent on the average will be $1350/mo (ouch). A 2bd apt in SF will run you around $4000/mo, Balboa Park is lower than average, but still expect to pay a lot, your share of the rent will be $2000/mo (that may just kill you)). You have a car, parking in Balboa Park is harder than it is in Downtown SJ, almost all rentals in SJ have parking included, it is almost always the opposite in SF. I'm not sure if you want to be part of the arts community or just a consumer, (this is more hearsay since I've heard it from other people not experienced it myself, the arts community in SJ is a lot more approachable, everyone seems to want to help each other out, apparently not so in SF), if you just want to consume art SF probably has more stuff. If you're multi-racial and love being in diverse environment SJ is a better fit than SF, SJ is a lot more diverse than SF, SF being mostly white (non-hispanic white) and Asian, with most Asians there being Chinese. SJ has a large Hispanic community (mostly Mexican American), a large Vietnamese and Indian population, as well as Chinese.   That is most of the pluses for SJ for your particular case, I'm sure you can find stuff about SF if you search online. The two big things I like about SJ over SF are the weather being a lot nicer here, you're not going to have days in the high 50s and overcast in July in SJ, unlike SF, and it has a lot more outdoor activities to do, the other day I drove from downtown to Sierra Vista Open Space Preserve (23 minutes) and hiked up there for 3 hours, the views were impressive, SF is not surrounded by mountains, and preserved Bay marshes like SJ (admittedly some people prefer the unnatural developed bay front of SF though)."

At your age it will really be a great eye opening experience. Just so much more to do, see, and eat.  When you're ready to settle down start thinking about places like SJ. SF is a place that is amazing for awhile, but it'll start to feel crowded. The older people get the more they seem to like having more open space.  Visit both, then make your decision.

San Francisco is more expensive to live in than San Jose. Here's one comparison.  However, there really isn't that much to do in San Jose. If you like nightlife and diverse activities, SF will be better.  You can take a train up to San Francisco when you want to, though, for a lot less than it would cost to rent an apartment there. Note, however, that I am going off ""typical"" rents... I don't know the actual situation with regard to campus housing in either location.   San Jose will be quieter and less ""busy"" on a day-to-day basis. That could be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on your preferences.

SanJose,30ay2g,dontmatterdontcare,2,Thu Mar 26 22:44:29 2015 UTC,"One more thing to note is that SFSU is fairly far from downtown SF or any of the trendy cool parts, so you'd most likely be living in either the western/southwest portions of SF anyway... where things are going to be a little quieter, more residential, and more ""suburban"" anyway."
SanJose,30ay2g,zeruch,3,Thu Mar 26 21:03:36 2015 UTC,"All the costs of the city, but few of the benefits."
SanJose,30ay2g,zaggnutt,2,Thu Mar 26 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly. All the trouble of the city without even really ""living"" in the city. And if you're going to bother taking the MUNI/bus to other parts of the city with more nightlife, you might as well live in the South Bay and Caltrain/BART it."
SanJose,30ay2g,zaggnutt,2,Thu Mar 26 21:10:22 2015 UTC,"I just graduated from SFSU in December, and housing is expensive. I was paying $1500 to live in UPN in a 1 bedroom, 2 parking spots, access to washer/dryer, and appliances, a view of the ocean, and across the street from Stonestown. That was considered fair price for SF but you can find similar things in downtown San Jose for a similar price, but everything is much closer. If you don't have a car in SF, riding the Muni every where can get old, but if you dont have a car in DT SJ, it wont matter becuase youre alreayd there.   One other big thing I disliked about SFSU was you didnt get cheaper/free public transportation. At SJSU you get a VTA pass.  As far as which school is better, it depends on your major. SFSU has a better creative arts program, as well as some of the ethnic studies programs. SJSU has a much better nursing, criminal justice, and engineer program."
SanJose,30ay2g,RKA2K15,2,Thu Mar 26 23:36:31 2015 UTC,Congrats fellow gator. That being said I commuted to SFSU for a time from San José and will agree that parking situation/MUNI wasn't awesome. You hit the nail on the head in regards to what programs each school is known for. Good luck to the OP.
SanJose,30ay2g,allthegoinbetweens,2,Fri Mar 27 10:33:05 2015 UTC,"Given your academic background I feel SF will give you more chances at digital marketing than SJ will.  I digress, if you're from LA you'll feel more adjusted towards SJ. San Jose is a lot cleaner than SF and also few similarities are shared with LA and I can tell you it's similar to Pasadena and Irvine. Using your car is a lot easier than in SF here in SJ.  You're also closer to the tech companies of the South Bay like Google, Workday, Cisco, Facebook, LinkedIn, meanwhile SF has like Twitter and Salesforce and others.  SJ is more chill where you can drive around much more freely and visit other small towns nearby. In San Jose people also consider the neighboring towns like Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Milpitas and others a part of the area just because of how close they are. SF is like a bubble where they have everything inside of it."
SanJose,30ay2g,tasstimes,2,Fri Mar 27 00:10:29 2015 UTC,"SJ is notably cheaper, and has ready access to CalTrain to get to SF if desired (I chose SJ since I work in Cupertino and actually like the small but active city center in downtown) as well as other places along the peninsula.  Crime is lower, rent is cheaper, but still enough to stave off boredom if you aren't a completely unhinged hedonist."

College should be - in part - about having fun.   San Jose is better for when you setting down or if life circumstances lead you here. It's not bad and SF is overrated, but for college-age fun my view is you should go to SF.  I don't know the comparison moneywise."

The Special Ops team used an explosive charge to breach by blowing an opening from an adjacent apartment common wall. Prior to that they had shut off utilities and made calls to the suspect which went to voice mail. After the dust settled the team sent in a robot which at one point got a wheel stuck. I shut off the feed just after the robot operator was told to use the claw to remove a Gas can. The explosive entry would have over pressurized the room and would disorient the suspect. They also had the armored vehicle sound off it's very loud siren during the explosion. The SCPD took their time to keep everyone safe, good job guys."

SanJose,307rix,DerelictDiety,17,Wed Mar 25 06:40:31 2015 UTC,Nail hit squarely on head. We defunded mental health in the 80s and it has been a downward slide since. I swear prisons should be reserved for rapists and murderers and we should have fully funded mental facilities. It's a crime against humanity to let some people roam the streets.

I also wouldn't mind seeing the extreme white collar criminals and massive drug runners put in prison.

SanJose,307rix,DerelictDiety,8,Wed Mar 25 06:48:12 2015 UTC,"From what I've gathered (my friend's husband is on the scene) many LEOs feel this way. LEOs seem to see the bureaucracy, politics, and profiteering that goes into the drug war and hate that it takes resources (cells, time, etc.) away from violent crime. With that said, a drug crime that accompanies violent crime is still violent crime. Drug crimes that are not harmful to others should be left alone to friends and family. If those aren't there to help then, well shit, the state needs to divert resources from incarceration to treatment, education, and job training. We all know that drug users who end up in the system are more likely to become violent after they leave the jail/prison system. It is literally con college."

I know it is difficult to have something for every situation, especially when you are expecting a person in distress. This will make it much harder for PD to approach these situations.

SanJose,30a2l9,DJBobbyC,8,Wed Mar 25 18:24:01 2015 UTC,"I live downtown and I love it. San Pedro Square is a great place to check out. That's my favorite spot to go with friends for drinks. Downtown is mostly night clubs (not my cup of tea) but there are some great places to get a beer. ISO is one of the best.  You'll have a rental car, I'm sure, so drive out to Santa Cruz and check it out. Stop at Henry Cowell State Park on the way and marvel at the amazing redwoods. Maybe even take a ride on the train. In Santa Cruz, go grab a beer or two at Seabright brewery, and then walk down the train tracks to the Boardwalk. WALK ACROSS THE TRAIN BRIDGE, not the path next to it. Don't be a pussy. Ride the Giant Dipper. Its fucking amazing.  Go get some tacos from a taco truck. You can generally find taco trucks on the East side. Drive down Story Road and you'll see one eventually. Or, if you're here on the weekends, stop by the 5 Spot Chivas Grill for some amazing tacos; they barbeque them in the parking lot on the weekends. Mexico Bakery on Story Road also has some AMAZING Mexican sandwiches (tortas) and tons of baked goods.  Check out Little Saigon on Story Road before the 101. San Jose has the highest population of Vietnamese of any city outside of Vietnam. Thus, we probably also have the best Vietnamese food in the world outside of Vietnam. Try Pho 90 for some great pho, or go to Bun Bo Hue An Nam for some amazing beef noodle soup (much better than pho, in my opinion, although if you're not adventurous, stick to pho.)  Of course, you have to visit San Francisco. San Jose is an OK city, but San Francisco is one of the best in the world. AND its only a 40min to an hour drive from San Jose. DRIVE ON THE 280, NOT THE 101. Your GPS will tell you to take the 101. IGNORE IT. Take the 280. If you aren't short on time, get off on highway 35 and take that into the city. It'll take you along the beach, and you might even get to see some hang gliders. In San Francisco, check out Dolores Park, Golden Gate Park, Haight Street, Lands End, China Town. DON'T EAT CHINESE FOOD IN CHINA TOWN. It sucks. Its overpriced and made for tourists. Instead, eat Chinese food in the Richmond district, around Clement and 8th (Spices 1 and Spices 2 are my favorites, but any will do.)  If you want to drive around some cool areas, check out downtown Los Gatos, downtown Saratoga, downtown Campbell. Also, drive out East to highway 130 and drive along it for however long you want. It has some absolutely AMAZING views of San Jose and really gives you a good idea of how close to farmland the Bay Area is. Highway 9 is also a nice drive, although its twisty as hell.   If you want to go walk around a park, Vasona is a wonderful spot.  If you want to hike, Santa Teresa is a good one, as is Alum Rock Park. Honestly, there are a million places to hike, and they are all wonderful."

SJ is pretty bike-friendly, so if you are near the downtown core you'll have easy access to lot of the best parts of the city - San Pedro Square Market, SOFA, SAP Center, the Alameda, Japantown, etc. A cursory glance at the current listings shows the cheapest 1 bedroom (600 sq. feet) available for $1,200 at 12th and Santa Clara."

Our rent, for a 2 bedroom 2 1/2 bathroom townhouse with a one car garage is only $2480 a month. Although... I expect our rent to go up (they raised our rent $400 last summer).   Downtown is one of the cheaper areas, as its still up and coming, and is relatively safe. Don't be surprised to see a ton of homeless, it just comes with the territory.   Edit: Oh, also... San Jose is one of the safer big cities. Most of the crime is gang related, so if you aren't Mexican, you don't really have to worry about getting caught up in it. If you are Mexican (or look Mexican) you might want to avoid wearing colors (red, blue) in certain areas."

I grew up in that area and there were quite a few gang areas. There's one neighborhood down by Rosemary elementary that has a lot of surrenos (or used to.)  Still, gangs In San Jose are relatively minor, but the majority of serious crime (murders, assaults) are gang related."

Movie nights, live bands, art walk in the arts district, tons of interesting restaurants and bars all within walking or biking distance. I've also heard Japantown is a nice area to live. If you want to go cheaper, you'll need to head into south San Jose down to Morgan Hill or out to the East Bay - Fremont and Milpitas. Steer clear of east San Jose if you can. Not very safe.

That's where it originated but a lot of graffiti artists/taggers that are not affiliated use them as well..  This is very obviously not gang graffiti.  Gang graffiti is used to mark territory. A gang member would not write their name ""real"" 20 times on the same mail box. Gang graffiti also usually has more focus on the gang they are representing along with the norteno/sureno.  The person that wrote ""Daser "" ( which is the one on the side of the box with the 4 dots) is not the same person as real. They more than likely don't even know each other, they just both used a black marker.   The ""crossed out"" s is probably just Real's attempt at adding some flair to the letters.

SanJose,303h6f,robert_cortese,4,Tue Mar 24 15:27:35 2015 UTC,Why is raising the price of water a bad thing?  Isn't that the most effective way to curb demand in a historic drought?
SanJose,303h6f,Alexplanation,6,Tue Mar 24 17:15:43 2015 UTC,"God dammit /r/sanjose.. Learn what downvotes are for.  Maybe you don't agree with this guys comment, but it's a good segway into other discussions.  /u/Alexplanation   San Jose citizens are caught in between policies.  Last year I had to pay $800 in code enforcement fines for ""Blight"" because I let my lawn go to dirt.  My neighbors constantly complained to me, asking me to ""Please put a lawn in""  Raising prices won't affect this because people are scared of getting fined, so they'll keep watering to avoid it.  What we need is some sort of agreement between water / city that dirt front yards are OK."
SanJose,303h6f,robert_cortese,2,Tue Mar 24 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"That sucks that your front lawn got fined.  I know some municipalities are subsidizing putting in water efficient yards, be they turf or otherwise, which seems quite reasonable.  It seems like a comprehensive plan would be for the best.  Even so, it seems like raising prices for water is absolutely reasonable given the circumstances.  Especially if those funds are then used to do things like water reclamation.  Anyway, SPUR has a nice article about this, and a tiered system sounds really appropriate:  http://www.spur.org/blog/2014-04-22/bringing-water-consumption-down-drought-heats"
SanJose,303h6f,Alexplanation,2,Tue Mar 24 18:58:40 2015 UTC,"Alexplanation, I think this an excellent question and leads to one that should be asked at the hearing: will any of this increase in prices go toward conservation efforts? (other than, you know, making water more expensive for the sake of making water more expensive--keep in mind that SJ Water is a for-profit company)  Also keep in mind that SJ Water increases would be in addition to any rate increases that the the Santa Clara Valley Water District (different body) imposes.

So seemingly either the area has a cultural problem and people are unwilling to be open with pollsters , or it is so uncomfortable LGBT people out of the area or are unwilling to move here in the first place. Either way it really shows the area needs to work on that. Maybe tech has issues attracting LGBT people in general, and with the valley's workforce being largely tech workers (at least 20%) the demographics reflect that?

Also, the area has enough density of places to eat near work.   Sunnyvale, well, not so much. It's a long way, and the straighter paths from San Jose to Sunnyvale can be a bit... hairy... to ride on. Also, Sunnyvale is a sprawly suburb... So distances between places within the city tend to be larger.   But if you're always going to go from Milpitas to Sunnyvale and back, the Bay Trail is really extremely pleasant.   As someone else said, Google Maps is your friend. It does a very good job of finding safe and reasonable bike routes around the South Bay. Searching for your actual biking conditions would be better than relying on general advice.  One thing: grocery stores tend to be rather spread out around here... so shopping might be a little bit of a challenge... and ""neighborhood"" stores tend to be liquor stores and 7-11s rather than anything really useful (though there are a lot of nice asian markets around... and a bunch of farmer's markets too)."

And yes, I know what you mean and why you're saying the things you're saying about log scales, I do have a grad degree in engineering after all, but I chose to ignore talking about precision and absolutes because those numbers are irrelevant to a person experiencing an earthquake in a moment. All they would know is intensity of the sensation, duration, and impact. Which is why the earthquake scales are not reported in the news as GJoules, instead, they are reported on an imperfect scale that semi-correlate to energy.  Imagine how ridiculous would someone be if they say "" I was sitting in bed this morning and there was a 10 GJ earthquake."" First of all, that's totally irrelevant because if that 10GJ earthquake happened in Japan, and you're here, it doesn't even matter. Translating that 10GJ quake to a 4 on the magnitude scale is meaning less unless you have a frame of reference.   If you were on top of it, you'd feel it as a 4, and your room shakes a bit. but if you're 5 miles out, you'd feel it as a 3, and 25 miles out you'd feel it as a 2 if anything at all.

Aren't those ads paid for by a PAC and not by the candidate directly (just like TV ads)? In this case it was the Chamber of Commerce.   Similar to how America's big companies shove their junk at the uninformed.   Companies of all shapes and sizes use targeted advertising (online/mobile). It's an easy and cheap way (relative to other media) to get the word out about their product/service. Ads are meant to increase awareness and preference. It's ultimately up to the end-customer to decide whether the product fits their needs.

I live in a great location near SJSU in a old but nice (yay hardwood floors) 1br for $1350 (was $1250 when I moved in).  But my place is kind of a unicorn.  During my 20 day search, I toured more than 10 places that were all either significantly worse, significantly more expensive, or both.  You should be prepared to review and sign a lease the same day; when I saw that this place was both cheap and good, I asked the landlord (also great) to wait for 2 minutes while I wrote him a check, and we signed the lease the next day.  Now as for what's available you have some categories   One room in a house will run you $700 to $1000; just make sure you meet all the people living there before you decide to move in.  If the place has locks on bedroom doors w/ individual keys, it's probably not a welcoming place to live. Studio in a house that's been converted into apartments - $700 to $1000, but THEY ALL SUCK, so if you see something like this, I recommend you just walk away. Studio in a real apartment building - usually way overpriced $1000 to $2000 depending on the building. 1br apartment $1400 to $2800 depending on building and location 2br apartments can be found for under $3000 if you get lucky   Good luck!"

SanJose,2zq3qm,Masterrocks,8,Sat Mar 21 19:32:04 2015 UTC,"SAN JOSE -- Police are investigating a body found in a swimming pool at Piedmont Hills High School in San Jose. Officials say the body was discovered by a PE class around 8 a.m.   Students were sent home after the discovery was made, according to school officials.  ""It happened at approximately 8 a.m. this morning during second period, when the students and teacher were out removing the covers from the pool,"" Superintendent Chris Funk said.  The decedent is believed to be an adult male. They don't think he was a student but the coroner has not yet identified the body, according to Funk.  The pool is in a locked enclosure with a 15-foot fence topped by barbed wire. There's also a burglary alarm, which did not go off, according to Funk.  ""All the doors were locked and the alarms didn't go off,"" Funk said. ""That person must have gotten into the pool by climbing over the fence.""  There are no signs of a break-in. The last time the pool was used was Thursday night for a swim class; it was then locked up and secured.   Due to the body's discovery, school officials released the students at 11 a.m.  ""It's a tragic situation, and we didn't feel it was conducive to learning,"" Funk said.  Classes will resume on Monday, and the campus also plans to go back to normal weekend activities on Saturday, Funk said.  The school has a full time social worker on staff, and they called in additional staff to provide counseling services for the students and personnel affected by this morning's tragedy.  Funk said it was unclear at this time what measures would be needed to clean the pool after the body's removal, but that the district would be under advisement as to the proper process of making the pool safe to use again.  The body was found in the deep end of the pool, which is 13 feet."

I've never been carded there and I think I've even seen kids in there so  you can come just to listen to the music if you want (I think).   The Poor House Bistro has blues music most nights. It's a restaurant, so you don't have to worry about not being 21 there.   The San Jose Museum of Art is only $8 (might be cheaper for students), but it's pretty small, so that'll only kill an hour or 2."

It costs about $30 for an all day pass and  an equipment rental.  If you go with someone you know you are going to have to alternate turns climbing so you're both going to have to take a belay class, but it only takes 30 minutes to learn and is really easy. You can usually get one of the staff the belay for you though.  Overall, it's great exercise and the people that work there and go to the gym are really chill and friendly."

Jo Jo himself is great with short hair transitions, but if he doesn't have time, every other stylist in that place is amazing.  Jo Jo took me from longer (mid shoulder) to shorter and gave me a very balanced, iconic look and he took his time to ensure it framed my face, fell properly, and fit my lifestyle.  The prices are on par with other mid to high end salons.  There is a discount for recommendations, so if you're thinking Jo Jo, PM me and I'll give you my name so you'll get a few bucks off the first cut."

This includes criminal backgrounds, failure to pay taxes, or being located in areas they shouldn't be.  Fiber... Well, Sr. Systems administrator here :)  IIRC to run any kind of cable underground costs about $20k per house, so multiply that times our housing inventory and you come up with a number of around $4bn to properly wire up every house in the city.

SanJose,2zhy91,DogNozzle,5,Wed Mar 18 19:40:05 2015 UTC,I'm laughing at the idea of sending someone from out of town to Dry Creek Grill.  It's just such a strange place.
SanJose,2zhy91,No_Nrg,4,Wed Mar 18 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"I'm curious why you think it is strange? I've not been yet because it seems a little over priced. I also don't eat steal out often because every time I grill people tell me it's better than steaks they've spent 50-100 dollars on. So yeah, come to my place and bring some bombers I guess...haha Do you like The Table?"
SanJose,2zhy91,DogNozzle,8,Wed Mar 18 22:00:48 2015 UTC,"The food isn't bad and honestly it's not a bad suggestion but I say ""strange"" because of the juxtaposition of the upscale-loungey ambiance and the anonymous suburban shopping center location.  It's like a little piece of Los Gatos broke off and floated into the middle of San Jose.  I do like the Table."
SanJose,2zhy91,adhding_nerd,2,Wed Mar 18 22:38:13 2015 UTC,"Firehouse has steaks? I've been there a number of times, I thought it was just a hole in the wall bar. Then again I've only been there on Friday and Saturday nights. Think I'll head there for dinner right now."
SanJose,2zhy91,hacksoncode,2,Thu Mar 19 00:42:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the food's pretty darn good there. I'd definitely say it qualifies for the wildly overused ""gastropub"" designation."

SanJose,2zhy91,opentoinput,12,Thu Mar 19 03:13:17 2015 UTC,Stay away from Gordon Biersch.  We were served food with ice crystals still on it.  Frozen tv dinner food at best.
SanJose,2zhy91,netllama,4,Wed Mar 18 19:38:56 2015 UTC,The food there has always been mediocre.

They hired one of RB's brewers a few months ago and he makes really good beer.   If they let him have more control, the would be fantastic."
SanJose,2zhy91,opentoinput,4,Wed Mar 18 21:03:13 2015 UTC,GB food is horrible and their service is worse.  Won't go back.  Never been to Rock Bottom.  Is that in the Pruneyard?
SanJose,2zhy91,SoMuchMoreEagle,3,Wed Mar 18 21:41:55 2015 UTC,"Yes.  The food and beer there are far superior to GB, even though they are both owned by the same company."
SanJose,2zhy91,opentoinput,2,Wed Mar 18 21:56:40 2015 UTC,They are both owned by the same company?  Wow.
SanJose,2zhy91,SoMuchMoreEagle,2,Wed Mar 18 22:54:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Craftworks bought RB a few years ago.   They own a few other restaurant chains, several of which are brewpubs, as well."

SanJose,2zhy91,NoseDragon,3,Wed Mar 18 19:39:14 2015 UTC,ISO is fantastic for beer. Probably the best beer place in San Jose.

I just don't get why I would pay someone to cook my own food.   I can go to the store myself and do that at home.   I go out so I don't have to cook.

SanJose,2zibnz,DarknessRain,3,Wed Mar 18 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"My guess is it's like other seasonal food promotions restaurants do where they'll keep offering them until they run out of ingredients. It's like the sad part of the year where you have to go to three Starbuckses to find one that still has pumpkin spice. It doesn't make sense for them to waste storage space on leftovers, especially when customers will happily buy them and the ingredients may be expired a year later."

The council refused to reappoint her predecessor, Barbara Attard, who openly clashed with the police chief, chafed at the limits of her oversight powers under the city charter and sought to enhance them. That, ironically, ended up being one of Cordell's core objectives for the job.   That didn't seem so long ago. I remember that hoo-ha over Barbara Attard.  I can't help but wonder if there's any reason behind Cordell's stepping down and not trying to keep going as the IPA.  Lastly...wonder who the next replacement will be and how well it'll work.

SanJose,2zg1rh,mykol_reddit,-1,Wed Mar 18 17:29:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of people who do it are doing it as a second income and thus taking money out of the pockets of people who drive for a living.   The few times I've used them they've never met their expected arrival time, causing me to miss trains.   The insurance requirement for the drivers is absurdly low for bodily injury.   To sum it up, it's like needing some home repairs done, so you swing by home depot and pickup a couple Mexicans, then have them install your new bathtub. Can they do it? Yes. Is it going to be quality work? Maybe. Do I have any kind of insurances about the quality of the work? Fuck no."
SanJose,2zg1rh,NoseDragon,2,Wed Mar 18 17:41:01 2015 UTC,"You're totally wrong. But that's ok.  Comparing getting a ride to having a new bathtub installed is pretty fucking ridiculous. I can drive and use GPS just as well as any taxi driver can. A taxi driver doesn't have some unique skill, they just have a taxi.  I don't personally use Uber or Lyft, but my friends take them in SF all the time. They are fantastic and half the price of a taxi. If taxis don't want to lose money, then they need competitive prices."
SanJose,2zg1rh,mykol_reddit,0,Wed Mar 18 18:30:04 2015 UTC,"If taxis don't want to lose money, then they need competitive prices.   Their prices are VERY competitive for the service they offer. They aren't: however, competitive with lesser services that serve the same function.   I'm sure you could use a GPS, my statement isn't about the difficulty of the job, its the assurances of the person/company doing the work. In order to be an uber driver, you need to provide proof of insurance...state minimum. So if they do get you into an accident, and your bodily harm is over 10k, then enjoy your medical bill, or hope the driver is worth money and is just doing the job for fun."
SanJose,2zg1rh,NoseDragon,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:42:43 2015 UTC,"Just doing the job for fun?  I take it you've never met an uber/lyft driver before. It is a full time job for a lot of people.

The statement I made is that most of them are not insured to cover your injuries for more than $10,000 if you're hurt in their vehicle. If they are not rich, so you can suit for damages, then you're going to be paying your medical bills.    Taxis do not have competitive prices.    I specifically said unless compared to a lesser quality service. Example, car insurance is less expensive if you don't have as much financial coverage. Uber may be 1/2 the cost of a taxi, but if you're in an accident, you have zero guarantee that your medical needs will be paid for. Taxi companies are licensed and regulated specifically for this sort of thing."
SanJose,2zg1rh,NoseDragon,0,Wed Mar 18 19:25:18 2015 UTC,"Ok. So the premium you pay for is for the slight, tiny, minuscule chance that you are injured in a car accident?

Yes, I pay the extra $3 for a taxi ride vs uber, just like I pay the extra $7/mo for car insurance for my vehicle in order to cover bodily harm. I also pay for health insurance on the off chance I'm injured. If you ever have a friend get buried in tens of thousands of debt for medical services caused by a car accident you'll see the value."

SanJose,2zg1rh,keylime503,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:41:56 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying but my thoughts regarding the matter are this: This isn't the Soviet Union. If taxis want to compete with Uber/Lyft, then they need to either lower their prices to compete or raise their quality of service provided in order to justify the higher costs. Just because Uber/Lyft are cheaper doesn't mean the service you are getting is of lesser value, just like the guys at Home Depot can probably do as good of a job installing your bathtub as a 'professional' (which I would consider to be a guy outside Home Depot so this is pointless)."

SanJose,2zbooa,aydiosmio,-7,Tue Mar 17 10:15:57 2015 UTC,"11:49 pm Wednesday Officers responded to a call where someone was shot.  8:51 pm Wednesday brandishing a gun  8:50 pm Wednesday brandishing a gun  5:38 pm Wednesday brandishing a gun  8:51 pm Tuesday brandishing a gun  12:42 am Tuesday a driver was carjacked after two people approached him with a gun  10:08 pm Wednesday a passenger exited the vehicle and approached him, pointed a gun at him   This is absurd. The media hype about gun homicides falling vastly understates the issues with gun crime we deal with in the US. So many carjackings and robberies at gunpoint. Trauma surgeons are getting better at treating gunshot victims, which is also contributing to falling gun deaths."
SanJose,2zbooa,MultiKdizzle,5,Tue Mar 17 11:18:54 2015 UTC,Or  we have better access to information due to technology. Crime will rise though when you don't have secure borders and have top down corruption.
SanJose,2zbooa,SlumberMachine,3,Tue Mar 17 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"You know what would help? If it was easier for law-abiding citizens to open carry or conceal carry firearms in CA. If carjackers actually thought there was a reasonable chance someone would blow them away with a .45, they probably wouldn't try to steal cars as often."
SanJose,2zbooa,OleDeadwoodDick,-3,Wed Mar 18 02:20:16 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't help in the slightest, it would only cause increased aggression when people should be retreating from a situation.  Right to carry laws resulted in an 8% increase in aggravated assaults  in 8 states that adopted them between 1979 and 2010.  CCW holders are also responsible for at least 722 documented deaths since May 2007, including 28 mass shootings. Shall issue is simply a luxury for gun owners who want to carry, not a tool to reduce crime. The hundred+ Americans who are shot every day can attest to the fact that an armed society is not a polite one."
SanJose,2zbooa,MultiKdizzle,5,Wed Mar 18 02:35:22 2015 UTC,Guy with the stick has mental issues. Also who the hell jacks a SSR on Stevens Creek in the middle of the day?
SanJose,2zbooa,monsieurlee,4,Tue Mar 17 07:21:05 2015 UTC,You'd be surprised. One of my coworkers had two cars full of people chasing him in broad daylight in South San Jose for his car. They were smiling at him and asking him what he had under his hood. Some people just don't give a shit.
SanJose,2zbooa,JayHTea,0,Tue Mar 17 08:14:25 2015 UTC,"...If he is in his own car, just tell him not to worry. What are they gonna do, run him off the road? Just fucking take off if they get out of their car."
SanJose,2zbooa,Z0di,4,Tue Mar 17 18:24:28 2015 UTC,"They tried to box him in by having one car in front blocking him and the other behind leaving no space for him to turn (think like very tight parallel parking. Luckily for him, his car is modified and was able to get out because he had a fuckton of angle to his wheels.   The problem with taking off is that they'll just chase you again. He had to run red lights to get away from them and called up his friends to meet him at a gas station."

SanJose,2zbooa,dirtyshits,6,Tue Mar 17 07:21:12 2015 UTC,I can't even imagine another side of the story that would justify this guy's reaction.
SanJose,2zbooa,NoseDragon,0,Tue Mar 17 16:36:57 2015 UTC,"Im not trying to justify this guys reaction because it was most likely unnecessary. With that being said, we don't actually know what happened. The cameraman could be in the wrong but all we see is someone losing their temper. We tend to overreact just like that guy without knowing the whole story. The point is not to be that guy."
SanJose,2zbooa,dirtyshits,5,Tue Mar 17 16:43:36 2015 UTC,"It obviously wasn't a car jacking, though, and coming out of your car with a weapon is pretty idiotic.  I've had plenty of people do asshole things to me while driving. I would never ever ever in a million years step out of my car, especially not with a weapon, and I'm a big dude.   If someone's a dick to you on the road, shake your head at them and keep on going. Don't stop in the middle of the road and make a scene.  No matter who was in the wrong before the camera starts rolling, none of that matters the second dude gets out of the car brandishing a weapon."
SanJose,2zbooa,NoseDragon,2,Tue Mar 17 16:46:38 2015 UTC,"Your right it probably wasn't a car jacking.   No matter who was in the wrong before the camera starts rolling, none of that matters the second dude gets out of the car brandishing a weapon.   But you still don't know what happened prior to the camera rolling and what happened could justify this guys response(probably not but we can't be sure). I was just giving general advice to not come to conclusions based on half a story."

SanJose,2zbooa,upsidedownfunnel,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:44:59 2015 UTC,Common sense is not getting out of your car to engage the person that you have convinced yourself wants to rob and/or harm you. He lost any ability to show common sense pretty early on.   This is a case of too much time spent looking in your mirror and letting your ego do the thinking.

I'm chapter leader, and I really haven't made any bylaws for our chapter yet, but we won't be going after stoners.  The state/city have a very different set of laws, and generally it's considered ""legal"" here.  Funny you mention that, the other night in Modesto we came across a bunch of it on a table.  I ended up just handing it to a cop at the end of the night who just laughed at me and said, ""heh it's almost legal""  Really I think we just want to keep an eye on things.  We're going to get to know who's who on the streets.  If there's some folks that are harassing others we'll go stand by them until they get the hint to move on."

But I know, I'll forget, and when the time comes I will just be, ""I want this hair gone now To supercuts!"" And then regret my decision like I always do.    So I saved this post, in hopes... one day I will look back, at the same time I need a haircut, and I will get one of these glorious haircuts.    Thank you for this detailed description.

SanJose,2z96bs,Werv,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"not ranked in any particular way, because these shops do different things very well. For those of you that want more specifics:  My best fades came from: Herman's, Crewners, and Frank  The best hot shave/additional comp services: Crewners, Frank, and Krown  That neighborhood awesome barbershop where everyone feels like family and the vibe is so chill and awesome: Mt Pleasant and Krown  Most consistent (from my experience): Herman's"
SanJose,2z96bs,Rufio88,5,Mon Mar 16 18:23:15 2015 UTC,Crewners is garbage.... waited 2 weeks for my appointment. Day before my appointment get an email saying their barber quit so had to reschedule again. Once I finally got helped the barber didn't do shit to my hair and forgot to trim my beard. Also when his other customer came in all friendly talk went out the door. He started rushing and forgot to cut my left side... I received an email asking me to rate them on there website. So I gave an honest rating of 2 out of 5 stars. They deleted my rating after 1 day.... DO NOT GO TO CREWNERS.
SanJose,2z96bs,RickyPls,3,Mon Mar 16 20:29:30 2015 UTC,"sorry to hear of your bad experience man, I had a great time with Andre cutting my hair and giving me a great shave afterwards. I probably wouldn't make Crewners a top place for me personally because there's other great Downtown barbers I've already made great friendships with like Frank at his shop and Sal/Ty at Herman's."
SanJose,2z96bs,Rufio88,3,Mon Mar 16 22:14:04 2015 UTC,"Andre is the barber who left, I believe."
SanJose,2z96bs,GoxyFrandma,2,Tue Mar 17 00:22:05 2015 UTC,"Yes he is the one who left. I was suppose to get my hair by him but I got the new guy.

SanJose,2z96bs,jodv,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:17:22 2015 UTC,That's what I've heard. I followed Andre to his new location at Bedlam. He does a great job.
SanJose,2z96bs,Rufio88,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:27:42 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I've had the exact opposite experience.  I've been going to Dan for probably about a year now.

I would be willing to give it another try and change my opinion on the place but I am certainly not going to pay 40$ for it. If the owner is willing to give me another experience on the house then I might reconsider.
SanJose,2z96bs,pizzadick,3,Tue Mar 17 16:17:23 2015 UTC,"OP, try Mr. Ts Barber Shop in Santa Clara as an honorable mention. Those barbers are incredibly talented, and the price is $15-20.

His son Vincent I wouldn't really recommend he's good if your like myself and want a decent cut, but don't want to be sitting there an hour for it.  His attention to detail is lacking.   Mr T's Scott/Homestead- Andy and Jimmy (Both Mr T's sons) use to work at this location both of them are good.  Mr T's Benton and Kiely- Jimmy's new shop, haven't been to it I have just seen it.  I'm sure it's a nice shop because I found Jimmy to be the most talented.   The two I have been to haven't been the most appealing shops but they give a pretty decent cut. Cash Only."

Jack, the owner tends to occasionally dip out early, so try to make an appointment rather than walk in if you can. Shop is a bit worn down, but he's got loads of experience. Good place to go to for a nice clean cut, all for 12 bucks. I pay 15 though cuz he does a good job, and usually gives me a quick shave around the sideburns (legit with a straight razor) at no extra. The man may not need a tip, but I'll be damned if he doesn't get one every time.  Warning: CASH ONLY. Also being an old building in SJ, I've seen a roach there once. Big fucker, but just one of em."

SanJose,2za6ke,aydiosmio,4,Tue Mar 17 22:37:37 2015 UTC,"Right, that's what they get in an asylum. Consistent medical treatment with a warm and safe place to sleep. Some inmates stay permanently because they can't function on their own, but some do eventually make it out to live on their own because of consistent treatment. Santa Clara used to have a huge asylum for the Mentally ill, Agnews Insane Asylum, but it's programs for the mentally ill were ended in the 70s. Not sure what goes on their now, but many of the inmates were simply released out into the streets, many of them still on our streets today."

SanJose,2z2mht,robert_cortese,7,Sun Mar 15 17:07:35 2015 UTC,"A lot of ""why's""  In what we perceived to be an effort by local politicians to push the agenda's of homebuilders, San Jose Farmers were no longer allowed to pump water out of the local creeks.  We used to pump from the creek across from Evergreen College (I lived on that orchard from the time I was born until I was 10, then again when I was 19-20)  The other reason is family squabbles over money/property after my grandfather died and a ton of cronyism by the local fruit buyers.  My grandmother inherited 1/4 of that 100 acres of Cherries, and the 7 or so across the San Felipe of prune orchard.   The first year she inherited it (after 5 years of fighting her in laws in court) she had my Uncle Jerry try to bring in the fruit. We fenced off our sections, but someone kept knocking down our fences and generally vandalizing property.  When we did get the fruit in, no buyers would buy from us.  Old boys club.  Our 7 acres of prunes was accused of having ""Bole Weavil Beatle"" or some nonsense, so we had to cut all our prune trees down.  With all that pressure to fail at farming from in-laws, government, she sought out buyers just to get out from underneath it.  Ours was the first 1/4 of the orchard developed into houses, with the prune ranch developing into a retirement facility.  Edit Just have to add to this... It used to be amazing to walk through that Orchard from the 70's to the 90's.  Petals covering the ground like snow, sun shining on your face.

Both are an intro to basic automotive principles, meant for the person with zero automotive experience. The only problem I have with those classes is that, in the beginning days, they just throw the students into running condition tests on engines, without necessarily telling them why they're doing those tests. The reasons are explained later on, but you're kind of left in the dark in the beginning. As far as building a solid foundation toward understanding modern automotive engines, these are good classes to take.""  He did mention that the day classes are very difficult to get into, as they're very popular; night classes might be your better bet.  What is your goal in taking this course?"
SanJose,2z27h9,Vrikshasana,3,Sat Mar 14 22:27:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you (and him) for the detailed response.  Yeah, there's only two courses, the day one is 3 spots away from being full. My registration date is on Monday, so its likely going to get  full by then. The one I'm looking at is the evening course, meets once a week on Tuesday evenings.  I have almost no experience with cars, aside from changing a tire, and checking the oil, I don't know much else. I'd like to be able to understand how to diagnose some stuff on my own, at least have some sort of idea of what's causing something, so I can try to avoid in the future having to pay someone to tell me what the issue is when I can at least have an idea of what might be causing the issue....and not get scammed too, that would be nice. :)  I didn't realize the other one (50 B) was an introductory course as well, I thought you needed a prerequisite or something.   Can you ask him which course he would recommend for me to take from my description? I might take both, but for now I'm just focusing on taking one course."

De Anza did remove the prerequisites for their night classes, though: they want to get more people into the classes, and also understand that hobbyists (as opposed to people looking to go into automotive maintenance careers) will be taking their courses in the evenings.

SanJose,2yzp5g,loganz,8,Sat Mar 14 20:55:19 2015 UTC,"So how would white LED lights ""preserve"" the controlled sky light conditions that the observatory needs? I thought that was why they put in the monospectral low-pressure sodium yellow lights in the first place."
SanJose,2yzp5g,frumperino,9,Sat Mar 14 06:12:37 2015 UTC,"To make it simple...The reflectors now are fantastic and The LEDs they use are only directed in 1 direction, down, instead of a round lamps that puts out light in every direction. They put the Low pressure sodium lamps out originally because the light travels a relatively short distance. Also, the telescope up there doesn't really need low light anymore if I remember correctly."
SanJose,2yzp5g,ScottyB6,2,Sat Mar 14 17:06:58 2015 UTC,I was also wondering how this would affect the observatory functions.

SanJose,2yzp5g,cbr600guy,1 point,Sat Mar 14 10:59:34 2015 UTC,"I've wondered the same thing. I heard anecdotally somewhere that the LEDs are more directional which makes it okay, but that may be hogwash. That said, I know their directionality irks me--where the sodium lights cast general illumination, the LEDs can be pretty damn bright if you're lined up with them."
SanJose,2yzp5g,undiurnal,3,Sat Mar 14 08:03:22 2015 UTC,"Optically efficient lighting equipment: Other types of street lights use a reflector to capture the light emitted upwards from the lamp. Even under the best of conditions, the reflector absorbs some of the light. Also for fluorescent lamps and other lamps with phosphor coated bulbs, the bulb itself absorbs some of the light directed back down by the reflector. The glass cover, called a refractor, helps project the light down on the street in a desired pattern but some light is wasted by being directed up to the sky (light pollution). LED lamp assemblies (panels) do not require reflectors and can be designed to provide the desired coverage without a refractor.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_street_light"

Why not have someone help you develop an app that hooks up people locally for this purpose.   What is the point of your project short term/long term?
SanJose,2yythh,adamwho,2,Sat Mar 14 06:29:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for asking!  We do have a person who is willing to keep up the project after the semester is over.  The only people who will see the information are the four of us.  (It's insane how heavily guarded even just a phone number is nowadays.)  We would LOVE to have an app but none of us know anyone who can code.  Otherwise a website and a location matching algorithm for parent matching would be awesome.  The point of the project is an experimental short term with potential to go long term.  I said all of that in present tense, but it's looking like the scope is too big for four people with no coding ability and no capital.  Even if we are only reaching out to low income communities without easy access to the internet, it would be a lot of work without a proper algorithm.  Your questions will really help with the changes we're making to our future project though.  Thanks again!"

Right now, the broadband network in San Jose is a patchwork, with some areas offering adequate service, but a lot of areas with either inadequate or nonexistent broadband. That's unacceptable, and it's come as a result of the natural duopoly of Comcast and AT&T. We're the Silicon Valley, home to some of the biggest tech giants in the world, with entrepreneurs and startups and a thriving tech and gaming community. The demand is there for true broadband, and that demand is not being addressed. And U-Verse is still throttling my service.   I think we should break ground on public broadband as soon as is practical, and accept help along the way if folks like Google want to help.   I know one thing: I'd buy municipal bonds if I knew that the money was going to address our broadband infrastructure. Though that does remind me that we also have other dire infrastructure needs. I have to replace the suspension on my car, for example, because the roads and highways in the area are in such disrepair. Still, it doesn't have to be one or the other."

These Municipalities are not going to just build an entire new network infrastructure they will provide an end point but Comcast or AT&T will more than likely be the cities upstream provider, and the city will place the Access points where people can connect to them.   Our current officials will not act unless the Fed provides some rebate system like the Public schools get, San Jose just doesn't have the budget IMO. Future ones will probably have more choices in providers, if Elon Musks Satellite system is launched but otherwise we are just going to shift money from paying Comcast / AT&T as individuals for poor service, to play those same companies via tax money for poor service and shared -SLOW- speeds across the city."

He travels a lot for work, and told me that US towns are looking less and less unique as time goes on.  Strip malls with the same layouts, same chain retailers and restaurants, and any uniqueness to these towns were gone.  San Jose, specifically district 9 is starting to have this happen to it, and it's sad.  When the shopping center gets redeveloped, the only thing they're going to keep is the Cambrian Plaza carousel. Otherwise it's going to be the same, bland square boxes we're seeing built everywhere else.  Edit Just wanted to respond to /u/leaningfizz below.  Cambrian Plaza represents what was a very popular architectural design, mostly in California.  It has several names, ""Mission"" or ""Spanish""  The style is meant to mimic the original spanish missions that were built along the El Camino.  There was many more like it back in the day, the Pruneyard being one of them.  I disagree on it being ""bland"".  The old Pruneyard was a gorgeous shopping center.

That's not personality, as I said, it's just cookie cutting with a different cutter.  If you think the government is going to come up with a dozen different looks and impose one on each new center, obviously you've never worked with government before.

SanJose,2yu291,atomicllama1,5,Fri Mar 13 17:41:10 2015 UTC,"Massive parking lots are what make the south bay so comfortable. When in the south bay you can pull in and stop your car any where. It doesnt sound like that big of a deal but it is. Seriously, when you are driving in San Mateo, parking is a lot tighter and less abundant. Although it not that bad at all. Go more north and you get less and less till you are in Daly city where parking is a pain but manageable. Then you finally get to SF where you can easily spend 30 minutes looking for a parking spot. Tickets are $70 and if you have a big car/truck you might as well just double park and accept the $70 ticket because the parking structure will charge you double for a large vehicle.    The new luxury parking lot and new shopping centers they build make just enough parking where it sucks but people are still willing to tough it out to go to chipotle or wing stop."
SanJose,2yu291,atomicllama1,4,Fri Mar 13 17:50:49 2015 UTC,"You said exactly what I have been bitching about for a while now.  The bay area is being designed by cookie cutter corporate constructions companies. Who have algorithms to maximize square feet, parking, and rent prices. They already have X amount of plans made up that are easily modified to fit a given area.   So what you end up with is luxury apartment xti1232489 with chain restaurant, 324 , 879, and 2201 and large retail store 227i. It seems like more and more if you want to go to a unique restaurant it has to be in a super old building. Everything that is new has already made a contract with 7 different chains and no one local can use that area to make a store front.   The south Bays problem is that most people dont give to shits about the history here. It not like we are a historical place like rome or NYC, but really it like we are willing to completely bulldoze the land and change it ever 6 years.   I can not tell you how many time I drive around an old area I haven't been in a couple years and I just see massive construction.  I am not against progress and I know we need more housing. BUT PLEASE make something interesting.  It not like we don't already pay ridiculous prices. Can't we get something that isn't the same thing that build in bakersfield. (no offence bakersfield)"

SanJose,2ysy7x,secaa23,23,Thu Mar 12 15:43:13 2015 UTC,"A Viet friend once took me to one of the clubs that were busted.  While we were there he explained the Viet mentality behind eschewing the laws.  Basically a lot of older Viets are uber paranoid about communism.  Most Viets are super Libertarian because of it.  Quoting my friend, ""MADISON NGUYEN IS A COMMUNIST!  THIS IS AMERICA!  WE SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO LEGALLY RUN THESE PLACES AND SHE WANTS TO SHUT US DOWN!""  He said it loud enough where other patrons heard him, and started applauding.  So to the Viet's that frequent these places, this is the percieved ""freedom"" of being an American.  They're not hurting anyone, there was no prostitution (Although there are pretty girls that will chat you up as long as you keep buying/tipping)  There's karaoke, there's smoking inside, and yes, gambling machines.  And in a lot of ways, I agree with them.   Why should Chuck Reeds friends get to open the Matrix?  Why should the Bumb family get to open Bay 101?  Why can't we allow business owners to decide if smoking is allowed?  Why don't we just let them have their gambling machines with regulation and taxation?  Why isn't the Alcohol board handing these folks type 47 liquor licenses?  If there's one thing I've learned in life, it's a lot easier to get people to conform when it's along the lines of what they're already doing.  Example I love to use is from my 7 Bamboo days.  People kept using the back door to go in and out, so eventually one day I woke up and realized, ""This should be our entrance""  If our local government is truly to be ""of the people"" then we need to let the majority rule on this one, and leave these clubs alone (but have regulations)"

Heavy reliance on part-time faculty (Profs who work during the day at companies in the Bay Area and teach in the evening). This is not really a bad thing as all of the ones I've had were pretty good.

Oh. Yeah, most of the rent in the area would be considered insane, and prices have actually gone up in the past few years. If you check Craigslist, Hotpads, Trulia, Padmapper, and Lovely, you'll see that rent in the area even for just a room can be on par with renting a townhouse as close as a few hours drive away.   If you're making a decent income—and incomes in the area for careers tend to pay a bit more than elsewhere precisely because of the cost of housing—you might be okay, but just be aware that you're going to be spending a lot more on rent than people elsewhere.   This can get you started: http://www.trulia.com/for_rent/San_Jose,CA  As far as where, I find that the best places are right on the line between nicer parts of town and shadier spots. I'm about ten blocks from the edge of Willow Glen, where highway 87 separated Willow Glen from some sketchier areas (areas with lower income/higher poverty, more crime, etc.). There are a few apartments that skirt that line that are cheaper because of the proximity to the lower-income areas, but which are still close to a lot of great stuff like decent schools, downtown areas/shops, parks, public transportation, and such.   Be very careful with rooms for rent or outlying prices. I've had some friends run into real trouble because they found a suspiciously good bargain. Right now, I'm looking at a room for rent in Alum Rock that's only $500/mo. Either the room is no larger than a fingernail, or something fishy is going on."

I actually own a shredder but with 10 years+ worth of materials built up, either my back or the shredder would give out prior to making any headway. An additional tip, approx 750 envelopes equate to 1 pound so don't bother removing them to save on weight or space. And with this awesome coupon, you can dispose of it all for free!"
SanJose,2ytl6y,glennmoorecle,8,Thu Mar 12 18:30:51 2015 UTC,"Transportation from airport - From SFO take the Bart connector to Caltrain. Short distance. Caltrain will take you all the way to San Jose. Caltrain is nice and safe.   Once you get into San Jose, you will need to take an Uber or taxi to the Garden hotel. Its about 4 miles away so it won't cost too much.   I suggest installing Uber on your phone. Its quick and easy to get around San Jose, but you are on the north end, so walking isn't an option unless you want to trek it.     There is a Casino (matrix) 2 blocks from your hotel. I have never been, but whatever, its right next to you.   If you go downtown (which you will to get to the venue), check out San Pedro Square. There is a big ""market"" with lots of little restaurants, good food and good drinks.   O'flaherty's irish pub is on San Pedro as well. Its a 5 minute walk from San Pedro Square to the SAP center for the event.   EDIT: I am retarded. I totally forgot about lightrail. You can take the lightrail straight from Diridon station in San Jose to Skyport avenue and walk to your hotel from there. Then you can take lightrail back downtown to hang out."

SanJose,2ytl6y,alexander13th,2,Fri Mar 13 16:15:35 2015 UTC,"Thats a fairly common problem for us in the South Bay. My suggestion which is not awesome, would be to take the last train up from San Jose -> Bart -> SFO the night before and just hang out for 6-7 hours at the airport.   SFO is nice, tons of wifi, nice chairs, and plenty of power outlets. Just go hang out, take a nap, or play some games or watch netflix. Will save you a bit on a hotel as well."

Possible alternative: get off Caltrain at the Santa Clara Station.  Take the (free) VTA Airport shuttle.  It will go through SJC to the Metro/Airport LRT station on First Street, right across from the San Jose Airport Garden Hotel.  This is the same station as if you took LRT from Diridon.

There's a reason it was on Man Vs Food. Get the ribs for sure. I'd recommend ponying up and getting the full rack over the half rack just so you have some leftovers for later. Another great spot downtown is Back-A-Yard; they do Caribbean food and make some mean jerk pork/chicken and you get tons of food for your money. If you're looking for a watering whole my favorite spot for beer is Original Gravity (35 taps), but there is also ISO Beer (40 taps) and Good Karma (22 taps). OG also has awesome sausages to go with their beers. Looking for a laid-back bar I'd recommend the Old Wagon Saloon. Paper Plane for a spirits bar that has a deeper selection of liquors than you'll find anywhere else in the South Bay. Mezcal if you want a different experience; I hate tequila and love Scotch and Bourbon but never knew what Mezcal was til I came here. If you're a whiskey aficionado I would suggest trying Mezcal as it contains some of the same smokey characteristics. If you or your group can't decide exactly what you want you should head on over to San Pedro Square Market. Home to over a dozen restaurants and several bars, there is something here for everybody.  So, once again:  Henry's Hi-Life  Back-A-Yard  Original Gravity  ISO Beer  Good Karma  The Old Wagon Saloon  Paper Plane  Mezcal  Best way to get around: light rail, taxi or Uber/Lyft"

SanJose,2ykyd2,robert_cortese,3,Tue Mar 10 23:06:39 2015 UTC,"As you say, we, at least for the foreseeable future, need to move oil. However, allowing oil and gas producers to use 50 year old rail cars that were never intended to carry volatile/explosive liquids and gases through a dense urban area is just crazytalk. Until the issues presented in the article posted by /u/KJ6RXW are addressed the city should taking a firm stance against the matter and continue to pressure state and feds to require the industry to make the necessary upgrades to ensure public safety."
SanJose,2ykyd2,Photosaurus,2,Tue Mar 10 23:57:35 2015 UTC,"Crazytalk huh?  Phillips 66 has said they have the newest cars in the fleet, and their safety standards are higher than what the NTSB requires.  NTSB says that under air travel, rail travel is the safest form of transport.    Considering transport by air would be prohibitively costly, there really isn't any other choice that's safer, and cheaper than rail.    Prohibiting the tankers is moot, since Phillips 66 would likely just transport by truck through our fair city anyways.  Personally, if given a choice between rail or tanker trucks, I'd pick rail any day of the week.  Too many crappy drivers in SJ."
SanJose,2ykyd2,robert_cortese,3,Wed Mar 11 00:27:21 2015 UTC,"You'll forgive me if I'm not inclined to take an oil company at its word. To address their ""newest cars in the fleet"" that are better than the regulated standards statement, let's look to the following section of the article.    DAVIES: All right, but to come back to the issue of the tanker car. So the railroads want heavier, safer tanker cars. The shippers save money by using the older, inferior ones. How much would it cost to actually upgrade the fleet of tanker cars, and is anybody doing it?  STERN: Well, they say it's about a $3 billion upgrade, and they're - and the, you know, the oil producers and the refineries, the shippers are balking. But it's a real - it's a delicate kind of a dance. They don't often come out and say that. What they say is that these upgrades are not necessary, that the oil is not so - as volatile as people say it is. So what happened is, the DOT - the Department of Transportation - initiated comprehensive review or a rewrite of the regulations right after Lac-Megantic. But we're here - we're a year and a half later, and those regulations haven't emerged. It's sort of is a very, very good example of how the regulatory process, in many cases, has fallen apart through the negotiated rulemaking process that gives the industry a very loud voice at the table. And they can delay, and they can dilute, and they can delete a lot of these provisions just simply by objecting.  It's funny. We Americans are very familiar with the gridlock in Congress, but I don't think they're as familiar as a - with the similar gridlock that takes place in a lot of regulatory agencies, and certainly at the Department of Transportation when it comes to crude-by-rail. They have not been able to get these regulations out, and it's been more than a year and a half.  DAVIES: You know, it's interesting because, as you describe that, I think a lot of commercial interests say, you know, government regulatory agents are tyrants, imposing rules on us that they don't really understand the impact of, and it's really unfair. You say there is a negotiated rulemaking process. I mean, where's that ordained? Why is it - you want to explain that a bit?  STERN: In the past couple of decades, it's just really evolved that the rulemaking process is much more of a negotiated process. A lot of it happens in secret, behind closed doors. But essentially, the industry has a - is able to give a lot of input. So is the public. But the industry always has a little better access. Groups like the American Petroleum Institute have a budget of more than $200 million a year. The American Association - the Association of American Railroads has $50 to $60 million a year. And they do a lot of lobbying in Washington, so they get their voice heard a little better than the average person in the public."

SanJose,2ylskp,beer-and-broccoli,9,Wed Mar 11 03:18:38 2015 UTC,"I was homeless for about 3 months when I was 16.  Long story short, both parents were crappy, and CPS bounced me between both their houses and the childrens shelter.  Mom kicked me out on my 16th birthday (her goal was to have me declared a ward of the state to keep me from my fathers family)  I went back to 1440 Roberts Road, the Santa Clara County Childrens Shelter.  I saw the same kids there from 2 years prior, and realized that this system designed to protect children was just warehousing them.  I had already fallen behind a few years from my friends and school, and decided right then and there that living on the streets (Specifically under a bridge on Hamilton, next to the car wash) would be infinitely better than waiting a year or two for the courts to make up their minds again about what to do with me.  3 months later, with holes worn on the soles of my shoes I went to my grandmother for some day laboring so I could get a new pair of converse all stars.  ""Robert, I don't know what's going on with your parents, but no grandson of mine is going to live on the streets like this, you'll live with me from now on"" she said to me.  TL;DR the foster system is shit, and so is the county shelter system. From personal experience."

SanJose,2yiw96,Azmordean,2,Tue Mar 10 07:38:00 2015 UTC,This comparison would only make sense if walking was faster. I don't get this at all.
SanJose,2yiw96,dscreations,3,Thu Mar 12 03:59:37 2015 UTC,"There are way too many stops on light rail.  By trying to serve everyone the system is so slow it serves no one.  They need to take a hard look at the system and eliminate a chunk of stops.  They could also have it set up such that not all stops are operational at all times.  NYC does this -- certain stops are only made during rush hour, and so forth.      Just looking here in Mountain View, the Evelyn stop is utterly superfluous.  Thankfully, I heard on the news it is slated for removal.  I also wonder how many people actually use Whisman.  Middlefield is near offices so probably worth keeping.     Getting rid of stations makes some unhappy, but would make the service more useful.  Express trains that skip a lot of stops would also be an option, but I suspect the frequency is high enough that any express option would get stuck behind a local."

But there are planned improvement to the LR, especially along N 1st St, see http://www.vta.org/projects-and-programs/transit/light-rail-efficiency  I expect that, after that improvement, taking the light rail will be faster. If the light rail were underground downtown it'd also be much faster, it's currently super slow because people jaywalk."
SanJose,2yiw96,niugnep24,3,Tue Mar 10 14:53:38 2015 UTC,"My daily commute is 10 minutes by car (no traffic) or 20-30 min in traffic. 30-40 minutes biking. Or about 50 minutes on LRT (including a 1 mile walk from home to the light rail). I'd still rather ride light rail than drive, because it's so much less aggravating.   But my ride is totally on the section of the system where all the routes share the track, so the space between trains is usually only 5-10 minutes. If I had to wait for a specific train to show up, that would be much more painful."
SanJose,2yiw96,iKs279,2,Tue Mar 10 16:19:15 2015 UTC,"The LRT efficiency project will help a lot of things, but unfortunately will make the line from diridon terminate in downtown, so OP's route will require a transfer."
SanJose,2yiw96,froekenroej,2,Thu Mar 12 00:22:48 2015 UTC,"When trains/light rails/subways are frequent enough, transfers are painless. In Paris for example, you can expect the next metro to show up in 2 minutes, so the transfer doesn't really matter and people transfer all the time as a matter of fact.  Whether that will be the case here in SJ, I don't know. But I think that occasionally we've built super long lines with 7 different ""lines"" doing the same trip in the city center, to try to avoid transfers (see BART, VTA LR, Muni LR), which leads to ""congestion"" downtown."
SanJose,2yiw96,nuvistor,6,Thu Mar 12 01:48:08 2015 UTC,"Mostly, that's a lovely walk, too.  When I lived downtown I took the lightfast to work, and worked on my laptop.

From my ~4 years experience commuting from DTSJ to mountain view by car, train and bike:   Car: 35-70 minutes, with average being 45 minutes  Light Rail: 51 minutes Bike: 53 minutes   Light rail usually wins because you can nap on the train or read a book.

I've personally thrown away hundreds of pounds of wasted, rotting food that homeless people get from shelters or steal from stores. No doubt, there are plenty of homeless out there that benefit from this food charity but the funds used to buy the food could be used elsewhere like keeping sheets and mattresses clean at the shelters to create a more inviting place to stay. Food for a night is a much more short term gain than having a decent place to sleep at night"

Most of the homeless I've worked with, granted mostly in different states than California, are the ones who have either run out their stays with the shelters, can't get in due to massive over crowding, or various other situations, where the main thing on their mind is where the next meal is coming from. And if I can give them a sandwich and some snacks so they don't have to steal or beg for it, than I've done my job.

And I'd strongly suggest instead of going out on your own and doing what you ""think"" is right or needed, you should instead go volunteer or give money to one of the many agencies working on trying to resolve the problem more holistically. Go volunteer or give money to the Second Harvest Food Bank - their dollars can stretch much further and they can provide a lot more food for the investment than you can. Go volunteer at Martha's Kitchen to help cook for the homeless. Go see what kind of help (likely financial) a place like Inn Vision could use.

SanJose,2yiml6,smeezy,7,Wed Mar 11 05:57:39 2015 UTC,"People should stop feeding these things, they suck one day you'll find out, I've seen a homeless man beat his homeless ""girlfriend""right out side of a food bank i was volunteering at, steal her food, and tell the workers that were trying to help the girl who just got mauled by the guy ""to fuck off back to Mexico"" these homeless people are horrible crack heads, causing problems and committing crimes, sure they'll put on a facade oh ""poor me im homeless"" until they get dope.  I want nothing more than to see these people gone After volunteering at foodbanks all through out high school i can recognize an actual homeless person from someone who's a doper, and the majority of these people are dopers, the meth limp, missing teeth, open sores, It baffles me all these transplants & people of San Jose want to help someone who can help themselves."
SanJose,2yiml6,dabup,7,Tue Mar 10 05:56:51 2015 UTC,"People should stop feeding these things   Holy shit, grow some compassion.  Pretty sure the vast majority of homeless people don't want to be homeless, given a choice in lifestyle. Many of them are addicted, or have mental disorders, or have been jaded by violence and injustice for years. But they are still humans. Many are stuck in a cycle of poverty, disease, and addiction with no reasonable way out.  I encourage you and others to be more compassionate to the less fortunate, and see the world from their point of view. After all, one way to solve the homelessness ""problem"" is to give the homeless a way to integrate back into ""productive"" society."
SanJose,2yiml6,smeezy,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:43:55 2015 UTC,"They never will integrate into the ""productive"" society is the thing, a lot of them love the life they live and won't ever want to integrate back, besides collecting that ebt check and getting food and drugs out of it, the reality is there is only so much compassion one can have towards these people until enough is enough, like thats cool you can call me and my daughters fucking morons, thats cool you can follow me and key my car because i didnt give you your dollar for your crack because you're feinding, am i supposed to feel sorry for these people? not any more im dont with their bull shit and they get a way because they're homeless and less fortunate? they honestly have done this to themselves."
SanJose,2yiml6,dabup,2,Wed Mar 11 14:34:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry you've had a shitty experience with certain homeless people. Projecting it onto the entire population though... that's unwarranted.  If you're not buying the ""empathy for fellow humans"" angle, here's another way to look at it: it costs us less to house and care for the homeless than it is to marginalize them.  Caring for the homeless is a start to a better situation for everyone involved."
SanJose,2yiml6,smeezy,2,Wed Mar 11 16:02:34 2015 UTC,"So then why should it cost me anything if they are the ones that are messing up, ""hey lets build projects for homeless people""  watch the crime and drugs ensue. People can be shitty, and i'll be shitty back, I'm sorry, but you've obviously have'nt had enough experience with this population to realize it, here ill give you another real life example, homeless man asks my niece for money, being naive and trying to be nice gets close to him, he PULLS HER IN AN ALLEY AND TRIES TO RAPE HER. Im sorry that after really bad experiences I've made up my mind about these people, but it also doesnt help that they have nothing to lose and resort to these things.  Maybe you're not out often enough.   In cities like Chicago or NYC people have seen it enough and don't bat an eye at the ones on the streets, the ones they have some sort of compassion for are the ones that are trying to get it together, but then again anyone can just tell me a sob story."
SanJose,2yiml6,Concani,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:25:00 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry about your bad experience. I think you're painting with too broad of a brush, but I can see how a violent crime can shock you into classifying an entire group of people as somehow non-human.  I doubt any amount of data or study on the nature of homelessness will change your mind, so I won't try. I hope you have a safe and secure life."
SanJose,2yiml6,Cheesejaguar,0,Thu Mar 12 04:38:50 2015 UTC,"Saying this during the such a bad economy is pretty rude.   Saying this when America has 37% of people out of the job market is just wrong.   I hope you never end up working a job where you live hand to mouth and I hope you never lose that job suddenly. Because then you might know what it's like to walk a mile in their shoes.   Contrary to popular belief many homeless in the South Bay also work, they are the working homeless. Can you imagine that?   Working 30+ hours a week and still living in a shelter?"
SanJose,2yiml6,Concani,4,Tue Mar 10 15:31:16 2015 UTC,"I think his post was just a crass way of explaining that there is a huge difference between someone down on their luck because they were laid off, and someone who can't get work because they have a felony on their record and a narcotics problem. The latter is loitering downtown in St James Park or in the former Jungle, the former is living out of their car or maybe at the InnVision."
SanJose,2yiml6,Cheesejaguar,3,Tue Mar 10 17:52:01 2015 UTC,"There is tremendous cross-over between the two. You can't, he can't just lump an entire swathe of people into two handy categories.   Times are hard, so we must soften. Shelters often kick their clients out all day long and people don't often have a place to go or anything to do. Imaging being kicked out of Montgomery Street Inn  near the Shark Tank at 7:00 in the morning and being told not to come back until 5:00 that night.   How would you occupy your time with zero income, no car etc?   People who stay at InnVision do plenty of loitering around the city believe you me."
SanJose,2yiml6,Concani,3,Tue Mar 10 17:54:58 2015 UTC,"From having volunteered at the InnVision on Montgomery Street though, you probably wouldn't recognize 2/3rds of the people that stay there as homeless. They have semi-regular access to showers, laundry and basic toiletries.  They're also generally not panhandlers."
SanJose,2yiml6,dabup,2,Tue Mar 10 20:02:46 2015 UTC,Not generally but people from MSI and JSI do panhandler at the Target Plaza nearby.  I agree that most of the homeless are camouflaged pretty well.

SanJose,2yiml6,dabup,2,Wed Mar 11 14:31:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay, so several crack addicts apparently represent all of the homeless.  And I agree that I'm living pretty nicely, because I have a roof over my head and a job, none of which are available for the homeless."
SanJose,2yiml6,m37driver,2,Wed Mar 11 22:27:11 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying when it boils down to it, there are way more scummy homeless people who suck and do not give a fuck about anything besides dope and maybe the occasional 40 oz and maybe sometimes food when they're coming down from drugs, and then there are the ones that actually try, which are far less, instead of standing on the corner, pissing yourself, go to one of these many places where you can take a shower, shave and look for a job, and don't get mad at me when i dont give you any change, because i need it more,  why should i give this homeless person money/stuff when there's 40 more down the street, one on every block."

Take a bike ride down the san thomas creek trail into alviso. At the table have a couple tall cans and ride back. It really the perfect day. And extremely cheap day time activity.   Only other area I know of is Vasona. Which is also an amazing bike ride.

SanJose,2yej5y,autowikibot,3,Mon Mar 9 05:15:33 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawbridge,_California"
SanJose,2yej5y,Concani,2,Mon Mar 9 15:36:18 2015 UTC,"Drawbridge, California:       Drawbridge (formerly Saline City)  is a ghost town  with an abandoned railroad station located at the southern end of the San Francisco Bay on Station Island, now a part of the city of Fremont, California, United States. It is located on the Union Pacific Railroad 6 miles (10 km) south of downtown Fremont,  at an elevation of 7 feet (2 m). Formerly used as a hunting village, it has been a ghost town since 1979 and is slowly sinking into the marshlands.   Drawbridge was created by the narrow-gauge South Pacific Coast Railroad on Station Island in 1876 and consisted of one small cabin for the operator of the railroad's two drawbridges crossing Mud Creek Slough and Coyote Creek Slough to connect Newark with Alviso and San Jose. At one time 10 passenger trains stopped there per day, five going north and five going south. The drawbridges were removed long ago. The only path leading into Drawbridge is the Union Pacific Railroad track.  In the 1880s, on weekends nearly 1,000 visitors flocked to the town. By the 1920s, although the town had no roads, it did have 90 buildings, and was divided into two neighborhoods: the predominantly Roman Catholic South Drawbridge, and the predominantly Protestant North Drawbridge.

SanJose,2yej5y,sloowshooter,6,Mon Mar 9 15:55:01 2015 UTC,"Used to go out there when I was a kid. Last time was probably in the early 80's. Then some bureaucrat decided that it wasn't safe and now you can get a ticket for going out there.   Also, if you decide to explore, stay on the tracks and trails. The ground might look safe to walk on but it's just a crust over sludge, break through the crust and get stuck out there and you're in a world of hurt. Don't go alone."
SanJose,2yej5y,atomicllama1,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:57:00 2015 UTC,I think instead of a Bureaucrat it was all the people running along the infamous tracks.   But I agree that the public should have access to this landmark. Never  heard of the sludgecrusts though.
SanJose,2yej5y,hell_on_wheel,2,Mon Mar 9 17:00:45 2015 UTC,I sometimes still duck hunt out on the Bay. It's not a place to get stuck. A lot of waders are still in the mud out there that have been left behind.

SanJose,2yej5y,dodgerh8ter,2,Tue Mar 10 20:55:17 2015 UTC,"Depends on which ones you bring home. If you are selective about your shots you can get birds that are quite good. Also depends on the time of the season, once the migration starts (during a year they are forced south from the cold) they cycle through fairly quickly.  Still, given the choice I'd rather go north to the Sacramento area refuges or Upper Butte Basin. That's where all the rice fed birds linger."

I think it's more because the people in SF who hate on SJ (aka the people who didn't live in SF 7 years ago) moved to SF because of a very specific allure that nowhere else has right now.  If you're in it for the long haul (I'd argue that most people in SF haven't planned more than a year out in their lives), her perspective is almost right, but she understates how hyper-exclusive every creative scene in SF is and how much most people in SJ DO NOT want to be like SF, hip, or trendy.""  Also the author is coming from very much the perspective of someone involved in the art scene which has its own nuances that differ than what the general population might experience."

There is tech in San Jose but the San Jose I live in is a town of barbers and truck drivers, ice cream cart pushers, Welfare receivers and trolley drivers, tech exists but I'm not near it, hardly in it, and it does not overwhelm the San Jose I live in."
SanJose,2ya8hh,nuvistor,1 point,Wed Mar 11 08:45:45 2015 UTC,"You just reminded me of a conversation I had with my friend many years ago: San Jose is a city overflowing with culture but tries so hard to not show it. Now that I'm older, I'm seeing that the structure of the city has a lot to do with this. There is so much sprawl, and so few centralized public areas. Arguably, the main public centers of this city are its shopping malls, but they are, by their very nature, not receptive to organic cultural growth.  There are definitely exciting glimpses of what San Jose could be. I really enjoy the last time I went to the subzero art festival (does that still happen?). And I always enjoy going out to First Fridays (though they tend to fizzle out relatively quickly when compared to similar events in other cities). It's too bad the city tries so hard to make downtown the epicenter of San Jose's social scene when there are many other places (like where people actually live) that might be more optimal targets of growth. Then again, the sprawling nature of the city might cancel out any efforts to grow a vibrant city identity."
SanJose,2yaten,clone_stamp_tool,9,Sun Mar 8 02:25:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Rancho San Antonio. There are several paths there of varying ease. The network there is complex enough that if you bring a map with you you should be able to add on things depending on how spry you are feeling.   As far as more scenic hikes. Check out the Sections of the bay trail that start in Castle rock going north.  If you want to ""get into hiking"" learning the basics of reading a TOPO map would help you in the long run for gauging route difficulty."

SanJose,2yaten,SeekTheReason,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"How easy?  My kids were able to do this one when they were 4yo, so I consider it pretty easy.   Drive up to the end of Alum Rock Ave and park. This is the old entrace to Alum Rock Park. You can't drive in this way anymore, tho.  However, there is a service road there that goes off to the right. (not the steep road the goes straight).   This road/trail eventually goes down to the picnic area in Alum Rock Park. IIRC, it is about a 2 mile hike down."

SanJose,2y25kg,livinincalifornia,2,Sat Mar 7 06:25:59 2015 UTC,"Sure. In order for San Jose to have such a high per capita GDP, it's people must work.. a lot. 10/12+ hours in not uncommon, and in jobs that require serious physical and mental acuity. Typical Bay area worker spends 1 hour+ in the car per day, which extends the work day even further and is exhausting. After arriving at work and keeping up with the high pace, high stress competitive world of professional life, we all get on the freeway and sit in traffic, hoping to get home by 6 or 7pm. At that point, there is little room left for any leisure activity whatsoever. The weekends, those are used for grocery shopping and errands. If you can manage to make time, and have some money left (since rent is so amazingly high), you might get a weekend every few months to travel and relax a bit.   Factor in as well the poverty and disparity in incomes, and you have a society divided by those who have, and those who have-not, contributing fragmented communities. Some single family houses have 2 or 3 families living in them, which also is a strain on the community, it's resources and the infrastructure to support it.  There are many factors, these are just a few in the Bay Area that I have observed in the last decade."

Grew up on the east coast but has also traveled all over the country as well...most cities don't include a large majority of standard suburbia in their proper city limits. The houses are basically long row houses. Even the downtown doesnt feel like a city with everything so spread out and not really that tall

Comments like these though make me realize how ignorant people are about suburbs. My parents house has a walkscore of about 13, while my condo in San Jose has a walkscore of 95. Go move to a real suburb, like my parents house, and then you will have to walk 2 miles to get to the closest stores. Have transit connections where it would take 4 hours to commute from one side of the county to the other. One seriously has to drive for 15-30 minutes to get anywhere. Real suburbs don't have an urban core like San Jose does."

If someone called me a hippy, they wouldn't necessarily be wrong, but the problem is the title evokes a certain cliche, an exaggerated caricature.   SJWs aren't all furious people who want to censor everything for the sake of treating people like they're made from glass. Whenever I've been called a SJW, it's because I was arguing for equal treatment and, even moreso, equal opportunity. I don't want people coddled because they're not in a position of the privileged class, nor do I care to demonize the privileged class or blame whitey or straightey or cisey or whatever. I just want people to be treated with the same basic level of dignity and respect, and for everyone to have a fair shake in life. No one should be at a disadvantage in life because of how they were born.   You don't have to be a subscriber to SRS to recognize that gay people are second-class citizens in some respects and that their being second-class citizens should change. I assume you think gay folks should just be treated like any other folks. There's no reason to prevent them from getting married or visiting their husbands/wives/significant others in the hospital.

Numerous additional ambulance, fire department, and police department resources were tied up for hours trying to cut these shitheads out of their reinforced concrete barrels.  You certainly have the right to protest, but the rest of us also have the right to ignore you and continue about our day.  How many people who others depend upon to be at work (doctors, nurses, pilots, teachers, etc.) were stuck in traffic for hours today?  What about the guy that is on his last dime and HAS to be at work today to put food on the table for his family tonight.  Furthermore, we all have the right to expect emergency services will be available when we need them, instead of being tied up on highway barrel duty.  Purposefully blocking public infrastructure and endangering lives is unacceptable, and should be punished very harshly.  Unfortunately, I fear this hippie highway barrel bullshit is going to become a thing now, since it's happened a few times in the past couple months.  I propose getting a little crane to drive around and relocate these people+barrel contraptions to a public square in the center of town.  Let them figure out how to get out on their own.  Maybe even set up a little stand that sells things to throw at them.  Alternately, tourniquets and bone saws are much faster (especially since they are probably using carabiners and could voluntarily detach)."

The UC regents in LA were barricaded into their own building during a fee hike vote... and it still passed!! Hundreds of students just meters away from the decision makers were getting arrested and pepper sprayed over their exorbidant tuition, and yet nothing changed. They don't care about public opinion. They're like the oil industry. People will buy their product no matter what.   I understand how angry this kids are, but they need to learn from past mistakes. Protesting is obsolete"

I went to UMass Boston, and we had similar protests for tuition hikes... as our buildings were crumbling due to bad architecture that the school was trying to fix.  Kids want their schools to be better, they want improvements, they want more activities and funding... yet they don't want tuition to increase to make room for these.  The solution the protesters at UMass Boston had was to cut the salaries of the employees, which is absolutely fucked up."
SanJose,2xu9lb,allthegoinbetweens,6,Wed Mar 4 17:50:26 2015 UTC,"In the case of the UC's and California's budget, many people disagree with how funding is allocated. A lot of the time the money is there, but the State and the school spend it on the wrong things. I transferred to SJSU and I know that here we had a fee hike for supposed technology improvements in the classroom (I can't remember the official title of it) but it turns out all went to the sports teams, which caused an uproar.   The whole point of state schools are that they are suppose to be subsidized education that allows low and middle income people to recieve higher education. When tuition and housing are five figures, there's something disasterously wring with the system. From my point of view, the point of the protests are to raise awareness of how state education and government are being grossly mismanaged at the expense of low income students."
SanJose,2xu9lb,niugnep24,-1,Wed Mar 4 18:58:35 2015 UTC,"but it turns out all went to the sports teams, which caused an uproar.   The thing is funding sports teams brings in more students and a lot more money. Football in particular is one of the biggest money makers for Universities.  The problem is more students are going to college than ever before. This rise in demand has led to the need for more dorms, more classrooms, more professors, etc. All of these cost money, and that money has to come from somewhere.  Low income students can still receive huge grants from the federal government and go to school either entirely for free or with minimal government student loans with low interest rates."
SanJose,2xu9lb,Krahn007,3,Wed Mar 4 19:05:39 2015 UTC,"The thing is funding sports teams brings in more students and a lot more money. Football in particular is one of the biggest money makers for Universities.   The return on the investment is debatable, and the point still remains that there was fiscal mismanagement and dishonesty.  As someone who is struggles to pay for school, FAFSA only provides grants for REALLY low income students. Those in the middle are left hanging. I have already taken out $20K in loans to pay for school because I don't qualify for need-based grants, and even when I did a few years ago, I was only given a $1K Pell grant, which covers basically nothing. My total school/living expenses are roughly $16K a year, and that would be significantly more if I lived in the dorms--which I might add are also supposed to be subsidized living.  Like I said, there is gross mismanagement of the system."
SanJose,2xu9lb,FSMCA,0,Wed Mar 4 19:12:48 2015 UTC,"I dealt with the same thing in school a few years back. When I turned 24 and was considered independent, it was better. I actually got quite a few pell grants.  I agree there is probably gross mismanagement of the system, but we don't really know the financial standings of the universities. Expecting tuition to never go up, as more and more students are attending college each year, is still extremely naive."
SanJose,2xu9lb,novalord2,2,Wed Mar 4 19:18:14 2015 UTC,"It may be naive to expect it not to go up, but I don't think thats what the students expected. They know fully well it's gonna go up--like its has almost every year for a decade now--but I think they're doing what they can(even if misguided) to change the course. I'm entirely on their side. I think if the federal government can pay for two wars and endless drone strikes, they have the ability to pay for my college, and I think they should. When looking at the longterm growth of the economy, its a huge mistake to make college students foot the bill for their own education. A society of debters is a society with a stagnant economy."
SanJose,2xu9lb,traffick,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:54:35 2015 UTC,"Protesting is obsolete   The point of protesting is to demonstrate that people hold a certain opinion, and to get that word out.

If someone is protesting just before a decision, expecting that the protest itself will reverse that decision, they're an idiot."

Being late is not an option, so I generally leave early and have an alternate route just in case.  But say I'm on 17 behind these guys.  What are my options? It looked like they had their own vehicle blocking all the way to the shoulder.  Can I physically grab them and drag them to the side?  Probably not, and wouldn't work unless others helped as well.  Can I drive at 1 mile an hour and hope they move?  Probably not.  That guy chose yelling, which didn't help much.

SanJose,2xtu3f,cardinal2007,14,Tue Mar 3 20:56:08 2015 UTC,"I have to say, that the conclusions seem to talk about national solutions, that ignore the realities of Silicon Valley and San Jose. Like increasing housing subsidies, it will do little unless we build more housing. Increasing the national minimum wage to $10.10/hr, the minimum wage in San Jose is $10.30/hr, so people living on that in San Jose will not get more money, if anything you may be giving them a chance to make the same money outside SJ, and that may alleviate some issues, I doubt it is that significant.   Ultimately the author failed to address some of the major issues in the region, which is the lack of housing, in part affected by prop 13."
SanJose,2xtu3f,ave0000,7,Tue Mar 3 21:24:14 2015 UTC,"I was confused by the proposed solutions as well.  As someone just moving here, the lack of available housing blows my mind.  Just because I can afford to pay $3k/mo for rent doesn't mean I want to.  I'd be happy if the local housing prices were more sane, but for some reason there seems to be a relative lack of high density (eg high rises) despite the high demand.  I'm guessing there's regulation preventing building height or something along those lines?"

Part of it is keeping the aesthetics of the valley and another part is keeping the light pollution at a minimum for the Lick observatory as well as other environmental concerns.

SanJose,2xtu3f,robert_cortese,2,Thu Mar 5 20:56:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure Prop 13 is as evil as people make it out to be.  Silicon Valley needs its IT Admins, DevOps, Developers and the like... But we also need teachers, retail clerks, and guys and gals to drive the schoolbus.  Where do we get those latter people?  A good majority of them are of baby boomer age, and protected under prop 13.   My mother in law is one of them.  Before she started caring for my kids during the day, she was teaching a nursing class over at West Valley.  She doesn't have a trust fund, or a house handed down to her (prop 13 grandfathering, which I disagree with)  She's just a really awesome lady that worked hard her whole life, and wouldn't be able to ""take it easy"" so to speak if prop 13 didn't exist."
SanJose,2xtu3f,spreud,2,Thu Mar 5 04:16:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly, we also need housing for these people, and due to prop 13, no one wants to zone for it. So rents go up until the number of people willing to pay that rent is equal to the number of housing units, and it is usually those with lower paying jobs that can't afford those rents.  So yeah, because of prop 13 those with lower paying jobs can't really afford to live here anymore."

Good access to downtown from there, there's even a stop right near the main Cinequest theater (Camera 12)  For late-night stuff, I highly recommend Uber or Lyft, with a slight preference towards the latter (I've just had a more pleasant experience with Lyft overall, I have a referral code if you'd like some free credit!). SOME buses run past 11PM, but not in the direction you need. You can double-check when the last light rail ride is, though.  Wickedly Fast Wi-Fi is neither wicked, nor fast, in my experience. Fortunately there is a Starbucks right across from Camera 12, so you'll have easy access to that. There's also a Safeway nearby if you need a quick snack or drink, and plenty of restaurants and eateries within walking distance.  Best of luck, and enjoy the festival!"

I worked at the front of a hotel down the street and having female guests or even employees run inside because they were being followed was very regular.

SanJose,2xrdn8,ninekilnmegalith,7,Tue Mar 3 07:05:54 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem is they needed sewer and trash service.  San Jose acted because the state was going to fine us over the contaminants the camp put into the watershed.  From a civil engineering perspective, it would have been near impossible to put sewer in the bottom of a creek.  The right thing to do would be to let them build along unused rail track in San Jose.  It's high off the ground, there's already grading and drainage, and a lot of these areas already have sewer nearby."
SanJose,2xrdn8,ninekilnmegalith,5,Tue Mar 3 07:11:45 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with any solution that respects our neighbors, but officials apparently didn't feel the need to find one before casting the Jungle residents out into the rest of the city, again."

SanJose,2xrdn8,alexander13th,-10,Tue Mar 3 08:30:01 2015 UTC,"Here's another solution. We petition the state to deport the illegal immigrants who currently take up 1/3 of our prison population. With the new vacancy we now have room to clean up the majority of the bums. The rest of the homeless who aren't using drugs, stealing, drinking, fighting, murdering, being insane, etc can now squat illegally (we'll ignore that crime) and enjoy the additional free space in our San Jose parks. This plan works best since it helps reduce crime in SJ (let's admit that the bums cause problems), cleans out the prisons, and reduces the level of feces in our water supply. If that isn't enough, we can open up the old work camps that historically used to be part of California and a major deterrent to our summer fires. This would be a great opportunity for the bums who aren't crazy and actually desire to better their lot in life. At the very least these ideas aren't as dumb as the other ideas I've heard of such as letting these people (many of them have problems) setting up semi-permanent shanty towns/communes."
SanJose,2xrdn8,tomanonimos,2,Tue Mar 3 09:42:04 2015 UTC,I remember those work camps.  We used to have one on Mount Hamilton.  Then it became a CYA (california youth authority/minors jail) for a while. Then it turned into regular firehouse (California department of Forrestry or something)  I wondered what happened to them.  Did the fire unions push them out?
SanJose,2xrdn8,sj213,2,Tue Mar 3 16:46:55 2015 UTC,"Spot on. Once they closed the jungle we had a number of new ""residents"" move into the los gatos creek trail in San Jose.   You can't solve homelessness by moving someone from one tree to the other."

He said ""I just saw you have more"" and proceeded to pressure me to give him more $$$.  I am not giving you $20 asshole.  As I left I was so fumed that it made me want to take my $1 back.

Try to be the panhandler you'd want to be panhandled by. A lot of people go through their whole day without a genuine personal interaction - so be that interaction.

SanJose,2xrdn8,tomanonimos,3,Wed Mar 4 01:10:59 2015 UTC,"Their benefits are roughly the same (or at least, they were until Measure B passed).  I believe the difference is that San Jose does not participate in Calpers, and as a result actually funds its retirement system more adequately than Calpers has.  Calpers is currently underfunded by about 50%.  The result is that it appears San Jose pays a lot more for benefits, but in actuality everyone else is simply not allocating enough money for future benefit costs."

I've also been to Single Barrel in jeans and a t-shirt. I don't think it was anything personal. Sorry you had a bad experience.
SanJose,2xppi7,bradynelise,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:58:28 2015 UTC,Actually it was booked out for New Years. They held a private event that was invitation only.
SanJose,2xppi7,camus_absurd,1 point,Tue Mar 3 00:17:48 2015 UTC,Thanks I have realized that now.   Totally my bad
SanJose,2xppi7,Concani,2,Tue Mar 3 01:37:33 2015 UTC,"I walked in wearing shorts and a tee shirt.  First time, nice place.  Sad to see it go."
SanJose,2xppi7,nate_5603,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:37:39 2015 UTC,Tried going last week. Friend in his mid-30's got denied due to a hole punched ID. Which was not expired.  We went to Paper Planes instead and had a grand time.
SanJose,2xppi7,ACMTtampa,4,Tue Mar 3 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"I've got a punched id as well. Lot's of places don't accept it. I recently traveled to Vegas and it's the same there. Some do, some don't. Better get a new id."
SanJose,2xppi7,CapnQuirk,2,Tue Mar 3 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"My punched ID (changed my name) never worked anywhere. The DMV told me a punch in an ID pretty much means, ""no longer valid."""
SanJose,2xppi7,bradynelise,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:13:28 2015 UTC,What would cause your ID to get punched?
SanJose,2xppi7,clunkclunk,2,Tue Mar 3 01:18:42 2015 UTC,Moving from a different state. They gave me a temp paper driver licence and punched out my old one.
SanJose,2xppi7,CapnQuirk,2,Tue Mar 3 02:19:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense."
SanJose,2xppi7,clunkclunk,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:41:13 2015 UTC,"I've never understood this. I mean, the thing still has your birthday on it. Just cause it's punched or expired doesn't change when you were born. And that's the real point, right? To verify your age?"
SanJose,2xppi7,GonnaStopLurkingNow,4,Tue Mar 3 03:58:15 2015 UTC,The guy told me that they look for    A valid ID. Age of patron above 21.   Both have to satisy. Punched card makes the card invalid.
SanJose,2xppi7,CapnQuirk,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:14:28 2015 UTC,Its because people will get a new one then sell their old one to someone that looks similar to them. Much less common with valid licenses.
SanJose,2xppi7,chubbybunny87,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:31:28 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel any better, I once had an actual, current and valid ID cut in half by a bouncer (random bar in AZ, not Singlebarrel). That was rad. Good thing I wasn't the DD."
SanJose,2xppi7,undiurnal,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:30:03 2015 UTC,"Darn, I had plans to come here once I become of the legal drinking age. I've heard only good things and the concept seems so cool..."
SanJose,2xppi7,MeLlamoChristina,-4,Tue Mar 3 04:53:39 2015 UTC,Glad to see it go.  Waiting in line for drinks is the kind of stupidity that needs to stay South of Canoga Park.
SanJose,2xppi7,sloowshooter,12,Tue Mar 3 04:46:24 2015 UTC,I kind of liked single barrel's system. Places like Paper Plane let you inside but good luck actually getting to the bar to order past 8 pm. Single barrel makes you wait but at least you don't have to fight to get an order in.
SanJose,2xppi7,leaningfizz,5,Thu Mar 5 07:14:35 2015 UTC,"yeah, but at least i can talk with friends and not be cold. anyway, whatever — i respect single barrel for their leadership when SJ was in a dead zone but i vastly prefer the atmosphere that paper plane and 55 south foster"
SanJose,2xppi7,typesett,3,Tue Mar 3 01:18:49 2015 UTC,Then don't go when it's busy. I've never waited in line there- my strategy seems to work brilliantly. It's not like there aren't other places to go on a Friday night.
SanJose,2xuaaj,Concani,10,Tue Mar 3 22:51:50 2015 UTC,"Misleading title. Most of these incidents aren't in San Jose (only this most recent one -- the others were in SF, Menlo Park, and Palo Alto). So, I don't think there's a safety problem in the city."
SanJose,2xuaaj,dscreations,2,Tue Mar 3 23:49:12 2015 UTC,"Well,  at least not in a way the train is involved."
SanJose,2xuaaj,m37driver,5,Wed Mar 4 00:55:15 2015 UTC,"The guy who jumped onto the track on monday was a friend of mine. He was struggling with a lot of things. He wrote a suicide note to his family even though most of them were  not a part of his life. People do stupid things, and jumping in front of a train is definitely one of them. Be respectful of the people and family's of the deceased."

SanJose,2xuaaj,LockNuts,4,Tue Mar 3 23:26:09 2015 UTC,"dude was hit on the monterey highway portion of the tracks. the tracks are for the most part raised and off the street. also, its not like there are blind corners, the tracks are as straight as the eye can see. there is no reason for being accidentally hit by a train there."

SanJose,2xuaaj,LockNuts,0,Thu Mar 19 13:06:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, get a life troll."
SanJose,2xuaaj,christofuego,2,Thu Mar 19 21:16:28 2015 UTC,"I assure you that I'm 100% sincere in this and not trolling at all.   I would honestly like an answer to the question.   If you remove all the assholes and idiots, who is left?"
SanJose,2xuaaj,LockNuts,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:24:32 2015 UTC,It probably due to urban sprawl. We should put in suicide nets...
SanJose,2xuaaj,m37driver,3,Tue Mar 3 23:02:39 2015 UTC,Or Facebook nets. I wonder how many people die or almost die from not looking up from their phones.

SanJose,2xroay,CyphyZ,1 point,Tue Mar 3 09:51:13 2015 UTC,+1 for Dr. Nakamura. He is really good at diagnosis and is very proactive in his treatment style.
SanJose,2xroay,randomracoon,1 point,Wed Mar 4 07:41:15 2015 UTC,"i must ask, where does one get a chinchilla as a pet?"
SanJose,2xroay,funinfuneral,1 point,Tue Mar 3 16:14:46 2015 UTC,"They sell them at PetCo. They're super cute and fluffy, and rather intelligent. However, they require a lot of handling (and ideally a second chinchilla) to keep them happy and socialized."
SanJose,2xqwre,deafidelity,3,Tue Mar 3 03:24:18 2015 UTC,"Generally, the best deals come from:   Going to a mechanic that specializes in your car. E.g. if you have a BMW/Mini, Bavarian Motorsport in Milpitas is top dog - Ramon and Nicole only do these brands (Minis are actually BMWs), however, but that's part of why they know what they are doing. Generally cheaper neighborhoods have cheaper rents and a cheaper customer base so they either will give you a better price or not ripe you off so much.  Repair shops in Mountain View will tend to hurt your wallet more than shops in East San Jose. You can't generally say ""Just fix it"" without querying about what the real problems are.  You are asking for trouble this way. Sometimes, quality comes at a price.  ProStar in Milpitas is obscenely expensive but they actually do a decent job and have a decent warranty on the work.   This is just my experiences.  YMMV!!"
SanJose,2xqwre,mantrap2,3,Tue Mar 3 04:07:21 2015 UTC,"Chet's in Santa Clara is cheap and honest. I've sent males and females to Vu, and he's always come through with keeping clunkers gone long past their due date. Check out their reviews online."
SanJose,2xqwre,verdegrrl,3,Tue Mar 3 06:30:02 2015 UTC,"In San Jose I can definitely recommend San Jose Autoworks on 4th street near Japantown.   Just got more work done with them yesterday, they are fast and honest. Second time going there and I know I got a good deal because I've talked with a guy who used to be an auto-mechanic both times about it.   Marco over at SJ Auto Works is a good guy."
SanJose,2xqwre,Concani,2,Tue Mar 3 16:25:30 2015 UTC,"I've been using Michaux Automotive in Sunnyvale for years.  They kept my Jeep alive far past when it should have - and cheaply, at that.  Carlos and Julius (the brothers that own it) are kind of characters, but they will never screw you, usually do diagnostics for free, and charge face value for parts.  Can't recommend them enough."
SanJose,2xqwre,paroxysm11,2,Tue Mar 3 05:11:22 2015 UTC,C.a.r.s. In Santa Clara is great. Two brothers. One is the mechanic other does the number and stuff. Mechanic never pressed anything on me ( I am also female) and helped me get through a true struggle at the end of my impalas life. He NEVER did anything that wasn't absolutely necessary and was so nice.
SanJose,2xqwre,Glutengirl19,2,Tue Mar 3 10:47:38 2015 UTC,Oh and he worked really hard to find used parts for me.
SanJose,2xqwre,Glutengirl19,2,Tue Mar 3 10:48:20 2015 UTC,I've been very happy with the work I've had done at http://kevinsautorepairinc.com/

SanJose,2xqwre,Suntory_Black,2,Tue Mar 3 22:36:08 2015 UTC,"I don't want to create a new post basically asking for the same thing, so maybe somebody can reply here:  Does anybody know a good, trustworthy mechanic that works on old cars?  Specifically a 1969 F150.  2 places worked on it saying they are capable of working on old cars, but the dang thing still has a bunch of issues even though just about everything under the hood has been replaced.  I need to find somebody who actually specializes working with these types of cars and not try to screw us over."
SanJose,2xqwre,cheesewizliz,2,Tue Mar 3 22:37:10 2015 UTC,Honda owner. My go to place is Acura Honda connection.  They've always done well by me.
SanJose,2xqwre,sloowshooter,2,Wed Mar 4 19:28:48 2015 UTC,Had some good experiences at Checkers in East SJ
SanJose,2xqwre,Jarnagua,0,Thu Mar 5 02:08:57 2015 UTC,Thank you everyone for the suggestions! I'm going to check a few of these places out for sure.
SanJose,2xqwre,DextromethorphanRush,-4,Tue Mar 3 18:15:58 2015 UTC,"It's 2015. You've got unlimited speedy access to more information then ever before in history. Be a real man, study, watch some videos, and do it yourself. Or at the very least study up on the problem and go to a mechanic armed with knowledge. I don't take my cars to mechanics because I've found that most are either corrupt/rip off for more money, or are so ignorant I can do better work then them. Plus, I actually care about my cars, the mechanics don't."
SanJose,2xowcw,dscreations,24,Mon Mar 2 18:09:35 2015 UTC,Never go to Valley Fair or Santana Row again... got it.
SanJose,2xowcw,girl_incognito,5,Mon Mar 2 20:31:59 2015 UTC,"Seriously. If people think the traffic is bad there now and in the past, wait till it has the gimmicky garage and that admittedly sweet sounding theatre. Its one of the reasons i avoid Valley Fair as it is."
SanJose,2xowcw,chupacabraiii,3,Mon Mar 2 21:27:29 2015 UTC,"well once they finish building the 880 offramp it should get a bit better.  Also if you come in the back way, like from Naglee, it isn't so bad.  Parking is still a bitch though.  Looking forward to the theatre"
SanJose,2xowcw,flinxsl,2,Tue Mar 3 03:39:53 2015 UTC,The 880 off ramp was just finished and it is soooo much better. The right most lane now turns directly onto Monroe allowing all the cars that used to queue up to turn right on Stevens creek direct access into the mall parking lots. This makes the remaining lanes much less crowded for the drivers that aren't going to VF.
SanJose,2xowcw,Brunzy,22,Wed Mar 4 08:50:01 2015 UTC,A kiosk will let you type in your license plate number to find where you parked the Corolla.    That doesn't have any possible applications for aspiring stalkers.
SanJose,2xowcw,leicanthrope,5,Mon Mar 2 19:09:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm wondering what sort of privacy protections, if any, they're going to build into this.  Would be better if you just got a ticket or passcode as you left the garage, and only that key would get you back to your car..."
SanJose,2xowcw,hell_on_wheel,2,Mon Mar 2 20:00:33 2015 UTC,"On a privacy front...  I would be genuinely amazed if Westfield hasn't found a way to utilize the data from these scanners.  Even if they can't match the license plate numbers to identifiable people, they've got a potential goldmine of information on how often people come to the mall, when, how long they stay there, etc.  Additionally, something like this could easily be utilized for law enforcement purposes much like the system that they already have in place over at the Arden Faire mall near Sacramento."
SanJose,2xowcw,leicanthrope,2,Mon Mar 2 20:24:27 2015 UTC,"something like this could easily be utilized for law enforcement purposes    Geez.  Didn't even think about this.  You're totally right.  Westfield better be super transparent about how they use this data, lest they get a rude letter from the EFF.  I know the door's wide open for the ""well you're already in public"" crowd to naysay any privacy concerns, but technology is rapidly destroying any hope for any sort of anonymity in public."
SanJose,2xowcw,hell_on_wheel,4,Mon Mar 2 21:05:26 2015 UTC,"Huh?  What cave have you been living in???  ALPRs ALREADY has been/is being used for law enforcement use.

They people that are complaining about the traffic most likely come during the absolute rush hour. Going to Valley Fair at 12pm on a Saturday or a Sunday is going to be packed, but you have to expect that.

Then 10 - 15 minutes walking around. Then repeat to get out. It overcrowded and 90% of the food there sucks.   Just avoid this place anyway."
