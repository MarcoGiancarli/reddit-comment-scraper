glasgow,3dqca2,AnarchieInAlba,6,Sat Jul 18 13:02:34 2015 UTC,I can't help with identifying the driver but your granny can make a civil claim for personal injury through the Motor Insurers Bureau - they deal specifically with untraced and uninsured drivers. They will even carry out investigations so it would be another party looking into it.   If she can try and get a law firm to deal with MIB for her - because they can be a shower of eejits in terms of time scales and injury payouts.

It's been pretty much smooth sailing thus far, and I think it comes from the change in the people here, the situation has changed yet the stigma prevails, whereas if we're talking about certain unsavoury elements of the public, both in the forms of Ted Bundys and drug dealers and prostitutes, they will be chastised as it's them that made the poor choices, the flats have done no wrong since they're just a vessel which at one point harboured the very dregs of Glaswegian society and to be honest, I haven't seen a single bit of any actual filth or dereliction in my parts.

Literally couldn't keep any food in the flat, had to sleep with lights on and vigorously shake shoes and clothes before putting them on. A neighbour matter-of-factly informed us it was the ""sandal wearing, hot-bedding Arab bastards"" faults.

We had a brothel in the flat across from us that also dealt on occasion. Blokes trying to get their dick wet would slither in and out at all hours.   Had our bikes stored in front of the lifts on our floor. Some neds came in and cut the locks and nicked our bikes. Security staff (although great to hang out with) were fairly useless at producing CCTV footage for the police.   In the underground parking there's a few guys dealing and more guys taking bits off cars.  I didn't notice any cockroaches or overly offensive filth.  If you're not bothered by any of that then there's not much wrong with Wallace Street. It's got close access to the motorway, buses and underground and town is only a few minutes walk. It's no bad."

glasgow,3ddgoz,the_c00ler_king,8,Wed Jul 15 19:35:40 2015 UTC,"Updated maths:  85000 people attend (on average) a single day at T in the Park. There were 44 arrests over the weekend in 2015, so let's say an average of 15 per day. There were 606 incidents seen to by the Scottish Ambulance service, so that is on average 202 incidents per day. Maths would suggest that there was a 0.018% arrest rate, and a 0.237% incident rate.  The Arches had a total capacity of 2400. In one evening in March 2015 there was 26 arrests and 1 incident. Maths would suggest that at total capacity, there was a 1.08% arrest rate and a 0.04% incident rate.  Therefore, in the comparison above, using current publicly available figures, The Arches had a 60% increase on arrests, and a 17% increase in incidents in comparison to T in the Park. In one night. In a venue with a total capacity of 35 times smaller than T, over a few hours."
glasgow,3ddgoz,Veloglasgow,6,Wed Jul 15 13:10:43 2015 UTC,"Good effort on the maths, but it's 60x more arrests per person at the Arches going by your figures, not 60% more.  I make it 6000% more arrests (adjusted for equal numbers), but I'm shit at maths.  That said, you need to factor in the fact that the Arches were more proactive in reporting offences to police, the fact it's easier to detect crime in a much smaller group of people, the ratio of staff/police to attendees etc."

glasgow,3ddgoz,DONT_GOOGLE_ME,3,Wed Jul 15 18:45:04 2015 UTC,You say...   The decrease in sales would have a knock on effect on the size of the festival and its ability to attract international artists.

I think perhaps you've fallen foul of the policy some places have that says it's got to be cash for transactions under a fiver or so.  Poundland does it, and IIRC the offies near me does it too. I guess the reasoning is that the processing fee eats up too much of the profits on purchases that small.  saying that, the card swiper might have been for other stuff like prepaid phone credit, prepaid utilities like gas and electricity. Now I think about it, things like prepaid utilities can't be paid for with credit/debit cards either, they're cash-only transactions. I doubt you were topping up your electricity meter though."

Both located in the city centre, well priced and all in all a good place to sleep. If your budget is a little tighter then there are various hostels around the city. In terms of things to do there's loads, a few personal highlights from the city are the Gallery of Modern Art, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and The Riverside Museum. There's an incredible night life in Glasgow that caters for all types of folk as well, bands play in the hundreds of venues large and small all over the city, every night of the week. There's a tonne of clubs and pubs that range from standard chart songs, rock/metal/punk, house, etc. Whatever you're looking for then Glasgow has it somewhere, even if you have to look. In terms of eating, Glasgow has hit a bit of a boom in terms of quality restaurants recently. Try Bread Meats Bread(was there again tonight, it's banging), Homemade Burger Co, Mother India and Kublai Khan to name but a few. Check the Glasgow Life page in general and if you've any questions about anything in particular then I'll try my best to give you an answer."

The Byres Road ones are bit keenly priced and the staff always go through the gear before it's put out I'm sure.  Dumbarton Road and Hyndland ones are old foggey gear.  I'd say you could could riffle through my charity bag but it's a bit weird.  Also, Urban Outfitters don't buy anything from stores here, it's all turd from the States afaik."

I can't imagine there being any that specialise in decent or designer clothing, most of them are not for profit and aren't that fussy about donations unless the person donating takes the piss.   You'll have to buy designer stuff from the appropriate shops or make do with the items found in the charity shops. I've actually found some decent bits and pieces in the charity shops I've been to, but then again there's not much I won't wear for the right price."

Don't remember what they're called, but there's a couple of independent thrift shops with a more high quality selection. On Dumbarton Road there's one place by Poundland with a better selection as well, but mostly women's (especially special occasion dresses). I'm also a volunteer at Chest, Heart and Stroke further up the road, and we've had some amazing donations of new and barely used Topshop and Zara clothing, but you need a good deal of luck to get to them first."

glasgow,3d2cmz,hlainelarkinmk2,6,Mon Jul 13 00:50:20 2015 UTC,"I hope this is a joke. Fresh Living and similar scam companies offer extremelly overpriced accomodation to people who thinks that the only alternative because ""students live in dorms"".  I just checked their prices, and their bronze studio is like £750 a month. I live in a very similar property, but from the private market, and much nearer to the university, and I pay £400 (plus bills, so in total like £450).  Please, stay away from all these scam companies."
glasgow,3d2cmz,the_phet,0,Mon Jul 13 14:28:21 2015 UTC,"I meant Fresh Student living, having just checkes their prices they charge £134 pw so £ 536 pm including all bills and a gym membership which isn't horrendously much more than you're currenrly paying"
glasgow,3d2cmz,hlainelarkinmk2,3,Mon Jul 13 15:09:11 2015 UTC,"First of all, £134 doesn't relate to a monthly cost of ""x4"", because months have more than 4 weeks. It is better to do a x4.25 which gives you a more realistic price. That goes to £570. That's around £100 more to what I pay in my own studio, which is nearer the uni, and which is not in a student dorm, so it is very quiet (something I prefer, something that most people prefer unless you are 20)  Secondly, what you describe is the cost for a single room (ensuite). In the private market, you get similar stuff for £400 to £450, or even cheaper if you search for a bit, all included and nearer the uni. You only have to check Gumtree, or even Glasgow Uni board. For example there was an ad a few days ago about an ensuite room in Yorkill (nearer and better area) for £300.  About the gym, any student can join glasgow uni gym for £60, that's £5 a month. A real gym.  These companies are a scam, which base their business on the desperation of students who arrive and need a roof to live asap. They are extremelly overpriced when compared to the private market.  I hope you are not spamming this forum with that."

glasgow,3d0ddx,barrivia,2,Sun Jul 12 13:36:20 2015 UTC,"I lived in Cessnock for a few years.

glasgow,3d0ddx,noodlemonkeh,2,Sun Jul 12 19:08:47 2015 UTC,I know a few people who live there and the only issues they have had was an attempted burglary (he had left his door open and interrupted them - but that can happen anywhere) and cars being vandalised on match day; apparently if some residents see an unfamiliar car in their street they assume that it is a Rangers fan stealing their space and key it.

Match days were a pain in the ass - I've never been into football, but I felt that I had to keep on top of Rangers fixtures just so I didn't have to deal with a shite subway ride home.

It's basically to stop dodgy landlords cramming people into unsafe buildings. There have been fires/deaths in the past in Glasgow due to this, iirc two students got trapped in a basement flat with bars in the windows. It's a pain in the arse but mostly sensible set of rules.

I then had to keep phoning her late at night to get information.  One day she phoned and said we have 2 cameras recording the incident, but they are too blurry to see the car reg, she said she had been in the car park one day at the same time to see if a car that matched that description was there again. She said she didn't see any car that matched the description. She said they used software to try and match the reg I gave her and they couldn't find anything similar.  This took weeks and me having to call several times, I tried to get CCTV myself from ScotRail but they said they wouldn't give it to me unless I was the police.  The damage wasn't massive, but I just had the car for a week and i'm a young driver, so if I claimed it on my insurance I would've lost my no claims bonus, which saves me £100's every year, just not worth it to go that route, so the damage is still there."

glasgow,3ckd8y,nillis,3,Wed Jul 8 19:32:05 2015 UTC,"Students flats are considered a 'relevant residential' property (that is, somewhere you live for a specific reason such as an orphanage, monastery, hospice, army barracks, etc) rather than a dwelling-house (somewhere you choose to live just because). Because of this, building student flats (but not converting existing buildings for the same purpose) is charged at zero-rate VAT and the furnishings, white goods and anything else that's not riveted in place like carpets and curtains can be submitted as capital allowances for further tax relief on rental income.  Basically it's more profitable than building actual homes."
glasgow,3ckd8y,JimmySinner,2,Thu Jul 9 04:02:42 2015 UTC,AIUI there's more incentives to build new than repair/modify. Which is bloody stupid IMHO.

glasgow,3ckd8y,ardbeg,6,Wed Jul 8 17:48:20 2015 UTC,"I am an international student here in Glasgow, but I don't understand this big push by the council for all of these student housing developments. I live in the west end, found a private flat to rent thanks to some awesome people I met here on reddit, and I see student housing everywhere already. While I understand how lucrative students can be while they are in the city, paying tuition to the universities, shopping, as of this year paying for NHS coverage, and cannot apply for benefits, but full time students are council tax exempt, so how does the council make large enough amounts of money to justify this? In addition it is not like a majority of them are going to stay in the city after graduation. So I don't see the future of the students themselves being the drive to build the buildings. I guess I just don't see how this benefits the city.   I feel like they are not looking long term, but I am grossly ignorant on the topic. So I would appreciate it if someone could tell me how the council benefits from all of the student housing structures already in existence as well as the ones they are planning to build. Also why do they not just restore these buildings and use them for the students? I understand these are historic buildings so, in my opinion, to restore them and use them for students is not the best scenario, but it is better than destroying them. Any information is appreciated as I have come to love this city (especially the sandstone buildings) and I hate to see how the city is destroying its own heritage for students. It is one of the reasons students choose to study at the schools here. To me it is a package deal, I chose the school and the city.   TLDR: How does GCC actually profit off of the student housing if full time students are exempt from council tax? Why don't they convert the old buildings to student flats instead of pulling them down?"
glasgow,3ckd8y,impulsive6791,9,Wed Jul 8 20:00:03 2015 UTC,"To answer your TLDR, several councillors will be getting massive bungs from developers to allow them to build student flats, time and again. ""Allegedly"", so I heard down the pub."

glasgow,3ckqtf,ineedapaper,3,Wed Jul 8 17:53:43 2015 UTC,"I live in the G3 postcode along the Clyde. If you mean Lancefield Quay, don't. The flats are cheaply built and full of problems, it's fairly isolated for getting places on foot (20 minutes walk for me to get to a decent shop or pub). The ones closest to the Hydro might be a little better as they are closer to Finneston, but if you are looking to spend that sort of money, you can get much better in the centre or the west end.  Personally if I would go West End but I have no idea what parking is like round there, I expect permit parking rather than a private space. The nice flats in the city centre tend to have underground parking."
glasgow,3ckqtf,what_katy_did,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:16:15 2015 UTC,"Been renting a place in lancefield quay this year, issue free other than the thundercunts ignoring allocated bays in the car park."
glasgow,3ckqtf,273BeLow,2,Thu Jul 9 08:21:08 2015 UTC,"Which building?   In mine, the lifts get stuck fairly regularly, the garage roller door broke for ages, I get blocked into my parking space by people parking where they shouldn't, there's a huge leak in the hall to the garage, water is coming into my flat round the windows because the cladding is failing, we're being leaked into in 2 places from the flat above and the factor is bloody useless, there were cockroaches when we moved in and the exerminator told us it's pretty common in that building, the fire alarm goes off fairly regularly, when it's windy there's crazy banging noises from the cladding outside and the building itself sways so our doors open and close, the hallways and stairs hardly ever get cleaned, there is some dog shit in the stair that's been there for months, all the flats have stupid immersion heaters for the hot water so if I get home late I have to either stay up or get up early if I want a shower in the morning and it's crazy expensive along with the electric radiators, council tax is insane, the people upstairs really like dubstep at 4am. That about covers it."
glasgow,3ckqtf,what_katy_did,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:44:11 2015 UTC,"Haha fairly sure we live in the same building, roller door was annoying but mechanics fail and at least they hired someone to watch the car park at night. Saw the notice someone put up about the dog shit, that one was disgusting and a bit bizarre someone would do they where they live.  Not really had any issues though, hallways are a bit of a state and need some repair/painting and only been there once when the fire alarm went off.  I keep meaning to call the manager of the company that looks after the building to do something about the car park, came home several times to folk in my space and then you have all the fuds abandoning cars in corners and such."
glasgow,3ckqtf,273BeLow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:54:47 2015 UTC,"My bedroom is right above the shutter and it's noisy normally, but the night it broke I got zero sleep as people kept trying it repeatedly and it was clanging and clanking away!  I'm not sure what you can do really about the car parking. To be fair, there isn't actually any proper signs saying it's allocated parking and I know letting agents can be bad saying a flat comes with parking when it doesn't. I had the wrong number space on my contract and the person it belonged to was a total dickhead about it. Certainly don't expect the factors to do anything about it!  One of the guys who came to do some repairs in my flat was chatting to me and said he was involved when the place was built. It was right in the boom and hailed as this great investment with gauranteed rents of a minimum of £900 month. So I can understand owners and landlords not caring about the place, especially with how high the factors fees must be. They've sunk a load of money into something that isn't giving back what they expected so don't want to invest any more money in it and make the flats nice for tenants."
glasgow,3ckqtf,what_katy_did,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:36:29 2015 UTC,"Ooft! Have my sympathy to being over the garage door. I'm at the opposite side but does mean I get woken up early every morning with enterprise pressure washing cars when I have the bedroom window/door thing open.  Yea at best a letter to every flat, not that it will stop dicks being dicks. I noticed one of the spaces near me has installed a locking bollard, tempted to do same if my landlord will allow! I'm away to Norway later in the month for a week so no doubt with my car gone folk will be pinching my space again!  Yea the only complaint is have if I put my hand up was how little effort was put into the place before I moved in. Hadn't even been cleaned never mind freshly painted but not planning to stay a huge length of time just between place I had with my ex and hopefully buying somewhere next year."

glasgow,3ckqtf,ferociousgeorge,2,Wed Jul 8 23:39:26 2015 UTC,"I say west end, the transport is good enough to commute most places, and there is more in the way of scenery. That's should be more than enough. I suggest if you can live with paying a bit extra £600+ maybe Hyndland. It's all very green with a lot of private residents gardens. I've even walked home on a night out to west end but a taxi is £7. I lIves right beside Partick station was handy as hell and good if you like the hassle and bustle but after 5yrs I got pissed off with people smoking/vomitin in my doorway so my suggestion is just off a main road to save this pish. Finneston is always good as well in the way of nightlife and the Kelvingrove is right there. But that's my opinion, I'm guessing city centre would be similar to my old flat but ten times worse down to foot traffic."
glasgow,3ckqtf,Rainbow0ctopus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"I would say west end, still close enough to to everything without being right in the centre. I live in G3 and find it handy enough for underground and partick train station but can still walk into the city centre in about 30-40mins if I feel like it. We pay £550 a month rent but that is pretty cheap for where we are and the flat we are in, we've just been here for ages and the rent hasn't changed! If you have £1100 to spend on rent alone, you'll have no issues finding somewhere decent - have a look at hyndland, dowanhill, hillhead and kelvingrove to name a few areas"

Or I'd go to an open viewing and show up to find someone shoving £600 in the landlord's hand straight away, and them telling everyone to go. Or having to race other people to the letting office. The next time I moved, in November, there was no hassle at all and got a place I actually liked very quickly.   If you're going with a letting agency, they'll want proof of income and other such stuff. If it's just a private landlord off Gumtree, they will be less fussy but you'll probably live in a shithole and they'll quickly kick you out if you don't pay on time."

glasgow,3bvcuv,Chazmer87,-3,Tue Jul 7 15:07:35 2015 UTC,It's a 50% discount because you split it between the two of you. You literally pay half as much. That's the bottom line.   See my chart above.
glasgow,3bvcuv,RememberedWater,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"Where did you find that chart? As far as I can see, and I'm assuming OP will not be claiming benefits as different rules may apply, a person who is the sole occupant of a property is entitled to a 25% discount otherwise you have to pay 100% - which, in most cases, will be split two ways so you'll only be paying 50% each, but that's an agreement between the occupants and not the council.  Edit: Misread your post, I just said what you said basically. When I commented initially I just wanted to highlight the fact that if OP did choose to live on their own they would be entitled to a discount on their council tax, so they should take that into consideration - obviously if they want to live with other people they would be splitting all the bills and thus it would work out cheaper but living with others is not for everyone."
glasgow,3bvcuv,ferociousgeorge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:38:55 2015 UTC,"No, it's not.  The Council Tax is levied per property and any discounts are worked out base don the number of eligible adults that live in the property.  If you live on your own then because you are the only eligible adult, you qualify for the single occupancy discount.  If you live with three students and you're the only non-student then because you're the only eligible adult, you qualify for the single occupancy discount and are the sole person responsible for paying the remaining 75% of the Council Tax."
glasgow,3bvcuv,RememberedWater,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"That's not relevant here, OP is not a student. They may share with students but that's unlikely as most graduates tend to not do that. They've got work in the morning etc etc. Sharing with students will also cost him more as he foots a greater share of this bill. If OP is wise he/she will not share with students.  Assuming everyone in the property is eligible (as is most likely) then the net discounts are:  people  discount 1       25% 2       50% 3       66% 4       75%   Council tax is a shit tax. Some claim it's ""fair"" because discounts & housing benefit etc exist but all of these systems exist to make it as arduous as possible to get it. The council sits back and claws in a fortune from people who give up on it. I know many folk on low-paid variable-hour contracts who had an absolute nightmare with it."
glasgow,3bvcuv,ferociousgeorge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:59:18 2015 UTC,"That's not relevant here, OP is not a student.   It doesn't matter if the OP is a student or not, what matters if the other people in the house are eligible to pay Council Tax or not.  I used the point about students as an example as they can generally claim an exemption if they are full time. It's equally possible that he is sharing with unemployed people in which case they will also be exempt.   net discounts    If you phrase it that way then what you are saying makes more sense, although I've never ever heard of anyone expressing the Council Tax in terms of the net discount - most people just take the ""divvy the bills up equally"" approach.  I do understand what you are getting at though.   Some claim it's ""fair"" because discounts & housing benefit etc exist but all of these systems exist to make it as arduous as possible to get it   I can't say I've ever had a problem claiming benefits in the past, although I suppose other people's experiences might be difficult.  I don't think it's a particularly good tax either as it happens, but perhaps it will be replaced with something better that still keeps the principle of ""everyone contributes"", as I think that's important."
glasgow,3bvcuv,RememberedWater,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:07:07 2015 UTC,"I've never ever heard of anyone expressing the Council Tax in terms of the net discount   Exactly but at the end of the day all you care about is what comes out of your own pocket, right? In a way it's pretty misleading to sell it as a ""25% discount"" when they would be far more clear by saying ""you only pay 75%"".   It's no different from the calculation you'd go with when figuring out shared rent and I dare-say this plays a role in someone choosing how many people to share with in the first place.   FWIW I suspect single person discount exists purely to make this sharing of the bill fairer. The 25% figure fits in nicely with the sequence.    I can't say I've ever had a problem claiming benefits in the past, although I suppose other people's experiences might be difficult.   With zero-hour contracts a person can go from literally 0 hours in a week to full-time employment in an unpredictable way. Particularly in industries with seasonal demands.   As Housing Benefit etc are means-tested a person in this situation essentially has to have their benefit re-assessed on a monthly basis. That means full disclosure your bank accounts, wage slips, tax forms and some council biddy asking you to justify the £20 you took out the bank to buy shoes.   This is rather time consuming and frankly depressing to anyone in this situation. They are treated like a child incapable of managing their own affairs. And with the jobs market being hammered a few years back these zero-hours contracts have become more and more common.   perhaps it will be replaced with something better that still keeps the principle of ""everyone contributes"", as I think that's important.   If that was the intent it's no longer the case today. Students/children, OAPs, the unemployed and long-term sick all are either except or have their benefit ""paid"" for them by the dole. We've actually got the government administering benefits for the purposes of paying taxes to itself. WTF? If someone were to propose this system as-is out of the blue we'd kick their arse for being completely retarded.  A simple local income tax is all that's needed, applied equally to both capital and income gains. Apply the usual thresholds of ""free, 10%, 40%"" for sensible limits and it's infinitely more equitable than what we have."

Sounds very Poll Tax to think of levying it on individuals rather than properties, but that's not necessarily a bad thing - it is, after all, individuals that consume the services.   As Housing Benefit etc are means-tested a person in this situation essentially has to have their benefit re-assessed on a monthly basis.    This is the point behind things like Universal Credit and Rapid Reclaim, although I'll admit to not knowing how effective they are in practice.   A simple local income tax is all that's needed, applied equally to both capital and income gains   Why?  My capital gains are not necessarily connected to my economic activities in the local area/community.  Why should the local authority rather than the national government tax that?  I'm not necessarily opposed to a fair local income tax, but I am not at all certain why it should extend to a local capital gains tax too."

As it stands now the whole system is corrupt, GCC are particularly well known for their shenanigans.    Why should the local authority rather than the national government tax that?   Mostly because they provide the facilities that allow you to continue investing. They disposed of your account statements and played a role in delivering them to you via the road network that also provides all of your other consumables. If you have kids then they attended local schools. And so on.  By just being in a place you are a ""drain"" on resources. I sometimes earn from contracts with foreign companies while working from home, should I be considered except and ""not working"" during that gig? What if my income is mostly capital based dividends as I'm operating through a Ltd?   If council tax were simply replaced with an income tax then a lot of above-average earners would find themselves paying a lot less due to their tax setup.

My fund managers are physically based in London and my accounts are operated entirely online, however I'm happy to pay to the local authority for the roads to be maintained but I don't necessarily believe that should come out of my capital gains.  Consider the fact that the proceeds from those capital gains (particularly when they are unrealised and income-generating) may well make their way back into the local economy and if taken as income, the local authority will get a piece of that too.   If you have kids then they attended local schools.    For which I would be happy to pay GCC for in terms of some sort of tax on my income, be it one that is levied locally or nationally.   I sometimes earn from contracts with foreign companies while working from home, should I be considered except and ""not working"" during that gig? What if my income is mostly capital based dividends as I'm operating through a Ltd?   Discussions of IR35 aside, you're presumably avoiding as much tax as possible by paying income tax on your PAYE whilst supplementing it with whatever tax is due on your dividend income.  That's quite different from Capital Gains Tax though.   If council tax were simply replaced with an income tax then a lot of above-average earners would find themselves paying a lot less due to their tax setup.   The projections that the SNP were making about their local income tax would have had large numbers of people significantly worse off as a result.  The devil is, as usual, in the detail."

The problem with the West End is the quantity of scammers on one side, and people who takes almost everything on the other side (the guy living in front of me, chinese, is paying for a flat exactly like mines, but in worse condition, £550, he doesn't care though, becase he is kind of rich).

It's not quite true though, is it? West has had to close off their grassy bit for drinkers and Blackfriars has had a sign saying that all patrons staying outside should be sitting down for a few months, now. Maybe there was no PR about it but the measure was already known from pub owners, I think.  Anyway, it's a pretty dreadful decision."

Im obviously the reason Glasgow still has a shit council.   How can easy motorway access to a city be a bad thing?! Public transport (buses) use it to get in from afar without taking forever. Cars use it to get in an out quickly meaning less traffic in outlying areas, west end, Finnieston, Bridgeton, Eglington Tolll...  I can't even see the environmental impact being that bad, in fact all you'd be doing by moving it elsewhere is moving the bad air somewhere else, and the motorway through-traffic isn't causing much pollution, in fact by reducing journey times you effectively reduce emitted carbon, so having the motorway so close to the city is meaning we have vehicles spending less time stationary and more time moving, ie, less carbon.

The people are warm, very friendly with a good sense of humour. Where are you studying? Transportation around the city is very good, with a very simple to use subway, good buses and cycle hire throughout. A lot of students stay in the leafy west end. It's a good area with lots of independent bars, restaurants, shops etc. City centre is good, however I found it a bit loud at times. Across the River Clyde is the Southside, though the commute from here can be a bit longer (depending where you're based).  Being a vegetarian, you are spoilt for choice. Peta named Glasgow 'most vegan friendly city' recently. Good places would be Stereo, Mono, The 78 and Tchai Ovna to name a few.  What sort of things are you interested in?

glasgow,3bpozr,eddiegrice,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:23:41 2015 UTC,"There's a decent workwear stall at the Barra's.  It's outside, in one of the streets.  As far as I know, it's run by the guys that own the fishing and angling shop on Shettleston Road.    Bill's Tools is at the Barras too, but his workwear is a bit expensive.  Mostly overpriced Dickies brand stuff.  That's pretty much it for the east end, but if you can get yourself to Tradeston, there are a couple of great places.  There's a good army surplus place that does a big variety of workwear."

glasgow,3bo7vm,RememberedWater,5,Tue Jun 30 20:30:09 2015 UTC,You can contact HSE if you are concerned. They have an online form where you can submit a report. You should follow this step by step process however.  This seems like a workplace concern so again follow the steps provided.  My baws were incredibly sweaty so I just went and sat with them out in the cubicle.

glasgow,3bo7vm,twistedLucidity,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:27:43 2015 UTC,Not even a minimum; only that it be reasonable. Says as much in the link /u/jaaykidd provided.
glasgow,3bo7vm,twistedLucidity,2,Tue Jun 30 20:58:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, but the point is that there is no hard and fast legal maximum beyond which you can say to your employer that they are breaking the law and that you are downing tools.  Given that call centre work is sedentary, I'm going to guess that his employer will take a more liberal interpretation of what constitutes ""reasonable""."
glasgow,3bo7vm,ComicalAli,2,Tue Jun 30 20:59:15 2015 UTC,"Yup, and this mostly comes down to the employer not being an asshat.  Call centre work is a meat grinder. Staff have zero value to the company and any complaint will mostly likely get you fired as it's so easy to recruit a new wide-eyed, naive schmuck.  Cite: ex-call centre worker myself."
glasgow,3bo7vm,twistedLucidity,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:09:16 2015 UTC,If enough complain then they have to respond.
glasgow,3bo7vm,captainhollandaise,2,Tue Jun 30 21:03:10 2015 UTC,"Tricky. What is ""reasonable"" in a heatwave? Most places I know will hire portable AC units if there is nothing already installed.  Do you have a uniform/dress code? You could ask about lifting that during the heat. e.g. allowing shorts/hiking kit etc.  Wear linen, try to get air moving (fans or open windows if not using AC), drink water.  Unless your bosses are total asshats, they will be reasonable. If you decide to pursue it down offical routes, begin looking for a new job. Not just in case they find a reason to sack you, but also because they are total asshats!"
glasgow,3bo7vm,captainhollandaise,2,Tue Jun 30 21:03:13 2015 UTC,"total asshats   Pretty much this, were ok with dress code but they will refuse to spend money to help us."
glasgow,3bo7vm,catalinawinemixer,2,Tue Jun 30 21:07:19 2015 UTC,Zero rights I'm afraid. If its too hot there's no much they're  obliged to do other than open a windae. If someone keels over though then they might have a case to sue the employer for negligence.

glasgow,3bo7vm,Zumodoki,2,Tue Jun 30 21:31:34 2015 UTC,It's meant to be 35c on Wednesday. If they have a heart or even a brain they should have fans otherwise folk will end up disgruntled and unmotivated if they feel their employer doesnt care about them. Anonymous shaming of the company via social media is a good way to force PR conscious firms into action but it can be risky.

The cab would be about £15-20 if you just hop in one outside the airport or you could book a private cab to get you at the pickup zone for a little less. Maybe about £10 max for the private cab.

glasgow,3be4xd,Weeturpy,9,Sun Jun 28 10:55:43 2015 UTC,"I thought this was pretty interesting. I've seen people with the high visibility jackets picking up litter and wondered what they'd done to get there. I realised it was some sort of community service but now it makes sense.  It appears that the scheme worked for the writer; he's less likely to litter again after doing this. I also liked how the supervisor motivated the group by getting them to think of it as an opportunity.  Yeah, there's a few grammatical errors and spelling mistakes but I feel that suited the piece as this is how some Glaswegians speak (and write). I wouldn't expect someone picking up cigarette butts to be writing a polished article in the style of a Vice gap-yah hedonistic party blog."
glasgow,3be4xd,loosebruce,2,Mon Jun 29 09:44:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's what I was going for with the writing style. I do actually write properly when I'm writing something for publication. I'm planning to contact GCC and write a broader feature on this, but I don't think I'll be posting it here.  Also everything you read has been sub edited at least once, I just put this up myself."
glasgow,3be4xd,RememberedWater,9,Mon Jun 29 09:54:26 2015 UTC,"Forgetting the quirks in this article, the message is all the same. No army of litter pickers will counteract the sheer amount of people in Glasgow who don't bother to use bins or ash trays.  We Glaswegians keep banging our drums about how we voted ""Aye"" and we are all about sticking up for the wee man, but we seem to fail to acknowledge more pressing issues like having the worst records for heart disease and strokes in Scotland, pothole riddled streets that are worse than a Somalian B road, drink and antisocial behaviour issues and of course litter.  Inb4 its all Glasgow Council/ Illuminati/ Orange Lodge's fault"

Decided to dump it all back in the street and a bin was installed within the week on the lamppost."

Sadly a lot of these businesses are short lived, be it through financial constraints and or the Local Authority being knob jockeys; Nusou used to do lovely noodles, and the boys from Fire in Babylon now have a permanent residence at The Rum Shack. StreetFood Scotland have a decent list of folk as well and I bet that most of the weekend markets in Glasgow will now have some form of catering."

""Right ill be takin them instead then."" Deciding that 3 lukewarm pancakes was a fair trade off for not getting battered by 8 people I handed them over and began to walk up the path. I had gotten a wee bit up the path from the group when I heard the head ned shout ""Here hawd up!"" as he ran up behind me. Of course, I had gotten off too easily I thought, here he comes to give us the customary smack to the head.

glasgow,3b3cxr,tarnid,7,Thu Jun 25 17:11:34 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend and I bought a flat in the West End this past month, first time buyers too. The advice I was given (anecdotally) is that most places are going around their home report value or even above. We offered a little below the value of our flat and had it accepted. My sister's West End flat was sold six months ago for bang on its home report value too.  I think the bottom line is offer what you can, not what you think the sellers want. Be mindful of what you can afford and don't pressure yourself into offering an amount that you'll struggle paying. I mean, it's nice living in a flat you love, but it'll wear pretty thin if you're left with no money to live."
glasgow,3b3cxr,themysterycat,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:08:46 2015 UTC,"My experience when selling/buying 18 months ago was that estate agents were setting the offers over price at about 10% less than the home report value, and expecting to achieve around hrv.  However, prices were still pretty down on the 2007 peak and a few flats we viewed were valued massively over the o/o price with no hope of achieving it and sellers not open to low offers due to negative equity.  Prices seem to have picked up, but I'd still go with the hrv as a guide. Obviously if it goes to a closing date then things can be a bit different."
glasgow,3b3cxr,seonzie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:37:22 2015 UTC,"If it has been on the market for a couple of weeks then you have no idea what the interest is like, and the seller isn't desperate yet, so close to the asking price might be a better idea.   If you can find a relatively desperate seller, it can be quite good. I recently bought my first property for £68k (1 bed in Knightswood), with a HRV of £75k, but the seller bought it for £87.5k just before the housing crash."

You can check out sale prices on sites like zoopla.  Bear in mind that if you offer anything over the valuation, the mortgage will not cover it. You need to find that yourself along with the deposit. Personally I wouldn't buy in the West End due to the over-valuation and me being a tight-fisted wee shite."

glasgow,3aytfw,joydivision84,2,Thu Jun 25 10:37:25 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of things you gotta understand, your first year on that course will offer several classes from the school of arts and social sciences, which English is a part of. I presume this is to give you a grounded framework, and perhaps a little variety. For example I had classes in psychology, sociology, history etc, as well as English classes. In your second year you cut that down and have two broad subjects, separated into various classes, for example I had a few history classes and several English classes. By the way when I say several I just mean specific classes related to English studies, such as 'the renaissance', or 'atrocity and modernism' (one of my favourite classes I did there may I add, recommended. In your 3rd year you can major and minor (two subjects) or dedicate to one (just English for example, like I did). In your 4th honours year, same deal, more specific classes and your dissertation which makes up about 40% of your total mark.   Let me just add I studied English there and graduated in 2010. I'm sure your course will be a little different! But the broad, 6 subject first year should be pretty much the same. By the way you have some say in what subjects you choose there (minus your English core), so don't worry too much.   Regarding your hours, I'm going to be a little more serious than others here and say you should have at least 12 hours of classes a week. I'd advise you to go to all of them, especially seminars. If you miss them you'd be basically wasting your time and money.   From experience I'd also say it can be hard to be a full time student and work full time. In fact, I'd say that's a bad idea, but everybody is different. University work isn't just classes and lectures as you said, on that course you'd be expected to read multiple books a week for example. I'm serious. So or takes times, as does working on assignments and getting together with other students for group work.   The commute also may prove difficult, I knew people coming in from much closer who found it a pain, but they might just be lazy bastards! I'd advise looking into moving to Glasgow though, but I love Glasgow so I'm biased!   Either way. You'll love it. It's a great course with an excellent reputation and the University is laid back, yet far from un-academic. Good luck."

glasgow,3aytfw,zebradee,2,Thu Jun 25 21:04:16 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're a mature student. So I'll warn you that the JCW course is full of insufferable 18yo cunts who are so ~proud~ of themselves for getting in with their superior portfolio etc. I was only 21/22 and could barely stand sitting through classes with them. They settle down by second year, though.  First year, you can skip most of the English lectures after the first couple. Maybe go to one for each book? Just read all the online notes and definitely go to all your tutorials. You can't really skip any JCW stuff though, I don't remember how spread out that is over the week but you'll need to make the trip.  Have you picked a third subject yet? I think you do that during Freshers Week, like an orientation thing. So you might have a timetable with ALL the subjects on it or something. You'll only have to pick one extra.

Not sure thatll apply to English but Id imagine therell be similar. Dont bank on having complete days off, theres a good chance youll have a few lectures, a big gap, then anothrr one or two later.   Until you know for certain what your timetable is, theres no real way of knowing Id say."
glasgow,3aytfw,mrchrisroden,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:32:44 2015 UTC,"As far as i know they get that number by taking a day as 9-5 and working out the total amount of hours which lectures take up out of those total hours. For example if you have lectures for 2 hours a day they expect you to use the other 6 hours for personal study etc. which is a bit of an overestimation. You dont need to attend these lectures, as slides and notes are usually posted online to view, however you may need to attend tutorials which may be on once or twice a week. So technically you could pass the course by attending the necessary tutorials twice a week and miss out the lectures, which might be an awrite idea cause most of the lecturers are shite and boring as fuck anyway, just as long as you put in the effort yourself to learn the material your missing."

If you just plan on coming through for a class and leaving again, factoring in what folk say below about maybe eventually passing up on that as it's more hassle than it's worth, then there's a higher chance you won't stick it. Although contact time can be low, full-time degrees with all the work you're meant to put in for essays etc are precisely that: full-time. Sure, most students don't dedicate that time and manage to get by but if you're 1st year baseline is minimum, you might struggle."

glasgow,3azvp7,verygneiss,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:25:25 2015 UTC,Sounds like a variant on the 'I need 50p for my bus/train fare home' scam.
glasgow,3azvp7,afuzzyduck,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:23:15 2015 UTC,They're legit. I attended a self-employment course at a company on George Square many years ago. Something happened that basically left me with no cash to get the bus home and they gave me the token. I was so hesitant to use it because I thought the driver was going to tell me to get tae.
glasgow,3axw4t,Herner-Werzog,2,Wed Jun 24 11:25:53 2015 UTC,"There's Judo at the palace of art in bellahouston on I think a Thursday night, a few of the guys that come to bjj have trained/still train there.   Otherwise I think the university of the West of Scotland has a Judo club that might be open to non-students but they are based on Paisley. Might be worth looking at other universities too.  Great BJJ schools in Glasgow though like u/RememberedWater said, everyone says good things about the griphouse, I train at Connection Gracie Scotland in Ibrox and love it there, it's a very laid back club and has classes throughout the day which is great when you work shifts like me.   It's really a matter of trying them out and see where you are most comfortable.  Edit: Also for other grappling options there are wrestling classes (I mean like greco-roman and freestyle, not WWE) across Glasgow at MMA gyms and at wrestling clubs, I think there's one at D-Unit in Dunbarton and one in Cumbernauld, possibly one at the Emirates."
glasgow,3axw4t,_cric_,2,Wed Jun 24 15:58:23 2015 UTC,If you don't mind answering what sort of stuff goes on at the one in Ibrox? Short bus journey away and id like to join some sort of class to learn something new and also help with fitness. Pals wouldn't be interested in this sort of thing so never really had a proper chance to give it a go. Cheers!
glasgow,3axw4t,laughingseal,3,Sat Jun 27 01:48:32 2015 UTC,"Well BJJ originated as a self defence based martial art and even as it developed as a sport it focuses on using technique, leverage and body mechanics to overpower your opponents.   The classes at the academy usually start with a 15 to 20 min warm up (this can range from sport specific solo drills like forward rolls, break falls, shrimping, bridging and similar to a game of frisbee) followed by 25 to 30 min technique where we just practice two or three techniques our coach shows us with 15-20min doing positional drills or rolling (sparring) at the end.  The level of intensity varies, sometimes we drill throughout the class (higher intensity) sometime we mainly stick to technique.   We also have two classes fully dedicated to rolling (Wednesday 7pm and Saturday 11am), a class focusing on self defence (Wednesday 10am) and two conditioning classes (Wednesday 6pm, though I think this is separate and £4) and Saturday at 9am).   This is the timetable most classes run on time but you can count on the 10am classes to last longer most times.  I think the first session is free so best thing to do is come along and see if you enjoy it, most classes are with a gi (kimono) but a lot of people don't get one until they get hooked so you can just wear shorts or spats and a rashguard/T-shirt.  If you are interested in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu I definitely suggest downloading the Grapplearts Roadmap to BJJ free ebook or app, I found it very useful when I first started!"

As for in Glasgow, I hear the Bellahouston club is pretty good. If you can be bothered with the journey, the Kilmarnock club on Wednesdays is pretty good. They have this fancy lottery funded building with good mats and padded walls and stuff.  Good luck, it's a great sport and an excellent way of keeping fit."

glasgow,3aoxfq,CaptainHaggis,10,Mon Jun 22 08:46:24 2015 UTC,"OK, I've lived in Mount Florida for more than ten years, and I don't know why people can't figure this out. Here's the secret.   Park at Muirend station. Or, if you're early and it's a weekday (which AC/DC isn't) you can get away with parking around Cathcart station. These are the two stations in the other direction - not the town direction. Jump on the train for three or four minutes, and you're at Hampden. Meanwhile the 19,999 other people squeeze themselves onto a train from Central Station. When the show is over, you can walk to Cathcart in ten minutes, or to Muirend in fifteen minutes. If you're out of Hampden promptly, you can jump on a train back to your car while everybody else tries to get on one towards the town. Be aware, you will still need to wait in the queue for the station. Alternatively: Enjoy the ten minute walk to Cathcart or Muirend, and your car. Be fleeing back up the road while everybody else stands in the queue for the station, or trudges through mud to get into their car at the Queens Park recreation ground (and the subsequent traffic jam to get out of there).   PS I've got a parking permit, so I'm OK, but the traffic wardens really do put tickets on ANY car parked within the massive off-limits boundary. Don't be tempted by lots of spaces around King's Park. It'll cost you.  EDIT: Obiously this also applies if you need to get back to the town without joining that horrendous queue. Just walk on up to Cathcart or Muirend and get an empty train before it fills to bursting at Mo Flo."

glasgow,3ajjzl,RememberedWater,28,Sat Jun 20 21:33:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I read your reply to Tekha.  So, just emotional problems you have, not 'falsely-accused-of-rape-making-me-unemployable'-type of problems.  Based on what you wrote, the only blocker to employment, good social circle etc. are emotional problems. Compared to a prison sentence, this is actually easier to get rid of. Sure, it will leave a trace, as do all experiences involving (negative) emotion, but that trace will fade over time, and, ultimately, make you a better more compassionate human being in the long-term, which it sounds like you are (through not wishing to commit violent crime).  In contrast, a prison sentence leaves a paper-trail across multiple government institutions, leaving a permanent mark on your personal and professional life, making you much less employable. Yes, you will probably have a job after you get out and whatnot, but you will be confined to a very specific social circle. And would ex-cons really be the type of people you want to hang out with? And, unless you are planning to go to prison for life (which you won't by committing petty crime), these are major points, contradictory to what you actually want (a job, good friends). Having said that, I am not suggesting you commit more serious crime to go away for life...and if you are having even traces of such thoughts, seek some help and advice (even here, although I would try more popular subreddits).   Also, 25 is the new 18. For us men, it is less of a factor. We do not have a limited time window for having kids or anything like that. On a positive note, you have not mentioned having debt, so no income is better than crushing debt, so you've (possibly?) got that going for you, which is nice.  Best of luck to you at the start of your journey to rebuild yourself."

glasgow,3ajjzl,Tekha,15,Sat Jun 20 21:46:40 2015 UTC,"Buddy, I went back and read some of your post history.  I am incredibly sorry for your situation. I will never understand the depth of emotional torment somebody in your situation has to go through every day, so I apologise if my thoughts/advice below seems ignorantly oversimplified.  In my opinion, your mother is just very afraid of being alone. However, one thing is clear to me, despite how tragic her/your loss was - it is not unique, and there are people in the world who had experienced the same (or even worse). Yet, because of who they are as people, because of the decisions they made, they recovered from their loss. From what you wrote, your mother seems to have gone the opposite route, alienating herself from any possible friends, chose to instead feel sorry for herself and grieve in solitude. Which is why now she is afraid of losing you.  On your end, you are afraid of losing her, because she is the only parent you have left, and because you are an amazing compassionate person, you want to help her and feel guilty if you don't. She can not force you to feel guilt - you only feel guilty if you choose to, which you are doing, because you are compassionate.  However difficult it may be, I think you should distance yourself from her. Go get that job you were studying for. Do it in secret if you have to. All is not lost. Do not shy away from talking about this at interviews, but don't make it the sole focus. Being surrounded by her negativity, you have lost motivation and sight of the true state of affairs, objectively looking at the value you can bring as an employee, your skill set etc. If you still care to help your mother, I think getting that job would be the best way to do that.  Forgive the trivial example, but your situation, your mother's emotional abuse and this topic reminded me of Shawshank Redemption. The main focus of the movie is that you can imprison a man's body, but you can not imprison a man's will, his hope. She can not touch that if you don't let her. If I dare draw another parallel to the movie, seems to me like you are now staring down that sewer pipe full of shit, not sure whether what is on the other end is worth it. It is."

And actually, even if you allowed access to the main car parks that would be good enough for a start. I'd support going the whole hog, and having no cars in the centre for a day, but that might be a bit much for the present council to handle, so a softly softly approach might have more success.

There's a wee row of shops with a takeaway and all this which is probably the only place people will really be loitering, so just don't wander around there at night I suppose.   Good thing is that you're fairly close to luss, balloch and further afield if you have a car (or take the train) and you've also got the kilpatrick hills to take a jaunt up. You've also got Dumbarton for your shopping and clydebank shopping centre pretty close too.

glasgow,3ac85d,Saucer_Commander,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:54:48 2015 UTC,"Offshore is good, but you will have to fight for a seat with a socket. The place can be chocka with web developers and day traders, all hunched over the laptops. Standard Algies coffee, and food can be pricey. There's a Starbucks next to Hillhead Subway, with a big section upstairs, with sockets and tables."
glasgow,3ac85d,captainhollandaise,3,Fri Jun 19 21:26:18 2015 UTC,"I find coffee shops good to work in, because the distractions come and go, and the noise level is generally low. Avoid places with lots of kids, and shops with lots of hard reflective surfaces (St Enoch Centre is the worst for this, imho). Secret places? Where in the city are you?"

So on my way ""home"" from work I'd probably be jumping into St Enoch or Buchanan Subway.  Not really meaning ""secret"" places but any little cafes that might have a good atmosphere thats nice to sit in and just do some work."
glasgow,3ac85d,Sereness-the-Warlock,2,Fri Jun 19 06:38:09 2015 UTC,Local library will have both wifi and power. Also coffee shops.
glasgow,3ac85d,sartorResartus,2,Thu Jun 18 22:51:33 2015 UTC,I was thinking about just jumping into one of the Starbucks in town but wasn't sure if the amount of noise would help me or distract me. I'll try it out and if it doesn't work I'll probably just find somewhere quieter. I'm hoping for a little hidden gem.
glasgow,3ac85d,lliq,2,Thu Jun 18 23:06:43 2015 UTC,"As IIiq suggested, the icafe on sauchiehall sts a good shout, I work nearby and its clientele appear to be manly office works who pop in and out for a coffee rather than sit in. They've also got computers at the back so you don't need to bring a laptop if its only some gentle browsing action you're after."
glasgow,3ac85d,Canazza,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:26:39 2015 UTC,I'd be looking to do a bit of web development so I'd need to be taking my own laptop. I'll check out iCafe today during my lunch hour then maybe go back after work.
glasgow,3ac85d,shmeepeas,2,Fri Jun 19 06:35:58 2015 UTC,"I use headphones and have a longarse playlist of instrumental music to keep the noise from distracting me. I find if there's too much going on visually I get distracted too, but there's a Costa on West Nile St that has a bit tucked away at the back and a downstairs that I think has sockets dotted about. The Costa in St Enoch also has a wee upstairs bit that is quite distraction-free. If you want some slightly better grub than Costa offers up, then the Eat by Central has an upstairs bit with sockets, but I don't find it very comfy to work there so I tend to avoid it."
glasgow,3ac85d,bigexit,2,Fri Jun 19 11:00:20 2015 UTC,Thanks mate that's perfect. I'd do the same thing and just listen to music but as you say there would be visual distractions.
glasgow,3ac85d,weejocktiny,2,Fri Jun 19 12:02:19 2015 UTC,"No problem! There's also the upstairs bit in Nero by St Enoch subway, but I don't know what the socket situation is like. It's also pretty small so it can be hard to get a seat at peak times!"

The concept of the design is to allow a single watchman to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) inmates of an institution without the inmates being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. Although it is physically impossible for the single watchman to observe all cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that all inmates must act as though they are watched at all times, effectively controlling their own behaviour constantly. The name is also a reference to Panoptes from Greek mythology; he was a giant with a hundred eyes and thus was known to be a very effective watchman.

The bus stops generally have no useful information at all, and different bus companies use the same route numbers, yet they go to totally different places!   I am sure that our totally useless council never uses the buses.  Oh and don't expect to find the usual detailed maps of the routes online either.    How do I get around? Work out where I am going, use google maps to find the bus stop where I want to be, work out which company will take me there, sacrifice a chicken, pray to the gods and then set off.  It often works."

glasgow,3abrnf,mrchrisroden,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:01:05 2015 UTC,"?  It works in zones, when you buy one at the offices they sell them at (typically big bus/train stations), tell them which areas you're travelling to and from (or maybe around) and they'll say what zones you need. This influences how much it is, but the (two?) city centre zones will give you access to most if not all buses, the trains and also the subway."
glasgow,3abrnf,Termehh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:02:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry I should've been clearer - on the sight for it, it only lists 4 bus stops. Does it work at more than just those hubs?"
glasgow,3abrnf,mrchrisroden,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:18:15 2015 UTC,It goes by zones. So if you're inside that zone you get unlimited travel by any method of public transport operated by First.

You should visit West Brewery when you're here. They have a nice beer which is a mix of German and Scottish traditions and the restaurant isn't half bad. It's easy to get to via either the train it a walk along the river and through Glasgow Green, which is nice.

Glengoyne Distillery - The B10 bus leaves Buchanan Bus Station hourly, and takes around 55 minutes: https://goo.gl/maps/aDM9o  Auchentoshan Distillery - You can take the train from Glasgow Central Station to Dalmuir or Kilpatrick station (25 mins), and then walk from there (~20 minutes, but you'll probably want a smartphone with directions): https://goo.gl/maps/14roR  If you have a car, then there are also more interesting options further afield, but the two above are also definitely worth looking into!"
glasgow,3a3j8d,kevski82,4,Wed Jun 17 09:02:44 2015 UTC,This sounds like an awesome idea. We're not big whiskey drinkers but would be into this for sure. Wont have a car but we are pretty good at figuring out public transportation wherever we go. Thanks for the info.

glasgow,3a3j8d,spacewood,3,Wed Jun 17 16:12:26 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, West and Drygate are the decent micro-breweries around here. Brew Dog and Inn Deep are two bars that don't have a brewery attached but are owned by breweries and are both decent.  For sightseeing the tourist bus tour is actually pretty decent. Takes you round all the popular spots. I'd recommend Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Peoples Palace, and Glasgow Cathedral in particular.  Someone mentioned a distillery tour. Do that when you're in Scotland.   For food it totally depends on your budget. Burgers aplenty on the cheap side of things. Try and get some decent seafood (Scottish shellfish is fucking awesome) and a curry (my experience of curry in America was pretty disappointing.)"
glasgow,3a3j8d,randominglasgow,3,Wed Jun 17 12:33:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips. Ive heard Indian food in general is really good there. We are looking to keep the trip somewhat affordable but we're not very fancy people anyway. Burgers are fine. All of these bars serve food as well I assume?
glasgow,3a3j8d,Termehh,2,Wed Jun 17 14:12:49 2015 UTC,"Aye, Drygate and Inn Deep being the best for food, West being the worst. Not bad, just not brilliant.  [edit] in other news, Mother India Cafe is the best affordable Indian restaurant in the city for me. It might even be the best, full stop."

Get the subway from the city centre to Hillhead and spend an afternoon meandering up Byres Road. Cail Bruich is at the top and is all locally sourced food cooked in a French style with a Scottish twist.   If you are looking for cheap dinner deals then check out 5pm.com

The finnieston area is particularly good with some impressive independent restaurants and watering holes. The Park Bar is a great Scottish pub with live traditional music most nights. For something different The 78 is a bar\restaurant and on a Thursday they do a night called Dub n Grub where you can get a starter and main for £5 (vegan only food) and they play some excellent reggae. Tasty beers as well and very cheap. Ashton Lane is not far from there and there's loads of bars etc down there.   I think you'll have a good time, but if there's something in particular you'd like to see I'll happily help"

glasgow,39sp67,Busdriver84,58,Sun Jun 14 11:35:35 2015 UTC,"As a frequent user of FirstBus, I'd like to take this opportunity to tell you to go fuck yourself.  I understand that most people are pretty shitty people, but on a bus with, what, fifty people, there's normally only one or two who cause the issues that ruin things for everybody. Maybe if FirstBus were a little less concerned with running late, randomly appearing early, occasionally just skipping stops and sometimes entire buses, people wouldn't treat your service like shit.   I take a route that runs every half hour on weekends - and its a really fucking busy route because of that. Van you tell me why you decide to only send a single decker bus every half hour, then make that bus run so late you end up with two bus loads of people crammed into one shitty, old bus?"
glasgow,39sp67,PiebaldWookie,11,Sun Jun 14 12:55:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is utter bull shit. I used to have to rely on two First buses to get to work. I was late so fucking frequently because neither of them could hold a schedule. One bus would be so late that the second one would get missed and then that would arrive late, sometimes they just wouldn't appear etc etc.  It wasn't junkies, it wasn't neds, it wasn't people stinking of piss, both the busses were around the 6:30 - 7:30 mark and it was filled with people who showed their passes and tried to get to work.  If a 2:00 AM bus is late because it's filled with pissed arseholes I don't think people are complaining. But these early day time buses their is absolutely no excuse. I made 3 separate complaints on their web form none of which got a reply.  I'm not saying it's the drivers fault, frankly I have no idea but I know in this circumstance it was not the customers. And it wasn't a one off, it was consistent over the course of a year. One bus being late or not turning up is bad, but relying on the first bus to get you there for the second bus which is just as unreliable is just insane. The times I had to wake up and wait because the shitty company which does charge fucking mental prices for, can't keep to a schedule or live up to their own 'every 10 minutes' crap."

By advising that you were desperate to pick up work and ended up as a bus driver and repudiating yourself as a customer service puppet you have suggested to us all that you have made some questionable lifestyle decisions which have taken you down a career path you  neither want or enjoy.

Judging by the police presence in the centre it's prettty similar; although the banter is total shite.  The buses down here are a revelation.  Firstly, there is more than just one company servicing the routes. So that means competition for passengers.  The buses are clean (OK, maybe a bit grubby in winter) and generally speaking, well maintained. No belching black soot as they chug down the road.  Fares are probably a bit high, but still cheaper than Glasgow. If I get the bus into town, it'll take about 30-40 minutes. Cost? £2 or £3.50 if I buy a return. I was paying that for a 15 minte trip in a WorstGroup clunker about 5 years ago in Glasgow.  The buses are clean, seats comfortable, air conditioned/heated and - get this - many now have free WiFi (but you do need to tunnel over a VPN to avoid the spamverts that get embedded).  Now let's consider WorstBus's actual service. Eglinton Toll where the drivers change over. You know where the buses are, you know when the shift changes, so why the total fuck do you lot keep passengers waiting as you waddle down form the depot late? AGAIN! Seriously, get to the bus stop before it arrives.  Stop over-filling your rot-buses with diesel as well. You turn Pollockshaws Road into a skating rink by times.  WorstBus have a near monopoly in Glasgow and gouge the punters via high prices and shit service because of this. I am certianly glad I don't currently have to suffer your appaling bux service.

I like it, never had any bother.   Council tax is something you don't have to pay as a student, but you must get this sorted out quickly. Can't remember 100%, but I think for Glasgow you can get the form online, take it to your uni for them to stamp then send it/take it to the council offices.  Fees are a contentious thing at the moment. What is meant to happen by law is that there should be no upfront fees what-so-ever in Scotland. Only your deposit which gets handed over to a third party to keep safe and then a months rent in advance. That isn't to say there aren't some private renters etc that might try and screw with you. As for documentation bring anything you can, your acceptance letter for your uni and some ID should be good. In the end you'll be paying a deposit and a month in advance, probably coming in at around £800 shows them that you've got some money behind you. Some may want a reference, so if you have one bring it with you (blah blah ive known Fantalanda for x amount of years and he/she is incredibly trustworthy blah blah)  Get an inventory of everything in the flat and note all damages, get them to sign it and keep a copy yourself. Do not just take their word for it or just sign off on a random inventory in an office, ensure the inventory matches your flat. Take pictures of damages if you can.   Good luck!"

However, with regards to the 'unsafe' areas, I'd take most of it with pinch of salt. First of all £400 pcm is enough to find somewhere very decent, especially if you're looking south (Queens Park/Govanhill) or east (Dennistoun). I used to live in the south side close to Queens Park and never had a bit of bother. In fact I'd recommend the area highly along with Battlefield and Mount Florida (which are both close by), and you'd get something very reasonable for your budget as well. I know plenty of people who've lived in Dennistoun for years and again have never had any trouble; it's an area that's been gentrified over the past couple of decades and is now quite a desirable place to live.   The fact is there could be trouble in any place at any time, you just have to use your judgement and trust your gut when you visit the places you've booked a viewing at.

The guy from Grunting Growler is also Midwestern if you see him doing any pop-ups.   I'd suggest milling about Queen's Park if you're looking for an Eastown vibe. Glasgow's kind of hit-and-miss. It's hard to find that kind of ""everything in one spot"" kind of neighbourhood. I usually find that if I go to Blackfriars and drink alone I almost always end up meeting three or four people. Just find a bar you like and wait for people to hear your accent. They'll take care of the social aspect."

You may find that there are more jobs in Edinburgh though..but I'd imagine you'd find something in Glasgow if you persevered.   If you've got the entrepreneurial spirit then why does it matter how easy or hard it would be to start your own business? You'd find a way ;)  I don't live there any more sadly, but I'd go back there if I was going to have kids. I loved growing up there, and I think anyone who lives there for any amount of time develops a deep seated fondness for the city. It's great.  For fun we complain about the weather, drink and make jokes about yer maw. But seriously.. you're not far from the best countryside in the UK. Skiing, mountain biking, climbing, hiking..All that stuff is very nearby and very beautiful. And it's a vibrant, innovative city. You wouldn't struggle to find things to do and similarly minded people to do them with.  If you get Virgin Media cable, you can get up to 100mb I think. Might be higher now. And yes we have NetFlix (why would that be in doubt?)  Love Glasgow. Best city in the world. Friendly, open, often hilarious, good natured, brutally honest and easy to find yourself comfortable in. Brilliant place, despite the naysayers.  Hm. I mean.. I haven't been to Canada but friends from Canada have loved Glasgow and many have lived there for years since visiting. Many Glaswegian friends have gone to Vancouver/Montreal and never come home too, so there must be some similarity somewhere. As for other cities.. I dunno, I live in London and it's fucking shite and I miss Glasgow. Not sure what use any of that is though.  Eh..aye? I dunno? Maybe. If you're fine with -20 then I'm sure you'll survive.

Some things to be aware of: unless you're already a British/EU citizen or have ancestry, it will be very difficult to get a visa.   Second, winters here are not as cold as in Canada, but the British have not yet discovered heating or insulation either. Expect to be colder indoors than you're used to. It is also much wetter than most of Canada bar Vancouver. Gas and electric is about 3x what you pay in Canada.  It never gets hot here. You might get a couple of days that top 23-24 at the peak of summer, but expect 15-20.  Upsides? You're living in a great, fun, youthful, multicultural city. Glaswegians are the friendliest and most laid back people in Britain. There's vibrant music and nightlife. You're 30 minutes from the most beautiful wilderness and countryside. You're living in a country twice the population of Canada with access to the EU market. You can be in London in a few hours, or the rest of Europe.  Let me know if I can help you with anything!"

A lot of demand for STEM jobs at the moment, but other than that, it's just got to do with supply and demand of the job market at the time. I can't imagine you would have difficulty finding a job with a finance and marketing degree, but you might get a better job in Edinburgh or Aberdeen.   How easy is it to start your own business (I've got the entrepreneurial spirit)?   I have no idea. I'm guessing it will be as easy or as difficult as anywhere.   Is it a decent place to settle down and raise children?   Of course. Glasgow always gets a bad rep for being 'rough'. But there are plenty of nice, hospitable neighbourhoods.   What do you guys do for fun?   Well everybody does different things, as is the custom everywhere. But drinking is a very popular past time. I know few people who don't. There's plenty of pubs, bars and clubs, and the nightlife is second to none. You mentioned you liked whiskey and ales? Well some of the best in the world are crafted and sold right here.  I like bouldering (we have some great climbing centres) and mountaineering. We're at the foot of the Grampians, so there's plenty of hills/mountains nearby to explore/climb.   How fast is your internet & the general telecom speed? Do you guys have Netflix (I know, stupid question)?   Fibre is slowly getting introduced, but even on cable, you can get at east 100Mb/s; depending on your supplier.   Have you enjoyed living in Glasgow and in Scotland in general? If not, why?   Yeah, I like it. Can't complain.    If you've traveled (especially to Canada), how does Scotland compare to the rest of the places you have visited?   Sure, I've travelled. The weather is obviously the biggest factor people will mention. People are generally a lot friendlier than other places I've been too.   How cold does Scotland really get in winter? I'm used to the -20c snowy shitfest here every winter but my Scottish ex told me that even though Scotland hardly ever goes below zero, the Scottish cold is bone-chilling and ""some next level shit"". Is this true?   If that's the kind of weather you're used to, Scotland might feel relatively tropical then. We get rain most of the year, with a month of warm weather if you're lucky. Snow for a couple of months in winter, and hail/thunder/gales/ for everyday in between.  Politically, well, if you want to know more about the political climate here, I'd head over to /r/ukpolitics"

Another factor is my accent. When I tell people where I'm from and that I love Glasgow, they like to make small talk about how I must not have lived through a winter here yet."

glasgow,390qwd,jaaykidd,13,Mon Jun 8 12:10:26 2015 UTC,"In the same camp as you, live in Airdrie and commute to Edinburgh. It's not too bad to be honest. Getting the express train (which comes every 30 minutes) is well better than the normal train. Express avoids Caldercruix, Blackridge and Armadale. This saves some time and keeps the train quiet until Bathgate. From then the train gets packed and stays like this until Waverly. A monthly will run you £278 (I think). Which is probably double of that going to Glasgow but you do get to see a nice loch on the way.     Cancellations are bad. Only being doing this for a year, in that time I have had 2 cancellations due to train/line problems and the rest (half a dozen or so) have weather related. Line problems are usually solved by the time you get the replacement bus service to Bathgate. Weather problems will fuck you over though. The best thing for that is to have the scotrail app and follow them on twitter for updates.     So to conclude. It's alright."

I'm lucky that im flexi time so i don't have to be in the office for 9 am so i tend to leave around half 8 and i'm in Edinburgh (Cameron toll)  for 9.30.My office has free parking so apart from Maintenance my only cost is the the diesel roughly about £50 a week but that gets me 600 miles a week.  I contemplated moving out to Edinburgh but it didn't make sense financially. I tried the trains but after three days of standing in the rain at Carfin train station i had enough and just decided to drive in. Also gives me the flexibilty of coming and going as i please.

Flats are more affordable in Glasgow & Plus I really love my job in Edinburgh so I don't mind the travel!  The biggest con is definitely : 1 the cost of commuting... very expensive  and 2 the fact that you will need to wake up much earlier than the start of your shift and get home very late at the end of your day.

glasgow,38wzwg,sayhello_walrus,5,Mon Jun 8 15:01:52 2015 UTC,It was definetly three orange walks - but the irish republican one would have been just as annoying.  And I don't think you're wrong. But isn't there a balance between one group taking over a big central space in town one day and then the next day sending 3 marches through major parts of town - blocking off major streets and creating a lot of nuisance - or having nothing at all?  I mean the marches happened about an hour/2 hours apart so that's big areas of town unusable for cars/buses for most of the day. That's not even mentioning the fact that they often march multiple times a year.  Gaypride has a big thing once a year and they promote a very worthy cause. It'd be fine if the Orange Order (and republican marches) did the same.

I've managed to avoid the walks irl until today in town but there's no chance of avoiding them in /r/glasgow.

glasgow,38wzwg,Veloglasgow,0,Mon Jun 8 13:04:00 2015 UTC,"I dunno - I think you're being a bit short sighted go just see this as a circle jerk on reddit.  It's an issue that affects a lot of people in the Glasgow area so it's natural that people will come on here to vent. Especially after the excessive stuff this weekend. I orange walks aren't really mentiioned that much on this subreddit until recently. But it's been in response to a major event and issue. It's fair enough people want to talk about it. Don't like it? Downvote it, and up vote and submit other content.  I don't think OP sat and when the third march went past thought 'yes! Now it's time for some Karma!' More likely they were frustrated and wanted to talk to people about it."
glasgow,38wzwg,nillis,-3,Mon Jun 8 13:10:52 2015 UTC,"The thing is, people will down vote when they get sick of the repeated posts and the content doesn't add anything to the sub, in theory. In reality most upvote or downvotes based on their views of the orange lodge. There have been some intelligent posts from a few different folk in support, not of the cause, but of their right to march, etc but the hive just downvotes because it seems to contradict the prevailing view that the walks are bad because they're bigots / they disrupt traffic / they should be in a quiet park out the way / they're stuck in the past / whatever is the best argument against whichever point is made in support of their rights."
glasgow,38wzwg,Veloglasgow,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:20:08 2015 UTC,I agree with you that people shouldn't down vote posts just because they disagree with them.

Basically, it is not enough for a landlord to take your deposit and keep it in a drawer until you move out.  It needs to be placed into one of 3 government approved schemes, so your landlord cannot decide to spend it or try to hang onto it. It is held by a neutral 3rd party scheme who then repay it at the end of the tenancy.  This has been a legal requirement in scotland for a few years now, but some private landlords, especially the rent to buy crowd, still try to take your deposit and keep it themselves. Be wary, this is not legal. If they are trying that on they may well breach your rights in other ways."

As I was younger I probably dont remember the main points of the meetings, but there was secret knocks we had to remember, and, you had to pay a fee to go. A the meetings there were heads of the lodge, so to speak, they would sit up on a podium thing in front of everyone, likes judges almost. Everyone had a role. They would talk about finance/changing uniforms and colours and other pointless shit. You'd be there wearing your sash, holding a bible, listening and occasionally praying. Blablabla then sing 'God Save the Queen' . As for the marches, it was shite to be honest. As a young'n having to walk forever, it feels like, all while people are throwing eggs and what not at you. I'd say it felt the best, when everyone would go to their respective lodges and there would be a big sing song, not all sectarian as thought.

So, it is relevant, it's not like they're playing copycat or something.   That said, I should point put that I don't believe Orange walks and Republican marches (never even knew these happened in Scotland) should exist.

The people of Glasgow and Scotland are sick of their voices going unheard in relation to sectarian, hate filled orange marches. Now we have to put up with Orangefest.   We demand that GCC answer to the people of Glasgow as to why this was allowed to go ahead in a city centre location on a busy Saturday. Gordon Matheson must be held accountable.   No where in that text does it call for the event to be shut down, stopped or otherwise impeded.  The petition is to have GCC explain why the Orange Order was permitted to use public property to hold this event, rather than say one of their lodges or really anywhere that isn't the middle of Glasgow on a busy Saturday.  The Order has enough money that they can hold their event at the SECC if they chose to, but no. They have to have it in the middle of George Sq because they enjoy subjecting this city to disruption and trouble, and the council has to let them do it because... well actually no-one knows.  I want to know what those reasons are. I want to know what application process the Order had to go through and I want to know what scrutiny that application was givien before it was approved. That's why I signed it.  This knee-jerk reactionary bollocks about the ""usual suspects"" stopping Orangefest is blown up hyperbolic bullshit from the Order taking the ""we are the precious little victims"" stance.  Was it signed by people who would like to see an end to the Orange Walks (whose only purpose is to spread sectarianism, hate and misery, and to cause disruption). Yep, those folk absolutely signed it.  Was that what the petition was asking for? Nope, it fucking wasn't. It never happened and I refuse any suggestion by the Orange Order that that's what this is.  The only victims in this are the people of Glasgow who have to unwillingly put up with this bullshit."

Would we have a petition then demanding council answers about why public space is being used when they could be in the secc?   No we wouldn't.

It was nice to hear it from the point of view of someone who (even as a kid) was at the walks. But I've always wanted to read something like this from an actual member of the Orange Lodge and get their opinion. I mean - I definitely view it as bigoted and sectarian and all around hateful - but I was raised in a Catholic family so I have strong biases and it'd be good to hear from the otherside?  In any case I think orange walks and the irish republican marches (not as many, about 85% orange walks, but they still give me a red neck) because there's no point in us putting so much effort into anti-sectarian campaigns when we allow these major instigators of sectarian tension to exist."

How we can pride ourselves on being a progressive nation, which strives for equality and modernity, but we still allow people to parade their hate through our streets.    People shouldn't be celebrating religious wars, hundreds of years ago.  They shouldn't be fighting proxy battles for Irish politics.  They shouldn't be hating on others, because their family happened to take them to a different church.  As we move to be a more secular society, I'm hoping that these things will start to die out, but I fear we still have a couple of hundred years yet, before people stop bathing their children in hate.  Screaming ""no surrender,"" is redundant, when no one is bloody fighting.  When will we all just join together, in a unified front, against our true enemy, the Eskimo?

Alot of it is about government and control. Look at the strength of British identity I the walks. With the popularity of SNP, the referendum and a lot of hostility towards the nature of British government and equally fear of an independent Scotland, the support of British institutions the army etc, there's a lot to feed sectarian organisations. I hope religious aspects get taken out of things as well as the proxy war, but it's very ingrained within society and the issues everything's linked in to are still here."

People like the author rant on and on about hatred and bigotry but only ever present one side of their clearly biased story, They never mentioned the Republican parades that happen in Glasgow (like the illegal march to commemorate Maggie Thatchers death in front of the barras by a republican band named after an IRA terrorist), They don't mention the parades by Cairde na hÉireann (an organisation whose sole purpose is to perpetuate the hatred in Ireland over not having a united Irish country) who have many times courted controversy over their bigoted views.  While the examples i gave above are smaller in number and occurrence they are never spoken about by people like the author of this blog, They ignore the things they like to preach about the things they hate going on and on about the bigotry of the Orange Order while at the same time maintaining their own bigoted views, Just another example of this is the Woman who started the petition against this Saturday's event has pictures on her own facebook page at her own wedding waving a celtic supporters club scarf plastered with Irish flags all over it.  The irony of the event this weekend is that this was setup by the Orange Order over a year in as a form of community outreach to try and show people that it isn't all buckfast and shouting fuck the pope., That it's as much about Cultural heritage, Trying to teach people and show that the core of the Orange Order isn't some rotten front for the UVF with some good bands on show it could be a good thing to listen to, But it's all been dragged into the papers because of the bandwagon bigotry.  Another thing that's always spouted about here is the cost to the council, When in fact the Orange Order have out of their own pocket paid for everything including a event security company and have said they will restrict the amount of people allowed into George Square.  Ultimately it only takes up George Square 7hrs on a Saturday with a short half hour or so parade at the end of it, It's not the end of the world, George Square isn't exactly in the Centre of Buchanan Galleries, There's not much in the way of shops or bars that people visit in George Square it doesn't intrude that much on people, All these people ranting on facebook about how they won't be going to Glasgow on Saturday were probably never going to be in Glasgow in the first place and feel that it's their duty to voice that they are offended by something that isn't happening anywhere near them."

glasgow,38j7ya,Eightbit52,6,Fri Jun 5 00:07:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to say that pointing out that there are other groups preaching hate, doesn't negate the fact that a lot of what the orange order do, is preach hate.  When your songs have ""up to our knees in fenian blood"" as a lyric, and you are singing it to commemorate a time when your ancestors were killing Catholics, then you may be, to some extent a hate group.  There isn't any need for the orange order.  Protestants aren't persecuted.  By the same token, there is no need for a similar Catholic organisation.  All things like the orange order do, is draw a line.  We are this, you are that.  Stay back.  In the interests of fairness, I'll disclose though, that I don't have a dog in this fight.  I was raised Jewish, and I'm an atheist by choice."
glasgow,38j7ya,therealbighairy,-2,Fri Jun 5 00:13:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not pointing it out to try and negate it, I'm pointing that all these people ranting on blogs and facebook are carrying their own bigotry and hatred while ranting about bigotry and hatred.

As above I don't have a dog in the fight, but I object to what I've watched happen in and around orange walks that I've seen for the last 25 years. No amount of ""community outreach"" will resolve that because the very core of the organisations beliefs are about segregation and hatred."

There you go jumping to assumptions, You're just like the author of this article automatically jumping on the hate/bigotry bandwagon without even a second thought as to wonder if you're going to look like a bigoted clown yourself.  For your information i was raised Jewish in Glasgow (though i would now identify myself as an Atheist), Lived in Glasgow my whole life, Never cared about neither Celtic or Rangers, I just like to see the story from both sides rather than from one side shouting about bigotry while displaying the very same bigotry they were just shouting about.  You just proved my point for me though, Rather than put even the slightest amount of thought into what you were going to type you just automatically assume that i am what you want to hate.

They've been brainwashed from birth with this shit and it can be near impossible for them to get an objective viewpoint.

Your post ( on a month old account no less) reads like a series of O.O talking points and you posted a link to the petition starters facebook page (who's been getting death threats btw), so yeah you got me - I presumed you were from the lodge.

Go to a chippy and order a half pizza crunch supper, a single sausage and an irn - bru for lunch. Or a Gyro from the Greek place at the top of Buchanan Street. Talk to folk, go see live music, go to Xscape. If all else fails there will be something on at the Wallace Street Flats. Enjoy!"

glasgow,38ceg5,hamericanhorrorstory,4,Wed Jun 3 08:53:57 2015 UTC,"It depends entirely on the age and type of equipment. If they are electric storage heaters then once they are hot they should radiate heat for a while.  When it comes to cost though, it's more down to how you use it. When you enter the flat set the timer for when you actually need it. Also if you're not the ground floor then you'll get heat from those below you.  In your first two weeks play with the timer until you get it just right, also remember that you ""shouldn't"" really need heating during summer months."
glasgow,38ceg5,Smithy566,3,Wed Jun 3 09:12:07 2015 UTC,"If it's storage heaters, they'll only use night-time rate electricity, and after heating up overnight, will be hot all day without using more electricity.  If it's ""instant"" electric heaters, you'll be paying the daytime electricity tariff, so costs will be considerably higher than electric storage, and which in itself is probably ""a bit"" higher than gas central heating.  Source: No gas in our street, previous owner had ripped out electric storage heaters and replaced with electric heaters, we did the opposite and are back on storage heaters."

Considering I use leccy for everything (heating, cooking as well as ample TV and computer use) I don't think that's too bad."

The government is here to facilitate these things, not to decide which causes are going to be allowed or not, regardless of how objectionable the majority of people find something. We don't have to agree with what someone believes or says, but we should all support their right to say it."

glasgow,38abye,Veloglasgow,2,Wed Jun 3 12:51:09 2015 UTC,Haha just commenting on the reasonableness of your comment. Don't tend to find that much around here.
glasgow,38abye,TheMeanderer,3,Wed Jun 3 15:27:19 2015 UTC,"The government is here to facilitate these things, not to decide which causes are going to be allowed or not   While that sounds lovely, in reality the council is expected to balance the rights of people to process against the impact on retail, leisure, tourism and transport, while taking into account the risk of public disorder, costs of policing and feedback from city residents.  This is specifically covered by the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006.  This is not in opposition to people's rights to say what they like, and I, as you, support that. What I do not support, and see as at all proportionate, is their right to take over - and close off - the public areas of centre of the city for the whole of a busy Saturday with the almost certain public disorder that is likely to arise as a result."
glasgow,38abye,meepmeep13,2,Wed Jun 3 15:49:59 2015 UTC,"I don't remember similar complaints when the Christmas carnival took over the square for a month, or when the yes campaign adopted it as a focal point...lets not try and pretend this petition is for any reason other than the perception that the group involved in organising this event are seen as objectionable by the majority."
glasgow,38abye,Veloglasgow,4,Wed Jun 3 16:01:43 2015 UTC,"There's been loads of complaints to the council about the Christmas and Valentines carnivals. And loads of complaints about the Yes campaigns.  But there is a fundamental difference here in that the seasonal events are non-exclusive and intended to be for all residents, whereas this is a closed minority event on behalf of a group who already have a huge number of events occupying the public spaces and police time of the city over more than a month each year.  If the Yes campaign was holding their events through the city centre with anything like the same regularity then I'm sure people would be equally as pissed.  Can someone explain why, exactly, OrangeFest needs to be held in George Square? Sectarian wankers have the right to be sectarian wankers. They do not have the right to turn large sections of our city into sectarian wanking zones for the whole of June and July each year."
glasgow,38abye,meepmeep13,3,Wed Jun 3 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain why it shouldn't be held in George Square, other than the fact that they're ""sectarian wankers"". I actually, for once, like the councils wording on this:  ""People use George Square and other public spaces around Glasgow for a wide range of events and activities.  ""Providing events are properly planned and do not encourage unlawful behaviour, the council is not permitted to simply ban them on the grounds that someone dislikes, opposes or holds contrary views to the organiser."""
glasgow,38abye,Veloglasgow,5,Wed Jun 3 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"My point was that OrangeFest isn't just a small event, it's going to completely fuck up the city centre for the whole of Saturday.  It's not about contrary views, it's about the stuff I listed upthread.  Will this disrupt public order? Yes.  Will this use up a disproportionate amount of police time? Yes.  Will this impact retail? Yes.  Will this impact transport? Probably.  Will this impact tourism? Absolutely.  These are all things the council is meant to take into account when deciding whether to licence a procession or event. There is no way any disinterested body could decide that the representation of this already heavily-represented group through OrangeFest is, on balance, worth the disruption it will cause.  The council can say what they like - the legislation I linked to makes it clear it is their responsibility to make such decisions."
glasgow,38abye,meepmeep13,2,Wed Jun 3 16:22:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't want to look like I'm a sympathiser with the orange lodge, I'm far from it. But the fact they have enough supporters that their event isn't a small affair is irrelevant. They have the same right to use the space as anyone else, it will rightly be facilitated and they'll pay for the majority of the security."
glasgow,38abye,Veloglasgow,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"What if they wanted to hold OrangeFest every saturday, 52 weeks a year? What if they wanted to use George Square 24/7/365 for Lodge events? What if Cairde na hÉireann wanted to hold a big event in George Square this Saturday too? Do you think the council should remain disinterested and permit anything anyone wants?   Personally, if OrangeFest was the only public event the lodge held, I would be happy with it going ahead. I've said before I think we should give them one day a year where they can march around as much as they like, wherever they like and toot their bigotwhistles to their hearts' content, on the proviso they shut the fuck up the other 364."
glasgow,38abye,meepmeep13,4,Wed Jun 3 16:57:28 2015 UTC,"They don't want to have it every weekend though, why even ask that? As far as I can see this is their first ever request for this and you're getting so upset about it?"
glasgow,38abye,Veloglasgow,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:08:34 2015 UTC,"Because this is in addition to the 6 continuous weeks of marching that we already get every year, along with all the other one-off events throughout the year. We already have too much of this. It's simply not proportionate to the modern day size and importance of the lodge to the present-day population of Glasgow, and actively makes the city a worse place to live."
glasgow,38abye,meepmeep13,0,Wed Jun 3 17:16:34 2015 UTC,Christmas carnivals and hate marches. Good comparison you've got going there.
glasgow,38abye,Sh405,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:46:36 2015 UTC,"You're completely missing the point. Just because a cause is not supported by most of us doesn't mean they should be marginalised and prevented from using public space.  Imagine our city voted in an ultra conservative (small c) council who decided that nobody could gather in support of gay rights because the vast majority aren't gay, or that nobody could march in support of the rights of asylum seekers because they're a minority. Pro-palestine? Tough luck, most folk don't care so shut up.  That's not how we want things to be is it?   Public space isn't just there for causes that most of us enjoy or believe in. That's why I made the comparison of the most popular use of the square with the most controversial."

No against the Orange Order, don't get why they'd want to do what they do but fair play to them. Don't know if it's such a great comparison, but it's like the people who subscribe to r/atheism, the minority might be sound, even the majority, but it's the vocal minority of fuckwits who ruin it for everyone else. Imho this organisation has had an uninformed group latch onto them and drag them down, to the point where its impossible for people to even care to differentiate. I think for most people opposed it's Orange Walk = scummy cunts who profess to follow a religion but just use it as an excuse.

Considered just closing for the day but don't want to lose a days takings if I can help it. Getting home is going to be legitimately dangerous. I'd be getting on the subway not long after the party finishes in George Square - subway on a saturday is bad enough with football fans and stag parties and it's a rare saturday I get all the way home without experiencing or at least witnessing some kind of harrassment - not looking forward to this at all."

You could probably get in from Bell Street, or nearabouts, just up from where the track passes over Glasgow Cross.

glasgow,37hkzu,ossetepo,1 point,Wed May 27 22:25:10 2015 UTC,"Oh okay. If it was me, I would give myself 2 hours to get from Edinburgh to Glasgow on the bus. You probably don't need that but when I took the bus from Glasgow - Edinburgh airport it was around that time due to traffic. If you can afford the train then it might be best to go with that. It's exactly 1 hour (although they are doing stuff with the line right now so you should check for delays). You can get a joint rail ticket with the airport bus from the ticket office I believe. You might want  to research that.  I've only taken the Bus from Glasgow airport to the city centre and it took around 40 minutes due to traffic.   So: 1pm Bus or 2pm train in Edinburgh. Arrive at 3, head to Buchanan bus station/designated stop to catch airport bus. Arrive for 4pm check in.   I suggest checking over time tables and making sure you have enough time for connections and delays.  If you want lunch, give yourself at least another hour or so. Nothing worse than slow table service when you're in a hurry."

glasgow,37h6ag,Boseth,5,Wed May 27 18:21:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up man. Emailed the guy the other night and he told me that an introductory class was a tenner whereas other places are free so a felt like asking about Cheers again mate saved me a good bit of money.
glasgow,37h6ag,Termehh,2,Wed May 27 19:35:56 2015 UTC,I've been going for 8/9 months now and never experienced this. The assistant coaches take all the fundamentals classes and he takes the classes for blue belts and above. He's actually a really nice guy and the assistant coaches are cracking.  One of my mates at the gym who is tiny just beat 2 guys MUCH taller than him in his division in both Gi and No-Gi in Edinburgh not too long ago.

glasgow,37h6ag,loosebruce,3,Mon Jun 1 16:03:16 2015 UTC,"I use Gracie Barra to do Martial arts.  Despite it having cold and spartan like facilities, the important things like the Gym floor and the equipment all work as intended. For me I just go there do my thing then leave and it is in a easy location, so for me it is perfect.  p.s. they just redone the soft floors in the sparring area."
glasgow,37h6ag,TeamBAWS,3,Fri May 29 13:41:44 2015 UTC,"If you're looking city centre then I can whole heartedly recommend Royce Gracie Jiu Jitsu Scotland. They have a fitted out unit in the Southside (2 min walk from Ibrox tube station with plenty of parking). The coach, Scott McVeigh is a really sound guy and a great instructor.  Is it Scottish Hit Squad in Whifflet you are at just now? I've heard good things about that gym too."
glasgow,37h6ag,Ward88,3,Wed May 27 19:49:21 2015 UTC,"I say going, I've been whenever I could afford it! The guys there are class and I've known some of the instructors since their first fights. But the gym's 2 busses from me and there's nae bus between 9-10 pm and that's when the beginners classes are on. Whereas I could get to GB in the same amount of time it'd take me to get there on one bus, and I wouldn't need to worry about transfers etc."

glasgow,37h6ag,_cric_,1 point,Wed May 27 22:39:32 2015 UTC,Aw right sorry pal. Aye a cannae find a website for the either.
glasgow,37h6ag,fiverbitahash,1 point,Wed May 27 22:44:28 2015 UTC,Never met the GB Glasgow folks myself but it does seem to have a bad rep across the Scottish bjj community (just ask in the Scottish bjj Facebook group) - I train at the academy in Ibrox and would definitely recommend training with Scott. The schedule is 7am Monday and Wednesday - 10am Monday Wednesday (self defence) and Thursday - 6pm Monday and Friday - 6:30pm NoGi and 7:30pm Gi on Tuesdays - 6pm conditioning and 7pm sparring on Wednesdays and Saturday morning is 9am conditioning (at the stairs in kelvingrove) 10am technique and 11am rolling.  Edit: spelling
glasgow,37h6ag,ComicalAli,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:35:29 2015 UTC,"The academy site is down just now as getting redone, Scott has classes on in Ibrox at 7am Monday and Wednesday - 10am Monday Wednesday (self defence) and Thursday - 6pm Monday and Friday - 6:30pm NoGi and 7:30pm Gi on Tuesdays - 6pm conditioning and 7pm sparring on Wednesdays and Saturday morning is 9am conditioning (at the stairs in kelvingrove) 10am technique and 11am rolling."
glasgow,37h6ag,rubthemtogether,2,Wed Jun 3 09:32:22 2015 UTC,7am classes? you have my attention....  what time does the class finish? Are these classes open mat or taught technique? If technique in the gi or nogi? Are there showering facilities?
glasgow,37h6ag,wallbanged,2,Wed Jun 10 15:07:58 2015 UTC,"The 7am classes are taught by our black belt/academy owner Scott, it's with the gi tho if you don't have one it's fine, and should finish at 8am. Scott had a tendency to keep going a bit longer but if you've got work you are OK to just leave, it's a very relaxed club like that.  There are two showers at the academy so there might be a slight queue but the guys are usually quite fast. Not made it to 7am in some time but it's usually a mix of technique, drills and rolling. Sometimes he throws in some kettle bell work if it's an odd number of people so there's not too much hanging around.  He teaches all classes himself apart from the Wednesday conditioning at 6pm and the rolling on Wednesday at 7pm & Saturday at 11am - he only gets someone else to teach if he's away at any point, for instance when he went to train with Rickson in LA for a week last year, and it's only purple belts and above allowed to teach when he's away (though is quite rare).   Edit: spelling - also the club is now officially renamed as Connection Gracie Jiu Jitsu Scotland, we are now affeliated with Rickson."
glasgow,37h6ag,Termehh,2,Wed Jun 10 16:20:57 2015 UTC,would not recommend it in all fairness the team have won a lot of BJJ medals people there do know what they are talking about in regards to BJJ but isnt managed very well classes being cancelled black belt instructor leaving classes to be taught by students who dont appear to be gettin paid for it as you are paying to be taught by the head instructor who isnt teaching ? went for year and a half and in that time saw people much more skilled and experienced than myself not being awarded promotions and people who had been there for very short time and not very skilled surpassing more experienced students overall there are a lot better gyms out there

glasgow,37gydm,mmccread,23,Wed May 27 15:39:58 2015 UTC,If you get Megabus or Scotrail you have to go into Edinburgh before heading through to Glasgow.  There's a Citylink service directly from Edinburgh airport that takes you straight to Glasgow. I'd go with that.
glasgow,37gydm,kevski82,9,Wed May 27 15:42:55 2015 UTC,Wonderful!  That didn't come up in my searches.  It looks great.  Thanks!
glasgow,37gydm,CrapManManCrap,7,Wed May 27 16:09:08 2015 UTC,"Literally used it this week, its great, and you can buy tickets for the same price as the online rate directly from the driver. Saves so much time not going into Edinburgh."
glasgow,37gydm,ohmephisto,2,Wed May 27 17:32:51 2015 UTC,"I take that bus all the time, it's great. Just remember to bring cash to buy the ticket from the driver!"
glasgow,37gydm,Lord21K,6,Thu May 28 08:18:17 2015 UTC,"I've used the Citylink coach a few times, would definitely recommend."
glasgow,37gydm,spiz,18,Wed May 27 16:08:18 2015 UTC,It should be renamed to Scotrain from this moment onwards.
glasgow,37gydm,AidanSmeaton,4,Wed May 27 15:44:30 2015 UTC,That's what we should call the weather. It's supposed to be almost summer...
glasgow,37gydm,AidanSmeaton,2,Wed May 27 17:08:13 2015 UTC,"Oops!  I was thinking train, not rail.  Who knows?"
glasgow,37gydm,ggow,5,Wed May 27 16:06:40 2015 UTC,"If you're trying to save money, take the Citylink bus from Edinburgh airport to Buchanan St Bus Station in Glasgow. However, beware that if there are traffic jams (and there usually are in morning rush hour), this could take longer than scheduled. I got caught in a traffic jam once and it took me three hours to get home (longer than my flight).  For ease, you can get the tram directly from Edinburgh airport to Haymarket train station, and then the train to Glasgow Queen St. It should take about an hour."
glasgow,37gydm,CrazyWelshGuy,1 point,Wed May 27 16:00:09 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the train, but am concerned about the construction planned this summer."
glasgow,37gydm,ggow,3,Wed May 27 16:05:37 2015 UTC,The Glasgow-Edinburgh route is essential and they won't reduce the service at peak times. Most work happens on Sundays or in the evenings.  Edit: Apparently that's not true. I can't believe the disruption these upgrades will cause! I'd take the bus...
glasgow,37gydm,CrazyWelshGuy,5,Wed May 27 16:11:23 2015 UTC,"This isn't true at all, I'm afraid. As part of electrification works they need to lower track bed in one of the tunnels on the main line between E&G. The service between the two cities, on that line, will be severely disrupted. The other three (slower) lines will be mobbed as a result and coaches etc. will be necessary for some journeys.   http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/commuters-face-worst-rail-disruption-in-decades-1-3784136  Ordinarily I'd say the tram and then the train would be best but a) the bus from the airport is actually quite good quality and b) the trains will be much worse quality than is usual."
glasgow,37gydm,AidanSmeaton,3,Wed May 27 16:27:42 2015 UTC,Sorry did you just mention Scotrail and quality in the same sentence ? And anyway I thought the work was being done on the line via Falkirk and though the other lines may be busier they are increasing frequency of service to essentially cancel out the delay  I may be wrong though
glasgow,37gydm,Fiascopia,2,Wed May 27 16:34:06 2015 UTC,"Scotrail and quality in the same sentence   They're not perfect but try some of the rail services put on in England and Wales before you judge them too harshly. Scotland's cities are very lucky compared to what is common place in Northern England.    they are increasing frequency of service to essentially cancel out the delay I may be wrong though   The lines are all much slower, and it's simply not possible to increase the capacity on the other lines to take up all the passengers that ordinarily use the busiest line in the Scotland. They'll do their best I'm sure but it's going to be a quite miserable two months for commuters relying on that line (it should be worth it though)."
glasgow,37gydm,remurdered909,2,Wed May 27 16:41:08 2015 UTC,Good to know and I know they arnt all that bad but communiting from Blairhall to Paisley everyday does take its toll on my patience for Scotrail

glasgow,37gydm,sean0507,2,Wed May 27 17:27:03 2015 UTC,I'd always take the Citylink bus from Edinburgh Airport to Glasgow for minimum hassle and the fact that it's a tenner a pop.
glasgow,37gydm,macdangerous,1 point,Wed May 27 18:54:24 2015 UTC,"Quite honestly, the best bet is a train. It's quick, more pleasant and costs £12.50 off peak. You can catch a taxi to Edinburgh Park and the train from there to Glasgow. A taxi to the station costs about £10, which is the same as a tram for 2 and you don't need to get to the station etc."
