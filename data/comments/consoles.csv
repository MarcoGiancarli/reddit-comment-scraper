consoles,3e3xan,SuperNanoCat,12,Tue Jul 21 19:41:09 2015 UTC,Nope. Welcome to Kickstarter.
consoles,3e3xan,bongo1138,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:40:52 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, how many people do you think supported that game specifically for the Wii U?"
consoles,3e3xan,klorptar,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:06:51 2015 UTC,"Probably more than most games, but the install base of Wii U is about 10m. Racing games are already pretty niche,  and on a niche console with a pretty causal audience... this was absolutely a sound business move."
consoles,3e3xan,bongo1138,6,Wed Jul 22 05:20:55 2015 UTC,Bullshit.
consoles,3e3xan,Kinectivity_RBLX,2,Tue Jul 21 20:02:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah completely, let's forget the time the developer said the Wii U version was coming along nicely. Of course with the announcement of Project Cars 2. It's hard to believe Slightly Mad gives a crap about their reputation."

consoles,3e3xan,corbygray528,2,Tue Jul 21 21:52:17 2015 UTC,Wii U is a weak console.
consoles,3e3xan,Seirf,3,Tue Jul 21 22:57:31 2015 UTC,"If they can put San Andreas on a phone, they can port project cars to the Wii u."
consoles,3e3xan,corbygray528,3,Wed Jul 22 00:41:32 2015 UTC,Smartphones are stronger then a PS2 nowadays. Project cars for the wii u would look like the Wii port of dead rising. Absolutely terrible. It's a great console but Project Cars is just to much for the weak console. They probably thought of going 480p or 800x600 for acceptable framerates.
consoles,3e3xan,Seirf,2,Wed Jul 22 00:49:23 2015 UTC,"Dead rising: Chop to you drop didn't look that bad on the wii.  3rd party games don't sell well on the wiiu,that probably their main decision for them dropping out. Not the Framerate or resolution.  Forza Horizon Xbox 360  Project Cars PS4"
consoles,3e3xan,GourmetLeaf,3,Wed Jul 22 05:54:44 2015 UTC,"The Wii u touchpad would've made a lot of sense with this game, oh well."
consoles,3e3xan,keeb119,2,Tue Jul 21 22:54:29 2015 UTC,They had previous said they couldn't hit and stay above 20fps and finding more ways to find performance is looking really expensive (rewrite engine?)  Devs got pretty antagonistic on their forums when Wii owners started complaining though.
consoles,3e3xan,silix2015,0,Wed Jul 22 00:31:57 2015 UTC,"Not a huge surprise.  I can see that the Wii-U has weaker hardware and that it'd be a lot of work to put out as good a version as they'd have like to.  I can see that this would be a lot of time and money cost to develop.  I can see that it wouldn't sell nearly as many copies as most people mad on racing games will probably have one or more of PC/One/PS4 where they could already buy the game (it is on PC, I assume?).  And I can see how all added up they came to this conclusion.  Not a surprise, but a great shame. :("

consoles,3dzmol,gordallott,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:58:32 2015 UTC,You don't have to preorder it and you don't have any obligation to buy it. I got a 6 hour trial of Dragon Age and never preordered it and didn't end up buying it.

consoles,3dzmol,higmage,6,Tue Jul 21 00:19:05 2015 UTC,Sony had the opportunity to allow EA Access on PS4 and they said no. Complain to them.
consoles,3dzmol,Call_erv_duty,-6,Tue Jul 21 10:28:38 2015 UTC,"Personally, EA access is still a worthless waste of money."
consoles,3dzmol,louiscool,4,Tue Jul 21 12:22:23 2015 UTC,How?
consoles,3dzmol,dan0314,-5,Tue Jul 21 12:49:34 2015 UTC,Paying a monthly sub to get access to a few games is a ripoff. Plain and simple.  Unless you only play EA games then more power to you.
consoles,3dzmol,louiscool,4,Tue Jul 21 13:20:58 2015 UTC,It's $30 a year for unlimited access to games that are still ~$40 - $50
consoles,3dzmol,dan0314,4,Tue Jul 21 13:23:56 2015 UTC,But those games have to be worth it to a person. It's a good deal but not for someone like me who doesn't like most of what EA puts out.
consoles,3dzmol,Streetfoldsfive,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:51:56 2015 UTC,"It's $5 per month to play a handful of sports games, Need for Speed, BF4 and Titanfall.  Pardon me if I don't jump for joy, but none of these games on EA access are even the CURRENT iteration of their series except Fifa and Madden and they are almost a full year old at this point and you can OWN either game for less than the subscription cost....  EA isn't providing quality games to their paid service, why are you paying for it?"
consoles,3dzmol,louiscool,2,Tue Jul 21 13:34:53 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to pay $5 a month if you can pay $30 for a year. It's worth it to me for Titanfall, FIFA and BF4 alone."
consoles,3dzmol,dan0314,2,Tue Jul 21 13:36:36 2015 UTC,"I don't subscribe to it, but knowing how much EA sports games cost when they're released versus how much those same titles cost nine months later, $30 is a hell of a deal."
consoles,3dzmol,sec713,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:24:11 2015 UTC,"Titanfall is 10 dollars in a bin somewhere, BF4 is 15.  If you wanted to play either game at release, you couldn't with EA Access, because they didn't offer them.  Again, it's not worth it.  Additionally, you are paying for a full year without knowing if the service will get better or worse.  You essentially buy the worst season pass in gaming."
consoles,3dzmol,louiscool,3,Tue Jul 21 13:40:47 2015 UTC,"The only games I buy at release are games I know I will love, EA Access is worth it to me personally for the games it does have on there"

consoles,3dzmol,dan0314,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:14:29 2015 UTC,It's in the game.
consoles,3dzmol,DoobieDoctor5000,2,Tue Jul 21 13:34:00 2015 UTC,"Completely disagree. You get unlimited access to a bunch of games, plus you get discounts and early access trials to other EA games. Just based on the games you get access to plus the discounts I'd say it's worth it even if you're interested in only a couple EA games. I don't play their sports titles but its still 100% worth it to me."
consoles,3dzmol,ReclaimerDC,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:49:35 2015 UTC,"It's most definitely NOT worth it.  Fuck, they don't even have Hardline on that service yet and Hardline is on sale everywhere for 40 bucks.  Early Access Trials? You mean you get to pay for demos!? SIGN ME UP!  I remember when demos were free, and companies tried to get our business instead of convincing customers we were lucky for theirs.  Keep paying them to rent last year's games.  I'll continue to buy them at launch then sell them and make 40 bucks back."
consoles,3dzmol,louiscool,3,Tue Jul 21 15:17:58 2015 UTC,"It's a bit different from a demo since you get access to the entire full game. It's a nice try before you buy.  And you may not think it's worth it, but you get a lot of games for that $30.  The biggest perk for me, on top of everything, are the discounts you get. I buy my games digitally. I can understand if you prefer physical games to not do this, but as for me and a lot of other people digital is the way to go. The discounts alone almost pay for the service after buying a few games.   It's fine if YOU don't like the service and prefer physical media, but for this who have a digital game library its a really great service."
consoles,3dzmol,ReclaimerDC,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"I do a mix of digital and physical.  Like Dragon Ball Xenoverse was a definite Physical copy because I knew I would get bored and want to sell it, but Bloodborne was digital.  I think it would be a great service if they would add new games.  The omission of Hardline is such a bad move imo."
consoles,3dzmol,louiscool,2,Tue Jul 21 15:43:24 2015 UTC,$30 a month including new games wouldn't be a feasible business model though
consoles,3dzmol,ReclaimerDC,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:47 2015 UTC,Hardline is almost a year old though...
consoles,3dzmol,louiscool,2,Tue Jul 21 16:05:06 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Hardline will be eventually. I mean, they added Dragon Age which is great. Battlefield is their big shooter franchise though, so I doubt they'll ever have the newest one available for free."
consoles,3dzmol,ReclaimerDC,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"What the fuck? Hardline came out on March 17, 2015, no where near a year ago. You're shitting all over this thread because a game that came out FOUR months ago isn't free on the service yet?"

I would say it's a tie for the 2 worst... The SuperGrafx and Neo Geo.  Both were excellent systems but the Supergrafx had a total of 5 games and the Neo Geo games were SUPER expensive.

They just broke all the time.   It's the controller design that makes it the worst. What's sad/funny is that the 2600 had the worst joystick before that. It was too stiff and the hat came off too easily. Then they had the 5200 which was sloshy, broke and the rubber hat would wear out instead of coming off. The buttons would stop working and get mushy. It was a needlessly complicated design that lends more towards people who enjoy an adventure than people who just want to get it done when it comes to repairs.   I remember as a kid going to up Irvine or Fountain Valley to get thumbsticks put on my Intellivision and some 5200 controllers repaired and thinking this guy was gonna make a lot of money on the 5200 controllers. What a disaster."
consoles,3dy2o5,hanz333,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:57:46 2015 UTC,"Atari 5200 had the first real digital pots on a controller, and it was nothing but a mess.  I love some of the games, Real Sports Soccer is a blast, but the traces on the controller are so prone to breaking that it's almost impossible to use the machine reliably.  Much better to buy a Atari 800 which is compatible with the 5200 games but with a standard joystick port."

It's understandable to not want to buy the Wii u, but asking for Nintendo games to go multiplat just seems like an excuse for the lack of new exclusives so far on the ps4/xb1."
consoles,3dy2o5,bongo1138,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:16 2015 UTC,You're gonna miss out on a lot. Nintendo's recent releases on the Wii U has been the best software they've put out in a very long time.
consoles,3dy2o5,bman1394,2,Mon Jul 20 21:12:08 2015 UTC,"Sure, their SOFTWARE is extraordinary, but they're consoles are, to put it lightly, embarrassing.   There's a reason that virtually all major third parties have stopped supporting the Wii U. At this point, they'd have to develop another version to be able to MAYBE have it run on the Wii U.   And Nintendo seems so completely out of touch. They should've realized why the Wii sold so well, and who to. Grandma isn't going to buy the follow up to the Wii, so they should've ditched that idea and said ""Let's double down on the gamer."" Sony has and look how that's done for them.   I PRAY the NX is either a.) more powerful than the PS4/X1 (doubtful) or b.) The last console that Nintendo ever makes."
consoles,3dy2o5,bongo1138,2,Mon Jul 20 21:17:15 2015 UTC,"3rd parties not supporting Nintendo is nothing new and the Wii U is hardly the blame for that. Whether it be Capcom using the term ""exclusive"" very loosely (Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Revelations ported to other systems after claiming ""exclusivity to Nintendo consoles [Rockstar has also done this with Grand Theft Auto: China Town Wars]), EA giving gimped or unfavorable ports of games (Kidified version of Madden for Wii, Mass Effect 3 for Wii U at $60 when Mass Effect Trilogy was released for Xbox 360/PS3 for $40), companies backing out of exclusivity deals (Rayman Legends, Deus Ex: Human Revolution), companies knowlingly creating exlcusivity deals with botched software or inadequate time and planning for the games (Sega and Sonic Boom) or the biggest one of all, Square Enix dropping support of Nintendo back in the 90's during the unveil of the Nintendo 64.  There's a bigger issue here than the consoles not being powerful enough. Some of the best games for Nintendo systems were made by 3rd parties on weaker hardware (No More Heroes on Wii, Bayonetta 2 on Wii U, Monster Hunter Series on 3DS, Shin Megami Tensei on 3DS). Nintendo having hardware as powerful as the contenders is not going to help them. This isn't the early 90's where there biggest competition were other video game companies. Nintendo's competitors are large multi-million dollar companies that have outside resources from a larger parent company. Microsoft can afford to lose money on each system sold and still throw money at exclusives all day and still not hurt financially. Hell even, Sony, with having business in TV, computers, phones, home and portable media still took some serious financial damage when the PS3 was selling due to losing money on each console sold. Nintendo's biggest marketing tactic is making money off of each console sold and making money from their first and second party development studios while the other competitors rely largely on third party markets. Quite honestly, the Wii U is Nintendo's most hardcore system since the gamecube, and despite the Gamecube having powerful hardware at the time it sold like ass. Nintendo going for Super powerful hardware at this point is suicide. 3rd parties aren't coming back. They made that point apparent since the Nintendo 64 days."
consoles,3dy2o5,bman1394,0,Mon Jul 20 21:40:45 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is that Nintendo shouldn't bother with hardware? Agreed.
consoles,3dy2o5,bongo1138,2,Mon Jul 20 22:11:29 2015 UTC,That's...that's not what I'm saying at all. I'm saying Nintendo shouldn't bother with having super powerful hardware that is trying to one up their competition. I think they should stick to cheap efficient hardware because third parties outside of exculivity deals are not coming back.
consoles,3dy2o5,bman1394,0,Mon Jul 20 22:15:30 2015 UTC,But even that's proving unsuccessful with the Wii U. It's a colossal failure.
consoles,3dy2o5,ProbablyHighAsShit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:44 2015 UTC,"Nintendo made mistakes with the Wii U, but that's nothing that can't be solved with some revisions to the core concept. The biggest problem with the Wii U's price tag was the gamepad costing roughly $100 to manufacture and produce. If Nintendo can get the sweat spot in price (which would require weaker components than it's competitors) and continued awesome first party support in their next console it will sell like hotcakes."

Plus Nintendo has been very proactive lately by establishing deals with Universal for a Nintendo Theme Park, they are slowly making their way into the mobile market and there are rumors of tv show/movie deals. Nintendo's plan as of late is brand recognition. They are aiming to be any and everywhere and all those areas (theme parks, mobile, media entertainment) are all avenues of advertisement for their video game products. So yes they can survive on 1st party software, given that they are preparing for a more massive widespread appeal of all their products."

I got a couple of games, but I expected it to be so much more and the battery compartment just wouldn't properly close.  Least used would be PS3, because I erroneously thought the Final Fantasy series would be Sony when my friends had 360's so that was my primary console at the time. I played it for a few exclusives, but it really wasn't my primary console (and I really don't like that .00023 ounce controller).  Also arguably least used would be Wii. Got into the initial hype and got tired of sports/bowling pretty quickly.  Worst in terms of hardware would be 360, since I had to buy (&%^ 3 of them.

People who aren't the biggest gamers will prefer the older games they played before.

Wii U doesn't really have that many exclusive couch co-op games. These are all the titles I can think of:   Mario Kart New Super Mario Bros U Super Mario 3D World Yoshi's Wooly World Hyrule Warriors   That is not a very long list if you think about how much it has been recommended by everyone else in this thread. The other consoles don't have a lot of couch games, but by just being way more popular than Wii U they end up with more couch co-op games - the multiplatform co op games rarely get ported to Wii U. Here are some games that offer couch co-op on the other consoles that you won't find on the WiiU.    Minecraft Borderlands Lara croft and the temple of osiris Call of duty AW Diablo 3 Awesomenauts Halo collection (xbox one only) LittleBigPlanet 3 (ps4 only) Rocket League (ps4 only) Star Wars Battlefront (upcoming) Call of duty black ops 3 (upcoming)   In addition, some of the best couch co-op experiences are found on both WiiU and the other consoles.   Lego games Rayman Legends Trine 2   To summarize, for couch multiplayer in general, I would go with the Wii U. The other consoles don't even come close for couch-based multiplayer fun - but a lot of this is because of versus modes. For couch co-op specifically? I would probably go with xbox one. Ps4 is my console of choice usually just because for multiplatform games the graphics/framerate is marginally better than xbox one, but I never could get into littlebigplanet though I love Halo co-op.  Also notice how I have a couple ""upcoming"" on the other consoles? There are no big exclusive couch co op games that are coming to wii u that have been announced. With the other consoles you are guaranteed a steady stream of games."

The PS4 has more controller features (touchpad, speakers, gyro), PS Now streaming service, speedier interface, a few more exclusives etc.  It all comes down to personal preference.

That's like saying people wanting an engaging story in a Zelda game are missing the point of Zelda - that being to explore the world and solve puzzles. That is a fundamental aspect of the game, sure, but that doesn't mean story can't be a part of the game as well.   Length doesn't have to be cut just to satisfy an arcade nature of Star Fox. As a matter of fact, we can change up nearly aspect of the game and still pay tribute to the arcade roots of this series.   Stupid article."

I don't think I'm at all interested in a longer more involved experience and it would be decidedly not true to the series if it were.   It would feel like taking a game like The Binding of Isaac, removing replayability and making it a 14 hour game instead of a 1 hour game. It would intrinsicly change what it is.  Now, some people might enjoy what that changes into but I'm not sure those are the same people as the fans of the series as it stands"

It looks like (if you post a pic of the back I can confirm) it is indeed a splitter.  Which means it basically severs the function of taking one input (say a gamecube as seen in the background)  and displaying it on 8 TVs.   I imagine you are looking for a switch or selector that can take 8 inputs form 8 different consoles and dismay it on 1 tv with a remote or button.   Hope this helps."

consoles,3dg6eq,infinitelives,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:19:21 2015 UTC,"Correct.  But it's not about the games.  Sega Japan developed the first 3 sonic games and a host of other successful franchises.  The question was in regards to consoles.  Sega Japan developed the Genesis and Sega of America made it a huge success.  But a failure on the part of SoJ to keep their fingers out of a pie they knew nothing about, combined with disastrous decisions on Hardware upgrades (32x, Sega CD), new consoles (Saturn, Dreamcast) and failure to recognize a brilliant opportunity (Partner with Sony on the Playstation) because, again, SoJ listened to know one and threw their wight around whenever possible, is exactly what doomed them.  They had it.  If not for SoJ's behavior, we'd be debating the merits of the Sega Playstation 4 and marveling at what the Sony Engineers provided for Sega's new games to play on.  Do you see the thread among these three companies?  Look at the failure of XB1 and PS4 in China (less than a total combined sales of 600,000 units) in a country with over a billion people and well over 50 million gamers.  Failure to properly localize, or a mistaken belief that what worked here will work there (regardless of where ""here"" and ""there"" are) or just good old fashioned arrogance (plus a dash of racism/superiority complex) have ruined many, many companies.

consoles,3dg6eq,PiRedLlama,0,Mon Jul 20 22:29:29 2015 UTC,"there really isn't though. i know it's fun to propagate the idea of a ""console war"" since that's how the industry has survived and innovated since the mid 80s - manufacturers one upping each other every 2 or 3 years. it made for great forum threads about 8 years ago, and there's been a slew of documentaries and web series produced chronicling that exciting time. check out G4 icons for more info. but yeah, think about the 16/32/64 bit eras colliding around 95. you had the cdi, 3do, snes, genesis, playstation, 32x, turbografx, neogeo, sega cd, etc. we're 20 years later and it's quite different: two identical tech companies pushing identical entertainment platforms, and a third company pushing games machines. nintendo doesn't really compete directly with a company, but with a market (mobile, at least in japan). nintendo's strength lies in that no one else really makes the kind of software they do. to put it in marketing terms, they push experiences that can quite literally only be had on a nintendo platform. that said, the console market itself is consolidating into a streamlined experience. there just won't be a reason to manufacture the next great generation of competing hardware because of the expandability of the PC. you'll probably see peripherals and software sold for a modular PC-like entertainment hub. i guess in that respect, konami and capcom or whatever flavor-of-the-week publisher could get into some kind of hardware manufacturing when that time comes (if they are even still around). but back to the present, zero reason to spend that money and R&D on something that doesn't need to exist when they already make their money selling non-exclusive software on the current and last generation consoles. lol sorry for the rant. i work in the games industry so sometimes when people don't quite understand it i can get a little rambly. that's okay though, i don't always expect customers to understand how the industry actually works. anyway, cheers!"

They're comfortable and they sound good. The only issue I had with them is that when I first bought them, about a year ago, every so often, they would make my voice sound ""like Megatron"" to my friends. I googled it and quickly found that if you plug the headset and receiver into your computer, you can download a program from Turtle Beach that updates your firmware. I haven't had that problem since. And on top of that, the headset comes with 16 presets that you can use, and when you plug it into the computer, you can change those presets to be custom game presets, such as COD Footsteps, Battlefield Campaign, and GTA Campaign, just to name a few.  I have owned a lot of Turtle Beach products and they've never let me down. I recommend them 100%."

Hunting down Mega Man VI took months after it was released, because Toys R Us (Canada) was the only place I knew of that actually got new games.

He also called Mega Man X ""Mega Man Ten"", which is forgivable, but disheartening, because it made me think that he didn't need to order VI because a newer game was out.

consoles,3d7tca,The16BitGamer,0,Tue Jul 14 17:01:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think add-ons were good conceptually, but just really poorly supported and implemented.  For example, with a Super FX game (or Sega SVP game, aka Virtua Racing) you had to re-buy an expensive enhancement chip every time.  With add-ons, you buy the enhancement once.  I think if people had backed off and made the add-ons more like a GameGenie in form factor instead of things that required additional power supplies and cables, it could've been a cool concept.  Also, bundling the add-on with a flagship game (i.e. a Super FX enhancer bundled with Star Fox) would help increase the number of people with it and once you have it, you have it.  The RAM expansion for N64, for example, seemed to do pretty well and Perfect Dark didn't seem to suffer lack of sales due to requiring it."
consoles,3d7tca,QuickStopRandal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:27:49 2015 UTC,"I was referring to addons like the Sega CD, or the 32x which should have been Stand Alone systems rather than addons. GameGenie's and the chips improve the games not the systems. and the N64 in general seem to be poorly implemented, the expansion should have been there at the start, as well as rumble support"
consoles,3d7tca,delicious_cheese,-1,Wed Jul 15 18:42:43 2015 UTC,"I think the N64 RAM expansion had to do with the fact that they knew RAM prices would go down in time.  Nobody ever bitches about upgradeable computer RAM, that's for sure.  Also, IIRC, the Rumble Pack was a fairly new thing to be an OEM product for a system, the dual shock controller came later.  Up until that point, I only recall some flakey 3rd party add ons offering rumble and it was based on the bass level of a game if I remember correctly, which isn't always accurate as a bass-heavy song might make you feel like you're getting shot at.  As for the Sega CD and 32X, again, my point was that simpler versions like a 32X being more like a Sega SVP chip in a GameGenie-like housing would've been cleaner to implement.  The problem was that Sega tried to cram too much into their add-ons and effectively made them like another system both in terms of cost and the need for additional outlets."

If they got rid of 100 of them being a 1-up, the only thing left that they'd do is give you points, which matter even less than lives.  The tons of lives thing isn't as new as people think, though. I usually had the max of 99 lives in Super Mario Land 2. I had 100s of lives in Yoshi's Island. Even Super Mario World gave you like a hundred lives to spare if you played through it in one go, people just don't realize that because the lives reset to five whenever you loaded your file instead of your number of lives saving with your progress. The last Mario game where running out of lives was really a challenge was Super Mario Brothers 3."

consoles,3d3oas,morphinapg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:28:38 2015 UTC,"Typically 1080p and 2K are the same thing. Not always, there are some 2K projectors for example that run at 2048x1152, as the original meaning of 2K was referring to 2048 horizontal and 4K was 4096 horizontal. However, when they started making 4K TVs, the definition of 4K changed to 3840x2160, which is exactly double the dimensions of 1080p, so if something is being referred to as 2K today, it's almost certainly 1920x1080, or 1080p."

""If you wish to discuss the pros and cons of console A vs console B, that is totally fine"" If you are only able to debate about next-gen consoles and not PC's then there is something wrong there.

I was so disillusioned with modern gaming I went out and brought a WiiU, not because I like Nintendo games, but because I want to play games with my friends and my girlfriend!  I often wonder if its young people who are the biggest haters of split screen. They didn't grow up with it, and social interaction has changed utterly since the advent of the internet, social media and smartphones. Like do kids even have ""sleep overs"" anymore when they can just play online?  A lot of developers like to blame it on graphics but that's a cop out. Nobody who is playing split screen is paying attention to graphics.  I would love there to be some kind of split screen renaissance, but as people become more and more isolated and communicate more and more online im sure that they will eventually disappear altogether... And that makes me a sad panda.  The WiiU is pretty great tho."

I guess I'm a generation or two off from being the truly youngest generation (the one that minecraft for consoles and cod is marketed at), so I do remember the days you are talking about, and still play split screen Halo 3 with my friend quite a bit. But even then, i've been doing that less and less. So, yes I'd say it is obviously the younger generation fazing it out. Face to face multiplayer is still preserved on stuff like the 3DS tho, I suppose."
consoles,3cx75r,Tezla55,4,Sat Jul 11 16:34:23 2015 UTC,"I feel a lot of people don't like splite screen because of how little screen each player gets. I was at a friend's house once and we decided to play Call of Duty. However, my friend insisted that we should take turns playing so that we can each have the full screen to play instead of splitting the screen up. Maybe that's why some people don't care for split screen."

""lol, all my friends play online, so it's no issue"".  Ok, fine, but I'm sure people with kids, roommates, etc would love to sit around a TV and play games together.  4-player splitscreen Goldeneye defined many years of my childhood.  That said, I regrettably understand why it's dying out.  Even with one screen games are often struggling to maintain 30fps.  Having to render the same thing 2 or 4 times is just too much strain.  Although I wish developers would be willing to implement it at the cost of resultion.  1080p single player, but reduce it to 720p for split-screen if necessary."

I'm at a point in my age where my friends don't really come over to play games too often.  I'm planning a wedding, and life in general is getting in the way of having that couch co-op experience.    Now it doesn't mean that I think it shouldn't exist in the first place.  When I was a kid, I played a lot of split screen games.  I remember all the hours I spent on Goldeneye and Perfect Dark.  It was fun, but it was a whole different time.  It was a time before the Internet became as big as it is now.  Instead of having to get together with friends to play a game, we can hop into a lobby and wait 30 seconds for strangers to just show up.  Although, let's be real here: just because one game ditches the split screen experience doesn't mean it's actually dead.  Some games such as Borderlands, Diablo III, Gears of War, and a bunch of others still have a solid split-screen/co-op mode(s).  I think we are kinda being overdramatic here in a sense.  Also, I can't tell you how many times I would rather be home, wearing just my boxers in my own home, than at someone else's house."

Where normal couples may sit down to watch tv or Netflix, we game.  Also I host regular get-togethers with my friends. At least once a month there will be a group of 4 to 10 peoples in my house, making dinner, drinking, laughing, socialising and playing party games (kinect and the jackbox party pack are real hits).

consoles,3cwyyf,infinitelives,2,Sat Jul 11 18:25:40 2015 UTC,Thanks. One of the only reasons I was considering the PS4 is because everyone always says the PS4 a lot more powerful. I never cared much for graphics though.

Another thing in xbox favor:  5) newly announced (select) backwards compatibility/emulation  And honestly I think the exclusives are better on xbox. I'm a huge rare fan though.

consoles,3cwyyf,HD_Clouds,0,Sat Jul 11 16:05:39 2015 UTC,"Again you're just naming things both consoles do, and have for two generations now. I assume you mean the TV stuff with the One, which is a cool feature, but I don't use it since we dumped cable a while ago. For real, just look at exclusives. I got mine early on, and Dead Rising 3 was too much for me to resist. It's still a blast to pop in and play every now and then!"
consoles,3cwyyf,UND3ADTH3P3NGU1NL0RD,2,Sat Jul 11 16:07:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry. Well my point is, I don't care about all the extras. I'm leaning towards Xbox now. I got a while to decide while I save up."
consoles,3cwyyf,DaSwiggity,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:52:02 2015 UTC,"It really is a matter of opinion. I have a ps4, and love it, but for all I know Xbone might be just as good. Xbox just has a bad taste in my mouth after the whole 360 rrod that most folks got. I have one friend who had to deal with that issue multiple times. This gen, though, I havent heard of major issues with either system."
consoles,3cwyyf,snazzyshorts,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:50:50 2015 UTC,"I never had the RROD problem, though my old 360 did get screwed with some kind of hard drive issue. My current one has been running fine for years."
consoles,3cwyyf,lololololnoob,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:02:26 2015 UTC,Yeah the rrod was a nightmare. Fear every time I turned mine on. But I'm glad I stuck with it. Every since the changed in higher ups at Microsoft Xbox has been doing a lot to make us happy.
consoles,3cwyyf,smacksaw,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:44:02 2015 UTC,"to this day still i play with my original release xbox 360, it has always sat in open air, not in a small space. never once had the rrod, my friend who always sat his out too never had the rrod"
consoles,3cwyyf,Jamesaki,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:59:51 2015 UTC,play whichever one you have the most friends playing. Playing with your friends online is to me is the most enjoyable part of console gaming.
consoles,3cwyyf,spoonard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:49:51 2015 UTC,The Xbox one and ps4 are definately two amazing choices. If you want the popularity and larger community go with the Xbox one. If you want more exclusives and better graphics get the ps4. Also the Xbox one has a bit more media choices (I think). Then again if you want something that could go all around for more than enough years you could always use the PC route.

consoles,3ctvn6,DankDastardly,6,Fri Jul 10 20:46:15 2015 UTC,"It's pretty obviously coming to xbox though: when a game comes to Playstation and later PC Sony announces it as ""First on Playstation, Console Exclusive"".  For FF7R, it was simply announced as ""First on Playstation"".  So it's definitely coming to another console, and it's a pretty safe bet that console isn't the Wii U or Ouya."
consoles,3ctvn6,mylittlenpc,4,Fri Jul 10 20:56:14 2015 UTC,its so early in development that it's honestly probably not even locked down its platforms yet. i really hate these kind of retailer 'leaks' its always just retailers guessing
consoles,3ctvn6,gordallott,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:34:18 2015 UTC,"Problem is, you probably you won't like it if you haven't played the original. Just like you won't like Terminator Genisys if dont like the arnold or the first movie. It's all about nostalgia baby."
consoles,3ctvn6,DarkNation,2,Fri Jul 10 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"You know, with all the fuss people are making about this game I think I might just try this out. Never played a FF game before."
consoles,3ctvn6,HaikusfromBuddha,2,Fri Jul 10 20:12:27 2015 UTC,This should surprise no one. This game is guaranteed to sell millions overnight. They'd be crazy to put all the time to remake one of the objectively best games of all time and not release it on multiple platforms.
consoles,3ctvn6,ProbablyHighAsShit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:17:42 2015 UTC,Exactly.  There's a time and place for titles that are going to be permanently exclusive.  This is something that people have LUSTED after.  There is no fan base that will not scramble to get this when it comes out.
consoles,3ctvn6,anxious_anatomist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:37:03 2015 UTC,I hope it sees a SteamOS release.
consoles,3ctvn6,GLAMODYSSEY,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"No shit, Sherlock. What tipped you off? The fact that they never said it was exclusive or the way they said ""coming first to ps4?""  ...I'm sorry. You don't deserve that, EB, you're doing your best, and I'm just stressed."
consoles,3ctvn6,higmage,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:52:55 2015 UTC,Probably.  I can't imagine that they wouldn't after releasing just about every other FF title on Steam.

consoles,3ctxk4,MikeyJayRaymond,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:27:43 2015 UTC,back when Microsoft acquired Mojang i ran the numbers - I don't remember the specifics but even factoring in things like potential minecraft movies and the like - they would have to sell more than as many copies of minecraft have been sold already to make their money back.  minecraft really needs to be on everything for their deal to make sense
consoles,3ctxk4,gordallott,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:50:34 2015 UTC,Only if you look at pure assets. They also aqquired the working team etc.  It'll pay off in the future as Mojang make more games
consoles,3ctxk4,KeyVapours,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:49:05 2015 UTC,"problem being is that its not an especially interesting working team, microsoft has tens of thousands of developers, a handful of other developers who haven't done anything interesting (the people that made Minecraft a success are long gone) are never going to bring them future sales to justify the cost."
consoles,3ctxk4,gordallott,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:56:39 2015 UTC,"That's not true, they have many up and coming debs on their team. Most of them are pretty young, MS bought on potential.  They're also hardly uninteresting, hence the massive acquisition."

The brand was important too, obviously. Plus the IP.   if microsoft wanted to spend 2 billion dollars on talent there are far more interesting studios.    Maybe, not necassarily young talent though   as is, they bought a brand and happened to get a handful of young and uninteresting developers along with it - a handful of unintresting young unproven developers that are far dwarfed by their yearly intake from major universities    In your opinion.  Maybe there were better ways to spend $2b but it wasn't exactly worthless, was it? And just because it doesn't pay out more than they paid in now doesn't mean much. They obviously saw the potential."

consoles,3ctybh,delicious_cheese,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:23:07 2015 UTC,Good call on their part.  The only reason Battletoads was never patched was because the technology didn't exist at the time.  It's not dishonoring the original game in any way by fixing an unfortunate mistake.  Though their cited commitment to preserving the games as they originally were makes me wonder how they've decided to handle the letter pick-ups in R.C. Pro-Am that spell NINTENDO.
consoles,3ctybh,infinitelives,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:11:36 2015 UTC,"What technology didn't exist?  Remote upgrades?  There were plenty of games on NES that were revised after their initial release.  After seeing this, reminds me I need to see Battletoads on the SNES that I never got a chance to play."
consoles,3ctybh,_minus,2,Sat Jul 11 23:20:51 2015 UTC,"That's why I used the term ""patched.""  Reportedly, Battletoads was fixed outside the US, like a lot of games were â€” not necessarily outside the US but whenever additional shipments were made.  But that fix did nothing for owners of the original glitched copies, because the technology didn't exist at the time.  Of course they fixed the ones they could; who wouldn't?  Which is exactly why the idea of preserving a glitch for the sake of authenticity makes little sense.  Yeah, there's value in the awareness and documentation of it, but it doesn't belong in a professional re-release of the game, then or now.  Although considering the size of the game is mere kilobytes, if authenticity mattered that much, they could probably put the glitched version in too and make it accessible through a debug menu or an options screen."
