The unnamed European carrier in the Financial Times article is reportedly planning to target Google and block its ads to force the company into giving up some of its revenue.  Carriers could bypass this by creating a paid-for ad blocking service, or even by asking customers to opt-in to any ad blocking, but that might not avoid scrutiny from regulators or pressure from the advertising industry.

Gaming can be an addiction. Addiction to a bad thing (games) normally needs to be weened away from and replaced by addiction (or positive habit) tied to something more positive (eg exercise, meditation, volunteering [assuming paying work is hard to find], social networking).  Thankfully, the positive habits only take say 90 days to develop, assuming one wants to change and pursues change with determination.   Positive psychology as an academic subject has progressed by leaps and bounds since around 1980.  Would be nice if the people financing medical/mental health care would recognize gaming addiction as a disorder (along with porn/masturbation/orgasm [PMO] addiction) and free up funding for psychologists to coach and counsel those with gaming and PMO addiction.  Problem with just destroying games is the risk of stealing to finance a new game collection, among other risks."

What have I become?  Something unexpected, I didn't even realize I was becoming this person, but now I am.  I look at Mr. Roger's smile, as if he would still believe in me, even trust me.  But would he, or would he be as disappointed as everyone else?  I see it in their eyes, hear it in the whispers behind my back...  It is the echo in the silence when I enter a room. But I don't know what else to be.  I somehow ended up where I am, and I don't blame anyone else for my decisions.  I made them on my own, not even with the advice of others.  There was no one to guide me or tell me what was expected of me.  I simply followed my own impulses and desires. Now even, I see how people are afraid to step out of line with me, or possibly utter something that will get me going.  Instead people choose to avoid me.
