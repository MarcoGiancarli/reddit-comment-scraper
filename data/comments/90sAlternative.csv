90sAlternative,3dt2tx,AsaBringman,3,Sun Jul 19 04:41:13 2015 UTC,"This is an album I can listen to until my eyeballs pop out. Yusssss, Mike Patton......"
90sAlternative,3doawe,L3aBoB3a,3,Fri Jul 17 22:14:26 2015 UTC,"Just listened to this whole album today.  One of the best rock albums of the 90s.  Very enigmatic, mysterious, and forceful."
90sAlternative,3doawe,frogstomp427,3,Sat Jul 18 03:17:15 2015 UTC,LIVE was/is extremely underrated. check out the 99 woodstock show.
90sAlternative,3doawe,allisonwonderland00,3,Sat Jul 18 03:29:29 2015 UTC,Dam At Otter Creek is probably my favorite from that album!
90sAlternative,3doawe,Chevellephreak,2,Sat Jul 18 05:01:29 2015 UTC,Dam At Otter Creek   gives you the fucking goose bumps no matter who you are https://youtu.be/MIB2BZuKKlA

90sAlternative,3dhlfz,apequake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:46:55 2015 UTC,IIRC this song was inspired about a man that played spoons on the subway that the band used everyday on their way to the studio.   Also one of my fav songs to play on Rockband.
90sAlternative,3dd4ap,apequake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:36:02 2015 UTC,I found this song last year and loved it.

90sAlternative,3d6cy1,voltronforlife,4,Mon Jul 13 21:41:45 2015 UTC,I love this song. I listen to it whenever I do deep cleaning.
90sAlternative,3d6cy1,preciousfairyvagina,2,Tue Jul 14 05:00:43 2015 UTC,I don't think I've ever heard such a unique description of circumstances in which someone enjoys listening to a song.  Deep cleaning is a good one!  I know I've got my cleaning tunes.  How is r/cleaningmusic not a thing??!
90sAlternative,3d6cy1,_banal_sex_,2,Tue Jul 14 11:00:18 2015 UTC,One hit wonder from my teenage years! Love it!
90sAlternative,3d6cy1,Musikwala,2,Tue Jul 14 06:31:51 2015 UTC,"It's a one hit wonder for sure, but the whole album is actually a really great listen!"

90sAlternative,3d6cy1,Musikwala,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:34:48 2015 UTC,i'm pretty sure this song plays on pandora regardless of genre chosen.
90sAlternative,3d0qtc,uninnocent,2,Sun Jul 12 15:28:58 2015 UTC,This is the song that cemented my love of Pearl Jam. It's also such a fun song to play on the guitar.
90sAlternative,3cyb0l,voltronforlife,2,Sat Jul 11 21:48:26 2015 UTC,i love mighty mighty bosstones

90sAlternative,3c90qw,atticus138,3,Mon Jul 6 00:55:16 2015 UTC,This song tells such a simple and wonderful story.  Always has been one of my favorites.
90sAlternative,3ca98j,apequake,2,Mon Jul 6 09:20:46 2015 UTC,"Loved this song during my younger days.  Along with Rail's ""Immune Defficiency"" (AKA ""I spent yesterday smoking drugs and getting drunk"") it was a scourge of my school-teacher father. He hated it."
