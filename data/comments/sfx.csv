The clothing will hide the attachment. You're going to have a tough time attaching a tail with just adhesive directly to the actor's skin unless the tail is very light. The tail in the video was CGI."
sfx,3da1jo,scaryballoonman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:02:05 2015 UTC,"I've seen a couple different techniques for mechanical tails, but haven't tried either. First is a K'nex and rubber band version, but I imagine it would be heavy. The second one is the kind they use for animatronics and offers more control... Imagine a button with 4 holes in it. Now make a row of them with all the holes lined up - sort of like a cylinder with 4 holes running through it. Thread a wire through each hole and move the buttons apart so there is an inch or two of space between them and secure them to one single wire, and on the last button secure the wire. Now when you pull on one of the wires from the other end, the one secure wire will hold on and the rest of the buttons will move, causing the ""tail"" to curve one way or another, left, right, up or down. This is basically how they make an animatronic tail move, with someone off screen or mechanical servos manipulating it. In theory, it seems simple, but I haven't tried it out (though now I want to!). You can then hold it onto you with a belt, and if you need it to blend in like the Thale clip, maybe cover it with a skin made from latex that you blend into your skin? You might get a rat-like tale if you give it a body-stocking of spandex first, and then cover that with liquid latex - it will give it that skin look, but still be flexible."

They'll sweat quite a bit no doubt, but the makeup should hold up with proper sealing without needing any major touch-ups. But keep stuff backstage for actors to do touch-ups along the way during the show. It will certainly help.   You can also check /r/techtheatre for other opinions too."

You use a lot of product (latex and tissue paper) in all of your applications which isn't totally necessary and less of it will bring a more realistic tone to your wounds. Less will also make the edges easier to conceal with your real skin. Also, try and incorporate another blood tone. The wounds seem a little flat because you don't have enough colors to work with.

Most foam latex kits will come with instructions for general use (run schedule), but if you want to get very good at using it, you'll need to come up with your own run schedule. Get a thermometer, barometer, and create a foam room. Preferably one that is temperature controlled, and well ventilated at the same time. Get a good 12 speed mixer.  After all that, take notes on temp, humidity, foaming and gelling agent quantity and mix times on each stage, then adjust accordingly. This is all said from personal experience, and YMMV.

sfx,3bx03l,BACONbitty,2,Thu Jul 2 21:08:32 2015 UTC,"That is a good, but quite expensive, kit. It is also missing two key elements if you want a perfect copy of the subject's face, hot pour clay and a device to melt it. If not, use ultracal stone for a quick lifecast. You could get the kit or get everything in it yourself and save a few bucks. It would also help to have a barber's chair immensely, especially if you are going to do this often. Lastly, I REALLY like Smooth-On's ""Body Double"" as an alternative to alginate, especially if you have any need to pull the casting more than once as alginate castings are only good ONCE unless you use a clay pour and do a stone mold from that.  The steps are as follows.   Using a hot plate and pot or crock pot, heat up your hot pour clay (Plastaline clay with NO sulfur. Ex. Monster Clay and Chavant) Cut up plaster bandages into strips, make sure to have multiple widths and lengths. Apply bald cap to subject with adhesive (pros-aide, telesis, etc.) Cover subject in plastic (I cut up garbage bags into a poncho.) Mix up alginate and IMMEDIATELY start applying everywhere on the head, neck, and shoulders, leaving nasal passages unblocked for breathing. Some people stick straws up there, makes nostrils perfectly round in your casting if you do it though. Once you have everything covered in a nice, thick, even layer let the alginate set. Depending on the brand takes anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes. Once set, beginning at the subject's face, apply plaster bandages following a line from the top of the head, in front of the ears, and the tops of the shoulders and across the chest. Give the bandages a little bit of a lip (extra bandages) along this line that will divide the front of the head/face/chest from the back of the head/neck/back. Once the bandages set, apply a GENEROUS amount of petroleum jelly to the lip. Cover the rest (back) of the head, neck, and shoulders with bandages. This time, the lip should slightly overlap the bandages on the front but only where you applied the petroleum jelly. Once this sets up, the hardest part begins... you need to pull the back of the head mold off just enough to get a rounded edge pallet knife or other DULL, rounded edge that won't cut your subject into the mold and cut the alginate along that line as precisely as possible. With HELP, have your subject lean back as far as they can, this is where the barber's chair would be helpful. Pull the back of the head off, making sure not to drop or tear the alginate. It should fall away and stay with the mold at this point, but if not use a gloved finger to get a gap started. Put this aside CAREFULLY. Now lean your subject as far forward as possible while holding firmly onto the plaster mother mold. They should come loose quite easily. Take an extra little bit of alginate and seal the nose holes at this time.  Place the two parts of the mold together upside down, tape or strap the mold and place it inside a five gallon bucket. Pour either the stone or the clay and let set. It is important that you do this as soon as possible after the casting as alginate shrinks as it dehydrates and can warp, shrink, and otherwise ruin your casting. If using clay, you can then proceed to tool the lifecast to remove any imperfections from the molding process that can and almost always do occur.   A final bit of advice; many people do not realize how claustrophobic they can get until getting a lifecast done. You need to be prepared to keep the subject as calm as possible (music definitely helps) and be willing to give up the materials to pull them out at a moment's notice. They won't be able to talk, so come up with a set of hand signals and remember to keep checking to make sure they are doing ok. They can't see, can't talk, and can barely hear. They have to stay as still as possible through the process, it can be stressful even without the immediate closeness of the casting medium."

sfx,3bx03l,Witzy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:54:50 2015 UTC,"Some people stick straws up there, makes nostrils perfectly round in your casting if you do it though.   Some people do this, but it's incredibly dangerous.  Don't ever put straws in your subjects nose during a life cast.  It's easier for them to become blocked or to get bumped and cut the inside of the person's nasal cavity.  Just use your finger to carefully work the alginate around their nose area, leaving the nostrils open.  Once you pull the cast off their head, you can quickly plug the opening in the cast with a handful of dental alginate."
sfx,3bx03l,TheStarKiller,0,Sat Jul 4 23:15:24 2015 UTC,seconding this do NOT use straws in the nose. Ive done dozens of life casts professionally and we always have a person there whos job is solely to watch the persons nose.  And also though slightly more expensive a silicone for lifecasts like body double is gonna be way way better for you. It will give you a bit more working time and will last longer if you dont cast up immediately into the headcast. Alginate tends to shrink quickly.
sfx,3bxjcr,SpeakThunder,2,Thu Jul 2 23:47:47 2015 UTC,"Most shops and artists will provide you a quote for how much an effect will cost, find someone local and ask for a quote. Couldn't hurt and will give you a connection you can use in the future when you do have a budget.   Now... that being said, if it were me I would recommend silicone, airbrushed for flesh tone, hair punched, and having a puppeteer move it with a wire in close up. If you want it on an under costume harness... `$1k. If it needs to be applied then double. Important thing to remember is that it would look REAL. The more you can spend, the better the realism."
sfx,3bxjcr,Evi1bo1weevi1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:18:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! All around, great advice. I have just a few follow p questions if you would indulge me. Is the 1K you mentioned for the materials or an estimate of what someone might charge to create it? When you say silicone, do you make a plaster mold first then pour? Or is it like latex where you cover some sort of base material or armature? Do you know of any tutorials out there on the interwebs? Thanks again!"
sfx,3bxjcr,Evi1bo1weevi1,2,Fri Jul 3 00:31:41 2015 UTC,"It would be material cost plus labor. It has to be sculpted, molded, cast, painted, and punched. It takes a special paint that typically is airbrushed, but veining and imperfections look especially good on silicone. Also, bubbles can be an issue with silicone so it needs to be degassed in a vacuum chamber before pouring. If it has to be applied to skin there is an application and painting process involved as well on set.

sfx,3bu7p9,Fartin_Gary,2,Thu Jul 2 14:00:37 2015 UTC,That will work. There's two types of latex commonly used. Slip cast latex and balloon rubber. Slip cast is best for masks and props as it's pretty rigid. Balloon rubber is better for things like bald caps.
sfx,3bu7p9,allykatte,3,Thu Jul 2 15:01:23 2015 UTC,Thin stripes of rigid collodion creates a 3D effect much like severe split lips.

sfx,3bpa93,ADHD_LOBO,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:40:50 2015 UTC,Can you give a quick run down what you did?
sfx,3bpa93,snoman18x,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:30:25 2015 UTC,Yep! I sculpted the tendons onto my arms first using wax and spirit gum. Then I used the wax to create the torn skin. Once this was done I used my flesh palette to paint all of the skin by stippling different skin tones. Then I went in with red and blood toned alcohol paints stippling around the torn skin. Then I painted the inside of the tendon area before adding blood to the whole thing.  In hindsight I should have probably sealed the wax with latex because it was causing the blood to bubble weirdly which took away from the effect I wanted it to have.   Hope this helps :)

sfx,3bl8mo,ashafuckinglee,2,Tue Jun 30 03:18:30 2015 UTC,"Cool effect but next time i recommend rubbing a thin layer of washing up liquid (dish soap) on your skin or appliance before adding any blood.

sfx,3bmyss,scooley01,2,Tue Jun 30 14:56:43 2015 UTC,"Buy quality in quantity, first and foremost. It takes more than one layer to get skin to look white and not be streaked.   Since you are doing this for stage, grease paint is the way to go. Oil based so it won't sweat off but cheap grease paint is terrible for streaking and making a mess so get a professional makeup and save yourself time and cleanup. Don't forget to use setting powder or it will get EVERYWHERE! Lastly, get a makeup remover for grease paint of you will end up scrubbing your skin off.   I prefer Kryolan, but Ben Nye costs less and still considered a professional product. I'm linking the big tub (8oz) of white and the proper setting powder from Amazon, with prime/free shipping as a reference. Most theatrical makeup stores sell Ben Nye if you want to buy local. You can use any non-oil makeup remover, Ben Nye has Quick Cleanse or Bond Off, the latter of which doubles as a prosthetic glue remover.  http://www.amazon.com/Ben-Nye-Clown-White-Makeup/dp/B003AT6JIA/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1435709002&sr=8-3&keywords=ben+nye+grease  http://www.amazon.com/Ben-Nye-Neutral-Setting-Powder/dp/B003AT914Y/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1435709026&sr=8-2&keywords=ben+nye+setting+powder"

Generally speaking, he's white, but I know makeup tends to look differently under stage lights, and I don't want to look too weird :)"
sfx,3bmyss,Evi1bo1weevi1,2,Wed Jul 1 17:00:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you will have a very difficult time finding anything pale enough in a flesh tone. What you could consider doing is a single light coat of white and blending it really well to eliminate streaks (takes extra care but is possible) before setting while darkening the eye sockets similar to this:  https://imgur.com/gallery/4ZuBH  On the TV show, it was black and white so who knows, on the terrible reboot TV show he was actually blue-grey which was terrible. The movie is by far your best bet, and they went almost white at times.  Grease paint, especially white, is semi translucent. To go clown white you need a few layers, so a single layer or two should work. A warning though, the bald cap is going to be tricky. You can get rubber mask grease paint to fix the problem, but that's expensive. The best bet is to get a small bottle of castor oil and mix a little in with some grease paint of the same color that you are putting on your skin, which is all rubber mask grease paint really is. You can just put it on without it and deal with the results (you guessed it, streaks) but making your own RMGP is easy.  In the terms of makeup, what you're aiming for is a vampire white rather than a clown white, but in grease paint terms that is all a matter of layers. If you are worried how it is going to look on stage, try it out at rehearsal and have someone photograph it with the stage lighting. If you think it is too white, add a few drops of gray to knock it back a few shades."

It's a lot of fun but your job is never secure. You might sign on for a season but once it's done... It's done. You need to put yourself out there. Make business cards, a website and maybe even stickers.   Network, network, network. Link your website to your social media pages (but NEVER comment ""hey check out my page!!"" on social media... Trust me, really get involved in the makeup community. You're gonna end up doing jobs for free because it'll look good on your resume. But you just do it because you need the experience.   Offer to do Halloween makeups, if there's a theme park around you that does something festive for Halloween, inquire as to how you can get involved.   It's a rough industry to start out in for sure but it's very rewarding. I make new connections and networks every time I do something. Then seeing my work on TV is so surreal.   Just stay humble. Stay down to earth and always remember the people who taught you/took you under their wing. Support other artists doing the same kinds of work. Be polite but fun.... And you'll make it."

sfx,3b90d8,Evi1bo1weevi1,3,Sat Jun 27 16:32:33 2015 UTC,"I am a five year veteran of the makeup effects industry in Los Angeles. CMS is the best place to go if you want to make connections which is 99% of getting work in Los Angeles.   You will be, and remain, poor. Los Angeles is expensive and most artists I know live with multiple roommates. The only money to be made is as a shop owner and even that is risky and not a guarantee of a half decent lifestyle. This is compounded by the glut of artists that have flooded the market since Face/Off starting airing on SyFy. For every one paid artist who is established, there are 10 with good skills right out of school willing to work for free because they have family support.  You won't be able to do hair. You must have a California cosmetology license and be a member of IATSE to work in film on hair. There is no cosmetology track at CMS, just a photographic hair styling course. If you join IATSE, you will almost guarantee your inability to work at any shop as most run as independent contractors. There are very few members of the guild in effects.  All of that being said, it is amazing work and I absolutely love it. It is 60+ hours a week for a month at a time with long gaps of unemployment between that will make you paranoid and broke but it is completely worth it. It might actually be smarter to learn on  your own independently or via something akin to Stan Winston school as the certification from Cinema Makeup School isn't worth the paper it is printed on. You WILL get some great skills and excellent contacts there but it comes at an extreme price.   Finding work is remarkably easy, finding PAYING work will be next to impossible for a while. No one will pay you until you get established, to get established you have to work for free. This is a new problem that has arisen in Los Angeles. Blame SyFy."
sfx,3b90d8,TheStarKiller,2,Sat Jun 27 16:44:46 2015 UTC,EDIT: the basics of hairstyling for photography is what i ment to say not actually doing hair (cut/color/ect.) I have done it in the past for friends at home but I don't have a licence and I'm not interested in that as a career.  But im currently living in Los Angeles and it took me a good year to adjust to the cost of living... one of my biggest concern is the cost of school I do have good credit if I end up having to get a personal loan but hopefully can find a way to save up without having to do that. (Early 2016 start dates gives me some time) I would hate to put myself into a hole financially that I would struggle to get out of. My second concern was the job market bc of Face-off. (Not fond of personally) with that said I will look into the other option you mentioned. I've been trying to learn on my own and have some stuff to practice with so I'll keep doing that and learning ad much as I can on my own.   Thank you. 😊
sfx,3b90d8,TheStarKiller,2,Sat Jun 27 18:04:47 2015 UTC,"Dont go to cms or any school. You will wind up just owing money and it isnt going to get you any farther in the industry except meeting some people. Weve had a ton of cms and other school kids come through the shop I work at over the years who have blown my mind with how little they have actually learned from school (not even being able to mix stone or 2 part plastic) but weve also got kids who have no experience no school no nothing who just want it and have done really well. there are many shops who will take anyone in for an internship and if you show them you want this, dont annoy people and spend every second working or cleaning during down time they will keep you around.  spend all your time practicing and learning what you can. stan winston school is a low cost way to do so."

sfx,3b90d8,quigonjen,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:37:58 2015 UTC,"Stan winston school links or recommends the supplies for each tutorial. I think the big thing with that particular program you can see if you are into before you throw over 10k down the drain with a different school.  Honestly just every single shop you can find email address on most their sites or facebooks and just ask about internships. Most internships run 2 weeks and in that time you will learn way more hands on then you ever will at a school.  Make sure you expectations are in the right place as well. This industry is far from glamorous. I hope you LOVE fiberglass cause you will do a lot of it. Ive spent weeks doing glass work day in and day out and have had interns do the same glassing, sanding, body shop. You will not be sculpting until you prove yourself which might be years down the line. Also keep in mind there is a huge difference between shop work and onset work. They are usually 2 completely different crews. If you want to be an onset artist just apply makeups day in and out build up your portfolio working on low budget movies anything you can do get yourself out there."
sfx,3b7pc0,scooley01,2,Fri Jun 26 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"Typically, bald caps are one time use only.  You have to cut them into shape when applying it (around the ears, etc.) and a properly-applied one has a lot of tension on it when it's glued down.  Depending on the size of the house you're performing in (i.e. how far away from the audience you are), you might be able to get away with cutting the top off of a latex mask like this and using that.  It will be much more durable than a bald cap, but it won't look as good.  Otherwise, maybe it's time to get one of these."
sfx,3b7pc0,BackOfTheHearse,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:33:46 2015 UTC,"Our house is small (~250 max), but I wonder if you could blend the edges of one of those with latex enough to make it look OK?

sfx,3b0xfg,TericeNatalie,7,Thu Jun 25 02:10:15 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, thin the edges out when you're blending the latex.   As far as making the latex match, as soon as the latex sets and dries, stipple a foundation that is your skin tone over top of the latex. Go in and set that with a translucent powder. If that doesn't work, you can actually mix in a small amount of your foundation into the latex and then build up your cuts with the foundation/latex.   Also, take a small detail brush or lip brush and line the insides and deeper sections of the cuts with some dark brown and/or dark red tones, it'll add some dimension to your wounds. around the edges of the actual wound and the skin, bruise it up a little bit. If someone was cut like this in real life, the skin around the cut would be red and irritated. Going in with matte eyeshadows will always be my favorite method.   The thing that I tell myself every single time that I do a SFX look is. ""What would this look like, bruise like, bleed like... If it happened in real life"". Sometimes I google it or being a nurse, I can just think back to some cases at the hospital. Make it realistic. Take your time. Good luck to you!"

sfx,3b0xfg,lovelypeaches,2,Thu Jun 25 02:47:26 2015 UTC,Also you can put brown face paint of some kind over top the latex and put your foundation over top. It makes it even out so its not so light colored whenever you put foundation on the latex.

sfx,39so72,bipityboppitybuttsex,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:18:44 2015 UTC,"I think the easiest way would be to use spirit gum to stick the hook to your face, then cover that with liquid latex and cotton balls or tissue and just keep building it up until you have a fairly strong layer over the base of the hook. Paint it with makeup to match the rest of your face and cover in some good old fake blood.  I'm really not sure how strong this would be though and I'm pretty sure that the hook would flop about after a while and the latex would probably start to pull away with all the facial movement and sweating. The look is really cool but I think it might be more of a photo look rather than a party look.   There is a youtube tutorial of the fish hook look here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqYoQFUTmI4 the hook part starts at about 4:20 that might help.  Good luck with the look! Can you post some pics when you've done it I'd love to see how it turned out and if you found a way to keep the hook securely on your face."

sfx,39so72,TeaIsForTeagan,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:28:52 2015 UTC,"Spirit gum is a strong glue for skin, it's pretty strong and flexible. You put a thin layer of it on the skin, wait until it gets tacky and then stick the fish hook on it (then you would add the latex over the top of it). I figured it might help give the hook some extra hold on your cheek (I usually use it for sticking on fake scars or prosthetics). You'll need some spirit gum remover as well otherwise when you take the hook off you'll be have a crusty patch of glue stuck to your face.  Maybe you could bend the hidden end of the fish hook to make a kind of U shape and put latex inside the U part and around and on top of it which might stop it from flopping around as it will be held at two points?"

sfx,399wzo,hilarymilne,2,Wed Jun 10 08:40:18 2015 UTC,Skin Illustrator alcohol-activated paints are skin-safe and I've painted tons of latex with them.
sfx,399wzo,DIY_Lobotomy,2,Wed Jun 10 11:39:27 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  There are a few options you could go for,but I personally find it very hard to do a decent paintjob on latex (because of its lacking of texture and pores), especially when I try to blend it into my own skin color.  First of all you could use anything that is creme-based, like make up or grease paints. Just make sure to powder over everything after painting. There's also something called ""Castor sealer"" which you can use to prime your piece first.  Then there are those realy expensive skin illustrator palletes, which you have to activate with alkohol. Not the easiest to work with for a beginner.  But talking about skin-safety: How about skipping from latex to gelatine? I did a face-piece with gelatine just the other day and it turned out so much better then anything I did before. As a bonus it has a much more skin-like finish once it's dry."
sfx,399wzo,Blue_Fairy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:40:46 2015 UTC,"I would love to use Foam latex for the piece, but I just dont have the facilities for it. I am actually going with a cold urethane foam, and slushing a 'skin' with latex first, as the cold foam I am using tends to not create its own skin layer like foam latex does. I am worried that the gelatine would be too heavy, and may not adhere properly if I am honest. The piece is a full face mask with some larger features, and I am already worried about the weight of the piece  Cream based makeup is probably going to be the best option, just got to find a place that can get it to me ASAP!  Thank you so much!"
sfx,399wzo,Evi1bo1weevi1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:33:52 2015 UTC,"At my shop, and in the industry in general, we paint all latex in pax paint and then seal it with powder after letting it cure for 24 hours. Looks great, lasts forever.   edit: It is technically skin safe, but you would paint an appliance with it before application. That is a very odd criteria, btw, especially if you can prep the piece ahead of time. It is acrylic based so if not that... I'm not a fan of painting latex with alcohol ink. Too translucent and doesn't adhere as well to latex as it does skin, which is what it is designed for. I'd go the stage route and use rubber mask grease paint."
sfx,399wzo,TeaIsForTeagan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:19:25 2015 UTC,"If it has to be skin safe then you're best bet would be some kind of face paint and/or makeup.   You could use facepaints - water based like snazaroo or mehron paradise are good for blending, and wax based like diamond fx or wolfe fx are good for layering and line work. These kind of paints give a really opaque coverage.  Or you could use Skin Illustrator alcohol activated paints, these are much less opaque so they're good for things like bruises, veins or tattoos as it has a more under the skin effect compared to the other types of facepaint. These palettes are pretty expensive but one big advantage is that they are water and smudge resistant so you wouldn't have to worry as much about messing up your paint job.  Are you going to post a picture of the finished piece? I'd love to see it."

One of the things I would want to know as a beginner is what your basic kit list would be, things you just can't live without and things that rarely get used. Also, cheap alternatives for things (I've seen lots of really creative stuff online for making different types of blood using coffee grounds for texture or powdered/dried onions for making gross scabby kind of blood).  Another thing would be etiquette for working on other people, I do most of my sfx on myself and I'm sure when you work on other people there are some sort of guidelines for working on your models.   Prosthetic removal would be another thing I'd want to know about (I've has a few free face waxes before I learnt that ripping prosthetics off wasn't actually the right way to do it).  Also, the design process along with material decision making in regards to ensuring pieces staying on your face when you move your face around (on halloween I used scar wax to build up scars and it pretty much all came off after a couple of hours just from making facial expressions).  Other than that...everything! Haha, as a newbie I just want to know everything there is to know! Hope your seminar goes amazingly"

Just feel them out socially.  Some talent like to talk.  Others do not.  Baby powder and a removal agent (Specific to whatever you used as an adhesive) are perfect for removal.  I always just make grab bags of travel sized cleansers and lotions to give to my talent).  Design.  Draw, and sketch, and plan, and watch videos on the internet, behind the scenes special features, the movies themselves.  I like to watch movies and try and figure out how they did it, on my own, as a nice test.  Scar wax just doesn't hold up for long periods no matter what you do. It's good for a quick photo shoot or to practice, but other than that, I'm not a huge fan of the stuff.  Hope some of that helps you out!"

sfx,38okdl,dino_dog,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:00:22 2015 UTC,"Did you use makeup on top of it when you were done? What kind?  Another thing you can do to make it look more realistic, is put down some blue and red patches of makeup down (I like the Ben Nye Bruise wheels) before you put the TP and latex down, this will give it  some more dimension and look like muscle under the ripped opens skin.  You can also add some red fibers from wool to add a 3D effect too."
sfx,38okdl,TeaIsForTeagan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:05:15 2015 UTC,"It a really good start! Halloween is my favourite holiday!  Are you separating the sheets of tissue? I find that pulling apart the two sheets and using just one means there's less of a 'step' where the tissue starts. Also you could try bringing the latex further down onto the skin where you haven't used tissue to help hide the edges better, and build it up in really thin layers of tissue and latex. Also like dino_dog said using small irregular shaped pieces of tissue works nicely.  For the wound I usually paint the inside of the flaps a darkish colour to make the wound look a bit deeper before covering it with blood, along with more colour variety inside the wound (a stippling sponge works really nicely for this). You could try adding some dried/powdered onions to give the blood a kind of scabby look to it, or inside the wound maybe a thin layer of latex with cotton wool in it to give it a textured muscle look.   Hope these tips help, and it's really awesome for a first attempt! btw were you surprised by how bad liquid latex smelled? When I first used it I was like did I get a bad batch or something? This smells gross!"

sfx,386ohw,mermaidunicornhybrid,9,Tue Jun 2 06:10:42 2015 UTC,"Great concept! Wall of text incoming, be prepared...  Flesh side - I'm not sure about the TP. I do like the idea of it over the centre of the face, where the two 'faces' meet, but I don't think it's necessary around the edges. I also think you don't need it over your forehead, it distracts from your paintwork where it wrinkles. You could try just doing this as a painting first as it can give a useful different view before adding texture.   Regarding your skull in general, I really like the bone and muscle layer thing going on, especially the blood around the cheek where muscle is peeling away from bone. What I'd suggest you do it look at some anatomical pictures of the skull from different angles to give you a better idea of the muscles on top of bone. Particularly the eye area, that big ring around the eye (the orbicularis oculi) doesn't extend down towards the nose as you have it here. Also pay attention to things like the shape of eye sockets and nasal bone, eye sockets are larger and less oval than you have here and the nasal bone stops quite far up - there would be no centre line of white bone.   The colour in your cheek muscle is great, some great texture painted in there and would be nice to see more of this, perhaps around the edge of the face where you currently have gore. Your teeth are not bad but you don't have enough of them! With teeth as well remember that they get smaller as you get further away from the mouth and are generally pretty straight, good pic here. If you don't want the full mouth you could do the same as you did on the cheek and have some stripped away muscle.  Sugar skull side - this is where you let yourself down. You obviously have the ability but your design on this side is very bare and distracts from the dramatic flesh and bone. Calavera are made from, well, sugar, so they normally have a white base. As facepaint they normally have black detailing with the colour inside the lines. I'd suggest you have a google around and look at some different designs for some inspiration. The great thing about sugar skulls is that they can be made to a very individual style easily, so do some doodles on paper and make your own look! A bold, clear sugar skull would make your concept much more recognisable and have impact on both sides of the face.   What particular paints are you using? Also interested in what colours you have available."

sfx,386ohw,Destruct-o-Bun,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU SO MUCH! I really appreciate you taking the time to write all that out.  Most of the anatomy pointers I'm definitely going to adopt for my next look! I really want to redo this now with just the paint to see if I can make it better!  The only point I'm not keen on is the Sugar Skull thing-- although I do agree it's pretty clear my heart wasn't in it (because it's not!). I'm from Canada and don't know many Mexican people and don't know how to use that aesthetic without being appropriative. If it were a bhindi or a native headdress, I'm more familiar with the cultures and I think I would be better at determining when it's appropriate (which is pretty much never, for anyone reading this). However with the Sugar Skull, I just don't know how the appropriation of this look by so many white girls on instagram is affecting the people from whose culture it originates, so I didn't want to get into it. Hence why I did an ""alternative"" look--- with a literal skull :)  For paints, I'm using a Flash Palette knockoff. I won't recommend the brand, because I'm not sure about the ingredients but it's what I can afford right now and my face hasn't melted off yet. With that an my palette, I can make any colour under the sun :)"
sfx,386ohw,thesadbubble,5,Tue Jun 2 16:35:41 2015 UTC,"You're very welcome, I'm glad it was helpful. I think the paint is a good idea, you can get some excellent looks without needing to add 3D.   I'm from Canada and don't know many Mexican people and don't know how to use that aesthetic without being appropriative.    For what it's worth, this has come up a lot on /r/makeupaddiction, and people who live in S. America and/or celebrate Dia de Muertos pop up every now and again. The response I see every time is 'as long as you're not using it to ridicule, go right ahead'. Perhaps some people mind, but the vast majority of people complaining about appropriation don't actually celebrate the holiday themselves.  Bindis are another funny one. In some areas there is now no religious significance to a bindi - they are worn simply as a fashion statement. I had a penpal in India for many years and she sent me bindi to wear as they were the 'in thing' in her area. I live in Scotland. To her decorative bindis were something fashionable to share, like I might send her a tartan skirt. Worth noting here that I have  also had a bindi applied at a family event where it had a more serious connotation related to their Hinduism, although I am not Hindu. It depends greatly on the context.   I think most of the internet knows 'that palette' by now haha. Someone did a comparison of them and they seem to be extremely similar, so you're probably safe."

We use much larger gauge tubing than you would think necessary most of the time. The thinner the line, the thinner the blood has to be. If you wanted to do something like stringer71's link, you essentially need a flowing blood that has been thinned with water or glycerine, depends on what you are using as your blood medium.  My rig for this would be a large gauge irrigation syringe with surgical tubing that fits over the nozzle. Keep the blood in the syringe and keep it lower than the bleed location so gravity doesn't do your job for you. In all honestly, every makeup artist worth their salt that I know carries a blood kit, even the straight makeup people. You might hit them up.  Here's a great brand of flowing blood I have used before, or you can mix your own: http://www.paintandpowderstore.com/proddetail.php?prod=MM-1094  edit: Added link to ICU flowing blood."

I can't really see anything wrong with the application, I'd just suggest to go a little further with everything! Some deeper contrast, deeper blacks around the eyes and a stronger fade up the forehead and perhaps more carved cheekbones would have framed the face a bit nicer; though I can see that some effort was made to get that effect. I'd just say to go further!  Regarding the lips, you have fantastic, healthy, moisturized lips, and sadly none of that helps your makeup. I love the red marks that you added around the lips and I would have loved even more to see some highlights placed around them to increase the depth. Overall, I think the color of the lips might have done better if it were on the pale tan/orange/yellow side of things.

That's all it really takes to make basic wounds. Also fake blood. You can buy this in many different textures and colours, from dried to runny and dark red to fresh, bright red. Or look up recipes for homemade blood, a lot of wich are safe to use in the mouth."

What might help progress the look is if you break up the skin tone a little more using a stipple sponge.  As you age your skin tone becomes less even (age spots being the primary example.  Also skin thins so veins may be more prominent).

sfx,355nh2,Blue_Fairy,2,Thu May 7 08:59:31 2015 UTC,Yep..... I like that a lot! Looks really nice!!! Would you go a little bit more into detail for me about how you did this?
sfx,355nh2,Blue_Fairy,2,Thu May 7 13:14:10 2015 UTC,"Sure thing :) Basically I went to a hardware store and bought a piece of whiteboard laminate which I got cut down into smaller blocks so I could create a few sculptures on each mold. Then I sculpted my bullet wounds using Monster clay. Once I was satisfied with the sculptures I created a flattened wall around each bullet wound to contain the sculpture- I made this with Monster clay too because I've been too poor to buy Klean Klay at the moment.  I then sprayed the sculptures with my knock off version of Crystal Clear spray to protect my sculptures. I only did a light coat and let that dry completely.  I used poster board to make walls around the area that I wanted to make into one mold and then hot glued it to my whiteboard. I made sure all the corners and edges were sealed with clay and hot glue so no silicone could seep out.   Once my mold was ready to be poured I mixed my silicone and catalyst together and poured it into my mold to cast it. Even though I poured it from a height I got air bubbles on the bottom of my mold (not the sculptures which is lucky) because I don't have an evacuator. I let the silicone set for 24 hours.  The next day I peeled my mold off my sculptures carefully. I then mixed some bondo together (pros aide and cabosil) and put a generous amount in each sculpture on my mold. I then used acetate and placed it over the top of the bondo and used a palette knife to smooth it out evenly as best as possible. Chuck it in the freezer for 2 days.  2 days later - carefully pull your acetate and bondo out of the mold. You should now have a bondo positive stuck to your acetate. I like to leave this out for a day so it defrosts. The next day, take a sponge and stipple a light layer of pros aide all over your appliance. Then get waterslide paper and place your pros aided appliance down onto your waterslide paper- so that your appliance is on the shiny side of the paper.   Leave this overnight. When you want to apply your injury, peel the acetate off so your appliance is just on the waterslide paper. Place it on your model and use a dampened powder puff on the paper so the water soaks through. This will release your appliance onto the skin.  Hope this helps :)"

My favorites are kryolan aquacolor and supracolor palettes (because I find they're typically a bit gentler on the skin).  A six pan palette of aquacolor is $32 (and generally a better deal than buying individual colors) and should last you a fairly long time.

sfx,32kg1j,cosplaythrowaway2,2,Tue Apr 14 14:44:27 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Wig maker here - there are ways around this problem when you're building facial hair (or a wig) but they won't really help you with this.  My advice is to trim the lace as close to the edge of the hair line as you feel comfortable (this will mean splitting the mustache in two but it will look way better!) and use a little bit of tinted loose powder to conceal any lace that really stands out. (I recommend Ben Nyes Belle Visage powders).   The only other fix I can think of would be to find a prismacolor marker that matches you skin tone and color in the lace. It will wash off but if you're only wearing this once or twice it won't be too much of a hassle.   Hope this helps, good luck!"

From there she can pass out business cards and suggest doing Halloween makeups and such for family/friends.   Idk if there's a theme park by you and your friend but I got some of my earlier work being an assistant for Six Flags Fright Fest. I was able to network there and met some great people. I also did my brothers monster makeup for a horror convention and was able to put my work out that way.   Networking is the most important part when you're starting out. Networking and creating great relationships with clients.  Another good way to have her showcase her work is the 100 days of makeup challenge on Instagram. Every single day for 100 days straight have her do something SFX related. It's a challenge but it gets people used to your face and seeing your work.

She can always get experience doing student and independent films too, but this will often be as a volunteer and as a makeup artist can cost a fair bit out of pocket for supplies.  There are also a lot of good text books out there that will help her get some basic techniques down. This is an especially good one. http://www.amazon.ca/Special-Makeup-Effects-Stage-Screen/dp/0240809963/ref=cm_lmf_tit_1  Good luck to her!"

I've had the honor of seeing a number of fantastic artists work their magic. A few have graduated to the ""next level"" - working artists. In the end,  networking and self-promotion move them forward. I won the first contest; the second winner moved to Hollywood to work as a full time artist. Our third was already a champion body-painter. Fourth year owns his own fx company in Canada; last year's winner competed 3 times with our contest and finally took top prize. He works locally as an effects artist on movies, tv, private hires, etc.  We too had a fantastic young man who was 14- and he took second among the five artists. My advise to his mom was encourage him in every aspect of art- drawing, painting, anything creative. When she hits 16, look for local effects companies that need an apprentice (typically shop work).   There's no formula for assuring her success, but I've met awesome people who've followed many a path to get there."

sfx,30rhsx,wardofwarning,3,Mon Mar 30 02:12:35 2015 UTC,With wax you have to stick  it down with spirit gum or pressed first. When working with it also try to touch it as little as possible as warmth will melt it and make it goopier and harder to work with. Keep a lotion or vaseline close by and coat your fingers and tools in it  lightly to keep the wax from sticking to anything while you work with it. once you have it in place coat your fingers with more lotion or vaseline and smooth it don. works surprisingly well.
sfx,30rhsx,teamsparia,2,Mon Mar 30 04:38:38 2015 UTC,"Can you post pics of what you're trying to do and what you're using? There are a lot of options when it comes to SFX makeup and without a visual aid it's hard to know what your best bet is.   I would recommend looking into silicone and pros aid. You'll get the best look, but it's the most labor intensive and requires some casting/sculpting.   Wax is hard to blend out but if you put spirit gum on your skin and on the wax you may have luck getting it to stick. Keep a small glass of cold water at hand and frequently dip your finger into it as you pull and shape the wax."

sfx,2zya2c,2dollarb,8,Sun Mar 22 23:07:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Keep in mind this tutorial i learned was taught by the instructing of someone who works in film & TV and was just a department head for makeup for Netflix's new series, 'Bloodline' so if you're looking to do this RIGHT, then here's your answer.  So first you're going to need GELATIN. When creating this, you need raised skin. Raised sloppy melted skin. And the gelatin you get for sfx comes in slabs that are stored in bags. So you cut a little up and heat it up for ten seconds until it melts. It's REALLY FUCKING HOT so you need to stir and wait for about five minutes because holy god you will burn yourself or whoever you're doing it on pretty badly.  From there you slather it on in large areas with a palette knife that you can get from any craft store and make the skin ultra raised and messy. Just make sure you get your edges down! You can get witch hazel from CVS or walgreens and heat it up and apply it to a q-tip to help smooth down the edges if it dried too quickly. It helps blend it perfectly.  Then you're going to slather caster oil (also CVS) on top of it and then rip a tissue into ONE PLY, scrunch it up and then lay it completely on top of your gelatin.  Let it dry for a moment and then take a makeup sponge and LATEX and DAB, (DAB, NOT STROKE) on top of the entire creation and around your skin until it dries. From there take tweezers or your fingers and pinch holes in your creation to create the giant crater burns.  And from there you just paint. I used an Illustrator Palette. Blood tones, aged blood tones and black and painted it on with sponges i picked apart and brushes. you can paint the craters yellow and then slather caster oil on top to give it that disgusting effect and then you're done.  Having actual pictures of gore really help you. Study them, too!"

For that tearing effect, if you invest in some gelatin, ripping one ply of tissue paper on top and then ripping at it will make it neater!

sfx,2zt5re,geminyoureye,5,Sat Mar 21 15:00:29 2015 UTC,"The wound looks great!  Improvement:  The stitches don't appear taut.  If you look through some photographs of actual sutures you will notice a definite pattern.  The pattern is closely grouped and taut sutures with a distinct long thread V at one end.  All of the sutures will follow this pattern.  The V is standard.  Keep working, keep playing.  Your work's looking good!"

I'd also recommend looking at reference pictures of stiched wounds, that way you can make sure your being anatomically correct. At the moment the wound is still to open for a stiched wound. Nicely blended and coloured though."
sfx,2zt5re,falconvic,3,Sat Mar 21 17:38:46 2015 UTC,Great job! Im curious as to what you used for the cut because it blends really nicely into the skin.
sfx,2zt5re,captainlazypantzz,3,Sat Mar 21 16:27:19 2015 UTC,In my opinion you should use latex sculpted prosthetics for the most realistic stitches because you can get some pull in the wound and make it look very real. But the wax looks beautiful! It's just not strong enough for great stitches.
sfx,2zt5re,kaylahatesmustard,2,Sat Mar 21 19:03:44 2015 UTC,When you say prosthetic you're referring to the entire wound right? I'm just starting to work with silicone prosthetics so I'm excited to see what I can accomplish there.
sfx,2zt5re,coloneltuxedo,2,Sun Mar 22 15:06:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for all the feed back! I totally agree with the tautness of the stitches (or rather lack there of).  This was my first time trying this out and I was going for a kind of open look, just for fun.  Next time I'll definitely try keeping the wound together more and I'll get those stitches in a more consistent pattern.    As for what I used, it was Ben Nye nose and scar wax over spirit gum and then sealed with Graftobian wax sealer.  It actually created quite a strong finish in comparison to when I have tried this without the sealant. For colouring I used a variety of colour wheels: Trauma, Injury, and Bruise from Graftobian and Ben Nye.  There are some good ""skin"" tones in the first two that I used to blend with my own skin.   Thanks again!"

sfx,2zntj4,GeekAndBeyond,3,Fri Mar 20 03:09:29 2015 UTC,"I believe the easiest and cheapest route would be alginate, plaster bandages, and whatever you're choosing to make the actual piece from (depending on what you're using it for and how much you're planning on casting e.g. simple face cast or full bust). That'll allow you to make a quick, detailed, one-time cast. You don't necessarily need to use silicone unless you plan on making multiples. You'll also probably need a friend or two (again, depending on the size), a bald cap if you have hair, Vaseline or something similar to cover eyebrows and lashes, and whatever you're using to mix in and with."

I just got mine, it doesn't come with the silicone thickener/thinner that the instructions recommended, and you'll need a bald cap.

sfx,2zntj4,Bellestrange,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:22:24 2015 UTC,"Alginate is great if you are only casting a face. The problem with alginate is you have a very small amount of time, to sufficiently cover the area you want to cast. Once it sets, you're done! whether you've covered everything well enough or not! You can't really add to it either. In addition you have to use the alginate mold to make the head cast within an hour, because the alginate dries out and shrinks quickly! At least when using body double silicone, you can take your time, evenly and carefully covering the area with ease! You can also add to it once  it sets, if necessary. This kind of silicone is great for a full head cast! I would rather spend the extra money on this product! The other great thing about is that the mold can be reused many times after! So, If you break your ultracal head cast, you can easily make another with your silicone mold. Heres what you will need! 4pint kits of body double silicone, 10 rolls of plaster bandages, body double release cream(apply especially well over the brows and lashes.) vinyl bald cap(you can not use latex with silicone, it inhibits curing)If you are going to wear gloves make sure they too are not latex! I rarely use alginate anymore."

Repeatedly dab the sponge around the edge of the prosthetic. Add small amounts to the tip of the sponge. You do not necessarily want to use a lot.  Let it dry, and do it again if you need to in order to get the seamless look. It's better to do this in layers to get thin seams - if you have the time."

Before you release the stretch and after the product is dry be sure it is well powdered.

For materials, RD407 Latex for the mask, etc - go to MonsterMakers.com  MonsterMakers supplied materials to Batman Begins, Narnia, (its owner credited in a Oscar speech) Some of the top mask makers in the business use their RD407 Latex, there is little reason to go elsewhere if you are in the US. Casey Love and Jordu Schell right off the bat I believe use this location as their go to for mask latex.   As a free resource, One of the most thorough, unfortunately hidden gems of a Mask Making tutorial is over on Pete Infelise's website - Guide to Making Monster masks  Please if interested do yourself a solid and check out Pete's tutorial, it offers so many tips on the process in such a clean format, very hard to beat!

sfx,2yv3pa,toxicshlock,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:55:14 2015 UTC,"Mask making is incredibly complex, many steps and costly no matter what material you use.   Starting with the cheapest you would need a body form(bust), wed clay, sculpting tools and a lazy Susan. Just for sculpting. That doesn't include doing your own life cast so masks can fit to your face  Molding you would need plaster  and knowledge of Molding something to not lock your mold. And casting material could be silicone or latex. Each of these steps get more costly from here depending on the mask, a prosthetic or application.   I don't want to deter you from pursuing it but it requires a good chunk of change and a place you can get messy with.

The reason I say it's so high is because in the long run even if you screw up its cheaper to buy in bulk than rebuy a million little kits of the supplies you need. And bulk is a loose term.   First you need to figure out if you want to make masks that fit everyone's face or just your face, so you need that bust I mentioned or find someone to do your life cast.

sfx,2yp4xp,iz24,7,Thu Mar 12 01:55:06 2015 UTC,Hey friend! Sorry everyone on this apparently rude subreddit decided to downvote you instead of possibly offering help! You should head on over to r/redditlaqueristas! They should be able to offer some more helpful suggestions! :)
sfx,2yp4xp,HoopDancer,9,Wed Mar 11 19:31:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  Really, thanks so much for even taking the time to write me a nice note. It's nice to know there are some humans out there."
sfx,2yp4xp,HoopDancer,3,Wed Mar 11 19:38:21 2015 UTC,"I second the gel nail recommendation & the advice to not go for acrylic. I have never tried gel, but I did try acrylic years ago. It's a vicious cycle because the acrylic will make your nails impossible to bite but it makes your nails flimsy, weak & prone to breakage... So you'll end up getting acrylics again to cover up your weak nails that were made weaker by the acrylic application!   The gel is much more gentle although it usually costs more. At my local nail salon, a gel manicure with gel polish on your regular nails (no extension past what your current nail growth is) costs $25. An acrylic set (tips that are molded past your nail bed) costs $40 & a fill-in is $29. A gel set is $65 & a fill-in costs $42.   Don't be alarmed -- I live in NYC, so everything is obscenely more expensive, but I just wanted to give you an idea of what to expect in terms of a price difference between acrylic & UV, despite UV gel being your better option. If your main concern is just getting a little bit of natural nail growth, I'd recommend just getting a gel manicure & skipping the tip extension. It'll last about 2 weeks before your nail growth is really noticeable.   You should also invest in some cuticle butter. There's one by Burt's Bees that's a good drugstore option, & LUSH's Lemony Flutter is more expensive but absorbs faster/doesn't leave you as greasy as Burt's Bees in my opinion. Sorry for the wall of text! Hope this helps :)"
sfx,2yp4xp,LazagnaAmpersand,2,Thu Mar 12 02:49:13 2015 UTC,"No apology necessary. That's all very good advice. I think I'll have to go for some sort of extension, as my ""nails"" are a good 1/4 inch away from my finger tips. They money is simply required for a month or two to get over this hump. It is what it is. :( but true  edit: afterthought: you wrote ""(no extension past what your current nail growth is)"". Is that really the way it is? Because I got so very very little. I guess I'll not only have to learn about gels but also about when one should/should not get an acrylic extension. Wow. So much new stuff to learn that I never thought I'd have to. Thanks for the advice!"
sfx,2yp4xp,LazagnaAmpersand,3,Thu Mar 12 02:52:23 2015 UTC,"It comes down to preference, cash, and time. See how much certain services are in your area and think about how often you will need a fill or polish change. How much time are you willing to sit to have your nails done? These are things to concider.   Gel polish are a polish that cures with a UV lamp and lasts up to two weeks. Just like enhancements they have to be well kept to ensure they work for the strength your wanting - also to keep them looking nice.  Nail wraps are another option for you. The nail bed is covered with a strip of silk, paper, or fibreglass that is adhered to the nail with an adhesive (nail glue essentially). These are great for people who don't want acrylics or hard gels since they look and feel more natural.   Acrylics nails, first off, do not damage your nails if applied and cared for correctly. Just do a little research on nail techs in your area. Do not go to the cheap places. You get what you pay for. They may feel wierd at first but are great if you want long nails without the hassle of growing them. Also acrylics are the only way I stop biting my nails.   Hard gels are like acrylics but the substance is a gel which is cured under uv light. These gels cannot be soaked off like acrylics and must be filed off. So these are more of a long term option.   All of these options require monthly to bi - monthly fills.   Source: I'm a nail tech."

sfx,2yoir7,kayleesstrawberry,2,Thu Mar 12 19:20:13 2015 UTC,"Glad to be of help. As an added note I forgot to mention earlier, it may seem counter-intuitive, but put some colour, or better said, tone, in there. In my example I gave your knee part a slight nudge into a more blueish spectrum. Makes it seem more artificial in contrast to the normal skin-colour.  I'd even go so far as maybe doing the ""50"" in yellow, just to add some even more artificial highlight. Anything that says ""this is not skin"" helps the illusion."
sfx,2yott9,BlindEvolution,2,Wed Mar 11 16:04:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe try to think about what kind of wound you're trying to create. Obviously tearing the cheek away, exposing teeth.  I would suggest defining an edge of the torn skin (with liquid latex or TP and glue).   Also, people's eyes will go right to the exposed teeth, so making them look more like teeth will help sell the illusion. Look at your own molars for reference, and cut the bottom (chewing part) of the teeth to match.  As for color, you need more depth. Do this by layering dark to light (or vise versa). Also, skin tone has more than just shades of red. Use yellow (fat cells), blue lines (veins), purples, etc.  I'm not very skilled or experienced with sfx makeup, but I've done a few zombie and halloween things, and am just getting more into sfx, so hopefully someone else on here can give better tips (rather than downvoting your post)."

I greatly appreciate the critique; I unfortunatly didnt have grease paints or anything of that nature so I used acrilyic and alot of the color got lost, I've got to invest in good paints and figure out how to blend the colors so I don't lose the integrity of them. .  The teeth were a struggle, I had read about using false nails and (obvioisly) it didnt give my desired look. I will for sure have to spend time focusing on the shape of them.

sfx,2ynj7u,teamsparia,2,Wed Mar 11 06:33:00 2015 UTC,"Best and cheapest way IMO: use gluestick to flatten eyebrows. Either build up your wounds with gelatin or make some flat moulds of your wounds(sculpted in clay) and make your own gelatin prosthetics. A third, more expensive but preferable, option is using a flat mold of your wounds and making the prosthetics with something called watermelon. It's a latex alternative that can be blended seamlessly into the skin with alcohol. It comes in soft and hard. Another possibility is using third degree(or a similar silicone product) to build up your wounds."

sfx,2ynj7u,falconvic,-2,Thu Mar 12 00:12:34 2015 UTC,Why would you take on a job if you don't know how to create the effects they need? It's one thing to ask for advice when your learning / experimenting but to use other people's knowledge to get you through a job you aren't ready for is quite rude.
sfx,2ynj7u,falconvic,2,Wed Mar 11 09:00:12 2015 UTC,"I was hired for the beauty makeup, its some friends of mine doing a student film and I have always helped with the beauty and some fake blood here and there and they wanted to try something different. They aren't expecting me to put out anything incredible, but I've been practicing in sfx for a little bit and told them I could try. Thought this sub would have some info that would help me out."
sfx,2ynj7u,falconvic,-3,Wed Mar 11 09:12:27 2015 UTC,"So try...experiment and practice with different ideas. When you fail and can't make it work and have exhausted every avenue of research  (ie: books, Google etc) then ask for help. That's one of the key elements of sfx...experimenting...If you haven't even made an attempt at some research or practising people will always be less inclined to help. It's a lesson I learnt a very long time ago through other forums. People in the sfx industry are more than happy to help if you make the effort to try but otherwise why should they give out advise that they spent years training and paying for? It just comes across as rude to ask for answers when you haven't tried to find the answer yourself."
sfx,2ydaaw,jaimeofhouselanister,6,Sun Mar 8 20:33:11 2015 UTC,"Very.  Very very.  Sculpting is drawing in three dimensions.  Before you can make anything look realistic, you're going to have to learn the concepts behind making realistic looking things with your hands.    Get ready to learn."
sfx,2ydaaw,thejustducky1,2,Sun Mar 8 20:56:52 2015 UTC,"Realistically speaking, you think its possible to learn? Ive always wanted to draw but I just can't. Meanwhile there's people who it just comes to. Im really hard working I'd love to get into the indiuustry but I just can't draw well."
sfx,2ydaaw,thejustducky1,6,Sun Mar 8 21:06:29 2015 UTC,"Of course it's possible.  We didn't get good at drawing because of innate talent, it took many, many years of screwing it up before it was right.    If you don't get it right, then you keep trying to get it right until you do.  That's the difference between people who can draw and people who can't.  1% talent, 99% work."
sfx,2ydaaw,toonhole,2,Sun Mar 8 21:18:42 2015 UTC,"I would disagree that there's people who it just comes to.  I think people practice a lot, and have better habits about how they practice.  They might get better faster, but nobody is born with the knowledge of how to draw construction, color theory, rhythm, composition, etc.  You can definitely do it!  Remember it's not practice that makes you better, it's PERFECT practice that makes you better.  Don't just doodle.  Figure out the right things you need to learn to draw for the style you're going for.  I went to college for art, and a lot of the people who were the most skillful at the beginning of college (and rested on their laurels) DEFINITELY aren't the best today.  Work hard, and progress will come.  Don't compare yourself to others, compare yourself to where you were a month ago, a year ago, a decade ago.  You will grow if you put in the work!"
sfx,2ydaaw,Rnrcool,2,Mon Mar 9 06:05:00 2015 UTC,"For me personally, sculpting comes easier than drawing. So I can't say that drawing is essential to sculpting. And as far as designing goes, some people are better with programs like a brush than they are with actual drawing and vice-versa. As long as you can communicate your vision, it's fine. You just have to be able to do that."

I'd suggest practicing drawing, sculpting, painting and if you really enjoy any of those start pursuing it. Try to use real life references as much as you can because that's mainly what people look for in your portfolio.  If you do decide to go for the course there will be many other skills to learn and you may love them! Things like mould making and silicone or foam running don't require any drawing skills but you do need a practical mind.  The industry is so competitive so you really have to be passionate about what you do and be prepared to work really hard and also have a lot of time out of work.

Are you good at putting glamor makeup on yourself and other people?  If so, I would recommend purchasing some pre-made foam latex pieces on-line and learning how to apply them on yourself and friends.  Learn to glue, blend edges and paint the pieces.  This is a skill that doesn't need drawing or sculpting skills.  Being part of a crew and working on a film set is what most people enjoy.  Take pictures of your work and use that as your resume and you could find jobs (at first non-paid work) on indie film sets to build your skill set.  Even ask to just assist the artist and watch how they apply the pieces, ask questions and learn.  Go home and practice what you learned."

It consists of Pros-aide adhesive and cab-o-sil(fumed silica). you just mix the two together until it forms a paste. You go along the edges with the paste and it will fill them in and blend to the skin. then let it dry and powder it.

You can purchase RMG paints through most FX supply companies and if you want to make you own to test it just take a powder compact of your flesh shade, crush it up and add a little castor old.

sfx,2xg2fg,horrorguy,1 point,Sat Feb 28 19:59:02 2015 UTC,You absolutely  can but you need to scrub the mold with acetone really well and then use Inhibit X. That will help create a better environment  for the silicone to set. And helps if there's a little left over residue from the latex.
sfx,2xg2fg,Egghead_fx,1 point,Sat Feb 28 22:52:25 2015 UTC,"Silicone is inhibited by the chemicals in latex true.  If you coat your molds with vasaline and epoxy parafilm spray or another silicone mold release spray and incapsulate it with Baldies you should be ok.  I would experiment.  Mold release your mold, spray or paint a little baldies in it and drop a little silicone in and see if it sets.  I have used plaster foam latex mold several times with Plat-Sil Gel 10 silicone with no problems."

I put an imgur album together of some of the process:  http://imgur.com/a/RLayM  1) Sculpted onto a stone face.  2) Floated the sculpted pieces off in my bathtub.  3) Flattened the pieces out on a tile. (you could just start with this step and sculpt directly onto the tile, if you didn't have a facial positive to sculpt on)  4) Cut out the bottom of some tupperware and put them around the pieces on the tile as a ""mold wall"".  5) Poured in some hydrocal.  6) Made up some homemade gelatin, and poured that in the finished hydrocal mold.  7) Pulled out gelatin pieces, and applied them with pros-aid.  8) Painted with Skin Illustrator paints.  I should say, that this entire process (beginning to end) was completed in a day.

I roll it into tubes and place a roll around the whole thing attached with spirit gum. Then I take a spatula and flatten one side down roughly smoothing it down to meet my skin. The best way to make it smooth is to take lotion or oil and smooth out the wax with it on your fingers. It works really well for me.

sfx,2w0kus,jikajika,1 point,Sun Feb 15 22:52:59 2015 UTC,"Hey now everyone! Products used for the face, hands, and chest: Ben Nye MagicCake Aqua Paint in Licorice Black & Cloud White Products used for the suit: Soho Urban Artist Acrylic Paint in black and white.   I have officially turned into Team Ben Nye.  Their products are opaque, don't streak, a little goes a LONG way, dries quickly, won't come off without soap and water, and it's long lasting.  All that paint on my face and hands, and if you were to look at my MagicCakes, it barely looks as if I made a dent in it.   The only advice I would give for accomplishing this technique is possibly adding polyurethane to your clothing so that it maintains its shape (remains stiff) when you paint over it. Also, the paint should glide more easily over it.  We were trying to find the highlights and shadows on the clothing (without polyurethane), but as soon as you add the paint brush to it, you'd lose the shape. So if we do this next time, we'll definitely keep the polyurethane approach in mind.   As far as the background, we found graffiti artwork throughout the city and I sat in front of it, and 'click'.   Hope this helps anyone else who wants to try to do this in the future. Message me if you have any questions."

sfx,2vfmj5,caviabella,3,Tue Feb 10 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"In genral, aways start by sanitizing your hands before putting makeup on. Everything should be sanatized prior to use, so things like powders, aqua cakes, and brushes should be sprayed with 99% alchohol prior to use. Things like creams and lipsticks, I scrape off with a spatula and either transfer that to a plate or work of the spatula. You can also pour out materials into a cup -- never pouring the excess back. I never put the applicator directly into the makeup and I never double dip.  Spatula always gets wiped clean and spritzed with alch. before going back for more makeup. Things like mascara or tooth decay that come with a built in applicator should always be applied with a disposable one and again, never double dipping.   I follow these rules religiously with my makeup, for the safety of myself and others. Pink eye is a real thing and germs exist on everyone, regardless of whether it is yourself or someone you are very close to. Also, it is important to make sure your kit stays sanitary. Anything that gets double dipped into gets tossed out immediately. On that note, it is important to toss away any make up that has spoiled or changed consistancy.   Also, wash brushes, sponges and other things afterward with soap and water. And hand sanitizer is awesome stuff.   TL;DR wash everything, don't double dip."

It could conceivably be a projectile bouncing off the glass or a piece of glass though.    edit: it is indeed fired from behind the glasses:  http://i.imgur.com/jaGTi5m.jpg  and here is the shot in slow mo:  https://gfycat.com/FittingUnluckyAfricanmolesnake  Seems really dangerous.  I mean, what if the BB just bounced off the glass?"

To achieve the effect, actor Alex Rocco's glasses had two tubes hidden in their frames. One had fake blood in it, and the other had a BB and compressed air. When the gun was shot, the compressed air shot the BB through the glasses, shattering them from the inside. The other tube then released the fake blood.   http://www.moviequotesandmore.com/godfather-trivia.html"

Here are some things to consider: The bones look fake because they are perfectly straight and shiny white.  Someone already mentioned that it would actually be tendons on the service, which would be thick, red, kind of chuncky cords.  If you still wanted to do bone, bones is an off white/yellowish color with many slight curves to it.  Also, the bones just go straight down and if you wiggle the tendons on the back of your hand, you can see the angle towards each other, like this: \ | /  One last thing is the flat red behind the bones.

sfx,2tvrgk,Destruct-o-Bun,2,Sat Feb 7 03:41:42 2015 UTC,"This is a previous response I wrote about UV paint:   Kryolan have good strong UV colours but I find them very expensive. Their green and yellow are so similar under blacklight it's really not worth buying them both. The pink and orange are similar under daylight but very different under blacklight. Can be a bit harder to work with for a beginner.  Wolfe are another one who are quite pricey but good quality. I like the variation in their colours better but have the same problem with the yellow and green under blacklight. Their white is the best around though and they all look good in daylight.  Another option is the DFX neons, which are much cheaper than Kryolan and Wolfe. They don't have great variation between the pink and orange under UV but the rest are fine. The colours go on easily and look great in daylight.  TAG I can't comment on as I've never tried them. Snazaroo don't even bother, their normal colours are great but neons are worthless and a gimmick only.   The above are all water based paints, so really it depends on what kind of longevity you need as to how useful they would be. At the moment I think I only have DFX and Wolfe but if you like I can get some swatches of them under a blacklight for you to see the colours. The only UV greasepaint I've ever used is the Kryolan Supracolor. It's fine, but is there a specific reason you need greasepaint? It's generally more expensive and harder to work with for a beginner.   I wrote a post on different types of paint and their pros/cons (water, grease, alcohol) here if you'd like a read."

The interrupted is very visually distinguished.    Also most likely there are two things you could add : swelling near the base of the finger from a lidocaine injection and its whitning of the skin from the pressure(subtle and not needed most likely); iodine color.  If this isnt a self repair in the field the area would be throughly cleaned with iodine or a similar disinfectants.  Deglovings make me squirm...

sfx,2trpqu,FireWalkWithMe91,2,Mon Jan 26 22:12:01 2015 UTC,"Weird that no one replied to you yet, let me help if you still need it.  You will definitely need a bald cap, but a good bald cap that will last all night will cost you in the $20 to $40  range. Latex sticks to latex, but plastic (vinyl) caps cover your real hair better and last longer. Cut it to as close to your hairline as possible while still being able to adhere it to your skin without getting hair caught in the adhesive.  A note on adhesive, do NOT, under any circumstances, use Spirit Gum. It is weak, messy, and dated. Use prosaide or telesis to ensure it stays on all night.  I also wouldn't use crepe hair unless you have a hackle to comb it out. You're better off ""laying"" synthetic hair (the kind they sell for extensions) and then cutting to length as crepe hair requires a good amount of preparation before it looks real.  Only in this instance would I condone the use of spirit gum, specifically to lay the hair onto the bald cap. Here's a video on hair laying. This is for a beard but the  process works the same. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=netR7rr0XJs  Lastly, Wax is not going to stick to a bald cap. Wave is very rarely used because it is heat reactive to body heat and is extremely soft. Any contact will ruin the piece. You can make the carved message out of wax and then encapsulate it by painting a layer of liquid latex over it, but it will begin to look ""built up"" and unrealistic.  A better option would be an extra thick prosaide cream, which is prosaide thickened with a flocked silica product called ""Cabosil"". This is known colloquially in the effects world as ""bondo"". It is very thick, can be sculpted thin, and adheres to latex like a dream. You need to add fleshtone universal tint to it that matches the bald cap when mixing. It then dries over time but gives you a few hours of working time to get it right.  For the beard issue, just apply a nice layer of Vaseline to your sideburns before putting on the bald cap and also in your hair line. This won't completely alleviate having some hairs pulled but it will help."

I normally only apply profit if it something for my product line and I will be selling lots of.  That's worked out by finding out what it cost you to make per item and adding a percentage to it. Example your total materials is £30 but you've made 3 prosthetics with this so each has cost you £10 to make.  The normal retail profit minimum is around 40% so in this case the total to make one would be £14.

sfx,2sb54a,Sawcyy,0,Tue Jan 13 20:53:58 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say silicone was the next step up from latex...more like leap. What about using gelatin or at a push a wax like Ben Nye nose and scar wax? There's loads of recipes online for prosthetic gelatin or you can buy it ready made from sfx shops. I wouldn't mix either with cotton though as it would be unnecessary to create effect.
sfx,2s8p7a,drawnimo,2,Tue Jan 13 03:17:40 2015 UTC,Except latex. Silicone  won't stick to latex. Latex inhibits it from curing.
sfx,2s8p7a,Meepmeeperson,1 point,Tue Jan 13 15:53:17 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add that is definitely true for Platinum cure silicones. However, Tin cure silicones aren't all inhibited by latex. Sulfur is the worst for both types though.  For reference for others even using latex gloves when mixing/pouring/injecting platinum can be risky.  I only use nitrile gloves now.  A bust that had sulfur clay on it a LONG time ago was, cleaned/scrubbed and clear coated. Yet, still it inhibited cure of a mask.  Keep it separate."

They come with a ton of mixing pigment too. Once you've built the prothstetic you can keep them for later and re apply them for future looks.  They bend and move really nice.

I did a face paint of the same idea awhile back (basically copied this), but it's nowhere near as terrifying.   I think it might look a little more convincing if you brought the blood farther up the fingers, since if they had actually clawed out from your head they would be less clean. Putting concealer over your lips would also make you look more washed out, if that's what you're going for."

sfx,2qxlpl,TartofDarkness,4,Wed Dec 31 17:13:22 2014 UTC,"Hello!   Please review this instructional guide that uses proper materials form Smooth On:Alja-Safe® Crystalline Silice-Free Alginate is suitable for making temporary molds of the face, hands and other body parts  Whatever you do, never apply plaster for mold making directly on your skin. It goes through heated chemical changes, as does plaster of Paris, gypsum cement, etc that can harm, burn and graft itself to your skin. Direct to skin Plaster bandages is not recommended - and the detail it will capture is poor. However, with alginate as your detail layer, and plaster bandages as your backing ""mother mold"" hard shell layer you will be good to go.   Alginate is soft, skin safe - and was the more cost effective go to for skin contact, and captures details nicely. It is a one time use product, as it generally tears after you fill it with your stone positive. The more common product now is a skin safe silicone, which can be reused for multiple castings but is a bit more pricey. It's bright blue and you will see it pop up and many instruciton or tutorials on the subject. body double silicone"

I don't want something temporary (which is what alginate seems to be). I want a permanent hard mold I can store in my closet and have to sculpt on anytime for prosthetic practice. How do you do that skin safe?  Thanks for your response!"
sfx,2qxlpl,EricHart,2,Wed Dec 31 17:41:45 2014 UTC,"If you go the alginate route, you typically make a mold of your head in the alginate, than immediately fill the alginate mold with plaster. You now have a plaster cast of your head, which you can make a mold of using any material you wish.  If you use the skin safe silicone, then you skip making the plaster cast. The silicone mold is your final mold that you can make multiple casts from."

sfx,2qjjpr,behvin,1 point,Sat Dec 27 18:18:53 2014 UTC,More blending is all really (especially on the yellow). A cotton ball with a little 99% alcohol on it will do the trick with some strategic light dabs. Lookin good so far
sfx,2qjjpr,ImNotCrazy44,1 point,Sat Dec 27 19:47:42 2014 UTC,A little goes a long way. So be careful how much you put on as it might end up looking like it's over done. Other wise I really like the colouring!

Oh, and I suppose you could also grab a stipple sponge with a little bit of darker purple and put a VERY light amount of burst capillaries near the center of the bruise.

sfx,2pq0vl,ofStarStuff13,4,Thu Dec 18 21:28:26 2014 UTC,"Spirit gum is awful. What your going to need for your application is an adhesive called pros-aide it's a medical adhesive and only comes off with alcohol so it's a little better at being sweat and water resistant. It must be applied by putting it thinly on the skin, then the prosthetic wait till dried clear and tacky,then apply."
sfx,2pq0vl,Sawcyy,4,Thu Dec 18 22:17:41 2014 UTC,And pros-aide II is pros-aide on steroids but extremely expensive. I prefer beta bond to pros-aide though because it is thinner and dries faster.
sfx,2pq0vl,NewToSociety,3,Fri Dec 19 05:48:04 2014 UTC,"If spirit gum won't work for whatever reason (I first recommend applying the spirit gum and letting it sit for a few mins to get tacky before gluing...) you next best bet is prosthetic adhesive or pros-aide. It's a contact adhesive so you should apply to the skin and whatever you're gluing and allow to dry before making contact. Once it's on,  it's on, don't reposition it! You'll need Bond Off or Detachall to remove it and it doesn't remove like spirit gum: you'll need to apply the bond off and let it soak in for a few mins, the pros-aide will get softer and start to loosen to the point you can peel the piece off. Then re-apply the bond off the the residue on your face and let it soak in until you can wipe it off (thus might take some time). It's important not to scrub this residue off because can damage your skin and if you have to apply this multiple times irritated skin is only going to get more irritated."
sfx,2pq0vl,lloydmandrake,2,Fri Dec 19 01:10:36 2014 UTC,"Try Telesis 5 by PPI. It's been used on every professional shoot I have been on to hold bald caps, prosthetics, etc to stunt doubles during action sequences. It is so adhesive it will actually take off a layer of skin removing it if you don't use telesis thinner, so remember to get that as well! Nothing else comes even close to the bond you'll get from it.   PPI also makes beta bond, but Telesis is quick and comes off with a single swipe of a thinner soaked cotton ball, allowing for quick changes which can be essential for stage.   Just stay the hell away from spirit gum. It is beyond worthless for anything but amateur production and I've known effects supervisors who have fired applicators for even suggesting it.  http://www.ppi.cc/artsci_adhesives_thinners.htm"
sfx,2pq0vl,Evi1bo1weevi1,2,Fri Dec 19 07:18:04 2014 UTC,"Agreed, Telesis 5 or even 7 (they don't have 7 on the website yet) is the best. Telesis 5 is thick & useses a Thinner (sold separately) to thin it out. Telesis 7 is like they mixed the glue & thinner together.  This is a medical adhesive we also use heavily in the Film/Tv industry.  It stands up to sweat, 12+ hours of wear & holds up in hot Texas summers. Work fast with this stuff, it evaporates fast! So do get you a good solvent bottle ( little clean glass or plastic paint mixing jar with a good seal screw on lid from the hobby store) & mix your glue in that to work from.  Do make sure you get a remover! SuperSolv is the remover you want & need. You can put some in a spray bottle or squirt bottle to aid in removal.  You will also want some warm washcloths to help release the adhesive little booger balls that  form, plus the warm washcloth just feels nice.  You can order stuff from Premier Products Inc.,  Frends Beauty Supply (yes its spelled without an ""I"") FxWarehouse, &  some other LA makeup stores."

I have the fresh scab blood (its like a thick gel like substance) by Ben nye is a great investment. The scar wax by Ben nye I use, I believe its the best. If I was you I'd look into a place that your school district uses to rent costumes for school plays because that's where I get most of my makeup almost at whole sale prices. The best way to start if anything is to invest in beginner student kit and build from there. Definitely invest in the wheels too. Also on amazon there is a makeup palette that you can get for $25 that has 50 colors, its cheap and great to use for color blending."

sfx,2oj9ld,THE_DINOSAUR_QUEEN,3,Sun Dec 7 18:05:01 2014 UTC,"Creme makeup breaks down latex, that's why it looks matte and powdery and the edges don't blend. Latex is why they invented RMG, but Skin Illustrator is still the best thing for it. And use glycerine in the wounds to give them a scabby shine, if you can't find Fresh Scab. Also, remember that in a burn the most damaged skin turns white."

sfx,2nv5jr,falconvic,2,Mon Dec 1 19:16:25 2014 UTC,I wouldn't recommend using a razor blades soaking over night as you run the risk of damaging or cutting the knots. With it being human hair it's most likely that each hair has been knotted onto the lace. Alcohol won't remove spirit gum from the lace either. You need to use acetone and a makeup brush.  Use the brush to apply the acetone to the back of the moustache and gently work it in. It's best if you lay the moustache on some tissue as this will absorb the acetone and spirit gum. I then find it easier sometimes to work at it from the front as the spirit gum and acetone will go directly onto the tissue and not onto the hair/moustache. I work in a wig store so regularly clean spirit gum from lace.

sfx,2nd5ov,HarleyQuinnHope,3,Tue Nov 25 12:13:44 2014 UTC,"The texture looks good, could be smoother. I think your real needs are in color development. It needs more depth: blacks, browns, deep reds and purples will make it come to life. Using darker colors inside the cuts (which you seem to have done), blood splatters and creating a bruising effect around edges will make it stand out. In spite of that, sometimes less is more. The sheen on the blood is also a little flat; try a gel blood, especially around and inside gashes, to give it a gooey wet look.  Well done!"
sfx,2nd5ov,rhifooshwah,3,Tue Nov 25 15:20:05 2014 UTC,"Agreed. The shape of the wounds look good just need less blood, more color variety. But definitely not bad for your first try! Keep up the good work!"

I would say look for the individual parts minus the airbrush for now. You could get her some nice grease paints or if she's more advanced some skin illustrator.

If there's a started kit that's right in your price range then go for it. Make sure it comes with an instructional video. Life casting can be super fun, too. Its where you make busts and life-cast out of peoples faces, heads, arms, or whatever. Casting is a very useful skill for lots of reasons, its what most interns and new-hires start off doing in professional labs, you can also cast anything, like knives and tools and toys to (imagine a Jason Voorhees' machete but made of rubber so you can smack actors over the head with it.)

Heat in microwave for approximately 2 Minutes, mixing several times. Do not allow mixture to bubble or foam, because that’s an indication that it’s about to burn. It will change color and leave undesirable bubbles in finished appliance.  You can either fill mold and cast appliance, or pour gelatin into mold and let it cool and cure for later use.

sfx,2m1ikr,toxicshlock,2,Wed Nov 12 22:56:11 2014 UTC,"I can offer some feedback on #2 Prosthetics/masks: Both involve sculpting, molding, seaming, painting, and most importantly good design.   Sculpting in particular is the Achilles heel here, if you are not a sculptor your end result will certainly reflect that to a great degree. If you are not a painter/airbrush artist you can ruin a great sculpt. If you can not fabricate an outstanding mold then you have no end product at all.  With all your other needs and worry as you are in charge of this as a whole, I would invest in the good work that other artists spent years , decades and priceless time in education learning. Silicone masks from the 3 or 4 so shops in the USA that do this very well (about $500-600 a pop) is a very common approach that major, large scale haunts are turning to instead of just makeup. The return on this investment is savings in money from time and materials related to doing makeup and hiring someone to apply it competently, plus the end result is guaranteed amazing/high quality if you invested in a good product from the shops mentioned (CFX,  SPFXmasks, Immortal Masks) .   Silicone is a flexible, expensive material but allows your actors a degree of movement and can be taken on and off, cleaned, etc within moments.   If your budget is conservative but you demand quality, check out Death Studios, they will be the traditional latex based masks at a fantastic price point ($60-80) a pop.   Check out CFX masks for their amazing silicone masks and their lineup of somewhat affordable ready to go appliances if at all interested in the makeup route.   *Mask Making is an absolute cornerstone of FX, it demands ability in design, sculpting, mold making, painting, production, etc. Many of the very best FX artists still make masks and attend Monsterpalooza every year, showing off their creations. It is the very foundation of the SFX process in many regards and if you are good at it - will translate fantastically to makeup based, prop or appliance SFX for film or theater (and Haunts!)."

You will need regular gelatin powder (knox), glycerin (which you can get in any superstore or pharmacy), and water.   Mix equal parts of each ingredient, starting with the gelatin, then the glycerin, and then the water. I like to use 4 tbsp of each.   Mix well and microwave in 10 second intervals. The end result should have a consistency like gravy.   Put your mixture in an ice cube tray or paper cups for portioning and then place in fridge to harden.   When you are ready to use it, you can microwave the amount you're using in 5 second intervals until its like gravy again.   There are plenty of tutorials online where people use gelatin.

If you don't want it to stain, I typically add a bit of dish soap.  As for more ""dried"" blood, I've had luck with using clear hair gel mixed with food coloring. It doesn't leave a sticky mess like using food items would, but it's also not edible. It all comes down to just experimentation."

There's not much in the way of vulcan blood to reference from google images.  A lot of blood recipes include things like beetroot, chocolate syrup, etc.  but I don't know think those sort of ingredients would work well for a green coloured blood. Guess I'll just bust out some colour theory and do some experimentation. Thanks for the response!"
sfx,2ksua8,WheresTibbers,2,Thu Oct 30 20:06:41 2014 UTC,yeah try a few variations out. maybe get something to thicken the syrup so its not so runny. I've been told to add a tiny bit of blue for human blood because ours is darker and not so bright red. Might work with green?
sfx,2kqcn4,SeeRachelSmile,3,Thu Oct 30 00:04:46 2014 UTC,"Great first attempt! As mentioned, try stippling it on and layer heavier towards the middle so that your edges blend a little bit better. The veins are a tad dark but once you lay them down, dip a q-tip in alcohol and tap that along the lines. The alcohol will help diffuse some of the color and make it look like the veins are under the skin, as opposed to on top. OR the same look can be achieved if you powder over the veins!"
sfx,2kqcn4,TinyRussia,1 point,Thu Oct 30 15:17:40 2014 UTC,"Great start!   My critique would be a lighter hand, more stipple motion,  and try tissue instead of paper towel/ toilet paper :)"

And with the tissue paper,usually they come in 2 really thing layers that make one whole piece. Also the stippling  Try to rip the layers apart so you have the thinnest layers possible, then re-layer them on your skin.   And the veins look a bit rushed, but a good concept. They'd look even more awesome if more time/effort was put into veins."

sfx,2kqcn4,BananaBoatBooty,1 point,Thu Oct 30 16:04:28 2014 UTC,"Honestly, if I had done that many veins I'd probably give up and get lazy too, lol.   You have to blend as you apply layers, with each layer blend it out, because if you try blending when you already have multiple layers , or try blending when you dint first apply the latex then it will just roll like you mentioned.  Stippling is just a different method of applying makeup. It makes it look more realistic than just sweeping it on if you're trying to create bruising.   Here's a tutorial (it has a stupidly long intro) cause I dint really know how to describe it that well.   http://youtu.be/TIbR55LTUxo  Usually I use both blending and stippling."

sfx,2kqffm,Quincillas,5,Thu Oct 30 00:31:03 2014 UTC,"Quick and dirty way: take tissues and roll them into cylinders about 2 inches long and give them a good coating of liquid latex. Let them dry for a bit on wax paper. Maybe wrap the wax paper around the core of a paper towel roll and let them dry on that so they maintain a nice curve to fit on your throat later. A hair dryer can speed up the drying process.  Attach the dried tracheal pieces to your skin with whatever adhesive you prefer, then build the torn surrounding skin around that."

sfx,2kmwdd,ratsoncatsonrats,2,Wed Oct 29 03:49:18 2014 UTC,You can use ben nye neutral set or another similar product.   If you're in a pinch you can try normal covergirl or whatever inexpensive translucent powder from the makeup aisle. Grease paint will usually kinda melt together with the powder as you wear it.   Be aware that inexpensive HD powders can cause a really harsh white glare (aka flashback) so if you're going for pictures be careful.

On camera, it's a different story, but in any setting where your audience is more than about 5 feet away, they won't really be able to tell.  If you're absolutely dead-set on trying to make it work, you could play with eyeliner shapes (apply, look in a mirror from about 2-3 feet away, and let your eyes soft focus--you can see how the effect will read from a distance.  Alternately, you could paint an eye onto your eyelid and perform the sketch with one eye closed.  Again, it's not a perfect solution, but I'll reiterate that it really won't read from much of a distance.  Sorry that there isn't really much more of a solution, but it's a very small detail when you look at it from a stage-distance perspective--you'll be better served to go a little bigger with your theatrical suggestive tools (like props) and your performance to sell it."

Know that you're probably going to get bits of plaster in your clay so in some cases the cheaper clay the better. Also don't get carried away on the plaster bandage or your mask will get heavy. 3-4 layers should do it. If your worried that's not enough you might consider folding a strip of plaster bandage until it's about a 1/2"" wide and using that to reinforce the edge all the way around.

sfx,2jzpkk,5hortBu5,2,Wed Oct 22 13:46:18 2014 UTC,Sweat stop might be worth trying and 99% alcohol in a spray bottle might be easier to reactivate prosaide and clean the area. Another thing I can suggest is you get the best bond when it's prosaide on prosaide so make sure you applied to both the skin and prosthetic.

sfx,2jzpkk,Xkimberxkae,2,Wed Oct 22 17:57:50 2014 UTC,"I had this issue for a heavily prosthetic based play I was working. What we did was. Clean area with rubbing alcohol. Let dry. Apply no sweat/barrier spray. Let dry. Apply spirit gum/whatever you're using, to your face.  Let dry while doing the next step. Apply spirit gum to prosthetic. Let dry. Apply spirit gum once more.  Allow it to become tacky.  Apply prosthetic to face. Then take a qtip and touch up any weird edges."
sfx,2jxwbk,KiltNoodles,12,Tue Oct 21 23:49:07 2014 UTC,"First map out a few good areas that you want the underlying gritty texture.  Find a hobby store and grab some fine texture sand with some gritties in it like the photo.  It's used for train sets and model making.  Apply a couple layers of latex to the areas where the sand will be, going well outside the actual area.  Let it dry completely.  You don't want sand stuck right on your skin, this will create a shield.   Once that's done, apply a layers of latex to a small patch and immediately pack it with the sand.  Time is of the essence from when you apply the latex, so work little pieces at a time until all the areas are covered.  You'll probably need to hold the mixture in your hand and lower your face into your cupped hand, so you don't end up getting sand all over the place.  Hold it on there for a few minutes to make sure you get good adhesion before removing your hand.    For the peeling paint, cut some poster board up into jagged pieces and cracks and roll up the edges.  The photo is a good reference for the cracks.  Use an exacto knife to cut out the hairline cracks if you have one, every little bit of detail counts.  Take your time and get it looking right texturally before applying it to your face.  After you have some 'paint' pieces, start latexing onto your face around the edges of the sandy areas and blending back into your real skin.  You might also sand down the non-costume edges of the poster board until it's really thin so it makes for a smoother transition into your face.    Once that's done and completely dry, slap on some baby powder and white face paint.  Detail with dark browns and greens for an old moldy stone feel.  Finito."

sfx,2jv1rh,yggdrasils_roots,2,Tue Oct 28 17:29:51 2014 UTC,"Maybe a non-water setting spray? I've used hairspray before, in a light coat over the face -- though I don't recommend it. Not a super fun application process, though it does work.   If you're going to be sweating, I wouldn't personally recommend water based paints. Something that's alcohol activated would be a better choice. Kryolan is a pretty good brand - and long wearing by itself, even more so with a sealant over top."
sfx,2jv1rh,variolax,2,Tue Oct 21 05:15:46 2014 UTC,Green marble before you paint as a primer and after a setter.  Also alcohol based makeup.

sfx,2jv1rh,ratsoncatsonrats,2,Tue Oct 21 14:02:34 2014 UTC,"I would recommend Wolfe Bros. Their formula last longer than most water based paints I've used. It's a little harder to blend colors, i.e. It takes some practice to get it to work correctly, but it holds up really well.  If you can't find Wolfe Bros. Or you prefer krylon, Ben Nye, or mehron, check out liqui-set by Ben Nye - you use it like you would water when painting and it helps set the makeup.  If you're going to use one of the Marble sealers I recommend Blue Marble because it's water based and you won't need a special remover."
