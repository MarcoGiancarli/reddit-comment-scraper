phish,3e45u5,steve32x,6,Tue Jul 21 20:36:39 2015 UTC,Just don't talk to people who wear black clothes about Phish. It never ends well.
phish,3e45u5,TheDinosaurScene,4,Tue Jul 21 20:58:32 2015 UTC,"Somewhere around 10th grade I went from growing up on the Grateful Dead and R.E.M. to being obsessed with the likes of Nine Inch Nails and Tool. With the change in bands came a change of attitude and attire. It was the pre-emo days when there was no such thing, you were just the crazy dude in black fishnet and nail polish. Outcasts by choice, there was no ""group"", only 2-3 people commonly accused of being homosexual satanists.   Phish (along with Widespread Panic) were the popular bands in school, adored by the accusers. Therefore, I hated Phish. I accused them of sounding like elevator music or randomly played notes. The songs didn't have a ""deep emotional or spiritual"" meaning to me, so I scoffed. I ignored.  Now I regret. I still love all of these bands, but my own close-mindedness and teenage angst caused me to miss out on earlier shows of what would become one of my favorite bands... the dreaded p-hish.  Don't be me, young music listeners. Let tastes be decided by your ears, not your peers."
phish,3e45u5,ArbitraryCommentary,3,Wed Jul 22 01:12:31 2015 UTC,I'm usually disguised as a punk/skater. There are exceptions to every rule.

phish,3e45u5,Cosmos__X,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:21:18 2015 UTC,I think you guys are cool. Just know if I don't talk to you about Phish right off the bat that is why.

phish,3e2reg,TheGreatJatsby,3,Tue Jul 21 22:06:18 2015 UTC,Phish needs a serious overhaul in artists. This poster looks like something for an indie band.   The GD50 run had so many posters I'd proudly hang on my wall.
phish,3e2reg,bruiserbrody45,5,Tue Jul 21 15:19:32 2015 UTC,I love this poster. I would much rather have this than some played out 60's psychedelia.  Edit: To pre-emptively acknowledge that not all of the GD50 posters were that.
phish,3e2reg,TheDinosaurScene,3,Tue Jul 21 15:43:06 2015 UTC,"The 60's psychedelia fit within the Dead's style, I'm not saying that's what Phish needs. This poster is just so bland to me.

phish,3e2reg,bruiserbrody45,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:47 2015 UTC,The giant headed cat lady was just an indie looking poster though... and outside of the Dead's wheelhouse entirely if you ask me. Maiden was fair.  The triptych with the waves and stuff looks like it was drawn by a child. Super disappointed.  Although I'm glad you like them. Just not my cup of tea. I like the sparse and indie looking Phish stuff through the years.

It plays on a Dead song and fits within their style. I agree there was definitely a lot of garbage there, but they put out like 10-15 official psoters. There were a handful of awesome ones."
phish,3e2reg,bruiserbrody45,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:25 2015 UTC,Yeah those were the best... not bad really. That price! If you could live with yourself that would be a seriously lucrative line of work. Flipping posters that is.

phish,3e2pgz,kiteandkey,2,Tue Jul 21 14:46:14 2015 UTC,That has to be the most common 1st set 2nd song ever. And probably the most common song in a slot that is not an opener or closer.  I've only seen a dozen shows but I swear I've gotten a 2nd slot Moma like 2 or 3 times.

So when a friend let me know Phish was rehearsing in Portland this weekend, I instantly fell into a unshakeable daydream to sneak into the Moda Center for a sonic balm for my disappointment. And somehow the universe made it happen! I practically walked right in, with my son no less! We inconspicuously watched Phish practice for an hour and a half. An incredible experience, to say the least. Without giving away too much, I can't help but report that they are definitely about to unleash some new material (which sounded very strong). And some of their loose jams veered into Dead material. I heard China Cat Flower>IKYR and Estimated Prophet for sure. I don't know what that means, but they could easily go that direction, at least in teases, should it strike their fancy. I can't wait to find out. So excited for Summer Tour 2015!

phish,3dyyle,youngboar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:24 2015 UTC,I want to know why they are rehearsing in Portland with a full stage setup when there's no show in Portland. I don't ever recall hearing of this type of thing before. Why not just go to the venue where show #1 is.
phish,3dyyle,washufize,7,Mon Jul 20 22:57:05 2015 UTC,"it's also to make sure all the tech stuff works too. lights, rented gear, hologram jerry. etc. Probably easier to test light patterns indoors."
phish,3dyyle,hopstar,6,Mon Jul 20 23:23:09 2015 UTC,"I work in production and bands like Phish always rehearse privately before a tour. The crew leads and rigging team need to practice their routine a few times before the real deal.    When you're at a show this summer, look up, above the lighting truss/speakers and you can see the chains and motors that connect to the ceiling beams.  That's where the whole show starts."
phish,3dyyle,sal139,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:21 2015 UTC,Bands will often secure open venues for rehearsal.  Is the venue in Bend open air?  They probably want to rehearse somewhere closed.
phish,3dyyle,AbsolutelyNormalGuy,3,Mon Jul 20 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, Les Schwab is open, and in the middle of the city. I'm not surprised they picked the biggest indoor venue in the region to warm up and test the light rig."

phish,3e0sow,thoughtsadrift,2,Tue Jul 21 05:27:41 2015 UTC,I used to have a bootleg from 1995 I think. Trey sat in on a handful of DMB songs. His tone compliments their sound so well.

When the people around me vouched for me, they settled by kicking out this other kid behind me. just kicking people out left and right with no mercy and no enjoying it while they were doin it.

That goes for the Fillmore and Rams head Live too (Inner Harbor). They are more ""bar with a big band"" type of atmospheres than just concert venues where people smoke all the time without fuss. You wouldn't smoke at a bar though.  I just go outside during set break. Not a big deal. Back in the day when I was impatient and wanted to smoke at 9:30, I would at least go into a bathroom stall and pull one quick hit on my vape or one hitter as I pissed. Not in the front row though."

phish,3dzw9c,aquamauza,8,Mon Jul 20 21:49:14 2015 UTC,"Brad Sarno from Sarno Music Solutions helped Trey with some new gear prior to the GD50 shows..    from PT:   Last week I had a surprising email show up from a guitarist named Trey Anastasio regarding his gear. As he is preparing for these 3 Fare Thee Well Dead shows, he is also adding and altering some things to his guitar rig to help him get some proper sounds for that context and for certain songs. We arranged a few things for him; got him a pair of speakers to test drive, sourced for him an original/early MXR Phase 100 pedal (Candyman, Crazy Fingers, etc.), sending him a certain reverb unit to try out (can't comment on that), he ordered one of our SMS Black Boxes, and he contracted me to custom build a special version of the classic Distortion+ pedal Jerry used for so long, '76 thru '89. I happen to have a secret stash of some rare components only found in the very early versions of that old distortion pedal just like Jerry's. So while we may have slapped our initials on the box, it really is a tribute to the old classic with just a few of my personal twists.   from steelguitarforum:   Recently, Trey Anastasio consulted with me on some gear advice as he prepares to take the role of Jerry Garcia for these farewell Dead shows. I turned him on to the Purple Haze speaker, and he fell in love with them. I think he's bought 6 of them so far and is loading his main cabinets up with them and will be using them for these Dead shows. They were a nice shift away from his traditional Celestion Vintage 30 and Celestion Alnico Blue and more towards a Garcia-esque, JBL-esque tone without going full on JBL which seemed to have been too big a shift for him when trying out a K120 he recently got. The Purple seems to have a lot of what people like in an alnico JBL, but without the things some people dislike."
phish,3dzw9c,scottthorn,4,Tue Jul 21 03:53:13 2015 UTC,"The univibe you were hearing was from the Univibe he already has. Also, the phaser you are hearing is from his Digitech whammy II ""Detune"" option.   Whether or not he brings the envelope filter, I'd say no because I don't think he liked his tone that much when running through it."
phish,3dzw9c,fluffhead666,4,Mon Jul 20 22:05:28 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he was only using the envelope because it was so essential to some of the Dead's stuff (Shakedown, Estimated, etc) but I think if he really liked Jerry's envelope sound we would have heard it by now."
phish,3dzw9c,elorechoy,4,Mon Jul 20 23:02:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but it is just such an iconic sound that he might have just avoided it to no so directly ape Jerry. That barrier has kind of been breached at this point though."

I can't tell what the black slanted pedal next to the tubescreamers are but I'd guess some old distortion/overdrive? Supposed different speakers for FTW. The rest looks kinda standard for Trey, in fact a little stripped down.  Last year he was using a Fulltone Tape Tube Echo with the rig."

However, if you cannot feel comfortable without a RV that is a red flag. It will be hot in the tent. People will be loud. You will be dirty. If you have social anxiety it doesn't really matter what anecdotal evidence I provide showing how friendly fans are, you still have to talk to them.    If all that sounds ok, then go!! Everyone I know from Super had a blast (including me) and all I know going to magna are crazy stoked. They have great showers there and if you are like me and cant sleep in the heat just be up early with all the old dudes and shower up!! If the fest is too much of a jump, try and snag a NE show and just go to that! Hope you get to see them this tour!"

I'm just curious, 'cause my work for the past ten years has taught me a lot about ups tracking logs.  For instance, there are small hubs and bigger hubs, and based on a scan you can usually figure out 1 or two places it could be sitting/hiding, as long as someone didn't steal it (knowing what it is).  And if you can figure out the two hubs it could be in, you can call them directly and ask them to look around.  When it comes to the employees of UPS, the drivers tend to have the best insight as to where something is based on the tracking.  The people in the hubs and on the phone don't give two shits...."

phish,3dyc6c,RogerPedactor,10,Mon Jul 20 15:12:28 2015 UTC,"As soon as one of the four checks out, its over. There will be not ""Fare Thee Well"". I truly believe the other three would not go on for a single show if one was dead. I also dont believe there will be another ""Coventry"". I think at this point we will have Phish until one of the four checks out. Maybe they wont tour every single year or maybe it will just be a festival here and a 3-5 night residency there but I dont think they will call it quits again.  None could be replaced in a way that would make sense. Maaaaaybe Page could be replaced without altering the sound too much but I dont think so.  Also, Im in the minority that thinks Fare Thee Well didn't sound that good. I can appreciate what they did but how is a improvisational jam band supposed to gel and sound in sync with each other after only a few months practice and 5 shows?   I think Trey did a fantastic job and there were moments of greatness but on the whole Fare Thee Well (IMO) sounded shoddy.   One of the reasons Phish works so well together is how long they have played with each other. They were a fully functional ""jam band"" for almost 10 years before they really honed in their jamming skills. Lots of great shows were played from 88-92 (not too many great shows from 84-87) but Phish didn't start firing on all cylinders until spring 93.  So, to think somebody could just walk in and replace a dead member of the band is laughable.   Fare Thee Well was a bit of a last chance cash grab. Phish inst known for pulling cash grab shenanigans."

phish,3dudhp,faster_than_sound,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:36:19 2015 UTC,That's awesome. Any word on why Tony isn't playing keys for them this summer?
phish,3dudhp,faster_than_sound,2,Sun Jul 19 17:06:53 2015 UTC,"Really weird situation. He told them he was going to Europe to visit family or something, and it got to be a few days before tour time, and still no word from Tony. So they called around and finally got word from his aunt that he moved to Australia, shaved his beard, got a job there, etc, without ever telling them about it.  BUT Erikk the guy who is playing keys for them temporarily is fucking fantastic at the keys, and I dare say he fits in with playing with Caton far better than Tony ever did, seeing as Tony was a little shy and would never take charge of a jam. So you'll be pleased that their sound is still the same, and even better in some respects. Sometimes it just takes a change in the band to really take it to the next level musically."
phish,3dudhp,faster_than_sound,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:53:11 2015 UTC,Damn that's super bizarre. I'm pumped to see what Erikk is gonna bring to the table. Tony was a nice dude but I agree that he seemed a little shy musically.
phish,3dudhp,washuffitzi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:32:20 2015 UTC,"He was just shy all around, but still a really good guy. I do hope this change for him is a positive one. Sucks for the band to have to throw together a new line up at the last minute, but they fuckin killed last night, so I think it might turn out to be a positive change for them too.   Caton was talking about how Erikk took control of one jam, and you could visibly see how surprised Caton was that he didn't have to be the one in charge all the time anymore. He said last night was the first night it all clicked, seeing as that was the fourth night Erikk had ever even played with them. And he's doing a great job. Kinda stinks that he'll be going back to Skyfoot, but that makes these shows a little special."

This was an amazing addition to our trip while also using Lyft/Uber.  Denver has B-Cycle's largest infrastructure in the country and makes it super simple to get around town and have an awesome time doing it.  I am a member in my local city so it was a little cheaper for me, but non-members only cost $9 per day as long as you keep each ride under 30 mins.  Thing is, Denver has soooo many docking stations you are realistically only 10 minutes from one wherever you are.  So keep a rolling timer on your phone and remember to dock bikes at least every 25 minutes.  That way each ride stays under 30 mins and you can go everywhere for $9/day.  Also the bikes are rad and have baskets and bells.     DAM- Denver Art Museum, pretty good exhibits last year (especially the one with the red/grey foxes!!!) Denver Botanical Gardens- last year they had the Chihuly exhibit but the gardens are amazing regardless Chessman Park Cherry Creek State Park  Rocky Mountain Arsenal (right next to Dicks)  Boulder one day  16th Street Mall (also has a cheap streetcar thing)  5 Points  Great Divide (I see you did that already) Food!!!

Plus what's the point of vinyl if you listen on a so so setup? To me it defeats the purpose of analog. Of course this is just like my opinion man.  Full disclosure I'm a bit of a vinyl snob and bought a cheap setup when I first got serious about vinyl and regretted it almost immediately.

phish,3dtc10,Tragos69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:37:26 2015 UTC,"tl;dr:   buy a quality turntable first; whether that is new or vintage, you'll be glad you did.  you're eventually going to upgrade from a crosley or some entry model, so put your money to work now.    the long version (why i started cheap and why i upgraded):  good advice from /u/political_lemming here.  some of the users over on /r/vinyl can be a bit uppity at times (e.g. never type ""vinyls""...not that you would...but still), but there is a ton of great info there and generally you get good advice when seeking guidance.  I'll never tell a person what to do, but I will relay my experience as I think many folks that are getting into (or back into) this format have similar experiences.  My mom gave me a great record collection (Grateful Dead, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, etc.) when I was young.  I loved spinning the records throughout my teenage years.  I then went to college and somewhere between multiple moves within and across states, they vanished.  All this time (mid-90s) I was diving headlong into Phish and, as a byproduct, listening predominantly to live performance recordings (ah, the good old B&P days).  Vinyl as a format to me was more or less lost.  Fast forward to 2012 and I read about the then upcoming RSD release of Junta.  I saw the pictures of the packaging, etc. and thought ""holy shit, this is amazing.  I have to get it.""  I had no real concept of what RSD was aside from what I read online.  While it wasn't the ""wake up at 4am and stand in line to fight crowds of ineffectual teens clamoring for the latest Mastodon picture disc"" shit show back then that it has become these days, I still didn't really didn't grasp the supply vs. demand dynamic here.  I casually strolled into a local record shop a couple days later and was basically laughed at when I asked where I could find the Junta 3-LP set.  This was a very large record shop in a very large city.  They had gotten 2 copies and both were gone within the first hour of opening.  I was frustrated, but just as much I was intrigued.  This was a challenge and I liked it.  That said, I didn't take the plunge immediately.  Vinyl was this grain of sand that was in the back of my mind, but it was growing.    The next year, I watched the fantastic Dave Grohl produced and directed documentary Sound City about Sound City Studios in LA.  It was packed with great detail about the analog recording process and amazing stories and perspectives from artists about analog.  That was last straw.  I had to get a turntable and buy some records.  That much I was sure of.  What I wasn't sure of is how invested I wanted to be into this format, and whether or not it would become a real hobby.  Literally as soon as the credits rolled on Sound City, I was online shopping.  I was agast at some of the prices I saw for turntables.  I'm not sure why...I think there really is something to the addage of ""you get what you pay for"".  Still, spending several hundred dollars on something I wasn't sure I'd stick with seemed like overkill, so I found the Audio Technica LP-60 USB on sale on Amazon for <$100.  It got pretty good reviews.  I had seen enough, so I place the order for the turntable along with Nirvana Nevermind 4-LP Deluxe Edition Remaster (Nevermind was recorded at Sound City and featured in the doc).  I didn't even really register that I was paying nearly half the price for a single album than the turntable cost.  If vinyl as a format started as a grain of sand, this was now the pearl it produced.  I got everything setup, running the LP-60 into my Sony ES home theater amp and out through a 2.1 Paradigm L/R + sub.  Drop the needle, sit back and marvel at how amazing it sounds.    I've been buying records steadily since then, a healthy mix of new releases and reissues and pre-owned. Going to the record shop once a week or so is a highlight for me.  I love taking the time to explore, flipping through hundreds of records.  The tactile nature of the experience is great.  Talking to other record collectors and shop owners is great and inspiring and a wonderful way to find new artists.  The thrill of the hunt...finding that unicorn record, etc. is icing on the cake. Along the way, I've added some pretty valuable and rare records to my collection.  I didn't do this because they were valuable and/or rare, rather they were just these amazing pieces of audio and visual art from bands I love, and given whatever factors, in some cases are valuable/rare.  So this brings us back to turntables.  As I got involved in /r/vinyl, I started to read a lot of things that concerned me, a la /u/ferryboatbill's point below.  While some people were having problems with LP-60, mind sounded great and seemed to be performing well, but I got the sense that I was on the fortunate end of a wildly broad build quality spectrum for that model.  I read some horror stories about damage to records from these more mass-produced, value models. While I wasn't going to fall prey to fear-mongering, I was concerned that maybe I could be doing some damage, even if subtly so. At the same time, I was reading a lot of people extolling the sonic virtues of upgraded cartridges, platters, pre-amps, etc.  Again, my LP-60 sounded great, but the damage concern was the new grain of sand growing in the back of my mind.  It finally won.  So, I recently did the Massdrop for the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon DC.  I paired that with the Art DJ Pre II pre-amp and it's all running through the same amp and speaker setup described above.  The minute I opened the box and throughout the (more tedious than expected, but still fun) setup process for the Debut Carbon, the attention to detail, build quality, component quality, etc. was just light years ahead of the LP-60.  I wanted to do a side by side compare, so I decided to use Dire Straits Communique (the 180gr, Pallas plated/pressed Bernie Grundman remaster).  I spun ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" on the the LP-60 and it sounded great.  Swap a couple cords around, repeat on the Debut Carbon.  Pants. Meet shit.  WOW.  I didn't think it was possible but it was noticeably better, and after a few tweaks to the pre-amp settings, it sounded astonishingly gorgeous.  Since I've written a novella here, here is the salient takeaway. I wish I would have just bought the better turntable in the beginning. While I don't think I did any real damage to any of my records on the LP-60, I'm so much happier in every way with the Debut Carbon.  I wish I had that $100 I spent on the LP-60 back, because I'd have a bunch more records to listen to if I had spent it more wisely.    (As far as Phish records go, I've got Junta, Lawn Boy, A Picture of Nectar, Party Time, Joy, Fuego [orange vinyl] The White Tape [1st and 2nd pressing] and the NYE 95 box set and cherish every one of them.  I'm jacked up for the Rift release and love that it isn't affiliated with RSD :).  Hope this is in some way insightful."

Anything without a ceramic cartridge is already a great start. Most new turntables have built in pre-amps but many good vintage ones do not. I run a Technics SL-Q202 from a yard sale with a really nice Grado cartridge on it. Into a hagerman bugle pre-amp into an old Onkyo receiver and reference monitors. They have great guides over at /r/vinyl to help new buyers choose a good turntable. Have fun!  Edit- to say I have about $400 into the setup

phish,3dnpa6,MuttJohnson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:55:37 2015 UTC,"me neither, I was just trying to answer the dude's question"
phish,3dnpa6,weforgottenuno,-10,Sat Jul 18 04:14:38 2015 UTC,Yeah because a 90% tax rate is completely fair.
phish,3dnpa6,Jakesta7,6,Mon Jul 20 04:22:19 2015 UTC,"You are taking that completely out of context and frankly I think you are being dishonest.  Bernie was asked if he thought that a marginal tax rate on the highest income earners of 90-91% that was present during the Eisenhower administration was too high.  He said no.  This rate was also only on income earned over $400,000 with inflation is around 3.6 million dollars today.  I agree an income tax rate of 90% on anyone would be unfair, but a marginal tax rate on income earned over 3.6 million dollars seems a little less ridiculous."
phish,3dnpa6,learn2burn,6,Tue Jul 21 03:26:55 2015 UTC,"In this person's defense, it would be reasonable to assume that they are truly ignorant about what ""marginal tax rate"" actually implies. There do exist people who do not understand that the ""stated"" tax rate only applies to the portion of your income in that bracket. Pundits, ""uncle Jim"" and politicians intentionally qualify these things this way to keep these folks in the dark.  Claiming that a politician wants to tax someone 90% on their entire earnings sounds atrocious (and it would be). But, believing that to be what is being proposed is sadly all too common."
phish,3dnpa6,Whats_The_Use,4,Sat Jul 18 02:07:24 2015 UTC,I completely agree. I think a lot of the time I assume people know what they are talking about and are being purposefully dishonest and I jump down their throats.  I think I should do less of that.
phish,3dnpa6,learn2burn,2,Sat Jul 18 03:36:42 2015 UTC,What if I just think a 90% marginal tax rate is still fucking ridiculous and will only lead to tax evasion?
phish,3dnpa6,TheReaver88,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:12:10 2015 UTC,"Very probably, but those who have the means and inclination to engage in tax evasion would likely do so even on 10% as 10% of a million bucks is $100K, wouldn't you at least consider it?"
phish,3dnpa6,Whats_The_Use,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:42:52 2015 UTC,"Not at the risk of prison time, no. When studying actual economics, we tend to recognize that people make decisions at the margin. Nobody is going to evade taxes all the time. Take it to the extremes at 99% and 1%. Lots of people will evade taxes at 99% marginal rates, and very few people would do so at 1%."
phish,3dnpa6,TheReaver88,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:42:33 2015 UTC,"Are you an economics major?  Edit: Also, ""tax evasion"" is a pretty broad concept and involves many legal avenues which would not include risk of jail time. In terms of decision making at the margin, if one can spend 10% of what they would pay in taxes to avoid paying them decision makers will likely choose that option."
phish,3dnpa6,Whats_The_Use,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:25:30 2015 UTC,"PhD candidate, yes. And yeah, tax evasion is a broad term, but it could easily be rephrased as any reduction in labor or capital supply and the thought experiment works."
phish,3dnpa6,TheReaver88,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:14:05 2015 UTC,I understand that as income tax increases the motivation to earn decreases and the motivation to avoid these taxes increases.  I would like to say two things in response to that though I don't think that he would be able to raise the marginal tax rate to that level and I also think that the likelihood of a person to break a law does not single handedly justify not making that law.
phish,3dnpa6,learn2burn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:28:12 2015 UTC,"I also think that the likelihood of a person to break a law does not single handedly justify not making that law.   It does if a lower marginal tax rate would have only a slightly negative (or even positive) impact on tax revenue, since a lower marginal rate will inevitably have a positive impact on growth."
phish,3dnpa6,TheReaver88,-4,Sat Jul 18 13:38:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, I am taking it out of context. But, I don't want anyone as POTUS that thinks a 90% rate is OK. That's just my opinion. He does have some notable views."
phish,3dnpa6,Jakesta7,6,Sat Jul 18 14:53:56 2015 UTC,"That is fine I think at a certain point a high tax rate does discourage earning extra income, but I also think that the marginal tax rate for the highest income individuals should be greater than 39.6%.  I don't think that he would be able to make the tax rate 90% on the highest earner, but if that is sticking point for you I understand.  I also think when talking about it you should say marginal tax rate rather than tax rate because that gives a fuller picture."
phish,3dnpa6,learn2burn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:23:12 2015 UTC,"Are you familiar with the motivations and rationale associated with a progressive marginal tax rate? While a 90% tax rate sounds punitive and might be off-putting, in context it isn't nearly as irrational as you might think."

I really appreciate your spirit...I believe strongly that being in the right state of mind is paramount to being well physically.  In 2005 I had undergone surgery to remove a tumor and during nearly the full month of radiation therapy following the surgery, I willed myself to the Austin City Limits music festival.  My body was weak and battered (and the ""dust bowl"" ACL year didn't help), but it didn't matter....I was seeing many bands I love play live and my spirits couldn't have been higher.  I got the ""all clear"" news about 2 months later.  I'm confident you'll have similarly positive news soon too!"
phish,3dnj9z,Somanatin,2,Fri Jul 17 22:38:54 2015 UTC,"I've always held the same belief. If YOU feel good mentally, it has to somehow translate to getting better physically.

Sorry that's not included in the YouTube link I posted!  I think - and someone will fact-check me on this - but I think that Maze is this one from 12/11/1997 at the Rochester War Memorial.  I have turned on many people (helps if they're either musicians of music fans) to Phish by asking them to listen to this Maze and focus on the interplay among the band.  I've been listening to them and seeing them for almost 25 years now and Maze always amazes me (groan) because these guys are all playing such vastly different parts that somehow fit together to make the whole greater than the sum of those parts."

phish,3dlh23,TheGreatJatsby,7,Fri Jul 17 11:21:13 2015 UTC,"Glorious, glorious Friday. Hitting up Primus/Dinosaur Jr tonight, which will probably be my last show before Magnaball. Gotta save that scrilla.   I'm pretty excited for tonight, but I can't imagine how excited I'm going to be the week leading up to Magna. I'm predicting little sleep and plenty a stomach-butterfly."
phish,3dlh23,noraamitt,4,Fri Jul 17 11:52:04 2015 UTC,Dude I'd LOVE to see Dino Jr... Pretty jelly
phish,3dlh23,TheGreatJatsby,3,Fri Jul 17 12:01:00 2015 UTC,"I'm pumped! I've seen Primus a couple times before, but never Dinosaur Jr. J Mascis absolutely shreds. Plus I've heard their shows are loud as all hell, so I'm definitely bringing earplugs along. My ears will thank me.  Loudest I've been to was probably Neil Young. Or Thurston Moore playing a noise rock set with two 70 year old guys in a tiny record store in Willimantic CT."
phish,3dlh23,noraamitt,2,Fri Jul 17 12:14:56 2015 UTC,I think the loudest show I've been to was Them Crooked Vultures...and I saw the pixies with like 250 people in a bar which was deafening and incredible.

Also that Light is one of my favorite Phish jams ever, and I don't really think they should have included anything at all with it. Even the sweet little Boogie On that came after it."
phish,3dlh23,FragsturBait,2,Fri Jul 17 17:12:46 2015 UTC,"I don't really HATE Caspian the way you do, but I do agree it was pointless to add it on. If there was a segue that would be different.   I also agree that the Caspian is a pretty decent, but again... no need."

I'm not the person you replied to, but here's how I got somewhere in that range (Bend will be 141 and 142). First off, it was a hell of a lot easier back in the 90's when they were playing 200+ shows per year, and I'm not sure you could do it now without taking a shit load of time off work and hitting every show they play for 5-6 years in a row.  Anyway, I started seeing them in '91, and graduated high school in '95. Since I was in college, I just saved up cash all winter long and took 2-3 months off work every summer to follow them. Summer tour '99 was the longest consecutive run I did, which was 18 shows in 23 days."

phish,3dkt24,ernstwebber,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:39:38 2015 UTC,True but what makes this Hood for me is the peak...and then he peaks it again. Why they don't peak Hood anymore is the question of the century.
phish,3dkt24,Kernel_Forbin,3,Fri Jul 17 17:57:26 2015 UTC,I was being extremely sarcastic.   The chant or lack thereof has absolutely NO bearing on the quality of this or any Hood.  People need to get over it.
phish,3dkt24,ernstwebber,2,Fri Jul 17 18:08:01 2015 UTC,Haha rereading your comment I see what you meant. But yeah I do agree that chant or no chant has any effect on the quality. Some people look way into the music.

phish,3dkt24,Paulbellini,5,Fri Jul 17 14:57:02 2015 UTC,"My wife didn't even like jambands six months ago.  I eased her in with Umphrey's, then she agreed to watch the Fare Thee Well streams, just to humor me.  She was won over by Trey's ability, and his enthusiasm, more than anything else.  Now we watch Phish shows on Youtube non-stop, and needless to say, she's hooked.  I wonder how many other new phans were brought in by Trey's performances?  Especially those who weren't even fans of the genre to begin with?  Regardless, she bought me Alpine Valley tickets for my birthday; we both win!"
phish,3dkt24,Paulbellini,3,Fri Jul 17 04:41:23 2015 UTC,"Nice.  I've tried for years to get my wife into the music but she can't be won over; ""every song sounds just like every other one"" is a normal response from her.   I've been a strictly Dead guy for 41+ years, I went to my first show in 73' in utero.   Well not strictly Dead, there's been The Beatles, classic rock, Metalica, classic outlaw country, bluegrass, and my skateboarding days with punk but the Dead have always been my #1.   My wife haze zero desire to listen to anything jam band related and only barely humors me when I listen to the Dead channel on Sirius. Music is ""my thing"" and she never denies me going to shows. In 2011, with four year old triplets, she understood why I followed Further from Binghamton to Boca Raton to catch those shows.   I'm glad you've been able to get your wife on the bus or train or whatever you Phish guys call it. :)"
phish,3dkt24,DrGraffix,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:03:18 2015 UTC,"Here's the hill I've had to climb: she only listened to Harry Connick Jr. & Top 40 radio before.  I honestly don't know what the tipping point was, but I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth, either.  Bottom line is, she was exposed to ""my music"" whenever I was home.  I play Dead, Phish, and Umphrey's shows on Youtube all the time.  I left twice this year for work, once for two weeks, and once for just a week.  When I came back the first time, she was an Umphreak.  This last time, she was all in for Phish.  Absence makes the heart grow fonder, maybe?  Either way, she's 42, and says she's discovered music for the first time, it's really cool to connect with her on something I'm so passionate about.  Jam On on XM Radio gets some of the credit, but Trey at the Fare Thee Well shows gets most of it."

Ya know?  Dear Jerry at Merriweather gave me a taste, but FTW blew my freakin mind.  I get it now.   Been spinning FTW and GD nonstop.  It's like a curtain has been raised, but too late to really experience it since I'll never see Jerry and I'll never see them all together again under the Grateful Dead name.

Also if you had any filters on.  I know that some of the 1997 tracks have been difficult to play some times.  I designed the site so that if a song wouldn't play it would just skip to the next track.

Albums in order 5. 11/17/97 (My personal favorite show, checkout the Tweezer and Ghost)  6. 10/31/94 (Halloween ""Musical Costume"" show, where set 2 is a cover of the Beatles' White Album, also contains what many believe to be the best Reba and the best Divided Sky)   If you want my recommendation (not that it's more qualified than any others here) 12/31/95 is the best place to start. It shows Phish at what I think is the biggest crossroads of their career, they were moving away from more straightforward jams that did not significantly leave the song structure, and more towards jams that were ""out there."" It is also just a plain old good show. There are a ton of links on the side bar for you to check all this shit out. I hope this helps, and enjoy the ride!"
phish,3dix1f,superfrank1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"12/31/95 is the best place to start.    Totally agreed.  This is what I recommend to new listeners as well. I think it shows off everything they are in one package; great jams, some silly moments (""Shine""), solid covers, a lot of their standard fan favorites, and a great PYITE opener that sort of sets the tone for what this band is all about during that build up to the first few words of the song.

phish,3dix1f,taterred,2,Fri Jul 17 02:25:46 2015 UTC,"Like most people here are saying, 12/31/95 is like the most ""essential"" show. 3 sets, musical oddities for New Years (aka 'Phish Time Factory'), most of the ""classic"" tunes and some crazy jams that go from genre to genre.   That being said, Fall '97 is easily the best. All 4 members were at creative peaks that led to  some setlists with only 4 songs (which was not uncommon this tour). Might be too ""jammy"" for a new listener, but it's kind of like hearing the Beatles get so good in the late 60's and just going waaaaaay outside of the box because they're on another level entirely and putting in the most hours they ever have... There were just at the goddamn PEAK... Oh, and funk. Loooooots of funky funk (i.e. Tube 12/29/97, Tweezer 11/17/97, AC/DC Bag 12/30/97)  With Phish, it seems the onstage jamming styles evolved a lot more distinctly by year than with the Dead... For example, '99/'00 is the trippy, effects-laden ""millennial"" sound, '03-'04 is scary & dark opiate jams, '93-'95 is the most ""rock"" Phish with the most consistently performed composed sections and some of Trey's fastest playing (look up the compilation ""Machine Gun"" too).   So basically, there's a LOT to dig through but you'll find your favorite ""type"" of Phish."

It's more experimental in the early years like (88)90-97, but it's also so fucking slamming and intense for 3.0 ~2009-present.   but to be honest all the years are good except for a few rare sets (glide at coventry....which really is sad more than bad, really sad)"

phish,3deq4i,theflyingjib,10,Wed Jul 15 18:16:14 2015 UTC,"NYE 95 is probably the closest thing.  Great setlist with classics and new songs combined with some deep type II jamming.  Some people would say Big Cypress (12/31/99), although I find that droning style kind of boring.  I believe 11/17/97 is the highest rated show on Phish.net, and the first set certainly looks the part.  The second set, however, is very average for Fall 97 (which is great by any other measure).  I honestly think any show from Fall 97 can be considered for best ever."
phish,3deq4i,TotallyNotGlenDavis,3,Wed Jul 15 18:21:55 2015 UTC,"NYE 95   Great show, but is it the greatest?  I don't really think so - I think it's more useful to look at great shows over different eras and styles. That was a great show during the transition to big venues, but there are some technically stellar shows in other years, including 3.0.   I'll be honest and say I've always had a hard time getting past the guitar flubs in NYE 95 Coil... for some reason it particularly grates on my ears and throws me off the mood, so I'd probably put the show in my personal top 20 but it's not one I go back to very often.  In short, no, I don't really think Phish has a single best ever show."
phish,3deq4i,rraak,5,Wed Jul 15 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"This sort of brings it back to my question though. With the Dead, very few people actually think 5-8-77 is the best show ever. They all have their own personal opinions and biases and whatnot. But if 10 people all vote on their 10 favourite shows, it usually ends up that you'll get 9 different shows on each list and then Barton Hall. It just seems to be one that everyone agrees as being a great example, but not really their favourite. Same with NYE 95. If you put it in your top 20, and so did everyone else, it would start growing support pretty quickly where a more obscure number one pick wouldn't. I'm just really interested in the general consensus among the community."
phish,3deq4i,FapNowPayLater,3,Wed Jul 15 18:50:54 2015 UTC,"its the clearest tape we have from that tour, and it isnt a sound board,  barton hall has it all  but it isnt even close to the best dead show ever...."
phish,3deq4i,bendistraw,2,Wed Jul 15 19:07:04 2015 UTC,"Yet it comes up high on all the polls! I'm looking at it more as a social thing than a musical one. I don't think Barton Hall is anywhere near the best show (I even prefer the night before), but I've never heard anyone call it bad, and somehow that averages out. Like everyone calling it a good show is better than some calling a show amazing and some calling it bad."
phish,3deq4i,rraak,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:48:39 2015 UTC,"Buffalo (1 or 2 nights later) was a better show in many opinions. To quote Bill Walton though, ""Don't rate 'em, just enjoy 'em""  To add my thoughts on some good listening I'll add Fall '97. Very funky and all the shows had a great vibe."
phish,3deq4i,Kupfink,2,Sat Jul 18 00:05:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in that sense it's statistically ""best"" if people on average tend to favor it. You're getting more into the nuts and bolts of stats, perhaps touching on a bit of psychology.   It still doesn't mean much though - I'd put a lot more stock in responses to ""What's your personal favorite Phish show from each era"" than a general ""best ever"" type thing."
phish,3deq4i,Sluice_Jounce,2,Wed Jul 15 19:24:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not putting stock in any of the accepted ""Best ever"" shows. I don't really like the Dead's ""best ever"" show. I just wanted to know for the sake of curiosity what the stats pointed to."
phish,3deq4i,Sluice_Jounce,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:51:07 2015 UTC,I have to agree..my favorite dead shows were ones that I was at.  I'm assuming that it's the same with most phish fans.
phish,3deq4i,TotallyNotGlenDavis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:53:14 2015 UTC,"You literally just explained how stats work and why that show would be considered the best. ""When the 100 patients who tested positive with the disease known as Icculosus were asked about the last 10 places they'd visited, Burlington Vermont was on every traveller's data sheet. This was the commonality that lead us to it's epicenter.""   The real problem here is that nobody (myself included) likes being told what to enjoy. Art is purely subjective and awards, accolades, and stats are just humans trying to quantify and compartmentalize things."
phish,3deq4i,StanlyBaratheon,2,Thu Jul 16 16:11:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying any of these shows are the best. I think stats aren't a very good way to judge these shows, but I'm still curious about them. I wanna know the answers, even if they aren't good answers."

phish,3deq4i,GeeForjay,3,Thu Jul 16 21:34:12 2015 UTC,"OP stated it pretty well below.  NYE 95 may not have the deepest jamming of any show, but it is a very safe agreeable pick for one of the best ever.  Crowd pleasing setlist with great renditions of some of their most classic tunes (Reba, Mike's, YEM).  If everyone listed their top 10, I bet NYE 95 would be the most commonly occurring show.  For the record, 11/22/97 would probably be my #1 pick."
phish,3deq4i,terrapin1234,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:03:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll personally take 11/22 over 11/17 but it's close.
phish,3deq4i,JPSG,19,Wed Jul 15 20:30:46 2015 UTC,The next show I see will undoubtedly be the best show ever. Every time.
phish,3deq4i,ski4theapres,3,Wed Jul 15 19:46:43 2015 UTC,"I prefer the last show will always be the best show I have seen. But then I think of the first show I saw, which was the Murat Gin show of 8.13.93. I was thinking that was a pretty crazy show until I saw the next night in my backyard, the Antelope fest of 8.14.93. Mmmmhmmmm....that was the best show, until I saw them next in Milwaukee. 6.17.94....wait...the OJ show!?! Wow that was awesome and the best last show I saw!  But then, wait, I drove to UIC for 6.18.94 and saw that show!!! FCUK!!!  My next show, 10.31.95. Pretty lofty heights to come out of the box with. 97, 98, 99, 2K, even 2.0 2003 and 2004 had the best shows being my last mindset, and kept me thriving for that next chance to see them. It's continued in 2009 and since. I'll be missing everything this summer so until the Fall or next Spring or Summer, the jammed out Wedge of Northerly Island 2014 remains my last and best show.  At some point, you just gotta go with the flow, not expect anything and let the music take you places you wouldn't have gone to otherwise. Thank you for my friend asking me to take a drive to Indy and come back to Chicago the following night with 2 tickets for me. It changed my life drastically as a 19 year old, and continues as I near my 40th this fall."

phish,3deq4i,Philnoise,7,Wed Jul 15 20:14:08 2015 UTC,Get the Island Tour. 4 shows from April '98.
phish,3deq4i,defsentenz,2,Wed Jul 15 18:37:08 2015 UTC,"That's the best RUN of all time, but I dont think any of them are really the best individual show of all time. Granted it's all, like, opinion man."
phish,3deq4i,gehenom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:27:31 2015 UTC,"Good answer...best ""run"" for sure.  Excepting all of winter 97.  That I think gets best ""tour."""
phish,3deq4i,mountm,4,Thu Jul 16 02:33:54 2015 UTC,"Like all art, Phish's music is a subjective piece. What one might consider the best ever might be seen by others as a boring show or just a regular night for the band. Having listened to both NYE 95 and Big Cypress, I can see the musical merits of both shows, but I can also hear the pitfalls and lulls in the sets.   As others have mentioned, there are multiple eras for Phish to have a ""best show,"" which I think could also be the case for the Dead as well, though my knowledge of their live sets is vastly limited when compared to Phish.   For Phish eras, the first 17 years (1.0) have an incredible amount of quality material. Fall 1997 has been mentioned, Japan 2000 is also a fantastic run of shows. Summer 1994 and The Island Tour 1998 are both runs that showcase two different sides of the band.  For the 2002-2004 era (2.0), the band really peaked with their performance at the IT Festival, but gems in 2003 (Nassau Tweezer, USANA 7/15/04) and 2004 (Brooklyn Moma, Camden Scents) can be found despite fans having a decidedly negative view on these years.    The most recent era, staring in 2009 as ""3.0,"" took time to get its jam-legs. The first two years are very hesitant, though there are peak moments in the NYE 2009 run, as well as Fall 2010. May 2011's run at Bethel Woods has a mind-blowing version of Waves in the soundcheck that can be found around the internet.  SuperBall was a major moment for the band with the ""Storage Jam"" reinvigorating their playing (this is also a must-hear). From 2012 forward, nearly every show has a moment worthy of mention, though fans still single out Dick's 8/31/12 as one of the single best performances the band has played. 2013 and 2014 all have standout moments, though no single full show has stood up in terms of quality to the Dick's opener in 2012. There are certainly major moments, including the massive pivot point of Tweezer on 7/31/13 and of course the giant risk-taking second sets on 10/31/13 and 10/31/14.   So what is the best show ever? It depends on who you ask. I'd wager that even the band doesn't have a ""best show ever"" in their own opinion, though at the time of the split in 2004, Trey was quoted as saying that Big Cypress was a pinnacle moment for them. While I can always throw my hat in the ring and tell you what I think has been the greatest show, it's worth noting that unlike the Dead, Phish is still very much active, and ranking a ""best of"" performance right now would ultimately be impossible, as anything and everything remain fair game.   TL;DR: There may be a 'best show' now, but it could be topped by the next show they play."
phish,3deq4i,mouseratrocks1980,2,Wed Jul 15 19:59:46 2015 UTC,"Great take on it!  It's interesting how Trey said that bit about big cypress....many greats in that show, but a lot suffered or were eclipsed by the enormity of the event.  That Drowned, the Mikes, and specifically the Light Up or Leave Me Alone bust out and the subsequent jam are all transcendent!"

phish,3deq4i,sophroniscou,3,Wed Jul 15 21:09:38 2015 UTC,"Everyone is naming some great shows, definitely the short list of their best. But the answer has to be Big Cypress. It's the show the band considers their pinnacle achievement. So much that they won't go back and listen to it.  Musically you might disagree because of the style, but you can't deny the experience and importance. They have said they felt they achieved all they could after that.  tl;dr No, nobody agrees"

phish,3deq4i,joncamp19,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"4-16-92 is an absolute classic for me.  it helps that there was a really good quality SBD that floated around on tape/cd's for many years, well before there were any means of downloading MP3s from LivePhish.  7-25-92 is another long time favorite of mine.  Short show, but features Santana sitting in, and the whole set is just the tits all around."
phish,3deq4i,TreyDHD,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:49:02 2015 UTC,"Short answer...No.  Longer answer: There are a stack of contenders, and they all potentially qualify.  12/30/93, 6/22/94, 4/3/98, 12/31/95, 12/7/97, 12/31/99, 7/21/91.....the list goes on.   Summer 93, winter 97, 98 Island run, anything around 10/31/94, summer 94.  Those are good places to start.  Each year has a flavor.  Each tour has peaks.  If you can find the Helping Friendly Book published around 2000, the metrics on tapes from the fans in the back is a great starting point.   You'll find an Era that has the sound and style you prefer.  I've been listening since 92, and winter 97 or summer 93 are my faves.  Cow funk and high energy explorations."
