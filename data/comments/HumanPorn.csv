If there is a tourist there, the kids likely see modern technology every day. The Himba in Namibia are not isolated by any means. They choose to live in their traditional ways despite being exposed to modern society. Often they will allow tourists groups to visit in order to bring in some money.   By posting this picture with such a title, you are perpetuating the Noble Savage mythos. Africa is not isolated, Africa is not full of ""tribal peoples,"" and Africans are not untouched by modern technology. Many places may lack the high speed connections we are used to (due to international lack of investment in the infrastructure, which is slowly changing as China makes investments on the continent while the West continues to only pump in ""aid."") but that does not mean they are not using and consuming technology.  That said...kids are the same everywhere in the world. Just like American children want to hold and play with your phone even if they see you and it every day, so do these kids. That's what this picture is really capturing."
HumanPorn,3dqlzf,seasicksquid,98,Sat Jul 18 21:53:14 2015 UTC,"While a few of the things you say are correct, some of it is total nonsense.    Africa is not full of ""tribal peoples""   This is blatantly untrue and obviously so to anyone that has spent any time in Africa.  Suggesting that these kids are wowed by iPads in the same way American kids would be is also total nonsense. While mobile phones are pretty common throughout Africa these days, high quality smartphones are not (let alone something as expensive as an iPad).   Saying many places lack high speed connections is a huge understatement. Even cities as advanced as Johannesburg have pretty shitty internet (at exorbitant prices) and 3g is patchy to say the least. I challenge you to get a decent mobile connection in a poorer or more rural part of Africa."
HumanPorn,3dqlzf,blackmanrgh,35,Sat Jul 18 23:08:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, Africa has a lot of ""tribal peoples"" living in the traditions of their often rural culture. But we in the Western world are so bombarded with photos of the rural, the poor, the uneducated, and the ""tribal"" that we forget Africa is a continent full of hundreds, if not thousands, of combined ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.   The comment you replied to is trying to fight back against harmful Western stereotypes about Africa and its people. Even in this thread you see people in disbelief that someone would give ""uncontacted tribes"" an iPad to look at. As if it would ruin their ""innocence"" or ""purity"". That is the Noble Savage fallacy your parent comment was addressing.   No one can seriously argue there aren't technological lapses between the Western world and much of Africa. However, it's worth it to remember not everyone in Africa is rural or ""tribal"". And even if they are, we as outsiders cannot uphold them to some moral/cultural standard we impose based on our own stereotypes."

They said the title perpetuates misbeliefs about African technological development for many Westerners. My comment and the one I referenced tried to counteract those misbeliefs as they were echoed elsewhere in the thread, long before your comment."
HumanPorn,3dqlzf,fauxhee,9,Sat Jul 18 17:11:52 2015 UTC,"This is blatantly untrue and obviously so to anyone that has spent any time in Africa.   No single person would describe themselves as a ""tribal person."" My partner is a Tonga from Zambia, and he said he is Zambian or Tongan, not a tribal person. When you use the term tribal you are condensing the entire continent of different groups of people into one group with preconceived notions attached. That is why I put it in quotations.   Suggesting that these kids are wowed by iPads in the same way American kids would be is also total nonsense. While mobile phones are pretty common throughout Africa these days, high quality smartphones are not (let alone something as expensive as an iPad).    I have done extensive travel and work in many rural parts of sub Saharan Africa, and it is exactly the same. While there may be pockets of isolated people to whom modern technology is not frequently seen, most are routinely visited by workers from NGOs with modern technology, travelers, missionaries, or just family members coming from more prosperous and ""modernized"" areas.   I challenge you to get a decent mobile connection in a poorer or more rural part of Africa.    I don't see where I disagreed with this? Though I will say, there is more mobile coverage than you may think. I've had connection in areas where you wouldn't expect it in rural areas. My sister in law recently did a project in rural parts of Zambia where she collected data from rural health centers using older Nokia phones...which had a relatively reliable connection.   That said, within South Africa you do more frequently have coverage than not, and when I lived in Cape Town I had a faster connection than I had while living in a large city in the US. You tend to make it seem like people are so poor everywhere in Africa that they are not even considered a market for growing telecom companies. Airtime is relatively cheap and putting up a tower increases the market. Cell phones can be gotten for cheap and while they may not be the latest and greatest that we are used to, Androids have a HUGE market in sub Saharan Africa due to their affordability and repair-ability (comparative to Apple products). Flip phones are also common."
HumanPorn,3dqlzf,seasicksquid,6,Sat Jul 18 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"When you use the term tribal you are condensing the entire continent of different groups of people into one group with preconceived notions attached.   Well, yes and no. ""Tribal"" isn't a very detailed descriptor, but it describes a general subset of the African population, just as it describes a general subset of the American population. The most politically correct term? No. But it only intends to highlight the contrast between developed, technological societies from the society of this tribe. Most tribal societies do not use iPads.   So yes, ""tribal"" condenses people into broad categories - just like ""middle class"" condenses people. Not all tribes are the same, not all middle class Americans are the same - but the descriptors can be useful."
HumanPorn,3dqlzf,sevenswansdead,7,Sat Jul 18 18:35:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about the anthropological meaning of the word tribe, I'm talking about the Western history of use of the word ""tribal."" There is a long history of actual Africans from across the continent objecting to the use of this term, though, and it being used in a negative light. The historical connotation is that a tribal person is ""primitive"" or ""savage."" It reinforces the separateness of native African people from Westerners who view them from the outside, and is a holdover from colonialism.   So when you use that term to vaguely describe someone who you do not know, you are ascribing those characteristics to them, even if it is unwittingly. The NYT, for example, does not use it due to the connotations.    The bottom-line problem with the idea of tribe is that it is intellectually lazy. It substitutes the illusion of understanding for analysis of particular circumstances. Africa is far away from North America. Accurate information about particular African states and societies takes more work to find than some other sorts of information. Yet both of those situations are changing rapidly. Africa is increasingly tied into the global economy and international politics. Using the idea of tribe instead of real, specific information and analysis of African events has never served the truth well. It also serves the public interest badly. http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category.php/features/45595"
HumanPorn,3dqlzf,seasicksquid,3,Sat Jul 18 18:01:09 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you, so much as I'm disregarding the (problematic) history of the word's use. I don't like the word either, as it often does promote an outsider, xenophobic response.   I'm just defending the use of the word in this case, as I think this picture celebrates differences between people, and I don't see the use of the word ""tribal"" detracting from that, or degrading the African children.   And it's Reddit - I don't come here looking for time-accurate information. I read the NYT for that."

HumanPorn,3dqlzf,seasicksquid,2,Sat Jul 18 21:35:36 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I'm assuming it's relative to other smartphones. You can get a regular smartphone that can do all that a high end phone can (aside from a few specific features that border on gimmicky) for $50-$100, which is, just by definition, the lowest quality smartphone available.   I would consider an iPhone or Galaxy S6 or M9 a ""high end"" smartphone, which is much more expensive than an iPad.  I agree with everything he said, I just wanted to nitpick the part about iPads being more expensive than a high quality smartphone.

Americans as a whole don't fit into the sociological definition of tribe, but America does have acknowledged and advanced tribes, and I deal with them all the time (EPA and federal transportation issues with States and Tribes).   Pointing out a tribal system in the context of Africa, though, places the picture in a more clear category of African. I think it was a helpful description, but that's just my take."

They've been identified as Himba children, and the Himba choose to live traditional lifestyles even though their nation's capital looks like any big city. People in Namibia have cars, shopping centers, and beautiful parks.   The Himba people are fully aware of modern culture and technology. Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism even notes in a 2011 study of the Himba how they travel to nearby cities to buy and sell goods and receive healthcare."
HumanPorn,3dqlzf,AidenR90,3,Sat Jul 18 21:13:33 2015 UTC,Brazil is an entirely different story. It's not really comparable.

HumanPorn,3dqlzf,Bleyph,6,Sat Jul 18 22:02:41 2015 UTC,"That's the caption OP used, and OP did not take this photo. Also, the kids look to be all under age 10. They're not a fair sample of their whole tribe's awareness of technology. They may have seen computers, or smartphones, but not an iPad. Remember, awareness =/= frequency.  Your point about your country is fair. However, as pointed out above, that is not the case with this particular tribe. The Himba are aware of modern technology and choose their lifestyle over it. Your original comment assumed they were ""technologically uninitiated"" based on their appearance and description.   As for uncontacted Brazilian tribes, there are many factors in their isolation. The Amazon rainforest, for one. All uncontacted tribes recorded by the Brazilian government live there. You can see the majority of the jungle is untouched. Cars are useless there. After a certain point all expedition must be carried out by foot, which takes a long time and is often dangerous. On top of that, the tribes themselves are often hostile to outsiders and isolate themselves. Now many of them are protected by government against unsolicited contact.   This is all a huge contrast to the Himba tribe of Namibia and Angola. The Himba solicit interaction with outsiders and invite tourists into their villages. There aren't huge, dense physical impediments between them and big cities, and they are not hostile. They know cities exist.   TL;DR just because some rural tribes are isolated doesn't mean all of them are. How we treat them should be dictated by how they see themselves, not vice versa."

This doc came out today and it shows a harsh reality facing people who still rely on hunting and gathering. These people have literally always lived that way and the government drove them from their home.  Although the argument is that they would hunt animals to extinction, which is probably true. But that is only beause these plants and animals habitats have been MASSIVELY reduced to the point where small tribes could actually kill them off.   Now if those national parks and forests were much much larger that problem wouldnt exist. These peoples could continue to live as they have and sustain it, and outside peoples would be allowed a much more immersive tourist experience(which is the only way this particular people make money-tourism).  And this occurs the world over. People can go get their own food naturallyand sustainably or we can make our own food unnaturally through immense monocultures by killing off countless species(including some unadaptable humans)  But this picture makes me happy"

HumanPorn,3dgqtu,MrHorseWithNoName,20,Thu Jul 16 12:47:30 2015 UTC,Hugh Jackman   Really? I thought he was the most unrealistic character. Just evil and stupid.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,Stankmonger,10,Thu Jul 16 14:20:24 2015 UTC,Character writing is separate from the actor's additude. But I haven't seen it so I don't have an opinion.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,RoachPowder,7,Thu Jul 16 12:16:00 2015 UTC,"He wasn't evil or stupid, just cross as a frog in a sock.   (I love that so much I actually say it now, but only among people that know I'm joking around)"
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,leaptheman,2,Thu Jul 16 12:27:11 2015 UTC,Unrealistic character yeah but he looked like he was at least having some fun with it.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,MrHorseWithNoName,2,Thu Jul 16 12:38:04 2015 UTC,So did the indian dude.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,Stankmonger,55,Thu Jul 16 14:08:44 2015 UTC,I thought it was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I can definitely recommend! It's sort of like Robocop that doesn't take itself so seriously but ends up being even more heartfelt.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,nsaber,8,Thu Jul 16 13:25:47 2015 UTC,I'd describe it as a mix of Short Circuit and Robocop.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,hicsuntdracones-,3,Thu Jul 16 14:24:13 2015 UTC,"This is it exactly.  It's worth seeing, but I would go in with low expectations.  These two were interesting to watch, but it struggles to find a target audience.  There are about 4 seconds of gore and language that got its rating.  Stylistically interesting.   Not a great movie."

HumanPorn,3dgqtu,GloriousHam,8,Thu Jul 16 21:21:56 2015 UTC,It's hard to tell with 80s movies...
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,nsaber,19,Thu Jul 16 19:10:04 2015 UTC,RoboCop was very specifically made to be an over-the-top commentary on the rising militarization of police in the country. It didn't take itself seriously at all.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,GloriousHam,3,Thu Jul 16 10:41:23 2015 UTC,"And it has the best line ever spoken:  ""Bitches leave"".   Runner-up - ""I'd buy that for a dollar"""

HumanPorn,3dgqtu,MenuBar,7,Thu Jul 16 14:42:18 2015 UTC,That's the most ludicrously dismissive thing I've heard about ex machina.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,letsgocrazy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:08:17 2015 UTC,I felt it needed a more extensive review rather than just saying it sucked.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,MenuBar,2,Thu Jul 16 11:40:07 2015 UTC,"If you want at the best crappy, but mostly irritating actors or a movie that not even Hugh Jackman can save, you go with Chappie. The feels - i get the feels of Ex Machina 1000 times more than of Chappie, because Chappie tries to FORCE the feels out of you, like when you during a hangover try to push out the nonexisting last portion of toothpaste from the very last tube at home, but somewhere you know that they are not there and they are not real!  Edit: it was long ago i hated a movie this much."
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,Alienqueen,3,Thu Jul 16 14:26:27 2015 UTC,I enjoyed it.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,MenuBar,2,Thu Jul 16 14:34:45 2015 UTC,"I had to turn it off. Yolandi and Ninja were horrible actors. I did finish watching it later, but I had to decompress from all the suck in the first 1/2 to stomach the second.  That said, I liked it as a popcorn movie, but Ex Machina really got me."

HumanPorn,3dgqtu,-Pelvis-,2,Thu Jul 16 13:51:47 2015 UTC,For me personally it's the best movie of the year so far.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,dragonsky,2,Thu Jul 16 21:53:06 2015 UTC,I just watched Ex Machina based on a recommendation in another child comment.  That movie blew my fucking mind.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,-Pelvis-,6,Thu Jul 16 15:38:26 2015 UTC,"I actually just watched it a few hours ago.  It was pretty good.  It started to lose me a bit near the very end, but overall good movie.  Definitely worth watching."

HumanPorn,3dgqtu,dregofdeath,3,Thu Jul 16 14:07:40 2015 UTC,Definitely. Sharlto Copley's performance is definitely one of the highlights of the movie
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,jbs13572,6,Thu Jul 16 15:11:07 2015 UTC,Fuck Rotten Tomatoes. If it isn't a Korean art house movie or a movie about HIV it automatically gets a low score.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,veritasxe,8,Thu Jul 16 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"Ahh, but RT is just an aggregator. You're really saying ""fuck professional mainstream movie critics"", which is a perfectly valid opinion.  (Also, Korean HIV art-house is my favourite. /s)"

HumanPorn,3dgqtu,skoonat,3,Thu Jul 16 15:29:00 2015 UTC,It's like a cartoon made into a movie. The story makes no sense and the acting is less than mediocre. While it has a lot of shaky can going on. I hated it very much. But a lot of people here on reddit seems to like it.
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,JurijFedorov,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:35:17 2015 UTC,It's basically the plot of Short Circuit 2
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,RoseOfThorne,4,Thu Jul 16 13:11:14 2015 UTC,Terrible. Hard to watch. Incoherent writing/story and bad acting. The characters were so over the top and unrealistic. I'm an ass though.

HumanPorn,3dgqtu,elusivewater,-12,Thu Jul 16 11:05:19 2015 UTC,"To be honest - you should see that movie if you don't mind losing 3 hours from your life. It's so bad, so bad that you have to watch it to the end to see if they can save it somehow, but... they don't. That movie is tragic. I don't have negative enough words to describe it. It should be called Crappie, not Chappie."
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,Alienqueen,11,Thu Jul 16 12:24:01 2015 UTC,Oh wow. I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.

HumanPorn,3dgqtu,vitalogst,10,Thu Jul 16 08:09:10 2015 UTC,They get pretty pissed when people call them 'performance art.'
HumanPorn,3dgqtu,seditious_commotion,14,Thu Jul 16 12:57:20 2015 UTC,Well probably because they are keeping in character.  Andy Kaufman was infamous for refusing to break character.

Under this sea of orange, we can barely distinguish a form: an infant Afghan boy, named Gul Ahmad, who suffers from acute malnutrition.

Each month, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) treats 250 malnourished children at its Boost Hospital in the Helmand province; and recent UNICEF research predicts that hundreds of thousands children will suffer from severe malnutrition this year in Afghanistan. http://time.com/3814254/afghanistan-starving-boy-photo/"

The way he said ""though"" implied ""everything else notwithstanding"" and I had just met this guy not 2 minutes ago. It's good I didn't take the bait.

I read an article recently of Ethiopian jews experiencing institutional discrimination in Israel; so much so that they held a protest in Tel Aviv in May. After searching I think this was the Aljazeera article.   Apparently it started because police officers beat a black Israeli soldier. But the stigma against black Jews in Israel seems to be even more insidious than that. According to that article apparently in 2013 ""Israel admitted to forcibly administering birth control injections to Ethiopian Jewish women without their consent or knowledge."""
HumanPorn,3csomq,pack0newports,7,Fri Jul 10 22:33:50 2015 UTC,"No, that was sloppy journalism by Haaretz English - somehow ""denied"" turned into ""admitted"" in the English version. Haaretz English did issue a correction in the print version but I don't think they ever corrected the online version which world media picked up on. The premise is pretty absurd, why mount a costly operation like Operation Solomon to bring over Ethiopian Jews and then, just before they board the plane, give them a 3 month birth control shot? If you don't want little Ethiopian kids running around your country, don't voluntarily go to Ethiopia and put them all on planes. There is much that can and should be said about discrimination against beta Israel in Israel but this isn't one of them."

HumanPorn,3csomq,autmnleighhh,5,Fri Jul 10 15:38:54 2015 UTC,I was just flipping through channels yesterday and came across a public tv show about people from Eritrea a small country in africa trying to jump the boarder from Eygpt to Israel for a better life.  These people are being kidnapped in Eygpt and Sudan and being tortured and held for ransom.  They would literately hold these people on the phone with relatives in Israel while they torture them for money.  It was so incredibly horrible I was not prepared for it on a Thursday afternoon.  They are calling people's brothers and sisters who are already poor asking for tens of thousand of dollars while they cut off hands and feet and burn them alive.

After searching I think this was the Aljazeera article.   Yeah, that's mostly bull though. Not the protest in Tel Aviv part, but the discrimination part. It's not a surprise you read it in an Aljazeera article, since like RT it's a government mouthpiece whose job is mostly to sow division among the perceived enemies of the governments that own it.  Ethiopian jews actually have made outstanding strides in the last decades. You need to remember they came from literally living in huts, and now they're only about 20% lower in high school graduation than the other jews (about 10% higher than the Israeli arabs even!)."
HumanPorn,3csomq,HabloEspwnol,17,Fri Jul 10 20:57:51 2015 UTC,"So are you saying that Ethiopan-Israelies didn't protest against  institutional discrimination, and they weren't injected with birth control without their consent?"
HumanPorn,3csomq,desmunda1,-34,Fri Jul 10 20:21:56 2015 UTC,"No, if you'll read my comment carefully you'll see I acknowledge the protest.   When they arrived, it was a wise policy. Almost all of them were married with 6-8 children, many suffering from various infectious diseases that needed to be treated.   They had to learn a new laungange, in a new land, while actually learning at schools/universities for the first time, they even had to be explained how to use running water and the modern toilet, not to mention the culture shock. There was no point in trying to explain and make them take birth control pills that even girls in the west, long accustomed to them, mess up regularly and become pregnant.   A new, ninth baby can be hugely detrimental in the those early months of integration. It was a very wise policy, whose fruits Israel and the Ethiopian jews in it reap more and more as the time passes."
HumanPorn,3csomq,_watching,31,Fri Jul 10 15:44:43 2015 UTC,"Wow. ""A wise policy"". ""No point in trying to explain and make them take birth control pills"".

HumanPorn,3csomq,pizzademons,14,Fri Jul 10 16:29:13 2015 UTC,"You don't know what eugenics or racism is apparently   Eugenics by definition ""It is a social philosophy advocating the improvement of human genetic traits...and sterilization of people with less-desired or undesired traits"".   'Long-lasting birth control pills' and sterilisation aren't remarkably different.    Israel was being racist when it expanded large efforts to save the Ethiopian jews   Also just because you import a bunch of blacks from Africa doesn't excuse you from racist policies. The U.S. did that too around 1750. Israel, a fledgling country, needed a workforce; and a workforce they got. It'd be silly to think the Exodus/Solomon airlifts were purely altruistic in nature.    There are half Ethiopian children all over the place   I guess that makes it all better?

However, there absolutely is a lot of racism and discrimination against Ethiopian Jews. Mainly from the police, the judicial system, the army etc.  That is what they were protesting in the last few months. And it was one of the most amazing and passionate wave of protest that I can remember. Saying that they are all wrong and that they are actually doing fine is patronizing and shameful.

But I don't believe statehood should be contingent on their choosing a government that I like."

Photography is a powerful medium and they use it to tell us the stories of people, places, and events all across the globe. Stories we would otherwise never know. Stories that we, so wrapped up in our own lives, would never know were happening . They capture the joy, beauty, suffering, and sadness they encounter and share it with all of us. They give us a window into moments and events taking place in every corner of the earth. Photographs can teach,  inspire, and outrage us. They can be a catalyst for change. The work that photojournalists do is very important."

HumanPorn,3c6nn3,koshercowboy,-25,Sun Jul 5 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to me, the expression on her face.  It speaks to me in the ways they say a picture is worth a thousand words does.  Time probably has no meaning to her, having no responsibilities, job, bills to pay or anything to worry about in the near future--she just has today.  And she seems more so at peace with this than not. A sense of stoic tranquility has seemed to wash over her.  I've heard many times over people say that humans are the one animal on earth that have to pay to live, but this simply isn't true. Although in some instances it is more true for people who live in urban situations than it is for people who live in, say, Slab City, where bartering and anarchism seem to reign, it simply isn't absolute.  Scrounging, scavenging, foraging and even creative self-reliance get hundreds of thousands by, some with a tad more elegance and composure than others.  But this woman seems to, with her weathered yet hopeful expression, understand that life goes on, and she can still find happiness, with or without all of the things that most in civil societies find essential for living.  It's a hopeful image to me for that reason, not a sad one."

HumanPorn,3c6nn3,APirateHooker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:11:11 2015 UTC,"It's mostly the location (notice there are no scars past a certain point on her arms) and the large amount of straight cuts. I'm no expert, but when you know someone with self harm scars, you can tell."

We all have opinions, and I had a feeling when writing mine that it might not be much liked, but that's not why I wrote it. I just felt like saying what I wanted to say."
HumanPorn,3c6nn3,koshercowboy,9,Mon Jul 6 04:12:54 2015 UTC,Probably because it was a lot of words to say nothing. It was also a completely wrong interpretation of her situation.

I can understand and to an extent agree with the things you say but they simply do not apply to her. She does not look at peace.

HumanPorn,3c6nn3,Tigidou,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:15:37 2015 UTC,I agree that's a pretty valid observation which makes a lot less assumption than mine given her condition and the condition of her country.

HumanPorn,3c6nn3,koshercowboy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"Observations can't be opinions, they are 'factual' with the tiny amount of info you can observe, you form an opinion after. Based on the information you can read and watch on Greece and the crisis and what you can observe about this woman's expression and how that might relate to the crisis, there's a big chance she's unhappy. Only now the opinion comes after this observation. I don't think you even provided your opinion, you only wrote what you observed."
HumanPorn,3c6nn3,Tigidou,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:21:21 2015 UTC,My opinion was drawn from my observation. I think that's pretty easy to understand.

My father went abroad to earn living and in his absence, my paternal family were my guardians. They didn't wish for me to continue my education or to have any social activity since they felt that girls should not be allowed outside their home. When I tried to go out, I was beaten and locked up. Even my mother was not allowed to see me. One day, I tried to run away from that prison but I couldn't go far because my eldest uncle (chacha) was a Jirgah member and his hold over the community was very powerful. I was locked up again. My father was unaware of the situation, we couldn't even contact him as there were no telephones. Then one day my brother managed to post a letter to him, telling him everything. My father came back to Pakistan immediately - losing his business abroad in the process - and took us to Karachi. It took two years for us to build a life, starting from scratch and living without any luxuries. Naturally, my paternal family refused to assist us financially but in addition, they didn't leave us in peace in Karachi either. They kept giving threats to my father. I was miserable and sometimes wished I hadn't been born a girl because I couldn't bear feeling helpless. I tried making myself feel better by working in an NGO but my relatives put allegations on me of doing illegal work so I gave up. Then I joined a news channel as an anchor, but the career ended before it started when the same relatives threatened to throw acid on my face if I ever dared appear on television again. I quit that job too. Now, I am a social activist and a free lance journalist, making documentaries on social issues, some of which I myself have experienced. Life for women is made difficult in Pakistan mainly because of the blood relatives who take it upon themselves to give out justice for acts that they themselves have labelled as crimes. I wish for an open minded Pakistan, one where relatives support their women, rather than becoming shackles at their feet!"" - Source"
