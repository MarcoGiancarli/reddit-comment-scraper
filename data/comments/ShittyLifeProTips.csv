I had smashed my thumb in my boyfriends car door the day before and the nail was still black and halfway hanging off. It hurt but not enough to really render me hospital-worthy. I got pulled over, quickly realized my thumb looked like hell, mustered up some tears and told the officer I was trying to drive to an UrgentCare that took my insurance. He got all sad and offered to escort me. I told him I could probably do it on my own since he was busy.  Really not a bad guy, he told me some medical tips on how to help the thumb heal and didnt even leave me off with a warning. Probably the best experience i've had with a cop!"

I was on allergy meds - benadryl -which really knocks me out and was shopping for furniture at Macy's on 34th St in NYC. The top floor is all furniture and they had these comfy reclining chairs and I kicked back in one and dozed off. Woke up an hour later, no one had bothered me the whole time.  Its pretty empty up there. Most people don't go all the way to the top floor and I guess the employees are spread pretty thin. I stubbled outa there and felt like a hobo, ha-ha.
