I used to be more outspoken against radical feminism and radical SJW's, until more recently. I have a lot of friends who have turned fierce SJW- and I have lost several of them because they couldn't be friends with someone who didn't agree with all of their opinions and beliefs. I realized at one point that I wasn't changing anyone's minds, the only people who really paid attention to what I was saying/ posting in social media were the people who were of that same mind set. I finally stopped posting anything to social media that could in any way be interpreted as an attack or question of other peoples beliefs because I didn't want to be a target of some SJW's crusade."

Sure the tests were completely flawed and based on stupid ideas, but it's better than igniting someone's career entirely based on hearsay.

sjwhate,3dxk4j,northernracerealist,6,Tue Jul 21 16:29:32 2015 UTC,"“describe real-life sex crimes that have happened to teenagers in this area with brutal accuracy”. The article concludes – approvingly -- that by the end of the session, the boys are “scarred for life”.   This will only create  new generation of S&M enthusiasts, I predict.     A CALL TO MEN UK believes that preventing violence against women and girls is primarily the responsibility of men.   I dunno about that, I think it's more effective to inform ALL people on what they can do to prevent violence.  After all, it is only maybe 1/5 of men that commit rape (assuming that the statistics are sound) and 1/3 of women experience some form of it.  Given those numbers, more women are going to impacted by sexual violence than men and thus they actually do bear a disproportionate burden in stopping it.  Look at the statistics on reporting sexual violence, it is usually held to be a very unreported crime.  If women don't take it upon themselves to report it then it will continue to be something that men can get away with, but we all know that men can't report it for them.    All the same, I disagree with this part of the analysis:   On the section of their website listing the organisation’s values, their final point simply states: “Feminism: This says it all”, with a link to a video of TED X talk entitled: “We Should All Be Feminists”.   Really? Who says so? Most importantly though, since when was it acceptable to impose ideology on school children? And for that matter, would we ever dare to suggest school girls ought to be taught that Great Women Value Men?   If feminism means equality for the genders (which most feminists still claim it does, even if their means to that end are despicable) then how can I not be for it?  And why wouldn't we teach that message to kids in school, just like we should teach them about racial equality?  Finally, yes great women do value men and I have no problem with that being taught in school.  The real issue, as far as schooling goes, is who gets to determine the curriculum: local communities or the corporate drones behind the Common Core?"

This whole ""teach men and boys not to rape"" narrative is really getting tiresome, especially when most (if not all) rapists probably don't care that they're hurting someone. People are taught growing up not to lie/cheat/steal/kill/do drugs, but some people still do it anyway. This narrative also erases female rapists and male victims.  I believe teaching all kids/teens about consent is very important, but not like this. It should be taught in a gender neutral way. Boys AND girls should both be taught to take no for an answer as well as how to better voice when they are feeling uncomfortable and don't want something.   After all, it is only maybe 1/5 of men that commit rape (assuming that the statistics are sound) and 1/3 of women experience some form of it   A lot of rape and other sexual violence statistics are pretty skewed and dishonest.

EDIT: The recent Trump situation is a perfect example. All his positions and opinions are now discounted because of his racist thought crime. Trump as a candidate didn't interest me even before this recent debacle but I do find it interesting that people care more about the opinions people hold (e.g., Trump believing most immigrants are criminals) rather than the real life actions of people (e.g, immigrants who actually commit crimes such as rape and murder).

In reality however companies make games based on what sells and hire devs/programmers who are qualified to make the intended product. This doesn't stop people like Sarkeesian (who is not a programmer or anything even close) from raising half a million dollars on kickstarter, and buying a house with it. Her website is a bit like Sarah Palin's website - you pay a fee to ""communicate with like-minded people"" (ie echo chamber) and dwell on these ""issues"" which range from ""war on christians"" (Palin) to war on girls in gaming (Sarkeesian). They are two sides of the same coin - sensationalist pan-bangers who draw a crowd and then profit from them.

Then it came to light that these journalists had a group in which they colluded with one another.     The SJW part is what's bled out of the whole thing when these same sites bitched and moaned to no end about harassment and the lack of diversity in gaming character's races and sexual orientation and such. The same sites began siding with fuckheads like Sarkeesian when a decent chunk of their audience despised her and everything she stands for.

First off, it is built on land that Indian tribes considered particularly sacred, which had been promised to the Indians by treaty in 1868 (so it was Indian land that was illegally seized). That's not exactly uncommon, but it has the heads of the presidents who predominantly expanded the U.S. or preserved it - so it honors the people who took land from the Indians.  Second, the artist didn't want to include 4 presidents. He wanted it to feature western heroes like Lewis & Clark and chief Red Cloud, which would be arguably more relevant than 4 president heads out in the middle of nowhere.  A much better memorial to chief Crazy Horse is being built nearby, and even it is controversial because it is carved into the same mountain range. Either way, I never intend to visit Mt. Rushmore, but would be very interested in the Crazy Horse memorial. When complete, it should be the largest sculpture ever made."

I think in Britain they're planning on opening up infantry to women in 2016 (though it isn't confirmed), I mean that's just basically because America did it. Now once again because America looks more ""advanced"" we must follow suit.   Fuck you America, you brought us sjws and you can fuck right off!"
sjwhate,3dsfo9,Pink-Mizt,6,Sun Jul 19 00:51:05 2015 UTC,"That's way too easy! I thought the USMC are supposed to be the best? I mean even for a man that's too easy.   That's just the yearly physical fitness test (PFT). That's been the standard for over 30 years.  The bare minimum to pass the PFT for all Marines are the standards you wrote about, but that's not competitive for promotions. You have no concept of the Corps besides this paper requirement, so you're judging on too little information.  For the record, not one single female Marine made it through the Marine Corps Infantry Officer Course. But they're getting through Ranger school, so there's that.   Fuck you America, you brought us sjws and you can fuck right off!   SJW is rooted in communism, which is a European invention. So fuck you, it's your fault."
sjwhate,3dsfo9,HalalVeggieBacon,4,Sun Jul 19 14:47:51 2015 UTC,"I was comparing it to British Marines, I mean there's is something like 60 push ups, 10 pull ups, an inclined treadmill run at 11mph for 20 minutes (I think a 3 mile run in under 19minutes too), and having to pass the Commando course, with a lot more requirements. All the while being tested daily and if you slip under requirements, you are out. I know all British Marines are Commandos, but I mean the USMC is Americas ""Elite"" soldiers.  As for Communism, if you think SJWs have an respect for Stalin or Mao, then kill yourself please."

SJWs partake in a seed planted in our country in the 1960s and 1970s called cultural marxism. Even though they don't think they're aligned with the intent of communism, they are."

Plus U.S Marine basic is 12 weeks, British regular infantry is 29 weeks.   You can't deny those Marine standards are a bit low, for your ""elite""."

Their measure of ""combat fitness"" is something I do three times a week for fun, as a fat civilian.  Again, you have to consider that the British regular Army is smaller than the US Marine Corps. The training might be shorter because the volume is higher, but I doubt it's any less effective."

Sure they don't don't do pull ups, but the USMC only have to do 3 Pull ups. If you check, the British Infantry have to do a Jerry can carry, fireman carry, progressive loading up to 40kg, and a grenade throw, that's just in the selection phase. Oh, and 50 push ups is the minimum for the Army, and you'd be aiming for 65 to get selected, still more than the USMC.  As I said the PARAs, have way higher standards than the USMC and they're not commandos. http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/parachute/24313.aspx That's doesn't include the other requirements, and as I said, you'd be aiming for 65 push ups to even be selected.  Oh and that link you posted is not infantry, it has women standards on it, women are barred from British infantry. It's cadets training.

If you check, the British Infantry have to do a Jerry can carry, fireman carry, progressive loading up to 40kg, and a grenade throw, that's just in the selection phase.

For the IDF PFT, they have to able to run 1.86 miles (3km) in 15:33, which is 3 miles in exactly 25 minutes - that's about on par with below-average performance in a USMC PFT.  Reading these different PT tests, I'm not particularly impressed with the Israeli standards. Also, they don't have a Combat Fitness Test, which is another yearly fitness test requirement for US Marines.  SJW is alive and well in European politics.

And Gadna is BEFORE even drafting into the military. There is a difference between the standards required in order to DRAFT into a combat unit and those everyone should reach (and if not improve at least maintain) after drafting. Apart from the fact that there are ""combat"" units in the IDF that are not considered combat ready, like Caracal, to get into an elite unit one has to pass at least Yom Sayarot. It's two days doing shit like sprints, sandbags runs, push ups and pull ups, team mission assignments pretty much non stop from 4am to 7pm for two days in a row. If one wants to be a paratrooper then it's 3 days with even higher standards (that's what my boyfriend did). Only peopòe who excel at these tryouts are allowed to try for special forces. However as I said these are just the requirements to join the unit. Once in the unit there's this thing called Targad (battalion exercise week), it's supposed to be once a year. It's a week soldiers spend in the field, marching for 30+km a day, carrying from 40 to 80% of their body weight. Plus training exercises, plus sleep deprivation (soldiers never sleep more than 2 hours a day during a Targad.) All of this usually happens in the north, on the mountains. Sometimes the Targad can last up to 10 days. However, I checked out the Combat Fitness Test and I noticed women's maximum scores were significantly lower than men's."
sjwhate,3dsfo9,HalalVeggieBacon,2,Mon Jul 20 21:33:07 2015 UTC,"3km != 3mi. 3.2 miles is 5kilometers, so 3 miles is about 4.8km.   Also,  Pushups != Pullups. Pushups are easy. Pullups are not. It's the difference between moving your body weight a few inches, and picking yourself up entirely.  All Marines go through a high endurance pruning process called ""The Crucible"", and I know a number of people who've been injured and held back. I even know a guy who broke his foot on the first 10 mile (16km) hike, and made it through the whole thing. That's what Marines are, and what they do.  And if there's any proof that everyone wants to measure up to US Marines, it's how all foreign military forces feel the need to compare themselves to US Marines, but US Marines don't feel the need to compare themselves to everyone else."

The marines as an entity might push deadlines a little bit for practical reasons (they have a tradition that EVERY marine must stay qualified as a rifleman - even if they have a desk job - or they are kicked out. This also means that disabled marines are not able to find a job within the marines), but basically the same requirements will be put in place.

This is a violation of free speech, not in a legal sense, but an ethical and practical sense, especially on a platform as far-reaching and influential as reddit. It's no longer just a private entity, it's effectively a public commons. This is exactly how it's promoted itself for the past decade, which is how it's become as far-reaching and influential as it did.  I consider the right to free speech at least as valuable as the right to life and safety (which the UN happens to agree with, in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights) so I consider SJWs to be as much of a threat to human rights and dignity as the Spanish Inquisition was.

It is no better than saying it is worldly and sinful and against god's law for the woman to lead the household and not the man.  Feminism is essentially religious fundamentalism gone full circle.  Ask a guy like that how he feels about men choosing an open marriage where they fuck other women (and the woman just stays home and takes care of the house) and I guarantee you his answer isn't going to be consistent with his opinion when the roles are reversed. You can bet your ass it will be some neo-puritanical monologue on how men having multiple lovers is reinforcing patriarchal notions of men being studs for sleeping around while women are expected to be different lest they be shamed and branded as whores.  Honestly, I have no problem if this guy wants to be a cuck bitch and have his family lose all respect for him over time.

His side of the marriage isn't open by his own choice   I'm not sure what you mean there. He says he hasn't used his sexual 'carte blanche' as often as she has, but that's all he says. That could mean he's playing completely monogamous, or he's only slept with three other women.. there's no way to know.   Ask a guy like that how he feels about men choosing an open marriage where they fuck other women (and the woman just stays home and takes care of the house)   I mean, I could have completely misunderstood where this guy is coming from, but that doesn't sound like the equivalent case to me. He didn't say ""she wanted to fuck other guys but didn't want me doing the same"". If you go over to /r/polyamory, you'll see dozens of questions from people who are struggling because one partner wants to open up the relationship, and the conversations mostly seem to go like the author of this article indicated.  All I'm saying is, based on the article alone, it seems like the sequence of events was :   douchebag wife cheated on him and then justified it because feminism after a lot of talk, he was convinced that opening up the marriage is a good idea (you say 'influenced by a system of thought that he did not arrive to on his own', but again, we don't know that. He might be convinced, or he might just be too beta to leave.. but we don't know. he justifies this because feminism   There's a lot to mock there (i.e. because feminism), but I was just surprised at how venomously everyone here attacked the dude for being a 'cuck bitch' etc.   To give you an idea where I'm coming from, my wife and I have an open marriage, but at the moment, we're both satisfied with each other. Early days, we both went out on a few dates with other people. She never ended up going home with anyone, but I did. I don't think that speaks badly of either of us or our relationship, just that we've both decided to keep our sexual freedom, even in the context of our marriage."
sjwhate,3didpv,Nebulose11,12,Thu Jul 16 20:28:29 2015 UTC,"The guy is framing it as if he has to let his wife do what he wants and that he should just deal because if he doesn't, he feels as if he is trapping his wife into a certain form of sexuality.  I think this is where the misunderstanding lies.  He is not actually happy with this, he just feels morally obligated to allow it.  It is clear from the article that this agreement was not reached because it made both people happier.  He did it because it made her happier, and did not care that it made him distraught and sick.  Listen to this...how does one reconcile this?   That was two years ago, and today we’ve never been happier, more in tune, closer, tighter, stronger.    Later in the article...   There are of course moments of jealousy, resentment, and insecurity. Recently, my wife went on a date and fell asleep at his apartment. I hadn’t heard from her since 10 p.m., she still wasn’t home at 6 a.m. My texts went unanswered and my calls went to voicemail. A tight knot of dread lodged in my stomach as I imagined all kinds of dire scenarios and realized that I not only didn’t know where she was, I had no idea whom she was with.    This does not sound like a person who is genuinely happy with this.  This is how I can tell he is not quite thinking for himself.  He says he has never been happier and yet he admits he has these moments where he feels jealousy, resentment, etc.  and being physically sick not knowing where she is.  You'd think she would at least tell him she is spending the night with so-and-so.    Now I don't know how most open relationships go, but I am going to go out on a limb and say that you don't get jealous and resentful and physically ill not knowing where your wife is as she is being plowed by someone else.  This is the type of thing a normal person would put their foot down about and at least iron out the details with their partner.    That is the disconnect.  From reading the article, he justifies this by saying it is the adult thing to, and the morally right thing to do.  He is clearly not content with the arrangement by the things he admits to, but he believes he is doing the right thing.  It is not much different from a woman taking a submissive role in the household that they are unhappy and unfulfilled with personally yet does it anyway because they feel a sense of pride in following god's law or some other moral code.      At some point, he needs to take care of what makes him happy as well.  It is sad and infuriating to see someone deny themselves happiness out of a sense of moral duty imparted to them by an external system of thought like a religion or an ideology.  This guy is clearly not cut out emotionally and psychologically for an open marriage like that.  It is a shame because he is attached now, but he should have found someone who also expects monogamy.  This is a compatibility issue that cannot be resolved any other way than a divorce or someone just quietly suffering with the arrangement.  This is like when one person wants to have kids and the other doesn't.  Usually it ends in a breakup or it continues with one person feeling the same levels of resentment and insecurity the author admits to having.  That just isn't healthy.  Monogamy versus polyamory should be talked about WAY before marriage, just like the want for kids.  This isn't something you just drop on your spouse mid-marriage and just expect them to deal."

sjwhate,3didpv,Nebulose11,-8,Fri Jul 17 12:13:01 2015 UTC,"If they're both ACTUALLY fine with it, I honestly don't see anything wrong with it. As long as they're both safe and nobody's getting pregnant in the process, seems harmless. There would need to be some amendments made to what adultery is, otherwise why get married? One spouse or the other could change their mind in a fit of rage, sue, and start stupid shit like separate households, child support, alimony etc. etc.. seems like a classic setup for a feminazi  trap as well.  In general, its not ""your duty"" as a feminist man to let your wife fuck other dudes... its your duty as a feminist man (by the sensible definition) to decide if she sprung this bullshit on you all of a sudden with no prior conversation and decide whether or not you want to deal with that situation or deal with being married to that person at all. Have a conversation, any serious relationship is about honesty, compromise and cooperation; not servitude and hierarchy. This could lead to divorce but worst case scenario: you don't want to but still say yes, she can bang other dudes anyway and end up with a shitty marriage filled with resentment. This guy has kids so I think at this point if he says he's not okay with it, tough shit for her, she should have brought it up (and this is a like a key conversation and important point before marriage, jesus christ) or thought about it before they were married with kids. Learning to accept your role being married with children is better than cucking your husband, filling your marriage with tension and affecting everyone involved. That really seems like the type of responsibility that trumps just wanting to get fucked every now and again, single people only have that luxury because the have so much less responsibility than someone who's married with a household and children. I would say the same thing about a situation where the genders roles were reversed or the same because thats how equality works.  TL;DR If this guy has truly come to terms with it, that's fine for him but it is dangerous to say that its your duty as a feminist to break the laws of marriage and your values when they're violated by a woman because she's a woman. This quote really makes me think its a double standard: ""The point is that it should be women who choose, not men — even the men they’re married to."" Honestly, it sounds like he's clinging onto a gross and illogical generalization to repress his feelings of resentment and degradation. So in order to accept it he has to tell himself that if he didn't, he'd be disrespectful to women and because he does, he's some kind of feminist marvel.

The problem with point 1 is, the confederate flag was popularized by segregationist parties 100 years after the civil war, and for a hundred years was largely forgotten.

The thing is there was not just one country flag for the confederacy because they honestly could not agree on anything. They actually had states threatning to leave the confederacy it got so bad. That is one reason there was so many flags because none of the states could agree on just one.

They took down any links to other parts of reddit.  FPH was exemplary well run, and had a true sense of community.

The subreddit, nor the moderators ever received any sort of warning from the admins regarding this supposed rule breaking.

On one hand I like to see the hate on the tumblrinas who say fuck beauty standards but only want to fuck guys who're 6'4 with abs and pecs.  On the other hand, there's a bit of crazy talk too. I've seen posts saying that all overweight people think it's not their fault and that overweight people trying to eat healthy and work out are just as bad as the landwhales mentioned above. ""There's humans and then there's fatties"", as some of them put it. Not to mention the obsession with bullshit BMI when there are much more legitimate indicators like BF%.

sjwhate,3d0f7a,grumpnotso,4,Sun Jul 12 14:23:34 2015 UTC,"I mean, I don't agree with everything any single group has said. Also, while I never even visited FPH, even if a user said something I found offensive and of poor taste, I may engage that person and voice my own opinion or view-point, I may down-vote them and move along, but never would I seek to silence that person.    The only time I feel people should lose their right to free speech, is if their speech is harmful to others, or is extremely dangerous rhetoric. For instance, if I met you in real life, and you were black, and I started heckling you with racial epithets, I should be shut up. If I started advocating the genocide of black people online or in public forums, I should be shut up.  A joke you don't find funny or find offensive? I should not be shut up."
sjwhate,3d0f7a,_Brimstone,5,Sun Jul 12 15:01:41 2015 UTC,"Where do you draw the line at 'harmful speech'? Other than 'yelling fire in a movie theater situations speech is not 'harmful, behaviors are. I say feel free to 'say' anything you want as long as it does not cause physical harm. I think we have to protect even the most reprehensible speech not just the funny stuff."
sjwhate,3d0f7a,Ridid,2,Sun Jul 12 15:58:46 2015 UTC,"Harmful speech (speech I feel should be silenced) is speech that can cause harm. Simple as that. Speech advocating violence against another person or group of people is the biggest one, and it's fairly black and white.  Speech that could incite violence, chaos, or danger to other people. A perfect example would be yelling ""FIRE!"" into a crowded, confined area. Again, pretty black and white.  The one harmful type of speech that can be contorted to fit people's agendas is speech that is used to systematically target or harass a specific person or group of people.   Some people may say, ""Well, FPH targeted and harassed a specific group of people"". No they didn't. They made jokes at the expense of a faceless group of people. They didn't target any singular group or person in specific and harass them.  I even think you should be able to voice racist opinions, like ""I think black people are stupid,"" or other things like that. I think that speech is reprehensible, but instead of trying to silence that person (which in their mind gives them more credence), I will voice my counter opinion and naturally more people will agree with the more reasonable view point, and that person's voice will be drowned out."

Who cares what walmart sells? I just don't think the government should be formally recognizing or honoring a group of people who nearly destroyed this country in the name of slavery.
sjwhate,3d1uky,senpeters,3,Mon Jul 13 04:14:59 2015 UTC,I think you are missing the point. It is basically giving reason for people to call the ban for things in a louder voice because said thing happend. It would be like them taking down tony the tiger because he is an active dude so he is fat shaming and ableist. Making fun of kids in wheelchairs or are diabeld because they can't do what he does.
sjwhate,3d1uky,senpeters,2,Mon Jul 13 04:37:14 2015 UTC,I think you're missing the point. It's almost as if you're saying the flag should have never been removed just because some other people might try to take advantage of the political climate.  Obviously people are trying to piggy back their social justice movement onto this political issue.  It's no different than the otherkin trying to latch onto the LGBT movement. It doesn't make LGBT rights any less legitimate.
sjwhate,3d1uky,senpeters,2,Mon Jul 13 04:58:44 2015 UTC,"lets see if I can put this right. People have been trying to get the confederate flag removed for years, but it has not really happend because of no one really listening to the far left. Now that is what most people are doing it seems and they seem to think that with the removal of the flag that suddenly racism and those thoughts they think it insipires will be gone with the flag. But it has not, it has simply made the people who use it as a symbol of racism as fuel against the left and drives many of them underground. It makes them stronger because it makes people angry that their freedom of speech is gone and therefore makes people who don't like SJW's have more ammunition against them.  So all it has done is given people more reasons to hate the left, empowered the right in some peoples eyes, and given the left free reign to try to remove other symbols they consider racist even if they are not and the people won't let them disappear. It has given the left that illusion of power and has done more harm than good."
sjwhate,3d1uky,redemptionquest,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:03:55 2015 UTC,"they seem to think that with the removal of the flag that suddenly racism and those thoughts they think it insipires will be gone with the flag   I don't think people believe this and it's not the primary grievance. It's just completely inappropriate for the same reason if Germany had a Nazi flag flying above their government buildings. We as a government and nation should not be flying flags of our enemies.   It makes them stronger because it makes people angry that their freedom of speech is gone   But no one's free speech was even impacted. You can still go out and buy a confederate flag and put it on your truck and front lawn. Personally I think it's silly for Amazon and Walmart to stop selling the flag. But they are a private business and can do what they want.   So all it has done is given people more reasons to hate the left, empowered the right in some peoples eyes, and given the left free reign to try to remove other symbols they consider racist even if they are not and the people won't let them disappear. It has given the left that illusion of power and has done more harm than good.   You're really caught up in this left vs right dichotomy. It has nothing to do with political ideology and has everything to do with the historic use of the flag. This confederate flag was never even the official flag of the confederacy. It was primarily popularized in the mid 20th century as a symbolic protest against racial integration in schools.  Regardless of how you feel about whether or not the flag should have been taken down, it never should have been up in the first place."
sjwhate,3d1uky,TheEagleEyedTiger,3,Mon Jul 13 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"I think I see  the main problem here. I am not refering to the removal of the confederate flag from goverment properties. Which I agree should be removed from flying by itself over the state building or something similar. Exception being the confederate flag in the texas state building as it has all six flags that texas has been under.  But I am instead refereing to the removal of the flag from retailers and other places that has been lauded by SJWs as a great impact against racism, specifically amazon, apple, and walmart. The thought that it is a great win against racism and the sudden outcry against anyone who sells the confederate flag, as exampled in another post on this subreddit of the woman upset one store was selling such items and called the police.  Where selling a flag can suddenly cause a panic by people and cause them to call the police. It is cause of concern for the impact of freedom of speech as it is a slippery slope where calling on ""Offensive symbols"" can seem normal and we can lose a lot. Such as the loss of the symbol of New Orleans. Because somebody called racism and calls for its removal, and suddenly they are given legitimacy because we have already removed one racist symbol lets remove others we have deemed bad.  As for legitimacy of the confederate flag, they technically had three flags. The problem for the south is that they could honestly not agree on anything and even had members threatening to succede from the confederacy. So something as simple as a flag had  three official flags, each of them flown over portions of the confederacy or used by regiments.   That was one of the main reasons that the south could not win, is because they had more trouble agreeing on basically everything at the national level.  The blue crossed red banner was actually the battleflag of the virgina army, taking the crossed blue red square of the confederacy's 2nd and 3rd national flags. But as usual for the south even these flags were never really agreed on or used, because again they could not agree on shit, it was not until the middle of the civil war that they started to get their crap together."

Is sinking a restaurant gonna stop people from having individualized racist thoughts and behaviors? No its just an excuse for people to say ""oh you go to Cracker Barrel? I don't eat there cause I'm a fucking hero to the blacks. You eat there? Sounds a little racist to me... myeeesss..."" while the chain miraculously (/s) stays afloat because its successful people like the place.  The Duck Dynasty thing is crazy, I thought people were mad because he said something racist, not spoke about his experiences being poor and white in the south.. Just because there's racism you can't be happy, hard-working, and living as an individual with the hand you've been dealt? There's a lot of Chinese, Middle Eastern, and Mexican immigrants in America dealing with discrimination who would tell you otherwise.. I guess every black person before and during the 60's just had to be a sullen brooding mess? How could people get mad about that Duck Dynasty fucking nonsense. Its stupid to assume that before Civil Rights black people didn't have the right to be happy humans and therefore not a single one was. even if they recognized how they were disadvantaged and just tried to live and get over it like any functional determined person would, you can't talk about that part. Its like when SJWs say ""we've come nowhere since slavery..."" Stupid bullshit.  Chic Fil A, a place with a CEO with Christian values has anti-homosexual beliefs?? WOW WHO KNEW. Its too bad the CEO of Chic Fil A is the legislative arbiter on all things gay... if only their chicken wasn't so good gay people would be accepted! ..Unless these are ALL personal decisions and beliefs we're allowed to have in America and good chicken has nothing to do with that. And no matter how much money he gets he won't ever get away with or be capable of genocide against all homosexuals or something batshit insane.  If you want to fight real racism be apart of things like suing the Cracker Barrel in Georgia for mistreating blacks at with permission of the management, there's real causes fighting real discrimination you can fight and you'll still look like a fucking saint. The only problem is they're harder to find nowadays because people are less racist, better off financially, kinder, and more accepting. Not perfect or close, but MUCH better. If SJWs learn to deal with that we'll finally be able to address real issues rationally and directly."

I’ve been a fan since the mid-90s and have shelves full of his work. A couple of years ago he started doing the occasional alternate incentive cover for Marvel’s comics, never a main cover and always priced out of the hands of anyone except serious collectors. Last year SJWs got wind of a cover he did for Spider Woman #1. They then proceeded to caterwaul online enough that Marvel pulled the cover. A chase cover that was gonna cost like $20 and many stores probably wouldn’t even bother stocking."

Feminists who support women gaining respect by respecting themselves (because obviously you can't expect others to show you anymore respect than you show youself, and honestly for the most part you can expect less than you show yourself) are doing it right. Why is this perspective being shamed? It is what the world (and women) actually NEED."

sjwhate,3c4za5,FuckedUpLuck,3,Sun Jul 5 11:15:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's ridiculing the hypocrisy of holding contradictory views, not the individual view itself.  It's the whole ""the media sexualizes women"" while ignoring the fact that the media they criticize is consumed mostly by women and therefore the sexualization and unrealistic standards are actually mostly perpetuated by female consumers, rather than some evil Oz trying to make women's lives harder.  It''s the old ""women are adults and have agency"" spoken out of one side of the mouth while saying ""women are victims of the media"" out of the other.  Which is it?  Are they helpless in the face of pop culture beauty standards?  Or are they adults capable of making their own decisions and being responsible for their own actions and emotions?  You don't hear MRAs crying about unrealistic body/personality standards set by professional athletes and comedians, because we all see men as adults who are fully responsible for their own decisions and outcomes in life.  It's time feminists stop the doublethink and choose: should we treat women how we treat men, or continue infantalizing them and treating them like children?  You can't have both, that would be (and as pointed out in the video, is) hypocritical."

He's missing their point for one, nothing those girls say implies that mens' sexualities are socially constructed but rather that the media is constructed to cater to it, which it undeniably is. Now, who cares what Laci Green has to say anyway, she has a massive case of cognitive dissonance (like too many people on any side of any issue if we're being honest) so back to the burka and hibjab supporting feminist. Watching her original video now and it is brilliant, her entire point is that not objectifying and sexualizing yourself, as a woman, undermines capitalist media (again because it DOES pander to mens' sexual interests) and again this is precisely what the world and women NEED. The end of her video is her explaining that women who play into the slutted up media standard are enforcing gender based power structures - because they are. If Thunderf00t's point had been to point out the hypocrisy of demonizing slut-shaming while also shaming the media's slutty portrayals of women Hanna Yusaf would not have been included as she clearly does not hold this contradictory belief.

sjwhate,3c4za5,FuckedUpLuck,0,Tue Jul 7 18:21:50 2015 UTC,"Cosmopolitan appeals to (most) women because it features sexually charged imagery of women and posits itself as a tool to trump up your own sexuality, as a way of being more appealing (mostly to men). Every issues features sex tips to ""drive HIM wild"" how to do your makeup, carve out your body and change every other little thing about yourself, not for yourself but for men. Using female sexuality to sell products exclusively for women still caters to men for this reason. Women do not enjoy feeling jealous (SOURCE: I AM A WOMAN). Personally I can think of few things I like less (though your insistence that I enjoy jealousy - with all other forms of gaslighting - very much up there!). You know where I do enjoy getting that kick to which you refer? Physical activity.   I have more than enough personal experience to know that large breasts and/or butt is enough to exceed the beauty standards of many men, but the idea that women are to be exploited is perpetuated in the media (again, in part by women exploiting themselves within it). The more you fit the typical guys standards (yupp, that's pretty low) the more objectification you receive from strangers. I don't wear often make-up because I view it as for special occasions and often times when I leave the house I purposely look unflattering to deter comments, persistent requests for a date etc. It never helps. I really can not think of anything other than the way sexism is perpetuated in the media that would invoke such behaviour from complete strangers.   When I asked ""who"" I was referring to people with some semblance of intelligence in general and specifically you. Obviously she has a large following.   Buzzword? The main stream media is undeniably (but no worries I'm waiting for it!) a function of capitalism, and it is this main stream media which we are debating about. I can simply call it the media if you prefer. (Honeslty, I thought bitching over something as silly as a word was an SJW thing.)  Respecting oneself and rejecting the media standards is the exact opposite of being helpless in it's face. That was never the view being argued here, much as you've tried to prove it is. The expressed view is that women need to stop objectifying themselves/allowing the media to do so if we ever expect men to stop doing it. Again, this is feminism doing it right.   No worries, philanderer and man-whore are words I often use as well. Would a man hater really be a slut-shamer? Or do I simply hate everyone? That must be why I can't agree with you, I'm merely a hateful bitch. As Hanna points out in her video, it really depends why the woman wears it. If it's to reject conventional beauty standards perpetuated in the media then, yes it does challenge those roles. I don't see gender roles as wrong or right, they're the norm and playing into them is as fine as breaking out of them - so long as it's what you're comfortable doing. Many things reinforce them, wanting people to respect themselves more does not.   The first line of your last comment is precisely that he is pointing out said hypocrisy. Perhaps you should review the things you've said before commenting back? (Though you should find, when arguing with both conviction AND logic you have no need to do so.) But good on your for pointing out why we're back here, just try not to project your flaws on to others next time? Keep addressing me like I'm a feminist, it's really cute. Especially since I so enjoy slut shaming and other things prominent feminists would abhor - like taking responsibility for my own actions! You can't even manage not to contradict yourself in a single reply ... that is impressive, perhaps you should become a feminist? A complete lack of logic is on your side!  I included Malala because I agree with what she and this woman have to say. I don't pander because I don't give a fuck who agrees with me and who doesn't. That's part of being a strong person.   It's a forum on the internet, the fuck could I possibly be trying to accomplish?"

Definitely not ""leftist thinking.""  Just as a monarchy isn't ""right-wing."" It's a totalitarian state, which is what the Founding Fathers revolted against. Leftism (e.g. the Democrat party, socialism, and communism) would have been opposed by the Founding Fathers as they create an unneeded dependence on the federal government.  So, yesterday you celebrated how intellectual Libertarians created a country and then you falsely attributed that to leftist ideology. Good job, maybe next week you'll be brainwashed into thinking that Abraham Lincoln actually was a democrat, or maybe that a flag can be racist."

And this makes sense to you?"
sjwhate,3bxhcw,modern_rabbit,2,Mon Jul 6 05:33:00 2015 UTC,"Again, I know this is very hard for you to understand. Here, I will repeat some of what I said previously so that you may understand it better.   the party that best encapsulates the vision of the Founding Fathers is the Libertarian Party  modern leftist parties do not encapsulate this vision  ergo, the Founding Fathers possessed what are to be considered modern Libertarian beliefs, as the Libertarian Party is based around individual freedom and strict adherence to the Constitution.   Do you understand now or shall I have to bold it for you as well?  Moving on, hopefully... the Founding Fathers were not left of center. They were centrists, and due to the shifting political compass across America's existance they would be in favor of the modern definition of socially liberal and economically conservative. Thus, Conservative-Libertarian.   I will define American conservatism for you, on the off chance you have no idea what it means besides ""fag-hating, bible-thumping redneck.""  Conservative: believing in slow, cautious change and a strict adherence to the US Constitution. Conservatives are usually split up into two groups: Far-Right conservatives, and liberal conservatives. Far-Rights are against the legalization of abortion and gay marriage. Lib-Cons (Libertarians, mostly) don't care about what is ""morally right"" as long as it doesn't interfere with the constitution. I.e, they'll leave you alone to your life. That's as good as it gets, imo, to be able to live your life as long as it doesn't get in the way of anyone else's.  I accused you of falsely calling the Founding Fathers leftists, as they obviously were not.  Leftist ideologies are as follows:   pro gun-control  pro ""socialist policies,"" i.e. greater dependence on welfare and social services    Said services and the ideas thereof did not exist until after the Great Depression and FDR's New Deal.   expanding the role of the federal government into people's lives through ""popular"" decisions   Example: the legalization of Gay Marriage. I, for one, approve of the idea of gay marriage but I do not approve of 9 people (the judicial branch of the federal government) making that decision for the entire nation when the Tenth Amendment clearly states that ""all powers not exclusively given to the Federal government are automatically rendered as the responsibility of the individual states."" That means that the states decide if gay marriage should be legal, and honestly given enough time most/all states would have legalized it in our lifetimes. However, because it was a popular decision (who's going to say ""NO"" to gay marriage, right?) nobody challenged it. Thus, the federal government's power goes unchecked.  The Founding Fathers opposed every single one of those leftist tenants.  Disprove me."
sjwhate,3bxhcw,Fallen_Angle,-1,Mon Jul 6 06:08:49 2015 UTC,"I never said ""modern"" leftist. You did. You falsely attributed that to me, called it wrong thus creating a principle for consistency, and then immediately ignored that very principle thus being logically inconsistent. You yourself claimed that I was wrong by claiming that I attributed modern leftism to the founding fathers (and that this isn't accurately descriptive), then you yourself attributed modern Libertarianism to the founding fathers.  The founding fathers were mostly leftists by virtue of being left of center. Many of the features of their ideology and the tenets in their writings are still leftist, and were mostly leftist for the time period. Those Libertarian features you are seeing? Those were left of center in 1776. I.e., leftist. Many ideals you would consider conservative today were leftist then.  As you yourself said, modern leftism has changed. I don't think you realized how, because only one of your examples  encompasses a minority of leftist ideologies (""pro-socialist policies""). And, believe it or not, expanding the role of federal government into people's lives is also a very Fascist belief, with the understanding that people are naturally irrational and need government control. Fascism is very, very conservative, yet it's also leftist?  You're also taking a very naive view of conservativism. These aren't just political ideologies; you can't compare conservatism's social aspects to liberalism's financial aspects, for example, and call it an accurate comparison. Conservatives (of which Liberatarians are a part of, not a complimentary group or some such nonsense like you seem to think) care very much about morality, as does literally every other person, everywhere. Modern conservatives care about the Constitution, but the ideas the ideology is founded on existed long before the Constitution. Protection of minority rights from majority rule is the single most basic tenet of conservatism, contrasted with the leftist idea of supporting the majority.  Realism (vs idealism), and traditionalism are other basic and so far unchanged tenets. Would you call the founding fathers realists? Traditionalists? Did they protect the minority opinion from the majority? You could say they did in the sense that they wanted religious freedom, and then say they didn't in the sense that itself was a majority opinion. Traditionalism has resulted in different features in different cultures too; for example, liberal economics are seen as conservative in the U.S. because the U.S. was originally and traditionally liberal economically. Christian moral theory and adherence to the constitution are features of U.S. conservatives due to tradition as well. Some features that are attributed to conservatives are really just conservative political parties taking opposing sides on issues to spite other parties; gun control is both a far left and far right policy, for similar reasons: an armed populace is tough to oppress.  So, to sum it up, you only gave a single leftist tenet in your examples, and that suffers from the same problem as we had before: modern Socialism isn't the same as it was when it was in its infancy, right around the time of the revolution. At the time it was the belief that there needs to be some minimum level of control over mercantilism, precursor to modern capitalism. As the majority of the founding fathers were Federalists, they can be said to have supported similar ideas though I do not know if they were explicitly aware of the existence of Socialism.  While not declaring whether they (the Federalist Party) were primarily left or right, they were supportive of a mercantile economy as an alternative to the existing plantation-based economy, but they also supported the idea of a strong federal government so that states wouldn't be forced to individually deal with their own or other states' problems (and economic bullshit).   Starting to sound less like the ideology you know and love? Actually, this polarization we see today didn't even become a thing until the mid-twentieth century. Party loyalty was nearly nonexistent, and parties weren't measured on a right-left axis outside adademia. But something you should note is that today's liberals become tomorrow's conservatives. Your views were once further left than they currently are, because leftists love change and conservatives hate it. I'm deliberately using ""leftist"" instead of ""liberal"" for most of this too, because while liberals are leftist, leftists aren't necessarily liberal and there are some very distinct and disturbing non-liberal ideologues in leftism. I personally believe the right-left axis, or newer double axis, isn't adequate to measure the difference in direction of most ideals anymore, as Social Justice Theory is no friend of Liberalism."

I used to date a woman who wrote for a large city newspaper, and she never set out to be biased against republicans, but I could always point to things in her article that would give that impression.  I used to drive her nuts with that one.  There are a lot of things that cause that to happen, like confirmation bias, but to be honest most reporters are on tight deadlines and have to churn several stories a week, don't have the time to research every individual aspect of a story, and have to rely heavily on sources.    There are a lot of questions that should probably be asked of a source in the course of an interview that you don't think to ask based on your bias.  She would think of every one you'd expect, but it wasn't hard for me to suggest a question after the fact that might have changed the whole story when we'd talk about it.  The look on her face every time...she didn't want to admit she was biased because she honestly was working very hard not to be, but I could tell she was a little miffed with herself every time we had a conversation like that.  There are a lot of scumbag journalist who will lie and spin to get the ""narrative"" they want in their story.  Sadly, they probably represent the vast majority of successful media personalities, but I'd be lying if I said I believed everyone in journalism and media was a lying sack of shit."

They can't 'opt out' of racism through their own education or enlightenment, because they were raised to be racist by society.  Being an 'individual' that tries to step out of the racist factory (society) and not be a racist, is an example of the white person's privilege.  She thinks that all white people are just mindless drones who are unable to think for themselves and are at the mercy of the racist ideals of the 'system' that they were raised in. White people are essentially dogs to her who have been taught by their master to bark at black people and have no capacity to do anything other than what they were taught to do. I guess white people who don't believe in santa or the tooth fairy are utilising their white privilege because after all, society instilled that into them at a young age. How could they possibly change their beliefs if society said otherwise?  Ironically, this entire self-indulgent video is based on the fact that she can see all of this for what it is, whereas white people can't. Why else would she make a video explaining this to us?  By her logic, all white people are doomed to be racist because they were 'raised' to be. If they try to step outside of what they were 'raised' to be, then it is just an example of their white privilege.  However, for some reason this woman is not bound to these same constraints. Her mind is so superior to all white people that she is able to transcend all of society's pitfalls and see the world for how it really is.  tl;dr Her stance - people can't think for themselves, except for me.

sjwhate,3bgflb,BooleanParity,5,Mon Jun 29 16:21:25 2015 UTC,"I would encourage you to read up on Michel Foucalt's concept of ""biopolitics"", because it's exactly what you describe, though he imagines everyone is guilty of it. Social reform is impossible, in his estimation, because the oppressive structure of our society forms us to participate in it. We can't change the structure because we are its creations; we are blind to its true shortcomings.  But here's the funny thing about that: if we're formed purely by our society, and have no individual ability to rise above or reform the structure, then we're all victims. Every last living creature in the system.  I wouldn't argue that, as a black person in America, you have a set of cultural prejudices working against you. I think it's fair to say that elements of ""the system"" in which we live are oppressive to black Americans. And it's not the fault of an individual black person; they're born into the system.  But what about privileged members of society? If I'm raised by a racist society and conditioned to be racist, am I not also a victim? My mind has been poisoned by toxic, racist ideology, which I cannot rise above.   The SJW problem is this: society is oppressive, and certain people oppressed by it have NO CONTROL WHATSOEVER over their oppression. Women, non-whites, LGBTQQIP2SAA, etc. bear no responsibility for the conditions of their lives, as they are unable to rise above the oppression in the system. No one has moral agency... except for the people outside of fixed groups. Straight white cis-men are fed the exact same toxic culture, and are trapped in the exact same machine, except they're considered responsible for it.

sjwhate,3b8skt,triggermethis,2,Sat Jun 27 00:05:41 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there is no single source.  I'm an avid amateur student of Roman history, and have spent a lot of time studying their society and the Latin language which I find beautiful and  fascinating, if ultimately pointless.  This post has been forming in my mind for a few weeks now.  If I was to point to a source for more info on the way Romans saw the world, it would be the work of contemporary writers like Plutarch, particularly his ""Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans"".  Who better to describe the Roman view of the world than a Greek like Plutarch who spent most of his life around them?  If you have six or nine months to spare, and enjoy good quality historical fiction, I would recommend Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series.  Seven books, around 1000 pages each with extensive notes on her research, she really managed to use the primary sources to get inside their heads and present a very Roman view of the history of the fall of the Roman Republic, and of the Roman view of their place in the ancient world."
sjwhate,3b8skt,triggermethis,0,Sat Jun 27 00:20:50 2015 UTC,You're not a Catholic too are you? Pox on the Pope.  I took latin in grade school because everyone said it was a dead language. At the time I just wasn't infatuated with learning a new language as I was with drawing in my notepads and having my head in a book not pertaining to class. I enjoyed the history aspects very much so though and still do.  9 months is quite the laborious amount of time but I may give it a glance or two. But I've haven't yet read a Greeks description of Roman life and times so Plutarch will definitely be getting some reading.  Thank you.  Sin Cera
sjwhate,3b8skt,triggermethis,2,Sat Jun 27 00:52:18 2015 UTC,"My dad encouraged me to learn Latin due to its complex grammar - he was adamant that it helps to understand English grammar more thoroughly.  In the process I fell in love with Roman culture and history.  If those were the aspects you enjoyed, you'll enjoy Plutarch.  He writes with a nice mix of anecdotes about the individuals concerned which give a wonderful flavour of them as people, and the wider historical events in which they participated."

However, my understanding of english is so much greater as I understand the roots of many words at a much deeper level, that I really value those lessons now (35 years later!).   Typical example -  the word ""Amateur"". It comes from the latin root amo- to love. It doesn't mean shoddy, it simply means done for love not money.

Cis- was a prefix that is also used for other words. I first learned of cis- from chemistry, as it was the opposite of trans- in terms of structures (essentially, cis- is a straight molecule, and trans- is a bent/kinked molecule). (This is where you get the term ""trans fat."" God forbid SJWs ever try to appropriate chemistry and biology...)   I'm willing to bet that cis- was used in many other words in their vocabulary that didn't just pertain to the Gauls, as trans- was and is. (We see more trans- words in English than cis-.) Although this is an interesting piece of history, I'm not sure we can completely say it is ironic that SJWs are using a word that was used to segregate, as that may not be the only use or cultural significance of that prefix in Latin/Roman days."

SJWs start flinging shit, and as soon as people get angry and disagree, the disagreement is what gets reported on.   Feminist Frequency is probably the shining example of this. Poorly thought out, illogical criticism of games. Theft of intellectual property (to save time actually playing games). Lies about actually playing games, before or after starting the tropes series. A fraudulent Kickstarter. FemFreq is a dirty operation putting out nonsense content, but then Anita gets to go on Colbert and talk about how she was a victim of harassment.  I used to think atheists had it bad in debates. When atheists apply logic and point out certain nonsense religious arguments, they get slammed for being disrespectful. At the same time, however, everyone respects their freedom of speech and a lot of people respond with attitudes of, ""You're not wrong, you're just an asshole."" But when you're opposed to any form of social justice, you're assumed to be an evil hatemonger would couldn't possibly have a point."

Anger is essentially nature's drug. It dulls your aversion to violence, it numbs your fear, and it makes you strong. Helps you to protect yourself, your resources, and your family. And it feels good until you come down.  SJWs are almost all addicted to self-righteous rage. And unfortunately, a lot of us on the Anti-SJW side suffer the same habit.

sjwhate,3b0te0,modern_rabbit,-8,Thu Jun 25 03:44:07 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate SJW's, I have to agree with this. The confederate flag is a blatant symbol of racism. Despite what the more educated rednecks say, the confederate flag is not about small government vs big government. The confederacy fought to preserve slavery and to protect their belief that blacks are lesser beings suitable only for manual labor. The confederate flag is as much about small government vs big government as the swastikas is about rebuilding a country after harsh, postwar stipulations. So yes, the confederate flag is the american swastikas. It is a symbol of our radically racist past and should not be celebrated by anyone who claims to be educated, independent, and/or not racist. If you flaunt the confederate flag, just admit that you're either ignorant, gullible, racist, or all of the above so we can move on."
sjwhate,3b0te0,Ohnf_DIG,4,Thu Jun 25 07:45:58 2015 UTC,Equating the Confederacy to the Nazis is like equating Putin to Stalin. Just because they're both bad doesn't mean they're equally bad. It's ridiculous hyperbole.
sjwhate,3b0te0,dragoon508,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:54:49 2015 UTC,"I was not necessarily equating how ""bad"" the Confederacy was to the Nazis. I was how trying to demonstrate the flawed logic in defending the symbol of an oppressive government by overstating their ""good"" intentions. Yes, it was big government vs little government, but mostly it was about enslaving people. Just like Hitler was trying to rebuild germany after it was devasted by post WWI stipulations, but the most decisive aspect of his regime was the creation of the Nazis and the Halacaust. People always try to undersell the Slavery aspect of the confederacy to make their racist ideology seem more tolerable. There are lots of bad people who had good intentions. Abortion bombers have good intentions. Islamic terrorists have good intentions. Hitler had good intentions. They a fought/fight for something they believe in, but no one says, ""Hey, good for Isis for defending their religion!"" Or ""at least hitler was trying to help his country"" or ""you know, those abortion clinic bombers really made some good points in preserving the morality of this country."" Thats why they have the saying, ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions."" People say, ""oh the confederacy wasn't really about slavery?"" Really? That's like saying, ""the Nazis weren't really about killing Jews, gays, gypsies, etc."" Really?"
sjwhate,3b0te0,Ohnf_DIG,3,Thu Jun 25 23:17:13 2015 UTC,"Well you are semi right, remember that it was not just the issue of slavery that they left the union. The main issue was states rights which had been brewing for generations at that point. Slavery was just a part of the issue of states rights. You also had Tarriffs being a problem."
sjwhate,3b0te0,FuckedUpLuck,0,Thu Jun 25 07:57:14 2015 UTC,"I've heard this argument before actually; that there were certain economic factors that led to the conflict between the north and the south/confederacy and that emancipation wasnt the sole purpose of thr conflict. Regardless, I still think that the confederacies main drive was the preservation of slavery. The way I see it, if my neighbor has music that is too loud, and I call the cops (which isn't the necessarily the right way to handle it) and the cops consequently find out that the guy is selling drugs out of hisapartment; just because I overreacted doesn't put the drug dealer in the right because... Well, he was selling! Regardless of the true causes of the conflict that begot the confederacy, had they won the civil war slavery would still be in practice; that would have been the single most drastic outcome. flying the confederate flag states that you are sad that the conferacy lost and you would have preferred the alternative timeline where slavery, arguably a crime against humanity, would still be in practice and the open, explicit belief that blacks are lesser beings would be perpetuated and acted upon. That is why I say the confederate flag is racist. There is undeniably a culture of explicit racism in the south, and the Confederate flag is a major aspect of that culture. I don't think every person in the south should be held accountable for every hate crime, but I think we should acknowledge the relationship between a racist culture and hate crimes and what symbols like the flag of a Confederacy that fought to preserve slavery do to perpetuate such cultures."
sjwhate,3b0te0,FuckedUpLuck,2,Thu Jun 25 08:22:54 2015 UTC,"Well, slavery was an economic factor. Do you understand the economic value of such a huge labour force?   But yes I've heard it mostly came down to ""economic factors"" as well."

I really don't know (or care) too much about the American South but it very well could be symbolic of big vs. small government in modern times. More importantly this is in response to what a clearly very unstable and racist individual said and it is being done, not to in any way solve the larger issue (gun violence and general legislation regulating firearms in the country). They are doing it not for moral purposes, but to appease a disgruntled and probable majority of the population who want to see domestic shootings end (or drastically decrease). What they are actually doing is enraging many of those who already subscribe to this ""gun culture""."

sjwhate,3b0te0,FuckedUpLuck,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:54:05 2015 UTC,"Okay, just wanted to make sure I understood you. I get what your saying. While I do think moving/removing the confederate flag from the state house is an important step, I think that people are going too far in trying to make the flag illegal or trying to ban production. If anything, this is an infringement of the 1st amendment and would only make the racist culture in the south more resilient. You can't force people to be less racist. So I agree with you there. However, I would argue that limiting guns wouldn't stop murders any more than it would stop suicides. Sure it makes it easier, but people find a way. When you wake up and make the decision to murder a bunch of people, not having guns isn't going to stop you. If you don't have guns you make a pipe bomb or a maltov cocktail or drive your car through a crowd. People find ways. Mass murders don't wake up and think, ""huh. You knkw , I have all of these guns laying around, gathering dust. I should probably do something with them. Come to think of it, I have been wanting to kill people lately!"" To illustrate my point even further, everyone e in Switzerland has an assault rifle, and how many mass murders and shooters do you hear about? And its not because the guns serve as a deterrent, because people don't carry their assault rifles with them everywhere they go. Its a difference in culture. We didn't make the swastikas illegal, or ban production. We just all acknowledge that the only people who have any business buying/owning them are museum curators and hate groups and that it is a hate symbol. The south needs to come to this same conclusion about the Confederate flag, but it needs to happen naturally. We cant jusy have a big ol' flag burning ceremony and say ""congratulations! The south is no longer racist!"""
sjwhate,3b0te0,Ohnf_DIG,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:28:05 2015 UTC,"Can you really think of anything that would stop murders? Also we aren't even talking about murders in general but rather specifically mass shootings. Look at literally any other developed country in the world and it's quite clear that if there is gun/ammunition control and, most importantly, proper background checks for those who wish to procure firearms you don't have several mass shootings every year.   Switzerland has very tightly restricted and controlled ammunition (like Canada, but stricter), that's probably got a lot to do with it. Doesn't matter how many guns you own if you can't get bullets for them.  To illustrate my point even further how about we look at Sandy Hook in Newtown Connecticut on December 4, 2012 and contrast it with Chenpeng Village Primary School in China ten days later. They were horrific days for both elementary schools as viscous psychopaths bent on blood shed entered each institution. The man that entered the primary school in China was armed only with a knife, being unable to acquire any other weapon. 26 children stabbed in the neck. 2 hospitalized, briefly. 0 died. ZERO. Again limiting guns won't stop murders. Nothing will. Limiting guns will limit these mass shootings and that is the problem that NEEDS to be addressed. Not racism or some dumb flag.   I'd also like to note that museum curators are not the only people with an interest in historical items. Symbolism is interpretation so it's a personal matter. Perhaps it's a hate symbol to you but I can still see it being ""big vs. small"" government to many. Especially in the current social/political atmosphere in America. If you're honestly waiting for things like racism to be completely eradicated at any point .... Please, do hold your breath!    (I'm not some anti-gun nut either. I eat venison regularly. My father shoots it. I grew up around guns. If he didn't laugh at me everytime I asked I would also have my licence, go out into the bush - during hunting season of course! - and shoot me some deer.)"

Here in the UK, and in many US states and other countries, gay marriage has passed into law which is a great thing. Fortunately, most straight people were supportive and rightly condemned any suggestion that being gay is a 'choice', even when it was 'just a joke', because that's scientific bullshit which hinders a genuine human rights struggle.  This is no different. I actually thought the original post was quite clever and funny, but I think it's inappropriate to share this when the majority in our society refuse to accept that being transgender is a real, biological thing.

They don't decide that based on some ""feeling"" they are going to act like the opposite sex.  What we should be doing to address the .03% of humans that are fucked up in the head enough to think that it's somehow ok to pretend that the body they were born into isn't what gender they are is treat them with therapy and medication just like any other mental patient, instead of encouraging them to put on the massive band-aid that is gender reassignment surgery and applauding them for being such ""courageous"" little special snowflakes."

Most importantly, I can make the very obvious distinction between an actual conservative and some uneducated, xenophobic, insular Tea Party hick. To me those two things are apples and oranges even though they are on the ""conservative"" side of the coin.

This isn't a gloat here: In my life, I've lived in a ton of places that traverse the conservative and/or liberal spectrum socially, and In college I took numerous off-campus classes here. I myself graduated from this fucking place, which is just down the road. And if she stayed in campus housing, I might even have even lived in the same fucking buildings as Ellen Pao (as architecture students at Harvard stayed on campus with the business students when I studied there, and fuck if I'm going to give any of these institutions money ever again given the way they are sadly shifting). Point is that I've been brought up amidst this shit first hand and seen all this shit first hand, just like I've was raised by my family and neighbors in the south where every other word is nigger this and nigger that. (my brother lives just two blocks from here, NO joke). I've seen the benefits and disadvantages of all areas of these places. I can speak from first-hand, long term experience. What have you (rhetorical) got?   I'll call out a Tea Party hick just as fast as I'll call out a neo-nazi feminist SJW piece of trash. I don't give a fuck what side of the fence a person is on. Having moved around, seeing slice after slice of Americana garbage, social shortcomings stand out (and incidentally, no place feels like home anymore). Trash is trash, period. I don't care what part of the country it is, or what a person's persuasion is, or what your foundation or upbringing is. If you are closed of to ideas, talk, communication, logic, or whatever, and wear bigotry like a badge of honor, you're invalid from the get-go. And for me, I'm fucking PISSED and beyond disappointed that places that raised me are going SJW. I might hover around the ""liberal"" end of the spectrum, but believe me, I'm beyond disgusted (read: jarred) at the recent social trends. It's fucking looney, anti-logic, feelings-before-thought shit. It's deranged. And for some god damned reason people are pandering to it and caving to it.   I keep seeing more of this Conservatives vs. Liberals shit on this sub more an more lately. Even worse, more of a Republican vs Democrat thing on this sub lately. It's stupid.

Is Steve Wozniak 'little above an animal' because he's overweight? He's made poor choices and is quite lax about diet and exerise, but why exactly does it make him just above an animal? he sure as hell is a lot smarter than you are. Because he doesn't look good? Ugly people are animals now? Or is it because he's unhealthy, so smokers just are like animals now? Or maybe it's because as you put ""couldn't control his most base instincts"", but then surely that means heroin addicts, alcoholics, sex addicts are all just above animals as well?   The problem is that you have deluded yourself in to putting down people who you have a superiority over in one instance (they're fat, you're not), and I'm willing to guess you have close to zero aspects of your life where you have superiority over anyone be it intelligence, athleticism, social skills, good looks etc and then need to insult fat people so severely to try and make up for these incompetencies.

What sort of advesity do you think a child is ment to overcome? That treatment such as that would make them develop a backbone? That they are to blame for their parents actions?  I did eventually develop a backbone and social normalities, far to fucking late to spare the embarrassment of childhood. Not through harassment but through separation and the development of the understanding that these words meant nothing nor were they doing it to help. But to make themselves feel good. Still dont consider myself normal, but normal enough to fit in.  The message im trying to get across here is that yes it is goof to point out these destrutive and abusive habits should not be aceptable. But to take that from criticism to bullying, harassment and bigotry will not help any sort of change. Which frankly isnt what fatpeoplehate is about, it was never about changing these people, all about shaming them and their way of life. Dont kid yourself as to thinking your doing this for good."
sjwhate,39t3td,lordsiva1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:55:45 2015 UTC,"When did I say I was special for that? That wasnt the point of that statement. My point was that the bullying I received did not have any positive effect in which that outcome arrived sooner.  The title of this is the positive effects of bigotry and harassment. Im pointing out that those two prospects rarely provide positive effects and are just bully tactics that mostly result in negative effects.  Im all for telling fat people that their lifestyle is destructive and should not be acceptable. Neither do I give a shit about what others want to think or do I want to police said thought. Instead I have my own thoughts that I will express. That it is delusional to think harassment has positive effects. Maybe in the minority of cases, but for the majority you are just pushing them deeper into self denial and more extreme levels of destruction.  Now I have rarely been on fatpeoplehate let alone read the comments. But from the subreddits name containing the word 'Hate' and that most of the titles I saw were for mocking hamplanets im not sure where you got fatpeoplehate wasnt about hate.  Being subscribed to sjwhate makes it very unlikely im a fascist or a thought policing nor have I said anyone should be punished for what they think. I just rather hate on SJW's than fat people.

They cease to mean that you hold certain ideals, but are instead labels to indicate an allegiance to one inner-party or another.  In this sense, yes. They are 'liberals'.  But that's only true in the newpolitik paradigm, not in the real, historical meaning of the word 'liberal', which is still struggling to survive in the world beyond the United States.  Horseshoe theory is very relevant here.  SJWs are dogmatic, bigoted authoritarians, which is hardly a traditional 'liberal' trait.  It might be that they hold a few certain social positions which would be supported by liberal enlightenment ideals, but those are cases of being right for the wrong reasons. They are more libertine than they are liberal.  Their justifications are emotional, not rational.  They seek to enforce their aims by fascist tactics, the most disturbing of which is a disregard for due process.  Hence, they are definitely not liberals in the traditional meaning.  They have more in common with Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church than they do John Locke and other enlightenment thinkers.    Indeed, they'd probably be dismissive of Locke's philosophies, simply because he was a 'privileged white man'."

For example a government could have a tight grip on the public sphere (business regulation, etc) without butting their heads into private people's business (who marries whom, who smokes what plant, etc).  Though that is not to say that I don't acknowledge the history that as a government becomes more entrenched it always seems to become more authoritarian to protect itself."

sjwhate,39v43x,sizzzzzzle,10,Sat Jun 20 17:08:14 2015 UTC,"Both of these terms have become so fluid now, it can mean almost anything to anyone.  I can only give you my take.  When I look at a liberal from a social perspective, I see someone who tends to put social equality and progress over traditionalism.  From an economic perspective, it seems to be more command-and-control to ensure no exploitation happens vs the economic conservative paradigm, which is more about controlling inflation and debt and maintaining more of a laissez faire free-market approach to the economy.  Both have their advantages and disadvantages, but to stay on point, this is how I see the difference between a liberal and a conservative at a very high level.  This is just so I can define what a liberal is in politics from my perspective before comparing this to an SJW.  There are a few differences I see from your standard run-of-the-mill leftist and an sjw.  The first glaring difference is the authoritarianism that is integral to what and SJW is.  To be clear, I am defining authoritarianism as the belief that safety, order, and a working power structure take precedence over civil liberties and freedoms.  This manifests itself in the SJW through ""safe spaces,"" censorship mentality, ""trigger warnings,"" calls for bans, removal of due process and the presumption of innocence for rape cases, etc.  You will even see a leftist feminist like Naomi Wolf disagree with the last point here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CQ6SonOfVI  Now I don't necessarily agree with naomi wolf in general, but by comparison to feminists in general, she is far more reasonable (if that really says much at all).  This is one of the examples where a typical leftist would side with naomi wolf and the SJW would side with Maureen Tkacik.  Take Sargon of Akkad for example.  There have been some posts of his videos in this sub recently because of his routine criticisms and breakdown of modern day feminism as an opponent to gamergate.  That man has said multiple times that he identifies as a leftist and a ""classical liberal,"" which is comparable to a libertarian (not like the libertarian party), center-left liberal, which I, and (according to the political compass test) gamergate members fall under in general.    Sometimes when liberalism is foreign enough to you, you tend to see them as ""all the same"" without being able to see the distinction between different groups within liberalism.  Almost like the meme about how some white people can't tell the difference between multiple asian people yet those asian people can tell each other apart easily.  Sometimes it requires a certain level of familiarity to pick up on some distinctions since they are nearly invisible to the untrained eye.    The second main difference I see is the setup of a narrative to justify hatred or bigotry.  The typical leftist, at best, will argue rationally and make their case for their beliefs while also appealing to the moral sensibilities of the listeners. At worst, they will paint all who disagree with a broad brush and make tons of emotional appeals and bully people into submission.  SJWs do the worst of what typical leftists do and more.  The narrative is king with the SJW and it is how they control the dialogue.  If you are a white cis male, they have already rigged the game against you before the discussion even starts.  The narrative of the privileged bourgeois (you) and the oppressed proletariat (them) gives them all the justification they need to ignore criticism and continue hating.  Facts don't matter.  Identity matters.  If you have identity X, you need to shut up and check your privilege.  Otherwise, you can say the sky is purple and those with identity X cannot say anything without being accused of <demographic-i-dont-like>splaining and silencing the minority voice. This is where the ""progressive stack"" comes from and this is why the term ""social marxism"" has stuck so well in association to the sjw.  ""You have enough wealth mister bourgeois, we are going to take some away from you and give it to miss proletariat over here and ensure that this cannot happen again by dismantling the power stucture and making a new one.""  ""You have enough places to talk mister white man, here it is our turn, so shut up and listen.  And btw, you are now going to feel what it is like to be us in your society.  YOU SHALL FEEL OUR PAIN.""  Finally, it is the level of collectivism in relation to identity politics.  Liberals in general tend to be collectivist, but the SJW takes it to a whole new level and applies to identity politics.  For example, they treat races and genders like monolithic entities.  If some white men have done bad things, it is as if they all did and they all share responsibility.  Notice the classic SJW criticism to detractors is accusing them of making the ""Not all X"" argument.  What they are really doing is justifying their guilt by association reasoning.  This leads to the ""original sin"" philosophy like what you see in the bible.   Here is an example (see the point on denial of cultural responsibility):   https://archive.is/ZuV5w  If your ancestors were slave owners, it is as if you have owned slaves yourself.  There are plenty of comparisons with the religious right and SJWs, but this already a wall of text so i won't get into that.  TL;DR - Authoritarianism vs Libertarianism, the victim narrative, and (collectivism)2"
sjwhate,39v43x,Mykeru,7,Mon Jun 15 05:37:54 2015 UTC,"Look at The Political Compass: www.politicalcompass.org  Usually people deal in terms of the left-right axis. There's also a libertarian-authoritarian axis. Generally, in the U.S. we associate ""Libertarian"" with only the right-libertarian axis.  Authoritarians, rather than having the ""agree to disagree"" attitude of Libertarians (left and right) believe their ideology allows the imposition of it on everyone else they can subordinate and the silencing, if not outright elimination, of opposing views.   ""Authoritarian personality is a state of mind or attitude characterised by belief in absolute obedience or submission to one's own authority, as well as the administration of that belief through the oppression of one's subordinates. It usually applies to individuals who are known or viewed as having an authoritative, strict, or oppressive personality towards subordinates.  Although Soviet-style Marxists are authoritarian, and some SJWs are Soviet-style marxists, not all are. The authoritarianism has less to do with the details of ideology, per se, than with its exclusive nature, the need to impose it on others and, more importantly, elimination of all opposing views.   TL;DR: Social Justice Warriors, unlike classical liberals (and right-libertarians) , are Authoritarians and Eliminationists."
sjwhate,39v43x,Mykeru,-6,Mon Jun 15 10:46:41 2015 UTC,"Well if you have extreme liberal views and are an authoritarian, then you're on the far left.

I'm perfectly able to image that someone can believe in, say, a ""left wing ideology"" without necessarily being authoritarian about it.    Yeah, it's called being left wing. I don't think you know what left and right politics are.  You are confusing the far left with the left.  E: I took a look at the UK election 2015 on the link you gave and saw that who ever typed that has no clue about politics.  They have the Labour Party on the right, that party is the leader of the opposition and are the ones who are making everything a hate crime. The reason they ended up losing the election was because they were criticised for being to far to the left, so I don't know how whoever wrote this put them that far right. Labour is the U.K's liberal party.  They have the DUP and UKIP as being almost Authoritarian, another laugh I had. Again both these party are centre right, all of the U.K parties on the right are for free health care and support a benefit system to some degree. All right wing parties here believe in democracy and there is no way any of them are close to becoming authoritarian, the only misconception would be that the Conservatives hold an outright majority and so can pass any laws regardless of other parties opposition, but that is democracy.  Seriously the person who wrote this has no clue. I am even more in doubt of this up and down shite after reading that."

Traditional or typical libertarianism is ""left"" on social issues and ""right"" on fiscal issues.   You know what that's called?

If you think Libertarianism is the only centrist view, you again have no clue what you are talking about!

No it just means these left of centre parties have now become left wing or far left in part but no one has changed their label yet.  Its also prudent to point out the hate speech laws are a direct result of trying to appeal to minority votes that could swing an election.

Their perpetual feelings of inferiority run so deep that they have come to define themselves purely as ""rebels against oppressor X."" They don't know who they are if they don't have anything to fight against.  Ever see what happens when they get exactly what they want?

Feminists are afraid white guys are Muslims in lurking, while ignoring the Muslim rape pandemic, because of fears of being called racist.   Social justice warriors are hurting the civilized standards of society by attacking the innocent for fear they'll become evil, while ignoring the evil because they excuse it, as long as it is a group higher than themselves on the victim hierarchy.

Methods of testing were extensively monitored,  and set to isolate non dominant muscle groups.  FYI this link is to a download of the scanned paper.

The first article does group largely towards the actual muscle observation,  sizing and grouping patterns,  not very thorough,  but fills in the missing part of the other study.    My thought on the issues with Fallon Fox participating, would in fact be addressed in the second paper i sent you.  In it,  it addresses the fact that in studies,  granted from 1967, showed no significant difference in strength between prepubescent males and females,  but that differences in strength and size appear during and finalizing after puberty.  That said,  Fallon Fox was 31 when she transitioned.  Though having lower testosterone levels,  and coupled with hormones and surgery,  her natural testosterone would be the equivalent of a born woman using steroids.  She,  even now would create more testosterone than a large majority of women could naturally.    Though not definitive,  i believe that is what gives her an extremely unfair advantage"

From anti-rape nail polish to the ""hairy leg stockings"", women are expected to take precautions to prevent rape. The responsibility for rape is placed upon the shoulders of women, which feeds neatly into a culture of victim blaming and slut-shaming. The idea that women are ‘asking for it’ if they’re drinking or out late or wearing a short skirt or walking home alone, is very pervasive.   No. No the responsibility to prevent rape is not placed squarely on women. Yes, rape is a terrible thing, but most men won't rape women. Most women will not rape men. Most people are not rapists.  Criminals do exist, though. It's why things, even rape, are illegal. It's also why everyone has to take precautions to avoid being a victim of crime in general.

Later that night while semi-unconscious, she is sexually assaulted. Did she 'deserve' that kind of violation? Of course not. She is the victim of a heinous crime that should be punished to the full extent of the law. It would be absurd to imply otherwise. But did she put herself in a vulnerable position to be victimized? Absolutely. The problem with SJW feminists is that you can never, ever, explain situations like this in that regard--if you do, you're ""victim blaming"". All they care about is enforcing their own agenda and politics, they don't actually give a shit about preventing sexual crimes or teaching people behavior that can and will prevent these kind of violations from occurring."

There are some cases of this approach having worked, but they're few and far between and you only know what's public. Ads are bought in flights, in cycles, and more often than not, when a company ""pulls them,"" they just let the ads expire and shuffle the money.   I assure you, companies are going to give zero fucks at all about your request for them not to advertise here. Literally zero. Reddit makes money a lot of ways, and it's not all just display ads.

They just wanna demonize anything  that is straight white males. Just think of how stupid they are, there are millions Of people around the world starving to death and shitting in the streets and these self important dunces think they are making a difference by whining over the lack of female characters in video games. It's actually quite hilarious. They are just a very loud and very obnoxious minority, and the only reason they get any exposure is cuz we argue with them, when we should just be placing them on The ""pay no mind list"" Look at any fabricated online ""controversy"" over the past year, these bitches cry about it, and make some dopey hashtag and then it goes away 2 days later. And the people that chose not to acknowledge them, are always the ones that have to the stuff go away ever faster  If you want to see a truly wonderful video, check out comedian Jim Norton debate with ""queen of the dopey feminists"" Lindy West.

As Reddit tries to Facebook itself, it has become home to a whole lot of really clueless people, which means that the votes of the higher quality users are less important.

It's almost too absurd but would you believe that i was banned from FPH a month+ ago, for upsetting some feminists?  Lol.  Unfortunately the story got deleted from my posting history today with FPH's demise - i was pointing out the obvious, namely that  feminists are statistically more ugly than the non-feminist female population (in reply to someone's post which said ""feminists are not ugly"") - thus ensued the deluge of downvotes and my ban (of both accounts).   The fact that I'm a woman myself didn't go down too well either, but i'm used to get much more irate reactions for my antifeminist sentiments than males do - ""gender traitor"" is just one of the mildest things i get called.   So i relocated here to lurk.   In that respect i was your untimely migrant from FPH, but for an entirely different reason.       Now, i do dislike the fats in general just as much as the next sane person, but I hate SJWs hundred times more. SJW is the bottom ring of hell in my books - always been -, with no redeeming feature whatsoever, no matter what. The fact that even FPH was soiled by SJWism i found somewhat ironic.  Even more so that now it got banned by a raging demented litigation-champion feminazi Chairman Pao. (All that said, i'm extremely pissed off by its ban, as FPH was pretty much the only sub i ever frequented - with 99% of my posting history being there.

More to the left from them are the reasonable conservatives like libertarians, less government, less policing, pro-capitalism, and pro-dowhateveryouwant; all they want is personal liberty all the way up until there is a real victim or property damage. Then further left you have the traditional idea of ""liberal"", kinda socialist and also for individual liberty like libertarians but they want a bit more government intervention for social programs for the betterment of everyone. Move more to the left and we hit the SJW. The SJW advocates for complete government control of your daily life (like the faaaaar right) like thought policing, and equality of outcome (levelling everyone to the same playing field is not enough for them, they want the scores fixed at the same position for everyone). They are actively against giving everyone the same rules.   In conclusion, SJWs are left, but they're just so far to the left that they've also gone too far.

What does matter is our Constitution, which is our supreme governing document.   And as the SCOTUS will soon tell you and everyone else, our Constitution provides for equality.     The prohibition of same sex marriage is unconstitutional.   It is not a close legal issue.  Deal with it."
sjwhate,391yre,lordsiva1,2,Tue Jun 9 03:41:55 2015 UTC,"The prohibition of same sex marriage is unconstitutional.    I gotta disagree here. Marriage itself is a religious construct. Mostly seen as a vow of servitude and bond between one man and one woman in the eyes of god, before the state.   I myself am not 'religious' but I understand the religious point of view and anger they feel towards the government coming in and forcing their institutions, by law, to grant marriages to same sex couples, which in their eyes is sin.  Not only that but the constitution grants that there will be a separation of church and state. I see, that by the state imposing it's laws to force religious institutions to grant same sex marriages, it is a very obvious severance of this separation.   So you can see why the religious are angry that they must cow-toe to 'liberal' dogma that we are all equal and yada yada. Equality is a false god but that is an argument for another time.  I personally wish the state would just grant same sex couples with civil matrimonius unions for those who wish to reap it's benefits and undertake the ceremony, completely separate from religious institutions to grant both parties what they wish.  But then we wouldn't have the outrage we all love so very much, would we?"
sjwhate,391yre,triggermethis,3,Tue Jun 9 05:14:52 2015 UTC,The law does not force religious institutions to grant marriages if they dont want to.  It gives the right for gay people to get married. Get the same benefits as the married.   Marriage can be performed by anyone with the proper certificates and are not bound to a religion. See other faith marriages and atheist marriages.  A marriage has always been a recognition given by the state/government that 2 people have formed a living unit. Cultures have used religion to give marriages more weight.
sjwhate,391yre,trollfessor,0,Tue Jun 9 07:34:48 2015 UTC,"The law does not force religious institutions to grant marriages if they dont want to   Ah, but this is incorrect.  When a same sex couple goes to a religious institution to get hitched and the institution refuses based on their beliefs, the couple is becoming more and more capable of dealing punishment to the institution through means of the state.   It is becoming more and more frequent. Just a quick search shows this.  http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/10/20/city-threatens-to-arrest-ministers-who-refuse-to-perform-same-sex-weddings.html  https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/judge-rules-christian-facility-cannot-ban-same-sex-civil-union-ceremony-on  http://www.christianpost.com/news/church-of-england-to-be-sued-for-refusing-to-perform-same-sex-marriages-just-a-month-after-prime-minister-promised-protection-101487/"
sjwhate,391yre,triggermethis,3,Tue Jun 9 21:12:14 2015 UTC,"You must honestly not be able to read. The only one that even hints at forcing religious institutions to perform same sex marriages is the last one and that due to European Union humanitarian laws and not that of Great Britain laws. Which ever it falls Great Britain will not do so. We already have enough problems with the EU this is just another loophole that will not be tolerated.  Onto the first one. They are not being forced to perform chritian weddings. They are being forced to peform weddings due to local state laws and the state buildings listed as for profit and not churhces and religious buildings must, if they provide weddings, do so without bias. As a for profits building cannot have religious exemption this is then the case. Mabye they should just list themselves as a church or close an apparent loop hole in which you can be either building types and thus be subjected to conflicting laws. Again they do not have to perform Christian weddings, just normal weddings as part of the law governing for profit wedding services.  To the second one. It is again not forcing religious institutions to perform weddings. Again is a genuine case of non bias policies. You cannot deny the hire of a building to a person due to their sexual orientation if indeed to rent the building out as they are.  Weddings are being held their, in a building owned by a religious organisation, but not by the religious organisation.  All your examples apart from, if we stretch it, the last are not forcing religious weddings. Just the right to a wedding in a place in which no religious laws hold sway."

sjwhate,391yre,triggermethis,2,Tue Jun 9 21:34:14 2015 UTC,"You can disagree all you want, but you're wrong.      Briefly:  marriage is a specific contract that the state grants certain benefits to those who enter into it.  That some are prohibited from doing so without just cause clearly violates the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Constitution.      Further, churches will not be forced to perform same sex marriage, despite the hysterical claims of some people to the contrary.   As proof of that, realize that no church is required to perform interracial marriages, despite the SCOTUS saying that interracial marriages cannot be prohibited.     This upcoming decision will be a learning opportunity for many people, and that is a good thing."

Many of the rituals and ceremonies were based around certain rites of passage, such as birth and marriage, and these events were usually celebrated with a banquet that sometimes included music, dancing and food, though the food available was determined by the social status of the family.

Second, if we're going to believe books that aren't based on fact... then I have to worry that Captain Hook is gonna come take my children in the middle of the night.  Third, let me ask you... based on FACT, not the Bible, why is gay marriage moral and wrong? Don't quote the Bible, don't paraphrase telling me what it says. Tell me from a realistic, legal, society-based, equality standpoint... why it's immoral and wrong.

Doesn't Christianity teach the Golden Rule of ""Love one another as I have loved you""? I was raised Catholic, so I'm not inexperienced in the teachings. That being the GOLDEN RULE, it should supersede ALL other rules of the Bible. Ya know, much like ""Judge not, lest ye be judged"".   Gay marriage in a Catholic or Christian Church is like a Reuben sandwich in a Kosher deli. People want 2 things to be together that either religion says is NOT allowed. What do you do when you want a Reuben and the Kosher deli guy says ""no, we don't do that here""? You go elsewhere and just know from now on that they don't believe in it because of their religion. You don't try to force them to do it just because it's what YOU think should be allowed. Vice versa, they don't lecture everyone who eats Reuben sandwiches, calling them derogatory names because THEIR religion's book says it's an abomination. They just live their fucking lives and do what they believe in.

sjwhate,38sflb,NaGeL182,2,Sat Jun 6 17:33:59 2015 UTC,"There isn't much to review...its basically many tropes gender-bent and told in a very bad way. Of course this is an RPG maker game  You're a houseman(houswife) who has no job and cleans, cooks, etc. and also plays games!... which is important because in that universe guys are the minority.. the oppressed...   so yeah in the morning you wake up early and watch some game trailers  especially about the ""Tomb Runner"" (tomb raider) and how the main character who is male is believable and you want to get it.    Then you wife wakes up and demands breakfast. and you need to do it.. and you get a timer about 45 sec to do it. After that is done you wife goes to work and you need to clean the house watch TV(horrible doctor who reference) after that go shopping.  in the shop which is a game shop there area lot of made up game + one of their other game which is called the Front liner or some shit. it has a a horrible flash style trailer and the whole game is about illegal immigrants trying to get into Europe and their struggle...  Of course there is a Call of Duty Parody there, that your Wife asked you to pick up.  So you ether buy the overpriced CoD copy or you try to argue with the shopkeeper to buy your tomb runner and call you a fake buy nerd and co.  After all that yo go home and on the way home you get cat called and shit by teenage girl(!). I have to say that you area grown up man. anda teenage girl is cat calling you. after you go a few steps another teenage girl assaults you. and the two of them wants to rape you.  Which is stopped by a random woman that after the  encounter suddenly levels up(my reaction: Wut?)  after she rescues you she ask fora kiss as a reward. This is of course harassment. and you gonna deal with it that way. So after that you go home and get ready for the dinner party. but before that you have to clean yourself up and get the option to take a sleeping pill. or take ""alot"" of sleeping pill.  didn't try the third option but i guess its the option to kill yourself.   after all that charade your wife  gets home and of course brushes off the whole thing that happened like its nothing then orders you to cook the dinner and take an anti depressant.   So you cook the dinner to progress and then comes the guests and one of them is your savior. while the whole dinner party is going you get the ussual feminist bullshit just genderbent and shit. Even gives you the option to tell on your ""harasser/rescuer"" no matter if you kissed her willingly or not. (I did)  After that the whole gaming shit came up with the arguments of   some kind of feminist test if the woman is represented correctly, half of the gamers are man, etc. the usual stuffs. Of course everyone dismisses you.   After the whole dinner party you want to go to bed, but suddenly a woman bursts into your house and knocks you out and kidnaps you.(Wut? Wut?)  Suddenly you are in a dungeon.  with a cell mate, who tells you who kidnapped you, why, and that this is normal so just wait.  basically this is the damsel in distress trope.  So your instinct? Escape. which you try. And fail. and comes a monologue about "" I didn't write the rules."" etc and sit tight on your butt.   Next seen is that your cell mate gets rescued by his girl, but leaves you  there because ""it would upset your girl""(Wut?3 )   So next scene you get rescued finally. and you're full of shit. and even your thanks is like that. ... next scene is that you are divorcing your wife and suddenly the computer speaks about the ""truth""  and you are being offered the red(lie) and blue(truth) pill.  if you take the red the game begins again. if you take the blue you are told that there isa world where thesame thing happens just the genders are switched shown tweets by femfreq, a few of the critiques  that is shown as harassment and a few tweets that is actual harassment(the twitter account that has nothing but rape threat towards Anita)   and tahts the game... its bad. an d i already deleted it. don't want to touch it again."

For instance, the Clonycavan Man, a 2000-year-old male bog body discovered near Dublin in 2003, was found to be wearing a mohawk styled with plant oil and pine resin.[4] Artwork discovered at the Pazyryk burials dating back to 600 BCE depicts Scythian warriors sporting similar mohawks. The body of a warrior occupying one of the kurgans had been scalped earlier in life and wore a hair prosthesis in the form of a mohawk.[5] Herodotus claimed that the Macai, a northern Libyan tribe, ""shave their hair so as to leave tufts, letting the middle of their hair grow long, but round this on all sides shaving it close to the skin.""[6] Among the Pawnee people, who historically lived in present-day Nebraska and in northern Kansas, a ""mohawk"" hair style was common. Pawnee father and son, 1912 When going to war, 16th-century Ukrainian Cossacks would shave their heads, leaving a long central strip. This haircut was known as a khokhol and was often braided or tied in a topknot.[7] During World War II, many American GIs, notably paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division wore mohawks to intimidate their enemies. It was also occasionally worn by American troops during the Vietnam War.[8][9] In the early 1950s some jazz musicians,[10][11] and even a few teenage girls, wore them.[12]"

I think people associate atheists with liberals because they tend to think of religion as a personal choice, as opposed to the one correct way of living like you'll hear a lot from the extreme right.

Failing to satisfy those needs to whatever extent is just going to lead to a massive amount of depressed teens. And I mean actually depressed, not the self-diagnosed depression tumblrettes these days are so fond of."

There's 6 different pairings of the sex chromosomes known to exist but, like with syndromes like Down's or Williams, are suboptimal. X (Turner syndrome) and XXY (Klinefelter Syndrome) cause physical developmental disabilities, like sterility and looking like a freakin monster. XXXXY causes mental developmental disabilities. XYY hasn't been reliably demonstrated to cause any abnormalities, and always presents phenotypically as male.  Just like Down's and Williams retard development and thus aren't supposed to happen, Turner's, Klinefelter's, and 49 XXXXY shouldn't be considered new sexes. Jury's out on XYY because for all intents and purposes, it's male."

It's not that anyone's hiding it's the fact you'll get insta banned for showing support for the Conservatives or UKIP and the fact the sub's populated by liberal dweebs.  I have an account that's actually managed to last a few weeks over there so far, but I think it's because I mentioned that a lot of people were getting banned on what was supposed to be an unbiased sub. I swear to good a few people actually pm'd me agreeing because they didn't want to get banned.  I mean the subs got good posts about the U.K and that's the only reason I browse there occasionally.

One of the reasons we have such a mess now with the extreme left is that the right got do demonised that being right wing became a joke. The media pushed the religious right so hard that the left become as extreme in response.

""Do not insult, antagonize, interrogate or criticize the OP.""  criticize 1. indicate the faults of (someone or something) in a disapproving way. 2. form and express a sophisticated judgment of (a literary or artistic work).  Don't speak your mind or question what's being said, unless you're being spooper accepting! We would like to keep this as a circlejerking hugbox.  But seriously, they probably misunderstood you and thought you were making a blanket statement for all feminists, and not just referring to the crazies.  They probably figured the bit about the truth lying somewhere in the middle was unwarranted advice, too. Or maybe the OP from that thread stated their feminism, and the mods thought you were insulting them indirectly with that crazy feminist bit. I dunno.  Pretty shitty on their part as administration to resort to being vague and insulting because they're too lazy to explain what someone did to break the rules when they don't know how they broke them. If their job is to keep the community in good condition, would it not be better to help people learn from their mistakes? Instead of creating this negative environment where they try to intimidate and shame people into behaving a certain way.  Ban the repeated offenders, the ones who refuse to change or troll, not first time offenders who make honest mistakes. Sure, it gets tiring, but it's the job you signed up for, and most jobs are tiring anyway.  Part of me gets the feeling they didn't actually want the job, they just wanted the title along with power to push others around.  It's one of the reasons I dislike SJWs. Seems they tend to create highly destructive environments, and again, seem to run on emotions instead of logic. They'd be detrimental to human advancement.

Night, by Elie Wiesel - WW2 German concentration camp survival story  Light In August, by William Faulkner - Hard to be concise with the story, but partly follows a possibly mixed race man and his internal and external problems caused by his mysterious heritage living in 1930s Mississippi.

sjwhate,37kry6,Delusion_Of_Adequacy,5,Thu May 28 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"Ffing hell, 'teach guys not to chase women'. It's called biology, guys chase women, because we are still animals at our core, and our main purpose is to survive and reproduce. Especially those hormone-filled teenage years result in guys trying to do what comes naturally: reproduce as much as possible, with as many partners as possible, which gives the highest chances at successful offspring and subsequent reproduction. However, the demasculinization of men, the suppressing of normal boyish behaviour, and the demonizing of normal sexual urges on the one side, and girls and women being told they're precious, unique snowflakes who don't need no man on the other side, results in a forced suppression of these natural urges and needs. Teaching boys to further suppress their natural instincts isn't going to help anyone; it'll only make things worse."

sjwhate,37kry6,DutchingtonNJ,2,Sun May 31 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"And why should average young guys lack the self-awareness to accept (or be kept in the dark about) their relative unattractiveness? We should grow up. We don't have to embrace our nature, but we should at least be knowledgeable about it.     The writer specifically renounces our nature. This means suppression of natural instincts which is unhealthy. Besides, the 'relative unattractiveness' of boys and men isn't something that's going to improve by teaching boys about it. This is due to society's glorification of women, and the growing consensus that boys or men are all potential rapists, and only interested in sex. Boys and men are being told it's not OK for them to be sexually active, or even to be aroused. This happens in the media, in schools, on the internet, etcetera. Teaching boys how unattractive they are isn't going to benefit the cause, it's only going to place even more guilt and pressure on the group, which is doesn't need."
sjwhate,37kry6,BuddhaRocks,1 point,Sun May 31 19:56:59 2015 UTC,"So instead, you wanna pamper boys like we pamper girls?  That's the 'healthier' choice?"
sjwhate,37kry6,goatman_sacks,2,Mon Jun 1 21:16:31 2015 UTC,"No. Pampering is never a healthy choice. I think we need to take a critical look at the way the educational system is headed. I'm not calling to pamper anyone, I'm calling for less pampering of girls. It's time to move away from the idea that both genders are identical. Both genders have equal value, but lately we've been seeing a lot of people trying to morph both genders into one, often quoting 'equality'. However, there are differences between men and women and between boys and girls. This cannot be denied, but still our educational system is aimed at female students and normal boyish behaviour is increasingly frowned upon. This creates a skewed balance and is dangerous in the long run.    Nobody needs to be pampered, but the fact is, today generally girls (and women) seem to get pampered a lot, and boys (and men) pay the price. Teaching boys about their 'relative unattractiveness' only reinforces the idea that all women are goddesses who should be admired by all men.

Any white person with even the faintest knowledge of history should curse themselves every single day for being white. Throughout all of recorded history, whites have engaged in oppression, genocide, colonialism, imperialism, and just plain evil on a massive scale.    Hyperbole aside, unfortunately some people with misguided white guilt do hold similar views.  It is an American-centric ahistorical understanding.    Sure a dozen or so European countries colonized and exploited much of the world for a few hundred years and did many awful things.  Not 'white' people, as such a concept did not even exist at the time.  In fact even in modern Europe the people's were divided by ethnicity and language, not skin colours.  As we all know, people like the Irish, highland Scots, welsh, Finnish, Slavs, poles, the whole Balkan and Baltic regions, and many white cultures were too busy getting screwed over themselves to be doing it to others.  You can't blame Finland for white colonialism when they were colonized and oppressed themselves.  They didn't benefit from this global exploitation.  That aside, we are talking about a relatively short period of human history.  The Mongolians conquered half of the known world at the time and raped, pillaged, tortured, killed and subjugated hundreds of other ethnic groups for almost 200 years.  Not many people remember that they burned their way deep into Europe, and conquered many countries which they colonized.  The horde made it as deep into Central Europe as Austria--which is ironically where another tyrant would be born...Hitler!  We can't look at modern day Mongols and say they don't have a right to exist anymore than we can say that to white people."

The article seems to be long-windedly trying to say 'we have to take responsibility for the current state of society even if we didn't cause it' His overall argument is stronger than you make it sound, and he's right to point out that responsibility ≠ causation, but I don't think the typical SJW appreciates this either so he's wrong to defend their whole movement based on that.   Of course we must (all) try to improve society, and that goes not just for structural racism but for the state of the poor white guy living off instant ramen. He fails to point out that the reason that some get annoyed over excess focus on the issues of certain groups (ethnic minorities, women, etc.) is because they feel that their own plights are being neglected or, in the case of the poor, even economically justified, in a way which those aren't."

The argument that David Wong was making here seems to be ""the current generation must take responsibility for the society that past ones have created"". He used this to defend stressing structural gender/race inequalities (which in itself is fair).  This of course becomes an problem when these issues are focused on at the expense of others or there are double standards or they are presented in simplistic black and white terms (as SJWs tend to do), but I didn't see the author condoning doing this other than by (seemingly but not for sure) glossing over  poverty as a less important form of structural inequality.  The title of this thread, despite being in quotation marks, was nowhere to be found in the article, nor anything which explicitly said the same thing.

The rest of the article didn't bother me, #5 was mainly a critique of individualism and I was okay with that. I read a couple of his other articles a few years ago and he never really stood out to me as being overly concerned with the typical SJW issues (identity in a broader sense yeah...).

sjwhate,37ah3k,wyrn,2,Tue May 26 18:51:37 2015 UTC,"I'm interpreting solely from what is written in that one article.  See, what he is using in this article is what is known as a ""motte and bailey"" argument. The term comes from medieval times: you, as a feudal lord, rule over a vast region where you spend most of your time and do most of your economic production. This is the ""bailey"". However, the bailey is only lightly fortified (if at all), so when attacked you retreat to the tower in the center, or the ""motte"", which is well protected but unproductive.  In this case, the idea that we are responsible for fixing past societal errors is the motte, while the idea that white people are responsible for white people's past mistakes is the bailey. It's similar in structure to how feminists will say ""We want equality between the sexes. Also, kill all men"". Equality is the motte, kill all men is the bailey.

sjwhate,36slbu,letuotter,23,Thu May 21 22:37:15 2015 UTC,"no no, this is spot on. im the #1 SJW hater on reddit but whoever said this is spot on. you shouldnt fuck with another family, no mater what. mind your own fucking business. getting your nose involved in places where it does not belong is the way of the SJW. its supposed to be the what SJWhate is opposed to, not the other way around.   i myself grew up half feral, and i will tell you that people choose to live in different ways. you may not understand them, and those ways may not work for you or your children, but for them, often it does.   you have no right to tell another family how to raise their children even if it is something you horrendously disagree with  yes, i know there are all sorts of instances of horribly abuse, and lets be real, life is life, some children have it harder than others and some even get abused to the point of death. its horrible, but thats the natural order of things. and frankly, its just not your problem, so why it make it so?  the problem is if you begin intervening, where you do draw the line? its the slippery slope thing. rules and laws start out tame enough, but they progress over time, before you know it, you have the government and child protective services telling everyone exactly how to raise their children and what to do. this is why we have parents being torn apart today because their parents decided to smoke a joint to celebrate their 25th anniversary. i personally think marijuana is a pretty bad thing too, but im not about to tell people what to do or rip families apart because of my personal beliefs.  thats the whole reason im here, browing and sometimes posting on this sub, because i that fucking mentality.  living out in the elements isnt that bad, ive done it before. the truth is, all of the safety and everything else about society is the lie out there is the real world, so whats wrong with raising children in it?"
sjwhate,36slbu,-IAmEvil,3,Thu May 21 21:21:19 2015 UTC,If a parent cant afford to house and feed their child they should try their hardest to find someone who can. The financial problems of parens should not be the child's problem. If I had children I couldn't feed I would try relatives first then failing that look into every possible avenue to ensure their continued health and safety.

Plus if I'm guessing you're American where you can't really be anything but left or right with their two party system, hoping to get anything other left or right in the U.S is a pipe dream and as already stated even the left of U.S  the Democrats is just as right wing, possibly more right wing than U.K Conservatives. It depends what country your in when you say left or right because even mongoloids with a snifter of knowledge of politics knows countries have different views on the Left/right wing.  Yeah in my original comment I stated the threat being left wing Liberals and you started complaining about how how you're a Libertarian, if you're a libertarian why do  you care about left wing liberals getting called SJWs, I mean if you are a Liberal it's a pretty hard sell to anybody when you say you're on the right.

sjwhate,36pliw,Trollioo,3,Tue May 26 22:11:44 2015 UTC,"It hasn't, that's the thing.  The start to EVERY dictatorial regime has started with the disarmament of its general populace.     Crime rates specifically skyrocket in the time when it happens.  It occurred in Britain, France, Austrailia, etc.    Know how Britain's crime rate dropped?  They had to employ roughly 7x more cops than they ever have had.  Price of a Glock: $500-800.  Price of a cop: $30000+.  Terms kept in USD for simplicity.  I estimate the salary of a cop, but the point is still there.    http://crimepreventionresearchcenter.org/2013/12/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/   The results of this paper support the hypothesis that concealed handgun or shall issue laws reduce the number of multiple victim public shootings.

sjwhate,36mco5,Kok_Nikol,4,Wed May 20 13:08:27 2015 UTC,"Former Boy Scout here.  Are we calling conservatives SJWs now?  BSA is a super conservative organization.  There are still troops out there who won't allow gays in.  I don't like them at all, but they are hardly SJWs.  They teach firearm safety in the scouts.  Part of firearm safety is to treat every weapon as though it is loaded, so never point it anywhere near another person.  While it seems stupid to draw a connection between water guns and real guns, this seems more like them trying to be consistent in their education on guns than being overprotective softies.    On top of that, I can remember many a water gun fight devolving into real physical aggression and violence, so this might also be trying to avoid fights on the campground.  It's lame, but not an example of SJW influence."

Not saying that their banning of water gun fights isn't an act of social justice warrioring, but the organization was started by the openly racist Baden Powell, not to mention that they  restricted homosexual boys until 2014.   Several guys that I got my Eagle rank with were arrested for neo-nazi related vandalism and harassment a few years later, and had their actions defended by the adults who were in leadership positions in our troop when we were still a part of it. Gonna go out on a limb and say that this isn't consistent with the views of a SJW.   Again, I agree wholeheartedly that banning water guns is straight up silly, but if you're looking for an organization full of SJWs and those who cater to their whining, the BSA is definitely the wrong place to look.   EDIT: Not to mention that the organization teaches proper handling of a firearm, and allows boys to fire real weapons. Allowing them to point ""firearms""(if you could call a super soaker that) at one another can be seen as counter intuitive to what they are teaching the kids."

From Wiki    During puberty, the physical traits of the syndrome become more evident; because these boys do not produce as much testosterone as other boys, they have a less muscular body, less facial and body hair, and broader hips.

We don't know if anyone in the video has a criminal record; the comment is that this guy ""certainly"" has a criminal record just for being there.  Maybe if black stood for 'had a criminal record' and white stood for 'doesn't have a criminal record' your analogy would apply, but would be wrong because the statistics are against you.  The stat I saw on like google was by age 23 49% of black males have been arrested.  So, that's just people arrested and the number is presumably lower if you're looking at people who have been charged or convicted.   It is statistically likely that a young black male does have a criminal record.    Technically, according to that stat (you may have different ones), this is incorrect. A 49% bet is not likely it is unlikely, though not by a lot. I don't know how much the numbers come down when you only look at convictions or charges.  It is statistically likelier that he has a record, compared to other demographic groups.  If you had said that, you would have at least been accurate.   Black dude is just jealous because he certainly has a criminal record    This is even more inacurate.

Threats, duress,  force,  and other similar actions done without consent to obtain consent.   It's that simple.  Not fulfilling your promises doesn't make it rape.  If that's the case, she raped him by lying about them being monogamous.  She's ridiculous.  Very much wtf."

sjwhate,352euj,oh_no_aliens,4,Thu May 7 13:00:22 2015 UTC,"As my post above states,  positive coercion is not rape and this would seem at first glance to fall into that category, which the OPs does.  However with a second look you have to understand the terms of consent.  They involve a single other person,  one whose identity is known (when consenting to sex with a stranger,  the identity of the person is a stranger, which carries this identifier even if it is technically a lack of identity).    For example,  if two women consent to sex with each other,  and during the process one of the women turns out to be a man and has sex, to which she'd consented,  under these false pretenses,  I assure you, this would be rape by surprise as well, and rightly so.      Identity of a person is one that is limited to the static nature of identity.  That is the physical identity of the person.   Unlike a situation where someone states that they're a male model but really work at burger king,  which is not part of the static identity of a person, it is a situation which offers the chance at a positive return for the involved party, that is,  respect from friends,  self confidence at having bedded a model,  the prospect of dating a male model,  and so on.    This falls into the class of positive coercion.  It isn't right,  but it isn't illegal either as it has no bearing on the nature of consent to have sex with a person of a stated identity.      Another example of this which I think is best relevant and may make the whole thing a bit clearer if it isn't.    Let's consider that there is a male model,   same guy she expected it to be.   She skypes with him, sees that he is indeed the man she believes,  talks with him on the phone,   makes a plan to meet up and she goes and has sex with him with the lights out,   only to find out it was his brother and not the person she believed he was.   This is clearly a case of rape as she consented to a person she believed held a specific identity,  and the brother is not who she consented to.   Whether catfishing for lights out sex or swapping out the actor,  it's still rape by surprise and I find that a very valid situation.      Another case would also be twins,   a twin pretending to be his brother and sleeping with his brother's wife should be rape.    I don't see a problem with any of this.   But girl in the OP is straight ridiculous."

Man takes excited customer's investment,  buys a nice car and pays rent.   Man goes to work  the next day at his job at Golden Corral ""Customer"" never gets a return on his investment.   By your logic,  this is okay, because it's no different than an investment in a real business that failed.   Loss is loss.   The thing is,  this isn't true.  Because in one case the identity of said company is not real.  The company is the core of the matter.  The consent to use the invested cash is granted to a company that does not exist.  This is fraud.     With sex,  this is along similar lines, though it is not a monetary value.      In this case someone consents to sexual interaction with another person.   A person in this is defined by their physical identity (DNA, Appearance,  etc.).   If this is misrepresented for the purpose of obtaining sex,  it is absolutely going to negate consent.    Another example would be a guy.     What if a man met a woman online and she told him to meet her at her apartment,  and come in and she'd give him a blowjob,  but she's shy,  she doesn't want him to see her,  so leave the lights out.   He goes, and then finds out that it isn't actually a woman,  but another man.   This is sexual assault.  Just as it would negate consent if a woman was actually a transgendered man.      There was recently a case of a scottish woman / transexual,  who was found guilty of obtaining sex by fraud.   Same kind of thing.   So believe what you will,  I know what the law says."

Stefan interjects a little bit with his own views on why Che was the way he was, but most of it is highlights on things like how he routinely raped his parent's hired maids, murdered entire towns of children and women, and completely invented his legacy as a supposed guerrilla leader."

New York Times column reports that women professors are rated consistently lower than male professors, based on a study of 14 million reviews on RateMyProfessors.com   Doesn't prove anything, although the follow up point does make it worth looking into (albiet they failed to link the study, sample size/procedure/etc?)    I Have the Privilege of Peeing Standing Up   I'm not sure what the point he's trying to make here is. We should let women piss in public? We should expand female bathrooms to reduce wait times?   In conjuncture with his later point on privilege of not being harassed or assaulted (which is BS and largely dependent on size and class probably) I'm shocked he didn't mention the privileges of being stronger, being smarter, etc. Of course both of those are ridiculous as they imply all men are stronger or smarter than women, which is obviously not even remotely the case.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_intelligence   I Have the Privilege to Show Skin   Fair enough I guess, considering how pecs are actually also sexually appealing. Some places (NY I think?) allow women to be topless though. At any rate, I could get behind allowing topless women, might help spike motivation in the hearts of many men to go for early morning jogs :3  The assault/rape thing is legit. However:  As a fairly small dude, I've been harassed (albiet not sexually) various times, many of the guys I know have been beaten, or physically assaulted in a bar or on the streets.   ""32% of men don't even know what rape is""  Probably tricked by the drugs + alcohol facilitated sex question, which I would presume was broadly exaggerated by women and completely ignored by drunken men who woke up with someone they wouldn't want to sleep with. That said, rape is a serious problem and doesn't really belong on the list with the other silly things.

sjwhate,34mvmh,DoubleGSpot,11,Sat May 2 22:35:23 2015 UTC,"God damn.  10/10   So what would trigger blacks to see ""diversity"" as a problem - like I did despite my own ""diversity""? To blacks being racist this way makes life easier for them: to enter a better university, for their political opinion to get extra weight, to get more representation in media, to get the job someone else deserves. We are all selfish - they will not give up racism until they see it as a selfish act.   I'd like to compound on this. This whole notion of being 'multicultural' through forced diversity is a farce. What happens when you subject 2 cultures to live together? They will clash until one prevails at the expense of the other. It's historically evident. The whole idea of becoming multicultural is bullshit as it always ends up eliminating cultures through idealogical friction and forced diversity laws. You see this today with the mass immigration into European nations and the population of their cities becoming majority muslim. You see it with the diversity quotas in American academia with Asians and Caucasians getting shafted for the African American or the Latino, even though they performed better. I'm not trying to throw shade at the African American or Latino communities, I'm just saying multiculturalism is one of the biggest shams the world has ever faced.   I'd like to see someone try to force a country like China or Japan or Russia to become 'more diverse'.  You want multiculturalism for the earth? You want diversity? Let each country be their own else it'll all just become some amorphous blob that offers none except one. And if you don't accept that one, you're a racist bigot."

If they truly cared about their other pet projects (gays and women's rights), why are they coddling Islam? Congrats on your wake up call.  To destroy an enemy,the first goal is to divide and conquer. White countries have been divided now based on sex, sexual orientation, political orientation, race (thru immigration), religion,etc.  This division goal has roots in the communist movement."
sjwhate,34mvmh,SS_Cap_Arkona,0,Sat May 9 20:39:41 2015 UTC,"Whites are several degrees more tolerant than other races. Whites are the only people losing power and even numbers in their own countries. Asians are a bit more homophobic. Blacks are way more homophobic. Arabs are the most homophobic. This overlaps with percentage of Muslims by race. When SJWs started defending Muslims I was in shock. Islam is essentially an Arab-themed hybrid between Hitler's Nazism and Medieval Christianity with a twist of organized deception. It is supremacism meets inquisition meets theocratic lawyers. It is pinnacle of hate and bigotry. It is... undefendable - except by meaningless generic arguments like ""diversity"".    10/10 would read again   ""Diversity"" is a flexible word that could sensibly include murderers, cannibals and necrophiliacs but luckily doesn't.
