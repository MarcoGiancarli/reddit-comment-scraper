neuro,3e4kc3,mmroch,12,Tue Jul 21 22:19:31 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, you will always see these types of gloomy posts from people in grad school in any scientific area, and not just in neuroscience. I'm a chemist and when I was seeking information on graduate schools online (and currently), I saw many gloomy posts about being a research chemist and how graduate school is unbearable. The truth is that a lot people go to graduate school as a way to boost their salary for their careers, but unfortunately you cannot pursue a scientific career for the money, it has to be an absolute passion due to the low amount of pay and the amount of work you put into it.     While I am not saying that graduate school in science is a breeze, the people who had a bad time during their PhD and afterward tend to be much more vocal on the internet about the negatives, while people with successful careers tend not to speak up. I suggest that you talk to real neuroscience researchers when you get to college to get a more accurate feel of how graduate school really is. Most importantly, you need to volunteer as an undergraduate researcher to see how scientific research is conducted firsthand, so you can make an informed decision before you are discouraged in any way. I personally find that scientific research is very fulfilling, and you may feel the same way once you get some hands-on experience."
neuro,3e4kc3,tstu,4,Wed Jul 22 00:51:03 2015 UTC,"I am a PhD student at a major biomedical research facility in the US. I have a lot of flexibility in my work: I set my own hours, I work as much or as little as I want (within reason), and honestly, I have a fair amount of spare time. I got married last year, and though my wife does complain every so often about how much I work, it's very much seasonal. Sometimes I'll work a lot, but other times I'll just have a 9-5 job (or 8.30 to 5.30, but whatever). I've got lots of time for hobbies - I recently started brewing my own beer, I bake stuff, I lift weights three/four times a week and I run once a week. My wife and I make proper food for dinner 7 times a week, and we regularly watch TV shows, movies and just spend time together. That being said, yeah, work can be stressful. I know a lot of people will work 60 hours a week. Fuck that shit. My approach to this is ""in before 9 am, out after 5 pm"". That's a minimum of 40 hours. Usually it's more like 45-50, but that's the amount of time I'm willing to invest in this PhD. So far this investment of time has proven to be more than ample. I can only assume that some PIs work their graduate students very hard and that this is where the horror stories come from. All I can say is that this hasn't been my experience and it doesn't happen in any of the labs I've been in.       As for the science itself - science just isn't always glamorous. Sometimes you have to do monotonous soul-sucking work. Every field seems to have some aspect that is very repetitive. In my field, it's identifying neuronal spike waveforms (so-called spike sorting). It's laborious and repetitive, but absolutely crucial to having good data, so we deal with it. For me, I spend the rest of the time doing more interesting stuff so I'm happy with it."

If you love what you do -- and I mean REALLY love it -- you'll probably be okay, find it really fulfilling, and get a tenure-track position at a good school after a PhD. and fellowship. Anything less than LOVING it and you may end up regretting it.   Industry doesn't have as much to offer in terms of $$$ jobs if you burn our in academia, so that's part of the problem (though that may be changing). Anyway, I've seen people do super well and end up highly regarded professors. I've also seen folks flame out and leave the field.

One of my mentors (who loved her field) described it as a kind of addiction. You would do bench work for 6, 7, 8 months maybe a year constantly facing failing experiments, troubleshooting, failing again, not finding what you were expecting, doing the experiments again to verify, etc. But then after all that dedication, hard work and sacrifice you are rewarded with a novel discovery. It's almost always not a groundbreaking discovery but it's yours. Maybe it's a visualizing neural circuitry of the developing brain at a level of detail no one has seen before, maybe it's finding indisputable evidence that the gene, sonic hedgehog (yeah it's a real gene, look it up!) is crucial for hair cell differentiation in the inner ear. Whatever it is, when you look at that novel data for the first time you get a sort of educational high. Those who succeed at basic research are sustained by these ""educational highs"" such that they can deal with the constant failure, bureaucracy, politics, and begging for funding that is modern day research.  So OP I'd say if you think this is the kind of person you are then go for it! Apply to a research heavy undergraduate university, get involved with basic research on campus and find your path!"

The brain is fascinating, and I've loved every neuroscience class I've taken, but I'm still hesitant of graduate school fresh out of undergrad.  But everyone else is right. If you're truly passionate about what you're learning, it will always be worth it.  And most importantly, you CANNOT go through your first two years of undergraduate study thinking you have any idea what you will be doing post-grad.  MANY of my friends got pigeonholed into programs that make them miserable because they went into undergrad thinking that their senior-year self would still be super passionate about the field they chose in highschool.  Take your psych and bio prerequisites so you can get into the awesome neuroscience classes. But also take whatever classes interest you. I entered neuroscience through the cognitive-psych side, and let me tell you now, bio classes will be miserable. But they're worth it. But outside of the program, some of my favorite classes where I learned valuable life lessons were classes like creative writing and film studies.  Hell, I could inbox you a novel on do's and dont's when picking classes and programs. (Seriously, let me know if you want it. I'd love to help. I'm pretty damn good at getting internships as well.)

neuro,3e4kc3,TrIQy,2,Wed Jul 22 08:14:45 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind is that the neuroscience that you come to know as an undergraduate is completely different from that of the academic world. What is initially a collection of ""whoah, that's awesome!"" facts and theories will become a confusing mishmash of conflicting evidence and poorly written academic papers. This isn't to say that scouring the literature isn't fun, it has its upsides, but in graduate school there is no more ""truth"" when it comes to understanding the brain...everything is called into question to an incredible level. This is a big shock to some people who just loved learning about the brain, as being a member of the community who studies the brain is very different.  Another important thing to point out is the difference between being a science enthusiast and being a scientist. If you go into graduate school, I can guarantee you that 90% of your time will be spent troubleshooting. Whether it be cellular biology, computational work, behavioral work, it almost all comes down to ""tried XXX, which either didn't work or wasn't conclusive, so why was that?"" Now, this can be fun too, but remember that this process often repeats itself for many many months. Then, when you finally think you have a result that's worth telling the world about, you have to submit it to a journal which may take months to even years before the article is finally submitted.  There a lot more to say, but as others have mentioned, the most important thing is that you gain experience in what it's really like to conduct your own research, to work every day for months on a single project, and to have full responsibility over whether that project succeeds or not. That'll only be a taste of what it's like to be in graduate school but I think it should be required before you decide to go for it."

That is taking a very positive look at the situation, but it is possible. You will most likely still have that innate craving for dopamine rushes deep down in the more protected regions of the brain i.e. substantia nigra and really the entire basal ganglia system. But we are assuming in this scenario your hippocampus wont have the links to cigarrettes and contexts of cigarrette smoking created via associations in the cortex.  The additional handicaps of increased emotional irritability (stemming from overrepresentation of the limbic system in proportion to cortical system damage) can make these sorts of changes difficult, however.

She had smoked her whole life, but had no real memory of it nor any desire for them. Her husband and son were smokers, though, so she only lasted about a year before she started smoking again.  tl;dr anecdotal evidence says it can be done, but all the predisposition is still there (and memories will ""come back"" or reconnect) , so it's extremely easy to get hooked again."

Otherwise, the amnesia from an accident or something like that would probably be temporary and would involve the loss of short-term rather than long-term memory.  As long-term memory would almost certainly involve smoking, yes, they would still be addicted.  Their brains would still be addicted to nicotine, if that's the question.  As such, they would still experience cravings and physical withdrawals even if they were hypothetically to forget what it is they were addicted to, but it wouldn't necessarily be hard for them to put two and two together unless they suffered more serious brain damage as a result of the accident.  Either way, coming out of something involving brain injury like amnesia is rarely so clean-cut as ""I forgot but there's been no other damage.""  Temporary amnesia or spots of memory loss (blackouts, even from things other than alcohol) are actually relatively common but those are usually issues of storing memories rather than retrieving them.  Being unable to retrieve memories at all is usually more serious and involves more extensive damage.  But the short answer is yes."

He suggests instead to find the pertinent rules that governs a behavior and to implement them into an algorithm. He gives examples where systems governed by a few simple rules can give rise to very complex behavior, such as the traveling salesman problem done by ant colony optimization. Marr's three levels of analysis comes to mind.  Computational theory: What is the goal of the computation, why is it appropriate, and what is the logic of the strategy by which it can be carried out?  Representation and algorithm: How can this computational theory be implemented? In particular, what is the representation for the input and output, and what is the algorithm for the transformation?

With that research philosophy, cognitive psychologist have wasted (and are wasting) decades trying to understand the mind without caring a single bit about the brain. With respect to the brain, Marr was clearly wrong. The brain is not a computer in the sense that there is software than 'runs' on hardware.

Marr asked how the systems in the brain (ie the network of neurons and its functional properties) can give rise to its computational properties (ie implicit learning, object recognition). This has nothing to do with a distinction between software and hardware and his analysis very much involves the functions of the brain. For example, he came up with a groundbreaking theory with the cerebellar cortex with that analysis in 1969. In the third step of his analysis, he asks how can the algorithm be fleshed out in the cerebellum and explains it with regards to its wiring and it's synaptic properties.     His three levels of analysis is continued to be used to develop working algorithms for the visual system of the brain that is used in computer vision."

I'd bet that the dissociation, in part, is accompanied by a blood flow issue to your prefrontal cortex and eyes.  Try this exercise, which mimics the result I get from Hemoencephelographic (HEG) nerofeedback that trains blood flow to the prefrontal cortex.   Pick up a pencil with writing on the side of it, or otherwise pick out a word on the screen that is as far away from you as possible while still being able to sharply make out the lettering. Either hold the pencil at arms length, or stare at the lettering on the screen.  Pick out a letter that has a clear line that you can focus on. Focus on the tip of the line, and try to see and bring into focus the smallest part of the tip of the line. On the screen, you are trying to see one pixel, in very sharp focus, with both eyes at a distance. The idea is to keep as sharp a focus of that single small point at a distance, with both eyes, as you can for as long as you can hold it. If you lose the focus, regain it until you get tired of the exercise.   This focusing on a small point at a distance is the technique I use to be successful in HEG neurofeedback, and it works outside of the neurofeedback session with the technique that I above described. It should train more bloodflow to your prefrontal cortex and at least protect against some of your reaction.  Take antinflammatories as necessary. They will help keep the bloodflow open. I take Excedrin often. Nothing else is as good for relieving inflammation in the forebrain. Sunlight helps to a degree, and going to be early to assure proper brain restoration during sleep is crucial. Between 9pm and 11pm should be your window.  You'll probably also have issues with fluorescent lighting, if not now then later. My same recommendations apply."
neuro,3duqwx,golgi1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:32:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with this poster's suggestion to spend some time focusing your eyes at a long distance, as a way to take a break from focusing on a close screen.  However, I have to say that basing this idea on ""training bllod flow to your prefrontal cortex"" makes little sense to me. Prefrontal cortex is a rather large region of the brain, with many sub-regions, involved in all kinds of functions (decision making, reasoning, introspection). I don't know of any reason why this kind of training should specifically affect PFC in a beneficial way.  That all being said, taking a break to focus your eyes at a great distance may in fact be helpful for you. Focusing your eyes at a nearby screen for long periods of time can strain your eyes and cause headaches.  I would recommend you speak with a neurologist if you're worried about this, rather than starting any kind of medication.   As others have suggested, you may just need a break.

neuro,3duqwx,michaelhyphenpaul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:08:01 2015 UTC,"Kill your tv mate. You have changed your brain, but it can be ""rewired"" back to normal.  Habit is grossly underestimated today. You have put yourself into certain habits - these definitively change neuroanatomy and physiology. It seems that you are experiencing the pace of life differently, and that sensoral stimulation doesn't have the same 'oomph' it used to. This is because certain set points (kind of like on a thermostat) in your brain have been changed resulting in different inputs eliciting different outputs. There has almost certainly been a 'rewiring' as well: certain behaviours cascade into others almost automatically (just think of picking up one's smartphone).  And it sounds like these are not the behaviours you want yourself to be engaged in (which I agree would be healthier if modified).  That is the neural side. The other side is the existential, metaphysical, or philosophical. You have entered what Jean Baudrillard referred to as the Simulacrum. Its where the original reality of a thing has been eclipsed by the reality of its simulation/reproduction. The virtual has overtaken the real, both for you (and often me) and for millions across the globe. What you are experiencing on this level is just as real as the neural, but not going to be something you can fix with a pill or surgery (neither of which I think are even close to appropriate in this instance).  You have to change your habits, which has an existential as well as material side, which is why I mention it at all.   You have to get away from screens more: try reading. Try interacting with people in real life more often than virtually: set a goal, such as talking to people for less time via electronic mediums than you see them per week.   These sort of pragmatics are the best way to get you back to reality. You are responsible for this ""rewiring."" You are young, and beyond this, the human brain is extremely plastic. [Less plastic than we like to think, but definitely changeable throughout its entire lifespan.]  You will be just fine: just take charge and get some air. Take up some new hobbies (read: habits). They'll do the electrical work for you."

(This explanation isn't meant to diminish or invalidate the stress that accompanies the things you're experiencing).   Boredom can definitely affect the brain via shrinking the pleasure centers through under-stimulation, leading to feelings of lethargy, emotional numbing, etc., etc. These phenomenon are the reason moms everywhere enroll their kids in camp and other activities to get them the hell out of the house during the summer.

I was in a similar situation recently, within the past 4 or so years. When I was a teenager (now 23) I tried all the drugs (the ones you have listed and more..)  and sometimes in combination. I am now in medical school, with a degree in biochemistry, partly because I had such a strong interest in drugs.  The best advice I can give you is to treat drugs as LEARNING experiences and not recreation. Try to expand your perception and then move along taking with you what you have learned while under a different state of consciousness. Doing coke or lsd a few times is not going to make you a dunce, but if you feel yourself falling towards addiction of any substance, seek help through social or medical support.   If you have any questions, please message me. I am almost an MD, so I can try my best to help you out."

For many people cannabis reduces anxiety and brightens mood, if you are using cannabis to deal with emotional problems, that could make it difficult to stop using cannabis. Cannabis of course can also alter your thinking and ""cloud your mind"". Try stopping with cannabis for a few months and definitely go to your college mental health clinic (it may not be in your best interest to mention your drug use history). At 19 you are facing lots of new stress, and your brain's anxiety system is slowly waking up, this is the age that people start noticing psychiatric problems.

neuro,3dt6wv,ZuchinniOne,2,Sun Jul 19 11:41:08 2015 UTC,"Neuroscientist here.  I saw your reasoning for getting an fMRI.  The fMRI won't show anything. First of all they need to be comparative, secondly fMRI data is best when used for experimental studies with as many participants as possible.  A structural MRI however may reveal any brain damage if it exists, but the type of damage associated with drug use is not normally visible.  Honestly the MRI is a waste of money.  In regards to the drug use ... your brain is still developing at the age when you started to do drugs and it is possible that there will be some permanent changes compared to if you never did anything.  However you are still young and your brain will continue developing somewhat until about 25.  Honestly the small main things I'd be concerned with are:  1) How much pot have you smoked exactly ... a little bit and your probably fine ... but if you're smoking multiple times a day that will almost certainly have had a major effect.  2) Stay away from shit like Spice and other ""Legal"" highs ... those are often the most dangerous."

Cannabis alone is probably responsible for your unclear thinking. THC counteracts acetylcholine, which is the major neurotransmitter associated with memory. You can easily fix this by supplementing CDP choline. When I started taking CDP choline (and piracetam) after a while using cannabis, I found that my mood, memory, and motivation were improved to an astonishing degree.  Cannabis has also been shown to cause structural changes in the adolescent brain, namely shrinking the hippocampus and enlarging the amygdala. If you have been using significant amounts of cannabis on a daily basis for five years, then you will probably have some permanent changes in your brain. Quitting cannabis is the most sensible way to get back to normal. If that's not possible, then regular cardio exercise, meditation, and a good diet will help you function at your best. I would also check out /r/nootropics for more supplement recommendations."

Below, I am copying a post I wrote on why I think 10 uses of cocaine won't have caused lasting damage:  I am basing my claim of there being no damage on three pieces of evidence. First, there is solid evidence showing that cocaine is not neurotoxic - link. While cocaine is known to cause dopamine receptor downregulation, this effect is only temporary - it goes away after one month - link.  There is also this study which showed an increase in the dendritic spines of dopamine neurons following 7 weeks of high-dose IV cocaine. To get this same effect in a human, OP would have had to binge on cocaine daily for several years. That's why I think 10 uses is a write-off. Not even to mention the millions of people (including at least two former presidents) who have used cocaine a handful of times with no noticeable lasting consequences.  In the book The Compass of Pleasure, the author (a neurologist) makes the case that dendritic spines on dopamine neurons in the nucleus accumbens are the major cause of irreversible addiction and tolerance.

Yes, maybe my speed of thinking has decreased by like .005 percent and the extent of vocabulary as well, but I felt so clean and ready to do the best that I could do. Weed is good in moderation, which I started up again in college. Psychedelics are good 3/4 times a year... They can really help you figure your shit out.

Imho your brain will never be the same again ofc it won't (don't panic though!), let's not be naive... But you have to remember that the brain is a muscle with more neurons than there are atoms in the universe. The more you use it, the stronger it becomes... If you use it to think about how mental you're becoming well... Those neurons will get stronger.... Ever heard of a self fulfilling prophecy? , but I digress! I don't want to dismiss the issue.   If you truly believe that an fmri test will benefit you some way, or, more probably, if it's for closure, then go for it.  Speaking from experience, I personally had a cat scan a few months ago and it came back completely clean (yay?). So (hopefully) I'm just foreshadowing your inevitable result.  Anyway, I was very much like you I thought my brain would never be the same again, and I panicked for a long while and threw myself into depression and paranoia, not to mention alienating myself and becoming a hypochondriac.   I ""quit"" the drugs, the aversions, and the toxic people in my life (I mostly have its very difficult I know...) and started studying hard for a degree in comp sci.  Man oh man the first few weeks were painful. You see when you do drugs for a long time you become dumber. Your brain builds up barriers. And then studying seems to take a lot more effort than it once would have.   It was a fucking nightmare, it was like my brain was defunct (brain fog ik), short term memory was fucked.   Note: Now, at this point I was retarded. Nothing made any sense. The information that would have once been so friggin obvious was now gibberish. I felt dumber and lower than I had at any other point in my life. But I didn't give up... How could I? It was either that or accept that I was dumber for the rest of my life, and fuck that!   I tortured myself learning how to code, contemplated suicide many times, hated everyone around me, hated myself but after nearly two weeks of 9-5 -head into a brick wall- no progress, it started to make sense. The pieces started to fit again. I no longer felt like an idiot.. I was happy again. And I've been happy ever since. Everything else started to improve after that happened as well. Those two weeks and the years before I had really started to doubt my abilities.   So you can either accept the fact that you are dumber or do something about it.   Your brains capacity for learning is never really inhibited, the only thing that can really inhibit you is FEAR.   If you are afraid the fear will grow inside you like an illness, don't let that happen. I wasted nearly three years of my life (maybe they weren't a waste, who knows? Sure felt like it.. Maybe it was a phase, fuck if I know) going round and round being afraid I was just a little bit dumber... But you know what? THAT was dumb. Dumber than all those thoughts I had.  You have to learn to let go of the drugs, stop thinking about them and the effects they had on you. Talk about it with someone who cares about you and let it go.  The drugs don't work. They never did. But hey we'll take 'em anyway because we're only human.   Here's another key point, the older you get, the dumber people will treat you because at this point (19) no one cares. The sad truth is 95% of people seem to become morons after they leave school. It is and has always been like that.   Tl; dr Do something proactive, challenge your capabilities if you truly want to be smarter."

How does a single neuron store even a fragment of a memory?  Surely memories cannot be translated into an inner experience merely due to action potentials of individual neurons.

After getting an adult job and having a regular 8-5 schedule, I've been able to normalize my sleep and I feel like I am operating at 95% or better again after a few years of maintaining a legit schedule. There was a period of a few years where I couldn't remember past conversations, what I did the day before or would forget something as engrained as my birthday. I know what you're talking about because I was going to go to medical school until I made the connection that I need a certain amount of sleep each night and that would not happen in residency and I'd likely kill someone and not be allowed to practice after.   Try to get into a normal sleep pattern, going to bed every night and waking up at roughly the same time (within an hour). Be sure you get at least 7.5 hours (that's my minimum sleep number before I start to get grouchy and I can notice a neurological decline) and if your bed sucks, get something that'll ensure you're asleep most of that time.

It was definitely gradual but there was also definitely a threshold I crossed and knew I had changed within a few month period. It wasn't like I woke up one day and said ""ah hah, I am good again"" but the number of mornings where I woke up, felt good to go and remembered the trivial things like what I ate for lunch and dinner the day before started to increase. That's when I knew it was working. It was rapid after I started to observe progress. I also started noticing my weekend naps decreased and now I don't nap anymore.

Basic rules of sleep hygiene apply: Get exercise during the day, stay away from caffeine after 11 AM, and go to bed the same time every night, even on the weekends. Consider adding f.lux to your laptop if you're using that in the evenings, because you also want to avoid bright light in the evenings. Don't use a blue or green nightlight.   You'll see real changes pretty quickly, and you can expect to continue to improve more slowly for months. If you find that you still can't sleep through the night after making these changes, get a sleep study done- I had memory issues all through high school and it was my undiagnosed sleep disorder at work. But try these basic changes first!"

neuro,3d1ie8,Alacritous,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:41:48 2015 UTC,"Melatonin right when you lie down to sleep, blue blocking sunglasses, stretches - particularly ""rolling like an egg"" and tensing/untensing all muscles systematically. Melanopsin is the primary protein that sends input to the suprachiasmatic nucleus that regulates circadian rhythms, and it is particularly sensitive to blue light such as that which comes out of screens. Since it is bistable rather than unistable like the other opsins it signals tonically rather than fires and goes extinct. In essence you are shouting to your brain ""IT IS DAY NOW"" when you look at a screen. Stimulating and relaxing muscles and therefore spinal nerves also disrupts the patterning of the hindbrain reticular formation that more generally contributes to arousal. Melatonin is the hormone secreted by the pineal gland when the SCN signals night, and although it is debatable whether or not it is bioactive when  taken orally can replace the naturally produced Melatonin that is missing in dysregulated sleep.   Glad to see other people have already answered with an emphatic ""yes"" that there are cognitive consequences to chronic lack of sleep. One thing that I'll add is that during sleep you clear away plaques called Amyloids, particularly amyloid beta that are naturally produced. They can inhibit synaptic plasticity and are neurotoxic in high quantities so definitely get back into regular and sustained sleep as soon and as often as you can"

Preferably learn how a research group works, so you can build one after you graduate. Learn how to get grants and other financial support.   If you want to go into industry, then the list differs from the above as follows:   Your niche should be more immediately applicable to industry. Grants won't matter directly, but learning to write grant-like proposals may be useful to sell your ideas to management. You won't be building the same type of research group in industry, but learning to working collaboratively on a team will be crucial. You should preferably prepare to manage other people's work.  Not necessarily as a manager, but in industry you will have support staff (sysops, junior programmers, etc) that you will need to be able to use effectively.

neuro,3cxini,ennervated_scientist,6,Sat Jul 11 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"Much of what you're describing can be found in an introductory biochemistry text especially the chapters regarding enzyme kinetics and any subsections regarding binding affinities and the like. Almost any will do but I've heard Legninger's Principles of Biochemistry is quite good although I've never used it.  Basics: Agonists activate a receptor, antagonists attach but do not activate receptors, inverse agonists bind to reduce constitutive activity, inverse antagonists bind to preserve constitutive activity (as BPA does to ERRγ). The strength of a chemical is measured as a function of its binding affinity (measured in enzymology as KD and in pharmacology circles as IC50/EC50). Very strong chemicals and especially those produced endogenously (naturally in the body) frequently have nanomolar efficacy as measured by a constant known as IC50 or EC50 (former refers to antagonists and the latter for agonists). This is the measure of what concentration of ligand (possibly a transmitter) is required to keep 50% of all targets (possibly a receptor) in the bound conformation.   Hopefully from this you can pick out some key words to search in google or YouTube to learn the basics of kinetics. Enzyme kinetics is complex and you'll need some understand of organic chemistry as well as biochemistry to be able understand how chemicals bind to a receptor and how changes in receptor conformation can change its activity.   As far as what happens after a chemical binds to a receptor, that is the domain of intracellular signaling and can be found in any Cellular Biology text book but I would highly recommend Cell and Molecular Biology by Karp. The study of this is highly complex since there are multiple semi-independent signaling systems in every cell and each serves different roles not just within the single cell but between different types of cells. To know more about oxytocin signaling in particular you would search ""oxytocin signal transduction"". Most every signaling pathway follows a typical scheme: receptor activation -> secondary messenger activation -> transcription factor activation -> transcription and translation of new protein (possibly oxytocin). Of course this is a gross oversimplification but you get the idea.  For neuroscientifically relevant hormones and neurotransmitters you may want to consult Principles of Neural Science by Kandel et al. which gives an introductory overview of almost all of neuroscience including the many neurotransmitters and relevant hormones."

In short, there are thousands of connections that exist between the hippocampus and other brain structures. For example, some memory information may be processed simultaneously in the amygdala when experiencing a frightening situation.   2). There do exist gap junctions within which neurotransmitters are released and uptaken. These neural pathways have been formed since birth, but have been pruned and changed. That said, there too exists cell death which quite literally reorganizes how memories are stored. To answer your question, neural connections are refined on a constant basis so thinking of it as a long-term change is slightly misguided. Furthermore, other variables such as birth derived neurofactors (BDNF, alterations to mRNA/genes, and the presence of certain proteins have been demonstrated to be fundamental to the process of neurogenesis. Check this out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotrophin"
neuro,3cxwlt,ACFade,4,Sat Jul 11 20:54:02 2015 UTC,"I believe you mean synapses...gap junctions are ion channels connecting apposing neurons and allow synchronization of electrical activity without neurotransmitter release. As for OPs second question, while the neurons might have long axons providing paths between various other brain regions, synapses themselves are constantly in flux. Forming, disconnecting, potentiating, depressing. This is how memories can be formed so quickly. Not by growing whole new neurons and connecting two regions, but by finalizing and then tuning the last link in the chain of a network that is already layed down in development and which is constantly maintained and refreshed throughout life."
neuro,3cxwlt,blumsy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:47:26 2015 UTC,"Awesome. So basically, if I learn some new fact during my day, it means that the last link (or maybe a few links) in the chain was finalized?  I think also I remember from my psychology class ten years ago something about chemicals facilitating temporary neural pathway creation for short-term memory; does that ring a bell?"
neuro,3cxwlt,blumsy,2,Sun Jul 12 06:11:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are part of a class of molecules called neurotrophic factors. Some support cell proliferation and maintenance, some support synaptogenesis, I.e. synapse formation. There are also many other classes of molecules involved. Like cell adhesion molecules and axon guidance cues."
neuro,3cxwlt,blumsy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:17:21 2015 UTC,"Just to be totally sure: When you say ""they"" are part of a class of molecules called neurotrophic factors, by ""they"" you're referring to the  ""chemicals facilitating temporary neural pathway creation for short-term memory"" I mentioned in my second question above, correct?"

neuro,3cxwlt,occamsphasor,2,Sun Jul 12 20:16:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, but when you learn something during the day, that memory is most likely being stored in the hippocampus, as strengthened connections between the neurons that ""represent"" those things associated with one another in that memory. The hippocampus then will replay those strengthened neurons (which is thought to largely occur during sleep). Because the hippocampal neuron has strong connections to the cortical neuron representing the same sort of thing, this means that as this replay occurs, the cortical neurons representing these associated concepts from this memory are also firing simultaneously, and therefore the connections between these cortical neurons are also strengthened. This (or something like this) is how long term memory can happen independently of the hippocampus. And like others in the thread have mentioned, these synaptic strengthening processes can happen quite quickly."

neuro,3cohn9,ViciousCycle,4,Thu Jul 9 14:49:34 2015 UTC,"Why do you say that? Specifically the ""presently is undervalued"" part?  Why would you not want to go to a PI who you know has personal relationships with editors at Science, Nature, Cell and other top-tier journals?  I just finished my PhD with a guy who has been chair of a top-5 NIH funded neuroscience department for ~20 years, and started my postdoc who is the chair of another enormous department (albeit pharmacology), but just stepped into his first chair position about 18 months ago. The contrast is insane. I haven't been here long enough to say which one is better, but I honestly can't imagine receiving better graduate training than I did from the old, very well established guy."
neuro,3cohn9,gocougs11,3,Thu Jul 9 20:53:35 2015 UTC,"Well established doesn't mean not undervalued.    All else being equal, someone ""undervalued"" will have their fingers in fewer pies, and have more time for mentoring.  That's why it's desirable.    edit another benefit if your PI is undervalued is less competition from other students to get a spot in that lab."

Yes, some people will say you should start your own entirely new project, but really a phd is challenging enough without doing that.  Even successful PIs tend to have a limited number of good ideas that work out.  In an already super successful lab the staff will often be large and your likelihood of working in the ""good"" project is often lesser"

neuro,3cohn9,Cornu-Ammonis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:42:58 2015 UTC,"I find using the term PI for a PhD supervisor a little confusing and not quite correct. In general a PI is someone you'd work for on a project (think postdoc position), whereas for your PhD you should really be aiming to be doing your OWN work with guidance - hence why they are called supervisors or mentors. If you're putting your supervisor as lead author on anything you publish from your PhD research then you're doing something very wrong."
neuro,3cohn9,Cornu-Ammonis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:06:31 2015 UTC,"Ok I see where that confusion might be comming from. But isn't the PI usually how you call the person who runs a lab (who also typically mentors PhD students)? Therefore it would encompass all kind of work relationships (phd, postdoc, senior positions) where the PI is at the top of the hierarchy. Just to clarify when I said senior author I meant the last name on the paper, whereas you seem to think I referred to the first name (lead author). I agree that being anything but first/lead author in the papers that result from the PhD research would seem wrong in most if not all cases."
neuro,3cohn9,psychguy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:56:53 2015 UTC,"I get your point, but I think it depends on how you're funded. Being the PI of a large grant which funds most of the lab's research is different from you getting external or university funding in which you technically have no PI. For example, I have two supervisors from different labs who share me equally and I'm funded by someone else. At the end of the day it's just semantics and probably not relevant to the OP."
neuro,3cohn9,missdopamine,3,Fri Jul 10 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"I would agree with ViciousCycle that your PI is the number one priority if you are determined to end up in an academic research position. The personality of your PI matters as much as their research productivity. My first PI was a true leader in the field, mid-career, with a tremendous publication record. However, she was impossible to get along with and I later (many years after dropping out of her program) found out that in her years of academia not a single one of her students actually graduated. With fame comes vanity.  I am a clinical neuropsychologist, so there are career options for me that do not involve research (although I am active in research). My second grad school was a much better experience, but I chose it specifically because it was close to family. I got so burned out from my first experience that I went the exact opposite direction. Mid career, I am modestly successful, the director of a small private college graduate program in psychology with about 10 publications. I do not have the grant or publication record or school prestige that would make me competitive for a position at a major research university, but I am reasonably satisfied with being a moderately big fish in a small pond."

I am really surprised that any PI wouldn't start questioning him-/herself at least as soon as the second student doesn't finish the program. I mean it should also be in the PI's interest to have somebody to make them (more) famous and ideally collaborate with after graduation... Did she have kids? I sometimes wonder if that makes a difference both in male and female PIs...
neuro,3cohn9,YoohooCthulhu,2,Thu Jul 9 19:04:26 2015 UTC,"No kids. She also has hopped schools a few times (4 schools total in 36 years of teaching) as she gets more and more lucrative offers. She brings in tons of money and always had grad students around to do the work. She is one of the most widely cited figures in psychology today, so she really does not need students to make her more famous than she is. By now I would assume that she has had some graduate, of course. When I was her RA she had been faculty for 12 years, and that was 24 years ago."
neuro,3cohn9,ILikeNeurons,4,Thu Jul 9 19:34:03 2015 UTC,"If you're undecided on what to study, perhaps the best thing to do is to find a graduate program that requires rotations, and find a mentor that's good at mentoring (avoid the figureheads, they are good for postdocs).   Most U.S. programs in neuroscience do not include an MA, to my knowledge. It wouldn't be useful anyway.   School prestige doesn't actually matter that much at the graduate level, especially if you're staying in academia. Far and away the most important factor is your mentor, and your relationship with him/her. Next up is probably the lab environment. Just pick a topic that can keep you interested for a few years and you'll be fine."

Non research employers tend to use the prestige of your graduate institution the way other employers use undergrad institution prestige--as a filtering mechanism.  The dirty secret of all areas of science these days is that shit's competitive and your research just may not work out well enough to get the high profile publications needed for a professor position.

neuro,3cohn9,GuyNBlack,3,Thu Jul 9 20:58:28 2015 UTC,"More agreement on the PI. Especially in cognitive neuroscience there are so many fakes and narcissists that will happily screw your career by only using you up as slave labor. Slightly older might be better than someone still working their way up their own glory mountain. It's very difficult to get an honest assessment though, given that almost nobody will risk badmouthing a Boss type to someone they don't really know.  Topic is, unfortunately IMO, important I think. Learning multiple methods is always a great strategy but there's higher-level stuff going on that's somewhat topic-specific, like really in-depth literature knowledge including knowing who's who, and networking, and building up expertise. The more math-y or neuro-y kind of work you do the more you'll be able to switch and do your cool stuff on whatever data sets, but remember you'll probably be competing for (far preferably) grants or post-docs for something specific, not generalist.   I'm terrible at it because I also just like just about everything but I think you do need to learn how to give elevator pitches and have a nice story ready that will impress any pillocks you need to impress.  Qua institute, given a decent PI, go for max prestige. Again, even if you don't care, you may need to impress pillocks. And networking is important. I've gotten a job partly for where I came from being impressive to the ignorant.  My impression from friends is that the US system is a lot nicer and more about you being a student rather than a workhorse, but I have no real personal info on that.   Quality of life is going to depend hugely on the PI. Almost exclusively. If you love doing research and your PI actually supports you in doing that it's all gravy. Almost nobody's problems have anything to do with the actual research. Generally people who make decisions based on having an actual life and not working yourself to death (especially not for the glory of your PI) seem to be the happier types. But if you really have the opportunity to go hardcore and actually profit from it, why not. The burn outs come from working really hard under external pressure and under conditions that preclude getting sufficiently rewarded for the degree of hard work.  So my tips would be, in order of importance, (1) get a good PI, (2 - 10) again: get a good PI, (11) make sure your project is feasible qua logistics, financing, participants, support, in-house expertise, etc, (11b) don't do anything that means you're relying exclusively on clinical participation because that's usually a huge hell, (12) get your good PI at a great institute, (13) do something maths-y and neuro-y that lets you develop scarce and generalizable skills, (14) do something that has a really clear link to social relevance.  I wish I had a good tip on items 1 through 10. All I'd tell myself is: If you have any bad vibes, listen to them and keep on looking."
neuro,3cohn9,YoohooCthulhu,2,Thu Jul 9 19:16:26 2015 UTC,"This makes a good point about the clinical side of things. If you're going to stay in the UK, I'd aim a project at a non-clinical population that could have implications elsewhere, because you don't really want to be spending a whole year waiting around for NHS ethical approval when they are pushing people to have a thesis submitted in three."
neuro,3cohn9,Cornu-Ammonis,3,Fri Jul 10 14:25:02 2015 UTC,All things being said about finding a good PI are true but I would add to that that the next most important thing is developing skills that are transferable and marketable. 80% chance you won't be in academics forever and you have a better chance of staying in academics if you have skills that people see as assets.
neuro,3cohn9,reformed_nice_guy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:06:00 2015 UTC,"Highly likely you won't make it in academIcs.  Professor jobs are not like other job paths where you can just plot a path (anymore).  It's possible to not be able to get a (decent) professor job anywhere, even with a good cv"
neuro,3cohn9,doderlein,3,Fri Jul 10 02:39:20 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound really lame, but at the end of the day your happiness and quality of life are what is going to help you actually finish your PhD, so it's really important that you understand the compromises you're willing to make to achieve a good work-life balance. The biggest contributing factors to your work happiness are going to be a) being interested in your project and b) working with exciting people that aren't total dicks. My personal advice would be to care less about the prestige of the institution and more about your relationships with colleagues. I've been on both sides of supervisor relations (good and bad), and no amount of brilliant program is going to make up for the depression and de-motivation of being in a really bad lab environment.  But to answer your specific questions:   A solid research proposal is necessary to be accepted into a university, but keep in mind that it will likely change A LOT once you start collaborating with your supervisor/lab, so as long as it's feasible and interesting to you I wouldn't stress out too much about this. US Ivy League schools are arguably the most respected institutions, but if you're planning on attending one of them you need to make some serious considerations about the cultural differences between academia in the US and the UK. For one, you'll need to get high marks on the GRE and pay for all your applications to even be considered. You'll also need to attend courses and rotations which can be great for gaining extra skills, but also not so great for your sanity to feel like you're repeating your MSc and then worrying about your PhD all at once. It's INCREDIBLY competitive over there as well, and you'll be expected to spend a lot of time out of hours working. Honestly, I would choose to go to a university in the country you plan on actually living and working in after you finish, because this level is where you'll start building your networks for your career. At the very least, go somewhere that has already established links with wherever it is you want to work. I mainly based my choice of institution on both location and available funding, but I made sure before I applied that there were people working there I actually wanted to work with. I have no regrets."

This is sort of like saying there is a problem with the electrons in a dysfunctional electronic device.  Neurotransmitters are necessary for all brain function, and it may be possible to say that evidence of some types dysfunction can be seen in macro neurotransmitter levels, but as long as you are able to sense and move they are for the most part working as intended.  Generally we know very little about how higher level thinking processes work - instead we point to correlates like relative activation, activation frequencies, blood flow, neurotransmitter levels, etc.  The use of those specific physiological correlates often gives journalists and other lay people the impression that researchers have discovered the causes of certain types of dysfunction, when in reality that type of understanding is very far away."

Because what you are reading about depression is false. There is zero scientific evidence that there is something wrong with dopamine, serotonin, or norepinephrine in a depressed person's brain. There were many theories, but all of them are trash. The truth is no one knows.  One problem is that depression is one word that represents a huge range of feelings and experience. They are just symptoms, and there are likely many different causes. As an example of the complexity, I will contradict what I previously said. Are there cases where depression can be caused by ""neurotransmitter problems""? No doubt, particularly in cases involving the use of legal and illegal drugs. Some drugs can cause depression as a side effect. Those drugs can also cause problems with sex. In these cases, the person is clearly suffering from drug effects, but the generic description of symptoms could be described as depression, particularly if the symptoms are not correctly attributed to drugs (which is all too common)."

neuro,3cfuud,owatonna,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:42:04 2015 UTC,I do not have any to recommend on theory. I do not believe in any of the theories surrounding neurotransmitters. A theory that I believe has credibility is the evolutionary one (depression is an adaptation).
neuro,3cfuud,DickDraper,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:31:11 2015 UTC,Yes it is an adaptation but could person to person neurotransmitter efficacy or sensitivity be variable enough to be selected for when depression is adaptive? Does that make sense. I'm not saying you're wrong but I'm curious as to why not this be the case?
neuro,3cfuud,TheRecovery,3,Wed Jul 8 03:38:25 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out that owatonna is not wrong but (s)he's not exactly right either.   Of course depression is an adaptation. It's the result of a change in some sort of brain chemistry - there is no way this isn't true as your brain only communicates with neurotransmitters so they necessarily have to be involved. Which ones are up for debate, but we can guess that serotonin is involved in some degree (that doesn't mean that it's necessarily a decrease in serotonin that is the issue, as owatonna says).  That being said, despite owatonna's assertion, there is something wrong with some neurotransmitter or electrical signal somewhere. There are also plenty of reasons why anhedonia can come about - both could be the direct result of emotional trauma, physical trauma to the brain, hormonal fluctuations, drug side-effects, or any combination of these things, among others.   All that to say, we know very little about the exact causes of depression and/or anhedonia, current theories may not be right but haven't been proven wrong either. Current theories suspect that anhedonia may have to do with altered levels of dopamine because dopamine tends to be related to our motivation systems. This is a weak link, but not an unreasonable one. It's more likely the case that dopamine is one of the many neurotransmitters actually involved.   Now to answer your question directly. The adaptation we'd see to back up an evolutionary theory would be the cross-order usage, genetic conservation, and similar structure of the receptors thought to be involved in depression. In fact, we see that in the 5HTA1 (serotonin A1) receptor, which is something like 98.5+% similar between mice and humans in structure. This gives some evidence to that receptor in particular being necessary in an evolutionary sense, especially considering that rodents with fewer of these receptors show less depressive episodes when exposed to stressors. Ironically, this would implicate serotonin as an important molecule in depression work. (Which most people are pretty sure it is)"
neuro,3cfuud,Firkarg,3,Wed Jul 8 06:46:44 2015 UTC,"There’s a major confusion going on with regards to how neurotransmitters relate to behaviour even in the scientific community and even more so with the lay person. If we go back to the basics and take dopamine as an example; it is only one of several hundred (more likely thousands) of neurotransmitters in the brain and this particular one is a medium speed acting, longer duration but with fairly low ""power"". What this mean is that in any connection where dopamine is involved there will be a higher chance for an activation of the synapse for some time. If an activation occurs or not is dependent on a lot of other interacting factors and if that in turn propagates further and results in a behaviour is influenced by even more factors. Following from this dopamine has been described as involved in the ""wanting"" system and thus is involved in directing our attention and energy towards something, not necessarily triggering the action. What should follow logically (and this is guessing since sex drive is not my field) is thus that more dopamine will increase the sex drive and might potentiate an orgasm but is not needed since it is more likely that there are plenty of other neurotransmitters that are involved in the actual triggering of an orgasm.   And to follow up on a previous posted comment we don't actually know if we're targeting the root cause of depression, its symptoms or something else. What we know is that some people recover or report higher quality of life after taking anti-depressants."
neuro,3cfuud,roland00,2,Tue Jul 7 19:31:38 2015 UTC,"Your body is still make the right amount of those neurotransmitters generally, but it is not releasing the right amount, or the receptors that listen for those neurotransmitters have the wrong ratios, or the clean up crews of these neurotransmitters (enzymes and reuptake transporters) are either too much or too little.  Or you have other issues such as an autoimmune issue, an endocrine issue (types of hormones) and autoimmune signalers and encrocine signalers also influence neurotransmitters.  In other words it gets real complicated real quick.        Your body has over 50 different types of neurotransmitters.  All the neurotransmitters are important but 6 big ones your body uses is are Glutamate and Gaba, which is like a speed up sign and a slow down/stop sign.  4 other are Serotonin, Norepinephrine, Dopamine, and Acetylcholine.  These are neurotransmitters that are modulators, they turn on specific brain regions and turn off specific brain regions due to changing circumstances.          Well these neurotransmitters are multifaceted, do not think of them as a single amount, like Up, Down, or Medium but instead as a line that can squiggle and change and the curves that line can make is just as important as whether the line is going up or down.  You have at least 14 different types of serotonin receptors, 5 different types of dopamine receptors, 9 types of norepinephrine receptors, and at least 13 different types of acetylcholine receptors in humans.  And receptors can do different things in different brain areas and areas outside the brain with the rest of the nervous system.     Think of these different neurotransmitters as having different instruments in a band or orchestra.  Furthermore the instruments do not have a single string or a single level or key, but instead multiple ones.  For example a guitar has 6 strings, a violin has 4 strings, a piano has over 200, a trumpet has 3 sometimes 4 pistons, percussion can have any numbers of drumps or other instruments etc.  But these instruments can play far more different notes by the combination and interaction of these discrete units.  For example a guitar may have only 6 strings but based off how you strum the chords, and your finger movements with the other hand (which lengthen or shorten the wires thus modifying the frequency of the note) you can create different types of melodies and one genre of music may sound completely different than another genre even if they use the same instruments.  Well your brain kinda works like that analogy, lots of instruments working together, and each instrument can produce a near infinite combination of notes.        Well what does this have to do with depression and lack of pleasure (anhedonia).  Well sometimes the instruments themselves are either too quiet and need a microphone (think of this as a reuptake inhibitor or certain types of drugs that modify enzymes), or they need a re-tuning for the instrument is loud enough except the desired notes are not created when the player plays them (selective agonists and antagonists which turn on or off specific receptors of that subtype, like turning on the serotonin 5ht1a, but turning off 5ht2c).  Thus there are various drugs that modify these systems, but balancing everything together feels more like an art sometimes than science, for we know a lot of the science but how complicated the system is makes it difficult to do as precise of tuning as we want to do.        Coming back to your final question, so if you are not releasing the right amount of transmitters you can sometimes flip the switches that are necessary to cause an orgasm, but it is much harder to do so.  Think of it like this, if you were playing basketball it is easier to dunk the ball if the height of the net is only 5 feet, but keep on raising it and it gets harder and harder.  Raise it high enough and instead of being a near 100% it is a fraction that is a lot more uncertain like 20% or 30%, raise it high enough and it can become more theoretical and almost literally impossible.  Am I making any sense to you? Or is this too confusing or my metaphors to obtuse?"

neuro,3cfuud,Epoh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:00:27 2015 UTC,"To put it simply, depression and mental illnesses more broadly are incredibly complex disorders involving many different components. Some cognitive (psychological- thinking patterns, personality, neuroticism, etc), social and biological. All of these are contributing factors to depression with varying levels of importance based on the individual.  Biologically speaking depression is in part tied to your genetic history, as well as more literally the way in which your brain is wired in regions associated with the array of issues associated with being depressed. Anhedonia, lack of sex drive, all of that is strongly influenced by core (evolutionarily older) emotional regions of the brain that reside in the ‘limbic system’. These regions are critical for processing positive and negative emotionality, guiding your attention, forming memories, making associations between various stimuli inyour environment, and a host of other things. These regions are important for ‘wanting’ in the case of the striatum, which seems to dissipate in anhedonia ’the inability to feel pleasure or desire anything’. The co-morbidity of depression with anxiety also suggests elevated levels of cortisol and amygdala involvement that go unchecked by higher regions which monitor these systems.   Depression is not just a struggle with excessively negative emotions it also reflects an inability to regulate negativity and up-regulate positive emotions in many cases. These struggles seem to incorporate prefrontal (evolutionarily newer) regions of the brain which harness emotionality, guide goal directed behavior and control complex thought. So in the brain, there’s many areas associated with depression and depending on the individual’s symptomatic profile there may be more specific regions that are causing their specific problem. But we are in the early stages of understanding depression on a biological level, let alone with the other components i mentioned above and there is a lot left to tease apart. The discussion about neurotransmitters is not really my area and given the jargon that gets tossed around with neurotransmitter theories I just don’t think it’s a good ground to build any reliable theory."

neuro,3c2ir0,roland00,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:33:19 2015 UTC,"Amphetamines only burn out synapses when the dose is too high, or you smoke or inhale it (taking it all at once where it reaches your brain within a few minutes vs a few hours)  What happens is your brain has to keep certain neurotransmitters within specific levels (kinda like blood sugar)  too high or too low and bad things happen.  Well when too much neurotransmitters are in place where they are not in storage inside the nerve cells (called synaptic vesicles) or in between the nerve cells doing their job, but are inside the nerve cell next to other critical nerve components called mitochondria they damage the mitochondria due to something called oxidation where they still electrons and damage the physical stability of the molecules of the mitochondria and this in turn can kill the nerve cell.   Now your body has natural defenses to prevent all of this, but too much of the drug at once and you overwhelm the defenses.  Your body has ways to move these neurotransmitters into storage where they can't do harm, enzymes to get rid of neurotransmitters, and reducing agents (aka anti-oxidants) to prevent this from happening.  But too much at once and your body natural defenses can't work.   This is the same type of thing your body uses antioxidants for to prevent cancer, reduce inflammation, and help heart disease too much of a chemical in a certain place at a certain time can be dangerous.     I know this is a long video, but watch it, it is done by Nora D Volkow one of the leading experts of Dopamine in the brain.

Are you able to consciously control it - for example, do these substitutions usually happen when you are talking freely, or do you also experience them even when strongly concentrating on a specific word you want to say (an equivalent of wilfully wanting to open the palm of your hand but getting hit by it in the face instead, completely unexpectedly). Are you sure that these problems started to appear after the accident and did not exist before? Also, very importantly, what is the frequency with which these substitutions happen? Everybody experiences brief lapses in concentration and makes errors from time to time; are you confident that this has been happening significantly more often now than it did before the accident and it cannot simply be explained by the changes in your behaviour (e.g. more stress and ""things on your mind"" which causes your attention to be divided between speaking and thinking) or simply paying more attention to its occurrences, which would result in an overestimation of the frequency? Are you the only person noticing these errors in speaking, or did other people that have known you for a longer time, notice it too?   While the top comment claims you have aphasia, that is almost surely not true. Aphasia does describe a whole family of disorders, however, the expression is normally clinically reserved for patients with clusters of language problems. It is pretty serious and would impact your life and everyday functioning significantly, which seems opposite from what you are describing.  Neuropsychologically, your symptoms would be classified as a semantic type of verbal paraphasia (most probably very mild), which is characterized by word substitutions by other words of similar meaning when speaking. Keep in mind that this is a symptom, not a disorder, and is not a direct indication of any underlying neurological condition, although it can be caused by it.   You might want to visit a clinical psychologist to try to determine the scale of your problems, although it is unlikely that they can be treated in any way. Provided that you did not suffer any focal neurological damage (which is very unlikely, however, it is possible that you suffered some minor damage of the brain white matter, for example), the most effective treatment might be some variation of CBT therapy which would help you stay focused on your speaking."

This article is not written by a neuroscientist, it is an opinion piece written by a book reviewer reviewing a book.

To break an addiction you have to use your conscious mind to change the enviroment so that your brain is not in the situation where the unconscious makes automatic decisions to your detriment, it is not about willpower but more about understanding the limits of your willpower and not subjecting you to tests of it.

I wouldn't use a conscious/unconscious distinction, all habits should be thought of as unconscious. I would make the distinction between ""habits I like"" and "" habits I don't like"". This is the distinction people need to understand. I like that I have a habit around brushing my teeth. I endorse that habit. If I had a habit around heroin, I would not like that habit. I would not endorse it."

neuro,3bs9ha,AndreDaGiant,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:00:28 2015 UTC,"it's that most people don;t understand what habits actually are.   You understand my complaint perfectly, she calls it a habit but she does not explain what she means by that word.  Most people do not understand what habits are.  They think habits are something you do.  Habits ctually are  two things  1) Automatic unconscious preferences where we automatically do them unless something changes in our environment and our automatic unconscious brain decides to try the new thing.  Habits are preprogrammed algorithims designed to work automatically and intuitively thus freeing up our conscious mind to focus on other things in our environment.  In addition by moving it to our Automatic mind we can make less types of certain types of mistakes for habits promote faster and more graceful types of movement.  2) Our conscious mind can stop habits but it requires the complete control of our attention on the habit.  Doing so is cognitively demanding and we have limits on our cognitive reserves, normal people call this will power and self control.  But habits are preferences as well as algorithims so to stop a habit with conscious control we must generate a stronger emotion and tie that emotion to another action.  We must do something else instead of the habit and that action must seem more salient more sensory/emotional important.  In my mind if you can not improve the status quo on important but divisive moral issues like addiction and you only cloudy the waters then you need to shut up.  In my opinion the author of this piece did a disservice not helping.  This is not to say the book she is reviewing is bad or good but her language choice confuses and leads to your own preconceived notions instead of clarifying and helping you learn something new."

While he does make a good point that many of the changes that accompany addiction are through learned associations with the drug, there are also changes that have nothing to do with learning such as up/down regulation of different transcription and growth factors as well as changes in intercellular communication. Both of these can be (and usually are) drug-class specific specific and can have notable effects on gene expression that over time, may not be reversible.  I also didn't agree with the heroin example given. One of the most notable things about heroin addiciton is the withdrawl. A lot of addicts will keep using to avoid the withdrawl, long after the feeling of the high is gone.   Lastly, I can't help but feel like his own experiences bias him."

neuro,3bs9ha,CTallPaul,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:47:49 2015 UTC,"Addiction is whatever you would like to label adult onset diabetes, extreme morbid obesity, or any condition that could've been prevented but the interaction between your environment/habit and your genes caused this exaggerated outcome. Yes, completely abstaining from any drugs or unhealthy food may prevent addiction or diabetes/morbid obesity but for most of the public they may be fine having a beer or a doughnut occasionally. These conditions definitely have a habit component, i.e. you had to drink alcohol or eat poorly for these conditions to develop, but its just as much a problem with aberrant physiological responses (possibly due to genetics) to these events/substances, i.e. increased incentive/salience for alcohol. In any case, for conditions like diabetes and not as much morbid obesity, the public views them as ""diseases"" or something that the patient didn't have much to do with the development of it. However, this leads to the authors point, that people with these disorders hear that they are a disease and believe there is nothing they can do now, I.e. I'm going to be bed ridden anyways might as well eat or I'm an alcoholic anyways might as well drink. Thus, it is important to stress that although it is whatever medical label you'd like, it is reversible or at least manageable. Thus, whatever you consider diabetes or morbid obesity as you should consider addiction as an equal of the three.  Edit: words"

I'm primarily interested as a researcher of biological Rhythms, but on a much longer timescale, more like hours to days. I had never really considered that synchronous visual or auditory inputs might have a beneficial effect on cognitive processing but I'm starting to chew on this idea a bit and its very intriguing. If we can give light to treat jetlag, why not for other dynamical diseases. As long as the timescales of stimulation are appropriate and the multimodal input is sufficiently salient, it could potentially help reentrain abberent firing between or within connected brain structures. It makes me wonder too if ECT isn't just a really powerful type 0 phase resetting stimulus that synchs up the entire brain all at once. I guess the real question is...if an apropriate stimulus can be found for entrainment, how long might the beneficial effect actually last? Especially under pathological conditions that are promoting desynchronization in the first place."

neuro,3bn7zi,roland00,10,Wed Jul 1 06:03:31 2015 UTC,"Both of these medications must be administered multiple times a day to work: levitiracetam and valproic acid. In order to maintain a steady state (particularly for the depakene), it needs to be dosed multiple times a day. Missing a dose on occasion will probably not cause any harm, (assuming his serum valproic acid levels remain therapeutic) but consistently taking it only once a day will inevitably lead you to having subtherapeutic levels, meaning it won't have an anti-seizure effect. Keppra must (almost) always be given twice a day. It probably is not the best idea to mess with the dose without your pediatric neurologist knowing about it. If your son has gone several months without a seizure, that would be a time to discuss the idea of slowly tapering off of one of his medications (and hopefully one day, off of all seizure medications entirely). The decision may also be based on what his future EEG's look like. This may or may not be possible given his particular case. Valproic acid (depakene) is heavily metabolized by the liver but the majority of people on this medication do not experience serious liver problems. The Keppra is renally metabolized, but I have never seen it actually cause kidney failure-- the dose is lowered in people who have kidney issues. I know childhood epilepsy can be very jarring and stressful for parents--I wish your family the best and hope your son can one day be entirely seizure free!   Source: Resident Neurologist"

neuro,3bn7zi,Unester,2,Wed Jul 1 04:24:19 2015 UTC,"Don't mess around with seizures in young children you need to be consulting a medical expert, this may mean getting a second opinion.  How the brain is forming is very different in children than what is occurring in teenagers and adults.  Your brain is laying its foundation that will effect your child for the rest of his life.  You may not notice any immediate consequences once the seizure starts but having multiple seizures modifies how the brain forms and organizes itself and these changes are often permanent!  Such changes in how the brain forms due to seizures can affect memory both short and long term, with your son's spatial reasoning, and even emotional problems such as being more prone to stress, certain anxiety disorders, and depression.  This is a serious condition where there is an imbalance of the type of nerves that say go and the type of nerves that say stop/inhibit, or some other factor involving the actual subsystem of components invovled with generating chemical and electrical transmission of these nerve cells.  Think of it as your son having a metaphorical house and it routinely has lighting strikes that fry electronics or cause fires, your son's brain is not doing what is supposed to keep everything in balance.  Two things I want you to take away   1) Do not make decisions about the health of your child based off emotion and intuition.  Emotion and intuition should cause you to consort a second informed epilepsy expert for a medical opinion, not making decisions off your uninformed intuition.  Right now you assuming less medicine is good for your kid is like assuming all tomatoes are poisonous, or all mushrooms are poisonous just because one thing looks like the other does not mean they work the same way in the inside. 2) If your are not satisfied with your child's medical care please get a second informed medical opinion which is not the internet but instead a doctor who is an expert in epilepsy.  About 70% of children who had multiple seizures as a child grow out of it as an adult, this has to do with brain stuff.  Furthermore we have many anti epilepsy medicines that we have since developed in the 1990s and 2000s.  Dr. Stephen Stahl of Univ of California San Diego (previously of UCLA and Stanford)  lists 14 anticonvulsants/epilepsy agents in his medical textbook ""Essential Psychopharmacology Prescriber's Guide"" a handbook with go to information involving all the medical details and things you should know about medicines and interactions involving drugs that affect the brain.  This is the information the doctor should be intimately familiar with before prescribing a med off that list .  Well of those 14 medicines for epilepsy over half of them have come out since 1994.  Furthermore it does not even list 3 of the new anti epilepsy medicines that have recently came out by the FDA in the late 2000s even though the book is on its 5th edition released in 2014   Being concerned about your child health is a good thing,  use that parental concern to make informed decisions to improve the wellbeing of your son.  You need to do this to help him thrive.  Please do not make medical decisions off instinct and intuition for sometimes these natural human notions are very wrong."

neuro,3bistd,ampanmdagaba,2,Mon Jun 29 16:00:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry to say but to have your data be remotely, let alone publishably accurate you will need an osmometer.   Made thousands of solutions, even with spot on measurements on balances accurate to .1mg, it never comes out as calculated - even with adjustment for a given recipe (& pristine glassware, consistent gas solvation practices etc.) each mix is different and needs to be adjusted. this is not to mention the inherent nonlinearity of solubilization - multiplying predicted ion concentrations is a gross oversimplification.   It DOES MATTER for recordings regardless of source of cells (contrary to other posts). Most notably- cells use chloride channels among others to maintain cytosol volume/membrane area homeostasis. Cl channels are not linear shunts as is thought all too commonly, they change the qualitative electrical properties of the cell (see prescott's work). 2nd, turgor pressure at the membrane causes all membrane bound proteins to alter their function, classic biophysics result. Third, cell morphology alterations in general dramatically alter cable properties, synaptic stability via cytoskeletal tension, and ultimately the ephys properties you will read via activity based homeostasis (recent plos comp biol article on morphology, marder's 2002 paper on activity homeostasis).   The problem stems from a)imprecise and b)inconsistent ion concentrations! Imprecise and you will kill your cells/have unreadable, unusable data. Inconsistent and you will be unable to compare across trials. I'm skeptical of 250mOsm, mammals are typically 300-310 extra.c. I work in amphibians, abnormally low at 270. There is no replacement for an accurate osmolarity measurement directly from the target cells and CSF.   I only comment so you won't waste time - it is easy to fall into the confirmation bias trap on stuff like this, don't be the person months or years down the road with inscrutable and unpublishable data b/c you skipped the osmometer.

There is no scientific evidence supporting the concept of adrenal fatigue and it is not recognized as an actual diagnosis by the medical community.   Blood or salivary testing is sometimes offered but there is no evidence that adrenal fatigue exists or can be tested.

He believes, like many people then, that the computer is a good metaphor for the mind/brain. In addition, he believes, like many people then, that the only alternative way to understanding the mind/brain comes from studying the molecular properties of neurons. He seems unaware of any advances in neuroscience since then. I mean, people nowadays have largely rejected the computer metaphor and reductionist approaches and usually argue for a systems approach to the brain. Look for example at work by Olaf Sporns on network theory and global brain activity. Perhaps Professor Markus does not want to know. Perhaps we should just ignore him."
neuro,3bbxg4,sjap,2,Mon Jun 29 13:28:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think that this is true at all unless you're talking about a metaphor relating the brain to our concept of a desktop computer. Everything the brain does is computation. All of biology is computation. What we're trying to do is figure out how the machine computes. Part of this involves figuring out what the parts are, another figures out how they work together, and yet another figures out how this gives rise to the behavior we observe and the things the machine 'experiences'.   Furthermore, the metaphor of a computer is still used. One example: computer scientists nowadays are finding that the most efficient computation is carried out using a combination of analog and digital means. This metaphor for the brain is explicitly alive and well."
neuro,3bbxg4,neurone214,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:36:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that the brain does computation, but that is not what Markus is talking about here.   The computer metaphor is not about computation. We all agree that what the brain does is computing. The computer metaphor is about the parallel between hardware/software and brain/mind. So just as in a computer we can distinguish between hardware and software as two separate entities, in biology we can distinguish between brain and mind as two separate entities. Following this, many cognitive psychologists (like Markus) believe that just as you can separate software from hardware, you can study the mind without knowing anything about the brain. From the perspective of a cognitive psychologist, we have a lot of knowledge about how the mind works. There are many detailed mechanistic theories framed in the language of cognitive psychology. Again, from the perspective of the cognitive psychologist, the question then becomes how all this cognitive machinery (software) is computed by the brain (hardware). From this perspective, he is arguing that we have no idea how to translate all the cognitive theories into the hardware of the brain. And from this perspective he argues that we know next to nothing about how the brain works.  However, note that he is really in a minority position here. I would think that modern neuroscientists do not agree with the computer metaphor, and assume that brain and mind are intricately connected. There is no clear hardware/software distinction between brain and mind because the mind is what emerges from the brain. Following this, most modern neuroscientists would also argue that studying the brain should come before studying the mind, because the mind emerges from the brain. This is why I mentioned systems approaches, because they assume that the mind is the result of the many interactions between millions of distributed neurons.   So the perspective Markus has is wrong, he is starting from the mind and tries to map that onto the brain. This doesn't work, and therefore he is confused. Finally, he just does not know the recently literature because he still believes that a reductionist view is the only alternative view to understanding the brain, which nobody believes.  I just find it a bit sad that somebody with such outdated views has a regular opinion column called 'gray matter views' in the New York Times."

neuro,3ay6kh,theposhfox,7,Wed Jun 24 13:21:27 2015 UTC,"While I commend your efforts to be educated about the brain and your personal health, I think you should try to find other sources... quite simply, none of this is true.   1) Sodium is a monovalent cation (has a single positive charge), and while this causes it to quickly associate with any nearby negatively charged molecule (forming a salt), there is nothing intrinsically 'toxic' about this.   2) The cerebrospinal fluid is highly, highly regulated, and consumption of more sodium (be it table salt or MSG) is not going to change the concentrations of sodium in this fluid.   3) Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that can have neurotoxic (so-called 'excitotoxic') effects, but this is usually only true in the case of injury, or diseases of plasticity (like epilepsy, for one). Additionally, there are a huge amount of safeguards to prevent glutamate from just floating around in the extracellular space, like uptake by synapse-invading astrocytes. As a result, you really don't have much glutamate sitting around out there, and any that might be was released from synapses, and not just dropped in there from eating MSG.   4) Glutamate is one of the amino acids that make up all proteins. If you eat anything – I repeat: ANYTHING – with protein and salt in it, it will almost definitely have MSG. For some reason, MSG was made to seem evil and toxic, but is really just a normal salt version of an amino acid. If you are reacting to something, it is extremely unlikely that it is the glutamate, and I dare say that this impression would disappear if you were blinded to the conditions. Indeed, a quick scan of the wikipedia article shows citations for several studies that were actually blinded, and revealed no connection of MSG or glutamate consumption to any diseases or health problems.   5) There are not ""certain kinds"" of glutamate /glutatmic acid; there is one molecule, and that is it. It can associate with different things (as in salt form), but it's still just one molecule. Glutamate from chicken is the same as glutamate from vegetables.   Finally, I would be cautious about trying to self-medicate. It sounds like you've been running into a lot of bad information to start with, so trying to solve the problem from a bad beginning is going to create trouble.

I would also be a little more patient with your doctors, since it sounds like you're in no place to 'school' them, if you've been telling them what you're posting here.   When I say ""Schooling"" them I mean literally telling them what an anticonvulsant is. Most of them think Lyrica (calcium-channel blocker) is a ""non-addictive pain killer"" but don't even know what class of drug its in, that it has a withdrawal syndrome, or that it even affects glutamate. They have no clue, including the neurologists. They dole out this drug like it's the best thing since sliced bread and have no idea how it works or what it does.   I don't tell them crackpot theories off of Longecity (or even Reddit) because I have no way to validate them. That's why I posted this thread in the first place: to learn what's actually happen.    I dare say that this impression would disappear if you were blinded to the conditions.   Nope. This sensitivity has only come about after Lyrica withdrawal. For about a year, I was suffering constantly, unable to sleep, etc. because I wasn't controlling my diet. Then I learned that Lyrica has similar withdrawal problems to alcohol and benzodiazepine drugs, causing what's called the ""kindling effect,"" which many people report is exaserbated by MSG.  I'm not claiming MSG is toxic to most people, but Lyrica has in some way compromised me to its effects, including to ""free glutamic acid"" found in many plant-based sources. I don't know why or how, and quite frankly, I am getting sick and tired of people telling me that I'm imagining it. I'm not, and I have replicated these problems time and time again, including in a ""blinded"" fashion with my partner, who wouldn't tell me what was in the dishes I was eating to see what exactly was triggering it.   If you don't believe me, that's fine   I do believe you, but ultimately I want more of an explanation. Why is Lyrica persisting in its withdrawal? Why is it that only certain foods trigger panic attacks, why does the only correlation seem to be unbound glutamic acid content, and why am I otherwise unaffected in my day-to-day life if I avoid these foods? What is the physiological basis for this withdrawal syndrome?"
neuro,3ay6kh,theposhfox,3,Wed Jun 24 19:44:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not telling you that what you feel isn't real. Withdrawal from Lyrica is certainly real. However, you're trying to attribute a mechanism to it, and it sounds like you're making a lot of assumptions. I even believe that the foods you're eating are truly giving you a reaction. However, this might be an unrelated reaction that simply enhances the unpleasant sensations of the withdrawal from Lyrica.   Eating MSG does not cause increased amounts of free glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid. Period. I would be happy to admit that MSG is toxic, but given our current knowledge, it makes absolutely no sense that it would be. MSG is in everything. Given this, and the fact that all of the literature seems to support there being no effect, I'd be much more prone to believe that there is something else causing your symptoms. A lot of things can correlate well, but that does not imply causation. I commend you for being as unbiased as you can here, and of course, you can never really rule out any possibility. However, my money would be on the fact that MSG has absolutely nothing to do with this, and I think considering that as the more likely option will help you arrive at a better conclusion.   I understand that you want more of an explanation; we all want that when we experience health problems. I've met a lot of people in my day that swear they've found the answer to their problems that have proven difficult to solve, but when they are properly blinded, this falls apart. This isn't them 'making it up', and it isn't them being stupid or anything like that. This is the placebo effect, which is a very real neurological phenomenon. I repeat: the placebo effect does NOT mean you're making it up. What it does mean is that there is an interaction between the expected results and the actual neurological outcomes. Feelings of anxiety are among the most readily apparent behaviors that arise from such expectations. Given that 1) there is no documented evidence of MSG causing any health problems, 2) that MSG does not increase cerebrospinal fluid sodium or glutamate levels, and 3) that 'free' glutamate is very readily taken up by cells like asctrocytes and doesn't just float around activating NMDA receptors, e.g., I believe that the symptoms you are felling – while very real, and even likely correctly attributed to certain foods – are not due to MSG.   As you mentioned, Lyrica is a sort of calcium channel blocker. It binds to a certain subunit of a calcium channel and decreases calcium entry. The result of this is that you get a decrease in the release of a lot of neurotransmitters, including glutamate, but also including norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and several others. Typically, when you have changes in the tonic levels of neurotransmitters, the brain tries to account for this by increasing the number of receptor levels. Thus, even though you have less of a particular neurotransmitter, the postsynaptic cells are more sensitive to it, and this 'homeostatic plasticity', as we call it, can help account for long-term changes such as those caused by Lyrica. When you go off Lyrica, the drug is removed relatively quickly from your body, and so the calcium channels are freed from their blockade. Now, however, you have normal levels of neurotransmitter AND higher receptor numbers, meaning you're probably getting a lot more signaling than you should. This is likely the cause for the withdrawal. In time, your body will normalize (decrease) the number of receptors to a level appropriate to the amount of neurotransmitter.   The withdrawal should be relatively short-lived. I'm unsure why you are experiencing a 'prolonged' withdrawal, but consider this: Lyrica is anxiolytic (reduces anxiety), and so, even without the withdrawal effects, you might feel more anxious than before, when you were on the drug (and might even be more prone to panic attacks).   While there are potential dietary influences on some neurological diseases (ketogenic diets seem to help with epilepsy, e.g.), I have never heard of something leading to increased anxiety, especially as quickly as would seem to be the case here.   I hope I hit on a few of your questions, and I'd be happy to answer more, if you have them!"
neuro,3ay6kh,dspeyer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:34:23 2015 UTC,"This is the placebo effect   Sigh. Here we go again.  My partner likes making me lunches for work. They typically select the ingredients and make it for me based on their best guesses. Up until very recently, I never paid attention to what I was eating, and I'd always pay for it with a day-long panic attack followed by a night of shitty sleeping. I'd be sitting at my desk, literally nothing happening and no triggers, and I get tinnitus, headache, jitters, paranoia - the works.  I'd wake up the next day, feeling messed up, and Google all the ingredients in the meal the day before. Lo and behold, one of the ingredients would be high in glutamic acid - cauliflower, broccoli, soy sauce, whatever. I'd pack the next day's lunches without it. Nothing bad would happen.  Then I'd forget to tell my partner about this restriction, and they'd make something with cauliflower again. Panic attack ensues. I ask what was in the dish. Pureed cauliflower. Oh, there we go.  I'm not saying the glutamic acid is entering my brain directly, and it makes little sense given that glutamic acid in bound form (found in chicken) doesn't affect me, but the dissociated glutamic acid found in cooked vegetables seems to hit me every time. I just don't know what the deal is.  I don't even know if this is at all related to NMDA/AMPA or anything like that. It feels more adrenaline-based with the heart pounding and all that, but it is ALWAYS triggered these vegetable sources of protein, and it's driving me fucking nuts. I don't even care if MSG is the culprit at this point. I don't even thing MSG is evil or even all that ""toxic,"" honestly.  So please, humour me: IF (and a big IF) this reaction is bona-fide physical, what could be the possible mechanism of action? Is the free glutamic acid causing my adrenal gland to go nuts and pump out a bunch of adrenaline? Is it causing the release of some substance which then does that? What could possibly, theoretically, maybe cause this sort of reaction, assuming placebo effect isn't in play here? Because again, I can go weeks without any problems, but then one day I'll say ""aw, how much could a few pieces of broccoli hurt?"" or I'll eat some friend's mystery dish and find out they used soy sauce after and bam, it's like I'm back at day one of withdrawal.

neuro,3ay6kh,dspeyer,2,Wed Jun 24 22:39:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to upset you, and I'm perfectly willing to humor any questions you have. But I want to return with a few points:  1) The placebo effect IS PHYSICAL. It is not imaginary, it is not 'just psychological' (whatever that means), and it is something to always consider as a culprit for causing real, physical changes and outcomes. If someone writes something off to the placebo effect, they are NOT saying you're faking it, they are NOT saying you're imagining it, and your apparent frustration with the topic frankly shows a misunderstanding of what the effect is, and the fact that it could easily fit the situation that you described, even elaborated upon as above.    2) That said, I will do as you request and ignore the possibility that it's placebo. We'll assume that your response to these vegetables is 100% purely due to the vegetables themselves. Even in this case, I still don't think this has anything to do with glutamate. You have a misunderstanding of how glutamate is found in foods. The notion of 'free' and 'bound' glutamate is misused in your above comment. Free and bound states refer only to the states you would observe in a solution when binding/unbinding to receptors, and this is not applicable when referring to food sources. Glutamate is not 'free' in vegetables and 'bound' in chicken. In both cases, glutamate is an amino acid in proteins, and when those proteins are digested in the stomach, they are broken down into peptides (amino acid chains) and amino acids. That's where the glutamate comes from, and apart from possible differences in the relative amounts of the amino acids, the amino acids themselves are exactly the same. No bound form, no free form, just proteins->amino acids. If you're saying that the cooking process breaks it down, that's partially true, but it's mostly a denaturation of the proteins, and not actually breaking their bonds. Further, unless you eat raw chicken, this would also apply to chicken.   3) I imagine that it could be the case that you're having some kind of autonomic response to the vegetables you're eating, which might cause an increase in adrenergic tone (more adrenaline). If you're still in withdrawal from your medicine, you might be hyper-sensitive to it. I've never quite heard of anything like this happening, and this would fall in some weird zone between an allergic reaction and an autonomic one, which kind of act against each other in many cases (the autonomic responses to which I'm referring often suppress the immune system, which isn't what you'd want in the case of an allergic reaction).   4) The soy sauce itself might actually be the best clue so far. Soy sauce is famously high in sodium (just forget the glutamate for now). While the cerebrospinal fluid is carefully regulated, as I already mentioned, blood doesn't necessarily get the same kind of treatment. Since most cells outside of the nervous system aren't electrically excitable, the ionic concentrations of things like sodium are a little more free to vary without damage to those cells (a neuron, on the other hand, is heavily affected by these ions, and therefore the cerebrospinal fluid is highly filtered and carefully monitored to rule this out).  The filtering of blood and monitoring of its contents is somewhat of a gradual process that takes place over various steps in the body, and very high sodium intake can show up in blood. Now, this is where my expertise ends, but I can venture a guess: your reaction might be to the high sodium intake. The higher sodium levels in your blood might cause a response in your heart and vasculature (you've probably heard that salty diets are bad for your heart) which could transiently increase your blood pressure. The subsequent response of the rest of your body to this event might be one of stress and anxiety, which might lead to the other symptoms you're feeling, especially if you're still in withdrawal (even if withdrawal is tapering off, you might still be more sensitive to a lot of different neurotransmitter systems that might kick in in the aftermath of the cardiac effects). This is just a guess based on what I know, and I'm sorry that's all I can offer.   I understand that you're frustrated about your condition, but you should try to be a little more patient with those that are trying to help you out. I'm taking time out of my day to offer any expertise that I have to you, and your reactions are slightly caustic and aggressive. Also, you don't seem very willing to accept any explanations outside of what you think it might be, and most of the time, that will really get you nowhere. Asking experts about their opinion, then getting frustrated at them for giving them, and then telling them that they must be mistaken and are wrong really defeats the purpose of asking experts in the first place.   I wish you luck in figuring out your issues, but I recommend a slight change of approach before you continue to ask others for help."

I don't know if this usage is standard, but that is a difference which can be found in food (at least until the proteases finish turning the former into the latter)."
neuro,3ay6kh,pylori,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:45:39 2015 UTC,"This is a reach, but theory...  Proteins get broken down to amino acids in the digestive system, so if free vs bound glutamate is making any difference it has to be in the stomach or upper intestine.  And it turns out there are glutamate receptors there.  Some run to the brain, but most link to elsewhere in the digestive system.  I'm a little unclear on the details (and I get the impression no one knows all of it), but they seem to effect the both the release of digestive substances and the movement of food through the GI tract.  These intra-GI neurons use the same calcium channels as brain neurons, so they'll be subject to the same compensatory upregulation.  Handwaving vigorously, we might guess that nerves which should alter food movement for better protein-breakdown, when overactive, might cause the stomach to clench in a way similar to fear.  A lot of physical responses to emotion can operate backwards, so something in your brain thinks ""my stomach is clenched so I must be terrified"" and then some sort of positive feedback loop (panic attack at the thought of having a panic attack?) takes it from there.  This is only a guess, and I can't think of any safe way to confirm it."

The theory was created by researchers Stanley Schachter and Jerome E. Singer.

This can sometimes cause misinterpretations of emotions based on the body’s physiological state.

I'm impressed most of the time if the patients can tell me what drug they're taking and what for, let alone anything about its pharmacology or classification.  I say this because pregabalin is used, aside for anti-convulsant properties, for neuropathic pain, much like it's cousin gabapentin. And while they do block calcium channels, it's not the sort of thing you think of when someone says calcium channel blocker (which I'd think more about heart medications like diltiazem, amlodipine, verapamil, etc). So in order to avoid confusion of patients, doctors frequently simplify things, and in your case that may mean referring to pregabalin as a pain medication. Indeed some anti-depressants like amitryptiline are used for fibromyalgia as well, but it may scare patients to refer to their medication as an anti-depressant rather than as a pain medication, even if it is both (and its used more for pain these days than against depression).  For those that care to know, most doctors (I've seen) are perfectly happy to give more precise definitions, but most patients don't want to know and so they're fine with referring to metoprolol as their heart medication rather than a beta-blocker. All this is to say that if you want to know more details or have questions, do ask your doctor. They likely know more than you seem to think, it's just a fine balance between explaining things to patients enough so they can understand but not so much that they're lost in the details. And it's something many doctors have trouble with."

neuro,3axete,justgivingsomeadvice,2,Wed Jun 24 07:17:50 2015 UTC,"Dry EEG technology is still in its infancy, the main issue being artifact generated from a poor connection with the scalp. As with any other EEG system you are limited in what you can claim due to poor spatial resolution and the assumptions that different time-frequency changes over certain electrodes or groups of electrodes correlate with certain cognitive events.  A very cool technique is the steady state evoked potential which provides, in my opinion, a much better way of assessing what your user is doing. For example, a steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) occurs when a person focuses on a stimulus that is flickering at a certain frequency and regions of cortex that are processing this stimulus yield measurable activity at this same rate. Many brain computer interfaces utilize this technique as it boosts your signal to noise ratio if the stimulus is strong enough."
neuro,3axete,Cyphergk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:37:31 2015 UTC,"There are really three issues here that feed into what makes products from companies like Neurosky in their current stage of development at worst useless and at best gimmicky toys.   One is conductance and sensitivity. As Cyphergk says, a dry electrode is going to have a lot of artifact noise, probably to the point where any EEG researcher who saw the impedance measures would want to curl up in a ball and weep. Another issue is the limited number of electrodes that seem to be part of these systems. You aren't going to gather much useful data from just two or three little spots on your scalp, which is why most of them can only tell the difference between you being 'relaxed' or 'focused' (i.e. it's just reading your generalized alpha oscillations). Now one could argue that both of these problems aren't that big of a deal in the face of what you actually want to use the system for. For example, if the purpose was something like changing the channel on your TV than you don't really need super fancy equipment or a really low signal to noise ratio. However, if you want to actually measure something that you can get even remotely close to saying has any cognitive relevance than you need to find a way to eliminate or at least reduce these problems. That's where tightly controlled lab based research comes in.   It's possible that some day in the future a dry electrode cap will be sufficient enough to use in the lab, but for the types of products you're speaking of there really is no way of reducing movement artifacts in a free moving system. I'm not sure how sophisticated the equipment is and if it involves any mathematical formulas which essentially filter and smooth incoming signals in a similar way to how we would pre-process data for analysis, but even that has potential downfalls and requires theoretical knowledge to make informed decisions on which formulas to use effectively. In terms of preventing other artifacts I would say the most obvious is to avoid using your system while standing next to other electrical sources that are going to produce frequency noise as much as possible."

Just dealing with artifacts like ECG, EMG, etc. are difficult enough. Current literature uses a lot of DSP (e.g. ICA??) and some other techniques I'm less familiar with. So yeah, it's definitely highly theoretical and mathematical, although that's less a deterrent for me and more a motivating factor. I think that stuff shouldn't be a problem, it'll be a pain to implement in real time but it seems doable.  I have read papers, though, that using the valence-arousal framework and some type of machine learning classifier (SVMs mainly), researchers have been able to categorize six principal emotions (no doubt in highly controlled lab settings): happiness, relaxed, sad, disappointment, and two more I can't remember offhand. So at least theoretically, with a robust handling of noise and using these techniques, you could do a lot more than your generic Neurosky product. Whether it can be done in real time... well that's another matter.   Also, the papers I've read also agree with you that's it's impossible to get usable signals from an EEG device alone from someone who's moving... I'm not sure how an ambulatory EEG works but I'm going to assume it has some other information to help remove those motion artifacts. That's probably the biggest takeaway I have, and someone else saying it aloud more or less is a relief!   Anyways, all in all thanks for the response! The fact that I can read your post and think about how it applies to my specific goals and what's in the literature is already great news. Cheers!"

You have to get at the chip to discriminate among these signals. I was working with an electronic engineer who was captivated with the Neurosky chip and wanted to see if we could do interesting biomedical things with it. In practice, using any good conductor along with a reference as input to the chip resulted in usable signal. It was an open question whether using more than one electrode would result in excess cross-talk or not. We stopped the collaboration over differences in opinion.  With good signal from a large number of electrodes you can infer a lot. But my expertise is mostly in conventional EEG rather than dry electrodes."

There are days when I sit on my ass and do nothing at all where my brain would have had to just keep my bodily processes running (not precisely, but you get the point) There are other days when I would do a large amount of mental tasks and assimilate lots of information, without breaking a sweat.  I'm not talking about extraordinary brain capacities or memory, which require training and practice.   Is this range of brain activities comparable to that of any muscle, which can accommodate a range of activities going from 0 to moderate activity, without exhausting itself? Like exercise, training it to the point of failure would build it back stronger.  I guess my question really is, in an lowest-energy favouring process like natural selection, why wouldn't brain evolution tend towards the lowest common denominator which would still get the job done, but not give a lot of cognitive advantage?

I know it's common for laypeople to think about neurotransmitters as having ""functions"", but their function is to modulate neural activity. Neural activity is what is generating feelings of happiness and optimism, sadness and misery, not neurotransmitters. Now, there is no doubt that in certain places, such as the nucleus accumbens, as you rightly point out, there is a large number of dopaminergic neurons. It does not mean that dopamine is the ""reward molecule"". Dopamine is involved in a vast number of functions, one of which just happens to be reward."

There is probably a certain combination which is dependent on binding location of the neurotransmitters released and the amount itself of the neurotransmitters released.  So, isn't it known about any combination of neurotransmitters that leads to feelings of happiness? I mean, for example, isn't it possible that a drop in serotonin binding in the amygdala occupied by a rise in oxytocin, prolaction and dopamine in certain brain pathways can generate some sort of a neural activity that would cause feelings of happiness? It doesn't necessarily has to be these neurotransmitters, they served as an example.  And of course, dopamine obviously isn't only related to reward. What I meant is that in certain brain areas, such as the nucleus accumbens, dopamine binding is strongly associated with reward. In other areas it can have different functions, like movement in the substantia nigra, incentive salience in the striatum, anxiety in the amygdala.  If neural activity is modulated by neurotransmitters, it means that there's a certain combination of neurotransmitters in certain pathways that lead to this specific neural activity that induces psychological feelings of happiness. Is there any research about this subject on neuroscience (the combination of neurotransmitters that leads to different feelings)?"

Liking is usually associated with reward, and is usually linked to the opioid system - rewards such as orgasms and high-sugar foods induce the release of endorphins in certain pathways under certain circumstances, and they make you feel ""rewarded"". This reward feeling is most of the time associated with physical sensations such as warm waves washing over the body.  I think happiness is different. Happiness is more about optimism about everything and empathy towards other people, and it is not usually related to these feelings of warmth related to liking (in my opinion, happiness can be very different from ""liking"", the reward's euphoria). So maybe happiness is not related to hedonic hotspots? Feeling of euphoria and of happiness are both good feelings, but they're also different - as I mentioned, happiness usually includes optimism and empathy while it lacks the physical ""blanket"" (warmth) and such feelings associated with liking (specifically, activation of certain opioid receptors, and possibly CB1 and GABA receptors)."

Activity in a brain region has significance in terms of what it projects to, and, in turn, where those regions project to. Understanding the existence of correlated activity in central amygdala or dopaminergic neurons does not mean we understand what their activity is encoding. It is likely that neural basis of experiences of the underdetermined ""happiness"" involve a concert of activity across multiple regions, and hence you won't be able to point to it without advances in our understanding of computational neuroscience. For instance, partial activity of hedonic hotspots will likely co-occur in experiences of happiness, but the causal impact of that activity will be dependent on the particular neural context it is occurring in (and the correlations we have currently don't tell us much about its larger causal role). So we can't throw out subnetworks just because happiness has something more to it, because we know that what subnetworks are actually ""doing"" in their contribution to the emergent experience is far more nuanced than we currently understand in computational neuroscience.  If I had to point to some regions I additionally think are related to happiness, I'd say the contents of vmPFC, OFC, and dopaminergically gated DLPFC are essential for establishing a feeling of happiness, as many limbic projections contribute to establishing values to environmental cues, even including things like heart rate or bodily discomfort, to inform task dependent values of information for potential outcomes of decisions. I would suspect having a PFC context which attributes positive attributes to your environment or choices would probably produce a neural correlate with happiness.  shrugs but these are fairly minimal claims, which don't at all approach a meaningful explanation of something which clearly involves dynamics across many large brain systems."

When I'm asked to imagine an apple my brain just lists off facts and details that set apples apart from everything else).  Personally, I just see black. When I think of something the impression of that image is there... like thinking about Tom Cruise I can almost see his toothy grin, beady eyes and short hair but it doesn't really all come together or last more than the smallest fraction of a second.  If I were asked to rotate a shape in my mind, or find directions somewhere, I rely on my mental understanding of direction, positioning & distance rather than seeing anything.  I can imagine what it must be like, though, because I do have a ""mind's ear"" - I can hear songs in my head just by thinking about them, and I have a very good sense of rhythm and timing. My visualisation gets stronger during hypangogia sometimes but still never anywhere close to vivid, and I do dream visually sometimes but once again - it's not very vivid."

neuro,3aqw04,StoneSpace,3,Mon Jun 22 23:36:51 2015 UTC,"Do people on average actually hallucinate imagery   { would not call it a hallucination, for me,because I can control the images. As an example, if you say ""Penguin"" to me,in my mind's eye,I can see a penguin either as realistic or a cartoon. Since I'm an artist, I can draw it and rotate it in my head if I wanted to sculpt it.   Also,in reading,as the story unfolds,the real world vanishes and it's like I'm watching a movie in my head."

I would say mine are not dim at all, but they are usually black and white unless I consciously try to include color.  I guess I interact with them, but it feels more like I'm the one that is changing my perspective.  I used to be a wifi network designer and can imagine 500+ condo unit building layouts in 3D very easily. I got to the point where I could imagine the wifi signal visually, the reflections, absorptions, strong and dead spots, etc, as someone would be walking through the building,  all based on memory of the objects and materials they are made of.  I could then remember hundreds of past designs for years and then plan upgrades off my memory while I am imagining walking through them. Or, I could visualize which equipment was down based on a customer's complaint of a dead spot. I would then describe what a technician would expect to see when they got there, sometimes including how to pull a new cable through the walls or whatever.   I would even say that my entire memory bank and body of knowledge is represented in my mind by a 4D visual architecture with a sort of scaffolding of associations. Every new thing I learn, especially a scientific concept, gets integrated into the visually accessible network.  The more I learn about a subject, the better I get at recalling an individual part of it, as if the symbolic web of associations actually correspond to a physical denser synaptic web in my brain, thus creating more virtual and physical/biological paths to that image/idea/association. I always thought everyone thought like this, but lately it seems like there is a lot of diversity out there when it comes to the predominant structural makeup.  I wonder if some people do analogous things, except use other senses. I know some people's memories are more movement-related, but what about tactile, auditory or olfactory, I wonder?"

Subjectively, my entire 'mental life' is almost entirely linguistic, and I've always been terrible at those shape rotation tests.   Interestingly, though, I am very good at spacial relationships. I can't visually imagine a map of the world, for example, but I can draw a very detailed and accurate one, or describe it in terms of where one country is in relation to the next. I can take one look at a new route on google maps and remember it, and I can navigate to anywhere I have been once from anywhere else I have been, either using some common point as a bridge or generating my own 'link,' which is accurate unless there is an obstruction I didn't know about. I don't know how 'special' that is, as my only comparison is my girlfriend who doesn't know which way to turn when she leaves a building.   For reading, I know what words mean so I know what is happening, but I can't 'watch' it in my head. The best I have is an understanding of where things are relative to each other spatially. Everything seems to come down to spatial- relationships. At least that makes neuroanatomy a breeze."

He's using multi-electrode arrays to record and stimulate the retina at the same time.  It is mostly basic research but very cool stuff. In the talk he described how they were recording from individual retinal ganglion cells using a multi-electrode array (MEA) to measure their response properties. Once they've characterize the neurons they convolve the visual input with the estimated receptive field for each cell and feed the appropriate input back to each cell. The basic idea is that in once the degenerative blindness is diagnosed the patient could receive the retinal implant to learn the visually evoked responses of some RGCs in the fovea and as the degenerative disease destroys the supporting circuitry the MEA replaces the direct visual input with artificial and targeted electric stimulation.

neuro,3adyyy,highbuzz,2,Fri Jun 19 18:47:48 2015 UTC,"From my understanding of this article after quickly skimming it, this could imply lower serotonin. The higher turnover rate that they found suggests that in depressed patients they saw serotonin was converted to a different metabolite much more quickly, effectively meaning they have low serotonin levels.  In SSRI treated patients, they saw a lower level of turn over suggesting that it slowed the conversion to the other metabolite, implying there is more serotonin."
neuro,3adyyy,SuperAgonist,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't you attribute the fact that SSRIs take a long time to start working to Serotonin desensitization? Most patients who take SSRIs experience an inital WORSENING of their depression, and only after a few weeks they start noticing an improvement.  This sounds exactly like desensitization. Post-synaptic 5-HT receptors just downregulate after taking SSRIs for a while. So the initial worsening in depression could be because of higher serotonin binding, but the improvement later could be because of a low serotonin binding (as receptors downregulate).  SSRIs tend to worsen depression when they are first taken. The improvement is more likely to be from the lowered sensitivity to serotonin."
neuro,3adyyy,highbuzz,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:43:43 2015 UTC,You bring up a good idea - I downloaded a few papers over depression and SSRI mechanisms. Let me refresh my memory on these things and I'll get a reply back to you.
neuro,3adyyy,highbuzz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:10:41 2015 UTC,"So from my reading of a few reviews, what they think SSRIs is close to what you're saying but the end results are different.  So when beginning the SSRI treatment, the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) is blocked, resulting in more serotonin in the cleft (though only modestly when measured extracellular). But this modest increase leads to a negative feedback loop, where the serotonergic neurons are inhibited from discharging. This effect is mediated by the 5-HT1A auto-receptor (and a few other factors but this seems to be the main driver).  However, chronic SSRI treatment leads to down-regulation of these auto-receptors and also desensitization, as you've mentioned. This dampens the negative feedback loop that had developed and leads to more 5-HT release and neuronal discharges.  More 5-HT release then leads to post-synaptic 5-HT receptor desensitization, which then leads to slightly more serotonin in the cleft and also dampens the negative feedback loop further.   In a few of the reviews I read, the suicide-risk claims and the worsening that is experienced by some SSRIs seemed really inconclusive. Some of the methodologies used by the papers were questioned. An example I can think of clearly from one review was that one of the qualifiers for an ""adverse psychological effect"" in one of those papers had listed a standard physiological side effect as one of them, which in most pharmapsychology papers they wouldn't do normally. Another thing was when they broke it down by age, it seemed this effect wasn't seen as heavily in 25+ yr old group but it was modesty observed in the younger groups (13-25 yr old, IIRC). But they also did not like they sort of cherry picked the set of data they took this from too. Either way, reading these reviews educated me a bit! Especially the inflammation theory of depression (and with 5-HT having anti-inflammatory properties).  Maybe the worsening that happens to some users is the negative feedback loop developing and then dampening? That period isn't stable neurochemically and probably could explain the psychological effects and why as the drug administration continues long-term, there is stabilization and improvement.  If you want any of the reviews I read, I can just send you the names and you can look them up or I can PM a Dropbox link with some PDFs."
neuro,3adyyy,owatonna,5,Sat Jun 27 00:15:14 2015 UTC,"I am wondering when researchers are going to drop the simplistic thinking that mental illnesses are caused by high/low neurotransmitter levels. It is obviously wrong in the general case. And if it were true, it is exceedingly clear that you cannot directly alter neurotransmitter levels in the brain in any sort of effective manner. The brain does not allow it."

neuro,3adyyy,owatonna,3,Fri Jun 19 16:14:27 2015 UTC,"It's not a prevailing belief among researchers, more so with laymen than anywhere else.   That is not true, but I know what you are getting at. Yes, low serotonin = depression is no longer a prevailing belief among researchers. But they still seem to base a lot of research on the idea that they can ""figure out"" a mental illness by looking at neurotransmitter levels. There are still researchers who believe schizophrenia is ""high dopamine"" even though that is ridiculous. Just look at this study: people with social anxiety have ""high serotonin"". Yeah, maybe. In this one context studied here, unlikely to be replicated elsewhere. It's a total dead end.  This obsession with neurotransmitters boils a complex process (human thinking) into a very simplistic explanation. It's tempting because it is easily understood, but it's totally wrong.   The low serotonin = depression et al. talk also serves as a convenient and simple way to explain [most] antidepressants to patients. Like most analogies, it's useful to an extent, but not completely accurate.   That does not seem like a useful explanation to me, but rather fraud. A useful explanation would be one that is grounded in reality or has some evidence to back it up. If there is no such evidence, then admitting ""we don't know"" is the only appropriate response. What is not appropriate is giving an explanation that is disproven simply because it is easy for people to understand and it achieves the end result of getting people to take their meds without asking questions. That sounds an awful lot like criminal abuse. A doctor giving the low serotonin theory to a patient (which is still done regularly) is a lot like explaining crop circles by saying they are made by alien visitors: we know it's not true, but hey, people can understand that, so it's okay. Except that providing a false explanation for crop circles does not potentially endanger someone the way that a prescription drug with serious side effects does."
neuro,3adyyy,danyquinn,3,Fri Jun 19 16:24:45 2015 UTC,"I agree.  At best, it's oversimplification to the point of inaccuracy, and more of the time, it's just inaccurate.

neuro,3adyyy,owatonna,7,Fri Jun 19 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"I like to think of the brain this way. Imagine you have never studied anything about computers. You have no idea how they work. And someone puts a supercomputer in front of you and says ""Figure out how it works"". But you are not allowed to take it apart or open it at all, except when the computer has died and no longer works. You must figure out what is going on by measuring indirect temperature and electrical changes coming from each part. Oh, and you can scan inside it, but the scans will only show you very broad information (""area X lights up, area Z is dark""). Now imagine there are millions of these supercomputers, and while they all work in similar ways, they have quite a few differences. After you study that computer, how much faith would you have in your description of how it works?"
neuro,3adyyy,x_plorer2,2,Fri Jun 19 19:30:43 2015 UTC,"Agree. Though I do wonder sometimes if such an approach will delineate a physical basis for a persons propensity towards negative or positive symptoms and if this basis may be modified.   Obviously we can't boil something like a social phobia down to a molecule or group of molecules but I wonder if, say local activation of a particular circuit as function of broken neurological homeostasis or some polymorphic receptor may be associated with the auditory hallucinations seen in some individuals but not others. Then we might say ""No this intervention won't supersede the lifetime of conditioning that resulted in this anxiety but it will directly prevent you from hallucinating on account of it."" Or something along those lines. Of course we do see improvement in some people with different classes of drugs but as you mentioned this is a poorly aimed shotgun approach with only weakly repeatable results."
neuro,3adyyy,owatonna,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:04:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, interesting comments. I think one of the problems right now is that somewhere along the lines we decided we know a lot about the brain and somewhere this translated into an arrogance that we know everything or we know enough to manipulate it without consequence. I think it is becoming increasingly clear that we know way less than we think we know.   Of course we do see improvement in some people with different classes of drugs but as you mentioned this is a poorly aimed shotgun approach with only weakly repeatable results.   Yes, but do we? Antipsychotics work not by actually treating a problem, but by disabling it. And even that result is being challenged. As people like Peter Gotzsche have noted, the evidence base for the effectiveness of antipsychotics even in the short run is shockingly weak. And in the long run it is clear they are harmful. And that is supposedly the drug class with the most evidence of efficacy."

We do see improvement though as you know its symptom relief. Generally I haven't seen antipsychotics used for social anxiety so I can't comment on that. SSRI/SNRI are typically first line and in some instances short term use of benzodiazepines is helpful.  Again I fully agree that we're barking up the wrong tree if we're looking at reducing the outcome of lifelong processes interacting with thought patterns, genes, comorbid conditions, etc. with just a quick neurotransmitter readjustment.   That said (and I guess for any readers with less background) we do understand some aspects of the brain and within those aspects we can use our shotguns with sound rationale to help people survive. It may be different in places like the US (not sure) but when people are given meds for SAD its because they're starving themselves because they can't go to the grocery store or losing their job because they're having panic attacks at work. Sometimes they can't get their kids to school, sometimes they can't even make it out to their therapist or doctor. In most instances there's a huge pile of baggage to work through before their thought patterns start to improve but in the meantime they can't starve/lose their job/have someone else suffer which is where short-term meds are helpful."

How is it that SSRIs became first line treatment for anxiety when all the original Phase III trials showed that SSRIs generated enormous anxiety and agitation in something like 20% of patients. So much that they had to give them benzodiazepines to keep them from dropping out of the trials. Given this, who then thought it would be a great idea to give these drugs to people with anxiety and how the hell did this ever get to be a thing? Is this not the most obvious example of a drug acting as a placebo? We have clear proof that this drug can generate anxiety, yet it is given as anti-anxiety medication. Sounds nuts to me.  And what is the evidence base for SSRI use for anxiety. What studies do people use to justify it? I always wondered about this and never could find good credible information.

Haven't seen the 20% thing before but would be interested to see. I've generally seen around 10% for anxiety from SSRIs which is obviously not good in anxiety patients. I would guess that the justification would be that they're already anxious so its not like they're adding anything and generally within that 10% it tapers away after the first two weeks and that's the cost. The benefit would be having a higher chance relative to placebo to increase their ability to function with the goal being to get their shit together and make progress with therapy in the interim."

neuro,3adyyy,x_plorer2,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:25:17 2015 UTC,I actually think they may work for anxiety for some people in the short term.   I don't think the efficacy is controversial either in terms of the evidence or the rationale given our present understanding of the brain and behaviour. Certainly not perfect though but again these are people who need months of therapy and probably a several social interventions but they're usually in a predicament that most people couldn't imagine by the time they show up to the Emergency Department.  I'd look at like someone who gets mugged. A trauma workup isn't going to improve their neighbourhood or get them a ride so they don't have to walk alone at night but it'll get em through the next little while so they and those around them can sort the rest out.   Anyways I feel like we got off topic. My hope would be that with enough understanding of the brain we might avoid what I'll call the abnormal aspects of anxiety like hearing voices or seeing things while working out the underlying issues that result in a generally-beneficial emotional state that we evolved.

The Italian surgeon who claims he's going to try it offers no solutions to this, as if he's not even conceptually aware of the problem. I've never heard of any research or technology that solves this problem. And this is ignoring the ""lesser"" problems such as rejection by the immune system.  If there's ever a day where a successful head transplant is done on an animal, then we might be justified in thinking it could be done in a human. The surgeon says it was successfully done on a rhesus monkey in the 70's so therefore should be possible in humans, though the monkey needed to stay on a ventilator because the brain couldn't control the lungs, and it died after 10 days by immune system rejection. The only things the transplanted monkey could do were things like smell, see, taste - things that didn't require any cut/reconnecting of nerves. Essentially, the only function the new body performed was to deliver blood to the brain.  I've never heard any neuroscientist say that this plan is feasible."

neuro,3acn2j,ennervated_scientist,-2,Fri Jun 19 03:41:41 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. You should read about Hormesis.  Exercise is a great example for Hormesis. Exercise tears your muscle tissues, releases free radicals and leads to oxidative stress. Yet, why is it so good?  The principle is in the frequency/dosage. Exposing your body to exercise puts it into stress and some systems get damaged. But if you don't do it too much, your homeostatic mechanisms will start to over-compensate for the minor damage the exercise has done!  The meaning is that with the right levels of exercise, exercise causes just a minor damage, and the body immediately responds by making itself less vulnerable to that kind of damage.   Exercise causes oxidative stress, yet regular exercise provides protection against oxidative stress. Why is that? It's because regular exercise (not too much) causes just a little bit of oxidative stress. The body's repair mechanisms are able to overcome this stress and over time, and you get less prone to oxidative stress.  Too much exercise, however, can be damaging. If exercise was a drug, then we could have said that low doses are beneficial and high doses are not.  Which leads to my point - activities like exercise and intermittent fasting have been shown to increase neurogenesis!  Even more amazingly, Methamphetamine, which is neurotoxic to dopamine neurons in high doses, has been to shown be neuroprotective in low doses! Rats that have gotten a Traumatic Brain Injury and were treated with low-dose Methamphetamine within 12 hours had less inflammation and apoptosis than the control group. Moreover, treatment with low-dose Methamphetamine was shown to cause a significant enhancement in learning and memory in rats, suggesting increased neurogenesis/neuroplasticity.  Methamphetamine leads to dopamine neuron death in high doses, yet in low doses it can increase neuroplasticity! So wouldn't you say that it has the potential to increase neurogenesis?  There are many more examples like this."

That's a wild conclusion.   Methamphetamine leads to dopamine neuron death in high doses, yet in low doses it can increase neuroplasticity!   Yes, because it augments a number of neurotransmitter systems... that has no bearing on neurogenesis.   So wouldn't you say that it has the potential to increase neurogenesis?   It may in some situations, but it's going to be hippocampal. There are not native stem cell populations in those other areas... hence no neurogenesis.  Also, just because there's a cognitive benefit doesn't mean there's neurogenesis... There's still conflict as to the specific involvement of adult neurogenesis in most things it's implicated in...  You've just presented some corrolary data points and said ""oh yeah, neurogenesis.""  There's an easy way to assay for neurogenesis.

Even if it isn't neurogenesis, it shows that the brain has a good recovery capability and that new connections can be made to compensate for the neuron loss.  But there are some types of brain damage that might involve neuron loss and unlike TBI/Stroke, they are mostly irreversible.  Tardive Dyskinesia (I made a few posts about it a while back) is an illness characterized by loss of motor control over muscle movements. It is thought to involve neuron death, and it is permanent in most cases. It's weird because the brain should make new neural connections to compensate for the neuron death that occurred after chronic anti-psychotics administration.  So this whole subject is complicated, and it seems that in some cases, neuron loss matters more than overs. As I said, TBI/Stroke patients can make great recoveries from the damage, but it seems that in certain illnesses such as Tardive Dyskinesia the brain, for some reason, not recover much."

It is one of the most recently evolved parts of the human brain, that undergoes an extremely prolonged period of maturation that lasts until adulthood.  DLPFC is not an anatomical structure, but rather a functional one. This region lies in the middle frontal gyrus of humans (i.e., lateral part of Brodmann's area (BA) 9 and 46  and in macaque monkeys, this region is around the principal sulcus (i.e., in Walker's area 46  ).   Other sources consider that DLPFC is attributed anatomically to BA 9 and 46  and BA 8, 9 and 10.  DLPFC is connected to the orbitofrontal cortex, and to a variety of brain areas, which include the thalamus, parts of the basal ganglia (specifically, the dorsal caudate nucleus), the hippocampus, and primary and secondary association areas of neocortex, including posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital areas.  Also, DLPFC is the end point for the dorsal pathway (stream) that tells the brain how to interact with the stimuli. On the other hand, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (located more inferior/ventral to DLPFC) is the end point of the ventral pathway (stream) that brings information about the stimuli’s characteristics.  An important function of the DLPFC is the executive functions, such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning, inhibition, and abstract    Image i - An illustration of brain's prefrontal region     Relevant: Brodmann area 46 | Mesocortical pathway | Posterior parietal cortex   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

neuro,3aa65v,roland00,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:45:38 2015 UTC,"To be reductionist working memory kinda works like sonar or echolocation.  Your body needs constant rehearsal for it does not have any permanent storage with working memory, instead the process of using the nerves as a network is what the working memory is.  It is not like a computer cache system with a set dedicated area, but instead more of a wave based system with specific neurons being specific locations and the use of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, gaba, dopamine, etc to to shape what is stored in the working memory buffer. It is both chemicals (neurotransmitters) and electrical signals that work together to create working memory. Here is one of the first papers where we started to truely understand working memory, 1995 Dr. Patrica Goldman-Rakic Cellular basis of working memory  Pretty much everything before hand was more of a model theory base, but with that paper we started to get into how these systems actually work.  So instead of seeing working memory as a static thing with specific  areas Instead working memory is form of spatial electrical disturbance, it fires the synapses of the nerve cells and depending on how the brain ""shapes"" the function the brain can remember what is happening.  This is why you need constant rehearsal with working memory, and also things like neurotransmitter depletion are a big deal.  Do not have the neurotransmitters to feed this cycle for your are cognitively exhausted and your working memory will be poor.  It also explains why specific neurotransmitters are a big deal.  Your brain uses the d1 dopamine receptor to ""shape"" the signal generated by the pyramid cells, too much d1 receptor and your brain overshapes the primary signal, eliminating too much distractions, too little and you can't stay focused or store things in working memory for you have only chaos.  That said there are many other neurotransmitter receptors subtypes involved with working memory such as the alpha 2a which promotes working memory by strengthening the signal, and the alpha 1 which purposefully disrupts the frontal lobe aka the slow brain so the you use the much faster emotional and posterior brain to make decisions during stressful fight or flight reactions, Norepinephrine and adreanline control alpha 1 and alpha 2 receptors.  Certain subtypes of the acetylcholine and serotonin receptors also influence working memory, as well as many neuromodulators in addition to various neurotransmitters.   Stress  often makes working memory harder, but a small amount of stress in a controlled situation may actually help working memory for a limited time.  This is one of the reasons why it is easy to use certain brain regions but it is very hard to use certain parts of the frontal lobe.  Other brain regions do not need neurotransmitters as much to properly function, while the prefrontal areas of the frontal lobe are very sensitivity to bottlenecks such as the amount of neurotransmitters and cerebral blood flow and gluclose utilization.  Using the prefrontal cortex in a sustained fashion is ego depleting.  The more you use the working memory system in a burst fashion without a time to relax the more drained you get.  This is one of the reasons why often you perform better with short breaks during cognitively demanding tasks to give your brain time to reset and get ready for the next hard utilization    Now as for locations of working memory you use a lot of the frontal lobe but also some other areas for working memory.  I have several books about this on my computer but I am not going to look for them for that is organized chaos and it is hard to remember this was in this exact book in this exact chapter, etc.  Just use that article I linked to earlier and then use the pubmed database or google scholar and look for review articles that cite that article.  One thing you need to understand have different ""styles"" of working memory depending on the region.   Their is a rostal caudal organization of working memory as well as a dorsal / ventral organization of workng memory.  Working memory does different things in different brain regions, think of it as a hierarchy, dedicated specialists to focus on this issue, while other brain regions are focused on the application of that goal. Area 10 is often called the anterior prefrontal cortex.  It is one of the brain areas greatly enhanced in humans compared to other apes/hominids. Area 10 area is more of the ""goal holding"" and ""prospective/intention"" memory.  Prospective / Intention memory is remembering to remember.  It is you remember at the start of the day this is your wife's and yours anniversary and thus you need to pick up flowers on the way home, you then do not think about your anniversary all day for you are thinking about work, then this area is supposed to activate on the drive home so you are ready to deviate from the normal automatic thoughts of the day so you can make a special trip to the florist that you would not normally do.  Think of BA10 as the system level memory understanding how the world works and where you store temporary information that is critical for mission success.  It is the memory area that is focused on the ""big picture"" or ""the king on his iron throne"" while the other working memories are the servants trying to get king what he wants.  The more rostral you go the more specific brain cells get more complicated, but the more caudal you go the more they get specialized with working memory. Area 9/46 what most people consider the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is the cold cognitive computer, your mental playground where you come up with ideas on how to solve your goals.  You use this working memory to store information while this brain region and others move the pieces around in your mind and try new combinations and new possibilities.  This is the strategic area of working memory. The Posterior Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex is the tactical area of the working memory system.  Most neuroimanging studies place the frontal eye fields in this section of the frontal lobe.  In anxiety disorders, or just when you are more anxious your brain increases the activations in this brain area hoping to figure out a tactical way to resolve the problem.  The more practiced you get doing many types of skills the less you will see this brian region activate unless it is a complicated fashion that has to use the cognitive control part of the brain instead of the automatic.  This is also the area we start transitioning from feeding the frontal lobe through the dorstal striatum (caudate) to the dorsal striatum (putamen) or put another way switching from the association areas of the frontal lobe and starting the motor association cortex for we transition from abstract to starting to do. Brodmann area 6 is the premotor zone which is the part of the brain we store the sequence of movements which then other brain areas such as the motor area brodmann 4 will perform.  This is the part of the brain that remembers the sequence of steps such as I am going to turn the key, then change the gear settings of the clutch, then check your blind spots, followed by tapping the gas, followed by maneuvering out of the crammed space, etc. Brodmann area 4 is the primary motor cortex   Now I been talking a lot of the spatial working memory tasks for I went through the executive function areas of the prefrontal lobe which are more dorsolateral based which is more spatial based.  The working memory areas that are more auditory based are located in the, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex areas 44, 45, 47.  Now it is not all cut and dry this area is verbal and this area is spatial.  Another important thing between dorsal and ventral is the ventral has a higher emphasis in rhersal of information while the dorsal areas are more tied to cognitive flexibility.  You use more of the ventral areas to keep the goals in mind and the dorsal areas as figuring out how to achieve this stuff.  Also working memory is not limited to just the frontal lobe but uses the entire brain to some degree including parietal areas in combination with the prefrontal cortex.    In effect there is no cut in dry stuff with the brain where this area does this thing, instead think of the brain as a global system and brain areas work on a principle of a gradient    I am sorry if that is not the answer you want, it would be much simpler if I can point to an area like this is your working memory like this area is the caspian sea on the map.  But if the brain worked like that then it would not be capable of being the most successful and efficient computer out there.  Someday we will get computers that are smarter at humans in some forms of abstract tasks for we will just overwhelm it with computational power.  We had a world winning chess computer in the late 90s, We are starting to get there with image recongition, and we just had watson with jepoardy.  Humans by contrast will be better at the game GO for a very long time for there are order of magnitude more theoretical calculations you have to do vs chess or another game.  But even when a computer cluster will be stronger at abstract thinking you have to understand that the human brain does this in a system measured in watts.  While the computer cluster will be measured in to do these calculations will be measured in millions of watts.  See scientific american on this subject.  It is literally a different style of thinking compared to a computer with cache and such."

Having faster conduction velocities would have a clear benefit in terms of reaction times, but it would be a huge leap to assume that this would make the animal ""super-smart"" - beyond a certain point, reducing latency probably has diminishing returns in terms of the speed of neural computation, since synaptic delay etc. will become rate-limiting factors.  For the additional cost in terms of packing space and energy consumption that ""myelination + fat axons"" would incur, it probably makes much more evolutionary sense to pack in more neurons instead."

Action potentials, die to the mechanisms behind them, have about a 1 millisecond speed limit, or an extreme upper limit of 1000/second. As the potential is travelling through the axon, the only issue I could see is that the potential could move past the ion channels within the nodes of Ranvier before adequate charge could move into the cell to propagate the charge, so it would slowly begin to dissipate the longer the axon was.   Anyone feel free to correct this if I've said anything wrong."

There are a few scenarios where one might expect to see some benefit from increasing conduction velocity, faster reaction times being the most obvious example. Another possibility is that reducing the latency of long-range connections would allow neurons in more distal brain areas to synchronize their activity, thus allowing larger ensembles of neurons to be recruited for some computational task.  However, it's very unlikely that faster conduction would inevitably lead to faster computations. Within local cortical circuits, the axons are so short that conduction delay doesn't contribute appreciably to the latency with which information can be passed between neurons (a typical EPSP latency between two L2/3 pyramidal cells in mouse barrel cortex is about a millisecond, which is almost entirely due to synaptic delay rather than conduction delay)."

So, even if self-awareness isn't a binary property, it may not be necessarily linked with higher abstract thinking."
neuro,3a1zi0,protestor,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:34:14 2015 UTC,"Seems like a problem with the term, ""self awareness"". Such a loosely defined concept is hard to prove and observe. Lots of interpretations."
neuro,3a1zi0,covertc,4,Wed Jun 17 05:43:03 2015 UTC,"Do we have another term though?  It seems to me that biomedical researchers want to have their cake and eat it: at the same time that they emphasize that their animal models are sufficiently close to humans to not make medical research with them useless, they also want to assert that whatever differences between humans and non-humans are enough to dismiss ethical concerns regarding animal experimentation.  Which isn't to say that ethics isn't taken seriously, a lot of things have changed in the past decades. I've a professor that is completely against doing random LD50 studies that kill a lot of animals needlessly, but he has no qualms about removing the brain of mice in order to study it, and emphasize that this practice approved by the appropriate ethics committee and such. Studies he wouldn't ever do in humans.  So perhaps there is a great interest in keeping ""self-awareness"" as loosely defined as possible, because researches don't like to think about themselves as monsters and such."
neuro,3a1zi0,protestor,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:29:55 2015 UTC,Very true. I think this human self awareness thing is a relict from times there the mind was subject to religion and philosophy. Think of Descartes arguments that the mind arises from a spiritual entity.  Contrary to that not a single child would doubt that mammals are self aware.
neuro,3a1zi0,Mrbumby,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:41:16 2015 UTC,"This news article about the study is useless in my opinion, not saying the study is useless.  The term self awareness has many definitions and as /u/kyleclements mentions even a single definition may consist of very large gradients.  Because of this many different  readers may read the same article and yet they project their own definitions onto the words and thus any ""real"" discussion / debate will likely occur with participants talking past each other debating very different concepts yet thinking they are debating the same thing.  Thus such a news article needs to define its terms if it wants to be useful, else it is just ""filler"" fancy words but not useful and possessing no substance.         Mice may posses a future self when it comes to stimulus response and they are aware how their present actions can cause lasting effects on their future self.  Yet a mouse capability to formulate action outcomes is far more limited some say nonexistent but a more accurate definition is that it is on a completely different scale and is orders of magnitude less capable than primates let alone humans.  Thus a mouse self awareness is fundamentally limited.  Its long term hippocampual memory system is very similr to humans but the rest of the neocortex much more basic.  You need a far more developed association cortex in a mouse to feed the hippocampus.  Thus the goal directed ageny a mouse can do is far more reactive as well as present bound while humans are capable actors and can be proactive in the present and future selves."

The differences between moral cognition and say social cognition are probably very blurred, if they exist at all, on a chemical level.

Firstly the term ""Moral Dilemma"" is ambiguous... how is it different from any Dilemma (literally: a situation where you have to make a difficult choice)... perhaps the stakes may be higher in the external world, so it triggers more emotional / social circuits while contemplating your options.   I would suggest that working through a moral dilemma is no different from working through any problem... where your normal analytical circuits in their normal chemical fashion go through all the different ins and outs of the problem, contemplating the pros and cons of different approaches, all informed by your memories of past social interactions and other social learning."

neuro,39tmcg,roland00,2,Sun Jun 14 21:15:11 2015 UTC,"There are about a billion fucking factors going into a ""moral dilemma"". Each neuron in your brain encodes some aspect or factor of something that you either directly experience, or ""dream up"" in your head. These neurons use a wide variety of chemicals and neurotransmitters, but they aren't really super relevant in the way you're expecting. They are just a substrate upon which the networks of your brain are built on.  To answer your question in another manner, your moral dilemma is essentially various networks of neurons (where each network's neurons are connected to each other somehow) vying for final say in the decision you make, or what you decide to believe. Chemically, one choice is almost identical to any other, and you really can't discriminate the decisions you will make based on chemical concentrations. However, if you were to map out the specific levels of neurotransmitters at every single synapse, then you could possibly determine each set of morals competing for dominance, and observe which gets picked as ""champion"" or ""correct"".  TL;DR The brain is a mess, a beautiful fucking mess."
neuro,39tmcg,roland00,2,Mon Jun 15 00:31:46 2015 UTC,"Here is a story example people can understand for the story of this character is global enough most people are familiar with him.  Even though this is a fantasy story character it does happen in real life as well.  Are you familiar with the batman villain two-face?  A man who use to be an outstanding citizen a moral crusader, a DA that fights the mob and works for the betterment of mankind.  There has been numerous retellings of his story throughout the 70 years of his character history.  That said practically all of them is he is injured by acid by a mobster, or he is kidnapped/threatened and then due to a chemical or gasoline explosion his face is burned and he suffers blunt tramua.  Well dozens of brain areas are tied to morality in some degree, and it is these brain areas working together as a team like an orchestra with multiple instruments that yields a ""composite morality."" Picture of the many brain regions from the neuroscience journal  Now you see two brain areas, the left is the ""outside of the brain, the outside of the sphere that is the brain"", the lateral brain.  The one on the right is the ""inside of the brain"" the areas between the left and right halfs, the midline or medial area.  Now on both brains there is an an area in the frontal lobe right above the eyes.  On the lleft picture that shows the outside/ateral area this is called the orbital prefrontal cortex labeled OFC, on the right picture the midline/medial brain there is the ventromedial prefrontal cortex labeled VMPFC.     Now these brain regions do slightly different things but they work together as a team in making decisions and both them work together for processing decisions of morality but also other forms of evaluation of options..  Together they allow you to evaluate the consequences of your actions.  Other brain regions help you understand what happens on an abstract level, but these brain regions help you understand which is better or worse of the consequences.  In other words it is the brain regions that decide cheesecake is better than bread, or a million dollars is better than 2 dollars.  Other brain regions may understand the spatial significance that A is more than B but this is the brain region implicated in choice that bigger is better, or less is better in this specific circumstance.  This is also the brain region implicated in integrating multiple types of differing traits between two objects.  The part that allows you to see a human being as a composition, a person who is gray and is capable of both good and evil and is not a pure thing that is purely one or the other.  This is also the same brain areas that deal with impulsivity and whether you make an decision without thinking through the consequences based on previous value decisions, or the first value representation that comes to mind before you have time to think through the consequences.  It is also the brain region dealing with compulsivity and start and stopping behavior based off predetermine value decisions.  Compulsivity is when the automatic almost unconscious brain makes a decision and the rational slow cognitive brain can't stop the automatic almost unconscious brain, or the automatic unconscious brain activates too fast the conscious brain can't stop it in time.  You can say that impulsivity and compulsivity are almost the exact same thing, but only slightly different.  Like the sides of a coin, the coin does not have a top and bottom, a prime and an inferior.  No both sides are equally of importance, both sides are the face.  The coin has no ultimate master, when land face up onside is the  temporary face and the other is his mate, but ultimately what is top and bottom is only position not opposites in extremes, but opposites in position.        Because Harvey Dent/Two Face has suffered brain damage to this area he now has a form of behavior where he can understand consequences but he finds it difficult almost impossible to chose between two decisions, he can not evaluate which consequence is better than the other.     Thus he gives up his own personal choice and free will and as a compulsion just like an OCD person he uses a compensatory strategy to reduce the anxiety of the situation.  He makes decisions by subletting his will to the will of the coin.  Heads or Tails, Good or Evil.  Two Face can do planning and problem solving for that is a different part of the frontal lobe (more of the DLPFC and the Middle Frontal Gyrus in that picture, not shown in the picture but it is near that middle frontal gyrus is the premotor area, where you convert ideas into steps of behavior to achieve those ideas)   Harvey Dent/Two Face now also does not see the world in shades of grey anymore, everything is either black or white, good or evil.  Nuance is now harder for Harvey Dent for Nuance determines making value judgements on what is better and worse, to separate the chaos of an infinite possibilities to create an internal story, an internal dialogue, a persona, a face and then telling that story even if that story has multiple layers and dimensions and masks. Two Face also now has a high need for symmetry and sameness thus his obsession with the number two, and with balancing things.  The brain is hardwired to prefer symmetry probably on the genetic level in the aspects of a complicated world for often symmetry leads to things such as a selection of a better mate.  This is because things such as facial symmetry has many genetic and epigenetic factors (environment influencing genetics) and often a more symmetrical body is a sign of a healthy body that is better able to regulate and fine tune itself.  Now you can choose against symmetry, you can inhibit with your rational mind the automatic impulse or compulsivity your emotional mind demands but this requires the brain to use these OFC and VMPFC brain areas correctly. In one story they tried to rehabilitate Two Face by giving him more options to make a decision replacing a black / white 2 option coin with a six sided die, and then eventually a deck of cards, a tarot deck with 72 options.  They hoped by giving Two Faces more options, he will start to create an internal story, an internal dialogue and in the process reduce the need of a external decision making device to make moral judgements.  Ultimately this fails, what happened was Two-Face became anxious and overwhelmed by the possibilities and mentally shut down, similar to the learned helplessness you can instill in humans and animals by create adversity that is chronic no matter what the person does, and thus they choose no action to try to escape the pain.   This is the exact same thing that happens when you give too many choices to a human being when they are tired or stressed.  Or when you give too many choices to a person who has suffered brain damage such as a concussion or a stroke to this region.  Give them 30 choices on where to eat dinner and they can not make a decision if they are tired or stress or if they suffered brain damage.  If they do make a choice it is not a rational reasoned choice but instead a choice on impulse like picking the first option you give them.  This is because using the OFC and VMPFC is cognitively demanding, will depleteing, and ego depleting wiki on this this is due to evolution and bottolenecks of evolution.  The frontal lobe is a new brain area and when this area is stressed your brain can nout fuel it with enough energy and other resources so your brain adapts and does nothing, or it emotionally escalates and activates a new form of arrousal such as the fight or flight mode and it uses the emotional brain to make decisions for it can't figure out all the possibilities and thus it uses impulses and stereotypes and predetermined prejudices to make its decision.  You might choose pizza not because you want pizza now, but because you liked pizza in the past and you can't figure out what you truly want right now.    Two Face is still a human being, and he still has components of morality like understanding good and evil even if he now has problems with choosing good and evil.  Two-Face also still experiences pain and joy, he just has less agency in making pain and joy occur in his life by the outcomes of his decisions.  He is still human, but he is different than before.  There will be a followup post on a real life example of Two Face caused by a head injury.  The case of Phineas Gage a man who suffered brain damage due to a head injury during the construction of a railroad system."
neuro,39tmcg,autowikibot,2,Mon Jun 15 04:07:38 2015 UTC,"A famous example of a ""modern two face"" is the case of Phineas Gage, one of the most studied men in all of psychology.  Now Phineas Gage is a little different than Two Face for Two Face is a fantasy construct which may have slightly different brain injuries in certain parts of the frontal lobe while Phineas Gage is a specific person with specific injuries.  Phineas Gage suffered a head injury due to an explosion and accident involving the construction of a railroad (I am purposefully leaving out details for it is gross).  Phineas Gage suffered mass brain damage, almost all of it on the left side of the frontal lobe, though some minor right side may have occurred as well.  Damaging both the OFC and the VMPFC but also other areas.  Phineas Gage went from a person who was described as the most ""hard working"" individual in the camp, loved by all, and highly responsible.  He became sociopathic soon after his injury and recovery doing lots of decisions on impulse and  not without regards to the consequences, he routinely insulted people, and was found disagreeable, and dislike by practically everyone.  Now this is the first hand accounts that were written in things such as diararies.  Phineas Gage also became kinda of a celebrity so other stories have been told that he became sexually promiscuous in talk but little actual action, a drunkard, and other comments.  We can't tell if these second hand comments are people being more honest for they did not have to worry about offending Phineas feelings or the memory of the former Phineas or if they are myths like the story of werewolves.  Regardless over the remaining 12 years of Phineas life his personality once again began to change and he became more ""normal"" not necessary the same personality he had before the accident, but he was less extreme than what he used to be and was fitting better in with society.  This is probably because that Phineas had the other half of his frontal lobe relatively intact and thus Phineas brain start to rewire itself creating new synapses on the right half which the left half used to do some of the task, but also of nonbiological compensatory strategies.  Phineas understood a lot of morality and socetiy and began to change his behavior on the margins, for even if he could not make the same type of decisions he used to, he purposefully tried to create situations where he was not needed to make such decisions.  Thus Phineas Gage changed professions and lived a highly structured life as a stage coach driver.  The type of choices he had to make on a daily basis were much the same, one day did the same type of tasks as the other days, lots of tasks working with his hands and having immediate and more important predictable and natural consequences.  Phineas appeared to ""prosper"" despite his injury, until he started experiencing seizures due to his head injury and ultimately the seizures caused him to be unable to work, and he died during a seizure fit that lasted several minutes.  Note it is the seizures that killed Gage not the changes in personality and morality.  Furthermore Phineas was beginning to adapt and prosper despite the head injury.  Head Injuries are not black and white, many people do recover despite how nasty head injuries can be."
neuro,39tmcg,roland00,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:07:44 2015 UTC,"Ego depletion:       Ego depletion refers to the idea that self-control or willpower draw upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be used up.  When the energy for mental activity is low, self-control is typically impaired, which would be considered a state of ego depletion. In particular, experiencing a state of ego depletion impairs the ability to control oneself later on. A depleting task requiring self-control can have a hindering effect on a subsequent self-control task, even if the tasks are seemingly unrelated. Self-control plays a valuable role in the functioning of the self on both individualistic and interpersonal levels. Ego depletion is therefore a critical topic in experimental psychology, specifically social psychology, because it is a mechanism that contributes to the understanding of the processes of human self-control.

I'm on my phone so can't cite papers, but do a Google scholar search for ""bilingualism and inhibitory control"" and you'll probably find a lot of literature on it. The reasoning behind that is that bilinguals constantly have to inhibit one language while speaking the other.

In addition, if you plan on doing a PhD after your masters, if you do not commit academic incest, it is likely that your classes taken during your masters will have to be taken over again for your PhD.

neuro,39or8q,bloobloopeapod,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:24:41 2015 UTC,"In the US, PhD programs do give out masters degrees, but that only if you drop out of the PhD program (while also completing at least a year, sometimes more depending on the program). So, in most cases, if you only wanted the masters, you would have to apply to the PhD program, make it seem as if you actually want to get the PhD, get the masters, and then drop out.   As bloobloopeapod said, a lot of masters credits wont transfer, so if you want a PhD, it's likely better to apply out of undergrad, as opposed to getting a masters first."
neuro,39or8q,39nx3v,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:32:55 2015 UTC,"It's different depending on where you are from.   For example, in Neuroscience, if you attend Canadian or European schools, you have to complete an MSc before continuing towards a PhD. So you have to get an MSc and theoretically reapply to a PhD program.  In American schools, you get a ""masters in philosophy"" once one advances to PhD candidacy, but there's no terminal degree, except for your PhD. So you can go straight from a BS or BA to a PhD in 5 + or - years.   Of course, there are advantages and disadvantages to getting a masters before doing a PhD if that's your advance degree plan. That's why I've seen it as disadvantageous because the students in my cohort who hold a masters separate to their PhD talk about the problems more than the benefits."
neuro,39nx3v,Swobu,3,Sat Jun 13 02:47:28 2015 UTC,"want to work in neuroscience   I think the key to your questions is the word ""work"".  In my opinion, no career in true science is work (in the standard sense). Well, we all must earn a living somehow, and it's possible to pursue true science and make a living, but you shouldn't do it for the money (because there's little to be made), and you shouldn't look at is a job (because the demands are far different than a typical job). I hope that whether or not you agree with my opinion, you'll read on - and I'll try to give advice separate from this belief.   I think there is very little neuroscience research being done by companies (a few private institutes, not companies, are the exception). Pharmaceutical companies have ""neuroscience"" divisions, but most of that work is drug discovery and drug testing on animal models (as far as I understand). And that's not what neuroscience research is, to me. There are companies that hope to produce products (for health care, or entertainment) based in some part on findings from basic neuroscience research. It's unlikely the efforts of these companies are going to teach us much about the brain. But they may manage to bring products to market that will help people (maybe a non-invasive EEG-based headset for 2D computer cursor control), and working on something like that might be up your alley? If so, I would urge you to contact those companies directly - your background in mechanical engineering should be plenty to get started, and for that career track, I don't think a PhD program is as worthwhile as jumping right into the business 6 years earlier. If you want to do basic neuroscience research, realize that 99% is conducted at academic institutions (typically within research labs headed by a professor and containing a handful of postdocs, graduate students and lab techs). There are a few exceptions, such as the Allen Institute in the U.S.A. If you decide to go the academic track, apply to PhD programs this fall/winter, and find a lab that will let you volunteer over this summer and into the fall, so that you can get a recommendation and a feel for the work. Neuroscience is very broad and you may wish to volunteer in more than one lab to get a feel (human behavioral/fmri; rodent behavior; slice electrophysiology; anatomy; molecular/developmental stuff). As a Mech Eng, your skills may be very welcome in an electrophysiology lab, as these typically build custom ""rigs"" (aka microscopes, etc.) or behavioral apparatus. Count on ~6 years to get your PhD, then another ~5 years as a postdoc before you apply for faculty positions.   If the long academic track doesn't appeal to you, or if you'd like to gain some experience first, you could contact places like the Allen Institute, or Janelia Farm HHMI in the U.S.A., or Champalimaud, FMI, IST Austria, if you're in Europe. Large institutes often have a machine shop that is shared by many labs. Or if there's a particular niche in the field that appeals to you, try looking for companies that provide products either used in research in that field, or that are developing consumer products related to that field. Many of the companies that provide equipment to research labs are staffed with mechanical engineers, but also with former neuroscientists - and working there might be a way to get your feet wet, without committing to a PhD program just yet. Scientifica in the UK, Sutter Instruments in the U.S.A. are two examples, but there are probably thousands.   This will seem overwhelming at first, but check out the website for the ""Society for Neuroscience"" annual meeting, for prior years. You should be able to find a list of exhibitors (companies that set up stands to promote/sell their gear) and sponsors, but you can also look at ""poster abstracts"" submitted by tens of thousands of attendees.  Good luck!"

I guess I never saw money as an issue, I thought being on the cutting edge of science would clearly result in good compensation.   I know I do not want to go the academic track. What you mentioned in your second point sounds like something I'd enjoy though. Building/creating products based in neuroscience. I want to know more about that!  I am in the USA, and realistically I am not considering Europe.  Anyways, I will take some time and look into the places you mentioned! Thank you."
neuro,39nx3v,39nx3v,2,Sat Jun 13 05:53:59 2015 UTC,"You're very welcome. You should talk to others in the field, who may well have a different opinion.   I am definitely disappointed the money isn't there.   To perhaps clarify what I meant: the academic route is not gonna make you much money. Specifically, if you can get a position as a professor, you should make decent money, but you'll have spent >10 years making very little ($25-30k as a PhD student, $42k as a postdoc) before that. Most students won't end up with a professor position, though.   I thought being on the cutting edge of science would clearly result in good compensation   Not for academia in the U.S.A. But you don't want to go the academic route.   Maybe you could think about and write down what kind of things you find interesting? Why do you want to work in neuroscience? What do you find exciting? This may help to identify suitable career tracks.  If you start a successful company, or work your way up in a pharmaceutical company, or work your way up in a company making neuroscience-specific equipment, I imagine the pay opportunities are similar to any other technical field. It's just that there are very few neuroscience-related products at the moment, to the best of my knowledge.   I see neuroscience as a scientific frontier. And the scientific frontier is typically populated by academic scientists, with a sprinkling of industry. The federal government bankrolls basic science - companies rarely have the motivation/time/money to pursue research on the frontier, because the ""risks"" are so high. And by risk, I mean the fact that even when you discover or describe something new, there's no way to know if or when this new knowledge will have commercial potential. That's one reason why companies wait for taxpayer-funded academic research to figure out new stuff, in hopes that some of those research findings will translate into potential treatments for diseases, say, which the companies can then further refine, test, and bring to market.   If you are near a major research university, you could contact their office of technology licensing/transfer and inquire whether any of their neuroscience faculty have started any spin-off companies. Or whether any companies have licensed patents held by neuroscience faculty. That would give you some leads for companies where you could work or do an internship. When research faculty start spin-off companies, you might get your foot in the door that way.  Given your background, maybe start by looking for labs and companies doing brain-machine interface work? Or neural prosthetics? Or rehabilitation?"
neuro,39nx3v,39nx3v,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:51:46 2015 UTC,"Why do you want to work in neuroscience? What do you find exciting?   I have read maybe four books relating to neuroscience and the psychology of the human brain and they completely captured me. I just find the information fascinating!  This was the first book I read and one of my favorites. This is the book I am reading now and I can't put it down. So to answer your question I just love learning how the brain works and I think being able to build prosthetics that interface with the brain would be something that I'd enjoy.    Given your background, maybe start by looking for labs and companies doing brain-machine interface work? Or neural prosthetics? Or rehabilitation?   This pretty much hits the nail on the head. Brain-machine interface and neural prosthetics both get me excited!  Have you heard of the University of Rochester? From my little understanding they are a giant research institution (in my back yard). Maybe they do some type of neuroscience research, I am almost positive I have seen neuroscience articles on reddit from UofR.   This gives me a lot more to go on! I am going to reach out to someone at UofR, if they have a neuroscience department I will contact the department head."
neuro,39nx3v,Stereoisomer,2,Sat Jun 13 15:25:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with those books, myself.  I will note that neuroscience is a very broad field (more than any other field I've encountered), and if you're at one end of the spectrum (e.g. human psychology, like the second book) you are a long way from researchers at another part of the spectrum (e.g. gene regulation of CNS development; or synaptic physiology).  BMI/prosthetic research is an interesting niche. At the risk of oversimplifying, most people involved in BMI take an engineering approach: what can we do to/with the brain and body in order to solve this particular problem? Getting a particular device/system to work, or work better, takes precedence over understanding how/why the approach works, or how the underlying neural systems work.  There are exceptions, for example Krishna Shenoy's lab at Stanford: they have very nice BMI for monkeys, and are using the neural and behavioral data to try to understand how the brain represents certain intentions, the time scale of movement decisions, and more.  Fundamentally, we still have only limited access to the human brain, and slightly more to the non-human primate brain. This ""non-invasiveness"" is limiting. This is partly why many researchers who wish to dig deeper are using rodents: the availability of tools and methods for manipulating, at a genetic level, the intact rodent brain in such a way to either modify behavior, or trace connections, or monitor/modify neural activity, and so on.  I think the engineering approach is valuable, and can be very satisfying. But on the other hand, if you're someone who wants to really know how/why things work, it could be a bit frustrating, and a more basic science approach might be more suitable.   I don't know you, but it seems your interests are multi-dimensional: you have a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and you enjoy books about psychology/economics. One thing about neuroscience PhD programs is that from the 2nd year onwards, you will need to focus very much on one thing/subfield - partly because that's how labs and funding is structured, but also because the techniques are difficult and you have to develop a clear focus so that you can become good enough to complete the experiments properly (and it's hard to keep up with the literature in multiple areas).  I believe you can search the SfN abstracts and presentations by the affiliation (i.e. university) of the speakers/presenters, so maybe try that for UofR? And maybe Toronto-based institutions?  Good luck!"

Low-cost EEG devices of article  Electroencephalography:       Inexpensive EEG devices exist for the low-cost research and consumer markets. Recently, a few companies have miniaturized medical grade EEG technology to create versions accessible to the wider public. Some of these companies have even built commercial EEG devices retailing for less than $100 USD.   In 2004 OpenEEG released its ModularEEG as open source hardware. Compatible open source software includes a game for balancing a ball. In 2007 NeuroSky released the first affordable consumer based EEG along with the game NeuroBoy. This was also the first large scale EEG device to use dry sensor technology.  In 2008 OCZ Technology developed device for use in video games relying primarily on electromyography. In 2008 the Final Fantasy developer Square Enix announced that it was partnering with NeuroSky to create a game, Judecca.   In 2009 Mattel partnered with NeuroSky to release the Mindflex, a game that used an EEG to steer a ball through an obstacle course. By far the best selling consumer based EEG to date.   In 2009 Uncle Milton Industries partnered with NeuroSky to release the Star Wars Force Trainer, a game designed to create the illusion of possessing The Force.   In 2009 Emotiv released the EPOC, a 14 channel EEG device. The EPOC is the first commercial BCI to not use dry sensor technology, requiring users to apply a saline solution to electrode pads (which need remoistening after an hour or two of use).  In 2010, NeuroSky added a blink and electromyography function to the MindSet.  In 2011, NeuroSky released the MindWave, an EEG device designed for educational purposes and games.  The MindWave won the Guinness Book of World Records award for “Heaviest machine moved using a brain control interface”.  In 2011, Rhythmlink released Disposable WebbedTM EEG Electrodes, a flat, single-use EEG electrode. The Webbed Electrode provides a greater surface area to provide more area to be in contact with conductive material and a more comfortable experience for the patient. In 2012, a Japanese gadget project, neurowear, released Necomimi: a headset with motorized cat ears. The headset is a NeuroSky MindWave unit with two motors on the headband where a cat's ears might be. Slipcovers shaped like cat ears sit over the motors so that as the device registers emotional states the ears move to relate. For example, when relaxed, the ears fall to the sides and perk up when excited again. In 2014, OpenBCI released an eponymous Open Source brain-computer interface after a successful kickstarter campaign in 2013. The basic OpenBCI has 8 channels, expandable to 16, and supports EEG, EKG, and EMG. The OpenBCI is based on the Texas Instruments ADS1299 IC and the Arduino or PIC microcontroller, and costs $399 for the basic version. It uses standard metal cup electrodes and conductive paste.

You'd probably want to use a pre-trained neural network so would need about 10 to 20 baby volunteers to get the training data from.

If u do this outside an academic center it would be harder to set up your EEG and recruit volunteers. Once u obtain enough baby volunteers, probably would take anywhere from 1-6 months for a good data scientist to churn out something that works. If there are really strong signals or patterns u can key in on, then it won't take much time. It would take longer (months) or may be currently impossible to achieve, if its a weak signal/pattern.

What you are asking is currently a philosophical question that can't be addressed by neuropsych, as there isn't yet a good functional definition of what consciousness actually is (though not for lack of trying)  Philosophically, you can take one of two major stances:  (1)  You die every moment of every day - your discrete former self of a second ago is quantitatively and qualitatively different from you in the present.    (2)  So long as there is continuity, both physical and in memory, you are functionally the same person as you were a second ago.  It's the sense of continuity that counts.

Supersensitivity of D2 receptors (indirect pathway) can cause dyskinesia as the result of stimulation from endogenous levels of dopamine.  Blast those D2 receptors with a selective agonist (if you can even discover such a chemical scaffold with reasonable differences in potency/affinity), and you're only going to further increase the imbalance of activity between the direct and indirect pathways and exacerbate your movement disorders. For reference, look at L-DOPA induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's patients.    Realistically, you're going to want to mediate the stimulation and inhibition of both direct and indirect dopaminergic pathways.  Think back to pharmacology 101 - partial agonists can stimulate, but also act as antagonists depending on receptor activity.  I would place my bet on a partial dopamine agonist being a better mediator of dyskinesia than a receptor agonist."

Blasting the D2 receptors with a selective agonist should just cause them to downregulate, no? It's also a basic thing in pharmacology - continued stimulation results in blunted responses as the body adjusts to the stimuli (homeostasis).  D2 antagonists cause upregulation - D2 agonists cause downregulation, just the opposite effect.  And while D2 partial agonists may help treat TD, some of them, such as Aripiprazole, cause TD by themselves! Also, they do not permanently fix the sensitivity of the dopamine system.  So why wouldn't D2 agonists downregulate D2 receptors after repeated administration?   I also don't think L-DOPA is a good example for a dopamine agonist. It's a precursor to dopamine and it can build up in the body. I was referring to agonists like Apomorphine and d-Amphetamine (which is an indirect agonist). Apomorphine directly hits D2 receptors, so it might be a better example, in my opinion.  Have you checked out the paper I've linked? It says that a single dose of d-Amphetamine significantly reduced Haloperidol-induced D2 supersensitivity in mice! Isn't this a good example for why a dopamine agonist (Amphetamine is an indirect dopamine agonist) can help in TD by reducing sensitivity to dopamine?  If dopamine agonists cannot help, then how did Amphetamine reduced the sensitivity of the rats to dopamine after just one dose? The reduction in the dopamine sensitivity also lasted at least one week - it's probably permanent, which is a good thing.  TL;DR: If D2 agonists cause downregulation after repeated administration, why wouldn't they help treat Tardive Dyskinesia? If the problem in TD is upregulation in brain areas responsible for movement, why can't D2 agonists just down-regulate the receptors in these brain areas and then reduce the uncontrollable movements?"
neuro,39ax9o,AllostericAgonism,2,Wed Jun 10 20:30:08 2015 UTC,"Read your paper more carefully and critically.  It DOES say that a single dose of amphetamine significantly reduced haloperidol induced sensitivity.  But they're measuring associated behaviors on a relatively arbitrary scale for 2 minutes ever so often.  Even though the amphetamine treatment DOES cause a reduction, it does not ablate the effect, and only causes a slight change according to an associated behavior scale that ranges from 1-4.  The conclusions you're drawing from this very old paper are far too broad.  Tardive dyskinesia is not a simple disorder caused by only one thing.  Cells and receptor signaling are far more complex.  Yes, chronic receptor stimulation leads to desensitization.  That's ONE aspect. Can that desensitization realistically be applied to a treatment for tardive dyskinesia?  Very doubtful."
neuro,39ax9o,Xikkub,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"So, do you suggest that Tardive Dyskinesia is more than a supersensitivity of D2 receptors? Are there additional aspects to it?  For example, can neuron death in certain areas be another factor in Tardive Dyskinesia, in addition to D2 supersensitivity?   In other words - in your opinion, Tardive Dyskinesia is more complicated than just D2 supersensitivity and involves mechanisms that it is not 100% known how they work?"
neuro,39ax9o,AllostericAgonism,4,Wed Jun 10 21:57:31 2015 UTC,"It seems likely that there is more involved than just D2 supersensitivity given that TD persists for years after stopping use of dopamine antagonists. One alternative theory is that it could be due to GABAergic hypofunction in the striatum. But really we just don't know yet, the pathophysiology of TD is poorly understood."
neuro,39ax9o,AllostericAgonism,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:40:10 2015 UTC,"Neuron death sounds like a very logical theory, but can it just be that the D2 supersensitivity is permanent?  Maybe the upregulation of D2 receptors in the substantia nigra is permanent? The dopamine system is known to be very ""conservative"" about itself, and that's why we can see permanent changes in the sensitivity of the dopamine system in stimulant users.  Do you think that it might be possible that D2 supersensitivity is irreversible? Maybe the D2 receptors just ""refuse"" to downregulate after a certain point of using anti-psychotics?"
neuro,39ax9o,owatonna,3,Thu Jun 11 07:23:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  It's not a well understood phenomenon, but no problem is ever the result of just one aspect - it's a collection of multiple issues that result in a specific pathophysiology.  There's big money in the development of allosteric modulators to avoid exactly this problem."
neuro,39ax9o,owatonna,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, TD sounds more complicated than just supersensitivity, I agree.  But that raises 2 important questions:   Can't dopamine upregulation (D2 supersensitivity) be permanent? Maybe that neuroadaptation is irreversible? The dopamine system might just be overprotective and ""refuse"" to downregulate D2 receptors after some point of antipsychotic use, can't it? Is simple D2 antagonism enough to produce neurotoxicity? If all dopamine antagonists eventually cause Tardive Dyskinesia, and TD involves neuron death, then it must mean that D2 antagonism equals neuron death. But how is that possible? How can a simple antagonism of a receptor trigger neuron death? I would understand how GABA antagonism would lead to cell death (will lead to seizures that cause neuron death), for example, but is simple D2 antagonism enough to generate neurotoxicity?   Another point of view to look at is PTSD. PTSD patients don't have any brain damage - their sensitivity to serotonin just becomes imbalanced (upregulation of 5HT2 and downregulation of 5HT1A).  This is an example for a neuroadaptation that can be irreversible. If PTSD might be permanent, than it suggests that the change in the densities of the receptors is at least somewhat permanent.  So, cannot the upregulation of D2 receptors in a few brain areas just be irreversible? Like I said, we need to consider the option that the dopamine system is ""conservative"" to some degree, and might not downregulate for some reason.  It has been shown that presynaptic D2 agonism improves dyskinetic symptoms. Pre-synaptic D2 agonism inhibits DA synthesis, and it has been shown that it reduces TD symptoms. So this is also something to consider when mentioning neuron death - it might even be a combination of neuron death and D2 supersensitivity (do we know for sure if D2 upregulation is not permanent?)."
neuro,39ax9o,andy_v26,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:40:41 2015 UTC,"In regard to your first point; It's entirely possible that post-synaptic D2 upregulation is a permanent phenomenon, with a new level of homeostasis.  Though I would be skeptical of this, personally I would tend to believe that with time, receptor expression would return to ""normal"" levels after removal of the antipsychotic.  I believe that most patients that exhibit TD have been taking these medications for decades, so they're older.  It's likely difficult to measure the extinguishing of TD behaviors in an older population that is severely psychologically impaired.  Secondly, I would support that if you inhibit a receptor with enough affinity for a significant period of time, you could cause apoptosis.  D2 is Gi coupled, local inhibition of the various cyclase isoforms is going to alter activity of AMPK, PKA, and CREB (among others).  Phosphorylation could be a necessary pro-survival signal necessary for cell cycle progression or any other vital process.  I would also argue against your point that PTSD patients do not have brain damage.  We observe symptoms of PTSD in individuals that experience traumatic brain injury, and those without a specific physical trauma.  But both populations exhibit significant alterations in their brain chemistry, response to stimuli, sleep wake cycles, perception of threats and amygdala activity, dopaminergic/serotonergic signaling, etc. etc. etc.  Like I mentioned previously no disorder is the result of only one aspect, the pathophysiology results from a collection of different signals.  Change in 5HT receptor expression is only one itty-bitty-teeny-tiny piece of the puzzle.  Furthermore, cognitive behavioral therapy has had quite good results extinguishing PTSD in veterans and others subject to traumatic events.  This supports that these neurological changes are not static, but capable of change.  Can local receptor expression be changed ""permanently""?  Sure, look at long-term potentiation - that involves relatively stable changes in cell structure and receptor expression.  But even that isn't ""permanent"", it can still be altered over time.  Overall, I think it would be beneficial to take a step back when you're going at some of these problems, and understand that it's more complicated that just stimulating or inhibiting a specific pathway.  Attack the literature, the paper you cited was over 30 years old!  I imagine someone has asked your very same question before, and there may be a very good answer to either support or refute your idea."
neuro,39ax9o,owatonna,2,Thu Jun 11 14:00:15 2015 UTC,"This is a good thread and I think you are asking the right questions. As you have proposed and others have pointed out, I think this clearly indicates that supersensitivity is either not the problem or not all of it. I have always found the supersensitivity theory to be very convenient, as it gives an explanation that steers away from neuron death. But neuron death is more plausible given that tardive dyskinesia is typically permanent."
neuro,39ax9o,matis_keynell,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:05:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  But I also think it doesn't have to be neuron death. I mean, it could be, but maybe postsynaptic D2 receptors sometimes just don't downregulate? Maybe D2 antagonism permanently increases the sensitivity of the dopamine system, and the high sensitivity is irreversible?  Can an upregulation of some receptor be permanent? Do we know for sure if it can or cannot be permanent? Maybe the dopamine system is overprotective, and that's why it won't let it receptors downregulate after antipsychotic use?"
neuro,398zos,HappyDaysInYourFace,4,Wed Jun 10 03:03:06 2015 UTC,"Short answer: we don't know.  Long answer: there are a lot of theories in the literature at the moment as to why there are these structural changes long term following TBI. One popular theory at the moment is the theory of ""inflammaging"", or the idea that chronic inflammation associated with aging may influence these changes. However this theory can only explain the more long term changes that may be associated with TBI and not so much the acute phase which may have been sustained at a much younger age, regardless of injury severity or the number of TBI events.  Personally I believe that the acute phase of TBI starts a series of complex biochemical cascades that don't really ""ramp down""; when you bring in the idea of inflammaging (ie. a chronically inflammed environment within the brain) that can potentially further drive this cascade, this does not present a real opportunity for structural integrity to be maintained.  I haven't looked into glial scars personally but from my understanding treatments regarding glial scar formation tend to block events upstream rather then the scar itself. For example this paper found that in a pre-clinical rodent model of TBI a cell cycle inhibitor was found to attenuate glial scar formation amongst other things: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1149422/. That being said, if something works in a rodent model it doesn't guarantee that it will work in a human and the translation between pre-clinical models and clinical trials is the biggest hurdle in TBI therapeutics at the moment.

Axons particularly those traversing area of the brain that are less mechanically stable are the most effected.  Regeneration of axons is difficult, because of glial scaring as you mentioned, and for other reasons. The adult brain is much different from the developing brain. The cues that were present during development to guide axons to their targets are not always present.  Inhibitors of glial scar have been promising in animal models, but as far as I know have not been effective in humans."

They looked through peer-reviewed literature to create the connectivity matrix of glutamatergic connections within a cerebral hemisphere.

neuro,394ey7,khah1,2,Tue Jun 9 13:49:19 2015 UTC,"For the human brain, most connectivity data either comes from non-invasive techniques (MRI, fMRI, DTI) or from post-mortem anatomy. We can't inject tract tracers in humans.  In mammals, particularly in rodents, but also in non-human primates, we know much more about connectivity at the cellular level. This is because there are many ways to trace the anatomical paths that axons take from one brain area to other areas (anterograde tracing) or from many areas to a specific area (retrograde tracing). We also now have the means to go beyond connections between cortical areas, and to go deeper, to identify specific layers and cell types within those areas that are (or are not) the recipients of synaptic input from distant areas. We also have new techniques to study the cellular connectivity within a single cortical area (i.e. between layers, or between neighboring neurons) and even subcellular connectivity (onto the constituent parts of a single neuron).  There are many labs doing this type of work, but I'll just mention a few senior authors here - their papers will quickly lead you to the labs I've omitted (S Hestrin, S Brown, K Svoboda, M Scanziani, G Shepherd, Y Kawaguchi, M Sherman, C Petersen, T Margrie, M Hausser, M Brecht, F Helmchen, L Petreanu).   are most/all/any of these connections mediated by non-specific thalamus?   See work by Murray Sherman and Ray Guillery. For any pair of two cortical areas, they may well be connected by direct corticocortical connections, bidirectionally or unidirectionally; they may also be connected by corticothalamocortical connections.   Do the white-matter tracts bypass thalamus?   I'm not sure what you mean? Some axons never leave the neocortex. Others descend all the way to the spinal cord, or to the brain stem - many such axons travel in the internal capsule, but send collaterals to the thalamus in passing. Some cortical neurons send axons to the thalamus, but not any further ""down"". In fact, very few neurons project to a single location - the norm seems to be having multiple targets. See for example (Kita and Kita, 2012).   Is white matter a limited access highway, or can you exit wherever you feel like it?   Yep, it seems that cortical axons dip down into the white matter when they travel to distant targets, and then climb back up from the white matter into the cortical gray matter when they approach their destination - not so much in right angles, more like that hit an ""exit ramp"" off the white matter highway and gradually steer up through layer 6, then layer 5, etc.   Are there gray-matter-only corticocortical connections?   Yes, although this is somewhat of a nomenclature question. Cortical pyramidal neurons send axons that synapse onto neurons very close by (same layer, within say 50 micrometers), at short distances (other layers in the same ""column"", a few hundred micrometers above or below), slightly longer distances (neighboring columns) and these connections don't pass through white matter, and the axons are typically unmyelinated. But they also target more distant cortical areas, in which case the axons typically run through the white matter, where they are myelinated. Note that the notion of a ""column"" is a bit arbitrary, and I am using it here to denote a small local volume, of ~0.5 mm diameter, ranging across all cortical layers, from the pia to the white matter.   If so, how ""non-local"" do they get?   See above. Most cortical areas make reciprocal connections with their counterpart in the contralateral hemisphere. For something like auditory cortex, the axons must travel a long distance (through the corpus callosum). But they often also make connections with multiple other cortical areas, some adjacent, and some separated by great distances.   If any of these options, then does anyone know what kind of proportions they exist in?   Do you mean, what proportion of corticocortical connections at the level of individual neurons is local vs long-range?   That's difficult to answer. I think overall we don't have a good idea of the degree of ""convergence"" and ""divergence"" at the cellular level. A single layer 5 pyramidal neuron makes glutamatergic synapses onto multiple other L5 neurons (pyramidal and interneurons) in the same area, and onto neurons in other layers in the same area, but the exact number of local neurons targeted is not known (to my knowledge): I'd roughly estimate a single neuron targets 20-200 local neurons, and maybe a similar number in each distant cortical area that it targets. But that's little more than a guess. It is difficult to reconstruct the complete axonal arbor of a single neuron, and be sure it is complete, and then also identify how many postsynaptic neurons are targeted by it.  In the other direction, namely asking how many neurons converge onto a single cortical neuron, some progress is being made by use of modified rabies virus: this can be engineered to hop a single synapse in the retrograde direction, and then stop hopping. Judicious use of this technique should allow for estimates of convergence. Maybe look at recent papers by Botond Roska.  In additional to anatomical methods, other methods for assessing connectivity patterns and strengths at the cellular level in cortex include:   Paired recordings (simultaneously recording from multiple neurons in slices of brain tissue, and testing for unitary connections between them; see Brown and Hestrin, for example). Genetic connectivity anatomy. The Allen Institute does this and has a public database of images. The idea is to inject an anterograde fluorescent tracer into one brain area of a mouse or rat, then image the entire brain at high resolution (after killing the animal and slicing the brain into sections), and thus identify brain areas that contain fluorescent axon terminal arborizations. In other words, it gives an area-to-areas connectivity map. It does not tell you which neurons or which layers receive input, however. And it can be difficult to differentiate areas where axons simply pass through without making synaptic connections, from areas where the axons make synapses. For that, you typically need to measure functional connectivity (see #3 below). Channelrhodopsin (ChR2): this membrane protein is a light-sensitive ion channel, and neurons can be made to produce this protein (and thus become light-sensitive) by breeding specific mouse lines, or by injecting viruses, or by electroporating DNA. This technique has many uses. Interestingly, ChR2 is expressed in the axons and axon terminals, not just in the cell body and dendrites. And if you slice up a rodent brain, long-range axons that are severed from their originating cell body remain photo-sensitive. Thus, it is possible to inject a virus into area A, slice the brain, and observe light-sensitive (from neurons located in area A) within the distant area B. In fact, you can stimulate these axon fragments in area B and measure how the neurons in area B respond to this stimulation - i.e. you can detect which neurons in area B receive synaptic input from area A. Look at papers from the Svoboda group, for example.   Be sure to read the van Essen meta-study on laminar patterns of ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up"" connections. ""Distributed Hierarchical Processing in the Primate Cerebral Cortex"" (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991).  I'd recommend searching journals like Nature, J Neurosci, NEURON, Nature Neuroscience, or just pubmed, for keywords such as: interareal channelrhodopsin photostimulation reciprocal synaptic organization corticocortico callosal"

To address some of the ambiguities from my original post, I had seen some numbers based on work by Binzegger et al. from 2004 on cat visual cortex that suggested that, for example, about 70-80% of synapses in a given area of layer one originate from somewhere else in cortex. So I'm trying to find some kind of estimate for what proportion of those come from diffuse projections straight from neighboring (or not-so-neighboring) areas of cortex, if possible which layers they originate in, what proportion of axons synapsing in a particular area pass through white matter, how far they might travel through white matter, etc. Basically any known characteristics of the network topology.

This response is normal and, when occurring in healthy individuals, entirely harmless - it may be uncomfortable as the stimulation subsides, but it won't hurt you. I sometimes find that getting up and walking around after I've been startled can help me come back to baseline a little more quickly.  In people who are not healthy, the affects of adrenaline can conceivably cause problems, albiet mostly physical. For example, the sympathetic system stimulation can lead to increased heart rate and vasoconstriction, which could be harmful for someone who is cardio-compromised (the cartoonish stereotype of being scared into a heart attack, although rare, is theoretically possible if the person is at very high risk, and an increased HR/BP + vasoconstriction would cause a cardiac event).

At any rate, Calcium is used as a ""Second Messenger"" cell in neurons, and it is very powerful. Inside of a neuron, calcium had the possibility activate, I would estimate, tens of thousands of proteins and enzymes. In a normal cell activation, this calcium can activate signaling cascades that open other ion channels, produce neurotransmitters, release vesicles, etc etc. Excitotoxicity happens when there is too much Calcium at once. This calcium could activate proteins that break down the cell membrane or other vital proteins for healthy neuron function. In this case, the neuron could be seriously damaged or killed.   This will generally only occur in an atypical brain environment. Maybe there are defective proteins for ion channels, letting in too much calcium. One of the most common causes of excitotoxicity is hypoglycemia, as it leads to a build up of glutamate around neurons, so once activated, far too much calcium is let into the neuron.

neuro,38v0ha,reluctantusername,6,Sun Jun 7 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"Short answer: it's possible, but unless you're an engineer it's extremely improbable, and it'll probably cost as much as some of the commercial options anyway. I suggest Neurosky's Mindwave Mobile ($130) for a cheap but mostly-functional EEG, and OpenBCI's Arduino-compatible kit for a more expensive ($500ish) but research-grade option that requires some assembly.  Long answer: A friend at my local makerspace is making his own EEG and he's just barely gotten it to get signal that the computer can read now, which he now has to write software to analyze, and now he's talking about printing his own circuit boards for the next step. It's taken him over a year, and this guy has decent engineering knowledge and is retired so he has more free time than you do. I don't know how much the project has cost thus far but I do know it's gotten pricey.  As far as commercial options, there are actually some decent ones. Your best bet for a really nice research-grade EEG is http://openbci.com/ OpenBCI kits. It's a good middle ground between building your own and getting a broscience headset. It's also mostly open source so it's new right now, but there will probably be a good community building software and such for it once it gets off the ground. Unfortunately the boards are sometimes out of stock because again, it's new and there was huge demand. If you haven't done much tinkering before I suggest getting the Arduino-compatible version because Arduinos are basically the easy-peasy entry level microcontroller and there's a huge community surrounding them so if you have trouble it'll be easy (relatively) to find help.  Your other options, as far as I know, are the Emotiv and various Neurosky headsets. Emotiv has more electrodes and they're wet electrodes so you'll get better signal, but I've heard that they're really flakey and frequently break or refuse to connect to the computer. I haven't gotten to use one myself though so I can't vouch for that.  Neurosky headsets (http://myndplay.com/products.php ) are very reliable, they connect to a phone or a computer via bluetooth, and they're easy to set up and get a signal out of. They're also relatively cheap- the mindwave mobile is $130. The catch is that they're... well. Cheap. Dry electrodes, one or two electrodes depending on the model, and there's some data preprocessing so it just gives you ""focus"" vs ""relaxation"" calculated via their mysterious proprietary formula without really telling you what your brainwaves are doing. Granted, their measurements do seem to correlate well with relaxation and attention, so if you just want to play with meditation and caffeine and such then this could easily work for you.   If you want to try doing a little bit more with the data, you can use the open source software OpenVibe (http://openvibe.inria.fr/) which has a driver to talk to Neurosky and Emotiv headsets and lets you set up experiments and record data and potentially even output data to other devices. Neurosky's preprocessing happens before it send the data to the computer though, so if you're using those then you're still limited to using their ""focus"" and ""relaxation"" measurements instead of actual data.  Sorry about the tl;dr. I've spent a lot of time talking about EEGs at my makerspace."

Build some simple electronics, like I don't know. Use a simple op amp to amplify the signal from a photo diode and then your Arduino to sample it. Then build up in complexity. You'll need to understand how analog filters are realised, so building a little speaker could help (I have some instructions here ).

Although there is the problem of how do you perform meta-analyses to more reliably discern patterns if there is no standard agreement on the stages of consciousness...   Well, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi proposed criteria by which you could differentiate such states 40-50 years ago,   Higher States of Consciousness in the Vedic Psychology of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi: A Theoretical Introduction and Research Review  and researchers at Maharishi University of Management have been publishing short-term and long-term longitudinal studies on people for the past 45 years, so its kinda odd to suggest that it doesn't exist.   in this light maybe something like Jeffery Martin's taxonomy of enlightened states via rigorous data-collection and statistical analysis, which he calls the continuum of 'Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience [PNSE]', would be of some    The above concept of enlightenment makes no distinction between description and physiology that is the source of the description.  samadhi or ""pure consciousness"" ala TM is necessarily ""non-symbolic"" because, according to theory, TM has effectively inhibited ANY thalamo-cortical feedback loops.  This creates a situation where the cortex can ONLY be in ""mind-wandering mode"" and accustoms the DMN and other resting state networks to remain active without any associated ""content"". In a very real sense, all that can possibly exist (at least in the hypothetical ""pure"" state where alpha-1 connectivity activity is the only thing going on while activity associated with sensory and data-processing has faded towards zero) is ""sense of self"" without anything else at all. This is a ""non-dual"" state of a sort, but only because duality is impossible during such a situation, since there's no ""other"" because such processing simply can't take place, period (at least in the idealized case, which may or may not exist).  The persistence of ""pure"" sense-of-self during waking, dreaming and sleeping, doesn't depend in any way on non-symbolic experience, but merely on the presence of strong connectivity that isn't associated with any  cognitive activity such as thought, belief, memory, sensory awareness, desire, decision-making, etc.  While Maharishi calls this the first stage of enlightenment, he also describes at as ""glorified ignorance"" because duality is at it highest possible point: pure self aka (Self or atman) can only be appreciated as completely separate from everything else.  ""Higher stages"" of enlightenment allegedly eventually resolve this dichotomy but while subjects in the last study I linked to DO seem to report such episodes, the criteria used to select them was merely persistence of Self, even during deep sleep, and there weren't a sufficient number of subjects in that group (17) to do sub-group analysis based on anything that spontaneously popped up during the interview portion where they were asked to ""describe your self"":   L1: We ordinarily think my self as this age; this color of hair; these hobbies . . . my experience is that my Self is a lot larger than that. It's immeasurably vast. . . on a physical level. It is not just restricted to this physical environment  L2: It's the ‘‘I am-ness.’’ It's my Being. There's just a channel underneath that's just underlying everything. It's my essence there and it just doesn't stop where I stop. . . by ‘‘I,’’ I mean this 5 ft. 2 person that moves around here and there  L3: I look out and see this beautiful divine Intelligence. . . you could say in the sky, in the tree, but really being expressed through these things. . . and these are my Self  L4: I experience myself as being without edges or content. . . beyond the universe. . . all-pervading, and being absolutely thrilled, absolutely delighted with every motion that my body makes. With everything that my eyes see, my ears hear, my nose smells. There's a delight in the sense that I am able to penetrate that. My consciousness, my intelligence pervades everything I see, feel and think  L5: When I say ’’I’’ that's the Self. There's a quality that is so pervasive about the Self that I'm quite sure that the ‘‘I’’ is the same ‘‘I’’ as everyone else's ‘‘I.’’ Not in terms of what follows right after. I am tall, I am short, I am fat, I am this, I am that. But the ‘‘I’’ part. The ‘‘I am’’ part is the same ‘‘I am’’ for you and me   .  If you look at the EEG of the subject in this video during TM (the narrator's wife during the first part), you can see the F3-F4 coherence during TM. Reesarchers in the first 3 studies above established that when there is simultaneously an abrupt change in alpha EEG coherence in the frontal lobes along the lines of what is shown in the video + an abrupt reduction in heart rate + an abrupt increase in GSR + an abrupt decrease of breathrate (or even apparent suspension of breathing), meditators tend to press a button signaling samadhi after all the above return to more normal levels.  If you look at the last 6 minutes of the video (a before/after of someone on the ""Invincible America"" course where subjects get paid $700/month for years at a time to meditate and do other practices 8 hours a day for world peace), you'll see extremely heightened (about 0.9-0.99) alpha EEG coherence across F3-F4 along with higher beta and gamma coherence across the same leads. A somewhat less striking, but similar measure is associated with the first stage of enlightenment (as we TMers define it) outside of meditation practice, where pure sense-of-self emerges and persists at all times, even during sleep.  From the TM perspective, this is a completely natural phenomenon and might emerge in people who never practice and form of meditation, yoga, martial arts or anything else. It is merely a reflection of how well the fully-mature human nervous system is able to handle stress.  Coincidentally, it turns out that if you compare world-champion (score in the top ten for at least 3 years in a row) athletes with normal world-level athletes (never break out of the bottom 50th percentile), you see EEG coherence levels mid-way between short-term TM practitioners and the enlightened TMers. The same pattern holds for top-level management vs middle-level management (at least in firms not under investigation for criminal activity).  .  If you were to combine the first part of that EEG video with the last, and imagine someone whose EEG was highly coherent in all frequencies across all leads, you might be able to grasp the TM theory  that Unity Consciousness (""non-dual consciousness"" in the TM perspective) is based on the internal perception that all perceptual phenomena (sense-perception, thoughts, verbalizations, memories, desires, actions, emotions, intuitions, cognitive processes, etc) are fluctuations of the operation of the neural mechanisms that give rise to pure sense-of-self.  Notice that there's no ""Non-Symbolic Experience"" aspect, per se. This is a pre-cognitive thing based on perception of wholeness (Self) giving way to dedicated processing that handles appreciation of parts."
neuro,38v0ha,saijanai,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:30:06 2015 UTC,"The current scientific POV shows that meditative expertise starts with the alpha relaxation states and progresses to the more high frequency gamma states. This appears universal across authentic meditative traditions. Alpha varies greatly from person to person and therefore it is necessary to determine an individual alpha for each person, otherwise it is not reliable. This individual alpha baseline will actually decrease as meditation and coherence increases, giving another reason for the use of Indivdual Alpha Frequency or IAF.  See: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20227193  The closest universal marker for higher states of consciousness, appears to be a high amplitude gamma synchrony signature which persists outside of meditation. This was first seen in Patanjali yogis in ""samadhi"" way back in he 1950's but has since been replicated in Buddhist yogis.  See: http://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16369.full"
neuro,38v0ha,MeditationMcGyver,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:48:53 2015 UTC,"lol. Good luck with that. Non-dual consciousness is purely theoretical for 99.9% of the people that talk about it and even who claim to have experienced it. Therefore, it is commonly subject to an inordinate amount of what observers of western interpretations of Eastern philosophies often call 'woo'. The experience of non-dual consciousness would be the experience of feeling (sometimes confused with knowing) that you are the same entity as an oak tree for instance. You can sometimes get there with a heavy dose of plant material. I'd be dubious if anyone claimed to experience it outside of that method. It follows that the EEG correlate of such a state would need to be measured under such a state. I'm not aware of any study that maps it. I'm also dubious that anyone could or would want to remain 'non-dual', essentially in a constant state of severe ego dissociation. Psychologically, my money would be on that being unhealthy in the extreme. People sometimes become schitzotypic after a habit of very short term psychedelic experiences, though they commonly don't think of themselves as disordered aside from bouts of dissociation and/or depression. We need our egos for our sanity. Saying that we don't ranks up there with the common stoner recommendation of pot, lsd, or mushrooms for psychiatric disorders. It's stoner logic derived from what feels good to think is correct. It's about the exact opposite of correct. All that being said, I think that short neurofeedback induced forays into meditative states that strengthen communication pathways in the brain is healthy. There is just no way, however, I'd put neurofeedback in the same category of what psychedelics can do. It just wouldn't happen. Though, it may train toward a state of greater mental health that a subject interprets as being equivalent to what is often referred to as a conscious state of non-duality."
neuro,38v0ha,golgi1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:17:32 2015 UTC,"[edited for clarity]  Part 2 of 2:  .  According to Maharishi, this situation is where the nervous system has settled into its ""least excited"" state while still remaining alert. This state of least-excitation is considered to be teh most-restful state of the nervous system, at least with respect to stress, and so, the practice of Transcendental Meditation is where one sets up conditions to allow such rest to occur.   In reality, the mind has a tendency to settle down during TM, which means that the nervous system is resting more deeply than usual (TM being a strategy to set up initial conditions for this deeper-than-normal rest to occur -note lack of use of term ""technique"" here). At some point in this process of resting, repair/normalization mechanisms will kick in to repair/normalize the homeostasis-disrupting effect of stress. The activation of such mechanisms is perceived internally as an increase in mental activity. In some people, some of hte time, the activity of the mind may appear to cease completely (see ""pure consciousness"") but eventually, in any person who isn't fully stable, repair/normalization activities will kick in, again, perceived as thinking.  And so, the internal perception of the process of TM will involve a cycle of decreasing mental activity, followed by increasing mental activity, with occasional indeterminate (how could you tell the passage of time in this situation) periods of no apparent mental activity (at least in some people).  EEG-wise, the EEG during TM fluctuates between normal restful wakeful EEG, and the EEG characteristic of samadhi and all points in between.  The first part of this EEG demo, the EEG of the narrator's wife during TM, gives a good idea of the kind of EEG characteristic of a very long term (many decades) TMer during TM practice.   The presence of frontal alpha1 EEG coherence is typical of pure consciousness during TM, and likely reflects a persistent pure sense-of-self along with random relaxed thoughts that arise during the TM process (the woman has been TMing for several decades, so she's ideal for theoretical discussion purposes, but notsomuch as a source of ""typical EEG"" during TM in beginners).  More interestingly, notice the fluctuations of global alpha1 EEG coherence: in the back of the brain and between the front and back of the brain, with occasional periods of global convergence of alpha-1 EEG coherence (more on this later). In the later 6 minutes of the video, you can see a different person whose frontal EEG in alpha1, beta and gamma frequences is all highly coherent. THis is actually the physiological signature of someone in what Maharishi Mahesh Yogi called ""Cosmic Consciousness,"" or ""CC,"" where the physiological characteristics of samadhi during meditation have begun to manifest as traits outside of meditation, appreciated as a pure, persistent, uninvolved, ever-present, never-judgemental, ever-watchful  sense-of-self which eventually becomes permanent, present at all times, whether awake, dreaming or in deep sleep.  Research on TMers reporting this ""first stage of enlightenment""  continuously for 1 year has been published, both psychological (pdf) and physiological (pdf).  Fred Travis summarized all of the above (and more) in his paper ""Transcendental experiences during meditation practice"" with a download .doc version available online. I also have a pdf version if you want it.  Most of the ""enlightened"" group only describe things along the lines of this first stage of TM-style enlightenment, which Maharishi liked to characterize as ""glorified ignorance"" as it was actually a situation where the distinction ""self"" and ""other"" was most pronounced -ironically, in TM-theory, radical duality is the basis for eventual non-duality. A few of the enlightened subjects seem to be reporting ""higher"" states (see the interview responses in the psychoogy paper), which is where duality starts to be resolved and eventually eliminated, but there were only 17 people in the ""enlightened"" group, so there's no way to do a sub-group analysis of the physiological correlates of say, Unity Consciousness vs CC.  Fred Travis recently told me that he's doing a new study on enlightenment with 51 new 'enlightened"" subjects, which MAY be enough to compare CC with non-duality Unity Conscioiusness, but we'll see. My own guess is that it will ahve something to do with that fluctuating global EEG coherence shown in that EEG video: When EEG coherence between front and back, left and right, coinicides, than ""Self"" is undifferentiated. It is possible that someone whose default EEG is highly coherent at all times will be able to both note the continuous presence of ""Self"" along with the emergence of dedicated networks of subprocessing systems int eh brain that handle details. Such a person would appreciate the details of existence ""as fluctuations of self,"" which is the Advaita Vedana description of non-duality.  The intermediate state between ""glorified ignorance"" and Unity, would be where one is able to appreciate the emergence of large-scale dedicated subsystems as ""flucutations of self,"" even if, by the time such subsystems are processing data, ""Self"" is lost in the details. Such an intermediate stage is called ""God Consciousness"" in TM-Speak and is where one appreciates teh Devas (the ""gods"" that control how our universe of things, both internal and external, interact) emerge out of homogenous Self. Devas, in this model, are merely the appreciation of the emergence of these dedicated processing subsystems (""deva"" literally means ""shining one"") that a semi-non-dual person would appreciate during the emergence of these less homogenous systems out of the fully homogenous Self.  .  .  ANd so it is relatively straightforward to devise experiments to examine these states of consciousness. Interpreting what the data mean may be more difficult."

For example, it is possible to take people who self-report extended periods of samadhi, AKA ""pure consciousness"" during TM, and hook them up to EEG apparatus. From my own personal ""experience,"" I characterize samadhi as having apparently occured when there is an abrupt transition from having a given train of thought, or awareness of a specific bird chirping, or some car approaching, to a situation where that bird is no longer chirping, or the car is now receding, etc., with no memory of any transitional period, or indeed of anything at all between one set of ""awarenesses"" and another. Formally, Maharishi Mahesh Yog described ""pure consciousness"" as:  ""This is a state of inner wakefulness with no object of thought or perception, just pure consciousness [TC], aware of its own unbounded nature.

If you're interested in ""good"" neurogenesis via increasing circulation of growth factors then the current research points toward one activity: regular cardio exercise. That said the endogenous functional importance of the neurogenic niches in the adult brain and where those cells migrate to/integrate is not terribly understood. E.x. Slightly increasing migration of new neurons along the rostral-stream from the subventricular zone to the olfactory bulb probably isn't going to have global effects on cognitive ability or ""intelligence"".  But like ennervated_scientist noted it's more complicated than simply increasing the genesis of new neurons. More important is how they differentiate, where they're going to mature, in what way they're integrating into their local networks, how they interact with their local milieu and community, .....  Likewise simply increasing the plasticity of connections in a network isn't a good thing intrinsically. In fact ""more plasticity!"" can be catastrophic (plasticity is a double edged sword - its involved in certain pathomechanisms for example) depending on the physiological context and the functional network.

neuro,3899um,DivineKegel,4,Tue Jun 2 18:59:28 2015 UTC,"When the neuron releases dopamine, it will bind to the postsynaptic dopamine receptor as well as the presynaptic autoreceptor. Binding of dopamine to the autoreceptor inhibits the neuron from releasing more dopamine, ie a negative feedback loop. If you have an antagonist selective for the autoreceptor that doesn't bind to the postsynaptic receptors you inhibit the negative feedback loop thus amplifying dopamine transmission. This would be very roughly similar to blocking the dopamine transporter or the COMT enzyme.  On the other hand if you have a ""plain"" dopamine antagonist, it will prevent the released dopamine from binding to the postsynaptic receptors, thus disrupting the signal. So the effect can actually be the opposite depending on which receptor (pre/post) you antagonize."
neuro,3899um,17ts,2,Tue Jun 2 20:55:06 2015 UTC,"It isn't really that weird for increased dopamine release to help with depression. What should be more alarming for you is that a supposed antipsychotic isn't blocking post-synaptic receptors. The trick here is that they use it at high doses as an antipsychotic and at low doses to increase dopamine tone. This is termed a biphasic effect.  A similar, but opposite, effect has been reported for quinpirole a D-2 agonist, such that it can act selectively at either the presynaptic to block dopamine release (and reduce locomotion) or the post-synaptic to increase D2 signalling (and increase locomotion).  Eilam D, Szechtman H. Biphasic effect of D-2 agonist quinpirole on locomotion and movements. European Journal of Pharmacology. 1989;161(2–3):151-7."
neuro,3899um,blumsy,2,Tue Jun 2 21:22:58 2015 UTC,"Firing Nerve -> Space Between Nerve Cells is called the Synapse -> Receiving Nerve   Firing Nerves have presynapse receptors to turn off neurotransmitter release so you do not release too much neurotransmitter.  They also have receiving receptors for originally this nerve cell was ""quiet"" and listening for other nerve cells then it was ""turned on"".  Another name for presynapse receptors are auto receptors. When a nerve cell is turned on (an action potential) for example the taar1 receptor is triggered for dopamine neurotransmitters the nerve cell begins a series of steps that cause it to release neurotransmitters that it keeps in little storage closets inside your cell to be pushed into the space between nerve cells. The storage closet is called synaptic vesicles and the space between nerve cells is called the synapse once neurotransmitters are between nerve cells within the synapse, it will activate both presynaptic and post synaptic receptors.  Post synaptic receptors are waiting for enough receptor triggering and then it will do something, either turning on the nerve cell and firing electricity or inhibiting the nerve cell and preventing the firing of electricity.  Inhibitory receptors are meant to stop things such as bad decisions, over excitation, modulating anxiety so you are arroused but not suffering a panic attack etc. The receptors once triggered will keep firing if the neurotransmitters remain there thus your body moves the neurotransmitters out of the way via reuptake transporters, or deactivate the neurotransmitters via enzymes.  Using presynaptic receptors to prevent over release via having a stop sign that turns off the neurotransmitter faucet means less work for the reuptake transporter and enzymes.  Stopping the faucet is called negative feedback since your own release is controlling when to stop the release. Now there is another similar type of receptor called heteroreceptor.  A heteroreceptor is a receptor of one neurotransmitter changing a nerve that focus on another neurotransmitter. For example there are at least 14 different subtypes of serotonin receptors in humans, and these different subtypes have different purposes and even of the subtypes do multiple different things in different parts of the brain on different type of nerve cells.  Well you find serotonin receptors on dopamine and norepinephrine nerve cells and specific subtypes of the serotonin receptor turn on dopamine neurons in specific parts of the brain, while other subtypes turn off dopamine in certain parts of the brain.  Thus these serotonin receptors on dopamine neurons are heteroreceptors.  Think of it like heterosexuals a male interacts with something that is not his own gender, heteroreceptor are the same principle.  We know of at least 7 serotonin receptor subtypes that influence dopamine in some way.  For example the 5ht2c serotonin receptor is triggered by anxiety and it decreases dopamine not everywhere in the brain but specific parts one of which is the reward center, something may seem less reward if you are anxious or depressed.  5HT1A is a serotonin receptor you find presynaptically turning off serotonin, post synaptically telling serotonin nerves to do things, and also as a heteroreceptor on nerve cells that are not serotonin focused.  5HT1A receptors are located in the frontal lobe on dopamine neurons (not the reward center) where when these 5HT1A serotonin heteroreceptor are stimulated release dopamine.  Medium amounts of dopamine in this area of the frontal lobe have effects that calm down anxiety/anxiolytic and possibly one of the many way depression is treated via serotonin drugs that effect serotonin reuptake (ssris) or modify the 5HT1A receptor such as 5HT1A agonists, or do both such as the new Serotonin Modulater and Stimulators (SMS) Now when the receptors are triggered in a certain way, and a certain amount, and at a certain speed it can activate the regulatory mechanisms of the cell and change the number of receptors.  For example the cell can create more or less of a receptor or reuptake transporter.  Sometimes these changes are very temporarily like hours or days, sometimes for very long time like months, years, or possibly forever.  This can make some drugs tricky especially if the drug does different things at different dosages or different people.  For example with a partial agonist drug it may help turn on neurotransmitter receptors at low dosages but at high dosages it works as a blocker of the same receptor.  The reason why is a partial agonist is like the neurotransmitter and it can turn on the same receptors but it does not turn it on as easily as the neurotransmitter itself.  Thus if your body was only going to release a little amount of neurotransmitter to that specific stimuli it helps like an ally, but if the body was going to release a lot of neurotransmitters then the agonist gets in the way for the nerve cell has only so many receptors and the partial agonist may turn on the receptor somewhat but it does not stimulate it as much as the neurotransmitter could but it still takes time to do so and prevent the neurotransmitter from doing the same.  Think of partial agonists as slow checkout shoppers in the checkout line.  With plenty of cashiers they give more business to the store.  But if there is a limit on the number of cashiers they slow down the process of the faster and more effective shoppers for you have many customers and one cashier."

The brain seems to be more like every other tissue in that they contain resident macrophages (microglia). In the event of an inflammatory event, microglia recruit peripheral monocytes, T cells and B cells into the brain. Knock-out studies have shown that if you irradiate the body and remove all macrophages (including microglia), then replace the bone marrow with GFP-tagged monocytes, GFP expressing 'microglia' will soon form in the brain.  The brain is definitely not as immune privileged as we once thought. We know that peripheral and central inflammatory events are related and communicate, but we have only hypothesized about how this communication occurs.   This study is unique in that it actually shows a way in which the immune system can communicate without having to go through the blood brain barrier, as was previously thought. Previously we hypothesized that immune cells could cross the BBB with special transport and communicated by sending cytokines back and forth across the BBB.

I personally worked with long term Buddhist meditators in graduate school when I was introduced to this.   You said specifically:   There are people who report subjective awareness throughout the waking, dreaming, and deep sleep cycles. The subjective experience can be correlated with a crude EEG measurement which might be indicative of something (like Alpha + Delta readings simultaneously.)   I challenge you to point me to any research on Buddhist meditation where alpha + delta EEG shows up during sleep.  In fact, with mindfulness and concentration meditation, the EEG signature during dreaming is enhanced gamma EEG. This is well-correlated with lucid dreaming.  alpha + delta during sleep is the EEG signature of long-time TMers and in 40+ years of following meditation research, I haven't come across anyone claiming to find that as a result of any Buddhist practice.  There ARE websites that discuss both the EEG of lucid dreaming and the EEG of witnessing sleep and perhaps you got the two confused."

However, the EEG signature for lucid dreaming involves higher levels of Gamma EEG, which is often found in mindfulness and concentrative practitioners, while the only study I know of where people report sense-of-self persisting during deep, dreamless sleep, shows higher levels of alpha EEG. Alpha-1 EEG cohererence in teh frontal lobes is correlated with samadhi during TM, and broadband EEG coherence as well as self-reports of ""witnessing sleep"" is correlated with the first stage of enlightenment, ala TM.   That being said, I made it pretty clear that I'm aware of the difference between dreaming and deep sleep.

You've already said that you don't know of any research tying a form of Buddhist meditation to any specific EEG readings, so I'm not sure where you got the idea of talking about alpha + delta EEG during sleep in the first place.  There IS an issue of higher alpha occurring during anesthesia that is correlated with a form of anesthetic paralysis where the patient is still aware of their body, yet unable to scream and tell the surgeon that they can still feel teh knife cutting their heart out of their chest (very severe PTSD generally results form this condition).  ""Enlightened"" TMers also report ""witnessing"" anesthesia, but don't report that they are aware of body sensations, just that sense-of-self persists even while they are ""out."""

neuro,3836eo,steveacronin,6,Wed Jun 3 23:12:32 2015 UTC,"CLIFF NOTES: We don't know.  I feel like we just talked about this. It's complicated since IMO consciousness isn't limited to the bounds of neuroscience. With our limited tools, it's probably a mistake to equate consciousness with what we have the ability to measure.  A good first step is being solid about your definitions and what you mean by consciousness. As a Psychologist I primarily think of it as awareness however the neuro crew here I would imagine is more specific.  From the perspective of transpersonal psychology, falling asleep is the act of consciousness moving from the gross realm, to the subtle realm, to the causal realm - that is - consciousness moving from waking, to dreaming, to deep sleep.  In terms of, does the ""I"" (the subjective sense of the self) changing throughout this process, I would say of course it does. However, the sense of self is transient (actually widens from a developmental psych point of view) and therefore focusing on this issue is probably a mistake. That being said, I personally find it very interesting that when exiting the waking world, our consciousness has a very hard time grasping to a waking sense of the self (generally a self that is tied to a name, a profession, a body, etc.) and becomes more fluid until deep, dreamless, sleep where there isn't a sense of self at all (according to those who hold awareness in the causal realm.) Erm, because I'm bringing this up, it's probably appropriate to say that those who hold awareness in the subtle realm are generally considered to be lucid dreamers.  I doubt we currently hold the ability to measure all brain activity. Simply because our measurements do not record some activity in some area of the brain at a certain time does not mean no activity exists. Someone yesterday posted a CNN article here about the self dying when we fall asleep.  To suggest something like death of the self is irresponsible. This also supposes that the self equates with electrical activity in the brain, which is only slightly less laughable. It's probably true that electrical, or more completely electro-chemical, activity in the brain is part of the self. But to suggest there's not a more complete picture out there is pretty ridiculous."
neuro,3836eo,steveacronin,4,Mon Jun 1 15:17:11 2015 UTC,"I always use this somewhat opaque (to my undergraduates) definition, but I think it captures everything necessary: consciousness - the property of being in a state like which there is something it is to be.  Also, although neuroscience pretty much unequivocally proves this idea false based on sleeping brain activity, you could philosophically argue it's possible we're 100% conscious while we sleep, but memories cannot be formed during sleep.  So it is just to impossible  to remember being asleep."

(65- year old male; 39 years TM practice)  Inner wakefulness during sleep is the marker of Cosmic Consciousness in the Vedic tradition. It is a state that cannot be faked. The body is asleep, the sense are shut down, the thinking mind is quiet, while a continuum of self-awareness persists from falling asleep to waking up. The quote above uses an analogy; during sleeping the “fizzing” or stream of conscious experiences goes down to reveal the underlying “soda” or pure self-awareness that continues throughout the night. When one wakes up, the fizzing simply begins again."

neuro,3836eo,steveacronin,0,Tue Jun 2 15:32:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I haven't looked into TM in years and am turned off by the fact you have to pay a significant amount of money to learn what seems to be a form of mantra meditation. Not to say that it isn't valuable, I don't know.   Well, TM involves a mantra, but the purpose is quite different. In typical mantra meditation, one talks about the mantra as something that you concentrate or  focus on. With TM, that isnt' the case at all, as this ancient mini-talk by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1968) explicitly says:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjem4YfJGQI  As far as whether or not you pay money, well yes, if you can afford to pay, you are required to pay. TM teachers train for 5 months, in residence, to imitate the teaching method of Mahirshi Mahesh Yogi. They basically memorize a play in 4 acts, performed over 4 days, that is meant to provide an intuitive grasp of what it means to think a mantra without effort.  If you beileve that reading the Cliff's Notes about a play, or a summary of a play, has the same effect as watching the play performed by well-trained actors, than you'll believe that charging any money at all for TM is not justified.  However, if you believe that there IS a difference between reading a synopsis of a play, or even the director's personal annotations of the play, and watching the play live, then you might believe that TM is worth a bit of money...  How much depends on who you are and what you can afford and partial scholarships are avialable to reduce the cost further.  The fee covers the room and board for the TM teacher, as well as the rent on the TM center, as well as pays for the shoes for the TM teacher's kids...  You see, being a TM teacher is a full-time job, because not only are you required to provide a lifetime followup for your OWN students, but you are required to provide a lifetime followup for every other TM teacher's students, no matter when or where they learned or how much they paid.  In the USA, that lifetime followup program is free, though in other countries, they often charge a fee after the first 6 months.  If you happen to be a member of one of the groups the David Lynch Foundation deals with, you learned for free, but your local TM teacher is still required to provide followup services for the rest of your life.  .  and so the question really is: can you learn TM on your own, or do you need a trained teacher, and should that teacher be compensated for his or her time? Obviously, those of us who are in favor of the TM organization and its world-wide mission to provide a special kind of meditation, taught by highly trained meditation teachers, believe that the fee is justifiable, espeically since there is a somewhat sliding scale, as well as scholarships available, not to mention 500,000 people have learned TM for free through the DLF.  Other people disagree.  OF course, sometimes entire countries believe that TM is worthwhile, and special agreements are made to make TM available to as many people as possible.  For example, the government of Brazil has announced plans to pay for 48,000 existing school teachers to be trained as TM teachers, so that all 45 million public school students in Brazil can participate for free in this school program described in this NBC news report:  http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/san-francisco-schools-transformed-power-meditation-n276301  Following that report, virtually every school district in Latin America has responded favorably to the idea of the DLF teaching the kids TM for free + Yogic Flying for free + building a multi-purpose classroom for each participating school for free so that all students can practice their TM and Yogic Flying together. This is perhaps 20x-100x the response the TM organization was hoping for.  Likewise, when they published two pilot studies of the effect of TM on PTSD in war refugees in Africa, they weren't expecting the United Nations to approach them with questions about how fast they can expand the program.  And so, the UN and other IGOs/NGOs responsible for handling the refugee crisis in Africa (where 100,000,000 people are thought to have PTSD) are doing their own independent research on TM and PTSD. The first independent TM-PTSDstudy will be out sometime later this year, and will apparently show effect-size somewhere between study 3 and study 4 of this chart.  The David Lynch Foundation now predicts, based on independent studies done in Latin American schools, as well as independent studies done on PTSD, prison rehabilitation, etc, by the relevant governments and NGOS/IGOs, that about 100 million people will learn TM for free over the next 10-15 years, taught by existing employees of the relevant organizations (public schools, prisons, disaster relief agencies, etc) trained as TM teachers.  But you might be correct, and instead, the UN will decide to have their workers distribute photocopies of online resources on how to meditate, rather than take the 5 months out of their lives to train as TM teachers.  Certainly they would save about $1 billion in training costs for that many people becoming TM teachers.  One assumes that the relevant organizations are going to be very careful and document their justification for whatever they decide to do."

You are still conscious, but it is subjectively different than the consciousness experienced while awake.  In a similar way, some drugs cause an altered state of consciousness (though different from sleep).    You do not shut down while asleep.  You still sense the environment around you.  You can hear someone call your name, or your baby crying, or your alarm clock in the morning.  Your threshold for arousal is altered, but you still hear.  You still sense the edge of the bed and do not roll off it.  A bright light turned on can wake you up.  We are still processing the world, just in a different way.  We still have mental activity during sleep.  Dreams are the obvious example of this.   We still have motor movements during sleep, though reduced.  When looking a brain activity, during REM sleep, our brain is quite active, almost as if we are wide awake and actively attending to something."
neuro,37zmlx,ComeOnTown,3,Sun May 31 19:20:27 2015 UTC,"I think the author is definitely getting it half-right, but screws up his reasoning towards the end. First off, even in non-REM sleep, you are conscious, and you still dream. REM sleep is characterised by particularly vivid dreams, but you aren't unconscious in other stages of sleep. In fact, the complete loss of consciousness is incredibly rare and is often accompanied by severe brain damage. An ""alternate state of consciousness"" is often used to describe the whole sleep process. Second, there is nothing magical about the continuity of consciousness. In fact, the supposed continuity of consciousness is imagined continuity. We can demonstrate experimentally that consciousness is rhythmic. By the author's reasoning, we would die and be reborn with the waxing and waning of consciousness. This might not be wrong, but clearly we need to rethink how we conceptualise our own existence in that case.      I think this whole form of reasoning is derived from our intuitive notion of the soul. It sort of feels like there is a magical ghost-in-the-machine that connects our current version of ourselves with a past version of ourselves. That's just not true. What connects our current version of ourselves with our past version of ourselves are our memories, biases, attitudes, etc. What connects us to our past selves is information about our past. Nothing more. Under this framework, if you made an atomic clone of yourself, then you would have no greater claim to being your past self than your atomic clone would. It's counter-intuitive, but I have yet to come across a single sound argument that can contest that reasoning."

A consciousness cycle from the paper I referenced is the time period at which consciousness appears to be updated (about once every 140 ms). The experience of continuity that you have does not entail that there is genuinely such a thing as the continuity of consciousness. In fact, there is solid evidence that this continuity is constructed by your brain, stitched together using memories and knowledge about the world.      What I think about this idea (and if you read my comment carefully, you would have gotten this) is that the problem is much more severe than the author recognises. If we are going to say that we die and are reborn every time we ""lose consciousness"", then we die and are reborn over 400 times a minute."

If however there is a soul, or some continuous-existence then trully you would not be the clone.

If you get damage to the front of your brain, it might affect your attention/concentration, emotional regulation or planning abilities. Damage to other areas (e.g. motor cortex) might mean that your ability to perform meaningful movements is compromised. As you can see, these are very different symptoms, and so it depends on to what extent the damage is localised. If the damage is diffuse (i.e. happens relatively mildly, but over a large area), I imagine you might experience a general slowing, perhaps some memory problems. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, who may suffer from pretty severe widespread cortical atrophy, there are very clear memory problems. However, the sensory areas are generally left intact so they will have intact vision, hearing, etc. It's really hard to tell.      Hope that helps."

neuro,37q00h,guacamully,4,Fri May 29 17:58:46 2015 UTC,"Highlights:  •Two week's methylphenidate (MPH) treatment enhanced LTP in the rat PFC in vivo.  •15–18 days after the end of MPH treatment LTP remained strongly enhanced.  •Five months later LTP was no longer augmented.  •Could not be induced after high MPH doses.  •Doses of MPH that improved maze-learning also enhanced LTP in the same animals.  Basically: it was found that MPH (daytrana, ritalin, concerta, methylin) strengthens synapses and signal transmission (long-term potentiation) at low doses but not at high doses (i think that's what it's saying), and that the effects remain significant weeks after, but decay after a couple of months. Important to note that this was done in rats and isn't necessarily indicative of a human response.  Implications: Could lead to evidence that ADHD meds are capable of strengthening neuronal structure, but can't extend any assumptions beyond effects during dosage and for short periods of time after. Good study to bring up during debates about the effects of adhd meds on the brain, both short-term and long-term."

One thing I wanted to comment on.   but only during dosage and for short periods of time after   Think this is important and might be pertinent to specify periods of time after dosing has ended. For many people taking ADHD meds, they do so for long periods of time. It should be carefully considered how relevant these results are to such individuals given their psychiatric dosing regimens."
neuro,37q00h,IWantToBeADogAsWell,3,Fri May 29 15:42:58 2015 UTC,"From my background and experience working with animals, 1 mg/kg would be considered the ""therapeutic"" dose (positive effects on cognitive ability) while 5 mg/kg would be considered the ""abusive"" dose of methylphenidate (party-drug dose).  Similar results have been observed in animals using learning tasks such as the Morris water maze or fear conditioning, where lower doses increase learning ability while higher doses, such as 10 mg/kg, decrease task acquisition."

neuro,37q00h,live2win,2,Sat May 30 01:28:17 2015 UTC,answers a lot of my questions
neuro,37q00h,limezilla,2,Sat May 30 01:48:09 2015 UTC,"MPH was administered to rats shortly before daily training trials in a radial arm maze starting at postnatal day (PND) 42 and lasting for 15 days. At the end of behavioral testing, LTP was induced in the PFC in vivo at three time-points after the last administration of the drug.   MPH was not given after these 15 days, I know there are significant developmental and regional differences in the stability of long-term potentiation and thus consolidation of learning. Perhaps there is a time period that follows MPH administration that is required to move memory through its consolidation phase. There are various protein kinases involved in this process... it would not surprise me if MPH needed to be administered post-learning.     It would be interesting to do this with more salient and innate forms of learning such as fear conditioning. This would elucidate MPH's effect on Amygdala (innate fear) and Hippocampus (generalized fear, more ""learning"") LTP, which are much better understood.    After completion of 15 days of MPH treatment and maze testing, LTP as described below was induced at 2–3 h, 15–18 days or five months, respectively, after the last test trial. Before inducing LTP animals were left in their usual environment without further treatment and receiving ad libitum diet.   This is another concern I raise, there was no exposure to the treatment OR memory assays after the fifteen days. This type of learning is not like fear conditioning (e.g., shock plate) that was used in the early optogenetic studies. I feel the mice should have had exposure to the learning assays every few days. For example, we may remember the lyrics to a new song if we heard it once a day for a month or two but will I remember those lyrics years after the fact? Not likely... it takes months and months of repeated exposure.   The number of errors and the time to finish the task were analyzed in the radial maze test.   The radial arm maze consists of a central circle from which several arm-like projections radiate. These projections either contain food or do not. Some consider the firing or lack of firing of place cells depending on the arm to be a function of goal-oriented behavior. However, when moving from one arm to another when they both contain food, place cells only fire in one direction, meaning that one cannot attribute firing purely to a goal-approach. That is, perhaps this was the wrong behavioral assay for them to use.   Acquisition, as measured by the number of errors made was significantly slower after a dose of 5 mg/kg with respect to controls.    As someone who takes Adderall because I suffer from ADHD, there is sometimes a euphoric feeling about an hour after I take it which lasts no more than an hour. However, this only happens when it's a higher dosage and once the ephemeral high dissipates I am functioning at a human-level. Meaning, perhaps this dosage was equally, if not more, effective but the timing was off."

neuro,37ojgh,redditobserver777,11,Fri May 29 04:03:42 2015 UTC,"You may want to check out /r/ADHD   As long you do not snort or inject it not at that dosage of 5 to 10 mg.  High amounts of adderall much higher than what is prescribed for ADHD can damaged the brain, especially when you inject or snort it.  What happens is that Dopamine and Norepinephrine trigger another neurotransmitter in certain brain regions that if you get too much at once it is neurotoxic, kinda like serotonin storm with ssris but different.  Now this neurotransmitter is necessary for the brain to function, and it is actually the most common neurotransmitter in the brain.  But too much of it at once in certain parts of nerve cells where its only supposed to be at a small amount of time damages the nerve cell.  What happens is the oxygen on this neurotransmitter is a player, and he designs to sleep with the electrons of other atoms/molecules inside this nerve cell and steal them away.  This in turn can in turn ""imbalance"" the community of other nearby molecules for that molecule who had his electron stolen is no longer stable and disrupts the nearby community.  In other words this is what you hear about those anti-oxidants.  Well your body has natural ways of ""balancing"" this out, to prevent the neurotransmitter from stealing the paired electron unless its meant to do so such as getting rid of certain types of waste and nitrogen.  Thing is if you get too high of a dose at once, especially when you smoke, inject or inhale it (where the drug enters the nerve cells in a few minutes instead of a few hours) it messes everything up.  Now there are actually things you can do help the body balance oxidative pressures even though at that dose you do not need to worry.  Furthermore other ADHD meds such as methyphendiate (aka concerta or ritalian) do not cause this side effect only adderall and other amphetamines.  Vyvanse even though it is an amphetamine should not be possible to do this due to its prodrug delivery mechanism, which involves science on how your body can't use it until certain enzymes deactivate a protein that they encase vyvanse in.  The non stimulant Intuniv and Strattera also aren't neurotoxic.  We have dozens of studies now that ADHD stimulant medications at the doses given ADHD people (for comparison 60mg is the max the FDA recommends per day for Adderall in narcolepsy) does not hurt the brain.  In fact 2 years ago there was a metareview of 29 studies (I will link below) that showed that ADHD meds did not harm the brain and actually helped it become ""more normal looking"" compared to the non ADHD brain.  The likely reason is multiple neurotransmitters help the brain to decide where to wire the synapses of the grey matter and help the white matter superhighway and support system.  Including that same neurotransmitter that too much hurts nerve cells.  Well ADHD meds given to ADHD people who have some neurotransmitters underactive (they make neurotransmitters but they do not use them like they should) kinda helps restores balance.  Summary  Metareview of those 29 studies   In their analysis, the researchers included magnetic resonance imaging -based neuroimaging case-control and placebo controlled studies (N = 29) that examined patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder on and off psychostimulants. Five relevant review studies were also included. “With only a few exceptions, the data on the effect of therapeutic oral doses of stimulant medication suggest attenuation of structural and functional alterations found in unmedicated ADHD subjects relative to findings in controls,” the authors wrote. The protective findings were consistent across the studies despite the heterogeneity of the methodologies. They concluded, *“Our review suggests that therapeutic oral doses of stimulants decrease alterations in brain structure and function in subjects with ADHD relative to unmedicated subjects and controls *   One last thing, there are several hundred things that are neurotoxic to the brain if you have too much or too little (for that substance is neuroprotective).  Furthermore other things if you have too much or too little is also dangerous to the body in general.  Too much water can kill you, eating too much sugar at once without a way to remove the sugar (insulin being the main way) damages brain cells, your circulatory system, your eyes, your kidneys, etc."
neuro,37ojgh,roland00,5,Fri May 29 06:56:36 2015 UTC,"That is a good explanation of the current consensus. I think it is wrong. I sometimes marvel at the lack of thought put into studies like the 29 in that meta-analysis. Those studies use very crude measurements to make very sweeping pronouncements about the drugs. As a scientist, it's alarming and hard to believe.   For example, those studies are making very crude measurements of volumes of certain areas of the brain. The measurements they are making are often inaccurate - for example, many of the studies fail to control for height of the subjects, which correlates strongly with brain volume. Couple this with the fact that they often fail to measure (or at least publish) total brain volume, then it becomes really hard to interpret the finding that very specific parts of the brain are 5% smaller in those with ADHD. And if these measurements are inaccurate, then the entire study is worthless. Then there is the complication that many studies are also looking at patients who are not drug naive.  Putting possible measurement issues aside, it is actually not surprising that MRI scans would find some differences in the composition of the brain of those with ADHD compared to the average person. In fact, you would expect this - after all, there are already behavioral differences so large they are readily observable. If you put the world's top musicians in an MRI machine and compared them to the average, I'm sure you could find many differences in their brain - particularly in areas heavily involved with music and creativity.  So, let's move to perhaps the biggest problem: interpretation of these studies. Assuming the measurements are correct, those with ADHD have smaller brain volumes in certain parts of the brain associated with ADHD. After a period of stimulant use, those areas of the brain show increased volume. This is then interpreted as ""normalizing"" the brain. I have a big problem with that. Measurements of volume tell you nothing about the structure of those changes and whether they are positive or negative. Admittedly, those things basically cannot be measured except on autopsy, so that is a problem for the researchers. But just because we cannot measure those changes does not make it scientifically acceptable or valid to decide that volume changes are a good proxy. As a practical matter, when repeatedly administering drugs that act on dopamine systems, I would be surprised if there were not changes related to areas of the brain rich in dopamine. The results of these studies are not surprising and also not very enlightening.  In fact, I think the more appropriate reaction to finding alterations in brain volume would be concern. The idea that you can change brain structure in some positive manner through administration of low doses of a common drug of abuse is pretty far fetched scientifically. Let's return to the musicians I mentioned before. If MRI finds they have more volume in the ""musical"" parts of the brain, would it make sense to tell them there is something wrong with their brain structure and we should ""normalize"" it by giving them a drug that targets the neurotransmitters rich in that area so as to reduce the volume of that area to ""normal""? I hope everyone can understand how preposterous that would be. Yet because the behavior of someone diagnosed with ADHD is societally unacceptable, we suggest just that process with those people, and we justify it with suspicious and weak pseudoscientific arguments.  Finally, just to note - I see Dr. Biederman on the byline of this study. Anyone with any knowledge of the industry would not trust anything he publishes. He should have had his medical license revoked and his rights to publish in journals revoked a long time ago. Why any journal would publish something by someone who was exposed repeatedly lying to journals, the government, and the public in the past is beyond me. Attaching your credibility to someone who has been shown to have none is a pretty risky move. Then again, I can see why they do it, since association with Dr. Biederman turns on the pharma money spigot.  As for brain damage: not much is known about this. We know that at fairly high doses (but actually not that much higher than therapeutic doses when you control for differences between non-human primates and humans) amphetamines are directly neurotoxic. But there is no definitive evidence that lower doses are not neurotoxic. MRI studies like those 29 discussed above do not measure toxicity in any sort of rigorous manner. And as I said, the most appropriate interpretation of increased brain volume is that it is detrimental. Whether you call that neurotoxic or not depends on how you define that term. That said, I think it is clear that if low doses are toxic, they are much less toxic than higher doses. And they may not be toxic at all, but no one really knows the threshold for when stimulants could become toxic. And to top it off - the brain is very resourceful. A large amount of damage has to occur before it is readily observable. Those with Parkinson's Disease for example do not show symptoms outwardly until the disease is very advanced in the brain. So as a general matter I wouldn't be concerned that taking therapeutic doses of Adderall will ruin your cognition. Just not going to happen in any measurable way. But I am concerned that you would be given Adderall because you are finding it hard to concentrate while studying. Jesus, who doesn't? Are you sleeping? Are you sure? Are you under stress? There is a host of things that can cause difficulty concentrating while studying and Adderall is not the answer to most of them."

neuro,37ojgh,Nwildcat,2,Fri May 29 16:06:29 2015 UTC,"To further my point about the interpretation of these studies, I point you to this study: http://archives.drugabuse.gov/NIDA_Notes/NNVol20N6/Increases.html.  The findings are (and this not the only study) that methamphetamine abusers see increases in brain volume in the same brain regions that are increased in the 29 ADHD studies in that meta-analysis. The difference is that in the case of ADHD, the researchers interpret the increase in brain volume as ""normalizing"" the brain, while in the case of drug abusers, it is presented as a serious abnormality representing neurotoxicity. In the case of Meth abuse, the researchers suggest that increasing brain volume is a result of an inflammatory response and/or abnormal growth of nerve fibers - both of which will increase brain volumes. But in the case of ADHD the assumption is that some great positive change is happening. Everyone should ask themselves why this is. Why do researchers working on similar drugs with similar findings interpret results completely differently?  The other thing to remember is that in the ADHD studies the patients start out with say, 5% smaller volume and by the end of the study they have something like 2% smaller volume, giving rise to the claim that the increase in drugs is ""normalizing"". But the studies are relatively short in duration. What would happen if they continued? Would the patients reach 0% smaller volume? Would it continue until patients now had 5% greater volume? 10% greater? Would the researchers still consider that normalizing? The questions pretty much answer themselves and that is why ADHD researchers are not asking them."

Regarding the interpretation of increased regional volumes in ADHD as ""normalizing"", based on the assumption those regions are substrates for behaviour which is not socially acceptable... You hit a very good point on how cultural factors affect our theories, explanations and orientation toward observation (this should be a pertinent lesson from the history of psychiatry). The interplay of cultural values and scientific apprehension is an understated dimension of importance particularly when it comes to modification (behaviourally & physiologically) as a treatment for an identified 'problem'."

In both those studies it appears that all of the study group subjects were on stimulants for some period of time, and in the first study it is likely a very long time (given the age group). All of the results of these studies could be (and likely are) attributable to the medication and not ADHD.

I don't need to say more than roland00 already has, but I've been medicated for ADHD since I was eight years old and I am now about to graduate (seriously, in the next two weeks) with a Bachelors of Science and I'm heading into neuropharmacology.  Believe me, if this is bad enough that you really need it, you really need it.  If this is something that has been happening even in the same context that you used to focus very well in, ie this is a lack of concentration regardless of what it is you're doing or what the task is, yeah, this is a good thing.  However, you have left out some key information.  5 to 10 milligrams isn't much, but that depends on what kind of Adderall you're taking.  Is it time-release, or is it instant?  In other words, are you taking one pill in the morning for your whole day, or are you taking multiple pills throughout the day?  Further, if the answer is 'multiple,' are you taking it at regular intervals or are you taking it essentially 'as needed' when you're losing focus?  I'm assuming your doctor didn't tell you to do that last one, but I've seen people do it.  Don't be that guy!  That's a fast track to ""Boy, I feel good.  Gee, I bet I'd be even better if I took even more!"" and even though you may not feel that way now, it's a stimulant which acts primarily on your dopaminergic systems, ie the major player in your neurochemical reward system.  Don't think it could happen to you?  Neurochemistry says, it could.  That being said, Adderall can be a wonder drug if you take it properly, don't go over your dosage, and are consistently and regularly taking your medication.  Your ADHD could go away and not really rear its ugly head for months or even years if your dosage is just right, and that's a feeling that is well worth it.  Keep in mind, it will come back.  You will have to switch to a different medication or dosage at some point, once this dose no longer works, but if that's the case, you have many options, and once those are up, you could switch back to Adderall, and other options like Methylphenidate can be just as useful.  I've personally switched back and forth a few times, but only a handful in the past fourteen years or so since I started taking medication.   Will I lose my natural potential for cognition?   Absolutely not.  If you go off of your meds, you will still be able to think, you won't suddenly become stupider, but it will mean that you will revert back to not being able to concentrate.  I won't lie, yes, there is some entrenching of the problem as your brain will normalize itself to the presence of a stimulant, but the primary effects are from your brain starting to normalize its dopamine and norepinephrine levels.  At your dosage, abuse is all but impossible unless you are starting to shovel 5 milligram or 10 milligram pills into yourself very often.  If you need more information on this, not to toot my own horn, but I've posted extensively about this before and it is my field of study and all..."

I admit, enantiomeric ratios in amphetamine salts are not specifically something I've looked into, but it really seems like if there are differences between them, it is mostly idiosyncratic and has more to do with the people taking them than the differences themselves.  So yes, I would go out on a limb and say that there is a distinct possibility that Adderall's enduring popularity is mostly due to brand recognition and good marketing.  There is nothing particularly special about Adderall over Dexedrine in a chemical sense."
neuro,37ojgh,Laozen,2,Sun May 31 21:40:38 2015 UTC,"Anybody that have questions on amphetamine and how they effect the brain should watch this video by Dr. Nora Volkow the Director of Research at the National Institute of Drug Abuse part of the US government's NIH.  Video Link  Pretty much if you see anything studying the long term effects of drugs on the brain 50/50 it is done by the NIH and done by Nora Volkow.  She is probably the leading expert in the world on dopamine and reward circuits.  The talk I linked to above is talking about how ADHD brains are different and how they benefit from medication.  She also explains how the way a medicine is taken determines a lot.  If you take a medicine very quickly what sciencists call ""phasic release"" it activates the sensory motor area of the brain and the motor circuit of the basal ganglia.  If you take it slowly and gradually it activates the association circuit of the basal ganglia.  If you want to look at a picture, whether your body is remembering and creating habits using circuits that go to the putamen (motor movement with direct stimulus / response and association) or the caudate (abstract thinking and abstract association)  Here she is talking about Amphetamine and if it can damage the brain..  Notice only if you take it very quickly and large dosages does this happen."
neuro,37ojgh,roland00,2,Sat May 30 05:17:35 2015 UTC,"If that dose works for you and continues giving you the desired effects, good. When going up to a higher dose, you will permanently lose the ability to feel the same degree of effects at the lower dose. However, some people require higher doses for various reasons. For me, I had been prescribed chlomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, for about half a year before a psychiatrist had me go off, wait a few weeks to return to baseline, and go on adderall instead -- for some reason, chlomipramine had changed my baseline chemistry and lower doses of Adderall did nothing but cause the physical effects such vascular constriction, so I was eventually worked up to 60mg a day (30mg twice a day). Let me say, that is not a comfortable dose for most people to be on, but it worked.   Amphetamine has been called 'neurotoxic' before by some researchers; however, I can't say there's ever been an abnormality in my mental functioning that hasn't returned to normal from taking a break for a few days/weeks from the medication - and yes, most doctors will tell you that you can and probably should take breaks from taking it every day.  When I did feel abnormal, it would usually be when I was sleep deprived and hadn't been keeping strict to a routine dosing schedule.  As for your overall brain chemistry and just your psychology; adderall is going to cause some changes, some bad, and they can be long-term.   It can't be said that it's in any way a risk-free medication; it's a powerful stimulant, and one with a reputation.  Don't take it with other stimulants like caffeine; the physical stress on your body compounds (rather than just being additive) when stimulants are taken together.  Another thing that should be kept in mind is that amphetamine has a half-life roughly around 12 hours. That means if 10mg is in your system, 12 hours later there will still be 5mg even though you may not feel any effects present. This is a definite drawback, as it stays built up in your system and disrupts sleep on some level at any active dose.  Also PS, never ever EVER take or drink anything with St John's Wort in it while prescribe Adderall; it's an ingredient in this friggin ""Night-Time"" tea sold in most grocery stores and it's not apparent on the label - I thought I was just drinking tea with some valerian root in it, but it made me go psychotic and not sleep for a week, so, really warms me to know the FDA just allows stuff like that to be thrown in random things at the grocery store haphazardly without even being mentioned on the front of the packaging even."

neuro,37iuv9,memento22mori,3,Wed May 27 23:15:06 2015 UTC,"There is no one spot that has the body schema, it is instead a mesh of networks involving the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe.  To put it in simple terms   The parietal cortex is like the stage of a play, but do not imagine a play with physical people but instead imagine something more like a holodeck or an animated feature like toystory.  These are cordinates, and sensations, but you need the next part to make them living. The Frontal Cortex is the part of the brain that evaluates the stage, and rewrites the story.  It figures out what it cares about long term as goals (anterior prefrontal cortex), it is mindful of the present (medial frontal cortex), it notices changes and tries to assign signficance (cingulate cortex but more of the anterior cingulate in the frontal side of the brain), it evaluates the importance of the changes compared to other stimuli and its goals it is storing in the APFC, it then tries to plan and problem solve and find ways to achieve these goals (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), it tries to identify things in its environment that is useful by moving its attention in an automatic undirected way to a more directed way the more focus you have, and then it tries to create abstract chain of events (supplementary motor and premotor) and then it creates the chain of events and sends the signals to the subcortical area to refine, except during all those frontal lobe stages it was talking to the parietal lobe and the temporal lobe and the subcortical structures and refines it continuously, and then the thoughts go down the nerves to the muscles. The parietal lobe is the ""stage"" but there are a lot of things on the stage.  It gets damn complicated really quick with the parietal lobe and which part does which.  Effectively the precuneus is the closest thing we have to you in the parietal lobe, but in reality the parietal lobe sees you in the context of your environment.  There is no ""ghost in the machine"" but instead you as part of your body and your body as part of the world.  For example the IPS intraparietal sulculus is the 3d coordinates for your eye movements, SPL which is tied to Precuneus is 3d coordinates of your body movements like what can you reach, IPL is more of the abstract interpertation of stimuli.  This is not taking into account things like sensory information, this is not taking into account the parietal lobe regions that measure salience of objects, or measuring realitve size and whether your hands can interact with it from a size perspective, let alone from a dexterity perspective.     In other words you need to think of the brain more as a series of parts that work together as a team, like ants and together they form one mind, one being, one colony.  There is a theory on the brain called the small world hypothesis.  1 brain region is not connected to every region, but because of the complex mesh and how complicated the brain is that you can easily get to any part of the brain within 2 or 3 jumps, using important brain areas called Hubs.  In other words think of paper rock scissors.  There is no one master, but instead a network that intertwines and bomines in a yin yang fashion, similar to how our muscles work. Almost every muscle in the entire body has an opposite it works together as a team for fine motor control.  The active muscle pulls the other muscle and the bone/flesh and the 2nd muscle prevents it from over exerting itself.  The 2nd muscle can also instantly seize control if its necessary to create change.  The brain works the same way.  This is one example theory of how the brain interconnects multiple regions, involving a frontal parietal hub.   Article about Paper: Brain's flexible hub network helps humans adapt: Switching stations route processing of novel cognitive tasks Paper in Nature that came out last year:Multi-task connectivity reveals flexible hubs for adaptive task control]   Pay attention to this picture   So the Anterior Prefrontal Cortex is the frontal robe region of this flexible ""hub"" of the frontal parietal network that integrates the goals of the current present vs the goals of the long term. The Dorsal Attention is conscious directed focus attention towards a goal, on purpose.  Whenver you use the Dorsal Attention System it is cognitively demanding and exhausting. The Default Mode is the mode we are in most of the day, it is the background noise where we do things automatically without thinking.  It is used for mind wandering, and internalizing our past and making it useful, finding insights while we go about our day.  If the DAN network is too focused we can't be creative, but if its focused just enough the Default Mode provides creativity and notices new ideas.  Part of the Default Mode is being mindful of the present situation so you can always switch to another mode. Visual and Auditory networks give you new information about the environment The Stable Task Control (Cingulo Opercular Network) monitors if you are making progress towards your goal, and the Salience Network notices changes and gives a guess on the value and significance and thus the saliency of the tasks The Ventral Attention is the automatic, emotional, instinctual brain, you do not activate it, instead it automatically activates if you notice a change due to other networks.  It evaluates the information the saliency network sends it and then compares the value of this new information, does it benefit or hurt you, and compares it towards your current goals stored in the frontal parietal network, and that the default mode is working on (aka no goals, just automatic living) or if you are focused (the dorsal attention network is working on.) The motor network is how the various attention networks plan out strings of behavior converting abstract thought into physical sequences which it then sends out. The subcortical structures fine tune all these networks, make bad ideas less bad, and suggestiong ideas which the frontal and parietal networks will consider and accept and reject.     All of this and we only talked about half of the brain, this is just the ""goal directed"" attention designed to improve your wellbeing, not the stuff related to breathing, hormones, emotional arousal, long term memory, etc.    Human beings are not just 1 magical brain region just appeared but a collection of these networks working together as a team.  For example the FPN is very new and while other animals have it, they do not have it as much as we do.  Yet other brain regions are also improved in various aspects of the frontal lobe, the parietal, to some extent the vision and long term memory.  I would argue one of the most important changes is the development of the striatum of the basal ganglia, a subcortical structure.  One area of the striatum is the caudate and is involved with thinking inside your mind, instead of doing with motor action (putamen).  The caudate and the putamen, and the ventrial striatum (much of the brains rewad center) fine tune motor movement, eye movement, cold associative cognition, your short and long term goals, your emotional responses, and change impulsivity and compulsivity into new possibilities and re-evaluating stimulus.  This subcortical region can be thought as a good conductor or director.  He may not be the writter, or the person with the inital idea, or the producer who gathers everyone together, but the striatum fine tunes all these behaviors and have us work together as a well run machine.  Well the thing that is more developed in humans is the caudate, instead of doing instantly, we in conjunctions with other brain regions think before we act.  Have this brain region not work well and you have many mental disorders (that involve other behaviors as well) such as involuntary motor movements called tics and tourettes, ocd which is both motor and cognition (obsessions and compulsions), attention deficit disorder, bipolar, schizophrenia, autism, to some extent depression and anxiety, stuttering, teeth grinding, dystonia, parkinson's disease, huntington's, etc."

neuro,37iuv9,solidsoap,1 point,Thu May 28 00:44:38 2015 UTC,"I've been reading a lot of studies related to Early Stone Age tool usage, and I'm primarily interested in what's described in the sentence below. They describe ""visuospatial representations of the tool+body system"" and say that it may be related to the right SMG, but it's not clear to me if they're saying the right SMG is a part of a network that allows for the visuospatial representations of the tool+body system or if it's the most important part in this representation, or they don't know for sure.       (b) Late Acheulean toolmaking      The most striking result of the comparison between expert Oldowan and Late Acheulean toolmaking was an increase in the RH activity, including both SMG and new clusters in the right ventral premotor cortex (PMv, BA 6) and the inferior prefrontal gyrus (BA 45) (table 2, figure 5). This probably reflects an increasingly critical role for the RH–left-hand system in hand axe production as well as the involvement of more complex and protracted technical action sequences (cf. Hartmann et al. 2005). The increased right SMG activation extends the trend seen in expert Oldowan knapping and is best interpreted as reflecting further increases in the importance of visuospatial representations of the tool+body system in this task. Similarly, the novel activation of the right PMv may be attributed to increased motor demands relating to the manipulation, support and precise orientation of the larger Acheulean hand axe. Precise and forceful left-hand grips become increasingly critical as the piece is thinned in order to absorb shock and prevent accidental breakage, a concern that is much less salient in Oldowan knapping.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2606694/"

Do not enter their space uninvited, do not harm animal if touching it like stroking it, be mindful of its movements, understand relative and its ability to do you harm and vice versa.  While humans are much more complicated in the behaviors we can do in the present, let alone how our present actions effect the future.  The brain areas that keep track of all the theoretical possibilities are the areas diminished with autism.  Furthermore Autism is often describe as local network hyperactivity, but white matter far network underactivity.  Well to predict all these possibilities and whether we should escalate our arousal and be vigilant requires brain areas on every side of the brain, front to back, top to down, left to right and this is precisely what autism destroys.  This logic also explains why many autistic people are introverts, and love routine, too much change  but also them being aware of possible change stresses them out."
