Libertarian,3e29ms,Cycle_time,22,Tue Jul 21 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"I think what the department did is atrocious.   But this article along with many others recently posted is an insult to the field of journalism. The author's bias is clear: it's full of weasel words and he quotes the officer who was fired but no other individuals in the department.   It is no question that if fellow officers blow the whistle on their peers for breaking the law, they will be shunned, and their careers will be over.   Right out of the gate, the author opens the article with a blanket statement.   an elderly mentally ill black man   It must be a game now to see how many labels indicating minority/vulnerable status can be placed on a victim in articles like this.   He knew that officer William Hamilton Wilson, who had a brutal history, was going to be on the extraction team.   Uncited and unqualified statement. The author could at least have given us the number and severity of Mr. Wilson's previous incidents. Instead he is described only as having ""a brutal history"", whatever that means.   But not being a threat was of no concern to officer Wilson, who liked to sadistically inflict pain upon restrained inmates.   Another disgustingly weasel worded statement, even if it's true. Is the author a journalist or a judge? A journalist has no business labeling someone without hearing an account of the other side. Wilson was tried in 2009; if the judge or jury had included this statement in their remarks, that would be one of the few appropriate contexts to include a statement such as this. ""In his notes, Judge John Doe concluded that based on the evidence, Officer Wilson clearly sought to 'sadistically inflict pain upon restrained inmates.'""   Pisciotta and his wife were forced to sell everything they owned   Hyperbole. I'm sure they didn't sell everything, nor were they forced; Mr. Pisciotta simply decided that his experiences with the department made it no longer worth being a peace officer. This is still a bad thing, but with this experience he would likely have easily found a position as a sergeant or higher in any number of small police departments around the country that actually have some integrity. That being said, I don't blame him for trading his badge for a plow.   As for the officers who were involved in participating in brutality, covering up torture, and framing their coworker, they have all been receiving their scheduled promotions as normal.   This is completely unnecessary, unsourced and unqualified. Who has been promoted? When? Under what terms and qualifications?  It is complete and utter folly to think this is the kind of ""journalism"" that people think will win us back our liberties. Any reasonably educated person needs only read the first sentence of this article to see where it's going. When that happens, they'll close the tab and move on to better quality news."
Libertarian,3e29ms,fuhry,6,Tue Jul 21 15:36:50 2015 UTC,We are entering the future of journalism where it's about clicks views and reposts and biased news is better at it because people like when someone agrees with their opinion and right now cops are the bad guys.  So anything anti-cop related goes to the top.  Not trying to jump on the cops side or anything but we like anything the confirms our bias.

Libertarian,3e2xu5,aflynnftw,4,Tue Jul 21 15:34:21 2015 UTC,"Copy past from his website    So I am announcing an over $2 trillion tax cut that would repeal the entire IRS tax code—more than 70,000 pages—and replace it with a low, broad-based tax of 14.5% on individuals and businesses. I would eliminate nearly every special-interest loophole. The plan also eliminates the payroll tax on workers and several federal taxes outright, including gift and estate taxes, telephone taxes, and all duties and tariffs. I call this “The Fair and Flat Tax.”   President Obama talks about “middle-class economics,” but his redistribution policies have led to rising income inequality and negative income gains for families. Here’s what I propose for the middle class: The Fair and Flat Tax eliminates payroll taxes, which are seized by the IRS from a worker’s paychecks before a family ever sees the money. This will boost the incentive for employers to hire more workers, and raise after-tax income by at least 15% over 10 years.  Here’s why we have to start over with the tax code. From 2001 until 2010, there were at least 4,430 changes to tax laws—an average of one “fix” a day—always promising more fairness, more simplicity or more growth stimulants. And every year the Internal Revenue Code grows absurdly more incomprehensible, as if it were designed as a jobs program for accountants, IRS agents and tax attorneys.  Polls show that “fairness” is a top goal for Americans in our tax system. I envision a traditionally All-American solution: Everyone plays by the same rules. This means no one of privilege, wealth or with an arsenal of lobbyists can game the system to pay a lower rate than working Americans.  Most important, a smart tax system must turbocharge the economy and pull America out of the slow-growth rut of the past decade. We are already at least $2 trillion behind where we should be with a normal recovery; the growth gap widens every month. Even Mr. Obama’s economic advisers tell him that the U.S. corporate tax code, which has the highest rates in the world (35%), is an economic drag. When an iconic American company like Burger King wants to renounce its citizenship for Canada because that country’s tax rates are so much lower, there’s a fundamental problem.  Another increasingly obvious danger of our current tax code is the empowerment of a rogue agency, the IRS, to examine the most private financial and lifestyle information of every American citizen. We now know that the IRS, through political hacks like former IRS official Lois Lerner, routinely abused its auditing power to build an enemies list and harass anyone who might be adversarial to President Obama’s policies. A convoluted tax code enables these corrupt tactics.  My tax plan would blow up the tax code and start over. In consultation with some of the top tax experts in the country, including the Heritage Foundation’s Stephen Moore, former presidential candidate Steve Forbes and Reagan economist Arthur Laffer, I devised a 21st-century tax code that would establish a 14.5% flat-rate tax applied equally to all personal income, including wages, salaries, dividends, capital gains, rents and interest. All deductions except for a mortgage and charities would be eliminated. The first $50,000 of income for a family of four would not be taxed. For low-income working families, the plan would retain the earned-income tax credit.  I would also apply this uniform 14.5% business-activity tax on all companies—down from as high as nearly 40% for small businesses and 35% for corporations. This tax would be levied on revenues minus allowable expenses, such as the purchase of parts, computers and office equipment. All capital purchases would be immediately expensed, ending complicated depreciation schedules.  The immediate question everyone asks is: Won’t this 14.5% tax plan blow a massive hole in the budget deficit? As a senator, I have proposed balanced budgets and I pledge to balance the budget as president.  Here’s why this plan would balance the budget: We asked the experts at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation to estimate what this plan would mean for jobs, and whether we are raising enough money to fund the government. The analysis is positive news: The plan is an economic steroid injection. Because the Fair and Flat Tax rewards work, saving, investment and small business creation, the Tax Foundation estimates that in 10 years it will increase gross domestic product by about 10%, and create at least 1.4 million new jobs.  And because the best way to balance the budget and pay down government debt is to put Americans back to work, my plan would actually reduce the national debt by trillions of dollars over time when combined with my package of spending cuts.  The left will argue that the plan is a tax cut for the wealthy. But most of the loopholes in the tax code were designed by the rich and politically connected. Though the rich will pay a lower rate along with everyone else, they won’t have special provisions to avoid paying lower than 14.5%.  The challenge to this plan will be to overcome special-interest groups in Washington who will muster all of their political muscle to save corporate welfare. That’s what happened to my friend Steve Forbes when he ran for president in 1996 on the idea of the flat tax. Though the flat tax was surprisingly popular with voters for its simplicity and its capacity to boost the economy, crony capitalists and lobbyists exploded his noble crusade.  Today, the American people see the rot in the system that is degrading our economy day after day and want it to end. That is exactly what the Fair and Flat Tax will do through a plan that’s the boldest restoration of fairness to American taxpayers in over a century."

The multiculturalism that is being preached these days seems to tell people not to assimilate, but to instead hold on to their norms and start making demands on the host nation to accomodate them. (go to a gov't office in L.A. - shit is in like 80 different languages) That's a recipe for disaster, as not all cultures are compatible, nor should they be in close proximity, for everyone's sake. It's also how a nation slowly crumbles.  What I'm referring to, actually, isn't just muslims. It's any culture whose norms are incompatible.  I personally feel it would've been smart for us to have never allowed people in this country en masse unless they could demonstrate the ability to be self-sufficient, or there was a need for their labor.

The same ""they'll never assimilate"" has been recited since before the founding of the country.   Ben Franklin himself wrote:   Those who come hither are generally of the most ignorant Stupid Sort of their own Nation…and as few of the English understand the German Language, and so cannot address them either from the Press or Pulpit, ’tis almost impossible to remove any prejudices they once entertain…Not being used to Liberty, they know not how to make a modest use of it…I remember when they modestly declined intermeddling in our Elections, but now they come in droves, and carry all before them, except in one or two Counties…In short unless the stream of their importation could be turned from this to other colonies, as you very judiciously propose, they will soon so out number us, that all the advantages we have will not in My Opinion be able to preserve our language, and even our Government will become precarious.  Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a Colony of Aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us instead of our Anglifying them, and will never adopt our Language or Customs, any more than they can acquire our Complexion.   Yet, somehow Germans did assimilate. There was no forced assimilation, but it happened.  And answer me one thing: With immigration laws as they are, where an illegal is likely to be deported out of the country - not for any force or violence committed against others, but simply for not having govt's permission to physically be here - do you think that, for example, Mexicans are going to be more likely or less likely to interact with the greater American population and thus to assimilate, or that they will remain cloistered with those with which they are familiar, they know, and they trust?"

There was simply beneficial reasons and incentives for them to assimilate. Those benefits and incentives are still there - however, current immigration laws place a massive disincentive against attempting to assimilate.   The definition of multiculturalism, which is what's being foisted upon us, is that people don't have to assimilate.   If you're complaining about govt's approach to multiculturalism, then fine. I agree. Damn the govt. If you're talking about society in general, I think you're wrong. It's about simply respecting other's cultures. In the absence of govt force, nobody would be forcibly taxed to fund various cultural sensitivity projects or be required to accommodate cultural practices. If a business wants to accommodate it, then great. If it does not, then ok. This is another case where govt causes the true underlying problem.   If you're here legally, you have nothing to worry about.   Same bastardized logic as, ""If you've got nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear""  The question is why should anyone have to get govt's permission slip in order to simply physically exist in this country?

From Teddy Roosevelt: “In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the person's becoming in every facet an American, and nothing but an American...There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag... We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language... and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.”    If you're complaining about govt's approach to multiculturalism, then fine. I agree. Damn the govt.    Good to know.    It's about simply respecting other's cultures.   I would say that not all cultures and norms are deserving of respect. Hate to just go with the obvious, but if a woman is wearing a burqa because she fears her husband beating the shit out of her if she doesn't, I don't respect that norm. And I don't want it here. Not now, not ever. Go back to wherever.    Same bastardized logic as, ""If you've got nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear""   Not really. I'm not advocating violating peoples' rights. If you're here illegally, you should be uncomfortable here. You weren't invited and entered in violation of our laws. So literally, if you're here legally.....you have nothing to worry about. If you snuck in....sorry about your luck. That's my view anyways.    The question is why should anyone have to get govt's permission slip in order to simply physically exist in this country?    Because we have a giant behemoth of a welfare state we already can't afford, finite resources, limited job opportunities, and frankly, there are people in this world that would nuke us if they could. This is why most all the countries on earth that can control their borders, do, including the one to our south that has far more draconian penalties for entering their country illegally."

But so too is multiculturalism fine as long as it's not encouraging the use of force.    if a woman is wearing a burqa because she fears her husband beating the shit out of her if she doesn't, I don't respect that norm.    How do you know if the woman is wearing the burqa because she believes in the tradition vs because she fears her husband beating her?   Respecting different cultural norms simply means tolerating, not being forced to accommodate. If a customer wants to wear a burqa into my restaurant, I will respect her cultural norms to do so - that is, I will not refuse to serve her or ban her from my restaurant. If she wants me to NOT serve ham, then I'm sorry, she will need to find a different restaurant. If she wants to apply to be my employee, when I have a dress code which conflicts with that tradition, then I'm sorry, while I will respect your right to your tradition, it will not work with my needs. These are all fine. But if multiculturalism pushes that I must remove ham from my menu or to hire her in spite of the dress code conflict, then it certainly becomes a problem.   Because we have ...   Ok, but just recognize that you're advocating that because govt has created a massive welfare class and has engaged in foreign policy that has created threats to us here at home, that we should encourage govt to be even more draconian in its immigration laws in order to allow the further perpetuation of its failed welfare and foreign policy programs."

It would result in the poor basically not being able to get properly married due to the increased cost of drawing up a marriage contract.   There is also the issue of how you would sell this to the wider population, as it is intentionally making their lives more difficult with little individual gain.  In order for the state to recognise the contract with specific benefits e.g. Not being obliged to testify against each other, shared assets, child custody arrangements, there would need to be some guidelines on what the contract to be.   Not to mention that the court would be clogged up with petitions against unenforceable provisions that many would put in, e.g. A Christian couple may attempt to make the contract unbreakable or indissoluble which would be a problem if they ever tried to break up."

Dividing shared ""marriage"" assets is no different than dividing shared business assets if a partnership is dissolved. Due to vast numbers of births out of wedlock, the courts are well versed in resolving child custody disputes. The courts need to honor what is mutual agreed to by free people.

You are essentially proposing that already married couples lose all their existing benifits and protections of marriage, which you will be hard pressed to gain support for, as there seems to be little to be gained, other than ideological purity.  I also would suspect that the courts will be jammed with extra litigation over the thousands of variations of marriage contracts, rather than one clear cut uniform legal definition and clauses.   I also think that in practise, if there is no legal benefit to getting married, a lot less couples will marry. The policy of offering marriage specific benefits and protections serves a practical benefit to married couples.

If that were to happen though, it has been recently held that a police officer can only detain you a reasonable time in order to wait for a dog sniffer to get there.

Lobbying for regulations restricting competitors currently has a good enough return on investment that competing against them. This incentivizes using political pressure, via regulations, to restrict new entrants into markets.  If the government could not/did not influence the market as much, businesses would be less likely to lobby for special treatment. Note that libertarian and free market oriented candidates don't pull in nearly as much in donations as the average republican or democrat."

The problems I see are this, we are where we are.  Solutions have to be practical for today's environment.  Today, lobbyists spend crazy amounts of money to ensure that politics will stay in money.  Are you going to out spend the lobbyists with someone's magic money and change the laws, the Constitution?  If so, what are the proposed changes you suggest to laws, or the Constitution that will get politics out of money and vice versa?"
Libertarian,3e31e9,ninjaluvr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"A lot of the problem comes from the expansion of the 'commerce clause' and how it has been used to grant the federal government more regulatory authority over local matters. Some of the problem comes from regulations that seem well intentioned but get used to restrict the behavior of businesses in ways that aren't as beneficent (title ix, Ada, aca, etc.) by allowing political pressures to exert influence everywhere.  The only step to take is to try to educate people on how the government uses these things to coerce compliance. Passing laws doesn't necessarily make things better."

But I think my argument boils down to, get a thick skin and argue against bigots if you don't think like them. NEVER EVER censor their opinions in law. Any company like reddit can tell them/bigots/liberals to fuck off because it can be bad for business.  Free speech is not some popularity contest or a hugbox for liberals who can't stand the heat.

There is no need to ban those subreddits.  That's the beauty of Reddit and freedom of choice - YOU are the one who chooses which content to view, and if you never want to see hateful content, you never have to.  Free speech and libertarianism DO work on reddit.  It's called voting with your clicks.  Visit the subreddits that do a good job of keeping out hate speech, and these subreddits will become more prominent and grow.

Worse, having a light hand with trolls actually stifles free and lively discourse. Allowing a handful of people to come into a room screaming the N-word or trying to re-traumatize rape victims shuts down open and authentic conversations in the same way that someone projectile vomiting all over the place will shut a party down: People are going to leave rather than put up with it.    ...   On the contrary, as this debacle has shown, the “free market”—run by a bunch of white guys who don’t understand the toll of internet harassment on women and people of color—ran off a CEO who was taking steps to preserve Reddit’s business future by making it a more welcoming place to a variety of people.   That is the core of her argument.  First, I am not surprised that her link to the example of people re-traumatizing rape victims is a 404.  What she is really stating is that, in her opinion, the only way to have free discourse is for people who share her definition of hate speech and bigotry, and who ""understand the toll of internet harassment on women and people of color"" (ie share her social and political worldview), actively censor others.  Only someone blind to their own prejudice could conclude with such casual confidence that is so easy to identify unacceptable comments without stepping on the toes of innocents.

That refusal creates a market opportunity for a business willing to serve the excluded population.   Reddit is choosing to accept more users, rather than fewer, by not banning large groups of people.   Until you can show that allowing various sub-reddits is driving away large numbers of users (as in more than they would ban), you can't show that Reddit's decisions is costing them business.

To translate it to a more contemporary situation, if a person's pack animal were to run away to up North, and the northerners weren't going to give back the pack animal, the southerner would want their property back.  What right is it theirs to prevent it?  In fact, it seems as though the northern states were infringing upon the individual's rights, since slaves weren't considered individuals.    Trying to look at the situation from that time period is hard, but when you do, it makes more sense.

I think the core of libertarianism is a rules based approach to law making, with generally applied rules, not discretionary unpredictable law by fiat. I wonder if the gut instinct hatred for fiat money comes from the actions by fiat, not the technical problems of a fiat currency. We have huge foreign exchange markets, so the dollar price is accurate. The real change has to be how we regulate (ie we should regulate less) and how the fed is run.

Libertarian,3e0arf,gbimmer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:49:42 2015 UTC,"You obviously have never closely studied the issue if your only evidence of the inevitability of monopoly is anecdotal. Regulation isnt a magic wand you dont seem to understand what that word actually entails. Many close studies have been done over the last 2 centuries about the concentration of industry. The only companies to sustain monopolies over long periods of time are companies with significant government help. Microsoft would still have been large, but patents help keep out competition. But even as ""evil"" as you seem to think the microsoft monopoly was, it was very short lived. Facebook can only be a monopoly so long as we all want to use it, and they can't block new sites. They can buy out new sites, but that isn't monopolistic behavior in the slightest. To anyone whos actually looked at the issue of law (how theyre written and enforced) and market concentration, the question isn't how government prevents monopolies but rather how do you stop government action from establishing monopolies! Licensure, patents, import and export restrictions, and prohibitive and unnecessary litigation all function to help existing market participants at the expense of everyone. Its not what is the right ""amount"" as if it were some quantifiable thing. its what is the role of law in disputes over property and contract generally and narrowly. Anyone who tells you other whise is a demagogue. Regulators are subject to the same if not more nefarious incentives available to owners and workers of private enterprise.

There are tradeoffs, as with everything and some pie in the sky fantasy about regulators on white horse to save the day is very naive. It is foolish to criticize the actions of market participants without looking at the rules and how theyre enforced. Political self interest is not more nobler somehow than economic self interest. The point is that any economic system is an outgrowth of the restrictions and protections of the law. And some make sense. Others dont. Most of this is civil law anyway and has its basis in british common law. Contract law means something. It isnt random or at least shouldnt be. When you actually learn about regulation and study the actions of those enforcing and writing such law, you will be much more skeptical about their supposed efficacy in shaping the market place, let alone the unintended consequences and costs imposed on others.

Libertarian,3e0arf,ProAim,2,Tue Jul 21 00:46:28 2015 UTC,"The crash was CAUSED by the instability of the fiat currency in the first place.   Yes! But this is the ELI5. (A good thing)   To expand on this, banks controlled the money through debt now and then. During the Bretton-Woods and earlier time periods banks would offer lots of credit and then after a while offer very little credit. This would create all kinds of turmoil, false demand, bankruptcy, and enable banks to buy assets or foreclose. Gold was more stable than many investments at the time. Gold was unfortunately susceptible to this manipulation, because it is, as you all know, scarce. Fiat dollars are more susceptible, however, because people then were less susceptible to crashes. Average people saved up to half their income. So if the economy crashed and you were not invested. ¯|(ツ)/¯   Now, on the other hand, it sucks because if you had saved a ton of money in the 60s Value: $12,520.65, its worth less now. Hint that would be $100,000.00 in 2015 dollars, but it is not. It is worth only 12,520 dollars and 65 shitty zinc cents. So... you put it in the market or a house, because if you keep it as cash you are going to be poor. But the consistent rush out of fiat inflate the housing market, causing instability, because who can afford a $650,000 previous meth-lab starter home in CA and stay afloat if they have unforeseen medical problems, while paying off college debt, because manual labor/mfg jobs were pushed out of country by inflation?   Likelihood is the crashes are not over. Major, huge crashes occur as a symptom of either corruption or a genuine lack of understanding reality. They slowly build like avalanches. People search and search for the snow flake that caused it, but like /r/gbimmer said, you can't fix the underlying instability with a fiat bandaid. I personally don't think we have removed corruption or gotten real with the debt we have. Given a long enough timeline the survival rate for every fiat currency goes to zero, leaving you at the mercy of whatever other foreign power controls the most gold. So, I guess the answer is determined by how long you live.  Edit: I know gold isn't magic, it is valuable now only because it is shiny and at some point it became the backup currency for nations to trade each other with whenever their currency was crap.

To be fair, most libertarians in the past (i.e. Ron Paul's Free Competition in Currency Act) have argued for the repeal of any money system cartelized by legal tender laws, be it a gold standard, bimetalism, or some other commodity backing. Lots of monetary base manipulation is still possible under any of those standards (see Rothbard, A History of Money and Banking in the U.S. ).  As for price stability: yes, it is an important feature of money to be stable in price and quantity. Right now gold is not performing as a monetary instrument, so it's ""price"" is not indicative of its potential performance as one. It is a commodity and a speculative hedge. The gold crash does not indicate that it would under perform with respect to federal notes under economic conditions where it is not punished as a monetary instrument."

While the US is certainly the largest economy in the world, unless all economies of the world switched, I'm not sure I see why the US using it to back their currency would change the nature how gold is treated on the market. It is, after all, something that is used in other industries.  I think, overall, I really don't even see what is special about gold to begin with. Other than aesthetic value and its industrial uses, there is nothing intrinsically valuable about gold.

The value doesn't come from a bunch of weirdos with coin collections, it doesn't even come from the LIBOR, it comes from the fact that it is much harder to make fake gold than fake dollars. So it is the currency of 'untrustworthy' countries. Your view might be biased by your country of origin. Gold outperformed every other currency in the world, last year, except the dollar.

People were afraid of inflation of the USD, so they bought gold and created a bubble.  Now they aren't as afraid, so they start selling.

Like many libertarian policies things would likely go to shit fast if immediately implemented.  I think the point of the gold standard would be to stop the government from so freely dicking around with the value of money people already have. As a side note - Any natural resource would work, and would have similar problems to gold.   I think the ""ideal libertarian solution"" would have many non government currency providers keeping up exchange rates between other currencies and natural resources as they deemed fit. But this comes withdrawal am obvious slew of practical issues.   Again, great question. Made me think and I don't have an excellent answer. I think libertarians can see the issue with government controlled currency a lot clearer than we can see a solution."

Even men give this argument. As an excuse I guess. I never meant to take her in my car and traumatized her. She wore so little, I just couldn't stop.   Feminists (not misandrists or tumblrinas mind you) say that men and women have equal faculties, and that men might not be so violent, stupid, or undisciplined that they might be able to see even a somewhat sexual display without ripping off their pants and committing a serious felony.   Other manly things like men not being able to be single dads because they prey on children sexually, or might be emotionally harassed by co workers or other students in school, those are fought by feminists, who think men are equal and some pretend not to be in order to continue oppression (the way I might pretend to not know Spanish so someone else will deal with the Hispanic customer)"

They'd say how brave/strong he is to take care of those children all on his own and not think twice about it.  There are some bad cultural attitudes, would be nice if those attitudes were a little less common. To me, it seems like those attitudes contributed to the bad decision to arrest her for doing what she could without any harm befalling her children. Bring the kids with her but step away within easy line of sight not that far away, she's abandoning them in public to any predator that wants them. Leave the kids unattended at home, she's risking their awful death due to some unlikely event they've probably been taught not to do. Cancels the interview, she's willfully staying unemployed to force the burden of her immoral lifestyle on society. Pay someone $10 an hour to watch the kids so she can engage in basic economic activity when family members are unavailable to help with the kids for free... Oh, wait.

Why would I want to pay a disabled or ill person with high hospital bills or a single mother of three who need $30/hr to meet their ""living wage"" instead of the 17 year old kid who still lives with her parents?  If all I need is a cashier or fry cook I'll take the one that costs me $10/hr instead of $30/hr.  People never want to carry this stuff out to its logical conclusion.  Weird to me how people still make this argument after having seen employers reactions to the Obamacare mandates.  The same people who were shocked to see employee hours cut to cap at 29 are the same ones who don't see any way in which the raise-the-minimum-wage-to-a-living-wage thing could have the reverse effect you hope for."
Libertarian,3dvg83,shiggidyschwag,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:58 2015 UTC,"That's not really the case, obviously every employer prefers to hire people that are young, healthy and likely to come to work. Of course employers would rather hire a single young male over a single mother with 3 kids and diabetes.   That aside, it's a fact that you need to at least pay your employees enough to survive (pay for housing, food, and transportation) in order to have employees.

Libertarian,3dvg83,S4ngin,9,Mon Jul 20 12:36:47 2015 UTC,"Statistically, the children have much worse outcomes for being pushed into the system than if they stayed with their parents. As such, you need to make damn sure that parents are worse than the foster system before subjecting children to that unique set of horrors. Abuse rates are higher, neglect is higher, educational outcomes are worse, more wind up homeless or in prison, lower employment rates...  That's the problem with the preventative CPS thing with no real case for abuse or neglect save a far-fetched statistically unlikely what-if conjured out of an episode of Law & Order: SVU. By taking the kids, you make it more likely that they wind up abused. Not less. The argument that the level of parental hover and oversight requirements encouraged by the fear of having children snatched by the state hinges on the idea of harming those specific children for the nebulous unproven assertion that it will push society to better itself in a way that results in fewer children harmed than the ones you're harming to accomplish the mission."
Libertarian,3dvg83,Balrogic3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:43:48 2015 UTC,"educational outcomes are worse, more wind up homeless or in prison, lower employment rates   I'm not going to question on the abuse and neglect rates, but these three would easily be higher simply because of the situations that caused kids to end up in the foster system in the first place. The crazy cases where kids were taken from parents when they should not have been are very real, but are not the majority of cases. Most are orphan situations, kids whose parents end up in prison, homes where there was actual abuse happening, and more.    the children have much worse outcomes for being pushed into the system than if they stayed with their parents.   This presumes that kids staying with their parents would have the same outcomes as the average of all kids who stay with their parents. But many times, the kids are pulled out of actually abusive homes, in which case their outcomes would have been much, much lower; in fact the low outcome averages of foster care can be partially blamed on the factors that caused the kids to end up in the system.  I don't think foster care is perfect. There are real abuses that happen, there are kids that shouldn't have been put in. That is very real, and that's a huge problem. But I think it is worth noting that the issue is actually complex, not simple, and when discussing it we need to acknowledge that there are kids that really do need the foster system, and there are foster parents that really do help kids."

This thread started with the question:   Would someone please tell me why she thinks she did anything wrong?   (emphasis added) in reference to her saying that she was a good mother who made a not so smart decision.  The answer is in her alarming patrons by [seemingly] leaving 2 and 6 year old children unattained and crying in a food court in a big city mall.  As for whether there was probable cause that a crime was committed, the crime would be ""to leave a child in any place without providing reasonable and necessary care for the child, under circumstances under which no reasonable, similarly situated adult would leave a child of that age and ability...in any place under circumstances that expose the child to an unreasonable risk of harm."" Tex. Pen. Code § 22.041(a),(b).   Mom was with her children by the time the police arrived.  No reasonable person would leave a 2 and 6 year old in a shopping mall by themselves. Assuming that we can now say with absolute certainty that this is not what happened, that does not mean there was not enough evidence to make an arrest at the time it was made.  No news article will provide enough information to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances as the police officer understood them at the time, there was probable cause that a crime was committed."

If the witnesses said the didn't know where the mother was, but the mother did know where she was and where her kids were, and was within 30 feet, then the witnesses have incomplete information. The cop, on the other hand, has to look at all the facts and, were he reasonable, would conclude that not enough information exists to confirm a crime was committed. In her case, I believe she did provide reasonable care.  The children were not exposed to unreasonable risk of harm. The kids were 30' away in her plain sight.

He has a covered shed to hang out in if the weather turns, he has a hose for water and nobody starves to death before dinner.  What happens?  Some nosy neighbor calls the cops and they find themselves in court.  The irony was that among the crimes was no bathroom facilities, yet the cop who wrote the ticket took a piss in the back yard.

If you can't blame policy-makers for policy and you can't blame special interest lobbyists for policy and you can't blame voters for policy, you're left with victim blaming.  Apparently, the mass incarceration and disproportionate arrest, prosecution, sentencing (and regularly false conviction) of black people is their own fault because they made the choice to express excessive amounts of melanin."

Two related points from my post (I guess you missed them the first time):   In America, at any given time, there will always be people who cannot find work. We have more workers than we have jobs; Above and beyond that, among those who do work, there will always be people who are lower class and cannot afford things like health care.   Given this, it's asinine to peddle this fantasy about working hard and bucking up. The question is, what do we do about the least among us, who will always exist?

Given these two demonstrable, impossible-to-deny facts, your fantasy about how people should just work harder to bootstrap their way into greater wealth is sheer idiocy and utter bullshit. Anybody who thinks for half a second about the world should see the patent truth of that. There will always, always be people for whom this will not be possible. That's, you know, sort of one of the key aspects of capitalism. As long as you hump at that leg, you should get to know it a bit better.  So the question is, given that there will always be people, no matter what, who cannot afford healthcare in a privatized system, what do we do about them?

You are exactly the wrong poster child for the ""private charity work will fill the gap"" argument.  Beyond that, you've missed my initial point.

Your solution, to steal from me to support them, is coercive and evil.   I'll take your indignant rage over people dying on the streets any day of the week.

This is wrong for a number of reasons.  The simplest being that other countries with subsidized healthcare clearly have quality R+D coming from the private sector.  Switzerland has 2 of the top 3 biggest profiting pharm. companies in the world in ratio to their R+D.  While the US does place enormous weight on R+D, this could easily be offset by the much higher prices.  The other reason is that R+D is enthusiastically donated by the same government that these companies got rich lobbying. In fact, if R+D were so important you'd wonder why they would spend 19 times more on marketing instead."
Libertarian,3dwvfq,Barboski,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:08:35 2015 UTC,"Can you explain the relevance of any of that?  If profit is the motive behind the existence of pharmaceutical companies, reducing that profit by fiat also reduces available capital for research, and by extension reduces a company's tolerance for risk. I think I read somewhere that only 1 in 5,000 drugs ever makes it to market for human consumption. That's a huge failure rate. To stomach that risk, you have to believe the one that does make it to market is going to make a LOT of money.  And marketing is about selling the products that actually work. When you finally get something that works, tests well, and gets approval, you market it to death, if need be. Because it's paying for the 4999 others that didn't."
Libertarian,3dwvfq,harold_falcon,2,Mon Jul 20 18:46:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what relevance you need me to make.  It's relevant because wholly private health care systems are no more productive in R+D than ones that provide universal coverage, which was the essence of your argument.  If you look at the link I provided that becomes clear by the amount of countries with universal healthcare that invest enormous amounts of money into R+D without gouging their pharmaceutical prices.  The 1 in 5000 does not make for an impressive resume for these industry giants.  I don't see how that supports your argument that they're doing anything superior to their more affordable counterparts.   And marketing is about selling the products that actually work. When you finally get something that works, tests well, and gets approval, you market it to death, if need be. Because it's paying for the 4999 others that didn't.     This really doesn't stand on its own without some evidence.  Some of the most profitable drugs in the US, such as cancer medication, don't market as viciously as the less profitable ones.  Alternatively, there is far less marketing in other countries, to the point of almost none, for pharmaceuticals, and yet they yield excellent profits without gouging prices.  It sounds like you're just regurgitating what you've been spoon fed regarding this issue."
Libertarian,3dwvfq,Barboski,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:12:25 2015 UTC,"wholly private health care systems are no more productive in R+D than ones that provide universal coverage   Which doesn't seem AT ALL relevant to me. That a company can profit despite its country of origin being on that provides universal health coverage has exactly nothing to do with the total number of medical innovations in the pharmaceutical industry.  If anything, the fact that you have to qualify it with ""in ratio to their R+D"" says all that needs to be said. If a company is forced to reduce profits on successful drugs, it will stop taking risks to make sure its profit/expense ratio stays high.  This is the EXPECTED behavior, but it's not at all ideal.   The 1 in 5000 does not make for an impressive resume for these industry giants.   It's actually more of a testament to the unreasonable hoops a pharma company must jump through to bring a drug to market in the US.   I don't see how that supports your argument that they're doing anything superior to their more affordable counterparts.   Then you're not paying very good attention. Risk often times ends in failure. If risk became intolerable due to lower profits from successful drugs, the pharma industry would have to pivot. Low hanging fruit would get the bulk of the funding (to bump up that oh so important profit/expense ration you brought up earlier), even though it might not be the most necessary (think Viagra).   Some of the most profitable drugs in the US, such as cancer medication, don't market as viciously as the less profitable ones.   Cancer medications don't need advertising. For the obvious reasons, but also because they're chosen by doctors, not the patients. Whereas heartburn and allergy medication is something consumers might be far more involved with in choosing.  I'm starting to wonder if you might be trolling me, because you seem to think that companies are throwing advertising money away. Companies are in the business of making money, not wasting it.   Alternatively, there is far less marketing in other countries, to the point of almost none, for pharmaceuticals, and yet they yield excellent profits without gouging prices.   I'm actually not AT ALL interested in the profits of companies, for the purposes of this conversation. What I'm talking about specifically is medical innovation. And for medical innovation, the US is the leader. Find me a company with industry leading medical innovation that also has to deal with price controls, and maybe we'll talk.

Frank could offer his sons labor only so long as the son isn't free to enter his own contracts.  Age of 10-14 is a likely threshold.  Edit. The rest looks legit.  Also, Frank's son can choose independence from or dependence on his father. If he chooses the former he has to reach his own agreement to remain on the property. If he chooses the later he chooses his father's agreements on his behalf. Important piece is that it is a choice."
Libertarian,3e1x2t,bannanaflame,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:32:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting! So until a certain age of agency, someone can't enter any contracts, and no one can enter a contract on behalf of them (even a parent)? This would change things.  I'm assuming the parent would still have some level of allowed control over the child from 0-14, though? It would be tough if a 3-year-old is throwing a tantrum in Walmart and the parent can't restrain the kid in some way.  But, despite owning himself, without owning any land isn't Jake essentially in the same situation we all are? We grow up from 0-14 answering pretty much just to our parents, with our parents handling the interaction with the state as part of their own terms of living here and having a child, and then we choose to start working/living independently in the country we are. As the USA is not up for negotiation to its terms of residence, we have the choice to go to another country, but we choose to live here and have to pay taxes and such as a result."

Libertarian,3e1x2t,bannanaflame,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:41 2015 UTC,"That's reasonable!  But, to go on a bit of a side topic, isn't that in a way what we have? Let's just narrow the topic to taxes for now: we are born with no property or wealth, and our parents instead provide for us under their own agreement with the government. And then when we come of age and become financially independent, by choosing employment, housing, etc. in this country we're opting in to pay taxes and such."
Libertarian,3e1x2t,shit_dragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:32 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, but the default is that all laws of the land apply. Principally, if we are born free then the default should be that no law, or only natural law applies. There would be some sort of opt-in like a loyalty pledge before government has jurisdiction.   Terribly impractical to implement on top of any existing system. If it could be done, I would expect participation rates to be very high since government would have incentive to not be assholes. Limits of not being under government would be prohibitive; no govt mail, public road access, perhaps kept off utility grids. All of that would only be tolerable to a few rough and tumble types which I expect are already living like they don't have a government.   Edit: moved from taxes cause your pretty right on it. By working in a area under government control you basically consent to taxation."

What it comes down to in this case is concepts of property ownership and control (issues not all libertarians agree on 100% so I'm avoiding answering directly). I don't think any libertarians would accept the concept of the government owning all the land and just letting us citizens use it or use it based on an agreement, so the 'go live someplace else Jake' resolution which might be applicable on your case doesn't apply to the national scene.  Also future 1 also isn't a real analogue either because 7 Franks out of 10 saying OK isn't the same as Frank saying OK."

It's a case of false detainment, and the article is actually about how Kilgore is asking for a public apology.    “I’m sitting in handcuffs and they have to call a car to come take me down to the police station,” Kilgore said. “I’m sitting, waiting there and I hear the [officer] sitting next to me on his radio say, ‘We have Ryan Fultz in custody.’ I looked at him and told him, ‘That’s not me.’”  That’s when the officers looked at Kilgore’s ID and realized they had the wrong guy.

Unless your definition of police apologism is anything that isnt ""DAE ACAB?!!"", there is no police apologism here. When a reporter puts together an article, he gathers all the facts (in this case: man was wrongfully detained by police for child porn, man was released by police after police realised it was the wrong guy, man is demanding apology from police), then reports all those facts (as done in this article), and then hands it in. That's what the article is, and the reporter includes in the article a number of discrepancies between what the police later declared and what they reportedly said at the time, implying some foul play by police.

Libertarian,3dxh14,whatsabitcoins,3,Tue Jul 21 00:57:38 2015 UTC,"The observation that the GOP is rife with cryptofacists is hardly an original observation, however accurate.  Trump is not very interesting in and of himself, his candidacy is slightly  interesting because it comes at a time where conservative populism is searching for leadership. But ultimately some of the worst things about our political system also tend to insulate us from the effects of rampant populism. Real change is incredibly difficult because our system allows people to feel like they make a difference without letting them actually do so. This is often a bad thing but it's kept the socialists, fascists and cristofascists from doing more than push us gently in one direction or another when their causes become hip.  Of course any populist candidate or movement could be the one that breaks the system. If Gore had been president for 8 years instead of Bush who knows what the tea party might have done, they suffered a lot because they were popular within the then current establishment party so anti-establishment  backlash hit them and we weathered the peak of passion within that movement without it ever really coalescing behind a leader."

Obamacare for example was written by insurance companies (corporations).    The left/right, GOP/Democrat labeling is a generality and is often not accurate.   In this case your statement was true, but it could have been said of Democrats as well.   So, I challenged you for simply aiming at one political party when it is both of them.  EDIT: You were referring to the article, and the OP, so ignore me seeming to aim at you.   I can see you ""Get"" it.  EDIT 2: As to your Gore and Tea Party.   The Tea Party arose from Ron Paul supporters in 2008.   As his nomination faltered Glen Beck, and Sarah Palin, and a few others kind of hijacked that movement and turned it into the Tea Party you are referring to.   Why do I bring that up?   Well, if Gore had been president would the Ron Paul movement still have happened?  Who knows...   In which case would the Tea Party have been created?"
Libertarian,3dxh14,shadowplanner,2,Mon Jul 20 15:54:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think we're pretty much on the same page as far as the GOP vs Democrats go. The only thing I'd mention is that in terms of populism fascism isn't a viable movement within the DNC like it is within the GOP. Statism is, in the form of state socialism, but if Donald Trump ran with his message on the DNC side he'd have no traction whatsoever with the crazies on the left.   At the leadership establishment level there's not a huge difference between GOP and DNC, but the populist base is very different in terms of what they think they want.    My memory of the timing of the tea party movement was a bit off, I thought it preceded the Ron Paul phenomenon rather than coming out of it. Thinking back I realize now that doesn't make a lot of sense, but that's what I was thinking when I posted that.  In any case my general point was that I have no idea what might have happened with the tea party if the tide of history hadn't been against their success."

Socialism when you guarantee the income from that to a corporation is still Fascism.  I do think we are quickly drifting more and more towards Socialism and have been for awhile.   However, that is not distinctly different from Fascism.   They both seem to exist just fine side by side.    Fascism can also exist side by side with any non-free market form of capitalism.    Which we have quite a bit of that as well.  The populist base is different.   Though I don't think either side knows a lot about what they want.   Seems to be based more on emotion and flowery statements, than actual reason/logic.  EDIT: Tea Party and Ron Paul came out timed around one of his money bombs on the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party.   It just kind of continued on as a movement in the Ron Paul campaign after that until the nomination fizzled and it was hijacked by people that had a lot different ideas than the people in the original movement.   Though it is this later movement that is STILL around so given the amount of time it IS what we all know of as the Tea Party now.    I remember being involved back then and being pretty pissed off when Glen Beck, and Palin hijacked the Tea Party shows when previously both of them were bashing the same people."

Libertarian,3dxh14,Barton_Foley,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:51 2015 UTC,By todays standards Fascism is on the left. People looking backwards don't realize that the left in Germany at the time was literally communism and the communist party. And for some reason as a people we pretend that the left vs. right paradigm hasn't changed at all since the French Revolution when left vs. right was Revolutionaries vs. French Royalists.

Libertarian,3dxh14,Ragark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:25 2015 UTC,"Using the standard this author uses for ""fascism"" then most of this nations founding fathers were fascists.    Most believed in economic nationalism and opposed free trade. Free traders like Thomas Jefferson changed their views after the War of 1812. All the founders were race realists. They didn't believe that blacks were equal to whites. The equality propaganda in the Declaration of the Independence was only meant to appeal to the French, who the American colonists wanted to intervene on their behalf. The founders wanted to restrict immigration to come from just Western European nations, not from all over the world.    White nationalism, or fascism if you will built this nation and made it great. Liberalism, both in it's classic form and modern form, are bullshit universalist ideologies that have destroyed Western civilization.  Trump while far from a perfect candidate has tapped into the hearts of the white, working class in this nation."

Libertarian,3dyj9j,harold_falcon,4,Mon Jul 20 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know you're right.   Yet, the entire idea of minimum wage is flawed.   People just are not informed of how the market and pricing works.   If they are struggling on $10/hr or whatever they are making $15/hr sounds REALLY good.   It actually WILL be really good for them for a short period until the market adjusts and they are living the same on $15/hr as they currently are on $10/hr.    However, all those people that worked to get their $18/hr jobs and are living okay now will find themselves struggling when the rest of the market catches up to the new $15/hr job.    Raising minimum wage does not hurt the wealthy.   It does eat away at the middle class and in the long term lead to more people struggling.  The only way this would not happen is if ALL wages were increased a similar amount.   If you're making $10/hr now and wage is increased to $15/hr then someone making $15/hr now should be increased to $20/hr.    Yet this is kind of stupid as when the market catches up the net effect will be ZERO.  However, raising the minimum wage and not raising other wages has a net effect that is LESS THAN ZERO.   Meaning in the long term it makes things worse and creates more people who are struggling.   Sadly, people only remember that couple of years when they seem to have more money.  I remember working at A&W as a teenager.   I got a raise from $3.35/hr to $3.50/hr.... WOOHOO!!!  A month or so later the minimum wage was increased to $3.50/hr...  I was training new hires that made as much as me.   So much for working hard and doing a good job.  So my argument is why bother stopping at $15/hr.   You might as well raise the wage to $1000/hr or pick a number."

So essentially wealth creates more wealth.  In addition, wealth is the result of profit seeking behavior. The reason that bill gates and taylor swift are wealthy is because they provided services that the public deemed worthy of their time and money. Gates through PCs and Swift through entertainment.   Oftentimes people like to forget that markets are based on voluntary exchange, and those who profit are actually providing valuable services. The prevailing view today is that people who make profits are somehow ripping everyone off. No one made those people buy a PC or Taylor Swift's records, and the same applies for most who reap profits.  Some say that CEO pay is exorbitant, yeah, sure whatever, but if there wasn't a market that could pay a CEO umpteen million dollars, they wouldn't be paid that much. It takes a lot of time effort and skill to drive a multi billion dollar company in the right directions.  Furthermore, the Government has no ability to create wealth. None whatsoever, no matter what people tell you. THe government can only transfer wealth (through force) from one person or group to another. It will always be a net loss in the transfer of wealth from this one group to another because of the bureaucratic infrastructure required to make this transfer possible. In addition to that there will be graft and corruption that will take place because of the lack of government oversight. It happens all the time in government, and they are often very wasteful.  The only alternative is that we leave the money in the hands of those who managed to secure it, because obviously they did something right to procure it and they have more vision and foresight than others. This allows them to continue enriching themselves and others through their actions.   Standards of living never rose because of government intervention (without exorbitant debt they are unable to pay back cough GREECE), but only because of the wealth of the Private sector."

Libertarian,3dy2j7,marx2k,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:18:53 2015 UTC,"While I agree with the basic idea that taxes at too high a level can discourage productivity and innovation, I would point out that during what many consider to be the ""golden age"" of American capitalism in the 1950s and 1960s we had extremely high marginal tax rates.   Part of the reason for that is that our tax code was much more ""progressive"" at the top end back then--we did not have a system like we do now where someone who earns $250k/year pays the same marginal rate as someone who earns $250 million per year.  I think it makes sense to add some more brackets at the top--say the current bracket for people under $1 million per year, then maybe a few percent higher for $1 million to $5 million, then a few percent higher for incomes above that.  We're still talking rates in the low 40 percent range at that point, which I don't believe would have a very significant effect on the economy.    I do think that the main problem with rates in the extremely high, 90 percent-ish range is that almost nobody pays them.  It encourages people to shelter their assets in other countries with lower rates, or to relocate their businesses to friendlier environments."

Sure, you could have one or many voluntary security services, but their power would pale in comparison to governments because they can't confiscate money through taxes. I fear and expect the end result would be war between security forces and eventual conquest by a government with a real military.  Also, when it comes to the security of entire regions or countries you have the free rider problem. Why should I voluntarily donate money to protect my house when I can just freeload off of my neighbors donating money to make the neighborhood safe?  So the best solution in my opinion is federalism. This makes each state kind of like a Condo association. Don't like the rules? Don't move there. Optimally the large states would split up to provide more competition between governments, which would lower social services and taxes to attract the kind of people they want, not the ones they don't. But 50 states is enough to provide choice and a natural experiment in governance."

While I'm not saying that Rockefeller was motivated entirely by money, the cash payout is probably a large reason for Rockefeller and people like him to go out and innovate. If you know that most of your money will be taken away once you earn it, that decreases the incentive to go after it.

We would also expect that firms hire people up to the point where MRP = MC(L), but Richard Thaler's book Misbehaving cites a study done where employers really don't look at hiring in that fashion. They obviously look at hiring in terms of profit loss, but not in an academic way as economists would.

Maybe I can better express my point with a personal example. I once owned and operated a company that produced custom bikes. I could build a bike to almost any design my customers wanted, and it would run better than anything they could get from a factory bike. But there was plenty of competition, and some were backed by the big, rich factory owners. I couldn't compete with the price because of their volume sales, they would get parts cheaper. Even though their bikes weren't truly custom, as they weren't made to order, and they didn't improve on factory quality either. They were cheaper, and they were making MUCH more money on volume sales.   The better product got pushed out of the market, while the worse product made six figure sales every year. If they decided they weren't going to sale more than a certain volume, because the taxation made producing more less beneficial to their bottom line, then others like me would step in and fill the gap, as their volume wouldn't give them such and advantage in pricing. In the end the better product would get produced, and the pricing would be more equalized.   High volume rarely equals better quality."

Also, limiting the production of an organisation isn't fostering or promoting competition, in any real sense. If anything it enables the organisation's competitor to produce less competitve products and still succeed. The victim is this kind of controlled economy is both the customer and the manaufacturer of the superior product.

Libertarian,3dy2j7,verveinloveland,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:45:16 2015 UTC,"In theory yes.  But there is a prevailing perception of value across the market, which is evident from the sales difference in products when there customers are offered the full range of products e.g. if coke outsells pepsi, it is evident that coke has higher perceived value than pepsi for customers."
Libertarian,3dy2j7,nmhunate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:33 2015 UTC,"Current economic situations also must be factored into such an analysis. If the economy is down, like it is now, less expensive products are going to be bought regardless of their true value. When the economy is up, consumers will opt for the better quality, even at a higher price. e.g. If pepsi out sales coke and pepsi is a dollar per six-pack cheaper, but next week coke out sales pepsi because it went on sale at a dollar per six-pack cheaper, they are of similar value as per their quality, people are just looking to save money in hard times. But in good times they will ALWAYS buy the one the like better, regardless of which on is on sale."
Libertarian,3dy2j7,verveinloveland,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:39 2015 UTC,Everyone keep in mind that that would be 90% on everything ABOVE a certain amount. If the amount is $50 milion and you earn $50 million and 1$ you pay 90% on that $1.

Income equality (and the problems which cause income inequality) are fixed by ending government and also to some extent requires a cultural shift away from the idea of an absolute right to private property that trumps all other rights.  If you had an enforceable 90% tax that somehow automatically disbursed all that money rather than allowing it into the filthy claws of government it might be a palatable first step but there's no way to do that so I think step 1 really needs to be taking down uncle Sam, the pirates who siphon off uncle Sam need to be step 2 in any scenario I can imagine potentially working.

Which is a complete crock and these folks need to be treated the same as any common grand larceny or fraud is.   Socialism is this behavior, just 'officiated' and formalized. Amazing how folks think they'll get more for free by 'taking down the man'.  Though on the plus side, as a nation becomes more socialist, another nation rises up with more liberty.   I think sometimes there's a freedom pot, and the pot gets bigger every year. When some nations become less free, the pot gets refilled and other nations take from it.

You want to private market to provide for peoples retirements? That ain't happening on that budget.   Yes, because the lifestyle is subsidized. If you add in the subsidies, those average incomes are WAY higher. If you took them away, they'd either die or get a better job.  History has shown what happens. (Hint: it's not dying). Folks nowadays that make below $50k are basically on the road to extinction economically. They are not adding anything of true value to the economy. They consume more than they give and there's more of them than anyone else (fewer people in the top 50% then the bottom 50%, income wise).  That gap will continue to grow regardless of what income redistributing you - simply put, they aren't being forced to better themselves so they will forever be serfs. They will never, even now, get retirements. They get government 'hand to mouth' serfdom, put there to ensure the top 1% has more cash from the middle class redirect.   But no, really, there are very practical reasons to hold off on taxing people heavily until they are wealthy- we want everyone to become wealthy.   It doesn't matter where you tax it at. The citizens with income pays all taxes. Companies do not pay taxes from their profits. Their profits are fixed. You will not see 1 cent of change in the economy if you flat taxed everyone at 99.999999%.  So you might say hey, well the CEO has an income and he gets taxed, right?! Sure, but most of the income a CEO makes is in stock. Capital gains aren't subject to income taxes and even if they were, they just reinvest it to dodge the tax hit, and then off-shore the money. Welcome to Google and Apple.  It's a big game of hide and seek, at the end of the day, though, they will take home the same $$$ regardless of tax rate.   And for what? The amount of revenue you get is incredibly trivial. Over 50% of income is in the top 20%, while the bottom 20% of people have less than 5% of income.   Then it shouldn't matter.

Its a goddamn plague of ingratitude with you people, the worst part is that you illiterates arn't even rich or influential and absolutely will never be.   Then become a CEO. I'm as grateful to employee as I am to a car or piece of equipment. The CEO is the CPU chip in the company, and they treat him like such. If he malfunctions, they fire him. Fired CEOs are pretty much done for. A fired employee just gets another job.   Case in point- the fuck is a corporation? The ceo and shareholders don't lose their life savings   Yes they do. What do you think a 401k is? Or a stock plan? Or IRA? Or mutual funds? People bank on these for their retirement.

In fact, it can be considered illegal since you work there (insider trading). Executives are paid in stock mostly, the $13 million they get in yearly salary is dwarfed compared to the $50-80 million they get in stock options.   When that stock goes south, they lose it all. They don't just walk away scott free. That's a rarity that happens when they do something illegal.   just another glaring example of market failure you're willing to overlook because koolaid. Sounds like you don't understand investments or stocks.   Look you come here shaking your fist at the rich and going ""THATS UNFAIR WE DO ALL THE WORK""....but yet you don't start your own company. Then you complain because you don't have capital, therefore you can't. Then when I go ""well, when the company goes under, all the capital is lost - you don't lose anything as an employee, because you didn't put in any to begin with. You have no risk"" and you basically suggest risk doesn't matter and if the rich people lose money, that's fine, because they can afford it.  Well, you can afford losing your job, by that logic, too. So what's the deal here? I'm going to point out jealousy. You can't envision how hard a CEO's job really is, therefore, it must be easy! You don't own significant stocks or 401k holdings, so, all that is paper money that can vanish and no one real gets hurt. Starting a company is super easy for the rich, therefore they don't deserve to make much money on it. But they should take on all the risk, too.  You know, 84% of millionaires are self-made in this country, and most are in their 50's before they attain the status (over $2 million in assets). They were middle class before.   They didn't have a bunch of capital either. So something tells me there's a lot to be said for risk and how hard it is, and given how 2/3 of businesses don't survive their first year and over 80% are gone after 5 years...tells me that a lot of people lose a lot of money starting companies, including investors and everyday folks.  I don't see your savings account getting raided when they fire you from your job for incompetence. But that's what happens to businesses and those who put capital into it - they lose it all. You get to keep what you earned as a worker. So you want a bigger share of the profits? Put in more of your skin."

There's a story my grandmother used to tell me of one time catching my dad dumpster-diving for food behind a restaurant by chance because he didn't want to admit to my grandparents he couldn't put food on the table for me when I was 2.  He went hungry many nights to make sure I didn't, and ate from the garbage. He now is a program manager (equiv to a director) of engineering at the US Army Corps of engineers. It wasn't until I was 12 that we had enough money for what you'd call middle class (60K income when became a full professional engineer), so while my memory of extreme poverty isn't the sharpest due to being so young, I recall a lot of 'not having' and the constant worry about money (at least the discussions).  And his son? Earns well into the six figures, college educated, and is virtually debt free (with just 100K left on the house loan). Have owned two businesses in my life, one abject failure and one that sold, and held 5 jobs total, holding stock in each place, ranging from 26 people to 500+, and put myself through school by working full time while attending full time.  So, come again about how unfair it all is? Oh, right, we're 'lucky'.   Yes, thankfully I was lucky to be born into such poverty and pride that I understand the concepts of sacrifice and hard work, instead of being entitled and expecting everything to be given to me.  Give me a break. You try growing up in the black ghetto of Indianapolis where the murder rate is through the roof (http://wishtv.com/2014/12/29/2014-indianapolis-murders-hit-3rd-highest-rate-on-record/) and you get to watch people deal drugs outside your elementary school.  Until you live like I have, you no have damn right to talk about CEO pay. You can sit there and cowardly insult me from behind a computer screen all you want, but I know success.  And you wanna know the most damning thing? I am not the best success story among the people I know personally. There are folks that have come FARTHER than I have and dealt with much worse (for example, I was not sexually abused for a decade and used as a child prostitute by a mother for crack money on the southside of Chicago and I do not currently run a local chain of ethnic beauty salons with a personal worth of over $5 million, which is $4.7-$4.8 million more than I am worth approx).  So keep spinning the narrative and hate because you happened to not like the results of your choices. But in the end, sour grapes aren't going to do anyone any good."

This is America, a capitalistic society, if you want something, you fucking pay for it. Can't get someone at the rate you're offering? Fucking compete, offer more. Eventually you hit the point where it makes sense to just buy someone the training that YOU need. So spare me the ""could be"" 's and tripe written to convince politicians to issue more h1b's.   STEM degree jobs are going unfilled by a higher and higher percentage each year   And yet wages are flat. Someone is lying to you. Those job openings arn't unfilled positions, they're just going unicorn hunting- someone with the skills, willing to work for less.   Obviously they don't. We have tons of jobs that are about to be replaced by automation as well in the next 20 years (all fastfood line cook jobs).   Spare me, the objective of work isn't to keep people busy, its to get the job done. Your idea of job creation is to have people dig with spoons. And no, a kiosk doesn't make the food, take inventory, stock the shelves, clean up after itself or conduct maintenance.   Choosing who to hire to make those delegations too is absolutely essential.   Yes? How many millions of dollars is that nugget of wisdom worth?   The best part is that you suggest I haven't hired people nor been on the executive team of a company or been a consultant in the field to senior executives.   Is that why you have the mannerisms and worldview of a middleschooler?   You can't both suggest they get off scott free and somehow the workers don't.   You seem to be having a very involved conversation with yourself, do I even need to be here? You claimed that the workers lose nothing, I foiled your claim with pensions. You claimed that the people who run the company lose everything, I foiled that claim with the fact that corporations exist to preserve the wealth of the owners- they're not going to lose their house in a lawsuit against them for cutting so many corners that their tires kill people.   but almost every company includes a 'no-sell until x' clause to the options due to them being in positions of power to make decisions that could affect the company stock price.   Ding ding ding. Couple that to your earlier complaint about employees having stock and the tangent resolves itself.   Otherwise, they could pump up the company, sell right before they bail. That is insider trading and is illegal.   It takes a significant amount of capital to do that. What other problems do you imagine that we are having right now: all of our golden roads are too slippery? Its difficult to drive with all of the diamond plated cars reflecting the sun into your eyes?   You are the one bemoaning your life because you don't have capital   No, you brought that up. I bemoan the deleterious effect it has on the economy, capitalism requires capital. If you like oligarchy so much, just move to russia.   You can get a loan or a crowd-funded venture or start a CO-OP   Right, you can pool all of your no money together with everyone elses no money, carry the nothing and start calling yourself a ceo despite not having any employees, since thats trendy now. Tell me, if no one is hiring skillset X, how is starting a business offering skillset X rather than seeking employment with skillset X going to change anything? These are not problems that are going to be solved from the bottom up with lemonade stand economics.   You aren't being exploited like a slave, you are worth what you are worth. There is no conspiracy to rig the game (though regulation and crony-capitalism do make it harder since both are major barriers to competition) against you.

Libertarian,3dy2j7,anarchitekt,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:56 2015 UTC,"Coming from an extremely biased point of view, there is no reason why anyone on earth needs a billion dollars.   Nobody needs it, sure. Nobody needs to watch $200 million Hollywood films. Nobody needs a car, even. But I would say the standard of living drops for almost everyone when caps are made on wealth. Some socialists/anarchists embrace this change of lifestyle, the most extreme example being anarcho-primitivists.  When you take a billion dollars and spread is across millions of people, then the resulting economic activity will mostly be more basic needs, like food, clothes, etc. If you give that billion to one person, the economic activity is concentrated and is capable of creating multi-million dollar feats of entertainment or some risky innovative technology/service. Or, like most professional athletes, the person can just waste all the money buying cool crap.  Of course, a 1000 people with a million dollars could collaborate and create the same feat of entertainment, as an example, as the guy with the billion. But innovation and advancement is slightly more rare among collective bodies since it's more difficult to coordinate the taking of collective risks.  That being sad, I certainly support lowering the standard of living when that standard is based on anti-libertarian practices. I personally think the expected standard of living today is too high in society. As someone who voluntarily lived homeless out of my car for a few months to save money (I was poor and didn't want to waste all income on rent), and after living in/near Brazilian favelas for a couple years where people successfully lived in little brick houses they made for $400 without needing to pay rent, I realized how ridiculous it is today with all these regulations, laws, and social expectation that force people to live a standard of living they may not even want and often times cannot afford. All of these minimum wage employees spend all of their income just on rent and food. No room for savings, so they need government help for a problem that government largely created/supports."

Bill Gates needs a billion dollars to eliminate malaria, saving 600,000 lives per year.  There is no reason on Earth we ""need"" lots of things.  A billion dollars is a tremendous reward for creating a tremendous amount of utility others have paid you.  Bill Gates made computers cheaper, easier to use, and more prevalent.  The individuals who have chosen to buy personal computers with his operating system gave him billions for his efforts.  Elon Musk made electric cars that are fun to drive beautiful to look at (and rockets and solar panels and batteries and Paypal) so consumers bought those and made him billions of dollars."

I reject the notion that paypal, PCs, electric cars, etc. would not have existed without the benevolence of Bill Gates and Elon Musk, and people like them. I'm glad these 2 individuals are putting their wealth to good use, without doubt, but we can't assume these things wouldn't have occurred under a completely different economic or government model. In fact, one can easily argue (and I believe neo-libertarians would agree) that in the case of electric cars, and clean energy, corporations and government have made it hard for change to occur. It wasn't too long ago that oil companies pulled all of their funding from researchers that discovered that leaded gasoline was very dangerous for the population.

Obviously a government that stayed out of the personal automobile market would be preferable, and there is evidence to suggest that without the government's interference electric cars would have happened earlier.  I am simply saying that building Tesla was an extraordinarily risky, expensive venture, and I am comfortable with Elon being rewarded for it.

When NASA spends $6 billion on safety measures that will improve survivability rate by 1.2% of a single astronaut, they're enforcing the idea that the astronaut's life is essentially worth hundreds of billions of tax payer dollars. If a patient has an illness that requires $1 million doses of drugs every day, the most ethical thing to do is let them die. Even if they have the money, I would try to persuade them to use it elsewhere, though that would still be their choice to make.

Also there is the fact that these people are going to die anyway, so really it is not the price of saving said persons life, but the price of letting them live a couple days longer, so they question should be ""How much is a day of life worth?"" rather than ""How much is a life worth?"""

The real problem is lazy people. And I don't mean showing up to 40 hours a week to work, but learning some basic math skills or how to be an electrician, or how to code.  People are so mentally bankrupt at this point, their iphone in their pocket is smarter than them. They just aren't being allowed to die off, so they breed and multiply, in massive numbers compared to the capable.  Soon, the population gets unwieldy, and the system collapses, and they 'exit the system'. Then things reset.  Tis the natural flow."

Libertarian,3dujod,ViktorV,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:16:40 2015 UTC,"Or just observant of what is.  Or the falling STEM graduation rates and plummeting test scores in these areas or the fact H1 visas make up more and more of the professional workforce....  Pick any reason. You realize we brain-drained europe and this was the result in their neck of the woods in the early 1900's, right? Part of the reason for the world wars was economic.  Those wars eased economic inequality and poverty by literally killing off everyone who was low income from 1914 to 1945. It's a natural consequence of too many deer grazing the same grassland."
Libertarian,3dujod,canoe123,7,Mon Jul 20 01:47:38 2015 UTC,Why do you think that only people in STEM are of value? You really do sound like a young student going into STEM (or trying to).
Libertarian,3dujod,ViktorV,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:52:37 2015 UTC,"Because they produce the things everything is willing to pay $$ for and is clamoring for wealth redistribution.  Internet, planes, medicine, etc. etc. all seem much more valued in our current society.  And no, I'm a professional in the field who makes six figures. So I know what I'm talking about when it comes to value and why STEM is pretty much the be all of decent jobs in the future."

Law is still a good option for the qualified (half of the schools just need to be shut down). I'm quite content to be working in a verbal-IQ centric and English language intensive field that will never be outsourced or H1B-ed out from under me."

Libertarian,3dujod,Shamalamadindong,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:28:04 2015 UTC,"And in particular, the comments...   Bill Sinclair • a year ago 1) The research re: cancer survival rates you quote do not mention, let alone give figures for LUNG cancer — the subject of your argument. 2) The data is more than 6 years old FFS. 3) It could be argued that cancer surivival rates in the US were (because they are more than 5 years old) as high as cited because the PREVALENCE of cancer is higher in the USA. Socialised health systems are much more effective at PREVENTATIVE medicine than the US system.  4) IT IS well established through drawiing on all data the U.S. medical system consistently underperforms in terms of life expectancy (3 YEARS less than Spain, for example) and, given that US medicals are the highest paid in the world, represent the worst return on investment in terms of health outcomes. 5) Anyone in the UK can opt for private medical treatment if they want it and can afford it. 6) You do medical and heathcare professionals across the world a disservice by mouthing off before a) checking your data and its sources and, b) talking to anyone who works in healthcare and medical research. You could at least refer to WHO data before mouthing off. 6) To post such shit while quoting Orwell, random or not, on your page marks you as a doublespeaker. You should be ashamed. Orwell's wife, Eileen, died, months before the introduction of the NHS, in part because they, (the Orwells) could not afford treatment in London and so sought treatment in Newcastle upon Tyne. She is buried in Jesmond cemetery."
Libertarian,3dujod,tensorstrength,3,Sun Jul 19 20:20:43 2015 UTC,"How does survival rate have anything to do with prevalence? The medical knowledge is universal, and the statistics are based on that population used for the study, which are the people with cancer. In fact, cancer survival rate is a metric on the outcome, not the intention. Not sure what you mean.  Anyhow, the question to be discussed isn't ""how can we manage the large costs of medical care"", but ""why is the cost of medical care growing without an equal growth in quality?"""
Libertarian,3dujod,foople,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:55:54 2015 UTC,One issue I noticed in the sources linked is the use of 5 year survival rates vs. mortality rates.   http://www.healthnewsreview.org/2013/02/five-year-survival-rates-can-mislead-message-to-medical-educators-medical-journals-journalists-and-the-public/
Libertarian,3dujod,harold_falcon,-35,Sun Jul 19 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"You fucking dipshit, it's clear you never watched the show. The rationalization Walter used to make meth was NOT to pay for health care. The doctor at the beginning said it was incurable, no treatment whatsoever would have saved him. Walter made meth to build up a nest egg to support his family after he would be gone. Obviously, his motivations changed over the course of the series, but health care had fuck all to do with it.   Fucking ignorant asshole. Go burn your blog to the ground in celebration of your stupidity. Moron."
Libertarian,3dujod,harold_falcon,23,Sun Jul 19 17:07:56 2015 UTC,"Go back and read the blog - it's criticising the cartoon! I have watched breaking bad and agree with you that the cartoon is wrong in that sense but the point of the blog is that Walter would have had worse healthcare if he had lived in Britain, contrary to what the cartoon is implying."
Libertarian,3dujod,nimsoh,-33,Sun Jul 19 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"It's an irrelevant issue, health care cost was not a factor in Walter making meth. The whole analysis is flawed from the beginning.   EDIT - Lol, getting downvoted by idiots who never watched Breaking Bad."
