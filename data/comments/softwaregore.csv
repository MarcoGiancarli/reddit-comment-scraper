softwaregore,3e2eck,Kr0uK,2,Tue Jul 21 12:53:01 2015 UTC,"Oh boy oh boy you got me excited now, I'm doing OS dev as a hobby right now... let's see what we can glean here.  Some kind of kernel panic on a UNIX-like system.  Based on the font and interface in the background I'm going to guess OS X, so that's Darwin, which is BSD-like.  x86_64 system, given that the registers are listed as RAX, RBX, etc. which have a 64-bit address width.  ISR #14 (0x0E) is page fault exception, which it also says, so that means the kernel's virtual memory map wasn't cooperating with its physical memory map.  Pointer to the code that caused the issue appears to be 0xffffffff80002dd9, which--given that crazy-high offset--means the fault probably happened during a system call from userspace to ring 0 (kernel space), i.e. program asks the kernel to do something it isn't allowed to do, kernel says ""ok"" and tries to do it, screws up in the process, resulting error is shown.  As for why every character is doubled, my only guess is that the way this platform was handling characters was in a 16-bit medium, and a standard VGA console uses 8-bit character length, so to compensate, the OS just repeats the character from the lower half into the upper half of each character's address space, so it's at least somewhat readable--that is 100% a guess, however, and I have no idea why it wouldn't just dump 8-bit char data to the screen before halting execution."
softwaregore,3e2eck,sigtau,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for the information. I'm trying to install OSX on an AMD laptop and it's crashing a bit.
softwaregore,3e2eck,sigtau,3,Tue Jul 21 18:07:59 2015 UTC,"Most likely OS X doesn't like your motherboard or how it handles physical memory, since OS X was designed for very specific hardware.  I'm guessing this is a hackintosh project, so see if you can't find your motherboard's revision number of model number online and if anyone's had luck installing OS X with it."

When you run the translation tool via Gulp task and the translation hasn't been done yet it throws in a ""missing"" to make it easier to see. We do Norwegian/Danish/Swedish/English often, so subtle differences in spelling could be hard to miss if it showed the original text, ""missing"" is easy to see. You are probably seeing a translation that wasn't tested properly."

You could also try increasing your pagefile size, and defragmenting your disk(s). You might only notice a nominal improvement in performance, but this is a temporary solution that will help until you can install more RAM. Your HDD is thrashing while trying to page things in and out of physical memory, and platter disks don't really take too kindly to being worked to the absolute max for hours on end.  Also as a rule of thumb, your pagefile size limit should be ~3x as large as the amount of physical memory in your system. Yes, I know that sounds ridiculous. If you have 8GiB of RAM, you would need to dedicate 24GiB of your HDD to swap. Do it anyway."
softwaregore,3dqcl4,GMY0da,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:27:23 2015 UTC,"Hi! I would like to ask you for some advice;you certainly sound like you know what you're talking about.   My setup is kind of weird, so I'm not sure on it. It is as follows: I have a small SSD, upon which the OS and certain programs are installed, and a very sizable HDD upon which I have the majority of my files on, thanks to mklink, as well as 8 GB of RAM.   Previously, Windows had automatically set 19 GB on the SSD for page filing, but because of its small size and worry about the drive's lifespan, I changed it to 500 MB on the SSD and 24 GB on the HDD.   The 500 MB is because Windows said it would need it for log files in crashes or some such.   Does this sound reasonable, or should I change it to something else? I'll probably put a post up /r/techsupport for more info as well.   Thanks!"
softwaregore,3dqcl4,oscillating000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:57:51 2015 UTC,"Sounds reasonable to me. In older SSDs, the number of times that a sector can be read/written is relatively low, so you're right to worry about keeping your page file there (though recently, SSDs have evolved so that this is less of an issue; you may want to consult the manufacturer's specs for your drive)."

Wells Fargo charged me a $30 fee every time the request came through, and again when they denied the charge...  Why in the fuck would they not just deny the charge? They sent money that I didn't have, then rejected the charge and returned that amount to my balance. Except that process was sending me $60 further into the negative each and every time.   I use a prepaid card now, and I'm far happier now than I was with a bank. There are no fees (the monthly fee is waived if you direct deposit a certain amount) and no overdraft. If I don't have enough money in there to cover an unexpected charge, it just gets declined. It has its disadvantages, but those are far outweighed by not having to deal with a bank."

I'm sure there's some con that I'm not aware of, but it worked for me. I was able to settle with Wells Fargo for half of what I owed, and I haven't looked back.

softwaregore,3d9xtq,Miningdude,14,Tue Jul 14 20:46:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the encouragement friend! :]  As a hobbyist developer who rarely talks about his game, every encouraging word goes a long way.  It really means a lot to see someone get excited.  I love the robo-flamingo/gnome idea!  It reminds me of the security camera gnomes outside Zim's house, which is actually the perfect example of a non-human trying to act human but failing.  In fact, I think I will model them after those gnomes exactly, I'd be a fool to pass up the opportunity of incorporating an Invader Zim reference.  I am in the process of making this game already, it's called You Are God.  It's a roguelike citybuilding life and God simulator, which aims to take all the fun mechanics possible from modern games and put them into a classic tiled roguelike open world.  It centers around you being a God with a single follower, which limits your Godlike abilities to basically nothing (except for your control over the follower's life).  You then choose to go out and appease other Gods for quick benefits, or attempt to battle them and convert their followers to grow your own God's powers.  The robot house is just a sidequest.    If you're interested, I have been updating /r/YouAreGod as the main development blog with each new feature as I implement it.  I'm a bit backlogged on creating the new features posts right now, but I work on the game every day at least a little."

softwaregore,3d9kvi,gigabyte898,2,Tue Jul 14 22:44:44 2015 UTC,"Basically when you want to put a sting/variable inside of a string. In the language I program in it looks like \(string name here). For example, if I was calling an API for a weather forecast and wanted to use string interpolation to insert my API key my code would look like this. The API key and base url will always be the same, so I'll use the ""let"" prefix.  let apiKey = ""private api key goes here""   locationCode = ""location ID here""  let baseURL = NSURL(string: ""api.websitetoaccess.com/\(apiKey)/"")   Now if I wanted to get the forecast instead of typing out api.websitetoaccess.com/(apiKey)/forecast/manuallyTypedLocation every time, I can just add  forecastURL = NSURL(string: ""forecast/\(locationCode)/"", relativeToURL: baseURL)   What seems to have happened is wikibot stored the last part of the URL, Blowfish_(cypher), as a variable and the parenthesis messed up the string interpolation since it would be ""\(Blowfish_(cypher))"". Because of the extra "")"" the code thinks the string terminates early, but is left with another. It senses an error and returns the wikipedia error JSON text, which is ""See https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php[2] for API usage"" in this case"

It is sometimes referred to as the ""OEM font"" or ""high ASCII"", or as ""extended ASCII""  (one of many mutually incompatible ASCII extensions).  In a strict sense, this character set was not conceived as a code page; it was simply the graphical glyph repertoire available in the original IBM PC. This character set remains the primary font in the core of any EGA and VGA-compatible graphics card. Text shown when a PC reboots, before any other font can be loaded from a storage medium, typically is rendered with this ""Code Page"".  Many file formats developed at the time of the IBM PC, such as .nfo, define this as the default encoding.

softwaregore,3cydeg,StovardBule,3,Sun Jul 12 10:51:34 2015 UTC,Probably about 1/1000th of that. Maybe. No-one really knows how much data there is on the internet but it's probably big enough to be measured in hundreds or thousands of exabytes. (Fun bonus fact: 1000EB is called a Yottabyte)
softwaregore,3cydeg,Nicksaurus,2,Sun Jul 12 12:43:29 2015 UTC,"Fun bonus fact: 1000EB is called a Yottabyte   No, that's a zetabyte; 1000 zetabytes is a yottabyte."

softwaregore,3cwt3u,thinkythought,5,Sun Jul 12 02:37:16 2015 UTC,"POS technician here, this is spot on.  In systems where the printer and/or register isn't fixed to the counter(or within the same physical case, if separate internally) there's often a stupid stack of adapters. rj45 to db25, db9 to rj45 on the other end, possibly split rj45 into rj14 for drawers coming out of either the POS or the printer or daisy chained... you get the idea. It varies between both software packages and hardware on the terminal and printer/drawer sides.   The point is both the adapters AND the cables slowly get fucked up from stuff getting shifted around and the cables(which are often managed/routed fairly taught) getting tugged, especially if they're crimped cables and not the factory melted together style.   And you get stuff like this.  I knew that your description was the issue before i even opened the thread, with relation to it being a bad connection on a pin. I had no idea why that pin having a bad connection would present specifically this way though. So yea, awesome post."

softwaregore,3cwjci,5225225,3,Sun Jul 12 08:24:10 2015 UTC,Just recreated this in there
softwaregore,3cwjci,Moppko,5,Sun Jul 12 17:29:51 2015 UTC,"while (true) { echo -n ""\x1b[$(seq 30 37 | sort -R | head -n1)m"" ; echo -n ""\x1b[$(seq 40 47 | sort -R | head -n1)m"" ; dd if=/dev/urandom count=1 bs=1 2>/dev/null | tr -cd ' -~' }   zsh only, maybe someone else can tell me what zsh only feature thing I'm using and fix it.  Fires off 4 processes per character, so you get that cool matrix slow typing effect because this just isn't efficient. It's shit, but it's a shell 1liner to do this. (well, depending on your screen size, it may be more than one line)  import random import sys import time  def printit():     sys.stdout.write(""\x1b[{}m\x1b[{}m{}\x1b[m"".format(         random.randrange(30, 37),         random.randrange(40, 47),         chr(random.randrange(32, 127)),     ))  for _ in range(int(sys.argv[1])):     printit()  sys.stdout.flush() time.sleep(50000)   is another thing. Takes character count as an argument, and will print up to that and then stop. This is a lot quicker than the shell version."

softwaregore,3cwjci,i336_,6,Sat Jul 11 23:30:40 2015 UTC,It's the computer's way of saying kkillllllll mmeee
softwaregore,3cwjci,i336_,4,Sat Jul 11 20:13:59 2015 UTC,"On Linux, if you drop to the text console (CTRL+ALT+F1 or similar) you can get this exact effect.  If you get a framebuffer on bootup, adding one or more of vga=normal nofb nomodeset video=vesafb:off i915.modeset=0 to your kernel commandline (it should be fine to add the whole thing) should disable it temporarily, which will give you the same effect as you see in this picture. You do not need to do this though - it's purely for effect, and will only look 100% ideal on CRT screens anyway.  Now to the ""art"" :D  First of all, if you like, hide the cursor for better aesthetics:  echo -ne '\e[?25l'   Now, as root, try running this repeatedly:  dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/vcsa 2>/dev/null; read   The read is there so you don't see your prompt at the bottom of the screen. If you'd prefer to be able to repeatedly hit Up/Enter, set  PS1=   So your prompt is an empty string. (You may also need to empty out PROMPT_COMMAND; if you're using zsh and have prompt functions defined, you likely know how to disable them :P lol)  You can also try this:  while true; do dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/vcsa 2>/dev/null; sleep 0.1; done   To stop it, hit ^C a few times.  To turn your cursor back on:  echo -ne '\e[?25h'   One way to slow the output down would be install PipeViewer, pipe dd through pv, and play with pv's -r (rate) option.  All of this is temporary and is lost if you reboot.  ""What am I running here?!""  /dev/vcsa is Linux's direct screen memory interface - it stands for Virtual Console Screen Attributes; /dev/vcs is the non-attribute-inclusive version. Both interfaces let you directly read and write the contents of the text console; because reading might scrape sensitive info, and because writing can directly influence the contents of the screen for any effect (eg, a fake Password prompt), /dev/vcsa requires root. Now, /dev/vcs is text-only; since the vcsa version lets you write attributes too, you can control everything: foreground/background color, intensity, flashing... the lot. There is a proper format you're supposed to use, but the interface is properly sanitized before display, so it's safe to feed it garbage input from /dev/urandom.  Once you send a full screenful of data to /dev/vcsa it reports that it's full, so dd will complain No space left on device; the 2>/dev/null squashes that. The read makes it pause and not show your prompt at the bottom, if you haven't nuked your prompt with PS1=. Together with the hidden cursor you set above, your screen will look exactly like this picture.  Cursor control and a lot more are controlled by escape sequences; a good source of info can be found by Googling ""dtterm 5"" (quite a few terminal emulators support the commands found there, and a lot more now besides).  Feel free to ask any other questions!"

softwaregore,3cse54,Climax_Of_Jelly,12,Fri Jul 10 16:49:13 2015 UTC,I've never really had that problem except on sites that depend on ads to position the content of the page.  But I guess it could happen.
softwaregore,3cse54,compdog,13,Fri Jul 10 16:50:52 2015 UTC,"Occasionally you get a poorly written filter that blocks e.g. ""*ads.jpg"" which then blocks ""downloads.jpg"". Or you get an article about ads, with its images in a path like "" blah/ads/1.jpg"". Or some sites put all images in such a directory to try to fool ad blockers.  And then on some sites it's just hard to tell programmatically what's an ad and what's not. Everything under one directory with meaningless names, the same place on the page sometimes has an ad and sometimes non-ad content, etc.  There's a cat and mouse game between the advertisers and the ad blockers, so sometimes they don't work reliably."
