arrow,3e0he6,WW4O,7,Tue Jul 21 16:19:39 2015 UTC,People like Grundy because he's been a part of the comics since the 1940's. He has had some seriously awesome depictions over the years as well.

If a vacation was all he needed, then I'm going to be disappointed."
arrow,3dyhwj,ForIAmTalon,11,Mon Jul 20 17:38:32 2015 UTC,"No doubt I absolutely agree in the sloppy writing part. It's just, that the avenue they've taken and It sort of makes sense. I guess we should just appreciate the fact that we're getting a more comic book Oliver.   A side note, I was thinking of Avatar the last airbender, not sure if you've seen it, and comparing Aang's journey to Olivers. Both have huge responsibilites on their hands and are really commited to their cause. However, they also want to be free and normal. It was clear from a few episodes in Avatar that all Aang needed was to realise he wasn't in the war by himself. He had others, same situation with Oliver. Aang in the end, understood this, but Oliver didn't. It took him all too long to realise he didn't have to be on a lonely crusade so when it hit him, albeit too late, he went all out and decided to say good bye. What I would have loved for his 180 turnaround to be was when Thea found out and was happy. With all card of the table: Laurel and Thea being the main ones for me, I wanted that to be the moment when he stops worrying about others and starts realising it's a team game and eventually opens up.   Sorry if none of that made sense. I'm procrastinating and just binged Avatar for the 100th time in the off-season.   Anyway, maybe the opening of the first episode will be:  My name is Oliver Queen and after 5 years in hell all I needed was a holiday..."

arrow,3dz33v,MTSL-Mantra,3,Tue Jul 21 16:14:28 2015 UTC,"Yet another example of DC (maybe its WB above them?) stepping on their own tails. First decide the TV and movie universes will be separate, but still limit what the now entirely publicly separate TV universe is allowed to use. Kill off fan favorite things because you're tapping into that for a feature film and you're worried about possible confusion from a casual audience. Anyone who would be confused at the notion of having two separate Suicide Squads (just as the most immediate example) is probably not watching the show in the first place, otherwise they'd probably be able to figure it out. It's not exactly complicated to put together that they're different things since the movies aren't going to reference the Flash or Green Arrow, and the TV shows have never thought to bring up the destruction of Metropolis and aliens.  I read a fair amount of the comics, too, so DC's continued missteps just takes a toll on me as a fan. I don't see how we couldn't have a fully fleshed out TV universe, like the fans all want, and still have a fully functioning movie universe. No one is asking for Batman on this show, or Superman, the Flash is probably the closest thing to an A-lister we'll get. But a GL movie isn't coming out for another 5 years, if that, and that's technically assuming none of their plans go awry before that to throw a monkey wrench in the entire cinematic universe. Stuff like this makes me fear for the future of these shows, are they going to limit what the Flash can do as it gets closer to the film?   tl;dr I'm tight, don't separate your universes and continue to nitpick what the TV universe is allowed to do their own way"

arrow,3dylnd,baronlz,6,Mon Jul 20 19:17:03 2015 UTC,"Because the writers fucked up her death. In GoT when they kill a character off they finish their plot. Sara's story was unfinished. Although Island Sara was dreaming of her family to survive the Island, she was mad at Laurel (see here). Then she comeback. Laurel cry because you know, what a terrible thing, her sister came back from the dead. And then we have this scene ""please don't hate me Sara"" Great scene to help us understand to position of Laurel, and that's it for the Laurel/Sara relationship? Sara should have HATED her. But she was in crisis, she was haunted by her past and she felt like she had a darkness in her, and that it made her not worth being mad.  Her murder didn't make sens. We lack the moment where Sara tells Laurel what she felt all those years. If you want a good reason in the plot we don't need one. Merlyn is the new Ras Al Ghul? He has a daughter that is mad at him because she killed Sara? DONE."

I could see some potential if they make the returned character a horrible version of their former self. Like, the Sara we knew and loved is gone, and she becomes a real menace to Team Arrow. Maybe somewhere down the line she kills a beloved character, the death still has that emotional impact."

There was never a real relationship or dependance which I reckon would have been great.

Maybe he disappears  in the flashbacks the same time he reappears in the present.  My only beef would be if he were to become like Deadshot, but I don't see that happening since the Green Lantern Corps movie doesn't show up until 2020 I think.

Arrow did some of the same, Laurel is the second and she has a canary cry. Laurel's mom Dinah kept Quentin's last name Lance, but her maiden is Drake.

arrow,3dyjto,rpratt34,6,Mon Jul 20 17:58:20 2015 UTC,"i have this theory that alot of laurel and oliver's arc to being endgame was given over to olicity.  like they never intended for felicity to be as deeply romantic for oliver or if she was be a fling like sara or mckenna.    but there was something about the calm, the fallen and i am oliver queen (especially the last episode which was written by ak, gb ) that made it seem like it was part of their 5/6 year plan.    that it was originally laurel that oliver asks out in the begining of season 3, pines for during season 3 and thinks of when he dies and leaves with at the end of season. while they are apart laurel trains and becomes the bc.  oliver being against it makes much more sense if he was in love with her (like he was more against laurel going in the field than thea his baby sister) but laurel does so anyway but they end up leaving the city at end of season 3.  and i have a theory season 4 and mg/wm are talking about how olicity will stay together but have to find a way to have a relationship and work together at the same time that mg was originally planning season 4 to be when bc/ga begin to start making up their working relationship and being the tag team from the comics.   leaving season 5 and 6 with an established bc/ga dynamics and them fighting villains together.   which is why in many ways i don't see oliver and laurel as endgame because imo so much of their story wouldn't make sense anymore because it wasn't told.   when mg told lauriver fans about the marathon that was from what i recall in season 1 when they thought they would be doing all this build up in season 2/3/4.  they basically stopped any romantic build up between them in season 2 and it doesn't sound like there will be any in season 4 either.  then again i'm a firm believer that endgame is more about actor's contract, series renewals, ratings and so forth than it is about storyline but i think that laurivers chances don't look good but i'm biased as fuck.  ;)"
arrow,3dyjto,amaryllisstar,2,Mon Jul 20 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"You're one of the only Olicity fans who makes sense. I don't care if he ends up with Laurel/Sara. As a kid I loved the relationship between BC/GA and I wouldn't mind seeing it on the TV show. The reason I hate Olicity is because majority of the fan base is toxic. I know Lauriver fans are quite bad, but Olicity fans are on another level."
arrow,3dyjto,rpratt34,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:00:53 2015 UTC,"oliver being against it makes much more sense if he was in love with her (like he was more against laurel going in the field than thea his baby sister)   I think he does still have some love for her though, (just not in a romantic sense, rather in a ""you're a person who has always been in my life and always will be"" sense), and he's also got a pile of guilt over Sara as well, and the combo of that made it believable to me why he was so anti her being in harm's way by doing the vigilante thing.  I think Thea's a slightly different case, because Merlyn.  Thea being his daughter makes her more entrenched in that violent aspect of the world, and she'd essentially had half a year's worth of League training by the time the season started, so Oliver can't really keep her out of it even if he wants to.  Laurel wasn't that involved in that side of things though, and he wanted to keep her out of it if possible.  Anyway, agreed with the other stuff you said.  It's not hard to see how things could have been tweaked to have it be Laurel instead of Felicity, and the fact that they went full steam ahead with the Felicity option says to me that Lauriver in a romantic sense just isn't a priority for the writers any longer, (which I'm fine with, because as much as I love Oliver, Laurel deserves better).  Honestly I wouldn't really buy it if within a season or two they're suddenly pining for each other again when there's been no indication of it for so long now, while they've been showing him fall madly in love with another woman, no less.  (It's not like Laurel hasn't been around to distract him while he's been falling for Felicity, so I don't see how he could have fallen for Felicity so comprehensively if any part of him was still thinking, ""what if"" about Laurel, so it'd be odd to me if he's ever all about Laurel again.  And Laurel seems pretty done with Oliver in a romantic sense too.)  I think they can still build up the GA/BC crimefighting partnership just fine, (the jump and catch off the roof was a thing of beauty, and I enjoy seeing them butt heads, so more of all of that please), without them having to shoehorn the romance angle back in."
arrow,3dyjto,theapplefour,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:20:12 2015 UTC,"Actually MG told Lauriver fans at the end of season 3 to think of the show as a marathon not a sprint, but I see where you are going with your other points. However if they want the story to come full circle they will have to somehow connect Oliver's hardcore love for Laurel when he first returned from the island. Either way even if he stays with Felicity, Olicity fans wont be happy about the flashbacks because come season 5 they are gonna have to show his desire to see her again or that would create big flaws in their writing."
arrow,3dyjto,rpratt34,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:16 2015 UTC,they kinda already did that didn't they with the flashbacks in which he comes into starling and supposedly he was in love with laurel that whole time in flashback/season1 but when oliver returned to starling he didn't have any reaction when he saw her nor did he try to contact her nor had the picture?  unless i missed something from that epsiode....

arrow,3dyjto,rpratt34,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:26:37 2015 UTC,"they've imo already retconned a good portion of oliver's feelings for her flashback wise.  like i was rewatching season 1 arrow and the show was like ""he was thinking of her the entire time and was in love iwth her and regretted his mistake for 5 years root for them!"" and then in season 2 there is shado, then season 3 she's not mentioned in the flashbacks.  like it doesn't make sense that he would somehow re: fall in back love with her in season4/5 flashback without her knowing.  i don't know.  it's sloppy either way."
arrow,3dyjto,amaryllisstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:42:26 2015 UTC,"Well at least we can agree on that, they have retconned quite a few things yet continually state they never have. I mean they did the same thing to Felicity this season. I understand she need to have some emotional breakdowns to show growth but its almost as if she completely lost her charm and when she turned her back on Roy and Diggle when Oliver left it didn't seem like something Felicity would ever do. They seemed to have removed Laurel and Thea's sisterly friend ship although Guggenheim assures fans that will be evident this season. These other examples may only be little things compared to what you've stated but these little things add up."
arrow,3dyjto,rpratt34,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:50:54 2015 UTC,"Remember, this show likes to work in parallels so in season 5 Oliver will be pining for Laurel and wants to get off the island and return to Starling City. I believe something happens in the Flashbacks that makes Oliver wanting to leave his self exile and return. I believe its news of Laurel going up against the same people on his list. I think the love for Laurel in flashbacks will be same in present day. Remember also Green Arrow and Black Canary didn't meet and fall in love until they were working together in the JSA, and I think that is what we are heading towards.  For me Felicity represents an idolised view of the world he wants to have, that viewpoint will change when he becomes Green Arrow and his feelings will change. Remember also this is really the first season that Green Arrow & Black Canary will be working together, so they've still got their issues to resolve which they will do so in due course and trust, friendship and I believe love will grow.  Oliver hated her becoming Black Canary, hated her training with another guy and was concerned for her even in season 2 finale - he wanted to protect her. You have to remember also that they both think that love for them is not a possibility for them anymore, time will change that thinking."
arrow,3dyjto,amaryllisstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:59 2015 UTC,I'm in full agreement with you. My only fear however is how they will handle the fall out of him and Felicity (if it ever happens) because even though I don't support the relationship clearly this is something that is going to have a resounding affect on Oliver and I fear they will Gwen Stacy her as the one that could have been. I believe that would really diminish what Felicity has and probably will do for Oliver as well as diminish her character more than season 3 already did.  I also really like your point about his idolized view of the world and its something I have been saying to fans of the Olicity pairing for a long time. It may be great now and hell it may even be great for a little while but down the road the way he lives his life and how he views the world will eventually get in the way of how Felicity views it and what she wants out of life. Felicity is the girl he would dream of having in a perfect world but they don't live in a perfect world and never will. Laurel and Oliver clearly don't fit in a perfect world they fit in one that has mortals fighting against gods basically. This world in wild and will continue to get wilder as the show progresses.
arrow,3dyjto,ExcitedForNothing,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:51 2015 UTC,"I've always said that when Green Arrow and Black Canary start fighting alongside one another is when their relationship will rebuild. I think season 4 is about the rebuilding phase. They will need to have a lot of trust in one another and respect to be able to rely on each other when their backs are against the wall. I know Laurel would die for Oliver and Oliver would do the same. It's the mortal danger that brings people closer together, and for me season 4 is about those first steps in the rebuild process.  I don't think they will kill off Felicity, but what they may do is have Felicity walk away from the relationship that way keeping her character in tact. I don' think it will be made into a big love triangle, but more a slow understanding that things will never work out and one decides to make the hard decision and walk away.   I think they'll also have a guy character waiting in the wings for Felicity to pick her up when she does."
arrow,3dyjto,amaryllisstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:16 2015 UTC,That would make the most sense and honestly the only way that the backlash from the Olicity fans is not catastrophic is if there is no crazy deep love triangle and its Felicity who walks away as the bigger person. Which honestly would fit better with everything anyway.  The mortal danger is also something I really agree with. Sure Felicity has been in those situations before but on occasion. Laurel and Oliver will be side by side in mortal danger constantly as they fight side by side each night once he comes back to Star City.
arrow,3dyjto,theapplefour,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"the backlash from olicity fans will be catastrophic if oliver so much as breathes in the same direction as laurel.  many want her off the show just to secure their ship so i'm not sure they would be that magnamous.   i mean ray was already a great guy for felicity- perfect for her but they hated him so i cannot imagine them ever accepting lauriver and felicity/someoneelse.  EPs, actors should just go on social media lockdown for a few months  if they ever were to do that and prepare for inevitable boycott and backlash.  by this time, oliciters for better or worse know how to get entertainment media attention (names of the reporters, how to reach them and so on ) and they aren't a quite bunch.  it'll be klaroline all over again!  (which goes to my point that endgame is more decided on actor's contracts, etc etc than storyline)"
arrow,3dyjto,amaryllisstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:03:25 2015 UTC,I know we have talked about it before but you have to see how toxic that is as a fanbase. It's basically saying that this subsection of fans control the entire show because they will start a social media rampage because something doesn't go their way. Thats acting like 5 year old children and people need to grow up.

arrow,3dyjto,Tahu136,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:45 2015 UTC,"Although I disagree with you, ultimately your point about ratings, renewals and actors is the grand takeaway.  Also, DC's insistence that although Arrow and Flash are nice as a TV series, the movie universe is their focus.   Oliver could end up in a relationship with Malcolm or his sister by the end of the series and it wouldn't mean anything for the established lore of the other instances of Oliver Queen/Green Arrow.  While on the topic, I'm not sure which is less healthy: those who violently and vehemently demand a relationship between Felicity and Oliver or those who violently and vehemently demand a faithful retelling of the comic books."
arrow,3dyjto,mvals,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:24:01 2015 UTC,"also i think asides from not being able to use characters they didn't ""buy"", i think the tv show runners have leeway to do with what they want on the tv show.  like gg martin once said that got showrunners coud have aliens and he coudln't do shit about it."
arrow,3dyjto,bluetycoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:45 2015 UTC,"I have a theory also that they never intended for Laurel to be with Oliver during her crucible and training period that they did intend him to be with other women, I think in the end they decided to fan service the Olicity fans by going with Felicity. For a slow burn they didn't half rush and push Oliver and Felicity together. For me the slow burn is Oliver and Laurel.   One of the main reasons they wouldn't put them together is they are following comic book canon - if they were together, then it would make sense that Oliver would train Laurel, which in the comics we know never happened. The wanted to show her origin story as well which is her first trainer Wildcat, it's just a shame the mucked up that storyline by not securing the actor for the full season.  Also we know that from canon that Oliver and Dinah didn't meet until they were Green Arrow and Black Canary and were fighting together on missions for the JSA. I definitely think that this is where the story is going, and season 4 will start to see this happen. Actually Katie Cassidy said that Laurel will be involved in the creation of LoT, and we know that Dinah was a founding member of the JSA. To me this story line sounds very similar. And there should be lots of witty banter between GA & BC when they pair up to fight alongside one another, as GA has a big ego. So yes Olicity may be around for most of or all of season 4 I think we will see things change in season 5."
arrow,3dyjto,booklover13,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:48 2015 UTC,but how do you explain their lack of romantic relationship or even real strng frienship or even that many scenes in season 3?  do you think that was intended from the start?
arrow,3dyjto,booklover13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:04:24 2015 UTC,"Yes I do, because season 2 was about isolating Laurel and sending her on her dark path.  Season 3 is about her becoming Black Canary and her training. Season 4 is about embodying Black Canary even more, better fighter and more confident about her abilities. While Oliver went on his identity arc to eventually he becomes Green Arrow. For me they are too heavy handed in season 3, to make Olicity believable they try and take her out of the picture - otherwise it would look like four people in the relationship - Ray, Felicity, Oliver and Laurel, and five if you count Wildcat who was supposed to be Laurel's love interest for that season. They wanted him to be face the problem of being Oliver Queen vs Arrow - yet we all know he is to become Green Arrow. So he needed to have a focus the dream of having a perfect life vs his life of misery. If we think that Oliver Queen has found complete happiness by the opening of season 4 with potential 2-3 seasons to go, I think that would be wishful thinking.  But let's face it season 3 was a complete mess and for me they never sold the romance angle for Oliver and Felicity well at all, it felt flat.   Season 4 is about rebuilding that  relationship from the ground upwards, as it got stripped back to nothing.  Oliver and Dinah are not connected in the comics until they are Green Arrow and Black Canary, when they fight alongside one another and it takes a lot of time before she lets her guard down. She thinks he's a jerk, until one day she doesn't.   There will always something special that happens between Oliver and Laurel, they've been through so much together and yet they still want to be in each other's lives."

The writers have worked a long way for her to transform into Black Canary and going back to Oliver would just be going back.   Now, Oliver and Sara would be awful, she belongs with Nyssa."

The pieces are there, it coincides with what's established in the comics, and she's been an important character on the show since it started.  It just makes too much sense.  I could almost put money on the fact that this show will either end with Oliver proposing to Laurel or with them having been married through the two final seasons (with plenty of marital drama for the fans)."

They don't want to put all their eggs in one basket but at the same time they dont want to devalue their product (as you have mentioned).  So if for some wild reason (fingers crossed that it doesn't) that DC Cinematic Universe FAILS horribly, then they could totally just say ""fuck this"" and CW has full control of the DC characters. Therefore CW is no way connected to the failure of a film universe.  Also works the other way around where if CW does not make a satisfactory product (*cough S3 in my opinion by the way you can form your opinion and no spoilers since you seem to be behind) then no characters were ""wasted"" by the CWverse that wont need unnecessary retconning to reintroduce them to the DC Cinematic.  Now to shed some positive light on this, we can just say that they have a wonderful opportunity to introduce multiple universes and cross dimensional stuff which can really be used for very unique story telling that wouldn't be possible or meaningful at all. This case is a truly coincidental type of scenario. If this is done however, they have to balance it in such a way cause not everybody watches the CW/Arrowverse so non-viewers will be like ""wtf is this???? who is this??? why are there 2 of the same characters??? i'm so confused!!!"" that's a downside too cause they might have to officially introduce them in the film universe as coming from another universe which can be watched on tv!......and the common view that television is not up to quality (actors, budget, script) so not taken as seriously as films are (though shit films do exist).

If they hadn't killed him off immediately then it might have been ok, but by killing him off they eliminated the possibility of an amazing character."

arrow,3dvjjs,ForIAmTalon,2,Sun Jul 19 22:11:22 2015 UTC,The problem with Komodo is that he's a reduntant character with Arrow's rendition of Malcolm Merlyn..
arrow,3dvjjs,Quiversan,3,Sun Jul 19 22:14:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly. For Season 5, I'd take Merlyn out for a while. I'd bring on Komodo and for S6 do Outside Wars. Komodo should become that villain who Oliver always struggles to beat. It should have been Merlyn. But I hate what they've done to the character."
arrow,3dvjjs,ForIAmTalon,0,Sun Jul 19 22:18:05 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't be very possible, unfortunately.  The most threatening thing they can use Komodo for, is have him work for Merlyn and hunt Laurel down. Merlyn knows Laurel is currently the closest person to Nyssa, so hurting her means hurting Nyssa and he gets to keep his throne.  As for Merlyn I'd take him out permanently. I so badly want a Nyssa vs Merlyn arc that ends with Nyssa killing Merlyn. We shall see."
arrow,3dvjjs,Quiversan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:24:07 2015 UTC,Why would Komodo work for Merlyn isntead of the Outsiders and build a greater arc? LOL
arrow,3dvjjs,stormesp,0,Sun Jul 19 22:38:28 2015 UTC,Because I highly doubt they'd do an Outsiders arc. Plus the current Komodo is pretty weak and wasn't exactly very impressive.  Of course they can always reboot him like they did with Vertigo.

I've loved Thea since day fucking one. My biggest complaint is that Roy hasn't stuck around as Red Arrow and she didn't become Cheshire.   And as for your ""complaints"" about crying too much, have you not watched Season 3? They neutered pretty much anything that made Felicity stand out from other romantic side characters. She was crying in at least every episode after The Fall. Then in one of the worst fan-service episodes on the face of the planet where instead of focusing on the incredibly important existence of the Lazarus pit the focus was instead on Felicity finally fucking Oliver and then from that point on she got even worse as a character (e.g. Roy stop making a cure for the super bad virus and go save the guy I totally cheated on you with!).

What he was ""smoking"" was having Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg writing/producing full time for Arrow. They unofficially stepped away from Arrow last season to focus on The Flash, and may very well do the same thing to The Flash this season to focus on Supergirl."

Berlanti and Kreisberg decided to focus on The Flash because Arrow was already established and they wanted to help get the new show off the ground. They've now added another EP for the fourth season of Arrow to help Guggenheim out.... unfortunately, she's the one who so proudly wrote the Oliver/Felicity Nanda Parbat sex scene.  The Supergirl part is my own assumption based on the same above logic. With Arrow and The Flash having already been established now, it's entirely possible that they'll want to focus on launching Supergirl."

arrow,3dvjij,my-asshole,7,Sun Jul 19 21:52:02 2015 UTC,"What you need to know is that Wildcat is one of the best fighters in the DC universe. Laurel also had some self defence training, this was explained in Season 1. Nysaa is also a brilliant fighter so she learnt a lot from her. Lets be honest the LoA members are pretty shit. I saw some in S2 and just laughed. Diggle is just strong, I don't know if he actually has a fighting style. Everytime I see him he just randomly swings punches against people who are trained to dodge bullets. Thea is capable of kicking both Laurels and Diggles ass at the same time. If she can go toe to toe with Merlyn, than she can beat the pair of them. However Season 3 was quite bad in terms of development. In my opinion Laurel was the only one who had soem development....maybe even Deadshot."

So then I guess my problem falls back to a rushed new character introduction/feeling squeezed in (hello Ray).."
arrow,3dvjij,Quiversan,3,Sun Jul 19 22:36:35 2015 UTC,"The problem with Wildcat is that they couldn't do much with him when the actor got signed to another show, so they scrapped him in episode 12."
arrow,3dvjij,ForIAmTalon,2,Sun Jul 19 23:05:15 2015 UTC,I feel bad for Ray. He wasn't given enough screen time and they had too change last minute. They wanted Ted Kord and DC said NO! So thats why he acts like that on the show. They ended up going with Palmer and he never got enough screen time to develop. I feel like if Felicity hadn't cried as much we would have seen more Ray.
arrow,3dvjij,1dererLives,2,Sun Jul 19 22:51:36 2015 UTC,"What you need to know is that Wildcat is one of the best fighters in the DC universe.    A character is only as good as they are on the show. Comic portrayals are irrelevant.    Diggle is just strong, I don't know if he actually has a fighting style.   He's a trained special forces soldier. His hand to hand combat skills should be extremely advanced, top-percentile stuff. That type of soldier essentially gets taught a more brutal, no-holds-barred form of MMA."
arrow,3dvjij,Quiversan,11,Mon Jul 20 16:36:39 2015 UTC,"I mean.. The only time Laurel power level is off is during episode 21, but even then she had spent almost 3 months training with Nyssa (who happens to be the heir to the demon, more versed in the leagues way of fighting more than anyone) so it's not too hard to accept it there either. In Episode 18 she fought side by side with Roy, that's not to mention she was clearly taken down during the fight.  They didn't just say she's not her sister, but they showed it pretty clearly time after time. But even then, Laurel has had years of self defense training, then a couple of months training with Wildcat, who almost beat Oliver in a hand to hand fight mind you, then trained with Oliver in the field, then got trained by Nyssa.    Sometimes you just have to suspend your disbelief because in the end it's a comic book show, things aren't exactly very realistic."
arrow,3dvjij,Dark-Courage,5,Sun Jul 19 22:08:14 2015 UTC,"I just have to say that I think the reasoning to put realism aside is completely irrelevant to what I wrote, of course it's not realistic, there are super heroes, I'm complaining about it being believable in the context to the fictional world.  The feeling I have with Laurel is that she has so many up and downs, I got no grip on that character at all, where she is loyalty-wise, skill-wise, other-wise. She just feels all over the place, like they don't know where to place her."
arrow,3dvjij,Dark-Courage,4,Sun Jul 19 22:42:49 2015 UTC,"Diggle can take on some league members for two reasons. He has a gun and its safe to assume Oliver has trained him also.

Season 2's last three episodes are essentially one story told over the course of three episodes. Throwing too much stuff at one episode is why the Season 3 finally was so bad.

KC is the fifth woman to play her on screen, and I have thought each of them were wonderful in their own ways.    Frankly, of all the things I like about Arrow, the writing for KC is the thing I like the least.  I don't find anything wrong with her acting, but I wind up feeling like the lines are not being written for her in a way that takes advantage of who she is.    KC has a very angular and serious face, and she pulls off a wide range of emotion, but too often the scenes that she is in fall flat with me, and especially in S3 dealing with being the Canary and Ollie's rejection of her in that role.  Between Wildcat and Nyssa, she is getting training, so I don't have a problem with that.  I don't have a problem with the outfit, nor the tech solution to the Canary Cry.  I don't have a problem with the Tonfas, the wig, or the character.  I wish she was given lines that were suitable to her acting abilities, and didn't come off as borderline cheese so often.    She has a very valuable spot on the team as the only person trained in law enforcement, and the only one of them running around with both a law degree, and experience on both sides of the aisle in the courtroom.  Talk about a team member who can let your Vigilante Crewe know exactly how to make that citizen's arrest stick!

Some fans (Some...not all Olicity fans) were supporting him into pushing Laurel down. Yet I haven't seen this guy do a video about how bad Felicity has been in S3.   plenty of people have been complaining about season 3 felicity, including EBR herself and a good portion of olicity fans. the trick to enjoying the show and the fandom is to ignore the extremist fringes altogether. nobody on that show deserves death threats, for instance. not even chase the DJ.  i think part of the problem is that arrow's version of felicity (as opposed to the original one from the firestorm comics) is basically a completely original character, whereas black canary (and therefore dinah laurel lance) is a huge deal in the arrow family and dc comics in general (JSA, JL, birds of prey, etc.). many fans have had really high hopes for laurel from the beginning just as an extension of the coolness of black canary in the comics and things like the DCAU. every time the show mishandles laurel, it's a bigger deal because we have preconceptions about who she's supposed to be or become.  maybe felicity gets a pass sometimes because we all know they're making her character up as they go. for instance, during season 3 we only had two seasons of arrow on which to base our understanding of felicity, whereas black canary has been around since 1947 and has already appeared on a number of tv shows, including two that aired on the WB/CW within the last 15 years.  if felicity does something we don't like, then that's just a character doing a dumb thing. if laurel does something we don't like, then that's a character doing something dumb in spite of that character's historical awesomeness, which tends to be more offensive."

IIRC, in S1, she had some character development there too, from going from being angry at Oliver to eventually treating him like a friend again."
arrow,3dqvj7,3rdOption,5,Sat Jul 18 18:13:57 2015 UTC,Yeah....I wish they had added in more scenes of them together. They had some cool scenes suring the flashbacks which were deleted.
arrow,3dqvj7,theapplefour,3,Sat Jul 18 18:25:37 2015 UTC,"Laurel Lance is my favorite character on the show, and Black Canary is my all time favorite comic book hero.   Personally I did not enjoy the way they introduced the Black Canary, as I found Sara's Canary arc uninteresting and a copy of Oliver's and nothing like the comic book canon story I love. I didn't start to enjoy  Sara until towards the end of season 2 when I felt she had more redemption, because for me she was a liar, thief, a cheat and someone who brought out the worst in people. For a hardened assassin at times they made her too cutesy with the remarks to Felicity, it seemed OOC. She should have been more darker than what she was.  I would have preferred if Oliver ran off with Laurel's best friend and that friend died, so you at least have the betrayal angle if they wanted to continue that. Then have Laurel slowly going down hill in those 5 years and learning to fight at the same time, so come season 1 she is quite skilled at fighting. During season 2 we see her come Black Canary after the events unfold. I didn't enjoy seeing my hero come a drug addict and drunk, especially in the comics it's Oliver who has a drinking problem. But that is all behind us now and we get to see in real time a female hero journey and one whose story and skills matches with the comics. Laurel is a street fighter, who has a big heart and fights for justice, she sees that light at the end of the tunnel. I really want to see that DLL snark, witt and sass from the comics introduced more. We've seen glimpses but, I hope we see a lot more.  Yep, love Laurel Lance."
arrow,3dqvj7,theapplefour,2,Mon Jul 20 00:39:24 2015 UTC,Sara was only on the show as a replacement for Dinah Drake Lance. She only existed due to the passing off the mantle from one family member (Dinah Drake) to another (Dinah Laurel).
arrow,3dqvj7,Quiversan,2,Mon Jul 20 09:10:13 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, Sara was only brought on as a guest character to tell the beginning of the Black Canary story, which is Dinah Drake ie they swapped Laurel's mom for Sara to mix it up."
arrow,3dqvj7,Quiversan,10,Mon Jul 20 11:22:39 2015 UTC,"Laurel Lance/Black Canary is my favorite character on the show currently, and the only reason I'm excited for S4. With that being said I have to point out one thing:   ""We watched her hold her own against multiple LoA members...but she struggled with a street thug.""    Is a viable complaint, in both ways it was bad writing. When Laurel first put on the mask, I liked the balance they created for the character, she's strong due to her training with Wildcat and her self-defense experience, but definitely not strong enough to be a competent vigilante. Hence we saw parts where she did great (when she took down the thug in the bar, when she fought Vertigo, when she jumped out of the window and held on to the rope), and parts where she failed miserably (her first encounter with the thug with the knife, when she tried jumping on the van). It was pretty believable and amusing to watch. Then they took off the focus on her for a while, she did okay but she wasn't spectacular which was exactly the level she was at. Then her training with Nyssa came and I believe it was an excellent decision. Then things started becoming seriously inconsistent when she in the same episode, got shanked by a thug, then took on 3 league of assassins members.  First, the thug. That scene was reminiscent to when she first started being Black Canary. However instead of showing how much she evolved from the newbie she was (spending around 3-4 months being a vigilante, getting trained by Oliver in the streets then getting intense training by Nyssa), they just repeated what happened in the past, she got shanked in the exact same way, and she froze in the exact same way.. so much for character development.. Instead she could've been taken by surprise but still handle him, then have Nyssa refer to her ""underestimating"" the opponent. That way it's shown that she's getting better, but she's not there yet.  Secondly, the LoA fight. Just.. no.. Don't get me wrong, it was fun to watch, and I enjoy watching her kick butt, but if I weren't biased as hell I'd be flabbergasted by how well she was doing. I'd rather she gets taken down, then comes back up and takes one of them down with a concussion, then blocks an attack then gets taken down again by the other assassin etc etc... Instead of skillfully blocking, parrying and countering every single move except for the last assassin.  The finale was just a great opportunity to display her skillfully and effortlessly taking down the assassin after all these months of training, and taking a beat then getting back up, unfortunately there just wasn't enough of the latter to make the pay-off satisfying. Because that's the kind of character they established. A determined, motivated vigilante who has a lot of heart and courage and just doesn't stop getting back up no matter how many times she falls down, but her lack of skill and sometimes arrogance affects her negatively.  Emotionally, her situation was understandable for the past two seasons (so was Thea's), but for the next season, I believe now that she's comfortably grown to her being a vigilante, and is as good as ever at being a lawyer, is that she'll start being more emotionally stable. I think her personality is a bit over the place at the moment, but again she wasn't exactly very stable due to the events that occurred to her. With that said, it's a better time than any to show her being more rational and idealistic and just show her protective/heroic side that was present in S1 but was clouded by all the relationship drama. It's also shown that Laurel has a similar smart mouth to her  comic book counter part, so I'd love to see more of that! In a nutshell, I just want to see a more established and consistent identity formed for her, now that her crucible came to an end.  Wow I just realized how long this turned out to be.   EDIT: Right I almost forgot that guy who said he'll quit if Laurel became BC did actually quit when it happened. Not that I mind, there's a fine line between senselessly complaining and maturely discussing the negatives, and he often did the former.   EDIT 2: I also forgot to mention that I LOVE what Katie does with her character, and I hope the quality of the story/scripting gets better so we can see more of her stronger moments. Frankly there are very little actresses I can envision being Dinah Laurel other than Katie now."

Not that I don't like Laurel, but Sara had a much more interesting story.   Comic wise, she is supposed to be a top five/ten martial artist in the world. While I like the slow burn story we're getting, she won't be that good for many many years. If Laurel had Sara's story she'd already be at that level and have a more interesting story."
arrow,3dqvj7,Quiversan,2,Sat Jul 18 20:29:55 2015 UTC,"Sara had a much more interesting story.   Maybe to you, I frankly found nothing interesting about Sara's story, pretty much the redeemer plotline with no twists, it was pretty predictable. Not saying I hate Sara, I actually really liked her, she was a solid character, just not Black Canary.  Comic wise, Oliver Queen is a pretty average martial artist, whereas on the show I think so far he's the best martial artist in the universe now that Ra's is dead. By the time S4 starts, it'd already be an almost whole year since Laurel started training, so her being one of the best fighters isn't exactly implausible by the time it's S6 or if they do another time skip.  Laurel's story is more interesting to me because it has more meat in it, plus it shows an average human being, who followed a pretty ""normal"" lifestyle, grow to be a vigilante, whereas Oliver has the crazier origins with his time on and off the island, and his dealings with multiple factions and organizations. Just creates a certain variety that imo keeps the stories fresh."
arrow,3dqvj7,Sultank,3,Sat Jul 18 21:04:13 2015 UTC,"I feel they've held back Laurel's character to make Oliver look like the best fighter out there, which we all know it's the other way around.

That's not to say the comics aren't great, rather that the show is its own thing that doesn't have to be completely faithful to the comics.

Both Black Canary and Green Lantern have accused him of liking to argue just to hear the sound of his own voice...and those are his friends.

Once he's more engaged legitimately, espousing ideas like economic justice, equality, equal protection, a social safety net and other more progressive ideas would make a lot of sense.

arrow,3dowki,TheExtremistModerate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:32:11 2015 UTC,I just feel that people are too concentrated on the ending and realize it's about the journey.
arrow,3dowki,Deathstroke317,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:10:32 2015 UTC,"Except you're wrong. Spoilers do ruin a lot for a lot of people. I've been spoiled a lot in my life, and every single time, I wish I hadn't been, because it ruined a lot of the fun for me.  Let me give an example. Game of Thrones:  I was spoiled 3 big things: Game of Thrones spoilers through Season 5 When I came to those points, it just wasn't a huge deal for me. I knew it was coming. And before those things happened, I'm just sitting and watching anticipating it happening, detracting from just watching the show. Those three events which were very very emotional in one way or another were ruined.  Let's contrast that to three other large things which I did not see coming, as they were not spoiled for me: Game of Thrones spoilers through Season 4 When the first one happened, I literally just sat there at the end of the episode thinking ""That didn't really happen, did it?"" Hell, I watched the episode certain that it didn't happen, only to finally accept it when I started watching Season 2. On the second one, again, I sat there in disbelief: ""this couldn't have happened, could it?"" And just as I was starting to accept that it had happened, that second part of it happened, and it was quite the experience. And the third one... Jesus Christ. That hit me like a load of bricks. A real kick in the groin. But I would not take back that moment, because I love getting invested in shows, and not knowing what's going to happen.  The excitement of watching a show for the first time, not knowing what's coming next, is something you can only get once. Once it's spoiled, there's no going back. And that feeling is precious to so many people, including me. So by spoiling people, you're taking away the one chance they have to watch a show completely uncorrupted and unspoiled.  I don't care if you don't care about spoilers, and they don't ruin your enjoyment of a show. But they do ruin mine, so don't be a jerk and go around spoiling things to people who you don't know, and very well may care quite a bit about spoilers."
arrow,3dowki,ShadowXjr,-6,Sat Jul 18 13:55:28 2015 UTC,"Personally, I feel like if you feel that spoilers ruin the experience for you, then you need to grow up.   I really couldn't care less how something ends because I don't watch something for the shock value. I watch for themes, plot structure and consistency and most importantly how they got to that point.  If one thing can ruin your entire experience then maybe it's not worth reading/watching."
arrow,3dowki,Deathstroke317,2,Sat Jul 18 20:16:34 2015 UTC,"How does feeling like spoilers ruin it mean you need to grow up? It juat means that each person has a different way of enjoying something. And for many people, including myself, we don't want to have something spoiled. And now you're probably going to say ""Well if you don't want it spoiled, don't come to this sub!"". But there's more to the sub than the stuff the spoilers are about, which is what many people come here for. So even if you don't mind it, don't spoil it for other people."
arrow,3dowki,ShadowXjr,-3,Sun Jul 19 01:49:37 2015 UTC,"No I wouldn't say that, that's a fairly stupid argument.

I also think and hope that we will see the rebuilding of Oliver and Laurel's deep friendship in season 4. I mean god she must trust him to throw herself of a high rise building knowing that he will catch her. I think working together as Green Arrow and Black Canary will be an important step in that relationship.  I've always believed that they buried their feelings for one another in season 2 because of Tommy's death, and overtime those feelings will come to the surface. I think Oliver will be in love with the two women, but Felicity will walk away.   I've also thought that the show likes to work in parallels and at the end of season 5 Oliver returns to Starling City with a goal to make amends with Laurel, as he was in love with her. Now they've hidden his feelings since part way through S2 and I think it will continue until he decides to come home to the girl he loves. I think something must happen in Starling to do that, and I think that is when Laurel starts her crusade against the same men on Oliver's list and he gets wind of it somehow. I think in season 5 is when we will see Oliver and Laurel's relationship/feeling really start to rekindle. I suspect Olicity will end either at the end of season or early in season 5.  God I think we deserve to see a relationship between two superheroes, that is a much more interesting dynamic to see than the hero and the IT geek. Superheroes in love is a rare thing to see, so I really hope they do get back together before the show ends and give it the time it needs."

arrow,3dszhw,Todrick,8,Sun Jul 19 04:15:46 2015 UTC,I LOVED her until season 3
arrow,3dszhw,lordderplythethird,8,Sun Jul 19 04:17:27 2015 UTC,"Felicity's character was awesome in season 1 and season 2, but they completely changed her in season 3, and she's became almost painful to watch on screen."
arrow,3dszhw,Virus_CaRNaGe,4,Sun Jul 19 05:41:39 2015 UTC,"I haven't been the biggest fan of her character in general, she cries way too much tho."
arrow,3dszhw,chenardizzle,3,Sun Jul 19 16:14:45 2015 UTC,"I was a big fan of Felicity in the earlier seasons. She was quirky and awkward which just furthered how adorable she was. Her style was a little childish, consisting of outfits that didn't really correlate well. She was the IT genius and was integral to team Arrow.  Ever since the episode where she goes into the gambling den in that red dress she's been thrust into a more sexually appealing role. She now seems to have a personal stylist on top of that. She isn't a strong character either, constantly worried about Oliver, ever crying or being used as the bait by Oliver's enemies.   I have hope that season 4 will turn the show around and get it good again, especially for Felicity, but time will tell."
arrow,3dszhw,ForIAmTalon,6,Sun Jul 19 21:30:30 2015 UTC,"I'm going to get downvoted but I don't care.  SPOILER!!! DO NOT READ AHEAD, IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SEASON 2.  Thea went from being a drug addicted, rebel child. She has now developed into a mature character. Roy went from being a street thug to becoming a hero. Oliver from a killer to a vigilante to know a hero. Laurel went from being a drug addicted, broken down character to becoming who she is now, a strong female character. Every single character has had some development since they were introduced except for Felicity. She has remained pretty much the same. Awkard IT girl who's in love with the hero.  I hated her since she was introduced. The actress (EBR) is average, she can only play an akward character. That was proven in S3 where she couldn't handle a single emotional scene. Maybe it was because the EP's asked too much but she was terrible at it.   I think most people really hate her due to her pathetic annoying fan base. Olicity fans have too be the worst fans on a TV show. They are so deluded. I only know one Olicity fan who has common sense and thats amaryllisstar (Who uses Reddit). None of the other fans would admit how terrible her character was last season, they go on Twitter and say ""Your tears were justified, because you were in love"". Yet when Thea was confused and watched her mother die, lose her father and step father (Walter) as well as find out about Malcolm and Tommy....""She's just a whiny teen""...Laurel who I wrote about yesterday, I mentioned how much her character has gone through. Yet Felicitys fan base constantly bash her and Thea for being Whiny for actually losing people. Someof us hate the actress/character while most of us hate her fan base."
arrow,3dszhw,M0ck5,-8,Sun Jul 19 13:47:02 2015 UTC,"That is your opinion. It would be great if you sounded less factual.   You clearly have not dealt with Vampire Diaries or Supernatural fan bases. Olicity fan base looks like candy compared to them.   Felicity has never gotten her own arc, its always been about others. Finally this year she gets her one arc."
arrow,3dszhw,ForIAmTalon,7,Sun Jul 19 15:14:30 2015 UTC,I don't know much about the VD fan base. But the Supernatural one is just as bad as Olicty. I've seen Olicity fans get EBRs head and stick it on Stephen Amells wives body. Or Photoshop her out and put EBR next to Amell. Lets hope she has a season to improve.
arrow,3dszhw,M0ck5,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:22:15 2015 UTC,"Always fringe people that do that kind of crap. Those people got bashes by the Olicity fandom. Most Olicity fans I've met, like watching the show, writing fan fiction, fan art, voting. I've seen some pretty disgusting Laurel fans calm Emily a cunt and fat, but I know not to associate it with a whole fandom. And the Olicity fandom is HUGE. law if averages mean bigger pool of jackasses."

arrow,3dnf16,Cavmo,49,Sat Jul 18 14:24:02 2015 UTC,"Just gonna leave the post I made two days ago when this same question was asked:  I don't have time to write 30,000 words, but I'll give you the outline  1.) The theme of the season, Oliver's identity, is only abstractly explored and it really didn't mean anything.  2.) The theme of Season 2 is almost totally forgotten about and contradicted.  3.) Despite devoting an entire episode to the idea that Oliver has learned that his tendency toward secrecy causes problems, that lesson is almost immediately forgotten.  4.) The overall arc of the season was paced poorly. They let it drag leading to the crossovers and then had to rush it leading to the finale.  5) To go along with #4, several stand alone episodes were either totally unnecessary or should have been held off for another time in order to let the season 3 arc breathe. The Ted Grant story with Laurel was unnecessary to the narrative as we know she already had some inadequate self defense training. We didn't need to see her get more inadequate self defense training. The Felicity back story should have been held off for season 4 where her back story is set to play a bigger role.  6.) The finale was a mess because there was too much story for one episode. The result was that they had to slam on the breaks at the end of the story of the bioweapons in order to wrap with the relationship stuff.  7.) The resolution to the bioweapons attack is told instead of shown. Without ever seeing how it affected a single Starling City, the whole thing was just totally abstract. No real dramatic tension.  8.) Too much looking ahead to Season 4. Even if you don't follow the news of the show, the constant mentions of Damien Darhk telegraph the resolution to this season and cuts the dramatic tension.  9) The condensed nature of the end of the season cut down on real moments that characters could have had. A longer more full climax to the season could have shown Ray Palmer being a hero in the midst of the attack as The Atom. That would have provided a better spring board for LoT. And there should have been a real moment where Oliver acknowledges Ray, not a head nod."
arrow,3dnf16,mikefarquar,26,Fri Jul 17 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"And this is ignoring some of the more specific problems people had, such as too much focus on Olicity, the failure of the Sara plotline, Komodo's single appearance, the waste of Wildcat, the end of Roy's story (still hoping he gets his own show or gets to come back).  There was Thea becoming a highly skilled fighter far too quickly and Laurel's slow yet realistic training.  Diggle was tragically underused this season (though I really dislike the idea of giving him a mask next year).  The Suicide Squad episode was kind of a waste, since Bronze Tiger is dead, and now Deadshot is ""dead"" (read: unusable at the moment).  The flashbacks were underutilized and predictable, and the payoff wasn't worth even the 5 minutes an episode they devoted to them.  Katana needed a better costume (though she was still pretty cool).  Ra's hooking Oliver up with Felicity, like, the day before he has Oliver marry Nyssa.  Felicity trying to free Oliver, then later blocking a bullet with a Windows tablet, and somehow throwing it with perfect accuracy at some LoA guy.  And on that note, the League was woefully underpowered.  I could probably go on, but I'm just rambling at this point, so I'll just stop."

This was my biggest problem with season 3, compared to the badass island flashbacks in the first 2 seasons, the China(and Starling City briefly... which was kinda dumb) flashbacks were just pretty boring and slow.

arrow,3dnf16,Undrtakr991,5,Fri Jul 17 19:18:12 2015 UTC,"The season sacrificed a lot of what made Season 1 and 2 great for the sake of relationships and individual stories that didn't mesh well together. Not to mention that they also made Ra's go from a force to be reckoned with, to just some pouty guy with a few good lines. I didn't get the sense that he was a huge threat by the finale like I did in ""The Climb"".  On a personal note, I really disliked Marc's ridiculous focus on Oliver and Felicity's relationship. It got to the point where it took away from the show. My focus, after some of their scenes, wasn't on the plot but rather how little that narrative meant to the season.   All their relationship needed to be was, ""Okay, lets see what we could be"" at the beginning of the season. Then the bad guy starts his plans causing drama. That drama ultimately causes a rift between Oliver and Felicity and they should've agreed that this wasn't the best time. Then after everything was said and done, they go on one more date in the finale so we don't get that driving-off-into-the-sunset-nonsense."

arrow,3dnf16,HollandGW215,4,Sat Jul 18 14:01:41 2015 UTC,"Also, season 2 was great because they had Arrow moving away from the gritty realism and start to introduce these supernatural enemies like Solomon Grundy.  Then season 3 comes along and that is all forgotten. The lazarus pit is hardly used like it was in the comics. Wildcat was wasted, Laurel's story was boring as ever.  Also, the biggest problem of season 3 is they just had too many heroes. This is a Green Arrow show, not Green Arrow's sidekicks show. I don't really care about Arsenal, Atom and Black Canary. They are fine, but Green Arrow needs to be the focus. Thats why I think Flash worked better, because he was also the main focus.   Lastly the the villain was poorly used. He took this high morale ground that made no sense and his ninja guys were dispatched way too easily.   Season 4 seems like they are making amends. They got rid of Roy and Atom and updating the costume. I am not too excited about season 4. The big bad doesn't excite me. Deathstroke, Ra's al Ghul - those are fucking villains. I never heard of Damien Darhk, but my knowledge is limited."

Flashbacks not good as the first 2 seasons. Roy harper gone(i hope he returns) Plots ideas good, but the delivery and execution was handled weakly to leave an impact. Wasn't well thought.

Mmmaybe better than ""Constantine"" - that's a close call.   And Ollicity gets a lot of IMO undeserved hate.  However.  Compared to season two?  Compared to Flash, which was a hard comparison to avoid since they were running side by side? Compared to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.?  In that company, it comes off really poorly.  Slapdash writing, inconsistent characterization, wasted ideas and characters, retrograde character development, pacing issues - some caused by the need to synch with Flash, but everything leading up to the midseason break felt rushed, while everything's after felt super decompressed...  And did I mention the wasted characters? They introduced way too many characters!    Some specific complaints: While I think the Ollicity haters exaggerate it, I do dislike how whiny and blubbery Felicity became in S3. But it's important to remember that despite our Masculinity Programming, emotionality is not the same as weakness (see: ""Courage Under Fire""). She is still a strong character and a good match for Oliver - even if she's a better match for Ray.  Or Barry.   I have a really hard time buying Laurel's rapid rise into martial arts mastery. However, I actually liked her character more in S3 than S1 or S2.  That goes for Thea, too.  Maybe Roy for what little we saw of him. Pretty much everyone else became less likable.  Killing Sara was pointless.  Malcolm's scheme was stupid and convoluted, and he generally seemed out of character.  Oliver's survival after The Climb was ludicrous.  Roy and Diggle were both criminally underutilized to make room for Ray.  And I like Ray, but we should learn from the mistakes of Spider-Man 3. Screen time is a finite resource."

People are in general courteous and there is a lot of thoughtful discussion (mixed with some pretty enjoyable silliness!). Furthermore, it's not as marred by ""group think"" as some other forums, like previously.tv, where 90% adhere to the same views about Laurel, Felicity, romance etc., and where discussions are mostly about members patting each other on the back for saying the ""right"" things about characters and ships. The only example of a common redditor attitude I can think of are the anti-romance sentiments, but maybe that has to do with the fact that most members are men (at least that's my impression!)  Anyway, I think this subreddit has an undeserved bad reputation (in some quarters of the fandom!) as a bastion for rude fanboys. There are definitely ""Arrow"" forums where the posters are a lot more rude, and a lot less thoughtful/intelligent in their comments. I also find that people in general are respectful of others' opinions, and seldom resort to personal attacks. That is something that should be lauded, especially since the fandom itself is already so divided."

arrow,3dlr08,ForIAmTalon,25,Fri Jul 17 08:13:15 2015 UTC,"Following his murder of Prometheus, Green Arrow sets out to kill the Electrocutioner. Green Lantern and the Flash are the first to discover the corpse he left behind, and attempt to take him in. Black Canary tries to get him to listen to reason, but he pushes her aside. Now with his own community after him, he continues his personal vendetta for revenge. Connor Hawke gets into a heated argument with him about the troubles in their past with Oliver's fatherhood and how much of a bastard he's been, not sure if he can ever forgive him again. Mia Dearden is the only one of his allies in agreement with him, and she captures the Electrocutioner with the intention of murdering him in cold blood. Realizing that he can't drag a child into this, Green Arrow begins to regret his crimes and turns himself in. Finally he's arrested by Brian Nudocerdo and publicly unmasked, revealing to the world that he's former Mayor Oliver Queen. Black Canary visits him in prison and returns her wedding ring, telling him their marriage is over. On trial, the jury finds him not guilty, but the judge overrules this and sentences him to a complete exile from Star City.  Taken directly from http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Arrow_(Oliver_Queen)"

If you have that structure to the show you lose new viewership because they are forced to keep up with the show in order to understand whats happening.

arrow,3djndo,Hawkguy67,4,Fri Jul 17 01:49:04 2015 UTC,I guess but G.o.T is an exception and its source material is formatted differently. Comic Books tend to be one shot issues that lead towards a major arch. (Which is how both Arrow and The Flash work)

arrow,3djndo,THE_Batman_121,4,Thu Jul 16 22:06:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's a formula that could work in improved slightly.  My main thought is that they should have the first half of the season using the formula you mentioned, then at the midseason finale they fully reveal the major villain for the season, then use feedback from the first half to decide which baddies of the week to give a mini-arc to where they run interference for the main villain, intentionally or otherwise."

arrow,3djndo,Ando_11,9,Fri Jul 17 04:03:08 2015 UTC,"What would be amazing is if he emerged as the season's big bad. Damien Dahrk does something to antagonize Oliver, Oliver response, Dahrk retaliates and needs to ally up to fight against team Arrow, then bites off more than he can chew. Anarky is the type to come on board with Dahrk and then dismantle his entire organization because it doesn't fit with his socio-political fanaticism. Fully unleashed on Star City, Anarky could be an unpriced threat. He'd be part Bane in that he would specifically target the economic elite and powerfully corrupt—not unlike season 1 Oliver, but he would go beyond merely killing individuals, he would dismantle the entire system.   And the best part? After season 4's dust has cleared, the audience will be left wondering if Anarky was right."
arrow,3djndo,AtomicAnarchist,6,Fri Jul 17 04:30:13 2015 UTC,"Theory time. We know Damien was in the League. Maybe he sends Anarky on some mission to Starling, but he fails and this causes the conflict between Arrow and Damien."

However, this slanderous/defamatory libel is directed against Katie Cassidy, who she ascribes all sorts of personality traits and attitudes (she is a ""mean girl""), without a shred of evidence.   This blogger is notorious in the social media ""Arrow"" fandom for her relentless campaigning against Laurel/BC/Katie Cassidy, and for her  worship of Felicity, Olicity and what she calls ""The Original Team Arrow"". Most sane oliciters are very sceptic towards her attitude and methods, and I'm pretty sure that some people working on ""Arrow""/the CW are aware of her antics. She does have a band of followers who believe anything she says, and she is considered a Big Name Fan.

That is also why I find this whole oliciter ""Original Trio"" mythology/fetish so odd! In fact, I suspect that this whole elevation of the O/F/D constellation to some ""original"", ""special"", ""true"" and ""core"" Team Arrow is partly an attempt to devalue Laurel and prove that she doesn't really belong as much as Felicity or Diggle, or that she isn't as worthy as they are. I guess that will be hard to keep up the OTA mythology now that Laurel, according to Guggenheim, will be a fully-fledged member of TA, together with Thea.   On the other hand, Guggenheim and company sometimes seem so convinced that the Olicity fandom represents the fandom/viewership at large that they actually refer to the OTA in the same way oliciters do, even in their SDCC promo talk. I think this is a bit misleading, since the ONLY ones that I ever hear harping on the OTA as something SO special that the whole show should focus on them are hardcore oliciters. Most other fans accept that things change, and that Laurel is as much part of Oliver's crime fighting team as Felicity and Diggle."

arrow,3dm5bk,amaryllisstar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:41:04 2015 UTC,I don't think Damian Darkh is a father. I got the feeling it will be Anarky.

arrow,3dm5bk,amaryllisstar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:11:14 2015 UTC,Yeah...I watched that a while back. But the way they said it made me feel like they would get into a fight or something. I really hope they change the name from the Arrow Cave to The Quiver.
