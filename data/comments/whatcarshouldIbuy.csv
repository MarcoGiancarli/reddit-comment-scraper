Insurance shouldn't be too bad other than the fact that it's a 2 door coupe. It has a fair amount of power given its weight, and decent gas mileage. They're also cheap and plentiful because of that ""girl"" car rep (undue imo, the driver makes the car), so no tears when it inevitably gets dinged and dented. It's a perfect first car really. Also, just in general, what ever car you choose, do your background research first. Common problems and complaints, sources for service manuals if that's your thing, forums.  Edit: Just checked, GT-S trim has 180 hp. For a car that weighs just 2600 pounds, that is quick. Damn now I want a celica."

Your first car isn't typically one you hang onto for too long unless someone is giving you $5,000+ to help you buy it.   I can't stress this enough, LOOK ON CRAIGSLIST NOW FOR SNOW TIRES! They'll help you so damn much."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3e6aoh,Remixmark,0,Wed Jul 22 10:52:21 2015 UTC,"Ok if you want a good winter car that will impress your friends, you've got to get a SAAB or a Volvo. I'd suggest a SAAB 9-3 Viggen (FWD) or a Volvo C30 R, V70 R, V60 R, or S60 R (AWD)      Volvos are incredible snow cars, and if you get the R Design model of the cars listed above, you will not fail to impress your friends. I know that Volvo is pretty much only known for being a mom car/family car, but the R Volvos are sportscars. If you own one, you will not be beaten in a stoplight drag race.    Now the SAAB 9-3 Viggen is also a great choice (Make sure it's a 1999 Viggen, because the 2000 and newer 9-3s were not as reliable). SAABs are also incredible snow cars, but they are only front wheel drive. Honestly the 9-3 is good for all the same reasons as the Volvos. I only have the base model '99 SAAB 9-3, and I've never lost a stoplight dragrace! It also corners exceptionally, and it has tons of grip and steering control in ice and snow. Its also an extremely safe car, safer than most newer cars even. It's not classified as anything that will raise insurance costs, but it's just as fast. Also, these cars are very very difficult to lose control of, which is always a plus!"

Its got tons of cargo space, it looks incredible (IMO), and its much quicker and faster than most cars on the road. I highly doubt you'll ever lose a street dragrace (I know I never have ;))  It's front wheel drive, but the 9-3 has almost no torque steer, and while it does understeer, it's not bad at all. Its very manageable.  They've got 225Hp, and a top speed of 155mph. The 9-3 is also one of the most aerodynamic cars on the road, so you'll make good milage for the power. I make about 30mpg.  Mine is at almost 200k miles, and the engine isn't showing any signs of fatigue, its very reliable."

German brands will demand more maintenance and parts will still be expensive, maybe even a bit more. In general, everything is more expensive with a luxury car, go figure. If you're on a budget (and at 8k, I'd say you are), doing your research is the most important thing you can do, because these old luxury cars WILL have common problems, and you WILL need to know how to identify or fix these problems, because you are on a budget, and luxury car maintenance will cost the same for old and new cars alike.   Also, at the risk of downvotes, I'm going to say maybe stay away from Audi. I hear nothing but nightmare stories about used Audis. If anybody has any experience with these, positive or negative, feel free to chime in/prove me wrong/whatever."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3e5yhl,chubbymudkip,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:10:06 2015 UTC,Want an audi or bmw? Buy new with a warranty...  If you have the money to repair it after it expires..  Keep it if not sell it/trade it in and repeat the process.   That's a pretty decent rule to go by when it comes to luxury cars.   If you're buying an older luxury car. Make sure you have pretty much double the amount of the worth of the car to spend. So the example in this case what I would do if possible. Finance 8k and have 8k in cash as a back up.   I know for a lot of people this isn't necessarily feasible but getting as close to it as possible will ensure the longest life out of the car you're getting...  Or at least long enough to get another.

The July residuals for remaining 2015 stock are sky high (65%) since the 2016 LCI refresh models will be arriving on dealer lots in Sept. Plus they have serious dealer incentives & $1000 instant rebate (buildout cash) which make the 328i priced several thousand BELOW factory invoice. Check out Edmund's TMV or KBB's Fair Purchase Pricing for examples.  You could probably snag a M-Sport Line with Navi and Premium Pkg for $41~42k if you shopped around. If you use Multi Security Deposit that translates to around $340/month + tax.

whatcarshouldIbuy,3e61d4,Dochorahan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:54:54 2015 UTC,Well the g35 and the 350 are pretty much the same car. If they are both coupes you won't find much of a difference besides the infiniti having slightly different interior.   The 350 is a tighter suspension too if I recall since it's the more sporty one and the other is the luxury sport. So when it comes to those 2 it is preference over anything.   The miata is a lot smaller..  A lot smaller! So if anything like a back seat or trunk space is important you're only option is the g35.   Also anything older than an 06 g35/350 in my opinion is not recommend. Those were the worst years for that car. Had horrible oil consumption issues among other things.

whatcarshouldIbuy,3e4sz0,h1cksta,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:25:24 2015 UTC,"The GTI is a Top Safety Pick+ car. You will not find any issues with safety there. Volvo is known for being safe, but you should actually look up the stats before saying it's safer than any particular model.  As for power, the Mk7 with an APR Stage 1 tune puts out 316hp. The Polestar tuned S60 puts out 325. The interior of the GTI has been said to match that of the luxury car segment, check one out for yourself.  So really, for me it would come down to the practicality as a daily driver, which I think the GTI easily wins with its cargo space. I also like the styling better, and the GTI wins on price by a good margin. That said, I would test drive both and see how you feel about them. Both are good cars, and if price isn't a big deal, you should choose the one that feels better to you."

As far as the interior, I love my GLI's interior. It's my opinion that the Volvo interiors are not worth the money, they look cheap and are poorly executed. Volkswagens entertainment systems are pretty user friendly and the button layouts on the dash/wheel are very intuitive.  I think the GTI has the advantage in every single category you list. The advantage the S60 has is AWD, that's about it."

If you would feel more confident with AWD you could probably get a nice 2005 ish AWD Honda CRV or  Toyota RAV4. If not a Civic like you suggested is always a good bet. For a Civic in that price range you could move up a few years and get something with a more modern entertainment system and lower mileage.  Subaru is also an option but they tend to depreciate less so you will be paying more for an older car. Their AWD systems have always been good though.

You're in Canada so there are a lot of cheap JDM imports at your disposal as well.  You can easily get a JDM WRX or STi for that sort of money and they have a TON of aftermarket support.  You can make them quite fast.  Same deal with the early Evos if you can find one that hasn't been beat on too bad (most of the I-IIIs have been by now).  Some examples:  Evo I that needs some love  1998 STi  1998 WRX  Maybe check out a Celica if you like Toyotas:    http://www.kijiji.ca/v-cars-trucks/calgary/jdm-1994-toyota-celica-gt-four-turbo/1088345561?enableSearchNavigationFlag=true  Hondas are great platforms as well.

WRX is all about performance, not living day to day. There's going to be a lot of random rattling and road noise in the WRX vs. Q50.  However, the WRX will keep its value for a very long time. It isn't unheard of for 10 year old WRXs to sell for around half of its MSRP."

Road noise is just fine which is typically attributed to tires I think you may be confusing it for the exhaust note. The exhaust note can be annoying at lower RPM's which makes a lot of drone for stock. The radio is awful, but they need to cut corners somewhere for what you're getting in the car. Interior is fine especially if OP is not accustom to Luxury vehicles, but the cheap looking carbon fiber trim is a bit much.  Other than that it's a very fun car to drive, will hold its value very well and would be a better choice over the Q50 that was a rental car."

whatcarshouldIbuy,3e4xt8,Kachi6391,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:04:39 2015 UTC,Just a suggestion if you want to keep your car.  But you can refinance your vehicle for a lower interest rate.  Maybe it can lower your payments enough depending on your current rate. Since the price of those two vehicles new are going to be way more than what you still owe on the Subie.

Tried to get some quotes, but nothing dramatic.   It sucks that I'm, more or less, tacking on another 2 years to a loan and having the pay MORE back than I already am, but I'm looking for one of these two to last me 6+ years. If all goes semi well, I'll be able to pay one of them off within 4 years.   I'll take a small hit in the long run when it comes to paying this back, but in the short run of 3 years, getting one of these will lower my insurance, payments (obviously), on top of a few other things I'm knocking off my list to save around $350~ a month while I'm at school.  I could keep paying for the BRZ, but I don't want to put myself in the position of having an issue if something pops up in a year or so."

I'm 24 now, and about a year after graduating I leased a 2015 Audi A3 (falls into the same segment as the CLA250).  I sold my old car and put half the money into the Audi up front.  I love the Audi, it's really a blast to drive and is just an overall good looking car.  That being said, every other day I regret getting rid of my old car and having to pay $400 a month on the Audi.  By no means does the payment cripple me financially, I can still save and live comfortably, but I wish I had those $400 a month back.   If I could go back and do it again, I would have kept my other car which was reasonably nice.  No 23 year old needs an Audi, BMW or Benz.  It's fun to have, but people will just assume your parents bought it for you, it's just a bit unnecessary in my opinion.  The joy is not worth $400 a month.  At the end of the day, a car is just for getting you from point A to point B.  I'd recommend a Mazda 3 or a VW Passat for something nice, but not as far on the ""luxury"" end of the spectrum."

whatcarshouldIbuy,3e36zf,SpyCake1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:15 2015 UTC,"Source: Have a 2008 Rogue S FWD with ~90k miles since new.   I would argue that newer is better, there were some running tweaks in the lifespan of the 1st gen Rogue. One such is the transmission in that 2008 SL (notice how it has a +/- manual shift gate). That particular version of the CVT was problematic (largely addressed by recalls and warranty extension, but still) and I believe in 2010+ the SLs started getting the same (manual shift gate-less) transmissions as the S got from the very start.   At least the updated Bose sound system is nice. The base radio sounds like a potato.   That said, having the base model with no features - I can't tell you that I miss anything. My other car has keyless go and fancy radio and sunroof and all that other jazz and it's nice and all, but I really don't miss that stuff in the Rogue (but heated seats would be nice - Chicago winters be cold).   My top 2 dislikes of the car in general -- It takes forever to defrost. If it is sitting outside on some of the colder nights, it could take 20 minutes to get comfortable (and being able to see shit out the windows). It's just cavernous and there are only so many blowers to fill it with warm air. If you have a shorter drive, you're almost tempted to just go cold.  AND -- the rear seat is absolutely shit for kids. The bench is comfortable enough but the window sills are TALL - meaning the kid can't see shit out the window (had a 9 year old back there who couldn't see shit) and that results in many ""are we there yet""s , and there is no noise insulation back there (ie - rear wheel wells). At city speeds its not awful, but on the highway it's impossible to have a conversation with someone sitting in the back when you are sitting in the front. The front row is significantly quieter and it's possible for the 2 people up front to chat without yelling.  AMA."

I was taught from an early age that if you aren't satisfied with the product, it's not a bargain at any price. I will ALWAYS spend more to get exactly what I want than to settle for something that isn't. If I can't afford it, then I delay until I can.  You need to decide what is most important to you in regards to a car, then decide on which ones will satisfy you most. Then define your pricing strategy, do the research, drive them, and make your purchase.  You'll be driving this vehicle every day and paying money each month for it. At the VERY least you should love driving it.  Lastly, the economics of the purchase are only one part of the equation, but it is the most important part. Don't buy a car that doesn't fit your finances no matter how much you want it."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3e2e5s,hobbestigertx,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:07 2015 UTC,"I own a speed3, and I'm mildly suspicious of the less expensive one. It could either be a great buy, or an awful one, depending on what they did under the hood. Not knowing what's been done under the hood would worry me, it could be nothing and you'll just have a loud, plastidipped MS3, or they could have cranked the boost and the high pressure fuel pump is on the verge of failing and destroying the engine. Did you look under the hood at all? Did it look like the stock engine bay like the second speed3 you posted? The second speed3 looks pretty much stock, I have no real concerns there.  edit: also remember the wear items are going to be more expensive for the speed3, tires and brakes are higher performance and cost more then the economy cars, and the speed3 is only really good in the snow with a dedicated set of winters on it since the tires are fairly wide for such a light car (I live in New Hampshire and I run a dedicated set of summer and winter tires.) You could probably survive on a set of good all-seasons, but IMO all-season = no-seasons. If you stretch your budget too far these items may become a problem.  The former owner looks like they slapped on some cheap tires after buying a set of 2013 MS3 wheels (only year that came with the black wheels), never a good sign, because if they cheap out on tires, what else did they buy that was ""just good enough"" unless I'm wrong about Sailun tires. I've never heard of the brand though, and this is a performance vehicle and tires are extremely important. I personally run a set of Bridgestone Potenza S-04 pole positions in the summer and Continental Extremewintercontacts in the winter."

Under the hood looked stock, although it was my first time looking under the hood of one. I didn't notice anything other than the oil cap (which I now know is stock), not even an intake. The only modifications I saw were Eibach springs, Ultimate (catback?) exhaust, Rally Armor mudflaps, and Plastidipped hood scoop, wheels, mirrors, and brake calipers (presumably to clean up the surface rust).  The tires are indeed Sailun but are winter tires, the dealer would be replacing the tires before sale and agreed to get the factory equivalent. I'd also buy a better dedicated set of winters, though I may give these tires a try. But thanks for the advice concerning wear items.  I'm starting to think that this Speed3 would be a better option since it's a Mazda CPO vehicle with a 7 year/140,000km powertrain warranty, but I'll have to check it out first since there's no pictures."

The Honda Fit is the top sub compact car out there, great cargo.  I have heard the console is very low so it lacks an arm rest.  The paint on the white ones maybe others is very cheap.  I have heard the seats are uncomfortable but everything else is very positive.  They hold their value so it makes more sense to buy a new Fit than a used, just look at the price of that used one, 3 years old and only $3K less than the new.  Fit was my top choice for what I need a couple months ago, but it's just too tiny on the outside and the opposite of masculine.

whatcarshouldIbuy,3e0ynh,eccitaze,2,Tue Jul 21 23:56:46 2015 UTC,"Seconding the suggestion for a civic/corolla.  A few tips:   Buy Japanese. Trust me. At that budget, you're looking at late 90s/early 2000s models. That happens to coincide with the start of the period where 90% of American cars sucked hardcore, and time won't do them any favors. European is an option, but they tend to be more expensive/luxury cars. That means the models in your budget will be either older and/or in worse condition than other options. They're also super expensive to repair, too. Japanese models are cheap, reliable as fuck, and cheap/easy to repair. Hell, the late 90s Corolla has a knowledge base for repairs and maintenance matched only by Jeep. That's saying something. Set aside a few hundred from your budget to have a (reputable!) mechanic do an inspection of your car before buying. Spending a few hundred now can potentially save you hundreds of thousands in hospital and repair bills later by reducing the chance that your car will run into major issues shortly after buying it, and ensuring you don't buy a death trap running on a frame held together with chicken wire. Be prepared to walk away. Over and over again. You might get lucky and find a dream car immediately. You might blow through half your budget on inspections alone. If that happens, tough. Save back up and try again. Otherwise you'll end up cursing yourself when your budget gets torn to shreds because the alternator blew one month and the next month a spark plug fell out of the engine (taking the cylinder threading with it)."

It's going to cost a little more than a similar year Corolla, but it's got a quieter ride, it's a hatch so there's more room if you ever move anything big, and it averages 50mpg.  2011-2013 could be in your budget depending on miles and features."

If you want to go a little bit bigger, the Accord, Camry, 6 and Legacy are the mid-size sedans. You'll get similar reliability, a little worse gas mileage but more passenger and cargo space."

Those are just technicalities though.  Either way, the emblem should say ""G37S"" or ""G37xS"".  There's really no other appearance differences besides the 18"" wheels.    Another thing to check is the seat.  The sport model has a bolster adjuster on the front edge of the seat bottom (under your thigh/knee area).  It basically looks like the seat bottom has an extension to it and it's very obvious.  That's only available as part of the sport package.    If you like the Q50 better, then go for it.  It's just not as crisp and impressive performance wise as the previous model.  Do not buy it if it has the Direct Adaptive Steering.  It's terrible.

Wheel bearing install was 250. Tires we're 350 (cheapo tires, but new)  the bearing could have waited, but I didn't want other things to go with it.  The acura legend puffed blue smoke.[sold that car quickly after I bought it for a few hundred extra] I'm assuming head gasket. My Sundance smoked a bit, just needed new gasket seals.   Brakes, suspension stuff like bearings or shocks possibly. An oil leak may be likely, but tossing in a 4 dollar quart every 2-4 weeks isn't that horrible. My ac doesn't work. I've had cars that driver window didn't work. I dumped 700 into my car over owning it, and I'm sure I can drive it for another year or three. Really not too bad for 230k miles. Like I said, put away 500. You may need it in 6 months, a year, or you may sell the car for around the same price you bought it for before you ever put that money into it.  But first things first- get an oil change if it hasn't been done. Always keep up on that, no matter how much of a pos it is. And ask for maintenance receipts, hopefully they'll have some."

I'd really be looking at a Camaro vs GT instead of a Challenger. It's still a slouch in the corners compared to the two and this is especially true when the 1LE Camaro can be had for under 36k (listed between 37-40 for 1SS 1LE on the net) with Recaro's in it compared to both the Mustang and Challenger top models that is a good deal.  I'm in the same boat looking at V8 coupes, but honestly the 1LE looks more and more appealing if you want something that handles well for a V8 big body coupe with bang for the buck. I've looked at pricing a lot and with negotiation you can get one for sub 36k if you know what you're doing. I do really like the Mustangs new styling and it performs really well, but if you're looking at making a purchase soon at least try out the 1LE Camaro."

Of course, so is wanting a luxury badge and not wanting to pay extra for maintenance, but you know that already as well :-)  The Outback sounds like the right car - maybe consider that backup cameras make parking larger cars in cities a lot easier than it used to be. But you do have other options.  If you like the Outback but think it is too long, the obvious pick is the Subaru Forester - you could get a Forester XT if you wanted a little extra oomph to it.  I'd perhaps consider the Ford Edge - the new ones supposedly have surprisingly good power and driving dynamics.  Also, while I personally don't like them all that much, and the company in general doesn't have a great reputation at the moment, you could potentially consider the Jeep Grand Cheroke. It's probably the highest-quality Jeep overall right now, even though that's kind of faint praise. The new interiors are very nice.

Winter tires on FWD > AWD > FWD with all seasons. For maximum success, I'd suggest a Subaru with winter tires. Have her ask a local tire store what it would cost to buy and then what the charge is to swap them out twice a year. It's not much in the grand scheme and totally worth it. Anyway, far cheaper than a new car.  But Subarus are awesome for what it's worth, their AWD system is vastly superior to other manufacturers for winter road driving."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dvrtm,Mykrroft,3,Mon Jul 20 02:26:34 2015 UTC,Honestly the price differential on an outback or a crosstrek is not much. Have her test drive the whole subaru line. Most of them build out to 23-25k.

whatcarshouldIbuy,3dvrtm,SuitedUpLikeTen,2,Mon Jul 20 03:35:40 2015 UTC,"You're right, snow tires on any drive train are better than all seasons on any drive train. I think the easiest way to explain it is that the tires are primarily responsible for how well you start, stop and turn. The only thing awd helps with of those three is starting, since you have a little more help from the rear (or front) than you would in a non-awd. But the most important thing in bad conditions is stopping and steering. For that, the only thing that'll help is better tires.  If she likes her car, get her a set of wheels and Blizzaks (or another highly rated snow tire). It'll be a world of difference and cost far, far less than a new car.  If she wants a new car anyway, still get it a set of wheels and snow tires. Don't make awd a priority, she can get virtually any car she wants and it'll be better w/ the snow tires than any other car on all seasons. If she happens to end up loving a car that is awd, fine. If not, it'll almost certainly be fwd and great. I'd take rwd w/ snow tires, but it'd probably be better to avoid it (so few cars are rwd, you'd have to go out of your way to pick one)."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dvrtm,fryfrog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:49:09 2015 UTC,I have lived in New England all my life and would never drive in snow without snow tires.    I would choose a FWD car over snow tires before an AWD car with all seasons.  The simplest way to think about it is how safe to you feel when you are descending a steep hill in the snow?  The only thing that matters in this case is the tires.  AWD is only really needed if you drive up steep snowy hill frequently.

Honestly, I'm pretty surprised that Alaska is a bunch of all seasons and all wheel drive. I'd have thought a place with so much snow would jump right on snow tires, but I guess maybe they don't wear well in the summer? And really, nobody wants to swap a set of wheels? Sheesh."

A normal Impreza (especially with good tires) will work perfectly fine for you. You'll save yourself a nice chunk of cash and a lot of anguish over the ride quality.  People that buy WRXs buy them because they are WRXs - for the handling, harsh ride/firm suspension, and performance.

B) diesel repairs are astronomically more expensive and less avalible.   With that said most all small pickups are good for what you want to do. However, if you are over 5 feet tall consider a full size pickup. The bench seat will sleep better as well as the bed of the truck. You should be able to sell whatever you buy at little or no loss assuming you do not overspend. Recommend you buy based upon personal comfort. Fuel milage between small and large pickups is not much difference over 5k miles.   Sounds like a great trip, hope it goes well."

Trying to sleep, even in the bed, of a small pickup would be difficult for me(I am 6'0""), but I wonder then if I do go for a full size, should I consider diesel.    I ask because they are generally more reliable and I have heard that they get better fuel economy.  Over a drive like this the cost may even out with the difference in price at the pump.  Also if it is more reliable it may be better than gas even with higher cost of maintenance if I will run into less problems on the road.  Also, I guess I have never had to look, but are diesel mechanics that much rarer?    Does any of that hold water?  I ask only to be sure, not to question your knowledge.  Thank you very much."

But the Fusion/Malibu are  bigger cars and I would argue better all around with the exception of possibly reliability and mpg.  They're both rated above average for reliability though so it's hardly like you're buying a trash heap either way.    Fusion/Malibu directly competes with the Accords/Camrys which have been the class leaders for years, but are also significantly more expensive.  As used cars, if they've been cared for I wouldn't have any problems with a Fusion/Malibu.  I've had them in my biz fleet and they held up very well for the 150k miles service life I run."

Trucks have advanced dramatically in the last few years, and you could go get a gas pickup like the Tundra that's Torque-y, luxurious, and tows like an old diesel. Bottom line the diesels set the bar for towing. If you've got plans to haul get the diesel!   If you just want a pick up to have for general purpose use I really like the F-150 option over the Dodge. They've gotten so damn good looking, more efficient, the interiors at baseline are better, and the starting price will be a lot lower obviously.   I used to be all about used, but nowadays people aren't as nice to their vehicles. The money you're not paying really is life lost on the truck.

You still have all of the compact cars, like the Corolla, Civic, Forte, Elantra, Sentra, etc, but for 25k, you can get a good midsize car with some options.  I have a 2014 Kia optima that I got new for 25k almost fully loaded. MSRP was 31k. I like it a lot, but it's boring to drive. If you don't care about that, the Kia/Hyundai (they're sister companies) will have a LOT of features for the price.   If you want better driving dynamics, get the Accord, Mazda, or VW.

Rear wheel drive, pretty inexpensive, one of the best modifying platforms in the world, but finding a good one can take some searching/luck. Try to get one with a manual transmission, but if you can only find an automatic they're one of the easier cars to convert.   Years sold in the US are 1989-1999. You probably want a 91, 92, or 93, as they're cheaper than the later years but have a slightly better engine (Ka24de vs Ka24e, about 15 horsepower difference). Engine swaps are very popular, but I'd advise against buying a car that's already had the engine swapped. Try to buy one as stock as possible. Don't buy one with a turbo. You never know if they did the work correctly or if the car will be reliable. Stock they are decently reliable for a 25 year old car.  The first generation, known as the s13, produced from 1989-1994, is a whole lot cheaper than the newer ones, and I think they look a bit better personally. S13's come in two bodystyles, hatchback, and coupe. The fronts look the same, with different fronts on different years. Earlier 240sx's have the pignose front, while the later cars have the chuki front. The engine in the cars in the US market is the ka24, with the ka24e pre 91, and the ka24de post 91. Post 91 has dual over head cams and a little more power. The engine in the car in the a lot of the rest of the world is the sr20det, which came stock with a turbo and a lot more power, but a little less torque.   Most of the 240sx's come with an open differential. Manual sunroof, electric sunroof, or no sunroof are all options. Some have power windows, powered mirrors, cruise control etc. If you can, try to get one without the stock spoiler on the hatch because they absorb water and rust out the top of the hatch. Check the whole car for rust before you buy it.   The biggest thing people do with 240sx's is drift them, like so: https://youtu.be/oh_HtCzHUgg?t=163"

The dealer asked if I wanted to test drive it, but I told them that I couldn't.   They ended up taking me out in a regular Mazda 3 so that I could learn. Then they let me practice on my own for a while.   When I came back they gave me the key to the Speed3 and told me to bring it back in the morning.   The first few weeks were a challenge.

I made a lot of memories in mine handbrake drifting like I was Paul Walker through my neighborhood.  My Altezza ownership was a mixed bag but overall somewhat disappointing. I'd loved the design of that car my whole life and the ownership experience didn't quite meet my expectations. The interior fell apart easily and the body was poorly made and hard to keep clean consistently.  Also look into the Civic Si, or whatever is available there. They're manual tranny only but they are good cars for the money and would be worth learning to drive manual because Honda makes some of the best row your own transmissions out there."

Reliability should be similar, both cars have the same VQ37VHR which is generally regarded as a very reliable engine.   The 370Z will definitely feel and drive more sporty due to its smaller size and tighter suspension tuning. It's a 2 seater that can have decent interior, albeit a bit dated looking, if you up the trim level. Long term maintenance will be cheaper.   I went with a 2011 Infiniti G37 Coupe with the Premium and Navigation package myself. I preferred the classic sports coupe styling and nicer interior for my fairly lengthy work commute.

The statement you made about the price and having the money to maintain it is 100% true. That being said, they aren't Lexuses (Lexii?) and won't be bulletproof. But I guess that's the price you have to pay for better performance/driving dynamics.  -If you end up in a CPO BMW or Audi, BMW includes maintenance for free up to 4yr/50k. For Audi, it's like $900 up front and it covers services for the first 4 years. You basically have to worry about tires, that's it.

If you are talking about being able to plow through a foot of snow, the only way you are going to be doing this is with a truck, probably with sandbags in the rear.  Otherwise, keep in mind that even with AWD, you still need winter tires. An AWD with winter tires is going to be able to do better in hilly terrain than 2wd with winter tires, however on flat ground, the only difference is how long does it take you to get going.   Within your price-range, the only real option is the WRX. You can opt for an AWD suv like CX-3 that is not going to be fun to drive, or a FWD fun car.

I've also heard good things about Mazda CX5s. The Nissan Juke or Rogue could also be worth looking at. Whatever you do, don't get a CRV. The AWD on that car is awful, and by that I mean, it doesn't work.   You could get the Dodge Charger in AWD with I think 300 hp, but I'd only recommend that if you really enjoy terrible build quality. On that note, avoid the Chrysler 200, the transmission in that will make you want to shoot yourself.   If you don't want a crossover, you could try out a Subaru Legacy. They have a bit of pep to them. There is also the Ford Fusion and Taurus, both of which I've heard good things about.   There's also the Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart, and you may be able to get a good price for the fact that you're actually considering a Mitsubishi. The salesman may be amazed you're there. Mitsubishi touts them as a ""sports sedan"" but I really have no idea. From their website, the Ralliarts get 237 hp and 253 lb-ft of torque (which is really quite a lot actually), a Dual Clutch transmission, and beefier suspension. And all of the Ralliarts I'm seeing on Autotrader right now are listed for $26,000, which is about 5 grand under MSRP.   Dude, I never thought I'd say this...but you should look at the Lancer Ralliart. It looks like it is the WRX equivalent of the Evo. It's the sportiest non-WRX car you're going to find, and it isn't an Impreza.  Speaking of, the WRX is no longer an Impreza according to Subaru, even if it's based on the Impreza.

I look forward to being able to get a CPO one of those in a few years.    But you have an S7? Excellent choice. Every time I see one of those, I feel that little fizz that James May talks about."

VW did a nice job on that car. A3 would be a fantastic upgrade to that.  -In a few years, a CPO S3 will be a bargain too. I love that little rocketship, especially in that gorgeous Sepang Blue!  -Yeah, it's a head turner. Love the car. Audi is killing it when it comes to interior/exterior design these days"
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dnjlf,chickentikka69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:14:37 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about bumping up to A4 because Audi is giving out a bunch of incentives for new owners and leases this summer, which makes the prices (not include tax and etc) a lot better.   I heard BMW and Audi both offer some sort of limited maintainece plan for a number of miles for new cars. Is it even beneficial?   And your right about the Jaguar, but its so damn beautiful."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dnjlf,chickentikka69,3,Fri Jul 17 19:20:30 2015 UTC,"-Yeah, this is a great time to get a new 3 series or A4. Model year change is happening, so good deals are to be had. The 2016 3 series is getting a facelift and the 2016 A4 is all new, so the 2015s on the ground will be sold for great prices!  -BMW builds the maintenance plan (4yr/50k) into the price of the car and it's fantastic. One of the best things about owning a BMW. I didn't worry about anything for 4 years on my BMW. It covered everything, but tires.   -Audi doesn't include it. AudiCare is an optional extra (http://www.audiusa.com/myaudi/service). It's $829 and includes services for the first 4 years.   -The BMW plan is more comprehensive. They cover bulbs, brakes, wipers, all fluids, etc. Audi is just services. If you price out the services separately, you end up saving a ton."

During this same time frame, the VW also fared better than industry average, and I can only speak from anecdotal evidence on the Saturn (our family had one with high miles.)

From the late 90's (99) to mid/late-2000's Hyundai reliability (in comparison to others) was at it's highest (for reference, in 2000, they started offering the 10year/100K warranty). The 2001-2008 Elantra was considered to be a reliable car and won several best used car awards. The Sonata and Accent had pretty good reliability rankings as well. These are cars in their price range. This recomendation changes if you're dealing with an old Hyundai (pre-98 Mitsubishi drive trains.)   Hyundai now ranks among best 2002 brands for reliability. In CR’s latest survey, Hyundai tied Honda for second-place in reliability ratings for 2002s behind Toyota.  In terms of the Jetta, I wouldn't pick it over the Elantra.

The Ford, well the PowerShift doubleclutch auto is a mess tbh, compared to VW's DSG, it is slow and tries so hard to mimic a normal auto, that it fails spectacularly. Such a pity, cause the 2.0 Ti-VCT engine in the Ford is really good tbh, and the Focus still has one of the best chassis around... Unless you don't mind the manual, you may want to avoid the Ford. Agree the Ford doesn't feel as nice inside as the Mazda too.  As for Mazda versus the VW, tough one, but the Mazda has more value I feel. The Mazda i Touring comes around the 20000 mark, while the VW, to get similar equipment, you would need to at least get the S E instead. Unless you can get the VW Golf SE for about 20000 as well, I would side the Mazda. The Golf is really good to drive, just like the Mazda, and it is the only turbo hatch among the 3. The 1.8T is a strong engine, and has a pretty decent interior and it's overall really good. But the VW may be a bit more expensive to run in the long term (i.e. servicing costs).  Honda CR-Z worth going only for the manual. A CVT 'sporty' hybrid doesn't quite cut it for me."

And do you know how much they both hold their value?"
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dle5k,_sudonano,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:58:52 2015 UTC,"It's a fair bit of difference, here in Australia I can roughly give you an idea of what we would pay...  So, let's say the Golf would be the 1.4TSI with the DSG double clutch (only non GTI Golf we get here), and the Mazda 3, the 2.0.  For the Golf, every 15000 kms (~9000) miles, you would have the oil change done and that is about AUD 330 for just oil, with the filter and labour at the dealer. The 60000km (~40000 mile) major service is more expensive at AUD562 cause that has more stuff (including brake and some other fluids and other inspections (see here: http://volkswagenaustralia.com.au/CappedPriceServicing/pdf/VW0258-2015.pdf). Our costs are the same throughout every dealer since the parent company sets the service costs. For the Civic, services are done every 10000kms (~6000 miles) and each cost about AUD 294 or AUD321, alternating, and even at the most expensive service, it isn't as much as the Golf I think. (See here: http://www.mazda.com.au/cars/mazda3-hatch/servicing/ , look at the Neo spec pricing as that is the 2.0)  As for the CR-Z Manual, it costs about the same as the Mazda 3 as well, save for a few dollars +/- (see http://www.honda.com.au/why-honda/servicing.html) . The hybrid system doesn't actually need any maintenance, more of inspection only and eventually replacing the hybrid battery once it wears out, but that would take a long, LONG time.  I would say the Mazda 3 is a more financially sound buy, or even the CR-Z over the Golf on maintenance costs, as VWs aren't as cheap as Hondas or Mazdas to service in the long run. Sure you save on less dealer visits, but when things do go wrong (should they), they can be more expensive than the Japanese rivals.   But if you don't mind the extra service cost, the Golf can be a good buy still, as it is solid and a really great car to drive, an has that German feel to it. Plus, the 1.8TSI is a pretty good engine, good power and torque."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dle5k,_sudonano,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:45:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the long response! I might  do my own oil changes (assuming it won't void the warranty), so I don't have much concern there. However, maintenance costs for repairs is what I'm worried about. Originally I wasn't thinking of going for the Golf for this reason. Unless I'm really blown away by the quality of the car and the deal from the dealership, it's looking like the Mazda or the CRZ is the way to go. I didn't get a chance to test the CRZ, so hopefully I can get out today or tomorrow. I'd have learn the quirks of driving a manual if I go for the manual over the CVT (which a lot of people recommend), but it's always an option."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dle5k,_sudonano,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"No worries!  The Golf which you guys get in the US should be pretty solid though, I mean the Golf 6 with the 1.4 TSI Twincharged engine plus the dry double clutch automatic was the mess of VW, while the US ones come with the 1.8TSI (as per the Passat I believe?) and the (Aisin based -IIRC) 6 speed normal automatic - also should be pretty bullet proof.  If at all, the only cause of concern could be the turbo in the engine causing trouble to it, but there hasn't been much drama in the 1.8TSI compared to the 1.4 TSI Twincharger in the Golf 6.  Was looking at trying to find out VW's warranty and found this gem: http://www.vwserviceandparts.com/volkswagen-maintenance-plans/?utm_source=VW_Service_and_Parts&utm_medium=VW_Care_HomepageRotator&utm_campaign=CareProgram2015  Looks like for about $700, you can get 5 years of full maintenance taken care of. If I were you I'd talk to the dealer to see if they could throw it in. Insist on the VW Care (for 3 year cover) /CarePlus (for 5 year cover) and not a dealership plan, cause in the event should you need to change dealerships for service, under VW Care/CarePlus you can go to any VW dealer that is participating. And it is an agreement with VW of America itself. Mazda has a similar thing too, but no pricing here unfortunately http://mazdausa.com/MusaWeb/musa2/pdf/brochures/Mazda-PrePaid-Maintenance-Desk-Blotter.pdf  Though tbh, for the Mazda, maintenance shouldn't be as expensive as the Golf I think, though for added peace of mind, you could ask the dealer to give a breakdown of servicing costs to help your decision.  I believe Honda, Mazda and VW offer the same cover, 3 year 36000 mile bumper to bumper, and a 5 year powertrain warranty.   In the end it depends, the Mazda would be definitely more practical than the CRZ, but the CRZ has a bit of an interesting feel to it."

The Focus, between the SE and Titanium, I think you get larger wheels, push button start, the manual controls for the transmission, leather and heated seats, as well as Sync2 with MyFordTouch, and Sony Premium Audio. All of which isn't available on the SE. On that basis while the Focus has standard alloys and backup camera, there is a bigger jump from SE to Titanium compared to the Mazda's i Sport to i Touring.  If it was me, and it was between the Mazda and Ford only, I would do the Mazda3 in i Touring. Just better value, and don't forget this generation of Mazda 3 is still new compared to the Focus which has been here since about 2011. (though recently refreshed)"

Overall the 328i is a good car, I would say the pick of the range. Make sure it has the navigation, xenon headlights and keyless entry and start, as well as the sport automatic. Having heads up display and adaptive suspension would really make it perfect.  Powertrain wise, it should be solid, the only issue being you have to be careful when driving in pools of water, always make sure the water is  below the bottom most level of the bumper in front, and the car is driven through the water at a slow speed (approx 5mph). The thing is the air intake for a BMW is on the left side of the car (when looking at the front of the car directly), at the side of the foglight. Just a bit of water getting in can get you into serious trouble, and potentially looking at a lovely bill for a new engine or an engine rebuild. If you are worried I would recommend adding flood cover to your motor insurance, if you do drive in areas prone for heavy rain that could lead to pools of water accumulating on the roads. Had it once, bad experience.  BMW Ultimate Service should still apply I think, since that would be for 4 years from date of first registration. So that should take care of the service bills for at least up to a year +. You could then decide to add on added cover etc, but that I don't think is necessary at time of purchase and you probably won't need it. Just make sure that it is OK for adding on additional cover in the future, before you buy.  Good luck!"

whatcarshouldIbuy,3dkx73,LeninLinen,6,Fri Jul 17 02:39:10 2015 UTC,"Stop.  If this is a 96 300 twin TURBO w/ 65k, you are sitting on a GOLD mine.  If its well taken care of, scoop it up for 6.5 & never look back.  If its NOT a TT, 6.5 is a bit high even for one w/ such low mileage.  That said, in regard to the broader question, ""Used Jap vs New Car"" the answer is almost irrevocably, ""Used Japanese Car.""  ESPECIALLY if you can get a good example of what will ultimately become a highly sought-after classic, like the ones you mentioned in your post.  300ZX TTs, Supras, RX-7s, etc.  Let me explain why:  1)  New cars take a ~20% hit in depreciation the minute you purchase them.  We've all heard that statistic, but it gets worse.  They continue to decline sharpest in their early years for the life of your ownership and don't really bottom out in value to >10yrs.  When we talk about cost of ownership, all that has to be taken into consideration.  For example, if you buy a new car for $20k today, and by this time next year its worth $16k (20% less), you lost $4k on that car.  Add to that your monthly car payment at $300/mo, car insurance, gas, maintenance, and other expenses and you pay the HEAVIEST price for car ownership the newer you buy.  If you buy American or European, its even worse.  2)  Now flip it around.  Lets say you buy a fully depreciated Japanese classic, like a TT 300ZX.  Lets say its an absolute piece of SHIT.  (300's are notoriously hard to work on mind you.)  You would have to spend more than $633/mo on maintaining/ returning that car to its former glory to cost more than the new car you would've bought.  ($4k depreciation / 12mos + $300/mo car payment; not including other expenses.)  On top of that, no ones gonna take your car away if you miss a car payment.  You don't have to pay for full collision insurance.  Licensing & tags are usually cheaper.  You have the pride of owning something unique and restoring a piece of history.  Youre not contributing to our landfills and disposable society.  Every repair you make on the car, you have an opportunity to add your custom flair to it or upgrade it if you choose.  Plus Japanese cars are the best for reliability and resale value, and as you fix it up, it actually GROWS in value.  Not at the rate you sink money into it but better than a new car will.  Now, be warned.  Restoring old cars is most expensive when you first get the car.  Youll be discovering all the reasons the last owner SOLD it, so be committed to paying the costs to get it where you need to be.  Focus on driveability/ safety issues first, then work on comfort and cosmetic issues.  Once you've restored all the driveability issues, youll have a reliable daily driver that gets you back and forth to work so you can make the money to fix it up as you go along.  I currently own a 90 Accord, 97 Del Sol, 03 Element and 06 600RR.  They are all great cars. Bonus link to my favorite 300."

Something to consider with older cars, specially as complex as the TT 300zx is that you're not only going to spend money getting the car up to par, but also time and for some people that's a big inconvenience, especially if this car is your only way of transportation.  Mind you, there might be better compromises for used japanese cars (maybe not as cool) where the money and time spent getting the car in great shape could be a better bargain.  All that aside. I lust a mid 90's RX7. If I had the money and time I'd totally get one and do an LS swap on it. One day I will I guess.  BTW, is that your 300? that looks absolutely fantastic!"

whatcarshouldIbuy,3dkjiv,BeatmyWheat,3,Fri Jul 17 00:38:25 2015 UTC,"Here would be my primary problem with the Hyundai: Its a generation behind, and lacks many of the upgrades that the standard Sonata has built in from the start. The 2016 Sonata Hybrid finally meets up with the current car, and expands further on what made the previous Hybrid so great, it'd almost be better to wait... Unless the incentives are so great on the current model that it is hard to ignore.  But, where the Legacy gets the vote the between the two is on safety and performance. Assuming you're in an area where things get slushy, the all-wheel-drive comes in handy, and things like Eye-Sight are a good way to keep you and the family safe on the road. Although I wouldn't consider it a particularly engaging car (a shade of its former self), it isn't nearly as beige as the Camry or Passat, and that's certainly a step in the right direction.  If it were the Internet's choice, its a fair bet that they'd settle on the Mazda 6. Gorgeous exterior and interior, sublime dynamics - its the enthusiast choice of the bunch. But, it falls short on value, and outright performance, but most things are commendable. It largely depends on where you want to put your chips.  I'm personally a fan of the Chrysler 200, at least in terms of style and value, depending on how much you're willing to stomach. Chrysler is happy to slash that price like crazy because they aren't selling as well as they'd like, but you've got to worry about a depreciation rate that's pretty high, and that pesky 9-speed automatic that the jury is still out on. But, in terms of quality and style, I'd put it pretty far toward the front of the pack.  Kinda on the same end, the Chevrolet Malibu sits in a weird spot, too. The car is stupid-simple, no frills to make it a class leader in any one respect, but they seem to be quite reliable, and with plenty of deals on the table, it can be a good value. But, with the 2016 model on the way, I'd say its better to wait if that's what you want.  The Honda Accord Sport is an example of nothing more than you'd need and nothing more than you'd want. Cheap, efficient, reasonably fun to drive, decently styled, rock solid reliability and value. Many of the same accolades can be laid at the feet of the Ford Fusion, but, the Honda gets the advantage of being a bit more ahead of the curve on design - but not by much. Again, it depends on what you're looking for.  Out of the two you've brought up, specifically, I'd side with the Subaru. If it were the standard Sonata (ie, 2015 Sport or Limited), I may be tempted to swing it, but, there are a few upgrades that are worth waiting for with the 2016 models that'd make me hesitate (Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration). Outside of that, I'd probably go with the Mazda 6, but I'd be looking for something a bit more sporty and emotional. As basic transportation? The deals on the Chrysler 200 may be worth it - check your dealer and see what they're offering on a 200 Limited or 200C."

They get snowy early and stay that way for a while (early April it was horrible this year). If you do this a lot, especially outside the summer months, you'll want either an AWD or dependable FWD. RWD is practically not an option unless you really trust the car. What region? West Washington, West Oregon, East WA, East OR? Weather you'll regularly encounter is important to consider as traveling a couple hours in any direction often will drastically change the weather.   Other than that, that's all I can think of.

Yadda yadda yadda, every naming/numbering scheme is garbage these days.  The Infiniti Q60 is literally the same thing you already have. If you want more of the same, sure, go for it. If you want the updated bits and bobs, you'd need to hop over to the Q50 sedan.  The Merc C-Class Coupe has the advantage of having a newer chassis and powertrain options, but on the whole, the model leans more toward the luxury end of the segment compared to the 4-series, which even in itself is more luxurious than where it once was.  The Cadillac ATS Coupe has received plenty of accolades for a great chassis and interior, but the jury is out on the V6 (its the same corporate 3.6L that goes in everything), and even moreso on the 2.0T, who's performance seems to vary wildly depending on its application. In terms of outright opulence, no, it won't match the C-Class, but, it will go toe-to-toe with the 4-series. Its not a bad option, and with them selling a bit more slowly than what GM would like, incentives to buy/lease are going to be stacked pretty high come August.  If you want outright power in a sports coupe, well, you're going to have to go American. Maximum output is going to come from the Mustang GT or the Camaro SS, the Challenger SRT also being a great option, but it being more of a GT-style coupe than a performance car. With 450+ BHP available, honestly for dirt cheap, they're not a bad way to go. With the Alpha-based Camaro on the way for 2016, it'd be easy to get a deal on a current SS or 1LE, but I'd be kicking myself if I didn't wait. The new Mustang GT is still selling like hotcakes, so, be aware of local markups (up here in Michigan, it isn't a problem anymore). The Challenger is a weird odds-on favorite for me, at the moment. Although it isn't nearly as sporty as the Camaro and Mustang, as a luxury performance coupe with a big-ass V8, enough space for passengers, and all their junk in the trunk... It actually makes sense as a reasonable purchase. A 2015 Challenger R/T with the Scat Pack (ie, all the go-fast bits from the SRT 392, without being an SRT luxury product) will fall well beneath your price cap, and will far exceed your power requirements.  Otherwise, well, there just aren't many performance coupes out there these days."

whatcarshouldIbuy,3dl0b2,berzi123,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:32:47 2015 UTC,Out of your choices a 335i is going to be your best one. A little negotiating should get you a base model at 450/month with some money down unfortunately.  Q60 is a glorified 370Z and the 3 Series would be a lot more fun or if you really want one just look at a decently equipped 370Z for a lot cheaper.  C Class Coupe has nothing on the 335i and neither does the IS350 for power and handling. Not to mention a simple tune for a couple hundred bucks on the 335i will get you a lot more fun thanks to the turbos.  Completely forgot that the 3 series is no longer offered in a coupe format. An M235 can be had for a little more though

whatcarshouldIbuy,3dkyyh,zzzzbear,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:39:29 2015 UTC,"at that price point a used M3 will be a 2011 with ~50k miles, if maintenance and running costs aren't an issue for you then it's a fantastic car. A more value conscious buy would be a used 2015 mustang GT with less than 10k miles for ~$35k, or possibly an older Boss 302 mustang. The M3 and mustang GT are very very close performance wise, weight and power are very even.   The new Jaguar XE-S might be worth a look, it's stretching the budget a bit at ~$45k but it looks to be a fantastic car. Last suggestion would be a used 335i M sport package, it still has great power and handling, but at that price point you can get a much newer and lower mile car than an M3."

As a result, I never really gave the RS5 a good look, until now.  I somewhat like the design of it and it has specs similar to the other cars I was looking at, but I kind of prefer RWD to AWD in terms of feel and, according to Car and Driver, their maintenance plan only covers 1 year/5,000 miles. BMW beats them with 4 year/50,000 miles, Jaguar with 5 years/60,000 miles, and so on.  Thanks for the input, though!"

A generously equipped one will run you right around 75k, which is about where you are looking. It has two trunks, and you sacrifice the rear seats, but you get a MUCH purer driving experience. It is fast, and will be a grand handling machine.   That said, of the four, I would go with an M4. Yes, it is a turbo  (blasphemy!), but it really does drive great. Add executive package and full leather and that's all you need. Free maintenance for 4/50k as well."

It's funny that you mention the Cayman S because my father just got himself a pre-owned 2013 Porsche 911 Carrera back on Fathers Day and he has been pretty content with it. The handful of times I sat in it as a passenger, I thought the seats were just the right amount of comfort and stiffness.   The biggest reason I avoided Porsches, though, was because of the cost of maintenance. Considering how intricate and complex Porsches can be, they seem like cars that are expensive to maintain without some kind of warranty or maintenance plan. Then again, I imagine that BMW and Jaguar aren't much better.  Regardless, thanks for the suggestion!"

I am most familiar with these two brands out of the Germans, and as someone who enjoys driving, the BMW takes 2nd place behind Porsche for me. You do pay a bit of a premium for P-cars over the usual BMW/MB/Audi crew, but you get higher craftsmanship, and generally a much more reliable vehicle.  Maintenance isn't too bad. Similar to the other Germans, but when you are spending 1k+ on a monthly payment, usually spending 400 vs 800 for maintenance once a year isn't that much of a difference.   If you take care of these cars, they will last you a very long time."

If you're looking for a track car, the M4 and Corvette are nice, but for everyday driving, the RCF and F type seem much more suitable. Personally, I would rank them RCF, Corvette, F type, M4, but I don't think you can really go wrong with any of them. Have you test driven these cars yet?"
whatcarshouldIbuy,3djzaw,rpolo123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:44:23 2015 UTC,"I totally agree on the aesthetics of those cars. I was originally drawn to the Jaguar because the F-Type's more 'modern', new look really makes it stand out from the rest of Jag's model catalog. Of course, that bold, intimidating look was backed up by a beastly engine, which I really like, so far.  I've had the chance to test drive the 2015 Jaguar F-Type and I've sat in (but didn't drive) a 2015 Lexus RC-F.   My first impression driving the Jaguar was that it was a little heavier than I was expecting, but that's probably relative for me because I currently drive a light, underpowered coupe. I loved the amount of power it had, especially in terms of the acceleration and the sound it gives off. The only mark I had against the Jag was that the seats are a little too plush. When I have that much power under the hood, I kind of prefer mildly stiff seats so that I can feel the way the car drives and handles.  My (limited) first impression of the Lexus was that the body itself is simply gorgeous and unique. The vehicle also was pretty well-equipped, in terms of features and tech. However, Lexus really lives up to its luxury brand status by stocking these cars with super comfortable seats. As strange as it sounds, I don't want a seat that is too plush because I feel like I can't mentally get into driving when I am too comfortable.  I tried to get into a Corvette so I could see what they're all about, but all our dealerships don't have them in stock. The Chevrolet dealership that had the biggest inventory in the county did have a couple in stock, but they insisted that they wouldn't let me test drive them because they're expecting to sell them any day now and they know that the new owners want as few miles as possible. I totally understand that, but I'm not big on buying a car without at least test driving it once or twice."

Pretty easy to drive around in the city.  Things I don't like: Desperately needs a 5th gear on the highway, endless electrical issues on mine, though I am guessing it may have been an isolated case though as others with it haven't really had that many issues. Interior quality is behind the Skoda for the last generation, have not sat in the new one yet. Fuel economy is not really good though I guess that is mainly caused by the automatic transmission.  I would personally consider the Skoda, heard many great things about the sister car, the VW up! and have personally gone to see the up! before. If you are buying the entry level variant, it would be a manual, so in that case the Skoda would be alright too, cause if you were looking for a self shifting one, the Hyundai might be a better option as the automated manual in the Skoda is slow..."

If you are looking for used cars, that is an entirely different ballgame that I would be more than happy to talk with you about."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3djnbz,Justheretolearnshit,2,Thu Jul 16 20:25:27 2015 UTC,Honda Fit would be my pick.   Also consider the Toyota Matrix / Pontiac Vibe (the vibe is the same mechanically as the Toyota but will be about 20% less)

The Ford Focus and Fiesta are both fun and economical city cars for your budget. The Juke grows on you after a while, and the upcoming Scion iM looks like a decent option, too.   Otherwise you got the Honda Fit and HRV, Mazda 3 and CX3, and the VW Golf as solid options."

They wont get as good of gas mileage as the Mazda3, or anything it's in class, but you'll get decent gas mileage with some utility space.   The HRV would be just out of your range, and the CX-3 will most likely be more than the HRV.  A Nissan Juke is not bad (decent gas mileage, higher ride height, and option for AWD; uses premium gas though), and you could probably snag a new one for under $20K (despite it's MSRP.) I think it's fun to drive (my wife owns a 2015 AWD Juke S.)  Perhaps a Kia Soul. It get ok-ish gas mileage, but will be decently equipped for around $20K. It's a fairly reliable car."

whatcarshouldIbuy,3dj1y2,three_horsemen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:51:02 2015 UTC,Does she not want another Fusion?  Should be able to get into a comparable vehicle if your insurance is working properly.  $15k is definitely on the low end for that car.
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dj1y2,skinny8446,2,Thu Jul 16 23:51:29 2015 UTC,No. Neither of us like the Fusion after extended driving. It rides and drives like a boat and she wants something a little smaller. That's why I was thinking Camry.
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dj1y2,skinny8446,3,Fri Jul 17 00:15:24 2015 UTC,Fusion drives better than any Camry in your price range.  They're also nearly identical in size.    Have to go to an Accord for a more buttoned down feel in that size class but stick to a '13+.  Might have to find a private party sale to stay in your budget as there won't be much available at that price point.     Smaller cars....you might check out the '14+ Mazda 3.

However, as a fellow VW fan, i'd HIGHLY recommend that you spend slightly more for a non-base Jetta, such as the SE trim if you can afford it. VW recently put in a new 1.8T engine into it and it's FANTASTIC! One of the best turbo 4 cylinders on the market. The 2.0L base engine isn't terrible, but the 1.8T is worth every penny. I had a rental Golf a few weeks ago with that engine and saw almost 40mpg on the highway!"

They are dirt cheap used, i'm not sure about your area but 2012's with around 40k on them are going for $14-150000 in my area.  Have you looked into the new Camry Hybrid?

whatcarshouldIbuy,3dhuww,deverhartdu,3,Thu Jul 16 11:59:48 2015 UTC,"I'll offer some anecdotal evidence on the CR-V and the Pilot.  I had a '98 CR-V that ran for about 150,000 without any complaints or issues crop up. Other than minimal basic maintenance (oil, brakes, etc), it was 100% worry free and trust worthy. It would still be running to this day, I think, except for the fact that it had an unfortunate introduction to the side of a tree.  I also have an '05 Pilot. Like the CR-V, it's been perfect. 140,000 miles on it now, again, no issues. Runs like a charm. I couldn't recommend it enough. No rattles yet, either. A few years ago, I got a dog (90lb Lab) and use the Pilot as the Dogmobile. No complaints as far as ""dog usability"" either.  Both of mine are first-gen vehicles, and the new ones have significantly better feature content than the older ones (taking tech advancements into account, of course). I really can't recommend them enough.  They're not the most ""fun"" or dynamic drives, but they're worry free and very ""livable."""
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dhuww,mvs5191,2,Thu Jul 16 14:48:20 2015 UTC,I hate you honda and toyota! Your resale value is going to force me to buy new and not save a lot of money on a slightly used model.
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dhuww,Remixmark,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:02:23 2015 UTC,"Well the '16 Pilot is all new and there's not a lot of inventory.  They'll be selling for a premium for a little while.  It's a nice update and if you like the styling it's probably a good choice.  You're taking some risk with an all-new model but the power train is at least vetted for the most part.    The CRV doesn't have any major changes for '16 although there's been complaints about the updated '15 design in terms of vibration problems.  The CVT is also an area of complaints.  If you can swing a better deal for the '15, it would be worth it since you're keeping it so long.  I personally think the CX-5 is a better vehicle, but there are more discounts on the CRV.  You might consider stepping up to the '16 RDX.  It's similar size (same platform) as the CRV, but has a better feel all around.  MUCH better performance.    My problem with the Outback is to get decent performance you have to step up to the 3.6Ltd and then mpg drops to the same levels as the Pilot but with less space, no third row, and less tow capacity.  The only advantage is the better AWD system, although the Pilots is perfectly capable for the avg joe."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dhuww,skinny8446,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:59:28 2015 UTC,I think we would both absolutely love an RDX but ultimately it ends up being a decent amount over our 40k budget unless you're familiar with better pricing. Maybe I can get a '15 for less? The reference to a possible discount on the Pilot was only if her father's employee pricing would work for us on such a new vehicle. I have yet to check out the CX-5. The test drive on the CRV seemed fine really but I certainly wasn't wowed with comfort style or performance by any means. The outback was very comfortable but you're right not a ton of get up and go which I like but we don't NEED really. Having something that can perform in the snow is important.
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dhuww,skinny8446,2,Thu Jul 16 13:30:18 2015 UTC,"The '16 RDX has some nice improvements in features/safety.  You should be able to get into a fairly well equipped model for right around $40k before tax.  Maybe less if her fathers employee pricing is decent (and can be used by you).  The '15 RDX isn't bad though if you can find one.  Inventory is dropping off fast, but it should be thousands less than a '16.  Oh and since you're keeping it 10 years...make sure you're very happy with it.  While you may not NEED a ton of power...in a few years in a used car that's barely keeping up with traffic....you may really grow to hate it."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dhuww,marvin_sirius,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:43:03 2015 UTC,oo now you're definitely making me want the RDX. I'd want a relatively nice trim level as well as AWD. Hopefully 15s aren't too hard to find but I'm betting you're right on inventory.

They didn't make that many cars on paper, although, for the average human being, most important restriction you will get for a car is the price. GM cars have a so bad reputation that their resell value pretty much follow the same as the level of a fuel tank in a challenger hellcat.  The worst thing about GM is also the best thing about GM. They break. Very often. It seems that GM knows that, because their cars are pretty much the easiest to fix, and in general, their parts are the cheapest too.  A GM car WILL bring you to the garage, but if you fix them yourself, they will be so cheap that you won't even care. A Honda does not break often, but when it does, ouch.  Also, in general, GM knows how to make an engine and manual transmission. Those are pretty much the most expensive things to repair in car. My experience with those is if driven like an adult and maintained properly, those will last much longer than the rest of the car.     Oh, and you know, MURICA."

There have been teething issues as is typical with an all-new model but nothing major......except for the ZF transmission which is causing problems in both Chrysler and Acura vehicles.  Jeep seems to have taken the brunt of the bad publicity over it, mainly because they've been using that transmission a year longer and have about 6X as many units on the street as Acura.  ZF claims the problems are completely programming related....which means it should be fixable.    Jeep sold close to 200,000 Cherokees last year so from an odds perspective, they're probably in your favor to get a decent one.  Obviously not all of those Jeeps are off the road.  But there's more risk there than buying something that doesn't have any known problems.      The Xterra wouldn't be a bad choice and very similar to your Frontier.

The Mazda's smart brake could help if she has a tendency to run into things directly in front of her. I don't believe it engages when turning, so she will still need to be cognizant when switching lanes and what not. Luckily, there is blindspot monitoring, which I think is pretty helpful. It beeps if you attempt to lane switch into an area that a car may be present.   Again, not fool-proof, but helpful technology. I have a 2016 CX-5 Grand Touring with the Tech Package. It includes blind spot monitoring and city brake support (active at low speeds - up to ~20mph.)

You probably want a 9th gen Accord so go for 2.4 liter DOHC Earth dreams 4 cyl engine with a 6 speed manual. I don't trust CVT's they break a lot. And iV-TEC gives a good balance between power and low mpg cruising.   Not a big fan of Fords in general, parts for repair are expensive. Used to own a Falcon XR6 and it cost me the heavens to maintain. If you still want a Fusion then get the eco boost 2 liter inline 4 for the 2nd gen Fusions.

With all of them, you can go mildly off road with no real problem (dirt trails and whatnot.)"
whatcarshouldIbuy,3deqb9,Randmness,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:38:37 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on what you mean by off-road.  A Forester can handle things like bumpy forest roads.  But it's not going anywhere remotely extreme without damaging the low-hanging fruit.  Are you open to used?

If you're fine with just getting rid of the car and having nothing in 3 years, then you can get something practical (and not very ""fun"") like a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla. The lease terms will be really low (eg. under $200/month, little $ down). You can get the sportier versions of each car, as well.  Your next step up are cars like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. These are going to cost more per month (still well under $400), and they're faster with even more sporty options.  Finally, there's the Nissan Maxima. It's as sporty as a sedan gets, and way more expensive than the others, but you may actually be able to swing it on a 3 year lease if you qualify and don't go crazy with options. It should put you a little under $400/month. With the down payment, you'd end up right at the $15k mark. I have a Maxima and it's an awesome car. It feels like a sports car, but it's still a sedan.  Personally, since you're going to be using it in college, I'd get the Corolla or Civic. The others may be more fun to drive, but you don't really need them."

AWD sounds good for you, but maybe not if you want something that's also fast.   The Nissan Altima might work, for speed/sportiness and price (on a lease.) Maybe an AWD Mitsubishi Lancer?

The E90 M3 is one of my favorites, the torque is a little low but that V8 at high RPM sounds so freaking good, and the car handles like its on rails, but also giving you the ability to kick the tail when needed.

The M3 put a smile on my face so big, I didn't even bother with the 335.   Anyway, I bought a 2010 E90 6MT, I love it, best thing I ever spent money on. Every time I drive it, I'm smiling like an idiot. Don't expect gas mileage out of this car, the best I've gotten is 22 on the highway, granny shifting constantly which is next to impossible when you can rev past 8K RPM."

whatcarshouldIbuy,3dc4ib,chickentikka69,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"Tough choice, but I think it all depends on your driving style. 8 out of 10 times, especially around town, the 335i will feel faster than the M3 because of the power delivery. The N55 engine is tremendous in the way it puts down the power right off the line. Between the two, I think I'd swing for the F30 335i myself because it's newer, will have a warranty, and comes with up to date electronics. The E9X M3 has a tremendous engine with amazing DCT, but the iDrive, etc are pretty outdated at this point. If you can find a CPO M3 in your price range, then it's a no brainer. The only way to appreciate the M3 is to open it up on the back roads, whereas the 335i will put a smile on your face, even while zipping through traffic. Can't go wrong with either. Good luck!"

I live in NJ and I have a pain in the ass commute. 45 miles each way, An hour and 10 minutes each way. After looking at used cars, I bit the bullet and bought a 2015 Nissan Altima for this purpose. I am putting 90+ miles a day on it, and it Hasn't given me any problems, and its nice having a car with AC that works & satellite radio when you're in a traffic jam. Its not my dream car, and I hate having a car payment. I like and prefer to drive cars from the 80s, but I also like not being broken down 40 miles from my job or house.  DO NOT buy any used BMW, benz or any other luxury car brand, you're asking for trouble!  Anything with 150K mileage on it is going to need work soon, and you'll hit 200K before you know it.  If a new car is out of the question, I suggest getting a 10 year old Honda Civic (2004, 2005 Civic's are good years, I know from experience), or a 10 year old Toyota Camry/Corolla. Early 2000s Nissan Maximas are good, Mazda 3 or 6 is good too. You could probably find one in good condition for your price range."

Do a carfax, sometimes you can get a maintenance & repair history if the dealer/shop reports the repairs to carfax. Maybe the trans already failed on it and its been replaced. Who knows.  54k miles is not a lot for a 12 year old car. That tells me that the car sat around a lot, and most of those miles are probably local/city miles.  Me personally - I would not own a 2003 Acura TL unless it was given to me for free. I would not buy a model where I know that theres a good chance the transmission could fail. Of course this could happen to any used vehicle, but I'd role the dice on a model where the chances of an expensive repair are a lot less."

whatcarshouldIbuy,3dc91b,Randmness,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:20:35 2015 UTC,"It all depends on how bad your jeep is, currently. Imo, unless you're commuting far, it may be cheaper to keep your jeep for a couple more years to build your credit. After your jeep dies, you can always move to a Civic, Versa, Sentra, Corolla, or a Camry. Also look at domestic brands. I had a 2001 Dodge neon that was very reliable. Neons get a bad rep, but the second gen (2000-2005) with the manual transmission has been very reliable in my experience. I also regularly saw 35 mpg. Also consider a used Ford Focus as well. I definitely wouldn't go for a European car in your situation, especially not anything BMW, Mercedes, or even VW. They can be cheap to buy, but they are never cheap to repair, especially at a dealership. Then again, all brands are expensive to repair at a dealership. My cars never see dealers unless the car is still under warranty.  TL:DR-In your situation, I'd build up my credit first and keep driving the jeep. If your jeep is really bad, I'd drive it until i could save a bit more and grab a corolla, Civic, Versa, etc. as an economy car. I encourage to do some research on domestic makes such as Ford Focuses because those depreciate more than asian makes."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dc91b,Dick_Burger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:07:51 2015 UTC,"VW is fairly easy to work with on credit. If you can get a co-signer, you'll be in better shape.  The car they sell in the greatest volume is the Jetta, so its pretty likely that will be your only choice with them.   Camry's are great but they are priced too high.  If you think you'll be able to trade up again in a few years when your financial situation improves, you could go with one of the lower priced SUV's from Hyundai, Kia, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Jeep, or Dodge, so you'll have lower payments but still, no repair bills because you'll have a new vehicle.  Moving down from an SUV to a small/midsize car is a shock to the system.  Been there and wouldn't recommend it.  There are SUV's (named above) in the $18K-$21K range and I think that is the best choice for you. If they won't work with you on credit, then go with the Jetta."

That should be a consideration. It would be best to go used, the initial depreciation hit is pretty significant especially with luxury cars. The 2014 Lexus with the larger engine and f sport package being around the same price is an example of this. For reference the BMW has 180 HP and the Audi has 170 HP. The power numbers are quite significantly different, and should factor into your decision, do you want the 300+ HP? Or are you fine with the base engine?"

Here are my impressions during my test drives.   IS350, A3, A4, Q50, TLX V6, and 328i. Plus the WRX as the control.   I'm not a fan of the q50's looks and it drove very, muscle car so it's my last choice at the moment   The TLX was ok to drive and had a ton of toys that were fun. Plus plenty of space. Front wheel drive is safe, but doesn't give the same feel as awd or rear wheel.   The A3 was really fun and a fun little car. Space is a bit cramped but not unreasonably. So far it's my front runner.   The A4 is just a bigger A3. I liked the looks and the extra space. But the weight made just a bit more sluggish. Same engine as the A3. Bit more expensive.   Is350, personally the fsport looks amazing to me. Plus tons of power, and decent toys. Much more expensive than the rest. My tester was topping 50. But the insurance is crazy high.   I haven't driven the 328 yet. That's my next test drive.   So, for me it's A3, 328, A4, TLX, IS350, Q50.   I'm curious what others will say."

But yeah, you're looking for midsize SUV's and pickups... which is a huge category precisely because they are so versatile and practical, so there's a lot of choices to narrow down.  The Jeep Wrangler should be thought of purely as a off-road performance machine. Just as you wouldn't take a race car for towing, don't expect it to be suitable either; pretty much every aspect of it is designed for off-road goodness and nothing else.  If I were to pick something that would fit your request I might go for...  A mid-2000's Chevy suburban/tahoe/escalade/yukon/avalanche  A V8 Grand Cherokee (not that great build quality, but they are fun, I used to have one)  Toyota 4runner (22RE, none of that V6 bullshit)  Oh, and one more thing to consider: Maybe keep the civic for everyday driving and get a cheap old truck for $1000 to use only when you're towing. You can then enjoy the good mpg's on most days, and only deal with the (horrific) gas mileage of the old truck when you really need to. I used to drive a 2004 avalanche every day because I rarely needed to tow a horse trailer... but I was able to greatly reduce my vehicle costs when I traded it for a '90 300ZX and a '68 F-250.

Fiat seems repairs would cost double like a Jetta, or I think Fiat is common to have electrical problems. I'm probably wrong.   .. and the Note? Is that bigger or smaller than the Versa? I'm guessing smaller.   Have you had any personal experience with the 3 you mentioned?"

My friend owns a 2013 Fiat 500 and he really hasn't had many problems with it. He did have trouble with the starter, but it's rare. It would work with one turn over or two. I will say this though, the Fiat 500 Abarth is a very fun car to drive, but is not suited for everyday driving.  The Versa Note is surprisingly about the same size as the Versa except it's just a hatchback version. I honestly have no idea why Nissan classified it as a subcompact, but it falls under that category lol. It has the most rear seat legroom you can find as well as a huge cargo space. It's not as spacious as the Honda Fit nor it doesn't have the ""magic seats"" feature but it still gets the job done."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dc8mz,Sonnington,2,Wed Jul 15 04:29:50 2015 UTC,"The Chevy Sonic might be better and perform better than the Spark. And a used one is in my price range.   I think I've driven a Spark or Sonic as,a rental car and was fine with it. I remember feeling  like I could easily see over the steering wheel."

Some mentions I should also add are the Kia Rio, Hyundai Accent and Mitsubishi Mirage, but I have no knowledge of the three.  Also, if you really want something interesting, wait for the Elio that Elio Motors is developing. It supposedly gets 84 mpg and is classified as a motorcycle despite running on 3 wheels."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3dc8mz,Randmness,2,Wed Jul 15 04:47:57 2015 UTC,"So I'm also in the market for a subcompact. I have a bias towards Honda and Ford. But from my research, the Fiesta takes longer to get up to 60 and has transmission problems. I've always disliked Fords, but look it up yourself. The Focus and Fiesta are being sued for tranny problems. There's a reason why people say Ford stands for Found on Road Dead.  The second generation Fit, from what I've gathered, is the sportiest. It has good handling and acceleration. The car lasts a long time with little maintenance and holds it's value. It also has the magic seats which give quite a bit of room.  I'd assume Yaris is similar to the Fit. I haven't heard anything bad about it. TBH, I haven't done much research into it."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3da0io,raiszx,3,Tue Jul 14 17:42:01 2015 UTC,"The E46 is a great car... When it works. But you have described it as a 'headache'. Is the headache worth how much fun the car is?  This is a personal choice. If your answer is no, then get the WRX. When you have an old BMW, you're bound to run into more issues. If you're okay with having to fix stuff all the time, keep the BMW."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3da0io,hitraj47,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:51:52 2015 UTC,"+1 on the WRX.   You don't have a ton of miles on your BMW (10,000/year) and you can still get a decent trade-in/private sale price.  What WRX trim are you looking at?"
whatcarshouldIbuy,3da0io,Remixmark,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:11:53 2015 UTC,sounds like it's on the threshold of being a project car if it's not already
whatcarshouldIbuy,3da0io,zzzzbear,0,Tue Jul 14 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"I'm at the same point as you, OP.  I have an e39 540i 6MT, it's got constant issues, even though it's a blast to drive.  Been thinking about trading up to something much newer. In my opinion, if the e46 is everything you want in a car when it's running right, then keep it and fix it.  It will be MUCH cheaper to fix everything in and out than getting a WRX.  And keep in mind, you'll have to fix it up at least somewhat to sell it anyway. I like Subarus, but when it comes down to it, BMW's are more solid, have more depth when you drive them, if you get what I mean.  The WRX feels and looks like a mass produced compact.  Yeah, it's fast.  But does it really push all the buttons like a 3 Series?  Only you can answer that. I personally am keeping my e39.  As annoying as the maintenance/repairs are, there just isn't anything sold that's comparable when you downshift and throw it into a tight curve."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3daift,gorillagnomes,2,Tue Jul 14 19:42:15 2015 UTC,"I would say yes but that's cuz I love those damn vans and they are awesome to drive around and chill,  but as a daily-everything-depends-on-it vehicle no."
whatcarshouldIbuy,3daift,FrankWolf86,2,Wed Jul 15 01:26:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't, unless you could do the work yourself. Otherwise you're into that van for way more than what its worth.  Since you commute by bicycle I assume your commute is short, could probably get away with using it as a daily (once the issues are fixed) if you aren't going far with it every day.  On the negative side - the overheating is a major red flag. Depending on how many times it was overheated there could be some serious damage done to the engine. I know you said there are no rust, but do you live in an area where vehicles rust?  Oil leak, I wouldn't worry about unless its gushing out from somewhere. Could be an easy or a hard fix depending on where it is. Just keep your eye on the oil and always carry spare quarts with you.  I think if you really want a van, you should get a Ford, Chevy, or a Dodge. Easier to find parts for, they've had the same body styles for years so you could get something a lot newer (and a lot less mileage) if the classic van style is what you want, and they're easier to sell because everyone wants them. Parts may be hard to come by for the toyota - I honestly can't even remember the last time I saw a toyota vanwagon on the road, had to be at least 10 years ago."
