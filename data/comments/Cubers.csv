Cubers,3e45kl,jugglingeek,8,Tue Jul 21 20:34:48 2015 UTC,"My wild guess is competition between companies and more money in the business. Molding complex pieces out of plastic has probably become cheaper aswell. Maybe better software for drawing the complex shapes of the pieces.   Edit: To add: I sold my vCube7, but if i remember correct the pieces had more ""sharp edges"" (I'm talking about the shapes of the pieces not the edge-piece) compared to the modern shengshou or moyu 7x7. The mods that people did to the vCube, was to round off the edges to make it lock up less. Modern cubes come with rounded off edges already. The moyu 7x7, which has the best turning imo, has pretty much no sharp edges inside the mechanism. But it's pillowed, so it's useless."

Cubers,3e28b7,inanimatus_conjurus,4,Wed Jul 22 00:32:32 2015 UTC,"If any layer is skewed by more than 45 degrees, the cube is not considered to be in a solved state, and 2 seconds is added. Known as a ""plus two"". For a plus two, the cube must be able to be solved with one move (U, F, R2, L', etc.). If the cube requires more than one move to solve, it is known as a DNF. No time is counted on a DNF and it can kill your average."

Cubers,3e0q46,Andymetoo,13,Tue Jul 21 01:45:58 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! congrats on learning how to solve. Welcome to /r/cubers.  EDIT: (After reading your other comments after posting this, I saw that you ended up buying a YJ Yulong. Great choice. However, I'll leave the buying guide in the comment incase you'd like to upgrade.)  A good beginner's choice for a small budget is the YJ GuanLong. It's a $4 cube, but a great one nonetheless.  A slightly better choice is the YJ YuLong. I personally started out with the stickerless version of the cube and it was great. I just bought other cubes and moved on from that one. Don't get me wrong, it still performs great.  If you're looking to jump right in, a Moyu Aolong v2 or Moyu Hualong are both amazing cubes and can be bought for $16. Many of the ""pros""/top cubers use these. You may think that they are too fast and some people say you should start on a slower cube but it's great to get used to a quick cube when starting out. If they're too fast, you can tighten them.  The Aolong has a miniature version which would work well with smaller hands.    Once you're comfortable using the beginner's method, you can move on to ""CFOP"" if you'd like. (by the way, which tutorial did you use?)  CFOP stands for:  - Cross: solving a cross/plus shape on the bottom of the cube (top if you're starting out)  - F2L: solving the first two layers of the cube simultaneously. You probably solve the corners of the first layer, then separately solve the edges of the middle layer. That's okay for now.  - Orientation of the Last Layer (OLL): solves the face opposite of the cross. If you do a white cross, this will solve the yellow side.  - Permutation of the Last Layer: (PLL): this will solve the last layer, moving around the last layer pieces and thus solving the cube   The algorithms for ""2 look"" OLL can be found here and a video to assist you is here. Doing OLL in 2 steps drastically reduces the number of algorithms from 57 to 7.   ""2 look"" PLL algorithms can be found here. A video to go along with that is here. By using 2 look PLL, you reduce the number of algorithms from 21 to 4.    Hope this helped. It likely seems like an abundance of information, so feel free to come back to it when you're more comfortable solving the cube."
Cubers,3e0q46,johnkphotos,5,Tue Jul 21 02:12:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the info. I'll probably stick to the beginner method for a couple more days just to get used to it, but you inadvertently answered a lot of questions I had, mainly what a lot of the acronyms meant. F2L etc.   I could have googled these in like two seconds but I figured I'd "" learn them when I get there"".   Regardless, I've had a lot of fun with it so far and can't wait to get to the next challenge.  The best thing about this is that I'm a special ed aide at a local high school and around December of last year I bought a Rubik's Cube for our class because I thought the kids might have fun playing with it and trying to figure it out. Many have tried and many have failed. Students and adults alike. What I thought would be a fun toy turned out to be a source of frustration. It sits to this day unsolved on our bookshelf.  I can't wait until class resumes in September so I can get back and destroy that thing. I will be a classroom hero haha."

It's the biggest factor in deciding whether I get a 2:30 or a 3:00ish time.   Ive probably only timed myself 5 or 6 times cause now I'm focused on just remembering the damn algs.

As far as the cross goes, It still takes me probably 8 seconds which is mega slow, but when inspecting it plan out at least 2 of your cross pieces.. after that it's very handy to know which colour is opposite which so you can do them with a bit less vision.   Also when you get around to learning intuitive F2L.. stick with it.  When I first started I'd always trip up and do it slower than the beginner method (had the beginner algs quite fast and muscle memory style).  Just did a quick solve and got cross in about 4 seconds with is good for me, panicked near the end and had a few cube lockups trying to go too fast with my shitty beginner algorithms:  1.20 :)"

At that point, i wanted to branch out. But instead of moving to a 4x4 like most people, i decided to look at my 3x3 differently. I started learning blind. I got the execution down, but memorizing proved to be a challenge. I gave up, and found another new trick to learn. I picked up roux simply by watching a few walkthrough solves, and using my CFOP knowledge for the last layer corners, and intuition to figure out LSE. Now that i'm decent with roux (havent timed myself, but probably sub-1 minute) i've gone back to blind. I'm making progress on memo, and i can usually solve the corners with my eyes closed, but i've got a lot to work on as far as edges.

It helps sand down (literally, I guess!) the rougher surfaces inside.  I used that cube as my main until I was around 25 seconds and could definitely have gotten faster than that with it, but I just chose to get a speedcube at that point (my first speedcube was a Taiyan II. Man does that bring back memories).  The sand 'mod' is detailed pretty well by Thrawst in this video: https://youtu.be/YTDblHV-NMU.  Anyway yeah, if Rubik's brand cubes haven't changed in mechanism since then, I'd say this is a safe mod to do to your cube, I've done it to multiple Rubik's brands and they've all come out well. Nowhere near as good as the cubes out these days, but they are definitely speedcube-able, which is more than can be said for a Rubik's brand out of the box.  Good luck and welcome to this hobby!"

Calvin's Square-1 I thought I had good intuition but the Square-1 humbled me. I needed hints to restore it to a cube shape. However, permuting the edges and corners was enjoyable. Online reviews say that this thing turns terribly out of the box but becomes awesome with lube, and they couldn't be more right - at first I thought it would break while turning the top/bottom layers, but now it's super smooth.  Calvin's 3x3x4 This thing is disgustingly smooth and the build quality is excellent. My first cuboid, I was able to solve it by intuition using some modified 4x4 principles. I can see this becoming a favorite.  LanLan Curvy Copter I jumbled one edge to show my fiancée and nearly lost track of where it went. I was so scared I put the puzzle down and refuse to touch it so far. Feels nice though."
Cubers,3e1642,CurbsideCuber,3,Tue Jul 21 14:30:37 2015 UTC,"Curvy Copter is a great puzzle. I figured it out without jumbling, but needed help when it came to jumbling, as I didn't have any experience with that concept yet.  It really is like two puzzles in one: Jumbled scramble and non-jumbled scramble.  So don't be afraid to scramble it and see how it works without jumbling, then when you get that down go ahead and jumble-scramble. Have fun!"
Cubers,3e1642,gillstogills,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:24 2015 UTC,That was my experience with it too; jumbling is such an interesting concept.
Cubers,3e1642,Szalkow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:49 2015 UTC,"I do have some familiarity with jumbling - the Mastermorphix 3x3 shapemod has similar slices that can be partially turned, shape-shift, and settle back into unsolveable orbits. But it's a much simpler puzzle and it's easy to remember the 3x3 rules.  I've heard horror stories about the Curvy Copter though!"
Cubers,3e1642,CurbsideCuber,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"Relating to the MasterM is a similar concept, but not exactly the same as jumbling. On the MM the pieces never actually leave their orbit, they just shape-shift and may appear to be out of orbit.  (Just like 4x4 odd parity, it appears to be ""unsolvable"", but the pieces never actually left their orbit.)  Jumbling actually swaps pieces out of their orbit to a place they ""should never be"" and requires a jumbling move to restore them.  It's a concept deeper than I fully understand, so I'll stop there, but it is another fascinating aspect of twisties. Again, have fun!"

I agree with your thoughts on all the cubes, especially the SQ1.  Top/bottom was horrible to begin with.  A few drops of Maru and then it was like butter, and strangely, the Maru hasn't worn off, even months later.  Had never looked at the super floppy before, that looks really interesting.  At only $6, definitely going to throw one of those in my next order."

Doing about one or two a day until I have them down and can recognise the pattern. Other than that, I scramble, complete up until F2L, and then repeat. (Unless one of the OLLs I know comes up).

Cubers,3e1642,VenomGrafix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:19 2015 UTC,"That seems solid. What I did, was do exactly what you did, but go up to OLL and learn the one which was on the cube. Then I'd do that for every solve and eventually I'd learn them all."
Cubers,3e1642,Szalkow,3,Tue Jul 21 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"This was my method as well. Also, several LL algs can be repeated to ""cycle"" through a few different cases until you're back to solved, so you can execute it once to see how it works and then drill it a few times in a row to aid your memory."

I got myself a speed cube (newisland) and started practicing F2L and 4 Look Last Layer with finger tricks. I quickly got my time down to about a 55 second average, but now I'm stuck. I feel like 55 is not even that good, but I cannot get any faster the past couple weeks. In fact, I'm pretty sure I was just as fast before using beginner's method. What gives?"

I don't use any special algs. You have to find a block of a middle and an edge, then find the other edge. Make sure the 2 edges are in the same layer, if they aren't do an R2/F2/L2, slice it over, flipping alg, then slice back."

Cubers,3e1c58,slothphysicist1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:01:12 2015 UTC,What are you going to do for cubes with different tensions. Depending on how precise you can get the turns you might have problems with lockups. Having a single constant may not work if the sides have slightly different tensions. Maybe consider adding a calibration mode?
Cubers,3e1c58,gyroninja,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:21:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't think about that, that's a great idea. I have no idea how to do an automated calibration but I could try a manual calibration where you tweak the amount that the stepper motors move depending on your tensions. The goal would be to get the calibration as accurate as possible in order to prevent lockups. I think the stepper motors I'm looking at have more than enough torque to overcome the lockup if need be. The problem with stepper motors is that they don't have feedback so it wouldn't know if a lockup had occurred. I could try doing it with servos but I'm not sure if they make ones with enough torque to spin a Rubik's brand. Thanks for your suggestion"
Cubers,3e1c58,alan23394,2,Tue Jul 21 05:40:19 2015 UTC,Use encoders. They will make it turn 90° every time.
Cubers,3e1c58,PimpedKoala,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:56:08 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this would even be an issue, as long as your motors are very accurate when turning. (90 degrees, +- 5ish? Depending on corner cutting of the cube, but 5 is generous and won't cause lockups.) A motor will hardly be effected by tensions, so it's not like it will slow it down to the point where the program thinks it has turned 90 degrees but really has only turned 80.  I'm also not really understanding, will the machine solve with color sensors or is given a scramble and solves it? If it is given a scramble, then it will just reverse it, making the logic very simple, yes?"
Cubers,3e1c58,PimpedKoala,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:29:46 2015 UTC,"Let me clarify: the machine will accept inputs from the user, no color sensors or famcy trickery required.

Cubers,3e0boo,PuzzleCat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:23 2015 UTC,"I just recently got it and right out of the box I knew it would become my OH Main. It is 1 mm smaller than a regular sized cube which feels just right for me, since I don't like small cubes like the 55 mm Zhanchi. The Gans 356 is very fast with excellent corner cutting and virtually no lockups which makes it a very nice cube. Overall I would recommend it if you have the money. If not, any of the other suggestions you mentioned should be fine."
Cubers,3e0boo,Bigfatsnoozy,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"Oh cool. I'll search for more opinions on the Gans as, like RawJM said, it might be flimsy.

Cubers,3e0boo,RawJM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:27 2015 UTC,"I'd say no. The Gans 356 is way too flimsy to be an OH cube. It moves too much. As or these three, I'm almost sure that the Mini DaYan ZhanChi 55mm is preferred, but a lot of people also do enjoy the Mini MoYu WeiLong.

Cubers,3e0boo,BigfootTouchedMe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:04 2015 UTC,"When you say lock ups, do you mean that because some say its flimsy  its hard to move the cube without it locking up? Or do you refer to the small catches on the center piece and corner people have been experiencing. If it is the latter, I've heard loosening the corner piece screws fixes this."
Cubers,3e0boo,BigfootTouchedMe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:12:24 2015 UTC,I'm talking about the catches. I did do the corner loosening and it fixed for the most part but for OH you can't make as accurate turns that you can for two handed solves. The decreased accuracy of the turns makes the catches worse. It could just be my tensions but that's my opinion

Cubers,3e0boo,Villyer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:05:53 2015 UTC,I suck at OH and just use my normal main. If I get an OH cube it will be a mini WeiLong. Gans are really good and in case you didn't know /u/fazrulz is the new world champ for OH (among other events) so if he rates then it's good. Another idea is get the cheaper WeiLong and a puzzle you don't have like pyra or skewb

As my username suggests I'm a keen juggler and have been for about 15 years.  When I started there were 6 people in the world who had flashed* 12 balls. I knew two of them and they both said that 13 may be impossible. Then Alex Baron came along and not only flashed 13 but had some unprecedented success with 11 balls  In the world of athletics there continues to be improvements in training and technology which enables athletes to beat world records. However in 1968 Bob Beamon jumped 8.9m at the Olympics in Mexico city long jump a truly astonishing distance, 55cm further than anyone had ever jumped before. People said it would never be bettered. Eventually of course someone did jump 8.95m, Mike Powell in Tokyo  My point is that people keep finding ways to better the 3x3 record.

We will eventually reach that point, where a 3x3 WR single will take years and years to beat. But at that point, I think people will still practice 3x3, and take what they know to big cubes. They can almost always be improved, if you look at WR's there are always pauses or lockups. A faster 3x3 stage will also mean a faster big cube solve. So imo, once we hit the unbeatable record, the community shifts to big cubes, but improved 3x3 will make it even more exciting.   (Also more impressive to the average noncuber :P)"

When I am looking ahead in my solve, I have no fricking clue how other pieces will be oriented when I'm done inserting. That's like...Faz level. Looking ahead does not imply knowing where the pieces will end up, it is looking at the pieces as they move so you don't need to pause to insert the next pair.   It may seem like a challenge now, and this is where I would give you practice tips, but you seem to have it down. I'm sure you've tried slow turning which helps tremendously, and another thing I do is close my eyes and start a timer once I open them, then stop it once I've finished a pair. This will help you lookahead and become quick at finding pairs if you couldn't look ahead for them. Do this 4 times, and try to get your combined times under 13-16 seconds, that should get you sub-25 depending on last layer/cross."
Cubers,3e0lq3,PimpedKoala,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:24:20 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I see. Thanks! One more thing, what would you suggest a good goal to be for each step in CFOP in order to be sub 20? My cross is around 2-6 seconds (2 being pretty easy cross, 6 is when I have the regrip and do F and B moves (very bad on implementing cube rotations in my cross, working on that)), F2L is around 15-16 seconds, Last Layer is the rest (since I just learned full PLL and I'm VERY slow at recognizing cases, my PLL is the largest thing holding me back from sub 25 so im improve on that by learning 2 sided recognition and how to properly fingertrick the algs through cyotheking's vids on youtube)."
Cubers,3e0lq3,PimpedKoala,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:04:30 2015 UTC,"Quoting from a post on the forums,   The ""idealised"" relative proportions are: cross 12%, cross+1 24.5%, F2L (inc cross) 62%, OLL 16.5% (inc recog and AUF), PLL 21.5% (inc recognition and AUF), Total last layer 38%.    So for sub-20, cross has to be < 2.4, cross + F2L < 12.4, and last layer has to be < 7.6. I have been getting plenty of sub-20 full step solves, and for me these numbers are really accurate. THe only difference is for me, my cross is a tiny bit quicker (takes just about 1.5-2 seconds). 6 seconds(For you) seems a little much, try blind solving it and planning out all the moves during inspection. I use a lot of F and B moves during my crosses but not many rotations.   I also don't know full PLL, but I know everything but Rb perm, N perms and G perms, so I usually get sub 20 when I get a case I know, but I have gotten it from 2LPLL also.   As for sub-25, you don't really need full PLL. Of course it helps, but just keep working on F2L, once you can get F2L + cross under 16 seconds consistently, you should be good for sub-25. Then it's just alg drilling until lower 20's, and the step I'm on now is getting more consistent with my F2L.   Btw, cyotheking has great vids for that stuff"
Cubers,3e0lq3,Stewy_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:49:16 2015 UTC,"although yes you can be sub 25 without knowing full PLL, learning full PLL at sub 30-40 helps and might as well be learnt, as it cuts down your LL times significantly"
Cubers,3e0lq3,PimpedKoala,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:52:03 2015 UTC,"I personally saved learning full PLL for my current speed because I knew sub-20 would be a tough one and I thought it might give me the little boost I needed, and once I finish it I hope it does"
Cubers,3e0lq3,Stewy_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:56:32 2015 UTC,"but you could apply that logic to learning PLL earlier for a ""speed boost"" earlier, overall you end up spending just as much time working on cross+f2l anyway, regardless of when you learn PLL :P"
Cubers,3e0lq3,BigfootTouchedMe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:48:40 2015 UTC,I do think learning algs is a good way to break a barrier because it's way less frustrating than looking at the same times on a timer every day IMO.
Cubers,3e0lq3,Stewy_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:56 2015 UTC,And you're guaranteed to shave off time immediately
Cubers,3e0lq3,PimpedKoala,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:09:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I didn't know about those statistics! As for my 6 second cross, those are rare (I'd say 1 in 20 solves) and most of them are because I regrip and do awkward (and really slow) F and B moves instead of just cube rotating, which is what I'm working on in cross currently. I can actually plan the cross most of the time :D As for learning full PLL, the main reason I learned was because since it is summer break, I might as well learn them since I know I won't have time in the school year"
Cubers,3dwm9b,BigfootTouchedMe,9,Mon Jul 20 03:34:30 2015 UTC,Wtf since when has this sub had over 2000 subs lol

Cubers,3dwm9b,killer4u77,2,Mon Jul 20 04:30:53 2015 UTC,What reason would there be for such rapid growth?
Cubers,3dwm9b,rhythmicidea,3,Mon Jul 20 04:35:09 2015 UTC,"People from SS finding out about the sub and casual cubers on reddit seeing a link to /r/Cubers, AMAs from cubers probably help a lot. This sub is probably a pretty even mix of both people who are really into cubing and follow SS and other social media type stuff like YouTube and facebook, as well as people who are casual cubers that just happen to have a reddit account."
Cubers,3dwm9b,killer4u77,7,Mon Jul 20 04:41:44 2015 UTC,Recently it was Steven Brundage's performance on Penn and Teller that caused it. A few days after that /r/cubers was trending. As well as /r/magic.

Cubers,3dwm9b,mg33,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:54 2015 UTC,The source is non cubers who think everything from 1x1x1 to 28x28x28's are 10x10's.
Cubers,3dyezx,Plotsmurphy,3,Mon Jul 20 15:33:21 2015 UTC,"I would either choose a last layer scramble (cstimer has this option and plenty of other timers) or just reverse each scramble and write it down so you can quickly practice whichever one you like.  I think someone made a PDF a while ago about this, but it might've been PLLs and I can't find it"
Cubers,3dyezx,PimpedKoala,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:20:15 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of something similar to what someone said in this thread     Prisma Puzzle Timer has a category for practicing PLLs and OLLs. It gives you scrambles that generate a random case. If you don't want to practice all OLLs, you can copy and paste the cases you are practicing to a text file and then open it with the timer.   But if worse comes to worse, I could get off my lazy ass and actually put in some work.  I did try to do what they said, but prisma doesn't seem to like lowercase notation: d, d', r, r' etc.  nor does it like wide notation: Dw, Dw', Rw, Rw' etc.  So I couldn't get it to import a lot of cases..."

Cubers,3dyezx,BileNoire,2,Tue Jul 21 22:45:05 2015 UTC,"I use the OLL trainer from badmephisto, I don't even solve the cube between algorithms. You have the option to chose which algorithm to practice, and time for individual OLL, so you know which one are the slowest, it helped me figuring out i had to switch algs for some OLL because they didn't fit my fingertricks."
Cubers,3dyezx,grapefruit95,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:34 2015 UTC,BileNoire is right ive only used badmephistos PLL trainer program but i am sure the oll trainer is just as good
