For instance, his 25 Nights for Nujabes would classify as jazzy hip-hop instrumentals. His Dowhatyoulove is trap. His Songs to Break/Make up to would classify as trip-hop / experimental hip-hop / electronic hip-hop  I'm assuming the other artists you mentioned are similar in style so I think it mostly depends on the sound/atmosphere of the album. It's really hard to specify the genres for these kinds of artists since they explore all kinds of genres."

Nujabes,3dva8y,Consciouswrdsbt,2,Sun Jul 19 20:33:33 2015 UTC,Been a long time listener of Soulection. The older shows are definitely a lot better IMO. I wasn't really feeling it when they switched to rinse.fm or whenever they left kbeach radio. 30-40% of the music felt like 'turn up' music which isn't what I listened to Soulection for. This is around the time Mr. Carmack started to blow up. But when Joe Kay announced he was returning to the more chill sounds the shows got better. I have yet to listen to shows #214 and #215 though.

The tracks sound kind of choppy and don't flow as well.  It feels like you have a sampler, and you're just pushing buttons on it without having flow.  The individual sounds are good though, just need to work on the mix.  I can hear the potential though"
Nujabes,3dml0t,fleepss,2,Fri Jul 17 18:26:30 2015 UTC,thanks homie. i'm using ableton only but i've really only been messing around for about two weeks. my plan from the get go is to get a maschine soon because i'm a drummer and have little composing experience and I can't wait to get my hands on that thing.

On this photo you can also see some kind of EMU sampler (my bet would be E4k or E5k Ultra), Akai z4 or z8 and a DAT recorder - that could shed some light on his workflow. Also there's a Yamaha 03D for mixing purposes."

Nujabes,3cng7f,Consciouswrdsbt,2,Thu Jul 9 07:08:30 2015 UTC,TA-Ku isn't doing anything. He just produced the beat
Nujabes,3cng7f,NoirEm,2,Thu Jul 9 15:06:16 2015 UTC,Beats are usually more important than the voice. That's how so many terrible rap songs make it in the top 100. They have a slick beat and the voice is just a filler. That being said TA-KU's beats are insane.  Granted both voice & beat weigh heavily in this song. But that's just one man's opinion.
Nujabes,3cng7f,Senpai-,3,Thu Jul 9 17:30:31 2015 UTC,"No...you misinterpreted what I meant. I mean for the end of the song for the switch...he's not actually doing anything yet he's pretending like he is. Lol that's what I mean.  Also, music is subjective. There's different targets. He's not aiming for party music where some musicians are. The product is going to be different and a hip hop producer that can do both such as Mike Will Made It or Lex Luger is considered better too. Look at Rick Rubin."

Nujabes,3cj05i,oneZergArmy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:16:05 2015 UTC,"Okay so on a first listen through most of this isn't really my style it's pretty rock heavy and that's not really my taste (sorry!). I really like the jazz, piano melody, instrumental stuff.  Bohemianvoodoo is like the perfect group I'd use to describe what I like. Adria Blue and pretty much all of SCENES is just amazing. I probably should have said all this to begin with... Sorry again lol.  Jizue's piano parts are also flawless. Especially in  Hitorinouta, Kotonoha, and Yubiwa.   Guess I should throw out a toconoma song too just for show since I enjoy them a lot too, Seesaw is probably my favorite.    Anyway onto what you linked, again most of it I just couldn't get behind it was either too rockish and heavy or the vocals just really put me off. That being said there were some standouts.   Uchu Conbini's instrumentation was really enjoyable but man I couldn't get past her vocals... The intros to all their songs were really sick especially 8films~tobira but once the singer came in... All the singers in general sounded pretty similar and I'm not a big fan of their style.   Elephant Gym is kinda cool but again the vocals I'm not a fan. Head and Body was a pretty good song though.   Kyojaku also had some pretty cool instrumentation. Egoist was a nice song.  Mouse on the Keys could be so fucking cool if they just mixed it a little better, the drums are to loud and the bass is to heavy but the idea there is sick.  A Picture of Her was for sure my favorite overall of everything linked. Definitely will be looking for more of them in the future. All four of their songs you linked I enjoyed, not sure what my favorite of them was yet but will be listening to them more.   Mirror was another decent group, they were a little more on the rock side than I like but still, decent."

Nujabes,3bvmus,pneumaPhytologist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:02:24 2015 UTC,The Special Herbs are great. The really show the evolution of his beats from KMD to Operation Doomsday to now with JJ Doom. Pretty to move through them.
Nujabes,3bvmus,interruptingsound,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:21:28 2015 UTC,Yeah the frustrating thing about this release is that it shortens all the tracks. Arrow root is available on MF Dooms special herbs volume 1. Go for the individual special herbs sets if you want the full length tracks should be above three hours of music. Hold on let me find a pic I have it somewhere. Edit: apparently over 4 hours have fun.  http://gyazo.com/44b8ea300b0a30a2cc7debdc357f5dca

Nujabes,3bj370,Enjoyitbeforeitsover,2,Tue Jun 30 02:53:23 2015 UTC,"Hey there. Music production, or beat making, uses programs called DAWs, or digital audio workstations (such as Ableton Live or FL Studio). Plugins are sounds (such as Kawai piano or Wavestation Ukulele) that producers use within their DAW to make music. So if I wanted to make a beat with a particular sound, let's say clarinet, my first task would be to download a nice sounding clarinet plugin to load into my DAW, so that when I played my musical keyboard, clarinet sounds play. Hope this makes sense!"

Nujabes,3b1be6,NanoChemist,6,Thu Jun 25 04:12:36 2015 UTC,"learn to play drums and a string instrument before you start producing, you will know a lot more about music naturally and it will come easier to you once you get serious. studying theory helps but is time consuming. also, treat your music program like an instrument in that you can always get better at projecting exactly what you're trying to make. other than that, having a wide variety of musical knowledge of jazz and the roots of hip-hop etc. is critical to having a style that takes influence from the past but that also looks to improve and create original styles, and also comes in handy for sample hunting.  becoming a skilled producer takes time, i have been using FL Studio for more than 8 years and I still consider myself barely able to produce what my mind wants to hear, even though I can on guitar. It is a truly difficult task to become a great producer but the most important factors to great sound are time and persistence. That and differentiating influence from imitation."

Nujabes,3a10qo,Aquatrium,4,Tue Jun 16 11:31:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, I interpreted the lyrics way differently than /u/krogars  With just listening to the song and then reading the lyrics (I was playing a videogame) I took a very literal meaning from the song.  He's walking through a city in the very early morning with the sun rising, ""5am, pavement a hint of blue"" and is essentially describing how the city is like an a aquarium and he is the fish swimming through it."
Nujabes,3a10qo,FreddyBlackJack,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:52:01 2015 UTC,"That's how I'd see it too, but there's more to it. A theme of a poem or a lyric (from what I've been taught) can't be ""I'm a fish swimming through the city"". It can be ""reacting to the modernization"", ""despising modernization"", ""embracing modernization"" or rather, ""modernization"" as a whole. I'd love to hear more of what you have to say, mate!"
Nujabes,3a10qo,krogars,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:50:21 2015 UTC,"(I apologize in advance, this post will go off in a tangent)  You know, you brought something interesting to me. About ""modernization"" as a whole. It got me thinking about how he is comparing technology to the natural world.     train cars sleep in beds for eels.  A subway car in a tunnel; an eel in a cave. And then I got to thinking about the medieval world vs. the modern. giant murals painted by rays Ancient murals (cave paintings, hieroglyphics on the pyramids) vs. modern signs (neon signs, lit billboards) chisels produce all shades of gray.  Stone ruins from gone civilizations vs. modern skyscapers.     But as I let the day pass and went out to grab some food and beer I would comeback to the song and give it a listen, read the lyrics again, look at the reply box, and then do something else. I did this about 15 or so times throughout the afternoon and when I finally opened a bottle of beer I took another listen. I started the video, and when he says ""way home from a long night out and about,"" I started thinking about what my friends and I would do on the weekends. Going out having a few and getting home really late at night / early morning. I started laughing to myself. ""Shing is dreaming!"" I laughed to myself. Took another sip and read the lyrics again.  *(5 AM after a night out drinking, walking down the street. All the streets around you are quiet but you can hear the faint sounds of early risers, the sun is slowly rising but still behind horizon. Glance down at your watch as the second hits its next mark seemingly to stop time. As it starts to move to the next moment you close your eyes and a breeze hits you from behind as almost to lift you off the ground, ""let go of equilibrium."" You feel as if you're floating, no swimming through your metropolis, your ""Aquatrium."" As you float about the trees, ""early birds sound off in triplets"" and ""underneath, leaves waver like seaweed."" As the sun continues to come up it takes away the darkness and signs on all night slowly get shut off as you come back to Earth. You finish your teary-eyed yawn, open your eyes with  the streets still empty. Your time out for the night is done with the crack of dawn.)  It was probably the beer that steered me into that interpretation but I guess that's I related the song to myself.  I apologize again for going off randomly, I have been writing this throughout the day while at work."
Nujabes,3a10qo,FreddyBlackJack,5,Thu Jun 18 01:24:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, this is all going to be my own interpretation of the lyrics. Please bear with me -- I'm going to try and break down all of it as I understood it.  As an overview, I believe that Shing is rapping about the city, the quietness of morning, and a newfound perspective on life. Everyone is living in a ""metropolitan aquarium,"" or the ""Aquatrium"" -- I understood it to be a combination of this phrase. In an aquarium, there are so many different types of fish just as there are many different types of people, and they all swim against and among each other just as people are ""swimming"" through the streets. I think that Shing is describing his own feelings of living in this type of environment.  Now I'll explain my thought process as I analyzed the lyrics:   5am, pavement a hint of blue / Opposite of mayhem look for clues / No visible signs of tires, lazy signals / Way home from a long night out and about / Faint sounds of paper routes   This is the setting. It's 5am, and the pavement reflects the time of day. Not only that, I saw it to also allude to the color of aquariums, which is a blue glow. It's the opposite of the mayhem of the day in the morning. He is looking for clues of life, but there are no tires or anything. He's been out for a while and now that it's morning, he hears the faint noises of people delivering papers -- probably either the sound of bikes, or the sound of newspaper against the ground.   I can send shouts cross-town, check the time / The second hand pegged at first glance / Starts to move in a quantum chance / With help from back of the eye lids / Soles peel off the concrete / Feel free to complete / Unfinished poetry in a black book with a hook to boot   I will agree with /u/krogars below in that Shing is probably talking about modernization as well. ""I can send shouts cross-town, check the time / The second hand pegged at first glance"" : This line can definitely be interpreted to mean that he can now call people all the way across town and even check the time very quickly, so much so that he can even read the minutes (second hand) the first time (at first glance). This is the digital watch. However, I also interpreted the first line to continue that feel of the morning at 5am. ""Starts to move in a quantum chance / With help from back of the eyelids"" : Here's where I have a different opinion than /u/krogars in that I believe he is talking about sleeping. Here he may be saying that sleeping helps tell the time in this hectic place because in a city, it's always bright. Next, he describes soles on the concrete, and how it completes his unfinished poetry -- ""with a hook to boot."" As for ""hook,"" hooks are the chorus in his rap (in this case, it starts with ""...more like swimming in a / Metropolitan aquarium).  Not only that, people fish in the ocean with hooks.  So perhaps he is ""catching"" ideas for his rap through the inspiration of the city.   Staircase of air / Past the mezzanine eye level with multiple tiers / While stories ascend, vacant offices signs for rent / Sailing around the bend, around the bend, around the bend   Here's more on the city. ""Staircase of air"" -- an elevator! He's describing a tall building, maybe even a skyscraper. Wikipedia says that a mezzanine is ""an intermediate floor between main floors of a building."" While the stories (floors of the buildings) grow higher and higher, there are vacant offices for rent. Perhaps ""Sailing around the bend"" means that they appear on every street corner.   An upward stream will take you there / Bizarre affair / Balloon mind state / Hovering straits / Dock to ships, piers for windows appear to kindle / Giant murals painted by rays / Chisels produce all shades of gray / Sun dial towers over parks / Light devours remnants of dark   Now, here's something very interesting. ""Balloon mind state"" reminds me of the poem ""The Balloon of the Mind"" by William Butler Yeats. Ask yourself: How or why is the mind like a balloon? He then goes on to describe more about the setting. Docks, ships, and piers look bright or like they're set on fire. ""Giant murals painted by rays"": They are not literal painted murals, but rays of the sun ""painting"" murals on the walls. ""Chisels produce all shades of gray"": Perhaps he is describing the statues or stone architecture created by chisels. Then Shing describes how the light of the city devours the rest of the darkness of the night, so it always looks bright.   Diodes slowly fade to rest / Material properties made to test / Unprimed canvas staff of cables / Early birds sound off in triplets / Silhouette on billboard / Getting up in the frame / Without leaving a single trace   Here Shing is describing the onset of morning.  ""Diodes slowly fade to rest"": Those bright lights of the night are fading with the morning.  ""Unprimed canvas staff of cables"" : I think that this is a double entendre, but only because there is no comma between ""canvas"" and ""staff"".  Firstly, ""unprimed canvas"" refers to more painting.  Unprimed canvases have to be stretched before use.  Just like the sun paints murals on walls, the telephone poles (staff of cables) are stretching like unprimed canvases across the ground while early birds tweet in succession.  The next few lines may describe people putting up those ads on billboards without leaving a trace of their existence.  I mean, have you ever seen people up there changing the billboards?  Personally, I've never even seen those people!   Underneath, leaves waver like seaweed / Train cars sleep in beds for eels / Miniature models, life-size goals / Am I flying? more like swimming in a / Metropolitan aquarium / Let go of equilibrium / Million-volt phosphorescence / Oscillating reflections   Now, here he is making parallels between aquariums and the setting/city.  Leaves are like seaweed.  Train cars are long and wiggle like eels on the tracks.  ""Miniature models, life-size goals"":  I interpreted this line to mean that in the grand scheme of things, these things like cars and trains are like miniature models, but he wants to have life-size goals, not small ones.  Now the music video echoes the lyrics: ""Am I flying?"" This sentence casts quite a dreamy net over the song, I think.  Next is the beginning of the hook.  He's not flying, he's actually swimming/floating in the water of the Aquatrium.  Phosphorescence could be a parallel to the jellyfish/other fish that light up, but he says ""million-volt"" which means the light is much stronger than the natural lights of the sea via the jellyfish.  Oscillating reflections describes the hubbub of the city in lights as they blink and wave in the air, or as people pass by them.   Bit by bit increase resolution / Bit by bit gain perspective / As I come down rubber kiss the asphalt / Eerie stillness, teary yawn / Hour glass smashed by tide of dawn, tide of dawn, tide of dawn   As with modernization, the resolution of his picture of the world will be increased and he will gain more and more perspective.  The rubber of his tires or his shoes kisses the asphalt, and it comes back to morning -- it's eerily still as he tearily yarns.  Then, the hour glass/time is shattered with the tide (more ocean references here) of dawn, as the sun rises.  Perhaps this can even be a more poetic way to describe him gaining a new perspective on life, as ""dawn"" describes a new beginning.  Then there's the hook again, which repeats his feelings of his setting.    Sorry for the long explanation!  I enjoy analyzing lyrics and poetry, and I hope you can come to your own conclusions about ""Aquatrium"" as I did."
Nujabes,3a10qo,collegeshenanigans,4,Tue Jun 16 19:08:29 2015 UTC,"I enjoy analyzing lyrics and poetry, and I hope you can come to your own conclusions about ""Aquatrium"" as I did.

The part where he mentions sun and dark, I think lampposts are the light that devour the dark.   Also in the second verse he speaks of modern cities, citing cables and et cetera. I'll get back on this later."

Nujabes,39yy6y,criickyO,3,Tue Jun 16 03:11:09 2015 UTC,"His whole crew, pro era, uses a lot of old school samples, you'll probably actually like them. They have a much stronger modern old school vibe like madvillain. Ironically, capital steez' track by the same name sampled madvillain's ALL CAPS!, really nice flow. Capital steez was joey's wingman before he killed himself on Christmas like 4-5 years ago, many rumors but no factual answer as to why. One rumor was, to put it blunt and crudely, he was kinda crazy and believed he was the second coming of Jesus and was going to come back to life but then he didn't, but it's also some Tupac shit with that whole rumor. capital steez was even more old school, his samples were sick and his lyrics were real. Check out his AmeriKKKan Korruption mixtape, whole thing is unique as hell, like a breath of fresh air  Edit: and I forgot to mention that pro era is really about political matters for the most part their lyrics might blend in with newer hip hop, but they actually have some very good ethical subject"

George then scrapped everything and it wasn't heard about again (to my knowledge)."
Nujabes,39icve,FlamesNX,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:22:23 2015 UTC,"He said that he hasn't completely scrapped his stuff, just that he's not in the mood to make music at the moment."

Well, yeah, but you know how he is about waiting to release stuff. The stir fry rap was pretty much finished like a year or two before he uploaded the video.  Something tells me he's just kinda doing it for his fans though.

I agree his track record with this stuff is rocky, but you can't really tell how serious he is about this whole thing yet.  He's made a new channel (which to me seems like a real effort considering how inactive he's been about ""serious music"") and seems like he thinks it will be a place where the ""fans that actually care"" can follow and talk about / listen to his new stuff.  Right now all we can do is wait and hope he puts a real effort in."

Nujabes,39jmzr,Themrhalo3freak,3,Fri Jun 12 04:46:31 2015 UTC,"I remember when I first found him, I felt just like you. It was truly inspirational. For Nujabes, I would just go through all of his albums in chronological order, but everyone has their favorite nujabes song, and almost everybody found it in different ways. Music is best with memory so just throw on one of his albums while you are taking a walk, going on a drive, etc. and you will remember where you were when you were listening and it will have more of an impact. Besides Nujabes, you'd like Uyama Hiroto, Fat Jon, J Dilla, Flying Lotus, and Nitsua. I would start out with those guys, and from research you will find more like them. I'm not sure about the song sample, but his drum are almost always samples so they can be either digital, real, or a mix of both. They sound good because his songs are mixed perfectly, and he is great at putting pieces to the puzzle. If you'd like I could message you some links to songs I enjoy, and you can tell me what you think."

Some thoughts on it:  Substantial is great on ""Blank Canvas"", along with Midicronica on ""Wax"", no question there. ""NoctiLuca"" is pretty good, but I was slightly disappointed. I guess I expected more since DJ Okawari was involved. ""Earth Angel"" I really wanted to like, but I just can't. I keep comparing it to ""Lady Brown"" and it just doesn't hold a candle to it."

Nujabes,394oua,BlxckJxckVII,5,Tue Jun 9 06:11:06 2015 UTC,"Uh close yeah. It's not so much downfall of humanity but the downfall of an individual. It's a shoutout to Nujabes's death and his legacy. At least that's the way I interpret it.  So Spiritual State was released posthumously or after Jun's death. And the lyrics were written posthumously as well. The song starts out pretty hopeless, ""Firmament under deeper into uncertainty."" So he's questioning his faith maybe? Wondering why such a talented artist had to die at such a young age. Cise and Jun were pretty close from what I can tell, they worked a bunch together. I guess I don't know if they were but it does seem like it.  The most obvious salute to Nujabes's work is the ""Save it to the hard drive, I'm counting stars until I cried. Flowers in the final view, the world is ending come inside."" If you're familiar with Nujabes's work then you know Flowers, The Final View, and possibly World's End Rhapsody, are all mentioned here. So he's telling us to save Nujabes's music by continuing to listen to it, even though he's gone it will continue to live on in his audience.   The line you chose I think references Jun's death again and again talks about Cise's faith (if you listen to Cise or Cyne a lot you know he's pretty religious.) So maybe he's saying Jun is up in heaven happy or something? The line ""Looking at the final act hoping that we hold it dear"" I think is a pretty clear shout-out to Spiritual State as an album, since it can be seen as Jun's final act.   The second verse I feel is a lot more about Cise and life in general. It's more about like living on. Like it's ok to be sad but keep going or something like that. ""Measure of the moment till the world ends. Space between the breaths is eternity as the earth spins."" So time between breathes (very little) is eternity. So every second of life is extremely valuable. So again back to Jun it's like even though he's gone and he lived a short life, he made music we all love and we shouldn't look on at his death in sadness but rather look at his life and be happy."
Nujabes,394oua,LoRn21,2,Tue Jun 9 17:33:36 2015 UTC,"I see. I am familiar with most of Nujabes' work including Flowers and The Final Act. I listen to his songs on Soundcloud. This the first song I have ever heard of Cise Starr tbh, but I will check out some of his work with CYNE. Thanks for clearing it up for me and sorry if I sounded kind of ignorant about the song.

Nujabes,38z5he,pixelleration,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:42:08 2015 UTC,"It's a little different, but check out Ristorante Mixtape: Nujabes. Sides A and B.   It's lesser known than his big albums, but it's a compilation and flows into each song really nicely."
Nujabes,38z4sn,Venom517,2,Mon Jun 8 01:50:31 2015 UTC,"Hydeout-tribe.net  Yes. Prices are a bit expensive, but that's what happens when you buy stuff from Japan. Average prices for CDs are 25+ bucks and DVDs are twice as much.  Buy from Hydeout directly from them. Helps them keep his legacy alive and well."
Nujabes,38yhjr,Sexyphobe,8,Sun Jun 7 22:38:40 2015 UTC,"Nujabes usually sampled different songs and put them together in unison to make one beat on an MPC. Sometimes, though, he'd play the flute on various tracks like Ordinary Joe or Psychological Counterpoint. Plus, he'll sometimes have Uyama Hiroto play the saxophone or piano on his songs for the live factor. Occasionally, Nujabes would add his own synths and productions to a beat like in ""Child's Attraction"" which was made from scratch, albeit I'm not sure what equipment he used for it.  Fat Jon usually uses various samples too but he adds a lot of his own synths and live instrumentation too on top of it. Fat Jon actually tended to sample less than Nujabes. For instance, most of his beats on ""Koolmotor""(Five Deez album) were made almost entirely from scratch with synths, Rhodes keys, flute, etc. with occasional samples which is quite impressive. According to some interview I've read, Fat Jon uses the Akai MPC 3000, roland jp8000 synth, technic turntables, a mixer, and other equipment to make beats and he plays the flute, and the trumpet.  I'm not sure about RJD2 though. Maybe there's an interview where he explains it though."
Nujabes,38yhjr,chillhopfan,4,Sun Jun 7 23:39:35 2015 UTC,"A little bit of everything, I'd say. I know that Nujabes played flute, as seen here. He would also use samples to create his music. There's this dope website called [whosampled.com] (whosampled.com) where you can look for certain artists, or even songs, and hear the samples they used. Here's the page for Feather on whosampled. Some producers use programs like Fruity Loops, Ableton, or Pro Tools, to make their music, while others use hardware, like an MPC or ASR 10. Now most of these programs are going to come with their own sounds, like drum kicks and pianos, but they tend to sound a little ""cheesy"". So a producer might look online for a drum kit or just record their own sounds. There's also virtual instruments, called VSTs, that allow you to use a keyboard, or anything MIDI, to play music. This is a pretty brief overview of the whole process, but I hope it gives you some kind of idea on how music can be made."
Nujabes,38yhjr,AstroBG,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:47:23 2015 UTC,"In case anybody is wondering, the opening flute song in this link is ""Luv(sic) part 2"". One of my favorite songs!"
Nujabes,38yhjr,greenmileboy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:20:52 2015 UTC,"Nujabes's music was largely sample,, Fat Jon samples as well but he tends to get a bit more creative with them and manipulate them more.  RJD2's claim to fame is mixing a shit ton of samples together into one song, Ghostwriter for example uses 5 different samples."

Nujabes,38yhjr,greenmileboy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:19:30 2015 UTC,Almost all samples. Fat Jon usually composes his bass lines though. I try to make music similar to them as well. Shameless self promotion right here: http://djphixion.bandcamp.com
