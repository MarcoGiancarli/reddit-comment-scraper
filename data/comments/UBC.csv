UBC,3e38ip,hiyou102,2,Tue Jul 21 16:50:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not too surprised by this. Regarding the domestic retention rates, the majority of us pushed ourselves in high school to get that ~90% average to get into our faculties, which is not an easy task. We've experienced what it's like to be pushed and most people are able to exert the same effort into university.  Now I don't know anything about university admission in the States but isn't a large portion of getting into a university based on your SAT score? Being able to perform well on one big test is not really a good indicator of being able to succeed in university, which leads to many students underestimating how much work is required in uni. (again, I don't know anything about US admissions)"
UBC,3e38ip,JToews19,9,Tue Jul 21 20:22:47 2015 UTC,"Not to undercut the points you've made, but I suspect the higher cost of education in the US also negatively affects retention rates, even at American public universities which are typically more affordable (disclaimer: no numbers/sources)."
UBC,3e38ip,Advic,3,Tue Jul 21 23:45:52 2015 UTC,"This is probably the largest factor. University for Americans is very very expensive, and these numbers may count ""universities"" that are actually for profit or are straight-up scams. Those often have very low graduation rates as people just run out of money and quit."

UBC,3e38ip,JToews19,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:28:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about US admissions   It's a lot more streamlined and business-like. Most universities are part of Common App, a website that allows students to send one application to as many colleges as they want. That's what makes acceptance rates so low.   isn't a large portion of getting into a university based on your SAT score   You might be overestimating the SAT (i.e. I assume they'd notice if a student had high SAT scores but terrible grades). In addition, AP classes are pretty important to admissions and definitely prepared me for college more than anything else."

UBC,3e4p6h,Advic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:41:23 2015 UTC,The prerequisite chart doesn't say you need it therefore it's not required.  Maybe it's recommended because basic physics would show up on the MCAT?

Even if you won't be in the initial 2 week orientation, it might still be a helpful way to meet people in a similar situation to yourself as they will shuffle you into a group of people that are taking similar courses to you. Imagine Day will provide this to a limited extent, but it will not be tailored to international students.   Jump Start will also help with catching up on important paperwork like sorting your health insurance (especially important if you are an international student as you need to sort that ASAP - UBC's insurance coverage only lasts until the end of October). They also go over your legal rights to work while studying, limitations, where to get help/advice etc. So Jump Start is not just about getting oriented at UBC, it's also about getting oriented into Canada in general. If you've lived in Canada before, have citizenship, bank account, etc, then that aspect is much less important."

UBC,3dv9yx,mourningdoves,2,Mon Jul 20 06:25:44 2015 UTC,"Hi, I saw this and just wanted to let you know to not feel intimidated. I've dealt with a bad landlord before as well. The ruling by the arbitrator is the most important step and since you already have that, the rest is mostly paperwork.  Go to the small claims court and explain your situation. I believe you will have to fill in this form which you can get there. The people at the counter are really nice and are on your side. Listen to what they have to say. You can also definitely get that $100 waived and and in my case, I think they also tacked on some $ for time/interest.  After that you will have to serve the papers to the landlord/whoever owes you money. This was slightly difficult for me when I was doing it because it was against a large company. You have to make sure the name on the summons matches the person to whom the papers are served. I would do this step with a friend.  Finally, you will go to court on the date you are assigned. There should be other cases as well and everyone is just as nervous as you. You can definitely bring friends for support. The judge is very straightforward; asks you about your situation, asks the other party about what they're going to do, and usually at this point they'll just hand you the money to avoid more hassle. I wasn't able to get money reimbursed for travel costs though (parking, bus tickets, etc.) because the judge deemed it insignificant compared to what the landlord owed.  And yeah, that was it. Slightly intimidating if you've never been to court but honestly, you did nothing wrong. It was the other person at fault.   Good luck with your case and feel free to ask if you have questions!"

UBC,3dzbm7,Zelrak,0,Mon Jul 20 20:25:41 2015 UTC,I am aware that using artwork without an authorized license is copyright infringement. I can just go ahead and blatantly reproduce emojis like many people have done for merchandise from masks to tees. There is not a case about Apple suing brands yet because they are usually flying under radar. Unlike plagiarists I want to prevent a legal dispute before starting my line. That's why I am asking if there is at least an organization/someone that can help a student on a uni budget with legal opinion and general guidance.
UBC,3dzbm7,PsychoRecycled,7,Mon Jul 20 21:18:22 2015 UTC,"You found them: it's the LSLAP.  Go talk to them.    I would be shocked if this is something which can be had for less than $1500.  Copyright law is very, very complicated and serious (i.e. not flying under the radar) businesses which are definitely not violating copyright generally spend $1000 or so on legal fees just to get off the ground--getting registered as a business, tax stuff, etc.  (I am generalizing my experiences with video game developers, but none of the services were game-developer specific.)    Apple can still sue you even if you have a letter from a Canada's finest lawyer saying that what you're doing is okay--all they need to do is spend more money than you can and you lose by default, because the case stretches out so long that you're broke.    Use open-source emoji if you're passionate about the product.  If your business is trading on the brand recognition of Apple's emoji (which they own and worked to produce) I would say that ethically, they should be able to shut you down: here's hoping copyright law says the same thing."
UBC,3dzbm7,schmuck55,3,Mon Jul 20 23:45:25 2015 UTC,"As someone who worked at LSLAP, I can tell you this really isn't the kind of thing they do. They exist to represent low-income people in court (and court-like forums like the residential tenancy board) and draft certain kinds of documents. They don't really write legal opinions. In fact, it's explicitly stated on their website that they don't deal with business/commercial law, which is the category this would fall under. They also have fairly strict requirements when it comes to who they help because there is so much demand. You have to actually need their service, eg if you've been charged with a crime - OP doesn't have to start this business, whatever it is.  And not to put down law students but this isn't the kind of thing you would want a student's opinion on anyway, copyright law is pretty complicated.  I agree with you that people get sued by moneyed corporations even if the law is on the individual's side, because getting sued is expensive even if you end up winning. So getting an opinion at this stage is probably useless."

I can't offer you the insight of a veteran int'l student, but I can agree with your choice to move early. I am living off campus and decided that it would be best for me to move in and get used to my new place August 1st rather than September 1st, so that I have a month (rather than a week) to get used to my new surroundings, my new roommates, and getting used to living on my own again without parental help.  This isn't my first time moving away to school, so I can offer some advice for that. It will be a big change. It's best to give yourself the time to adjust rather than get immersed all at once because that will be really stressful for you. Especially considering the fact that you have never been to Vancouver/Canada is even more of a reason to go early. You will be able to get used to transit (if you live off campus) and just enjoy your new home without any pressure.

Making friends in residence is about as difficult as falling out of a tree, because everyone feels like they should be making friends in residence, but you will probably feel some disconnect: you (probably) have some life experiences they don't.  When I was in my third year, I occasionally felt like first years were basically another species, but it varies person-to-person, and I had less in common with them than you.  Everyone will have just gotten out of high school so brush off your best high school stories.    BC's drinking age is 19, so you might get asked to buy liquor.  Drinking is explicitly allowed in residence, so you won't get in trouble.  (NB: I don't drink, so I don't know how people living in residence actually get alcohol, so that's speculation.  I imagine there are ways for those under 19 to purchase alcohol which don't involve someone over 19, but asking your 20-year-old floormate to get it for you seems like an easy option.)  It sounds like you're already committed to going into first-year residence, so I won't bad-mouth it too hard: it's an okay place and it probably won't be awful.  You will probably feel some disconnection from your neighbours, and you might have to work a bit harder to have an AWESOME experience, but you can work around all of that.  You will get out what you put in.    I will advise that you try to join a club or two related to your intended degree, both for the social benefits of regular interaction with people who are your own age, and because interacting with upper-year students taking degrees you might think about is very valuable: you can't talk to yourself from the future, but this is the next best thing.

UBC,3dum0f,PsychoRecycled,2,Sun Jul 19 17:13:49 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what credits you got, but as long as you get 27, you can get promoted to second year. You could do all Science courses, and still get promoted.   If OP ends up failing to transfer to Science though, it may be difficult to declare an Arts major on time (many Arts majors have you declare at the end of your second year, and at this point is where you have to have fulfilled the specific course requirements in your intended major)."
UBC,3dum0f,drowningmango,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:46:29 2015 UTC,is it also possible to transfer in the later years if you failed transferring to second year?
UBC,3dum0f,cyclopentadienyl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:24:51 2015 UTC,"I want to go into computer science in the science faculty, I don't want to complete the arts electives as I am not interested in taking languages and more into the sciences  edit: I also might want to minor in some science subject or do honours CS and it says you have to apply thru faculty of science"
UBC,3dum0f,cyclopentadienyl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:46:24 2015 UTC,"I transferred from arts to science 3 years ago. The faculty doesn't really care because first year arts is all general classes until you know what you plan to major in. I took all of first year science +astu150 (arts equivalent to engl 112 which is no longer offered).  I even asked one of the arts academic advisers to increase my credit limit that term to 32 so I that I could complete all my courses telling that I intended to transfer faculties from the start. However, we did have a talk about why I chose to apply for arts instead of science. (I had a 87.5 average with no extra curriculars and knew I had no chance of being accepted to science right away)"
UBC,3dum0f,cyclopentadienyl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:51:34 2015 UTC,Thanks what did you apply for your specialization(major)? and what was your gpa? Was the transfer fairly simple?   So basically I'm allowed to do all science courses math physics computer science etc and they won't care? And I would be in second years standing for science if i get accepted?
UBC,3dum0f,cyclopentadienyl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:53:34 2015 UTC,"I got in with a 65 average in term 1. (The cutoff is most likely much higher now) Even though I was already accepted into Science in January, I had to pull up my grades in term 2 before I officially left arts so that I could declare my major in Chemistry. In june, I followed the same first year specialization declaration as everyone else in Science, so your major doesn't matter. On ssc between October and December, (I dont remember the exact month) but it was for sure in term 1, you go on ssc and click 'Change of Degree/Faculty,' click the faculty you want to switch to and pay the $60 fee again. They didn't ask me for a supplemental or anything. I got put into 2nd year science after my 1st year grades were finalized and even today, only my friends from high school knew that I was ever in arts. But do check to make sure you have all the required classes to be promoted to second year. They will promote you to second year the same way they look at anyone else in Science."
UBC,3dum0f,cyclopentadienyl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:06:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks, so when I officially start at UBC for arts, I would click change of degree between October or December what ever month it is during the 1st year?  So basically if I was in CS Arts I would change to CS Science? Something like that?  So basically it is a simple transfer if you have a high enough gpa? Cause I heard on here that it is difficult to change faculties."
UBC,3dum0f,smrao1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, the transfer process is actually a lot simpler than it seems to be Edit: Didn't see the bottom of the post. Your grades/possibly supplemental are simply either good enough to be accepted into the faculty of Science or theyre not. I do agree that it is hard to have good grades, but if theyre not high enough, you can try again next year. There's no extensive paperwork/interview/physical labor associated with transferring or anything to make things hard on you."
UBC,3dum0f,smrao1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:17:03 2015 UTC,Thanks do you think it would be fairy simple to get high enough grades to transfer if I study enough and go do workshops etc?

Despite my 65 average in first term here, (you should aim for something much higher) I did try, but it felt like there was never enough time to prepare for everything. Some people would agree, some would disagree. But I do have friends who failed to transfer into Science and just stayed in Arts."
UBC,3dum0f,Evadi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:44:14 2015 UTC,Were your friends the same year as you? What was their average? ; did you have any other friends that successfully transferred into science? what was the ratio between that got denied and accepted?

UBC,3dum0f,Evadi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:13:07 2015 UTC,So would it be better for a person to go to college first for science and then transfer to UBC second year science? Or is it just the same as transferring from arts to science? Would it be easier to go to college science faculty? or go to ubc arts then transfer to science?  Like it is possible for people to do 1 or 2 years at a college and transfer to UBC.  Would it be any difference? Just the difference that you're in UBC but not in college?  Do you think a lot of people has a good chance in transferring if they get a good gpa? Would you say it is notoriously difficult to transfer?
UBC,3dum0f,Evadi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:16:40 2015 UTC,"I transferred to UBC Science 3rd year (applied in second year when I was taking most of the required general science courses, not even all of them) without any issues, and without having super good grades. I had around a 75% average in the science courses I took, which is definitely manageable if you stay on top of your courses.  You could just take the 1st year science courses as an arts student for sure.  Transferring was super easy, I didn't even bother to go see an advisor (though I recommend that you do if you are at all concerned about properly interpreting the requirements).  It honestly doesn't matter at all whether you're in Arts or Sciences in your first year apart from a transfer fee - you can take the exact same courses either way. And it doesn't even matter whether you're in your ""official"" program or not (for you CS) right away, I hadn't declared my actual major until the second semester of third year and I still graduated on time - it only matters once you start taking classes that can only be registered if you're in a certain program (even then you can usually get in if it's not too popular and you talk to the professor).  Also, if you want to do CS, I would recommend trying to get through as much of CPSC 110, 121, and 210 as you feel comfortable with in first year."

UBC,3dtivl,Senjae,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:41:22 2015 UTC,"The Computer Science department is generally pretty good about fitting people into courses. If there is enough demand, there may be an additional lecture section created. Otherwise, there are a lot of seats that open up after the first week or two from people dropping the course, when they realize that these courses require a lot of time and dedication to do well in. If you're still on the waitlist by the time the term starts, go to the lectures and keep watching for seats to open up -- the concepts build upon themselves, and there is some amount of a learning curve.  Also make sure that you're registered in a lab section, and attend the labs. Again, if there is enough demand, additional lab sections may be created.  For now, use resources like aneyeout to notify you when seats open up (since waitlists do not automatically transfer people into the course as soon as a seat opens)."
UBC,3dtivl,pikachufan2164,0,Sun Jul 19 08:53:55 2015 UTC,"Here's the general advice I give regarding full courses and waitlists:   It's quite common to not get into every section you want unless you have a time very early on the first day of registration. My suggestion to you is that if you don't get every section you want, bookmark the pages of those sections and check as many times a day as you can up until September. There is a 99% chance that you will get into everything you want just because people add/drop all the time leading up to the first day of classes. And if this happens, just register in another section for the time being just in case all else fails. You can also try a website like www.aneyeout.com (free) and www.myubccourseisfull.com ($5 per section) which will send you a text when the section you want to watch has an open seat.   Waitlists:   If a course has a waitlist, you will see it listed under all the course sections. Here's an example. At the bottom you see two waitlist sections. You register in those waitlist sections and you will be manually added by the respective department. If you do not see a waitlist section, that class does not have one.  I bolded manually added because this means that you will not be automatically added even if a space opens up in the class. Don't get the false impression that you don't have to worry about anything once you register for the waitlist. The majority of waitlists I have registered for did end up adding me into the class, but your safest bet is to repeatedly check the section you want to check if there are open seats.  Your position in the waitlist is determined by the order in which people register on the list. Whoever registers first in it is first to be manually added into the class. But remember that you can still manually register yourself for an open seat in the section you want even if you are registered on the waitlist!"
UBC,3dssnx,Darkest-timeline,4,Sun Jul 19 02:49:32 2015 UTC,"Meal plan: get the minimum meal plan and add onto it as you go.  It's hard to say whether it'll be enough for you: depends how much you eat, and how expensive the things you like to eat are.  Each purchase you make is recorded (you can see the amount and the place, although not what you bought, online).    My advice is to eat 'normally' for about a month and see how much it costs--a month is enough data to project for the rest of the year.  If you are careful in taking a sandwich or whatever from the cafeteria for lunch, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to get through the entire year with just the meal plan, but you'll want an entertainment budget.  You will want to get off campus every now and again, and that generally involves food.  (Even if it's only frozen yogurt in Wesbrook Village.)    Avoid drinks other than water in residence (expensive) and try to eat breakfast in your room.  Buy a minifridge, some milk, cereal, bagels, cream cheese, etc. and you're good.  There is a Save-on Foods nearby and you will probably be able to get away with only going every two/three weeks.    UBC is notoriously stingy with money.

UBC,3ds7pe,dudehair,15,Sat Jul 18 23:18:12 2015 UTC,"If this is any help - here's a bit about the approach of the two courses. In a nutshell, I think it depends most on what you're interested in starting with: the ancient stories and characters in their social context, or the overarching Greek world-view and its influence on philosophy & science?     CLST 105 is mainly about the central stories and characters of Greek and Roman mythology, their sources, their social and historical context, and why we should care. (For example, when we read parts of one story, Homer's Iliad, we try to get a handle on the story of the Trojan War, the gods who shape the narrative, why it's a powerful piece of literature, why the Greeks thought Achilles was so cool, and what the portrayal of Helen can tell us about the representation of women in the ancient world). PHIL 211 is mainly about the ways the ancient Greeks viewed their universe, how the gods of mythology evolved into the basic elements and forces of early philosophy and science, whether myth and science were that different, and how Greek philosophy became an enduring ""way of life"" with Socrates. (For example, we look at a bit of the Iliad in 211 too, but in a different light: can human beings really be happy? How? in a universe where most actions are caused by gods, is there room for human freedom? The same questions go for a universe where the gods have become atoms and void - as some classical Greeks posited: is there room for human happiness & freedom now?)   The evaluation structure and reading load for the two courses is pretty similar: the focus here is on essay writing, but no prior experience is assumed.

This makes the hiring process slow and it does become hard to respond quickly to demand spikes. It's ridiculous to say that CS neglected the hiring aspect because they have actually hired two new faculty members who will be starting Sep/1/2015 (or maybe they started July/1/2015) but they may not start teaching core undergraduate courses until 2016.

UBC,3dqf73,GetFreeCash,8,Sat Jul 18 21:23:54 2015 UTC,"Nothing says ""Totally Not Awkward"" than screaming ""Get Free Cash"" in the middle of a giant crowd by yourself.  Do it, OP. Screaming is guaranteed to break the ice with your fellow students."
UBC,3dqf73,jello24,4,Sat Jul 18 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"i think i just might, but im broke af so youd better be there"
UBC,3dqf73,isuckatgolf97,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:48:58 2015 UTC,I'm going! Just out of curiosity are you domestic or international?
UBC,3doxyp,sonofableepblop,4,Sat Jul 18 01:39:55 2015 UTC,"I'm taking one this term.  I know some people who have taken them: they said they did not, in general, do as well on them as they normally do.    They might be harder, but some of that is also because you are now four months away from the course."
UBC,3doxyp,PsychoRecycled,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:30:49 2015 UTC,"You'll want to email your prof to ask about exam details in case there's been a change.   I deferred my summer exam to November. The class is taught by a different prof in the summer than in the fall semester. I found out that I had the option of taking the exam written by the prof I took the class with in the summer, or taking an exam written by the (different) prof teaching the same class in the fall. Obviously, I went with the former option, but I'm not sure what would have happened if I didn't email my professor to clarify."
UBC,3doxyp,spinelesshagfish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:48:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/PsychoRecycled, the lowest exam mark I got on an exam in the class I got deferred was 78%, but I got a 72% on the final exam. It was harder just because it was a first term course, and i had taken 5 other courses since then (plus 2 courses during the summer when the exam took place). So I wasn't really able to keep studying for ir or anything so I just 'forgot' everything I had learned -- thus, making it seem like the test was harder. However, I don't think the actual test itself was any different. If you suffer from anxiety during exams contact Access and Diversity, the exam atmosphere is much better and less crowded."
UBC,3doxyp,wounderby,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:39:40 2015 UTC,"Last day of exams 2 years ago was snowed out.  Made up the December exam in February.  Sucked ass.  I forgot half the information, and it was a course I wasnt passionate about."
UBC,3dp7g9,PsychoRecycled,4,Sat Jul 18 03:08:47 2015 UTC,"What I usually do is go to UBC Pair, go to Grades Distribution, fill out the appropriate information (the course and the appropriate year/session) and once the information is sent to my email I just read the course section codes.   Most departments label sections in first term starting as '1xx' and section in second term starting as '2xx'. For the departments that do it differently, you can just crossreference with the current listings on the Course Schedule for how that department does it."
UBC,3dnqyn,muscfrightensme,3,Fri Jul 17 19:39:21 2015 UTC,"All the ensembles at UBC, choral, bands, orchestra, and opera audition and accept non music majors. The acceptance rate changes year to year based on who had graduated last year, and the programming for the concerts.  It's always with auditioning, and if you don't get in, don't assume it has everything to do with skill"
UBC,3dnqyn,dwattsgrant,2,Fri Jul 17 21:20:35 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what instrument you play. If you play Violin or Viola you would have a very good chance of getting in if you could play at like a Royal Conservatory grade 8 level. If you play a woodwind or brass instrument, you have absolutely no chance of getting in as those limited spots are reserved for the top players in the music school.   Don't let this discourage you from auditioning though! The music school has a great faculty who will definitely have some great tips for your playing. If you play a band instrument, there's also the concert wind ensemble which is where many non music majors play. You still get the 150 credit but it's much less intense in terms of practicing required than the Orchestra."
UBC,3dnqyn,BigTromboner,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:03:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! Gave me some hope :')  How about cello? I got my ARCT two years ago but my technique from then is long gone :/
UBC,3dnqyn,BigTromboner,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:08:44 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'm not saying there's no chance but it might be tough. Some of our good cello players just graduated so there are defnitely some  spots but it all depends on who auditions"
UBC,3dnggm,ubchopeful,6,Fri Jul 17 18:21:31 2015 UTC,"have you looked at the cognitive systems program requirements? it's sorta like a mix of everything (psyc, phil, compsci, etc.) http://www.cogsys.ubc.ca/advising/degree-requirements/"
UBC,3dnggm,Hisotensoku,2,Fri Jul 17 23:51:29 2015 UTC,Double majoring without taking extra courses is not possible. You can minor in Philosophy (assuming you're doing Computer Science through a BA)
UBC,3dnggm,wounderby,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:01:02 2015 UTC,"http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,215,410,1468  Depending on where you want to do your computer science (you can get a BA in computer science or a BSc in computer science) different sections of that page will be relevant to you: however, it should answer your preliminary questions.    Some background information would be helpful: are you transferring into UBC?  What year of CPSC would you be transferring into?  How many courses is 'too many'--graduating on time with a double major would be hard.    Have you considered a minor, or other blended degree options?  A double major seems...excessive."
